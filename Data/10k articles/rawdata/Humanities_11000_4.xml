      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14511">The [[2009 Indian general election]] was held in five phases between April 16 and May 13, 2009. During the course of the campaign, several controversies arose, with parties being accused by one another and the [[Election Commission of India]] of violating the model code of conduct that was in force during the election.

==Indian National Congress==
* The Election Commission took exception to a full page advertisement on the [[2010 Commonwealth Games]] taken out in major Delhi newspapers. The advertisement listed the infrastructural facilities that have come up in preparation for the 2010 event – including 24 flyovers, 75 aerobridge airport, 1,285&amp;nbsp;km of better roads, 5,000 low-floor buses, 80 new metro destinations, 11 world-class sports venues and thousands of job opportunities. The EC served notice to the [[Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports]], the [[Cabinet Secretary#India|Cabinet Secretary]] and the [[Chief Secretary (India)|Chief Secretary]] of Delhi, stating that the advertisement is a clear violation of the model code of conduct since it enumerates the achievements of the UPA Government. The EC has also asked the violators to pay from their own pockets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2009/03/08/stories/2009030855320800.htm Election Commission pulls up Delhi, Centre over advertisement], [[The Hindu]], March 8, 2009.

* The EC directed the [[District Magistrate]] of [[Pilibhit (Lok Sabha constituency)|Pilibhit]] to lodge a criminal case against the BJP's candidate [[Varun Gandhi]] for his allegedly inflammatory speech against non-[[Hinduism|Hindus]] made on March 7, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/ec-to-file-criminal-case-against-varun-gandhi/87895-37.html|title=EC to file criminal case against Varun Gandhi|date=March 17, 2009|publisher=[[CNN-IBN]]|accessdate=2009-03-17| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090320040611/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/ec-to-file-criminal-case-against-varun-gandhi/87895-37.html| archivedate= 20 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was taken after the EC had earlier issued a notice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/ec-seeks-report-on-varun-gandhi-communal-remarks/87745-37.html|title=EC seeks report on Varun Gandhi 'communal' remarks|date=March 15, 2009|publisher=[[CNN-IBN]]|accessdate=2009-03-16| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090316210547/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/ec-seeks-report-on-varun-gandhi-communal-remarks/87745-37.html| archivedate= 16 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Varun Gandhi and the BJP. After reviewing the incident, the EC found Varun Gandhi guilty of violating the model code of conduct by creating feeling of enmity and hatred between different communities. However, since Varun has not been convicted by a court of law, the EC can not bar him from contesting the election. Instead, they have recommended to his party, the BJP, to drop him from their list of candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/scolded-slammed-poll-panels-order-against-varun/88380-37.html|title=Poll panel's order against Varun|date=March 23, 2009|publisher=[[CNN-IBN]]|accessdate=2009-03-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090324002240/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/scolded-slammed-poll-panels-order-against-varun/88380-37.html| archivedate= 24 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BJP have since come out in support of Varun and have refused to drop Varun as a candidate, saying that the EC has no right to provide such a recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/bjp-backs-varun-asks-ec-to-not-advise/88406-37.html|title=BJP backs Varun, asks EC to not advise|date=March 23, 2009|publisher=[[CNN-IBN]]|accessdate=2009-03-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090324014259/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/bjp-backs-varun-asks-ec-to-not-advise/88406-37.html| archivedate= 24 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was then sent to judicial custody{{clarify|date=May 2011}}&lt;!--how many days?--&gt; and booked under the National Security Act by the government of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister [[Mayawati]] on charges of inciting communal tensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/varun-booked-under-nsa-bjp-up-in-arms/88989-37.html|title=Varun booked under NSA, BJP up in arms|date=March 29, 2009|publisher=[[CNN-IBN]]|accessdate=2009-03-31| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090330174605/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/varun-booked-under-nsa-bjp-up-in-arms/88989-37.html| archivedate= 30 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently elected with the biggest majority of anyone of the four [[Gandhi family]] candidates running in the election, including his [[Maneka Gandhi|mother]], [[sonia Gandhi|aunt]] and [[rahul Gandhi|first-cousin]].

* Former BJP Lok Sabha MP Ananth Kumar Hegde became the second BJP leader of this election to be reported for making a hate speech against a particular community. During an election rally at [[Karwar]], Kumar allegedly threatened to prevent Muslims from celebrating religious festivals after cautioning the people against activities of Islamist groups. Karnataka's Chief Electoral Officer has sent a report on this incident along with a CD of Kumar's speech to the CEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/after-varun-another-bjp-leader-in-hate-speech-row/89206-37.html|title=After Varun, another BJP leader in hate speech row|date=April 1, 2009|publisher=[[CNN-IBN]]|accessdate=2009-04-01| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090403144415/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/after-varun-another-bjp-leader-in-hate-speech-row/89206-37.html| archivedate= 3 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party workers were seen distributing [[Indian Rupee|Rs.]] 100 notes to all those who attended the rally.

'''The Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882''' was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] (as it then was). It was introduced by [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury]], recognising the need for a governmental administration on the protection of [[ancient monuments]], and was finally passed after a number of failed attempts on heritage protection acts. The gradual change towards a state-based authority responsible for the safeguarding of the Kingdom's national heritage manifested itself through the appointment of the first Inspector of Ancient Monuments in 1882, [[Augustus Pitt Rivers|General Pitt-Rivers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNBSupp|wstitle=Pitt-Rivers, Augustus Henry Lane Fox |first=Edward Burnett|last=Tylor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Schedule==

The 1882 Act contains a schedule of the initial 68 sites that were covered by the legislation. This schedule exclusively focussed on pre-historic monuments, and covered some of the most famous such sites in the country, alongside some that were felt to be at particular risk at the time.

===England and Wales===
There were 26 English sites listed in the Schedule, in just 10 counties, including seven sites in [[Wiltshire]]. Welsh monuments were represented by one site in  each of north, south and west Wales.&lt;ref name=hunter&gt;{{cite wikisource |last=Hunter|first=Robert |chapter= Appendix A |wslink= The Preservation of Places of Interest or Beauty |plaintitle=The Preservation of Places of Interest or Beauty|year= 1907 |publisher= Manchester University Press}} (includes the full text of the 1882 Act).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
In 1882 the whole of Ireland was under British administration. Subsequent legislation for Ireland used the terminology of 'Historic Monuments', which continues in Northern Ireland. Three sites in the Schedule are in what became Northern Ireland, one being in County Armagh and two in County Down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doeni.gov.uk/niea/part_1_-_scheduled_historic_monuments.pdf Northern Ireland Environment Agency, The Schedule of Historic Monuments. 31 March 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403224222/http://www.doeni.gov.uk/niea/part_1_-_scheduled_historic_monuments.pdf |date=3 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fifteen sites now in the [[Republic of Ireland]] are protected by the [[National Monument (Ireland)|National Monuments Service]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://webgis.archaeology.ie/NationalMonuments/FlexViewer/ National Monuments database at archeology.ie]&lt;/ref&gt; and include two world heritage sites. As with England and Wales, the 1882 selection was overwhelmingly those thought to be prehistoric sites, although there is now uncertainty over the age of many sites.

'''Antonio Cornejo-Polar''' (1936–1997) was a [[Peru]]vian-born academic, teacher, literature and cultural critic, known particularly for his theorization of the concept of "[[heterogeneity]]."

==Biography==
Cornejo Polar was born December 23, 1936 in [[Arequipa, Peru]].  He received a PhD from the [[National University of San Agustin]] in [[Arequipa]], became a professor there as well, then in 1966 he becomes Professor in [[National University of San Marcos]], Lima. He was also a visiting professor at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and [[UC Berkeley]].

He authored 11 books, and was considered an authority on Latin-American literature and culture. He was also the founder and editor of the ''Revista de Critica Literaria Latinoamericana'', a journal which covered issues of culture and ideology in Latin-American literature.

Cornejo-Polar was married to Cristina Soto, who worked with him on the journal, and also managed "Latinoamericana Editores", a publishing company which covers Latin-American topics.  They had four children Ursula, Alvaro, Gonzalo and Rafael and four grandsons Gonzalo, Juán Diego, Antonio and Natalia.

He died after a long illness on May 18, 1997, in Lima.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8542">The '''argument from marginal cases''' (also known as the '''argument from species overlap''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.animal-ethics.org/argument-species-overlap/ | website=Animal Ethics | title=The argument from species overlap | accessdate=2015-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[philosophical argument]] within [[animal rights]] theory regarding the moral status of non-human animals. Its proponents hold that if human infants, the senile, the [[coma|comatose]], and the [[cognition|cognitively]] disabled have direct moral status, animals must have a similar status, since there is no known morally relevant ability that those marginal-case humans have that animals lack. "Moral status" may refer to a right not to be killed or made to suffer, or to a general moral requirement to be treated in a certain way.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Dombrowski|Dombrowski, Daniel]] (1997). ''Babies and Beasts: The Argument from Marginal Cases''. University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A version of this argument has been put forward by [[Peter Singer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/anim-eth/#SSH3ai Animals and Ethics – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of the argument==
The argument from marginal cases takes the form of a [[proof by contradiction]]. It attempts to show that you cannot coherently believe both that all humans have moral status, ''and'' that all non-humans lack moral status.

Consider a cow. We ask why it is acceptable to kill this cow for food – we might claim, for example, that the cow has no concept of [[self (philosophy)|self]] and therefore it cannot be wrong to kill it. However, many young children may also lack this same concept of "self".&lt;ref&gt;Harter, S. (1983). Developmental perspectives on the self-system. In P. H. Mussen (Ed.), Handbook of child psychology, (4th ed., Vol. 4, (pp. 275–385). New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; So if we accept the self-concept criterion, then we must also accept that killing children is acceptable in addition to killing cows, which is considered a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]''. So the concept of self cannot be our criterion.

The proponent will usually continue by saying that for any criterion or set of criteria (either capacities, e.g. language, consciousness, the ability to have moral responsibilities towards others; or relations, e.g. sympathy or power relations)&lt;ref&gt;Horta, Oscar. “The Scope of the Argument from Species Overlap”, ''Journal of Applied Philosophy'', 31, 2014, 142-154.&lt;/ref&gt; there exists some "marginal" human who is [[mentally handicapped]] in some way that would also meet the criteria for having no moral status. [[Peter Singer]] phrases it this way: 

{{Quote|text=The catch is that any such characteristic that is possessed by all human beings will not be possessed only by human beings. For example, all human beings, but not only human beings, are capable of feeling pain; and while only human beings are capable of solving complex mathematical problems, not all humans can do this.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Peter. Animal Liberation. New York: HarperCollins, 2002. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Proponents==
[[Daniel Dombrowski]] writes that the argument can be traced to [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] in the third century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Dombrowski, Daniel A. "Vegetarianism and the Argument from Marginal Cases in Porphyry". ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 45.1 (1984): 141–143.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Rachels]] has argued that the theory of [[evolution]] implies that there is only a gradient between humans and other animals, and therefore marginal-case humans should be considered similar to non-human animals.&lt;ref&gt;Rachels, James. ''Created from Animals: The Moral Implications of Darwinism. Oxford University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism&lt;!--'Argument from species normality' redirects here--&gt;==
A counter-argument is the '''argument from species normality'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (a term coined by David Graham), proposed by [[Tibor Machan]]. In considering the rights of children or the disabled, Machan uses the analogy of a broken chair:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... classifications and ascriptions of capacities rely on the good sense of making certain generalizations. One way to show this is to recall that broken chairs, while they aren't any good to sit on, are still chairs, not monkeys or palm trees. Classifications are not something rigid but something reasonable. While there are some people who either for a little or longer while – say when they're asleep or in a coma – lack [[moral agency]], in general people possess that capacity, whereas non-people don't. So it makes sense to understand them having rights so their capacity is respected and may be protected. This just doesn't work for other animals.&lt;ref&gt;Machan, Tibor. ''Putting Humans First: Why We Are Nature's Favorite''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

David Graham interprets this to mean that if most of a species' members are moral agents then any member has the same rights and protections as the species. In brief, "The moral status of an individual depends on what is normal for that individual's species."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strike-the-root.com/4/graham/graham1.html A Libertarian Replies to Tibor Machan's 'Why Animal Rights Don't Exist'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

James Rachels has responded to Machan that if one adopts the idea that individuals of a species must be treated according to what is normal for that species, then it would imply a chimp that somehow acquired the ability to read and write should not enter a university since it is not "normal" behavior for a chimpanzee.&lt;ref&gt;''Animal Rights and Human Obligations'', p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

A related counterargument from [[Roderick Long]] is that a being can obtain moral agency by developing a [[Rationality|rational]] capacity, and from there on has full moral agency even if this capacity is lost or diminished:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That is why a cow has no rights, though a human being reduced to the mental level of a cow does have them. There's something wrong with the human; there's nothing wrong with the cow. One might say that in the case of the cow-minded human, there's a blank spot where her moral agency is supposed to be, and someone else can step into that blank spot and act as an agent on her behalf. But in the cow there's no blank spot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://praxeology.net/unblog01-03.htm#13 Why Fur Is Not Murder]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Doctor Arthur L. Caplan, in an article on the ethics of organ donation by infants with [[anencephaly]] - born essentially without a brain - before physical death, raises some points that might be considered counters to the Argument from Marginal Cases.{{by whom|date=June 2017}}{{clarify|reason=Aren't those points ''for'' marginal cases - instead of counters?|date=June 2017}} He writes that some people cannot emotionally handle treating the anencephalic child as not worthy of moral status. Caplan also mentions concerns about possible misdiagnosis risk - the risk that an infant would be incorrectly diagnosed with anencephaly, and also the slippery-slope concern - the concern that other individuals are then at risk for organ donation, such as those in vegetative states or with severe disabilities.&lt;ref&gt; "Is It Ethical to Use Anencephalic Newborns for Organ Donation?" by Arthur L. Caplan, PhD (Medscape, http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/876605)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9091">'''BagIt''' is a set of hierarchical file system conventions designed to support disk-based storage and network transfer of arbitrary digital content.  A "bag" consists of a "payload" (the arbitrary content) and "tags", which are [[metadata]] files intended to document the storage and transfer of the bag.  A required tag file contains a manifest listing every file in the payload together with its corresponding [[checksum]].  The name, ''BagIt'', is inspired by the "enclose and deposit" method,&lt;ref name="ENCDEP"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://iwaw.europarchive.org/05/papers/iwaw05-tabata.pdf|title=A Collaboration Model between Archival Systems to Enhance the Reliability of Preservation by an Enclose-and-Deposit Method|year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes referred to as "bag it and tag it".

Bags are ideal for digital content normally kept as a collection of files.  They are also well-suited to the export, for archival purposes, of content normally kept in database structures that receiving parties are unlikely to support.  Relying on cross-platform ([[Windows]] and [[Unix]]) filesystem naming conventions, a bag's payload may include any number of [[Directory (computing)|directories]] and sub-directories (folders and sub-folders).  A bag can specify payload content indirectly via a "fetch.txt" file that lists [[URLs]] for content that can be fetched over the network to complete the bag; simple [[parallel computing|parallelization]] (e.g. running 10 instances of [[Wget]]) can exploit this feature to transfer large bags very quickly.  Benefits of bags include:

* Wide adoption in digital libraries (e.g. the [[Library of Congress]]).
* Easy to implement using ubiquitous and ordinary filesystem tools.
* Content that originates as files need only be copied to the payload directory.
* Compared to [[XML]] wrapping, content need not be encoded (e.g. [[Base64]]) which saves time and storage space.
* Received content is ready-to-go in a familiar filesystem tree.
* Easy to implement fast network transfer by running ordinary transfer tools in parallel.

== Specification ==

BagIt is currently defined in [[Request for Comments|RFC]] 8493 &lt;ref name="rfc"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8493|title=The BagIt File Packaging Format (V1.0)|accessdate=29 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. It defines a simple file naming convention used by the [[digital curation]] community for packaging up arbitrary digital content, so that it can be reliably transported via both physical media ([[hard disk drive]], [[CD-ROM]], [[DVD]]) and network transfers ([[FTP]], [[HTTP]], [[rsync]], etc.). BagIt is also used for managing the [[digital preservation]] of content over time. Discussion about the specification and its future directions takes place on the [https://groups.google.com/group/digital-curation Digital Curation discussion list].

The BagIt specification is organized around the notion of a “bag”. A bag is a named [[Folder (computing)|file system directory]] that minimally contains:

* a “data” directory that includes the payload, or data files that comprise the digital content being preserved. Files can also be placed in subdirectories, but empty directories are not supported
* at least one manifest file that itemizes the filenames present in the “data” directory, as well as their checksums. The particular [[checksum algorithm]] is included as part of the manifest filename. For instance a manifest file with [[MD5]] checksums is named “manifest-md5.txt”
* a “bagit.txt” file that identifies the directory as a bag, the version of the BagIt specification that it adheres to, and the [[character encoding]] used for tag files

On receipt of a bag a piece of software can examine the manifest file to make sure that the payload files are present, and that their checksums are correct. This allows for accidentally removed, or corrupted files to be identified. Below is an example of a minimal bag “myfirstbag” that encloses two files of payload. The contents of the tag files are included below their filenames.

&lt;pre&gt;
myfirstbag/
|-- data
|   \-- 27613-h
|       \-- images
|           \-- q172.png
|           \-- q172.txt
|-- manifest-md5.txt
|     49afbd86a1ca9f34b677a3f09655eae9 data/27613-h/images/q172.png
|     408ad21d50cef31da4df6d9ed81b01a7 data/27613-h/images/q172.txt
\-- bagit.txt
      BagIt-Version: 0.97
      Tag-File-Character-Encoding: UTF-8
&lt;/pre&gt;

In this example the payload happens to consist of a [[Portable Network Graphics]] image file and an [[Optical Character Recognition]] text file. In general the identification and definition of [[file format]]s is out of the scope of the BagIt specification; [[File attribute]]s are likewise out of scope.

The specification allows for several optional tag files (in addition to the manifest). Their character encoding must be identified in “bagit.txt”, which itself must always be encoded in [[UTF-8]]. The specification defines the following optional tag files:

* a “bag-info.txt” file which details metadata for the bag, using colon-separated key/value pairs (similar to [[HTTP headers]])
* a tag manifest file which lists tag files and their associated checksums (e.g. “tagmanifest-md5.txt”)
* a “fetch.txt” that lists URLs where payload files can be retrieved from in addition or to replace payload files in the “data” directory

Until version 15, the draft also described how to serialize a bag in an [[archive file]], such as [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] or [[tar (file format)|TAR]]. From version 15 on, the serialization is no longer part of the specifications, but not because of technical reasons but only because of the scope and focus of the specification.

== History ==

The BagIt specification emerged from a collaboration between [[The Library of Congress]] and the [[California Digital Library]] while transferring digital content created as part of the [[National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program]]. The origins of the idea date back to work done at the [[University of Tsukuba]] on the "enclose and deposit" model, for mutually depositing archived resources to enable long-term [[digital preservation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iwaw.europarchive.org/05/papers/iwaw05-tabata.pdf|title=A Collaboration Model between Archival Systems to Enhance the Reliability of Preservation by an Enclose-and-Deposit Method|last=Tabata|first=Koichi|format=pdf|accessdate=12 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of using manifests and checksums is fairly common practice as evidenced by their use in [[ZIP (file format)]], the [[Deb (file format)]], as well as on public FTP sites.

In 2007 the [[California Digital Library]] needed to transfer several terabytes of content (largely [[Web archiving]] data) to the [[Library of Congress]]. The BagIt specification allowed the content to be packaged up in "bags" with package metadata, and a manifest that detailed file checksums, which were later verified on receipt of the bags. The specification was written up as an [[IETF]] draft by [[John Kunze]] in December 2008, where it has seen several revisions before being issued as an RFC.&lt;ref name="rfc" /&gt; In 2009 the [[Library of Congress]] produced a video that describes the specification and the use cases around it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3p3ao_JSfo|title=BagIt: Transferring Digital Content for Preservation|publisher=Library of Congress|date=2009|accessdate=12 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/videos/docs/bagit_video_transcript.pdf|title=BagIt: Transferring Digital Content for Preservation (Transcript)|publisher=Library of Congress|year=2009|accessdate=12 October 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101010013424/http://www.digitalpreservation.gov//videos/docs/bagit_video_transcript.pdf| archivedate= 10 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2018, version 1.0 was published as an RFC by the Internet Engineering Task Force.

'''Brasília''' ({{IPAc-en|b|r|ə|ˈ|z|ɪ|l|j|ə}}; {{IPA-pt|bɾaˈziljɐ|lang}}) is the [[federal capital]] of [[Brazil]] and seat of [[Forms of government|government]] of the [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]]. The city is located atop the [[Brazilian highlands]] in the country's [[Central-West Region, Brazil|center-western]] region. It was founded on April 21, 1960, to serve as the new national capital. Brasília is estimated to be Brazil's [[List of largest cities in Brazil|3rd most populous city]].&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; Among major [[Latin American]] cities, Brasília has the highest [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] per capita at {{BRL|61915}} ({{USD|36175}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urosario.edu.co/urosario_files/9d/9d96f884-d433-45a8-947b-4e9877596f63.pdf ]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Istrate |first=Emilia |url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/global-metro-monitor-3 |title=Global MetroMonitor &amp;#124; Brookings Institution |publisher=Brookings.edu |date= |accessdate=February 25, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6H7Jql2A9?url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/global-metro-monitor-3 |archivedate=June 4, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brasília was [[Planned community|planned]] and developed by [[Lúcio Costa]] and [[Oscar Niemeyer]] in 1956 to move the capital from [[Rio de Janeiro]] to a more central location. The landscape architect was [[Roberto Burle Marx]]. The city's design divides it into numbered blocks as well as sectors for specified activities, such as the Hotel Sector, the Banking Sector and the Embassy Sector. Brasília was chosen as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] due to its [[modernist architecture]] and uniquely artistic urban planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/445|title=World Heritage List|publisher=Unesco|accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been named "City of Design" by [[UNESCO]] in October 2017 and has been part of the [[Creative Cities Network]] since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.unesco.org/new/en/brasilia/about-this-office/single-view/news/the_brazilian_cities_brasilia_paraty_and_joao_pessoa_join |title= The Brazilian cities Brasília, Paraty and João Pessoa join the UNESCO Creative Cities Network |agency= United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |website= www.unesco.org |language=en |access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All three branches of [[federal government of Brazil|Brazil's federal government]] are centered in the city: [[President of Brazil|executive]], [[National Congress of Brazil|legislative]], and [[Supreme Federal Tribunal|judiciary]].

Brasília is the most populous Portuguese-speaking capital city. It was one of the main host cities of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] and hosted some of the football matches during the [[2016 Summer Olympic Games]]; it also hosted the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]].

The city has a unique status in Brazil, as it is an administrative division rather than a legal municipality like other [[List of cities in Brazil|cities in Brazil]]. Although Brasília is used as a synonym for the Federal District through [[synecdoche]], the Federal District is composed of [[List of administrative regions of the Federal District (Brazil)|31 administrative regions]], only one of which is the area of the originally planned city, also called Plano Piloto. The rest of the Federal District is considered by [[IBGE]] to make up Brasília's [[metropolitan area|metro area]].&lt;ref name=pop/&gt;

From 1763 until 1960, [[Rio de Janeiro]] was Brazil's capital. At this time, resources tended to be centered in Brazil's southeast region near Rio de Janeiro and most of its population was concentrated near to the Atlantic Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Epstein|first1=David G.|title=Brasília, Plan and Reality: A Study of Planned and Spontaneous Urban Development|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=nSMrAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=brasilia&amp;dq=brasilia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinmtvOzYzTAhVCzVQKHf8KC3AQ6AEIRjAI|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|accessdate=April 5, 2017|page=26 |language=English|date=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brasília's geographically central location fostered a more regionally neutral federal capital. An article of the country's first [[Brazilian Constitution of 1891|republican constitution]] dating back to 1891 stated the capital should be moved from Rio de Janeiro to a place close to the country's center.

The plan was conceived in 1827 by [[José Bonifácio]], an advisor to Emperor [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]]. He presented a plan to the [[Empire of Brazil#Parliament|General Assembly of Brazil]] for a new city called Brasília, with the idea of moving the capital westward from the heavily populated southeastern corridor. The bill was not enacted because Pedro I dissolved the Assembly.

According to legend, [[Italy|Italian]] saint [[John Bosco|Don Bosco]] in 1883 had a dream in which he described a futuristic city that roughly fitted Brasília's location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.santuariodombosco.org.br/bosco.asp |title=São João Bosco |language=Portuguese |work=Don Bosco Sanctuary website |accessdate=March 8, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130321112351/http://santuariodombosco.org.br/bosco.asp |archivedate=March 21, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Brasília today, many references of Bosco, who founded the [[Salesian]] order, are found throughout the city and one church parish in the city bears his name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brazil-travel-northeast.com/brasilia-brazil.html About Brasilia Brazil] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Costa plan ===

[[File:0741 NOV B 05 Esplanada dos Ministerios Brasilia DF 03 09 1959.jpg|thumb|left|Construction of the [[Monumental Axis|Ministries Esplanade]] in 1959]]

In 1957 an international jury selected [[Lúcio Costa]]'s plan to guide the construction of [[Brazil]]’s new capital, Brasília. Costa's plan was not as detailed as some of the plans presented by other architects and city planners. It did not include land use schedules, models, population charts or mechanical drawings, however, it was chosen by five out of six jurors because it had the features required to align the growth of a capital city&lt;ref name="Brasilia: Plan and Reality"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Epstein|first1=David|title=Brasilia: Plan and Reality : a study of planned and spontaneous urban development|date=1973|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520022033|oclc=691903}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the initial plan was transformed over time, his plan oriented much of the construction and most of its features survived.

Brasília's possession as the new capital and its representation of the conquest of an extensive region in Brazil inspired the symbolism of the plan; Costa, uses a cross-axial design indicating the possession and conquest of this new place with a cross&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite thesis |type=Master of City Planning, 1988|last1=Wong|first1=Pia|title=Planning and the Unplanned Reality: Brasilia|date=October 1989|publisher=University of California, Berkeley, Institute of Urban &amp; Regional Development|series=IURD Working paper series|volume=499 |oclc=21925988}}&lt;/ref&gt; often described by some as a dragonfly, an airplane or a bird.&lt;ref name="Brasilia: Plan and Reality"/&gt; Costa's plan included two principal components, the Monumental Axis (east to west) and the Residential Axis (north to south).

The Monumental Axis designated for political and administrative activities is considered the body of the city with the style and simplicity of its buildings, its oversized scales, broad vistas and heights, producing the idea of Monumentality. This axis includes ministries, the national congress, and the television and radio tower.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The Residential Axis was intended to contain areas with intimate character and is considered the most important achievement of the plan; it was designed for housing and associated functions such as local commerce, schooling, recreations and churches, constituted of 96 {{ill|City block#Superblock|lt=superblocks|pt|superquadra|display=1}} limited to six stories buildings and 12 additional superblocks limited to three stories buildings;&lt;ref name="Brasilia: Plan and Reality"/&gt; Costa's intention with superblocks was to have small self-contained and self-sufficient neighborhoods and uniform buildings with apartments of two or three different categories, where he envisioned the integration of upper and middle classes sharing the same residential area.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The urban design of the communal apartment blocks was based on [[Le Corbusier|Le Corbusier’s]] [[Ville Radieuse]] of 1935 and the superblocks on the [[Radburn design housing|North American Radburn]] layout from 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deckker|first1=Thomas|title=Brasília: Life Beyond Utopia |journal = [[Architectural Design]]|volume = 86|number = 3| issn = 1554-2769 |doi = 10.1002/ad.2050 |pages = 88–95|date=2016|publisher=|quote=Brasília was not, in fact, planned in any meaningful way. The Brazilian architect and planner Lúcio Costa’s entry for the design competition for the new city in 1956 was a series of sketches of ideal urban forms of communal apartment blocks loosely based on Le Corbusier’s Ville Radieuse of 1935, and ‘superblocks’ of single-family houses based on the North American Radburn layout (1929). He subsequently elaborated these into the Plano Piloto (Pilot Plan), and added the satellite city of Taguatinga.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visually, the blocks were intended to appear absorbed by the landscape because they were isolated by a belt of tall trees and lower vegetation. Costa attempted to introduce a Brazil that was more equitable, he also designed housing for the working classes that was separated from the upper and middle-class housing and was visually different, with the intention of avoiding slums (''favelas'') in the urban periphery.&lt;ref name="Brasilia: Plan and Reality"/&gt; The superquadra has been accused of being a space where individuals are oppressed and alienated to a form of spatial segregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editor-last1=el-Dahdah| editor-first1=Farès| title=Lucio Costa: Brasilia’s superquadra| series = CASE| isbn=3791331574| date=2005| publisher=[[Prestel Verlag]]| oclc=491822493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main objectives of the plan was to allow the free flow of automobile traffic, the plan included lanes of traffic in a north-south direction (seven for each direction) for the Monumental Axis and three arterials (the W3, the Eixo and the L2) for the residential Axis;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; the [[cul-de-sac]] access roads of the superblocks were planned to be the end of the main flow of traffic. This emphasis of the plan on automobiles caused the lengthening of distances between centers and it attended only the necessities of a small segment of the population who owned cars.&lt;ref name="Brasilia: Plan and Reality"/&gt;
[[File:Brasília-em-1964.jpg|thumb|Brasília in 1964]]
[[File:Brasilia, Brazil (28252970275).jpg|thumb|Brasília in 1975]]

At the intersection of the Monumental and Residential Axis Costa planned the city center with the transportation center (Rodoviaria), the banking sector and the hotel sector,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; near to the city center, he proposed an amusement center with theatres, cinemas and restaurants. Costa's Plan is seen as a plan with a sectoral tendency, segregating all the banks, the office buildings, and the amusement center.&lt;ref name="Brasilia: Plan and Reality"/&gt;

One of the main features of Costa's Plan was that he presented a new city with its future shape and patterns evident from the beginning. This means that the original plan included paving streets that were not immediately put into use; the advantage of this is that the original plan is hard to undo because he provided for an entire street network, but on the other hand, is difficult to adapt and mold to other circumstances in the future.&lt;ref name="Brasilia: Plan and Reality"/&gt; In addition, there has been controversy with the monumental aspect of Lúcio Costa's Plan, because it appeared to some as city planning of the 19th century and not that of a modern urbanism of the 20th century in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pessôa |first1=José |title=Lúcio Costa and the Question of Monumentality in his Pilot Plan for Brasilia |date=Winter 2010|journal=docomomo Journal |volume=43, ''Brasilia 1960-2010'' |issn=1380-3204 | url=http://www.docomomo.com/shop/node/3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An interesting analysis can be made of Brasília within the context of Cold War politics and the association of Lúcio Costa’s plan to the symbolism of aviation. From an architectural perspective, the airplane-shaped plan was certainly an homage to Le Corbusier and his enchantment with the aircraft as an architectural masterpiece. However, it is important to also note that Brasilia was constructed soon after the end of World War II. Despite Brazil’s minor participation in the conflict, the airplane shape of the city was key in envisioning the country as part of the newly globalized world, together with the victorious Allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Denicke|first1=Lars|editor1-last=Hecht|editor1-first=Gabrielle|encyclopedia=Entangled geographies : empire and technopolitics in the global Cold War|date=2011|oclc=731854048| publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0262515784|pages=185–208|title=Fifty years’ progress in five : Brasilia—modernization, globalism, and the geopolitics of flight}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Brasília is a unique example of modernism both as a guideline for architectural design but also as a principle for organizing society. Modernism in Brasília is explored in James Holston's book, ''[[The Modernist City]]''.

=== Construction ===
[[Juscelino Kubitschek]], [[President of Brazil]] from 1956 to 1961, ordered Brasília's construction, fulfilling the promise of the Constitution and his own political campaign promise. Building Brasília was part of Juscelino's "fifty years of prosperity in five" plan. Already in 1892, the astronomer [[Louis Cruls]], in the service of the Brazilian government, had investigated the site for the future capital. [[Lúcio Costa]] won a contest and was the main urban planner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-20632277|title=Brasilia: Does it work as a city?|first=Robin|last=Banerji|date=December 7, 2012|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1957, with 5550 people competing. [[Oscar Niemeyer]], a close friend, was the chief architect of most public buildings and [[Roberto Burle Marx]] was the [[landscape architecture|landscape designer]]. Brasília was built in 41 months, from 1956 to April 21, 1960, when it was officially inaugurated.

==Geography==
[[File:Vista parcial do Distrito Federal, Brasil.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|Brasília from [[ISS]]]]

The city is located at the top of the [[Brazilian highlands]] in the country's [[Central-West Region, Brazil|center-western]] region. The [[Paranoá Lake]] is a large artificial lake that was built to increase the amount of water available and to maintain region's humidity. It has Brazil's second largest [[marina]], and hosts wakeboarders and [[Windsurfing|windsurfers]]. Diving can also be practiced and one of the main attractions is Vila Amaury, an old village submerged in the lake. This is where the first construction workers of Brasília used to live.

===Climate===

Brasília has a [[tropical savanna climate]] (''Aw'', according to the [[Köppen climate classification]]), with two distinct seasons: the [[rainy season]], from October to April, and a [[dry season]], from May to September.&lt;ref&gt;[https://stat.correioweb.com.br/cbonline/2010_04/50anos/bsb14-2104.pdf A cidade das duas estações] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504132109/https://stat.correioweb.com.br/cbonline/2010_04/50anos/bsb14-2104.pdf |date=May 4, 2012 }} (in Brazilian Portuguese).&lt;/ref&gt; The average temperature is {{convert|21.0|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=INMET/&gt; September, at the end of the dry season, has the highest average maximum temperature, {{convert|28.4|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, has major and minor lower maximum average temperature, of {{convert|25.1|°C|°F|abbr=on}} and {{convert|12.9|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, respectively.&lt;ref name=INMET/&gt; Average temperatures from September through March are a consistent {{convert|22|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=INMET/&gt; With {{convert|241.5|mm|1|abbr=on}}, December is the month with the highest rainfall of the year, while June is the lowest, with only {{convert|4.9|mm|1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=INMET/&gt;

According to the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|2010 IBGE Census]], there were 2,469,489 people residing in Brasília and its metropolitan area,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censo2010.ibge.gov.br/dados_divulgados/index.php?uf=33 2010 IGBE Census] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514145821/http://www.censo2010.ibge.gov.br/dados_divulgados/index.php?uf=33 |date=May 14, 2012 }} {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which 1,239,882 were [[Pardo]] ([[Multiracial#Brazil|multiracial]]) (48.2%), 1,084,418 [[White Brazilian|White]] (42.2%), 198,072 [[Afro-Brazilian|Black]] (7.7%), 41,522 [[Asian Brazilian|Asian]] (1.6%), and 6,128 [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Amerindian]] (0.2%).&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.censo2010.ibge.gov.br/painel/?nivel=mn 2010 IGBE Census] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Brasília was ranked the fourth most-populous city in [[Brazil]] after [[São Paulo]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], and [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticias.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2010/11/04/maiores-cidades-do-brasil-crescem-menos-do-que-resto-do-pais-aponta-censo.jhtm The largest Brazilian cities - 2010 IBGE Census] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the city had 474,871 opposite-sex couples and 1,241 same-sex couples. The population of Brasília was 52.2% [[female]] and 47.8% [[male]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3/&gt;

In the 1960 census there were almost 140,000 residents in the new Federal District. By 1970 this figure had grown to 537,000. By 2000 the population of the [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]] had surpassed 2 million. The city of Brasília proper was planned for only about 500,000 inhabitants, but its metropolitan area has grown past this figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/~augusto_areal/bsb_aug1.htm |title=Population of Brasília |publisher=Geocities.com |date=January 17, 2007 |accessdate=April 17, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/~augusto_areal/bsb_aug1.htm&amp;date=2009-10-26+00:42:12 |archivedate=October 26, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning, the growth of Brasília was greater than original estimates. According to the original plans, Brasília would be a city for government authorities and staff. However, during the construction period, Brazilians from all over the country migrated to Brasília, seeking public and private jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutbrasilia.com/facts/history.html |title=Immigration to Brasília |publisher=Aboutbrasilia.com |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the close of the 20th century, Brasília held the distinction of being the largest city in the world which had not existed at the beginning of the century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://salebatterymart.over-blog.com/article-brasilia-and-asuncion-110994606.html Brasília in the World] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brasília has one of the highest population growth rates in Brazil, with annual growth of 2.82%, mostly due to internal migration.

Brasília's inhabitants include a foreign population of mostly embassy workers as well as large numbers of Brazilian internal migrants. Today, the city has important communities of immigrants and refugees. The city's [[Human Development Index]] was 0.936 in 2000 ([[developed country|developed]] level), and the city's literacy rate was around 95.65%.

The seats of the three branches of the Brazilian state are located in Brasília. Until the 1980s, the Federal Government appointed the Governor of the Federal District, and their laws were issued by the Brazilian Federal Senate. With the Constitution of 1988, the Federal District gained the right to elect its Governor, and a Legislative Chamber was elected to exercise legislative power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aboutbrasilia.com/facts/history.php History of Brasília] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal District does not have a judiciary power. The Judicial Power which serves the Federal District also serves federal territories. Brazil does not have any territories, therefore, for now the courts only serve cases from the Federal District.

==Cityscape==
{{wide image|BSB 02 2013 Eixo Monumental 5884.JPG|800px|align-cap=center|Aerial view of downtown Brasília (Pilot Plan) along the [[Monumental Axis]], especially the new [[Estádio Nacional Mané Garrincha|Mane Garrincha Stadium]] (left), the [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]] and the [[Praça dos Três Poderes|Three Powers Plaza]] (right). The entire residential area of North Wing (''Asa Norte'') is seen in the middle of the image.}}

At the northwestern end of the [[Monumental Axis]] are federal district and municipal buildings, while at the southeastern end, near the middle shore of Lake Paranoá, stand the executive, legislative, and judiciary buildings around the Square of Three Powers, the conceptual heart of the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/77841/Brasilia Brasília] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:BrasiliaBanNacional.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Brazilian Flag]] and the National Congress in spring]]

These and other major structures were designed by Brazilian architect [[Oscar Niemeyer]] in the style of modern Brazilian architecture. In the Square of Three Powers, he created as a focal point the dramatic Congressional Palace, which is composed of five parts: twin administrative towers flanked by a large, white concrete dome (the meeting place of the Senate) and by an equally massive concrete bowl (the [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Chamber of Deputies]]), which is joined to the dome by an underlying, flat-roofed building.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tripbucket.com/dreams/dream/visit-brasilia-brazil-unesco-site/ Brasília, Brazil (UNESCO site)] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Congress also occupies various other surrounding buildings, some connected by tunnels. A series of low-lying annexes (largely hidden) flank both ends.

The National Congress building is located in the middle of the [[Monumental Axis|Eixo Monumental]], the city's main avenue. In front lies a large lawn and reflecting pool. The building faces the [[Praça dos Três Poderes]] where the [[Palácio do Planalto]] and the [[Supreme Federal Court]] are located.

Also in the square are the glass-faced [[Planalto Palace]] housing the presidential offices, and the Palace of the Supreme Court. Farther east, on a triangle of land jutting into the lake, is the Palace of the Dawn (Palácio da Alvorada; the presidential residence). Between the federal and civic buildings on the Monumental Axis is the city's cathedral, considered by many to be Niemeyer's finest achievement (see photographs of the interior). The parabolically shaped structure is characterized by its 16 gracefully curving supports, which join in a circle 115 feet (35 meters) above the floor of the nave; stretched between the supports are translucent walls of tinted glass. The nave is entered via a subterranean passage rather than conventional doorways. Other notable buildings are Buriti Palace, [[Itamaraty Palace]], the National Theater, and several foreign embassies that creatively embody features of their national architecture. The Brazilian landscape architect [[Roberto Burle Marx]] designed landmark modernist gardens for some of the principal buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charlesayoub.com/life-style/index.php/more/1/5157 Brasília] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140507102131/http://www.charlesayoub.com/life-style/index.php/more/1/5157 |date=May 7, 2014 }} {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both low-cost and luxury buildings were built by the government in the Brasília. The residential zones of the inner city are arranged into ''superquadras'' ("superblocks"): groups of apartment buildings inspired in French modernist and bauhaus design and constructed with a prescribed number and type of schools, retail stores, and open spaces. In a not planned spaced in the northern end of Lake Paranoá, separated from the inner city, is a peninsula with many variables homes and a similar city exists on the southern lakeshore. Originally the city planners envisioned extensive public areas along the shores of the [[Reservoir|artificial lake]], but during early development private clubs, hotels, and upscale residences and restaurants gained footholds around the water. Set well apart from the city are [[Satellite town|satellite cities]], including [[Gama, Federal District|Gama]], [[Ceilândia]], [[Taguatinga, Federal District|Taguatinga]], Núcleo Bandeirante, [[Sobradinho, Federal District|Sobradinho]], and [[Planaltina, Federal District|Planaltina]]. These cities, with the exception of Gama and Sobradinho were not planned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conceptical.com/Bras%C3%ADlia Brasília] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140507105401/http://www.conceptical.com/Bras%C3%ADlia |date=May 7, 2014 }} {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monumental civic scale===

[[File:Brasilia_aerea_torredetv1304_4713.jpg|thumb|[[Monumental Axis]] and [[Brasilia TV Tower]]]]
The city has been both acclaimed and criticized for its use of [[modern architecture|modernist architecture]] on a grand scale and for its somewhat [[utopia]]n city plan.&lt;ref name="global.britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/77841/Brasilia|title=Brasília - Britannica {{en icon}}|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a visit to Brasília, the French writer [[Simone de Beauvoir]] complained that all of its ''superquadras'' exuded "the same air of elegant monotony", and other observers have equated the city's large open lawns, plazas, and fields to wastelands. As the city has matured, some of these have gained adornments, and many have been improved by landscaping, giving some observers a sense of "humanized" spaciousness. Although not fully accomplished, the "Brasília utopia" has produced a city of relatively high quality of life, in which the citizens live in forested areas with sporting and leisure structure (the ''superquadras'') flanked by small commercial areas, bookstores and cafés; the city is famous for its cuisine and efficiency of transit.&lt;ref name="global.britannica.com"/&gt;

Even these positive features have sparked controversy, expressed in the nickname "ilha da fantasia" ("fantasy island"), indicating the sharp contrast between the city and surrounding regions, marked by poverty and disorganization in the cities of the states of [[Goiás]] and [[Minas Gerais]], around Brasília.&lt;ref name="global.britannica.com"/&gt;

Critics of Brasília's grand scale have characterized it as a modernist bauhaus platonic fantasy about the future:

{{Quotation|Nothing dates faster than people's fantasies about the future. This is what you get when perfectly decent, intelligent, and talented men start thinking in terms of space rather than place; and single rather than multiple meanings. It's what you get when you design for political aspirations rather than real human needs. You get miles of jerry-built platonic nowhere infested with [[Volkswagen]]s. This, one may fervently hope, is the last experiment of its kind. The utopian buck stops here.|author=[[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]]|title=''[[The Shock of the New]]''|source=Episode 4: "Trouble in Utopia", (1980)}}

===Notable structures===
The [[Cathedral of Brasília]] in the capital of the Federative Republic of Brazil, is an expression of the atheist architect [[Oscar Niemeyer]]. This concrete-framed [[hyperboloid structure]], seems with its glass roof reaching up, open, to the heavens. On May 31, 1970, the Cathedral's structure was finished, and only the {{convert|70|m|2|abbr=on}} diameter of the circular area were visible. Niemeyer's project of Cathedral of Brasília is based in the [[hyperboloid]] of revolution which sections are asymmetric. The hyperboloid structure itself is a result of 16 identical assembled concrete columns. There is controversy as to what these columns, having hyperbolic section and weighing 90 t, represent, some say they are two hands moving upwards to heaven, others associate it to the chalice Jesus used in the last supper and some claim it represent his crown of thorns. The Cathedral was dedicated on May 31, 1970.

==Economy==
{{See also|Economy of Brazil}}
[[File:Brasilia aerea setorbancariosul.jpg|thumb|left|South Banking Sector]]

The major roles of construction and of services (government, communications, banking and finance, food production, entertainment, and legal services) in Brasília's economy reflect the city's status as a governmental rather than an industrial center. Industries connected with construction, food processing, and furnishings are important, as are those associated with publishing, printing, and computer software. GDP is divided in Public Administration 54.8%, Services 28.7%, Industry 10.2%, Commerce 6.1%, Agrobusiness 0.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gdf.df.gov.br/045/04501022.asp |title=GDP – Division – Federal District |publisher=Gdf.df.gov.br |accessdate=April 17, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202195724/http://www.gdf.df.gov.br/045/04501022.asp |archivedate=December 2, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides being the political center, Brasília is an important economic center. Brasília has the highest city gross domestic product (GDP) of 99.5&amp;nbsp;billion reais representing 3.76% of the total Brazilian GDP.
The main economic activity of the federal capital results from its administrative function. Its industrial planning is studied carefully by the Government of the Federal District. Being a city registered by UNESCO, the government in Brasília has opted to encourage the development of non-polluting industries such as software, film, video, and gemology among others, with emphasis on environmental preservation and maintaining ecological balance, preserving the city property.

According to [[Mercer (consulting firm)|Mercer]]'s [[List of most expensive cities for expatriate employees#Mercer surveys|city rankings of cost of living for expatriate employees]], Brasília ranks 45th among the most expensive cities in the world in 2012, up from the 70th position in 2010, ranking behind [[São Paulo]] (12th) and [[Rio de Janeiro]] (13th).

===Services===
[[File:Brasilia Shopping 02.jpg|thumb|right|Shopping center in the city]]
(91% of local GDP, according to the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]]):
* Government – the public sector is by far the largest employer, accounting for around 40% of the city jobs. Government jobs include all levels, from the federal police to diplomacy, from the transportation bureau to the armed forces;
* Communications – the telephony used to be a state monopoly, and Brasília held the HQ of [[Telebrás]], the central state company; one of the enterprises that resulted from the privatization of the system in the 90's, [[Brasil Telecom]], keeps it HQ in the city; the official Postal Service ([[Correios]]) HQ is located in the city as well; as it is the main place of Federal Government news, it is also notable the activities of [[Television channel|TV stations]], including the main offices of four public networks ([[TV Brasil]]/[[Agência Brasil]], [[TV Câmara]], [[TV Senado]] and [[TV Justiça]]), the regional offices of four major private television networks ([[Rede Globo]], [[Sistema Brasileiro de Televisão|SBT]], [[Rede Bandeirantes]] and [[Rede Record]]) and a main affiliate of [[RedeTV!]];
* Banking and finance – headquarters of the [[Banco do Brasil]] and the [[Caixa Econômica Federal]], both controlled by the Federal Government, and the [[List of Brazilian companies|Banco de Brasília]], controlled by the city local government; it is also the site of the headquarters of the [[Central Bank of Brazil|Central Bank]], the main government regulatory agency of the financial sector;
* Entertainment – the shopping malls [[Conjunto Nacional (Brasília)|Conjunto Nacional]], [[The ParkShopping|ParkShopping]], Pátio Brasil Shopping, Brasília Shopping, Boulevard Shopping, Taguatinga Shopping, Terraço Shopping, Gilberto Salomão and Iguatemi Brasília.
* Information technology ([[Politec]], Poliedro, CTIS, among others), and legal services.
* [[Estructural dump]], the main landfill (closed in January 2018)

===Industries===
[[File:Brasilia aerea torredetveixomonumental.jpg|thumb|South Hotel Sector]]

Industries in the city include construction (Paulo Octavio, Via Construções, and Irmãos Gravia among others); food processing (Perdigão, Sadia); furniture making; [[recycling]] (Novo Rio, [[Rexam]], Latasa and others); [[pharmaceuticals]] (União Química); and graphic industries. The main agricultural products produced in the city are [[coffee]], [[guavas]], [[Strawberry|strawberries]], [[orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[lemon]]s, [[papayas]], [[soy beans]], and [[mangoes]]. It has over 110,000 cows and it exports wood products worldwide.

The [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]], where Brasília is located, has a GDP of R$133,4 billion (about US$64.1 billion), about the same as Belarus according to [[The Economist]]. Its share of the total Brazilian GDP is about 3.8%.&lt;ref name=GDF&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/content/compare-cabana |title=Comparing Brazilian states with countries |publisher=Economist.com |date=September 5, 2011 |accessdate=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal District has the largest [[Gross domestic product|GDP per capita]] income of Brazil US$25,062, slightly higher than Belarus.&lt;ref name=GDF/&gt;

The city's planned design included specific areas for almost everything, including [[Hotel|accommodation]], Hotels Sectors North and South. New hotel facilities are being developed elsewhere, such as the hotels and tourism Sector North, located on the shores of [[Lake Paranoá]]. Brasília has a range of tourist accommodation from inns, pensions and hostels to larger international chain hotels. The city's restaurants cater to a wide range of foods from local and regional Brazilian dishes to international cuisine.

==Culture==
{{See also|Culture of Brazil}}
[[File:Complexo Cultural interior.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Cultural Complex of the Republic]]]]

As a venue for political events, music performances and movie festivals, Brasília is a cosmopolitan city, with around 124 [[embassies]], a wide range of restaurants and complete infrastructure ready to host any kind of event. Not surprisingly, the city stands out as an important business/tourism destination, which is an important part of the local economy, with dozens of hotels spread around the federal capital. Traditional parties take place throughout the year.

In June, large festivals known as "[[festa junina|festas juninas]]" are held celebrating [[List of Catholic saints|Catholic saints]] such as [[Saint Anthony of Padua]], [[Saint John the Baptist]], and [[Saint Peter]]. On September 7, the traditional [[Brazilian Independence Day|Independence Day]] parade is held on the Ministries Esplanade. Throughout the year, local, national, and international events are held throughout the city. [[Christmas]] is widely celebrated, and [[New Year's Eve]] usually hosts major events celebrated in the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nichecreator.com/Brasilia Brasília] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140507063453/http://nichecreator.com/Brasilia |date=May 7, 2014 }} {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city also hosts a varied assortment of art works from artists like [[Bruno Giorgi]], Alfredo Ceschiatti, [[Athos Bulcão]], Marianne Peretti, [[Alfredo Volpi]], [[Emiliano Di Cavalcanti|Di Cavalcanti]], Dyllan Taxman, [[Victor Brecheret]] and [[Burle Marx]], whose works have been integrated into the city's architecture, making it a unique landscape. The cuisine in the city is very diverse. Many of the best restaurants in the city can be found in the Asa Sul district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.travelbite.co.uk/destinations/city-guide/guides/what-do/what-do-in-brasilia-$447179.htm |title=Culture in Brasília |publisher=Travelbite.co.uk |date=August 9, 2006 |accessdate=April 17, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220141939/http://www.travelbite.co.uk/destinations/city-guide/guides/what-do/what-do-in-brasilia-%24447179.htm |archivedate=December 20, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is also the birthplace of Brazilian rock and place of origin of many bands like: [[Legião Urbana]], [[Capital Inicial]], [[Aborto Elétrico]], [[Plebe Rude]] and [[Raimundos]]. Currently Brasília has the Rock Basement Festival which attempts to bring new bands to the national scene. The festival is held in the parking [[Estádio Nacional Mané Garrincha|Brasilia National Stadium Mané Garrincha]].

Since 1965, the annual Brasília Festival of Brazilian Cinema is one of the most traditional cinema festivals in Brazil, being compared only to the Brazilian Cinema Festival of Gramado, in Rio Grande do Sul. The difference between both is that the festival in Brasília still preserves the tradition to only submit and reward Brazilian movies.

The International Dance Seminar in Brasília has brought top-notch dance to the Federal Capital since 1991. International teachers, shows with choreographers and guest groups and scholarships abroad are some of the hallmarks of the event. The Seminar is the central axis of the DANCE BRAZIL program and is promoted by the DF State Department of Culture in partnership with the Cultural Association Claudio Santoro. [http://www.seminario.dancebrasil.art.br/]

Brasília has also been the focus of modern-day literature. Published in 2008, ''The World In Grey: Dom Bosco's Prophecy'', by author Ryan J. Lucero, tells an apocalyptical story based on the famous prophecy from the late 19th century by the Italian saint [[John Bosco|Don Bosco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infobrasilia.com.br/bsb_h1p.htm |title=Dom Bosco – Brasília |publisher=Infobrasilia.com.br |date=April 21, 1965 |accessdate=April 17, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412115640/http://www.infobrasilia.com.br/bsb_h1p.htm |archivedate=April 12, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Don Bosco's prophecy:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/ginasant/3383018251/ |title=Dom Bosco – Brasília |publisher=Flickr.com |date=March 24, 2009 |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Between parallels [[15th parallel south|15]] and [[20th parallel south|20]], around a lake which shall be formed; A great civilization will thrive, and that will be the Promised Land". Brasília lies between the parallels 15° S and 20° S, where an artificial lake ([[Lake Paranoá|Paranoá Lake]]) was formed. Don Bosco is Brasília's [[patron saint]].

''[[American Flagg!]]'', the [[First Comics]] comic book series created by [[Howard Chaykin]], portrays Brasília as a cosmopolitan world capital of culture and exotic romance. In the series, it is a top vacation and party destination. The 2015 [[Rede Globo]] series ''[[Felizes para Sempre?]]'' was set in Brasília.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/cultura/revista-da-tv/maria-fernanda-candido-enrique-diaz-gravam-com-fernando-meirelles-nova-serie-da-globo-em-brasilia-14750029|title=Maria Fernanda Cândido e Enrique Diaz gravam com Fernando Meirelles nova série da Globo, em Brasilia|author=Natália Castro|date=December 8, 2014|publisher=Revista da TV|work=[[O Globo]]|accessdate=December 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Monumental Axis and Square of the Three Powers
[[File:Praça dos Três Poderes em Brasília.jpg|thumb|[[Praça dos Três Poderes]] (Three Powers Plaza)]]

At the end of the ''[[Monumental Axis|Eixo Monumental]]'' ("Monumental Axis") lies the ''Esplanada dos Ministérios'' ("Ministries Esplanade"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutbrasilia.com/maps/esplanada-ministerios.php|title=Esplanada dos Ministérios - map - Brasilia|website=www.aboutbrasilia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; an open area in downtown Brasília. The rectangular lawn is surrounded by two eight-lane avenues where many government buildings, monuments and memorials are located. On Sundays and holidays, the Eixo Monumental is closed to cars so that locals may use it as a place to walk, bike, and have picnics under the trees.

''[[Praça dos Três Poderes]]'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for ''Square of the Three Powers'') is a plaza in Brasília. The name is derived from the encounter of the three federal branches around the plaza: the Executive, represented by the [[Palácio do Planalto]] (presidential office); the Legislative, represented by the [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]] (Congresso Nacional); and the Judiciary branch, represented by the [[Supreme Federal Court (Brazil)|Supreme Federal Court]] (Supremo Tribunal Federal). It is a tourist attraction in Brasília, designed by [[Lúcio Costa]] and [[Oscar Niemeyer]] as a place where the three branches would meet harmoniously.

;Palaces 
[[File:Palacio Alvorada commons.jpg|thumb|The [[Palácio da Alvorada]]]]
[[File:Planalto panorama.jpg|thumb|The [[Palácio do Planalto]]]]

The [[Palácio da Alvorada]] is the official residence of the [[president of Brazil]]. The palace was designed, along with the rest of the city of Brasília, by [[Oscar Niemeyer]] and inaugurated in 1958. One of the first structures built in the republic's new capital city, the "Alvorada" lies on a peninsula at the margins of [[Lake Paranoá]]. The principles of simplicity and modernity, that in the past characterized the great works of architecture, motivated Niemeyer. The viewer has an impression of looking at a glass box, softly landed on the ground with the support of thin external columns. The building has an area of 7,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with three floors consisting of the basement, landing, and second floor. The auditorium, kitchen, laundry, medical center, and administration offices are at basement level. The rooms used by the presidency for official receptions are on the landing. The second floor has four suites, two apartments, and various private rooms which make up the residential part of the palace. The building also has a library, a heated Olympic-sized swimming pool, a music room, two dining rooms and various meeting rooms. A chapel and heliport are in adjacent buildings.

The [[Palácio do Planalto]] is the official workplace of the [[president of Brazil]]. It is located at the [[Praça dos Três Poderes]] in Brasília. As the [[Politics of Brazil|seat of government]], the term "Planalto" is often used as a [[metonym]] for the executive branch of government. The main working office of the President of the Republic is in the Palácio do Planalto. The President and his or her family do not live in it, rather in the official residence, the [[Palácio da Alvorada]]. Besides the President, senior advisors also have offices in the "Planalto", including the [[Vice-President of Brazil]] and the [[Chief of Staff of Brazil|Chief of Staff]]. The other Ministries are along the [[Monumental Axis|Esplanada dos Ministérios]]. The architect of the Palácio do Planalto was [[Oscar Niemeyer]], creator of most of the important buildings in Brasília. The idea was to project an image of simplicity and modernity using fine lines and waves to compose the columns and exterior structures. The Palace is four stories high, and has an area of 36,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Four other adjacent buildings are also part of the complex.

It is the third busiest [[Brazil]]ian airport based on passengers and aircraft movements.&lt;ref name="pax"/&gt; Because of its strategic location it is a civil aviation hub for the rest of the country.

This makes for a large number of takeoffs and landings and it is not unusual for flights to be delayed in the holding pattern before landing. Following the airport's master plan, [[Infraero]] built a second runway, which was finished in 2006. In 2007, the airport handled 11,119,872 passengers.&lt;ref name="pax"&gt;Airport Statistics for 2007 http://www.infraero.gov.br/upload/arquivos/movi/mov.operac.1207.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The main building's third floor, with 12 thousand square meters, has a panoramic deck, a food court, shops, four movie theatres with total capacity of 500 people, and space for exhibitions. Brasília Airport has 136 vendor spaces. The airport is located about {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the central area of Brasília, outside the metro system. The area outside the airport's main gate is lined with taxis as well as several bus line services that connect the airport to Brasília's central district. The parking lot accommodates 1,200 cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutbrasilia.com/travel/airport.html |title=Brasilia International Airport – facts |publisher=Aboutbrasilia.com |date=January 4, 2007 |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The airport is serviced by domestic and regional airlines (TAM, GOL, Azul, WebJET, Trip and Avianca), in addition to a number of international carriers. In 2012, Brasília's International Airport was won by the InfrAmerica consortium, formed by the Brazilian engineering company ENGEVIX and the Argentine Corporacion America holding company, with a 50% stake each.&lt;ref&gt;[http://export.gov/brazil/build/groups/public/@eg_br/documents/webcontent/eg_br_063331.pdf Brazilian Airport Privatization – Second Round Concessions] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140507044503/http://export.gov/brazil/build/groups/public/@eg_br/documents/webcontent/eg_br_063331.pdf |date=May 7, 2014 }} {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 25-year concession, the airport may be expanded to up to 40 million passengers a year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304311204579506002107709102 Brazil Opens First Expansion at a Privately Operated Airport] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314043812/http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304311204579506002107709102 |date=March 14, 2016 }} {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the airport received 15 new boarding bridges, totaling 28 in all. This was the main requirement made by the federal government, which transferred the operation of the terminal to the Inframerica Group after an auction. The group invested R$750 million in the project. In the same year, the number of [[parking]] spaces doubled, reaching three thousand. The airport's entrance have a new rooftop cover and a new access road. Furthermore, a [[VIP room]] was created on Terminal 1's third floor. The investments resulted an increase the capacity of Brasília's airport from approximately 15 million passengers per year to 21 million by 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copa2014.gov.br/en/noticia/inframerica-group-will-invest-r-750-million-brasilias-airport-world-cup Inframerica Group will invest R$ 750 million in Brasilia's Airport] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brasília has direct flights to all [[states of Brazil]] and direct [[international flight]]s to [[Atlanta]], [[Buenos Aires]], [[Lisbon]], [[Miami]], [[Panama City]], and [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bsb.aero/en/cias-aereas/ International flights - Brasília International Airport] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like most Brazilian cities, Brasília has a good network of taxi companies. Taxis from the airport are available immediately outside the terminal, but at times there can be quite a queue of people. Although the airport is not far from the downtown area, taxi prices do seem to be higher than in other Brazilian cities. Booking in advance can be advantageous, particularly if time is limited, and local companies should be able to assist airport transfer or transport requirements.

The [[Juscelino Kubitschek bridge]], also known as the 'President JK Bridge' or the 'JK Bridge', crosses [[Lake Paranoá]] in Brasília. It is named after [[Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira]], former [[president of Brazil]]. It was designed by architect [[Alexandre Chan]] and [[structural engineer]] Mário Vila Verde. Chan won the [[Gustav Lindenthal]] Medal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eswp.com/bridge/awards.htm |title=Bridge Awards |publisher=Eswp.com |accessdate=May 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717071219/http://www.eswp.com/bridge/awards.htm |archivedate=July 17, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for this project at the 2003 International Bridge Conference in [[Pittsburgh]] due to "...outstanding achievement demonstrating harmony with the environment, aesthetic merit and successful community participation".

It consists of three {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall asymmetrical steel arches that crisscross diagonally. With a length of 1,200&amp;nbsp;m (0.75 miles), it was completed in 2002 at a cost of US$56.8&amp;nbsp;million. The bridge has a pedestrian walkway and is accessible to bicyclists and skaters.

===Metro===
[[File:Metro DF Galeria.jpg|thumb|[[Brasília Metro]]]]
The [[Brasília Metro]] is Brasília's underground [[rapid transit|metro system]]. The system has 24 stations on two lines, the Orange and Green lines, along a total network of {{convert|42|km|mi|abbr=on}}, covering some of the metropolitan area. Both lines begin at the Central Station and run parallel until the Águas Claras Station. The Brasília metro is not comprehensive so buses may provide better access to the center.

The metro leaves the Rodoviária (bus station) and goes south, avoiding most of the political and tourist areas. The main purpose of the metro is to serve cities, such as Samambaia, [[Taguatinga, Federal District|Taguatinga]] and [[Ceilândia]], as well as Guará and Águas Claras. The satellite cities served are more populated in total than the Plano Piloto itself (the census of 2000 indicated that [[Ceilândia]] had 344,039 inhabitants, Taguatinga had 243,575, and the Plano Piloto had approximately 400,000 inhabitants), and most residents of the satellite cities depend on public transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.df.gov.br/ |title=Brasília Metro |publisher=Metro.df.gov.br |date= |accessdate=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[High-speed rail in Brazil|high-speed railway]] was planned between Brasília and Goiânia, the capital of the state of Goias, but it will probably be turned into a regional service linking the capital cities and cities in between, like Anápolis and Alexânia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fábio Amato Do G1, em Brasília |url=http://g1.globo.com/distrito-federal/noticia/2012/06/estudo-vai-apontar-viabilidade-de-trem-entre-brasilia-anapolis-e-goiania.html |title=G1 - Estudo vai apontar viabilidade de trem entre Brasília, Anápolis e Goiânia - notícias em Distrito Federal |publisher=G1.globo.com |date=June 28, 2012 |accessdate=March 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buses===
[[File:Rodoviária do Plano Piloto.jpg|thumb|Central Bus Station]]

The main bus hub in Brasília is the Central Bus Station, located in the crossing of the [[Monumental Axis|Eixo Monumental]] and the Eixão, about {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the Three Powers Plaza. The original plan was to have a bus station as near as possible to every corner of Brasília. Today, the bus station is the hub of urban buses only, some running within Brasília and others connecting Brasília to the satellite cities.

In the original city plan, the interstate buses should also stop at the Central Station. Because of the growth of Brasília (and corresponding growth in the bus fleet), today the interstate buses leave from the older interstate station (called Rodoferroviária), located at the western end of the Eixo Monumental. The Central Bus Station also contains a main metro station. A new bus station was opened in July 2010. It is on Saída Sul (South Exit) near Parkshopping Mall and with its metro station, and it's also an inter-state bus station, used only to leave the Federal District.

===Brasília Public Transportation Statistics===
The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Brasília, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 96 min. 31% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 28 min, while 61% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is {{convert|15.1|km|abbr=on}}, while 50% travel for over {{convert|12|km|abbr=on}} in a single direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://moovitapp.com/insights/en/Moovit_Insights_Public_Transit_Index_Brazil_Brasilia-1702|title=Brasília Public Transportation Statistics|publisher=Global Public Transit Index by Moovit|accessdate=June 19, 2017}} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50x50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [[creativecommons:by/4.0/|Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==

[[File:Brasilia Stadium - June 2013.jpg|thumb|left|[[Estádio Nacional Mané Garrincha|Estádio Nacional de Brasília]]]]

The main stadiums are the [[Estádio Nacional Mané Garrincha|Brasília National Stadium Mané Garrincha]] (which was reinaugurated on May 18, 2013), the [[Serejão|Serejão Stadium]] (home for Brasiliense) and the [[Bezerrão|Bezerrão Stadium]] (home for Gama).

Brasília was one of the host cities of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] and [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]], for which [[Brazil]] is the host nation. Brasília hosted the opening of the Confederations Cup and hosted 7 World Cup games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copa2014.gov.br/en/arena/brasilia |title=Brasilia National Stadium |publisher=Government of Brazil |accessdate=March 18, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905002247/http://www.copa2014.gov.br/en/arena/brasilia |archivedate=September 5, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brasília also hosted the football tournaments during the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] held in [[Rio de Janeiro]].

[[File:Ginásio Nilson Nelson - Brasilia - DSC00168.JPG|thumb|right|[[Nilson Nelson Gymnasium]]]]
Brasília is known as a departing point for the practice of unpowered [[air sports]], sports that may be practiced with [[hang gliding]] or paragliding wings. Practitioners of such sports reveal that, because of the city's dry weather, the city offers strong thermal winds and great "[[cloud street|cloud-streets]]", which is also the name for a manoeuvre quite appreciated by practitioners. In 2003, Brasília hosted the 14th Hang Gliding World Championship, one of the categories of free flying. In August 2005, the city hosted the 2nd stage of the Brazilian Hang Gliding Championship.

Brasília is the site of the [[Autódromo Internacional Nelson Piquet (Brasília)|Autódromo Internacional Nelson Piquet]] which hosted a non-championship round of the [[1974 Formula One season|1974 Formula One Grand Prix season]]. An [[IndyCar]] race was cancelled at the last minute in 2015.

The city is also home to Uniceub BRB, one of Brazil's best basketball clubs. Currently, [[Novo Basquete Brasil|NBB]] champion (2010, 2011 and 2012). The club hosts some of its games at the 16,000 all-seat [[Nilson Nelson Gymnasium]].

[[File:CaricaturePB.jpg|right|thumb|Cover of the 2002 paperback edition of ''Caricature'']]
'''''Caricature''''' is a book collection of nine [[Comics|comic]] [[Short story|short stories]] by [[Daniel Clowes]]. In contrast to earlier Clowes collections such as ''Lout Rampage!'' and ''Orgy Bound'', ''Caricature'' concentrates on the more naturalistic, character-focused side of Clowes's output displayed in ''[[Ghost World]]''. It includes some of his most admired short stories, including "Immortal, Invisible", "Gynecology" and the title story. All the material in the collection originally appeared in Clowes's [[comic book]] ''[[Eightball (comic book)|Eightball]]'' with the exception of "Green Eyeliner", which was published in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]''.

''Caricature'' was first published by [[Fantagraphics Books]] in 1998 in a deluxe [[hardcover]] edition. A less expensive [[paperback]] version was released in 2002. Both editions contain a mixture of [[Color printing|full-color]] and [[black-and-white]] material.

'''Concurrent powers''' are powers a [[federalism|federal system of government]] shared by both the federal government and each constituent political unit (such as a state or province).  These powers may be exercised simultaneously within the same territory, in relation to the same body of citizens, and regarding the same subject-matter.&lt;ref name=Scardino&gt;Scardino, Frank.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=MLhxnmmtivwC&amp;pg=PA31 The Complete Idiot's Guide to U.S. Government and Politics]'', p. 31 (Penguin 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  Concurrent powers are contrasted with [[reserved powers]] (not possessed by the federal government) and with [[exclusive federal powers]] (possession by the states is forbidden or requires federal permission).&lt;ref name=Scardino /&gt;  

Federal law is supreme, and therefore it may preempt to a state or provincial law in case of conflict.  Concurrent powers can therefore be divided into two kinds: those not generally subject to federal preemption (like the power to tax private citizens); and, other concurrent powers.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, Joseph.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=kGi7BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA78 The Initiative, Second Edition: Citizen Lawmaking], p. 78 (SUNY Press, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the United States, examples of the concurrent powers shared by both the federal and state governments include the power to tax, build roads, establish bankruptcy laws, and to create lower courts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110621215344/http://claremont.org/repository/doclib/Encyclopedia%20Amer%20Const%20Arts.pdf The Encyclopedia of the America Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14572">'''Credible fear''' is a concept in United States asylum law whereby a person who demonstrates that he or she has a credible fear of returning to his or her home country cannot be subject to deportation from the United States until the person's asylum case is processed.

==Historical context==

Historically, the deportation of a person not lawfully present in the United States required the approval of an Immigration Judge, unless it was based on an apprehension at the border itself. In November 2002, in order to speed up the process of deportation, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] expanded the scope of [[expedited removal]] to include those apprehended within 100 miles of the United States border and within 14 days of entry. 

To address concerns that this might result in the deportation of people who might be eligible for asylum, the credible fear screening was introduced.&lt;ref name=humanrightsfirst/&gt; According to the  [[Congressional Research Service]], "Consistent time series data on 'credible fear' claims" was only collected beginning in fiscal year 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Ellen Wasem, [https://www.ilw.com/immigrationdaily/news/2011,0426-crs.pdf Asylum and "Credible Fear" Issues in U.S. Immigration Policy], [[Congressional Research Service]] (April 6, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal description of credible fear==

===Summary===

The legal framework governing credible fear is described in the [[Code of Federal Regulations]], Title 8 (Aliens and Nationality), 208.30 (8 CFR 208.30).&lt;ref name=fulltext/&gt; According to the summary on the [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] (USCIS) website: "An individual will be found to have a credible fear of persecution if he or she establishes that there is a “significant possibility” that he or she could establish in a full hearing before an Immigration Judge that he or she has been persecuted or has a well-founded fear of persecution or harm on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion if returned to his or her country."&lt;ref name=uscis-faq/&gt;

===Types of credible fear===

There are two kinds of credible fear recognized in United States law:&lt;ref name=fulltext&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/8/208.30|title = 8 CFR 208.30 - Credible fear determinations involving stowaways and applicants for admission found inadmissible pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(C) or 212(a)(7) of the Act.|publisher = [[Legal Information Institute]]|accessdate = May 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=uscis-faq&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/faq-page/credible-fear-faq|title = Credible Fear FAQ|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|accessdate = May 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Credible fear of persecution''': This is defined in Section 235(b)(1)(B)(v) of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952|Immigration and Nationality Act]] as "a significant possibility, taking into account the credibility of the statements made by the alien in support of his or her claim and such other facts as are known to the officer, that the alien could establish eligibility for asylum under Section 208 [of the INA]." Note that demonstrating a credible fear of persecution does not mean that the person has received asylum or definitively established eligibility for it. It simply means that the person stands a good chance of establishing eligibility for asylum.
* '''Credible fear of torture''': The applicant must demonstrate "a significant possibility that he or she is eligible for withholding of removal or deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture, pursuant to 8 CFR 208.16 or 208.17."

==Process==

===Initial contact===

When a person enters the United States without authorization, [[United States Customs and Border Protection]] are, at initial contact, supposed to ask the person whether he or she has a credible fear of returning to his or her home country. If the person responds affirmatively, then the person cannot be immediately deported, but instead the person is referred to an asylum officer for a credible fear interview and issued a Form M-444 '''Information About Credible Fear Interview '''.&lt;ref name=uscis-faq/&gt;&lt;ref name=ipc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/special-reports/mexican-and-central-american-asylum-and-credible-fear-claims-background-and-context|title = Mexican and Central American Asylum and Credible Fear Claims: Background and Context|date = May 21, 2014|accessdate = May 23, 2015|publisher = [[Immigration Policy Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the person responds negatively, the person may be subject to [[expedited removal]].&lt;ref name=ipc/&gt;

A person who has not yet come into contact with immigration enforcement (either because he or she is already present in the United States in lawful status, or because immigration enforcement hasn't yet found the person) may also apply for asylum of his or her own accord (this is sometimes called applying for asylum affirmatively). Such a person does not need to go through a credible fear interview. The credible fear interview is intended only for individuals who have been identified as candidates for deportation.&lt;ref name=humanrightsfirst&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/sites/default/files/Key-Findings-Asylum-US-Mexico-Border.pdf|title = Key Statistics and Findings on Asylum Protection at the U.S.-Mexico Border|date = June 1, 2014|accessdate = June 3, 2015|publisher = Human Rights First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Credible fear interview===

After initial contact, the person claiming credible fear needs to be given at least 48 hours before a credible fear interview with an asylum officer, unless he or she voluntarily waives the 48-hour waiting period requirement. In practice, due to a huge backlog of cases, the person may need to wait several days before he or she gets an interview.&lt;ref name=uscis-faq/&gt;

The credible fear interview is conducted by an asylum officer from the [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] (USCIS) Asylum Division. The goal of a credible fear interview is not to make a final determination regarding whether the applicant should be granted asylum, but rather, to determine whether the applicant has a reasonable ''prima facie'' case that makes it plausible that he or she could be granted asylum. According to the USCIS website: "An individual will be found to have a credible fear of persecution if he or she establishes that there is a “significant possibility” that he or she could establish in a full hearing before an Immigration Judge that he or she has been persecuted or has a well-founded fear of persecution or harm on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion if returned to his or her country."&lt;ref name=uscis-faq/&gt;

The interview includes questions in the following domains:

* '''Background information''' including the applicant's birthdate, home country, and whether the person has any family ties in the United States.
* '''Credible fear of persecution''' questions: Questions related to persecution the applicant faced in his or her home country, including questions that probe whether the person's persecution is on account of criteria, such as ethnicity, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a [[particular social group]], that would be grounds for asylum.
* '''Credible fear of torture''' questions: Questions related to whether the applicant was tortured in his or her home country.
* Questions probing disqualifying criteria for asylum: The officer asks questions related to whether the applicant has tortured or persecuted others. Affirmative answers to these could disqualify the applicant.
* Opportunity for the applicant to add any more information.

In the credible fear interview, the burden of proof to demonstrate credible fear is on the applicant. There is no presumption in favor of credible fear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://immigration-law.freeadvice.com/immigration-law/asylum/credible_fear_interview.htm|title = What is a "credible fear interview" with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection?|publisher = Immigration Law Free Advice|accessdate = May 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The transcript of the credible fear interview is part of the applicant's asylum file and may be used by an Immigration Judge later when deciding whether to grant the applicant asylum.&lt;ref name=humanrightsfirst/&gt;

Due to manpower and resource constraints faced by the USCIS, over 60% of credible fear interviews are conducted telephonically.&lt;ref name=humanrightsfirst/&gt;

===Procedure after the credible fear interview===

If the officer issues an unfavorable determination of credible fear to the applicant, the applicant may continue to be detained and may be deported for violation of immigration law.

If the officer issues a favorable determination of credible fear, then the applicant goes through regular [[removal proceedings]]. Specifically, the officer issues a Notice To Appear (NTA) to the applicant, directing the applicant to appear for his or her removal case in an immigration court, during which the applicant needs to make the case for asylum in full detail to the immigration judge. The applicant is now handled by [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE). After ICE files the NTA with the court, a removal hearing is held before an immigration judge.&lt;ref name=ipc/&gt; The applicant may have to wait for several months for a hearing due to the huge backlog of cases.

Applicants may wait for their hearing while detained or on parole. [[Immigrations and Customs Enforcement]] has the following guidelines regarding parole for people with a favorable determination of credible fear, who are waiting for asylum hearings:

* For arriving aliens (these are people who were apprehended while crossing the border): Effective January 2010, individuals with favorable credible fear determinations who can prove their identity and are not flight risks and do not pose a danger to the community, may be paroled from detention. They may also be paroled for urgent humanitarian or significant public interest reasons. Immigration judges do not have jurisdiction to review ICE’s parole decisions.&lt;ref name=ipc/&gt;&lt;ref name=ice-parole&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ice.gov/doclib/dro/pdf/11002.1-hd-parole_of_arriving_aliens_found_credible_fear.pdf|title = Parole of Arriving Aliens Found to Have a Credible Fear of Persecution or Torture|date = December 8, 2009|accessdate = May 23, 2015|publisher = [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ice.gov/factsheets/credible-fear|title = Revised Parole Policy for Arriving Aliens with Credible Fear Claims|date = December 16, 2009|accessdate = May 23, 2015|publisher = [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Those who are subject to expedited removal but are not arriving aliens may ask an immigration judge to set a bond for their release.&lt;ref name=ipc/&gt;

==Critical response==

===Criticism of CBP for not following procedure asking people if they have a credible fear===

CBP has come under criticism for not asking people if they have a credible fear, and not referring people for a credible fear interview even when they had a good ''prima facie'' chance of passing one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/us-custom-sand-border-protection-kicking-out-refugees-284433|title = Is U.S. Customs and Border Protection Kicking Out Refugees?|last = Bekiempis|first = Victoria|date = November 15, 2014|accessdate = May 23, 2015|publisher = ''[[NewsWeek]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report by the [[Immigration Policy Center]] cited a number of attorneys as saying their clients were given misinformation by CBP about the credible fear process, with some even told that the US does not grant asylum to people from [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name=ipc/&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] has similarly claimed to find that CBP's initial contact does not follow procedural guidelines, and that it was failing to flag for a credible fear interview many individuals who were seeking asylum.&lt;ref name=hrw&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/es/node/129878/section/6|title = III. Expedited Removal, Reinstatement of Removal, and Screening for Credible Fear|date = October 16, 2014|accessdate = May 23, 2015|publisher = [[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of credible fear interviewers===

Credible fear interviews have come under criticism on the following counts:

* That the officers expect the applicants to be familiar with legal jargon such as the concept of [[particular social group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/8/6/5971003/artesia-immigrants-detention-due-process-families-lawyers-asylum-court-border|title = 9 ways detaining immigrant families is turning into a "shitshow" |last = Lind|first = Dara|publisher = ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]''|date = August 6, 2014|accessdate = May 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lesson plan released in February 2014 for USCIS Asylum Office Directors and Asylum Officers was criticized as raising the bar unnecessarily high for the credible fear interview.&lt;ref name=hrw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.squarespace.com/static/50b1609de4b054abacd5ab6c/t/53558353e4b02071f74ee3c4/1398113107754/Re%20sponse%20to%20USCIS%20Credible%20Fear%20Memo,%20Bill%20Hing,%2004.21.2014.pdf|title = Response to USCIS Credible Fear Memo|last = Hing|first = Bill|date = April 21, 2014|accessdate = May 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* That many credible fear interviews (over 60%) are conducted telephonically, with the applicant being interviewed in cramped and stressful conditions, and with translators also available only by telephone, making it hard to communicate clearly.&lt;ref name=humanrightsfirst/&gt;

===Criticism of the long wait times and continued detention===

[[Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE), the agency responsible for detaining people, has been criticized for inconsistent and unnecessary detention of asylum applicants after a favorable credible fear determination has been found, and the continued detention of people while they wait for their hearings has been said to contribute to their [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name=ipc/&gt;

USCIS has also been criticized for long average wait times between the credible fear interview and the asylum case hearing. The average wait time, according to a 2014 report, was 578 days.&lt;ref name=humanrightsfirst/&gt;

'''Egyptology Scotland''' was formed on December 12, 2000 with the objective of promoting [[Egyptology]], the study and understanding of [[Ancient Egypt]], in [[Scotland]]. The society holds an annual lecture series, mainly at the [[Kelvingrove Museum]] in [[Glasgow]] and the [[Augustine United Church]] in Edinburgh, and occasionally elsewhere.

The society's motto is a quote from the ancient Egyptian wisdom text [[The Maxims of Ptahhotep|'The Instruction of Ptahhotep']]. It translates as 'Speaking to the future is good - it will listen.'

Egyptology Scotland's annual lecture programme aims to provide members with access to the latest developments in the field of Egyptology and events include group visits, members’ nights and hieroglyph workshops etc. Many notable Egyptologists have spoken to the society over the years.

Egyptology Scotland is the first individual Egyptology society in Scotland although the society is not the first to explore the world of ancient Egypt in Scotland. In 1906, the British School of Archaeology of Egypt, based in [[University College London]] established the Egyptian Research Students’ Association. Branches were set up in several cities including in Glasgow and Edinburgh. ‘Lantern lectures’ and ‘demonstrations’ were given and the branches survived on an irregular basis into the 1920s.

The '''''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture''''' (abbreviation: ''EIEC'') is an [[encyclopedia]] of [[Indo-European studies]] and the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]]. The encyclopedia was edited by [[J. P. Mallory]] and [[Douglas Q. Adams]] and published in 1997 by [[Fitzroy Dearborn]]. Archaeological articles are written by Mallory, linguistic articles are written by Adams, and includes a distinguished ''Who's Who'' of 1990s Indo-Europeanists who made contributions as sub-editors. While not a [[polemic]], the work in part responds to [[Colin Renfrew, Baron Renfrew of Kaimsthorn|Colin Renfrew's]] [[Anatolian hypothesis]] of [[Proto-Indo-European Urheimat hypotheses|Indo-European origins]].

'''''Essays in Radical Empiricism''''' ('''''ERE''''') by [[William James]] is a collection edited and published posthumously by his colleague and biographer [[Ralph Barton Perry]] in 1912.  It was assembled from ten out of a collection of twelve reprinted journal articles published from 1904–1905 which James had deposited in August, 1906, at the [[Harvard University Library]] and the Harvard Department of Philosophy for supplemental use by his students. Perry replaced two essays from the original list with two others, one of which didn't exist at the earlier time.

Because ERE is a collection of essays written over a period of time, and ultimately not selected or collated by their author, it is not a systematic exposition of his thought&lt;ref&gt;ERE Harvard critical edition, p. xi&lt;/ref&gt; even though Perry suggests otherwise in his preface.  This circumstance, in addition to the evolution of James own philosophic stance, has contributed to a wide variance in understanding, misunderstanding, and critical opinion of radical empiricism.

==History==

===Unpublished 1906 collection===
This is the original collection of articles deposited by James (as bound by Harvard about 1912), with dates of journal publication:&lt;ref&gt;ERE Harvard critical edition, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;
#"Does Consciousness Exist?" (September 1904)
#"La Notion de Conscience" (French language, June, 1905)
#"A World of Pure Experience" (Sept–October, 1904)
#"The Pragmatic Method" (December, 1904)
#"The Thing and Its Relations" (January, 1905)
#"The Essence of Humanism" (March, 1905)
#"How Two Minds Can Know One Thing" (March, 1905)
#"Is Radical Empiricism Solipsistic?" (April, 1905)
#"The Place of Affectional Facts in a World of Pure Experience" (May, 1905)
#"The Experience of Activity" (January, 1905)
#"Humanism and Truth" (October, 1904)
#"Humanism and Truth Once More" (April, 1905)

===James' 1907 list===
In mid-1907 James composed a list of 15 essays for an anticipated book titled "Essays in Radical Empiricism".&lt;ref&gt;ERE Harvard critical edition, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the essays in the 1906 collection are not present on this list. "The Pragmatic Method" had been adapted as chapter three for James' book ''Pragmatism''. "Humanism and Truth Once More" was combined with "Humanism and Truth" in the 1909 book ''The Meaning of Truth'' (MT).

James' plans for a book on radical empiricism based on this list never came to fruition.  ''Pragmatism'' was published in June 1907 and was well received.  In the spring of 1909 James began to assemble material for a follow-up book called ''The Meaning of Truth''.  His 1907 list fell victim to the needs of the immediate book. The two strikeout lines were made by James on his actual list. The notes to the right of the titles have been added to clarify how the essays were later used.

#"The Function of Cognition" (1885) → MT
#"The Knowing of Things Together" (1895) → extracted "The Tigers in India" → MT
#"Does Consciousness Exist?"
#"A World of Pure Experience" → extracted "The Relation Between Knower and Known" → MT
#"La Notion de Conscience"
#"The Essence of Humanism" → MT
#"How Two Minds Can Know One Thing"
#"Is Radical Empiricism Solipsistic?
#"The Place of Affectional Facts in a World of Pure Experience"
#"Humanism and Truth" → plus excerpt of "Humanism and Truth Once More" → MT
#&lt;s&gt;"The Thing and Its Relations"&lt;/s&gt; published 1909 as Appendix A, ''A Pluralistic Universe'' (PLU)
#"Controversy About Truth" (1907)
#"One Word More About Truth" (1907) → MT
#"Pratt On Truth" (1907) → MT
#&lt;s&gt;"The Experience of Activity"&lt;/s&gt; published 1909 as Appendix B, PLU

===Perry's 1912 book===
After James' death, Ralph Perry thought it appropriate to assemble a book on radical empiricism, and mined the earlier lists to come up with this one:

#"Does Consciousness Exist?"
#"A World of Pure Experience"
#"The Thing and Its Relations"
#"How Two Minds Can Know One Thing"
#"The Place of Affectional Facts in a World of Pure Experience"
#"The Experience of Activity"
#"The Essence of Humanism"
#"La Notion de Conscience"
#"Is Radical Empiricism Solipsistic?
#"Mr. Pitkin's Refutation of Radical Empiricism" (1906, Perry addition)
##"A Reply to Mr. Pitkin" (1907)
#"Humanism and Truth Once More"
#"Absolutism and Empiricism" (1884, Perry addition)

Harvard added one more article, "Controversy About Truth", from James' 1907 list to its 1976 critical edition.

'''The Great Plains Population and Environment Data Series'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/PLAINS/]&lt;/ref&gt; is a study that was assembled by an interdisciplinary research team led by Myron Gutmann of the [[National Science Foundation]] and the [[University of Michigan]] between 1995 and 2004, as part of a research project funded by the [[National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nichd.nih.gov/]&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the project was to amass information about approximately 500 counties in 12 states of the [[Great Plains]] of the United States, and then to analyze those data in order to understand the relationships between population and environment that existed between the years of about 1870 and 2000.

The project team includes historians, sociologists, anthropologists, and demographers at the University of Michigan, [[Colorado State University]], and the [[University of Saskatchewan]], with consultants at other universities.

==Great Plains Population and Environment Data: Agricultural Data, 1870-1997 (United States)==
The agricultural data distributed here are all data about counties. The data falls into four broad categories: about the counties, about agriculture, about demographic and social conditions, and about the environment. The information about counties (name, area, identification code, and whether the project classified the county as part of the Great Plains in a given year) is embedded in each of the other data files, so that there will be three series of data (agriculture, demographic and social conditions, and environment), containing individual data files for each year for which data are available. The United States Census of Agriculture has been conducted since 1850 on a regular schedule that was decennial until 1920, and more frequently thereafter (every five years from 1925 to 1950, then in 1954, 1959, 1964, 1978, and every five years since 1982). The agricultural data included in this collection consist of a single data file for each agricultural census year between 1870 and 1997 that includes selected material compiled as part of the United States Agricultural Census. The county-level agricultural data produced by the United States government as part of the census constitute a consistent series of measures of changing agriculture and land use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/DSDR/studies/4254?q=great+plains+study&amp;archive=DSDR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Great Plains Population and Environment Data: Social and Demographic Data, 1870-2000 (United States)==
The social and [[demographic data]] included in The Great Plains Population and Environment Data Series consist of a single data file for each decennial year between 1870 and 2000, covering 10 of the 12 Great Plains states. Information on a variety of social and demographic topics was gathered to historically characterize populations living in counties within the United States Great Plains, in terms of: (1) [[Urban area|urban]], [[rural]], and total population, (2) vital statistics, (3) net [[Human migration|migration]], (4) age and sex, (5) [[wikt:nativity|nativity]] and [[ancestry]], (6) education and literacy, (7) religion, (8) [[industry]], and (9) housing and other characteristics. These data include selected material compiled as part of the United States population census. The United States Census of Population and Housing has been conducted since 1790 on a regular schedule that is [[decennial]]. The county-level social and demographic data produced by the United States government as a result constitute a consistent series of measures capturing changes in the United States population's size, composition, and other characteristics. A subset of the variables available from the short and long-form survey questionnaires of the United States Census of Population and Housing (as compiled for counties) was extracted from previously existing digital files. In addition to information from the decennial census of the population, county-level data were drawn from an assortment of existing digital files as well as sources that were manually digitized. Other data include compilations of county-level information gathered from various federal agencies and private organizations as well as the agriculture and economic censuses. Supplementing these compilations are manually digitized consumer market data, religious data, and vital statistics, including information about births, deaths, marriage, and divorce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/DSDR/studies/4296?q=great+plains&amp;archive=DSDR]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harm reduction''', or '''harm minimization''', is a range of [[public health]] policies designed to lessen the negative social and/or physical consequences associated with various human behaviors, both legal and illegal. Harm reduction policies are used to manage behaviors such as [[recreational drug use]] and [[sexual activity]] in numerous settings that range from services through to geographical regions. Critics of harm reduction typically believe that tolerating risky or illegal behaviour sends a message to the community that such behaviours are acceptable and that some of the actions proposed by proponents of harm reduction do not reduce harm over the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.incb.org/pdf/e/ar/2001/incb_report_2001_3_oceania.pdf |title=INCB 2001 Annual Report - Oceania |accessdate=2010-03-28 |page=559 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125183254/http://incb.org/pdf/e/ar/2001/incb_report_2001_3_oceania.pdf |archivedate=2010-11-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-17571220.html |title=Anger as Vice Girls Get Free Condoms |accessdate=2010-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Needle-exchange programmes reduce the likelihood of users of [[heroin]] and other drugs sharing the syringes and using them more than once. Syringe-sharing can lead to infections such as [[HIV]] or [[hepatitis C]], which can spread from user to user through the reuse of syringes contaminated with infected blood. [[Needle and syringe programme]] (NSP) and [[Opioid Substitution Therapy]] (OST) outlets in some settings offer basic primary health care. [[Supervised injection sites]] are legally sanctioned, medically supervised facilities designed to address public nuisance associated with drug use and provide a hygienic and stress-free environment for drug consumers. The facilities provide sterile injection equipment, information about drugs and basic health care, treatment referrals, and access to medical staff.

Opioid replacement therapy (ORT), or opioid substitution therapy (OST), is the [[medical]] procedure of replacing an illegal [[opioid]], such as [[heroin]], with a longer acting but less euphoric opioid; [[methadone]] or [[buprenorphine]] are typically used and the drug is taken under medical supervision. Another approach is Heroin assisted treatment, in which medical prescriptions for pharmaceutical heroin (diacetylmorphine) are provided to heroin-dependent people. [[Toronto]]'s [[Seaton House]] became the first homeless shelter in Canada to operate a "wet shelter" on a "[[managed alcohol program|managed alcohol]]" principle in which clients are served a glass of wine once an hour unless staff determine that they are too inebriated to continue. Previously, homeless alcoholics opted to stay on the streets often seeking alcohol from unsafe sources such as mouthwash, rubbing alcohol or industrial products which, in turn, resulted in frequent use of emergency medical facilities.

A high amount of media coverage exists informing users of the dangers of [[drunk driving|driving drunk]]. Most alcohol users are now aware of these dangers and safe ride techniques like '[[designated driver]]s' and free taxicab programmes are reducing the number of drunk-driving accidents. Many schools now provide [[safer sex]] education to teen and pre-teen students, who may engage in sexual activity. Since some adolescents are going to have sex, a harm-reductionist approach supports a sexual education which emphasizes the use of protective devices like [[condoms]] and [[dental dam]]s to protect against unwanted pregnancy and the transmission of [[sexually transmitted infections|STI]]s. Since 1999 some countries have legalized prostitution, such as [[Prostitution in Germany|Germany]] (2002) and [[Prostitution in New Zealand|New Zealand]] (2003).

Many street-level harm-reduction strategies have succeeded in reducing HIV transmission in [[injecting drug user]]s and sex-workers.&lt;ref name="pmid16360791"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rekart ML |title=Sex-work harm reduction |journal=Lancet |volume=366 |issue=9503 |pages=2123–34 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16360791 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67732-X |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(05)67732-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; HIV education, HIV testing, condom use, and safer-sex negotiation greatly decreases the risk to the disease.&lt;ref name="pmid16360791"/&gt;

In the case of [[recreational drug use]], harm reduction is put forward as a useful perspective alongside the more conventional approaches of [[Demand reduction|demand]] and [[supply reduction]].&lt;ref name="marlatt"&gt;{{cite book |last=Marlatt |first=G. Alan |title=Harm Reduction: Pragmatic Strategies for Managing High-Risk Behaviors |chapter=Highlights of Harm Reduction |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=n-XmJZ5cvnwC&amp;pg=PA3 |year=2002 |publisher=Guilford Press |page=3 |isbn=978-1-57230-825-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many advocates argue that prohibitionist laws criminalise people for suffering from a disease and cause harm; for example, by obliging drug addicts to obtain drugs of unknown purity from unreliable criminal sources at high prices, thereby increasing the risk of [[overdose]] and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=James A. |last1=Inciardi |first2=Lana D. |last2=Harrison |year=2000 |title=Harm reduction: national and international perspectives |location=Thousand Oaks, California |publisher=SAGE |pages=vii–viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website [[Erowid]].org collects and publishes information and first-hand experience reports about all kinds of drugs to educate (potential) drug users.

While the vast majority of harm reduction initiatives are educational campaigns or facilities that aim to reduce drug-related harm, a unique social enterprise was launched in Denmark in September 2013 to reduce the financial burden of illicit drug use for people with a drug dependence. Michael Lodberg Olsen, who was previously involved with the establishment of a drug consumption facility in Denmark, announced the founding of the ''Illegal'' magazine that will be sold by drug users in [[Copenhagen]] and the district of Vesterbro, who will be able to direct the profits from sales towards drug procurement. Olsen explained: "No one has solved the problem of drug addiction, so is it not better that people find the money to buy their drugs this way than through crime and prostitution?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dane launches street magazine to help drug users fund their habit|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/08/danish-drug-addicts-magazine|accessdate=6 November 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 September 2013|author=Daniel Boffey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Needle exchange programmes ===
[[File:800px-Caernarfon womens toilets.jpg|thumb|A [[Wastebin|bin]] allowing for safe disposal of [[syringe|needle]]s in a [[washroom|public toilet]] in [[Caernarfon]], [[Wales]].]]
{{Main|Needle-exchange programme}}
The use of some illicit drugs can involve hypodermic needles. In some areas (notably in many parts of the US), these are available solely by prescription. Where availability is limited, users of heroin and other drugs frequently share the syringes and use them more than once. As a result, infections such as [[HIV]] or [[hepatitis C]] can spread from user to user through the reuse of syringes contaminated with infected blood. The principles of harm reduction propose that syringes should be easily available or at least available through a needle and syringe programmes (NSP). Where syringes are provided in sufficient quantities, rates of HIV are much lower than in places where supply is restricted. In many countries users are supplied equipment free of charge, others require payment or an exchange of dirty needles for clean ones, hence the name.

A 2010 review found insufficient evidence that NSP prevents transmission of the hepatitis C virus, tentative evidence that it prevents transmission of HIV and sufficient evidence that it reduces self-reported injecting risk behaviour.&lt;ref name="pmid20219055"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Palmateer N, Kimber J, Hickman M, Hutchinson S, Rhodes T, Goldberg D |title=Evidence for the effectiveness of sterile injecting equipment provision in preventing hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus transmission among injecting drug users: a review of reviews |journal=Addiction |volume=105 |issue=5 |pages=844–59 |date=May 2010 |pmid=20219055 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02888.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown in the many evaluations of needle-exchange programmes that in areas where clean syringes are more available, illegal drug use is no higher than in other areas. Needle exchange programmes have reduced HIV incidence by 33% in [[New Haven]] and 70% in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="pmid11251723"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Harm reduction theories and strategies for control of human immunodeficiency virus: a review of the literature |journal=J Adv Nurs |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=357–70 |date=February 2001 |pmid=11251723 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2648.2001.01672.x |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0309-2402&amp;date=2001&amp;volume=33&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=363 |author1=Hilton BA |author2=Thompson R |author3=Moore-Dempsey L |author4=Janzen RG |name-list-format=vanc }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Melbourne, Australia inner-city suburbs of Richmond and Abbotsford are locations in which the use and dealing of heroin has been concentrated for a protracted time period. Research organisation the Burnet Institute completed the 2013 'North Richmond Public Injecting Impact Study' in collaboration with the Yarra Drug and Health Forum, City of Yarra and North Richmond Community Health Centre and recommended 24-hour access to sterile injecting equipment due to the ongoing "widespread, frequent and highly visible" nature of illicit drug use in the areas. During the period between 2010 and 2012 a four-fold increase in the levels of inappropriately discarded injecting equipment was documented for the two suburbs. In the local government area the City of Yarra, of which Richmond and Abbotsford are parts of, 1550 syringes were collected each month from public syringe disposal bins in 2012. Furthermore, ambulance callouts for heroin overdoses were 1.5 times higher than for other Melbourne areas in the period between 2011 and 2012 (a total of 336 overdoses), and drug-related arrests in North Richmond were also three times higher than the state average. The Burnet Institute's researchers interviewed health workers, residents and local traders, in addition to observing the drug scene in the most frequented North Richmond public injecting locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Syringe machine push for addicts in Melbourne's heroin hot spots|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/syringe-machine-push-for-addicts-in-melbournes-heroin-hot-spots/story-e6frg6n6-1226646482548|accessdate=20 May 2013|newspaper=The Australian|date=20 May 2013|author=Lucie Van Den Berg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 May 2013, the Burnet Institute stated in the media that it recommends 24-hour access to sterile injecting equipment in the Melbourne suburb of Footscray after the area's drug culture continues to grow after more than ten years of intense law enforcement efforts. The Institute's research concluded that public injecting behaviour is frequent in the area and inappropriately discarding injecting paraphernalia has been found in carparks, parks, footpaths and drives. Furthermore, people who inject drugs have broken open syringe disposal bins to reuse discarded injecting equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Drug experts propose needle vending machines for Footscray|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/west/drug-experts-propose-needle-vending-machines-for-footscray/comments-fngnvmj7-1226651497633|accessdate=29 May 2013|newspaper=Herald Sun Maribyrnong Leader|date=28 May 2013|author=Bridie Byrne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British public body, the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE), introduced a new recommendation in early April 2014 due to an increase in the presentation of the number of young people who inject steroids at UK needle exchanges. NICE previously published needle exchange guidelines in 2009, in which needle and syringe services are not advised for people under the age of 18 years, but the organisation's director Professor Mike Kelly explained that a "completely different group" of people were presenting at programs. In the updated guidance, NICE recommended the provision of specialist services for "rapidly increasing numbers of steroid users", and that needles should be provided to people under the age of 18—a first for NICE—following reports of 15-year-old steroid injectors seeking to develop their muscles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NICE: Needle exchanges should supply safe equipment to under-18 steroid users|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/nice-needle-exchanges-should-supply-safe-equipment-to-under18-steroid-users-9247087.html|accessdate=9 April 2014|newspaper=The Independent|date=9 April 2014|author=Charlie Cooper|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Targeted and low-threshold primary health care outlet ===
{{Main|Targeted and low-threshold primary health care outlet}}
NSP and Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST) outlets in some settings offer basic primary health care. These are known as 'targeted primary health care outlet'- as these outlets primarily target people who inject drugs and/or 'low-threshold health care outlet'- as these reduce common barriers clients often face when they try to access health care from the conventional health care outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Islam, MM, Topp, L, Day, CA, Dawson, A and Conigrave, KM |title=The accessibility, acceptability, health impact and cost implications of primary healthcare outlets that target injecting drug users: A narrative synthesis of literature |journal=International Journal of Drug Policy |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=94–102 |year=2012 |pmid=21996165 |url=http://www.ijdp.org/article/S0955-3959(11)00159-9/abstract |doi=10.1016/j.drugpo.2011.08.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Islam, MM, Topp, L, Day, CA, Dawson, A and Conigrave, KM |title=Primary healthcare outlets that target injecting drug users: Opportunity to make services accessible and acceptable to the target group |journal=International Journal of Drug Policy |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=109–110 |year=2012 |pmid=22280917 |doi=10.1016/j.drugpo.2011.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; For accessing sterile injecting equipment clients frequently visit NSP outlets, and for receiving pharmacotherapy (e.g. methadone, buprenorphine)they visit OST clinics; these frequent visits are used opportunistically to offer much needed health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Islam, MM, Reid, SE, White, A, Grummett, S, Conigrave, KM and Haber, PS |title=Opportunistic and continuing health care for injecting drug users from a nurse-run needle syringe program-based primary health-care clinic |journal=Drug Alcohol Rev |volume=31 |pages=114–115 |year=2012 |pmid=22145983 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1465-3362.2011.00390.x/pdf |doi=10.1111/j.1465-3362.2011.00390.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Islam, MM |title=Needle Syringe Program-Based Primary Health Care Centers: Advantages and Disadvantages |journal=Journal of Primary Care &amp; Community Health |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=100–103 |year=2010 |url=http://jpc.sagepub.com/content/1/2/100.abstract |doi=10.1177/2150131910369684}}&lt;/ref&gt; These targeted outlets have the potential to mitigate clients' perceived barriers to access to healthcare delivered in traditional settings.

[[File:Who needs a virtual world?.jpg|thumb|Injection kit obtained from a needle-exchange programme.]]
{{Main|Supervised injection site}}
''Supervised injection sites'' (SIS), or ''Drug consumption rooms'' (DCR), are legally sanctioned, medically supervised facilities designed to address public nuisance associated with drug use and provide a hygienic and stress-free environment for drug consumers.

The facilities provide sterile injection equipment, information about drugs and basic health care, treatment referrals, and access to medical staff. Some offer counseling, hygienic and other services of use to itinerant and impoverished individuals. Most programmes prohibit the sale or purchase of illegal drugs. Many require identification cards. Some restrict access to local residents and apply other admission criteria, such as they have to be injection drug users, but generally in Europe they don't exclude addicts who consume by other means.

The Netherlands had the first staffed injection room, although they did not operate under explicit legal support until 1996. Instead, the first center where it was legal to inject drug was in Berne, Switzerland, opened 1986. In 1994, Germany opened its first site.

The [[European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction]]'s latest [[systematic review]] from April 2010 did not find any evidence to support concerns that DCR might "encourage drug use, delay treatment entry or aggravate problems of local drug markets."&lt;ref name="emcdda-dcr" /&gt; Jürgen Rehm and Benedikt Fischer explained that while evidence show that DCR are successful, that "interpretation is limited by the weak designs applied in many evaluations, often represented by the lack of adequate control groups." Concluding that this "leaves the door open for alternative interpretations of data produced and subsequent ideological debate."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|EMCDDA|2010}} {{cite web|url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_101267_EN_emcdda-harm%20red-mon-ch4-web.pdf|title=Chapter 4: Perspectives on harm reduction — what experts have to say|format=PDF|vauthors=Rehm J, etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EMCDDA review noted that research into the effects of the facilities "faces methodological challenges in taking account of the effects of broader local policy or ecological changes", still they concluded "that the facilities reach their target population and provide immediate improvements through better hygiene and safety conditions for injectors." Further that the facilitates "does not increase levels of drug use or risky patterns of consumption, nor does it result in higher rates of local drug acquisition crime." While its usage is "associated with self-reported reductions in injecting risk behaviour such as syringe sharing, and in public drug use" and "with increased uptake of [[Drug detoxification|detoxification]] and [[Drug rehabilitation|treatment services]]."&lt;ref name="emcdda-dcr" /&gt; However, "a lack of studies, as well as methodological problems such as isolating the effect from other interventions or low coverage of the risk population, evidence regarding DCRs — while encouraging — is insufficient for drawing conclusions with regard to their effectiveness in reducing [[HIV]] or [[hepatitis C]] virus (HCV) incidence." Concluding with that "there is suggestive evidence from modelling studies that they may contribute to reducing drug-related deaths at a city level where coverage is adequate, the review-level evidence of this effect is still insufficient."&lt;ref name="emcdda-dcr" /&gt;

In the United States, efforts to open up Supervised Injection Sites (SIS, also called Safe Injection Sites) are now underway, although the legality of SIS is still questionable and very controversial. Currently, federal law does not explicitly define whether SIS are legal or not, which leaves the issue of legality open to interpretation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beletsky|first=Leo|last2=Davis|first2=Corey S.|last3=Anderson|first3=Evan|last4=Burris|first4=Scott|date=February 2008|title=The Law (and Politics) of Safe Injection Facilities in the United States|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=98|issue=2|pages=231–237|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2006.103747|issn=0090-0036|pmc=2376869|pmid=18172151|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although still a gray area, some clauses of the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA) may threaten the very core of its existence.  Section 856 of the CSA states that:&lt;blockquote&gt;“It shall be unlawful to… manage or control any place… and knowingly and intentionally… make available for use… the place for the purpose of unlawfully manufacturing, storing, distributing, or using a controlled substance”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/856|title=21 U.S. Code § 856 - Maintaining drug-involved premises|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Currently, there are no official, state-sanctioned Supervised Injection Sites operating in the United States, but many cities are working on gaining approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-supervised-injection-sites-20170624-story.html|title=Safe injections centers are not opium dens|date=2017-06-24|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-10-26|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2017, a bill was introduced in favor of legalizing Safe Injection Sites in California.  In the bill, Assemblywoman Susan Eggman sought for the authorization of these facilities, otherwise known as "drug consumption programs", in various cities/ counties across California, including Los Angeles and San Francisco. Although the bill passed through the Assembly and various committees, it failed by 2 votes on the Senate Floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB186|title=Bill Text  - AB-186 Controlled substances: safer drug consumption program.|website=leginfo.legislature.ca.gov|access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Washington, similar efforts were made to open up these facilities in Seattle and King County,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/crime/seattle-king-county-move-to-create-2-injection-sites-for-drug-users/|title=Seattle, King County move to open nation’s first supervised injection sites for drug users|date=2017-01-27|work=The Seattle Times|access-date=2017-10-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; but were also met with strong opposition.  In January 2017, Senator Mark Miloscia proposed a bill to essentially ban Supervised Injection Sites in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=5223&amp;Year=2017|title=Washington State Legislature|website=app.leg.wa.gov|access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite political resistance through failed legislation, there still persists a strong movement across major U.S. cities to legalize these sites.

Existing laws and their vagueness hinder efforts toward legalizing SIS in the United States. For instance, the CSA deems drug possession and management of areas utilized for drug consumption illegal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With the legality of SIS in question, facilities offering similar and/or underground services operate in the United States.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2016/03/11/are-state-sanctioned-heroin-shooting-galleries-a-good-idea|title=Are State-Sanctioned Heroin Shooting Galleries a Good Idea?|website=www.pewtrusts.org|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-drugs-safety/underground-safe-haven-keeps-drug-users-off-street-may-save-lives-idUSKBN1AP207|title=Underground safe haven keeps drug users off street, may save lives|last=|first=|date=2017-08-09|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Boston, the Supportive Place for Observation and Treatment (SPOT) program does not allow drug use on site, but practices harm reduction strategies.

While legislative efforts have been made to legalize and implement SIS for harm reduction, it remains a controversial issue and has been met with protests and petitions from the opposition.

Many of these efforts have been part of larger harm reduction programs focused on reducing prescription opiate and heroin abuse.  As part of their evaluation, San Francisco considered the healthcare impact on its citizens, such as lives saved, hospital stays, and cases of HIV and hepatitis C.  They concluded that SIS would potentially decrease these factors annually.  The city also conducted surveys and focus groups to gather opinion from residents and business owners on these facilities.  Over half of survey respondents and focus group participants supported SIS.  Benefits such as reductions in drug usage, drug overdoses, and spread of disease were identified, in addition to concerns including non-usage of SIS and increased crime in the neighborhood.  A cost-benefit analysis of a supervised injection site there has been completed and suggests that one SIS could result in savings of $3.5 million U.S. dollars annually, primarily due to lower medical costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cohen|first1=Ronnie|title=Supervised injection site for addicts could save San Francisco money, lives|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-addiction-safety/supervised-injection-site-for-addicts-could-save-san-francisco-money-lives-idUSKBN14M10X|accessdate=30 October 2017|agency=Reuters|date=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Elsewhere, harm reduction coalitions, academic public health researchers, nonprofit organizations, and professional medical societies have made contributions to understanding the roles of these facilities in harm reduction.

Opioid replacement therapy (ORT), or opioid substitution therapy (OST), is the [[medical]] procedure of replacing an illegal [[opioid]], such as [[heroin]], with a longer acting but less euphoric opioid; [[methadone]] or [[buprenorphine]] are typically used and the drug is taken under medical supervision.&lt;ref name="NEPOD Report"&gt;Richard P.

In some countries, such as Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia, patients may be treated with slow-release morphine when methadone is deemed inappropriate due to the individual's circumstances. In Germany, [[dihydrocodeine]] has been used [[Off-label use|off-label]] in ORT for many years, however it is no longer frequently prescribed for this purpose. Extended-release dihydrocodeine is again in current use in Austria for this reason.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Research into the usefulness of [[piritramide]], extended-release [[hydromorphone]] (including polymer implants lasting up to 90 days), [[dihydroetorphine]] and other drugs for ORT is at various stages in a number of countries.&lt;ref name="NEPOD Report"/&gt;

The driving principle behind ORT is the program's capacity to facilitate a resumption of stability in the user's life, while they experience reduced symptoms of [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms and less intense [[Craving (withdrawal)|drug cravings]]; however, a strong euphoric effect is not experienced as a result of the treatment drug.&lt;ref name="NEPOD Report"/&gt; In some countries (not the USA, UK, Canada, or Australia),&lt;ref name="NEPOD Report"/&gt; regulations enforce a limited time period for people on ORT programs that conclude when a stable economic and psychosocial situation is achieved. (Patients suffering from [[HIV|HIV/AIDS]] or [[Hepatitis C]] are usually excluded from this requirement.) In practice, 40-65% of patients maintain complete abstinence from opioids while receiving opioid replacement therapy, and 70-95% are able to reduce their use significantly, while experiencing a concurrent elimination or reduction in medical (improper [[diluent]]s, non-[[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]] injecting equipment), psychosocial ([[mental health]], relationships), and legal ([[arrest]] and [[imprisonment]]) issues that can arise from the use of illicit opioids.&lt;ref name="NEPOD Report"/&gt;

Providing medical prescriptions for pharmaceutical heroin (diacetylmorphine) to heroin-dependent people has been employed in some countries to address problems associated with the illicit use of the drug, as potential benefits exist for the individual and broader society. Evidence has indicated that this form of treatment can greatly improve the health and social circumstances of participants, while also reducing costs incurred by criminalisation, incarceration and health interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/37/1/parlbus/commbus/senate/Com-e/ille-e/presentation-e/ucht-e.htm |title=Background |work=Heroin Assisted Treatment for Opiate Addicts – The Swiss Experience |first=Ambros |last=Uchtenhagen |date=February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Haasen C, Verthein U, Degkwitz P, Berger J, Krausz M, Naber D |title=Heroin-assisted treatment for opioid dependence: randomised controlled trial |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=191 |issue= |pages=55–62 |date=July 2007 |pmid=17602126 |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.106.026112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Switzerland, [[heroin assisted treatment]] is an established programme of the national health system. Several dozen centres exist throughout the country and heroin-dependent people can administer heroin in a controlled environment at these locations. The Swiss heroin maintenance programme is generally regarded as a successful and valuable component of the country's overall approach to minimising the harms caused by illicit drug use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/37/1/parlbus/commbus/senate/Com-e/ille-e/presentation-e/ucht-e.htm |title=Epidemiology |work=Heroin Assisted Treatment for Opiate Addicts – The Swiss Experience |first=Ambros |last=Uchtenhagen |date=February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2008 [[Swiss referendum, November 2008#Revision of the federal statute on narcotics|national referendum]], a majority of 68 per cent voted in favour of continuing the Swiss programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swiss to agree heroin scheme but say no to dope|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/archive/Swiss_to_agree_heroin_scheme_but_say_no_to_dope.html?cid=7071120|work=Swissinfo.ch|publisher=Swiss Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=21 May 2013|author=Urs Geiser|date=30 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A heroin maintenance programme has existed in the United Kingdom (UK) since the 1920s, as drug addiction was seen as an individual health problem. Addiction to opiates was rare in the 1920s and was mostly limited to either middle-class people who had easy access due to their profession, or people who had become addicted as a side effect of medical treatment. In the 1950s and 1960s a small number of doctors contributed to an alarming increase in the number of drug-addicted people in the U.K. through excessive prescribing—the U.K. switched to more restrictive drug legislation as a result.&lt;ref name="rachel"&gt;[http://www.drugtext.org/library/articles/92333.html Rachel Lart BRITISH MEDICAL PERCEPTION FROM ROLLESTON TO BRAIN, CHANGING IMAGES OF THE ADDICT AND ADDICTION] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610141829/http://www.drugtext.org/library/articles/92333.html |date=June 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the British government is again moving towards a consideration of heroin prescription as a legitimate component of the National Health Service (NHS). Evidence has clearly shown that methadone maintenance is not appropriate for all opioid-dependent people and that heroin is a viable maintenance drug that has shown equal or better rates of success.&lt;ref&gt;Access a British report on heroin maintenance entitled [http://www.jrf.org.uk/knowledge/findings/socialpolicy/943.asp Prescribing Heroin: what is the evidence?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209071303/http://www.jrf.org.uk/knowledge/findings/socialpolicy/943.asp |date=2006-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A committee appointed by the Norwegian government completed an evaluation of research reports on heroin maintenance treatment that were available internationally. In 2011 the committee concluded that the presence of numerous uncertainties and knowledge gaps regarding the effects of heroin treatment meant that it could not recommend the introduction of heroin maintenance treatment in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forskningsradet.no/no/Nyheter/_For_svakt_grunnlag/1253968771212?WT.ac=forside_nyhet Norges forskningsråd:For svakt grunnlag,01.09.2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first, and only, North American [[heroin maintenance]] project is being run in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia|B.C.]] and [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]. Currently, over 80 long-term [[heroin]] addicts who have not been helped by available treatment options are taking part in the [[North American Opiate Medication Initiative]] (NAOMI) trials. However, critics have alleged that the control group gets unsustainably low doses of methadone, making them prone to fail and thus rigging the results in favor of heroin maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=1780152 |title=Why we object to NAOMI: Heroin maintenance in Canada | pmid=16812955 |year=2006 |last1=Kahan |first1=M |last2=Srivastava |first2=A |last3=Shen |first3=K |volume=52 |pages=705–6, 709–11 |journal=Canadian Family Physician |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of heroin maintenance programmes object to the high costs of providing heroin to users. The British heroin study cost the British government £15,000 per participant per year, roughly equivalent to average heroin user's expense of £15,600 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.actiononaddiction.org.uk/news_and_campaigns/news/160_untreatable-or-just-hard-to-treat |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808085211/http://www.actiononaddiction.org.uk/news_and_campaigns/news/160_untreatable-or-just-hard-to-treat |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-08-08 |title=Treatable or Just Hard to Treat? |accessdate=2011-01-08 }} 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Drug Free Australia&lt;ref name="DrugFreeAustralia"&gt;Drug Free Australia {{cite web |url=http://www.drugfree.org.au/fileadmin/Media/Global/Taskforce_Arguments_for_Prohibition.pdf |title=Arguments for Prohibition |accessdate=2010-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706124952/http://www.drugfree.org.au/fileadmin/Media/Global/Taskforce_Arguments_for_Prohibition.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}p 3&lt;/ref&gt; contrast these ongoing maintenance costs with Sweden's investment in, and commitment to, a drug-free society where a policy of compulsory rehabilitation of drug addicts is integral, which has yielded the one of the lowest reported illicit drug use levels in the developed world,&lt;ref&gt;UNODC {{cite web |url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/WDR-2000.html |title= World Drug Report 2000 |accessdate=2010-05-04}} 2001 pp 162-165 (see aggregated average for each OECD country in Harm Reduction Discussion page).&lt;/ref&gt; a model in which successfully rehabilitated users present no further maintenance costs to their community, as well as reduced ongoing health care costs.&lt;ref name="DrugFreeAustralia" /&gt;

===Naloxone distribution===
[[Naloxone]] is a drug used to counter an [[overdose]] from the effect of [[opioid]]s; for example, a [[heroin]] or [[morphine]] overdose. Simply put, naloxone displaces the opioid molecules from the brain's receptors and reverses the [[respiratory depression]] caused by an overdose within two to eight minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Get Started|url=http://naloxoneinfo.org/get-started/about-naloxone|work=Open Society Foundations|publisher=Open Society Foundations|accessdate=17 March 2014|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) includes naloxone on their "[[WHO Model List of Essential Medicines|List of Essential Medicines]]", and recommends its availability and utilization for the reversal of opioid overdoses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treatment of opioid dependence|url=http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/activities/treatment_opioid_dependence/en/|work=World Health Organization|publisher=WHO|accessdate=17 March 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drug use prevention, treatment and care|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/drug-prevention-and-treatment/index.html|work=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|publisher=UNODC|accessdate=17 March 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formal programs in which the opioid [[inverse agonist]] drug naloxone is distributed have been trialled and implemented. Established programs distribute naloxone, as per WHO's minimum standards, to drug users and their peers, family members, police, prisons, and others. These treatment programs and harm reduction centres operate in Afghanistan, Australia, Canada, China, Germany, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Norway, Russia, Spain, Tajikistan, the United Kingdom (UK), the United States (US), Vietnam,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The case for the wider distribution of naloxone in Australia|url=http://www.atoda.org.au/wp-content/uploads/The_heroin_reversal_drug_naloxone_FIN2.pdf|work=Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Other Drug Association ACT|publisher=ATODA|accessdate=30 March 2013|author1=Paul Dietze |author2=Simon Lenton |format=PDF|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; India, Thailand, Kyrgyzstan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tools for Starting a Naloxone Program|url=http://naloxoneinfo.org|work=Open Society Foundations|publisher=Open Society Foundations|accessdate=17 March 2014|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denmark and Estonia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/events/2014/meetings/naloxone EMCDDA event: 'Take home naloxone to reduce fatalities: scaling up a participatory intervention across Europe] 14 October 2014, Lisbon.&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
Officers in Quincy, [[Massachusetts]], US began carrying the nasal spray form of the drug in October 2010, following the completion of a Department of Public Health pilot program, in which naloxone was distributed to friends and families of opiate users, in 2007. Quincy officers have administered the drug 221 times and reversed 211 overdoses since the commencement of the initiative. Espanola Valley, New Mexico and Ocean County, New Jersey police officers then followed the Quincy example in 2013. Quincy mayor Thomas Koch explained in early 2014: "It's easy for the cynical person to say, 'Oh, they're druggies, they're junkies, let them die. But when you put a name and a face and a family to that, then it's a different story. Some people who go down this road will never come back, but if we can bring them back, there's always hope."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police carry special drug to reverse heroin overdoses|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/01/30/police-use-narcan-to-reverse-heroin-overdoses/5063587/|accessdate=8 April 2014|newspaper=USA Today|date=3 February 2014|author=Donna Leinwand Leger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the use of the nasal spray device by police officers on [[Staten Island]] in New York, an additional 20,000 police officers will begin carrying naloxone in mid-2014. The state's Office of the Attorney General will provide [[United States dollar|US$]]1.2 million to supply nearly 20,000 kits and Police Commissioner William Bratton said: "Naloxone gives individuals a second chance to get help".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NYPD officers to carry heroin antidote|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/05/27/new-york-police-department-naloxone/9630299/|accessdate=30 May 2014|newspaper=USA Today|date=27 May 2014|author=Jessica Durando}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Harm Reduction Programs distribute [[Naloxone]] kits to people who use opioids and their friends and families to prevent overdose deaths. The distribution of Naloxone and public education by harm reduction programs has been shown to increase the survival rate for opioid users that experience an overdose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Giglio|first1= Rebecca E|last2= Li|first2= Guohua|last3= DiMaggio|first3= Charles J |date= May 22, 2015 |title=Effectiveness of bystander naloxone administration and overdose education programs: a meta-analysis |pmc=5005759|journal= Injury Epidemiology |volume= 2 |issue=1 |doi=10.1186/s40621-015-0041-8 |access-date= |pmid=27747742}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific harms associated with cannabis include increased accident-rate while [[Effects of cannabis#Effects on driving|driving under intoxication]], [[Cannabis dependence|dependence]], [[Long-term effects of cannabis#Psychosis|psychosis]], detrimental psychosocial outcomes for adolescent users and [[Cannabis-associated respiratory disease|respiratory disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_101262_EN_emcdda-harm%20red-mon-ch8-web.pdf%20%7Ctitle=Chapter%208: |format=PDF |title=Chapter 8 : Harm reduction policies for cannabis |author1=Wayne Hall |author2=Benedikt Fischer |website=Emcdda.europe.eu |accessdate=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some safer cannabis usage campaigns including the UKCIA (United Kingdom Cannabis Internet Activists) encourage methods of consumption shown to cause less physical damage to a users body, including oral (eating) consumption, vaporization, the usage of bongs which cool and to some extent filters the smoke, and smoking the cannabis without mixing it with tobacco.

The fact that cannabis possession carries prison sentences in most developed countries is also pointed out as a problem by [[European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction]] (EMCDDA), as the consequences of a conviction for otherwise law-abiding users arguably is more harmful than any harm from the drug itself. For example, by adversely affecting employment opportunities, impacting civil rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kcba.org/druglaw/pdf/drugconviction.pdf |format=PDF |title=FACT SHEET: IMPACT OF DRUG CONVICTIONS ON INDIVIDUAL LIVES |website=Kcba.org |accessdate=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and straining personal relationships.&lt;ref name=emcdda-cannabis&gt;{{harvnb|EMCDDA|2010}} {{cite web |url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_101262_EN_emcdda-harm%20red-mon-ch8-web.pdf |title=Chapter 8: Harm reduction policies for cannabis |vauthors=Hall W, Fischer B |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people like [[Ethan Nadelmann]] of the [[Drug Policy Alliance]] have suggested that organized marijuana legalization would encourage safe use and reveal the factual adverse effects from exposure to this herb's individual chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/05/30/should-latin-america-end-the-war-on-drugs/regulate-drug-use-dont-criminalize-it | work=The New York Times | title=Should Latin America End the War on Drugs? | date=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The way the laws concerning cannabis are enforced is also very selective, even discriminatory. Statistics show that the socially disadvantaged, immigrants and ethnic minorities have significantly higher arrest rates.&lt;ref name=emcdda-cannabis /&gt; Drug [[decriminalisation]], such as allowing the possession of small amounts of cannabis and possibly its cultivation for personal use, would alleviate these harms.&lt;ref name=emcdda-cannabis /&gt; Where decriminalisation has been implemented, such as in several states in [[Australia]] and [[United States]], as well as in [[Portugal]] and the [[Netherlands]] no, or only very small adverse effects have been shown on population cannabis usage rate.&lt;ref name=emcdda-cannabis /&gt; The lack of evidence of increased use indicates that such a policy shift does not have adverse effects on cannabis-related harm while, at the same time, decreasing enforcement costs.&lt;ref name=emcdda-cannabis /&gt;

In the last few years certain strains of the [[cannabis]] plant with higher concentrations of [[THC]] and [[drug tourism]] have challenged the former policy in the Netherlands and led to a more restrictive approach; for example, a ban on selling cannabis to tourists in [[Cannabis coffee shop|coffeeshops]] suggested to start late 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Traditionally, [[homeless shelter]]s ban [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]. In 1997, as the result of an [[inquest]] into the deaths of two homeless alcoholics two years earlier, [[Toronto]]'s [[Seaton House]] became the first homeless shelter in Canada to operate a "wet shelter" on a "managed alcohol" principle in which clients are served a glass of wine once an hour unless staff determine that they are too inebriated to continue. Previously, homeless alcoholics opted to stay on the streets often seeking alcohol from unsafe sources such as mouthwash, rubbing alcohol or industrial products which, in turn, resulted in frequent use of [[Emergency department|emergency medical facilities]]. The programme has been duplicated in other Canadian cities, and a study of [[Ottawa]]'s "wet shelter" found that emergency room visit and police encounters by clients were cut by half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=McKeen, Scott |title='Wet' shelter needs political will: Toronto project could serve as model for Edmonton |work=Edmonton Journal |date=March 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study, published in the ''[[Canadian Medical Association Journal]]'' in 2006, found that serving chronic street alcoholics controlled doses of alcohol also reduced their overall alcohol consumption.

Further, despite the fact residents are not required to be abstinent or in treatment for alcohol use, stable housing also results in reduced drinking among homeless alcoholics.

A high amount of media coverage exists informing users of the dangers of [[drunk driving|driving drunk]]. Most alcohol users are now aware of these dangers and safe ride techniques like '[[designated driver]]s' and free taxicab programmes are reducing the number of drunk-driving accidents. Many cities have free-ride-home programmes during holidays involving high alcohol abuse, and some bars and clubs will provide a visibly drunk patron with a free cab ride.

In [[New South Wales]] groups of licensees have formed local liquor accords and collectively developed, implemented and promoted a range of harm minimisation programmes including the aforementioned 'designated driver' and 'late night patron transport' schemes. Many of the transport schemes are free of charge to patrons, to encourage them to avoid drink-driving and at the same time reduce the impact of noisy patrons loitering around late night venues.

[[Moderation Management]] is a programme which helps drinkers to cut back on their consumption of alcohol by encouraging safe drinking behaviour.

The HAMS Harm Reduction Network is a programme which encourages any positive change with regard to the use of alcohol or other mood altering substances. HAMS encourages goals of safer drinking, reduced drinking, moderate drinking, or abstinence. The choice of the goal is up to the individual.

Harm reduction in alcohol dependency could be instituted by use of [[naltrexone]].&lt;ref name="Volpicelli1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Volpicelli|first1=Joseph R.|title=Naltrexone in the Treatment of Alcohol Dependence|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|volume=49|issue=11|year=1992|page=876|issn=0003-990X|doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1992.01820110040006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tobacco ===
{{Main|Tobacco harm reduction}}
Tobacco harm reduction describes actions taken to lower the health risks associated with using tobacco, especially combustible forms, without abstaining completely from tobacco and nicotine. Some of these measures include switching to safer (lower tar) cigarettes, switching to [[snus]] or [[dipping tobacco]], or using a non-tobacco nicotine delivery systems. In recent years, the growing use of [[electronic cigarette]]s for [[smoking cessation]], whose long-term safety remains uncertain, has sparked an ongoing controversy among medical and public health between those who seek to restrict and discourage all use until more is known and those who see them as a useful approach for harm reduction, whose risks are most unlikely to equal those of smoking tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farsalinos|first1=Konstantinos|last2=LeHouezec|first2=Jacques|title=Regulation in the face of uncertainty: the evidence on electronic nicotine delivery systems (e-cigarettes)|journal=Risk Management and Healthcare Policy|year=2015|volume=8|pages=157–167|issn=1179-1594|doi=10.2147/RMHP.S62116|pmc=4598199|pmid=26457058}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Their usefulness in tobacco harm reduction as a substitute for [[tobacco products]] is unclear,&lt;ref name=Drummond2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drummond|first1=MB|last2=Upson|first2=D|title=Electronic cigarettes. Potential harms and benefits.|journal=Annals of the American Thoracic Society|date=February 2014|volume=11|issue=2|pages=236–42|pmid=24575993|doi=10.1513/annalsats.201311-391fr|pmc=5469426}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in an effort to [[tobacco control movement|decrease tobacco related death and disease]], they have a potential to be part of the strategy.&lt;ref name=Cahn2011&gt;{{cite journal |first2=M |last1=M. |first1=Z. |last2=Siegel |title=Electronic cigarettes as a harm reduction strategy for tobacco control: a step forward or a repeat of past mistakes? |journal=Journal of public health policy |date=February 2011 |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=16–31 |doi=10.1057/jphp.2010.41 |pmid=21150942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is widely acknowledged that discontinuation of all tobacco products confers the greatest lowering of risk. However, there is a considerable population of inveterate smokers who are unable or unwilling to achieve abstinence. Harm reduction may be of substantial benefit to these individuals.

=== Psychedelics ===
The Zendo Project conducted by the [[Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies]] uses principles from [[psychedelic therapy]] to provide safe places and emotional support for people having difficult experiences on psychedelic drugs at select [[festival]]s such as [[Burning Man]], [[Boom Festival]], and [[Lightning in a Bottle]] without [[medicine|medical]] or [[law enforcement]] intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Psychedelic Harm Reduction| publisher=[[Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies]]| url=http://www.maps.org/resources/responding_to_difficult_psychedelic_experiences/| accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drugs such as [[MDMA]] (commonly sold by the slang names "ecstasy" and "molly") are often adulterated. One harm reduction approach is [[drug checking]], where people intending to use drugs can have their substances tested for content and purity so that they can then make more informed decisions about safer consumption. European organisations have offered drug checking services since 1992 and these services now operate in over twenty countries. As an example, the nonprofit organization [[DanceSafe]] offers on-site testing of the contents of pills and powders at various [[electronic music]] events around the US. They also sell kits for users to test the contents of drugs themselves. [http://pillreports.com/ PillReports.com] invites ecstasy users to send samples of drugs for laboratory testing and publishes the results online.

== Sex ==

=== Safer sex programmes ===
Many schools now provide [[safer sex]] education to teen and pre-teen students, who may engage in sexual activity. Since some adolescents are going to have sex, a harm-reductionist approach supports a sexual education which emphasizes the use of protective devices like [[condoms]] and [[dental dam]]s to protect against unwanted pregnancy and the transmission of [[sexually transmitted infections|STI]]s. This runs contrary to [[sexual abstinence|abstinence]]-only sex education, which teaches that educating children about sex can encourage them to engage in it.

These programmes have been found to decrease risky sexual behaviour and prevent [[sexually transmitted diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=BT |author2=Scott-Sheldon, LA |author3=Huedo-Medina, TB |author4=Carey, MP|title=Interventions to reduce sexual risk for human immunodeficiency virus in adolescents: a meta-analysis of trials, 1985-2008|journal=Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine|date=January 2011|volume=165|issue=1|pages=77–84|pmid=21199984|doi=10.1001/archpediatrics.2010.251|pmc=4361805}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also reduce rates of unwanted pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oringanje|first=Chioma|last2=Meremikwu|first2=Martin M.|last3=Eko|first3=Hokehe|last4=Esu|first4=Ekpereonne|last5=Meremikwu|first5=Anne|last6=Ehiri|first6=John E.|date=2016-02-03|title=Interventions for preventing unintended pregnancies among adolescents|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=2|pages=CD005215|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005215.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=26839116}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abstinence only]] programmes do not appear to affect HIV risks in developed countries with no evidence available for other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Underhill|first=K|author2=Operario, D |author3=Montgomery, P |title=Abstinence-only programs for HIV infection prevention in high-income countries|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=2007-10-17|issue=4|pages=CD005421|pmid=17943855|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005421.pub2|editor1-last=Operario|editor1-first=Don}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legalized prostitution ===
{{Main|Legality of prostitution}}

Since 1999 some countries have legalized prostitution, such as [[Prostitution in Germany|Germany]] (2002) and [[Prostitution in New Zealand|New Zealand]] (2003). However, in most countries the practice is prohibited. Gathering accurate statistics on prostitution and human trafficking is extremely difficult. This has resulted in proponents of legalization claiming that it reduces organized crime rates while opponents claim exactly the converse. The [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|Dutch prostitution policy]], which is one of the most liberal in the world, has gone back and forth on the issue several times. In the period leading up to 2015 up to a third of officially sanctioned work places had been closed down again after reports of human trafficking. Prostitutes themselves are generally opposed to what they see as "theft of their livelihood"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=AlwaysUnite |date=2015-04-11 |url=http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/4024/AMSTERDAM-CENTRUM/article/detail/3947731/2015/04/09/Prostituees-protesteren-tegen-sluiting-ramen.dhtml |title=Paar honderd prostituees protesteren tegen sluiting raambordelen |work=National Daily }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sex work and HIV ===

Despite the depth of knowledge of HIV/AIDS, rapid transmission has occurred globally in sex workers.&lt;ref name="pmid11251723"/&gt; The relationship between these two variables greatly increases the risk of transmission among these populations, and also to anyone associated with them, such as their sexual partners, their children, and eventually the population at large.&lt;ref name="pmid11251723"/&gt;

Many street-level harm-reduction strategies have succeeded in reducing HIV transmission in [[injecting drug user]]s and sex-workers.&lt;ref name="pmid16360791"/&gt; HIV education, HIV testing, condom use, and safer-sex negotiation greatly decreases the risk to the disease.&lt;ref name="pmid16360791"/&gt; Peer education as a harm reduction strategy has especially reduced the risk of HIV infection, such as in Chad, where this method was the most cost-effective per infection prevented.&lt;ref name="pmid16360791"/&gt;

== Decriminalisation ==

The threat of criminal repercussions drives sex-workers and injecting drug users to the margins of society, often resulting in high-risk behaviour, increasing the rate of overdose, infectious disease transmission, and violence.&lt;ref name="pmid18164610"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Harm reduction headway and continuing resistance: insights from safe injection in the city of Vancouver |journal=Int. J. Drug Policy |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=11–6 |date=February 2008 |pmid=18164610 |doi=10.1016/j.drugpo.2007.11.006 |url= |author1=Hathaway AD |author2=Tousaw KI |name-list-format=vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=May 2010}} Decriminalisation as a harm-reduction strategy gives the ability to treat drug abuse solely as a public health issue rather than a criminal activity. This enables other harm-reduction strategies to be employed, which results in a lower incidence of HIV infection.&lt;ref name="pmid16360791"/&gt;

== Psychiatric medications ==

With the growing concern about psychiatric medication adverse effects and long-term dependency, peer-run mental health groups [[Freedom Center (mental health organization)|Freedom Center]] and [[The Icarus Project]] published the Harm Reduction Guide to Coming Off Psychiatric Drugs. The self-help guide provides patients with information to help assess risks and benefits, and to prepare to come off, reduce, or continue medications when their physicians are unfamiliar with or unable to provide this guidance. The guide is in circulation among mental health consumer groups and has been translated into ten languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theicarusproject.net/HarmReductionGuideComingOffPsychDrugs |title=Harm Reduction Guide to Coming Off Psychiatric Drugs |first=Will |last=Hall |date=September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112214617/http://www.theicarusproject.net/HarmReductionGuideComingOffPsychDrugs |archivedate=2013-11-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- To-do list that someone dropped in here:
== Other programmes ==
Other harm reduction programmes to be expanded on:
* Encouragement of the use of safer cannabis smoking devices/cannabinoid delivery systems such as [[vaporiser]]s, as opposed to water pipes, cigarettes and straight pipes
* Encouragement of the use of smokeless systems of nicotine delivery, known as [[Tobacco harm reduction]], as opposed to the much riskier method of burning and inhaling tobacco.
* Promote the use of safer modes of use such as safer crack pipes (as opposed to use of a pipe which may burn or cut the users mouth, increasing risk of transmittable diseases) Use of screens which are safer than the use of a brillo pad which may embed metal particles into the lungs.
* Promote various safer use strategies such as having a chronic alcoholic have a chaser of water between drinks.
* Advocate the use of a Substitute Decision Maker or Power of Attorney so a person's rent is paid before the drug of choice, ensuring the person always has housing.
* Provide vitamins to ensure a person's physical needs are somewhat met
* Lessen the use of mouthwash, Gravol, isopropanol etc. in poverty-stricken chronic alcoholics as a source of an alcohol, and replace with something less destructive, such as ethanol without toxic additives, and eliminate the use of isopropanol.
* Allowing young people decision making power and access to [[birth control|contraceptives]]
* Allowing young people decision making power to terminate a pregnancy.
* State regulated production and distribution of formerly illegal drugs (legalization)
* History of Harm Reduction

== Criticism ==
Critics, such as [[Drug Free America Foundation]] and other members of network ''International Task Force on Strategic Drug Policy'', state that a risk posed by harm reduction is by creating the perception that certain behaviours can be partaken of safely, such as illicit drug use, that it may lead to an increase in that behaviour by people who would otherwise be deterred.

{{quote|We oppose so-called 'harm reduction' strategies as endpoints that promote the false notion that there are safe or responsible ways to use drugs. That is, strategies in which the primary goal is to enable drug users to maintain addictive, destructive, and compulsive behavior by misleading users about some drug risks while ignoring others.|"Statement on so-called 'Harm Reduction' policies" made at a conference in Brussels, Belgium by signatories of the drug prohibitionist network International Task Force on Strategic Drug Policy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itfsdp.org/pdfs/hrstatementbrussels.pdf |title=The International Task Force Meeting Statement on So-Called "Harm Reduction" Policies|website=Itfsdp.org |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|...some organizations and local governments actively advocate the legalization of drugs and promote policies such as "harm reduction" that accept drug use and do not help drug users to become free from drug abuse. This undermines the international efforts to limit the supply of and demand for drugs. "Harm reduction" is too often another word for drug legalization or other inappropriate relaxation efforts, a policy approach that violates the UN Conventions.|"Declaration of the World Forum Against Drugs Stockholm Sweden, September 10, 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wfad.se/about-wfad/wfad-declaration |title=WFAD Declaration &amp;#124; World Federation Against Drugs |website=Wfad.se |date= |accessdate=2016-08-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160723190521/http://wfad.se/about-wfad/wfad-declaration |archive-date=2016-07-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, in Switzerland the incidence of heroin abuse has declined sharply since the introduction of heroin assisted treatment. As a study published in [[The Lancet]] concluded:

{{quote|The harm reduction policy of Switzerland and its emphasis on the medicalisation of the heroin problem seems to have contributed to the image of heroin as unattractive for young people."| Nordt, Carlos, and Rudolf Stohler, "Incidence of Heroin Use in Zurich, Switzerland: A Treatment Case Register Analysis,"&lt;ref name=Nordt06&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nordt C, Stohler R |title=Incidence of heroin use in Zurich, Switzerland: a treatment case register analysis |journal=Lancet |volume=367 |issue=9525 |pages=1830–4 |date=June 2006 |pmid=16753485 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68804-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Critics furthermore reject harm reduction measures for allegedly trying to establish certain forms of drug use as acceptable in society:

{{quote|Harm reduction has come to represent a philosophy in which illicit substance use is seen as largely unpreventable, and increasingly, as a feasible and acceptable lifestyle as long as use is not 'problematic'. At its root of this philosophy lay an acceptance of drug use into the mainstream of society. We reject this philosophy as fatalistic and faulty at its core. The idea that we can safely use drugs is a dangerous one. ... It is in fact an unsafe choice that brings great harm to individuals, families, and communities across. And it sends the wrong message to the most valuable yet vulnerable group of Canadians – our children and youth.|Drug Prevention Network of Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpnoc.ca/harm_reduction.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100424034742/http://www.dpnoc.ca/harm_reduction.htm |archivedate=2010-04-24 |title=Drug Prevention Network Canada - Harm Reduction |website=Web.archive.org |date=2010-04-24 |accessdate=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Pope [[Benedict XVI]] strongly criticised harm reduction policies with regards to HIV/AIDS, saying that it was "a tragedy that cannot be overcome by money alone, that cannot be overcome through the distribution of condoms, which even aggravates the problems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1012144/Condoms-%27not-the-answer-to-AIDS%27 |title=Condoms 'not the answer to AIDS': Pope |work=World News Australia |date=17 March 2009 |publisher=SBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; This position was in turn widely criticised for misrepresenting and oversimplifying the role of condoms in preventing infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kamerow D |title=The papal position on condoms and HIV |journal=BMJ |volume=338 |pages=b1217 |year=2009 |pmid=19321547 |doi=10.1136/bmj.b1217 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Roehr B |title=Pope claims that condoms exacerbate HIV and AIDS problem |journal=BMJ |volume=338 |pages=b1206 |year=2009 |doi=10.1136/bmj.b1206 |pmid=19321545 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[wikt:homograph|homograph]]'' is a word that is written the same as another word, but which (usually) has a different meaning. ''[[wikt:interlingual|Interlingual]]'' means "spanning multiple languages". In some cases, the identical spelling of a word in two languages is coincidental; in other cases, it is because they descend from the same ancestor word. Words that come from the same ancestor are called ''[[cognate]]s''.

Another way of describing interlingual homographs is to say that they are ''orthographically identical'',&lt;ref name="Kecskes_Albertazzi"/&gt; since a language's [[orthography]] describes the rules for writing the language: [[spelling]], [[diacritic]]s, [[capitalization]], [[hyphen]]ation, [[word divider]]s, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2635">'''''Into the Open''''', subtitled "New Paintings, Prints and Sculptures by Contemporary Black Artists", was an exhibition of art by black artists displayed at various venues in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1984.

This exhibition was the first major survey by a municipal gallery of contemporary work by [[black artists]] in Britain, and is considered one of the landmark exhibitions of the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Eddie Chambers, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dYDoAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=%22into+the+open%22+exhibition+black+artists&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAGoVChMI4PjDjrXdxwIVh9gaCh2mewRj#v=onepage&amp;q=%22into%20the%20open%22%20exhibition%20black%20artists&amp;f=false ''Black Artists in British Art: A History since the 1950s''], I.B. Tauris, 2014, p. 113. {{ISBN|1780762720}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was curated, at the invitation of [[Sheffield City Arts Department]], by two people closely involved with black artists in Britain: [[Pogus Caesar]] and [[Lubaina Himid]].  Their stated aim was to give an indication of the range and richness of art made by contemporary [[wikt:Afro-Caribbean|Afro Caribbean]] artists.

The ''Into the Open'' exhibition toured in the United Kingdom in 1984, appearing at three venues: the [[Mappin Art Gallery]] in [[Sheffield]] (4 August–9 September 1984), the [[Nottingham Castle#Nottingham Castle Museum|Castle Museum]] in [[Nottingham]] (16 September–21 October 1984), and the [[Newcastle Media Workshops]] in [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]] (2–24 November 1984).&lt;ref&gt;Chambers (2014), note 20, pp. 255–56.&lt;/ref&gt; It was organized by the Sheffield Arts Department and was subsidised by the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]].

'''''It's About Time''''' is an American fantasy/science-fiction comedy TV series that aired on [[CBS]] for one season of 26 episodes in 1966&amp;ndash;1967. The series was created by [[Sherwood Schwartz]], and used [[set construction|sets]], [[theatrical property|props]] and [[incidental music]] from Schwartz's other television series in production at the time, ''[[Gilligan's Island]]''.

==Description==
[[File:Its about time 1967.jpg|thumb|The cave family in the 20th century. Publicity photo shows Joe E. Ross, Imogene Coca, Mary (Graham) Grace, and Pat Cardi.]]

Two astronauts, Mac McKenzie ([[Frank Aletter]]) and Hector Canfield ([[Jack Mullaney]]), travel faster than the speed of light, resulting in being sent back in time to [[prehistory|prehistoric]] days. There, they have to adjust to living with a [[caveman|cave family]] led by Shad ([[Imogene Coca]]) and Gronk ([[Joe E. Ross]]). (Coca's character's name was originally pronounced "Shag" in the first episode, after which her character's name was pronounced "Shad" (evidenced in the rerun episodes on [[Antenna TV]]), though in the opening titles, her billing still read "IMOGENE COCA as SHAG"; this changed in the episode "20th Century Here We Come" when new opening titles were created for the series' retooling &lt;!-- (see below) --&gt; and her billing was changed to read "IMOGENE COCA as SHAD".{{fact|date=June 2016}} Their children were 18-year-old Mlor (Mary Grace, credited in the retooled closing titles as Mary Graham Grace) and 14-year-old Breer (Pat Cardi). The chief of the tribe, Boss ([[Cliff Norton]]) and his right-hand man Clon ([[Mike Mazurki]]) were always suspicious of the astronauts.

Ratings were impressive for the first few weeks on the air, but they soon plunged. Show creator  Schwartz came to the conclusion that three factors were the cause of the decline in audience interest:

*Repetition of the astronauts being in danger from dinosaurs, clubs, spears, volcanoes, and cavemen
*An unattractive look to the show (e.g., caves, dirt streets, etc.)
*The cave dwellers speaking a primitive form of English that was difficult to listen to&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Bob. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iv4jAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YQUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1761,7010111&amp;dq=it's-about-time+imogene-coca&amp;hl=en "It's About Time Undergoing Changes"] ''[[Ocala Star-Banner]]'' (December 28, 1966)&lt;/ref&gt;

For these reasons, after 18 broadcast episodes set in prehistoric times, the series was retooled beginning with the January 22, 1967 episode. (A 19th "prehistoric" episode had been completed, but it was not broadcast until after the end of the series' original run; this could possibly have been due to its originally scheduled broadcast being preempted for special programming, which happened occasionally to many TV shows, throwing their original broadcast order out of sync when the networks would broadcast the episode at the end of the season's first-run episodes rather than postponing the broadcast until the following week.){{or|date=June 2016}}  Essentially reversing the premise which had been followed the first half of the season, on the January 22 episode, the astronauts repair their space capsule and return to 1967, with Shad, Gronk, and their children in tow.  Boss and Clon make their final appearances in this episode, which also introduces two new supporting characters who would stay with the show going forward:  [[Alan DeWitt]] as Mr. Tyler, manager of the apartment building where Mac and Hector live, and [[Frank Wilcox]] as General Morley, their commanding officer.

In the retooled version of the show (which had an updated theme song, explaining the new premise), the prehistoric family must begin adjusting to life in the 1960s, reacting to the unfamiliar surroundings, and setting up home in 20th-century Los Angeles. For example, one episode had Gronk and Shad learning to write their names and signing them for many salesmen who brought "presents", which had to be paid for later. Mac and Hector also had to convince their disbelieving superior that they really did travel in time, and are not playing some sort of elaborate practical joke.  Seven episodes were produced with this new premise before the series was cancelled at the end of the season.

 --&gt;
''It's About Time'' is a 1960s typical "silly" comedy of the times (in the style of ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'', also created by Sherwood Schwartz) about two astronauts who accidentally break the speed of light with their spacecraft and travel back in time to prehistoric Earth, replete with cavemen (and cavewomen) and, anachronistically, dinosaurs. Unable to return to the future, they make friends with the "natives", usually through humorous interactions, misunderstandings, and dilemmas. Eventually, they do return to "modern day" Earth, taking some of the cavepeople back with them, who must then adjust to living in 1960s Los Angeles.

* "The Stowaway" was originally scheduled to air January 15, 1967, but was pre-empted by an episode of ''[[Lassie]]'' after CBS revamped its prime time line up following  [[Super Bowl I|the first-ever Super Bowl]] which aired earlier that evening. This episode was set in prehistoric times, and clearly predates the previous seven episodes. However, it did not air until April 2, 1967. In the show's current syndication reruns on certain networks&amp;nbsp;– such as [[Antenna TV]]&amp;nbsp;– this episode airs in its intended order, immediately preceding "20th Century Here We Come...".

The '''Jungian interpretation of religion''', pioneered by [[Carl Jung]] and advanced by his followers, is an attempt to interpret [[religion]] in the light of [[Analytical psychology|Jungian psychology]]. Unlike [[Sigmund Freud]] and his followers, Jungians tend to treat religious beliefs and behaviors in a positive light, while offering psychological referents to traditional religious terms such as "[[soul]]", "[[evil]]", "[[Transcendence (religion)|transcendence]]", "the [[sacred]]", and "[[God]]". Because beliefs do not have to be true in order for people to hold them, the Jungian interpretation of religion has been, and continues to be, of interest to psychologists and theists.

==Jungian psychology==
{{main|Analytical psychology}}
Jung established a school of [[psychology]] which emphasizes the human quest for wholeness (which he defined as the integration of conscious and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] components of the psyche) through a process called [[Individuation#Carl Jung|individuation]]. Through studying [[folklore]], world [[mythology|mythologies]], and the dreams of his patients, Jung identified these components of the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as expressions of instinctual patterns (or [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]]). The role of the [[psychoanalyst]] in the Jungian approach is to assist the analysand from being overwhelmed by unconscious material or being cut off from the meaning offered by these suprapersonal forces. Jungian analysts typically believe that the psyche is the source of healing and the drive toward individuation.

== Western religious tradition ==

Jung's assessment of [[Western religion]] arose both from his own experiences as well as from the psychotherapeutic work with his European clients. As a young man he had visions and dreams that were powerful and rich with meaning, yet he clung to Christianity. While he believed that God could "do stupendous things to me, things of fire and unearthly light", he was profoundly disappointed by his [[first communion]]—in his words, "nothing happened".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jaffe|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; He saw the same symptoms in his clients, namely, a fascination with the power of the unconscious, coupled with the inadequacy of Western religious symbols and rituals to represent this power. Summing up his analysis of the modern European situation he said: "Our age wants to experience the psyche for itself ... ''knowledge'', instead of ''faith''."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jung|1970a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jungian training analyst Murray Stein, Jung related theological and psychological constructs using three tenets:&lt;ref name="Stein_1990"&gt;{{harvp|Stein|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Theological elements (such as God) can be interpreted to refer to psychological concepts.
# Psychologists can evaluate the adequacy of theological constructs against the dynamics of the psyche.
# Words about the psyche are also words about God, due to the correspondence between [[subjectivity]] and [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]].

Thus, proceeding by tenet #1 in ''[[Answer to Job]]'', Jung interpreted [[Yahweh]] as an archaic form of the self, [[Book of Job|Job]] as the ego, and [[Satan]] as the principle of individuation. Jung interprets the evolution of the god-image portrayed in the [[Old Testamen|Old]] and [[New Testament]] as a process of psychological development: In the Book of Job, the archaic self is prompted to develop toward consciousness by the more conscious ego, a process attended by dreams and prophesies (e.g. the Old Testament prophets). The self enters ego-consciousness (the incarnation of God in [[Jesus]] of Nazareth), followed by the emergence of the transcendent function (when the Holy Ghost comes to the disciples at Pentecost).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jung|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "A Psychological Approach to the Doctrine of the Trinity", again by tenet #1 Jung interprets the Father as the self, the source of energy within the psyche; the Son as an emergent structure of consciousness that replaces the self-alienated ego; and the Holy Spirit as a mediating structure between the ego and the self.&lt;ref name="PaRWaE"&gt;{{harvp|Jung|1970b}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jung believed that the psyche moves toward completion in fours (made up of pairs of opposites), and that therefore (using tenet #3 above) the Christian formulation of the Trinity would give way to a quaternity by including missing aspects (e.g. the feminine and evil). (This analysis prompted Jung to send a congratulatory note to [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1950 upon the adoption of the doctrine of the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary]], to wit completing the quaternity.)

== Eastern religious tradition ==

Jung wrote a number of books and articles about Eastern religions, including commentaries on the ''[[Tibetan Book of the Dead]]'', [[yoga]], and Eastern [[meditation]]. He also contributed forewords to books on [[Zen Buddhism]], [[Sadhu|Holy Men of India]], and the ''[[I Ching]]''.&lt;ref name="PaRWaE"/&gt;

==Gnosticism==
{{main|Gnosticism in modern times}}

Carl Jung and his associate [[G. R. S. Mead]] worked on trying to understand and explain the gnostic faith from a psychological standpoint. Jung's analytical psychology in many ways schematically mirrors ancient gnostic mythology, particularly those of [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]] and the 'classic' gnostic doctrine described in most detail in the ''[[Apocryphon of John]]'' (see [[Gnosticism#Major gnostic schools and their texts|gnostic schools]]).

Jung understands the emergence of the [[Demiurge]] out of the original, unified monadic source of the spiritual universe by gradual stages to be analogous to (and a symbolic depiction of) the emergence of the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] from the unconscious. However, it is uncertain as to whether the similarities between Jung's psychological teachings and those of the Gnostics are due to their sharing a "[[perennial philosophy]]", or whether Jung was unwittingly influenced by the Gnostics in the formation of his theories. Jung's own 'gnostic hymn', the ''[[Septem Sermones ad Mortuos]]'' (The Seven Sermons to the Dead), would tend to imply the latter, but after circulating the manuscript, Jung declined to publish it during his lifetime. Since it is not clear whether Jung was ultimately displeased with the book or whether he merely suppressed it as too controversial, the issue remains contested. Uncertain too are Jung's belief that the gnostics were aware of and intended psychological meaning or significance within their myths.

On the other hand, it is clear from a comparison of Jung's writings and that of ancient Gnostics, that Jung disagreed with them on the ultimate goal of the individual. Gnostics in ancient times clearly sought a return to a supreme, other-worldly [[Deity|Godhead]]. In a study of Jung, [[Robert Segal]] claimed that the eminent psychologist would have found the psychological interpretation of the goal of ancient Gnosticism (that is, re-unification with the [[Pleroma]], or the unknown God) to be psychically 'dangerous', as being a total identification with the unconscious. To contend that there is at least some disagreement between Jung and Gnosticism is at least supportable: the Jungian process of individuation involves the addition of unconscious psychic tropes to consciousness in order to achieve a trans-conscious centre to the personality. Jung did not intend this addition to take the form of a ''complete'' identification of the Self with the Unconscious.

== Extensions and criticisms ==
Edward F. Edinger systematized and extended Jung’s interpretation of the [[Judeo-Christian]] God, particularly in his book ''Ego and Archetype''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Edinger|1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Wallace Clift]], an Episcopal priest, explored similarities between Jung’s vision of humanity as “a story of developing consciousness” with Christianity’s doctrine of “the Holy Spirit understood as present in each person. ... It is not a matter of making out each person a ‘God’, but on the contrary, realizing that within each person lies the potentiality of responding to God by bringing that encounter into consciousness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Clift|1982|pp=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further proposed the existence of a new post-Jungian archetype of ''pilgrimage''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Clift|Clift|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Episcopal priest and Jungian analyst [[John A. Sanford]], interprets Jesus’ teachings from a Jungian perspective in his 1970 book ''The Kingdom Within'' in which he associates being a Pharisee with identifying with our mask or [[persona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sanford|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; He interprets the Devil or temptation to sin as “the inner adversary”, the saying “love your enemies” as the dictate to discover and remove our projections from others, and advocates Jesus as the exemplar of human wholeness, uniting body, soul, spirit, sexuality, [[eros]], and meaning through love. Jungian analyst and professor of psychology and religion [[Robert L. Moore]] cites Christ as expressing four archetypes found in the male psyche: the Warrior (in wrestling with his inner demons in the desert and at Gethsemane);&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Moore|Gillette|1992a|pp=113, 154}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Lover (in radicalizing the commandment to love our neighbors);&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Moore|Gillette|1993a|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Magician (in changing water to wine, feeding the thousands, and healing the sick);&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Moore|Gillette|1993b|pp=87, 192}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the King (in generating the Kingdom of God, and in identifying himself with the way to the Father).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Moore|Gillette|1992b|pp=101–105, 186–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Hillman]], founder of [[archetypal psychology]], has done much to expose the unacknowledged or shadow “Christianisms” within Jungian depth psychology itself, ''e.g.'' one barrier to grasping the underworld or domain of Hades as the psychic realm is Christ’s victory over death.&lt;ref name="Hillman_79"&gt;{{harvp|Hillman|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the model for viewing the shadow as a moral problem is the Christian doctrine of sin.&lt;ref name="Hillman_94"&gt;{{harvp|Hillman|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hillman believes that soul or interiority refers not only to humans but to inanimate objects and to the world.&lt;ref name="Hillman_94"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hillman|Venura|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hillman is critical of Jung’s convention of equating symbols of roundness (e.g. the [[rose window]] of a cathedral) with the Self, and discourages the attempt to achieve undivided wholeness by integrating parts. Jung’s Self (representing the inner God) derives from monotheism, and by contrast Hillman encourages a polytheistic perspective.&lt;ref name="Hillman_79"/&gt;

Fr. Victor White, an English Dominican theologian and priest, and Jung carried on a 15&amp;nbsp;year correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lammers|Cunningham|Stein|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through their dialog, White attempted to integrate analytical psychology into Catholic theology while Jung attempted to re-interpret Christian symbols. It was clear to White that “Jung was a psychiatrist and not a professional philosopher and/or theologian &amp;ndash; and that there were important theological issues which Jung seemed, for whatever reason, not to understand or to value”.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Moore|Meckel|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; One unresolved point was White’s perspective that evil is the absence of good, whereas Jung believed that an adequate god image must include evil to balance the good. In addition, White floundered on Jung’s assumption that the Judeo-Christian god image changes over time, and that it would be replaced by something different in the distant future. In his 1994 book, [[Richard Noll]]  makes the case that Jung promoted his psychological theories as a pagan religion, and asserts that one cannot be both a Catholic and a Jungian.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Noll|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eminent Jewish theologian and philosopher, [[Martin Buber]], had a lifelong interest in psychoanalysis, and may have attended the same ''Eranos'' conference with Jung in 1934. In 1952 Buber and Jung exchanged letters regarding a paper Buber had published entitled “Religion and Modern Thinking”. In his rejoinder, Buber claimed that Jung had strayed outside his realm of expertise into theology by asserting that God does not exist independent of the psyches of human beings. He concluded that Jung was “mystically deifying the instincts instead of hallowing them in faith”, which he called a “modern manifestation of Gnosis”.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Buber Agassi|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naomi R. Goldenberg, after reviewing Jung’s idea of archetypes as disembodied Platonic forms and on the damage done to women by the [[mind-body dichotomy]], suggests that “feminist theory radically depart from the Jungian archetype [and] from all systems of thought that posit transcendent, superhuman deities.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goldenberg|1989|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; While rejecting this part of Jungian theory, she recommends that women can use Jung’s practice of [[active imagination]], or “dreaming the dream onward”, to form a satisfying psychospiritual community.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goldenberg|1992|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marie-Louise von Franz]]’ book analyzing the dreams of the dying concludes that “the unconscious ... prepares [us] not for a definite end but for a profound transformation and for a kind of continuation of the life process”.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|von Franz|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; She joins with Edinger in suggesting that some dreams cannot be adequately interpreted as symbolic representations of subjective inner processes, but are “metaphysical”, hinting at a reality that is deeply mysterious.

There have been several stories about the ghosts of former Presidents of the United States revisiting the [[White House]], with perhaps the most common and popular one being that of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. '''Lincoln's Ghost''', otherwise known as '''The White House Ghost''', is said to have haunted the White House since his death in 1865.

==Reported apparitions==
[[File:Mumler (Lincoln).jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Mary Todd Lincoln]] with the "ghost" of her husband, in an image taken by [[spirit photography|spirit photographer]] [[William H. Mumler]]. Mumler's photos are now considered hoaxes.]]
The White House's most famous alleged apparition is that of Abraham Lincoln. One of Mumler's most famous photographs apparently shows [[Mary Todd Lincoln]] with the "ghost" of her husband, [[Abraham Lincoln]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Paranormal researcher Melvyn Willin, in his book ''Ghosts Caught on Film'', claims that the photo was taken around 1869 (after Abraham Lincoln's death), and that Mumler did not know that his sitter was Lincoln, instead believing her to be a 'Mrs Tundall'. Willin goes on to say that Mumler did not discover who she was until after the photo was developed.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The College of Psychic Studies, referencing notes belonging to William Stainton Moses (who has appeared in photographs by other spirit photographers), claim that the photo was taken in the early 1870s, Lincoln had assumed the name of 'Mrs. Lindall' and that Lincoln had to be encouraged by Mumler's wife (a [[Mediumship|medium]]) to identify her husband on the photo.&lt;ref name="psychic"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.collegeofpsychicstudies.co.uk/about/page/id/7/our-archives|title= William Stainton Moses collection|accessdate=April 29, 2014 |publisher= College of Psychic Studies}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Though the image has been dismissed as being accidental [[multiple exposure|double exposure]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://paranormal.about.com/library/weekly/aa022100a.htm|title= Presidents and the Paranormal|accessdate=2008-05-04 |last= Wagner|first= Stephen|publisher= [[About.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been widely circulated.&lt;ref name="psychic"/&gt;

[[Eleanor Roosevelt]] never admitted to having seen Lincoln's ghost, but did say that she felt his presence repeatedly throughout the White House.&lt;ref name="Pederson" /&gt; She also said that the Roosevelt family dog, Fala, would sometimes bark for no reason at what she felt was Lincoln's ghost.&lt;ref name="Ogden"&gt;Ogden, Tom. ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to Ghosts and Hauntings.'' New York: Alpha Books, 1999. {{ISBN|0-02-863659-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arlington, Va.: The Washington Book Trading Co., 1988. {{ISBN|0-915168-07-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Liz Carpenter]], press secretary to First Lady [[Lady Bird Johnson]],&lt;ref name="Norman"&gt;Norman, Michael and Scott, Beth. ''Historic Haunted America.'' Reprint ed. New York: Macmillan, 2007. {{ISBN|0-7653-1970-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; both said they felt Lincoln's presence many times.

The former president's footsteps are also said to be heard in the hall outside the Lincoln Bedroom.&lt;ref name="Ogden" /&gt;

[[Lillian Rogers Parks]] stated in her 1961 autobiography ''[[My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House]]'' that she had heard them.&lt;ref name="Parks"&gt;Parks, Lillian Rogers. ''My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House.'' New York: Fleet Publishing Corp., 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margaret Truman]], daughter of President [[Harry S. Truman]], said she heard a specter rapping at the door of the Lincoln Bedroom when she stayed there, and believed it was Lincoln.&lt;ref name="Norman" /&gt;

President Truman himself was once awakened by raps at the door while spending a night in the Lincoln Bedroom.&lt;ref name="Thomsen"&gt;Thomsen, Brian M. ''Oval Office Occult: True Stories of White House Weirdness.'' Kansas City: Andrews McMeel Publishing, 2008. {{ISBN|0-7407-7386-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several unnamed eyewitnesses have claimed to have seen the shade of Abraham Lincoln actually lying down on the bed in the Lincoln Bedroom (which was used as a meeting room at the time of his administration), and while others have seen Lincoln sit on the edge of the bed and put his boots on.&lt;ref name="Ogden" /&gt; The most famous eyewitness to the latter was Mary Eben, Eleanor Roosevelt's secretary, who saw Lincoln pulling on his boots (after which she ran screaming from the room).&lt;ref name="Pederson"&gt;Pederson, William D. and Williams, Frank J. ''Franklin D. Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln: Competing Perspectives on Two Great Presidencies.'' Armonk, N.Y.: M.E. Sharpe, 2002. {{ISBN|0-7656-1034-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blackman"&gt;[[W.

New York: Three Rivers Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-609-80021-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have actually seen an apparition of the former president. The first person reported to have actually seen Lincoln's spirit was First Lady [[Grace Coolidge]], who said she saw the ghost of Lincoln standing at a window in the [[Yellow Oval Room]] staring out at the [[Potomac River|Potomac]].&lt;ref name="Ogden" /&gt;

[[Theodore Roosevelt]]&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Merrill D. ''Lincoln in American Memory.'' Reprint ed. New York: Oxford University Press US, 1995. {{ISBN|0-19-509645-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maureen Reagan]] and her husband&lt;ref&gt;Reagan, Maureen. ''First Father, First Daughter: A Memoir.'' New York: Little, Brown and Company, 2001. {{ISBN|0-316-73636-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; have all claimed to have seen a spectral Lincoln in the White House. A number of staff members of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration claimed to have seen Lincoln's spirit,&lt;ref name="Norman" /&gt; and on one occasion Roosevelt's personal valet ran screaming from the White House claiming he had seen Lincoln's ghost.&lt;ref name="Alexander" /&gt;

Perhaps the most famous incident was in 1942 when queen [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]] allegedly heard footsteps outside her White House bedroom and answered a knock on the door, only to see Lincoln in frock coat and top hat standing in front of her (she promptly fainted).&lt;ref name="Belanger"&gt;Belanger, Jeff. ''The World's Most Haunted Places: From the Secret Files of Ghostvillage.com.'' New York: Career Press, 2004. {{ISBN|1-56414-764-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] loved to retire late, take a long, hot bath while drinking a Scotch, and smoke a cigar and relax. There is an account that on this occasion, he climbed out of the bath and naked, but for his cigar, walked into the adjoining bedroom. He was startled to see Lincoln standing by the fireplace in the room, leaning on the mantle. Churchill, always quick on the uptake, simply took his cigar out of his mouth, tapped the ash off the end of his cigar and said "Good evening, Mr. President. You seem to have me at a disadvantage." Lincoln smiled softly, as if laughing and disappeared. Churchill smiled in embarrassment.&lt;ref&gt;Garber, Marjorie B. ''Profiling Shakespeare.'' Florence, Ky.: Routledge, 2008. {{ISBN|0-415-96446-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's ghost was reportedly seen outside of the White House as well. In [[Loudonville, New York]], Lincoln's ghost was said to haunt a house that was owned by a woman who was present at [[Ford's Theatre]] when Lincoln was shot by [[John Wilkes Booth]]. Other Lincoln hauntings included his grave in [[Springfield, Illinois]], a portrait of [[Mary Todd Lincoln]] and a phantom train on nights in April along the same path his funeral train followed from Washington, D.C. to Springfield.&lt;ref&gt;Ogden pp.181,182,227&lt;/ref&gt;

The last sighting of Lincoln's ghost was in the early 1980s, when Tony Savoy, White House operations foreman, came into the White House and saw Lincoln sitting in a chair at the top of some stairs.&lt;ref name="Belanger" /&gt;

[[File:WILLIE.JPG|thumb|150px|[[William Wallace Lincoln|Willie Lincoln]], who died in the White House during his father's presidency]]
Abraham Lincoln is not the only Lincoln ghost witnesses claim to have seen in the White House. [[Willie Lincoln]], Abraham Lincoln's 11-year-old son, died in the White House of typhoid on February 20, 1862.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Herbert Donald|Donald, David Herbert]]. ''Lincoln.'' New York: Simon and Schuster, 1995. {{ISBN|0-684-80846-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Willie Lincoln's ghost was first reported to have been seen in the White House by staff members of the Grant administration in the 1870s, but reports have been made as recently as the 1960s. President Lyndon B. Johnson's college-age daughter, [[Lynda Bird Johnson Robb]], claims to have seen the ghost and talked to him.&lt;ref name="Norman" /&gt;

'''Linguistic frame of reference''' is a [[frame of reference]] as it is expressed in a language.&lt;br/&gt;
A frame of reference is a coordinate system used to identify location of an object. 
In languages different frames of reference can be used. They are: the Relative frame of reference, the Intrinsic frame of reference, and the Absolute frame of reference. Each frame of reference in a language can be associated with distinct linguistic expressions.

==Classification of frames of reference==
===Intrinsic frame of reference===
Intrinsic frame of reference is a binary spatial relation in which the location of an object is defined in relation to a part of another object (its side, back, front, etc.). For instance, "The cat is in front of the house." means that the cat is at that part of the house we call its front, the side of the house that faces the street and has an entrance and maybe a porch.

===Absolute frame of reference===
Absolute frame of reference is also a binary system in which the location of an object is defined in relation to arbitrary fixed bearings (for instance, [[cardinal directions]] (North, South, East, West)).  For instance, saying “The cat is to the south of the house” the location of the cat is described independently of the position of the speaker or of any part of the house (as in intrinsic frame of reference). Apart from cardinal directions, fixed bearings such as seacoast, upriver/downriver, and uphill/downhill/across are also used.

===Relative frame of reference===
Relative frame of reference is a ternary system. The location of an object is expressed in relation to both the viewpoint of the perceiver and position of another object. Thus saying “The cat is to the left of the house” we refer to three points of reference: the cat, the house, and the perceiver himself.

==Use of different frames of reference==
People can use multiple frames of reference in communication. For instance, in English all three frames of reference are available and used, however, the use of absolute frame of reference is limited to topographic objects ("Finland is to the east of Sweden."). The preferred frame of reference is the relative one.&lt;br/&gt;
Among the languages that rely largely on absolute frame of reference there are a lot of Australian aboriginal languages (for instance, [[Arrernte language]], [[Guugu Yimithirr language|Guugu Yimithirr]]) and some [[Mayan languages]] (for instance, [[Tzeltal language|Tzeltal]]). In Guugu Yimithirr there is no way to say "The cat is to the left of the house." and the only way to describe the location of the cat in relation to the house is "The cat is to the south of the house."&lt;br/&gt;
To the languages that rely largely on intrinsic frame of reference belong, for instance, Mopan (a Mayan language) or Totonac (a [[Totonacan languages|Totonacan language]]).&lt;br/&gt;
The use of different frames of reference has a far-reaching effect on the cognition. For instance, in order to be able to communicate in a language with absolute frame of reference the speakers have to run a kind of a mental compass, a remarkable neurocognitive capacity allowing the speakers to identify cardinal directions even in unfamiliar locations.

'''Lunate''' is a crescent or moon-shaped [[microlith]]. In the specialized terminology of [[lithic reduction]], a '''lunate flake''' is a small, crescent-shaped [[lithic flake|flake]] removed from a [[stone tool]] during the process of [[pressure flaking]].

In the [[Natufian culture|Natufian period]], a lunate was a small crescent-shaped stone tool that was sometimes used to harvest grasses.

In archaeology a lunate is a small stone artifact, that has a blunt straight edge and a sharpened crescent shaped back. 
The word originates from the Latin word lunatus which means to bend like a crescent, and from luna meaning moon in Latin. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/lunate |title=lunate - definition of lunate by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lunate object can be typically used as a decorative piece or as a stone tool.

==Israeli lunate==
In the earlier findings of Epipaleolithic lunate in the Natufian, Harifian, and Negev Kebaran periods in Israel they were roughly 10–40&amp;nbsp;mm long and were formed on small blades or bladelets. While the later findings Natufian and Harifian range of lengths varied then from 9–17&amp;nbsp;mm. In the later period the lunate resulted in 3 specific types.
# [[Helwan]] Backing (Bifacial)
# Plain Abrupt Backing
# Bipolar Backing (anvil)
The difference in the three types was also associated with the length of the lunate objects, with Helwan lunate normally being the longest and bipolar being the shortest. 
For unknown reasons the epipaleolithic lunate tool type disappeared and did not reappear until around the end of the 4th millennium B.C. 
These Lunate tools were most likely used as barbs in arrow shafts, or as transverse arrowheads coated with poison. The Lunate are also a very rare artifact from the Early Bronze Age because there was not as much emphasis on hunting during that period. The reappearance of Lunate after several millennia could shed some light on the hunting emphasis in the society. 
Lunate have been found as far north as the Azor tombs in Israel and was far south as south Sinai in this particular region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rosen |first=Steve A. |title=The Microlithic Lunate : An Old-New Tool Type from the Negev, Israel |journal=Paléorient |year=1983 |volume=9 |number=2 |pages=81–83 |doi=10.3406/paleo.1983.4345 |url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/paleo_0153-9345_1983_num_9_2_4345 |accessdate=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other cultural examples==
Lunate artefacts have been discovered among early [[Māori people|Māori]] stone carving in [[New Zealand]]. The original lunate pendant found in [[New Zealand]] appears to be of clear transparent [[pounamu]] (greenstone), from [[Ruapuke Island]], in [[Foveaux Strait]]. Its characteristics include a notched edge and the stone itself is thought to originate from Tangiwai, New Zealand. There was a second rare lunate-shaped object discovered in the New Zealand ethnological region as well.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A rare lunate pendant from New Zealand |first=G.

A handful of ancient societies shaped their tools in the form of lunate such as the [[Puebloan peoples]] who originated around [[San Juan County, Utah]]. There have also been findings of lunate used by Puebloan peoples dating back to the 3rd/4th millennium B.C.

'''Melones''' (also, '''Robinsons Ferry''' and '''Robinson's''')&lt;ref name=CGN&gt;{{California's Geographic Names|801}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a former settlement in [[Calaveras County, California|Calaveras County]], [[California]], now submerged beneath a [[reservoir]] named [[New Melones Lake]]. It lay at an elevation of 955 feet (291 m). Melones was founded on the site of a ferry operated from 1848 by John W. Robinson and Stephen Mead. The town initially took its name from the ferry.&lt;ref name=CGN/&gt;

The first post office opened in Robinsons Ferry in 1879, the name was changed to Robinson's in 1895, and to Melones in 1902.  The post office was closed in 1932, re-established in 1933 and closed for good in 1942.&lt;ref name=CGN/&gt;

In January 1923 Paramount Pictures chose Melones to construct a complete 1849 mining camp set there for the motion picture ''The Covered Wagon''. The studio sent an authentic Sierra Railroad train built in 1897 to the location via the Angels Branch line to Melones.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The site was submerged under [[New Melones Lake]] when the [[New Melones Dam]] finished construction and began to fill in April 1, 1978.

'''Midnight Madness''' is an annual event celebrating the upcoming [[college basketball]] [[season (sports)|season]] in which a team opens its first official practice to the public, often combining it with a pep rally and other fan-friendly activities. The tradition originated from teams holding public practices at midnight on the earliest day that the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) would allow a practice to be held. In 2013, a new NCAA rule established some flexibility around the opening of a team's practice sessions. As a result, the dates on which teams celebrate Midnight Madness can vary, but most stick with the traditional date of a Friday night closest to October 15.

==History==
[[File:Lefty Driesell.jpg|thumb|left|Maryland coach Lefty Driesell held the first "Midnight Madness" session in 1971.]]
Prior to the [[2013–14 NCAA Division I men's basketball season]] men's and women's basketball teams were not permitted to practice prior to the Friday closest to October 15. [[Maryland Terrapins men's basketball|Maryland Terrapins]] head coach [[Lefty Driesell]] began the Midnight Madness tradition at 12:03&amp;nbsp;a.m. on October 15, 1971 by inviting the public to a 1.5 [[mile]] team [[Running|run]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gRkIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=o0QDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4649,3131962&amp;dq=driesell+basketball+practice&amp;hl=en Sports Whirl], ''The Virgin Islands Daily News'', October 16, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; The early practice session was attended by 3,000 fans at the [[All-weather running track|track]] surrounding [[Maryland Stadium|Byrd Stadium]] on the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] campus.&lt;ref name=NMMfUUbt/&gt; Driesell continued the annual midnight practice session throughout his tenure at Maryland, and brought the tradition with him when he became [[head coach]] at [[Georgia State Panthers men's basketball|Georgia State University]]. In 2008, that school delayed the event until sunrise for the first time since Driesell established the tradition.&lt;ref name=LmrsatM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/ncb/s/2000/1011/812806.html|title=Lefty's midnight run started all the Madness|accessdate=November 30, 2008|date=October 13, 2007|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|work=[[ESPN.com]]|author=Rovell, Darren|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326190934/http://espn.go.com/ncb/s/2000/1011/812806.html|archivedate=March 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Big Blue Madness.jpeg|thumb|Big Blue Madness in 2015, at Rupp Arena in Lexington, Kentucky.]]
In 1982, coach [[Joe B. Hall]] and the [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball]] team began to officially promote a celebration dubbed "Midnight Madness" as a school event with formal entertainment acts and an invited student audience. This event was held in [[Memorial Coliseum (University of Kentucky)|Memorial Coliseum]] and held 8,500 people in the then-12,500 seat gym.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukathletics.com/news/sports_m-baskbl_spec-rel_101101aaa_html|title=Midnight Special - Celebrating 20 Years of Big Blue Madness|accessdate=November 30, 2015|date=October 11, 2001|publisher=[[Kentucky Wildcats|UKAthletics.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--The capacity of Memorial Coliseum is now 8,500, but it was 12,500 in 1982.--&gt; Big Blue Madness is now televised and hosts celebrities including [[Drake (musician)|Drake]], who performed in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courier-journal.com/story/sports/college/kentucky/2014/10/17/big-blue-madness-big-show-great-expectations/17468477|title=Big Blue Madness: big show, great expectations|accessdate=November 30, 2015|date=October 18, 2014|newspaper=[[The Courier-Journal]]|author=Jones, Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another of the more famous events is "Late Night in the [[Allen Fieldhouse|Phog]]" at Kansas, which was started in 1985 by [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]] and is now broadcast in live [[streaming video]] via the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kuathletics.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/101508aaa.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019032555/http://kuathletics.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/101508aaa.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 October 2008|title=Kansas Fans Can Witness|accessdate=December 3, 2008|date=October 15, 2008|publisher=[[CBS]] Interactive|work=Official Athletics Website of the University of Kansas}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event has caught on on most campuses; various programs have given away T-shirts and allowed players do stunt [[Slam dunk|dunk]]s and [[half court]] shots.&lt;ref name="NMMfUUbt"/&gt; Some schools schedule intrasquad scrimmages, [[Three-point field goal|three-point]] shooting contests and/or slam dunk contests. The event is often a co-ed event, in which both the men's and women's teams participate in the celebration, especially at schools like the [[University of Connecticut]], where the men's and women's teams have a combined 15 championships.&lt;ref name="CtcfMM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/15255167|title=Champs take court for Midnight Madness: Florida enjoyed last year’s title, but has turned all focus to this season|accessdate=November 30, 2008|date=October 13, 2006|publisher=NBC Universal}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Scout.com]]'' estimated that in 2007, approximately 160 of the top [[blue chip (sports)|blue chip]] high school basketball recruits in the country were attending a Midnight Madness event during the weekend that opens the basketball season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scouthoops.scout.com/a.z?s=75&amp;p=2&amp;c=689891&amp;ssf=1&amp;RequestedURL=http%3a%2f%2fscouthoops.scout.com%2f2%2f689891.html|title=On Campus: Midnight Madness|accessdate=December 1, 2008|date=October 12, 2007|publisher=ScoutHoops.com and Scout.com|author=Telep, Dave and Evan Daniels}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the NCAA ruled that men's practices could begin two weeks earlier than the traditional date, so long as teams held no more than 30 days of practice in the six weeks prior to the first regular-season game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/9240169/ncaa-oks-rule-move-start-practice|title=Midnight Madness to start earlier|accessdate=May 9, 2013|date=May 3, 2013|publisher=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This change was made to provide more flexible scheduling that accommodated off days in the preseason practice schedule.

In 2008, some teams attempted to host Midnight Madness in association with special early restricted practices instead of the first day of regular practices. These universities felt that since their football teams had [[home (sports)|home]] games the week before the opening date of formal practices, which had become the traditional Midnight Madness date, they would be better off holding Midnight Madness on the weekend before. In 2008, teams were allowed to practice two hours per week between September 15 and October 17 under what is known as the "Offseason Workout Rule,"&lt;ref name=KMcinbd/&gt; and at least four notable public "practice" sessions (by Illinois, Kentucky, Marshall and West Virginia) were held during these weekly practices before daily practices were permitted.&lt;ref name=UcMMawe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/blog/index?entryID=3577794&amp;name=katz_andy|title=UK celebrates Midnight Madness a week early|accessdate=December 1, 2008|date=September 9, 2008|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|author=Katz, Andy}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]], the [[Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball]] and [[Illinois Fighting Illini women's basketball|women's]] basketball teams hosted scrimmages at [[Memorial Stadium (Champaign)|Memorial Stadium]] after an October 11 game between the [[Illinois Fighting Illini football]] team and the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football]] team.&lt;ref name=Ihlohp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/27136216|title=Illini hosts largest outdoor hoops practice: Men's, women's teams play on a portable court at football stadium|accessdate=December 1, 2008|date=October 11, 2008|publisher=NBC Universal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the attendance for the football game was 62,870,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/boxscore?gameId=282850356|title=Minnesota 27, Illinois 20|accessdate=December 1, 2008|date=October 11, 2008|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt; this event was described as the "World's Largest Basketball Practice".

Kentucky was one of the schools that held their public practice event a week early in part because they could lure more recruiting prospects during a week when most other programs were not hosting similar events.&lt;ref name=KMcinbd/&gt; The [[National Association of Basketball Coaches]] asked the [[Southeastern Conference]] to force Kentucky to adhere to the traditionally scheduled practice to no avail.&lt;ref name=KMcinbd/&gt; They then belatedly petitioned the NCAA to legislate conformity unsuccessfully.&lt;ref name=KMcinbd/&gt; Kentucky coach [[Billy Gillispie]] had contacted the Kentucky's compliance office, the SEC and the NCAA to ensure that no rules were being violated.&lt;ref name=KMcinbd/&gt;

'''Molly Bloom''' is a [[fictional character]] in the novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' by [[James Joyce]]. The wife of main character [[Leopold Bloom]], she roughly corresponds to [[Penelope]] in the ''[[Odyssey]]''. The major difference between Molly and Penelope is that while Penelope is eternally faithful, Molly is not. Molly is having an affair with [[Blazes Boylan|Hugh 'Blazes' Boylan]]. Molly, whose given name is Marion, was born in [[Gibraltar]] on 8 September 1870, the daughter of Major Tweedy, an Irish military officer, and Lunita Laredo, a Gibraltarian of Spanish descent. Molly and Leopold were married on 8 October 1888. She is the mother of Milly Bloom, who, at the age of 15, has left home to study photography. She is also the mother of Rudy Bloom, who died at the age of 11 days. In Dublin, Molly is an opera singer of some renown.

The final chapter of ''Ulysses'', often called "[[Molly Bloom#Soliloquy|Molly Bloom's Soliloquy]]", is a long and unpunctuated [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream of consciousness]] passage comprising her thoughts as she lies in bed next to Bloom.

==Soliloquy==

Molly Bloom's [[soliloquy]] is the eighteenth and final "episode" of ''Ulysses'', in which the thoughts of Molly Bloom are presented in contrast to those of the previous narrators, [[Leopold Bloom]] and [[Stephen Dedalus]]. Molly's physicality is often contrasted with the intellectualism of the male characters, Stephen Dedalus in particular.

Joyce's novel presented the action with numbered "episodes" rather than named chapters. Most critics since [[Stuart Gilbert]], in his ''James Joyce's Ulysses'', have named the episodes and they are often called chapters. The final chapter is referred to as "Penelope", after [[Penelope|Molly's mythical counterpart]].

In the course of the monologue, Molly accepts Leopold into her bed, frets about his health, and then reminisces about their first meeting and about when she knew she was in love with him. The final words of Molly's reverie, and the very last words of the book, are:

{{quote|I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the [[Andalusia]]n girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the [[Moorish Wall]] and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes.}}

Joyce noted in a 1921 letter to [[Frank Budgen]] that "[t]he last word (human, all too human) is left to Penelope." The episode both begins and ends with "yes", a word that Joyce described as "the female word" and that he said indicated "acquiescence, self-abandon, relaxation, the end of all resistance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kenner|first=Hugh|title=Ulysses|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1987|isbn=0801833841|pages=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; This last, clear "yes" stands in sharp contrast to her unintelligible first spoken line in the fourth chapter of the novel.

Molly's soliloquy consists of eight enormous "sentences", The concluding period following the final words of her reverie is one of only two punctuation marks in the chapter, the periods at the end of the fourth and eighth "sentences".  When written this episode contained the longest "sentence" in English literature, 4,391 words expressed by Molly Bloom (it was surpassed in 2001 by [[Jonathan Coe]]'s ''[[The Rotters' Club (novel)|The Rotters' Club]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parody|first=Antal|title=Eats, Shites &amp; Leaves: Crap English and How to Use it|publisher=Michael O'Mara|year=2004|isbn=1-84317-098-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
Joyce modelled the character upon his wife, [[Nora Barnacle]]; indeed, the day upon which the novel is set — June 16, 1904, now called [[Bloomsday]] — is that of their first date. Nora Barnacle's letters also almost entirely lacked capitalization or punctuation; [[Anthony Burgess]] has said that "sometimes it is hard to distinguish between a chunk of one of Nora's letters and a chunk of Molly's final monologue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ingersoll|first=edited by Earl G.|title=Conversations with Anthony Burgess|year=2008|publisher=University press of Mississippi|location=Jackson|isbn=160473096X|pages=51|edition=1. printing.|author2=Ingersoll, Mary C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some research also points to another possible model for Molly in Amalia Popper, one of Joyce's students to whom he taught English while living in Trieste. Amalia Popper was the daughter of a Jewish businessman named Leopoldo Popper, who had worked for a European freight forwarding company (Adolf Blum &amp; Popper) founded in 1875 in its headquarters in Hamburg by [[Adolf Blum]], after whom Leopold Bloom was named. In the (now published) manuscript ''[[Giacomo Joyce]]'', are images and themes Joyce used in ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' and ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]''.

==Cultural references==
* [[J.M. Coetzee]]'s novel ''Elizabeth Costello'' portrays the fictional writer Costello as the author of a fictional novel, ''The House on Eccles Street'', which is written from Molly Bloom's point of view.
* It was the inspiration for the [[Kate Bush]] song "[[The Sensual World (song)|The Sensual World]]". Bush had originally written the song to directly quote ''Ulysses'', but Joyce's estate refused permission. Thus she wrote her own set of lyrics in a style that echoed Molly Bloom's soliloquy. Bush's 2011 album ''[[Director's Cut (Kate Bush album)|Director's Cut]]'' includes a newer version of the track ("Flower of the Mountain") with new vocals that use the original Joyce text.
* Molly Bloom's soliloquy was used as the basis for a dance song by [[Amber (performer)|Amber]], titled "Yes."
* The soliloquy is featured in a [[Rodney Dangerfield]] movie, ''[[Back to School]]'', wherein it is read aloud to a college English class by Dr. Diane Turner (played by [[Sally Kellerman]]).

'''Morphotactics''' represent the ordering restrictions in place on the ordering of [[morphemes]]. Etymologically, it can be translated as "the set of rules that define how morphemes (morpho) can touch (tactics) each other".

==Example of a morphotactic rules==
Many English [[affix]]es may only be attached directly to morphemes with particular [[part of speech|parts of speech]]:
* ''[[wikt:do#English|do]]'' + ''[[wikt:-able#English|-able]]'' + ''[[wikt:-ity#English|-ity]]'' = ''[[wikt:doability#English|doability]]''
but
* ''[[wikt:do#English|do]]'' + ''[[wikt:-ity#English|-ity]]'' + ''[[wikt:-able#English|-able]]'' = *''doityable''
The suffix ''[[wikt:-ity#English|-ity]]'' produces a noun from an adjective, and ''[[wikt:-able#English|-able]]'' creates [[abstract noun]]s from verbs.&lt;ref name="rohan"&gt;http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~gawron/compling/week3/morph.htm&lt;/ref&gt; To reverse the order violates the rules of English morphotactics, making the word [[Grammaticality|ungrammatical]] (marked with an [[Asterisk#Generative linguistics|asterisk]]).

==Common morphotactic model==

[[Finite-state machine]] and [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|Graph]] are the two models which are often used as a set of rules for morphotactics.

'''NNEST''' ({{IPAc-en|ɛ|n|ˈ|n|ɛ|s|t}} {{respell|en|NEST|'}}) or '''non-native English-speaking teachers''' is an [[acronym]] that refers to the growing body of English language teachers who speak [[English as a foreign or second language]]. The term was coined to highlight the dichotomy between [[native English-speaking teachers]] (NEST) and non-native English-speaking teachers (NNEST).

Issues related to NNESTs attract the attention of language teachers, language specialists, teacher educators, and graduate students from all over the world. [[TESOL International Association|TESOL]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tesol.org/|title=TESOL International Association|work=tesol.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Teachers of English to the Speakers of Other Languages) organization has a NNEST Interest Section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nnest.asu.edu|title=Home Page|work=asu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two local TESOL affiliates in [[North America]], [[WATESOL]] (Washington Area TESOL) and [[CATESOL]] (California TESOL) have NNEST entities.

==Native speaker vs. non-native speaker dichotomy==
Historically speaking, [[native speaker]] is defined as "the first language a human being learns to speak is his native language; he is a native speaker of this language" by [[Leonard Bloomfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Language |last=Bloomfield|first=Leonard|publisher=New York: Holt Rinehart Winston |year=1933|isbn=81-208-1196-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, [[theoretical linguistics]] realm placed [[native speaker]] construct into an idealized position and assumed that [[native speaker]] is the only reliable source of linguistic data by formulating the construct that of an "ideal speaker-listener, in a completely homogenous speech community", as defined by [[Noam Chomsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Aspects of Theory of Syntax |last=Chomsky |first=Noam |publisher=MIT Press|year=1965|isbn=978-0-262-53007-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, the construct has been critically discussed in the field of [[English language teaching]]. Some of the researchers argued that [[second language acquisition]] research under the dominance of idealized native speaker model creates a "monolingual bias in [[second language acquisition]] (SLA) theory",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Cook| first=Vivian | title= Monolingual bias in second language acquisition research | year=1997 | journal= Revista Canaria de Estudios Ingleses | volume=34 | pages=35–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  "elevates an idealized native speaker above a stereotypical 'nonnative' while viewing the latter as a defective communicator, limited by an underdeveloped communicative competence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.2307/329302 | last1=Firth| first1=Alan| last2=Wagner| first2=Johannes |title= On discourse, communication, and (some) fundamental concepts in SLA research | jstor=329302 | year=1997 | journal= Modern Language Journal| volume=81 | issue=3 | pages=285–300}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, it was further argued that the [[native speaker]] "exists only as a figment of linguist's imagination"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Native Speaker is Dead!|last=Paikeday |first=Thomas| publisher= Paikeday Publishing| year=1985|isbn= 0-920865-00-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and concluded that it is "more like a myth than a reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Native Speaker in Applied Linguistics|last=Davies|first=Alan|publisher= Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press|year=1991 |isbn=0-7486-0296-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status in ELT profession==
Problematic nature of the [[native speaker]]-[[non-native speaker]] dichotomy was blended with the growing body of literature discussing the unfair treatment and [[marginalization]] of [[non-native English-speaking teachers]] in the [[English language teaching|ELT]] profession. [[Robert Phillipson]] (1992) formulated "[[native speaker fallacy]]", which suggests that the ideal teacher of English is a native speaking teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Linguistic Imperialism | last=Phillipson |first=Robert| publisher= Oxford: Oxford University Press | year=1992 |isbn= 0-19-437146-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Being a non-native speaking teacher was considered to be a distinct quality by [[George Braine]] (1999)&lt;ref name=Braine1999&gt;{{Cite book |title= Non-native educators in English language teaching | last=Braine |first=George| publisher= Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Mahwah, New Jersey | year=1999 |isbn= 0-8058-3205-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; who argued that "the very fact that non-native speakers of a language have undergone the process of learning a language makes them better qualified to teach the language than those who are born to it". 
&lt;br /&gt; The inappropriateness of discriminatory practices against NNESTs in English language teaching profession was highlighted by George Braine (1999)&lt;ref name=Braine1999/&gt; as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...highly ironic, considering the profession's strident championing of multiculturalism, diversity, and other sociopolitical causes, often on behalf of ESL students and immigrants. Although ESL students are praised and admired for the multiculturalism and diversity they bring into language classes, non-native English teachers, who can contribute their rich multicultural, multilingual experiences, are often barred from the same classes."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; [[Peter Medgyes]] (1994)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= The non-native teacher | last=Medgyes |first=Peter| publisher= London: Macmillan| year=1994 |isbn= 0-333-60020-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; characterized [[native English-speaking teachers]] as informal, flexible, and confident and characterize NNEST as follows :
* good role models
* effective provider of learning strategies
* suppliers of information about the English language
* better anticipators of language learning difficulties
* sensitive to language learners' needs
* facilitators of language learning as a result of shared [[mother tongue]]
&lt;br&gt; A number of edited volumes were published on issues related to NNESTs.&lt;ref name=Braine1999/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Learning and Teaching from Experience: Perspectives on Nonnative English-speaking Professionals | last=Kamhi-Stein|first=Lia| publisher= The University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor| year=2004 |isbn= 0-472-08998-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Non-native language teachers: Perceptions, challenges, and contributions to the profession | last=Llurda |first=Enric| publisher= New York: Springer | year=2005 |isbn= 0-387-24565-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= The NNEST Lens: Nonnative English Speakers in TESOL | last=Mahboob |first=Ahmar| publisher= Newcastle: Cambridge Scholars Press | year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantages of using the term "NNEST"===
There are basically two arguments that support the use of term "[[non-native English-speaking teachers]]". First, it is believed that the term is necessary to distinguish between native and [[non-native English-speaking teachers]] as well as strengths attributed to these groups. Second, it is also believed that the term is necessary to highlight the [[discrimination]] based on the dichotomy.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

===Disadvantages of using the term "NNEST"===
Opponents of the term argue that "differentiating among teachers based on their status as native or nonnative speakers perpetuates the dominance of the native speaker in the ELT profession and contributes to discrimination in hiring practices"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Maum| first=Rosemarie| title=Nonnative-English-speaking-teachers in the English language profession| year=2002| journal=CAL Digest| url=http://www.cal.org/resources/Digest/digest_pdfs/0209maum.pdf| format=PDF| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411022957/http://www.cal.org/resources/Digest/digest_pdfs/0209maum.pdf| archivedate=2009-04-11| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;(Maum, 2002).
Below are some of the alternatives to replace the term "NNEST":
* Anglophone Teachers of English
* Bilingual English Speaking Teacher (BEST)
* Legitimate Teacher of English
* Transnational English Teacher
* Translinguistic English Teachers&lt;ref&gt;Motha, S., Jain, R., &amp; Tecle, T. (2012). Translinguistic Identity-As-Pedagogy: Implications for Teacher Education. International Journal of Innovation in English Language Teaching and Research, 1(1).&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Multilingual/Multicultural English-speaking Teachers
* Diverse English-speaking Teachers

==Discriminatory and anti-discriminatory practices==
&lt;br /&gt;Despite the fact that today, about 80% of English language teachers in the world are [[non-native English-speaking teachers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Reclaiming the Local in Language Policy and Practice | last=Canagarajah|first=Suresh| publisher= Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.| year=2005 |isbn= 0-8058-4593-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; English is no longer considered to be an exclusive possession of native speakers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Widdowson| first=Henry| title= The Ownership of English | year=1994 | journal= TESOL Quarterly| volume=28 | pages=377–389 | issue=2 | doi=10.2307/3587438}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it "belongs to all people who speak it, whether native and nonnative, whether ESL or EFL, whether standard or non-standard" (Norton 1997),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Norton| first=Bonny| title= Language, identity and the ownership of English | year=1997 | journal= TESOL Quarterly| volume=31 | pages=409–429 | issue=3 | doi=10.2307/3587831}}&lt;/ref&gt; NNESTs encounter discriminatory practices all around the world. There have been several research studies exploring the hiring preferences of administrators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Flynn| first1=Kathleen| first2=Gulikers|last2=Goedele |title= Issues in hiring nonnative English-speaking professionals to teach English as a Second Language| year=2001 | journal= CATESOL Journal | volume=13 | pages=151–161 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Status of Nonnative English Speakers as ESL Teachers in the United States |last=Mahboob |first=Ahmar| publisher= Ph.D. Dissertation, Indiana University| year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.system.2007.05.002 | last1=Clark| first1=Elizabeth| last2=Paran| first2=Amos |title= The employability of non-native-speaker teachers of EFL: A UK survey | year=2007 | journal= System | volume=35 | pages=407–430 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Native and non-native English-speaking English as a second language teachers: Student attitudes, teacher self-perceptions, and intensive English program administrator beliefs and practices |last=Moussu |first=Lucie| publisher= Ph.D. Dissertation, Purdue University| year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; which empirically demonstrated the importance of 'nativeness' as a job requirement. In addition, online job repositories such as [[Dave's ESL Café]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eslcafe.com/joblist/|title=Dave's ESL Cafe International Job Board - International Job Board|work=eslcafe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chronicle of Higher Education]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/jobs/100/|title=Find Jobs - Vitae|work=Vitae, the online career hub for higher ed}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[TESOL International Association|TESOL]]'s Online Career Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://careers.tesol.org/|title=TESOL International Association (TESOL), TESOL Career Center-Find Your Career Here|work=tesol.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; host job advertisements which include 'nativeness' as a job requirement.
Discriminatory practices against NNESTs in [[English language teaching]] generated a series of institutionalized anti-discriminatory practices such as "Statement on Nonnative Speakers of English and Hiring Practices"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=TESOL| first1= |title= Statement on Nonnative Speakers of English and Hiring Practices| year=1992 | journal= TESOL Matters | volume=2 | pages=23 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and "Position Statement against Discrimination of Nonnative Speakers of English in the Field of TESOL".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1=TESOL| first1= |title= Position Statement against Discrimination of Nonnative Speakers of English in the Field of TESOL | year= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it was decided in [[ASEAN]] 2005 Conference to establish "Centers for English Language Training" in [[South-East Asian]] countries to support local solutions to local needs by means of local tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Future of English |last=Graddol |first=David | publisher= London: British Council.|year=2006 |isbn=0-86355-356-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13480">'''Naturalistic pantheism''' is a kind of [[pantheism]]. It has been used in various ways such as to relate [[God]] or divinity with concrete things,&lt;ref&gt;Ethical and Religious Thought in Analytic Philosophy of Language by Quentin Smith, 1998, Yale University Press, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; determinism,&lt;ref name="Tillich"&gt;Paul Tillich: Theologian of the Boundaries by [[Paul Tillich]], Mark K. Taylor, Mark Lewis Taylor, Collins, 1987, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; or the substance of the [[Universe]].&lt;ref name="Panentheism"&gt;Panentheism--The Other God of the Philosophers, John W. Cooper, Baker Academic, 2006, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; God, from these perspectives, is seen as the aggregate of all unified natural phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Lectures on Divine Humanity by Vladimir Sergeyevich Solovyov, Lindisfarne Press, 1995, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase has often been associated with the philosophy of [[Baruch Spinoza]],&lt;ref name=Marvin&gt;''The history of European philosophy: an introductory book'' by Walter Taylor Marvin, Macmillan Company, 1917, p.&amp;nbsp;325: “Naturalistic pantheism had already made its appearance in the sixteenth century and most notably in the writings of Giordano Bruno; but its most famous teacher was the seventeenth century philosopher Benedict Spinoza.”&lt;/ref&gt; although academics differ on how it is used.

==Component definitions==
The term “pantheism" is derived from Greek words ''pan'' (Greek: πᾶν) meaning "all" and ''theos'' (θεός) meaning God. It was coined by [[Joseph Raphson]] in his work ''De spatio reali'', published in 1697.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ann Thomson]]; ''Bodies of Thought: Science, Religion, and the Soul in the Early Enlightenment'', 2008, page 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was introduced to English by Irish writer [[John Toland]] in his 1705 work ''Socinianism Truly Stated, by a pantheist'' that described pantheism as the "opinion of those who believe in no other eternal being but the universe."&lt;ref name=Toland&gt;{{cite web|last=Harrison|first=Paul|title=Toland: the father of modern pantheism|url=http://www.pantheism.net/paul/history/toland.htm|work=Pantheist History|publisher=World Pantheist Movement|accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "naturalistic" derives from the word "[[Naturalism (disambiguation)|naturalism]]", which has several meanings in philosophy and aesthetics.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;A Dictionary of Philosophy, ed. T. Mautner, Blackwell, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In philosophy the term frequently denotes the view that everything belongs to the world of nature and can be studied with the methods appropriate for studying that world, ''i.e.'' the sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Companion to Philosophy, ed. Ted Honderich, Oxford University Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; It generally implies an absence of belief in supernatural beings.&lt;ref name="Dictionary" /&gt;

==Early conceptions==
[[Joseph Needham]], a modern British scholar of Chinese philosophy and science, has identified [[Taoism]] as "a naturalistic pantheism which emphasizes the unity and spontaneity of the operations of Nature."&lt;ref&gt;Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 2, Joseph Needham, Cambridge University Press, 1956, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; This philosophy can be dated to the late 4th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, Russell. ''Taoism: The Enduring Tradition.'' (London and New York: Routledge, 2004). p. 61. {{ISBN|978-0-415-26321-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hellenistic Greek philosophical school of [[Stoicism]] (which started in the early 3rd century BCE)&lt;ref name="Stoicism"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/ Stoicism], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; rejected the [[Mind-body dualism|dualist]] idea of the separate ideal/conscious and material realms, and identified the substance of God with the entire cosmos and heaven.&lt;ref name="Panentheism" /&gt; However, not all philosophers who did so can be classified as naturalistic pantheists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooper|first=John W.|title=Panentheism: The Other God of the Philosophers: From Plato to the Present|year=2006|publisher=Baker Academic|page=16|quote=Naturalistic pantheism anticipates Bruno, Spinoza, Toland, Einstein (not Schelling, Hegel) defining God in terms of Nature should not be construed as naturalistic pantheism. By "Nature" Eriugena means something like "Reality" rather than the mere physical universe. "But his position is in fact closer to the naturalistic pantheism of ancient Stoicism. The World-Soul is not a higher reality that generates the physical world but the rational causal agent immanent in the world"...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern conceptions==
Naturalistic pantheism was expressed by various thinkers,&lt;ref name=Marvin /&gt; including [[Giordano Bruno]], who was burned at the stake for his views.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, William (prof. of philosophy at the Catholic University), "History of Philosophy", 1903, p. 429&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 17th century Dutch philosopher Spinoza became particularly known for it.&lt;ref name=Marvin /&gt;

===Baruch Spinoza===
{{Main|Philosophy of Spinoza}}
Possibly drawing upon the ideas of Descartes,&lt;ref&gt;Elements of general philosophy By George Croom Robertson, p. 282
:"The pantheistic element in Descartes’ thought viz. the tendency to conceive the notion of substance in the truest sence as being only One, and the naturalistic element, viz. the tendency to conceive the One Substance of God as Order of Nature, were brought together and set in the front of Spinoza’s thought as the mother-idea of it all…Spinoza’s philosophy remains as yet and is likely to remain, the very type of a Naturalistic Pantheism."&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Spinoza|Baruch Spinoza]] connected God and Nature through the phrase ''deus sive natura'' ("God, or Nature"),&lt;ref&gt;Elements of General Philosophy, George Croom Robertson, John Murray, 1896, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Arnold: Between Two Worlds, AJ Lubell, Modern Language Quarterly, 1961, Duke University Press, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Concise Dictionary of Theology by Gerald O'Collins, Edward G. Farrugia, Paulist Press, 2000, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; making him the father of [[classical pantheism]]. He relied upon rationalism rather than the more intuitive approach of some Eastern traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Philosophies of History: Meeting of East and West in Cycle-pattern ... Grace Edith Cairns, 1962
:This attitude is close to that of Spinoza's naturalistic pantheism in the West although Spinoza reached it by the more characteristically Western method, rationalism, versus the intuitive way of the Taoists&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinoza's philosophy, sometimes known as [[Spinozism]], has been understood in a number of ways, and caused disagreements such as the [[Pantheism controversy]]. However, many scholars have considered it to be a form of naturalistic pantheism. This has included viewing the pantheistic unity as natural.&lt;ref name=Pafumi&gt;{{cite book|last=Pafumi|first=G.R.|title=Is Our Vision of God Obsolete|year=2010|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=1441590404|page=153|quote=Spinoza = naturalistic pantheism — universe as a "single, interconnected, and solely natural substance."}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Others focus on the deterministic aspect of naturalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tillich|first=Paul|title=Paul Tillich: Theologian of the Boundaries|year=1987|publisher=Collins|location=London|isbn=9780800634032|page=165|edition=1. Fortress Press|author2=Taylor, Mark Kline|quote=Naturalistic pantheism "denies finite freedom" as in Spinoza (as opposed to idealistic type of pantheism which identifies God with the universal essence of being)...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christian philosophy, God: being a contribution to a philosophy of theism by John Thomas Driscoll, Benzinger 1904, p. 190
:“In the criticism of his system we meet with the same difficulties that we find in Spinoza, i.e., the nature of the mind and of matter, the character of their interaction and the doctrine of determinism. Both Spinoza and Spencer teach a pure Naturalism … The two theories set forth are phases of Realistic or Naturalistic Pantheism.”&lt;/ref&gt;
Spinoza inspired a number of other pantheists, with varying degrees of idealism towards nature.&lt;ref&gt;
Goethe, Nietzsche, And Wagner: Their Spinozan Epics of Love And Power by T. K. Seung, p. 11
:“The second function of the Earth Spirit was to clarify Goethe’s own version of pantheism. With the revival of Spinoza’s philosophy, naturalistic pantheism became a groundswell for the German intellectuals of Goethe’s generation. Although they rejected the other world, many of them subscribed to an idealistic or Romantic view of Nature, which Goethe regarded as an unreal view of reality…”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The five great skeptical dramas of history by John Owen (theologian), 1896, p. 13
:“If he could be said to have owned a master of philosophy it was Spinoza. Of none other does he speak in such terms of commendation … In all probability Spinoza found his greatest disciple on the road to a naturalistic pantheism.”&lt;/ref&gt; However, Spinoza's influence in his own time was limited.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Ethics by Adolf Wuttke (theologian), 1876, p. 289, p. 327
:“Spinoza exerted in his own age but little influence. Notwithstanding the deep spiritually-moral declension of that dark period, the religious God-consciousness was as yet too vital to fall in with this naturalistic pantheism.”&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Arnold: Between Two Worlds, AJ Lubell, Modern Language Quarterly, 1961, Duke University Press... Page 5
:"the naturalistic pantheism he then or somewhat later learned from Spinoza"&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have considered Spinoza the founder of a line of naturalistic pantheism, though not necessarily the only one.&lt;ref&gt;Nothingness in the theology of Paul Tillich and Karl Barth by Sung Min Jeong University Press of America, 2003, p. 24
:"Spinoza establishes a naturalistic pantheism. Tillich considers Spinoza’s substance as a category"...&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Finger Thomas (prof of religious thought), "Philosophy and religious belief", 1970, p. 92
:"..two forms of pantheism we have distinguished, idealistic monism and naturalistic pantheism. Here we shall consider only the naturalistic pantheism we have been describing, especially that of Spinoza."&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;The riddle of the universe by Edward Douglas, London: Fawcett, 1893, p. 30
:"Spinoza carried philosophy into the realms of a naturalistic pantheism."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===
In 1705 the Irish writer [[John Toland]] endorsed a form of pantheism in which the God-soul is identical with the material universe.&lt;ref name=Toland /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Materialism in Eighteenth-Century European Thought" in New Dictionary of the History of Ideas, 2005, ed. Peter Machamer and Francesca di Poppa&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Middle Works of John Dewey, Volume 2, SIU Press, 1976, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

German naturalist [[Ernst Haeckel]] (1834–1919&lt;ref&gt;"Ernst Haeckel – Britannica Concise" (biography), ''Encyclopædia Britannica Concise'', 2006, Concise. Britannica.com webpage: [http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9366404/Ernst-Haeckel CBritannica-Haeckel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111013059/http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9366404/Ernst-Haeckel |date=2006-11-11 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;) proposed a monistic pantheism in which the idea of God is identical with that of nature or substance.&lt;ref&gt;The Presbyterian and reformed review, Volume 7, Anson D.F. Randolph, 1896, p217&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Pantheist Movement]], started in 1999, describes Naturalistic Pantheism as including reverence for the universe, [[Philosophical realism|realism]], [[metaphysical naturalism|strong naturalism]], and respect for reason and the scientific method as methods of understanding the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is your spiritual home right here on Earth?|url=http://www.pantheism.net|publisher=World Pantheist Movement|accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Harrison (pantheist)|Paul Harrison]] considers its position the closest modern equivalent to Toland's.&lt;ref name=Toland /&gt;

'''''Never Again the Burning Times: Paganism Revisited''''' is an [[anthropology|anthropological]] study of the [[Wicca]]n and wider [[Paganism (contemporary)|Pagan]] community in the United States. It was written by the American anthropologist Loretta Orion and published by Waveland Press in 1995.

The reviews published in specialist academic journals were largely negative, and while accepting that Orion had made note of some interesting insights, they criticized her for promoting and defending, rather than analyzing, the religious movement that she was discussing, something that they attributed to her openly Pagan beliefs.

==Background==

===Paganism and Wicca in the United States===

Contemporary Paganism, which is also referred to as Neo-Paganism, is an [[umbrella term]] used to identify a wide variety of [[new religious movement|modern religious movements]], particularly those influenced by or claiming to be derived from the various [[Paganism|pagan]] beliefs of pre-modern Europe.&lt;ref name="Carpenter 1996 40"&gt;[[#Car96|Carpenter 1996]]. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew04|Lewis 2004]]. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The religion of Pagan Witchcraft, or [[Wicca]], was developed in England during the first half of the 20th century and is one of several Pagan religions. The figure at the forefront of Wicca's early development was the English occultist [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] (1884&amp;ndash;1964), the author of ''[[Witchcraft Today]]'' (1954) and ''[[The Meaning of Witchcraft]]'' (1959) and the founder of a tradition known as [[Gardnerian Wicca]]. Gardnerian Wicca revolved around the veneration of both a [[Horned God]] and a [[Mother Goddess]], the celebration of eight seasonally-based festivals in a [[Wheel of the Year]] and the practice of magical rituals in groups known as [[coven]]s. Gardnerianism was subsequently brought to the U.S. in the early 1960s by an English initiate, [[Raymond Buckland]] (1934&amp;ndash;), and his then-wife Rosemary, who together founded a coven in [[Long Island]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]] pp. 205&amp;ndash;252.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. pp. 24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., new variants of Wicca developed, including [[Dianic Wicca]], a tradition founded in the 1970s which was influenced by [[second wave feminism]], emphasized female-only covens, and rejected the veneration of the Horned God. One initiate of both the Dianic and Gardnerian traditions was a woman known as [[Starhawk]] (1951&amp;ndash;) who went on to found her own tradition, [[Reclaiming (Neopaganism)|Reclaiming Wicca]], as well as publishing ''[[The Spiral Dance|The Spiral Dance: a Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess]]'' (1979), a book which helped spread Wicca throughout the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. pp. 340&amp;ndash;351&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. pp. 122&amp;ndash;123&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic fieldwork into Paganism===

Prior to Berger's work, several American researchers working in the field of [[Pagan studies]] had separately published investigations of the Pagan community in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The first of these had been the practicing Wiccan, journalist and political activist [[Margot Adler]] in her ''[[Drawing Down the Moon (book)|Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today]]'', which was first published by [[Viking Press]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Adl79|Adler 1979]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A second study was produced by the anthropologist [[Tanya Luhrmann|Tanya M. Luhrmann]] in her ''[[Persuasions of the Witch's Craft|Persuasions of the Witch's Craft: Ritual Magic in Contemporary England]]'' (1989), in which she focused on both a Wiccan coven and several ceremonial magic orders that were then operating in London.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Luh89|Luhrmann 1989]].&lt;/ref&gt;

| style="text-align: left;" |"It is essentially a text more concerned with promoting and defending this religious movement than it is a sociological analysis of it. This is probably inevitable. As Alistaire Maclntryre once observed, believers in a religious system cannot easily analyze that system sociologically or anthropologically."

|}

In a largely negative review published in the ''Anthropos'' journal, T.O. Beidelman called ''Never Again the Burning Times'' a "contradictory  work", believing that whilst it was "fascinating" as "a compilation of ethnographic material describing what many neopagans in contemporary America believe and do", he also felt that "as a social analysis" it was "very muddled". Expressing concern over Orion's Pagan beliefs and the influence that these had over her study, he felt that much of the logic used in the book was "weak", and that her "analytical efforts" were "equally unsatisfactory". Furthermore, he argued that whilst "it is always helpful for a researcher to have sympathy with any group she or he studies", Orion's study was "more a missionary tract than social analysis", with an emphasis on portraying the contemporary Pagan movement in a positive light.&lt;ref name="Beidelman 1995"/&gt; Ultimately, Beidelman felt that he "cannot recommend this as a sociological or anthropological analysis or even as a reliable historical account of the origins or meaning of beliefs about witches in anthropology or in Western culture in general." Nonetheless, he did feel that he can "warmly recommend this as an absorbing account of what one educated and thoughtful person may think after being converted to contemporary neopagan beliefs and having joined such a religious movement."&lt;ref name="Beidelman 1995"/&gt;

The anthropologist [[Tanya Luhrmann]] (1959&amp;ndash;) of the [[University of California, San Diego]] &amp;ndash; who had previously authored ''Persuasions of the Witches' Craft: Ritual Magic in Contemporary England'' (1989) &amp;ndash; also published a predominantly negative review of the book, this time in the ''Journal of Anthropological Research'', in which she also reviewed another study of Wicca that had been published in the mid-1990s, Allen Scarboro, Nancy Campbell and Shirley Stave's ''[[Living Witchcraft|Living Witchcraft: A Contemporary American Coven]]''.  Describing ''Never Again the Burning Times'', Luhrmann stated that it was "an insider's book with a scholar's surface, and while it has the appeal of an apologia, it also has the gullibility of a book on the occult rather than a distanced perspective on it." She proceeded to discuss how Orion "writes as if she uncritically accepted the practitioners' understanding of their history and their actions", criticizing Orion's belief in [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] as a real physical force. Luhrmann goes on to cast a critical eye on many of Orion's claims, believing that many of her statements have a "naive, unscholarly feel" and states her surprise that in the book Orion "implies that pagan healing is more effective than modern medicine". On a more positive note, Luhrmann comments that "Orion paints a good and interesting portrait of witchcraft" that contains some "important data", with particular praise for Orion's discussion of the issue of "how our fantasy life relates to our mental health".&lt;ref name="Luhrmann 1996"&gt;[[#Luh96|Luhrmann 1996]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nichita P. Smochină''' ({{IPA-ro|niˈkita smoˈkinə}}, [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet|Moldovan Cyrillic]]: Никита Смокинэ, ''Nikita Smokine''; also known as '''M. Florin'''; March 14, 1894 – December 14, 1980) was a [[Transnistria]]n-born activist, scholar and political figure, especially noted for campaigning on behalf of [[Romanians|ethnic Romanians]] in the [[Soviet Union]]. He was first active in the [[Russian Empire]], serving with distinction in [[World War I]], then in the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]], where he earned his reputation as a champion of Transnistrian Romanian interests. An [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]], he narrowly escaped the [[Bolshevik]]s and crossed into [[Romania]], which became his second home. A protégé of historian [[Nicolae Iorga]], Smochină earned his academic credentials and also made himself known internationally as an expert on [[minority rights]]. Beginning in the 1920s, he contributed to historical research, [[ethnography]] and [[folkloristics]], as well as [[jurisprudence]].

During most of [[World War II]], Smochină backed the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] regime of [[Ion Antonescu]] and paid service to [[Gheorghe Alexianu]]'s [[Transnistria Governorate]]. His scientific work included a recovery of pre-Bolshevik or [[Russophobia|anti-Russian]] [[Romanian folklore]] in Transnistria and beyond. Such activities, along with his exposure of Soviet brutality, made him a wanted man once the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] took over in Romania. He was eventually captured, sent to prison and deprived of his academic honors. Partly reinstated by the late 1960s, he spent his final decades encouraging the second-generation communist authorities to take a firmer stand against controversial Soviet policies such as "[[Moldovenism]]".

==Biography==

===Origins and early life===
Nichita Smochină was born on the confines of historical [[Moldavia]] and [[Bessarabia]]: the entire Transnistrian region was at the time part of the Russian [[Kherson Governorate]]. As he himself later recounted, the bountiful eastern bank of the [[Dniester]] was home to a thriving Romanian community, or, as he put it, a veritable "Romanian [[California]]".&lt;ref&gt;Datcu, p.15–16&lt;/ref&gt; His later research traced the first Romanian presence in that area to the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], revived by the [[Cossack Hetmanate]]'s border policy, particularly in the 1650s.&lt;ref name="ansdincolo2"&gt;{{ro icon}} Alex. N. Smochină, [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/dacia/BCUCLUJ_FP_3503_1941_001_0005.pdf "Moldova de dincolo de Nistru"], in ''Dacia'', Nr. 5/1941, p.2 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, there were two main stages in the migration and resettlement of Moldavian peasants to what became his homeland. The first was under [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Moldavian Prince]] [[George Ducas]] (late 17th century); the second under [[List of Russian rulers|Russian Empress]] [[Catherine the Great]].&lt;ref name="nb104"&gt;Băieșu, p.104&lt;/ref&gt; Smochină spoke in detail about the Romanian colonies of 18th-century "[[Novorossiya|New Russia]]", that reached as far east as [[Oleksandriya]].&lt;ref name="ansdincolo2"/&gt;

The Smochinăs themselves were descendants of Romanian yeomen (''răzeși''), originally from Moldavia,&lt;ref name="ic(10)237"&gt;Constantin (2010), p.237&lt;/ref&gt; and reportedly spoke an archaic variant of the [[Romanian language]]. The literary historian [[Al. Husar]], who met Smochină in the 1940s, recalled that his use of the [[Moldavian subdialect of Romanian|eastern dialect]] had the "scent of ages", and "seemed to me a wonder of the Romanian language."&lt;ref name="viahcaract"&gt;{{ro icon}} Vasile Iancu, [http://www.romlit.ro/al._husar_caracterul_d_autoritate_sacerdoiului_critic "Al. Husar: 'Caracterul dă autoritate sacerdoțiului critic' "] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714135641/http://www.romlit.ro/al._husar_caracterul_d_autoritate_sacerdoiului_critic# |date=2014-07-14 }}, in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 24/2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Smochină's place of birth was [[Corjova, Dubăsari|Mahala]] village, on the eastern, non-Bessarabian, shore of the Dniester.&lt;ref name="annistru"&gt;{{ro icon}} Adrian Neculau, [http://www.ziaruldeiasi.ro/opinii/un-roman-de-peste-nistru~ni76rp "Un român de peste Nistru"], in ''[[Ziarul de Iași]]'', March 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chelaru ''et al.'', p.16; Constantin (2010), p.237; Datcu, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his primary education in [[Dubăsari]] (''Dubossary''), he went to a Russian [[Cadet Corps (Russia)|Cadet school]]&lt;ref name="ic(10)237"/&gt;&lt;ref name="annistru"/&gt; and, reportedly, worked as a clerk for Dubăsari Tribunal.&lt;ref name="mttrnistreanul"&gt;{{ro icon}} Mihai Tașcă, [http://adevarul.ro/moldova/politica/arhivele-comunismului-vezi-fost-transnistreanul-a-romanizat-moldovenii-1_50acd5bd7c42d5a6638a6e76/index.html "Vezi cine a fost transnistreanul care 'a românizat moldovenii' "], in ''[[Adevărul Moldova]]'', December 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He was interested in philology and, with time, became one of the few Romanian experts in the study of [[Old Church Slavonic]].&lt;ref name="annistru"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ic(10)238"&gt;Constantin (2010), p.238&lt;/ref&gt; When World War I erupted, he was serving in the [[Imperial Russian Army]]. His services were rewarded with the [[Order of St. George]] and thus joined the ranks of [[Russian nobility]].&lt;ref name="annistru"/&gt; 

The [[February Revolution]] caught Smochină behind the [[Caucasus Campaign|Caucasian Front]]. He was appointed military delegate by a Congress of Peoples in [[Tbilisi]], sent over to [[Petrograd]] for negotiations with the [[Petrograd Soviet|Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies]] (summer 1917).&lt;ref name="annistru"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dnc&amp;al16"&gt;Chelaru ''et al.'', p.16&lt;/ref&gt; As he later noted, he happened to hear a speech given by [[Vladimir Lenin]], leader of the ultra-revolutionary Bolshevik faction, who was working to topple the [[Russian Provisional Government]]. Smochină was intrigued by Lenin's promise of [[self-determination]] for all of Russia's minorities: "As a Moldavian, I found this issue to be one of greatest interest".&lt;ref name="dnc&amp;al16"/&gt; Smochină was interested in finding out Lenin's level of commitment in this respect, and was received for an interview (as he recalled, this was only possible because one of Lenin's bodyguards was originally from Mahala).&lt;ref name="dnc&amp;al16"/&gt;

According to Smochină's own rendition of the encounter, when asked about his vision on the Moldavian question, Lenin began by stating: "You Moldavians have no interest in fighting on the side of Russia, who for centuries now has been enslaving your kind. Culturally, Moldavians are far more advanced than Russians."&lt;ref name="annistru"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chelaru ''et al.'', p.17; Datcu, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; The thing to do, Lenin said, was for Moldavians to take up arms and fight against the two "oppressors": Russia and "landowners' Romania".&lt;ref&gt;Chelaru ''et al.'', p.16–17; Datcu, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; According to Smochină, Lenin openly agreed that Moldavians, Bessarabians and Romanians were in essence [[Controversy over linguistic and ethnic identity in Moldova|the same demonym]]: "Take inspiration from your Romanian blood brothers, but, again, beware of falling into the paws of Romanian [[boyar]] exploiters. [...] all Moldavians are Romanians".&lt;ref&gt;Chelaru ''et al.'', p.17&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Bolshevik theorist appears to have incited the Transnistrians and Bessarabians to spread the flame of revolution into "boyar Romania", to "drown the hell out of the [[King of Romania|Romanian king]] and set up a Soviet Romania".&lt;ref&gt;Chelaru ''et al.'', p.17. Partly rendered in Datcu, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, Lenin also urged the Transnistrian delegate to personally to sabotage the war effort on the Caucasus Front, fraternize with the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] and demand "[[Petrograd formula|peace without annexations or indemnities]]".&lt;ref&gt;Chelaru ''et al.'', p.17; Datcu, p.16–17&lt;/ref&gt; As some Romanian historians have noted, "Lenin was not about to curb [a nation's independence], but did not specify in sufficiently clear terms what would happen if they should want to achieve self-determination in any social order other than communism."&lt;ref name="dnc&amp;al16"/&gt;

===Ukrainian deputy and Romanian refugee===
Smochină returned to his place of origin, which was being progressively included in the newly emancipated [[Ukrainian People's Republic]], and began defending the interests of local Romanians. As head of the Mahala ''[[Zemstvo]]'', he tried to prevent the breakdown of social and military order, and narrowly escaped with his life after being pursued by the [[Rumcherod|Bolshevik committees]].&lt;ref name="annistru"/&gt; In December 1917, after a pro-Romanian [[Moldavian Democratic Republic]] had taken root in Bessarabia, he and [[Gheorghe Mare]] were involved with the [[Separatism|separatist]] Congress of Transnistrian Moldavians in [[Tiraspol]], where they flew the [[Flag of Romania|Romanian tricolor]].&lt;ref name="ndtreiculori"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Nicolae Dabija (politician)|Nicolae Dabija]], [http://www.literaturasiarta.md/printpress.php?l=ro&amp;idc=164&amp;idc1=246&amp;id=1850 "''Trei culori...''"], in ''[[Literatura și Arta]]'', October 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Smochină stated: "We love our Country so much, that even our [[Romanian icons|icons]] look to Romania."&lt;ref name="ndtreiculori"/&gt; By 1918, he had become Prefect of Tiraspol, then regional envoy to the [[Central Council of Ukraine|Central Rada]] of [[Kiev]], the Ukrainian capital.&lt;ref&gt;Datcu, p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the [[union of Bessarabia with Romania]] had been effected on the western side of Transnistria, whereas the region itself was made part of the Bolshevik [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], as the [[Moldavian Autonomous Oblast]]. Smochină's experience of Bolshevik rule was painful, and he recalled [[war communism]] as a trauma: "their entire property taken away, [Romanians in Transnistria] were left naked, downtrodden, worse off than during slavery".&lt;ref name="id17"&gt;Datcu, p.17&lt;/ref&gt; He escaped Soviet Ukraine on 25 December 1919, and crossed the Dniester into [[Greater Romania]], settling in the former Moldavian capital of [[Iași]].&lt;ref name="annistru"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mttrnistreanul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Datcu, p.15, 18&lt;/ref&gt; According to Smochină, his relatives were exposed to violent Bolshevik reprisals: his father and his female cousin were shot, and the rest were deported to [[Siberia]].&lt;ref name="id18"&gt;Datcu, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; His wife Agafia escaped with him, but Alexandru was left behind. He joined them in 1922, when a courier commissioned by the father took him over to Iași.&lt;ref name="mttrnistreanul"/&gt; In Romania, the couple had another daughter, baptized Claudia.&lt;ref name="cineseteme"&gt;{{ro icon}} Ilie Gulca, Vlad Galin-Corini, [http://www.jurnal.md/ro/news/cine-se-teme-de-nichita-smochina-222611/ "Cine se teme de Nichita Smochină?"], in ''[[Jurnal de Chișinău]]'', July 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Iași, Smochină met with jurist Ioan Teodorescu, who helped him enroll at the [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza University|Iași University]] Department of Philosophy and Law.&lt;ref name="annistru"/&gt; He graduated in 1924,&lt;ref name="id15"&gt;Datcu, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; having by then also studied Psychology with [[Constantin Fedeleș]].&lt;ref name="annistru"/&gt; Smochină joined up with other Transnistrian refugee students during his college term, and militated for increased awareness of their situation; however, he was also a critic of all Romanians arriving from Russia, noting that the [[Education in Russia|Russian education system]] left them poorly trained and superficial.&lt;ref name="annistru"/&gt; He first began associating with a circle of Bessarabian Romanians, and became friends with [[Bessarabian Peasants' Party]] founder [[Pan Halippa]],&lt;ref name="id17"/&gt; heralding humanitarian projects to feed and integrate refugee children.&lt;ref name="annistru"/&gt; It was during those years that Nichita Smochină befriended the senior historian and nationalist politician [[Nicolae Iorga]], a professor at the [[University of Bucharest]]. As early as 1922, he was invited by Iorga's [[Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians]] to attend their [[Curtea de Argeș]] Congress and speak about Transnistrian grievances.&lt;ref name="annistru"/&gt;

Nichita Smochină also joined the [[Freemasonry in Romania|Romanian Freemasonry]] (the "[[Vasile Alecsandri]]" [[Masonic Lodge|Lodge]]), and, according to his own recollections, lectured other Masons on the plight of Transnistrians.&lt;ref name="id17"/&gt; Smochină met celebrated novelist [[Mihail Sadoveanu]], who was later the [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] of a Freemasonry branch. There was mutual dislike between the two: Smochină accused Sadoveanu of trafficking Freemasonry's services, of not being moved by the fate of Transnistria, and of ultimately destroying other Masons who crossed his path.&lt;ref&gt;Datcu, p.17–18&lt;/ref&gt; The Transnistrian activist despised two other figures from Romania's left-wing [[Poporanism|Poporanist]] camp, [[Alexandru Mîță]] and fellow Mason [[Gheorghe Stere]], both of whom he depicted as unprincipled agents of Bolshevism.&lt;ref&gt;Constantin (2010), p.145–146&lt;/ref&gt;

This phase coincided with Soviet Transnistria's elevation in administrative status—that is, the establishment of a [[Moldavian ASSR]] on Oblast territory, in the newly proclaimed [[Soviet Union]]. Although refugees were convinced that the Soviet Union was "a [[prison of the peoples]]",&lt;ref name="annistru"/&gt; Smochină and some of his colleagues gave positive review to the move, seeing it as an implicit recognition of Moldavian (and therefore Romanian) self-rule.&lt;ref name="ck181"&gt;King, p.181&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic debut and Parisian studies===
From 1924, Smochină's overviews of Transnistrian Romanian life were published with regularity in Iorga's ''[[Ramuri]]'' and ''[[Drum Drept]]'' magazines.&lt;ref name="id15"/&gt; In 1924, the former published his contributions to the ethnography of Romanian communities located between the Dniester and the [[Taurida Governorate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [[Nicolae Iorga]], [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k55471351.image.r= "Comptes-rendus.

Romanian researcher Petre Popescu Gogan describes Smochină as: "a man of The Law, with a calling for human rights and the rights of peoples [...]. Asked to have his say on the issue of [[Minority rights|Minority Rights]], [he] worked in the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Romania)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] and took part in international congresses on the matter."&lt;ref name="ppgmemento!"&gt;{{ro icon}} Petre Popescu Gogan, [http://revista.memoria.ro/?location=view_article&amp;id=351 "Memento!"], in ''Memoria.

He was sponsored by Iorga, who awarded him a scholarship and put him up for the Romanian School of [[Fontenay-aux-Roses]], receiving some more assistance from Halippa.&lt;ref name="id17"/&gt; He focused his research on recovering old texts from sources such as the ''[[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale]]'' and ''[[Centre d'Études Russes Saint-Georges|Musée Slave]]''.&lt;ref name="annistru"/&gt; In the end, he took a [[Ph.D.]] in History, with [[Ferdinand Lot]] as his [[doctoral advisor]].&lt;ref name="annistru"/&gt; He also began teaching Romanian at ''Société pour la Propagation des Langues Etrangères'', a [[learned society]] funded by the [[University of Paris]].&lt;ref name="annistru"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rremigres288"&gt;{{fr icon}} R.

Concentrating on informing the world decision-makers about the Transnistrian question, Nichita Smochină was, in 1930, a delegate to [[International Congress of National Minorities]] (a [[League of Nations]] partnership).&lt;ref name="annistru"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Constantin (2010), p.238; Datcu, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; While in [[Paris]], he also set up the Aid Committee for Moldavian Transnistrian Refugees,&lt;ref&gt;Datcu, p.15; King, p.181. See also Constantin (2010), p.238&lt;/ref&gt; and campaigned for the international condemnation of reported Soviet mass murders in Transnistria (1932).&lt;ref name="annistru"/&gt; At the time, Smochină's pro-Romania group was challenged by the Soviet-funded Association of Bessarabian Émigrés, whose platform was the whole absorption of Bessarabia into the Moldavian ASSR.&lt;ref&gt;King, p.52&lt;/ref&gt;

His scholarly work included a biographical sketch on [[Danylo Apostol|Danylo (Dănilă) Apostol]], the 18th-century Moldavian ''[[Hetman]]'' of [[Left-bank Ukraine]]. It saw print in Romania in 1930, together with his monograph on Moldavian mercenaries fighting on either side of the [[Great Northern War]].&lt;ref name="ansdincolo2"/&gt; The Apostol book was then reprinted in the [[popular history]] collection ''Cunoștințe utile'' ("Useful Knowledge").&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/scoalanoastra/1933/BCUCLUJ_FP_279959_1933_010_003.pdf "Cărți, reviste.

Gamber'' published his monograph on [[Ion Brătianu]], the founder of [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|Romanian liberalism]], focusing on Brătianu's trial for sedition in 1850s France. The work was reviewed by ''[[Revue des Questions Historiques]]'', which noted that Smochină's style lacked "order" and "clarity", and could prove chronologically inaccurate.&lt;ref name="rremigres288"/&gt; At around that time, the Transnistrian researcher announced that he was also preparing an overview of the Freemasonry's contribution to the [[United Principalities|first union of Romania]] (1859).&lt;ref name="rremigres288"/&gt;

===''Moldova Nouă'' and 1930s research===
In January 1935, Smochină launched a new periodical, titled ''Moldova Nouă'' ("New Moldavia"). Its opening manifesto, expressing a program of the Cultural Association of Transnistrians, promised to provide the Romanian public with a "generic culture" on the Moldavian life in Soviet lands, and to follow the principles of "objectivity, scientific truth [and] the national idea".&lt;ref name="darideseama414-415"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/tarabarsei/1935/BCUCLUJ_FP_280068_1935_007_004.pdf "Dări de seamă.

His essays there included the 1936 review of the Moldavian ASSR's standard [[Primer (textbook)|primer]] ''Kuvyntu nostru'', evidencing the [[agitprop]] aspect of [[Education in the Soviet Union|Soviet education]], the vilifying of "''[[kulak]]''" elements in Transnistrian society, and the [[Plagiarism|plagiarizing]] of Romanian textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} N.

Some two years later, Smochină, using the pseudonym ''M. Florin'', began contributing to the Poporanist review ''Însemnări Ieșene'', where he reviewed the work of Bessarabian folklorist [[Tatiana Gălușcă-Crâșmaru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Maria Trofimov, "Valoarea culegerilor de creație populară orală ale profesoarei Tatiana Gălușcă", in [http://pro-science.asm.md/docs/citc/rezumate_05.pdf ''Conferința Internațională a Tinerilor Cercetători 2005.

It notably samples Transnistrian mournful lyrics about [[Conscription in Russia|forced recruitment]] during the [[History of the Russo-Turkish wars|Russo-Turkish Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Băieșu, p.105&lt;/ref&gt; That year, he carried out ethnographic interviews within the Romanian Transnistrian exile community, on behalf of the [[Romanian Academy]].&lt;ref name="ansdincolo2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Gheorghe Pavelescu, [http://dspace.bcucluj.ro/bitstream/123456789/6857/1/BCUCLUJ_FP_BALP73_1939_007_010_012.pdf "Etnografia românească din Ardeal în ultimii douăzeci de ani (1919—1939)"], in ''[[Gând Românesc]]'', Nr. 10-12/1939, p.457–458 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; As argued by ethnographer Constantin Eretescu, such contributions made Smochină "the most significant researcher of folk culture in that area."&lt;ref name="cemisc"&gt;{{ro icon}} Constantin Eretescu, [http://revistacultura.ro/nou/2011/01/miscellanea-ethnologica/ "Miscellanea ethnologica"], in ''Cultura'', Nr. 308, January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

His main activity in advancing the cause of Transnistrians was creating the Association of Transnistrian Romanians. It was designed to give further support to the Romanian refugees from that region, who were estimated at 20,000.&lt;ref name="ck181"/&gt; Smochină himself estimated that there were in all some 1,200,000 Romanians living in the Moldavian ASSR, forming 80% of the native population—this remains the highest such estimate, significantly ahead of the number advanced in the 1910s by activist [[Alexis Nour]].&lt;ref&gt;Pântea, p.176–177&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1930s, Smochină was contributing to Iorga's summer school program in [[Vălenii de Munte]] town. Physician [[G. Brătescu]], who attended these conferences as an adolescent, notes that Smochină gave "frightening accounts" of life in Transnistria.&lt;ref name="gb59"&gt;[[G. Brătescu]], ''Ce-a fost să fie. Notații autobiografice'', [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], Bucharest, 2003, p.59.  {{ISBN|973-50-0425-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brătescu, who was also being introduced to [[Romanian Communist Party]] propaganda, also recalled that local communists dismissed Smochină's discourse as "fabrications by a provocateur, a bitter enemy of communism."&lt;ref name="gb59"/&gt;

===Antonescu's adviser===
Smochină's political and scientific activities were affected by the 1940 [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia]]. He escaped Chișinău in time, but his research material was left behind. The [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] regime declared him a ''[[persona non grata]]'', and [[Censorship in the Soviet Union|Soviet censorship]] repossessed and banned all of his published volumes.&lt;ref name="cemisc"/&gt; Smochină was to accuse the Soviet authorities of vandalizing the Chișinău printing press where he was publishing a voluminous scientific work, reportedly lost in the process.&lt;ref name="id18"/&gt; As a representative of the Transnistrian community, Smochină attached himself the Bessarabian Circle of Bucharest, presided over by [[Gherman Pântea]].&lt;ref&gt;Constantin (2010), p.91&lt;/ref&gt; Also escaping the occupation, Claudia joined her father in Bucharest, where she married the Bessarabian-born linguist Diomid Strungaru.&lt;ref name="cineseteme"/&gt;

The family was in Bucharest in 1940, when the loss of [[Northern Transylvania]] plunged Romania into a political crisis. Smochină deeply admired ''[[Conducător]]'' [[Ion Antonescu]], who was Romania's dictatorial ruler from 1941 to 1944. The Transnistrian ethnographer preserved Antonescu's image as a "great lover of the nation" and an "honest man", particularly since Antonescu promised to revisit the Bessarabian-Transnistrian issue "with an axe".&lt;ref name="id17"/&gt; According to his memoirs, Smochină accompanied the ''Conducător'' on all of his visits to [[Nazi Germany]], where Antonescu reportedly imposed respect on German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref name="id17"/&gt; At that time, Romania formalized its alliance with the [[Axis Powers]] and, in summer 1941, joined Germany's [[Operation Barbarossa|sudden attack on the Soviet Union]]. During the early stages of war, the Romanian leader appointed Smochină his personal adviser on the issue of Transnistria.&lt;ref name="ic(10)238"/&gt; His work for that year included the brochure ''Masacrele de la Nistru'' ("Massacres on the Dniester"), which accused the Soviets of committing various crimes against the Romanian populace.&lt;ref name="ppgmemento!"/&gt;

''Moldova Nouă'' was reestablished, with the subtitle ''Revistă de studii și cercetări transnistriene'' ("Review of Transnistrian Studies and Research"),&lt;ref&gt;Kulikovski &amp; Șcelcikova, p.247. See also Constantin (2010), p.238&lt;/ref&gt; publishing Smochină's [[German language|German-language]] work ''Die Rumänen zwischen Dnjestr und Bug'' ("The Romanians between the Dniester and the [[Southern Bug|Bug]]"), detailing the activities of Romanian boyars in "New Russia".&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Matei Cazacu, [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/cmr_0008-0160_1993_num_34_1_2347 "Familles de la noblesse roumaine au service de la Russie, XVe-XIXe siècles"], in ''[[Cahiers du Monde Russe et Soviétique]]'', Nr. 1-2/1993, p.216, 225 (republished by [http://www.persee.fr/web/support/soon_available ''Persée'' Scientific Journals] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120908132757/http://www.persee.fr/web/support/soon_available |date=2012-09-08 }})&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine went out of print in 1942, but was replaced with the anonymously titled ''Transnistria'', published by Smochină until 1944.&lt;ref name="id15"/&gt;

His son Alexandru N. Smochină also had contributions to the wartime press, writing for [[Octavian Tăslăuanu]]'s nationalist review ''Dacia''.&lt;ref name="ansdincolo2"/&gt; He graduated from Iași Law School in 1940, while also completing [[officer training]].&lt;ref name="mttrnistreanul"/&gt; Following the reconquest of Bessarabia and the crossing of the Dniester, the Antonescu regime created a [[Transnistria Governorate]], which had [[Gheorghe Alexianu]] as the chief administrator and Gherman Pântea as the Mayor of [[Odessa]]. Alexandru Smochină was taken off active duty and made Second Prefect of Transnistria's [[Berezovca County, Transnistria|County Berezovca]].&lt;ref name="mttrnistreanul"/&gt;

However, Smochină Sr. found himself ill at ease with the Governorate's military and civilian administration, noting instances where Governor Alexianu and [[Gendarmerie (Romania)|Gendarmerie]] commander [[Constantin Vasiliu]] derided their Bessarabian subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;Constantin (2010), p.96&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Smochină described the [[1941 Odessa massacre]], ordered by Antonescu in retaliation for a supposed Jewish plot against the Romanian command, as a grave error on the Romanians' part: as he noted, both he and Pântea had been informed that the building supposedly bombed by Jewish activists had in fact been mined by the retreating Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;Constantin (2010), p.103, 105&lt;/ref&gt; Smochină also claimed that Ion Antonescu saw Hitler's war on the "three occult forces" (Jews, Freemasons and the [[Catholic Church]]) as a "great mistake" which could lose Germany the war.&lt;ref name="id17"/&gt; In Smochină's account, the ''Conducător'' had gone on to state: "[Hitler] could have easily lured the Jewry on his side, and after the war he'd have been able to wrestle with it, but not in this destructive manner, that one is not humane."&lt;ref name="id17"/&gt;

On July 2, 1942, Smochină was made an honorary member of the Romanian Academy.&lt;ref name="ppgmemento!"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Datcu, p.15. See also Constantin (2010), p.238&lt;/ref&gt; He was at the time working under anthropologist [[Traian Herseni]], involved in a large [[interdisciplinary]] effort to collect and systematize the folkloric creation of Transnistrian Romanians; his contribution was featured in Gheorghe Pavelescu's 1943 monograph ''Aspecte din spiritualitatea românilor transnistrieni: Credințe și obiceiuri'' ("Aspects of Romanian Transnistrian Spirituality: Beliefs and Customs").&lt;ref&gt;Băieșu, p.108–109&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation also aimed to react against decades of [[USSR anti-religious campaign (1928–1941)|Soviet anti-religious campaigns]], and consciously excluded all folklore which showed Soviet-era influences.&lt;ref&gt;Băieșu, p.109&lt;/ref&gt; In Tiraspol, Alexandru Smochină took up a like-minded project, founding the Moldavian Circle, which disseminated propaganda and popularized Romanian historiography.&lt;ref name="mttrnistreanul"/&gt;

For a while, Smochină Sr. was in the [[Crimea]], helping Romanian historian [[Gheorghe I. Brătianu]] to recover the letters addressed by his ancestor, Ion Brătianu, to [[Nicholas I of Russia]].&lt;ref name="id17"/&gt; He maintained contacts with local [[Russians]] and helped [[anti-communist]] surgeon Pavel Chasovnikov (Ceasovnicov) in receiving Romanian citizenship rights.&lt;ref&gt;Constantin (2010), p.138&lt;/ref&gt; In his native area of Dubăsari, the scholar played host to Romanian students coming in from Bucharest and from Odessa's [[Romanian Cultural Institute]].&lt;ref name="viahcaract"/&gt;

===Communist repression===
By early 1944, the Axis had been dealt major defeats on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], and the Soviets began their menacing [[Dnieper–Carpathian Offensive]]. The change of fortunes alarmed Bessarabian and Transnistrian activists: Smochină, Halippa and Boldur joined others in a diplomatic effort to convince the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] that Bessarabia needed to be part of Romania, but the military situation prevented them from ever leaving Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Constantin (2008), p.46–47&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent [[Battle of Romania]] evacuated Romanian administration from Transnistria, Bessarabia, and even parts of Moldavia-proper. In August 1944, [[King Michael's Coup]] toppled Antonescu and took Romania out of the Axis. Smochină claimed to have personally been helping Antonescu in negotiating a [[separate peace]] with the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]], days before the regime fell.&lt;ref name="id18"/&gt; After Antonescu's arrest, the former Transnistria adviser lived a secluded life, and focused on writing his works of history.&lt;ref name="ic(10)238"/&gt;

When a [[Communist Romania|Romanian communist regime]] came into existence, Smochină's works were [[Censorship in Communist Romania|officially censored]], and the remaining copies were tracked down and confiscated.&lt;ref name="id18"/&gt; According to Popescu Gogan, he was especially sought after for his ''Masacrele de la Nistru''.&lt;ref name="ppgmemento!"/&gt; The [[Soviet occupation of Romania|Soviet occupiers]] picked up Smochină Jr., who was at the time living in Romania with his wife and daughter, and working as an attorney.&lt;ref name="mttrnistreanul"/&gt; According to one account, this was case of clerical error: they deported Alexandru to the [[Gulag]] only because they mistook him for his father.&lt;ref name="ic(10)238"/&gt; The story was contradicted by more detailed research into the period. It surfaced that Alexandru was interrogated for his wartime activities in Berezovca and Tiraspol. He was thus formally accused of promoting [[Romanianization]], of spying against the Soviet state, and of causing some 964 million [[Soviet ruble|руб]] of damage to Transnistria; found guilty, he was given 25 years of hard labor, to be served in [[Amur Oblast]].&lt;ref name="mttrnistreanul"/&gt;

Smochină Sr. went into hiding. He used aliases and tried to make himself lost in the [[Carpathian Mountains]], but was tracked down by the repressive apparatus.&lt;ref name="id18"/&gt; He ended up in prison, and, as he recalled, was subjected to numerous beatings.&lt;ref name="id18"/&gt; His academician's title, his pension and his right of attending the [[Romanian Academy Library]] were all removed from him (''see [[List of purged members of the Romanian Academy]]'').&lt;ref name="id18"/&gt; His son-in-law, Diomid Strungaru, was stripped of all positions in academia, and had to work at a [[clothes iron]] factory.&lt;ref name="cineseteme"/&gt;

By 1955, with [[Destalinization]] in full swing, both Smochinăs were unceremoniously released. Alexandru was picked up from his place of exile, and dropped back to Romania as a released [[prisoner of war]], with no papers on him. (Since this rendered him effectively a [[nonperson]], he was forced to support himself by menial labor.)&lt;ref name="mttrnistreanul"/&gt; Smochină Sr. was kept under tight surveillance by the [[Securitate]] secret police, whose reports summarized his career in nationalist politics: "before the year 1944 he edited and managed various publications with [[Anti-Soviet agitation|anti-Soviet content]], drafted and printed a significant number of anti-Soviet books and generated large-scale propaganda efforts to support the Antonescu war through conferences, lectures and by other means."&lt;ref&gt;Constantin (2010), p.168&lt;/ref&gt; Himself a former prisoner, Pântea was being pressured into becoming a Securitate informant on Transnistrian activities in Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;Constantin (2010), p.168–176&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1959, Securitate agents intimidated Smochină from attending the funeral of former Bessarabian dignitary [[Grigore Cazacliu]], but, during interrogations, he denied knowledge (or feigned unawareness) of a plot to enthrone [[Constantin Tomescu]] as [[Metropolis of Bessarabia|Bessarabian Metropolitan]].&lt;ref&gt;Constantin (2010), p.153, 168–169&lt;/ref&gt; Securitate sources claimed that the Bessarabian-Transnistrian underground was planning a set of measures to occur after the future "liberation of Bessarabia", and that Smochină was discussing a return to Chișinău.&lt;ref&gt;Constantin (2010), p.153, 168–171&lt;/ref&gt; According to other such reports, Smochină was fully aware of being followed around by Securitate operatives, and tried to protect his friends by avoiding contact with them.&lt;ref&gt;Constantin (2010), p.153, 180&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final activities===
Allegedly, Nichita Smochină found understanding from Romania's new [[National communism|national communist]] leader, [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]]. He claimed that, in 1965, Ceaușescu asked him to retrieve those documents which showed Antonescu's move to a separate peace; driven by a Securitate guard to [[Caransebeș]], where he had allegedly buried the evidence back in the late '40s, Smochină only recovered three empty crates.&lt;ref name="id18"/&gt; Ceaușescu allowed him to receive a new pension, but he was denied reintegration into the Academy, with the suggestion that such a move would dampen [[Romania–Russia relations]].&lt;ref name="id18"/&gt; These were openly tested by the Bessarabian community in February 1967, when Halippa presented Ceaușescu's [[State Council of Romania|Council of State]] with reports on the existence of oppressed Soviet Romanians. These included a polemical note by Smochină, who condemned the Soviet-endorsed delimitation of a "[[Moldovans|Moldovan people]]" in Bessarabia, and in general the ideology of "[[Moldovenism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Constantin (2008), p.49–50&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, Halippa advanced Smochină's name among those of Bessarabians who could serve as specialists for the Romanian Communist Party's ISISP foundation of social science.&lt;ref&gt;Constantin (2008), p.51&lt;/ref&gt;

Smochină was recovered by the Romanian and Soviet schools of [[Slavic studies|Slavistics]], commissioned for translations from Slavonic documents which were published by either the Romanian Academy or the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Moscow Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name="ic(10)238"/&gt; He was allowed back at the Academy Library, but still banned from authoring contributing original books of his own.&lt;ref name="ppgmemento!"/&gt; In the 1970s, he published articles in a specialized magazine based in [[Thessaloniki]], [[Greece]], and donated his documents and manuscripts to the [[National Archives of Romania]].&lt;ref name="ic(10)238"/&gt; Strungaru was also allowed back to work in universities, and Smochină moved in with him and Claudia.&lt;ref name="cineseteme"/&gt;

At that stage, exiled Bessarabians could profit from the relative tolerance of Romania's national communist system, and began organizing themselves into advocacy groups, even establishing links in the West. Smochină himself tried to mediate between the two competing factions: one represented by [[Ion Păscăluță]] (and supported by Halippa); the other headed by [[Anton Crihan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ion Constantin, [http://old.bmms.ro/continut/xhtml/ro/Revista_online/Nr.6_2009/Pantelimon_hailipa_exilul_3.html "Pantelimon Halippa și exilul românesc pentru cauza Basarabiei"], in ''Revista Biblioteca Bucureștilor'', Nr. 6/2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Smochină died in Bucharest, on December 14, 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Constantin (2010), p.237; Datcu, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; His work and life were again in public focus after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]] overthrew Ceaușescu. His main ethnographic research was featured in the 1996 anthology ''Românitatea transnistriană'' ("Transnistrian Romanianness"), published in Bucharest by Editura Semne.&lt;ref&gt;Băieșu, p.104, 112; Pântea, p.202&lt;/ref&gt; On July 3, 1990, he was posthumously reinstated honorary Academy member.&lt;ref name="id18"/&gt;

Smochină is also remembered by the authorities of [[Moldova]], the Bessarabian state created by the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], where Alexandru Smochină was formally [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="mttrnistreanul"/&gt; [[President of Moldova|Moldovan President]] [[Mihai Ghimpu]] awarded Smochină Sr. posthumous [[Order of Honor (Moldova)|Order of Honor]] insignia in April 2010.&lt;ref name="annistru"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.jurnal.md/ro/news/academicianul-smochina-distins-post-mortem-cu-ordinul-de-onoare-184967/ "Academicianul Smochină, distins post-mortem cu Ordinul de Onoare"], in ''[[Jurnal de Chișinău]]'', April 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Smochină is not honored in Transnistria-proper, which is ruled by a [[Political status of Transnistria|breakaway pro-Russian regime]]. Reportedly, Alexandru Smochină tried to visit his ancestral home in Mahala (where a ''Smokine'' family still lives), but was prevented from entering the premises by a group of local Russians.&lt;ref name="cineseteme"/&gt;

Nichita Smochină's memoirs (or ''Memorii'') were published, care of [[Editura Academiei]], in 2009 and ''Pagini din însemnările unui rebel. Academicianul Nichita Smochină'' were published, care of [[Editura Samia, Iași]], in 2012. The editor is Vlad Galin-Corini, son-in-law of Diomid Strungaru.&lt;ref name="cineseteme"/&gt; Commentators have described the book as a revelation, in particular for its detail on the various public figures whom the Transnistrian ethnologist had met before 1944.&lt;ref name="cineseteme"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Constantin (2010), p.96, 103, 105, 138, 145–146; Datcu, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; According to Galin-Corini, these works were also rejected by editors in Moldova, because they make brazen statements about Bessarabians who collaborated with the Soviets.&lt;ref name="cineseteme"/&gt;

[[File:Paul Legrand by Nadar c1855.jpg|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;[[Paul Legrand]] as Pierrot circa 1855. Photograph by [[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar]].&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Pierrot''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɪər|oʊ}}, {{small|US also}} {{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|iː|ə|ˈ|r|oʊ}}; {{IPA-fr|pjɛʁo|lang}}) is a [[stock character]] of [[pantomime]] and ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'' whose origins are in the late seventeenth-century Italian troupe of players performing in Paris and known as the [[Comédie-Italienne]]; the name is a [[hypocorism|diminutive]] of ''Pierre'' (Peter), via the suffix ''[[wikt:-ot#French|-ot]].'' His character in contemporary popular culture—in poetry, fiction, and the visual arts, as well as works for the stage, screen, and concert hall—is that of the sad clown, pining for love of [[Columbina|Columbine]], who usually breaks his heart and leaves him for [[Harlequin]]. Performing unmasked, with a whitened face, he wears a loose white blouse with large buttons and wide white pantaloons. Sometimes he appears with a frilled collaret and a hat, usually with a close-fitting crown and wide round brim, more rarely with a conical shape like a dunce's cap. But most frequently, since his reincarnation under [[Jean-Gaspard Deburau]], he wears neither collar nor hat, only a black skullcap. The defining characteristic of Pierrot is his [[naïveté]]: he is seen as a fool, often the butt of pranks, yet nonetheless trusting.

It was a generally buffoonish Pierrot that held the European stage for the first two centuries of his history. And yet early signs of a respectful, even sympathetic attitude toward the character appeared in the plays of [[Jean-François Regnard]] and in the paintings of [[Antoine Watteau]], an attitude that would deepen in the nineteenth century, after the [[Romanticism|Romantics]] claimed the figure as their own. For [[Jules Janin]] and [[Théophile Gautier]], Pierrot was not a fool but an avatar of the post-[[French Revolution|Revolutionary]] People, struggling, sometimes tragically, to secure a place in the bourgeois world.&lt;ref&gt;Janin called Deburau's Pierrot "the people among the people" ([http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k204330f/f182.image pp. 156-57]); Gautier identified him as "the modern proletarian, the pariah, the passive and disinherited being" (V, 24).&lt;/ref&gt; And subsequent artistic/cultural movements found him equally amenable to their cause: the [[Decadent movement|Decadents]] turned him, like themselves, into a disillusioned disciple of [[Schopenhauer]], a foe of Woman and of callow idealism; the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]] saw him as a lonely fellow-sufferer, crucified upon the [[rood]] of soulful sensitivity, his only friend the distant moon; the [[Modernism|Modernists]] converted him into a [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistlerian]] subject for canvases devoted to form and color and line.&lt;ref&gt;On Pierrot in the art of the Decadents and Symbolists, see [[#Pantomime and late 19th-century art|Pantomime and late nineteenth-century art]]; for his image in the art of the Modernists, see, for example, the Juan Gris canvases reproduced in [[#Works on canvas, paper, and board|Works on canvas, paper, and board]].&lt;/ref&gt; In short, Pierrot became an alter-ego of the artist, specifically of the famously alienated artist of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;For studies of the relationship between modern artists and clowns in general, see Régnier, Ritter, and [[Jean Starobinski|Starobinski]]. On the modern artist specifically as a Pierrot, see Storey, ''Pierrot: a critical history'', pp. 93–193, and all of his ''Pierrots on the stage''; also Green and Swan, Kellein, Palacio, Sensibar.&lt;/ref&gt; His physical insularity; his poignant lapses into mutism, the legacy of the great mime Deburau; his white face and costume, suggesting not only innocence but the pallor of the dead; his often frustrated pursuit of Columbine, coupled with his never-to-be-vanquished unworldly naïveté—all conspired to lift him out of the circumscribed world of the ''commedia dell'arte'' and into the larger realm of myth. Much of that mythic quality ("I'm Pierrot," said [[David Bowie]]: "I'm Everyman")&lt;ref name="bowiegoldenyears.com"&gt;Jean Rook, [http://www.bowiegoldenyears.com/articles/760505-dailyexpress.html "Waiting for Bowie, and finding a genius who insists he's really a clown"], ''Daily Express'', 5 May 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; still adheres to the "sad clown" of the postmodern era.

==Origins: seventeenth century==
[[Image:Antoine Watteau - The Italian Comedians - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Antoine Watteau]]: ''Italian Actors'', c. 1719. National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.]]He is sometimes said to be a French variant of the sixteenth-century Italian [[Pedrolino]],&lt;ref&gt;Sand,  Duchartre, and Oreglia see a close family resemblance between—if not an interchangeability of—both characters. Mic claims that an historical connection between Pedrolino and "the celebrated Pierrots of [Adolphe] Willette" is "absolutely evident" (p. 211). Nicoll writes that Pedrolino is the "Italian equivalent" of Pierrot (''World'', p. 88).  As late as 1994, Rudlin (pp. 137-38) renames Pierrot "Pedrolino" in a translation of a scene from Nolant de Fatouville's ''Harlequin, Emperor of the Moon'' (1684): see Gherardi, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vDg0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA181 I, 179].&lt;/ref&gt; but the two types have little but their names ("Little Pete") and social stations in common.&lt;ref&gt;There is no documentation from the seventeenth century that links the two figures. In fact, what documentation does exist links Pierrot, not with Pedrolino, but with [[Pulcinella]]. "Dominique" Biancolelli, Harlequin of the first Comédie-Italienne in which Pierrot appeared by name, noted that "The nature of the ''rôle'' is that of a Neapolitan Pulcinella a little altered. In point of fact, the Neapolitan scenarii, in place of Arlecchino and Scapino, admit two Pulcinellas, the one an intriguing rogue and the other a stupid fool. The latter is Pierot's {{sic}} ''rôle'': MS 13736, Bibliothèque de l'Opéra, Paris, I, 113; cited and tr. Nicoll, ''Masks'', p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; Both are comic servants, but Pedrolino, as a so-called first ''[[Zanni#Two types of Zanni|zanni]]'', often acts with cunning and daring,&lt;ref&gt;[[File:Pedrolino and the Doctor in 1621 woodcut.jpg|thumb|Pedrolino scuffles with the Doctor, 1621.]]In one of the few extant contemporary illustrations involving Pedrolino—i.e., the frontispiece of Giulio Cesare Croce's ''Pedrolino's Great Victory against the Doctor Gratiano Scatolone, for Love of the Beautiful Franceschina'' (1621)—the ''zanni'' is shown thrashing the Doctor rather savagely (and, as the title indicates, victoriously). Such aggressive ferocity is nowhere to be seen, early or late, in the behavioral repertoire of Pierrot.  Pierrot can be murderous (see [[#"Shakespeare at the Funambules" and aftermath|"Shakespeare at the Funambules" and aftermath]] below), but he is never pugnacious.&lt;/ref&gt; an engine of the plot in the [[scenario]]s where he appears.&lt;ref&gt;He appears in forty-nine of the fifty scenarios in Flaminio Scala's ''Il teatro delle favole rappresentative'' (1611) and in three of the scenarios in the unpublished "Corsini" collection. Salerno has translated the Scala scenarios; Pandolfi (V, 252–276) has summarized the plots of the "Corsini" pieces.&lt;/ref&gt; Pierrot, on the other hand, as a "second" ''zanni'', is a static character in his earliest incarnations, "standing on the periphery of the action",&lt;ref&gt;"Indeed, Pierrot appears in comparative isolation from his fellow masks, with few exceptions, in all the plays of ''Le Théâtre Italien'', standing on the periphery of the action, commenting, advising, chiding, but rarely taking part in the movement around him": Storey, ''Pierrot: a critical history'', pp. 27-28.&lt;/ref&gt; dispensing advice that seems to him sage, and courting—unsuccessfully—his master's young daughter, Columbine, with bashfulness and indecision.&lt;ref&gt;See the discussion in Storey, ''Pierrot: a critical history'', pp. 22–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

His origins among the Italian players in France are most unambiguously traced to [[Molière]]'s character, the lovelorn peasant Pierrot, in ''[[Dom Juan|Don Juan, or The Stone Guest]]'' (1665).&lt;ref&gt;Fournier, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2013692/f124.image p. 113], provides the information for this paragraph.  "If, as [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2013692/f125.image Fournier points out], Molière gave [his Pierrot] 'the white blouse of a French peasant', then I doubt very much that we have to look for traces of his origins [i.e., of the origins of the Italians' Pierrot] in the ''commedia dell'arte'' at all": Storey, ''Pierrot: a critical history'',  p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1673, probably inspired by Molière's success, the Comédie-Italienne made its own contribution to the Don Juan legend with an ''Addendum to "The Stone Guest''",&lt;ref&gt;This was its second such contribution, the first being ''Il Convitato di pietra'' (The Stone Guest, 1658), which was the basis for the ''Addendum'' (albeit without its Pierrot) and the inspiration for Molière's play.  See Fournier, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2013692/f124.image pp. 112-113].&lt;/ref&gt; which included Molière's Pierrot.&lt;ref&gt;Harlequin Biancolelli's manuscript-[[scenario]] of the play offers no insight into Pierrot's character.  Pierrot's name appears only once: "This scene takes place in the country.  I drop the hunting horn at Spezzafer's feet; he blows it; then, on the run, I trip up '''Pierrot'''; then I find a blind man ...."  MS of the Opéra (Paris), II, 177; cited in Klingler, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter the character—sometimes a peasant,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZDM0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA195 Act III, scene iii] of [[Eustache Le Noble]]'s ''Harlequin-Aesop'' (1691) in the Gherardi collection.  A translated excerpt from the scene appears in Storey, ''Pierrot: a critical history'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; but more often now an Italianate "second" ''zanni''—appeared fairly regularly in the Italians’ offerings, his role always taken by one Giuseppe Giaratone (or Geratoni, fl. 1639-1697), until the troupe was banished by royal decree in 1697.

Among the French dramatists who wrote for the Italians and who gave Pierrot life on their stage were [[Jean Palaprat]], Claude-Ignace Brugière de Barante, [[Antoine Houdar de la Motte]], and the most sensitive of his early interpreters, [[Jean-François Regnard]].&lt;ref&gt;See especially Regnard's [https://books.google.com/books?id=AzM0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA318 ''Happy-Go-Lucky Harlequin''] (1690), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZDM0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 ''The Wayward Girls''] (1690), and [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZDM0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA89 ''The Coquette, or The Ladies' Academy''] (1691); Palaprat's [https://books.google.com/books?id=6jM0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA72 ''The Level-headed Girl''] (1692); Houdar de la Motte's [https://books.google.com/books?id=6jM0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA290 ''The Eccentrics, or The Italian'' (Les Originaux, ou l'Italien, 1693)] ; and Brugière de Barante's [https://books.google.com/books?id=UzQ0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA265 ''The False Coquette''] (1694). All appear in the Gherardi collection.&lt;/ref&gt; He acquires there a very distinctive personality. He seems an anomaly among the busy social creatures that surround him; he is isolated, out of touch.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZDM0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA24 Scene des remontrances] of Regnard's ''Wayward Girls'' in the Gherardi collection.  A translated excerpt from this scene appears in Storey, ''Pierrot: a critical history'', p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Columbine laughs at his advances;&lt;ref&gt;See [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZDM0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA100 Act I, scene v] of Regnard's ''La Coquette'' and [https://books.google.com/books?id=6jM0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA321 Act III, scene i] of Houdar de la Motte's ''The Eccentrics'' (''Les Originaux''), both in the Gherardi collection.  Translations of these scenes appear in Storey, ''Pierrot: a critical history'', pp. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;  his masters who are in pursuit of pretty young wives brush off his warnings to act their age.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [https://books.goog-25.le.com/books?id=6jM0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA78 Act I, scene ii]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} of Palaprat's ''Level-Headed Girl'' in the Gherardi collection.  A translated excerpt from this scene appears in Storey, ''Pierrot: a critical history'', pp. 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; His is a solitary voice, and his estrangement, however comic, bears the pathos of the portraits—[[Antoine Watteau|Watteau]]'s chief among them—that one encounters in the centuries to come.

==Eighteenth century==

An Italian company was called back to Paris in 1716, and Pierrot was reincarnated by the actors Pierre-François Biancolelli (son of the Harlequin of the banished troupe of players) and, after Biancolelli abandoned the role, the celebrated [[Fabio Sticotti]] (1676–1741) and his son [[Antoine Jean Sticotti|Antoine Jean]] (1715–1772).&lt;ref&gt;Courville, II, 104; Campardon, ''Comédiens du roi'', [https://archive.org/stream/lescomdiensduro02campgoog#page/n157/mode/2up II, 145]; Meldolesi.&lt;/ref&gt; But the character seems to have been regarded as unimportant by this company, since he appears infrequently in its new plays.&lt;ref&gt;In the last (1753) edition of the ''Nouveau Théâtre Italien'', he appears only once—in Delisle de la Drévetière's ''The Falcon and the Eggs of Boccaccio'' (1725). The new company still produced pieces from the first Comédie-Italienne; they were added to the repertoire in 1718: Gueullette, pp. 87ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

His real life in the theater in the eighteenth century is to be found on the lesser stages of the capital, at its two great fairs, the [[Théâtre de la foire|Foires Saint-Germain and Saint-Laurent]]. There he appeared in the marionette theaters and in the motley entertainments—featuring song, dance, audience participation, and acrobatics—that were calculated to draw a crowd while sidestepping the regulations that ensured the [[Théâtre-Français]] a monopoly on "regular" dramas in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;For a full account of the struggle of the fair theaters to survive despite official opposition, see Bonnassies.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes he spoke gibberish (in the so-called ''pièces à la muette''); sometimes the audience itself sang his lines, inscribed on placards held aloft by hovering Cupids (in the ''pièces à écriteau'').&lt;ref&gt;These developments occurred in 1707 and 1708, respectively; see Bonnassies.&lt;/ref&gt; The result, far from "regular" drama, tended to put a strain on his character, and, as a consequence, the early Pierrot of the fairgrounds is a much less nuanced and rounded type than we find in the older repertoire. This holds true even when sophisticated playwrights, such as [[Alain-René Lesage]] and his collaborators, [[Jacques-Philippe d'Orneval|Dorneval]] and [[Louis Fuzelier|Fuzelier]], began (around 1712) to contribute more "regular" plays to the Foires.&lt;ref&gt;For the plays, see Lesage and Dorneval; for an analysis, see Storey, ''Pierrot: a critical history'', pp. 37–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The broad [[satire|satirical]] streak in Lesage often rendered him indifferent to Pierrot's character, and consequently, as the critic Vincent Barberet observes, "Pierrot is assigned the most diverse roles . . . and sometimes the most opposed to his personality. Besides making him a valet, a roasting specialist, a chef, a hash-house cook, an adventurer, [Lesage] just as frequently dresses him up as someone else." In not a few of the early Foire plays, Pierrot's character is therefore "quite badly defined."&lt;ref&gt;Barberet, p. 154; tr. Storey, ''Pierrot: a critical history'', pp. 52, 53.&lt;/ref&gt; (For a typical farce by Lesage during these years, see his [[Arlequin roi de Serendib|Harlequin, King of Serendib]] of 1713.) In the main, Pierrot's inaugural years at the Foires were rather degenerate ones.

An important factor that probably hastened his degeneration was the multiplicity of his fairground interpreters.  Not only actors but also acrobats and dancers were quick to seize on his role, inadvertently reducing Pierrot to a generic type.&lt;ref&gt;See Storey, ''Pierrot: a critical history'', p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent of that degeneration may be gauged by the fact that Pierrot came to be confused, apparently because of his manner and costume, with that much coarser character [[Gilles (stock character)|Gilles]],&lt;ref&gt;On Gilles and his confusion with Pierrot, see Storey, ''Pierrot: a critical history'', pp. 74–81.&lt;/ref&gt; as a famous portrait by [[Antoine Watteau]] attests (note title of image at right).

But in the 1720s, Pierrot at last came into his own.  [[Antoine Galland]]'s final volume of The ''[[Thousand and One Nights]]'' had appeared in 1717, and in the plots of these tales Lesage and his collaborators found inspiration, both exotic and (more importantly) coherent, for new plays.  In  ''Achmet and Almanzine'' (1728) by Lesage and Dorneval,&lt;ref&gt;In Lesage and Dorneval, VIII.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, we are introduced not only to the royal society of far-off Astrakhan but also to a familiar and well-drawn servant of old&amp;mdash;the headstrong and bungling Pierrot.&lt;ref&gt;For a full discussion, see Storey, ''Pierrot: a critical history'', pp. 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also in the 1720s that [[Alexis Piron]] loaned his talents to the Foires, and in plays like ''Trophonius's Cave'' (1722) and ''The Golden Ass'' (1725),&lt;ref&gt;Both in Piron, IV; Storey translates a scene from ''Trophonius's Cave'' in ''Pierrot: a critical history'', pp. 57-58.&lt;/ref&gt; one meets the same engaging Pierrot of Giaratone's creation.  The accomplished comic actor Jean-Baptiste Hamoche, who had worked at the Foires from 1712 to 1718,&lt;ref&gt;Parfaict and Abguerbe, [https://archive.org/stream/dictionnairedes26unkngoog#page/n64/mode/2up p. 57].&lt;/ref&gt; reappeared in Pierrot's role in 1721, and from that year until 1732 he "obtained, thanks to the naturalness and truth of his acting, great applause and became the favorite actor of the public."&lt;ref&gt;Campardon, ''Spectacles'', [https://archive.org/stream/lesspectaclesde00campgoog#page/n443/mode/2up I, 391;] tr. Storey, ''Pierrot: a critical history'', p. 54, note 31.&lt;/ref&gt;  But Pierrot's triumph was short-lived.  "The retirement of Hamoche in 1733", writes Barberet, "was fatal to Pierrot.  After this date, we hardly ever see him appear again except in old plays."&lt;ref&gt;Barberet, p. 155; tr. Storey, ''Pierrot: a critical history'', p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

But as he seemed to expire on the theatrical scene, he found new life in the visual arts.  He, along with his fellow ''commedia'' masks,&lt;ref&gt;Both masked and unmasked characters of the ''commedia ''were known as "masks": see Andrews, p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt; was beginning to be "poeticized" in the early 1700s: he was being made the subject, not only of poignant folksong ("[[Au clair de la lune]]", sometimes attributed to [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]]),&lt;ref&gt;" ... without the least proof": Fournier, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2013692/f125.image p. 114.]&lt;/ref&gt;  but also of the more ambitious art of [[Claude Gillot]] (''Master André's Tomb'' [c. 1717]), of Gillot's students Watteau (''Italian Actors'' [c. 1719]) and [[Nicolas Lancret]] (''Italian Actors near a Fountain'' [c. 1719]), of [[Jean-Baptiste Oudry]] (''Italian Actors in a Park'' [c. 1725]), and of [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]] (''A Boy as Pierrot'' [1776–1780]). This development will accelerate in the next century.

===England===
Before turning to that century, however, it should be noted that it was in this, the eighteenth, that Pierrot began to be naturalized in other countries. As early as 1673, just months after Pierrot had made his debut in the ''Addendum to "The Stone Guest''", Scaramouche Tiberio Fiorilli and a troupe assembled from the Comédie-Italienne entertained Londoners with selections from their Parisian repertoire.&lt;ref&gt;On the French players in England, and particularly on Pierrot in early English entertainments, see Storey, ''Pierrot: a critical history'', pp. 82–89.&lt;/ref&gt; And in 1717, Pierrot's name first appears in an English entertainment: a [[pantomime]] by [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]] entitled ''The Jealous Doctor; or, The Intriguing Dame'', in which the role was undertaken by a certain Mr. Griffin.  Thereafter, until the end of the century, Pierrot appeared fairly regularly in English pantomimes (which were originally mute [[harlequinade]]s but later evolved into the [[Pantomime|Christmas pantomimes]] of today; in the nineteenth century, the harlequinade was presented as a "play within a play" during the pantomime), finding his most notable interpreter in [[Carlo Delpini]] (1740–1828). His role was uncomplicated: Delpini, according to the popular theater historian, M. Willson Disher, "kept strictly to the idea of a creature so stupid as to think that if he raised his leg level with his shoulder he could use it as a gun."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Disher|1925|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; So conceived, Pierrot was easily and naturally displaced by the native English [[Clown]] when the latter found a suitably brilliant interpreter. It did so in 1800, when [[Joseph Grimaldi|"Joey" Grimaldi]] made his celebrated debut in the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Findlater|1978|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
A more long-lasting development occurred in Denmark. In that same year, 1800, a troupe of Italian players led by Pasquale Casorti began giving performances in [[Dyrehavsbakken]], then a well-known site for entertainers, hawkers, and inn-keepers. Casorti's son, Giuseppe (1749–1826), had undoubtedly been impressed by the Pierrots they had seen while touring France in the late eighteenth century, for he assumed the role and began appearing as Pierrot in his own pantomimes, which now had a formulaic structure (Cassander, father of Columbine, and Pierrot, his dim-witted servant, undertake a mad pursuit of Columbine and her rogue lover, Harlequin).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Teater/Danske_skuespillere/Casorti?highlight=pasquale%20casorti "Casorti", ''Gyldendals encyklopædi''.]&lt;/ref&gt; The formula has proven enduring: Pierrot is still a fixture at [[Dyrehavsbakken|Bakken]], the oldest amusement park in the world, where he plays the nitwit talking to and entertaining children, and at nearby [[Tivoli Gardens]], the second oldest, where the Harlequin and Columbine act is performed as a [[Pantomimeteatret#Pantomime|pantomime and ballet]]. Pierrot—as "Pjerrot", with his boat-like hat and scarlet grin—remains one of the parks’ chief attractions.[[File:Cómicos ambulantes.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Francisco de Goya]]: ''Itinerant Actors'' (1793). Museo del Prado, Madrid.]]

===Germany===
[[Ludwig Tieck]]'s ''The Topsy-Turvy World'' (1798) is an early&amp;mdash;and highly successful&amp;mdash;example of the introduction of the ''commedia dell'arte'' characters into [[Parody|parodic]] [[metatheater]]. (Pierrot is a member of the audience watching the play.)

===Spain===
The penetration of Pierrot and his companions of the ''commedia'' into Spain is documented in a painting by [[Goya]], ''Itinerant Actors'' (1793). It foreshadows the work of such Spanish successors as [[Picasso]] and [[Fernand Pelez]], both of whom also showed strong sympathy with the lives of traveling [[saltimbanco]]s.

==Nineteenth century==

===Pantomime of Deburau at the Théâtre des Funambules===
[[Image:Jean-Gaspard Deburau.jpg|thumb|upright|[[:fr:Auguste Bouquet|Auguste Bouquet]]: ''[[Jean-Gaspard Deburau]]'', c. 1830.]]When, in 1762, a great fire destroyed the Foire Saint-Germain and the new Comédie-Italienne claimed the fairs’ stage-offerings (now known collectively as the [[Opéra-Comique]]) as their own, new enterprises began to attract the Parisian public, as little theaters&amp;mdash;all but one now defunct&amp;mdash; sprang up along the [[Boulevard du Temple]]. One of these was the [[Théâtre des Funambules]], licensed in its early years to present only mimed and acrobatic acts.&lt;ref&gt;The chief historian of the Funambules is [[Louis Péricaud]].&lt;/ref&gt; This will be the home, beginning in 1816, of [[Jean-Gaspard Deburau]] (1796–1846),&lt;ref&gt;On Deburau's life, see Rémy, ''Jean-Gaspard Deburau''; on his pantomime, see Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', pp. 7–35, and Nye (2014), Nye (2015-2016), and Nye (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; the most famous Pierrot in the history of the theater, immortalized by [[Jean-Louis Barrault]] in [[Marcel Carné]]'s film ''[[Children of Paradise]]'' (1945).

Adopting the stage-name "Baptiste", Deburau, from the year 1825, became the Funambules' sole actor to play Pierrot&lt;ref&gt;Nye (2016), p. 18, n. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; in several types of comic pantomime&amp;mdash;rustic, melodramatic, "realistic", and fantastic.&lt;ref&gt;See Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', pp. 15-23.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was often the servant of the heavy father (usually Cassander), his mute acting a compound of placid grace and cunning malice. His style, according to [[Louis Péricaud]], the chronicler of the Funambules, formed "an enormous contrast with the exuberance, the superabundance of gestures, of leaps, that ... his predecessors had employed."&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Péricaud|Péricaud]], [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k204363m/f31.image p. 28]; tr. Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; He altered the costume: freeing his long neck for comic effects, he dispensed with the frilled collaret; he substituted a skullcap for a hat, thereby keeping his expressive face unshadowed; and he greatly increased the amplitude of both blouse and trousers. Most importantly, the character of his Pierrot, as it evolved gradually through the 1820s, eventually parted company almost completely with the crude Pierrots—timid, sexless, lazy, and greedy—of the earlier pantomime.&lt;ref&gt;On the early Pierrots, see Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;With him [wrote the poet and journalist [[Théophile Gautier]] after Deburau's death], the role of Pierrot was widened, enlarged. It ended by occupying the entire piece, and, be it said with all the respect due to the memory of the most perfect actor who ever lived, by departing entirely from its origin and being denaturalized. Pierrot, under the flour and blouse of the illustrious Bohemian, assumed the airs of a master and an aplomb unsuited to his character; he gave kicks and no longer received them; Harlequin now scarcely dared brush his shoulders with his bat; Cassander would think twice before boxing his ears.&lt;ref&gt;In ''La Presse'', January 25, 1847; tr. Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', p 111.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Deburau seems to have had a predilection for "realistic" pantomime&lt;ref&gt;See Švehla, pp. 26–32.&lt;/ref&gt;—a predilection that, as will later become evident here, led eventually to calls for Pierrot's expulsion from it. But the pantomime that had the greatest appeal to his public was the "''pantomime-arlequinade-féerie''", sometimes "in the English style" (i.e., with a prologue in which characters were transformed into the ''commedia'' types). The action unfolded in fairy-land, peopled with good and bad spirits who both advanced and impeded the plot, which was interlarded with comically violent (and often scabrous) mayhem. As in the Bakken pantomimes, that plot hinged upon Cassander's pursuit of Harlequin and Columbine—but it was complicated, in Baptiste's interpretation, by a clever and ambiguous Pierrot. Baptiste's Pierrot was both a fool and no fool; he was Cassandre's valet but no one's servant. He was an embodiment of comic contrasts, showing
&lt;blockquote&gt;imperturbable sang-froid [again the words are Gautier's], artful foolishness and foolish finesse, brazen and naïve gluttony, blustering cowardice, skeptical credulity, scornful servility, preoccupied insouciance, indolent activity, and all those surprising contrasts that must be expressed by a wink of the eye, by a puckering of the mouth, by a knitting of the brow, by a fleeting gesture.&lt;ref&gt;In ''La Presse'', August 31, 1846; tr. Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As the Gautier citations suggest, Deburau early—about 1828—caught the attention of the [[Romanticism|Romantics]], and soon he was being celebrated in the reviews of [[Charles Nodier]] and Gautier, in an article by [[Charles Baudelaire]] on "The Essence of Laughter" (1855), and in the poetry of [[Théodore de Banville]]. A pantomime produced at the Funambules in 1828, ''The Gold Dream, or Harlequin and the Miser'', was widely thought to be the work of Nodier, and both Gautier and Banville wrote Pierrot playlets that were eventually produced on other stages—''Posthumous Pierrot'' (1847) and ''The Kiss'' (1887), respectively.&lt;ref&gt;For a full discussion of the connection of all these writers with Deburau's Pierrot, see Storey, ''Pierrot: a critical history'', pp. 104, 110–112, and Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', pp. 7, 74–151.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Shakespeare at the Funambules" and aftermath===
In 1842, Deburau was inadvertently responsible for translating Pierrot into the realm of tragic myth, heralding the isolated and doomed figure—often the ''[[fin-de-siècle]]'' artist's alter-ego—of [[Decadent movement|Decadent]], Symbolist, and early [[Modernism|Modernist]] art and literature. In that year, Gautier, drawing upon Deburau's newly acquired audacity as a Pierrot, as well as upon the Romantics’ store of Shakespearean plots and of Don-Juanesque legend, published a "review" of a pantomime he claimed to have seen at the Funambules.

[[Image:Adolphe Willette - Pierrot tickles Columbine to death.jpg|thumb|Pierrot tickles Columbine to death. Drawing by [[Adolphe Willette]] in ''Le Pierrot'', December 7, 1888, inspired by [[Paul Margueritte]]'s ''Pierrot, Murderer of His Wife'', 1881.]]
He entitled it "Shakespeare at the Funambules", and in it he summarized and analyzed an unnamed pantomime of unusually somber events: Pierrot murders an old-clothes man for garments to court a duchess, then is skewered in turn by the sword with which he stabbed the peddler when the latter's ghost lures him into a dance at his wedding. The pantomime under "review" was a fabrication (though it inspired a hack to turn it into an actual pantomime, ''The Ol’ Clo's Man'' [1842], in which Deburau probably appeared&lt;ref&gt;Gautier's "review" appeared in the ''Revue de Paris'' on September 4, 1842, but the manuscript of ''The Ol’ Clo's Man'' that was submitted for approval to the censor's office before production of the pantomime bears the date October 17, 1842. Many passages in the manuscript were obviously plagiarized from Gautier's "review." The MS survives in the Archives Nationales de France as document F&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; 1087, manuscript #4426. For details, as well as the argument that Deburau appeared in the pantomime, see Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', pp. 41–44.  For a full translation of Gautier's "review" into English, see Storey, "Shakespeare".&lt;/ref&gt;—and also inspired Barrault's wonderful recreation of it in ''Children of Paradise''). But it importantly marked a turning-point in Pierrot's career: henceforth Pierrot could bear comparisons with the serious over-reachers of high literature, like [[Don Juan]] or [[Macbeth (character)|Macbeth]]; he could be a victim—even unto death—of his own cruelty and daring.

When [[Gustave Courbet]] drew a crayon illustration for ''The Black Arm'' (1856), a pantomime by [[Fernand Desnoyers]] written for another mime, Paul Legrand (see next section), the Pierrot who quakes with fear as a black arm snakes up from the ground before him is clearly a child of the Pierrot in ''The Ol’ Clo's Man''. So, too, are [[Honoré Daumier]]'s Pierrots: creatures often suffering a harrowing anguish.&lt;ref&gt;[[Image:Jean-Léon Gérôme - Duel After a Masquerade Ball.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Léon Gérôme]]: ''Duel after a Masked Ball'', 1857. Condé Museum, Chantilly.]][[Image:Thomas Couture - The Supper after the Masked Ball.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Couture]]: ''The Supper after the Masked Ball'', c. 1855. The Art Institute of Chicago.]]See Lawner, pp. 161–163. Of course not all mid-century painters were afflicted with the Romantics’ ''[[mal du siècle]]''. [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] seems to have painted his ''Duel after a Masked Ball'' (1857) solely for the sake of the drama inherent in Pierrot's slumped and dying body, his blood slowly staining the snow as Harlequin, his assassin, walks calmly away. [[Thomas Couture]]'s Pierrot paintings—especially ''The Supper after the Masked Ball'' (c. 1855), with its Pierrot enthroned on a banquet table, gazing down ruefully at his passed-out fellow-revelers—have sometimes a frankly vulgar (which is to say, a solidly commercial) appeal.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860, Deburau was directly credited with inspiring such anguish, when, in a novella called ''Pierrot'' by [[Henri Rivière (naval officer)|Henri Rivière]], the mime-protagonist blames his real-life murder of a treacherous Harlequin on Baptiste's "sinister" cruelties. Among the most celebrated of pantomimes in the latter part of the century would appear sensitive moon-mad souls duped into criminality—usually by love of a fickle Columbine—and so inevitably marked for destruction ([[Paul Margueritte]]'s ''Pierrot, Murderer of His Wife'' [1881]; the mime Séverin's ''Poor Pierrot'' [1891]; [[Catulle Mendès]]’ ''Ol’ Clo's Man'' [1896], modeled on Gautier's "review").&lt;ref&gt;On these pantomimes and on late nineteenth-century French pantomime in general, see Storey, ''Pierrot: a critical history'', pp. 115-33, and ''Pierrots on the stage'', pp. 253-315.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pantomime after Baptiste: Charles Deburau, Paul Legrand, and their successors===
[[Image:Pierrot photographe.jpg|thumb|[[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar]]: Charles Deburau as Pierrot, 1854.]]
Deburau's son, [[Charles Deburau|Jean-Charles]] (or, as he preferred, "Charles" [1829–1873]), assumed Pierrot's blouse the year after his father's death, and he was praised for bringing Baptiste's agility to the role.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Gautier in ''Le Moniteur Universel'', August 30, 1858; tr. Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Nadar (artist)|Nadar]]'s photographs of him in various poses are some of the best to come out of his studio—if not some of the best of the era.)&lt;ref&gt;For a gallery of these photographs, see {{cite web |url=https://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=nadar%20charles%20deburau%20pierrot&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi |title=Pierrots |date= |work= |publisher=Google Images |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But the most important Pierrot of mid-century was Charles-Dominique-Martin Legrand, known as [[Paul Legrand]] (1816–1898; see photo at top of page). In 1839, Legrand made his debut at the Funambules as the lover Leander in the pantomimes, and when he began appearing as Pierrot, in 1845, he brought a new sensibility to the character. A mime whose talents were dramatic rather than acrobatic, Legrand helped steer the pantomime away from the old fabulous and knockabout world of fairy-land and into the realm of sentimental—often tearful—realism.&lt;ref&gt;Many reviewers of his pantomimes make note of this tendency: see, e.g., Gautier, ''Le Moniteur Universel'', October 15, 1855; July 28, 1856; August 30, 1858; tr. Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', pp. 66–68.&lt;/ref&gt; In this he was abetted by the novelist and journalist [[Champfleury]], who set himself the task, in the 1840s, of writing "realistic" pantomimes.&lt;ref&gt;Champfleury, [https://archive.org/stream/souvenirsdefuna00chamgoog#page/n15/mode/2up p. 6.]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the works he produced were ''Marquis Pierrot'' (1847), which offers a plausible explanation for Pierrot's powdered face (he begins working-life as a miller's assistant), and the ''Pantomime of the Attorney'' (1865), which casts Pierrot in the prosaic role of an attorney's clerk.
[[Image:Ch.Leandre PierrotEtColombine.png|thumb|left|[[Georges Wague]] in one of the ''cantomimes'' (pantomimes performed to off-stage songs) of [[Xavier Privas]]. Poster by [[Charles Lucien Léandre|Charles Léandre]], 1899.]]
Legrand left the Funambules in 1853 for what was to become his chief venue, the [[Folies-Nouvelles]], which attracted the fashionable and artistic set, unlike the Funambules’ working-class children of paradise. Such an audience was not averse to pantomimic experiment, and at mid-century "experiment" very often meant [[Realism (arts)|Realism]]. (The pre-''[[Madame Bovary|Bovary]]'' [[Gustave Flaubert]] wrote a pantomime for the Folies-Nouvelles, ''Pierrot in the Seraglio'' [1855], which was never produced.)&lt;ref&gt;The pantomime is summarized and analyzed by Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', pp. 152–179.&lt;/ref&gt; Legrand often appeared in realistic costume, his chalky face his only concession to tradition, leading some advocates of pantomime, like Gautier, to lament that he was betraying the character of the type.&lt;ref&gt;On the Folies-Nouvelles, Legrand's pantomime, and Champfleury's relationship to both, see Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', pp. 36–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

But it was the Pierrot as conceived by Legrand that had the greatest influence on future mimes. Charles himself eventually capitulated: it was he who played the Pierrot of Champfleury's ''Pantomime of the Attorney''. Like Legrand, Charles's student, the Marseilles mime [[Charles Deburau#Louis Rouffe|Louis Rouffe]] (1849–1885), rarely performed in Pierrot's costume, earning him the epithet "''l'Homme Blanc''" ("The White Man").&lt;ref&gt;Séverin, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; His successor [[Charles Deburau#Séverin|Séverin]] (1863–1930) played Pierrot sentimentally, as a doom-laden soul, a figure far removed from the conception of Deburau ''père''.&lt;ref&gt;Séverin, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; And one of the last great mimes of the century, [[Georges Wague]] (1875–1965), though he began his career in Pierrot's costume, ultimately dismissed Baptiste's work as puerile and embryonic, averring that it was time for Pierrot's demise in order to make way for "characters less conventional, more human."&lt;ref&gt;Wague, pp. 8–11, 17; Rémy, ''George Wague'', p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcel Marceau]]'s Bip seems a natural, if deliberate, outgrowth of these developments, walking, as he does, a concessionary line between the early fantastic domain of Deburau's Pierrot and the so-called realistic world.

In the 1880s and 1890s, the pantomime reached a kind of apogee, and Pierrot became ubiquitous.&lt;ref&gt;On late nineteenth-/early twentieth-century French pantomime, see Bonnet; Martinez; Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', pp. 253-315; and Rolfe, pp. 143-58.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he acquired a counterpart, Pierrette, who rivaled Columbine for his affections. (She seems to have been especially endearing to [[Xavier Privas]], hailed in 1899 as the "prince of songwriters": several of his songs ["Pierrette Is Dead", "Pierrette's Christmas"] are devoted to her fortunes.) A [[Cercle Funambulesque]] was founded in 1888, and Pierrot (sometimes played by female mimes, such as [[Félicia Mallet]]) dominated its productions until its demise in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;See Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', pp. 284–294.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sarah Bernhardt]] even donned Pierrot's blouse for [[Jean Richepin]]'s ''Pierrot the Murderer'' (1883).

But French mimes and actors were not the only figures responsible for Pierrot's ubiquity: the English Hanlon brothers (sometimes called the [[Hanlon-Lees]]), gymnasts and acrobats who had been schooled in the 1860s in pantomimes from Baptiste's repertoire, traveled (and dazzled) the world well into the twentieth century with their pantomimic sketches and extravaganzas featuring riotously nightmarish Pierrots. The [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalists]]—[[Émile Zola]] especially, who wrote glowingly of them—were captivated by their art.&lt;ref&gt;See Cosdon, p.49.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmond de Goncourt]] modeled his acrobat-mimes in his ''The Zemganno Brothers'' (1879) upon them; [[J.-K. Huysmans]] (whose ''[[À rebours|Against Nature]]'' [1884] would become [[The Picture of Dorian Gray|Dorian Gray]]'s bible) and his friend Léon Hennique wrote their pantomime ''[[s:fr:Pierrot sceptique (pantomime)|Pierrot the Skeptic]]'' (1881) after seeing them perform at the Folies Bergère. (And, in turn, [[Jules Laforgue]] wrote his pantomime ''Pierrot the Cut-Up'' [''Pierrot fumiste'', 1882]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.laforgue.org/Pierrot.htm|title=Pierrot fumiste (Jules Laforgue)|website=www.laforgue.org|access-date=2016-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; after reading the scenario by Huysmans and Hennique.)&lt;ref&gt;On the influence of the Hanlons on Goncourt and Huysmans and Hennique, see Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', pp. 182–188, 217–222; on the influence of Huysmans/Hennique on Laforgue's pantomime, see Storey, ''Pierrot: a critical history'', p. 145, 154.&lt;/ref&gt; It was in part through the enthusiasm that they excited, coupled with the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]]’ taste for popular entertainment, like the circus and the music-hall, as well as the new bohemianism that then reigned in artistic quarters like [[Montmartre]] (and which was celebrated by such denizens as [[Adolphe Willette]], whose cartoons and canvases are crowded with Pierrots)—it was through all this that Pierrot achieved almost unprecedented currency and visibility towards the end of the century.
;Visual arts, fiction, poetry, music, and film
He invaded the visual arts&lt;ref&gt;See Lawner; Kellein; also the plates in Palacio, and the plates and tailpieces in Storey's two books.&lt;/ref&gt;—not only in the work of Willette, but also in the illustrations and posters of [[Jules Chéret]];&lt;ref&gt;For posters by Willette, Chéret, and many other late nineteenth-century artists, see Maindron.&lt;/ref&gt; in the engravings of [[Odilon Redon]] (''The Swamp Flower: A Sad Human Head'' [1885]); and in the canvases of [[Georges Seurat]] (''Pierrot with a White Pipe [Aman-Jean]'' [1883]; ''The Painter Aman-Jean as Pierrot'' [1883]), [[Léon Comerre]] (''Pierrot'' [1884]), [[Henri Rousseau]] (''A Carnival Night'' [1886]), [[Paul Cézanne]] (''Mardi gras [Pierrot and Harlequin]'' [1888]), [[Fernand Pelez]] (''Grimaces and Miseries'' a.k.a. ''The Saltimbanques'' [1888]), [[Pablo Picasso]] (''Pierrot and Columbine'' [1900]), [[Guillaume Seignac]] (''Pierrot's Embrace'' [1900]), and [[Édouard Vuillard]] (''The Black Pierrot'' [c. 1890]). The mime "Tombre" of Jean Richepin's novel ''Nice People'' (''Braves Gens'' [1886]) turned him into a pathetic and alcoholic "phantom"; [[Paul Verlaine]] imagined him as a gormandizing naïf in "Pantomime" (1869), then, like Tombre, as a lightning-lit specter in "Pierrot" (1868, pub. 1882).&lt;ref&gt;For a full discussion of Verlaine's many versions of Pierrot, see Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', pp. 230-52.&lt;/ref&gt; Laforgue put three of the "complaints" of his first published volume of poems (1885) into "Lord" Pierrot's mouth—and dedicated his next book, ''[[L'Imitation de Notre-Dame la Lune|The Imitation of Our Lady the Moon]]'' (1886), completely to Pierrot and his world. (Pierrots were legion among the minor, now-forgotten poets: for samples, see Willette's journal ''The Pierrot'', which appeared between 1888 and 1889, then again in 1891.) In the realm of song, [[Claude Debussy]] set both Verlaine's "Pantomime" and Banville's "Pierrot" (1842) to music in 1881 (not published until 1926)—the only precedents among works by major composers being the "Pierrot" section of [[Telemann]]'s ''Burlesque Overture'' (1717–22), [[Mozart]]'s 1783 "Masquerade" (in which Mozart himself took the role of Harlequin and his brother-in-law, [[Joseph Lange]], that of Pierrot),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Deutsch|1966|p=213}}. The score, which is fragmentary, exists as K. 446.&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Pierrot" section of [[Robert Schumann]]'s ''Carnival'' (1835).&lt;ref&gt;Debussy may have added the operetta ''Mon ami Pierrot'' (1862) by [[Léo Delibes]], whom he admired, to this list. He probably would have excluded [[Jacques Offenbach]]'s ''Pierrot Clown'', a theater score of 1855.&lt;/ref&gt; Even the embryonic art of the motion picture turned to Pierrot before the century was out: he appeared, not only in early celluloid shorts ([[Georges Méliès]]'s ''The Nightmare'' [1896], ''The Magician'' [1898]; [[Alice Guy]]'s ''Arrival of Pierrette and Pierrot'' [1900], ''Pierrette's Amorous Adventures'' [1900]; Ambroise-François Parnaland's ''Pierrot's Big Head/Pierrot's Tongue'' [1900], ''Pierrot-Drinker'' [1900]), but also in [[Emile Reynaud]]'s [[Praxinoscope]] production of ''[[Pauvre Pierrot|Poor Pierrot]]'' (1892), the first animated movie and the first hand-colored one.

====Belgium====
In Belgium, where the [[Decadent movement|Decadents]] and [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]] were as numerous as their French counterparts, [[Félicien Rops]] depicted a grinning Pierrot who is witness to an unromantic backstage scene (''Blowing Cupid's Nose'' [1881]) and [[James Ensor]] painted Pierrots (and other masks) obsessively, sometimes rendering them prostrate in the ghastly light of dawn (''The Strange Masks'' [1892]), sometimes isolating Pierrot in their midst, his head drooping in despondency (''Pierrot's Despair'' [1892]), sometimes augmenting his company with a smiling, stein-hefting skeleton (''Pierrot and Skeleton in Yellow'' [1893]). Their countryman the poet [[Albert Giraud]] also identified intensely with the ''zanni'': the fifty [[Rondel (poem)|rondels]] of his ''[[Pierrot lunaire (book)|Pierrot lunaire]]'' (''Moonstruck Pierrot'' [1884]) would inspire several generations of composers (see '''''[[#Pierrot lunaire|Pierrot lunaire]]''''' below), and his verse-play ''Pierrot-Narcissus'' (1887) offered a definitive portrait of the solipsistic poet-dreamer. The title of choreographer [[Joseph Hansen (dancer)|Joseph Hansen]]'s 1884 ballet, ''Macabre Pierrot'', created in collaboration with the poet Théo Hannon, summed up one of the chief strands of the character's persona for many artists of the era.

====England====
[[Image:Aubrey Beardsley - Death of Pierrot.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Aubrey Beardsley]]: "The Death of Pierrot", ''[[The Savoy (periodical)|The Savoy]]'', August 1896.]]In the England of the [[Aesthetic Movement]], Pierrot figured prominently in the drawings of [[Aubrey Beardsley]]; various writers&amp;mdash;[[Henry Austin Dobson]], [[Arthur Symons]], [[Olive Custance]]&amp;mdash;seized upon him for their poetry ("After Watteau" [1893],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dobson|first=Austin|author-link=Henry Austin Dobson|chapter=After Watteau|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/collectedpoems01dobsgoog#page/n490/mode/2up|title=Collected Poems|year=1913|page=476|edition=9th|publisher=[[E.P.

One of the [[Social gadfly|gadflies]] of [[Aestheticism]], [[W. S. Gilbert]], introduced Harlequin and Pierrot as love-struck twin brothers into ''[[Eyes and No Eyes|Eyes and No Eyes, or The Art of Seeing]]'' (1875), for which [[Thomas German Reed]] wrote the music. And he ensured that neither character, contrary to many an Aesthetic Pierrot, would be amorously disappointed.

In a more bourgeois vein, Ethel Wright painted ''Bonjour, Pierrot!'' (a greeting to a dour clown sitting disconsolate with his dog) in 1893. And the Pierrot of popular taste also spawned a uniquely English entertainment. In 1891, the singer and banjoist [[Clifford Essex]] returned from France enamored of the Pierrots he had seen there and resolved to create a troupe of English Pierrot entertainers. Thus were born the [[Concert Party (entertainment)|seaside Pierrots]] (in [[Pointed hat|conical hat]]s and sometimes black or colored costume) who, as late as the 1950s, sang, danced, juggled, and joked on the piers of [[Brighton]] and [[Margate]] and [[Blackpool]].&lt;ref&gt;See Pertwee.&lt;/ref&gt; Obviously inspired by these troupes were the Will Morris Pierrots, named after their [[Birmingham]] founder. They originated in the [[Smethwick]] area in the late 1890s and played to large audiences in many parks, theaters, and pubs in [[the Midlands]]. It was doubtless these popular entertainers who inspired the academic [[Walter Westley Russell]] to commit ''The Pierrots'' (c. 1900) to canvas.

It was neither the Aesthetic nor the popular Pierrot that claimed the attention of the great theater innovator [[Edward Gordon Craig]].  The appeal of the mask seems to have been the same that drew Craig to the "Über-Marionette": the sense that Pierrot was a symbolic embodiment of an aspect of the spiritual life&amp;mdash;Craig invokes [[William Blake]]&amp;mdash;and in no way a vehicle of "blunt" materialistic Realism.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;  Craig's involvement with the figure was incremental.  In 1897, Craig, dressed as Pierrot, gave a quasi-impromptu stage-reading of [[Hans Christian Andersen]]’s story "What the Moon Saw" as part of a benefit for a destitute and stranded troupe of provincial players.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Shaw (composer)|Martin Shaw]], [http://www.martinshawmusic.com/articles/egc_how_we_met.html ''How We Met&amp;mdash;Edward Gordon Craig and Martin Shaw''].&lt;/ref&gt;  Two years later, in his journal ''The Page'', he published (under the pseudonym "S.M. Fox")&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peral Vega|2015|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; a short story, "The Last of the Pierrots",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Craig|first=Edward Gordon|author-link=Edward Gordon Craig|chapter=The Last of the Pierrots|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/gri_33125014420794#page/n33/mode/2up/search/the+last+of+the+pierrots|title=The Page|via=Internet Archive|year=1899|pages=35–53|volume=Volume 2, Number 2 (erroneously identified as "Number 1" on cover) |number=2 |access-date=2016-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a shaming attack upon the modern commercialization of Carnival. However, his most important contribution to the Pierrot canon was not to appear until after the turn of the century (see '''[[#Plays, playlets, pantomimes, and revues|Plays, playlets, pantomimes, and revues]]''' below).

''Pierrot and Pierrette'' (1896) was a specimen of early English film from the director [[Birt Acres]]. For an account of the English mime troupe The Hanlon Brothers, see '''[[#France 2|France]]''' above.

====Germany====
[[Image:Paul Hoecker-Pierrot mit Pfeifen.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul Hoecker]]: ''Pierrots with Pipes'', c. 1900. Location unknown.]]In Germany, [[Frank Wedekind]] introduced the ''[[femme-fatale]]'' of his first "Lulu" play, ''[[Earth Spirit (play)|Earth Spirit]]'' (1895), in a Pierrot costume; and when the Austrian composer [[Alban Berg]] drew upon the play for his opera ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'' (unfinished; first perf. 1937), he retained the scene of Lulu's meretricious pierroting. In a similarly (and paradoxically) revealing spirit, the painter [[Paul Hoecker]] put cheeky young men into Pierrot costumes to ape their complacent burgher elders, smoking their pipes (''Pierrots with Pipes'' [c. 1900]) and swilling their champagne (''Waiting Woman'' [c. 1895]). (See also '''''[[#Pierrot lunaire|Pierrot lunaire]]''''' below.)

====Italy====
Canio's Pagliaccio in the famous [[Pagliacci|opera]] (1892) by [[Leoncavallo]] is close enough to a Pierrot to deserve a mention here. Much less well-known is the musical "mimodrama" of [[Vittorio Monti]], ''Noël de Pierrot'' a.k.a. ''A Clown's Christmas'' (1900), its score set to a pantomime by Fernand Beissier, one of the founders of the [[Cercle Funambulesque]].&lt;ref&gt;Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; (Monti would go on to claim his rightful fame by celebrating another spiritual outsider, much akin to Pierrot&amp;mdash;the [[Romani people|Gypsy]]. His ''[[Csárdás (Monti)|Csárdás]]'' [c. 1904], like ''[[Pagliacci]]'', has found a secure place in the standard musical repertoire.)

====Spain====
In 1895, the playwright and future [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel]] laureate [[Jacinto Benavente]] wrote rapturously in his journal of a performance of the [[Hanlon-Lees]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peral Vega|2015|pp=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and three years later he published his only pantomime: ‘’The Whiteness of Pierrot’’.  A true [[fin-de-siècle]] mask, Pierrot paints his face black to commit robbery and murder; then, after restoring his pallor, he hides himself, terrified of his own undoing, in a snowbank&amp;mdash;forever.  Thus does he forfeit his union with Columbine (the intended beneficiary of his crimes) for a frosty marriage with the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peral Vega|2015|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====North America====
Pierrot and his fellow masks were late in coming to the United States, which, unlike England, Russia, and the countries of continental Europe, had had no early exposure to ''commedia dell'arte''.&lt;ref&gt;It is in part for this reason&amp;mdash;that Pierrot was a late and somewhat alien import to America&amp;mdash;that the early poems of '''[[T.S. Eliot]]''' that were closely modeled on the Pierrot poems of [[Jules Laforgue]] do not allude to Pierrot by name.  See Storey, ''Pierrot: a critical history'', pp. 156-67.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hanlon-Lees]] made their first U.S. appearance in 1858, and their subsequent tours, well into the twentieth century, of scores of cities throughout the country accustomed their audiences to their fantastic, acrobatic Pierrots.&lt;ref&gt;For an exhaustive account of the Hanlons' appearances in America (and elsewhere), see Mark Cosdon, [http://docplayer.net/4059524-A-chronological-outline-of-the-hanlon-brothers-1833-1931-mark-cosdon-allegheny-college.html "A Chronological Outline of the Hanlon Brothers, 1833-1931".]&lt;/ref&gt; But the Pierrot that would leave the deepest imprint upon the American imagination was that of the French and English [[Decadent movement|Decadents]], a creature who quickly found his home in the so-called [[little magazines]] of the 1890s (as well as in the poster-art that they spawned). One of the earliest and most influential of these in America, ''[[The Chap-Book]]'' (1894–98), which featured a story about Pierrot by the aesthete [[Percival Pollard]] in its second number,&lt;ref&gt;"For a Jest's Sake" (1894).&lt;/ref&gt; was soon host to Beardsley-inspired Pierrots drawn by E.B. Bird and Frank Hazenplug.&lt;ref&gt;See reproductions (in poster form) in Margolin, pp. 110, 111.&lt;/ref&gt; (The Canadian poet [[Bliss Carman]] should also be mentioned for his contribution to Pierrot's dissemination in mass-market publications like ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]''.)&lt;ref&gt;Carman's "The Last Room. From the Departure of Pierrot" appeared originally in the August 1899 number of ''Harper's''; it is reprinted (as "The Last Room") in {{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/balladsandlyric00carmgoog#page/n87/mode/2up/search/columbine|title=Ballads and Lyrics|website=archive.org|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like most things associated with the Decadence, such exotica discombobulated the mainstream American public, which regarded the little magazines in general as "freak periodicals" and declared, through one of its mouthpieces, ''[[Munsey's Magazine]]'', that "each new representative of the species is, if possible, more preposterous than the last."&lt;ref&gt;Summer issue, 1896; cited in Margolin, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;  And yet the Pierrot of that species was gaining a foothold elsewhere.  The composers [[Amy Beach]] and [[Arthur Foote]] devoted a section to Pierrot (as well as to Pierrette) in two ludic pieces for piano&amp;mdash;Beach's ''Children's Carnival'' (1894) and Foote's ''Five Bagatelles'' (1893).

The fin-de-siècle world in which this Pierrot resided was clearly at odds with the reigning American Realist and Naturalist aesthetic (though such figures as [[Ambrose Bierce]] and [[John LaFarge]] were mounting serious challenges to it). It is in fact jarring to find the champion of American prose Realism, [[William Dean Howells]], introducing ''Pastels in Prose'' (1890), a volume of French [[Prose poetry|prose-poems]] containing a [[Paul Margueritte]] pantomime, ''The Death of Pierrot'',&lt;ref&gt;It also contains a short tale of Pierrot by Paul Leclercq, "A Story in White".&lt;/ref&gt; with words of warm praise (and even congratulations to each poet for failing “to saddle his reader with a moral”).&lt;ref&gt;Merrill, [https://archive.org/stream/pastelsinprose00merrgoog#page/n10/mode/2up p. vii.]&lt;/ref&gt; So uncustomary was the French Aesthetic viewpoint that, when Pierrot made an appearance in ''Pierrot the Painter'' (1893),&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1894/02/16/106093868.pdf "Mr. Sargent's Pupils Again"], ''New York Times'', February 16, 1894.&lt;/ref&gt; a pantomime by [[Alfred Thompson (librettist)|Alfred Thompson]], set to music by the American composer [[Laura Sedgwick Collins]], ''The New York Times'' covered it as an event, even though it was only a student production. It was found to be “pleasing” because, in part, it was “odd”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1893/12/08/109271203.pdf “Pierrot at Berkeley Lyceum”], ''New York Times'', December 8, 1893.&lt;/ref&gt; Not until the first decade of the next century, when the great (and popular) fantasist [[Maxfield Parrish]] worked his magic on the figure, would Pierrot be comfortably naturalized in America.

Of course, writers from the United States living abroad&amp;mdash;especially in Paris or London&amp;mdash;were aberrantly susceptible to the charms of the Decadence.  Such a figure was [[Stuart Merrill]], who consorted with the French [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]] and who compiled and translated the pieces in ''Pastels in Prose''.  Another was [[William Theodore Peters]], an acquaintance of [[Ernest Dowson]] and other members of the [[Rhymers' Club]] and a driving force behind the conception and theatrical realization of Dowson's ''Pierrot of the Minute'' (1897; see '''[[#England 2|England]]''' above).  Of the three books that Peters published before his death (of starvation)&lt;ref&gt;Muddiman,  [https://archive.org/stream/menofnineties00muddiala#page/96/mode/2up p. 97].&lt;/ref&gt; at the age of forty-two, his ''Posies out of Rings: And Other Conceits'' (1896) is most notable here: in it, four poems and an "Epilogue" for the aforementioned Dowson play are devoted to Pierrot.  (From the mouth of Pierrot ''loquitur'': "Although this pantomime of life is passing fine,/Who would be happy must not marry Columbine".)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/posiesoutofrings00peteiala#page/6/mode/2up|title=Posies out of rings, and other conceits|website=archive.org|access-date=2016-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another pocket of North-American sympathy with the Decadence&amp;mdash;one manifestation of what the Latin world called ''[[modernismo]]''&amp;mdash;could be found in the progressive literary scene of Mexico, its parent country, Spain, having been long conversant with the ''commedia dell'arte''.  In 1897, [[:es:Bernardo Couto Castillo|Bernardo Couto Castillo]], another Decadent who, at the age of twenty-two, died even more tragically young than Peters, embarked on a series of Pierrot-themed short stories&amp;mdash;"Pierrot Enamored of Glory" (1897), "Pierrot and His Cats" (1898), "The Nuptials of Pierrot" (1899), "Pierrot's Gesture" (1899), "The Caprices of Pierrot" (1900)&amp;mdash;culminating, after the turn of the century (and in the year of Couto's death), with "Pierrot-Gravedigger" (1901).&lt;ref&gt;All collected in Muñoz Fernández.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the Spanish-speaking world, according to scholar Emilio Peral Vega, Couto "expresses that first manifestation of Pierrot as an alter ego in a game of symbolic otherness ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peral Vega|2015|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Central and South America====
Inspired by the French [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]], especially Verlaine, [[Rubén Darío]], the Nicaraguan poet widely acknowledged as the founder of Spanish-American literary Modernism (''[[modernismo]]''), placed Pierrot ("sad poet and dreamer") in opposition to Columbine ("fatal woman", the arch-materialistic "lover of rich silk garments, golden jewelry, pearls and diamonds")&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sarabia|1987|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his 1898 prose-poem ''The Eternal Adventure of Pierrot and Columbine''.

====Russia====
In the last year of the century, Pierrot appeared in a Russian ballet, ''[[Les Millions d'Arlequin|Harlequin's Millions]]'' a.k.a. ''Harlequinade'' (1900), its libretto and choreography by [[Marius Petipa]], its music by [[Riccardo Drigo]], its dancers the members of St. Petersburg's [[Mariinsky Ballet|Imperial Ballet]]. It would set the stage for the later and greater triumphs of Pierrot in the productions of the [[Ballets Russes]].

==Nineteenth-century legacy==
The Pierrot bequeathed to the twentieth century had acquired a rich and wide range of personae. He was the naïve butt of practical jokes and amorous scheming (Gautier); the prankish but innocent waif (Banville, Verlaine, Willette); the narcissistic dreamer clutching at the moon, which could symbolize many things, from spiritual perfection to death (Giraud, Laforgue, Willette, Dowson); the frail, [[Neurasthenia|neurasthenic]], often doom-ridden soul (Richepin, Beardsley); the clumsy, though ardent, lover, who wins Columbine's heart,&lt;ref&gt;This is the case in many works by minor writers of the ''fin-de-siècle''—e.g., Léo Rouanet, ''The Belly and Heart of Pierrot'' (1888), summarized in Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', pp. 299–300.&lt;/ref&gt; or murders her in frustration (Margueritte); the cynical and misogynistic [[dandy]], sometimes dressed in black (Huysmans/Hennique, Laforgue); the Christ-like victim of the martyrdom that is Art (Giraud, Willette, Ensor); the androgynous and unholy creature of corruption (Richepin, Wedekind); the madcap master of chaos (the Hanlon-Lees); the purveyor of hearty and wholesome fun (the English pier Pierrots)—and various combinations of these. Like the earlier masks of ''commedia dell'arte'', Pierrot now knew no national boundaries. Thanks to the international gregariousness of Modernism, he would soon be found everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;See Green and Swan.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pierrot and Modernism==
Pierrot played a seminal role in the emergence of [[Modernism]] in the arts.  He was a key figure in every art-form except architecture.

With respect to '''poetry''', [[T. S. Eliot]]'s "breakthrough work",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kerrigan|2015|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]]" (1915), owed its existence to the poems of [[Jules Laforgue]], whose ''"ton 'pierrot'"''&lt;ref&gt;"Pierrot-like tone": Taupin, p. 277. 
 Cf. the words of critic [[Arthur Symons]]: "His [i.e., Laforgue's] laughter, which [[Maurice Maeterlinck|Maeterlinck]] has defined so admirably as 'the laughter of the soul', is the laughter of Pierrot, more than half a sob, and shaken out of him with a deplorable gesture of the thin arms, thrown wide.  He is a metaphysical Pierrot, a ''Pierrot lunaire'' ..." ([https://archive.org/stream/symbolistmovemen00symouoft#page/304/mode/2up/search/Pierrot p. 304]).  Eliot read these words in his 1908 edition of Symons' ''Symbolist Movement in Literature'', which [[The Symbolist Movement in Literature#Influence|introduced him]] to Laforgue.&lt;/ref&gt; informed all of Eliot's early poetry.&lt;ref&gt;"The form in which I began to write, in 1908 or 1909, was directly drawn from the study of Laforgue ...": Eliot, in his Introduction to the ''Selected Poems'' of Ezra Pound; cited in Storey, ''Pierrot: a critical history'', p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;  (Laforgue, he said, "was the first to teach me how to speak, to teach me the poetic possibilities of my own idiom of speech.")&lt;ref&gt;Lecture at the Italian Institute in London, 1950; cited in Storey, ''Pierrot: a critical history'', p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;  Prufrock is a Pierrot transplanted to America.&lt;ref&gt;See Storey, ''Pierrot: a critical history'', pp. 163-66.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another prominent Modernist, [[Wallace Stevens]], was undisguised in his identification with Pierrot in his earliest poems and letters&amp;mdash;an identification that he later complicated and refined through such avatars as Bowl (in ''Bowl, Cat and Broomstick'' [1917]), Carlos (in ''Carlos Among the Candles'' [1917]), and, most importantly, Crispin (in "The Comedian as the Letter C" [1923]).&lt;ref&gt;See Storey, ''Pierrot: a critical history'', pp. 167-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

As for '''fiction''', [[William Faulkner]] began his career as a chronicler of Pierrot's amorous disappointments and existential anguish in such little-known works as his play ''The Marionettes'' (1920) and the verses of his ''Vision in Spring'' (1921), works that were an early and revealing declaration of the novelist's "fragmented state".&lt;ref&gt;"Pierrot was Faulkner's fictional representation of his fragmented state": Sensibar, p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;  (Some critics have argued that Pierrot stands behind the semi-autobiographical [[Nick Adams (character)|Nick Adams]] of Faulkner's fellow-[[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel]] laureate [[Ernest Hemingway]],&lt;ref&gt;Green and Swan, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; and another contends that [[James Joyce]]'s [[Stephen Dedalus]], again an avatar of his own creator, also shares the same parentage.)&lt;ref&gt;Dick, pp. 69-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''music''', historians of Modernism generally place [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s 1912 song-cycle ''[[Pierrot lunaire]]'' at the very pinnacle of High-Modernist achievement.&lt;ref&gt;"Wherever we look in the history of its reception, whether in general histories of the modern period, in more ephemeral press response, in the comments of musical leaders like [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] or [[Pierre Boulez|Boulez]], in pedagogical sources, or in specialized research studies, the overwhelming reaction to ''Pierrot'' has been an awestruck veneration of its originality": Dunsby, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  And in '''ballet''', [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s [[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]] (1911), in which the traditionally [[Pulcinella]]-like clown wears the heart of Pierrot,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clayton|1993|p=137}}; see also "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42PyU3SM6U Two Clowns: Pierrot meets Petrushka]" by the Israeli Chamber Project.&lt;/ref&gt; is often argued to have attained the same stature.&lt;ref&gt;"... as one of the greatest ballets [''Petrushka''] remains unassailed": Robert, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

Students of Modernist '''painting''' and '''sculpture''' are familiar with Pierrot (in many different attitudes, from the ineffably sad to the ebulliently impudent) through the masterworks of  his acolytes, including [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Georges Rouault]], [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Max Beckmann]], [[August Macke]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]]&amp;mdash;the list is very long (see '''[[#Visual arts|Visual arts]]''' below).

As for the '''drama''', Pierrot was a regular fixture in the plays of the [[Little Theatre Movement]] ([[Edna St. Vincent Millay]]'s ''Aria da Capo'' [1920], Robert Emmons Rogers' ''Behind a Watteau Picture'' [1918], Blanche Jennings Thompson's ''The Dream Maker'' [1922]),&lt;ref&gt;For direct access to these works, go to the footnotes following their titles in [[#Plays, playlets, pantomimes, and revues|Plays, playlets, pantomimes, and revues]] below.&lt;/ref&gt; which nourished the careers of such important Modernists as [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[Susan Glaspell]], and others.

In '''film''', a beloved early comic hero was the [[Little Tramp]] of [[Charlie Chaplin]], who conceived the character, in Chaplin's words, as "a sort of Pierrot".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chaplin|1966|p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the diverse incarnations of the nineteenth-century Pierrot would predict, the hallmarks of the Modernist Pierrot are his ambiguity and complexity.

One of his earliest appearances was in [[Alexander Blok]]'s ''The Puppet Show'' (1906), called by one theater-historian "the greatest example of the harlequinade in Russia".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clayton|1993|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]], who both directed the first production and took on the role, dramatically emphasized the multifacetedness of the character: according to one spectator, Meyerhold's Pierrot was "nothing like those familiar, falsely sugary, whining Pierrots.  Everything about him is sharply angular; in a hushed voice he whispers strange words of sadness; somehow he contrives to be caustic, heart-rending, gentle: all these things yet at the same time impudent."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Green and Swan, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;  In her own notes to ''Aria da Capo'', Edna St. Vincent Millay makes it clear that her Pierrot is not to be played as a cardboard stock type:&lt;blockquote&gt;Pierrot sees clearly into existing evils and is rendered gaily cynical by them; he is both too indolent and too indifferent to do anything about it.  Yet in several lines of the play his actual unhappiness is seen,&amp;mdash;for instance, "Moon's just a word to swear by", in  which he expresses his conviction that all beauty and romance are fled from the world.  At the end of the play the line, "Yes, and yet I dare say he is just as dead", must not be said flippantly or cynically, but slowly and with much philosophic concentration on the thought.&lt;ref&gt;Millay, [https://archive.org/stream/ariadecapoplay00millrich#page/48/mode/2up pp. 49-50].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Even Chaplin's Little Tramp, conceived broadly as a comic and sentimental type, exhibits a wide range of aspirations and behaviors.  Chaplin alleges to have told [[Mack Sennett]], after first having assumed the character,&lt;blockquote&gt;You know, this fellow is many-sided, a tramp, a gentleman, a poet, a dreamer, a lonely fellow, always hopeful of romance and adventure.  He would have you believe he is a scientist, a musician, a duke, a polo player.  However, he is not above picking up cigarette butts or robbing a baby of its candy.  And, of course, if the occasion warrants it, he will kick a lady in the rear&amp;mdash;but only in extreme anger!&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chaplin|1966|pp=148–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Late twentieth/early twenty-first centuries (1951- ): notable works==
In the latter half of the twentieth century, Pierrot continued to appear in the art of the Modernists&amp;mdash;or at least of the long-lived among them: [[Chagall]], [[Max Ernst|Ernst]], [[Marin Goleminov|Goleminov]], [[Edward Hopper|Hopper]], [[Miró]], [[Picasso]]&amp;mdash;as well as in the work of their younger followers, such as [[Gerard Dillon]], Indrek Hirv, and [[Roger Redgate]]. And when film arrived at a pinnacle of [[Auteur theory|auteurism]] in the 1950s and '60s, aligning it with the earlier Modernist aesthetic, some of its most celebrated directors&amp;mdash;[[Ingmar Bergman|Bergman]], [[Fellini]], [[Jean-Luc Godard|Godard]]&amp;mdash;turned naturally to Pierrot.

But Pierrot's most prominent place in the late twentieth century, as well as in the early twenty-first, has been in popular, not High Modernist, art. As the entries below tend to testify, Pierrot is most visible (as in the eighteenth century) in unapologetically popular genres&amp;mdash;in circus acts and street-mime sketches, TV programs and Japanese ''[[anime]]'', comic books and [[graphic novel]]s, children's books and [[young adult fiction]] (especially [[fantasy literature|fantasy]] and, in particular, [[vampire fiction]]), Hollywood films, and pop and rock music. He generally assumes one of three avatars: the sweet and innocent child (as in the children's books), the poignantly lovelorn and ineffectual being (as, notably, in the [[Jerry Cornelius]] novels of [[Michael Moorcock]]), or the somewhat sinister and depraved outsider (as in [[David Bowie]]'s various experiments, or [[Rachel Caine]]'s vampire novels, or the [[Sadomasochism|S&amp;M]] lyrics of the English rock group [[Placebo (band)|Placebo]]).

The format of the lists that follow is the same as that of the previous section, except for the Western pop-music singers and groups. These are listed alphabetically by first name, not last (e.g., "Stevie Wonder", not "Wonder, Stevie").

==''Pierrot lunaire''==
{{Main article|Pierrot lunaire (book)}}
The fifty poems that were published by [[Albert Giraud]] (born Emile Albert Kayenbergh) as ''[[Pierrot lunaire (book)|Pierrot lunaire: Rondels bergamasques]]'' in 1884 quickly attracted composers to set them to music, especially after they were translated, somewhat freely, into German (1892) by the poet and dramatist [[Otto Erich Hartleben]]. The best known and most important of these settings is the [[Atonality|atonal]] song-cycle derived from twenty-one of the poems (in Hartleben's translation) by [[Arnold Schoenberg]] in 1912, i.e., his Opus 21: ''Dreimal sieben Gedichte aus Albert Girauds'' [[Pierrot lunaire]] (''Thrice-Seven Poems from Albert Giraud's'' Pierrot lunaire—Schoenberg was numerologically superstitious).  The impact of this work on the musical world has proven to be virtually immeasurable.  It has led, among other things, to ensemble groups' appropriating Pierrot's name, such as the English [[Pierrot Players]] (1967–70),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015|pp=72–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to a number of projects&amp;mdash;such as the [[Schoenberg Institute]]'s of 1987&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Cariaga, [http://articles.latimes.com/1988-02-05/entertainment/ca-27333_1_pierrot-lunaire "First eight premieres of 'Pierrot Project'"], ''Los Angeles Times'', February 5, 1988; Martin Bernheimer, [http://articles.latimes.com/1988-11-09/entertainment/ca-203_1_schoenberg-institute "'Pierrot' sequels via Schoenberg Institute"], ''Los Angeles Times'', November 9, 1988; Gregg Wager, [http://articles.latimes.com/1989-01-27/entertainment/ca-1600_1_pierrot-lunaire "Nine premieres in third 'Pierrot Project' concert"], ''Los Angeles Times'', January 27, 1989; Timothy Mangan, [http://articles.latimes.com/1990-01-27/entertainment/ca-396_1_pierrot-lunaire "Final installment of Pierrot Project at USC"], ''Los Angeles Times'', January 27, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; and the composer Roger Marsh's of 2001-2002&lt;ref&gt;''Roger Marsh—Albert Giraud's'' Pierrot lunaire, ''fifty rondels bergamasques''. With The Hilliard Ensemble, Red Byrd, Juice, Ebor Singers &amp; Paul Gameson ''director'', Linda Hirst, Joe Marsh ''narrator''. NMC Recordings: Cat. No. NMC D127.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;that have been devised to pay homage to Schoenberg and, at the same time, to extend his avant-garde reach, thereby bringing both Hartleben's and Giraud's complete cycles to full musical fruition.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Pierrot'' settings commissioned by the Schoenberg Institute are of the Hartleben translations; those of the Marsh cycle are English translations (by Kay Bourlier) of Giraud's original poems.&lt;/ref&gt;

But the loony Pierrot behind those cycles has invaded worlds well beyond those of composers, singers, and ensemble-performers.  Theatrical groups such as the [[Opera Quotannis]] have brought Pierrot's [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] to the dramatic stage; dancers such as [[Glen Tetley]] have choreographed it; poets such as [[Wayne Koestenbaum]] have derived original inspiration from it.&lt;ref&gt;The Opera Quotannis production (with Christine Schadeberg) was premiered in 1995; Tetley's [http://www.abt.org/education/archive/ballets/pierrot_lunaire.html ballet] ({{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008020738/http://www.abt.org/education/archive/ballets/pierrot_lunaire.html |date=2015-10-08 }}) was first performed in 1962; Koestenbaum's ten ''Pierrot Lunaire'' poems appeared in his ''Best-Selling Jewish Porn Films'' (New York: Turtle Point Press, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been translated into still more distant media by painters, such as [[Paul Klee]]; fiction-writers, such as Helen Stevenson; filmmakers, such as [[Bruce LaBruce]]; and graphic-novelists, such as Antoine Dodé.&lt;ref&gt;Klee's portrait dates from 1924; Stevenson is the author of the novel ''Pierrot Lunaire'' (London: Sceptre, 1995); Bruce LaBruce's Canadian/German film ''Pierrot Lunaire'' was released in 2014;  and in 2011 Dodé published the first volume of his projected trilogy, ''Pierrot Lunaire''.&lt;/ref&gt;  A passionately sinister Pierrot Lunaire has even shadowed DC Comics' [[Batman]].&lt;ref&gt;The character made his first appearance in issue #676: ''Batman R.I.P.: Midnight in the House of Hurt'' (2008); he resumed his role in ten other issues.&lt;/ref&gt;  The inextinguishable vibrancy of Giraud's creation is aptly honored in the title of a song by the British rock-group [[Soft Machine|The Soft Machine]]: "Thank You Pierrot Lunaire" (1969).&lt;ref&gt;From the album ''[[Volume Two (The Soft Machine album)|Volume Two]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carnival and Pierrot Grenade==
Pierrot, usually in the company of Pierrette or Columbine, appears among the revelers at many carnivals of the world, most notably at the festivities of [[Carnival#Uruguay|Uruguay]].  His name suggests kinship with the Pierrot Grenade of [[Trinidad and Tobago Carnival]], but the latter seems to have no connection with the French clown.  Pierrot Grenade is apparently descended from an earlier creature indeed called "Pierrot"&amp;mdash;but this name seems to be an outsider's "correction" of the regional "Pay-wo" or "Pié-wo", probably a corruption of "Pay-roi" or "country king," which describes the stature to which the figure aspired.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carr|1956|p=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This "Pierrot"&amp;mdash;extinct by the mid-twentieth century&amp;mdash;was richly garbed, proud of his mastery of English history and literature (Shakespeare especially), and fiercely pugnacious when encountering his likes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carr|1956|pp=281–282}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pierrot Grenade, on the other hand, whose name suggests descent from the humble island of [[Grenada]] (and who seems to have evolved as a hick cousin of his namesake), dresses in ragged strips of colored cloth, sometimes adorned with cheap trinkets; he has little truck with English culture, but displays his talents (when not singing and dancing) in speechifying upon issues of the day and spelling long words in ingenious ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carr|1956|pp=283–284}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A feeble fighter, he spars mainly with his tongue&amp;mdash;formerly in [[French-based creole languages|Creole]] or [[French Patois]], when those dialects were common currency&amp;mdash;as he circulates through the crowds.  Around the mid-twentieth century, he traveled about in pairs or larger groups, contending for supremacy among his companions,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carr|1956|pp=284–285}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by the dawn of the twenty-first century, he had become rather solitary, a vestige of his former gregarious self.

[[File:Coachella pigstage.jpg|thumb|The giant inflatable pig of ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon Live]]'' tour at [[Coachella Music Festival]] on April, 2008.]]

Inflatable [[flying pig]]s were one of the staple [[Theatrical property|prop]]s of [[Pink Floyd]]'s live shows. The first was a sow, but a very obviously male pig appeared in the 1980s. Pigs appeared numerous times in [[concert]]s by the band, promoting concerts and record releases, and on the cover of their 1977 album ''[[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|Animals]]''.

The image rights for the pigs passed to [[Roger Waters]] when he split from the rest of the group,&lt;ref name="Animals Trivia and Quotes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pinkfloyd-co.com/disco/animals/animals_trivia.html |title=Animals Trivia and Quotes |accessdate=5 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611194316/http://www.pinkfloyd-co.com/disco/animals/animals_trivia.html |archivedate=11 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; though the pigs continued to be used by both post-Roger Waters Pink Floyd and Roger Waters in their gigs.

The original Pink Floyd pig was designed by Roger Waters and built in December 1976 by the artist [[Jeffrey Shaw]] with help of design team [[Hipgnosis]],&lt;ref name=medienkunstnetz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/pig-for-pink-floyd/|title= Jeffrey Shaw, "Pig for Pink Floyd"|publisher=medienkunstnetz.de|accessdate=2009-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; in preparation for shooting the cover of the ''[[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|Animals]]'' album. Plans were made to fly the {{convert|40|ft|m|order=flip|adj=on}}, [[helium]]-filled [[balloon]] over [[Battersea Power Station]] on the first day's photo-shoot, with a [[marksman]] prepared to shoot the pig down if it broke free.  However, the pig was not launched.

On the second day, the marksman wasn't present because no one had told him to return. The pig broke free due to a strong gust of wind on the third day, gaining a lot of press coverage. It disappeared from sight within five minutes, and was spotted by airline pilots at thirty thousand feet in the air.&lt;ref name=scarfe /&gt; Flights at [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow Airport]] were cancelled as the huge inflatable pig flew through the path of aircraft, eastwards from Britain and out over the [[English Channel]], finally landing on a rural farm in [[Kent]] that night.&lt;ref name=scarfe&gt;{{cite book|title=The Making of Pink Floyd The Wall|author=Gerald Scarfe|ISBN=978-0-306-81997-1|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pig was recovered and repaired for the resumption of photography for the album cover, but the sky was cloudless and blue, thus "boring". However, the pictures of the sky from the first day were suitable; eventually, the album cover was created using a composite of photos from the first and third days.&lt;ref name=superseventies&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superseventies.com/floydcvr.html|title= "The Album Covers of Pink Floyd", By Storm Thorgerson, Hipgnosis Design, London.|publisher=superseventies.com|accessdate=2009-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pig that was originally floated above Battersea Power Station was called "Algie".&lt;ref name=Rollingstone&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/20877304/a_pigs_tale_roger_waters_traces_the_history_of_rocks_most_famous_prop |first=Austin|last=Scaggs|date=May 29, 2008|title=A Pig's Tale: Roger Waters Traces the History of Rock's Most Famous Prop |publisher=rollingstone.com |accessdate=2009-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007102613/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/20877304/a_pigs_tale_roger_waters_traces_the_history_of_rocks_most_famous_prop |archivedate=October 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pinkfloyd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinkfloyd.com/news/index.php|title=Pigs On The Wing (Two Different Ones)...|publisher=pinkfloyd.com|accessdate=2011-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Flesh==
After the album ''[[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|Animals]]'' was released in [[1977 in music|1977]], Pink Floyd began their "In the Flesh" tour. During concerts, the pig appeared around the [[Public address|PA]] stacks in a cloud of black smoke during performances of "[[Pigs (Three Different Ones)]]".

==''The Wall''==
[[File:PinkFloydPig Animals.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Backdrop from a Pink Floyd tour]]
The pig also appeared during each of Pink Floyd's ''[[The Wall]]'' concerts, black instead of pink, with a crossed hammers logo on its side.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} Waters would occasionally refer to it directly before "[[Run Like Hell]]" (the pig appeared during the end of the previous song, "[[In the Flesh (Pink Floyd song)|In the Flesh]]"). A short speech in reference to either the pig or the song was given in every show, with each speech being different; this oddity is used by [[bootleg recording|bootleggers]] to identify which date a recording of the Wall tour was made on.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} At the Berlin concert, it was only the head and it had fangs and red eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMr1CKgdCjg |title=The Wall Live Berlin 22 Run Like Hell.flv |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pink Floyd's use of the pig post-Roger Waters==

For the 1987/88/89 tour, the band added testicles to the pig. [[David Gilmour]] has said this was an attempt to get around Roger Waters having the image rights for the pig.&lt;ref name="Animals Trivia and Quotes"/&gt;

Pink Floyd added a 'deflated' pig to Roger Waters's auction of animation art from the film ''[[Pink Floyd—The Wall|The Wall]]'' at [[Christie's]] London on 21 September 1990, the lot was withdrawn before the auction started.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

During the 1994 tour, two [[warthog]]-like pigs with protruding tongues were shown at the top of the stage side's speaker towers, sometimes just deflated, sometimes dropped on the ground after "[[One of These Days (instrumental)|One of These Days]]". This was also during Pulse, but for the VHS, Laserdisc and DVD releases, footage of the pigs falling was edited out.

The pig made another appearance before the release of ''[[Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd]]'', when [[Capitol Records]] flew a replica of the original pig from ''Animals'' over the [[Capitol Records Building|Capitol Records Tower]] in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]], [[California]].{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

One damaged inflatable pig, believed to be from the 1988 [[Pink Floyd]] tour, was repaired by Nga Keith and flown again over a concert by the band [[The String Cheese Incident]] in Austin, Texas on 20 September 2003.  Reportedly purchased by The String Cheese Incident manager Mike Luba from a former Pink Floyd stagehand, the 40-foot pig flew again over the [[Austin City Limits Music Festival]] audience during a cover of Pink Floyd's "[[Another Brick in the Wall]] (Part II)".

During their [[Live 8]] reunion with Waters, footage of Algie, over Battersea Power Station, was shown on a giant video screen behind the band.

A replica of Algie was tethered above Battersea Power Station on 26 September 2011 to promote the [[Why Pink Floyd...?]] campaign, involving the reissue of the band's first 14 studio albums.

==Roger Waters solo tours==
{{main|Inflatable pigs on Roger Waters' tours}}
[[File:PinkFloydPig.JPG|thumb|An inflatable pig released at the Roger Waters show on June, 2007.]]

* During a concert in Summerfest 2006, the pig had a message printed on it reading "Impeach [[George W. Bush|Bush]]"
* In a concert in [[Argentina]] on 2007, a pig flew and ended up on the [[Río de la Plata]].
* At Argentina tour dates in 2007, the pig had the "Nunca Más" (Never again) inscription on its chest, referring to the famous slogan with which the Argentine people referred to the Dictatorship when 30,000 people "disappeared" and were killed in the 1970s.
* During Waters' performance at the 2008 [[Coachella Festival]], one of the giant inflatable pigs being used as a prop became untethered and floated away into the California desert. Organizers of the festival had offered a $10,000 reward plus free lifetime tickets to the festival in return for the pig's recovery.  The pig was found three days later at a nearby country club.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mydesert.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080429/NEWS01/80429001/1006 Pig found in La Quinta country club]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Likewise, during the concert in Dallas, TX on 2 May 2008, and Houston, TX on 4 May, the pig floated away.
* During a concert in Chicago on June 8, 2012 at Wrigley Field, the pig crashed into the crowd behind home plate and was ripped to pieces by the crowd.
* During his "Us + Them" tour in 2017, the pig had a message printed on it reading "PIGGY BANK OF WAR" and underneath printed "BOMBS AND DEATH COME FROM HERE" with an arrow pointed toward to pigs rear.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/see-roger-waters-emasculate-trump-with-pigs-at-rehearsal-w483510 See Roger Waters Emasculate Donald Trump With 'Pigs' at Tour Rehearsal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bestclassicbands.com/roger-waters-concert-review-2017-5-22-17/ Roger Waters Reminds Fans Who ‘Us’ + ‘Them’ Are]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Pink Floyd's inflatable pig can be seen floating above [[Battersea Power Station]] in the 2010 movie ''[[Nanny McPhee Returns]]'' as the nanny and children make a motorcycle trip to London to locate the children's father.
*Pink Floyd's Inflatable pig can also be seen floating outside [[Battersea Power Station]] in the 2006 movie ''[[Children of Men]]''.
*Inflatable pigs can sometimes be spotted floating around neighborhoods in 2004 video game ''[[The Sims 2]]''.
*In the 1996 ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' episode ''[[The Simpsons]]'' "[[Homerpalooza]]" a cannon fires an inflatable pig, which [[Peter Frampton]] claimed to have bought at a Pink Floyd yard sale, at [[Homer Simpson]]. Publicity for the UK release of ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'' in 2007 also mimicked the original ''Animals'' cover shoot, with a giant inflatable version of the film's [[Spiderpig]] character flown above Battersea.
*During the "Isles of Wonder" short film shot by [[Danny Boyle]] and shown as part of the Opening Ceremonies of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London, the camera zooms down the length of the Thames River, from a small spring in the countryside all the way to the Olympic venue.

{{Feminism sidebar|Variants (general)}}

'''Poststructural feminism''' is a branch of [[feminism]] that engages with insights from [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist thought]]. Poststructural feminism emphasizes "the [[contingent]] and [[Discourse|discursive]] nature of {{em|all}} identities",&lt;ref&gt;Randall, Vicky (2010) 'Feminism' in ''Theory and Methods in Political Science''. Marsh, David. Stoker, Gerry. (eds.), Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; and in particular the [[Social constructivism|social construction]] of gendered subjectivities.&lt;ref&gt;P. Prasad, ''Crafting Qualitative Research'' (2005) p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; An important contribution of this branch was to establish that there is no universal single category of "woman" or "man."{{fact|date=November 2018}}

==Areas of interest==

Like post-structuralism itself, the feminist branch is in large part a tool for literary analysis, but it also deals in psychoanalysis and socio-cultural critique,&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi, ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary  and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; and seeks to explore relationships between language, sociology, subjectivity and power-relations as they impact upon gender in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Prasad, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

Poststructural feminism also seeks to criticize the [[kyriarchy]], while not being limited by narrow understandings of kyriarchal theory, particularly through an analysis of the pervasiveness of othering, the social exile of those people removed from the narrow concepts of [[Norm (sociology)|normal]].

==Leading figures==
*[[Luce Irigaray]] became famous for her poststructuralist work on ''The Sex Which is Not One'' (1977) and the [[Feminism and the Oedipus complex|deconstruction of the Oedipal Complex.]]
*[[Hélène Cixous]] argued in her best-known essay 'The Laugh of the Medusa' that writing was more important in the construction of womanhood than biology.&lt;ref&gt;E. D. Ermath, ''Sequel to History'' (1992) p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Judith Butler]] explored the constricting nature of [[social norms]] in constructing 'normal' men and women;&lt;ref&gt;Judith Butler, ''Undoing Gender'' (2004) p. 206 and p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and argued for a feminism without a feminist subject, fearing the constraining influence implicit in overt [[identity politics]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Gutting ed., ''The Cambridge Companion to Foucault'' (2003) p. 390&lt;/ref&gt;

Other significant figures in poststructuralist feminism include [[Monique Wittig]], and [[Julia Kristeva]].&lt;ref&gt;Ermath, p. 151-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary examples==

*The heroine of [[Nice Work]] admits that, when younger, she "allowed myself to be constructed by the discourse of romantic love for a while"; but adds that she soon came to realise that "we aren't unique individual essences existing prior to language. There is only language".&lt;ref&gt;David Lodge, ''Nice Work'' (1988) p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;
*The heroine of [[Possession (Byatt novel)|Possession]], a novel by [[A.S. Byatt]], more ruefully acknowledges that "we live in the truth of what Freud discovered...we question everything except the centrality of sexuality - Unfortunately feminism can hardly avoid privileging such matters".&lt;ref&gt;A. S. Byatt, ''Possession: A Romance'' (1990) p. 254 and p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Poststructural feminism has been criticised for its abandonment of the humanistic female subject, and for tactical naivety in its rejection of any form of female [[essentialism]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

'''''Potpisani''''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic]]: ''Потписани'', {{lang-en|Undersigned}}) is a [[Serbia]]n alternative [[Serial (radio and television)|TV serial]] and parody of "[[Otpisani]]" from 2007, 2008 and 2010 by [[MK Art Studio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=I |last=Masnikovic |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Prele and Gluhi in "Potpisani |url=http://i1001.photobucket.com/albums/af133/asteriksic/PotpisaniuPolitici.jpg|work=|publisher=Politika|date=2009-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=I |last=Masnikovic |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Otpisani" become "Potpisani |url=http://i1001.photobucket.com/albums/af133/asteriksic/IntervjuuTVREVIJI.jpg|work=|publisher=TV Revija|date=2009-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like in origin TV series "[[Otpisani]]", the subject of the "Potpisani" is the underground [[Yugoslav partisan|partisan]] resistance in [[Belgrade]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Potpisani |url=http://i1001.photobucket.com/albums/af133/asteriksic/PotpisaniuNovostima.jpg|work=|publisher=TV Novosti|date=2009-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=TV Program |url=http://i1001.photobucket.com/albums/af133/asteriksic/Tvprogram.jpg|work=|publisher=TV Novosti|date=2009-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, targets of this parody are also many famous [[hollywood]] movies like [[Star Wars]], [[The Matrix]], [[Superman III]], [[Home Alone]], [[Charlie Chaplin]]`s and [[Bruce Lee]]`s films and also a lot of famous [[serbia]]n movies and series like [[The Marathon Family]], [[Balkan Spy]], [[Nacionalna klasa]], [[Vratice se rode]] etc.

{{Conflict of laws}}
In [[Conflict of laws|private international law]], the '''public policy doctrine''' or '''{{lang|fr|ordre public}}''' (French: lit. "public order") concerns the body of principles that underpin the operation of legal systems in each [[Jurisdiction (area)|state]]. This addresses the social, moral and economic values that tie a [[society]] together: values that vary in different [[culture]]s and change over time. [[Law]] regulates behaviour either to reinforce existing social expectations or to encourage constructive change, and laws are most likely to be effective when they are consistent with the most generally accepted societal norms and reflect the collective [[morality]] of the [[society]].

In performing this function, Cappalli{{who?|date=November 2018}} has suggested that the critical values of any legal system include impartiality, neutrality, certainty, equality, openness, flexibility, and growth. This assumes that a state's courts function as ''[[dispute resolution]] systems'', which avoid the violence that often otherwise accompanies private resolution of disputes.  That is, [[citizen]]s have to be encouraged to use the [[Judiciary|court system]] to resolve their disputes. The more certain and predictable the outcome of a court action, the less incentive there is to go to court where a loss is probable. But certainty must be subject to the needs of individual [[justice]], hence the development of [[Equity (law)|equity]].

A [[judge]] should always consider the underlying policies to determine whether a rule should be applied to a specific factual dispute. If laws are applied too strictly and mechanically, the law cannot keep pace with social innovation. Similarly, if there is an entirely new situation, a return to the policies forming the basic assumptions underpinning potentially relevant rules of law identifies the best guidelines for resolving the immediate dispute. Over time, these policies evolve, becoming more clearly defined and more deeply embedded in the legal system.

== Fundamental principles ==
=== Ignorance of the law is not an excuse ===
The fundamental policy in the operation of a legal system is that ''[[ignorantia juris non excusat]]'' (''ignorance of the law is no excuse''). It would completely undermine the enforcement of any law if the person potentially at fault was able to raise as a successful defence that he or she had not been aware of the particular law. For this reason, all the main [[legislature]]s publish their laws freely whether in hard copy or on the [[Internet]], while others offer them for sale to the public at affordable prices. Because everyone is entitled to access the laws as they affect their personal lives, all adults are assumed responsible enough to research the law before they act. If they fail to do so, they can hardly complain if their acts prove unlawful, no matter how transiently they may be within the [[jurisdiction]]. The only exception to this rule excuses those of reduced [[capacity (law)|capacity]], whether as [[minor (law)|infants]] or through mental illness (for example, see the principle of ''[[doli incapax]]'' which raises an irrebuttable presumption in [[criminal law]] that an infant is incapable of committing a crime).

=== Sanctity of life ===
Underpinning most social, moral and religious systems is the policy of ''sanctity of life'' (also [[culture of life]]). In English criminal law, for example, [[duress]] is not allowed as a defence to [[murder]] because no threat is supposed to overcome a person's moral aversion to taking the life of another. Lord Jauncy in ''R v Gotts'' [1992]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lawteacher.net/cases/r-v-gotts.php&lt;/ref&gt; 2 AC 412 stated:

{{quote|The reason why duress has for so long been stated not to be available as a defence to a murder charge is that the law regards the sanctity of human life and the protection thereof as of paramount importance ... I can therefore see no justification in logic, morality or law in affording to an attempted murderer the defence which is withheld from a murderer.}}

In refusal of treatment and [[euthanasia]], commission and [[omission (criminal law)|omission]] by [[Physician|doctors]] and [[hospital]] authorities resulting in the death of [[patient]]s has become of increasing significance as societies debate whether the duty to preserve life outweighs the right of the autonomous patient to choose death. More contentious are those situations in which the patient is unable to make the choice personally, e.g. because in a [[persistent vegetative state]] or ''[[en ventre sa mere]]'', i.e. a child in the womb.

=== Doctrine of evasion ===
Similarly, in many branches of law, the [[Evasion (law)|doctrine of evasion]] prevents persons, both natural and artificial, from evading the application of obligations and liabilities already attaching to them. This represents a practical application of the policy that, as an outcome of the [[social contract]], all persons owing [[allegiance]] to a state should be entitled to assume that everyone will receive fair and equal treatment before the law, i.e. there will be no favouritism or preferential treatment to any person by virtue of their [[social rank|rank]] or [[social status|status]] within [[society]]. As such, this is an exception to the policy in the [[Contract|law of contract]] which usually allows the parties autonomy to enter into whatever agreement they want and which might otherwise be taken to permit the parties to exclude the normal operation of the law as between themselves (see the policy of [[freedom of contract]]).

=== Children ===
There are policies specific to all the main branches of law. Hence, one of the policies in [[family law]] is ''[[parens patriae]]'', i.e. that the state is the default [[parent]] for all those [[child]]ren within its [[jurisdiction]] and that, if it is necessary to protect the interests of the child, the state will usurp the rights of the natural parents and assert its own rights as every child's [[legal guardian]]. Within the [[European Union|EU]], the right of the child to be heard in any proceedings is a fundamental right provided in Article 24 [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]]. The views of the child shall be considered on matters which concern him or her in accordance with age and maturity. It also provides that the child's [[best interest]] shall be the primary consideration in all actions relating to children, whether taken by public authorities or private institutions.

=== Marriage ===
A policy which overlaps between family law and [[contract law]] is ''[[favor matrimonii]]'' which requires that any marriage entered into with a genuine commitment should be held valid unless there is some good reason to the contrary, matching contract law, where the preference is always to give effect to the genuine expectation of the parties.

== Discussion ==
{{Politics|expanded=Policy}}
The policies adopted by states have come into being for several reasons. Some are aspects of the concept of [[sovereignty]] and reflect the essence of territoriality. Thus, [[public law]]s which either define the [[constitution]] of the state or regulate its powers can only apply within the boundaries agreed as a part of the process of ''[[de jure]]'' recognition of statehood by the international community. Other policies are aspects of the social contract, and they define and regulate the relationship between a state and those [[citizens]] who owe it allegiance. To that extent, these policies interact with (and sometimes overlap) [[civil rights]] and [[human rights]]. A number of these rights are defined at a [[supranationalism|supranational]] level and it will necessary for states to consider the extent to which international principles of law are to be allowed to influence the operation of law within their territories. Independently of the work of the international community to produce harmonised principles, the [[court]]s in one state may sometimes be faced with [[lawsuits]] which either seek to evade the operation of foreign laws through [[forum shopping]] or seek the enforcement of "foreign" laws. This is becoming increasingly common as people now move with reasonable freedom between states and international trade routinely services markets in different states. Such lawsuits will not be troublesome if the "foreign" law is the same as the forum law. But serious difficulties will arise if the application of the "foreign" law would produce a different result. These issues are resolved under the systems of law known as "[[conflict of laws]]".

In conflict cases, no court will apply a "foreign" law if the result of its application would be contrary to public policy. This is problematic because excluding the application of foreign laws would defeat the purpose of conflict of laws by giving automatic preference to the forum court's domestic law. Thus, for the most part, courts are slower to invoke public policy in cases involving a foreign element than when a domestic legal issue is involved. That said, in those countries that have adopted [[treaty]] obligations involving [[human rights]] (e.g. the states who submit to jurisdiction of the [[European Court of Human Rights]]) broader concepts of public policy may now apply. Thus, courts may have to consider the "justice" implicit in a law that allows a husband to divorce his wife, but not ''vice versa'', as an aspect of [[sexual discrimination]]. Similarly, it would be possible to question the propriety of [[polygamy|polygamous]] marriages, the ''[[Talaq (conflict)|talaq]]'' system of [[divorce]] which is available in some Islamic states, and Jewish divorce known as the ''[[get (conflict)|get]]'', but it is likely that the courts would be cautious to avoid any implication that they were discriminating against religions. Equally difficult are the family laws which regulate [[incest]]uous relationships and [[capacity (law)|capacity]]. For example, it is probable that one state should not be too quick to condemn another because it allows a [[marriage]] between an uncle and a niece, or allows a marriage with a girl of 13 (e.g. as in Northern Nigeria), particularly if the parties are not proposing residence in the forum state.

Less controversial is the exclusion of foreign laws that are [[Penal law|penal]] or territorial because they seek to collect taxes due to another state, e.g. in [[English law]], if foreign exchange control legislation is used as "an instrument of oppression", it may be denied extraterritorial enforcement (''Re Helbert Wagg &amp; Co Ltd'' [1956] Ch 323, 351). Similarly, otherwise valid contracts may be denied enforcement if to do so would assist an enemy of the forum state or would damage the political relationship with a friendly state. When considering questions of [[status (law)|status]], English courts have held that incapacities imposed on account of [[slavery]] (''[[Somerset v Stewart|Somersett's Case]]'' [1771] 20 St Tr 1), [[religion]] (''Re Metcalfe's Trusts'' [1864] 2 De G J &amp; S 122), alien [[nationality]] (''Re Helbert Wagg &amp; Co Ltd'' [1956] Ch 323 at pp.&amp;nbsp;345/46), [[race (classification of human beings)|race]] (''[[Oppenheimer v Cattermole]]'' [1976] A C 249 at pp.&amp;nbsp;265, 276/78, 282/83), divorce (''Scott v Attorney-General'' [1886] 11 PD 128), physical incompetence (''Re Langley's Settlement Trusts'' [1962] Ch 541 at pp.&amp;nbsp;556/57) and [[spendthrift|prodigality]] (''Worms v De Valdor'' [1880] 49L J Ch. 261 and ''Re Selot's Trusts'' [1902] 1 Ch. 488) will be disregarded. Policy is also a key component to the process for the [[enforcement of foreign judgments]].

'''Retroactive continuity''', or '''retcon''' for short,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peterdavid.net/index.php/2010/09/20/political-corrections-part-2/ |title=Political Corrections, Part 2 |publisher=PeterDavid.net |date= |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peterdavid.net/2014/07/11/retcons-and-stetcons/ |title=Retcons and Stetcons |publisher=PeterDavid.net |date=2014-07-12 |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a literary device in which established facts in a fictional work are adjusted, ignored, or contradicted by a subsequently published work which breaks [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] with the former.&lt;ref name="Leith"&gt;{{cite web|author=Personal View |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3638405/One-of-these-comic-heroes-really-is-dead.html |title=One of these comic heroes really is dead |publisher=Telegraph |date=2007-03-12 |accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
There are various motivations for applying retroactive continuity, including:
* To accommodate desired aspects of [[sequel]]s or derivative works which would otherwise be ruled out;
* To correct and overcome errors or problems identified in the prior work since its publication;
* To change how the prior work should be interpreted;
* To match reality, when assumptions or projections of the future are later proven wrong.{{refn|group=Note|For instance, [[Arthur C. Clarke]] stated in his Author's Note to ''[[2061: Odyssey Three]]'': "Just as ''2010: Odyssey Two'' was not a direct sequel to ''2001: A Space Odyssey'', so this book is not a linear sequel to ''2010''. They must all be considered as variations on the same theme, involving many of the same characters and situations, but not necessarily happening in the [[parallel universe (fiction)|same universe]]. Developments since 1964 make total consistency impossible, as the later stories incorporate discoveries and events that had not even taken place when the earlier books were written."&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Arthur C. ''2061: Odyssey Three''. New York: Ballantine Books, 1988. Page ix&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Retcons are used by authors to increase their creative freedom, on the assumption that the changes are unimportant to the audience compared to the new story which can be told. For instance, by retroactively setting a prior story in a [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]], departed popular characters can be reintroduced. More subtly, a minor plot point might be retroactively expunged (for instance, the heroine leaving home without any food), removing an obstacle to further storytelling (that she should be getting hungry).

Retcons are common in [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]], and especially in [[comic book]]s published by long-established publishers such as [[DC Comics|DC]] and [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]].&lt;ref name="Booker"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Booker|first1=M. Keith|title=Encyclopedia of Comic Books and Graphic Novels [Two Volumes].|date=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara|isbn=9780313357473|page=510|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YbkJ0QJrEZ8C&amp;pg=PA510|accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The long history of popular titles and the number of writers who contribute stories can often create situations that demand clarification or revision. Retcons also often appear in [[manga]], [[soap operas]], [[serial drama]]s, movie sequels, [[cartoons]], [[professional wrestling]] [[Angle (professional wrestling)|angles]], [[video game]]s, radio series, and other forms of [[serial (radio and television)|serial fiction]].

==Etymology==
The first published use of the phrase "retroactive continuity" is found in theologian E. Frank Tupper's 1973 book ''The Theology of [[Wolfhart Pannenberg]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tupper|first1=E. Frank|title=The Theology of Wolfhart Pannenberg|date=1973|publisher=Westminster Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780664209735|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rb0AAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2016}} "Pannenberg's conception of retroactive continuity ultimately means that history flows fundamentally from the future into the past, that the future is not basically a product of the past."

The first known printed use of "retroactive continuity" referring to the altering of history in a fictional work is in ''[[All-Star Squadron]]'' #18 (February 1983) from [[DC Comics]]. The series was set on DC's [[Earth-Two]], an alternate universe in which [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] comic characters age in real time. ''[[All-Star Squadron]]'' was set during [[World War II]] on Earth-Two; as it was in the past of an alternate universe, all its events had repercussions on the contemporary continuity of the DC multiverse. Each issue changed the history of the fictional world in which it was set. In the [[comic book letter column|letters column]], a reader remarked that the comic "must make you [the creators] feel at times as if you're painting yourself into a corner", and, "Your matching of Golden Age comics history with new plotlines has been an artistic (and I hope financial!) success." Writer [[Roy Thomas]] responded, "we like to think that an enthusiastic ALL-STAR booster at one of [[Adam Malin]]'s [[Creation Convention]]s in San Diego came up with the best name for it a few months back: 'Retroactive Continuity'. Has kind of a ring to it, don't you think?"&lt;ref name="allstar"&gt;{{cite comic |title=All-Star Squadron |story=Vengeance from Valhalla |volume=1 |issue=18 |date=February 1983 |writer=[[Roy Thomas|Thomas, Roy]] |penciller=[[Joe Kubert|Kubert, Joe]] |inker=[[Rick Hoberg|Hoberg, Rick]] |publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term then took firm root in the consciousness of fans of American superhero comics.

At some point, "retroactive continuity" was shortened to "retcon", reportedly by Damian Cugley in 1988 on [[Usenet]]. Hard evidence of Cugley's abbreviation has yet to surface, though in a Usenet posting on August 18, 1990, Cugley posted a reply in which he identified himself as "the originator of the word ''retcon''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics/msg/45793eff7c060796?dmode=source |title=Google Discussiegroepen |publisher=Groups.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cugley used the [[neologism]] to describe a development in the comic book ''[[Saga of the Swamp Thing]]'', which reinterprets the events of the title character's origin by revealing facts that previously were not part of the narrative and were not intended by earlier writers.

==Types==

===Addition===
Retcons sometimes do not contradict previously established facts but instead fill in missing background details, usually to support current plot points. Thomas referred to "retroactive continuity" in this sense, as a purely additive process that did not undo any previous work; such additions were common in ''All-Star Squadron''. [[Kurt Busiek]] took a similar approach with ''[[Untold Tales of Spider-Man]]'', a series which told stories that specifically fit between issues of the original ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' series, sometimes explaining discontinuities between those earlier stories. [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] used a similar structure with ''[[X-Men: The Hidden Years]]''. Possibly the earliest [[Marvel Comics]] example of new stories placed between long-established stories was the 1977-8 magazine [[The Rampaging Hulk]]. In ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', the character Frank Pentangeli is introduced as an old friend of the family though he is not referenced in the first movie; similarly Don Altobello is one of the "old time" Dons, though he is not mentioned until ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''. Neither addition affects the plot line of the previous films. The addition, in later seasons, of an attic to the family's home in ''[[Full House]]'' stands as a similar additive example.

A similar concept is that of [[secret history]], in which the events of a story occur within the bounds of already-established events (especially real-world ones), revealing different interpretations of the events. Some of [[Tim Powers]]' novels use secret history, such as ''[[Last Call (novel)|Last Call]]'', which suggests that [[Bugsy Siegel]]'s actions were due to his being a modern-day [[Fisher King]].

[[Alan Moore]]'s additional information about the [[Swamp Thing]]'s origins – revealing that Swamp Thing was not actually scientist Alec Holland converted into a plant, but actually a plant that had absorbed Holland's body and consciousness so that it merely thought it was Holland – did not contradict or change any of the events depicted in the character's previous appearances, but instead changed the reader's interpretation of them. Such additions and reinterpretations are very common in ''[[Doctor Who]]''.&lt;ref name="Leith"/&gt;

===Alteration===
Retcons sometimes add information that seemingly contradicts previous information. This frequently takes the form of a character who was shown to have died, but is later revealed to have somehow survived. This is a common practice in [[horror film]]s, which may end with the death of a monster that goes on to appear in one or more sequels. The technique is so common in [[superhero]] comics&lt;ref name="Leith"/&gt; that the term "[[comic book death]]" has been coined for it. An early example of this type of retcon is the return of [[Sherlock Holmes]], whom writer [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] apparently killed off in "[[The Final Problem]]" in 1893,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Doyle|first1=Arthur Conan|last2=Eastman|first2=David|title=The Final Problem|date=1984|publisher=Edward Arnold|location=[[Caulfield East, Victoria]]|isbn=089375613X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2016}} only to bring him back, in large part because of readers' responses, with "[[The Empty House]]" in 1903.

In many of his detective novels, [[Rex Stout]] implies that his character [[Nero Wolfe]] was born in [[Montenegro]], giving some details of his early life in the [[Balkans]] around [[World War I]]. But in 1939's ''[[Over My Dead Body (novel)|Over My Dead Body]]'', Wolfe tells an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent that he was born in the United States. Stout revealed the reason for the change in a letter obtained by his authorized biographer, John McAleer: "In the original draft of ''Over My Dead Body'' Nero was a Montenegrin by birth, and it all fitted previous hints as to his background; but violent protests from ''[[The American Magazine]]'', supported by Farrar &amp; Rinehart, caused his cradle to be transported five thousand miles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McAleer|first1=John|title=Rex Stout: A Biography|date=1994|publisher=Brownstone Books|location=[[San Bernardino, California]]|isbn=9780941028103|pages=403, 566|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s and 1950s, [[Isaac Asimov]] placed the planet [[Trantor]], capital of the Galactic Empire, at the "center of the galaxy", but later astronomical research indicated that the actual [[Galactic Center]] might be occupied by a [[supermassive black hole]], making human life there impossible; in later works, Asimov adjusted his galaxy and Trantor's location in it.

When [[E.E. "Doc" Smith]] wrote the original ''[[The Skylark of Space]]'', space flight was a completely theoretical proposition. However, the last book of the series, ''[[Skylark DuQuesne]]'', was written in 1963, when the United States and the Soviet Union were involved in the [[space race]]. Smith adjusted the past of his series accordingly, mentioning an American base and a Soviet one being established on the [[Moon]] prior to the protagonist Seaton discovering [[faster-than-light]] flight.

[[Alan Moore]]'s retcons often involve [[False memory syndrome|false memories]]. He has used this technique in the ''[[Marvelman]]'' series and ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke]]''.

Retconning can bring back characters who were initially killed off. An example of this occurs on the CBS comedy ''[[Two and a Half Men]]''. The character Charlie Harper ([[Charlie Sheen]]) was killed in a train accident in the ninth season, but in the season twelve series finale "[[Of Course He's Dead]]", it is revealed that Charlie survived the ordeal and has been held captive against his will for over four years. It is also common in [[soap opera]]s. On ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'', [[Taylor Hayes (The Bold and the Beautiful)|Taylor Forrester]] ([[Hunter Tylo]]) was shown to [[flatline]] and have a funeral. When Tylo reprised the character in 2005, a retcon explained that Taylor had actually gone into a coma.

In the ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' cartoon ''[[Shutter Bugged Cat]]'', it retcons the cartoon ''[[Designs on Jerry]]'' as it uses footage from it as Tom builds a mouse trap to catch Jerry and he modifies the measurements on the blueprints to make it fail and with a safe contraption hits him and ends with Jerry filming Tom ripping up the blueprints he used for the trap and unlike the ending of the short, he is flattened and bandaged.

The TV series ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' annulled its entire Season 9 as being just the dream of another character, [[Pam Ewing]]. Writers did this to offer a supposedly plausible reason for the major character of [[Bobby Ewing]], who had died onscreen at the end of Season 8, to be still alive when actor [[Patrick Duffy]] wanted to return to the series. This season is sometimes referred to as the "Dream Season" and was referred to humorously in later TV series such as ''[[Family Guy]]''.

Marvel Comics' [[Beyonder]] was originally stated to be [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]] and the most powerful being in Marvel Universe, coming from the Beyond Realm. However, after his creator, [[Jim Shooter]], left Marvel, writer-editor [[Tom DeFalco]] re-tooled the Beyonder, diminishing his power greatly: he was no longer omnipotent, as certain other cosmic entities were retroactively vastly upgraded to transcend the scale of infinity on which the character worked. Even after this, Beyonder was still one of the most powerful beings in Marvel, with several characters exceeding him.

In 2003, in the title of DC Comics' [[Teen Titans]], [[Geoff Johns]] changed the entire genetic code of [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Kon-El]] (the modern version of [[Superboy#Kon-El|Superboy]]) from a genetically altered human clone that was designed to be as [[Kryptonian]] as possible into a hybrid clone of both [[Superman]] and [[Lex Luthor]]. This change contradicted years of continuity and various facts that proved that Kon-El was human and in the process mostly ignored his unique ability of tactile telekinesis that made his powers very different from those of Superman.

In ''[[Boy Meets World]]'', both Shawn and Topanga have siblings in the first season but later in the series are retconned to be only children. The ages of the characters of ''Boy Meets World'' are altered notably where Cory is age 11 in 6th grade during season 1 to age 13 and 8th grade in season 2. This happens again in high school skipping another grade. The age gap between Cory and Eric also narrows from 4 years apart in age to 2 years apart in age.

===Subtraction===
Unpopular or embarrassing stories are sometimes later ignored by publishers, and effectively erased from a series's continuity. Later stories may contradict the previous ones or explicitly establish that they never happened. An example of this can be found with the film ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]'', which expressly contradicts the events of the earlier ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'', due to that film’s depiction of the Deadpool character being extremely unpopular with audiences. An unpopular retcon may itself be retconned away, as happened with [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s ''[[Spider-Man: Chapter One]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

===Temporal compression===
Film sequels often employ temporal compression to maintain a sense of currency in each installment, despite more time having elapsed [[diegesis|diegetically]] ("in-universe") between one installment and another than has elapsed in the real world. For example, despite the implied contemporaneity in each of the films of ''[[The Omen]]'' series, the lead character ages some 15 or 20 years across three films released over a period of less than 6 years.

==Related concepts==
Retroactive continuity is similar to, but not the same as, plot inconsistencies introduced accidentally or through lack of concern for continuity; retconning, by comparison, is done deliberately. For example, the ongoing continuity contradictions on episodic TV series such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (in which the timeline of the family's history must be [[Floating timeline|continually shifted forward]] to explain they are not getting any older)&lt;ref name="Cross"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cross|first1=Mary|title=100 People who Changed 20th-century America, Volume 1|date=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=[[Santa Barbara, California]]|isbn=9781610690850|page=591|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AVBS79mK7bUC&amp;pg=PA591|accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; reflects intentionally lost continuity, not genuine retcons. However, in series with generally tight continuity, retcons are sometimes created after the fact to explain continuity errors, such was the case in ''[[The Flintstones]]'', where [[Wilma Flintstone]] was mistakenly given two separate maiden names, "Pebble" and "Slaghoople", over the course of the series.  Upon discovering the discrepancy, the producers settled on "Slaghoople" and retconned it into later series in the franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wilma Flintstone: A fox in leopard clothing?|url=http://www.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/story.html?id=400b0b01-ec31-42e1-8421-1cb78f133c7c&amp;k=44564|publisher=Canada.com|accessdate=23 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622033230/http://www.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/story.html?id=400b0b01-ec31-42e1-8421-1cb78f133c7c&amp;k=44564|archivedate=22 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retconning is also generally distinct from replacing the actor who plays a part in an ongoing series, which is more commonly an example of ''loose continuity'' rather than retroactively changing past continuity. The different appearance of the character is either ignored (as was done with the characters of Darrin Stephens and Gladys Kravitz on the television series ''[[Bewitched]]'', or Vivian on ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]''), or explained within the series, such as with "[[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regeneration]]" in ''[[Doctor Who]]'', or the Oracle in ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]''. Sometimes, there are referential, inside jokes on actor changes in the show, such as with ''[[My Wife &amp; Kids]]'' and ''[[Roseanne]]'', where there was a change of actresses playing a role (characters Claire Kyle and Becky Conner, respectively). In the latter, another character observes that children can change as they reach adulthood, remarking that when Becky came back from college (played by a new actress), they couldn't even recognize her.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} When the actor playing Rory was replaced in ''[[Mrs Brown's Boys]]'', the new actor first appeared on set bandaged up, supposedly following cosmetic surgery on his face. When the bandages were removed, the other characters claimed not to notice any difference.

Retconning also differs from direct revision. For example, when [[George Lucas]] re-edited the original ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy, he made changes directly to the source material, rather than introducing new source material that contradicted the contents of previous material.

Retconning is not the same as a reboot or reimagining which completely discards the original timeline, such as in ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]''. However, there have been partial reboots of franchises where the core of the franchise is still canonical but the expanded universe is relegated to a secondary continuity which, while not completely invalid, is subject to revision and critical review. ''[[Robotech]]'' is an example of this. With the release of the 2006 sequel film ''[[Robotech The Shadow Chronicles]]'', Harmony Gold established that only the original 1985 animated series and the 2006 sequel film are considered canonical relegating the aborted ''[[Robotech II: The Sentinels]]'', comics, and novels from the 80s and 90s to secondary continuity and, if elements are used from them, they are subject to selective revision and updating as appropriate to mesh with future canonical productions and to prevent conflict with the original animated series. While the [[Jack McKinney (writer)|Jack McKinney]] ''Robotech'' novel ''End of the Circle'' is evidently no longer canon, the prequel comic ''[[Robotech: Prelude to the Shadow Chronicles]]'' establishes that the general storyline of The Sentinels still occurred in some fashion, but various elements, including the timeline, specific unfolding of events, and some characterizations are different from what was previously depicted in earlier comics and novels. In such cases, the franchise producer may state that there is no intention to address the changes through remakes or direct retellings of such stories. It is essentially left to the viewer's imagination as to how differently the revised story unfolded.

{{Sound change}}
'''Rhotacism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|oʊ|t|ə|ˌ|s|ɪ|z|əm}})&lt;ref name="collins_american"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/american/rhotacism |title=American English Dictionary: Definition of rhotacism |publisher=Collins |accessdate=December 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''rhotacization''' is a [[sound change]] that converts one consonant (usually a voiced [[alveolar consonant]]: {{IPA|/z/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/l/}}, or {{IPA|/n/}}) to a [[rhotic consonant]] in a certain environment. The most common may be of {{IPA|/z/}} to {{IPA|/r/}}.&lt;ref name="Catford2001"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Catford|2001|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term comes from the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] ''[[rho (letter)|rho]]'', denoting "r".

==Albanian==
The southern, [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]] dialects, the base of [[Albanian language|Standard Albanian]], changed {{IPA|/n/}} to {{IPA|/r/}}, but the northern, [[Gheg Albanian|Gheg]] dialects did not:&lt;ref name="Catford2001" /&gt;
* ''zëri'' vs. ''zâni'' 'the voice'
* ''gjuri'' vs. ''gjuni'' 'the knee'
* ''Shqipëria'' vs. ''Shqypnia'' 'Albania'
* ''i gëzuar'' vs. ''i gëzuem'' 'cheerful'
* ''i tretur'' vs. ''i tretun'' 'lost'
* ''i qeshur'' vs. ''i qeshun'' 'smiling'
* ''këputur'' vs. ''këputun''  'broken'
* ''i prekur'' vs. ''i prekun'' 'touched'
* ''i habitur'' vs. ''i habitun'' 'amazed'
* ''Arbëria'' vs. ''Arbënia''  'Albania'  (older name of the country)
* ''i djegur'' vs. ''i djegun'' 'burnt'
* ''i dehur'' vs. ''i dehun''  'drunk'
* ''i pjekur'' vs. ''i pjekun''  'baked'
* ''druri''  vs.  ''druni''  'wood'
* ''bëra''  vs. ''bona''  'did'
* ''vura'' vs. ''vuna''  'put'
* ''zura'' vs. ''zuna''  'caught'
* ''pluhur'' vs. ''pluhun''  'dust'
* ''i lumtur'' vs. '' i lumtun''  'happy'
* ''dashuri'' vs. ''dashni''  'love'

==Aramaic==
In [[Aramaic]], [[Proto-Semitic]] ''n'' changed to ''r'' in a few words:

* ''bar'' "son" as compared to Hebrew ''ben'' (from Proto-Semitic *''bnu'')
* ''trên'' and ''tartên'' "two" (masculine and feminine form respectively) as compared to Demotic Arabic ''tnēn'' and ''tintēn'', from Proto-Semitic *''ṯnaimi'' and *''ṯnataimi''. Compare also Aramic ''tinyânâ'' "the second one", without the shift.

==Basque==
[[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]] *''l'' changed to the [[flap consonant|tapped ''r'']] between vowels in [[Basque language|Basque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/linguistics/documents/lxwp23-08_edb.pdf |title=A Historical Dictionary of Basque |last=Trask |first=R. Larry |authorlink=Larry Trask |editor-last=Wheeler |editor-first=Max W. |year=2008 |publisher=University of Essex |page=29 |accessdate=January 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be observed in words borrowed from Latin; for example, Latin ''caelum'' (meaning "sky, heaven") became ''zeru'' in Basque (''caelum'' &gt; ''celu'' &gt; ''zeru''; compare ''cielo'' in Spanish). The original ''l'' is preserved in the [[Souletin dialect]]: ''caelum'' &gt; ''celu'' &gt; ''zelü''.

==Finnish==
Western dialects of [[Finnish language|Finnish]] are characterised by the pronunciation {{IPA|/r/}} or {{IPA|/ɾ/}} of the consonant written ''d'' in [[Standard Finnish]] ''kahden kesken- kahren kesken'' (two together = one on one).{{examples needed|date=July 2016}} The reconstructed older pronunciation is {{IPA|*ð}}.

==Goidelic languages==
In [[Manx language|Manx]], [[Scottish Gaelic]] and some dialects of [[Irish language|Irish]], a {{IPA|/kn/}} cluster developed into {{IPA|/kr/}}, often with nasalization of the following vowel, as in Scottish Gaelic {{lang|gd|cnoc}} {{IPA|[krɔ̃xk]}} ('hill').&lt;ref name="Catford2001" /&gt;

==Germanic languages==
All surviving [[Germanic languages]], which are members of the [[North Germanic languages|North]] and [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic families]], changed {{IPA|/z/}} to {{IPA|/r/}}, implying a more approximant-like rhotic consonant in [[Proto-Germanic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Catford|2001|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some languages later changed all forms to ''r'', but [[Gothic language|Gothic]], an extinct [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic language]], did not undergo rhotacism.

Note that the Modern German forms have levelled the rhotic consonant to forms that did not originally have it.

===English===
Intervocalic {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} are commonly lenited to {{IPA|[ɾ]}} in most of [[North American English|North American]] and [[Australian English]], as well as in some accents of [[Irish English]] and [[English English]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=John|title=English Sound Structure|date=1994|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=0-631-18741-3|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; a process known as tapping or less accurately as [[flapping]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ladefoged|first1=Peter|title=A Course in Phonetics|date=2006|publisher=Thomson|isbn=978-1-4130-0688-9|pages=171–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''got a lot of'' {{IPA|/gɒtə lɒtə/}} becomes {{IPA|[gɒɾə lɒɾə]}}. Contrast is usually maintained with {{IPA|/r/}}, and the [ɾ] sound is rarely perceived as /r/.&lt;ref name="Catford2001" /&gt;

===German===
In [[Central German]] dialects, especially [[Rhine Franconian dialects|Rhine Franconian]] and [[Hessian dialects|Hessian]], {{IPA|/d/}} is frequently realised as {{IPA|[ɾ]}} in intervocalic position. The change also occurs in [[Mecklenburgisch-Vorpommersch dialect|Mecklenburg dialects]]. Compare ''Borrem'' (Central Hessian) and ''Boden'' (Standard German).

==Romance languages==
===Latin===
*'''''flōs'''''{{sup|[[nominative case|nom]]}} — '''''flōr'''em''{{sup|[[accusative case|acc]]}} ([[Old Latin]] '''''flōs'''em'')
*'''''genus'''''{{sup|[[nominative case|nom]]}} — '''''gener'''is''{{sup|[[genitive case|gen]]}} (from *'''''genes'''es'', cf. Sanskrit ''janasas'')
*'''''rōbus''''',&lt;ref&gt;{{L&amp;S|robus1|robus&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;|rōbus}}; {{L&amp;S|robur|rōbur|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''''rōbus'''tus'' — '''''rōbur''''', ''cor'''rōbor'''āre'' (verb from *''con'''robos'''are'')
*'''''jūs'''tus'' — ''de '''jūr'''e'' (from ''de '''jous'''e'')
*'''''es'''t'' — '''''er'''ō'' (from '''''es'''ō'')

It reflects a highly regular change in pre-[[Classical Latin]]. Intervocalic ''s'' in [[Old Latin]], which is assumed to have been pronounced {{IPA|/z/}}), invariably became ''r''. Intervocalic ''s'' in Classical Latin suggests either borrowing (''rōsa''), or reduction of an earlier ''ss'' after a long vowel or a diphthong (''pausa'' &lt; ''paussa'', ''vīsum'' &lt; ''*vīssum'' &lt; ''*weid-tom''). The ''s'' was preserved initially (''septum'') and finally and in consonant clusters.

The English word ''honour'' or ''honor''  is derived from [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] ''honour'', which, in turn, was derived from [[Late Latin]] ''honor'', earlier ''honos'', which became ''honor'' by analogy with the oblique stem of  ''honor-'': ''honoris'' genitive).

The ''d'' and the ''l'' changed to ''r'' before another ''d'' or ''l'' so that the same consonant would not appear twice in a row ([[dissimilation]]):
*'''''medi'''us'' — '''''merī'''diēs'' (from *'''''medi'''-diēs'')
*'''''caelu'''m'' — '''''caer'''uleus'' (from *'''''cael'''-uleus'')

The phenomenon was noted by the Romans themselves:
{{quote|In many words in which the ancients said ''s'', they later said ''r''... foedesum foederum, plusima plurima, meliosem meliorem, asenam arenam|[[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], ''De lingua Latina'', VII, 26|In multis verbis, in quo antiqui dicebant ''s'', postea dicunt ''r''... foedesum foederum, plusima plurima, meliosem meliorem, asenam arenam|lingua=la}}

===Neapolitan===
In [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]], rhotacism affects words etymologically containing intervocalic or initial {{IPA|/d/}}.

*&lt;small&gt;LAT. {{lang|la|DENTE(M)}}&lt;/small&gt; &gt; Neap. {{lang|nap|dente}} {{IPA-nap|ˈrɛndə|}} "tooth"
*&lt;small&gt;LAT. {{lang|la|PEDE(M)}}&lt;/small&gt; &gt; Neap. {{lang|nap|pere}} {{IPA-nap|ˈpɛːrə|}} "foot"

===Portuguese===
In [[Galician-Portuguese]], rhotacism occurred from {{IPA|/l/}} to {{IPA|/r/}}, mainly in consonant clusters ending in {{IPA|/l/}}, as in the words ''obrigado'', "thank you" (originarily from "obliged [in honorably serving my Sir]"); ''praia'', "beach"; ''prato'', "plate" or "dish"; ''branco'', "white"; ''prazer'', "pleasure"; ''praça'', "square". Compare Spanish ''obligado'' (obliged), ''playa, plato, blanco, placer, plaza'' from Latin ''obligatus, plagia, platus, blancus'' (Germanic origin), ''placere'' (verb), ''platea''.

In contemporary [[Brazilian Portuguese]], rhotacism of {{IPA|/l/}} in the [[Syllable#Coda|syllable coda]] is characteristic of the [[Caipira dialect]]; further rhotacism in the nationwide vernacular includes ''planta'', "plant", as {{IPA|[ˈpɾɐ̃tɐ]}}, ''lava'', "[[lava]]", as {{IPA|/ˈlarvɐ/}} (then homophonous with ''larva'', worm/maggot), ''lagarto'', "lizard", as {{IPA|[laʁˈɡaʁtu]}} (in dialects with guttural coda ''r'' instead of a [[alveolar flap|tap]]) and ''advogado'', "lawyer", as {{IPA|[ɐ̞de̞vo̞ʁˈɡadu]}}. The nonstandard patterns are largely marginalised, as rhotacism is regarded as a sign of speech-language pathology or illiteracy.

===Romanesco===
Rhotacism, in [[Romanesco dialect|Romanesco]], shifts ''l'' to ''r'' before a consonant, like certain Andalusian dialects of Spanish. Thus, Latin ''altus'' (tall) is ''alto'' in [[Italian language|Italian]] but becomes ''arto'' in Romanesco. Rhotacism used to happen when ''l'' was preceded by a consonant, as in the word ''ingrese'' (English), but modern speech has lost that characteristic.

Another change related to ''r'' was the shortening of the [[gemination|geminated]] ''rr'', which is not rhotacism. Italian words ''errore'', ''guerra'' and ''marrone'' "error", "war", "brown" become ''erore'', ''guera'' and ''marone''.

===Romanian===
[[Romanian language|Romanian]] rhotacism shifts intervocalic ''l'' to ''r'' and ''n'' to ''r''.

Thus, Latin ''caelum'' (meaning 'heaven' or 'sky') became Romanian ''cer'', Latin ''fenestra'' (meaning 'window') becomes Romanian ''fereastră'' and Latin ''felicitas'' (meaning 'happiness') Romanian ''fericire''.

Some northern Romanian dialects and [[Istro-Romanian language|Istro-Romanian]] also changed all intervocalic {{IPA|[n]}} to {{IPA|[ɾ]}} in words of Latin origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Nandris|1963|pp=255–258}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Latin ''bonus'' became Istro-Romanian ''bur'', as compared to standard Daco-Romanian ''bun''.

===Other languages===
Rhotacism (''mola'' &gt; ''mora'', ''filum'' &gt; ''fir'', ''sal'' &gt; ''sare'') exists in Gallo-Italic as well, in [[Western Lombard dialect|Western Lombard]], Alpine Lombard and [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]].

===Sicilian===
Rhotacism is particularly widespread in the island of [[Sicily]], but almost completely absent in the Sicilian varieties of the mainland ([[Languages of Calabria|Calabrese]] and [[Salentino dialect|Salentino]]). It affects intervocalic and initial /d/: ''cura'' from latin 
''caudam'', ''peri'' from latin ''pedem'', ''reci'' from latin ''decem''.

===Spanish===
In [[Andalusian Spanish]], particularly in [[Seville]], at the end of a syllable before another consonant, ''l'' is replaced with ''r'': ''Huerva'' for ''[[Huelva]]''. The reverse occurs in Caribbean varieties: ''Puelto Rico'' instead of ''[[Puerto Rico]]''.

==Sanskrit==
In [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]], words ending in ''-s'' other than ''-as'' become ''-r'' in [[sandhi]] with a voiced consonant:

*''naus'' (before ''p'', ''t'', ''k'') vs ''naur bharati''
*''agnis'' (before ''p'', ''t'', ''k'') vs ''agnir mata''

It is not properly rhotacism as ''r'' and ''s'' are then simply [[allophones]].

==South Slavic languages==
(This section relies on the treatment in Greenberg 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Greenberg|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

In some [[South Slavic languages]], rhotacism occasionally changes a voiced palatal fricative {{IPA|[ʒ]}} to a dental or alveolar tap or trill {{IPA|[r]}} if it is between vowels:

*''moreš'' ([[Slovene language|Slovene]], dialectal [[Serbo-Croatian]]) 'you can' from earlier ''možešь''
*''kdor'' (Slovene) from earlier ''kъto-že''

The beginning of the change is attested in the [[Freising manuscripts]],  the 10th century AD, which shows both the archaism (''ise'' 'which' &lt; *''jь-že'') and the innovation (''tere'' 'also' &lt; *''te-že''). It is also found in individual lexical items in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian dialects]], ''дорде'' 'until' (&lt; *''do-že-dĕ'') and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], ''сеѓере'' (archaic: 'always'). However, the results of the sound change have largely been reversed by lexical replacement in dialects in Serbia and Bosnia from the 14th century.

Dialects in Croatia and Slovenia have preserved more of the lexical items with the change and even extended grammatical markers in ''-r'' from many sources that formally merged with the rhotic forms that arose from the sound change: Slovene dialect ''nocor'' 'tonight' (&lt; *''not'ь-sь-ǫ-'' + ''-r-'') on the model of ''večer'' 'evening' (&lt; *''večerъ''). The reversal of the change is evident in dialects in Serbia where the ''-r-'' formant is systematically removed: Serbian ''veče'' 'evening'.

[[File:Tiziano,_san_girolamo_penitente.jpg|thumb|300px]]
'''''Saint Jerome in Penitence''''' or '''''Penitent Saint Jerome''''' is a c.1531 oil on canvas painting [[Titian]], now in the [[Louvre]] in Paris. It is first mentioned in the collections of [[Louis XIV]] and may have come from the [[Gonzaga collection]], perhaps making it the ''Saint Jerome'' mentioned in [[Federico II Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua|Federico Gonzaga]]'s correspondence, which can be dated to 1531. A second theory argues that the work was intended for Federico's mother [[Isabella d'Este]], who wanted a nocturnal scene.

Within the linguistic study of [[endangered languages]], sociolinguists distinguish between different '''speaker types''' based on the type of [[Competence (linguistics)|competence]] they have acquired of the endangered language. Often in situations where a community is gradually shifting away from an endangered language to a majority language, not all speakers acquire full linguistic competence, but have varying degrees and types of competence depending on the kind of exposure to the minority language they experienced in their upbringing. Originally the relevance of speaker types in situations of language shift was noted by [[Nancy Dorian]] who coined the term [[semi-speaker]] to refer to those speakers of Sutherland Gaelic who were predominantly English-speaking and whose Gaelic competence was limited and showed considerable influence from English.&lt;ref&gt;Dorian, N. C. (1977). The problem of the semi-speaker in language death. Linguistics, 15(191), 23-32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorian, N. C. (1980). Language shift in community and individual: The phenomenon of the laggard semi-speaker. International Journal of the Sociology of Language, 1980(25), 85-94.&lt;/ref&gt; Later studies added additional speaker types such as [[Speaker types#Typology|rememberers]] (who remember some words and phrases but have little or no grammatical competence and do not actively speak the language), [[Passive speaker (language)|passive speakers]] (who have nearly full comprehension competence but do not actively speak the language). In the context of language revitalization, [[new speakers]] who have learned the endangered language as a second language are sometimes distinguished.&lt;ref&gt;Hornsby, Michael. "The “new” and “traditional” speaker dichotomy: bridging the gap." International Journal of the Sociology of Language 2015, no. 231 (2015): 107-125.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grinevald, Colette. "Speakers and documentation of endangered languages." Language documentation and description 1 (2003): 52-72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grinevald, Collette &amp; Michel Bert. 2011. "Speakers and Communities" in Austin, Peter K; Sallabank, Julia, eds. (2011). Cambridge Handbook of Endangered Languages. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-88215-6}}. p.50&lt;/ref&gt;

In contexts of language acquisition and language teaching studies sometimes there is a distinction between [[native speakers]] and [[Second language|second language speakers]], depending on whether language was learned as a language of primary socialisation or learned after already having fully acquired a first language. In contexts of [[multilingualism]] a bilingual speaker may also be described as a [[heritage speaker]] (A heritage language actually refers to a language whose speakers have moved from the original area where the language was spoken: e.g. Welsh is a heritage language in Patagonia, but not in Wales) if they have not been as fully exposed to one of their languages, leading to a diminished degree of confidence in themselves as speakers, and sometimes also limited competence in one of their languages.

==Typology==
A '''rememberer''' is a person who knows individual words or phrases (sometimes entire texts) but cannot use the target language productively. Such persons are of particular interest when studying any [[Endangered language|endangered]] or [[Language death|dying language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Cambridge Handbook of Endangered Languages|last = Grinevald|first = Colette|authorlink=Colette Grinevald|publisher = Cambridge|year = 2011|isbn = |location = |pages = 51|url = http://www.ddl.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/colloques/3l_2012/pageweb/pdf/Grinevald%20&amp;%20Bert2011-Speakers&amp;Community.pdf|last2 = Bert|first2 = Michel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rememberers are contrasted with [[fluency|fluent]] or full speakers, who have a good command of the language, and [[semi-speaker]]s, who have a partial command of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Research Methods in Linguistics|last = Podesva|first = Robert J.|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1107696358|location = |pages = 52|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gU5kAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=rememberer+linguistics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LQ3k8zd5F9&amp;sig=fqDd-Vf1laDbkOva58-pc6A6oo8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PgCyVNWNEsGwogTf_IHwAw&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=rememberer%20linguistics&amp;f=false|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between fluent speakers and rememberers is important in fieldwork, but accurately determining where a member of a language community falls on the speaker-rememberer continuum can be challenging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Handbook of Descriptive Linguistic Fieldwork|last = Chelliah|first = Shobhana L.|authorlink=Shobhana Chelliah|publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year = 2010|isbn = 978-9048190256|location = |pages = 176–177|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=d1FfE30hZ7EC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=rememberer+linguistics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kBdn4yvVFI&amp;sig=cxxXaXUZDLl_0jvg16rehWK72F0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TgKyVLXlEtLloASOuoHYCg&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=rememberer%20linguistics&amp;f=false|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Passive speaker (language)|passive speaker]] (also referred to as a ''receptive bilingual'' or ''passive bilingual'') is someone who has had enough exposure to a language in childhood to have a [[native speaker|native-like]] comprehension of it, but has little or no active command of it. Such speakers are especially common in [[language shift]] communities where speakers of a declining language do not acquire active competence. Around 10% of the [[Ainu people]], for example, who speak the language are considered passive speakers. Passive speakers are often targeted in [[language revival]] efforts to increase the number of speakers of a language quickly, as they are likely to gain active and near-native speaking skills more quickly than those with no knowledge of the language. They are also found in areas where people grow up hearing another language outside their family with no formal education.

A '''semi-speaker''' is a speaker who has acquired a partial [[linguistic competence]] in a given language, but who does not generally use it regularly in conversation. Their speech can contain erroneous forms. Semi-speakers are often among the most motivated and engaged participants in language revitalization projects.&lt;ref&gt;Grinevald, Collette &amp; Michel Bert. 2011. "Speakers and Communities" in Austin, Peter K; Sallabank, Julia, eds. (2011). Cambridge Handbook of Endangered Languages. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-88215-6}}. p.50&lt;/ref&gt;  As languages become obsolete and [[speech community|speech communities]] shift to other languages, they are spoken less frequently and in fewer social domains. Many speakers learn the language partially, often in a simplified way, with significant influence from the majority language. They are sometimes referred to as "semi-speakers", "quasi-speakers" or "rememberers". The word semi-speaker was introduced by linguist [[Nancy Dorian]] in describing the last speakers of the East Sutherland dialect of [[Scottish Gaelic]].&lt;ref&gt;Dorian, Nancy C. 1980. Language Shift in Community and Individual: The Phenomenon of the Laggard Semi-Speaker. International Journal of the Sociology of Language. Vol. 1980, Iss. 25, Pages 85–94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. Dorian, "The Problem of the Semi-Speaker in Language Death," International Journal of the Sociology of Language 12 (1977): 23-32.&lt;/ref&gt;  When semi-speakers form a significant part of the speech, community [[language death|language contraction]] often ensues, as the linguistic norms are accommodated to the competences of the speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Knowles-Berry |first=Susan |date=Winter 1987 |title=Linguistic decay in Chontal Mayan: the speech of semi-speakers |journal=Anthropological Linguistics |volume=29 |number=4 |pages=332–341 |jstor=30028108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dorian |first=Nancy C. |date=September 1978 |title=Fate of morphological complexity in language death: Evidence from East Sutherland Gaelic |journal=Language |volume=54 |number=3 |pages=590–609 |jstor=412788 |doi=10.1353/lan.1978.0024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''terminal speaker''' is the last speaker of a language. A terminal speaker may still be alive, or may have been the last person speaking what is now an [[extinct language]].&lt;ref&gt;Polinsky, Maria. 1995. Cross-linguistic parallels in language loss. ''Southwest Journal of Linguistics'' 14.1-2 pp. 87-123.&lt;/ref&gt; In the process of [[language death]], the remaining speakers begin to lose some of the vocabulary and grammar of the language, so when there is only a last terminal speaker, the person will not remember a complete form of the language as it had been spoken by a larger community using it in all language domains. Being a terminal speaker means that the person is bilingual, remembering their [[heritage language]] but interacting with their community in another language. The importance of this distinction is seen in the story of [[Dolly Pentreath]] of [[Cornwall]]. She is popularly named as the last fluent, first-language speaker of [[Cornish language|Cornish]], but there were others who still spoke it for many years, though possibly incompletely. Terminal speakers are sometimes found by linguists doing [[language documentation]] on a language before it dies. A clear example of a terminal speaker being contacted by a linguist is the case of Abegaz, the last speaker of the [[Mesmes language]] in Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;Ahland, Michael Bryan. (2010). ''Language death in Mesmes''. Dallas: SIL International and the University of Texas at Arlington.&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in an isolated hilly area and was about 80 years old when he was contacted by a team of sociolinguistic [[language survey]]ors; he has died since that contact.  [[Ned Maddrell]] was the last speaker of the [[Manx language]], having died in 1974. In 2008, Doris McLemore was reported to be the last speaker of the [[Wichita language]] as she worked with a team of linguists to document the language before it died completely.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18532656 Web access]&lt;/ref&gt; Many more terminal speakers are listed under the Wikipedia category [[List of last known speakers of languages|Last known speakers of a language]].

'''''Taking the piss''''' is a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] term meaning to take liberties at the expense of others, or to be joking, or to be unreasonable. It is a shortening of the idiom '''taking the piss out of,''' which is an [[idiom|expression]] meaning to [[Parody|mock]], tease, joke, ridicule, or scoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Chris Roberts (author)|first=Chris |last=Roberts|title=Heavy Words Lightly Thrown: The Reason Behind Rhyme|publisher=Thorndike Press|year=2006|isbn=0-7862-8517-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not to be confused with "taking a piss", which refers to the act of urinating. '''Taking the Mickey''' (Mickey Bliss, [[Cockney]] [[rhyming slang]]), '''taking the Mick''' or '''taking the Michael''' is another term for making fun of someone. These terms are most widely used in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], [[South Africa]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]].

==Usage==
The term sometimes refers to a form of mockery in which the mocker exaggerates the other person's characteristics; pretending to take on his or her attitudes, etc., for the purpose of comedic effect at the expense of another.  This would be described as "taking the piss" out of that person, or "a piss-take". It may be also be used to refer to a ruse whereby a person is led to believe a plainly unbelievable fact for the purpose of ridicule of the subject, e.g. "Are you being serious?" "No, I'm just taking the piss."

The phrase is in common usage throughout British society, employed by headline writers in broadsheet gazettes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,2212788,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Taking the Mickey out of Saatchi | first=Vanessa | last=Thorpe | date=18 November 2007 | accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tabloids&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=380769&amp;in_page_id=1773 | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Are Jordan and Peter taking the Mickey? | date=23 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as colloquially. It is also used in English speaking countries such as Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/20/1050777165949.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Taking the Mickey | date=21 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/cricket/to-mitigate-gibbs-outburst-is-simply-taking-the-mickey/2007/01/16/1168709752692.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=To mitigate Gibbs outburst is simply taking the Mickey | date=17 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In colloquial usage, "taking the piss" is also used to refer to someone or something that makes a claim which is not in line with a recognised agreement e.g. an invoice that is double the quoted price with no explanation for the added charge could be said to "take the piss", or likewise if something consistently misses a deadline.

The term can also mean to take unfair advantage.  For example, if someone has a food [[buffet]] and one guest clearly takes more than their expected share.  It can also relate to an abuse of trust, such as "''You can use my 'phone, but don't take the piss!''", i.e. do not abuse my offer of assistance by making lengthy calls that will cost me a lot of money.  Equally, a wilfully unproductive employee could be described as "taking the piss" for accepting a wage while knowingly failing to deliver on their obligation, or an employer could be accused of "taking the piss" for making unreasonable requests of their employees, e.g. expecting them to do unpaid overtime.

==Origin==
"Take the piss" may be a reference to a related (and dated) idiomatic expression, ''piss-proud'', which is a vulgar pun referring to the [[Nocturnal penile tumescence|morning erections]] which happen when a man awakens at the end of a dream cycle (each about 90 minutes in length throughout the night) or may be caused by a full bladder pressing upon nerves that help affect erection.  This could be considered a 'false' erection, as its origin is physiological not sexual, so in a metaphoric sense, then, someone who is "piss-proud" would suffer from false pride, and ''taking the piss out of them'' refers to deflating this false pride, through disparagement or mockery.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A753527 |title=The Origins and Common Usage of British Swear Words |publisher=BBC |accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-tak2.htm |title=Take the piss |accessdate=7 January 2011 |last=Quinion |first=Michael |work=World Wide Words}}&lt;/ref&gt; As knowledge of the expression's metaphoric origin became lost on users, "taking the piss out of" came to be synonymous with disparagement or mockery itself, with less regard to the pride of the subject.

"Take the mickey" may be an abbreviated form of the [[Cockney rhyming slang]] "take the Mickey Bliss",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/344000.html |title=Take the Mickey |accessdate=30 January 2008 |last=Martin |first=Gary |work=The Phrase Finder }}&lt;/ref&gt; a euphemism for "take the piss." It has also been suggested that "mickey" is a contraction of "[[urination|micturition]],"&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; in which case "take the micturition" would be a synonymous euphemism for "take the piss." The phrase has been noted since the 1930s.

===Alternative theory of origin===
One theory is that during the [[History of the British canal system|age of the canals]] in Britain, urine would be brought up the canals to the wool mills in Northern England (particularly to Yorkshire), as urine was used in the process of fixing dye to wool. This was particularly the case when dyeing items blue with [[Indigo dye|indigo]] or more traditionally with [[Isatis tinctoria|woad]], before [[synthetic dyes]] were invented or made commercially available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.dgwbirch.com/?p=3 |title=Taking the piss |publisher=Blog.dgwbirch.com |date=19 December 2009 |accessdate=16 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425130027/http://blog.dgwbirch.com/?p=3 |archivedate=25 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Being in the business of transporting urine was much less lucrative than transporting wine, so when the boatmen were questioned what they were carrying they would lie and say "I'm taking wine" and the response would be "No, you're taking the piss" to express disbelief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.uk.com/history/a-dyeing-art-jess-dyde/ |title=Dying Art |publisher=History.uk.com |date=1 February 2009 |accessdate=16 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415051715/http://www.history.uk.com/history/a-dyeing-art-jess-dyde/ |archivedate=15 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tango''' is a style of music in [[Time signature|{{music|time|2|4}} or {{music|time|4|4}}]] time that originated among European immigrant populations of [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]] (collectively, the "[[Rioplatense Spanish|Rioplatenses]]").&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hy8EQ1hEp3BVG-vnlwrClzXfpA7A |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227234508/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hy8EQ1hEp3BVG-vnlwrClzXfpA7A|archivedate=27 February 2014|deadurl=yes|title=Argentina, Uruguay bury hatchet to snatch tango honor |last=Termine |first=Laura |date=September 30, 2009 |accessdate=April 2, 2010 |location=Buenos Aires }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is traditionally played on a solo guitar, guitar duo, or an ensemble, known as the ''[[orquesta típica]]'', which includes at least two [[violin]]s, [[flute]], [[piano]], [[double bass]], and at least two [[bandoneón]]s. Sometimes guitars and a clarinet join the ensemble. Tango may be purely instrumental or may include a vocalist. Tango music and [[tango (dance)|dance]] have become popular throughout the world.

== Origins ==
[[Image:Early-bandonion.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Early bandoneón, constructed ca. 1905]]

Even though present forms developed in Argentina and Uruguay from the mid 19th century, there are records of 19th and early 20th century Tango styles in [[Cuba]] and Spain,&lt;ref name=OrtizOrigen&gt;José Luis Ortiz Nuevo ''El origen del tango americano''  Madrid and La Habana 1849&lt;/ref&gt; while there is a flamenco [[Tango (flamenco)|Tangos]] dance that may share a common ancestor in a minuet-style European dance.&lt;ref name=DennistonCouple&gt;[http://www.history-of-tango.com/couple-dancing.html Christine Denniston. ''Couple Dancing and the Beginning of Tango'' 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; All sources stress the influence of the African communities and their rhythms, while the instruments and techniques brought in by European immigrants in the 20th century played a major role in its final definition, relating it to the [[Salon music]] styles to which Tango would contribute back at a later stage.

[[Angel Villoldo]]'s 1903 tango [[El Choclo]] was first recorded no later than 1906 in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="DAHR-b3624"&gt;{{cite web|title=Victor matrix B-3624. El choclo / Victor Argentine Orchestra|url=http://victor.library.ucsb.edu/index.php/matrix/detail/200005245/B-3624-El_choclo|website=Discography of American Historical Recordings|publisher=Univ. of Calif.|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Villoldo himself recorded it in Paris (possibly in April, 1908, with the Orchestre Tzigane du Restaurant du Rat Mort).&lt;ref name="Tcommuter"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Tangocommuter|title=Ángel Villoldo, Paris and early tango|url=https://tangocommuter1.blogspot.com/2014/07/angel-villoldo-paris-and-early-tango.html|accessdate=19 November 2017|date=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Villoldo had to record in Paris because in Argentina at the time there was no recording studio.

Early tango was played by immigrants in [[Buenos Aires]] then later in [[Montevideo]].&lt;ref&gt;Norese, María Rosalía: ''Contextualization and analysis of tango. Its origins to the emergence of the avant-garde''. University of Salamanca, 2002 ({{Google books|HRQQhaDqqwIC|restricted online copy|page=5}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investigandoeltango.com/eltangoesbuenosaires.htm|title=Investigando el Tango – Tésis Doctoral – Dra.

It took time to move into wider circles: in the early 20th century it was the favorite music of thugs and [[gangsters]] who visited the [[brothels]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ellitoral.com/index.php/id_um/99627-el-tango-y-las-putas Tango and whores] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a city with 100,000 more men than women (in 1914). The complex dances that arose from such rich music reflects how the men would practice the dance in groups, demonstrating male sexuality and causing a blending of emotion and aggressiveness. The music was played on portable instruments: [[flute]], [[guitar]] and [[violin]] trios, with [[bandoneón]] arriving at the end of the 19th century. The ''[[organito]]'', a portable player-organ, broadened the popularity of certain songs. [[Eduardo Arolas]] was the major instrument of the bandoneón's popularization, with [[Vicente Greco]] soon standardizing the tango sextet as consisting of [[piano]], [[double bass]], two [[violins]] and two bandoneóns.

Like many forms of popular music, tango was associated with the underclass, and attempts were made to restrict its influence{{By whom|date=October 2014}}. In spite of the scorn, some, like writer [[Ricardo Güiraldes]], were fans. Güiraldes played a part in the international popularization of tango, which had conquered the world by the end of World War I, and wrote a poem ("Tango") which describes the music as the "all-absorbing love of a tyrant, jealously guarding his dominion, over women who have surrendered submissively, like obedient beasts".&lt;ref name=DennistonCouple/&gt;

One song that would become the most widely known of all tango melodies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McLean |first=Michael |title=Care to Tango?, Book 2 |isbn=0-7390-5100-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; also dates from this time. The first two sections of ''[[La Cumparsita]]'' were composed as a march instrumental in 1916 by teen-aged [[Gerardo Matos Rodríguez]] of Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://totango.net/cumpar.html ToTANGO.

== Argentine roots of Tango ==

Besides the global influences mentioned above, early Tango was locally influenced by [[Payada]], the [[Milonga (music)|Milonga]] from Argentine and Uruguay [[Pampas]], and Uruguayan [[Candombe]]. In Argentina there was Milonga "from the country" since the mid eighteenth century. The first "payador" remembered is [[Santos Vega]]. The origins of Milonga seem to be in the Pampa with strong African influences, especially though the local Candombe (which would be related to its contemporary Candombe in Buenos Aires and Montevideo). It is believed that this candombe existed and was practised in Argentina since the first slaves were brought into the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revistaquilombo.com.ar/documentos/frigeriocandombeargentino.pdf|title=Revista Quilombo – Noticias, columnas, articulos y opiniones.|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310062053/http://www.revistaquilombo.com.ar/documentos/frigeriocandombeargentino.pdf|archivedate=10 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the word "tango" to describe a music/dance style had been printed as early as 1823 in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]], the first Argentinian written reference is from an 1866 newspaper, that quotes the song "La Coqueta" (an [[Argentine tango]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hlmtango.com/notas/historia-del-tango/el-nacimiento-del-tango/|title=Notas  - Historia del Tango - El nacimiento del Tango -  hlm!.Tango - Hágase la música - hagaselamusica.com|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876 a tango-candombe called "El Merenguengué"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denorteasur.com/asp/articulo.asp?numero=241&amp;id=766 Tango-candombe afroargentino "El Merenguengué".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321094524/http://www.denorteasur.com/asp/articulo.asp?numero=241&amp;id=766 |date=2012-03-21 }}{{Verify source|date=November 2016}}&lt;!--All archives for this URL display a different title: "Los comienzos del tango".--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Gutman &lt;s&gt;op. cit.&lt;/s&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;!--There is nothing by anyone named Gutman cited elsewhere in this article.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; became very popular, after its success in the Afro-Argentines carnival held in February of that year. It is played with harp, violin and flute in addition to the Afro-Argentine Candombe drums ("Llamador" and "Repicador"). This has been seriously considered as one of the strong points of departure for the birth and development of Tango.&lt;ref&gt;[http://estatico.buenosaires.gov.ar/areas/cultura/museos/dg_museos/pdf/gardel/historianegra.pdf Museum House of Carlos Gardel “The Black history of Tango”.]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706083507/http://estatico.buenosaires.gov.ar/areas/cultura/museos/dg_museos/pdf/gardel/historianegra.pdf |date=2011-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first  "group" of tango, was composed of two [[Afro-Argentine]]s, "the black" [[Casimiro Alcorta]] (violin)  and "the mulatto" Sinforoso (clarinet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rincondeltango.com/ht/HTLosPrimitivosC.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060712034120/http://www.rincondeltango.com/ht/HTLosPrimitivosC.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=12 July 2006|title="Historia del tango-Los primitivos conjuntos" por Tesy Cariaga – Buenos Aires – Argentina.- .: Rincón del Tango :.|first=|last=www.RrinconDelTango.com|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They did small concerts in Buenos Aires since the early 1870s until the early 1890s.  "The black Casimiro" is author of "Entrada Prohibida" ("Entry Forbidden"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://estatico.buenosaires.gov.ar/areas/cultura/museos/dg_museos/pdf/gardel/historianegra.pdf El negro Casimiro Alcorta, y su tango "Entrada Prohibida"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706083507/http://estatico.buenosaires.gov.ar/areas/cultura/museos/dg_museos/pdf/gardel/historianegra.pdf |date=2011-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; then signed by the brothers Teisseire, and "la yapa"; in turn, is credited with the tango  "Concha sucia", which was later amended and signed by F. Canaro as "Cara sucia" ("dirty face").&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140729104536/http://estatico.buenosaires.gov.ar/areas/cultura/museos/dg_museos/pdf/gardel/historianegra.pdf El negro Casimiro Alcorta, y su tango "Concha Sucia".]&lt;/ref&gt; It must be said, though that this duo was the author and performer of many of the early tangos now listed as "anonymous", since at that time were not used to signing works.

Before the 1900s, the following tangos were being played: "El queco" (anonymous, attributed to clarinetist Lino Galeano in 1885),&lt;ref name=Scholz2008&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R01jckaUZ_gC&amp;pg=PA19 |page=19 |last=Scholz |first=Cora |title=Tango argentino—seine Ursprünge und soziokulturelle Entwicklung |language=German |publisher=GRIN Verlag |year=2008 |isbn=3-640-11862-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Señora casera"  (anonymous 1880), "Andate a la recoleta"  (anonymous 1880),&lt;ref name=Scholz2008/&gt; "El Porteñito" (by the Spaniard Gabriel Diez in 1880),&lt;ref name=Scholz2008/&gt; "Tango Nº1" (Jose Machado - 1883), "Dame la lata"  (Juan Perez, 1888),&lt;ref name=Scholz2008/&gt; "Que polvo con tanto viento"  (anonymous 1890),&lt;ref name=Scholz2008/&gt; "No me tires con la tapa de la olla"  (A.A. 1893), "El Talar" (Prudencio Aragon – 1895).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esto.es/tango/Historia/historia.htm|title=Lugares de baile|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first women to write tango scores was [[Eloísa D’Herbil]].

(Hey, no stealing) and others, between 1872 and 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Horvath|first=Ricardo|title=Esos malditos tangos: apuntes para la otra historia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ItWcuoyih4C&amp;pg=PA61|year=2006|publisher=Editorial Biblos|location=Buenos Aires, Argentina|language=Spanish|isbn=978-950-786-549-7|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ostuni|first1=Ricardo|title=La baronesa del tango|url=http://todoshow.infonews.com/nota/1146/la-baronesa-del-tango|accessdate=14 July 2017|publisher=''InfoNews''|date=22 November 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714140755/http://todoshow.infonews.com/nota/1146/la-baronesa-del-tango|archivedate=14 July 2017|location=Buenos Aires, Argentina|language=Spanish|trans-title=The baroness of tango}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded musical score (though no author) is "La Canguela" (1889) and is in the Museum of the City Score Rosario. On the other hand, the first copyrighted tango score is "El entrerriano", released in 1896 and printed in 1898 – by [[Rosendo Mendizabal]], an Afro-Argentine. As for the transition between the old "Tango criollo" (Milonga from the Pampas, evolved with touches of Afro-Argentine Candombe, and some of [[habanera (music)|Habanera)]], and the Tango of the Old Guard, there are the next songs: [[Ángel Villoldo]] ("[[El choclo]]", 1903) ("El Pimpolla", 1904), ("La Vida del Carretero", 1905) y ("El Negro Alegre", 1907), de [[Gabino Ezeiza]] ("El Tango Patagones", 1905), y de [[Higinio Cazón]] ("El Taita", 1905). Moreover, the first tango recorded by an orchestra was "Don Juan", whose author is Ernesto Ponzio. It was recorded by the orchestra of Vicente Greco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todotango.com/english/biblioteca/cronicas/leyenda_don_juan.asp|title=Todotango.com – Todo sobre el tango argentino|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516012424/http://www.todotango.com/english/biblioteca/cronicas/leyenda_don_juan.asp|archivedate=16 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todotango.com/english/biblioteca/cronicas/primera_grabacion.asp|title=Todotango.com – Todo sobre el tango argentino|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323181909/http://www.todotango.com/english/biblioteca/CRONICAS/primera_grabacion.asp|archivedate=23 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1920s and 1930s, Carlos Gardel ==
[[Image:Gardel.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Carlos Gardel]], perpetual symbol of tango]]
[[File:Por una cabeza carlos gardel.ogg|right|thumb|"Por Una Cabeza" (1935) by Carlos Gardel and Alfredo Le Pera. Sung by Carlos Gardel.]]
Tango soon began to gain popularity in Europe, beginning in France. Superstar [[Carlos Gardel]] soon became a [[sex symbol]] who brought tango to new audiences, especially in the United States, due to his sensual depictions of the dance on film. In the 1920s, tango moved out of the lower-class brothels and became a more respectable form of music and dance. Bandleaders like [[Roberto Firpo]] and [[Francisco Canaro]] dropped the flute and added a [[double bass]] in its place. Lyrics were still typically macho, blaming women for countless heartaches, and the dance moves were still sexual and aggressive.

[[Carlos Gardel]] became especially associated with the transition from a lower-class "gangster" music to a respectable middle-class dance. He helped develop [[tango-canción]] in the 1920s and became one of the most popular tango artists of all time. He was also one of the precursors of the '''Golden Age of tango'''.

Gardel's death was followed by a division into movements within tango. Evolutionists like [[Aníbal Troilo]] and [[Carlos di Sarli]] were opposed to traditionalists like [[Rodolfo Biagi]] and [[Juan d'Arienzo]].

== Golden Age ==

The "Golden Age" of tango music and dance is generally agreed to have been the period from about 1935 to 1952, roughly contemporaneous with the [[big band]] era in the United States. Tango was performed by [[Orquesta típica|orquestas típicas]], bands often including over a dozen performers.

Some of the many popular and influential orchestras included the orchestras of [[Mariano Mores]], [[Juan d'Arienzo]], [[Francisco Canaro]], and [[Aníbal Troilo]]. D'Arienzo was called the "Rey del compás" or "King of the beat" for the insistent, driving rhythm which can be heard on many of his recordings. "El flete" is an excellent example of D'Arienzo's approach. Canaro's early milongas are generally the slowest and easiest to dance to; and for that reason, they are the most frequently played at tango dances ([[Milonga (place)|milongas]]); "Milonga Sentimental" is a classic example.

Beginning in the Golden Age and continuing afterwards, the orchestras of [[Osvaldo Pugliese]] and [[Carlos di Sarli]] made many recordings. Di Sarli had a lush, grandiose sound, and emphasized strings and piano over the bandoneón, which is heard in "A la gran muñeca" and "[[Bahía Blanca]]" (the name of his home town).

Pugliese's first recordings were not too different from those of other dance orchestras, but he developed a complex, rich, and sometimes discordant sound, which is heard in his signature pieces, "Gallo ciego", "Emancipación", and "La yumba". Pugliese's later music was played for an audience and not intended for dancing, although it is often used for stage choreography for its dramatic potential, and sometimes played late at night at milongas.

Eventually tango transcended its Latin boundaries, as European bands adopted it into their dance repertoires&lt;sup&gt;[23–27]&lt;/sup&gt;. Non-traditional instruments were often added, such as accordion (in place of bandoneon), saxophone, clarinet, ukulele, mandolin, electric organ, etc., as well as lyrics in non-Spanish languages. European tango became a mainstream worldwide dance and popular music style, alongside with foxtrot, slow waltz, and rumba. It somewhat diverged from its Argentinian origin and developed characteristic European styles. Famous European band leaders who adopted tango included, to name a few, {{ill|Otto Dobrindt|de}}, [[Marek Weber]], [[Oskar Joost]], {{ill|Barnabas von Geczy|de}}, Jose Lucchesi, {{ill|Kurt Widmann|de|Kurt Widmann (Musiker)}}, {{ill|Adalbert Lutter|de}}, [[Paul Godwin]], [[Alexander Tsfasman]], as well as famous singers [[Leo Monosson]], [[Zarah Leander]], [[Rudi Schuricke]], [[Tino Rossi]], {{ill|Janus Poplawski|pl|Janusz Popławski (muzyk)}}, [[Mieczysław Fogg]], [[Pyotr Leshchenko]], and others. The popularity of European tango precipitously declined with the advent of rock-n-roll in the 50s–60s.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Wölfer Jazz in Deutschland – Das Lexikon.

== Tango nuevo ==
The later age of tango has been dominated by [[Ástor Piazzolla]], whose ''[[Adios Nonino|Adiós nonino]]'' became the most influential work of tango music since Carlos Gardel's ''[[El día que me quieras (song)|El día que me quieras]]'' was released in 1935. During the 1950s, Piazzolla consciously tried to create a more academic form with new sounds breaking the classic forms of tango, drawing the derision of purists and old-time performers. The 1970s saw Buenos Aires developing a fusion of [[jazz]] and tango. [[Litto Nebbia]] and Siglo XX were especially popular within this movement. In the 1970s and 1980s, the vocal octet [[Buenos Aires 8]] recorded classic tangos in elaborate arrangements, with complex harmonies and jazz influence, and also recorded an album with compositions by Piazzolla.

The so-called post-Piazzolla generation (1980–) includes musicians such as [[Dino Saluzzi]], [[Rodolfo Mederos]], Gustavo Beytelmann and Juan Jose Mosalini. Piazzolla and his followers developed ''[[nuevo tango]]'', a musical genre that incorporated jazz and classical influences into a more experimental style.

In the late 1990s, composer and pianist [[Fernando Otero]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nonesuch.com/artists/fernando-otero|title=About Fernando Otero|work=[[Nonesuch Records]]|author=Michael Hill|accessdate=2013-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; continued to add elements to the innovation process which had started decades ago, expanding the orchestration and form while including improvisation and atonal aspects in his work.

== Neotango ==

Tango development did not stop with [[tango nuevo]]. 21st-century tango is referred to as [[neotango]]. These recent trends can be described as "electro tango" or "tango fusion", where the electronic influences range from subtle to dominant.

[[Tanghetto]] and [[Carlos Libedinsky]] are good examples of the subtle use of electronic elements. The music still has its tango feeling, the complex rhythmic and melodious entanglement that makes tango so unique. [[Gotan Project]] is a group that formed in 1999 in Paris, consisting of musicians Philippe Cohen Solal, [[Eduardo Makaroff]] and Christoph H Muller. Their releases include ''Vuelvo al Sur/El capitalismo foráneo'' (2000), ''[[La Revancha del Tango]]'' (2001), ''[[Inspiración Espiración]]'' (2004), and ''[[Lunático]]'' (2006). Their sound features electronic elements like samples, beats and sounds on top of a tango groove. Some dancers enjoy dancing to this music, although many traditional dancers regard it as a definite break in style and tradition.

[[Bajofondo Tango Club]] is another example of electro-tango. Further examples can be found on the [[CD]]s ''Tango?'', [[Hybrid Tango]], [[Tangophobia Vol. 1]], ''Tango Crash'' (with a major [[jazz]] influence), ''Latin Tango'' by Rodrigo Favela (featuring classic and modern elements), ''NuTango''. ''Tango Fusion Club Vol. 1'' by the creator of the milonga called "Tango Fusion Club" in [[Munich]], Germany, ''Felino'' by the Norwegian group [[Electrocutango]] and "Electronic Tango", a compilation CD. In 2004, the music label World Music Network released a collection under the title ''The Rough Guide to Tango Nuevo''.

== New tango songs ==
In the second half of the nineteen-nineties, a new movement of tango composers and tango orchestras playing new songs was born in Buenos Aires. It was mainly influenced by the old orchestra style rather than by Piazzolla’s renewal and experiments with electronic music. The novelty lies in the new songs, with today’s lyrics and language, which find inspiration in a wide variety of contemporary styles.

Over the two first decades of this century, the movement has grown with the creation of countless bands playing new tangos. The most prominent figures leading this phenomenon have been the Orquesta Típica Fernandez Fierro, whose creator, Julian Peralta,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1399835-julian-peralta-la-seleccion-de-los-tangos-nuevos|title=Julián Peralta: La selección de los tangos nuevos|access-date=2016-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.clarin.com/extrashow/musica/Levantar-tango-siesta_0_743325784.html|title=Levantar al tango de su siesta|last=Cas|first=Andrés|newspaper=Clarin.com|access-date=2016-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1940017-tangos-de-estreno-clasicos-de-las-orquestas-del-futuro|title=Tangos de estreno: clásicos de las orquestas del futuro|access-date=2016-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tiempoar.com.ar/articulo/view/60510/pensamos-al-tango-como-una-ma-sica-popular|title="Pensamos al tango como una música popular" – tiempoar.com.ar|last=tiempoar.com.ar|newspaper=tiempoar.com.ar|access-date=2016-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; would later start Astillero and the Orquesta Típica Julián Peralta.

== Musical impact and classical interpreters ==

Although tango music was strictly circumscribed to the tango interpreters it was the classically trained Argentinian pianist Arminda Canteros (1911–2002) who used to play tangos to satisfy the requests of her father who could not understand [[Classical music]]. She developed her own style and had a weekly program of tango music for a radio station in [[Rosario]], [[Argentina]] in the 1930s and 1940s. Since tango playing was considered the epitome of [[machismo]], she had to take the masculine pseudonym, "Juancho" for the broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZijnqLrBSO0|title=Arminda Canteros, pianist, plays Invierno Porteño by Astor Piazzolla|first=|last=JohnDavidChapman|date=8 August 2011|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eltangoysusinvitados.com/2009/08/arminda-canteros-biografia.html|title=El Tango y sus invitados: Arminda Canteros|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ms. Canteros settled in [[New York City]] in 1970 where she recorded later in 1989 her CD "Tangos" when she was 78 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eltangoysusinvitados.com/2009/08/arminda-canteros-tangossolos-de-piano.html|title=El Tango y sus invitados: Arminda Canteros – Tangos(Solos de piano)-1989|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following Ms. Cantero’s example, another Argentinian female pianist brought tango music to the concert halls: [[Cecilia Pillado]] played a complete tango recital at the [[Berliner Philharmonie]] in 1997 and recorded that program for her CD “Cexilia’s Tangos”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangomalambo.com/en/cexilias-tangos.html|title=Tango Malambo – Cecilia Pillado´s Label|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817022509/http://www.tangomalambo.com/en/cexilias-tangos.html|archivedate=17 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then tango has become part of the repertoire for great classical musicians like the baritone [[Jorge Chaminé]] with his ''Tangos'' recording with [[bandoneón]]ist [[Olivier Manoury]]. Also [[al Tango]], [[Yo-Yo Ma]], [[Martha Argerich]], [[Daniel Barenboim]], [[Gidon Kremer]], [[Plácido Domingo]] and [[Marcelo Alvarez]] have performed and recorded Tangos.

Some classical composers have written tangos, such as [[Isaac Albéniz]] in ''España'' (1890), [[Erik Satie]] in ''Le Tango perpétuel'' (1914), [[Igor Stravinsky]] in ''[[Histoire du Soldat]]'' (1918). Nikolai Myaskovsky composed an Argentinian Death Tango for a poem War and Peace. [[Kurt Weill]] continued this style in ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' (1928) (Die Dreigroschenoper), e.g. composed a song called 'Tango Ballade' or 'Zuhälterballade', a fateful song about underworld life (a symphonic version in suite Kleine Dreigroschenmusik commissioned by [[Otto Klemperer]]); a bit latter he composed another evergreen, 'Youkali' (Tango-Habanera) on French lyrics. Also noteworthy was the accordionist [[John Serry Sr.]] who composed ''Tango of Love'' &amp; ''Petite Tango'' for accordion quartet (1955).&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress- Copyright Office, ''Tango of Love'', ''Petite Tango''. Copyright – Alpha Music Co., New York, NY. Composer: John Serry Sr. 1955&lt;/ref&gt;  The list of composers who wrote inspired by tango music also includes [[John Cage]] in ''Perpetual Tango'' (1984), [[John Harbison]] in "Tango Seen from Ground Level" (1991), and [[Milton Babbitt]] in "It Takes Twelve to Tango" (1984). The influence of [[Piazzolla]] has fallen on a number of contemporary composers. The "Tango Mortale" in ''Arcadiana'' by [[Thomas Adès]] is an example.

Many popular songs in the United States have borrowed melodies from tango: the earliest published tango, ''El Choclo'', lent its melody to the fifties hit ''[[Kiss of Fire]]''. Similarly ''Adiós Muchachos'' became ''[[I Get Ideas]]'', and ''Strange Sensation'' was based on ''[[La Cumparsita]]''.

Showing tango music's continued popularity, multiple international radio stations broadcast non-stop tango music today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://argentinetangoradio.com Argentine Tango Radio]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5082">'''Tattvacintāmaṇi''' is a treatise in [[Sanskrit]] authored by 12th century CE Indian logician and philosopher [[Gangesha Upadhyaya|Gangesa Upadhyaya]] (also known as Gangesvara Upadhyaya). The title may be translated into English as "A Thought-jewel of Truth." The treatise is also known as Pramāṇa-cintāmaṇi ("A Thought-jewel of Valid Knowledge").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Satis Chandra Vidyabhusana|title=A History of Indian Logic: Ancient, Mediaeval and Modern Schools|date=1920|publisher=Motilal Banarsidas|location=Delhi|isbn=9788120805651|page=405}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The treatise introduced a new era in the history of Indian logic. Satis Chandra Vidyabhusana in his authoritative 681-page history of Indian logic divided the millennia long history of Indian logic into three sometimes overlapping periods: Ancient period (650 BCE – 100 CE), Medieval period (100 CE – 1200 CE) and Modern period (from 900 CE). He also identified certain standard work as typical representative of each of these periods. Tattvacinthamani of Gangesa is the text identified as the standard work of the Modern period in the history of Indian logic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Satis Chandra Vidyabhusana|title=A History of Indian Logic: Ancient, Mediaeval and Modern Schools|date=1920|publisher=Motilal Banarsidas|location=Delhi|isbn=9788120805651|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; the standard works for the earlier periods being [[Nyāya Sūtras|Nyāya Sūtra]] by Akṣapāda Gautama (Ancient period) and [[Pramāṇa-samuccaya]] by [[Dignāga]] (Medieval period). The fact that Tattvacintāmaṇi was highly popular is attested by the appearance of a large number of commentaries that have been produced in the centuries that followed the appearance of the book.  It has been estimated that while the original text of Tattvacintāmaṇi has about 300 pages, all the commentaries put together contain about a million pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Satis Chandra Vidyabhusana|title=A History of Indian Logic: Ancient, Medieval and Modern Schools|date=1920|publisher=Motilal Banarsidas|location=Delhi|isbn=9788120805651|page=454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author of Tattvacintāmaṇi==
Gangesa Upadhyaya, also known as Gangesvara Upadhyaya, a Maithila Brahmin, who flourished during the 12th century CE, is the author of Tattvacintāmaṇi. Gangesa was a native of Mithila, was born in a village named Chadana and lived his later life in a  village named Karion on the banks of the river Kamala, twelve miles south-east of Darbhanga.  There is a legend to the effect that   Gangesa was completely illiterate while he was young and propitiated the goddess Kali on the cremation ground adjacent to his uncle's house, and acquired from her, as a boon, deep erudition in the science of Logic. He belonged to Kashyapa-gotra. It is believed that he had several wives, three sons and a daughter. One of his sons was Vardhamana Upadhyaya who was also a pupil of Gangesa. Varadhamana himself became a great scholar of nyaya and composed a commentary on Tattvacintāmaṇi named Tattvacintāmaṇi-prakasa and also several other works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karl H. Potter, Sibajiban Bhattacharyya|title=Volume 6 of Encyclopedia of Indian philosophies: Indian philosophical analysis Nyaya-Vaiśesika from Gangeśa to Raghunatha Śiromani|date=1993|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=9788120803077|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outline of contents==
Large sections of the treatise have not yet been translated into English or any other Indian languages. Broadly, Tattva-Cintāmaṇi is divided into four books dealing respectively with perception (pratyaksha), inference  (anumāna), comparison (upamāna) and verbal testimony (sabda). According to nyaya doctrines, these are the four means for deriving valid knowledge. The following references provide sources where one can find detailed accounts of the contents of Tattva-Cintāmaṇi. 

==Commentaries on Tattva-Cintāmaṇi==
Tattva-Cintāmaṇi has attracted a large number of commentaries. Vardhamana Mahopadhyaya, a son of Gangesa, has himself written a commentary on Tattva-Cintāmaṇi. ''The History of Logic'' gives brief accounts of as many as 48 commentaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Satis Chandra Vidyabhusana|title=A History of Indian Logic|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=454–487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bia-map-indian-reservations-usa.png|thumb|300px|Reservation lands in the Continental United States]]
'''Tribal sovereignty in the United States''' is the concept of the inherent authority of [[Indian tribes in the United States|indigenous tribes]] to govern themselves within the borders of the United States. The [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] recognizes tribal nations as "domestic dependent nations" and has established a number of laws attempting to clarify the relationship between the federal, state, and tribal governments.

==Native American sovereignty and the Constitution==

The [[United States Constitution]] mentions Native American tribes three times:

* Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 states that "Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States ... excluding Indians not taxed."&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Constitution of the United States of America#Article I|Constitution of the United States of America: Article. I.]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States|Story's ''Commentaries on the U.S. Constitution'']], "There were Indians, also, in several, and probably in most, of the states at that period, who were not treated as citizens, and yet, who did not form a part of independent communities or tribes, exercising general sovereignty and powers of government within the boundaries of the states."
* Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution states that "Congress shall have the power to regulate Commerce with foreign nations and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes",&lt;ref name=Policy-Center&gt;American Indian Policy Center. 2005. St. Paul, MN. 4 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; determining that Indian tribes were separate from the federal government, the states, and foreign nations;&lt;ref&gt;''Cherokee Nation v. Georgia''&lt;/ref&gt; and
* The Fourteenth Amendment, Section 2 amends the apportionment of representatives in Article I, Section 2 above.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Additional amendments to the United States Constitution|Additional amendments to the United States Constitution]]&lt;/ref&gt;

These basic provisions have been changed or clarified by various federal laws over the history of the United States. ''Regulate'' historically meant ''facilitate'', rather than control or direct in the more modern sense. Therefore, the Congress of these United States was to be the facilitator of commerce between the states and the tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary, ''regulate'' meant that Congress should in principle assist with Commerce disputes between the States, but did not grant Congress the power of law to inflict criminal penalties,  [http://www.tenthamendmentcenter.com/kentucky-resolutions-of-1798/ Article 2 of the Kentucky Resolutions of 1798] by Thomas Jefferson&lt;/ref&gt;

These Constitutional provisions, and subsequent interpretations by the Supreme Court (see below), are today often summarized in three principles of U.S. Indian law:&lt;ref&gt;Charles F. Wilkinson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IHKXAAAAMAAJ Indian tribes as sovereign governments: a sourcebook on federal-tribal history, law, and policy], AIRI Press, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=deskbook&gt;Conference of Western Attorneys General, American Indian Law Deskbook, University Press of Colorado, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. Bruce Duthu, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8u0UstccznkC American Indians and the Law], Penguin/Viking, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Territorial sovereignty''': Tribal authority on Indian land is organic and is not granted by the states in which Indian lands are located.
* '''Plenary power doctrine''': Congress, and not the [[United States Executive Branch|Executive Branch]] or [[United States Judicial Branch|Judicial Branch]], has ultimate authority with regard to matters affecting the Indian tribes. Federal courts give greater deference to Congress on Indian matters than on other subjects.
* '''Trust relationship''': The federal government has a "duty to protect" the tribes, implying (courts have found) the necessary legislative and executive authorities to effect that duty.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. McCarthy, The Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Federal Trust Obligation to American Indians, 19 BYU J. PUB. L. 1 (December, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==

===The Marshall Trilogy, 1823–1832===
[[File:Hassanamisco Nipmuc Indian Sign.jpg|thumb|250px|Hassanamisco Nipmuc Indian Reservation Sign]]
The Marshall Trilogy is a set of three Supreme Court decisions in the early nineteenth century affirming the legal and political standing of Indian nations.

* ''[[Johnson v. M'Intosh]]'' (1823), holding that private citizens could not purchase lands from Native Americans.
* ''[[Cherokee Nation v. Georgia]]'' (1831), holding the Cherokee nation dependent, with a relationship to the United States like that of a "ward to its guardian".
* ''[[Worcester v. Georgia]]'' (1832), which laid out the relationship between tribes and the state and federal governments, stating that the federal government was the sole authority to deal with Indian nations.

===Indian Appropriations Act of 1871===

The [[Indian Appropriations Act#1871 Act|Indian Appropriations Act of 1871]] had two significant sections. First, the Act ended United States recognition of additional Native American tribes or independent nations, and prohibited additional treaties. Thus it required the federal government no longer interact with the various tribes through treaties, but rather through statutes:

{{quote|That hereafter no Indian nation or tribe within the territory of the United States shall be acknowledged or recognized as an independent nation, tribe, or power with whom the United States may contract by treaty: Provided, further, that nothing herein contained shall be construed to invalidate or impair the obligation of any treaty heretofore lawfully made and ratified with any such Indian nation or tribe.|Indian Appropriations Act of 1871&lt;ref name="App_act"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law.onecle.com/constitution/article-2/21-indian-treaties.html |title=Indian Treaties |accessdate=2009-03-31 |author=Onecle |date=November 8, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="25 usc 71"&gt;25 U.S.C. § 71. Indian Appropriation Act of March 3, 1871, 16 Stat. 544, 566&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Before 1871, the United States had recognized the Indian Tribes as semi-independent.

The 1871 Act also made it a federal crime to commit murder, manslaughter, rape, assault with intent to kill, arson, burglary, and larceny within any Territory of the United States.

===''United States v. Kagama'' (1886)===
The 1871 Act was affirmed in 1886 by the US Supreme Court, in ''[[United States v. Kagama]]'', which affirmed that the Congress has [[plenary power]] over all Native American tribes within its borders by rationalization that "The power of the general government over these remnants of a race once powerful ... is necessary to their protection as well as to the safety of those among whom they dwell".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=118&amp;invol=375 |title=''U.S. v Kagama'', 118 U.S. 375 (1886), Filed May 10, 1886 |publisher=FindLaw, a Thomson Reuters business |accessdate=2012-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court affirmed that the US Government "has the right and authority, instead of controlling them by treaties, to govern them by acts of Congress, they being within the geographical limit of the United States. ... The Indians owe no allegiance to a State within which their reservation may be established, and the State gives them no protection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/118/375/ |title=''United States v. Kagama'' – 118 U.S. 375 (1886) |publisher=Justia |accessdate=2012-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Empowerment of tribal courts, 1883===
{{also|United States Indian Police}}
On April 10, 1883, five years after establishing Indian police powers throughout the various reservations, the Indian Commissioner approved rules for a "court of Indian offenses". The court provided a venue for prosecuting criminal charges, but afforded no relief for tribes seeking to resolve civil matters. The new courts' rules specifically targeted tribal religious practices which it called "heathenish rites" and the commissioner urged courts to "destroy the tribal relations as fast as possible". Another five years later, Congress began providing funds to operate the Indian courts.

While U.S. courts clarified some of the rights and responsibilities of states and the federal government toward the Indian nations within the new nation's first century, it was almost another century before United States courts determined what powers remained vested in the tribal nations. In the interim, as a trustee charged with protecting their interests and property, the federal government was legally entrusted with ownership and administration of the assets, land, water, and treaty rights of the tribal nations.

===The General Allotment Act (Dawes Act), 1887===
{{Main|Dawes Act}}
Passed by Congress in 1887, the "Dawes Act" was named for Senator Henry L. Dawes of Massachusetts, Chairman of the Senate's Indian Affairs Committee. It came as another crucial step in attacking the tribal aspect of the Indians of the time. In essence, the act broke up the land of most all tribes into modest parcels to be distributed to Indian families, and those remaining were auctioned off to white purchasers. Indians who accepted the farmland and became "civilized" were made American citizens. But the Act itself proved disastrous for Indians, as much tribal land was lost and cultural traditions destroyed. Whites benefited the most; for example, when the government made {{convert|2|e6acre|km2}} of Indian lands available in Oklahoma, 50,000 white settlers poured in almost instantly to claim it all (in a period of one day, April 22, 1889).

==Twentieth-century developments==
{{cleanup|section|date=November 2009}}

===Revenue and Indian Citizenship acts, 1924===
The ''[[Revenue Act of 1924]]'' ({{USStat|43|253}}) (June 2, 1924), also known as the ''Mellon tax bill'', cut [[Federal Government of the United States|federal]] [[tax]] rates and established the [[U.S. Board of Tax Appeals]], which was later renamed the [[United States Tax Court]] in 1942. The bill was named after [[U.S. Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Andrew Mellon]]. The Revenue Act was applicable to incomes for 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/61/item/20394?start_page=44|title=Statistics of Income, 1926 - FRASER - St. Louis Fed|website=fraser.stlouisfed.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bottom rate, on income under $4,000, fell from 1.5% to 1.125% (both rates are after reduction by the "[[earned income credit]]"). A parallel act, the ''[[Indian Citizenship Act of 1924]]'' ({{USStat|43|253}}, Ch. 233 (1924)), granted all non-citizen resident Indians citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0700/stories/0701_0146.html |title=The 1924 Indian Citizenship Act |publisher=Nebraskastudies.org |date=1924-06-02 |accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Oklahoma State University Library |url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/vol4/html_files/v4p1165.html |title=Indian Affairs: Laws And Treaties. Vol. Iv, Laws |publisher=Digital.library.okstate.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the Revenue Act declared that there were no longer any "Indians, not taxed" to be not counted for purposes of [[United States Congressional apportionment]]. President [[Calvin Coolidge]] signed the bill into law.

In ''[[Iron Crow v. Oglala Sioux Tribe]]'', the United States Supreme Court concluded that two [[Oglala Sioux]] defendants convicted of adultery under tribal laws, and another challenging a tax from the tribe, were not exempted from the tribal justice system because they had been granted U.S. citizenship. It found that tribes "still possess their inherent sovereignty excepting only when it has been specifically taken from them by treaty or Congressional Act". This means American Indians do not have exactly the same rights of citizenship as other American citizens. The court cited case law from a pre-1924 case that said, "when Indians are prepared to exercise the privileges and bear the burdens of" ''[[sui iuris]]'', i.e. of one's own right and not under the power of someone else, "the tribal relation may be dissolved and the national guardianship brought to an end, but it rests with Congress to determine when and how this shall be done, and whether the emancipation shall be complete or only partial" (''U.S. v. Nice'', 1916). The court further determined, based on the earlier ''Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock'' case, that "It is thoroughly established that Congress has [[plenary authority]] over Indians." The court held that, "the granting of citizenship in itself did not destroy ... jurisdiction of the Indian tribal courts and ... there was no intention on the part of Congress to do so." The adultery conviction and the power of tribal courts were upheld.

===Indian Reorganization Act, 1934===
In 1934 the ''[[Indian Reorganization Act]]'', codified as Title 25, Section 476 of the U.S. Code, allowed Indian nations to select from a catalogue of constitutional documents that enumerated powers for tribes and for [[Tribal Council|tribal councils]]. Though the Act did not specifically recognize the Courts of Indian Offenses, 1934 is widely considered to be the year when tribal authority, rather than United States authority, gave the tribal courts legitimacy.

In 1956, a U.S. Court concluded no law had ever established tribal courts, but nonetheless, decades of federal funding implied that they were legitimate courts. {{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Public Law 280, 1953===
{{details|Indian termination policy}}
In 1953, Congress enacted [[Public Law 280]], which gave some states extensive jurisdiction over the criminal and civil controversies involving Indians on Indian lands. Many, especially Indians, continue to believe the law unfair because it imposed a system of laws on the tribal nations without their approval.

In 1965 the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] concluded that no law had ever extended provisions of the U.S. Constitution, including the right of [[habeas corpus]], to tribal members brought before tribal courts. Still, the court concluded, "it is pure fiction to say that the Indian courts functioning in the Fort Belknap Indian community are not in part, at least, arms of the federal government. Originally they were created by federal executive and imposed upon the Indian community, and to this day the federal government still maintains a partial control over them." In the end however, the Ninth Circuit limited its decision to the particular reservation in question and stated, "it does not follow from our decision that the tribal court must comply with every constitutional restriction that is applicable to federal or state courts."

While many modern courts in Indian nations today have established [[full faith and credit]] with state courts, the nations still have no direct access to U.S. courts. When an Indian nation files suit against a state in U.S. court, they do so with the approval of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]]. In the modern legal era, courts and congress have, however, further refined the often competing jurisdictions of tribal nations, states and the United States in regard to Indian law.

In the 1978 case of ''[[Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe]]'', the Supreme Court, in a 6–2 opinion authored by Justice [[William Rehnquist]], concluded that tribal courts do not have jurisdiction over non-Indians (the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court at that time, [[Warren Burger]], and Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]] filed a dissenting opinion). But the case left unanswered some questions, including whether tribal courts could use criminal contempt powers against non-Indians to maintain decorum in the courtroom, or whether tribal courts could subpoena non-Indians.

A 1981 case, ''[[Montana v. United States]]'', clarified that tribal nations possess inherent power over their internal affairs, and civil authority over non-members within tribal lands to the extent necessary to protect health, welfare, economic interests or political integrity of the tribal nation.

Other cases of those years precluded states from interfering with tribal nations' sovereignty. Tribal sovereignty is dependent on, and subordinate to, only the federal government, not states, under ''Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Indian Reservation'' (1980). Tribes are sovereign over tribal members and tribal land, under ''United States v. Mazurie'' (1975).

In ''[[Duro v. Reina]]'', {{ussc|495|676|1990}}, the Supreme Court held that a tribal court does not have criminal jurisdiction over a non-member Indian, but that tribes "also possess their traditional and undisputed power to exclude persons who they deem to be undesirable from tribal lands. ... Tribal law enforcement authorities have the power if necessary, to eject them. Where jurisdiction to try and punish an offender rests outside the tribe, tribal officers may exercise their power to detain and transport him to the proper authorities." In response to this decision, Congress passed the '''Duro'' Fix', which recognizes the power of tribes to exercise criminal jurisdiction within their reservations over all Indians, including non-members. The ''Duro'' Fix was upheld by the Supreme Court in ''[[United States v. Lara]]'', {{ussc|541|193|2004}}.

=== Tribal courts ===
&lt;!--[[Tribal court]] redirects here. Please change the redirect target if this section title is modified.--&gt;
At the dawn of the 21st Century, the powers of tribal courts across the United States varied, depending on whether the tribe was in a [[Public Law 280]] state (Alaska, California, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oregon, and Wisconsin) or not. Tribal courts maintain much criminal jurisdiction over their members, and because of the ''Duro'' Fix, over non-member Indians regarding crime on tribal land. The ''[[Indian Civil Rights Act]]'', however, limits tribal punishment to one year in jail and a $5,000 fine.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. McCarthy, Civil Rights in Tribal Courts; The Indian Bill of Rights at 30 Years, 34 IDAHO LAW REVIEW 465 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; Tribal Courts have no criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians. In PL280 states, the state has been granted criminal and civil adjudicatory jurisdiction over activities in Indian Country. In non-PL280 states, Indian on Indian crime in Indian Country may be prosecuted in federal court if the crime is one of those listed in the ''[[Major Crimes Act]]'' (18 USC §1153). Indian on non-Indian crime in Indian Country will be prosecuted in federal court, either from the ''MCA'', or the ''Indian Country Crimes Act'' (§1152) (unless the Indian was punished by the tribe). Non-Indian on Indian crime in Indian Country will be prosecuted in federal court using ''ICCA''. Non-Indian on non-Indian crime in Indian Country will be prosecuted by the state.

While tribal nations do not enjoy direct access to U.S. courts to bring cases against individual states, as sovereign nations they do enjoy [[Sovereign immunity in the United States#Tribal sovereign immunity|immunity]] against many lawsuits,&lt;ref name=SCPueblo&gt;''[[Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez]]'', {{ussc|436|49|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; unless a plaintiff is granted a waiver by the tribe or by congressional abrogation.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Citizen Band of Potawatomi Tribe of Okla.]]'', {{ussc|498|505|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sovereignty extends to tribal enterprises&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Local IV-302 Int'l Woodworkers Union of Am. v.

Tribal and pueblo governments today launch far-reaching economic ventures, operate growing law enforcement agencies and adopt codes to govern conduct within their jurisdiction but the United States retains control over the scope of tribal law making. Laws adopted by Native American governments must also pass the [[Secretarial Review]] of the Department of Interior through the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

===Nation to nation: tribes and the federal government===
When the United States government formed, it replaced the British government as the other sovereignty coexisting in America with the American Indians.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Michael D. and Perdue, Theda. The Cherokee Nation and the Trail of Tears. p87. Viking, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. constitution specifically mentions American Indians three times. Article I, section 2, clause 3 and the fourteenth amendment section 2 address the handling of "Indians not taxed" in the apportionment of the seats of the House of Representatives according to population and in so doing suggest that Indians need not ''be'' taxed. In Article I section 8, clause 3, Congress is empowered to "regulate commerce with foreign nations…states…and with the Indian tribes." Technically, Congress has no more power over Indian nations than it does over individual states. In the 1970s [[Native American self-determination]] replaced [[Indian termination policy]] as the official United States policy towards Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Charles. Blood Struggle: The Rise of Modern Indian Nations. p 189. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Self-determination]] promoted the ability of tribes to self-govern and make decisions concerning their people. It has been argued that American Indian matters should be handled through the [[United States Secretary of State]], the official responsible for foreign policy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} However, in dealing with Indian policy, a separate agency, the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] has been in place since 1824.

The idea that tribes have an inherent right to govern themselves is at the foundation of their constitutional status — the power is not delegated by congressional acts. Congress can, however, limit tribal sovereignty. Unless a treaty or federal statute removes a power, however, the tribe is assumed to possess it.&lt;ref&gt;Light, Steven Andrew, and Kathryn R.L. Rand. Indian Gaming and Tribal Sovereignty: The Casino Compromise. University Press of Kansas, 2005.  (19)&lt;/ref&gt; Current federal policy in the [[United States]] recognizes this sovereignty and stresses the government-to-government relations between [[Washington, D.C.]] and the [[American Indians in the United States|American Indian]] [[tribe]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2004/09/20040923-4.html|title=Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies|website=georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most Indian land is held in trust by the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Some tribal lands, most commonly in Oklahoma, are held by the tribe according to the original patent deed and thus are not trust property.&lt;/ref&gt; and federal law still regulates the political and economic rights of tribal governments. Tribal jurisdiction over persons and things within tribal borders are often at issue. While tribal criminal jurisdiction over Indians is reasonably well settled, Tribes are still striving to achieve criminal jurisdiction over non-Indian persons who commit crimes in Indian Country. This is mostly due to the Supreme Court's ruling in 1978 in ''[[Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe]]'' that tribes lack the inherent authority to arrest, try and convict non-Indians who commit crimes on their lands (see below for additional discussion on this point.)

===Tribal state relations: sovereign within a sovereign===
[[File:Otoe Tribal Seal.jpg|thumb|right|Otoe Tribal Seal]]
Another dispute over American Indian government is its sovereignty versus that of the states. The federal U.S. government has always been the government that makes treaties with Indian tribes – not individual states. Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution states that "Congress shall have the power to regulate Commerce with foreign nations and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes".&lt;ref name=Policy-Center/&gt; This determined that Indian tribes were separate from the federal or state governments and that the states did not have power to regulate commerce with the tribes, much less regulate the tribes. The states and tribal nations have clashed over many issues such as [[Indian gaming]], fishing, and hunting. American Indians believed that they had treaties between their ancestors and the United States government, protecting their right to fish, while non-Indians believed the states were responsible for regulating commercial and sports fishing.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Charles. Blood Struggle: The Rise of Modern Indian Nations. p151. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case ''[[Menominee Tribe v. United States]]'' in 1968, it was ruled that "the establishment of a reservation by treaty, statute or agreement includes an implied right of Indians to hunt and fish on that reservation free of regulation by the state".&lt;ref&gt;Canby Jr., William C. American Indian Law. p449. St. Paul, MN: West Group 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; States have tried to extend their power over the tribes in many other instances, but federal government ruling has continuously ruled in favor of tribal sovereignty. A seminal court case was ''[[Worcester v. Georgia]]''. Chief Justice Marshall found that "England had treated the tribes as sovereign and negotiated treaties of alliance with them. The United States followed suit, thus continuing the practice of recognizing tribal sovereignty. When the United States assumed the role of protector of the tribes, it neither denied nor destroyed their sovereignty."&lt;ref&gt;Green, Michael D. and Perdue, Theda.  However, England ceased to exist as a sovereign entity in 1707 to be replaced by Great Britain. Chief Justice Marshall's incorrect use of terminology appears to weaken the argument. The Cherokee Nation and the Trail of Tears. Viking, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; As determined in the Supreme Court case ''[[United States v. Nice]]'' (1916),&lt;ref&gt;Lemont, Eric D. American Indian Constitutional Reform and the Rebuilding of Native Nations. University of Texas Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. citizens are subject to all U.S. laws even if they also have tribal citizenship.

'''[[United Nations Security Council Resolution]] 2004''' was unanimously adopted on 30 August 2011.

== Resolution ==
In the wake of attacks against the [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon]] (UNIFIL), the Security Council extended its mandate for one year, until 31 August 2012, and condemned all terrorist attacks against it in the strongest terms.

The resolution was unanimously adopted, and the Security Council urged all parties concerned to respect the cessation of hostilities, prevent any violation of the Blue Line and cooperate fully with UNIFIL. The resolution called for the rapid finalization of Lebanon’s investigation into the 27 May and 26 July attacks on the Force so as to bring the perpetrators to justice, and urged all parties to abide scrupulously by their obligation to respect the safety of UNIFIL and other United Nations personnel.

Furthermore, the Council urged Israel to expedite the withdrawal of its army from northern Ghajar without further delay, in coordination with UNIFIL.  It called for further cooperation between the Force and the Lebanese Armed Forces, particularly in terms of adjacent patrols, and requested the Secretary-General to conduct a strategic review by year’s end to ensure UNIFIL was configured most appropriately to fulfil its mandate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/sc10373.doc.htm Security Council Authorizes One-Year Mandate Extension for United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon in Wake of Attacks on Peacekeepers]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Winton Train''' was a private [[passenger train]] that travelled from the [[Czech Republic]] to [[Great Britain]] in September 2009 in tribute to the wartime efforts of [[Nicholas Winton|Sir Nicholas Winton]], described as the 'British [[Oskar Schindler|Schindler]]' for his part in saving refugee children from [[Czechoslovakia]].

As a result of Sir Nicholas' efforts in the months leading up to the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939, a total of seven locomotives transported 669 Czechoslovak children of mainly Jewish heritage from Prague to safety in Great Britain.&lt;ref name= 60Minutes&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Simon, Bob (Correspondent) |date=27 April 2014 |series= 60 Minutes |title=Saving the Children |medium=Television Production Transcript |language=English |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/saving-the-children-on-eve-of-world-war-11-60-minutes/ |access-date=19 May 2016 |publisher= CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir Nicholas' [[kindertransport]] efforts remained largely unrecognised until 1988, when they came to public attention after his wife found a scrapbook in their attic documenting the details. Only then did the individuals whom Winton arranged to have transported to safety as children learn the story of how they survived the Holocaust. As the majority of 'Winton's Children' (as they came to be known) were Jewish, it is believed this saved them from [[The Holocaust|certain death]] had they stayed in Czechoslovakia. As of 2009, the direct descendants of Winton's Children numbered over 5000 people.

The 2009 tribute Winton Train carried some of the individuals Sir Nicholas arranged to have transported to safety in 1939, along with their families, as it retraced the original kindertransport route taken by the trains on which they rode as children to safety in Great Britain 70 years earlier. The Winton Train departed on 1 September 2009, the 70th anniversary of the eighth, and intended last, train arranged by Winton to carry children to safety but was prevented from doing so due to the outbreak of World War II on that very day.&lt;ref name=60Minutes /&gt; It departed from [[Praha hlavní nádraží|Prague Main railway station]] and travelled through [[Germany]] and the [[Netherlands]]. After a transfer by ferry to [[Harwich]], the journey resumed by train again to arrive in London's [[Liverpool Street station]] on 4 September, where it was met by the 100-year-old Sir Nicholas himself. For the journey across mainland Europe, the train was formed of period carriages and was hauled by historically authentic [[steam locomotives]], while the British leg was hauled by [[LNER Peppercorn Class A1 60163 Tornado|60163 ''Tornado'']], a brand-new, main-line British steam locomotive completed in 2008, along with carriages that were constructed in the 1950s.

The tribute train was the centrepiece of a wider cultural awareness project known as 'Inspiration by Goodness', organised by the [[Czech government]].

==Background==

===Original Winton trains===
Between March and September 1939, the months leading up to the outbreak of [[World War II]], [[Nicholas Winton]], a 29-year-old [[Christian]] [[United Kingdom|British]] [[stockbroker]] whose parents were of German Jewish descent,&lt;ref name=Telegraph4Sep09/&gt;&lt;ref name=AP4Sep09/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCRetracing31Aug09/&gt; organised eight trains to transport mainly [[Jewish]] Czech and Slovak refugee children from Czechoslovakia to homes in [[United Kingdom|Britain]].&lt;ref name=BBCRetracing31Aug09/&gt; The Winton trains were part of a wider British rescue effort from various other countries across Europe, known as the [[Kindertransport]]s.

[[File:Wintons Prague memorial by Flor Kent - 1.jpg|thumb|right|A statue of [[Nicholas Winton|Sir Nicholas Winton]] by [[Flor Kent]], unveiled in [[Praha hlavní nádraží|Prague Main railway station]] on 1 September 2009, the day of departure of the Winton tribute train. The girl is modelled on the granddaughter of a girl saved by one of Winton's original trains in 1939.&lt;ref name=CeskeNoviny1Sep09/&gt;]]
In 1939, Winton cancelled a trip to a Swiss holiday resort to go to Prague, having heard of a growing refugee crisis resulting from the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]] from a friend. His friend was working in the [[List of diplomatic missions of the United Kingdom|British embassy]] for the British Committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia, which was already working to help adults escape from [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref name=AP4Sep09/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCRetracing31Aug09/&gt; When Winton learned that refugee children could not leave unless accompanied, he decided to arrange their evacuation to Britain.&lt;ref name=BBCRetracing31Aug09/&gt; While the Winton evacuations later became known by the collective label of the children's [[Kindertransport]]s, which were officially being organised elsewhere in other countries, no official Kindertransports had been arranged in Prague at that time.&lt;ref name=BBCRetracing31Aug09/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCEvacueesThankSaviour4Sep09/&gt;

Winton organised the transfer of the children from the Nazi-appointed [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] to homes in Britain, in the process arranging the necessary bonds and permits for their departure, and finding the families in Britain who would receive the children.&lt;ref name=CeskeNoviny1Sep09/&gt; Winton and a team identified those children most at risk from the thousands of refugees driven south following the Nazi invasion of the [[Sudetenland]].&lt;ref name=BBCEvacueesThankSaviour4Sep09/&gt; For each child to be accepted, British officials required a confirmed [[Foster care|foster home]] and a [[£]]50 guarantee.&lt;ref name=AP4Sep09/&gt; Winton returned to Great Britain in March to arrange the reception of the children, but his task was hampered by the fact that the [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|domestic evacuation of children]] was already occurring, and places were hard to find.

Beginning in March, Winton organised eight trains, which in total transported 669 mainly Jewish children from Nazi occupied Czechoslovakia to Great Britain.&lt;ref name=BBCRetracing31Aug09/&gt;&lt;ref name=A1TrustWintonTrain/&gt;&lt;ref name=WintonIntro2Feb09/&gt; A ninth and final train with 250 children on board was stopped at the last minute, due to the outbreak of the war.&lt;ref name=BBCRetracing31Aug09&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8227929.stm |title=Retracing a life-saving journey |date=2009-08-31 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=2009-09-02 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jUsiRWPm?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8227929.stm |archivedate=2009-09-02 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two children on this ninth aborted train survived the war.&lt;ref name=AP4Sep09/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://arafp.homestead.com/wherearetheynow.html Tom Berman - September 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/50623/gissing.pdf;jsessionid=682ADBDE391D60277FF11F0AAB3F6E80?sequence=4 Vera Gissing Interview]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Channel 4 News]] reporting on the 2009 Winton Train, "Sir Nicholas has said many times that the vision that haunts him most is the families waiting at Liverpool Street for the train that never arrived".&lt;ref name=C4News4Sep09&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/uk/winton+train+arrives+in+london/3331402 |title=Winton train arrives in London |date=2009-09-04 |publisher=[[Channel 4 News]] |accessdate=2009-09-05 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jZ6fQ4U5?url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/uk/winton%20train%20arrives%20in%20london/3331402 |archivedate=2009-09-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winton's efforts did not come to public light until 1988, when his wife discovered papers in their loft, whereupon Winton began to publicly talk about his work, and he came to be known as the 'British Schindler', in comparison to [[Oskar Schindler]].&lt;ref name=TelegraphProfile2Sep09&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/world-war-2/6125995/Nicholas-Winton-English-Schindler-Profile.html |title=Nicholas Winton, 'English Schindler': Profile |date=2009-09-02 |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |accessdate=2009-09-02 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jUx2UzBp?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/world-war-2/6125995/Nicholas-Winton-English-Schindler-Profile.html |archivedate=2009-09-02 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir Nicholas himself believed this was undeserved, because unlike Schindler, his life had never been in danger.&lt;ref name=Telegraph4Sep09&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/world-war-2/6138441/Sir-Nicholas-Winton-the-British-Schindler-meets-the-Holocaust-survivors-he-helped-save.html |title=Sir Nicholas Winton, the 'British Schindler', meets the Holocaust survivors he helped save |author=Stephen Adams |date=2009-09-04 |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |accessdate=2009-09-05 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jZD6aD6e?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/world-war-2/6138441/Sir-Nicholas-Winton-the-British-Schindler-meets-the-Holocaust-survivors-he-helped-save.html |archivedate=2009-09-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AP4Sep09/&gt;

===Inspiration by Goodness project===
[[File:Nicholas Winton in Prague.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nicholas Winton|Sir Nicholas Winton]] in Prague, October 2007]]
A project to run a train in tribute to the original Winton trains was announced on 21 January 2008 as the ''Train Prague – London'' project, and the organisers were negotiating to have the train named after Sir Nicholas.&lt;ref name=WintonAbout2Feb09&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wintontrain.eu/en/site/o-projektu/op-projekt-winton-train.htm |title=Winton Train Project |date=n.d. |publisher=The Winton Train project |work=Official website, About the Project |accessdate=2009-09-02 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jUfMtfPw?url=http://www.wintontrain.eu/en/site/o-projektu/op-projekt-winton-train.htm |archivedate=2009-09-02 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The train was run by [[Czech Railways]] and sponsored by the [[Czech government]], with the project being dedicated to their holding of the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union]] from January to June 2009.&lt;ref name=A1TrustWintonTrain/&gt; The train was part of a wider project encompassing social and cultural events along the route to "inspire young people through the deeds of Nicholas Winton", and with the theme of "Inspiration by Goodness", it incorporated art, film, photographic and literary contests by university students and school children.&lt;ref name=WintonAbout2Feb09/&gt;

The project was to follow on from the work of documentary film maker [[Matej Mináč]] about Sir Nicholas, including his new film project ''Nicky's Family''.&lt;ref name=WintonAbout2Feb09/&gt; While travelling on the train, Mináč filmed scenes for a new version of the Winton story.&lt;ref name=BBCEvacueesThankSaviour4Sep09&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8237231.stm |title=Czech evacuees thank their saviour |date=2009-09-04 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=2009-09-05 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jZN4oZOc?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8237231.stm |archivedate=2009-09-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Senate of the Czech Republic|Czech Senate]] President [[Přemysl Sobotka]] said of the project that it "should warn against rising extremism and anti-Semitism in Europe and in the world".&lt;ref name=CeskeNoviny1Sep09/&gt;

The motive power for the train journey was provided by six different [[steam locomotives]] in total, two as a [[Double-heading|double-headed]] train in the [[Czech Republic]] due to the terrain, two in [[Germany]], one in the [[Netherlands]] and one in [[Great Britain]]. The entire journey was scheduled to take four days, involving a European train leg, a crossing by the passengers on a ferry and a British train leg. It covered a distance of {{convert|1296|km|mi}}, of which {{convert|1139|km|mi}} was the train journey across [[mainland Europe]].&lt;ref name=WintonTrainLog2Sep09&gt;{{cite web |url=http://palubnidenik.wintontrain.eu/en/historical-train/ |title=Historical Train |date=n.d. |publisher=The Winton Train project |work=Official website, Train's Log |accessdate=2009-09-02 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jUl4Aevl?url=http://palubnidenik.wintontrain.eu/en/historical-train/ |archivedate=2009-09-02 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The special transport was organised by the Autofest Organisation on behalf of the [[Bohemia Transport Muzeum]] with special help from the [[London Bus Preservation Trust]] and the Newman family of [[Ensign Buses]].
