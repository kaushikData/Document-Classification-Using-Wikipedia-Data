'''BeHealth''' is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[eHealth]] digital platform which provides digital access to all health information and applications through one portal site, on behalf of both [[healthcare]] [[health care provider|provider]]s and [[patient]]s. BeHealth has been created on 23 December 2004. It first aim is to interconnect multiple applications from a number of [[social security]] actors, but with the goal to provide broader services over time.

{{refimprove|date=June 2015}}
A '''bidet shower''' ('''bum gun''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Asian Thai Bidet Toilet Spray Sprayer Shower Rinse Hygiene Bum Gun Complete Kit |url=https://www.amazon.com/Toilet-Sprayer-Shower-Hygiene-Complete/dp/B00BKXBH3K |website=Amazon |accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''bidet spray''', '''bidet sprayer''', or '''health faucet'''), is a hand-held triggered nozzle that is placed near the [[toilet]] and delivers a spray of water used for [[anal cleansing]] and cleaning of the [[genitals]] after using the toilet for [[defecation]] and [[urination]]. The device is similar to that on a kitchen sink sprayer.

== Description ==
The health faucet is a source of water for people who prefer using water rather than other methods of cleansing after defecation or urination. The shower is an alternative for the traditional sources of water for this action, such as the [[bidet]], copper pot or bucket and mug, being more hygienic and compact. There is no contact between the spray of water and the used water drainage.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Usage ==
The user typically grasps the faucet in the right hand and uses the thumb or forefinger (depending on the trigger location) to aim a spray of water at the anus or genitals to assist cleansing after using the [[toilet]].

==Prevalence==
{{Further|Anal cleansing}}
The bidet shower is common in all predominantly Islamic countries and in most parts of Asia where water is considered essential for [[anal cleansing]]. This includes [[Egypt]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]] (called 'Muslim shower'), [[China]], [[Iran]], [[India]], [[Maldives]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Turkey]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]],  [[Philippines]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Thailand]], [[Singapore]],  [[Vietnam]] and [[Cambodia]]. In those countries it is commonly installed in Western-style (sitting) toilet installations. In [[Thailand]], it is common in both Western-style toilets and [[squat toilet]] installations. The bidet shower is similar in intent, if not method of use, to the Japanese [[washlet]]-style toilet seats, or so-called "[[electronic bidet]]s".

Bidet showers are used by Muslims in [[Muslim countries]] and all parts of the [[Arab world]] as well as in Asia in order to cleanse themselves with water after using the toilet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/army/arabculture.pdf|title=Arab Cultural Awareness:58 Factsheets|date=January 2006|work=TRADOC DCSINT Handbook No. 2|publisher=[[Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence]], [[United States Army Training and Doctrine Command]]|location=[[Fort Leavenworth]], [[Kansas]], [[United States]]|page=16|quote="When served a beverage, accept with the RIGHT HAND ONLY!

In [[Europe]], the bidet shower is used for example in [[Finland]] and [[Estonia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.biginfinland.com/hose-always-next-every-finnish-toilet/ "Bidets in Finland"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bidet]]s are more common bathroom fixtures in many [[Southern Europe|southern European countries]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5226">In [[physiology|bone physiology]], '''the C-terminal telopeptide''' (or more formally, '''carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks''', and known by the [[acronym]] '''CTX''') is a [[wikt:telopeptide|telopeptide]] that can be used as a [[biomarker (medicine)|biomarker]] in the [[serum (blood)|serum]] to measure the rate of [[bone remodeling|bone turnover]]. It can be useful in assisting clinicians to determine a patient's nonsurgical treatment response as well as evaluate a patient's risk of developing complications during healing following surgical intervention.&lt;ref name="MarxCTX"&gt;Marx, RE, et al. &lt;u&gt;Oral Bisphosphonate-Induced Osteonecrosis: Risk Factors, Prediction of Risk Using Serum CTX Testing, Prevention, and Treatment&lt;/u&gt;, ''J Oral Maxillofac Surg'' 2007;65:2397-2410&lt;/ref&gt;  The test used to detect the CTX marker is called the Serum CrossLaps, and it is more specific to [[bone resorption]] than any other test currently available.&lt;ref name="ROSEN"&gt;Rosen, HN, et al. &lt;u&gt;Serum CTX. A new marker of bone resorption that shows treatment effect more often than other markers because of low coefficient of variability and large changes with bisphosphonate therapy&lt;/u&gt;. ''Calcif Tissue Int'' 2000;66:100&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw==
{{Main|Bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw}}
In the early 2000s, a link between [[bisphosphonate]] use and impaired bone physiology was noted.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, RE, et al. &lt;u&gt;Pamidronate (Aredia) and zoledronate (Zometa) induced avascular necrosis of the jaws: A growing epidemic&lt;/u&gt;. ''J Oral Maxillofac Surg'' 2003;61:1115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruggerio, SL, et al. &lt;u&gt;Osteonecrosis of the jaws associated with the use of bisphosphonates: A review of 63 cases&lt;/u&gt;. ''J Oral Maxillofac Surg'' 2004;62:527&lt;/ref&gt;  The strong inhibition of [[osteoclast]] function precipitated by bisphosphonate therapy can lead to inhibition of normal bone turnover, leading to impaired wound healing following trauma (such as dental surgery) or even spontaneous non-healing bone exposure.  Because bisphosphonates are preferentially deposited in bone with high turnover rates, it is possible that the levels of bisphosphonate within the jaw bones are selectively elevated.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggiero, SL. &lt;u&gt;Bisphosphonate-related Osteonecrosis of the Jaws&lt;/u&gt;. ''Compendium'' 2008;29'''(2)''':97–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk determination==
With the advent of implant dentistry, more dental patients are undergoing therapies in the oral cavity that involve bone healing, such as surgical implant placement and bone grafting procedures.  In order to evaluate the risk of osteonecrosis for a patient taking bisphosphonates, use of the CTX biomarker was introduced in 2000 by Rosen.&lt;ref name="ROSEN"/&gt;

==Use of the CTX biomarker==
Although a number of [[surrogate endpoint|surrogate biomarkers]] exist for measuring the metabolic products of bone resorption, the serum CTX marker was chosen because it is both highly correlated to bone turnover rate and already available for detection in a laboratory test carried out by a major lab testing corporation.&lt;ref name="MarxCTX"/&gt;

The CTX test measures for the presence and concentration of a crosslink [[peptide]] sequence of [[Type-I collagen|type I collagen]], found, among other tissues, in bone.  This specific peptide sequence relates to bone turnover because it is the portion that is cleaved by [[osteoclast]]s during bone resorption, and its serum levels are therefore proportional to osteoclastic activity at the time the blood sample is drawn.&lt;ref name="MarxCTX"/&gt;  Serum levels in healthy patients not taking bisphosphonates tends to hover above 300 [[Kilogram#SI_multiples|pg]]/mL.

{{quotation|"Even though laboratory normal ranges are said to be between 50 pg/mL and 450 pg/mL, this normal range is not accurate related to the [[osteoporosis]] population. Actual normal values are usually well over 300 pg/mL and are most commonly 400 pg/mL to 550 pg/mL in patients not taking bisphosphonates. Lower values represent varying degrees of suppression of normal bone turnover, sometimes also called [[bone remodeling]] or bone renewal."&lt;ref name="MarxCTX"/&gt;}}

Patients who are placed on a 6-month [[drug holiday]] exhibit marked improvements in their serum CTX values; in one study, patients showed an improvement of 155.3 pg/mL over 6 months or a rate of 25.9 pg/mL each month.&lt;ref name="MarxCTX"/&gt;

Initially, urinary CTX levels were sought, but this proved to offer no greater value than urinary [[N-terminal telopeptide|NTX]] values—both tests suffered from large spontaneous fluctuations unrelated to therapy or intervention, and were therefore largely unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;Ju, H, et al. &lt;u&gt;Comparison
of analytical performance and biological variability of three bone resorption assays&lt;/u&gt;. ''Clin Chem'' 1997;43:1570–1576&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, the [[monoclonal antibody]] test for detecting serum CTX levels features minimal spontaneous disruption yet remarkable change to antiresorptive therapy, making the serum CTX assay both highly [[sensitivity and specificity|sensitive and specific]].&lt;ref name="ROSEN"/&gt;

'''Deaths in Singapore''' offset the population increase from live births. In 2007, 17,140 people in [[Singapore]] [[death|died]] from various causes. The [[death rate]] was 4.5 deaths per 1,000 of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Key annual indicators|url=http://www.singstat.gov.sg/stats/keyind.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221030353/http://www.singstat.gov.sg/stats/keyind.html|archivedate=21 February 2009|publisher=Singapore Department of Statistics|date=26 September 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are strict regulations surrounding death and treatment of the body after death.

==Legal definition of death==
Under section 2A of the Interpretation Act,&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Interpretation Act|cap=1|ed=2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a person is considered as having died when there is either irreversible cessation of [[circulatory system|circulation of blood]] and [[respiratory system|respiration]], or total and irreversible cessation of all functions of the [[brain]].&lt;ref&gt;Interpretation Act, s. 2A(1).&lt;/ref&gt; Irreversible cessation of the blood circulation and respiration is determined according to ordinary standards of current medical practice,&lt;ref&gt;Interpretation Act, s. 2A(2).&lt;/ref&gt; while [[brain death|total and irreversible cessation of all brain functions]] is made in accordance with the following criteria:&lt;ref&gt;Interpretation Act, s. 2A(3).&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Conditions to be satisfied before determining irreversible cessation of all brain functions'''. Before tests are carried out to determine if all the functions of a person's brain have irreversibly ceased, the following conditions must be satisfied:
**the person's condition must undoubtedly be due to irremediable structural [[brain damage]] and the [[diagnosis]] of any disorder which can lead to the irreversible cessation of all functions of the person's brain must be fully established;
**there must be no suspicion that the person's condition is due to [[depressant|depressant drugs]], [[hypothermia]] or [[metabolism|metabolic]] and [[endocrine system|endocrine]] factors; and
**the person's cessation of spontaneous respiration is not caused by [[neuromuscular-blocking drug|neuromuscular blocking agents]] or other drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Interpretation (Determination and Certification of Death) Regulations|url=http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;ident=e3c7f456-5adc-4fec-a6d8-59fdeba22902;page=0;query=DocId%3A64645ecb-2c5f-4772-921c-def093905e46%20Depth%3A0%20Status%3Ainforce;rec=0|cap=1|sltype=Rg|no=1|ed=2000}}, reg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Criteria for determining irreversible cessation of all brain functions'''. To determine the irreversible cessation of all functions of the brain of a person, tests must be carried out with the result that:
**the [[pupil]]s are fixed and non-reactive to strong light;
**there is no [[corneal reflex]];
**there is no spontaneous [[motor system|motor response]] to painful [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]], excluding [[tendon reflex|spinal reflexes]];
**there is no [[vestibulo-ocular reflex|oculocephalic reflex]];
**there is no [[pharyngeal reflex|gag reflex]] or reflex response to [[tracheobronchial tree|tracheobronchial]] stimulation;
**there is no [[vestibulo-ocular reflex|vestibulo-ocular response]] on instillation of 50 cc of ice-cold water into each ear; and
**there is no spontaneous respiration even with [[carbon dioxide]] tension at 50&amp;nbsp;mm or more of mercury.&lt;ref&gt;Interpretation (Determination and Certification of Death) Regulations, reg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
:Where there is still a corneal reflex or spontaneous motor response to painful stimulus but all other criteria are satisfied, or where any of the criteria cannot be performed but the remaining criteria are satisfied, the irreversible cessation of all brain functions can be determined by a combination of the criteria that have been satisfied and the performance of a supplementary test.&lt;ref&gt;Interpretation (Determination and Certification of Death) Regulations, reg. 3A.&lt;/ref&gt; These tests are [[cerebrum|cerebral]] [[angiography]] to confirm that there is no intra[[Human cranium|cranial]] blood flow, and a [[radionuclide cisternogram|radionuclide scan]] to confirm that there is no intracranial [[perfusion]].&lt;ref&gt;Interpretation (Determination and Certification of Death) Regulations, First Schedule.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the Interpretation Act sets out other safeguards for the determination of death:

*'''Cases where organ to be removed for transplant'''. Where an [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] is to be removed for a [[organ transplant|transplant]] pursuant to the Human Organ Transplant Act&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Human Organ Transplant Act|cap=131A|ed=2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Medical (Therapy, Education and Research) Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Medical (Therapy, Education and Research) Act|cap=175|ed=1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt; from the body of a deceased person, the death must be certified by two medical practitioners:
**who have not been involved in the care or treatment of the person;
**who do not belong to the team of medical practitioners which will remove the organ from the body;
**who have not been involved in selecting the proposed recipient of the organ; and
**who will not be involved in the care or treatment of the proposed recipient during his or her hospitalization for the transplant.&lt;ref&gt;Interpretation Act, ss. 2A(5) and (6).&lt;/ref&gt;
:Where the death was due to total and irreversible cessation of all brain functions, the two medical practitioners certifying the death must also possess certain prescribed postgraduate medical qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;Interpretation Act, s. 2A(6)(e).&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Other cases'''. In other cases, the determination of the total and irreversible cessation of all brain functions of a person must be certified by two medical practitioners who possess the prescribed postgraduate medical qualifications. At least one of them must not have been involved in the care or treatment of the deceased person.&lt;ref&gt;Interpretation Act, s. 2A(4).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presumption of death of missing persons===
When the question of whether a person is alive or dead arises, and it is shown that he was alive within 30 years, the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proving]] that he or she is dead lies on the person who affirms it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Evidence Act|cap=97|ed=1997}}, s. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; However, if it is proved that he or she has not been heard of for seven years by those who would naturally have heard of the person if he or she had been alive, the burden of proving that the person is alive shifts to the person who affirms this.&lt;ref&gt;Evidence Act, s. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Any married person who alleges that reasonable grounds exist for supposing that the other party to the marriage is dead may apply to court to have it presumed that the other party is dead and to have the marriage dissolved. If the court is satisfied that such reasonable grounds exist, it may make an interim judgment of presumption of death and of divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Women's Charter|cap=353|ed=1997}}, s. 100(1).&lt;/ref&gt; In such proceedings, the fact that for seven years or more the other party to the marriage has been continually absent from the applicant, and the applicant has no reason to believe that the other party has been living within that time, is evidence that the missing person is dead until the contrary is proved.&lt;ref&gt;Women's Charter, s. 100(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes of death==

The number of judicial executions has fluctuated widely depending on crime rates; at its highest point, according to unofficial statistics compiled by [[Amnesty International]], about 408 people were hanged between 1991 and 2003;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Singapore: The death penalty – A hidden toll of executions|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ASA36/001/2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301002406/http://amnesty.org/en/library/info/ASA36/001/2004|archivedate=1 March 2009|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]|date=15 January 2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; at its lowest point in 2010, none were executed.&lt;ref name="Prisons Annual Report Singapore"&gt;{{citation|title=Prisons Annual Report Singapore |url=http://www.prisons.gov.sg/content/dam/sps/publications/Prisons_annual_2011_part4.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=[[Singapore Prison Service]] |year=2011 |accessdate=19 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415161103/http://www.prisons.gov.sg/content/dam/sps/publications/Prisons_annual_2011_part4.pdf |archivedate=15 April 2012 |df=dmy }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2004 and 2011, the number of executions varied between none and 10.&lt;ref name="Written Answer to Parliamentary Question on Judicial Executions From 2004 to 2010, 21 October 2011"&gt;{{citation|title=Written Answer to Parliamentary Question on Judicial Executions from 2004 to 2010, 21 October 2011|url=http://www.mha.gov.sg/news_details.aspx?nid=MjE0Nw%3D%3D-occ0vMiT7bI%3D|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605173439/http://www.mha.gov.sg/news_details.aspx?nid=MjE0Nw%3D%3D-occ0vMiT7bI%3D|archivedate=5 June 2013|publisher=[[Parliament of Singapore]]|date=21 October 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hanging]], which is used for all executions and are carried out in [[Changi Prison]] on Fridays at dawn, are by the long drop method, which severs the spinal cord.&lt;ref name="How does death by hanging work?"&gt;{{citation|author=Julia Layton|title=How does death by hanging work?|url=http://health.howstuffworks.com/diseases-conditions/death-dying/death-by-hanging.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140927153331/http://health.howstuffworks.com/diseases-conditions/death-dying/death-by-hanging.htm|archivedate=27 September 2014|publisher=[[HowStuffWorks]]|date=4 January 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suicide===
[[Suicide]] is a significant non-medical cause of death in Singapore. Although attempted suicide is an offence punishable with jail under section 309 of the [[Penal Code (Singapore)|Penal Code]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Penal Code|cap=224|ed=2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore still sees many cases of suicide each year. Between 2000 and 2004, 1,700 people killed themselves,&lt;ref name=Nation&gt;{{citation|title=Singapore now a suicide capital|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/12/national/national_20002541.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306021929/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/12/national/national_20002541.php|archivedate=6 March 2012|newspaper=[[The Nation (Thailand)|The Nation]] (reproduced from [[The Straits Times]])|date=13 March 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2007 suicides amounted to about 2.2% of all deaths.&lt;ref&gt;According to table 3.9 (deaths by group of causes) of {{citation|chapter=Demography|url=http://www.singstat.gov.sg/pubn/reference/yos/statsT-demography.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306030823/http://www.singstat.gov.sg/pubn/reference/yos/statsT-demography.pdf|archivedate=6 March 2009|title=Yearbook of Statistics Singapore, 2008|publisher=Singapore Department of Statistics|year=2008}}, out of the total number of 17,140 deaths in Singapore, 374 were due to suicide.&lt;/ref&gt; For every successful suicide attempt, there were seven unsuccessful ones.&lt;ref name=Nation/&gt;

It was reported in 2006 that suicide was one of the top causes of death of Singapore youths.&lt;ref name=Nation/&gt; In 2001, five children younger than 15 years took their lives, and 37 people between the ages of 15 and 25 did so.&lt;ref name="Think Centre"&gt;{{citation|title=Singapore: When children commit suicide|url=http://www.thinkcentre.org/article.cfm?ArticleID=2646|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141002030524/http://www.thinkcentre.org/article.cfm?ArticleID=2646|archivedate=2 October 2014|publisher=The Think Centre|date=14 September 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The coroner's report of a [[junior college]] student who killed himself because he believed his penis was too small was reported in the international media.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, {{citation |title="Small" penis drives teenager to suicide |url=http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=126&amp;art_id=qw1145412720913R131 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060421150950/http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=126&amp;art_id=qw1145412720913R131 |archivedate=21 April 2006 |newspaper=[[Independent News &amp; Media#South Africa|Independent Online]] |date=19 April 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}; {{citation |title=Man kills self over genital size |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/7242_1679402,00180021.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422163920/http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/7242_1679402%2C00180021.htm |archivedate=22 April 2006 |newspaper=[[Hindustan Times]] |date=20 April 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The pressure exerted by parents on their children to produce good academic results has also been a contributing factor in some suicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Amy Tan|title=Girl's suicide highlights Singapore school stress|url=http://www.sfdonline.org/Link%20Pages/Link%20Folders/01Pf/reut290801.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030619021655/http://www.sfdonline.org/Link%20Pages/Link%20Folders/01Pf/reut290801.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 June 2003|publisher=[[Reuters]] (reproduced on the Singaporeans for Democracy website)|date=29 August 2001|df=dmy-all}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent notable examples of young adults that commit suicide include Cpt (Dr) Allan Ooi Seng Teik, who ended his life on 3 March 2009 presumably due to disenchantment working with the [[Singapore Armed Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lim|first1=Darius|title=MINDEF's Forum Letter on CPT (Dr) Allan Ooi|url=http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/press_room/official_releases/nr/2009/mar/20mar09_nr3.html#.VueQmY9OIeQ|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chan|first1=Crystal|title=He was stylish, well-connected|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/The%2BNew%2BPaper/Story/A1Story20090308-126975.html|accessdate=15 March 2016|publisher=The New Paper}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Letter from the family of the late Dr Allan Ooi|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20090331-132179.html|accessdate=15 March 2016|publisher=AsiaOne|date=31 Mar 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment of the body after death==
When a person dies, a doctor will certify the cause of death if it is known and due to [[death by natural causes|natural causes]]. He or she will then fill up a certificate of cause of death (CCOD) which will be given to the family of the deceased. If the doctor is unable to determine the cause of death, or the death is due to non-natural causes, the Criminal Procedure Code requires him to refer the case to the [[Singapore Police Force|police]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Criminal Procedure Code|cap=68|ed=1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The police will provide a [[hearse]] to send the body to the [[Centre for Forensic Medicine]] (CFM) [[Mortuary]] at Block 9 of the [[Singapore General Hospital]], which will then inform the family when to visit the mortuary.&lt;ref name="NEA What to Do"&gt;{{citation|title=What to Do when a Death Occurs?|url=http://www.nea.gov.sg/passesaway/when.htm|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20090226220455/http://www.nea.gov.sg/passesaway/when.htm|archivedate=26 February 2009|publisher=[[National Environment Agency]]|year=2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the CFM Mortuary, the family will view and identify the body of the deceased in the presence of a [[coroner]], who reviews the case and determines if an [[autopsy]] is required. The family will be informed of the coroner's decision and the time to claim the body for the funeral. If an autopsy is conducted and reveals that the death is unnatural, the police will conduct further investigations into the cause of death with the family's assistance. Once the investigations are complete, the family will be told to attend a coroner's inquiry at the [[Subordinate Courts of Singapore|Subordinate Courts]]. Only after that will they be able to claim the body.&lt;ref name="NEA What to Do"/&gt;

After the family obtains the CCOD, they usually engage a [[funeral director]] (also known as an undertaker) who collects the body, [[embalming|embalms]] it if necessary, and delivers it to the [[wake (ceremony)|wake]]. In addition, they have to decide whether the body is to be [[cremation|cremated]] or [[burial|buried]], and register the death.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Register Death|url=http://www.ica.gov.sg/page.aspx?pageid=146&amp;secid=143|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216003906/http://ica.gov.sg/page.aspx?pageid=146&amp;secid=143|archivedate=16 February 2009|publisher=[[Immigration and Checkpoints Authority]]|date=12 May 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The funeral director also helps to make arrangements for the wake and [[funeral]], according to the religious beliefs and wishes of the family.&lt;ref name="NEA Arranging a Funeral"&gt;{{citation|title=Arranging a Funeral|url=http://www.nea.gov.sg/passesaway/arrange.htm|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20090226232723/http://www.nea.gov.sg/passesaway/arrange.htm|archivedate=26 February 2009|publisher=National Environment Agency|year=2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Registration of death===
When a person dies in a house, the death must be notified to the authorities within 24 hours by the occupier of the house in which to his or her knowledge the death took place, the relatives of the deceased present at his or her death or in attendance during the last illness of the deceased, or each person present at the death. If those persons fail to do so, another inmate of the house or the person causing the body of the deceased person to be buried.&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Registration of Births and Deaths Act|cap=267|ed=1985}}, s. 15(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

When a person dies in a place which is not a house, or a dead body is found elsewhere than in a house, every relative of the deceased person having knowledge of any particulars required to be registered concerning the death, and every person present at the death, and every person taking charge of the body, and, if the death occurs in a ship or vessel the master or other person having charge of the ship or vessel, and the person causing the body to be buried must, within 24 hours after the death or finding of the body, give to the authorities such information that the informant has concerning the death that is required to be registered.&lt;ref&gt;Registration of Births and Deaths Act, s. 15(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burial===
[[File:Choa Chu Kang Chinese Cemetery, Singapore - 20090913.jpg|thumb|A view of [[Choa Chu Kang Cemetery|Choa Chu Kang Chinese Cemetery]]. The Choa Chu Kang Cemetery Complex is the only cemetery in Singapore still accepting burials.]]

The [[Choa Chu Kang Cemetery|Choa Chu Kang Cemetery Complex]] is the only cemetery in Singapore still accepting burials. Others, such as [[Bidadari Cemetery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Alexa Olesen|title=Singapore clears graves for apartments|url=http://www.sfdonline.org/Link%20Pages/Link%20Folders/02Pf/ap120502.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021224022334/http://www.sfdonline.org/Link%20Pages/Link%20Folders/02Pf/ap120502.html|archivedate=24 December 2002|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=12 May 2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; have made way for redevelopment. Burials cost up to [[Singapore dollar|S$]]420 for children and $940 for adults. The complex is divided into cemeteries according to religion, and includes the [[Parsi people|Parsi]], [[Jew]]ish and [[Christian]] cemeteries.

On 1 November 1998, the NEA implemented a policy to limit the burial period of all graves to 15 years, due to a shortage of space in the cemeteries. After being buried for 15 years, graves are exhumed and the remains removed. If the religion of the deceased permits cremation, the exhumed remains are cremated and stored in government columbaria niches; otherwise, the remains are re-buried in smaller individual plots.&lt;ref name="NEA Burial"/&gt;

====Sea Burial====

Sea burial is being implemented at Tanah Merah by the end of 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New sea burial facility to be built in Tanah Merah|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/new-sea-burial-facility-to-be-built-in-tanah-merah|accessdate=6 April 2018|work=The Straits Times|date=5 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cremation===

====History====
In the days of British rule, the number of Chinese burial grounds in Singapore increased very rapidly and the colonial government had little power to control burial spaces because it did not possess sanctions of sufficient strength. Clan associations met all the physical and social needs of the Chinese majority, and the result was the creation of segmented Chinese immigrant communities separated by kinship ties and operating independently of the state, each conducting their own death rites and running their own cemeteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Tan Boon Hui|author2=Brenda S. A. Yeoh|title=The 'Remains of the Dead': Spatial Politics of Nation-Building in Post-War Singapore|url=http://www.humanecologyreview.org/pastissues/her91/91tanyeoh.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216075118/http://www.humanecologyreview.org/pastissues/her91/91tanyeoh.pdf|archivedate=16 February 2010|journal=Human Ecology Review|year=2002|volume=9|issue=1|pages=1–13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The local authorities began to view these cemeteries as hazardous sources of disease-causing vectors such as mosquitoes,&lt;ref&gt;''Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report'' (20 March 1975).&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a form of land waste. There were urgent demands on space in land-scarce Singapore in the name of national development. In the words of [[E. W. Barker]], then the minister for law, environment, science and technology, "The needs of Singapore's young population must require the use of sterilised land, for the economic and social good of all citizens of Singapore."&lt;ref&gt;''Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report'' (7 April 1978).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1965 Master Plan, which was designed to guide land-use development in Singapore, cemeteries were identified as land "considered available for development",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Singapore Planning Department, Technical Paper No. 48|location=Singapore|publisher=Government Printing Office|year=1967}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and cremation was mooted as a viable option to deal with the exhumed bodies from these burial grounds, and as a way to dispose of people who died. To encourage the population to adopt this relatively new way of treating the dead, the state employed the help of "funerary middlemen" who could erode the distrust of cremation because they were respected for their knowledge of death rites and disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Brenda S. A. Yeoh|chapter=The Body After Death: Place, Tradition and the Nation-State in Singapore|editor=Elizabeth K[enworthy] Teather|title=Embodied Geographies: Spaces, Bodies and Rites of Passage|location=London|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1999|pages=240–255|isbn=978-0-415-18439-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the rallying cries of national development, the common good, and the country's future were used to encourage the populace to take up the idea of cremation and to abandon their insistence of traditional burial grounds.

In 1972, the state made it clear that it would close all cemeteries near and around the city area to "conserve land".&lt;ref&gt;Addendum to Presidential Address, ''Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report'' (20 July 1972).&lt;/ref&gt; State power over cemeteries was considerably strengthened by an alteration in the law allowing the public commissioner to "close cemeteries without assigning reasons for doing so".&lt;ref&gt;''Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report'' (3 November 1972).&lt;/ref&gt; As an alternative means of managing the disposal of the dead, the state offered burial space at a state-owned [[Choa Chu Kang Cemetery|public cemetery complex at Choa Chu Kang]], although it made it clear that it considered cremation as the only viable long-term option. As various academics have pointed out, the clearance of ethnic burial grounds served more than a practical purpose as it signified the transferring of power from clan- and ethnic-based associations, which had previously run these burial grounds, to state organizations.&lt;ref name="Yeoh &amp; Kong"&gt;{{citation|author=Brenda S. A.

====Development and evolution of crematoria and columbaria====
[[File:Garden of remembrance arch headstone.jpg|thumb|right|220px|An elaborate tombstone from the [[Bidadari Cemetery|Bidadari Christian Cemetery]] preserved at the Garden of Remembrance, a private [[columbarium]]. With the limit of 15 years for burial, such memorials are becoming rare in Singapore.]]
[[File:Garden of Remembrance.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The Garden of Remembrance is a private columbarium in Singapore.]]

The earliest government crematorium, situated at [[Mount Vernon, Singapore|Mount Vernon]], began operations in 1962 with only one funeral service hall and about four cremations a week. By 1995, it had three service halls and was averaging 21 cremations a day, with operations beginning every day at 9:00 am with cremations scheduled at 45-minute intervals until about 6:00 or 7:00 pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=E. J. Taliford|title=A Guide to Mount Vernon Complex|location=Singapore|publisher=Environmental Health Department, [[Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources|Ministry of the Environment]]|year=1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The site includes a columbarium built in several phases, comprising niches arranged in numbered blocks which either feature Chinese-style green roofs, or housed within a nine-storey [[pagoda]]-style building. There also exists a two-storey "church-style" building.

Towards the end of the 1970s, the Mount Vernon complex, which was initially intended for the storage of ashes from recent deaths, could no longer cope with the scale of exhumation projects fuelling the demand for columbarium niches. Another crematorium and columbarium complex was built at [[Mandai]], and this commenced operations in 1982, equipped with eight small and four medium-sized cremators and a total of 64,370 niches for the storage of cremated remains.&lt;ref name="Yeoh &amp; Kong"/&gt; Chinese voluntary associations such as Pek San Theng were allowed to build columbaria to house the remains of those exhumed from clan-owned cemeteries,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Pek San Theng Special Publication|location=Singapore|year=1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and temples and churches were allowed to accommodate cremated remains. Mount Vernon Crematorium ceased operations on 30 June 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=New crematorium and columbarium facilities at Mandai, 40-year-old Mount Vernon Crematorium closes on 30 June|url=http://app2.nea.gov.sg/news_detail_2004.aspx?news_sid=20081015201981672276|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308184832/http://app2.nea.gov.sg/news_detail_2004.aspx?news_sid=20081015201981672276|archivedate=8 March 2012|publisher=National Environment Agency|date=27 May 2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Present====
After a body is cremated, the family of the deceased can store the ashes at home or in a [[columbarium]], or scatter them in the sea about {{convert|1.5|nmi|km mi|lk=on}} south of [[Pulau Semakau]].&lt;ref name="NEA Arranging a Funeral"/&gt; There are three crematoria in Singapore. The Mandai Crematorium, the only government facility, is now operated by the [[National Environment Agency]]. The other two crematoria are privately operated; one is in the [[Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Temple|Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery]] at Bright Hill Drive, [[Bishan, Singapore|Bishan]], and the other is in Tse Toh Aum Temple at Sin Ming Drive.&lt;ref name="NEA Burial"&gt;{{citation|title=Burial, Cremation &amp; Ash Storage|url=http://www.nea.gov.sg/passesaway/burial.htm|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20060505221539/http://www.nea.gov.sg/passesaway/burial.htm|archivedate=5 May 2006|publisher=National Environment Agency|year=2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three government columbaria and 57 private ones. The government-operated columbaria are at Mandai, [[Yishun]] and [[Choa Chu Kang]]. (A fourth government columbarium at Mount Vernon is due to close at an unspecified date due to redevelopment of its surrounding area into a public housing estate.)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Management of Government-owned Cemetery, Crematoria and Columbaria|url=http://app.nea.gov.sg/cms/htdocs/article.asp?pid=2318|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505181746/http://app.nea.gov.sg/cms/htdocs/article.asp?pid=2318|archivedate=5 May 2007|publisher=National Environment Agency|year=2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Private columbaria are operated by the [[Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery]], the Roman Catholic [[Church of St Mary of the Angels|Church of Saint Mary of the Angels]] in [[Bukit Batok]], and the [[Singapore Soka Association]], among others. As with crematoria, there is a significant price difference between niches in private and government columbaria. A standard niche in any government columbarium costs less than $900, but one at the Kong Meng San monastery costs more than $15,000. The government columbaria allocate niches sequentially, and charge an extra $250 for any location change request;&lt;ref name="NEA Burial"/&gt; for an extra price, the private columbaria allow families to choose niche locations subject to availability, and even to pre-book niches before death.

There has been an increase in the number of Singaporeans pre-booking niches at private crematoria, even though some people consider talking about death and pre-booking a final resting place inauspicious. Reasons for pre-booking include wanting one's ashes to be close to those of loved ones, and hedging against higher prices for niches in future.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Hazel Yong|title=Finding their niche in life for death|publisher=The Straits Times|date=7 May 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The bodies of foreigners (regardless of where they die) can be cremated in Singapore, but their ashes have to be placed in private columbaria.&lt;ref name="NEA What to Do"/&gt; There are also irregular instances of Singaporeans dying overseas, such as the 2015 accident surrounding [[Huang Lin Davina]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hoe|first1=Pei Shan|title=Hopes fade for Singaporean in US snowboarding accident|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/more-singapore-stories/story/hopes-fade-singaporean-us-snowboarding-accident-20150226|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a high-profile demise of a Singaporean abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Grim prognosis for Singaporean in snowboarding accident |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/grim-diagnosis-for/1681928.html |accessdate=29 April 2015 |date=26 Feb 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502083238/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/grim-diagnosis-for/1681928.html |archivedate=2 May 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Huang Lin Davina|url=https://www.facebook.com/huang.lin.davina|website=Facebook|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hoe|first1=Pei Shan|title=Singaporean dies after US snowboarding accident|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/singaporean-dies-after-us-snowboarding-accident|accessdate=29 April 2015|publisher=The Straits Times|date=13 Mar 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been observed that the architecture of government columbaria reflects the outlook of the Singaporean nation. The early columbaria were simple, with few aesthetic ornaments, just like early Singaporean housing flats. The later columbaria have more modern designs, with well-designed landscaped environments, and looking similar to contemporary HDB (Housing and Development Board) flats. These columbaria include the Chua Chu Kang Columbarium and the Mandai Columbarium, which was renovated and expanded in 2004 to accommodate approximately another 60,000 niches.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Government-managed Columbaria|url=http://app.nea.gov.sg/cms/htdocs/article.asp?pid=2093#cckc|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006113213/http://app.nea.gov.sg/cms/htdocs/article.asp?pid=2093|archivedate=6 October 2006|publisher=National Environment Agency|year=2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The designs are more elaborate, and are often reminiscent of other structures people often encounter in everyday life. Comparisons have been drawn between the architecture of these columbaria and that of schools and condominiums,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Eugene Siong Aun Lee|title=The Columbarium Landscape: Public Housing for the Dead in Singapore [unpublished dissertation]|location=Singapore|publisher=Department of Geography, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, [[National University of Singapore]]|year=2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and hypotheses have been made that such are deliberate efforts to eliminate the sense of fear and dread traditionally associated with landscapes of death.

'''Dewshine''' is a term coined for the non-commercial mixture of the beverage [[Mountain Dew]] with alcohol, notably [[methanol]]. Methanol is toxic to humans, and in January 2016 the mixture resulted in the reported deaths of two Tennessee high school students, Logan Stephenson and J. D. Byram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tennessee Teens Die After Drinking Mountain Dew/Racing Fuel Cocktail|url=http://www.people.com/article/dewshine-mountain-dew-racing-fuel-mix-second-death-tennessee}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methanol in this case was believed to come from racing fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health Buzz: Dewshine – a Mix of Mountain Dew and Racing Fuel – Proves Deadly|url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-wellness/articles/2016-01-28/dewshine-a-mix-of-mountain-dew-and-racing-fuel-proves-deadly-in-tennessee}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Racing fuel mixed with soda suspected in Tennessee teens' deaths|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/27/health/tennessee-teenagers-die-dewshine/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6175">The term '''dilution assay''' is generally used to designate a special type of [[bioassay]] in which one or more preparations (e.g. a drug) are administered to experimental units   at different dose levels inducing a measurable biological response. The dose levels are prepared by dilution in a diluent that is inert in respect of the response. The   experimental units can for example be cell-cultures, tissues, organs or living animals. The biological response may be quantal (e.g. positive/negative) or quantitative (e.g.   growth). The goal is to relate the response to the dose, usually by [[interpolation]] techniques, and in many cases to express the potency/activity of the test preparation(s)   relative to a standard of known potency/activity.

Dilution assays can be direct or indirect. In a '''direct dilution assay''' the amount of dose needed to produce a specific (fixed) response is measured, so that the dose is a   stochastic variable defining the '''tolerance distribution'''. Conversely, in an '''indirect dilution assay''' the dose levels are administered at fixed dose levels, so that the   response is a stochastic variable.

==Statistical models==
For a mathematical definition of a dilution assay an observation space &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is defined and a function &lt;math&gt;f:U\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; so that the responses   &lt;math&gt;u\in U&lt;/math&gt; are mapped to the set of real numbers. It is now assumed that a function &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; exists which relates the dose &lt;math&gt;z\in[0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; to the   response
:&lt;math&gt;f(u)=F(z)+e&lt;/math&gt;
in which &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is an error term with expectation 0. &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is usually assumed to be [[continuous function|continuous]] and [[monotone function|monotone]]. In situations where a standard preparation is included it is furthermore assumed that the test preparation   &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; behaves like a dilution (or concentration) of the standard &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_{T}(z)=F_{S}(\rho z)&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\rho&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is the relative potency of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. This is the fundamental assumption of similarity of dose-response curves which is necessary for a meaningful   and unambiguous definition of the relative potency. In many cases it is convenient to apply a power transformation &lt;math&gt;x=z^{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\lambda&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; or a   logarithmic transformation &lt;math&gt;x=\log (z)&lt;/math&gt;. The latter can be shown to be a limit case of &lt;math&gt;\lambda\downarrow0&lt;/math&gt; so if &lt;math&gt;\lambda=0&lt;/math&gt; is written for the   log transformation the above equation can be redefined as
:&lt;math&gt;F_{T}(x)=F_{S}(\rho^{\lambda}x)&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

Estimates &lt;math&gt;\hat F&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; are usually restricted to be member of a well-defined [[parametric family of functions]], for example the family of [[linear function]]s characterized by an intercept and a slope. Statistical techniques such as optimization by [[Maximum Likelihood]] can be used to calculate estimates of the parameters. Of notable importance in this respect is the theory of [[generalized linear models|Generalized Linear Models]] with which a wide range of dilution assays can be modelled. Estimates of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; may describe &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; satisfactorily over the range of doses tested, but they do not necessarily have to describe &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; beyond that range. However, this does not mean that dissimilar curves can be restricted to an interval where they happen to be similar.

In practice, &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; itself is rarely of interest. More of interest is an estimate of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; or an estimate of the dose that induces a specific response. These   estimates involve taking ratios of statistically dependent parameter estimates. [[Fieller's theorem]] can be used to compute confidence intervals of these ratios.

Some special cases deserve particular mention because of their widespread use: If &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is linear and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; this is known as a '''slope-ratio model'''. If   &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is linear and &lt;math&gt;\lambda=0&lt;/math&gt; this is known as a '''parallel line model'''. Another commonly applied model is the [[probit model]] where &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is   the cumulative [[normal distribution]] function, &lt;math&gt;\lambda=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; follows a [[binomial distribution]].

==Example: Microbiological assay of antibiotics==

[[image:DilutionAssay.png|Parallel line assay]]

An [[antibiotic]] standard (shown in red) and test preparation (shown in blue) are applied at three dose levels to sensitive [[microorganism]]s on a layer of [[agar]] in [[petri dish]]es. The  stronger the  dose the larger the zone of inhibition of growth of the microorganisms. The biological response &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is in this case the zone of inhibition and the  diameter of this  zone &lt;math&gt;f(u)&lt;/math&gt; can be used as the measurable response. The doses &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; are transformed to logarithms &lt;math&gt;x=\log (z)&lt;/math&gt; and the method of  least squares is  used to fit two parallel lines to the data. The horizontal distance &lt;math&gt;\log (\hat\rho)&lt;/math&gt; between the two lines (shown in green) serves as an estimate of the  potency  &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; of the test preparation relative to the standard.

==Software==

The major statistical software packages do not cover dilution assays although a statistician should not have difficulties to write suitable scripts or macros to that end. Several special purpose software packages for dilution assays exist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4136">One way of attributing [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions is to measure the '''embedded emissions''' of goods that are being consumed (also referred to as "embodied emissions"). This is different from the question of to what extent the policies of one country to reduce emissions affect emissions in other countries (the "spillover effect" and "[[carbon leakage]]" of an emissions reduction policy). The [[UNFCCC]] measures emissions according to production, rather than consumption (UK Parliament, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2010-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, embedded emissions on imported goods are attributed to the exporting, rather than the importing, country. The question of whether to measure emissions on production instead of consumption is partly an issue of equity, i.e., who is responsible for emissions (Toth ''et al''., 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;670).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The 37 [[Kyoto Protocol]] Parties, listed in Annex B of the treaty, have agreed to legally binding emission reduction commitments. Under the [[UNFCCC]] accounting of emissions, their emission reduction commitments do not include emissions attributable to their imports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2010-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their study, they suggested that nearly a quarter of China's CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions might be a result of its production of goods for export, primarily to the USA but also to Europe. Based on this, they suggested that international negotiations based on within country emissions (i.e., emissions measured by production) may be "[missing] the point."

Recent research confirms that, in 2004, 23% of global emissions were embedded in goods traded internationally, mostly flowing from China and other developing countries to the U.S., Europe and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2-11-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research by the Carbon Trust in 2011 revealed that approximately 25% of all {{CO2}} emissions from human activities 'flow' (i.e. are imported or exported) from one country to another.  The flow of carbon was found to be roughly 50% emissions associated with trade in commodities such as steel, cement, and chemicals, and 50% in semi-finished/finished products such as motor vehicles, clothing or industrial machinery and equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbontrust.com/resources/reports/advice/international-carbon-flows|title=International Carbon Flows| publisher =Carbon Trust|date=May 2011|accessdate=12 Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All transplant clinics, [[tissue-typing laboratory|tissue-typing laboratories]], and hospitals in the member countries where [[organ donation]]s take place are included in the exchange. Eurotransplant helps coordinate work in these institutions, with the goal of efficiently allocating and distributing donated organs. The group also promotes research into transplantation and seeks to raise public awareness of the benefits of donation.{{cn|date=October 2014}}

Comparable institutions are [[Scandiatransplant]] in Iceland, Norway, Finland, Denmark, and Sweden; as well as [[Balttransplant]] in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3753">[[File:Crosswalk of Market at Third, San Francisco.jpg|thumb|Pedestrian crosswalk]]
The '''fear of crossing streets''', or its terms '''dromophobia''' and '''agyrophobia''', is a [[specific phobia]] that affects a person's ability to cross a street or roadway, especially [[Pedestrian crossing|designated crosswalks]] where many cars or vehicles may be present. The term '''dromophobia''' comes from the Greek ''dromos'', meaning [[racetrack]].

==Causes of dromophobia==
Dromophobia may result from experiencing a [[road accident]] and thus may be classified as a subtype of [[panic disorder]] with [[agoraphobia]] (PDA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Page |first =  Andrew |title = Distinguishing Panic Disorder and Agoraphobia from Social Phobia |journal = Journal of Nervous &amp; Mental Disease |year = 1994 |volume = 182 |issue = 11 |pages = }}{{page needed|date=February 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt; As such, dromophobia, especially fear of crossing streets alone may be a component of accident-related [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], as a reaction to a situation  reminding the past traumatic event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first = Klaus |last = Kuch |title = A Brief Self-Rating Scale for PTSD After Road Vehicle Accident |journal = Journal of Anxiety Disorders |volume = 9 |issue = 6 |date= November–December 1995 |pages = 503–514 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1 = Jane M. |last1 = Keppel-Benson |first2 = Thomas H. |last2 = Ollendick |first3 = Mark J. |last3 = Benson |title = Post-Traumatic Stress in Children Following Motor Vehicle Accidents |journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry |volume = 43 |issue = 2 |date = February 2002 |pages = 203–212 |doi  = 10.1111/1469-7610.00013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes this behavior may be misinterpreted during PTSD symptom assessment as a caution (i.e., a normal learning behavior) rather than fear (which is an abnormal avoidant behavior). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first = Michael S. |last = Scheeringa |title = PTSD in Children Younger than the Age of 13 |journal = Journal of Child &amp; Adolescent Trauma |volume = 4 |year = 2011 |issue = 3 |pages = 181-197 |doi = 10.1080/19361521.2011.597079 }} Also in: {{cite book |title = Assessment of Trauma in Youths |year = 2016 |isbn = 1134905963 |url = https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=sgcfDAAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA23 |pages = 21–36 |via = Google Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fear of crossing streets may also result from an [[anticipatory anxiety]] related to person's limited mobility due to [[stiff person syndrome]] (SPS). In fact a person with SPS crossing a street may develop attacks of increasing [[stiffness]] or [[spasm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1 = Ana Claudia |last1 = Rodrigues de Cerqueira |first2 = José Marcelo |last2 = Ferreira Becerra |first3 = Márcia |last3 = Rozentha |first4 = Antônio |last4 = Emídio Nardi |title = Stiff-Person Syndrome and Generalized Anxiety Disorder |journal = Arquivos de Neuro-Psiquiatria |volume = 68 |issue = 4 |pages = |date = August 2010 |doi = 10.1590/S0004-282X2010000400036 }}{{page needed|date= February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dromophobia may be present in people, especially children, with [[autism]], since crossing a road involves complex skills, such as judging the speed of an approaching car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first = Dorothy |last = Strickland |title = A Virtual Reality Application with Autistic Children |journal = Presence |publisher = MIT Press Journals |year = 1996 |volume =  5 |issue = 3 |pages = 319-329 |doi = 10.1162/pres.1996.5.3.319 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Georges Hébert''' (27 April 1875 – 2 August 1957) was a pioneering [[physical education|physical educator]] in the [[France|French]] military who developed a system of physical education and training known as "la méthode naturelle" ("Natural Method"), which combined the training of a wide variety of physical capacities with the training of courage and morality.

==Early life==
[[File:Saint-Pierre (Martinique) avec Montage Pelée.JPG|thumb|left|180px|Saint-Pierre, Island of Martinique, with [[Mount Pelée]] in the background]]

[[File:Pelee 1902 3.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The remains of St Pierre after the 1902 eruption]]

Hébert was born in [[Paris]]. While an officer in the French Navy prior to the [[First World War]], Hébert was stationed in the town of [[Saint-Pierre, Martinique|St. Pierre]], on the island of [[Martinique]] in the Caribbean Sea.  In 1902 the town fell victim to a catastrophic volcanic eruption.

Hébert coordinated the escape and rescue of some seven hundred people from this disaster. This experience had a profound effect on him, and reinforced his belief that [[athletic skill]] must be combined with courage and [[altruism]]. He eventually developed this ethos into his personal motto, "Être fort pour être utile" ("Being strong to be useful").

Hébert had travelled extensively throughout the world and was impressed by the physical development and movement skills of indigenous peoples in [[Africa]] and elsewhere:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Their bodies were splendid, flexible, nimble, skillful, enduring, resistant and yet they had no other tutor in gymnastics but their lives in nature.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Development of his system==
Upon his return to [[France]], Hébert became a physical instructor for the French marines in [[Lorient]], where he began to define the principles of his own system of physical education and to create apparatus and exercises to teach his "Natural Method".

Beyond his observations of the natural movements of indigenous people,  Hébert's method is a synthesis of various influences,&lt;ref&gt; Angel 2016, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; including but not limited to:

*The work of his predecessor [[Francisco Amorós y Ondeano|Francisco Amorós]], who published in 1847 ''Nouveau Manuel Complet d'Education Physique, Gymnastique et Morale'' and which encompasses already the full range of practical movement aptitudes
*The work of German Prussian gymnastics educator [[Friedrich Ludwig Jahn]] (August 11, 1778 – October 15, 1852), which has also probably influenced the early physical training of the [[United States Marine Corps]]
*The classical representations of the human body in Graeco-Roman statuary and by the ideals of the ancient Greek gymnasia
*The [[naturist]] (although strictly rejecting complete nudism) lifestyle principles of his friend Dr. Paul Carton (1875–1947)
*The influence of [[Georges Demenÿ]] (1850–1917), a French inventor, chronophotographer, filmmaker, and gymnast who emphasized the progressiveness and the scalability of the training

Hebert's system rejected [[remedial gymnastics]] and the popular [[Swedish Method]] of [[physical culture]], which seemed to him unable to develop the human body harmoniously and especially unable to prepare his students with the practical and moral demands of life.

[[File:Eakins history of a jump 1885.jpg|thumb|Photo: "history of a jump" 1885]]

In the same way, Hébert believed, by concentrating on competition and performance, competitive sport diverted physical education both from its physiological ends and its ability to foster sound moral values.

For Georges Hébert, influenced by the teachings of philosopher and educationalist [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], only the observation of nature could lead people to the true methods of physical development. He wrote:{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;The final goal of physical education is to make strong beings. In the purely physical sense, the Natural Method promotes the qualities of organic resistance, muscularity and speed, towards being able to walk, run, jump, move on all fours, to climb, to keep balance, to throw, lift, defend yourself and to swim.&lt;br /&gt;
In the "virile" or energetic sense, the system consists in having sufficient energy, willpower, courage, coolness, and firmness.&lt;br /&gt;
In the moral sense, education, by elevating the emotions, directs or maintains the moral drive in a useful and beneficial way.&lt;br /&gt;
The true Natural Method, in its broadest sense, must be considered as the result of these three particular forces; it is a physical, virile and moral synthesis. It resides not only in the muscles and the breath, but above all in the "energy" which is used, the will which directs it and the feeling which guides it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hébert defined the guiding principles and fundamental rules of the Natural Method as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;With regard to the development of virile qualities, this is obtained by the execution of certain difficult or dangerous exercises requiring the development of these various qualities, for example while seeking to control the fear of falling, of jumping, of rising, of plunging, of walking on an unstable surface, etc.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Legacy and influence==

[[File:1-10-13, Reims, collège d'athlètes, Bouin lieutenant Hébert.jpg|thumb|(1913) Reims, France; Collège d'athlètes. Hébert is standing to the left. The man to the right is [[Jean Bouin]], the French mid-distance Olympic runner, who died at age 25 while fighting in the French army during the opening weeks of World War 1, in the year 1914.]]
[[File:Collège d'athlètes et agrès.jpg|thumb|Collège d'athlètes ("Athletes' College") was a physical education training center opened in the city of Reims, in north-east France, in 1913.  The center was designed according to the principles of Georges Hébert. The training center was destroyed during World War 1.&lt;ref&gt;Angel 2016, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Jean Bouin 1913 - Collège d'athlètes.jpg|thumb| (1913) Reims, France; Collège d'athlètes. The swimming pool, located to the side of the large indoor training facility.]]

Georges Hébert's teaching continued to expand between and during the two wars, becoming the standard system of French military physical education.

He was also an early advocate of the benefits of exercise for women. In his work "Muscle and Plastic Beauty", which appeared in 1921, Hébert criticized not only the fashion of [[corsetry]] but also the physical inactivity imposed upon women by contemporary European society. By following the natural method of synthesized physical, energetic and moral development, he wrote, women could develop self-confidence, will-power and athletic ability just as well as their male counterparts.

Hébert wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |title=Georges Hébert - la methode naturelle 
 |url=http://perso.orange.fr/le.parkour/france/medias/page3.html 
 |publisher=INSEP - Musée de la Marine 
 |language=French 
 |accessdate=2007-09-22 
 |deadurl=yes 
 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718150740/http://perso.orange.fr/le.parkour/france/medias/page3.html 
 |archivedate=2006-07-18 
 |df= 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A (Natural Method) session is composed of exercises belonging to the ten fundamental groups: walking, running, jumping, quadrupedal movement, climbing, equilibrium (balancing), throwing, lifting, defending and swimming.&lt;br /&gt;
A training session consists, then, of exercises in an outdoor environment, perhaps a few hundred meters to several kilometers, during which, one walks, one runs, one jumps, one progresses quadrupedally, one climbs, one walks in unstable balance, one raises and one carries, one throws, one fights and one swims.

This course can be carried out in two ways:
#the natural or spontaneous way; i.e., on an unspecified route through the countryside.
#within an especially designed environment.

All of the exercises can be carried out while progressing through this environment. A session can last from 20 to 60 minutes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, Hébert was among the earliest proponents of ''le parcours'', or [[obstacle course]], form of [[physical training]], which is now standard in the military and has led to the development of civilian [[fitness trail]]s and [[confidence courses]]. In fact, woodland challenge courses comprising balance beams, ladders, rope swings and so-on are often still described as "Hebertism" or "Hebertisme" courses both in Europe and in North America. It may even be possible to trace modern [[adventure playground equipment]] back to Hébert's original designs in the early 1900s.

As a former [[sailor]], Hébert may have patterned some of his "stations" on the obstacles that are found on the deck of a ship; he was also a strong proponent of "natural" or spontaneous training in non-designed environments.

The year 1955 marked the 50th birthday of the Natural Method, and Hébert was named Commander of the [[Légion d'honneur|Legion of Honor]] by the French government in recognition of his many services to his country. In 1957, George Hébert, by then suffering from general [[paralysis]], cultivated the admiration of his entourage by relearning how to walk, speak and write. He died on August 2 of that year in [[Tourgéville]], [[Calvados (department)|Calvados]], France.

There are still schools and gymnasia throughout Europe that are promoting the Natural Method of physical training, some maintaining their own elaborate "parcours" in natural surroundings.

Most recently, Hébert's teachings have been an important influence on the emergence of [[Parkour]] as a training discipline in its own right. Also, in the first decade of the 21st century, the French American physical education instructor [[Erwan Le Corre]] took inspiration from Hébert's "méthode naturelle" ("natural method") and has expanded on the training to form a system of natural movement which he has named "MovNat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.outsideonline.com/1896516/workout-time-forgot |title=The Workout Time Forgot |publisher=Outside Online |access-date=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angel 2016, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ghana Health Service''' ('''GHS''') is a Ghanaian government body established in 1996 as part of the Health Sector Reform of Ghana. The Health Service is under the [[Ministry of Health (Ghana)|Ministry of Health]]. The Health service primarily administrates the health services provided by the government and in implementing government policies on healthcare.&lt;ref name="Ghana Health Service"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.ghanahealthservice.org/aboutus.php?inf=Background|work=Ghana Health Service webpage|publisher=Ghana Health Service|accessdate=5 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723012704/http://www.ghanahealthservice.org/aboutus.php?inf=Background|archivedate=23 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Ghana Health Service (GHS) is a Public Service body established under Act 525 of 1996 as required by the 1992 constitution.&lt;ref name="Ghana Health Service"/&gt; It is an autonomous Executive Agency responsible for implementation of national policies under the control of the Ghana Minister for Health through its governing Council - the Ghana Health Service Council.&lt;ref name="Ghana Health Service"/&gt;

The GHS continue to receive public funds and thus remain within the public sector.&lt;ref name="Ghana Health Service"/&gt;  However, its employees are no longer part of the civil service, and GHS managers are no longer required to follow all civil service rules and procedures.&lt;ref name="Ghana Health Service"/&gt; The independence of the GHS is designed primarily to ensure that staffs have a greater degree of managerial flexibility to carry out their responsibilities then would be possible if they remained wholly within the civil service.

Ghana Health Service does not include Teaching Hospitals, Private and Mission Hospitals.&lt;ref name="Ghana Health Service"/&gt; The establishment of the Ghana Health Service was an essential part of the key strategies identified in the Ghana Health Sector Reform process, as outlined in the Medium Term Health Strategy (MTHS), which were necessary steps in establishing a more equitable, efficient, accessible and responsive health care system.&lt;ref name="Ghana Health Service"/&gt;

The reforms build on the reorganization of the MOH that began in 1993, was explicitly designed to set the scene for the establishment of the Ghana Health Service.&lt;ref name="Ghana Health Service"/&gt;  The reforms also provide a sound organizational framework for the growing degree of managerial responsibility that has already been delegated to districts and hospitals.&lt;ref name="Ghana Health Service"/&gt; Themes that were central to the reorganization of 1993 remain important today for the Ghana Health Service: careful stewardship of resources, clear lines of responsibility and control, decentralization, and accountability for performance rather than inputs.&lt;ref name="Ghana Health Service"/&gt;

==GHS Mandate and Objectivity==
GHS to provide and prudently manage comprehensive and accessible health service with special emphasis on primary health care at Ghana regional, district and sub-district levels in accordance with approved national policies. The objects of the Service are to:

*Implement approved national policies for health delivery in Ghana.
*Increase access to good quality health services, and
*Manage prudently resources available for the provision of the health services.&lt;ref name="Ghana Health Service"/&gt;

==GHS Functions==
For the purposes of achieving its objectives the GHS performs the following functions amongst others:

Provide comprehensive health services at all levels in Ghana directly and by contracting out to other Ghana agencies. As part of this function, the GHS is:

*Develop appropriate strategies and set technical guidelines to achieve Ghana national policy goals/objectives.
*Undertake management and administration of the overall Ghana health resources within the service.
*Promote healthy mode of living and good health habits by people in Ghana.
*Establish effective mechanism for disease surveillance, prevention and control in Ghana.
*Determine charges for Ghana health services with the approval of the Ghana Minister of Health.
*Provide in-service training and continuing education in Ghana.
*Perform any other functions relevant to the promotion, protection and restoration of health in Ghana.&lt;ref name="Ghana Health Service"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10206">The [[elderly]] population is one of the most vulnerable populations in the world of health care, mainly because of their susceptibility to contracting disease, limited access to [[Health insurance|health care insurance]], limited or non-existent access to long-term care insurance, and/or reduced [[quality of life]]. In Germany, the majority of the population, including the elderly is funded by a [[Healthcare in Germany|public health care insurance system]]. Only employees who have an income above a cutoff point and certain other groups have the option of purchasing private insurance. (The option of not having any insurance coverage was dropped in 2009.) For the most part, Germany raises money for this health system through statutory welfare contributions.

== Increase in elderly population ==
As a result of [[longevity]] and low fertility rates, the elderly population (age 75 and older) in Germany has increased dramatically over the years, and is predicted to increase from 7% of the total population in the last century to over 10% by 2020.&lt;ref name="DallingerUrsula"&gt;Dallinger, Ursula. "Elderly care in the family in Germany". University of Jena, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The population in need of care is expected to increase from over a million to over 2&amp;nbsp;million people in 2020, which is about 2% of the population in Germany. 70% of the people, who are elderly and in need of care, live in private households, with a family member being the main caregiver in 80% of these households; daughters and daughters in law being the main [[caregivers]].&lt;ref name="DallingerUrsula" /&gt; The continual increase in the elderly population in Germany signifies that there will be a greater need for health care services to be provided to the elderly, notably long-term care services. This increased need places the elderly in a vulnerable position because of the potential of funds not meeting all their needs.

== Long-term care insurance ==
[[Long-term care insurance]] was established by the German welfare state in 1996 to give elderly financial resources for a caregiver. This insurance either provides care services or cash benefits to pay for a private caregiver, such as a family member. This provides families with more support from a public institution, now being responsible for financing care for the elderly, unlike formerly when the high expenses of institutional care caused most families to care for their elderly in their own households.&lt;ref name="DallingerUrsula" /&gt; With the emergence of care insurance an emergence of private home-care agencies and new residential arrangements for elderly also arose.&lt;ref&gt;Wegner, Eldon L. "Restructuring care for the elderly in Germany". Current Sociology, 2001, 49:175.&lt;/ref&gt; If a family opted for the long-term care insurance to provide care services, they could attain these services through these private agencies; otherwise, they would receive cash benefits that could be used to pay a family member or other individual for informal care services.

== Difference in Backgrounds of care service recipients ==
There are significant differences in the use of the long-term care services in Germany, depending on social position, ethnic background, and gender. Those with a higher social position most often utilize home-based services provided by private institutions, while those in a lower social position most often utilize cash benefits. Additionally, German elderly minorities are underrepresented in professionalized home-based services and residential care.&lt;ref name="HildergardTheobald"&gt;Hildergard, Theobald. "Care services for the elderly in Germany" Veröffentlichungsreihe der Arbeitsgruppe Public Health, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; This is attributed to the large number of people in informal family care and their different cultures leading to difficulties in adapting to the existing care services. There is also a discrepancy in the numbers of women and men that utilize the care services. 69% of service recipients are women, which is attributed to women constituting the majority of the elderly of over 80&amp;nbsp;years old, receiving lower [[pension]]s, and requiring more care dependency.&lt;ref name="HildergardTheobald" /&gt;

== Health care satisfaction ==
In a study conducted in 1992, [[Louis Harris]] interviewed 948 elderly people over the age of 65 from Germany in order to have a better understanding of their health care access satisfaction and quality of life. 29% of German elderly are satisfied with their health care. 54% report having fair or poor health; and 38% report having six or more physician contacts over the past six months. 6% of German elderly viewed out-of-pocket medical expenses as a serious issue, 15% viewed Germany’s system of paying for medical care as “inadequate”.&lt;ref&gt;Rowland, D. "A five-nation perspective on the elderly". Health Affairs, 1992, p.205-215.&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, a significant proportion of the elderly population are satisfied with their health care, and a very small amount view out-of-pocket medical expenses as a serious issue. Taking this into account along with the long-term care services the elderly are provided, the German elderly generally have good access to short-term and long-term care insurance.

== Increase in health care expenditures ==
Despite their current access to short-term and long-term health insurance services, it is often concluded that the increasing elderly population in Germany will have negative consequences on health care expenditures, which may threaten these services. This is further emphasized by the [[bankruptcy]] of the German health insurance fund City BKK recently declared bankruptcy due to the rising number of members and costs, which exceeded its budget from the healthcare fund.&lt;ref&gt;Steinert, Elisabeth. "German insurance bankruptcy threatens the elderly and sick". International Committee of the Fourth International, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; There appears to be a linear relationship between the increase of age and increase of health care costs. However, a study conducted by Hilke Brockmann in 2000, suggests that as a person ages, their health care expenses decrease. The study further shows that proximity to death is what increases health costs, not age itself. Furthermore, the decrease in health expenditures as a person ages can be attributed to elderly having less expensive diseases. However, when comparing medical treatment expenses of the same diseases in young and elderly people in Germany, it was discovered that elderly people are still receiving less expensive health care, which suggests that health care is being rationed in Germany based on age, rationing being illegal and potentially responsible for the elderly not receiving the best treatment possible, ultimately, decreasing their potential for survival.&lt;ref&gt;Brockmann, Hilke. "Why is less money spent on health care for the elderly than for
the rest of the population? Health care rationing in German
hospitals" Social Science and Medicine 55, 2002, p.593-608.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Depression in elderly population ==
One factor that largely contributes to the costs associated with old age is the presence of mental health issues, namely [[Mood disorder|depression]]. A study was conducted on 451 primary care patients aged 75 and older. 63 out of the 451 patients were diagnosed with depression.&lt;ref name="LuppaMelanie"&gt;Luppa, Melanie, et al. "Direct costs associated with depression in old age in Germany". Journal of Affective Disorders 105, 2008, p.195-204.&lt;/ref&gt; Depressed and non-depressed individuals had similar education levels and did not have significant differences in age and gender. It was found that 14% of depressed individuals used mental health specialist services, while 8% of non-depressed individuals used mental health specialist services were used by 2%; psychiatrists were used by 5% of the depressed elderly and 1% by the non-depressed; and psychologists were used by 2% depressed elderly and 0.5% non-depressed. Additionally, depressed elderly were admitted to hospitals for an average stay of 20.7&amp;nbsp;days while non-depressed individuals were admitted for an average of 13&amp;nbsp;days. The overall direct health care costs of depressed elderly were found to be 5422&amp;nbsp;Euros annually, and in non-depressed elderly 3624&amp;nbsp;Euros annually.&lt;ref name="LuppaMelanie" /&gt; Ultimately, it is unknown how much of the direct health care costs can be attributed to diagnosed and undiagnosed depression, but what is clear that the presence of depression in elderly affects their quality of life, which can potentially be improved if depression is recognized and treated promptly. In addition, prompt treatment of depression may reduce direct health care costs in the elderly population.&lt;ref name="LuppaMelanie" /&gt;

== Multiple chronic conditions in elderly population ==
Elderly patients with multiple chronic conditions are also associated with higher health care use and cost. Studies conducted showed that the illness level of the elderly is what directly affects health care use and costs; the illness level was measured as the number of incidences of disease.&lt;ref&gt;Lehnert, Thomas, et al. Review: Health care utilization and costs of elderly persons with multiple chronic conditions". Medical Care Research and Review, 2011, 68:387.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reduction of health care expenditures ==
In order to reduce some of the health care expenditures associated with the medical conditions of the German elderly, which is largely due to money spent on medications for mental health or chronic conditions, the German government is strictly regulating reimbursement and pricing policies of the pharmaceutical market using cost-effective analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Gunnam, Rajesh. "Healthcare, Regulatory and Reimbursement Landscape- Germany". Press Release Distribution, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This along with the implementation of other policies may reduce health care expenditures related to the elderly, reducing the threat of eliminating some of these services, and helping them have good access to short-term and long-term health care services as well as leading a good quality of life.

The online encyclopedia [[Wikipedia]] has, since the late 2000s, served as a popular source for health information for both laypersons and, in many cases, health care practitioners. Health-related articles on Wikipedia are popularly accessed as [[search engine result page|results]] from [[search engines]], which frequently deliver links to Wikipedia articles.&lt;ref name="laurent"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Laurent | first1 = M.

The [[English-language Wikipedia]] was estimated in 2014 to hold around 25,000 articles on health-related topics.&lt;ref name="around half"&gt;{{cite web |title=Around half of Wikipedia's medical editors are experts |url=https://blog.wikimedia.org/2014/12/05/around-half-of-wikipedias-medical-editors-are-experts/ |work=Wikimedia Blog |first=Nusa |last=Faric |date=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across Wikipedia encyclopedias in all languages there were 155,000 health articles using 950,000 citations to sources and which collectively received 4.8 billion pageviews in 2013.&lt;ref name="HeilmanWest2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heilman|first1=James M|last2=West|first2=Andrew G|title=Wikipedia and Medicine: Quantifying Readership, Editors, and the Significance of Natural Language|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|volume=17|issue=3|year=2015|pages=e62|issn=1438-8871|doi=10.2196/jmir.4069|pmid=25739399|pmc=4376174}}&lt;/ref&gt; This amount of traffic makes Wikipedia one of the most consulted health resources in the world, or perhaps the most consulted resource.&lt;ref name="HeilmanWest2015"/&gt;

==Amount of health content==
As of the end of 2013, the English Wikipedia had 29,072 medical articles, while across all language versions of Wikipedia, there were 155,805 medical articles.&lt;ref name="HeilmanWest2015"/&gt; As of March 2017, the English Wikipedia had 30,000 medical articles, while there were 164,000 medical articles in other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shafee |first1=Thomas |last2=Masukume |first2=Gwinyai |last3=Kipersztok |first3=Lisa |last4=Das |first4=Diptanshu |last5=Häggström |first5=Mikael |last6=Heilman |first6=James |date=November 2017 |title=Evolution of Wikipedia's medical content: past, present and future |url=http://jech.bmj.com/content/71/11/1122 |journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health |volume=71 |issue=11 |pages=1122–1129 |doi=10.1136/jech-2016-208601|pmid=28847845 |pmc=5847101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, there were about 6,000 anatomy articles on the English Wikipedia;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ledger |first1=Thomas Stephen |date=September 2017 |title=Introduction to anatomy on Wikipedia |journal=Journal of Anatomy |volume=231 |issue=3 |pages=430–432 |doi=10.1111/joa.12640|pmid=28703298 }}&lt;/ref&gt; these are not classified as "medical articles" in Wikipedia's categorization scheme and thus are not included in the 30,000 figure above.&lt;ref name="HeilmanWest2015"/&gt;

==Academic studies==

===Accuracy and usefulness===
A 2007 study examined a sample of Wikipedia pages about the most frequently performed surgical procedures in the United States, and found that 85.7% of them were appropriate for patients and that these articles had "a remarkably high level of internal validity".&lt;ref name=jacs&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Devgan|first1=Lara|last2=Powe|first2=Neil|last3=Blakey|first3=Brittony|last4=Makary|first4=Martin|title=Wiki-Surgery?

A 2008 study reported that drug information on Wikipedia "has a more narrow scope, is less complete, and has more errors of omission" than did such information on the traditionally edited online database [[Medscape Drug Reference]].&lt;ref name="clauson"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clauson|first1=K. A|last2=Polen|first2=H. H|last3=Boulos|first3=M. N K.|last4=Dzenowagis|first4=J. H|title=Scope, Completeness, and Accuracy of Drug Information in Wikipedia|journal=Annals of Pharmacotherapy|date=18 November 2008|volume=42|issue=12|pages=1814–1821|doi=10.1345/aph.1L474|pmid=19017825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 assessment of 50 medical articles on Wikipedia found that 56% of the references cited on these pages could be considered reputable, and that each entry contained 29 reputable sources on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haigh|first1=CA|title=Wikipedia as an evidence source for nursing and healthcare students.|journal=Nurse Education Today|date=February 2011|volume=31|issue=2|pages=135–9|doi=10.1016/j.nedt.2010.05.004|pmid=20646799}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study examined Wikipedia pages about five [[statin]]s, and concluded that these pages did not contain incorrect or misleading information, but that they were often missing information about drug interactions and contraindications to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kupferberg|first1=N|last2=Protus|first2=BM|title=Accuracy and completeness of drug information in Wikipedia: an assessment.|journal=Journal of the Medical Library Association : JMLA|date=October 2011|volume=99|issue=4|pages=310–3|pmid=22022226|doi=10.3163/1536-5050.99.4.010|pmc=3193353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another 2011 study examining Wikipedia articles on the 20 most widely prescribed drugs found that seven of these articles did not have any references, and concluded that "Wikipedia does not provide consistently accurate, complete, and referenced medication information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lavsa|first1=Stacey M.|last2=Corman|first2=Shelby L.|last3=Culley|first3=Colleen M.|last4=Pummer|first4=Tara L.|title=Reliability of Wikipedia as a medication information source for pharmacy students|journal=Currents in Pharmacy Teaching and Learning|date=April 2011|volume=3|issue=2|pages=154–158|doi=10.1016/j.cptl.2011.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An assessment of Wikipedia articles in 2012 on [[dietary supplements]] found that Wikipedia articles were "frequently incomplete, of variable quality, and sometimes inconsistent with reputable sources of information on these products."&lt;ref name="PhillipsLam2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phillips|first1=Jennifer|last2=Lam|first2=Connie|last3=Palmisano|first3=Lisa|title=Analysis of the accuracy and readability of herbal supplement information on Wikipedia|journal=Journal of the American Pharmacists Association|volume=54|issue=4|year=2014|pages=406–14|issn=1544-3191|doi=10.1331/JAPhA.2014.13181|pmid=25063262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 scoping review published in the ''[[Journal of Medical Internet Research]]'' summarized the existing evidence about the use of wikis, Wikipedia and other collaborative writing applications in health care and found that the available research publications were observational reports rather than the primary research studies which would be necessary to begin drawing conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Wikis and Collaborative Writing Applications in Health Care: A Scoping Review|url = http://www.jmir.org/2013/10/e210/|journal = [[Journal of Medical Internet Research]]|date = 8 October 2013|pmc = 3929050|pmid = 24103318|volume = 15|issue = 10|doi = 10.2196/jmir.2787|first = Patrick M|last = Archambault|first2 = Tom H van de|last2 = Belt|first3 = Francisco J Grajales|last3 = III|first4 = Marjan J|last4 = Faber|first5 = Craig E|last5 = Kuziemsky|first6 = Susie|last6 = Gagnon|first7 = Andrea|last7 = Bilodeau|first8 = Simon|last8 = Rioux|first9 = Willianne LDM|last9 = Nelen|page = e210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 study that examined 97 Wikipedia articles about [[complementary and alternative medicine]] (CAM) found that 4% of them had attained "Good article" status, and that CAM articles on Wikipedia tended to be significantly shorter than those about conventional therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koo|first1=Malcolm|title=Complementary and Alternative Medicine on Wikipedia: Opportunities for Improvement|journal=Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine|date=2014|volume=2014|pages=1–4|doi=10.1155/2014/105186|pmid=24864148|pmc=4016830}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In May 2014, ''[[The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association]]'' published an article which concluded that "Most Wikipedia articles for the 10 costliest conditions in the United States contain errors compared with standard peer-reviewed sources."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Hasty|first1 = Robert|last2 = Garvalosa|first2 = Ryan|last3 = Barbato|first3 = Vincenzo|last4 = Valdes|first4 = Pedro|last5 = Powers|first5 = David|last6 = Hernandez|first6 = Emmanuel|last7 = John|first7 = Jones|last8 = Suciu|first8 = Gabriel|last9 = Qureshi|first9 = Farheen|last10 = Popa-Radu|first10 = Matei|last11 = San Jose|first11 = Sergio|last12 = Drexler|first12 = Nathaniel|last13 = Patankar|first13 = Rohan|last14 = Paz|first14 = Jose|last15 = King|first15 = Christopher|last16 = Gerber|first16 = Hilary|last17 = Valladares|first17 = Michael|last18 = Somji|first18 = Alyaz|title = Wikipedia vs Peer-Reviewed Medical Literature for Information About the 10 Most Costly Medical Conditions|journal = The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association|volume = 114|issue = 5|year = 2014|pages = 368–373|issn = 0098-6151|doi = 10.7556/jaoa.2014.035|pmid = 24778001}}

A 2014 study found that when the FDA issues new safety warnings about drugs, in 41% of cases reviewed Wikipedia articles about those drugs were updated to give the new safety information within two weeks.&lt;ref name="HwangBourgeois2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hwang|first1=Thomas J.|last2=Bourgeois|first2=Florence T.|last3=Seeger|first3=John D.|title=Drug Safety in the Digital Age|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=370|issue=26|year=2014|pages=2460–2462|issn=0028-4793|doi=10.1056/NEJMp1401767|pmid=24963564}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 23% of Wikipedia drug articles were updated to give this information within an average of about 40 days, but 36% of articles are not updated with this information within a year.&lt;ref name="HwangBourgeois2014"/&gt;

A 2014 comparison between selected drug information from pharmacology textbooks and comparable information on the [[English Wikipedia|English-language]] and [[German Wikipedia|German-language]] Wikipedias found that the drug information in Wikipedia covers most of what is essential for undergraduate pharmacology studies and that it is accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Accuracy and Completeness of Drug Information in Wikipedia: A Comparison with Standard Textbooks of Pharmacology|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 24 September 2014|pmc = 4174509|pmid = 25250889|pages = e106930|volume = 9|issue = 9|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0106930|first = Jona|last = Kräenbring|first2 = Tika|last2 = Monzon Penza|first3 = Joanna|last3 = Gutmann|first4 = Susanne|last4 = Muehlich|first5 = Oliver|last5 = Zolk|first6 = Leszek|last6 = Wojnowski|first7 = Renke|last7 = Maas|first8 = Stefan|last8 = Engelhardt|first9 = Antonio|last9 = Sarikas|bibcode = 2014PLoSO...9j6930K}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 study comparing the coverage of the [[MMR vaccine controversy|autism-vaccine controversy]] on several websites found that Wikipedia's articles were broadly pro-vaccine. The study attributed this pro-vaccine stance to "this highly controversial topic attracting committed editors who strictly enforce the requirements for academic references."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Venkatraman |first1=Anand |last2=Garg |first2=Neetika |date=2015 |title=Greater freedom of speech on Web 2.0 correlates with dominance of views linking vaccines to autism |journal=Vaccines |volume=17 |issue=33 |pages=1422–1425 |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.01.078|pmid=25665960 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 study found that drug information on Wikipedia was less accurate and complete than that on the medical reference site [[Micromedex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reilly|first1=Timothy|last2=Jackson|first2=William|last3=Berger|first3=Victoria|last4=Candelario|first4=Danielle|title=Accuracy and completeness of drug information in Wikipedia medication monographs|journal=Journal of the American Pharmacists Association|date=November 2016|doi=10.1016/j.japh.2016.10.007|pmid=27866956|volume=57|issue=2|pages=193–196.e1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study compared the accuracy of Wikipedia articles about the 33 most popular medications with medication guides to the accuracy of their medication guides.

===Readability===

A 2013 review of [[nephrology]] content on Wikipedia found it to be "a comprehensive and fairly reliable medical resource for nephrology patients that is written at a college reading level".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Thomas | first1 = G.

A 2014 study found that Wikipedia's article on [[Parkinson's disease]] had a [[Flesch–Kincaid readability tests#Flesch reading ease|Flesch reading ease]] score of 30.31, meaning that it was difficult to read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brigo|first1=F|last2=Erro|first2=R|title=The readability of the English Wikipedia article on Parkinson's disease|journal=Neurological Sciences|volume=36|issue=6|pages=1045–6|date=18 January 2015|pmid=25596713|doi=10.1007/s10072-015-2077-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The readability of Wikipedia's articles on [[epilepsy]] was evaluated and found to be low, indicating that they were difficult to read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brigo|first1=F|last2=Otte|first2=WM|last3=Igwe|first3=SC|last4=Tezzon|first4=F|last5=Nardone|first5=R|title=Clearly written, easily comprehended?

A 2016 study found that Wikipedia information about common [[internal medicine]] diagnoses was written at a higher grade level than any of the four other sites studied (NIH, WebMD, Mayo Clinic, and "diagnosis-specific websites").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hutchinson|first1=N|last2=Baird|first2=GL|last3=Garg|first3=M|title=Examining the reading level of Internet medical information for common Internal Medicine diagnoses|journal=The American Journal of Medicine|date=29 January 2016|pmid=26829438|doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2016.01.008|volume=129|issue=6|pages=637–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, another study published the same year found that medical students reading about three unstudied diseases on [[AccessMedicine]] and Wikipedia experienced less mental effort than did readers of the same diseases on [[UpToDate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saparova|first1=D|last2=Nolan|first2=NS|title=Evaluating the appropriateness of electronic information resources for learning.|journal=Journal of the Medical Library Association : JMLA|date=January 2016|volume=104|issue=1|pages=24–32|pmid=26807049|doi=10.3163/1536-5050.104.1.004|pmc=4722638}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study evaluating 134 Wikipedia articles on [[autoimmune disease]]s found that they were very difficult to read and required at least a university graduate reading level. The study's authors were concerned by Wikipedia's low readability, as people with autoimmune disorders often use Wikipedia to research their condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Watad |first1=Abdulla |last2=Bragazzi |first2=Nicola Luigi |last3=Brigo |first3=Francesco |last4=Sharif |first4=Kassem |last5=Amital |first5=Howard |last6=McGonagle |first6=Dennis |last7=Shoenfeld |first7=Yehuda |last8=Adawi |first8=Mohammad |date=2017 |title=Readability of Wikipedia Pages on Autoimmune Disorders: Systematic Quantitative Assessment |url=http://www.jmir.org/2017/7/e260/ |journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR) |volume=19 |issue=7 |pages=e260 |doi=10.2196/jmir.8225|pmid=28720555 |pmc=5539385 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 study evaluating 55 Wikipedia articles on [[neurosurgery|neurosurgical]] topics found that they were significantly more difficult to read than the [[American Association of Neurological Surgeons]]'s patient information articles, although both Wikipedia's articles and the AANS articles required a college reading level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Modiria |first1=Omen |last2=Guhab |first2=Daipayan |last3=Alotaibib |first3=Naif M. |last4=Ibrahim |first4=George M. |last5=Lipsmanb |first5=Nor |last6=Fallahc |first6=Aria |date=2018 |title=Readability and quality of wikipedia pages on neurosurgical topics |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303846718300271?via%3Dihub |journal=Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery |volume=166 |pages=66–70 |doi=10.1016/j.clineuro.2018.01.021|pmid=29408776 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General public===

A 2015 study compared the popularity of Wikipedia's articles on ten of the most common neurological disorders over a 90-day period from April 2014 to July 2014; it found that there was no relationship between the incidence or prevalence of a neurological disorder and the number of page views it received. For example, Wikipedia's article on [[multiple sclerosis]] was far more popular than its articles on more common disorders like [[migraine]], [[epilepsy]], or [[stroke]]. The authors theorized that this might be due to the increasing prevalence of [[MRI scans]], which has led to an increase in incidental findings of [[white matter lesion]]s. Although most of these lesions have nothing to do with multiple sclerosis, they may lead patients, relatives, and even physicians to perform Internet searches on "multiple sclerosis", which may lead them to the Wikipedia article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brigo |first1=Francesco  |last2=Igwe |first2=Stanley C. |last3=Nardone |first3=Raffaele |last4=Lochner |first4=Piergiorgio |last5=Tezzon |first5=Freudiano |last6=Otte |first6=Willem M. |date=2015 |title=Wikipedia and neurological disorders |url=https://www.jocn-journal.com/article/S0967-5868(15)00099-5/fulltext |journal=Journal of Clinical Neuroscience |volume=22 |issue=7 |pages=1170–1172 |doi=10.1016/j.jocn.2015.02.006|pmid=25890773  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 study done at a single medical school showed that 97% of students used Wikipedia to study medicine, with the most common reasons being ease of access and ease of understanding. There was no relationship between a student's year in medical school and his or her use of Wikipedia, but students further along in medical school were less likely to use Wikipedia as their first resource, only resource, or most common resource; they were also more likely to perceive Wikipedia as unreliable.&lt;ref name="AllahwalaNadkarni2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allahwala|first1=Usaid K.|last2=Nadkarni|first2=Aniket|last3=Sebaratnam|first3=Deshan F.|title=Wikipedia use amongst medical students – New insights into the digital revolution|journal=Medical Teacher|volume=35|issue=4|year=2013|pages=337|issn=0142-159X|doi=10.3109/0142159X.2012.737064|pmid=23137251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[UCSF School of Medicine]] began to offer fourth-year medical students a month-long elective centered around improving Wikipedia's health-related articles. Between 2013 and 2015, 43 students took part in the course and chose a single health-related article to work on. A study of their contributions by UCSF faculty found that the students expanded their articles, added higher-quality sources, removed lower-quality sources, and improved readability. The study's authors argued that medical schools should encourage students to contribute to Wikipedia, both to improve the quality of its content and to enable students to become better health care educators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Azzam |first1=A |last2=Bresler |first2=D |last3=Leon |first3=A |last4=Maggio |first4=L |last5=Whitaker |first5=E |last6=Heilman |first6=J |last7=Orlowitz |first7=J |last8=Swisher |first8=V |last9=Rasberry |first9=L |last10=Otoide |first10=K |last11=Trotter |first11=F |last12=Ross |first12=W |last13=McCue |first13=JD |title=Why Medical Schools Should Embrace Wikipedia: Final-Year Medical Student Contributions to Wikipedia Articles for Academic Credit at One School. |journal=Academic Medicine |date=February 2017 |volume=92 |issue=2 |pages=194–200 |doi=10.1097/ACM.0000000000001381 |pmid=27627633 |pmc=5265689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 study of five European medical schools found that students who used Wikipedia for general information were more likely to use it to look up medical information. 16% of students used Wikipedia often for general information, 60% sometimes, and 24% rarely. 12% of students used Wikipedia often for medical information, 55% sometimes, and 33% rarely. Almost all of the students (97%) found inaccurate information on Wikipedia at least once, but less than 20% of them corrected it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Herbert |first1=Verena G. |last2=Frings |first2=Andreas |last3=Rehatschek |first3=Herwig |last4=Richard |first4=Gilbert |last5=Leithner |first5=Andreas |date=2015 |title=Wikipedia – challenges and new horizons in enhancing medical education |journal=BMC Medical Education |volume=15 |issue=32 |pages= 32|doi=10.1186/s12909-015-0309-2|pmid=25879421 |pmc=4384304 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study of online resource use by first-year medical students at [[Melbourne Medical School]] found that they used the school's online learning platform most often (daily) and used Google and Wikipedia slightly less often (approximately daily). The students considered the learning platform to be most useful, followed by Google and Wikipedia, which they considered slightly less useful than the learning platform but significantly more useful than Facebook or [[Google Scholar]]. They also considered the learning platform to be the most reliable and considered Google and Wikipedia to be significantly less reliable, although they frequently used both websites as a starting point for finding information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Judd |first1=Terry |last2=Elliott |first2=Kristine |date=2017 |title=Selection and Use of Online Learning Resources by First-Year Medical Students: Cross-Sectional Study |url=http://mededu.jmir.org/2017/2/e17/ |journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research I |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=e17 |doi=10.2196/mededu.7382|pmid=28970187 |pmc=5643842 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 study of resources used by medical students during their general surgery [[Clinical clerkship|clerkship]] at the [[University of Florida College of Medicine]] found that review books were the most commonly used type of study resource, followed by the Internet. Wikipedia was the third-most commonly used resource and the most commonly used Internet resource. The study found no correlation between the type of resource used and students' performance on the NBME surgery subject exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=Janice A. |last2=Shaw |first2=Christiana M. |last3=Tan |first3=Sanda A. |last4=Falcone |first4=John L. |date=2017 |title=Are the kids alright?

===Residents===
A 2009 study of Internet use by 35 [[junior doctors]] in the United Kingdom found that 80% of them used Google and 70% of them used Wikipedia to look up medical information at least once a week, while only 30% used [[PubMed]]. Google and Wikipedia were primarily used for background reading, while PubMed and other "best evidence" websites were used to answer specific questions for clinical decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hughes |first1=Benjamin |last2=Joshi |first2=Indra |last3=Lemonde |first3=Hugh |last4=Wareham |first4=Jonathan |date=October 2009 |title=Junior physician's use of Web 2.0 for information seeking and medical education: A qualitative study |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386505609000756?via%3Dihub |journal=International Journal of Medical Informatics |volume=78 |issue=10 |pages=645–655 |doi=10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2009.04.008|pmid=19501017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 survey of psychiatry residents at [[Harvard Medical School]] found that they used online resources twice as often as they used printed resources. The three most commonly used resources were UpToDate, [[PubMed]], and Wikipedia. UpToDate was the most used resource and was considered to be the most trustworthy, while PubMed was the second most used resource and was highly rated as a source of personal learning. Wikipedia was the third most used resource and received the highest ranking for ease of use; however, it was considered the least trustworthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Torous |first1=John |last2=Franzen |first2=Jamie |last3=O’Connor |first3=Ryan |last4=Mathew |first4=Ian |last5=Keshavan |first5=Matcher |last6=Kitts |first6=Robert |last7=Boland |first7=Robert |date=2015 |title=Psychiatry Residents' Use of Educational Websites: A Pilot Survey Study |journal=Academic Psychiatry |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=630–633 |doi=10.1007/s40596-015-0335-8|pmid=26077007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physicians and other health professionals===
A 2014 study of 259 health professionals in Spain found that while 53% of them used the [[Spanish Wikipedia]] to look up medical information during work, only 3% of them considered it reliable and only 16% recommended it to their patients. Only 16% had ever edited a Wikipedia article; the most common reasons for not doing were that they did not consider themselves an expert (51%), they preferred to blog or publish peer-reviewed articles (21%), and they were concerned that someone would undo any contributions they made (17%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Santillán |first1=Azucena |last2=Máñez |first2=Miguel Ángel |last3=Meijome |first3=Xose Manuel |date=2014 |title=Uso de Wikipedia por los profesionales de la salud |trans-title=Use of Wikipedia by health professionals |url=http://www.gacetasanitaria.org/es/uso-wikipedia-por-los-profesionales/articulo/S0213911114001964/ |language=Spanish |journal=Gaceta Sanitaria |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=522 |doi=10.1016/j.gaceta.2014.04.014|pmid=25087118 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic citations===
Wikipedia has been inappropriately cited as an authoritative source in many health science journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bould|first=M. D.|author2=Hladkowicz, E. S. |author3=Pigford, A.-A.

===Impact on psychological tests===
In 2009 a doctor and Wikipedia editor, [[James Heilman]], incorporated [[public domain]] images of the [[Rorschach test]] into Wikipedia.&lt;ref name="rorschach"&gt;

==Nature of contributors==
A 2014 interview study found that around half of the editors of health-related content on the English-language Wikipedia are health care professionals, while the other half includes some medical students.&lt;ref name="around half" /&gt; An author of this study wrote that this provides "reassurance about the reliability of the website".&lt;ref name="around half" /&gt; The study also found that the "core editor community", who actively monitor and edit most health-related articles on the English-language Wikipedia, numbered around 300 people.&lt;ref name="FaričPotts2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farič|first1=Nuša|last2=Potts|first2=Henry WW|title=Motivations for Contributing to Health-Related Articles on Wikipedia: An Interview Study|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|volume=16|issue=12|year=2014|pages=e260|issn=1438-8871|doi=10.2196/jmir.3569|pmid=25498308|pmc=4275502}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that people who contribute on these topics do so for a variety of reasons, including a desire to better learn the subjects themselves, and a sense of both responsibility and enjoyment in improving others' access to health information.&lt;ref name="FaričPotts2014"/&gt;

A 2016 study found that Wikipedia editors who contributed to articles on [[designer drug]]s were most likely to also contribute to articles on illegal drugs and pharmaceutical drugs, implying that they have a background in pharmacology. They were also more likely to contribute to articles on neurological disorders, psychiatric disorders, other diseases, and cell biology; they were least likely to edit articles about popular culture topics or history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dijkstra |first1=Louis J. |last2=Krieg |first2=Lisa J. |date=2016 |title=From MDMA to Lady Gaga: Expertise and contribution behavior of editing communities on Wikipedia |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050916326801 |journal=Procedia Computer Science |volume=1 |pages=96–106 |doi=10.1016/j.procs.2016.11.013|bibcode=2010ProCS...1.1119G |arxiv=1005.5384 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traffic statistics in health monitoring==
Just as [[Google Flu Trends]] was able to correlate searches for flu to local [[outbreaks]] of [[flu]], page views of Wikipedia articles on flu-related topics have been found to increase in populations experiencing the spread of flu,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McIver|first=David J.|author2=Brownstein, John S. |author3=Salathé, Marcel |title=Wikipedia Usage Estimates Prevalence of Influenza-Like Illness in the United States in Near Real-Time|journal=[[PLoS Computational Biology]]|date=17 April 2014|volume=10|issue=4|pages=e1003581|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003581|pmid=24743682 |pmc=3990502|bibcode=2014PLSCB..10E3581M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.technologyreview.com/view/532246/how-wikipedia-data-is-revolutionizing-flu-forecasting/ |title=How Wikipedia Data Is Revolutionizing Flu Forecasting |author=none listed |work=[[MIT Technology Review]] |date=3 November 2014 |accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of other diseases such as [[dengue fever]] and [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Generous|first1=Nicholas|last2=Fairchild|first2=Geoffrey|last3=Deshpande|first3=Alina|last4=Del Valle|first4=Sara Y.|last5=Priedhorsky|first5=Reid|last6=Salathé|first6=Marcel|title=Global Disease Monitoring and Forecasting with Wikipedia|journal=PLoS Computational Biology|date=13 November 2014|volume=10|issue=11|pages=e1003892|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003892|pmid=25392913|pmc=4231164|bibcode=2014PLSCB..10E3892G|arxiv=1405.3612}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-30021644 | title=Wikipedia 'foresees virus outbreaks' | newspaper=BBC News | date=13 November 2014 | accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects to improve health information on Wikipedia==
In 2009 the [[National Institutes of Health]] attempted a pilot project for integrating health information into Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''International Psychopharmacology Algorithm Project''' (IPAP) is a [[non-profit]] [[corporation]] whose purpose is to "enable, enhance, and propagate" use of [[algorithm]]s for the [[Pharmacotherapy|treatment]] of some [[Axis I disorder|Axis I psychiatric disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Trivedi MH, DeBattista C, Fawcett J, Nelson C, Osser DN, Stein D, Jobson K |year=1998|title=Developing treatment algorithms for unipolar depression in Cyberspace: International Psychopharmacology Algorithm Project (IPAP)|journal=Psychopharmacology Bulletin|volume=34|issue=3|pages=355–359|pmid=9803769}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenneth O Jobson founded the Project. [[The Dean Foundation]] provides funding.

IPAP has organized and supported several international conferences on [[psychopharmacology]] algorithms.  It has also supported the creation of several algorithms based on [[expert opinion]]. It is now in the process of creating "evidence-based algorithms," that is algorithms created by experts and annotated with the evidence that leads to these algorithms.  A [[schizophrenia]] algorithm has been created and one on Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ([[PTSD]]) was released in July 2005. A [[general anxiety disorder]] (GAD) algorithm was released in 2006. Periodic updates of the algorithms are released as the basis of evidence changes.  In addition, the algorithms are being translated into various non-English languages (Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, and Thai) as the availability of translators permits.

'''Invalid carriages''' were usually single seater road vehicles, buggies, or self-propelled vehicles for disabled people. They pre-dated the electric [[mobility scooter]]s and from the 1920s were generally powered by a small gasoline/petrol engine, although some were battery powered. They were usually designed without foot-operated controls.

==History==
===Origins===
[[Stephan Farffler]] was a [[Nuremberg]] [[watchmaker]] of the seventeenth century whose invention of a manumotive carriage in 1655 is widely considered to have been the first self-propelled [[wheelchair]]. As such it was consistent with the later designs for self-propelled invalid carriages. The three-wheeled device is also believed to have been a precursor to the modern-day [[tricycle]] and [[bicycle]].&lt;ref&gt;"Medical Innovations - Wheelchair," ''Science Reporter, Volume 44'', 2007, 397.&lt;/ref&gt; Farffler was either a [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]]&lt;ref&gt;Jane Bidder, ''Inventions We Use to Go Places'' (London: Franklin Watts, 2006, 18)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Rory A. Cooper]], Hisaichi Ohnabe, and Douglas A. Hobson, ''An Introduction to Rehabilitation Engineering'' (Boca Raton: CRC Press, 2007, 131&lt;/ref&gt; or an [[Amputation|amputee]],&lt;ref&gt;Clive Richardson, ''Driving, the development and use of horse-drawn vehicles'' (B. T. Batsford, 1985, 136)&lt;/ref&gt;

In England the fore-runner of the invalid carriage was the [[Bath chair|bath chair]]. It was invented by James Heath, of Bath in the early 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofbath.co.uk/history/body_bathchair.html Bath chair] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519222501/http://www.cityofbath.co.uk/history/body_bathchair.html |date=May 19, 2008 }}. City of Bath England.&lt;/ref&gt; Animal drawn versions of the bath chair became known as invalid carriages. An 1880 Monk and Co invalids carriage is on display at the [[M Shed]] Bristol.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecarriagefoundation.org.uk/item/invalid-carriage-bristol Carriages of Britain Carriage Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Stanley Engineering Co Ltd of Egham, Surrey, began making self-propelled invalid carriages under the 'Argson' name in the 1920s. The Argson Runnymede was designed in South Africa manufactured in England from 1936 to 1954. They were either battery-powered or had a Villiers petrol engine. A petrol powered Runnymede drove across the Alps in 1947.  Stanley Engineering was bought by C B Harper Ltd in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/19288/lot/500/ Lot 500 1946 Argson Runnymede Invalid Carriage Registration no. KPK 117]&lt;/ref&gt;

R A Harding Company of Bath was founded in 1921. They initially produced hand-propelled tricycles. In 1926 Harding's introduced a variety of powered invalid carriages. The De Luxe models A and B were powered by a 122cc Villier-and the Pultney was powered by either a 200cc or 300cc JAP. There were also 24-volt or 36-volt electric machines. In 1945, the company was renamed R A Harding (Bath) Ltd, and the Pultney was discontinued. In December 1948 the De Luxe moels were upgraded with larger rear wheels, a new petrol tank, and a fan-cooled Villiers 147cc unit. Hardings introduced a full bodied model in 1956 called the Consort. Only 12 of these were made. The company closed down in 1988 having made hand powered models until 1973 and motor drive ones until 1966.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.flickr.com/photos/26237061@N07/6261815278 retrieved 14 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1930s to late 1940s, Nelco Industries made a three-wheeled battery powered vehicle. Steering was by means of a tiller connected to the front wheel. The tiller also provided speed control. Forward or reverse by a separate control. The 24 volt electric motor could act as a generator to recharge the battery when going downhill. The motor was 24 volt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzmuseums.co.nz/account/3328/object/1688 Nelco Solocar; Nelco Industries England; 1930s; 2008-20]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, [[Bert Greeves]] adapted a motorcycle with the help of his paralysed cousin Derry Preston-Cobb as transport for Preston-Cobb. Noticing the number of former servicemen injured in the Second World War they spotted a commercial opportunity and approached the UK government for support, leading to the creation of Invacar Ltd.&lt;ref name="Invacar"&gt;
{{cite web |last=Payne |first=Elvis |title=Invacar |url=http://www.3wheelers.com/invacar.html |publisher=3-wheelers.com |accessdate=29 June 2013 |mode=cs2}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Invacar was not the only company to be contracted by the Ministry of Health to produce three-wheeled vehicles for disabled drivers. Others included Harding, Dingwall &amp; Son, [[AC Cars]], Barrett, Tippen &amp; Son, Thundersley, Vernon Industries, and [[Coventry Climax]].&lt;ref name=Invacar/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/automobiles/collectibles/06INVACAR.html Britain’s 3-Wheel Solution to Mobility for the Disabled], Tudor Van Hampton,3 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

These early vehicles were powered by an air-cooled [[Villiers Engineering|Villiers]] 147 cc engine, but when production of that engine ceased in the early 1970s it was replaced by a much more powerful 4-stroke 500 cc or 600 cc [[Steyr-Puch]] engine, giving a reported top speed of {{convert|82|mph|abbr=on}}.{{r|Invacar}} They were low-cost low-maintenance vehicles, designed specifically for people with physical disabilities. Production of them stopped in 1976, and the last were withdrawn from the road in 2003, though some still exist, including a 1976 example, one of the last made, on display at the [[National Motor Museum, Beaulieu]] in [[Hampshire]], England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalmotormuseum.org.uk/?location_id=335&amp;item=17&amp;offset=0 National Motor Museum (UK): List of Vehicles in the Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain in the 1960s and 1970s, [[Invacar|invalid carriages]] were provided as a subsidised low-cost vehicle to aid mobility of people with disabilities. Vehicles supplied by the [[National Health Service]] had 3 wheels, were very lightweight, and therefore their suitability on roads among other traffic was often considered dubious on safety grounds. Invalid-carriages are banned from [[motorway]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://classiccars.brightwells.com/viewdetails.php?id=5456, retrieved 12 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fritz Fend]], a former technical officer with the Luftwaffe, also designed a three-wheel invalid carriage in 1948. The first version was unpowered with the single wheel at the front. His powered version had a 38cc [[Victoria (motorcycle)]] two-stroke engine chain driving a single rear wheel with the pair of wheels at the front for steering. It was called the Fend Fritzer. Some 250 were made between 1948 and 1951 when it ceased production.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Carl (Second Quarter 1973). ""Ist das nicht ein Kabinenroller?" "Ja! das ist ein Kabinenroller!"

Invalid carriages were also made in other countries: [[Simson (company)|Simson]] DUO in [[East Germany]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schwalbennest.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=56&amp;Itemid=106] Duo 4-5 Schwalbennest Simson und mehr  - accessed 06 Feb 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[SMZ cycle-car|SMZ]] in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Velorex]] in [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.velorex.com/td_oskar54.htm TECHNICKÁ DATA - OSKAR 54]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.velorex.com/mainframeset.htm VELOREX TEAM ZLATÁ RŮŽE BOSKOVICE]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Duo was made initially by VEB Fahrzeugbau und Ausrüstungen Brandis (VEB FAB) from 1973 until 1978, whereupon manufacture was transferred to VEB Robur, more famous for making trucks in [[Zittau]]. Because many of the components are common with the Simson, the Duo is often classified as a Simson. Production ceased in 1989.

'''Kegel exercise''', also known as '''pelvic floor exercise''', consists of repeatedly contracting and relaxing the muscles that form part of the [[pelvic floor]], now sometimes colloquially referred to as the "Kegel muscles". The exercise can be performed multiple times each day, for several minutes at a time, for one to three months, to begin to have an effect.

Kegel exercises can make the pelvic floor muscles stronger. These are the muscles that hold up the bladder and help keep it from leaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/urologic-diseases/bladder-control-problems-women/kegel-exercises|title=Kegel Exercises {{!}} NIDDK|work=National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases|access-date=2017-12-02|language=en-US}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003975.htm|title=Pelvic floor muscle training exercises: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exercises are usually done to reduce [[Stress incontinence|urinary stress incontinence]] (especially after childbirth) and reduce [[premature ejaculation]] in men.&lt;ref name="autogenerated22"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Nicastro|first2=A|year=1996|title=A new treatment for premature ejaculation: the rehabilitation of the pelvic floor|journal=Journal of sex &amp; marital therapy|volume=22|issue=1|pages=22–6|doi=10.1080/00926239608405302|pmid=8699493|last1=La Pera|first1=G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Several tools exist to help with these exercises, although various studies debate the relative effectiveness of different tools versus traditional exercises.&lt;ref name="bjui.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bjui.org/ContentFullItem.aspx?id=427&amp;LinkTypeID=1&amp;SectionType=4 |title=A randomised controlled trial of the PelvicToner Device in female stress urinary incontinence |publisher=BJUI.org |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were first described in 1948 by American gynecologist [[Arnold Kegel]].

==Health effects==
Factors such as [[pregnancy]], [[childbirth]], aging, being [[overweight]], and abdominal surgery such as cesarean section, often result in the weakening of the pelvic muscles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/pelvic-floor|title=Pelvic floor|last=Services|first=Department of Health &amp; Human|access-date=2018-02-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be assessed by either digital examination of vaginal pressure or using a Kegel [[perineometer]]. Kegel exercises are useful in regaining pelvic floor muscle strength in such cases.

===Urinary health===
Pelvic floor exercises (muscle training) can be included in conservative treatment approaches for women with [[urinary incontinence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dumoulin|first=Chantale|last2=Cacciari|first2=Licia P.|last3=Hay-Smith|first3=E.

===Pelvic prolapse===
The symptoms of [[Prolapse#Pelvic floor prolapse|prolapse]] and its severity can be decreased with pelvic floor exercises.&lt;ref name="pmid22161382"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hagen S, Stark D |title=Conservative prevention and management of pelvic organ prolapse in women |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=12 |issue= 12|pages=CD003882 |year=2011 |pmid=22161382 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003882.pub4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/urologic-diseases/bladder-control-problems-women/cystocele-prolapsed-bladder|title=Cystocele (Prolapsed Bladder) {{!}} NIDDK|work=National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases|access-date=2017-12-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effectiveness can be improved with feedback on how to do the exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herderschee|first1=R|last2=Hay-Smith|first2=EJ|last3=Herbison|first3=GP|last4=Roovers|first4=JP|last5=Heineman|first5=MJ|title=Feedback or biofeedback to augment pelvic floor muscle training for urinary incontinence in women.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=6 July 2011|issue=7|pages=CD009252|pmid=21735442|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism of action==
The aim of Kegel exercises is to improve [[muscle tone]] by strengthening the [[pubococcygeus muscle]]s of the [[pelvic floor]]. Kegel is a popular prescribed exercise for pregnant women to prepare the [[pelvic floor]] for physiological stresses of the later stages of [[pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]]. Kegel exercises are said to be good for treating [[vaginal prolapse]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=September 2, 2011 |url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/vaginal_prolapse/article_em.htm |title=Vaginal Prolapse |publisher=eMedicineHealth |date=2011-02-09 |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and preventing [[uterine prolapse]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001508.htm#Prevention |title=MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia: Uterine prolapse |publisher=Nlm.nih.gov |date=2011-08-29 |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; in women and for treating [[prostate]] pain and swelling resulting from [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]] (BPH) and [[prostatitis]] in men. Kegel exercises may be beneficial in treating [[urinary incontinence]] in both men and women.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003975.htm|title=MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia: Kegel exercises|date=2011-08-29|publisher=Nlm.nih.gov|accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kegel exercises may also increase sexual gratification, allowing women to complete [[pompoir]] and aid in reducing [[premature ejaculation]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated22"/&gt; in men. The many actions performed by Kegel muscles include holding in urine and avoiding defecation. Reproducing this type of muscle action can strengthen the Kegel muscles. The action of slowing or stopping the flow of urine may be used as a test of correct pelvic floor exercise technique.&lt;ref&gt;Kenway, M., and Goh, J. (2009). ''Inside Out: The Essential Women's Guide to Pelvic Support''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is now known that the components of levator ani (the pelvic diaphragm), namely pubococcygeus, puborectalis and ileococcygeus, contract and relax as one muscle. Hence, pelvic floor exercises involve the entire levator ani rather than pubococcygeus alone. Pelvic floor exercises may be of benefit in cases of [[fecal incontinence]] and pelvic organ prolapse conditions e.g. [[rectal prolapse]].&lt;ref name="Bø 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bø|first=K|title=Can pelvic floor muscle training prevent and treat pelvic organ prolapse?|journal=Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand|year=2006|volume=85|issue=3|pages=263–8|pmid=16553172|doi=10.1080/00016340500486800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pelvic toning devices==
[[Image:Kegel exerciser.JPG|thumb|A Kegel exerciser]]
Some devices have been marketed to women exercise their pelvic floor muscle and improve the muscle tone of the pubococcygeal or vaginal muscle.

[[File:Ben Wa Balls.jpg|thumb|[[Ben wa balls]]]]

As of 2013 there was no evidence that doing pelvic floor exercise with weights worked better than doing Kegel exercises without weights; there is greater risk with weights, because a foreign object is introduced into the vagina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herbison|first1=GP|last2=Dean|first2=N|title=Weighted vaginal cones for urinary incontinence|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=8 July 2013|issue=7|pages=CD002114|pmid=23836411|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002114.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bjui.org" /&gt;

Inserting foreign objects into the vagina increases the risk of infections and can lead to [[vaginosis]] or [[toxic shock syndrome]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Overuse of such Kegel exercises, with or without a device, can lead to pelvic pain and pain during sex.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://drjengunter.wordpress.com/2017/01/17/dear-gwyneth-paltrow-im-a-gyn-and-your-vaginal-jade-eggs-are-a-bad-idea/|title=Dear Gwyneth Paltrow, I’m a GYN and your vaginal jade eggs are a bad idea|last=Gunter|first=Jen|date=2017-01-17|website=Dr. Jen Gunter|access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marketing===
During the latter part of the 20th century, a number of medical and pseudo-medical devices were marketed to consumers as improving sex or orgasms, increasing "[[Energy (esotericism)|energy]]", "balancing hormones", and as having other health or lifestyle benefits. There  is no evidence for any of these claims, and many of them are pseudoscience.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="skeptical"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tuteur |first1=Amy |title=Vaginal weight lifting |url=http://www.skepticalob.com/2008/12/vaginal-weight-lifting.html |work=The Skeptical OB |date=18 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref nam°e=":1"&gt;{{cite news|title=No, Gwyneth Paltrow, women should not put jade eggs in their vaginas, gynecologist says|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/01/22/no-gwyneth-paltrow-women-should-not-put-jade-eggs-in-their-vaginas-gynecologist-says/|accessdate=6 February 2017|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''LPS-responsive beige-like anchor protein deficiency''''' is a rare genetic condition caused by the absence of LPS-responsive beige-like anchor protein (''[[LRBA]]''). 

==Genetics==

The LBRA gene is located on the long arm of [[chromosome 4]] (4q31.3).

==Pathogenesis==

LBRA protein interacts with the protein [[CTLA4]]. The absence of LBRA increases the turnover of CTLA4 and interferes with vesicle trafficing. 

==Clinical features==

The presentation of this condition is variable making the diagnosis difficult. The most common features include&lt;ref name=Gámez-Díaz2016&gt;Gámez-Díaz L, August D, Stepensky P, Revel-Vilk S, Seidel MG, Noriko M, Morio T, Worth AJJ, Blessing J, Van de Veerdonk F, Feuchtinger T, Kanariou M, Schmitt-Graeff A, Jung S, Seneviratne S, Burns S, Belohradsky BH, Rezaei N, Bakhtiar S, Speckmann C, Jordan M, Grimbacher B (2016) The extended phenotype of LPS-responsive beige-like anchor protein (LRBA) deficiency. J Allergy Clin Immunol 137(1):223-230 &lt;/ref&gt; 

* Immune dysregulation (95%)
* Organomegaly (86%)
* Recurrent infections (71%)
* [[Hypogammaglobulinemia]] (57%)
* [[Granulomatous lymphocytic interstitial lung disease]] (38%) 

There is also a tendency to develop [[inflammatory bowel disease]]. 

===Differential diagnosis===

*[[Common variable immunodeficiency]]
*[[IPEX syndrome]]

==Management==

Along with treatment for infections and other complications several additional treatments have been tried. These include hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, immunoglobulin replacement and immunosuppressive treatment.&lt;ref name=Gámez-Díaz2016a&gt;Gámez-Díaz L, August D, Stepensky P, Revel-Vilk S, Seidel MG, Noriko M, Morio T, Worth AJJ, Blessing J, Van de Veerdonk F, Feuchtinger T, Kanariou M, Schmitt-Graeff A, Jung S, Seneviratne S, Burns S, Belohradsky BH, Rezaei N, Bakhtiar S, Speckmann C, Jordan M, Grimbacher B (2016) The extended phenotype of LPS-responsive beige-like anchor protein (LRBA) deficiency. J Allergy Clin Immunol 137(1):223-230 &lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==

This condition was first described in 2012.&lt;ref name=Lopez-Herrera2012&gt;Lopez-Herrera G, Tampella G, Pan-Hammarstrom Q, Herholz P, Trujillo-Vargas CM, Phadwal K, Simon AK, Moutschen M, Etzioni A, Mory A, Srugo I, Melamed, D and 21 others. Deleterious mutations in LRBA are associated with a syndrome of immune deficiency and autoimmunity. Am J Hum Genet 90: 986-1001&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2134">In [[medicine]], a '''late effect''' is a condition that appears after the [[acute phase]] of an earlier, causal condition has run its course.  A late effect can be caused directly by the earlier condition, or indirectly by the treatment for the earlier condition.  Some late effects can occur decades later.  Historically, late effects have been very difficult to connect with their causes, but as survivorship and life span has increased and "follow up" has become standard practice, these connections are becoming established. A period, often very long, of health unaffected by both the initial and the late effect conditions distinguishes a late effect from a [[sequela]] or a [[complication (medical)|complication]].

The '''Life Ball''' in [[Vienna]] is the biggest [[Charitable organization|charity event]] in Europe supporting people with [[HIV]] or [[AIDS]]. The event is organized by the nonprofit organization AIDS LIFE, which was founded in 1992 by Gery Keszler and Torgom Petrosian.&lt;ref&gt;Life Ball: [http://www.lifeball.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=48&amp;Itemid=37&amp;lang=en Vision &amp; Mission]; [http://www.lifeball.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=49&amp;Itemid=41&amp;lang=en AIDS LIFE]&lt;/ref&gt;

AIDS LIFE supports aid organizations devoted to helping people who are HIV-positive or have AIDS. The team entrusted with the allocation of funds thoroughly examines each petition. Moreover, it is an explicit goal of AIDS LIFE to raise public awareness.

==The Event==

The Life Ball—one of the biggest and most spectacular annual charity events in the world—has attracted strong international interest and attention. The main priority of the Ball is, however, not only the exuberant celebration of the party people or spectacular live acts, but the fight against AIDS.

To ensure that the meaning of this major event is not forgotten, the opening ceremony on Vienna’s city hall square includes moments of silence and speeches by international stars and partners, which focus on raising awareness for AIDS.
Since the establishment of this society highlight, which has become a real tradition, numerous celebrities (designers, actors, musicians, politicians, and models) show their personal commitment to the issue with breathtaking live performances and send a strong signal of solidarity. They make use of their popularity and position as role models for a good cause.&lt;ref&gt;Life Ball: [http://www.lifeball.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=48&amp;Itemid=37&amp;lang=en Vision &amp; Mission]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Life Ball 2008 Zweitfrau.jpg|thumb|''Zweitfrau'' on the red carpet (2008)]]
The number of tickets for the Life Ball is limited to 3,780. To maintain the unique and extravagant style of the event, different ticket categories are available: a fixed number of tickets called “Style Tickets” are available at half price and are for those who meet the dress code of the Life Ball Style Bible. The costumes should correspond to the theme of the Ball. These are also the only guests—besides the stars—who are allowed to walk down the red carpet, which leads from Ringstrasse Boulevard across city hall square to the main stage in front of Vienna’s city hall. In the run-up to the 2008 Ball, Gery Keszler voiced the wish that guests try to be less provocative and more creative. As Chris Lohner put it: "A penis is not yet a costume".&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.wienerzeitung.at/DesktopDefault.aspx?TabID=4931&amp;Alias=wzo&amp;cob=349325&amp;currentpage=18 Zitate zum Dienstag]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Die Presse'' print edition, May 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Guests can apply for Style Tickets on the Style Bible webpage. Guests in normal evening attire pay the full ticket price. In 2001, a ticket sales system in which interested parties register in a raffle for tickets via text message was introduced. Usually, as many as 60,000 ticket registrations are received within the two-day sales period. The lucky ticket winners in both categories are selected randomly from all applications. A small number of tickets is issued through various campaigns (e.g., Life Ball Warm Up, [[eBay]] auctions, types of raffles where the ticket win is hidden in condom packages that are sold in selected bars and restaurants, a.s.o.) International guests can book Life Ball Packages including plane tickets and hotel as well as table bookings, which cost 4- to 5-figure euro amounts. In 2009, early table bookings slowed down due to the new Austrian anti-corruption act &lt;ref&gt;Hanna Kordik: [http://diepresse.com/home/wirtschaft/economist/414894/index.do Bestechung: Gesetz gegen Korruption wird gelockert], ''Die Presse'', June 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; that entered into force in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;APA: Partystimmung - Life Ball trotzt der Wirtschaftskrise, derstandard.at, April 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening gala features a wide variety of music, from [[operetta]] to [[pop music|pop]], national as well as international stars, and the fashion show on the huge [[Red Ribbon]] stage. Until 2008, it could be viewed free of charge on city hall square, which could accommodate 45,000 people; in 2009, however, access to the first part of the opening ceremony was limited to those who had tickets to the Ball itself and a viewers’ stand was constructed for those who wanted to view the opening ceremony. Guests can dance in the various patios and rooms of the city hall as they enjoy the offerings of the many bars and buffets. Some of the international stars perform on stages on the Ball premises.

This glamorous charity event is known far beyond the Austrian borders today. By now, over 60 TV stations and a total of 500 national and international media representatives cover the event each year. In case of repeated accreditation, the organizers check whether the topic of AIDS was also addressed in the coverage to avoid that only stars and celebrities are mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Wurmdobler: Gute Nervensäge, Falter 21/03, May 21, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Austrian public broadcaster [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]] 1 has been covering the opening show live since 2007 as part of a “theme night” followed by interviews with famous guests after the opening, attracting around 400,000 viewers each year. Since 2007, the opening show has also been broadcast on [[3sat]] with a time delay. In 2008, Austrian channel [[Puls 4]] also had a live broadcast of the Ball after ORF's live broadcast. The new German TV station [[TIMM (TV)|TIMM]] covered the event in 2009 in a 4-hour non-stop program, for which the ORF signal was used in part.&lt;ref&gt;Doris Priesching: Deutsche schauen mit, derstandard.at, May 15, 2009; Der Standard, May 16/17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Organizer and founder Gery Keszler is the “face” and engine of the Life Ball. It is also mainly his achievement that fashion representatives and celebrities of the entertainment industry such as [[Roseanne Barr]], [[Elton John]], [[Catherine Deneuve]], [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Sharon Stone]], [[Dita von Teese]], [[Anastacia]], [[Heidi Klum]], [[Naomi Campbell]] and [[Jenna Jameson]] attend the opening show. Some play an active role in the event’s program, others just enjoy the party and celebrate. Gery Keszler chose the Vienna city hall as venue because he found it had great symbolic value. He felt that it should be part of the Viennese ball tradition, but be more provocative and glamorous.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wieninternational.at/de/node/3828 Life Ball 2007 - Gespräch mit Gery Keszler] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528164731/http://www.wieninternational.at/de/node/3828 |date=2009-05-28 }}, wieninternational.at, April 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He was given the opportunity to present his project to then mayor [[Helmut Zilk]]. Zilk was convinced of the positive effect of such an event and gave it a try. He agreed to let Keszler have the festival hall in the Vienna city hall and supported him despite all opposition.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Petra Stuiber: [http://derstandard.at/3224011/Das-empfinde-ich-als-feige ‘’Das empfinde ich als feige’’] – Interview with Gery Keszler, derstandard.at &amp; print edition, February 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Zilk’s stance was remarkable as support for this cause was not something that could be taken for granted at that time. There were also doubts as to whether the event would be a success. For Keszler it was exciting and nerve-wrecking until the opening, because the first guests arrived rather late.

The first Life Ball took place on May 29, 1993. In addition to the Vienna city administration, the event had only two sponsors. The ATS 1,100,000 (EUR 79,940) raised by the first Ball were donated to the [[non-profit organization]] AIDS LIFE, which was founded by Gery Keszler and Torgom Petrosian in 1992, to support other organizations helping people who are HIV-positive or have AIDS. Ever since the first Life Ball, a fashion show, then presented by [[Thierry Mugler]], has become a key feature of the event. In the second year, at the Life Ball on May 28, 1994, the money raised through donations, [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsoring]] and ticket sales was doubled. The first two Balls were covered by TV stations in Austria and Germany. The third Ball on May 6, 1995, already attracted interest from French and Spanish broadcasters as well as [[MTV]]. In the subsequent years, the number of guests attending the opening show and the Ball as well as the number of journalists, radio stations, print media articles and sponsors rose steadily. This also increased the funds raised by the Life Ball to be donated to AIDS projects and research. In 1999, the Vienna city hall was renovated and the Ball took place in the [[Hofburg]] palace.

A cornerstone was accomplished at the 8th Life Ball on May 13, 2000: it was the first time the funds raised broke the ATS 10,000,000 (EUR 726,728) barrier. It was also the first Ball at which the opening show took place on the city hall square and was publicly accessible. The next year, for the first time projects in Africa (cf. HIV/AIDS in Africa) were supported through a cooperation with the [[Elton John Aids Foundation]] (EJAF) – Elton John was himself a regular guest at the event from 2001 to 2005 and also held the opening speeches. The 13th Life Ball on May 21, 2005, for the first time exceeded the EUR 1 million mark with a total of EUR 1,017,600 generated by ticket sales, catering, auctions, raffle, stamp and record sales and the contributions of various donors and sponsors. Half of the proceeds are donated to international projects. Since 2006, the [[American Foundation for AIDS Research]] ([[amfAR]]), which was founded by [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and whose current president is [[Sharon Stone]], has been a cooperation partner of the Life Ball. The main focus in 2006 was on the fight of HIV and AIDS in babies and toddlers.

Compared to today, the Life Ball started as a small event from the gay community. In contrast to other events attended by Keszler back then, it was never intended to be an event only for the gay scene or jet-setters. It combines Viennese ball tradition with fancy-costume queer balls. Some of the gay community supported the project greatly, especially when it was still in its infancy, e.g., Café Berg (since its opening). However, the Ball has attracted a majority of heterosexual guests for some time now, and also many companies make a contribution. To avoid the potential worst case – that gay people do not get tickets to an event which had its origins in the gay scene—the lesbian and gay community has had a ticket quota for some years. Even though the Life Ball has not been a mere “gay” event for some time, just as much as AIDS is no longer a “gay” epidemic, it still has this reputation. The attribute “gay” has, however, not been detrimental to revenue. When not discussed in the equal rights context, “gays are considered creative and fun—and are said to throw better parties”, which is a money-making cliché. Moreover, trend expert Bernhard Heinzlmaier adds that “it is considered hip to move in a gay environment. It indicates an open and modern set of mind.” In addition to the charity aspect, the “gay hipness” surrounding the heterosexual guests is therefore another reason for donations. The [[homosexuals]] in Austria alone would not be a big enough crowd to get companies to make such generous donations.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Thomas Rottenberg: [http://derstandard.at/3340174 Heteros Freude mit dem Homo-Etikett], derstandard.at, May 16, 2008; print edition: June 17/18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

At least two celebrity couples met at the event: Austrian professional swimmer [[Markus Rogan]] and then Miss Austria [[Christine Reiler]] met at the 2007 Ball in which they both participated in the fashion show as models.&lt;ref&gt;MisterMadonna: [http://misterworld.blogspot.com/2007/05/life-ball-2007.html Life Ball 2007] – programme, misterworld.blogspot.com, May 2nd, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; At the Life Ball 2008, they celebrated their one-year anniversary and graced the runway in a partner-look outfit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oe24.at/zeitung/leute/article305482.ece Life Ball 2008: Rogan &amp; Reiler - Liebesjubiläum am Laufsteg], oe24.at, May 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The same night, TV presenter [[Nazan Eckes]] and Julian Khol, the Düsseldorf-based Austrian model, art student, and son of politician [[Andreas Khol]], also met.&lt;ref&gt;Johnny Stühlinger: [http://www.seitenblicke.at/stars/starstories/tag/03182009/er-macht-mich-so-gluecklich/ Julian Khol: Nazan Eckes streut ihm Rosen - "Er macht mich so glücklich!"], seitenblicke.at, March 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2000 to 2007, a wedding chapel for couples of any [[sexual orientation]] with famous “show priests” was hosted together with Austrian TV channel ATV to point out the unequal treatment of heterosexual and homosexual couples.

On the occasion of the XVIII [[International AIDS Conference]] that is beginning one day after the big event in Vienna, this year’s Life Ball will be very special. On the 17th of July Europe’s biggest AIDS charity event not only takes place in the Vienna City Hall and on City Hall Square, but also at the [[Burgtheater]] (the former imperial court theatre) and the [[Parliament of Austria|Parliament]].  The “concept of the three houses” unites three extraordinary events and important organizations; the [[amfAR]] gala in the Parliament, the [[Elton John AIDS Foundation]] at the Red Ribbon Cotillion in the Burgtheater, and the [[William J. Clinton Foundation]] at the traditional Life Ball in the Vienna City Hall. With the support of many different personalities these three events together set a clear signal for tolerance and solidarity.

Access to the Life Ball is extremely limited. Each year, thousands of requests for Life Ball Tickets are received and few are granted to this exclusive experience. Recently, the Life Ball opened their doors to international guests who want to attend. A few international travel representatives have been selected to exclusively represent a region in offering travel packages to the Life Ball.

A notable event at the 2013 Life Ball was  [[Barbara Eden]] appearing, wearing her [[Jeannie (I Dream of Jeannie)|Jeannie]] outfit.

In November 2015, Keszler said that there would be no Life Ball in 2016, and that the next ball would be held in the summer of 2017. However, the Red Ribbon Cotillion will still be held that year. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.thelocal.at/20151102/life-ball-to-take-creative-break-in-2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaigns==

The event is usually accompanied by a number of campaigns. In 2006, guests from western Austria could for the first time make use of a dedicated “[[Ö3]] Life Ball Express” train with a special party carriage and shuttle buses that brought them to Vienna’s city hall, and also the specially modified “Life Ball Party Plane” premiered in 2008, flying in guests and media representatives from [[New York City]] to Vienna, already setting the right mood for the Ball. The dance club Volksgarten, located not far from the Ball venue, hosts the Life Ball Party and the after hour in the early hours of the morning for all those who did not get tickets to the Ball itself. The money from these campaigns also goes to the Life Ball. Also, there is a “[[Diners Club]] Life Ball” credit card carrying the Red Ribbon design, which automatically transfers 0.5% of each transaction to AIDS LIFE.

===Special issue stamps===

Limited edition stamps on the occasion of the Life Ball have been issued for a number of years now. The 2005 stamp bore [[Heidi Klum]]’s picture, followed by [[Naomi Campbell]] in 2006. In that year, also a limited edition of stamps featuring Naomi Campbell in comic style was sold on [[eBay]]. German supermodel [[Nadja Auermann]] was the face of the 2007 Life Ball stamps.

Since 1995, when Paris Premiere and a Spanish TV station joined the media crowd, the Life Ball has been broadcast on a pan-European level. In 1999, American TV stations (besides MTV) made the broadcast intercontinental. Internet TV started reporting on the event in 2001. Since 2002, stricter accreditation criteria have been applied and the number of media representatives has been limited to 500 due to capacity restrictions. In 2004, the first South African TV teams reported live from the Ball.

Except for one Sunday in 2002, the Ball has always taken place on a Saturday. And apart from a short stint at [[Hofburg]] palace in 1999 due to renovations, the venue of the Ball has always been Vienna’s city hall. Since 2000, the opening ceremony and the fashion show have taken place on the square in front of the city hall. The opening speech has been held by international celebrities since 2001.

==Amount donated==

The Life Ball is the most important source of income for AIDS LIFE. Since its inception, margins from annual proceeds and from the total sum of subsidized projects have been profitably invested to be able to finance national projects for another year, should the Life Ball have to be canceled one year. As proceeds are impossible to forecast, the organization does not finance infrastructure costs of the projects it supports, such as rent, personnel expenses, and operating costs. A failure of AIDS LIFE to produce financial support must not result in the cancellation of a project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifeball.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=55&amp;Itemid=2&amp;lang=en|title=Life Ball - Fighting Aids &amp; Celebrating Life|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 24, 2007, two days before the Life Ball, a formal dinner with [[Bill Clinton]] which was also attended by Austrian President [[Heinz Fischer]] and then Austrian Chancellor [[Alfred Gusenbauer]] was held in the Great Gallery of [[Schönbrunn Palace|Schönbrunn]] Palace. With the support of major Austrian companies, the total amount of donations could be raised even further. After dinner, guests enjoyed the Concert for Europe played by the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] in the palace’s park and a check worth USD 1 million was presented to Clinton for the HIV/AIDS initiative (CHAI) of his [[William J. Clinton Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wien.orf.at/stories/195040/ AIDS-Charity-Gala - Bill Clinton auf Kurzbesuch in Wien], wien.orf.at, May 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The same program was planned for 2008 but had to be canceled because Clinton was busy with the [[US primaries]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wien.orf.at/stories/277741/ Leute - Bill Clinton verschiebt "Aids Life Charity Gala"], May 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, nine full-time employees of the Life Ball have worked on the acquisition of donations in money and kind and coordinated all volunteers and participants over the course of a year. There are almost 1,000 partners and staff for catering alone.[10] A special audit of finances from 1994 to 2008 by auditing firm Hübner &amp; Hübner in 2009 confirmed Life Ball’s proper financial conduct. At a press conference, Andreas Röthlin also made it clear that “as opposed to many other charitable organizations, AIDS LIFE is very efficiently managed, also and especially with regard to expenses.” At this occasion, AIDS LIFE also received the “Österreichisches Spendengütesiegel” (Reg. Nr. 05685), a quality seal for NPOs awarded by the Austrian auditors’ chamber, valid as of August 24, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://diepresse.com/home/leben/mensch/505591/index.do?from=gl.home_leben Wirtschaftsprüfung entlastet Life Ball-Organisator], diePresse.com, September 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marion Hauser: [http://kurier.at/nachrichten/1935251.php "Trete als Aids-Life-Obmann zurück"], Kurier.at, September 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

“Because Gery Keszler’s 14th AIDS charity night was indeed great. But: that does not mean anything, as it is an intrinsic characteristic of the Life Ball to be super. In all spheres: the Life Ball is beyond criticism. Reporting about it means cheering, which is, to an extent, justified.”

– [[Der Standard]], May 21, 2006

“Some political gay rights activists and “fundamentalists” are skeptical about the way the idea and the ball are turned into a lifestyle and are diluted, but nobody speaks up to voice criticism.”&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Gery Keszler is well aware of the delicate balancing act between the fun factor, which in turn attracts people and companies, creates publicity and, eventually, collects as much in donations as possible, and the message to be conveyed.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; For instance, only journalists who have reported not only about celebrities but also about HIV and AIDS are accredited again. Sometimes it is criticized+ that by now also certain conservative and/or right-wing politicians show up as guests or announce to attend the Ball. Keszler believes that a ball against discrimination should not discriminate against anyone. If these people manage to secure a ticket and believe they would enjoy the event, they will certainly not be stopped from attending it. And Keszler regards their potential plan of ganging up and making “all well” again as naïve.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Research==
Benjamin's research as a historian of American psychology has focused on the metamorphosis of psychology from philosophical discourse to laboratory science.  He has written about the establishment of the earliest of the psychology laboratories, about the development of the early psychological organizations and how those fostered the agenda of the new experimental psychology, about the initial applications of experimental psychology to education, business, and clinical practice, and about the ways in which psychologists sought to inform the American public about their science.
	
Benjamin's biography of Harry Kirke Wolfe (1858-1918), the second of Wundt's American graduates, documented the struggles of the early psychology laboratories in battling the more established sciences in American universities.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, L. T., Jr. (1991).  Harry Kirke Wolfe: Pioneer in psychology.  Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press.&lt;/ref&gt; That book was nominated for both of the top prizes awarded by the [[History of Science Society]].  Benjamin has also written on other Wundt doctorates in America.  His research, based on archival records at the University of Leipzig, produced the first comprehensive treatment of Wundt's American students and their subsequent careers.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, L. T., Jr., Durkin, M., Link, M., Vestal, M., &amp; Acord, J. (1992).  Wundt's American doctoral students.  American Psychologist, 47, 123-131.&lt;/ref&gt;

As one of the markers of a scientific discipline, the early psychological organizations were key to the development of experimental psychology.  Benjamin published the first archivally based histories of the Midwestern &lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, L. T., Jr. (1979).  The Midwestern Psychological Association:  A history of the organization and its antecedents, 1902 1978.  American Psychologist, 34, 201 213.&lt;/ref&gt; and Eastern Psychological Associations,&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, L. T., Jr.  (1991).  A history of the New York Branch of the American Psychological Association, 1903-1935.  American Psychologist, 46, 1003-1011.&lt;/ref&gt; which were founded in 1902 and 1903 respectively.  He has also published articles and book chapters on the Psychological Round Table (a somewhat secret organization of experimental psychologists begun in 1936),&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, L. T., Jr. (1977). The Psychological Round Table: Revolution of 1936. American Psychologist, 32, 542 549.&lt;/ref&gt; the American Psychological Association,&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, L. T., Jr.  (1997).  The origin of psychological species: A history of the beginnings of the divisions of the American Psychological Association.  American Psychologist, 52, 725-732.&lt;/ref&gt; and Titchener's Experimentalists (precursor to the [[Society of Experimental Psychologists]]).&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, L. T., Jr. (2006).  Titchener's Experimentalists: No women allowed.  In L. T. Benjamin, Jr. (Ed.), A history of psychology in letters (2nd ed.), pp. 125-138.  Malden, MA: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;  Central to this work on organizational history is an understanding of the roles these societies played in the research careers and social and intellectual lives of those involved (and, in some cases, those who were excluded), and ultimately the role they played in shaping the course of American psychology.

Benjamin has also published extensively on the beginnings of applied psychological research in business (e.g., his research on the early forays into advertising and product testing),&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, L. T., Jr.  (2004).  Science for sale: Psychology's earliest adventures in American advertising.  In J. D. Williams, W. N. Lee, &amp; C. P. Haugtvedt (Eds.), Diversity in advertising: Broadening the scope of research directions (pp. 22-39).  Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, L. T., Jr., Rogers, A., &amp; Rosenbaum, A. (1991).  Coca-Cola, caffeine, and mental deficiency: Harry Hollingworth and the Chattanooga trial of 1911.  Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences, 27, 42-55.&lt;/ref&gt; education (e.g., work on child study and teaching machines),&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, E. S., &amp; Benjamin L. T., Jr.  (1987).  A history of the child study movement.  In J. Glover &amp; R. Ronning (Eds.) Historical foundations of educational psychology (pp. 41-60).  New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, L. T., Jr. (1988). A history of teaching machines.  American Psychologist, 43, 703 712.&lt;/ref&gt; and clinical psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, L. T., Jr. (2005).  A history of clinical psychology as a profession in America (and a glimpse at its future).  Annual Review of Clinical Psychology, 1, 1-30.&lt;/ref&gt;  This work has documented the nineteenth century origins of applied psychology and its manifestation in a profession of psychology in the twentieth century.  His book From Seance to Science: A History of the Profession of Psychology in America (coauthored with David Baker) &lt;ref&gt;Baker, D. B., &amp; Benjamin, L. T., Jr. (2014).  From séance to science: A history of the profession of psychology in America (2nd ed.). Akron: University of Akron Press.&lt;/ref&gt; was the first comprehensive history of professional psychology.

Finally, Benjamin is one of the leading figures writing on the history of psychology's public image, focusing on public understanding of psychology and the ways in which psychologists have sought to convey the nature and importance of their science to the public and to distinguish it from the popular psychology so often embraced by the public.  This work has emphasized the social context in America that shaped the interests of psychologists and in turn shaped America's understanding of and attitudes toward psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, L. T., Jr. (1986).  Why don't they understand us? A history of psychology's public image.  American Psychologist, 41, 941 946.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wood, W., Jones, M., &amp; Benjamin, L.

Rieber (Ed.), Encyclopedia of the history of psychological theories (pp. 22-47).  New York: Springer-Science.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10002">'''Malbec World Day''' is celebrated on April 17, to commemorate the day when president [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]] of [[Argentina]] officially made it his mission to transform Argentina's wine industry. On that day, back in 1853, he tasked [[Michel Aimé Pouget]], a French soil expert, to bring over new vines. Amongst his selection, was [[Malbec]].&lt;ref name="Wine pg 840-844"&gt;A. Domine (ed) ''Wine'' pg 840-844 Ullmann Publishing 2008 {{ISBN|978-3-8331-4611-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pouget continued experimenting with the adaptation of French varietals to Argentina’s diverse terroirs. A decade later, [[Great French Wine Blight|France underwent a Phylloxera Plague]] that affected the [[Rhône]] region. The name, "Malbec World Day", translates from the Spanish "Día Mundial del Malbec" meaning "Malbec throughout the world". Somehow, the name stuck and continues to confuse English speakers to this day, as most just end up calling it "World Malbec Day", or "Malbec Mondo" for those who like the alliteration. In the mean time, Malbec flourished in Argentina creating wines widely superior to those of its country of origin.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 421"&gt;{{cite book|editor= [[Jancis Robinson]] | title=The Oxford Companion to Wine| edition= 3rd |page=421|publisher= Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many decades later, in 1956, France faced another obstacle: a freeze wiped out the majority of Malbec vineyards.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 421"/&gt;

In the following years, specifically during the '90s, Argentina positioned Malbec as their star varietal. More than 10.000 acres were planted and it became the undeniable leader of the country’s exportations.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 421"/&gt; Wine lovers around the world, especially in the United States, discovered and praised Argentine Malbec.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The history of Malbec|url=http://malbecworldday.com/history/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331225548/http://malbecworldday.com/history/|archivedate=2015-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

In 2011, [[Wines of Argentina]], responsible for communicating the Argentine wine brand around the world, established April 17 as Malbec World Day. Lis Clément, their Head of Marketing and Communications at the time, founded this day because she was convinced this celebration would help position Malbec as one of Argentina’s wine gems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El camino del Vino|url=https://revistapaco.com/2014/07/21/el-camino-del-vino/|website=https://revistapaco.com|publisher=Revista Paco|language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malbec World Day, KW dijo presente!|url=http://www.kickwines.com.ar/2013/04/23/malbec-world-day-kw-dijo-presente/|publisher=Kick Wines|accessdate=25 March 2015|language=Spanish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402144913/http://www.kickwines.com.ar/2013/04/23/malbec-world-day-kw-dijo-presente/|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excellent quality, ever surprising and diverse, Argentina’s Malbec would lead the way to position Argentina as one of the main oenological centers of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=40 Vinos Argentinos en el Top 100 Wine Spectator|url=http://www.mdzol.com/nota/575203-40-vinos-argentinos-en-el-top-100-wine-spectator/|accessdate=25 March 2015|agency=MDZ Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current Development ==

Nowadays, more than 60 cities around the world (coordinated by the Foreign Affairs Office of Argentina) host events around Malbec, Argentine food and lifestyle. Each year, a theme is created to link Malbec and Argentine culture. This framework allows every celebration to be creative and adapt to each country’s idiosyncrasy. Malbec was first planted in France, then reached its highest point of development in Argentina and is currently travelling the world over to manifest itself as one of the key players in the international wine industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LIGHTS, CAMERA, MALBEC!!!|url=http://www.winesofargentina.org/noticias/ver/2015/03/14/lights-camera-malbec-malbec-y-cine-una-propuesta-para-agudizar-los-sentidos-y-descubrir-la-cultura-argentina/|website=http://www.winesofargentina.org/|publisher=Wines of Argentina|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2012 ==

The cities of [[New York City]], [[Toronto]] and [[Ottawa]] simultaneously hosted "crushing parties" with Argentine grapes, with the intention of producing a special Malbec wine, which will be used for toasting at the 2012 edition of the Malbec World Day.&lt;ref name="malbecworldday"&gt;{{cite web | title = Malbec World Day events| publisher = malbecworldday.com| url = http://www.malbecworldday.com/events.html| accessdate = 2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harpers"&gt;{{cite web | title = Wines of Argentina declares 'Malbec World Day'

'''Medical [[malpractice]]''' is a legal cause of action that occurs when a medical or health care professional deviates from standards in his or her profession, thereby causing injury to a patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proving a Medical Malpractice Case I – Proving Negligence (Part II)|url=https://www.physiciansweekly.com/proving-a-medical-malpractice-case-i-proving-negligence-part-ii/|website=Physician's Weekly|accessdate=13 December 2017|date=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical malpractice law==
In [[common law]] jurisdictions, medical malpractice liability is normally based on the laws of [[negligence]].&lt;ref name="marcus"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marcus|first1=Paul|title=Book Review of Medical Malpractice Law: A Comparative Law Study of Civil Responsibility Arising from Medical Care|journal=Hastings International and Comparative Law Review|date=1981|pages=235–243|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/facpubs/1138/|accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the laws of medical malpractice differ significantly between nations, as a broad general rule liability follows when a health care practitioner does not show a fair, reasonable and competent degree of skill when providing medical care to a patient.&lt;ref name="marcus"/&gt; If a practitioner holds himself out as a specialist a higher degree of skill is required.&lt;ref name="marcus"/&gt; Jurisdictions have also been increasingly receptive to claims based on [[informed consent]], raised by patients who allege that they were not adequately informed of the risks of medical procedures before agreeing to treatment.&lt;ref name="marcus"/&gt;

As laws vary by jurisdiction, the specific professionals who may be targeted by a medical malpractice action will vary depending upon where the action is filed. Among professionals that may be potentially liable under medical malpractice laws are,
* Medical Practitioners - including physicians, surgeons, psychiatrists and dentists. 
* Nurses, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brock|first1=Douglas M.|last2=Nicholson|first2=Jeffrey G.|last3=Hooker|first3=Roderick S.|title=Physician Assistant and Nurse  Practitioner Malpractice  Trends|journal=Medical Care Research and Review|date=2016|pmid=27457425|url=https://www.tdia.com/docs/shared-limits-vs-separate-limits-for-nps-and-pas|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Allied health professions|Allied health professionals]] - including physiotherapists, osteopaths, chiropractors, podiatrists, occupational therapists, social workers, psychologists, pharmacists, optometrists, midwives, and medical radiation practitioners.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Medical Liability|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/financial-services-and-commerce/medical-liability-medical-malpractice-2013-legislation.aspx|website=National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=23 November 2017|date=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NPDB Research Statistics|url=https://www.npdb.hrsa.gov/resources/npdbstats/npdbStatistics.jsp|website=National Practitioner Data Bank|publisher=U.S. Health Services &amp; Resources Administration|accessdate=23 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oliphant|first1=Ken|last2=Wright|first2=Richard W.|title=Medical Malpractice and Compensation in Global Perspective|date=2013|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=3110270234|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TsrmBQAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the acts or omissions that may potentially support a medical malpractice claim are the failure to properly diagnose a disease or medical condition, the failure to provide appropriate treatment for a medical condition, and unreasonable delay in treating a diagnosed medical condition.&lt;ref name="el"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Medical Malpractice Law|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/malpractice/malpractice.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=13 December 2017|date=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some jurisdictions a medical malpractice action may be allowed even without a mistake from the doctor, based upon principles of [[informed consent]], where a patient was not informed of possible consequences of a course of treatment and would have declined the medical treatment had proper information been provided in advance.&lt;ref name="el"/&gt;

The [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] decided in 2018 that the duty of care extended to information given to patients by clerical staff. A patient at [[Croydon Health Services NHS Trust]]'s emergency department suffered severe brain damage having been given misleading information by staff at reception.  He was told that he would be seen by a doctor in four or five hours and left the hospital, when actually he would be seen inside 30 minutes by a triage nurse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Serious consequences' for NHS after negligence ruling over receptionist's advice |url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/quality-and-performance/serious-consequences-for-nhs-after-negligence-ruling-over-receptionists-advice/7023550.article? |accessdate=12 November 2018 |publisher=Health Service Journal |date=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Litigation===
In many jurisdictions, a medical malpractice lawsuit is initiated officially by the filing and service of a [[summons]] and [[complaint]]. The parties subsequently engage in [[Discovery (law)|discovery]],"&lt;ref name="marcus" /&gt; a process through which documents such as medical records are exchanged, and depositions are taken by parties involved in the lawsuit. A deposition involves the taking of statements made under oath about the case. Certain conversations are not discoverable due to issues of [[Privilege (evidence)|privilege]], a legal protection against discovery,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but most conversations between the parties and witnesses are discoverable.

==Consequences==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11207">The '''Missouri Department of Social Services''' ('''DSS''') is a state agency of [[Missouri]]. It has its headquarters in the Broadway State Office Building in [[Jefferson City, Missouri|Jefferson City]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.dss.mo.gov/contactdss.htm DSS Agency Contact Information]." Missouri Department of Social Services. Retrieved on July 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The department operates the state's social services.

Missouri Governor Mel Carnahan established the [http://www.dss.mo.gov/partner.htm Family Investment Trust (FIT)] in November 1993, which was changed to [http://www.mofact.org/ Family and Community Trust (FACT]) by Governor Bob Holden in April 2001. FACT, which is housed within the Missouri Department of Social Services, is designed to lead a collaborative effort to improve the conditions of Missouri’s families and communities. It is also to encourage a collaborative effort among both private and public community entities to build local support systems.

The Department of Social Services partners with families and communities to protect children, rehabilitate youth and move families to self sufficiency so that Missourians can lead safe, healthy and productive lives. Administrative responsibility for agency activities rests with a department director appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the state Senate.

Agency programs are managed through its functional divisions. The department maintains field offices in each Missouri county and in the City of St. Louis.

Twenty-one Caring Community organizations were established around Missouri to implement this approach with six core results: parents working, children safe, children ready for school, children and families health, children and youth succeeding in school, and youth ready to enter the work force. FACT is the nonprofit corporation that governs the 21 partnerships. Funding to support this work comes from the state legislature through the Department of Social Services and is a combination of general revenue and a federal match.

There are currently 20 community partnerships across Missouri, including [[St. Louis Area Resources for Community and Human Services|Area Resources for Community and Human Services]] (ARCHS) in St. Louis, Local Investment Commission (LINC) in Kansas City, and more. 


==Program Divisions&lt;ref&gt;[http://dss.mo.gov/contactdss.htm DSS Agency Contact Information]." Missouri Department of Social Services. Retrieved on January 25, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;==
* Family Support Division (FSD)
The Family Support Division (FSD) exists to provide a continuum of support for families. FSD’s goal is to assist families in maintaining or improving their quality of life. FSD accomplishes this goal for the children and families of Missouri by providing the best possible services to the public.

FSD services include: Income Maintenance programs, including the Food Stamp, Temporary Assistance and Medicaid programs; Rehabilitation Services for the Blind; and the Child Support program. Other programs include: Community Services Block Grant Programs; Low Income Home Energy Assistance; Refugee Resettlement; and Supplemental Nursing Care.

* Child Support (CS):
The Family Support Division (FSD) helps families by providing the following services:

Establish Paternity — FSD can help establish paternity (legal fatherhood) for children born to unmarried parents. If the parents are certain “dad” is the child’s father, all the parents need to do is sign an Affidavit Acknowledging Paternity. If the paternity of the child is uncertain, FSD can arrange for a paternity test. If the test shows the man to be the child’s father, FSD or the court may enter an order establishing paternity.

Establish Support Orders — FSD establishes child and medical support orders when a support order does not exist. When determining the amount of the child support payment, FSD staff use the child support guidelines established by the Missouri Supreme Court. The guidelines consider the income of both parents. The Missouri Child Support Amount Calculation Worksheet (Form 14) is used to calculate the child support amount.

Review Support Orders - FSD also reviews existing child and medical support orders to determine if the orders should be changed. 

On a Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) or MO HealthNet case, Child Support either performs a review on its own or at either parent’s request. On non-TANF cases, Child Support conducts reviews if requested.

Enforce Support Orders — FSD helps families receive their child, medical and spousal support by:
◾Withholding income (wages, Workers’ Compensation benefits, unemployment compensation benefits, etc.);
◾Intercepting federal and state income tax refunds;
◾Ordering employers to enroll noncustodial parents’ children in health care plans;
◾Reporting noncustodial parents who owe past–due support to credit bureaus;
◾Filing liens on personal and/or real property;
◾Intercepting lottery winnings;
◾Suspending licenses (drivers, recreational, professional);
◾Asking the prosecuting attorney to file civil contempt or criminal non–support charges upon request by the applicant for services; and
◾Working with other states to collect support when noncustodial parents live outside Missouri.

Who is eligible for child support services?

The Missouri Family Support Division (FSD) is a state agency that provides child support services to:
◾Custodial parents - parents who live with the children.
◾Noncustodial parents - parents who do not live with the children.
◾Custodians - relatives or non-relatives if the non-relative has legal custody or guardianship.
◾Adult children - persons between the ages 18–21.
◾Alleged fathers - men whose fatherhood is in question.
◾The legal representative of the custodial parent’s/custodian’s estate when that person is deceased &lt;ref&gt; "http://modss.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/714057-overview-of-child-support-services". Missouri Department of Social Services.  Retrieved January 29, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

* Children's Division (CD):
The Children’s Division (CD) works in partnership with families, communities, the courts and other governmental entities toward assuring the safety, permanency, and well-being of Missouri’s children. The Division’s guiding principles are Protection, Partnership, Permanency, Practice Excellence, Prevention and Professionalism. The division works with all parties to safely maintain children in their homes whenever possible and to secure safe, permanent living arrangements when out-of-home placement is necessary. The Children’s Division administers the Child Abuse/Neglect Hotline, School Violence Hotline, Intensive In-Home Services, Family Centered Services, Adoption Services, Independent Living, Foster Care, Residential Licensing and preventive services including Early Head Start, Stay-at-Home Parent Program, Child Care Start-Up and Expansion Program, Child Care Subsidy, and other early childhood and early intervention strategies. The division is responsible for the assessment and investigation of all reports to the Child Abuse/Neglect Hotline.
* MO HealthNet Division (MHD)
The MO HealthNet Division (MHD) administers the MO HealthNet (Missouri Medicaid) program. MO HealthNet provides medical services to eligible participants within defined program benefits in somewhat the same way insurance companies provide coverage for their policyholders. The services provided include those required by the federal government such as hospital and physician services. Also included are optional services such as pharmaceutical and personal care services authorized by the Missouri General Assembly and identified in state statute. A mandatory Medicaid managed care program is in place for eligible participants in the eastern, central, and western areas of the state. Children, pregnant women, TANF families, and children in state custody receive their medical care through managed care organizations, allowing the state to ensure access to health care and control costs at the same time. 

The MO HealthNet Pharmacy Program oversees outpatient prescription drug reimbursement. The pharmacy benefit includes reimbursement for all drug products of manufacturers who have entered into a rebate agree with the Federal Department of Health and Human Services and that are dispensed by qualified providers, with few therapeutic category exclusions. In addition, MHD is responsible for program development, benefit design and clinical policy decision-making with activities oriented towards wellness and continuum of care. The MO HealthNet program includes specialized services for specific populations within the state by receiving waiver authority from the federal government. Home and community-based waivers for the elderly, certain developmentally disabled participants, as well as patients with AIDS were obtained and allow the MO HealthNet program to pay for otherwise non-covered home care as an alternative to more expensive institutional care. These services are restricted to those participants who would otherwise require, and whose home care is no more expensive than, institutionalization.

* [[Missouri Division of Youth Services]] (DYS)
The Division of Youth Services’ (DYS) mission is to protect communities from juvenile offenders in the division’s care and custody and to provide appropriate services to youth and their families. This balanced approach to juvenile justice relies on community partnerships for the development and enhancement of services for the prevention of delinquency. DYS programs are established to provide the mandated services enumerated in Chapter 219.016 in the Revised Statutes of the state of Missouri. These services include assessment, care and treatment, and education of all youth committed to its care. DYS is charged with the care and treatment of youth committed to its custody by one of the 45 Missouri juvenile courts. Towards this end, DYS operates treatment programs ranging from non-residential day treatment centers through secure residential institutions. Additionally, DYS administers the Interstate Compact on Juveniles, operates an accredited school program, and maintains a statewide statistical database of juvenile court referrals. DYS is administratively organized into one central office and five regional offices.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9015">The term '''"Nicholson challenge"''' refers to a set of mandates that the former (2006-2012) leader of the [[National Health Service in England]], [[David Nicholson (civil servant)|Sir David Nicholson]], has put forth to the entirety of the NHS in a drive to find "efficiency savings" amidst a [[UK economy]] in upheaval.

The parameters of the "challenge" by Nicholson to the NHS collectively add up to a demand by Nicholson for the NHS to find £20 billion in "efficiency savings" by 2015. The claim is that better ways of working rather than more spending must be found, amidst a warning that if the challenge were not met, either more money would be needed or fewer desirable results would be achieved.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The [[Health and Social Care Bill 2011]]'s provisions, which greatly alter the fundamentals of NHS ''functioning'' (not just financing), is technically not a part of this "challenge" at all, but is happening separately. The Nicholson challenge keeps NHS law and regulations as they have been prior to the Health And Social Care Bill's passage, but asks staff and administrators to find these "savings" within those present parameters nevertheless.

==Problems==
{{quote|The NHS faces unprecedented financial pressures, and there are growing worries that patient care will suffer. For social care, it will be increasingly difficult for councils to make further savings without directly cutting services or affecting quality. Health and care services have coped well until now, but it is clear that many organisations expect things to become much more difficult over the coming year [2013]. ([[John Appleby (economist)|John Appleby]] of the [[King's Fund]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/Health-Care-News/nicholson-challenge-putting-pressure-on-care--the-kings-fund Nicholson challenge putting pressure on care – The King’s Fund]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Doctors and nurses across the NHS already complained early in 2011 that front-line NHS services of many different types were having to be cut immediately, and very heavily, in order to achieve these "savings", despite Nicholson alleging that they would not have to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7610848/Cuts-being-made-to-frontline-NHS-services-survey-reveals.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Rebecca | last=Smith | title=Cuts being made to frontline NHS services survey reveals | date=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/apr/12/nhs-chief-intervenes-ambulance-job-cuts | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Denis | last=Campbell | title=NHS chief intervenes as 560 ambulance jobs axed | date=2011-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; NHS workers still insist, up to the present day, that it is impossible to find these types of 'savings' in this amount of time without having to make drastic cutbacks to existing services. Even a late-March 2012 news article dealing with the [[risk register]] of the [[Health and Social Care Bill 2011]] found fit to mention a few lines about the Nicholson Challenge's £20bn target, mentioning that in the 2010-dated risk register, "Civil servants ... rate highly the danger that the £20bn savings may not materialise as managers lose focus and ... quality of patient care suffers", even though "Ministers [today in 2012 say] that a report to be published on Tuesday shows that the NHS is on course to meet the so called "Nicholson challenge" to save £20bn over the course of this parliament."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/27/health-reforms-damage-nhs-risk-register | location=London | work=The Guardian | first1=Nicholas | last1=Watt | first2=Randeep | last2=Ramesh | title=Health reforms could damage NHS, warns draft risk register | date=2012-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 October 2011, the allegations by doctors and nurses of a direct and immediate decline in care as a result of the Nicholson Challenge was backed up by research when ''[[The Guardian]]'' published an exposé revealing how the Nicholson Challenge is "really affecting the young, old and infirm".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/oct/17/revealed-toll-cuts-nhs-services | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Denis | last=Campbell | title=Revealed: how NHS cuts are really affecting the young, old and infirm | date=2011-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC released a 3 February 2012 article stating that twelve [[London]] [[NHS Foundation Trust|hospital trusts]] were already "not financially viable" to withstand the pressures of current cost-saving measures plus the ultimate goals cited by the Nicholson Challenge. The article reports that those with knowledge of these trusts' financial performance allege that to remain viable the local total collection of 18 area hospital trusts alone would have to make a total of £1.2bn in efficiency savings by 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-16880196 | work=BBC News | title=Twelve London hospital trusts 'not financially viable' | date=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; including £421m in nursing cuts.

On 10 February 2012, ''[[The Independent]]'' reported that the NHS spent £195 million on redundancy payments in 2010/11 and expected to spend £616.6 million on these payments in 2011/12. It is estimated that between 9,100 and 16,800 staff will be made redundant; apparently, these costs are accounted for in the £20 billion savings target of the Nicholson Challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/cost-of-nhs-redundancies-over-600m-6700154.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first1=Jane | last1=Kirby | first2=Alan | last2=Jones | date=2012-02-10 | title=Cost of NHS redundancies 'over £600m'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 July 2012, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that the [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]] has been saying that the NHS will need to find "an extra £20bn a year by 2020" — a figure the IFS itself essentially admits is ironic given that the Nicholson Challenge's £20bn in 'savings' is meant to be completed by 5 years prior to that point, in 2015. The article states that the IFS reports that "England's NHS budget squeeze [from the Nicholson Challenge] is already the "tightest four-year period for the last 50 years". NHS spending will be essentially flat in real terms - at about £110bn a year - until 2015." Because of these shifts and the long-term financial hardship the IFS is saying these circumstances will cause, the IFS suggests in its report that from 2015 through 2020 a solution the NHS might have to consider could include "...a mixture of charging, tax rises and perhaps even greater borrowing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Randeep Ramesh, Social affairs editor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jul/04/nhs-20-billion-pounds-2020?intcmp=239 |title=NHS will need extra £20bn a year by 2020, says thinktank &amp;#124; Society &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date=2012-07-04 |accessdate=2012-12-23 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; If what the IFS alleges becomes actual government policy, then it will be thereafter be unclear how either the government or the NHS would be able to reconcile the instituting of monetary charges from patients with the first fundamental NHS pillar, in place since its founding in 1948, which insists unequivocally that the NHS must be, and must remain, "free at the point of use".

==Defending the challenge==

Defenders of the "challenge", such as James Ball of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', point out that health service finance directors had already been fully aware, since the summer of 2009, of the kind of constraints that would have to be dealt with because of the UK [[debt crisis|deficit crisis]].  Nicholson first signalled his challenge in June 2009 while the UK government was under the previous administration, that of [[Gordon Brown]] and the policy received the full support of the then Secretary of State Andy Burnham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/5524693/NHS-chief-tells-trusts-to-make-20bn-savings.html | location=London | work=The Telegraph | first=James | last=Ball | title=NHS chief tells trusts to make £20bn savings  | date=2009-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012 the Guardian revealed a commercial sector report which, with significant irony, estimated that private companies can  expect to benefit from £20 billion worth of income from the privatisation of health services resulting from the Health and Social Care Act 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Campbell|first=Denis|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/16/health-firms-nhs|title=Health firms told to get set for £20bn NHS bonanza |date=16 September 2012 |accessdate=18 Dec 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of nursing in the Philippines''' stems from the [[caregiving]] provided by [[Women in the Philippines|women]], priests, and herb doctors during precolonial [[Philippines]]. This trend continued during the Spanish colonial era, although women did not have much opportunity to be formally educated in schools because only a limited number of [[Filipino women]] received primary education in charitable institutions established by Spaniards. During the Philippine revolution, Filipino women also became the providers of care for wounded revolutionaries. During the American period in the Philippines, Filipino women were given the chance to become educated as nurses, guided by their American nurse and missionary mentors, until nursing became a full-pledged profession in the Philippines, a professional career not only for modern-day women in the country but also for [[men in the Philippines]] (as [[Men in nursing|male nurses]]).

The advance of nursing in the Philippines as a career was pioneered by a culture of care which was intrinsic in the Filipino people. This was also the case even before Spanish colonization in communities. The way the health system was delivered also evolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rogado|first1=Isabelita C|title=Nursing in the Philippines|journal=Nihon Shuchu Chiryo Igakukai Zasshi|volume=13.3|pages=229|accessdate=October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early Philippines===
Early beliefs of health and illness in the Philippines were in conjunction with beliefs of mysticism and superstitions.&lt;ref name="nursing portal"&gt;Nursing Portal Philippines {{cite web |url=http://www.nursing.ph/history-of-nursing-in-the-philippines.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509213148/http://www.nursing.ph/history-of-nursing-in-the-philippines.html |archivedate=2010-05-09 |df= }}. Retrieved 2012-06-07.&lt;/ref&gt; The cause of a disease was believed to be either another person, who was an enemy, or a witch, or evil spirits. [[Filipinos]] were careful not to upset other people or the evil spirits for the good of their health. These evil spirits could be driven away by people with the power to banish demons: priests or herb doctors. Filipinos who became sick were usually cared for by their female family members or friends in the home.&lt;ref name="empire"&gt;Choy, Catherine Ceniza. (2003).{{cite web |url=http://www.nursing.ph/history-of-nursing-in-the-philippines.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509213148/http://www.nursing.ph/history-of-nursing-in-the-philippines.html |archivedate=2010-05-09 |df= }}.''Empire of Care'' . Google e-book preview. Retrieved 2012-06-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

People thought health was directly related to many superstitions and legends. Back then, there were no medical professionals but men known to practice magic and the supernatural. These herb men were known as “herbicheros.” Victims who suffered from unidentified illnesses were thought to be cursed by witches and wizards known as “mangkukulam/mangagaway.” Dangerous birthing and “pamao” were thought to come from “nunos”. While in labor, the “mabuting hilot” (good midwife) was usually present. If the birth became too dangerous, bad omens and evil sorcerers were thought to be the cause. Exploding gunpowder from a bamboo cane near the head of the person going through the suffering would usually get rid of the bad omen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Nursing in the Philippines|url=http://nurseslabs.com/philippine-nursing-history/|website=Nurselabs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish colonial rule===
During Spain's colonial rule (1521-1898) the Philippine education system offered distinct and unequal opportunities for Filipinos based on gender. An example of this [[sexism]] was allowing only limited numbers of women to receive primary education in Spanish charitable institutions.&lt;ref name= "empire" /&gt; Without an education women were unable to gain much knowledge or power. The knowledge of caring for others came from family members and personal experience with the sick. Nursing other individuals was seen as a task, not a job or a profession. During the Spanish regime many specialized hospitals were established to care for the Spanish king’s soldiers and civilians.&lt;ref name="nursing portal" /&gt; To many elite Filipinos, the Spanish colonial hospitals were places where those who were not so fortunate to have homes, spent their last days until death.&lt;ref name= "empire" /&gt;

===Philippine Revolution===
At the time of the [[Philippine Revolution]] many women transformed their homes into quarters to nurse Filipino soldiers and revolutionaries.&lt;ref name= "nursing portal" /&gt;  One of these women was [[Melchora Aquino]], also known as the "mother of the Philippine Revolution". In her old age of about 80, Aquino was a supporter of the revolution by providing food and shelter to the revolutionists. She provided care for those who became sick or wounded. However, a few days after the revolution began, she was arrested by the Spaniards for providing care to the rebels. Because she did not reveal any information to the Spanish about the location of the rebel leader, Aquino was deported to Guam in the Marianas. After six years of exile, she was able to return in 1903, when the Philippines finally gained independence from the Americans. Aquino’s work caring for the ill and the wounded during the revolution has brought comparisons to the British [[Florence Nightingale]]. Both these women cared for soldiers during war and paved the way for nursing practice.&lt;ref&gt;Renato Perdon [http://mnnetherlands.com/dir/_page/101744/].''200 Year Birth Anniversary of Melchora Aquino: Mother of Philippine revolution”.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American colonial rule ===
Although the Philippines had gained independence from [[Spain]], the [[United States]] began to instill their power upon the islands, and a conflict broke out between the [[Filipino people|Filipinos]] and the Americans. This was the start of the [[Philippine–American War]]. The presence of Americans played a vital role in influencing the development of nursing into a profession. Nurses and missionaries from the United States came to act as nurse mentors for the Filipina women. Nursing education, like teaching and missionary work in the Philippines, provided white American women with a sense of purpose in the colony.&lt;ref name= "empire" /&gt; This influence then continued with the building of many hospitals where American nurses took charge and Filipino women began to learn under careful eyes. 

An example of this was the development of the [[Iloilo Mission Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;Pedregosa, Elmer (2001). ''History of Iloilo Mission Hospital''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901, through the efforts of Dr. and Mrs. Andrew J. Hall, missionaries of the [[Presbyterian]] Foreign Mission Board from the United States, a temporary bamboo clinic was erected at Calle Amparo (now Ledesma Street), [[Iloilo City]], to serve as a venue for the treatment of health care to the very poor. This was made possible because Andrew Hall was a doctor and his wife was a nurse. Like other professions, nursing in the Philippines evolved only from the apprenticeship system.

This system laid the foundation upon which the Union Mission Hospital Training School for Nurses (now [[Central Philippine University College of Nursing and Allied Health Sciences|Central Philippine University College of Nursing]]) was built in 1906. Between the time that this school was built and the time that the Philippines gained their independence from [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|US colonial rule]] in 1946, the nursing profession continued to grow with the development of more nursing schools and more Filipina women seeking to become nurses.&lt;ref name= "nursing portal" /&gt; While taking advantage of these learning opportunities Filipinos began to learn more about the United States and the opportunities that the country could hold for them, such as extending their education and increased pay. This began the migration of nurses to the US. As individuals began travelling to and from the US, the stories they brought home began to spark the interest of others to follow.&lt;ref&gt;Choy, Catherine Ceniza. (2010). ''Nurses Across Borders: Foregrounding International Migration in Nursing History''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-colonial Philippines===
After World War II, when Manuel Roxas assumed the presidency of the Republic of the Philippines on July 4, 1946, it officially marked the end of the colonialism between the US and the Philippines. Like much of the rest of the world, the Philippine islands were in ruins and Roxas was determined to rebuild his country. He made it clear to his constituents that the new government was still going to rely heavily on US financial support in order to rehabilitate its national economy. Roxas’ first attempts to balance the Philippines' budget included collecting unpaid taxes, reducing expenses and promoting foreign trade, which would include the exportation of Filipino nurses. Already trained by Americans, Filipino nurses were the perfect candidates to assist the US and other countries experiencing post-World War II shortages.  At the time in the Philippines there were also rumors of a nursing shortage; however, this was questionable, due to the expanding health programs, inefficient use of nurses' time and skills, and loss of qualified nurses to other countries. By the mid-1960s, Filipino nurses were entering the US by the thousands.&lt;ref name= toil&gt;Brush, Barbara. ( 2010). ''The Potent Lever of Toil: Nursing Development and Exportation in the Post colonial Philippines''&lt;/ref&gt; 
The benefit to the travelling nurses was that they were able to make nearly 20 times as much as they had earned back home. Part of this money would be sent back to their families as remittance, which would boost the Philippine economy. A negative effect of the high exportation rate was that the nurses were adding to their own country's nursing shortage problem. The Philippines also faced losing one of its greatest sources of social capital: educated workers. The negative effects were also seen in the US, as American salaries decreased because Philippine nurses who newly arrive would work the same job at a lower wage.

=== Early 1900s ===
Many US states passed reforms in licensure for nurses. Decreased training mandates were created, as well as stricter adequacies for getting into a nursing institution. For instance, one prerequisite was at least one year of high school education. The idea of having students work in a more active role prior to seeing patients was a new idea that was beginning to pay off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reyes|first1=Eric Estuar|title=Placing Work, Home, and Empire in Filipino America: A Review Essay|journal=Journal of Asian American Studies|date=2005|volume=8.1|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Philippines, it was also the early 1900s when the first school for nursing was established. The program of study was still shattered and unclear. Only a few students were enrolled informally in this kind of education. A legislation or law was needed at the time, contributing to the establishment of the "First True Nursing Law" in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Republic Acts|url=http://www.gov.ph/section/republic-acts/|website=Republic of the Philippines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Today ===
{{see also|History of Philippine nurses in the United States}}
The Philippines is the leader in exporting nurses to meet the demands of the United States and other developed nations. It has been argued, however, that the Philippines' persistent production of nurses for the global market is a state strategy to develop an export industry for economic development. Things such as immigration services and nursing licensing authorities encourage the production of nurses for export.&lt;ref name=toil/&gt;

== Brief profile of healthcare ==
Of all registered health practitioners, nurses are among the largest group, even though there are very few nursing positions or jobs available to them. Only 15-25% of jobs in the Philippines are provided for the nursing population. The remainder of the work force go on to seek out other professional career opportunities outside the country.  Per year, the national government has approximately 18,000 nursing positions with an eventual turnover of 1,000 careers. The increase of Filipino nurses overseas has attracted the curiosity of other countries to better understand nursing in the Philippines and what makes Filipino nurses accommodating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NURSING  and MIDWIFERY DATA BANK The Philippines|url=http://www.wpro.who.int/hrh/about/nursing_midwifery/db_philippines_2013.pdf|website=Philippine Nursing and Midwifery Data Bank|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
The first two years of general education is grounded on liberal arts that strengthen the values and character of the person as a caregiver. The language of instruction in all local institutions is English.  This prepares the student for licensure both locally and internationally. This also gives the nurses access to ever-growing literature in the health sciences. The community skills, competence and confidence in the use of English certainly contribute to healthcare in any setting. The curriculum also strengthens the students' capabilities to participate in research in nursing and other health sciences, provides flexibility in the openness to the use of new teaching approaches, and encourages active involvement in extension work that reaches out to the other sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BS in Nursing in the Philippines|url=http://www.finduniversity.ph/majors/bs-in-nursing-philippines/|website=FindUniversity.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;
All registered nurses in the Philippines are required to have a [[Bachelor of Science in Nursing|bachelor's degree in nursing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nurseimmigrationusa.com/FAQs/FaqsSearch.asp?keyword=board|title=Nurse Immigration Information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first pursuit to constitute the nursing practice was made by the Director of Health in 1913, but was not officially enacted upon by the Filipino legislature. In 1915, Act No. 2493 was made known; this amended Gov Ph Act 310 so nursing could be practiced. This law allowed "for the registration of graduate nurses under the Bureau of Health" (Philippines). Pre-qualifications were not mandatory in order to become an RN since nurses simply signed up. Each candidate, however, needed to be at least 20 years of age at the time of sign up, and be of adequate health and upstanding character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Giron-Tupas|first1=Anastacia|title=History of Nursing in the Philippines|journal=Manila: University Book Supply|date=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; A law that allowed the practice of nursing was reformed in April 1919. Act 2808, also known as "the First True Nursing Law", established the Board of Examiners for Nurses. The first board exam for nurses was given in 1920.

Today, nurses must acquire their degrees through a combination of competency-based and community-oriented courses. The Philippine curriculum has several advantages compared with those of other Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) institutions. This kind of education offers much more than a solely skill-based curriculum can (Rogado 229). The four-year requirement to earn a bachelor's degree in nursing meets the minimum entry requirement for professional nursing practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rogado|first1=Ma. Isabelita C|title=Nursing in the Philippines|journal=Nihon Shuchu Chiryo Igakukai Zasshi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal regulation==
The [[Professional Regulation Commission (Philippines)|Professional Regulation Commission]] (PRC) oversees the licensing of registered nurses as authorized by the Philippine Nursing Act of 2002.

The Professional Regulatory Nursing Board implements and enforces the Nursing Act. The board is composed of a chairperson and six additional members, all of whom are nurses with at least a [[Master of Science in Nursing|master's degree]] and ten years of nursing experience. The board inspects nursing schools, conducts licensure examinations, issues and monitors certificates of licensure, promulgates a code of ethics, participates in recognizing nursing specialty organizations, and prescribes guidelines and regulations governing the profession under the Nursing Act.

In 2009, the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]] of the Philippines released a report showing the top 20 nursing schools in the country, based on the average passing rates on nursing board examinations. The top 20 nursing schools in the Philippines with 1000 or more examinees are the following:

Blood can be centrifuged using a tabletop centrifuge for at least 10 min at 3000 revolution per minute. The resultant product consists of the following three layers; topmost layer consisting of platelet poor plasma, PRF clot in the middle, and red blood cells at the bottom.

===Socket preservation===
[[Socket preservation]], a procedure to reduce bone loss after [[tooth extraction]] to preserve the [[dental alveolus]] (tooth socket) in the [[alveolar bone]]. A platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) membrane containing bone growth enhancing elements can be stitched over the wound or a graft material or scaffold is placed in the socket of an extracted tooth at the time of extraction. The socket is then directly closed with stitches or covered with a non-resorbable or resorbable membrane and [[Surgical suture|sutured]].

===Sinus lift===
A platelet-rich fibrin can be used if a [[sinus lift]] is required for a [[dental implant]].&lt;ref name="TajimaOhba2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tajima|first1=Nobutaka|last2=Ohba|first2=Seigo|last3=Sawase|first3=Takashi|last4=Asahina|first4=Izumi|title=Evaluation of Sinus Floor Augmentation with Simultaneous Implant Placement Using Platelet-Rich Fibrin as Sole Grafting Material|journal=The International Journal of Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Implants|volume=28|issue=1|year=2013|pages=77–83|issn=0882-2786|doi=10.11607/jomi.2613}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SimonpieriChoukroun2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simonpieri|first1=Alain|last2=Choukroun|first2=Joseph|last3=Corso|first3=Marco Del|last4=Sammartino|first4=Gilberto|last5=Ehrenfest|first5=David M.

===Periodontal regeneration===
Reproduction or reconstitution of a lost or injured part to restore the architecture and function of the periodontium becomes the integral part of comprehensive periodontal therapy. Conventional [[open flap debridement]] falls short of regenerating tissues destroyed by the disease. [[Platelet derived growth factor]] along with bone morphogenetic proteins are among the most researched growth factors in periodontal regeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Darby|first1=IB|title=A systematic review of the use of growth factors in human periodontal regeneration.|journal=J Periodontol|date=2013|volume=84|pages=465–476|doi=10.1902/jop.2012.120145|pmid=22612370}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kumar|first1=RV|title=Platelet rich fibrin: A new paradigm in periodontal regeneration.|journal=Cell Tissue Bank|date=2013|volume=14|pages=453–463|doi=10.1007/s10561-012-9349-6|pmid=23143637}}&lt;/ref&gt; Platelet rich fibrin showed significant improvement in clinical periodontal parameter as well as in radiograph when compared with open flap debridement alone in a [[meta analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shah|first1=Monali|title=Effectiveness of autologous platelet-rich fibrin in the treatment of intra-bony defects: A systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=J Indian Soc Periodontol|date=2014|volume=18|pages=698–704|doi=10.4103/0972-124X|pmid=25624624}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several bone graft materials have been used in the treatment of infrabony defects. [[Demineralized freeze dried bone allograft]] (DFDBA) has been histologically proven to be the material of choice for regeneration. Platelet-rich fibrin has shown significant results comparable to DFDBA for periodontal regeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shah|first1=Monali|title=Comparative evaluation of platelet-rich fibrin with demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft in periodontal infrabony defects: A randomized controlled clinical study|journal=J Indian Soc Periodontol|date=2015|volume=19|pages=56–60|doi=10.4103/0972-124X.145803|pmid=25810594}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most common aesthetic problem encountered in the field of periodontology is gingival recession, which is, perceived by the patients as increase in length of teeth. Though connective tissue graft is a gold standard procedure, PRF can be used as an alternative procedure by keeping patient's comfort in mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mufti|first1=Sonam|last2=Shah|first2=Monali|title=Comparative Evaluation of Platelet-Rich Fibrin with Connective Tissue Grafts in the Treatment of Miller's Class I Gingival Recessions|journal=Contemp Clin Dent|date=2017|volume=8|pages=531–537|doi=10.4103/ccd.ccd_325_17|pmid=29326502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guided bone and tissue regeneration===
PRF is used in [[guided bone and tissue regeneration]].&lt;ref name="KhisteNaik Tari2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khiste|first1=Sujeet Vinayak|last2=Naik Tari|first2=Ritam|title=Platelet-Rich Fibrin as a Biofuel for Tissue Regeneration|journal=ISRN Biomaterials|volume=2013|year=2013|pages=1–6|issn=2314-4025|doi=10.5402/2013/627367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11589">'''The postpartum physiological changes''' are those expected changes that occur to the woman's body after [[childbirth]], in the [[postpartum period]]. These changes mark the beginning of the return of pre-pregnancy physiology and of [[breastfeeding]]. Most of the time these postnatal changes are normal and can be managed with medication and comfort measures, but in a few situations complications may develop.{{sfn | Henry|2016 | page = 117}} Postpartum physiological changes may be different for women delivering by [[cesarean section]].{{sfn | Davidson|2014 | page = 168}} Other postpartum changes, may indicate developing complications such as, [[postpartum bleeding]], engorged breasts, [[postpartum infections]].

==Breasts and lactation==
{{Main|Lactation}}
The physiological changes that occurred earlier in the pregnancy that prepared the breast for lactation become altered after the birth. About 2 to 5 days  after the birth the breasts begin to produce milk. This sometimes is described as "the milk coming in".{{sfn | Henry|2016 | page =120 }}  Information can be provided to the mother before the birth to enhance the understanding of breastfeeding and the support that will be available to make it successful.{{sfn|Davidson|2014| page = 161}} The mother is encouraged to breastfeed and spend time bonding with her infant immediately after the birth. Sucking causes the pituitary to release oxytocin that to contract the uterus and prevent bleeding.{{sfn | Henry|2016 | page = 117 }}{{sfn | Davidson|2014 | page = 162}} [[Progesterone]] is the hormone that influences the growth of breast tissue before the birth. The postpartum changes that occur in the endocrine system after the birth shift from hormones that prevent lactation to hormones that trigger milk production.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} This can be felt by the mother in the breasts. The crying of the infant can induce the release of [[oxytocin]] from the pituitary gland. [[Cracked nipple]]s can develop at this time and is managed with pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment.{{sfn|Henry|2016|page = 120}}

==Uterus==
{{Further|Placental expulsion}}
The most drastic change in the uterus is the contraction from an organ weighing one kilogram and a volume of about 10-L down to a 60 gram organ that only contains 5ml of fluid.{{sfn|Lyon|2009}} Immediately after delivery, the fundus of the uterus begins to contract. This is to deliver the [[placenta]] which can take up to 30 minutes and may involve a feeling of [[postpartum chills|chills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marchofdimes.org/pregnancy/stages-of-labor.aspx|title=Stages of labor|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a normal and healthy response it should feel firm and not boggy. It begins to [[Involution (medicine)|involute]] with contractions of the smooth muscle of the uterus. It will contract midline with the umbilicus. It begins its contractions and by twelve hours after the birth it can be felt to be at the level of the umbilicus.{{sfn | Henry|2016 | page =118 }} The uterus changes in size from one kilogram to 60 -80 grams in the space of six weeks. After birth, the fundus contracts downward into the pelvis one centimeter each day. After two weeks the uterus will have contracted and return into the pelvis.{{sfn | Henry|2016 | page =118 }} The sensation and strength of postpartum uterine contractions can be stronger in women who have previously delivered a child or children.{{sfn | Durham|2014 | page = 310 }}

==Cervix, vagina and perineum==
The cervix remains soft after birth. The vagina contracts and begins to return to the size before pregnancy. For four to six weeks of the postpartum period the vagina will discharge [[lochia]], a discharge containing blood, mucus, and uterine tissue.{{sfn | Henry|2016 | page =119 }}

==Immunity==
During pregnancy the normal inflammatory [[Immunity (medical)|immune response]] is shut down in order to allow the acceptance of the embryo to the body. In the postpartum period this needs to be quickly reversed back to normal. This immune reconstitution can result in the symptomatic expression of infections that were present but previously not responded to, especially infections with an autoimmune basis.{{sfn|Singh|Perfect|2007|pp=1192–9}}

==Pain control and comfort measures==
{{Main|Pain management during childbirth}}

Education and discussion before the birth can alleviate some of the fear of the unknown and the anxiety when treatments are experienced for the first time. Providing continuous updates on the status of the infant is beneficial.

Perineal pain after childbirth has immediate and long-term negative effects for women and their babies. These effects can interfere with breastfeeding and the care of the infant.{{sfn|Molakatalla|Shepherd|Grivell|2017}} The pain from injection sites and possible [[episiotomy]] is managed by the frequent assessment of the report of pain from the mother. Pain can come from possible lacerations, incisions, uterine contractions and sore nipples. Appropriate medications are usually administered.{{sfn | Henry|2016 | page = 122}} Routine episiotomies have not been found to reduce the level of pain after the birth.{{sfn|Jiang|Qian|Carroli|Garner|2017}} Comfort is enhanced with changing linens, urination, the cleaning of the perineum and ice packs. Privacy also in implemented to promote comfort.{{sfn|Davidson|2014| page = 160}}

Hemorrhoid pain can be managed with a variety of methods. Some recommendations for reducing the pain of hemorrhoids include: cleansing with warm water, hemorrhoid creams, increasing fluids, lying on the site and sitz baths.{{sfn | Davidson|2014 | page = 163}}

Medications controlling pain will begin to wear off. This also true when an epidural or spinal block was given.{{sfn|Davidson|2014| page = 161}} Uterine contractions are sometimes painful and comfort can be promoted by suggesting that different positions can be tried. Walking around, with assistance, can decrease pain. Since uterine cramping may become more painful during breastfeeding, medications can be given a half an hour before nursing. Pain control and comfort can be managed by anticipating the return of sensation and bodily reactions to bruises, tears, incisions and puncture sites.

==Management==

Immediately after the birth, on going assessments are performed with recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. They have identified that [[vital signs]] of blood pressure, and pulse, uterine position, and bleeding should be assessed every 15 minutes for the first two hours after birth.{{sfn | Henry|2016 | page=117}}{{sfn| Davidson|2014 | page = 160 }} The temperature is then measured twice, four hours and eight hours after birth.

==Nutrition==
The caloric needs will changed based upon the production of milk for the infant. The caloric requirement for a non-breastfeeding, non-pregnant woman changes from 1,000-2,000 kcal/day to 2,300 to 2500 kcal/day for the breastfeeding woman. Nutritional supplementation is often prescribed and recommended. In some instances women are encouraged to continue to take pre-natal vitamins. Increasing the intake of fluids is discussed. The need for additional levels of minerals are mostly likely due to lactation. Calcium and iron needs increase postpartum.{{sfn | Davidson|2014 | page = 165}} Calories may need to increase by 333 kcal/day during the first four to six weeks postpartum and then by 400 kcal/day 6 months postpartum.{{sfn | Davidson|2014 | page = 168}}

Other foods or substances are not recommended postpartum if breastfeeding because they may have affects on the baby via breastmilk. Some clinicians discourage the use of caffeine. This could produce fussiness in the baby. Alcohol use is strongly discouraged. Consuming fish is healthy and provides vitamins, minerals and proteins. Consumption of [[oily fish]] like haddock, herring, sardines, grouper,and tuna may need to be limited due to pollutants.{{sfn | Davidson|2014 | page = 166}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/pregnancy/should-pregnant-and-breastfeeding-women-avoid-some-types-of-fish/|title=Should pregnant and breastfeeding women avoid some types of fish?|website=nhs.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-12|date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weight loss should be monitored to ensure recovery. Quick weight loss can reduce milk supply. Low carb and high protein diets may not be appropriate. A realistic weight loss goal is one pound per week.{{sfn|Davidson|2014|page = 168}}

==Physiological changes related to cesarean section==
A urinary catheter is usually put in place before the cesarean section to prevent urinary retention. The abdominal incision will be another site for pain and possible infection. Moving out of bed may be delayed. As with any surgical procedure, the risk is higher for the development of blood clots in the legs. In these cases intermittent a pneumatic pressure device may be used or more simple compression stockings. Leg exercise will also be effective in promoting blood circulation in the legs. Higher levels of pain medication may be needed related to abdominal incisions. If the cesarean was not planned, some women will be disappointed and may benefit from encouraging counsel from clinicians.{{sfn|Davidson|2014|page=168}}

[[File:Pelvic exam nci-vol-1786-300.jpg|thumb|right|Line drawing showing part of pelvic exam procedure]]
'''Promtov's sign''', also known as "'''Promtov's symptom'''" or "'''Promptov symptom'''" is diagnostic symptom in [[gynecology]].

In case of '''Pelvic Inflammatory Disease''' ('''[[Pelvic Inflammatory Disease|PID]]'''), performing a [[Pelvic examination|bimanual gynecological examination]] is painful for patient. The patient during the examination complains of pain in the lower abdomen. In this case, patient symptoms is then called "Promtov positive". 

Pain is caused by [[Adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]] of [[connective tissue]] in the lower abdomen, which in turn is caused by inflammation (mostly [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]]) in the lower abdomen ([[Pelvic Inflammatory Disease|PID]]). It might be a consequence of '''[[Sexually transmitted disease|STD]]''', which is usually the case. Another possible course is [[endometriosis]], then the patient might also complain of strong abdominal pains during [[menstruation]]. In endometrosis, adhesions are caused by [[aseptic inflammation]].

[[Rainwater harvesting]] (RWH) is a practice of growing importance in the United Kingdom, particularly in the South East of England where there is less water available per person than in many [[Mediterranean]] countries.&lt;ref name="RWHp4"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This water is generally used for non-hygienic purposes like watering gardens, flushing toilets, and washing clothes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rainwater Harvesting and Uses in your household|url=http://www.gutterslondon.co.uk/blog/living-off-grid-public-water-supply/}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a growing demand for larger tank systems collecting between 1000-7500 litres of water. The two main uses for harvested rainwater are botanical uses, like gardening for plant irrigation, and domestic uses, like flushing toilets and running washing machines.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Rainwater is almost always collected strictly from the roof, then heavily filtered using either a filter attached to the down pipe, a fine basket filter or for more expensive systems like self-cleaning filters placed in an underground tank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://rainharvesting.co.uk/products/filters/|title=Rainwater Filters - Rainharvesting Systems|work=Rainharvesting Systems|access-date=2017-03-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; UK homes using some form of rainwater harvesting system can reduce their mains water usage by 50% or more, although a 20-30% saving is more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=SVCwater|title=Rainwater harvesting|url=http://www.svcwater.com/rainwater-harvesting-systems/|accessdate=2013-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:Kastell Housestead Latrine1.jpg|thumb|Center - Latrines of [[Housesteads Roman Fort]]; Top left - Rainwater collection tank]]

Prior to the widespread use of [[Water supply network|water mains]], RWH was a traditional means of getting water in the UK.&lt;ref name="RWHp22-23"/&gt; Even as far back as the 2nd-century AD, archaeological evidence shows that rainwater harvesting was being used by [[Housesteads Roman Fort]] in [[Northumberland]] as a way to flush the latrines.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; English castles from the 12th and 13th-century also have notable rainwater harvesting systems, such as [[Carreg Cennen castle|Carreg Cennen]],&lt;ref&gt;

In the 19th and the early 20th century, prior to widespread access to water mains, most large middle-class homes got their drinking water from springs and wells, but this water was usually [[hard water|hard]] which made it unsuitable for washing. Thus, such homes were usually designed to also harvest rainwater to be used in washing.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[interwar period]], houses in hard water areas were sometimes built with rainwater storage tanks forming the roof of a [[Scullery (room)|scullery]]. Rainwater was led down to a third tap for washing purposes.
Rainwater harvesting declined in popularity as water mains became more widespread through the early 20th century onwards.

== Current status ==
[[Image:London Velopark, 16 April 2012.jpg|thumb|The velodrome of the [[Olympic Park, London|London Olympic Park]] is designed to harvest rainwater]]

In recent years, rainwater harvesting has become more common due to increasing water prices. While rainwater harvesting has been employed in high-profile facilities like the velodrome of the [[Olympic Park, London|London Olympic Park]], the UK's ongoing revival has lagged behind other countries such as Germany (the present world leader in modern rainwater harvesting).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  At present, only about 400 RWH systems are installed in the UK every year.&lt;ref name="RWHp22-23"/&gt;

Some large retail developments are now incorporating rainwater harvesting even in some of the wetter parts of the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.marksandspencer.com/blog/stories/mands-cheshire-oaks-store---water|title=M&amp;S CHESHIRE OAKS STORE - WATER|publisher= MM&amp;S, Cheshire Oaks|access-date=31 August 2016|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rainwater harvesting was being encouraged by the government of the UK through the [[Code for Sustainable Homes]]. The code ranked homes on a scale of one through six and requires new homes to have a score of at least three. One way to raise the score of a newly designed home is to incorporate a rainwater harvesting system. The code was revoked in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Environment Agency]] has noted that water resources in the UK are under increasing pressure because of the growing population. In addition, the agency has warned that the South East of England is facing more serious [[water scarcity]] than anywhere else in England or Wales, such that the per-capita water supply is lower than many Mediterranean countries. The agency encourages a two-pronged approach to both reduce demand and increase supply, such as through the use of rainwater harvesting.&lt;ref name="RWHp4"/&gt; However, there is a fundamental mismatch between supply and demand; the areas of the UK suffering water scarcity are in most cases also areas with low rainfall, which means the economics of installing a domestic RWH system are less favourable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/74346004/UK-A-Whole-Life-Costing-Approach-for-Rainwater-Harvesting-Systems-Introduction-Bradford-University|title=A whole life costing approach for rainwater harvesting systems|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The environmental impacts of domestic RWH systems in energy terms are questioned since the water supply accounts for a very small proportion of total energy use (approximately 4%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/291745/scho0610bsmq-e-e.pdf|title=Energy and carbon implications of rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tools.energysavingtrust.org.uk/Publications2/Housing-professionals/Heating-systems/Quantifying-the-energy-and-carbon-effects-of-water-saving-full-technical-report|title=Quantifying the Energy and Carbon effects of Water Saving. Full technical report|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a UK household, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; impact of supplying water to the house is around 100g of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per day, around 1/600th of your total daily impact. However, in countries without widespread mains water supplies, or where the environmental impact of mains water is very high, RWH may have more merit.

The installation of rainwater harvesting systems in the UK should be done according to the [[Water Supply (Water Fittings) Regulations 1999|Water Supply (Water Fittings) Regulations]] and BS8515,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail/?pid=000000000030260364|title=Rainwater harvesting systems. Code of practice|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170309065852/http://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail/?pid=000000000030260364|archive-date=2017-03-09|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to ensure safety. BS8515 also provides details on how to size the storage tank and allows estimation of the potential water savings. If you install a RWH system, you will need to inform your water company.

Rainwater harvesting at large scale may well be appropriate for farms as part of a catchment management strategy to decrease flood risk and diffuse pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swarmhub.co.uk/index.php?dlrid=4291|title=Rainwater harvesting.

'''Ramakrishna Mission Vidyapith, Purulia''', [[India]], is a branch of the [[Ramakrishna Mission]]. It is a residential school for boys running under the [[Gurukul]] system. It was founded by Swami Hiranmayananda in 1957. The then chief minister of [[West Bengal]] requested [[Ramakrishna Mission]] to establish an educational institution in [[Purulia]].

'''[[Drug abuse]]''' is a major issue in [[Kenya]], especially in the city of [[Mombasa]] and especially among men in their early 20s. Women in Mombasa have held public protests, asking for better enforcement of the laws against narcotics. In Mombasa and [[Kilindini]], there are approximately 40 ''maskani'' ("location" in Swahili) where drug abusers meet to share drugs. The traditional recreational drug of choice is [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], but [[heroin]] injection is becoming increasingly popular. In a survey,{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} 70 percent of recreational drug users said they were using heroin.

==Causes==

===Unemployment and low education===
The research estimates Kenya's unemployment rate is at 40%, the 14th-highest among the 200 countries with unemployment figures. With the average Kenyan dropping out of school after 10 years this leaves many youths without productive uses for their time.

===Peer pressure===
[[Peer pressure]] is a major factor contributing towards drug abuse. Many addicts have admitted that they started using drugs because it was popular among their friends.  There is also a high probability that many of the beach boys are using drugs so that they can be able to face their clients in a smart way.

===Superstition===
It is suspected that a common reason for drug use is spiritual practises. A recent study{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} found that many young men used drugs because they believed that ghosts could not haunt the men when they were high.
The [[CIA World Factbook]] indicates&lt;ref name="cia-kenya"&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ke.html&lt;/ref&gt; that roughly 10% of Kenyans hold religious beliefs indigenous to the area, although it does not document the extent to which these beliefs involve ghosts.

==Effects==

===Crime===
Many people in Mombasa are concerned that if they walk alone they may be mugged by young men whose costly [[Substance dependence|addiction]] has driven them to criminal careers.

A '''relaxation drink''' is a non-alcoholic beverage containing calming ingredients normally found in nature. It is a functional beverage which serves to calm a person but unlike other calming beverages such as tea, relaxation drinks almost universally contain more than one active ingredient. Relaxation drinks may be served chilled and carbonated. Others have now been introduced in shot-form.

==History==
The concept of relaxation drink first emerged from Japan in 2005 when a group of products were introduced to the market enriched with [[gamma-aminobutyric acid]] (GABA). In 2007, a couple group of kitesurfers from [[Kāneʻohe Bay]] and [[Lanikai]] beach of O'ahu Hawai'i developed a drink which they dubbed the relaxation drink with their own formula containing [[gamma-aminobutyric acid]] (GABA), L-[[Theanine]] and L-[[Threonine]] providing similar calming effects found in [[kava]] or [[Valerian (herb)|valerian]] roots (rhizo) which later became known as lanilai. [[Lani (heaven)|''Lani'']] is a common [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] word meaning 'sky' or 'heaven' and ''{{lang|haw|lai}}'' means 'calm after the storm', and hence ''{{lang|haw|Lanilai}}'' carries the meaning of 'heavenly calm'. Kava roots are well known in the Pacific Islands and mostly grown in Tonga and Fiji. Kava is known to be used for social rituals and celebrations. [[Melatonin]] is another major ingredients found in relaxation drinks which also carry some controversy due to negative effects from long term use.  Relaxation drinks have been known to contain other natural ingredients. Common ingredients in relaxation drinks may contain kava root, melatonin, [[Valerian (herb)|valerian]] root, [[gamma-aminobutyric acid]] (GABA), [[Chamomile]], [[Melissa officinalis]], L-[[Theanine]], L-[[Threonine]], [[5-Hydroxytryptophan]] or [[Passiflora]].  Relaxation drinks are usually free of [[caffeine]] and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] but some have claimed to contain [[marijuana]].

==Function==
Relaxation drinks are formulated to help reduce stress, anxiety, improve focus, and promote better sleep. Relaxation drinks can be considered the anti-energy drink and have found a niche alongside energy drinks. Some relaxation shots, particularly those with L-theanine, have been known to be used alongside [[coffee]] as a way to counter some of the jittery-feeling [[caffeine]] can produce.

==Uses==
In many scenarios, people use relaxation drinks for dealing with stressful situations, after a work day, after strenuous exercise or before bed time. Further uses have also included aiding anxiety relief. Studies have found that ingredients found in relaxation drinks can help promote [[alpha wave]] brain wave patterns to improve focus.  Depending on the formulation, relaxation drinks may promote [[Rapid eye movement sleep]] (REM) sleep.

Relaxation drinks have been known to reduce stress, anxiety and calm nervousness due to their calming effects on the nervous system.

People who are allergic to alcohol, recovering from alcohol abuse or have liver problems have resorted to drinking relaxation drinks because its ability to calm nerves and provides what people call a "buzz" however it is alcohol free which does not bring about the well known [[hangover]].  This is all dependent on the nutritional content which varies from one relaxation drink to another.  There are reports of melatonin causing this next-day grogginess feeling.

People with [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) have been known to use relaxation drinks to substitute for [[Dexedrine]] because of the properties to help focus thoughts. {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Some relaxation drinks can cause drowsiness and should not be taken while driving or operating heavy machinery.

'''TA-NIC''' is a proprietary [[vaccine]] in development similar to [[TA-CD]] but being used to create human anti-nicotine [[antibody|antibodies]] in a person to destroy [[nicotine]] in the human body so that it is no longer effective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celticpharma.com/theportfolio/ta-nic.html CelticPharma: TA-NIC Nicotine Dependence.]&lt;/ref&gt;

TA-NIC is a vaccine in development as an aid to [[quitting smoking]] in motivated patients. TA-NIC is an immunotherapeutic vaccine similar in concept to TA-CD, designed to raise anti-nicotine antibodies. The antibodies bind to nicotine molecules in the patient's blood stream, reducing the rate and quantity of nicotine entry into the [[brain]] and thus reducing the [[positive reinforcement]] and [[addiction]] associated with nicotine and [[tobacco smoking|cigarette smoking]]. It is expected that the reduction of the positive reinforcement will in turn reduce the desire to smoke or use other [[tobacco products]].
Treatment with TA-NIC is expected to be part of a comprehensive smoking cessation management program that includes other supportive measures.

'''Transpersonal psychology''' is a sub-field or "school" of psychology that integrates the [[spirituality|spiritual]] and [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] aspects of the human experience with the framework of modern psychology. It is also possible to define it as a "spiritual psychology". The ''[[transpersonal]]'' is defined as "experiences in which the sense of  identity or self extends beyond (trans) the individual or personal to encompass wider aspects of humankind, life, psyche or cosmos".&lt;ref name="Walsh &amp; Vaughan 1993"&gt;Walsh, R. &amp; Vaughan, F. "On transpersonal definitions". ''Journal of Transpersonal Psychology'', 25 (2) 125-182, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been defined as "development beyond conventional, personal or individual levels".&lt;ref&gt;Scotton, Bruce W. "Introduction and Definition of Transpersonal Psychiatry". In Scotton, Bruce W., Chinen, Allan B. and Battista, John R., Eds. (1996) ''Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology''. New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues considered in transpersonal psychology include spiritual [[Human Potential Movement|self-development]], self beyond the ego, [[peak experience]]s, [[mysticism|mystical experiences]], [[trance|systemic trance]], spiritual crises, spiritual evolution, [[religious conversion]], [[altered states of consciousness]], spiritual practices, and other sublime and/or unusually expanded experiences of living. The discipline attempts to describe and integrate spiritual experience within modern psychological theory and to formulate new theory to encompass such experience.

Transpersonal psychology has made several contributions to the academic field, and the studies of human development, consciousness and spirituality.&lt;ref name="Miller 1998"&gt;Miller, John J. "Book review: Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology." ''Psychiatric Services''  April 01, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scotton, Chinen and Battista 1996"&gt;Scotton, Bruce W., Chinen, Allan B. and Battista, John R., Eds. (1996) ''Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology''. New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt; Transpersonal psychology has also made contributions to the fields of psychotherapy&lt;ref name="Matthews 1999"&gt;Matthews, Charles O.

==Definition==

Lajoie and Shapiro&lt;ref name="Lajoie and Shapiro, 1992"&gt;Lajoie, D. H. &amp; Shapiro, S. I. "Definitions of transpersonal psychology: The first twenty-three years". ''Journal of Transpersonal Psychology'', Vol. 24, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; reviewed forty definitions of transpersonal psychology that had appeared in academic literature over the period from 1968 to 1991. They found that five key themes in particular featured prominently in these definitions: ''states of consciousness''; ''higher or ultimate potential''; ''beyond the ego or personal self''; ''transcendence''; and ''the spiritual''. Based upon this study the authors proposed the following definition of transpersonal psychology: ''Transpersonal Psychology is concerned with the study of humanity's highest potential, and with the recognition, understanding, and realization of unitive, spiritual, and transcendent states of consciousness''.

In a review of previous definitions Walsh and Vaughan&lt;ref name="Walsh &amp; Vaughan 1993"/&gt; suggested that transpersonal psychology is an ''area of psychology that focuses on the study of transpersonal experiences and related phenomena. These phenomena include the causes, effects and correlates of transpersonal experiences and development, as well as the disciplines and practices inspired by them''. They have also criticised many definitions of transpersonal psychology for carrying implicit assumptions, or presuppositions, that may not necessarily define the field as a whole. {{ref|a|Note a}}

Hartelius, Caplan and Rardin&lt;ref name="Hartelius Caplan Rardin 2007"&gt;Hartelius, Glenn;  Caplan, Mariana; Rardin, Mary Anne. "Transpersonal Psychology: Defining the Past, Divining the Future". ''The Humanistic Psychologist'', 35(2), 1–26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; conducted a retrospective analysis of definitions of transpersonal psychology. They found three dominant themes that define the field: ''beyond-ego psychology'', ''integrative/holistic psychology'', and ''psychology of transformation''. Analysis suggested that the field has moved from an early emphasis on alternative states of consciousness to a more expanded view of human wholeness and transformation. This development has, according to the authors, moved the field closer to the integral approaches of Ken Wilber and Post-Aurobindonian theorists.

Caplan (2009: p.&amp;nbsp;231) conveys the genesis of the discipline, states its mandate and ventures a definition:

{{quote|Although transpersonal psychology is relatively new as a formal discipline, beginning with the publication of ''The Journal of Transpersonal Psychology'' in 1969 and the founding of the Association for Transpersonal Psychology in 1971, it draws upon ancient mystical knowledge that comes from multiple traditions. Transpersonal psychologists attempt to integrate timeless wisdom with modern Western psychology and translate spiritual principles into scientifically grounded, contemporary language. Transpersonal psychology addresses the full spectrum of human psychospiritual development&amp;nbsp;– from our deepest wounds and needs, to the existential crisis of the human being, to the most transcendent capacities of our consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Caplan|first=Mariana|year=2009|title=Eyes Wide Open: Cultivating Discernment on the Spiritual Path|publisher=Sounds True|isbn=978-1591797326|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cDX8zNEbUXoC|accessdate=5 May 2010|page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The perspectives of holism and unity are central to the worldview of transpersonal psychology.&lt;ref name="Davis 2003"&gt;Davis, John. "An overview of transpersonal psychology." ''The Humanistic Psychologist'', 31:2-3, 6-21, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the academic field==

===Origins===

Amongst the thinkers who are held to have set the stage for transpersonal studies are [[William James]], [[Carl Jung]], [[Roberto Assagioli]] and [[Abraham Maslow]].&lt;ref name="Miller 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scotton 1996"&gt;Scotton, Bruce W. "The Contribution of C.G Jung to Transpersonal Psychiatry". In Scotton, Bruce W., Chinen, Allan B. and Battista, John R., Eds. (1996) ''Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology''. New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Battista 1996"&gt;Battista, John. "Abraham Maslow and Roberto Assagioli: Pioneers of Transpersonal Psychology". In Scotton, Bruce W., Chinen, Allan B. and Battista, John R., Eds. (1996) ''Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology''. New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parsons 2003"&gt;Parsons, William B. Book Reviews:  Revisioning Transpersonal Theory. A Participatory Vision of Human Spirituality (Book). ''Journal of Religion'', 00224189, Oct. 2003, Vol.83, Issue 4.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent attention has brought to light transpersonal aspects of [[Jean Piaget]]'s untranslated French works, and argued that Piaget's transpersonal experiences and theoretical interests were a major motivation for Piaget's psychological research.&lt;ref name="Dale 2014"&gt;Dale, E. (2014) "Spiritual consciousness in the age of quantity: The strange case of Jean Piaget's mysticism". ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'', 21 (5-6) 97-117&lt;/ref&gt; A review by Vich&lt;ref name="Vich 1988"&gt;Vich, M.A. (1988) "Some historical sources of the term "transpersonal". ''Journal of Transpersonal Psychology'', 20 (2) 107-110&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the earliest usage of the term "transpersonal" can be found in lecture notes which William James had prepared for a semester at [[Harvard University]] in 1905-6. The meaning then, different from today's usage, was in the context of James' [[radical empiricism]], in which there exists an intimate relation between a perceiving subject and a perceived object, recognizing that all objects are dependent on being perceived by someone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Taylor, E. |editor1=Scotton, B.W. |editor2=Chinen, A.B. |editor3=Battista, J.R. |title= Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology |edition= 1 |date=May 1996 |origyear= 1996 |publisher= Basic Books |location= New York |isbn= 978-0465095308 |chapter= William James and transpersonal psychiatry |page= 26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators&lt;ref name="Elmer, MacDonald &amp; Friedman"&gt;Elmer, Lori D., MacDonald, Douglas A. &amp; Friedman, Harris L. "Transpersonal psychology, physical health, and mental health: Theory, research, and practice". ''The Humanistic Psychologist'', 31:2-3, 159-181, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; also mention the [[psychedelia|psychedelic]] movement, the psychological study of religion, [[parapsychology]], and the interest in Eastern spiritual systems and practices, as influences that shaped the early field of transpersonal psychology.

Another important figure in the establishment of transpersonal psychology was [[Abraham Maslow]], who had already published work regarding human peak experiences. Maslow is credited for having presented the outline of a fourth-force psychology, named transhumanistic psychology, in a lecture entitled "The Farther Reaches of Human Nature" in 1967.&lt;ref name="Judy 1994"&gt;Judy, Dwight. "Transpersonal psychology: Coming of age."  ''ReVision''. Winter 94, Vol. 16 Issue 3, p99. 2p.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 Maslow was among the people who announced transpersonal psychology as a "fourth force" in psychology,&lt;ref name="Chinen 1996"&gt;Chinen, Allan B. ''The emergence of Transpersonal psychiatry''. In Scotton, Bruce W., Chinen, Allan B. and Battista, John R., Eds. (1996) Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology. New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt; in order to distinguish it from the three other forces of psychology: [[psychoanalysis]], [[behaviorism]] and [[humanistic psychology]]. Early use of the term "transpersonal" can also be credited to [[Stanislav Grof]] and [[Anthony Sutich]]. At this time, in 1967–68, Maslow was also in close dialogue with Grof and Sutich regarding the name and orientation of the new field.&lt;ref name="Vich 1988"/&gt; According to Powers&lt;ref name="Powers 2005"&gt;Powers, Robin. Counseling and Spirituality: A Historical Review. ''Counseling and Values'', Apr 2005, Vol.49(3), pp.217-225&lt;/ref&gt; the term "transpersonal" starts to show up in academic journals from 1970 and onwards.

Both humanistic and transpersonal psychology have been associated with the [[Human Potential Movement]]. A growth center for alternative therapies and philosophies that grew out of the counter-culture of the 1960s at places like [[Esalen Institute|Esalen]], California.&lt;ref name="Aanstoos, Serlin &amp; Greening 2000"&gt;Aanstoos Serlin &amp; Greening, T.

===Formative period===
Gradually, during the 1960s, the term "transpersonal" was associated with a distinct school of psychology within the humanistic psychology movement.&lt;ref name="Chinen 1996"/&gt; In 1969, Abraham Maslow, Stanislav Grof and Anthony Sutich were among the initiators behind the publication of the first issue of the ''[[Journal of Transpersonal Psychology]]'', the leading academic journal in the field.&lt;ref name="Judy 1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chinen 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor 1992"/&gt; During the next decade significant establishments took place under the banner of Transpersonal Psychology. The ''Association for Transpersonal Psychology'' was established in 1972.&lt;ref name="Aanstoos, Serlin &amp; Greening 2000"/&gt; An international initiative, ''The International Transpersonal Psychology Association'', was founded by Stanislav Grof, and held its first conference in Iceland in 1973.&lt;ref name="Taylor 1992"/&gt; This was soon to be followed by the founding of the ''Institute of Transpersonal Psychology'', a graduate training center, in 1975 .&lt;ref name="Aanstoos, Serlin &amp; Greening 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SF Chronicle 2014"&gt;PRWeb (Press release).

Among these were Saybrook Graduate School, the California Institute of Asian Studies (now California Institute of Integral Studies), JFK University, and Naropa.&lt;ref name="Lukoff Lu 2005"&gt;Lukoff, David; Lu, Francis.

In the 1970s the field developed through the writings of such authors as Robert Frager, Alyce and Elmer Green, Daniel Goleman, Stanley Krippner, [[Charles Tart]], [[Roger Walsh]], John Welwood, and [[Ken Wilber]].&lt;ref name=" Braud Anderson"&gt;Braud, William &amp; Anderson, Rosemarie (2011).

''L.A Times'', September 14, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; According to Paulson &lt;ref name="Paulson 2004"/&gt; Wilber provided intellectual grounding for the field of transpersonal psychology. Mainly in the form of a synthesis of diverse disciplines.

Another important contributor to the field, Michael Washburn, was drawing on the insights of Jungian depth psychology.&lt;ref name="Sharma Charak Sharma 2009"&gt;Sharma, Pulkit; Charak, Ruby &amp; Sharma, Vibha. "Contemporary Perspectives on Spirituality and Mental Health". ''Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine''. 2009 Jan-Jun; 31(1): 16–23.&lt;/ref&gt; He presented his transpersonal theory in a book called ''The Ego and the Dynamic Ground'' (1988) towards the end of the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Washburn 1988"&gt;Washburn, Michael (1988). ''The Ego and the Dynamic Ground.'' Albany, New York: State University of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Smith,&lt;ref name="Smith 1995"&gt;Smith, Elizabeth D. Addressing the Psychospiritual Distress of Death as Reality: A Transpersonal Approach. ''Social Work''. May95, Vol. 40 Issue 3, p402-413.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilber (1977) and Washburn (1988) presented the major guiding theories of transpersonal development. The 1980s were also characterized by the work of Stanislav and Christina Grof, and their concept of ''spiritual emergence'' and ''spiritual emergencies''.&lt;ref name="Turner et al., 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grof &amp; Grof 1989"&gt;Grof, Stanislav &amp; Grof, Christina (Eds.) (1989) ''Spiritual emergency: When personal  transformation becomes a crisis''. Los Angeles: Tarcher.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Horrigan 2000"&gt;Horrigan, Bonnie. David Lukoff, The importance of spirituality in mental health. ''Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine'', 6.6 (Nov 2000): 80-7.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The period also reflected initiatives at the organizational level. In the early 1980s a group within APA division 32 (Humanistic Psychology) argued in favor of establishing transpersonal psychology as a separate division within the framework of the ''American Psychological Association''. A petition was presented to the APA Council in 1984, but was turned down. A new initiative was made in 1985, but it failed to win the majority of votes in the council. In 1986 the petition  was presented for a third and final time, but was withdrawn by the executive board of Division 32.&lt;ref name="Hartelius Caplan Rardin 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aanstoos, Serlin &amp; Greening 2000"/&gt; The interest group later re-formed as the Transpersonal Psychology Interest Group (TPIG), and continued to promote transpersonal issues in collaboration with Division 32.&lt;ref name="Aanstoos, Serlin &amp; Greening 2000"/&gt;

The 1990s introduced new profiles who contributed insights to the field. Among these authors we find Brant Cortright, [[Stuart Sovatsky]], [[David Lukoff]], Robert P. Turner and Francis Lu. Cortright&lt;ref name="Cortright 1997"&gt;Cortright, Brant. (1997) ''Psychotherapy and spirit: Theory and practice in transpersonal psychotherapy''. Albany, NY, US: State University of New York Press. xii 257 pp. (SUNY series in the philosophy of psychology.)&lt;/ref&gt; and Sovatsky&lt;ref name="Sovatsky, Stuart 1998"&gt;Sovatsky, Stuart (1998) ''Words from the Soul : Time, East/West Spirituality, and Psychotherapeutic Narrative''. New York: State University of New York Press (SUNY Series in Transpersonal and Humanistic Psychology)&lt;/ref&gt; made contributions to transpersonal psychotherapy. Both authors published their primary work as part of the SUNY-series.{{ref|b|Note b}}  Lukoff, Turner and Lu, writers in the clinical field, were the authors behind the proposal for a new diagnostic category to be included in the DSM-manual of the ''[[American Psychiatric Association]]''. The category was called "Psychoreligious or psychospiritual problem" and was approved by the Task Force on [[DSM-IV]] in 1993, after changing its name to ''Religious or spiritual problem''.&lt;ref name="Turner et al., 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lukoff, Lu &amp; Turner 1992"&gt;Lukoff  D, Lu F, Turner R. Toward a more culturally sensitive DSM-IV. Psychoreligious and psychospiritual problems. ''Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease'', 1992;180(11):673–682.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Wilber has been considered an influential writer and theoretician in the field of transpersonal psychology, his departure from the field was becoming more obvious during the decade of the 1990s. Although the date of his departure is unclear,&lt;ref name="Hartelius Caplan Rardin 2007"/&gt; Freeman&lt;ref name="Freeman 2006"/&gt; notes that Wilber had been distancing himself from the label of “transpersonal”, in favour of the label of “integral”, since the mid-1990s. In 1998 he formed [[Integral Institute]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

On the organizational side the decade was marked by a steady increase in membership for the ''Association for Transpersonal Psychology'', stabilizing at approximately 3000 members in the early nineties.&lt;ref name="Chinen 1996"/&gt; In 1996 the ''British Psychological Society'' (the UK professional body equivalent to the APA) established a Transpersonal Psychology Section. It was co-founded by David Fontana, Ingrid Slack and Martin Treacy and was, according to Fontana, "the first Section of its kind in a Western scientific society".&lt;ref name="Fontana Slack Treacy 2005"&gt;Fontana, David; Slack, Ingrid &amp; Treacy, Martin, Eds. (2005) ''Transpersonal Psychology: Meaning and Developments''. ''Transpersonal Psychology Review'' (Special Issue). Leicester: British Psychological Society&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniels &amp; McNutt 1997"&gt;Daniels, Michael &amp; McNutt, Brendan. "Questioning the Role of Transpersonal Psychology". ''Transpersonal Psychology Review'', Vol. 1, No. 4, 4-9. (1997) [Preprint Version]&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the decade commentators remarked that the field of transpersonal psychology had grown steadily&lt;ref name="Chinen 1996"/&gt; and rapidly.&lt;ref name="Miller 1998"/&gt;

===Later developments===
The beginning of the 2000s was marked by the revisionary project of [[Jorge Ferrer]], which is considered to be an important contribution to the field.&lt;ref name="Rowan 2008"&gt;Rowan, John. "The transpersonal in psychology, psychotherapy and counselling" (book review). ''Therapy Today'', June 2008, Vol. 19 Issue 5, p46-46. 3/5p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; His main publication from this era, ''Revisioning Transpersonal Theory - A Participatory Vision of Human Spirituality'' (2001),&lt;ref name="Ferrer 2001"&gt;Ferrer, Jorge N. (2001) ''Revisioning Transpersonal Theory. A Participatory Vision of Human Spirituality''. New York: State University of New York Press (SUNY Series in Transpersonal and Humanistic Psychology)&lt;/ref&gt; was part of the ''SUNY Series in Transpersonal and Humanistic Psychology''.
 
In 2012 the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology announced that it was changing its name to [[Institute of Transpersonal Psychology|Sofia University]]. A change that included a new profile in the academic landscape, with an expanded graduate program.&lt;ref name="PRweb 2012"&gt;Press release: "Institute of Transpersonal Psychology Becomes Sofia University. New Name Brings Broader Mission, Expanded Campus and New Programs". Palo Alto, CA (PRWEB), published online July 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Branches and related fields==
Several psychological schools, or branches, have influenced the field of transpersonal psychology. Among these schools we find the [[Analytical psychology]] of [[Carl Jung]],&lt;ref name="Miller 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scotton 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cortright 1997"/&gt; the [[psychosynthesis]] of [[Roberto Assagioli]],&lt;ref name="Miller 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Battista 1996"/&gt; and the [[humanistic psychology]] of [[Abraham Maslow]].&lt;ref name="Miller 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Battista 1996"/&gt; The major transpersonal models of psychotherapy, as reviewed by Cortright,&lt;ref name="Cortright 1997"/&gt; are the models of Ken Wilber, C.G Jung, Michael Washburn, Stanislav Grof, and Hameed Ali.

Dr. William J. Barry established transpersonal psychology as a valid action research method in the field of education through his Ph.D. thesis and development of Transformational Quality (TQ) Theory.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, W. J. (2012).  Challenging the Status Quo Meaning of Educational Quality: Introducing Transformational Quality (TQ) Theory©. ''Educational Journal of Living Theories''. 5, 1-26&lt;/ref&gt;  Applications to the areas of business studies and management have been developed. Other transpersonal disciplines, such as [[transpersonal anthropology]] and [[transpersonal business studies]], are listed in [[transpersonal disciplines]].

Transpersonal art is one of the disciplines considered by Boucovolas,&lt;ref&gt;Boucovolas, M. (1999). "Following the movement: from transpersonal psychology to a multidisciplinary transpersonal orientation". ''Journal of Transpersonal Psychology'', 31 (1) 27-39&lt;/ref&gt; in listing how transpersonal psychology may relate to other areas of transpersonal study. In writing about transpersonal art, Boucovolas begins by noting how, according to Breccia and also to the definitions employed by the International Transpersonal Association in 1971, transpersonal art may be understood as art work which draws upon important themes beyond the individual self, such as the transpersonal consciousness. This makes transpersonal art criticism germane to mystical approaches to [[creativity]]. Transpersonal art criticism, as Boucovolas notes, can be considered that which claims conventional art criticism has been too committed to stressing rational dimensions of art and has subsequently said little on art's spiritual dimensions, or as that which holds art work has a meaning beyond the individual person. Certain aspects of the psychology of [[Carl Jung]], as well as movements such as [[music therapy]] and [[art therapy]], may also relate to the field. Boucovolas' paper cites Breccia (1971) as an early example of transpersonal art, and claims that at the time his article appeared, integral theorist [[Ken Wilber]] had made recent contributions to the field. More recently, the Journal of Transpersonal Psychology, in 2005, Volume 37, launched a special edition devoted to the media, which contained articles on film criticism that can be related to this field.

Several academic fields have a strong relation to the field of transpersonal psychology. Related academic fields include [[near-death studies]], [[parapsychology]] and [[humanistic psychology]]. The major findings of near-death studies are represented in the ''Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology'',&lt;ref name="Scotton, Chinen and Battista 1996"/&gt; and in ''The Wiley-Blackwell Handbook of Transpersonal Psychology''.&lt;ref name="Rowan 2014"&gt;Rowan, John. "The Wiley-Blackwell Handbook of Transpersonal Psychology" (Book Review). ''ACPNL Magazine'', Issue 75 March 2014. The Association of Counsellors and Psychotherapists in North London&lt;/ref&gt; The near-death experience is also discussed in relation to other transpersonal and spiritual categories.&lt;ref name="Turner et al., 1995"/&gt; The major findings of [[parapsychology]] are also represented in the ''Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology'',&lt;ref name="Scotton, Chinen and Battista 1996"/&gt; and in ''The Wiley-Blackwell Handbook of Transpersonal Psychology''.&lt;ref name="Rowan 2014"/&gt;

There is also a strong connection between the transpersonal and the humanistic approaches to psychology, as indicated by the sourcebook of Donald Moss.&lt;ref name="Travis 2001"&gt;Travis, Terry A. Book Forum: Humanistic and Transpersonal Psychology: A Historical and Biographical Sourcebook. Am J Psychiatry 2001;158:667-a-668.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DeCarvalho 2003"&gt;DeCarvalho, Roy J. "Book Reviews: Donald Moss (Ed.). Humanistic and Transpersonal Psychology: A Historical and Biographical Sourcebook". ''Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences'', Vol. 39(1), 93–94 Winter 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Although transpersonal psychology is considered to have started off within,&lt;ref name="Aanstoos, Serlin &amp; Greening 2000"/&gt; or developed from humanistic psychology, many of its interests, such as spirituality and modes of consciousness, extend beyond the areas of interest discussed by humanistic theory.&lt;ref name="Elmer, MacDonald &amp; Friedman"/&gt; According to writers in the field&lt;ref name="Elmer, MacDonald &amp; Friedman"/&gt; transpersonal psychology advocates for an expanded, spiritual, view of physical and mental health that is not necessarily addressed by humanistic psychology.

A few commentators &lt;ref name="Chinen 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedman 2000"&gt;Friedman, Harris (2000) Toward Developing Transpersonal Psychology as a Scientific Field. Paper presented at Old Saybrook 2 conference, May 11–14, 2000, State University of West Georgia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedman 2002"&gt;Friedman, Harris. Transpersonal Psychology as a Scientific Field. ''The International Journal of Transpersonal Studies'', 2002, Vol. 21, 175-187.&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that there is a difference between transpersonal psychology and a broader category of transpersonal theories, sometimes called transpersonal studies. According to Friedman&lt;ref name="Friedman 2002"/&gt; this category might  include several approaches to the transpersonal that lie outside the frames of science. However, according to Ferrer &lt;ref&gt;Caplan, Hartelius &amp; Rardin. Contemporary viewpoints on Transpersonal Psychology. ''The Journal of Transpersonal Psychology'', 2003, Vol. 35, No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; the field of transpersonal psychology is "situated within the wider umbrella of transpersonal studies".

Transpersonal psychology may also, sometimes, be associated with [[New Age]] beliefs and pop psychology.&lt;ref name="Friedman 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sutcliffe 2003"&gt;Sutcliffe, Steven (2003). Category Formation and the History of 'New Age'. ''Culture and Religion: An Interdisciplinary Journal'', 4:1, 5-29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vermont Business Magazine"&gt;Casey retiring from Burlington College. ''Vermont Business Magazine'' 29.14 (Dec 01, 2001): 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor 1992"/&gt; However, leading authors in the field, among those Sovatsky,&lt;ref name="Sovatsky, Stuart 1998"/&gt; and Rowan,&lt;ref name="Rowan 2005"&gt;Rowan, John (1993) The transpersonal: psychotherapy and counselling. London: Routledge (Second edition)&lt;/ref&gt; have criticized the nature of "New Age"-philosophy and discourse. Rowan&lt;ref name="Rowan 2005"/&gt; even states that "The Transpersonal is not the New Age".&lt;ref name="Evans 1997"&gt;Evans,  Joan. "The Transpersonal - Psychotherapy and Counselling" (Book review). ''International Journal of Psychotherapy'' 2.2 (Nov 1997): 237-240.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some consider that the distinction between transpersonal psychology and the [[psychology of religion]], is fading (e.g. The Oxford Handbook of Psychology and Spirituality), there is still generally considered to be a clear distinction between the two. Much of the focus of psychology of religion is concerned with issues that wouldn't be considered 'transcendent' within transpersonal psychology, so the two disciplines do have quite a distinct focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor= Miller, L.

==Research, theory and clinical aspects==

===Research interests and methodology===
The transpersonal perspective spans many research interests. The following list is adapted from the ''[[Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology]]''&lt;ref name="Scotton, Chinen and Battista 1996"/&gt; and includes: the contributions of spiritual traditions such as [[Taoism]], [[Hinduism]], 
[[Yoga]], [[Buddhism]], [[Kabbalah]], [[Christian mysticism]], [[Shamanism]], and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] healing to psychiatry and psychology; [[meditation]] research and clinical aspects of meditation; [[psychedelics]]; [[parapsychology]]; [[anthropology]]; diagnosis of religious and spiritual problem; offensive spirituality and spiritual defenses; phenomenology and treatment of [[Kundalini]]; [[psychotherapy]]; [[near-death experience]]; religious cults; [[psychopharmacology]]; guided imagery; [[breathwork]]; [[past life therapy]]; [[Ecology|ecological survival]] and [[social change]]; aging and adult [[spiritual development]].

The research of transpersonal psychology is based upon both quantitative and qualitative methods,&lt;ref name="Davis 2003"/&gt; but some commentators, such as Taylor, has suggested that the main contribution of transpersonal psychology has been to provide alternatives to the quantitative methods of mainstream psychology.&lt;ref name="Davis 2003"/&gt;  Although the field has not been a significant contributor of empirical knowledge on clinical issues,&lt;ref name="Elmer, MacDonald &amp; Friedman"/&gt; it has contributed important quantitative research to areas such as the study of  meditation.&lt;ref name="Davis 2003"/&gt;

===Theories on human development===
One of the demarcations in transpersonal theory is between authors who are associated with hierarchical/holarchical, sequential, or stage-like models of human development, such as [[Ken Wilber]] and John Battista, and authors who are associated with Jungian perspectives, or models that include the principle of regression, such as Michael Washburn and Stanislav Grof.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

====Ken Wilber and John Battista====

The transpersonal psychology of [[Ken Wilber]] is often mentioned as an influential theoretical framework for the field.&lt;ref name="Miller 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hartelius Caplan Rardin 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elmer, MacDonald &amp; Friedman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freeman 2006"/&gt; Wilber is often regarded as a leading theorist&lt;ref name="Hartelius Caplan Rardin 2007"/&gt; and pioneer of the transpersonal movement,&lt;ref name="Miller 1998"/&gt; but he has not been actively associated with the label for quite some time. Several commentators&lt;ref name="Hartelius Caplan Rardin 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freeman 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Adams 2003"&gt;Adams, George. "Book Reviews: Revisioning Transpersonal Theory: A Participatory Vision of Human Spirituality." ''Journal of Contemporary Religion'', Vol. 18, No. 3, 2003 pp. 403–435&lt;/ref&gt; note that he has distanced himself from the transpersonal field in favour of a new model that he calls [[Integral theory (Ken Wilber)|integral]]. However, his psychological model still remains  influential to the practice and development of transpersonal psychology,&lt;ref name="Elmer, MacDonald &amp; Friedman"/&gt; and transpersonal themes remain a central part of his own work. His initial contribution to the understanding of human development was a spectrum-model of psychology,&lt;ref name="Miller 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elmer, MacDonald &amp; Friedman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharma Charak Sharma 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh Vaughan 1996"&gt;Walsh, R. &amp; Vaughan, F. ''The worldview of Ken Wilber''. In Scotton, Bruce W., Chinen, Allan B. and Battista, John R., Eds. (1996) ''Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology''. New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jerry 2003"&gt;Paul A. Jerry. "Challenges in Transpersonal Diagnosis". ''The Journal of Transpersonal Psychology'', 2003, Vol. 35, No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; originally outlined in his first books, ''The Spectrum of Consciousness'' (1977)&lt;ref name="Wilber 1977"/&gt; and ''The Atman Project - A Transpersonal View of Human Development'' (1980).&lt;ref name="Wilber 1980"/&gt; The books might superficially be described as a synthesis of east and west;&lt;ref name="Walsh 1996"&gt;Walsh, Roger. "Developmental and evolutionary synthesis in the recent writings of Ken Wilber." ''Revision'' 18 (4): 7-1 8, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; an integration of the spiritual philosophies of Hindu-Buddhist traditions with the developmental and spiritual psychologies of western academia.

Wilber's spectrum of consciousness consists of three broad developmental categories: the prepersonal or pre-egoic, the personal or egoic, and the transpersonal or trans-egoic.&lt;ref name="Miller 1998"/&gt; A more detailed version of this spectrum theory includes nine different levels of human development, in which levels 1-3 are pre-personal levels, levels 4-6 are personal levels and levels 7-9 are transpersonal levels.&lt;ref name="Cowley &amp; Derezotes 1994"&gt;Cowley, Au-Deane S. &amp; Derezotes, David. "Transpersonal Psychology and Social Work Education". Journal of Social Work Education, 10437797, Winter, Vol. 30, Issue 1, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Later versions also include a tenth level.&lt;ref name="Wilber, Ken 1995"&gt;Wilber, Ken (1995/2000). ''Sex, Ecology, Spirituality - The Spirit of Evolution''. Boston, Massachusetts: Shambhala Publications&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilber, Ken (1996). ''Brief History of Everything''. Boston, Massachusetts &amp; London: Shambhala&lt;/ref&gt; The transpersonal stages, or the upper levels of the spectrum, are the home of spiritual events and developments.&lt;ref name="Elmer, MacDonald &amp; Friedman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharma Charak Sharma 2009"/&gt; The framework proposed by Wilber suggests that human development is a progressive movement through these stages of consciousness.&lt;ref name="Jerry 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cowley &amp; Derezotes 1994"/&gt; The model implies that different schools of psychology are associated with different levels of the spectrum,&lt;ref name="Walsh Vaughan 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh 1996"/&gt; and that each level of organization, or self-development, includes a vulnerability to certain pathologies associated with that particular level.&lt;ref name="Elmer, MacDonald &amp; Friedman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jerry 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cowley &amp; Derezotes 1994"/&gt; Each level also represents developmental tasks that must be properly met, or they might lead to developmental arrest.&lt;ref name="Sharma Charak Sharma 2009"/&gt; A basic tenet of Wilber's transpersonal psychology is a concept called the "pre/trans fallacy". That is, a confusion of transpersonal progression with prepersonal regression.&lt;ref name="Walsh 1996"/&gt; According to writers in the field&lt;ref name="Walsh Vaughan 1996"/&gt; western schools of psychology have  had a tendency to regard transpersonal levels as pathological, equating them with regressive pathological conditions belonging to a lower level on the spectrum. The pre/trans fallacy describes a lack of differentiation between these two categories.

Wilbers understanding of  the levels of consciousness, or reality, ranging from matter to body to mind to soul to spirit,&lt;ref name="Freeman 2006"/&gt; or from prepersonal to personal to transpersonal,&lt;ref name="Kelly"&gt;Kelly, Sean M. Revisioning the mandala of consciousness. ''ReVision'', 02756935, Spring96, Vol. 18, Issue 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bidwell 1999"&gt;Bidwell, Duane R. "Ken Wilber's Transpersonal Psychology: An Introduction and Preliminary Critique". ''Pastoral Psychology'', November 1999, Volume 48, Issue 2, pp 81-90&lt;/ref&gt; is often referred to as the "Great Chain of Being". This overarching framework, that is adapted from the "perennial philosophy" of the worlds great spiritual traditions, is later reformulated by Wilber as the "Great Nest of Being".&lt;ref name="Freeman 2006"/&gt; That is, not just a simple linear hierarchy, but a kind of nested hierarchy, or holarchy.&lt;ref name="Walsh Vaughan 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelly"/&gt;
Human development, and evolution, is considered to move up this holarchy.&lt;ref name="Walsh Vaughan 1996"/&gt;

The 1990s marked a move into the world of integral ideas for Wilber. According to commentators he stopped referring to his work as transpersonal, in favor of the term ''integral'', by the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name="Freeman 2006"/&gt; Literature now confirms that he has shifted from transpersonal psychology to integral psychology.&lt;ref name="Hartelius Caplan Rardin 2007"/&gt; According to Brys &amp; Bokor Wilber presented major parts of his integral approach in the years 1997-2000.&lt;ref name="Brys Bokor"&gt;Brys, Zoltan &amp; Bokor, Petra (2013) Evaluation of Ken Wilber's Integral Psychology From a Scientific Perspective, ''Journal of Spirituality in Mental Health'', 15:1, 19-33&lt;/ref&gt; The integral theory included a four quadrant model of consciousness and its development, whose dimensions were said to unfold in a sequence of stages or levels. The combination of quadrants and levels resulting in an all-quadrant, all-level approach. The theory also included the concept of holon, "a whole that is simultaneously part of some other whole", and holarchy, "hierarchical holons within holons".&lt;ref name="Wilber 1997"&gt;Wilber, Ken.

Similar to the model presented by Wilber is the information theory of consciousness presented by John Battista. Battista suggests that the development of the self-system, and of human psychology, consists of a series of transitions in the direction of enhanced maturity and psychological stability, and in the direction of transpersonal and spiritual categories. His model presents a series of developmental tasks with corresponding levels of consciousness and psychopathology, and discusses therapeutic interventions in relation to the different levels and transitions.&lt;ref name="Battista  2011"&gt;Battista, John.

====Michael Washburn and  Stanislav Grof====

Michael Washburn presents a model of human development that is informed by psychoanalysis, object-relations theory, and the depth psychology of the Jungian perspective.&lt;ref name="Sharma Charak Sharma 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson 2005"&gt;Anderson, Rosemarie. "Book Review:  Washburn, Michael. (2003). Embodied spirituality in a sacred world." ''The Journal of Transpersonal Psychology'', 2005, Vol. 37, No. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson 2005"/&gt; In the context of transpersonal psychotherapy Washburn's approach has been described as a «revision of Jung's analytical psychology».&lt;ref name="Matthews 1999"/&gt; In, what is described as his seminal work, ''The Ego and the Dynamic Ground: A Transpersonal Theory of Development'' (1988/1995)&lt;ref name="Washburn 1988"/&gt; he presents a «dynamic-dialectical model of development”.&lt;ref name="Lev 2005"&gt;Lev, Shoshana (2005) "Regression in the Service of Transcendence: Reading Michael Washburn," Human Architecture: Journal of the Sociology of Self-Knowledge: Vol. 4: Iss. 1, Article 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The model is updated in later publications, such as ''Embodied spirituality in a sacred world'' (2003).&lt;ref name="Anderson 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Washburn 2003a"&gt;Washburn, Michael (2003). ''Embodied spirituality in a sacred world''. Albany, NY: SUNY Press&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Washburn transpersonal development follows the principles of a spiraling path.&lt;ref name="Anderson 2005"/&gt; Central to his model is the understanding of a dynamic ground; a deep level of the unconscious,&lt;ref name="Anderson 2005"/&gt; with spiritual qualities,&lt;ref name="Coward 1989"&gt;Harold Coward. The Ego and the Dynamic Ground by Michael Washburn (book review). Philosophy East and West, Vol. 39, No. 4 (Oct., 1989), pp. 505-507&lt;/ref&gt; that the person is in contact with in the prepersonal stage of development.&lt;ref name="Anderson 2005"/&gt; According to commentators Washburn describes three stages of human development; the pre-personal, the personal and the transpersonal,&lt;ref name="Anderson 2005"/&gt; also described as; pre-egoic, egoic and trans-egoic.&lt;ref name="Coward 1989"/&gt; In the pre-stage (up to age 5) the child is integrated with the dynamic ground. Later in life this contact is weakened, and the prepersonal stage is followed by a new stage of development where the ego is dissociated from the dynamic ground.&lt;ref name="Anderson 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coward 1989"/&gt; This happens through the process of repression,&lt;ref name="Lev 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coward 1989"/&gt; and marks the stage of adulthood,&lt;ref name="Anderson 2005"/&gt; and of the mental ego (egoic stage)&lt;ref name="Lev 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coward 1989"/&gt;

However, later in life there is the possibility of a re-integration with the dynamic ground, a trans-egoic stage.&lt;ref name="Anderson 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lev 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coward 1989"/&gt; According to Washburn this transpersonal development requires a kind of U-turn, or going back to the dynamic ground, in order for the ego to become integrated with its unconscious dynamics.&lt;ref name="Sharma Charak Sharma 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lev 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh Vaughan 1994"&gt;Walsh, R. and Vaughan F. The Worldview of Ken Wilber. Journal of Humanistic Psychology, 34(2):6-21, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect of Wasburn's model is described by commentators&lt;ref name="Walsh Vaughan 1994"/&gt; as «a going back before a higher going forth». A regression that paves the way for transcendence,&lt;ref name="Sharma Charak Sharma 2009"/&gt; and a fully embodied life.&lt;ref name="Anderson 2005"/&gt; Washburn's approach to transpersonal development is often summed up as «regression in the service of transcendence»&lt;ref name="Sharma Charak Sharma 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lev 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coward 1989"/&gt; which, according to Lev,&lt;ref name="Lev 2005"/&gt; is a "twist of the phrase, regression in the service of the ego".

Washburn has contrasted his own perspective, which he calls spiral-dynamic, to the developmental theory of Ken Wilber, which he calls structural-hierarchical.&lt;ref name="Coward 1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Washburn 2003b"&gt;Washburn, Michael. Transpersonal Dialogue : A New Direction. The Journal of Transpersonal Psychology, 2003, Vol. 35, No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The differing views of  Washburn and Wilber are mentioned by several commentators.&lt;ref name="Anderson 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coward 1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh Vaughan 1994"/&gt;

Stanislav Grof, on the other hand, operates with a cartography consisting of three kinds of territories: the realm of the sensory barrier and the personal unconscious (described by psychoanalysis), the perinatal or birth-related realm (organizing principles for the psyche), and the transpersonal realm.&lt;ref name="Freeman 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharma Charak Sharma 2009"/&gt; According to this view proper engagement with the first two realms sets the stage for an ascent to the third, transpersonal, realm.&lt;ref name="Sharma Charak Sharma 2009"/&gt; His early therapy, and research, was carried out with the aid of psychedelic substances such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin, mescaline, dipropyl-tryptamine (DPT), and methylene-dioxy-amphetamine (MDA).&lt;ref name="McConnell 1973"&gt;McConnell, James V. "Special Section: The Rediscovery of Human Nature". ''TIME magazine'', Monday, Apr. 02, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Paulson 2006"&gt;Paulson, Daryl S. "Book Review: Grof, Stan. The cosmic game: Explorations of the frontiers of human consciousness". ''The Journal of Transpersonal Psychology'', 2006, Vol. 38, No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Later, when LSD was prohibited, Grof developed other methods of therapy, such as holotropic breathwork.&lt;ref name="Paulson 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor 1994"&gt;Taylor, Eugene. "Desperately seeking spirituality". ''Psychology Today'', Nov/Dec 94 (Document ID: 1413)&lt;/ref&gt;

His early findings,&lt;ref name="Grof 1973"&gt;Grof, Stanislav. "Theoretical and empirical basis of transpersonal psychology and psychotherapy: Observations from LSD research". ''Journal of Transpersonal Psychology'', Vol. 5, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; which were based on observations from LSD research, uncovered four major types of experiences that, according to Grof, correspond to levels in the human unconscious: (1) Abstract and aesthetic experiences; (2) Psychodynamic experiences; (3) Perinatal experiences; (4) Transpersonal experiences. Grof returns to many of these findings in later books.&lt;ref name="Paulson 2006"/&gt; Psychodynamic levels, which correspond to the theory of Sigmund Freud, is the area of biographical memories, emotional problems, unresolved conflicts and fantasies. Perinatal levels, which correspond to the theories of Otto Rank, is the area of physical pain and agony, dying and death, biological birth, aging, disease and decrepitude. Transpersonal levels, corresponding to the theories of C.G. Jung, is the area of a number of spiritual, paranormal and transcendental experiences, including ESP phenomena, ego transcendence and other states of expanded consciousness. In order to bring structure to the psychodynamic and perinatal levels Grof introduces two governing systems, or organizing principles: The COEX-system, which is the governing system for the psychodynamic level, and the Basic Perinatal Matrices, which represent the birthing stages and is the governing system for the perinatal level.&lt;ref name="Paulson 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grof 1973"/&gt;

Grof applies regressional modes of therapy (originally with the use of psychedelic substances, later with other methods) in order to seek greater psychological integration. This has led to the confrontation of constructive and deconstructive models of the process leading to genuine mental health: what Wilber sees as a pre/trans fallacy does not exist for Washburn and Grof, for pre-rational states may be genuinely transpersonal, and re-living them may be essential in the process of achieving genuine sanity.&lt;ref&gt;Rothberg, D. &amp; Kelly, S. (Eds.) (1998) ''Ken Wilber in Dialogue''. Wheaton, Illinois: Quest Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stuart Sovatsky====

The idea of development is also featured in the spiritual psychotherapy and psychology of Stuart Sovatsky. His understanding of human development, which is largely informed by east/west psychology and the tradition and hermeneutics of Yoga, places the human being in the midst of spiritual energies and processes outlined in yogic philosophy. According to Sovatsky these are maturational processes, affecting body and soul.&lt;ref name="Sovatsky, Stuart 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gaur 2005"&gt;Gaur, Sunil D. Review of Words from the soul: Time, east/west spirituality, and psychotherapeutic narrative. ''Psychological Studies'', Vol 50(1), Jan 2005, 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Sovatsky adapts the concept of Kundalini as the maturational force of human development. According to his model a number of advanced yogic processes are said to assist in "maturation of the ensouled body".&lt;ref name="Sovatsky 2009"&gt;Sovatsky, Stuart. Kundalini and the complete maturation of the ensouled body. ''Journal of Transpersonal Psychology'', Vol 41(1), 2009, 1-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transpersonal theory of Jorge Ferrer===
The scholarship of [[Jorge Ferrer]] introduces a more pluralistic and participatory perspective on spiritual and ontological dimensions. In his revision of transpersonal theory Ferrer questions three major presuppositions, or frameworks for interpretation, that have been dominant in transpersonal studies. These are the frameworks of Experientalism (the transpersonal understood as an individual inner experience); Inner empiricism (the study of transpersonal phenomena according to the standards of empiricist science); and perennialism (the legacy of the perennial philosophy in transpersonal studies).&lt;ref name="Tarnas 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freeman 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferrer 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Adams 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kripal 2003"&gt;Kripal, Jeffrey J. "In the Spirit of Hermes; Reflections on the Work of Jorge N. Ferrer; Revisioning Transpersonal Theory: A Participatory Vision of Human Spirituality." ''Tikkun'', March 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jaenke 2004"&gt;Jaenke, Karen. The Participatory Turn. Review of Jorge N. Ferrer, Revisioning Transpersonal Theory: A Participatory Vision of Human Spirituality. ''ReVision'', Vol. 26, No. 4, Spring 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Although representing important frames of reference for the initial study of transpersonal phenomena, Ferrer believes that these assumptions have become limiting and problematic for the development of the field.&lt;ref name="Jaenke 2004"/&gt;

As an alternative to these major epistemological and philosophical trends Ferrer focuses upon the great variety, or pluralism, of spiritual insights and spiritual worlds that can be disclosed by transpersonal inquiry. In contrast to the transpersonal models that are informed by the "perennial philosophy" he introduces the idea of a “dynamic and indeterminate spiritual power.”&lt;ref name="Ferrer 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jaenke 2004"/&gt; Along these lines he also introduces the metaphor of the "ocean of emancipation". According to Ferrer "the ocean of emancipation has many shores". That is, different spiritual truths can be reached by arriving at different spiritual shores.&lt;ref name="Ferrer 2001"/&gt;

The second aspect of his revision, "the participatory turn", introduces the idea that transpersonal phenomena are participatory and co-creative events. He defines these events as "emergences of transpersonal being that can occur not only in the locus of an individual, but also in a relationship, a community, a collective identity or a place." This participatory knowing is multidimensional, and includes all the powers of the human being (body/heart/soul), as understood from a transpersonal framework.&lt;ref name="Ferrer 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Adams 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Washburn 2003b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kripal 2003"/&gt; According to Jaenke&lt;ref name="Jaenke 2004"/&gt; Ferrer's vision includes a spiritual reality that is plural and multiple, and a spiritual power that may produce a wide range of revelations and insights, which in turn may be overlapping, or even incompatible.

Ferrer's approach to participatory thinking has been taken-up in the context of psychoanalysis.  Drawing from Ferrer's criticisms of perennialism, Robin S. Brown&lt;ref&gt;Brown, R.S. (2017). ''[https://www.routledge.com/Psychoanalysis-Beyond-the-End-of-Metaphysics-Thinking-Towards-the-Post-Relational/Brown/p/book/9781138935181 Psychoanalysis Beyond the End of Metaphysics: Thinking Towards the Post-Relational]''. London &amp; New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; adopts the participatory paradigm as a means to fostering clinical pluralism.

===Transpersonal psychotherapy===
Early contributions to the field of Transpersonal Psychotherapy includes the approach of Walsh &amp; Vaughan. In their outline of transpersonal therapy they emphasize that the goals of  therapy includes both traditional outcomes, such as symptom relief and behaviour change, as well as work at the transpersonal level, which may transcend psychodynamic issues. Both Karma Yoga and altered states of consciousness are part of the transpersonal approach to therapy. According to Walsh &amp; Vaughan the context of karma yoga, and service, should also facilitate a process whereby the psychological growth of the therapist could provide supporting environment for the growth of the client.&lt;ref name="Keutzer 1984"&gt;Keutzer, Carolin S. "Transpersonal Psychotherapy: Reflections on the Genre". ''Professional Psychology: Research and Practice'', 1984, Vol. 15, No. 6,868-883, The American Psychological Association&lt;/ref&gt;

Several authors in the field have presented an integration of western psychotherapy with spiritual psychology, among these Stuart Sovatsky and Brant Cortright. In his reformulation of western psychotherapy Sovatsky addresses the questions of time, temporality and soteriology from the perspectives of east/west psychology and spirituality. Besides drawing on the insights of post-freudians, such as D.W. Winnicott, Sovatsky integrates his approach to psychotherapy with an expanded understanding of body and mind, informed by the philosophy of Yoga.&lt;ref name="Sovatsky, Stuart 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gaur 2005"/&gt;

Cortright, on the other hand, has reviewed the field of transpersonal psychotherapy and the major transpersonal models of psychotherapy, including Wilber, Jung, Washburn, Grof and Ali, as well as  existential, psychoanalytic, and body-centered approaches. He also presents a unifying theoretical framework for the field of Transpersonal Psychotherapy, and identifies the dimension of human consciousness as central to the transpersonal realm. He also addresses clinical issues related to meditation, spiritual emergency, and altered states of consciousness.&lt;ref name="Matthews 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cortright 1997"/&gt; According to commentators&lt;ref name="Matthews 1999"/&gt; Cortright challenges the traditional view, of Transpersonal Psychology, that a working through of psychological issues is necessary for progression on the spiritual path. Instead he suggests that these two lines of development are intertwined, and that they come to the foreground with shifting emphasis.

Within contemporary psychoanalysis it has been suggested that, from a clinical point of view, postulating a transcendent dimension to human experience is theoretically necessary in promoting non-reductive approaches to therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, R.S. (2014). An Opening: Trauma and Transcendence. ''Psychosis: Psychological, Social and Integrative Approaches'', DOI:10.1080/17522439.2014.900105.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clinical and diagnostic issues===

Transpersonal psychology has also brought clinical attention to the topic of [[spiritual crisis]]. {{ref|d|Note d}} Many of the psychological difficulties associated with a spiritual crisis are not ordinarily discussed by mainstream psychology.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Among these clinical problems are psychiatric complications related to mystical experience; [[near-death experience]]; [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]] awakening; shamanic crisis (also called shamanic illness); psychic opening; intensive meditation; separation from a spiritual teacher; medical or terminal illness; addiction.&lt;ref name="Turner et al., 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lukoff Lu Turner 1996"/&gt; The terms "spiritual emergence" and "spiritual emergency" were coined by Stanislav and Christina Grof&lt;ref name="Grof &amp; Grof 1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lukoff 2007"&gt;Lukoff, David. "Visionary Spiritual Experiences". ''Southern Medical Journal'', Volume 100, Number 6, June 2007 (Special Section: Spirituality/Medicine Interface Project)&lt;/ref&gt; in order to describe the appearance of spiritual phenomena, and spiritual processes, in a persons life.{{ref|e|Note e}} The term "spiritual emergence" describes a gradual unfoldment of spiritual potential with little disruption in psychological, social and occupational functioning.&lt;ref name="Turner et al., 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lukoff Lu Turner 1996"/&gt; In cases where the emergence of spiritual phenomena is intensified beyond the control of the individual it may lead to a state of "spiritual emergency". A spiritual emergency may cause significant disruption in psychological, social and occupational functioning.&lt;ref name="Turner et al., 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lukoff Lu Turner 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharma Charak Sharma 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yang Lukoff Lu 2006"&gt;Yang, C. Paul; Lukoff, David; Lu, Francis. "Working with Spiritual Issues". ''Psychiatric Annals'', 36:3, March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the psychological difficulties described above can, according to Transpersonal theory, lead to episodes of spiritual emergency.&lt;ref name="Turner et al., 1995"/&gt;{{ref|f|Note f}}

At the beginning of the 1990s a group of psychologists and psychiatrist, affiliated with the field of Transpersonal psychology, saw the need for a new psychiatric category involving religious and spiritual problems. Their concern was the possibility of misdiagnosis of these problems.&lt;ref name="Turner et al., 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lukoff Lu 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lukoff, Lu &amp; Turner 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lukoff 2007"/&gt; Based on an extensive literature review, and networking with the American Psychiatric Association ''Committee on Religion and Psychiatry'', the group made a proposal for a new diagnostic category entitled "Psychoreligious or Psychospiritual Problem".&lt;ref name="Turner et al., 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lukoff, Lu &amp; Turner 1992"/&gt; The proposal was submitted to the Task Force on [[DSM-IV]] in 1991. The category was approved by the Task Force in 1993, after changing the title to "Religious or Spiritual Problem".&lt;ref name="Turner et al., 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steinfels 1994"&gt;Steinfels, P. "Psychiatrists' Manual Shifts Stance On Religious and Spiritual Problems". ''New York Times'', February 10, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lu Lukoff Turner 1997"/&gt; It is included in the fourth edition of the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' ([[DSM-IV]]),&lt;ref name="Miller 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yang Lukoff Lu 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="American Psychiatric Association 1994"&gt;American Psychiatric Association.

American Psychiatric Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the authors of the proposal&lt;ref name="Turner et al., 1995"/&gt; the  new category "addressed problems of a religious or spiritual nature that are the focus of clinical attention and not attributable to a mental disorder". In their view there exist criteria for differentiating between spiritual problems and mental disorders such as psychosis.&lt;ref name="Yang Lukoff Lu 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lukoff Lu Turner 1995"&gt;Lukoff D, Lu FG, Turner R. Cultural considerations in the assessment and treatment of religious and spiritual problems.

''Psychiatric Times'', March 2003, Vol. XX, Issue 3, pp 36-39.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lukoff&lt;ref name="Lukoff 2007"/&gt; and Lu,&lt;ref name="Bender 2004"/&gt; co-authors of the category, religious or spiritual problems are not classified as mental disorders. Foulks&lt;ref name="Foulks 2004"/&gt; also notes that the new diagnosis is included in the DSM-IV-TR nonillness category (Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention).

Addition of the new category to the DSM-system was recognized by the psychiatric press,&lt;ref name="Miller 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Foulks 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bender 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Milstein 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Curlin et.al 2007"&gt;Curlin et.al - Religion, Spirituality, and Medicine: Psychiatrists and Other Physicians Differing Observations, Interpretations, and Clinical Approaches.

Chinen&lt;ref name="Chinen 1996"/&gt; notes that the inclusion marks "increasing professional acceptance of transpersonal issues", while Sovatsky&lt;ref name="Sovatsky, Stuart 1998"/&gt; sees the addition as an admittance of spiritually oriented narratives into mainstream clinical practice. Smart and Smart&lt;ref name="Smart Smart 1997"&gt;Smart, D.W &amp; Smart, J.F. DSM-IV and culturally sensitive diagnosis: Some observations for counselors. ''The Journal of Counseling and Development'', May/06/1997, Vol. 75 No. 5; p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt; recognizes the addition of the category, and similar improvements in the fourth version, as a step forward for the cultural sensitivity of the DSM manual. Greyson,&lt;ref name="Greyson 1997"&gt;Greyson, Bruce. The Near-Death Experience as a Focus of Clinical Attention. ''The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease'',  Volume 185(5) May 1997 pp 327-334.&lt;/ref&gt; representing the field of [[Near-death studies]], concludes that the diagnostic category of ''Religious or spiritual problem'' "permits differentiation of [[near-death experience]]s and similar experiences from mental disorders". In a study from 2000 Milstein and colleagues reported that their findings provided empirical evidence for the construct validity of the new DSM-IV category religious or spiritual problem (V62.89).&lt;ref name="Milstein et al. 2000"/&gt;

According to commentators&lt;ref name="Elmer, MacDonald &amp; Friedman"/&gt; Transpersonal Psychology recognizes that transcendent psychological states, and spirituality, might have both negative and positive effects on human functioning. Health-promoting expressions of spirituality include development and growth, but there also exist health-compromising expressions of spirituality.

Although the perspectives of Transpersonal Psychology has spread to a number of interest groups across the USA and Europe, its origins was in California, and the field has always been strongly associated with institutions on the west coast of the U.S.A.&lt;ref name="Hartelius Caplan Rardin 2007"/&gt; Both the Association for Transpersonal Psychology and the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology were founded in the state of California, and a number of the fields leading theorists come from this area of the USA.&lt;ref name="Hartelius Caplan Rardin 2007"/&gt;

==Reception, recognition and criticism==

===Reception===

Reception of Transpersonal psychology, in the surrounding culture, reflects a wide range of views and opinions, including both recognition and skepticism. Transpersonal psychology has been the topic of a number of academic articles and book reviews in other academic fields, including Psychiatry,&lt;ref name="Miller 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Travis 2001"/&gt; Behavioral Science,&lt;ref name="DeCarvalho 2003"/&gt; Psychology,&lt;ref name="Taylor 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharma Charak Sharma 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Team JIAAP 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Leitner &amp; Guthrie 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hilgard 1980"&gt;Hilgard, Ernest R.

(1980) "William James, the Sick Soul, and the Negative Dimensions of Consciousness: A Partial Critique of Transpersonal Psychology". ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'', XLVIII(2):191-206&lt;/ref&gt; Pastoral psychology,&lt;ref name="Bidwell 1999"/&gt; and Library Science.&lt;ref name="Boone 1998"&gt;Boone, Lucille M. "Humanistic and Transpersonal Psychology: A Historical and Biographical Sourcebook". ''Library Journal''; Dec 1998; 123, 20; pg. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

Several commentators have expressed their views on the field of Transpersonal psychology and its contribution to the academic landscape. Hilgard,&lt;ref name="Hilgard 1980"/&gt; representing the contemporary psychology of the early 1980s, regarded Transpersonal psychology as a fringe-movement that attracted the more extreme followers of Humanistic psychology. He did however remark that such movements might enrich the topics that psychologists study, even though most psychologists choose not to join the movement. Adams &lt;ref name="Adams 2002"/&gt; also observed the fringe-status of Transpersonal psychology, but noted that the work of Ken Wilber had provided the field with some amount of legitimacy. Cowley and Derezotes,&lt;ref name="Cowley &amp; Derezotes 1994"/&gt; representing the Social Work theory of the 1990s, regarded Transpersonal psychology as relevant for the development of spiritual sensitivity in the helping disciplines. Bidwell,&lt;ref name="Bidwell 1999"/&gt; representing the field of Pastoral psychology, saw Transpersonal psychology as a developing field that had largely been  ignored by his own profession. He did however believe that Transpersonal psychology could contribute to the areas of  pastoral theology and pastoral counseling. Elkins,&lt;ref name="Elkins Lu 2005"&gt;Elkins, David. "A Humanistic Approach to Spiritually oriented Psychotherapy", in Spiritually Oriented Psychotherapy, edited by L. Sperry and E. P. Shafranske, 2005, American Psychological Association&lt;/ref&gt; writing for the field of spiritually oriented psychotherapy, considered that Transpersonal psychology had grown away from its roots in the humanistic movement and that it had established its own theories and perspectives.

Taylor,&lt;ref name="Taylor 1992"/&gt; representing the field of Humanistic Psychology, presented a balanced review of Transpersonal psychology in the early nineties. On the negative side he mentioned Transpersonal Psychology's tendency toward being philosophically naive, poorly financed, almost anti-intellectual, and somewhat overrated as far as its influences. On the positive side he noted the fields integrated approach to understanding the phenomenology of scientific method; the centrality of qualitative research; and the importance of interdisciplinary communication. In conclusion he suggested that the virtues of Transpersonal psychology may, in the end, outweigh its defects. In a later article Taylor&lt;ref name="Taylor 1999"/&gt; regarded Transpersonal psychology as a visionary American folk-psychology with little historical relation to American academic psychology, except through its association with Humanistic psychology and the categories of transcendence and consciousness.

Ruzek,&lt;ref name="Ruzek 2004"&gt;Ruzek, Nicole Amity. Transpersonal Psychology's Historical Relationship to Mainstream American Psychology. Cited in Diss. Abstr. Int. B 65/04 (2004): 2081. UMI pub. no. 3129589.2&lt;/ref&gt; who interviewed founders of Transpersonal psychology, as well as historians of American psychology, found that the field had made little impact on the larger field of psychology in America. Among the factors that contributed to this situation was mainstream psychology's resistance to spiritual and philosophical ideas, and the tendency of Transpersonal psychologists to isolate themselves from the larger context.

There has been some recognition of Transpersonal psychology in the general clinical field. In 1992 [[Menninger Foundation|The Menninger Clinic]] organized its first symposium on transpersonal psychiatry. In 1994 the ''American Psychiatric Association'' included a new diagnostic category in its official manual (DSM-IV), following a proposal from clinicians associated with Transpersonal psychology and psychiatry.&lt;ref name="Chinen 1996"/&gt; There have also been a few attempts to adapt the insights of Transpersonal psychology, and psychiatry, to psychiatric residency programs. For example, in their proposal for a lecture series on religion and spirituality in Canadian psychiatric residency training, authors Grabovac &amp; Ganesan&lt;ref name="Grabovac Ganesan 2003"&gt;Grabovac, Andrea; Ganesan, Soma. "Spirituality and Religion in Canadian Psychiatric Residency Training". ''Canadian Journal of Psychiatry'', Vol 48, No 3, April 2003&lt;/ref&gt; suggest Transpersonal psychology as a session, including  spiritually transformative experiences, kundalini episodes, and spiritual emergencies as objectives for the session. In 2007 educators at the [[University of California, Davis|University of California (Davis)]] presented a new academic program for its psychiatric residents. The program was designed to improve culturally appropriate diagnosis and treatment in the Sacramento area. It included training in religion and spirituality, as well as insights from transpersonal psychiatry, as part of the PGY-3 curriculum.&lt;ref name="Psychiatric News  2007"&gt;Bender, Eve. "Cultural Diversity Curriculum Covers All Residency Years." ''Psychiatric News'', 42(9), p. 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been some recognition of Transpersonal psychology in the field of spiritually oriented psychotherapy. The first book to survey the field, published by the ''[[American Psychological Association]]'' in 2005, included a chapter on the Transpersonal–Integrative Approach to therapy.&lt;ref name="Sperry &amp; Shafranske"&gt;Sperry, Len (Ed); Shafranske, Edward P. (Ed), (2005). Spiritually oriented psychotherapy. Washington, DC, US: American Psychological Association, ix, 368 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Transpersonal psychology has also entered the classroom setting. Perspectives from Transpersonal psychology are represented in  a widely used college textbook on personality theories,&lt;ref name="Engler, Barbara 2009"&gt;Engler, Barbara (2009) ''Personality Theories: An Introduction'', 8th ed., Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. {{ISBN|0-547-14834-8}} | {{ISBN|978-0-547-14834-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daily Record  2008"&gt;Daily Record Staff. "Drew psych professor explores spirit, religion". The (Morristown) ''Daily Record'', published online Dec. 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; marking the entrance of transpersonal themes into mainstream academic settings. In this book author Barbara Engler&lt;ref name="Engler, Barbara 2009"/&gt; asks the question, "Is spirituality an appropriate topic for psychological study?" She offers a brief account of the history of transpersonal psychology and a peek into its possible future. The classroom dimension is also present in a book on personality theories by authors Robert Frager and James Fadiman.&lt;ref&gt;Frager, Robert, &amp; Fadiman, James (2005) ''Personality and Personal Growth'', 6th ed., Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-144451-4}} {{ISBN|978-0-13-144451-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this publication they provide an account of the contributions of many of the key historic figures who have shaped and developed transpersonal psychology (in addition to discussing and explaining important concepts and theories germane to it), which serves to promote an understanding of the discipline in classroom settings.

Admitting that the majority of mainstream psychology departments rarely offer training programs in transpersonal issues and practices as part of their curriculum,&lt;ref name="Sharma Charak Sharma 2009"/&gt; graduate programs in Humanistic and Transpersonal Psychology have been made available at several North-American Universities.&lt;ref name="Hartelius Caplan Rardin 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chinen 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cowley &amp; Derezotes 1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arons 1996"&gt;Arons, M. (1996). ''Directory of graduate programs in humanistic and transpersonal Psychology in North America''. Catalogue sponsored by Division 32 of the American Psychological Association, published and distributed by the Psychology Department at State University of West Georgia.&lt;/ref&gt; {{ref|c|Note c}} Among these we find [[John F. Kennedy University]] in Orinda, which included Transpersonal psychology in its holistic studies program,&lt;ref name="McManis 1998"&gt;McManis, Sam. University with a Vision. JFK's holistic studies program attracts devoted students - and strong critics. ''San Francisco Chronicle'', Friday, October 9, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Burlington College]] in Vermont.&lt;ref name="Vermont Business Magazine"/&gt; In 2012 [[Columbia University]] announced that they  were integrating spiritual psychology, similar to the perspectives taught at [[Sofia University (California)]], into their clinical psychology program.&lt;ref name="Otterman 2012"/&gt;

However, although Transpersonal psychology has experienced recognition from the surrounding culture,&lt;ref name="Chinen 1996"/&gt; it has also faced a fair amount of skepticism and criticism from the same surroundings. Several commentators have mentioned the controversial aspects of Transpersonal psychology. Zdenek,&lt;ref name="Zdenek 1986"/&gt; representing a moderate criticism from the 1980s, noted that the field was regarded as controversial since its inception. Other commentators, such as Friedman,&lt;ref name="Friedman 2000"/&gt; and Adams,&lt;ref name="Adams 2002"/&gt; also mention the controversial status of the field. In 1998 the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' reported on the holistic studies program at the ''John F. Kennedy University'' in Orinda, which included a Transpersonal psychology department. The program was considered to be unique at the time, but also controversial. Several commentators presented their skepticism towards the program.&lt;ref name="McManis 1998"/&gt; Another controversial aspect concerns the topic of psychedelic substances.&lt;ref name="Bravo and Grob 1996"&gt;Bravo, Gary and Grob, Charles. Psychedelics and Transpersonal psychiatry. In Scotton, Bruce W., Chinen, Allan B. and Battista, John R., Eds. (1996) Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology. New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting upon the controversial status of psychedelic and entheogenic substances in contemporary culture, authors Elmer, MacDonald &amp; Friedman&lt;ref name="Elmer, MacDonald &amp; Friedman"/&gt; observe that these drugs have been used for therapeutic effect in the transpersonal movement. The authors do however note that this is not the most common form of transpersonal intervention in contemporary therapy.

According to Lukoff and Lu&lt;ref name="Lukoff Lu 2005"/&gt; the ''American Psychological Association'' expressed some concerns about the “unscientific” nature of Transpersonal psychology at the time of the petition (see above) to the APA. Rowan&lt;ref name="Rowan 2014"/&gt; notes that the Association had serious reservations about opening up a Transpersonal Psychology Division. The petitions for divisional status failed to win the majority of votes in the APA council, and the division was never established.&lt;ref name="Aanstoos, Serlin &amp; Greening 2000"/&gt; Commentators also mention that Transpersonal Psychology's association with the ideas of religion was one of the concerns that prohibited it from becoming a separate division of the APA at the time of the petition in 1984.&lt;ref name="Aanstoos, Serlin &amp; Greening 2000"/&gt;

Commenting on the state of the field in the mid-nineties Chinen&lt;ref name="Chinen 1996"/&gt; noted that professional publications, until then, had been hesitant to publish articles that dealt with transpersonal subjects. Adams &lt;ref name="Adams 2003"/&gt; notes that the field has struggled for recognition, while Freeman &lt;ref name="Freeman 2006"/&gt; mentions that the early field of Transpersonal psychology was aware of the possibility that it would be rejected by the scientific community. The method of inner empiricism, based on disciplined introspection, was to be a target of skepticism from outsiders in the years to come.

===Criticism, skepticism and response===

Criticism and skepticism towards the field of Transpersonal psychology has been presented by a wide assortment of commentators,&lt;ref name="Chinen 1996"/&gt; and includes both writers from within its own ranks, as well as writers representing other fields of psychology or philosophy. However, Chinen&lt;ref name="Chinen 1996"/&gt; notes that a few critics did not differentiate between the field of Transpersonal psychology on the one hand, and a wider field of transpersonal theories on the other. The necessity of a distinction between these two categories is also mentioned by other commentators.&lt;ref name="Friedman 2000"/&gt;

Critical remarks from within the field include the observations of Lukoff and Lu, and the criticism of Walach. In their contribution to the field of spiritually oriented psychotherapy Lukoff and Lu&lt;ref name="Lukoff Lu 2005"/&gt; discuss the strengths and weaknesses of Transpersonal psychotherapy and Transpersonal psychology. Among the strengths is its basis of theory and practice that allows for communication and dialogue with other cultures, and native healers. Among the weaknesses is a lack of theoretical agreement, which has led to internal debates, and attention from critics who question the validity of the transpersonal approach. Another source, close to the field, is ''The Wiley-Blackwell Handbook of Transpersonal Psychology''. In a chapter from this book&lt;ref name="Walach 2013"&gt;Walach, Harald. Criticisms of Transpersonal Psychology and Beyond — The Future of Transpersonal Psychology: A Science and Culture of Consciousness, in The Wiley-Blackwell Handbook of Transpersonal Psychology (2013), 738 pages, Wiley-Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; Walach brings attention to unsolved problems within the field. According to the editors the criticism represents "the sort of self-criticism that is mandatory within a responsible discipline".

Criticism from other profiles, close to the field, also include the observations of Ken Wilber and [[Jorge Ferrer]]. Wilber, one of the early profiles within the Transpersonal field, has repeatedly announced the demise of Transpersonal psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On Critics, Integral Institute, My Recent Writing, and Other Matters of Little Consequence: A Shambhala Interview with Ken Wilber|work=Part I: The Demise of Transpersonal Psychology|url=http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/interviews/interview1220.cfm/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091023122215/http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/interviews/interview1220.cfm/|archivedate=2009-10-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ken|last=Wilber|title=A sociable God: toward a new understanding of religion|page=51|publisher=Shambala Publications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cDX8zNEbUXoC|isbn=978-1590302248}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the early transpersonal theory of Wilber was itself subject to criticism in the 1980s, most notably from humanistic psychologists.&lt;ref name="Schroll Rowan Robinson 2011"&gt;Schroll, Mark A; Rowan, John; Robinson, Oliver. "Clearing up Rollo May’s views of transpersonal psychology and acknowledging May as an early supporter of ecopsychology." ''International Journal of Transpersonal Studies'', 30(1), 2011, pp. 120-136&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Wilber has distanced himself from Transpersonal psychology in favour of Integral philosophy,&lt;ref name="Hartelius Caplan Rardin 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freeman 2006"/&gt; his transpersonal model has continued to attract both recognition&lt;ref name="Cowley &amp; Derezotes 1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bidwell 1999"/&gt; and criticism.&lt;ref name="Adams 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bidwell 1999"/&gt;

Among the critics of Wilber we also find Ferrer,&lt;ref name="Freeman 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Adams 2003"/&gt; who in 2001 published a revision of transpersonal theory. In this revision &lt;ref name="Ferrer 2001"/&gt; he criticized transpersonal psychology for being too loyal to the perennial philosophy, for introducing a subtle [[Cartesianism]], and for being too preoccupied with intrasubjective spiritual states (inner empiricism). As an alternative to these trends he suggests a participatory vision of human spirituality that honors a wide assortment of spiritual insights, spiritual worlds and places.

====Criticism from Humanistic psychology====

One of the earliest criticisms of the field was issued by the Humanistic psychologist [[Rollo May]], who disputed the conceptual foundations of Transpersonal psychology.&lt;ref name="Aanstoos, Serlin &amp; Greening 2000"/&gt; According to commentators May also criticized the field for neglecting the personal dimension of the psyche by elevating the pursuit of the transcendental,&lt;ref name="Hartelius Caplan Rardin 2007"/&gt; and for neglecting the "dark side of human nature".&lt;ref name="Lukoff Lu 2005"/&gt; Commentators&lt;ref name="Hartelius Caplan Rardin 2007"/&gt; note that these reservations, expressed by May, might reflect what later theorists have referred to as  “spiritual bypassing”. Other commentators&lt;ref name="Lukoff Lu 2005"/&gt; have suggested that May only focused on “New Age popularizations of transpersonal approaches”. However, criticism has also come from other profiles in the field of [[Humanistic psychology]]. Eugene Taylor and Kirk Schneider have raised objections to several aspects of Transpersonal psychology.&lt;ref name="Chinen 1996"/&gt;

====Relationship to science and scientific criteria====

The field of Transpersonal psychology has also been criticized for lacking conceptual, evidentiary, and scientific rigor. In a review of criticisms of the field, Cunningham writes, "philosophers have criticized transpersonal psychology because its metaphysics is naive and epistemology is undeveloped. Multiplicity of definitions and lack of operationalization of many of its concepts has led to a conceptual confusion about the nature of transpersonal psychology itself (i.e., the concept is used differently by different theorists and means different things to different people). Biologists have criticized transpersonal psychology for its lack of attention to biological foundations of behavior and experience. Physicists have criticized transpersonal psychology for inappropriately accommodating physic concepts as explanations of consciousness."&lt;ref name="Cunningham 2011 53"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=Paul F.|title=A Primer on Transpersonal Psychology|year=2011|publisher=Rivier College|location=Nashua NH 03060-5086|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, such as Friedman,&lt;ref name="Friedman 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedman 2002"/&gt; has suggested that the field is underdeveloped as a field of science and that it has, consequently, not produced a good scientific understanding of transpersonal phenomena. In his proposal for a new division of labour within the transpersonal field he suggests a distinction between transpersonal studies, a broad category that might include non-scientific approaches, and transpersonal psychology, a more narrow discipline that should align itself more closely with the principles of scientific psychology. However, this criticism has been answered by Ferrer &lt;ref name="Ferrer 2014"&gt;Ferrer, Jorge. Transpersonal psychology, science, and the supernatural. ''The Journal of Transpersonal Psychology'', 2014, Vol.46, No.2&lt;/ref&gt;  who argues that Friedmans proposal attaches transpersonal psychology to a naturalistic metaphysical worldview that is unsuitable for the domain of spirituality. 
 
[[Albert Ellis]], a cognitive psychologist and humanist, has questioned the results of transpersonal psychotherapy,&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Albert; Yeager, Raymond J. (1989) Why some therapies don't work: The dangers of transpersonal psychology. Amherst, NY, US: Prometheus Books.&lt;/ref&gt; the scientific status of transpersonal psychology, and its relationship to religion, mysticism and authoritarian belief systems.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Albert. "Fanaticism that may lead to a nuclear holocaust: The contributions of scientific counseling and psychotherapy". ''Journal of Counseling &amp; Development'', Nov 1986, Vol. 65, pp. 146-151&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Albert. "Dangers of Transpersonal Psychology: A Reply To Ken Wilber". ''Journal of Counseling &amp; Development'', Feb89, Vol. 67 Issue 6, p336, 2p;&lt;/ref&gt; This criticism has been answered by Wilber&lt;ref name="Wilber 1989"&gt;Wilber, Ken. Let's Nuke the Transpersonalists: A response to Albert Ellis. ''Journal of Counseling  and Development''; Feb 1989, Vol. 67, p332-335&lt;/ref&gt; who questioned Ellis' understanding of the domain of religion, and  the field of Transpersonal Psychology; and Walsh &lt;ref name="Walsh 1989"&gt;Walsh, Roger. Psychological Chauvinism and Nuclear Holocaust: A response to Albert Ellis and Defense of Non-Rational Emotive Therapies. ''Journal of Counseling and Development''; Feb 1989, Vol. 67, p338-340&lt;/ref&gt; who questioned Ellis' critique of nonrational-emotive therapies. Also, commentators &lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Chad V., and Friedman, Harris L. "Enlightened or delusional? Differentiating religious, spiritual, and transpersonal experiences from psychopathology." ''Journal of Humanistic Psychology'' 48.4 (2008): 505-527&lt;/ref&gt; note that Ellis, in his later writings, has expressed a more moderate view of religious/spiritual/transpersonal experiences.

Other commentators, such as Matthews,&lt;ref name="Matthews 1999"/&gt; are more supportive of the field, but remarks that a weakness of Transpersonal psychology, and Transpersonal psychotherapy, has been its reliance on anecdotal clinical experiences rather than research. Adams,&lt;ref name="Adams 2006"/&gt; writing from the perspective of Consciousness Studies, has problematized the concept of introspective ‘data’ that appears to make up the "database" of  Transpersonal psychology. Walach and Runehov have responded to this issue.&lt;ref name="Walach and Runehov 2010"/&gt;

Transpersonal psychology has been noted for undervaluing quantitative methods as a tool for improving our knowledge of spiritual and transpersonal categories. This is, according to commentators,&lt;ref name="Elmer, MacDonald &amp; Friedman"/&gt; a consequence of a general orientation within the field that regards spiritual and transpersonal experience to be categories that defy conceptualization and quantification, and thereby not well suited for conventional scientific inquiry.

====Use of Buddhist concepts====
From the standpoint of Buddhism and [[Dzogchen]], Elías Capriles&lt;ref&gt;Capriles, E. (2000). ''Beyond Mind: Steps to a Metatranspersonal Psychology''. Honolulu, HI: The [[International Journal of Transpersonal Studies]], 19:163-184.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;Capriles, E. (2006). ''Beyond Mind II: Further Steps to a Metatranspersonal Philosophy and Psychology''. San Francisco, California: The International Journal of Transpersonal Studies[2], 24:5-44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Capriles, E. (in press). ''Beyond Mind III: Further Steps to a Metatranspersonal Philosophy and Psychology''. Miami, Florida: ''The International Journal of Transpersonal Studies'', special issue following vol. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; has objected that transpersonal psychology fails to distinguish between the transpersonal condition of ''nirvana'', which is inherently liberating, those transpersonal conditions which are within ''samsara'' and which as such are new forms of bondage (such as the four realms of the ''[[Formless Realm|arupyadhatu]]'' or four arupa lokas of Buddhism, in which the figure-ground division dissolves but there is still a subject-object duality), and the neutral condition in which neither ''nirvana'' nor ''samsara'' are active that the Dzogchen teachings call ''kun gzhi'', in which there is no subject-object duality but the true condition of all phenomena (''[[dharmata]]'') is not patent (and which includes all conditions involving ''nirodhah'' or cessation, including ''nirodhah samapatti'', ''nirvikalpa samadhis'' and the ''[[samadhi]]'' or ''turiya'' that is the supreme realization of [[Patañjali]]'s ''Yoga darshana''). In the process of elaborating what he calls a meta-transpersonal psychology, Capriles has carried out conscientious refutations of Wilber, Grof and Washburn, which according to Macdonald &amp; Friedman&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Harris and MacDonald, Douglas A. "Editors’ Introduction". ''The International Journal of Transpersonal Studies'', Volume 25, 2006, page ii&lt;/ref&gt; will have important repercussions on the future of transpersonal psychology.

====Other criticism====

Gary T. Alexander has criticized the relationship between transpersonal psychology and the ideas of [[William James]]. Although the ideas of James are considered central to the transpersonal field, Alexander&lt;ref name="Alexander, Gary T. 1980"/&gt; thought that transpersonal psychology did not have a clear understanding of the negative dimensions of consciousness (such as evil) expressed in James' philosophy. This serious criticism has been absorbed by later transpersonal theory, which has been more willing to reflect on these important dimensions of human existence.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, M. (2005). ''Shadow, Self, Spirit: Essays in Transpersonal Psychology''. Exeter: Imprint Academic. {{ISBN|1-84540-022-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Skepticism towards the concept of spiritual emergencies, and the transpersonal dimension in psychiatry, has been expressed by Gray.&lt;ref name="Gray 2012"&gt;Gray, Alison J. "Reviews: In Case of Spiritual Emergency: Moving Successfully Through Your Awakening". ''Psychiatric Bulletin'' (2012) 36: 360&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Cunningham, transpersonal psychology has been criticized by some Christian authors as being "a mishmash of 'New Age' ideas that offer an alternative faith system to vulnerable youths who turn their backs on organized religion (Adeney, 1988)".&lt;ref name="Cunningham 2011 53"/&gt;
 
According to Davis&lt;ref name="Davis 2003"/&gt; Transpersonal psychology has been criticized for emphasizing oneness and holism at the expense of diversity.

==Notes==
:a.{{note|a}} Walsh &amp; Vaughan (1993: 202), trying to improve on other definitions, have proposed a definition which, in their view, entail fewer presuppositions, is less theoryladen, and more closely tied to experience.

:b.{{note|b}} The [[State University of New York Press]] (Albany, NY) divides their publications into categories, or series, representing different academic fields. Among the fields represented as a category  we find the ''SUNY Series in Transpersonal and Humanistic Psychology''. Another category, the ''SUNY series in the philosophy of psychology'', also includes work from Transpersonal writers.

:c.{{note|c}} Among the universities and colleges that are associated with transpersonal theory, as part of their research or curriculum, we find: [[Sofia University (California)]] (US), [[California Institute of Integral Studies]] (US), [[Notre Dame de Namur University]] (US), [[Saybrook University]] (US), Liverpool John Moores University (UK), [[Naropa University]] (US), [[John F. Kennedy University (California)]] (US), [[University of West Georgia]] (US), [[Atlantic University]] (US), Burlington College (US), the [[University of Northampton]] (UK), Leeds Metropolitan University (UK) and Pacifica Graduate Institute (US).

:d.{{note|d}} Transpersonal psychology often differentiates between the concepts of religion and spirituality.&lt;ref name="Walsh &amp; Vaughan 1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner et al., 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cowley &amp; Derezotes 1994"/&gt; Commentators&lt;ref name="Elmer, MacDonald &amp; Friedman"/&gt;  note that religion, in a transpersonal context, has to do with the individuals involvement in a social institution and its doctrines, while spirituality has to do with the individuals experience of a transcendent dimension. The authors&lt;ref name="Turner et al., 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lukoff Lu Turner 1996"/&gt; of the DSM-proposal make the samme differentiation: Religious problems may be caused by a change in denominational membership; conversion to a new religion; intensification of religious belief or practice; loss or questioning of faith; guilt; joining or leaving a new religious movement or cult.

'''VERB''' was a [[physical activity]] program of the [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] of the [[United States Government]]. It included print, [[internet|online]], and [[television]] national paid advertising, running them on popular children's channels and popular children's magazines, for example. It ran from 2002 to 2006. The main goal of the VERB campaign was to increase and maintain physical activity among “tweens” (children ages 9–13). The campaign is based upon social marketing principles (produce, price, place and promotion) and culturally targets this age group. It encourages life style changes such as playing more and “trying new verbs.” &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Huhman|first = Marian E.|last2 = Potter|first2 = Lance D.|last3 = Duke|first3 = Jennifer C.|last4 = Judkins|first4 = David R.|last5 = Heitzler|first5 = Carrie D.|last6 = Wong|first6 = Faye L.|title = Evaluation of a National Physical Activity Intervention for Children|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0749379706004077|journal = American Journal of Preventive Medicine|volume = 32|issue = 1|pages = 38–43|doi = 10.1016/j.amepre.2006.08.030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An evaluation of the program in 2004 found it to have an expansive reach. Among exposed children, 96% reported understanding of at least one key campaign message. Children who reported being aware of the VERB campaign engaged in 3.9 weekly sessions of free-time activity while children with no VERB awareness reported 3 sessions of physical activity. This is a 22% differences between the VERB aware and unaware.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2004, an additional program called "VERB Summer Scorecard" emerged from the national VERB campaign. VERB Summer Scorecard was developed first launched by ''Fit Kentucky'' and the Lexington Fayette County Health Department (creating the Lexington Tweens Nutrition and Fitness Coalition). It has since been adapted and disseminated in 22 communities including cities in Florida, Nebraska, Iowa and Colorado. VERB Summer Scorecard promotes and incentivizes physical activity opportunities by creating a “passport” (scorecard) system for children to track their physical activity. It creates “activity-friendly communities” to facilitate exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2011/sep/10_0173.htm|title = Preventing Chronic Disease: September 2011: 10_0173|website = www.cdc.gov|access-date = 2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initiative 502 defined and [[Legality of cannabis|legalized]] small amounts of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]-related products for adults 21 and over, [[Excise|taxes]] them and designates the revenue for [[healthcare]] and [[Substance abuse|substance-abuse]] [[Drug education|prevention and education]].

Possession by anyone younger than 21, possession of larger amounts, and the growing of unlicensed or unregulated marijuana remains illegal under [[Revised Code of Washington|state law]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

== Ballot measure summary ==

As it is described by the Secretary of State's office, the measure shall "license and regulate marijuana production, distribution, and possession for persons over twenty-one; remove state-law criminal and civil penalties for activities that it authorizes; tax marijuana sales; and earmark marijuana-related revenues."

&lt;blockquote&gt;This measure removes state-law prohibitions against producing, processing, and selling marijuana, subject to licensing and regulation by the liquor control board; allow limited possession of marijuana by persons aged twenty-one and over; and impose 25% excise taxes on wholesale and retail sales of marijuana, earmarking revenue for purposes that include substance-abuse prevention, research, education, and healthcare. Laws prohibiting driving under the influence would be amended to include maximum thresholds for THC blood concentration.&lt;ref name=AGtitlememo&gt;{{Cite web

==Provisions==
After approval, Initiative 502 implements over a period of a year or more. Legal possession and [[Driving under the influence|DUI limits]] went into effect on December 9, 2012, and the state had until December 1, 2013, to establish other key rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The initiative legalized use of marijuana products for adults 21 and over and focus law enforcement resources on DUI prosecution as well as violent and property crimes. Personal "grows" in one's own home, except for [[medical cannabis]] as regulated under RCW 69.51A, will remain illegal.

Part I identifies the goal of the initiative and authorizes the [[Washington State Liquor Control Board]] "to regulate
and tax marijuana for persons twenty-one years of age and older, and add a new threshold for driving under the influence of marijuana."

Part II establishes various definitions, including one which distinguishes "marijuana" from [[hemp]] and other parts of the [[cannabis]] plant based on its [[Tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]] content.

Part III establishes a license system for marijuana producers, processors, and retailers. Initial licenses shall be $250 with an annual renewal fee of $1000. Rules prohibit producers and processors from having any financial interest in retailers, much like the [[Three-tier (alcohol distribution)|three-tier system]] for [[Distilled beverage|hard liquor]] in [[Alcoholic beverage control state|control states]]. This section also makes it clear that selling or distributing unlicensed marijuana remains illegal, setting limits on the maximum amount one may possess. Adults 21 years or older may possess up to  "one ounce of useable marijuana", 16 ounces of marijuana-infused product in solid form, 72 ounces of marijuana-infused product in liquid form or "any combination" of all three. The part also authorizes Liquor Enforcement Officers of the [[Washington State Liquor Control Board]] to enforce RCW 69.50, the [[Uniform Controlled Substances Act]]. Previous to this Liquor Enforcement Officers could only enforce alcohol and tobacco laws.

While any and all remaining funds generated over initial costs is to be divided over general public health, drug-abuse treatment, drug-abuse prevention, marijuana research and local research facilities, specifically University of Washington &amp; Washington State University.]]

Part IV establishes a "dedicated marijuana fund" for all revenue received by the liquor control board, and explicitly [[Earmark (politics)|earmarks]] any surplus from this new revenue for health care (55%), drug abuse treatment and education (25%), with 1% for marijuana-related research at  [[University of Washington]]  and [[Washington State University]], most of the remainder going to the state general fund.

''No on I-502'' was the primary group opposing Initiative 502. Their website denounced what they described as I-502's "new approach to prohibition", and describes how the [[DUID]] provisions of I-502 may actually increase the potential penalty for marijuana use, and lead to a new era in the war on drugs under color of DUID prosecutions, as part of what they describe as a nationwide strategy to move war on drugs from the current focus on sales and possession to a new and more ominous offensive on drivers via new per se DUID laws like I-502.

[[File:Greywater settling tank and grease trap (3109542163).jpg|thumb|[[Greywater]] (a type of wastewater) in a settling tank]]
'''Wastewater''' (or '''waste water''') is any [[water]] that has been affected by human use. Wastewater is "used water from any combination of domestic, industrial, commercial or agricultural activities, [[surface runoff]] or [[stormwater]], and any sewer inflow or sewer infiltration".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|isbn = 978-3-906484-57-0|url = http://www.eawag.ch/en/department/sandec/publications/compendium/|title = Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies – (2nd Revised Edition)|last = Tilley, E., Ulrich, L., Lüthi, C., Reymond, Ph., Zurbrügg, C.|publisher = Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), Duebendorf, Switzerland|page = 175|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160408021403/http://www.eawag.ch/en/department/sandec/publications/compendium/|archivedate = 8 April 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, wastewater is a byproduct of domestic, industrial, commercial or [[Agriculture|agricultural]] activities. The characteristics of wastewater vary depending on the source. Types of wastewater include: domestic wastewater from households, municipal wastewater from communities (also called [[sewage]]) or [[Industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewater]] from industrial activities. Wastewater can contain physical, chemical and biological [[pollutant]]s.

Households may produce wastewater from [[flush toilet]]s, sinks, dishwashers, washing machines, bath tubs, and showers. Households that use [[dry toilet]]s produce less wastewater than those that use flush toilets.

Wastewater may be conveyed in a [[sanitary sewer]] which conveys only sewage. Alternatively, it can be transported in a [[combined sewer]] which includes [[Surface runoff|stormwater runoff]] and industrial wastewater. After treatment at a [[wastewater treatment plant]], the treated wastewater (also called effluent) is discharged to a receiving water body. The terms "wastewater reuse" or "[[Reclaimed water|water reclamation]]" apply if the treated waste is used for another purpose. Wastewater that is discharged to the environment without suitable treatment causes [[water pollution]].

In developing countries and in rural areas with low population densities, wastewater is often treated by various [[Sanitation#Onsite sanitation|on-site sanitation]] systems and not conveyed in sewers. These systems include [[septic tank]]s connected to [[septic drain field|drain fields]], [[Onsite sewage facility|on-site sewage systems]] (OSS), [[vermifilter]] systems and many more.

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Terminology==
The overarching term [[sanitation]] includes the management of wastewater, [[human excreta]], [[Municipal solid waste|solid waste]] and [[stormwater]]. 
The term [[sewerage]] refers to the physical infrastructure required to transport and treat wastewater.

== Sources ==
Sources of wastewater include the following domestic or household activities:
* [[Human waste|Human excreta]] ([[Human feces|feces]] and [[urine]]) often mixed with used [[toilet paper]] or wipes; this is known as [[blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] if it is collected with [[flush toilet]]s
* Washing water (personal, clothes, floors, dishes, cars, etc.), also known as [[greywater]] or [[sullage]]
* Surplus manufactured liquids from domestic sources (drinks, cooking oil, [[pesticide]]s, [[lubricant|lubricating oil]], [[paint]], cleaning liquids, etc.)

Activities producing [[Industrial wastewater treatment#Sources of industrial wastewater|industrial wastewater]]:
*[[Industrial stormwater|Industrial site drainage]] (silt, sand, alkali, oil, chemical residues);
*Industrial cooling waters ([[biocide]]s, heat, slimes, silt)
*Industrial processing waters
*Organic or [[biodegradable]] waste, including waste from [[hospital]]s, [[abattoir]]s, [[creamery|creameries]], and [[food]] factories.
*Organic or non bio-degradable waste that is difficult-to-treat from [[pharmaceutical]] or [[pesticide]] manufacturing
*Extreme [[pH]] waste from [[acid]] and [[alkali]] manufacturing 
*[[Toxic]] waste from metal [[plating]], [[cyanide]] production, [[pesticide]] manufacturing, etc.
*[[Solids]] and [[emulsion]]s from [[paper]] mills, factories producing lubricants or hydraulic [[oil]]s, foodstuffs, etc.
*Water used in [[hydraulic fracturing]]
*[[Produced water]] from oil &amp; natural gas production

Other activities or events:
* [[Urban runoff]] from [[highway]]s, [[road]]s, carparks, roofs, sidewalks/pavements (contains oils, animal feces, [[litter]], [[gasoline]]/[[petrol]], [[diesel fuel|diesel]] or [[rubber]] residues from tires, soapscum, [[metal]]s from vehicle [[exhaust gas|exhausts]], de-icing agents, herbicides and pesticides from gardens, etc.)
*[[Agricultural pollution]], direct and diffuse

Wastewater can be diluted or mixed with other types of water by the following mechanisms:
* [[Seawater]] ingress (high volumes of [[salt]] and [[microbe]]s)
* Direct ingress of [[river]] water 
* [[Rain]]fall collected on roofs, yards, hard-standings, etc. (generally clean with traces of [[oil]]s and [[fuel]])
* [[Groundwater]] infiltrated into sewage
* Mixing with other types of wastewater or [[fecal sludge]]

== Pollutants ==
The composition of wastewater varies widely. This is a partial list of pollutants that may be contained in wastewater:

=== Chemical or physical pollutants ===
* [[Toxic heavy metal|Heavy metals]], including [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], [[lead]], and [[chromium]]
* [[Organic material|Organic]] particles such as [[feces]], [[hair]]s, [[food]], [[vomiting|vomit]], paper fibers, plant material, [[humus]], etc.;
* [[Soluble]] organic material such as [[urea]], fruit sugars, soluble [[protein]]s, [[medication|drugs]], [[pharmaceuticals]], etc.;
* [[Inorganic]] particles such as [[sand]], grit, metal particles, [[ceramic]]s, etc.;
* Soluble inorganic material such as [[ammonia]], road-salt, sea-salt, [[cyanide]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[thiocyanate]]s, [[thiosulfate]]s, etc.;
* Macro-solids such as [[sanitary napkin]]s, [[Diaper|nappies/diapers]], [[condom]]s, [[Hypodermic needle|needles]], children's toys, dead animals or plants, etc.;
* [[Gases]] such as [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]], etc.;
* [[Emulsion]]s such as [[paint]]s, [[adhesive]]s, [[mayonnaise]], [[hair]] colorants, emulsified oils, etc.;
* [[Toxins]] such as [[pesticide]]s, [[poison]]s, [[herbicide]]s, etc.
* [[Pharmaceuticals]] and hormones and other hazardous substances
* [[Thermal pollution]] from [[power station]]s and industrial manufacturers

=== Biological pollutants ===
If the wastewater contains [[human feces]], as is the case for [[sewage]], then it may also contain [[pathogens]] of one of the four types:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/71253096|title=Guidelines for the safe use of wastewater, excreta, and greywater.|last=World Health Organization|first=|date=2006|publisher=World Health Organization|year=|isbn=9241546859|location=|pages=31|oclc=71253096}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersson"&gt;Andersson, K., Rosemarin, A., Lamizana, B., Kvarnström, E., McConville, J., Seidu, R., Dickin, S. and Trimmer, C.

* [[Bacteria]] (for example ''[[Salmonella]]'', ''[[Shigella]]'', ''[[Campylobacter]]'', ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]''), 
* [[Virus]]es (for example [[hepatitis A]], [[rotavirus]], [[enteroviruses]]), 
* [[Protozoa]] (for example ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]'', ''[[Giardia lamblia]]'', ''[[Cryptosporidium parvum]]'') and 
* Parasites such as [[helminths]] and their eggs (e.g. ''[[Ascaris]]'' (roundworm), ''[[Ancylostoma]]'' (hookworm), ''[[Trichuris]]'' (whipworm));

It can also contain non-pathogenic bacteria and animals such as [[insect]]s, [[arthropod]]s, small [[fish]].

=== Quality indicators ===
{{Main|Wastewater quality indicators}}
Since all natural waterways contain bacteria and nutrients, almost any waste compounds introduced into such waterways will initiate biochemical reactions (such as shown above). Those biochemical reactions create what is measured in the laboratory as the [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD). Such chemicals are also liable to be broken down using strong oxidizing agents and these chemical reactions create what is measured in the laboratory as the [[chemical oxygen demand]] (COD). Both the BOD and COD tests are a measure of the relative oxygen-depletion effect of a waste contaminant. Both have been widely adopted as a measure of [[pollution]] effect. The BOD test measures the oxygen demand of [[biodegradation|biodegradable]] pollutants whereas the COD test measures the oxygen demand of oxidizable pollutants.

Any [[Redox|oxidizable]] material present in an aerobic natural waterway or in an industrial wastewater will be oxidized both by [[Biochemistry|biochemical]] (bacterial) or chemical processes. The result is that the oxygen content of the water will be decreased.

== Treatment ==
{{Main|Wastewater treatment}}
At a global level, around 80% of wastewater produced is discharged into the environment untreated, causing widespread [[water pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.unwater.org/publications/publications-detail/en/c/853650/|title=The United Nations World Water Development Report 2017. Wastewater: The Untapped Resource|last=WWAP (United Nations World Water Assessment Programme)|first=|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100201-4|location=Paris|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408061139/http://www.unwater.org/publications/publications-detail/en/c/853650/|archivedate=8 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

There are numerous processes that can be used to clean up wastewaters depending on the type and extent of contamination. Wastewater can be treated in [[sewage treatment|wastewater treatment plants]] which include physical, chemical and biological treatment processes. Municipal wastewater is treated in [[sewage treatment plant]]s (which may also be referred to as [[wastewater treatment plant]]s). Agricultural wastewater may be treated in [[agricultural wastewater treatment]] processes, whereas industrial wastewater is treated in [[industrial wastewater treatment]] processes.

For municipal wastewater the use of [[septic tank]]s and other On-Site Sewage Facilities ([[OSSF]]) is widespread in some rural areas, for example serving up to 20 percent of the homes in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, D.C. (2008). [http://water.epa.gov/aboutow/owm/upload/2009_06_22_septics_septic_systems_factsheet.pdf "Septic Systems Fact Sheet."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412140527/http://water.epa.gov/aboutow/owm/upload/2009_06_22_septics_septic_systems_factsheet.pdf |date=12 April 2013 }} EPA publication no. 832-F-08-057.&lt;/ref&gt;

One type of aerobic treatment system is the [[activated sludge]] process, based on the maintenance and recirculation of a complex biomass composed of micro-organisms able to absorb and [[adsorb]] the organic matter carried in the wastewater. Anaerobic wastewater treatment processes ([[Upflow anaerobic sludge blanket digestion|UASB]], [[Expanded granular sludge bed digestion|EGSB]]) are also widely applied in the treatment of industrial wastewaters and biological sludge. Some wastewater may be highly treated and reused as [[reclaimed water]]. [[Constructed wetland]]s are also being used.

== Disposal ==
[[File:Wastewater effluent.JPG|thumb|right|Industrial wastewater effluent with neutralized pH from tailing runoff in Peru.|300px]]
In some urban areas, municipal wastewater is carried separately in [[sanitary sewer]]s and runoff from streets is carried in [[storm drain]]s. Access to either of these systems is typically through a [[manhole]].

During high precipitation periods a combined sewer system may experience a [[combined sewer overflow]] event, which forces untreated sewage to flow directly to receiving waters. This can pose a serious threat to [[public health]] and the surrounding environment.

Sewage may drain directly into major [[drainage basin|watersheds]] with minimal or no treatment but this usually has serious impacts on the quality of an environment and on the health of people. [[Pathogen]]s can cause a variety of illnesses. Some chemicals pose risks even at very low concentrations and can remain a threat for long periods of time because of [[bioaccumulation]] in animal or human tissue.

Wastewater from industrial activities may be pumped underground through an [[injection well]]. Wastewater injection has been linked to [[Induced seismicity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van der Baan|first=Mirko|last2=Calixto|first2=Frank J.|date=2017-07-01|title=Human-induced seismicity and large-scale hydrocarbon production in the USA and Canada|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GC006915/abstract|journal=Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems|language=en|volume=18|issue=7|pages=2467–2485|doi=10.1002/2017gc006915|issn=1525-2027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reuse ==
{{Main|Reclaimed water|Reuse of excreta}}
Treated wastewater can be reused in industry (for example in [[cooling towers]]), in artificial recharge of aquifers, in agriculture and in the rehabilitation of natural ecosystems (for example in [[wetland]]s). In rarer cases it is also used to augment [[drinking water]] supplies. There are several technologies used to treat wastewater for reuse. A combination of these technologies can meet strict treatment standards and make sure that the processed water is hygienically safe, meaning free from bacteria and viruses. The following are some of the typical technologies: [[Ozonation]], [[ultrafiltration]], [[Aerobic treatment system|aerobic treatment]] ([[membrane bioreactor]]), [[forward osmosis]], [[reverse osmosis]], [[Advanced oxidation process|advanced oxidation]].

Some water demanding activities do not require high grade water. In this case, wastewater can be reused with little or no treatment. One example of this scenario is in the domestic environment where [[Flush toilet|toilets]] can be flushed using [[greywater]] from baths and showers with little or no treatment.

Irrigation with recycled wastewater can also serve to [[Fertilizer|fertilize]] plants if it contains nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. In developing countries, [[agriculture]] is using untreated wastewater for irrigation - often in an unsafe manner. There can be significant health hazards related to using untreated wastewater in agriculture. The [[World Health Organization]] developed guidelines for safe use of wastewater in 2006.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;WHO (2006). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1004 WHO Guidelines for the Safe Use of Wastewater, Excreta and Greywater – Volume IV: Excreta and greywater use in agriculture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017235811/http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1004 |date=17 October 2014 }}.

'''Wine To Water''' is a [[non-profit organization]] committed to supporting life and dignity for all through the power of clean water. The organization was founded by [[Doc Hendley]] in 2007.

==History==
The idea for Wine To Water was born with the first fundraiser being held in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] in early 2004. The founder, [[Doc Hendley]] was a bartender in Raleigh, and had a strong desire utilize the bar and nightclub industry as a way to bring about positive change in the world.  After becoming aware of the world's water crisis, Doc held fundraisers at wine tastings and bars in the Raleigh area. The funds from the events would be used to implement clean water projects around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://winetowater.org/about-us ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221084818/http://winetowater.org/about-us |date=December 21, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The projects financed include digging and repairing wells, supplying areas with filtration systems and storage containers, and educating locals on how to maintain fresh water supplies.

Nearly one billion people worldwide lack access to clean water,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/monitoring/jmp_report_7_10_lores.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and roughly 3.5&amp;nbsp;million people die each year because of water related issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; World Health Organization |publisher=Who.int |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost half of these deaths are attributed to [[diarrhea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/saferwater/en/index.html |title=WHO &amp;#124; Safer water, better health |publisher=Who.int |date=2010-12-10 |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dsc.discovery.com/survival/faqs/food-water.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions : Survival Expert : Discovery Channel |publisher=Dsc.discovery.com |date=2011-12-01 |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wine To Water has expanded greatly recently, and is currently working on water projects in [[Sudan]], [[India]], [[Cambodia]], [[Uganda]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Peru]], and [[Kenya]].

Wine To Water is based in [[Boone, North Carolina]], and has clean water projects running in multiple international locations.  Wine To Water has received a great deal of media attention on the local, national, and international levels.  Doc Hendley was selected by CNN as a top ten finalist for the 2012 [[CNN Heroes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/heroes |title=CNN Heroes 2012 - Everyday People Changing the World - Special Reports from |publisher=CNN.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, Wine To Water had implemented sustainable drinking water initiatives to over 25,000 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cnn.heroes/archive09/doc.hendley.html |title=CNN Heroes - Special Reports from |publisher=CNN.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By October 2014, Wine To Water had expanding to include projects in 18 countries on four continents, supplying clean water to over 300,000 individuals.

==Projects==
[[Image:WellPeru.jpg|right|thumb|Well being dug in [[Trujillo, Peru]]]]

===Sudan===

[[Sudan]] was one of the first countries to receive aid from Wine To Water.  Much of the work in Sudan is focused on the rehabilitation of old wells that have stopped supplying water due to faulty pumping mechanisms.  Wine To Water has also helped truck water into many of the war torn regions of Sudan.  In addition to the above successes, they have constructed and installed an entire water system for an orphanage located in the country's capital.  Prior to the contributions made by Wine To Water, the orphanage children were drinking out of a basin of standing water.  This is very unhealthy because the basin was the same basin they washed in and standing water is a "breeding ground" for bacteria.  Thanks to Wine To Water, the children and staff now have access to clean running water.  Many of the locations wine To water has visited in the Sudan area have been deemed "unsafe" for humanitarian work.  However, Doc and his organization have traveled to these areas and successfully implemented water treatment facilities and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/04/30/heroes.doc.hendley/index.html |title=Bartender helps turn wine to water in developing world |publisher=CNN |date=2009-04-30 |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===

A [[leper colony]] located on the outskirts of [[New Delhi]] lacked access to clean water.  WTW has installed a new running water system for this colony.&lt;ref name="winetowater1"&gt;[http://winetowater.org/index.php?module=pagemaster&amp;PAGE_user_op=view_page&amp;PAGE_id=3 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013102803/http://winetowater.org/index.php?module=pagemaster&amp;PAGE_user_op=view_page&amp;PAGE_id=3 |date=October 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cambodia===

[[Cambodia]] is a country surrounded by water, yet most of the citizens lack access to clean water.  Roughly {{frac|3|4}} of the deaths in Cambodia can be attributed to a lack of clean water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/04/30/heroes.doc.hendley/index.html#cnnSTCVideo |title=Bartender helps turn wine to water in developing world |publisher=CNN |date=2009-04-30 |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One focus of Wine To Water in [[Phnom Penh]], is to supply Bio Sand filters for the residences and communities that do not have access to clean water.  The primary focus, however, is the drilling of new water wells for communities.  As of October, 2009, WTW has drilled over 70 wells for the people of Cambodia.  Using local supplies and hand pumps, WTW is able to cut the cost of drilling a well to one fifth the original cost.&lt;ref name="winetowater1"/&gt;

===Uganda===

Work in [[Uganda]] is focused on several areas: first is the distribution of Bio-Sand filters, second is the training of local persons to manufacture their own filters, lastly the formation of training centers around the country to educate the citizens about how to clean water and the importance of this process.&lt;ref name="winetowater1"/&gt;
[[Image:WaterTankPeru.jpg|right|thumb|Doc (right) checking out a water tank placed on a roof in Peru]]

===Peru===
Wine To Water's work in [[Peru]] is currently centered in [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]]. Water projects underway as of 2009 include hand digging wells, as well as supplying households, orphanages and daycares with a water pumping and storage system to ensure clean water for the community. Individual filtration systems are being distributed in additional areas exposed to contaminated water sources.&lt;ref name="Our projects"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://winetowater.org/projects |title=Our projects |publisher=Wine To Water |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Haiti===
In response to the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], Wine To Water responded by partnering with Filter Pure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marcel Zakzrewicz by Web Macon International |url=http://filterpurefilters.org/ |title=Ceramic potters water filters for peace in Haiti during this hard times after the earthquake desaster |publisher=Filterpurefilters.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; to distribute 500 ceramic water filters. The filters provide clean water for a family of 10 for up to five years. Along with Filter Pure, Wine To Water has also begun to build a Haitian run ceramic filter factory to ensure clean water will continue to get to those who need it most.&lt;ref name="Our projects"/&gt;

==Physical==
In terms of medical issues with regard to [[lesbian sexual practices]], the sexual identification of women who consult a medical professional is usually not sought nor volunteered, due to the misconceptions and assumptions about sexuality and the hesitancy of some women in disclosing their accurate sexual histories even to a physician.&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Many women who do not participate in heterosexual activity do not go to see a physician because they do not require [[birth control]], which is the initiating factor for most women to seek consultation with a [[gynecologist]] when they become sexually active.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, these women are not screened regularly with [[pap smear]]s because they have a lower perceived risk of acquiring a [[sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infection]] or types of cancer. A factor which leads to lesbians neglecting to seek medical screening in the United States is a lack of health insurance offered by employers for same-sex domestic partners.&lt;ref name="HHS"&gt;"[http://womenshealth.gov/faq/lesbian-health.cfm Frequently Asked Questions: Lesbian Health] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129175054/http://www.womenshealth.gov/faq/lesbian-health.cfm |date=2009-01-29 }}", womenshealth.gov. [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]]. Retrieved January 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

When women do seek medical attention, medical professionals often fail to take a complete medical history. In a recent study of 2,345 lesbian and bisexual women, only 9.3% had claimed they had ever been asked their sexual orientation by a physician. A third of the respondents believed disclosing their sexual history would result in a negative reaction, and 30% had received a negative reaction from a medical professional after identifying themselves as lesbian or bisexual.&lt;ref name="mravack"&gt;Mravack, Sally A. (July 2006)."Primary Care for Lesbians and Bisexual Women", ''American Family Physician'' '''74''' (2), pp. 279–286.&lt;/ref&gt;

A patient's complete history helps medical professionals identify higher risk areas and corrects assumptions about the personal histories of women. In a similar survey of 6,935 lesbians, 77% had had sexual contact with one or more male partners, and 6% had that contact within the previous year.&lt;ref name="mravack"/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Another summary of overall surveys found that women who identify as lesbian, 80-95% had previous sexual contact with men, and some report sexual behavior that is risky. (King, p. 221.)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heart disease]] is listed by the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] as the number one cause of death for all women. Factors that add to risk of heart disease include [[obesity]] and [[smoking]], both of which are more prevalent in lesbians. Studies show that lesbians have a higher [[body mass]] and are generally less concerned about weight issues than heterosexual women, although they are more likely to engage in exercise regularly.&lt;ref name="HHS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mravack"/&gt;

Lack of differentiation between lesbians and heterosexual women in medical studies that concentrate on health issues for women skews results for lesbians and non-lesbian women. Reports are inconclusive about occurrence of [[breast cancer]] in lesbians.&lt;ref name="mravack"/&gt; It has been determined, however, that the lower rate of lesbians tested by regular pap smears makes it more difficult to detect [[cervical cancer]] at early stages in lesbians. The risk factors for developing [[ovarian cancer]] rates are higher in lesbians than in heterosexual women, perhaps because many lesbians lack protective factors of pregnancy, abortion, contraceptives, breast feeding, and miscarriages.&lt;ref&gt;Vo, Christine, Carney, Michael (December 2007). "Ovarian Cancer Hormonal and Environmental Risk Effect", ''Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics''34 (4) p. 687–700.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental==
Since medical literature began to describe homosexuality, it has often been approached from a view that sought to find an inherent psychopathology as the root cause. Much literature on mental health and lesbians centered on their [[Clinical depression|depression]], [[substance abuse]], and [[suicide]]. Although these issues exist among lesbians, discussion about their causes shifted after homosexuality was removed from the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]] in 1973. Instead, social ostracism, legal discrimination, internalization of negative stereotypes, and limited support structures indicate factors homosexuals face in Western societies that often adversely affect their mental health.&lt;ref&gt;Schlager, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Women who identify as lesbian report feeling significantly different and isolated during adolescence;&lt;ref name="schlager153"&gt;Schlager, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; these emotions have been cited as appearing on average at 15 years old in lesbians and 18 years old in women who identify as bisexual.&lt;ref name="rust2"&gt;Rust, Paula, (March, 1993). "Coming out" in the Age of Social Constructionism: Sexual Identity Formation among Lesbian and Bisexual Women", ''Gender and Society'', '''7''' (1), p. 50-77.&lt;/ref&gt; On the whole, women tend to work through developing a self-concept internally, or with other women with whom they are intimate. Women (heterosexual or otherwise) also limit who they divulge their sexual identities to and more often see being lesbian as a choice, as opposed to gay men, who work more externally and see being gay as outside their control.&lt;ref name="schlager153"/&gt;

[[Anxiety disorder]]s and [[depression (mood)|depression]] are the most common mental health issues for women. Depression is reported among lesbians at a rate similar to heterosexual women.&lt;ref&gt;Solarz, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a more significant problem among women who feel they must hide their sexual orientation from friends and family, experience compounded ethnic or religious discrimination, or experience relationship difficulties with no support system.&lt;ref&gt;Schlager, pp. 157–158.&lt;/ref&gt; More than half the respondents to a 1994 survey of health issues in lesbians reported they had [[Suicidal ideation|suicidal thoughts]], and 18% had attempted suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Solarz, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

A population-based study completed by the National Alcohol Research Center found that women who identify as lesbian or bisexual are less likely to abstain from alcohol. Lesbians and bisexual women have a higher likelihood of reporting problems with alcohol, as well as not being satisfied with treatment for substance abuse programs.&lt;ref&gt;Drabble, Laurie, Trocki, Karen (2005).

Some STIs are communicable between women, including [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV), [[trichomoniasis]], [[syphilis]], [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV), [[bacterial vaginosis]] (BV), and [[herpes simplex virus]] (HSV). Transmission of specific sexually transmitted diseases among women who have sex with women depends on the sexual practices women engage in. Any object that comes in contact with cervical secretions, vaginal mucosa, or menstrual blood, including fingers or penetrative objects may transmit sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Special Populations - 2010 STD Treatment Guidelines |publisher=CDC| url =  https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/specialpops.htm | accessdate = 2015-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oral sex|Oral-genital contact]] may indicate a higher risk of acquiring HSV,&lt;ref&gt;Frenkl, Tara Lee, Potts, Jeannette (February 2008).

In the [[early Middle Ages]], a '''xenodochium''' or '''xenodoch(e)ion''' (from [[Ancient Greek]] ξενοδοχεῖον, ''ksenodokheion''; place for strangers, inn, guesthouse) was a type of [[hostel]] or [[hospital]], usually specifically for foreigners or pilgrims, but the term could refer to charitable institutions in general. Xenodochia were more common than institutions of a more specific nature, such as the ''gerocomium'' (a place for the old), ''nosocomium'' (for the sick) and ''orphanotrophium'' (for orphans). A hospital for victims of [[Plague (disease)|plague]] was called a ''xenodochium pestiferorum'' (guesthouse of the plague-carriers).
