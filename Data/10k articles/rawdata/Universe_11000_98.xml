[[Image:Monokristalines Silizium für die Waferherstellung.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|[[Monocrystalline silicon]] boule]]

A '''boule''' is a [[single crystal]] [[ingot]] produced by synthetic means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WJzmBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA56&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=boule+silicon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Sv_meo8_ld&amp;sig=7XCp7sw4ElO-tpoTm5eDGpfv7hY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiLuNPG9abSAhUELcAKHUhnCB04ChDoAQhIMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=boule%20silicon&amp;f=false|title=Fundamentals of Silicon Carbide Technology: Growth, Characterization|access-date=March 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A boule of [[silicon]] is the starting material for most of the [[integrated circuit]]s used today. In the [[semiconductor]] industry synthetic boules can be made by a number of methods, such as the [[Bridgman technique]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=izaSIlOahJkC&amp;pg=PA485&amp;dq=bridgman+technique&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjPzIyS96bSAhUmC8AKHdgaC2MQ6AEIPjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=bridgman%20technique&amp;f=false|title=crystal growth handbook |deadurl=no |access-date=February 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Czochralski process]], which result in a cylindrical rod of material.

In the Czochralski process a [[seed crystal]] is required to create a larger crystal, or ingot. This seed crystal is dipped into the pure molten silicon and slowly extracted. The molten silicon grows on the seed crystal in a crystalline fashion. As the seed is extracted the silicon solidifies and eventually a large, cylindrical boule is produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ce-__G-L5iEC&amp;pg=PP11&amp;dq=Czochralski+process&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjL17bo9qbSAhWKCsAKHRwPA1IQ6AEIKTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Czochralski%20process&amp;f=false|title=Continuous Czochralski Process Development|access-date=March 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A semiconductor crystal boule is normally cut into circular [[wafer (electronics)|wafers]] using an inside hole [[diamond saw]] or diamond [[wire saw]], and each wafer is [[lapped]] and polished to provide [[substrate (electronics)|substrate]]s suitable for the fabrication of [[semiconductor device]]s on its surface.&lt;ref name="BOSE2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=BOSE|title=IC Fabrication Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vnzvAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA53|year=2013|publisher=McGraw Hill Education (India) Pvt Ltd|isbn=978-1-259-02958-5|pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process is also used to create [[sapphire]]s, which are used for substrates in the production of blue and white [[Light emitting diode|LEDs]], optical windows in special applications and as the protective covers for [[watches]].&lt;ref name="Colinge2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=J.-P.

'''Carbotanium''' is a patented composite material invented by '''Modena Design''', the [[Carbon fibre|carbon composite]] manufacturing and consultancy arm of the Italian car company [[Pagani (automobile)|Pagani]]. It is a combination of [[Titanium|beta titanium]] [[alloy]] with advanced carbon composites, having a matched [[yield strength]] and [[Elastic modulus|moduli of elasticity]] ratio. When the combination is adhesively bonded both parts will approach maximum yield strength and fail at a similar amount of total strain. The [[titanium]] and carbon composites are combined by first abrading the titanium to be bonded, coating the titanium with [[platinum]], aging the titanium, spraying [[Primer (paint)|primer]] on the coated titanium, applying [[adhesive]] to the primer side of the titanium and then applying the [[carbon]] to the adhesive. This allows the carbon composite to bond securely to the titanium. This [[Composite material|composite]] uses the best properties of each component, the combination having a better set of properties than either part. This material is both strong and light.&lt;ref name=googlepatent&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US5733390|title=Carbon-titanium composites|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Pagani has applied this weave on their latter extra strong and lightweight supercars, the [[Pagani Zonda R|Zonda R]] and [[Pagani Huayra|Huayra]]. Although not all [[Pagani Zonda|Zondas]] are made from carbotanium, some are formed from carbon fibre. They have also used other variations of metal/composites.

'''Chicago Pile-3''' ('''CP-3''') was the first [[heavy water reactor]] in the world, going critical on 15 May 1944. It was used in the experimental physics  work of the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] for the [[Manhattan Project]].

CP-3 was in operation from 1943–54 and was built near [[Palos Hills, Illinois]] on the former (i.e., original) site of [[Argonne National Laboratory]].&lt;ref name="cp3"&gt;[http://www.ne.anl.gov/About/reactors/early-reactors.shtml Early exploration nuclear reactors], Argonne National Laboratory&lt;/ref&gt; The site is now known as the [[Site A/Plot M Disposal Site]] and is situated within [[Red Gate Woods]], part of the Cook County Forest Preserve system.

CP-3 was initially fueled with [[natural uranium]] and used [[heavy water]] as a neutron moderator. In January 1950, the reactor was dismantled due to suspicion of [[Radiation_damage#Effects_on_solids|corrosion of the aluminum]] cladding that surrounded the [[control rod]]s. The reactor was rebuilt and redesignated CP-3′ (CP-3 prime). It was restarted in May 1950 and operated until 1954.&lt;ref name="site_a"&gt;{{cite web | title =Site A/Plot M, Illinois, Decommissioned Reactor Site Fact Sheet | publisher =United States Department of Energy | date =2009-04-05 | url =http://www.lm.doe.gov/WorkArea/linkit.aspx?LinkIdentifier=id&amp;ItemID=1279 | format =PDF | accessdate =2009-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reactor was authorized to operate up to 300 kilowatts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Nuclear Reactors Built, Being Built, or Planned: 2003 | publisher =United States Department of Energy | date =December 2003 | url =http://www.ne.doe.gov/pdfFiles/BLUEBOOK2003.pdf | format =PDF | accessdate =2009-11-07 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110716055014/http://www.ne.doe.gov/pdfFiles/BLUEBOOK2003.pdf | archivedate =2011-07-16 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two versions of the reactor were used in physics studies, fission product separations, tritium recovery from irradiated lithium, and studies of radionuclide metabolism in laboratory animals.  After the reactor was decommissioned, the fuel and heavy water were shipped to the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]]. The containment shell for the reactor had pipes, valves, and building debris placed inside and was then filled with concrete. The 800-ton shell was buried on the site in a {{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on}} deep pit. Today, a historical marker commemorates the site of CP-3 and its sister reactor [[Chicago Pile-1|CP-1/CP-2]].&lt;ref name="site_a" /&gt;

'''Classical diffusion''' is a key concept in [[fusion power]] and other fields where a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] is confined by a [[magnetic field]]. It considers collisions between [[ion]]s in the plasma that cause the particles to move to different paths and eventually leave the confinement volume. It scales with 1/B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where B is the [[magnetic field strength]], implies that confinement times can be greatly improved with small increases in field strength. In practice, the rates suggested by classical diffusion have not been found in real-world machines.

==Description==
[[Diffusion]] is a [[random walk]] process that can be quantified by the two key parameters: Δx, the step size, and Δt, the time interval when the walker takes a step. Thus, the [[diffusion coefficient]] is defined as D≡(Δx)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(Δt).

When an ion is placed in a magnetic field, it will orbit the field lines while continuing to move along that line with whatever initial velocity it had. This produces a helical path through space. Since the axial velocities will have a range of values, often based on the [[Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics]], this means the particles in the plasma will pass by others as they overtake them or are overtaken.

If one considers two such ions travelling along parallel axial paths, they can collide whenever their orbits intersect. In most geometries, this means there is a significant difference in the instantaneous velocities when the collide - one might be going "up" while the other would be going "down" in their helical paths. This causes the collisions to scatter the particles, making them random walks. Eventually, this process will cause any given ion to eventually leave the boundary of the field, and thereby escape "confinement".

In a uniform magnetic field, a particle undergoes random walk across the field lines by the step size of gyroradius ρ≡v&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;/Ω, where v&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the thermal velocity, and Ω≡qB/m, the gyrofrequency. The steps are randomized by the collisions to lose the coherence. Thus, the time step, or the decoherence time, is inverse of the collisional frequency ν&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;. The rate of diffusion is given by ν&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;ρ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with the rather favorable B&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; scaling law.

==In practice==
When the topic of controlled fusion was first being studied, it was believed that the plasmas would follow the classical diffusion rate, and this suggested that useful confinement times would be relatively easy to achieve.

However, in 1949 a team studying plasma arcs as a method of isotope separation found that the diffusion time was much greater than what was predicted by the classical method. [[David Bohm]] suggested it scaled with B. If this is true, [[Bohm diffusion]] would mean that useful confinement times would require impossibly large fields.

In practice, machines have demonstrated a wide array of diffusion rates between these two extremes.

'''''Climate Capitalism: Capitalism in the Age of Climate Change''''' is a 2011 book by L. [[Hunter Lovins]] and [[Boyd Cohen]]. It presents positive stories and examples of how profit-seeking companies are helping to save the planet, and says that "the best way to rebuild America’s economy, cities and job markets is to invest in [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and [[renewable energy]] resources, whether [[climate change]] is happening or not".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/entertainment/52913894-81/climate-lovins-capitalism-lecture.html.csp |title=Lovins lectures tonight on ‘Climate Capitalism’ at Westminster |author= |date=15 November 2011 |work=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, reviewer Gail Whiteman is unconvinced by the argument that naked greed and market forces will drive businesses to cut their [[greenhouse gas emission]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gail Whiteman |date=12 May 2011 |title=Climate economics: Corporate greening falls short |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v473/n7346/full/473149a.html |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |publisher= |volume= |issue=473 |pages=149–150 |doi=10.1038/473149a |access-date=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact mechanism that facilitates transfer is unknown, however, it is believed that viruses with a rapid mutation rate are able to overcome host-specific immunological defenses. This can occur between species that have high contact rates. It can also occur between species with low contact rates but usually through an intermediary species. Bats, for example, are mammals and can directly transfer rabies to humans through bite and also through aerosolization of bat saliva and urine which are then absorbed by human mucous membranes in the nose, mouth and eyes.&lt;ref name=McCracken&gt;{{Citation| last1 = McCracken | first1 = G | last2 = Turmelle | first2 = A | last3 = Maarten | first3 = J | display-authors = etal| title = Host Phylogeny Constrains Cross-Species Emergence and Establishments of Rabies Virus in bats | journal = Science | volume = 329| issue = 5992| pages = 676–9| date = 2010 | issn = | doi =  10.1126/science.1188836 | pmid=20689015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A host shifting event is defined as a strain that was previously [[zoonotic]] and now circulates exclusively among humans.&lt;ref name=Haven&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Haven | first1 = J | last2 = Park | first2 = AW | title = Superinfection reconciles host–parasite association and cross-species transmission | journal = Theoretical Population Biology | volume = 90 | issue = | pages = 129–134 | publisher = | location = | date = 2013  | doi =  10.1016/j.tpb.2013.09.015  | pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarity between species, for example, transfer between mammals, is believed to be facilitated by similar immunological defenses. Other factors include geographic area, intraspecies behaviours, and phylogenetic relatedness. Virus emergence relies on two factors: initial infection and sustained transmission.&lt;ref name=Parrish/&gt;

==Prevalence==
Cross-species transmission is the most significant cause of disease emergence in humans and other species. [[Wildlife]] [[zoonotic]] diseases of microbial origin are also the most common group of human emerging diseases, and CST between wildlife and [[livestock]] has appreciable economic impacts in agriculture by reducing livestock productivity and imposing export restrictions.&lt;ref name=Benavides/&gt; This makes CST of major concern for [[public health]], [[agriculture]], and [[wildlife management]].

A large proportion of viral pathogens that have emerged recently in humans are considered to have originated from various animal species. This is shown by several recent epidemics such as, [[avian flu]], [[Ebola]], [[monkey pox]], and [[Hanta virus]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Gessain | first1 = A | last2 = Rua | first2 = R | last3 = Betsem | first3 = E | last4 = Turpin | first4 = J | title = HTLV-3/4 and simian foamy retroviruses in humans: Discovery, epidemiology, cross-species transmission and molecular virology  | journal = Virology | volume = 435 | issue = 1 | pages = 187–199 | publisher = | location = | date = 2013 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682212004850 | issn = | doi =  10.1016/j.virol.2012.09.035 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence to suggest that some diseases can potentially be re-introduced to human populations through animal hosts after they have been eradicated in humans.&lt;ref name=Crosby/&gt; There is a risk of this phenomenon occurring with [[morbillivirus]]es as they can readily cross species barriers.&lt;ref name=Crosby&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Crosby | first1 = L | title = Morbillivirus cross-species infection:is there a risk for humans? | journal = Future Virology | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 1103–1113 | publisher =  | location =  | date = 2013 | url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/1179633590| issn = | doi = 10.2217/fvl.12.103 | mr =  | pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; CST can also have a significant effect on produce industries. Genotype VI-[[Avian paramyxovirus]] serotype 1 (GVI-PMV1) is a virus that arose through cross-species transmission events from [[Galliformes]] (i.e. [[chicken]]) to [[Columbiformes]], and has become prevalent in the [[poultry industry]].&lt;ref name=Chong&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Chong | first1 = YL | last2 = Lam | first2 = TT | last3 = Kim | first3 =O | last4 = Lu | first4 = H | display-authors = etal | title = Successful establishment and global dispersal of genotype VI avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 after cross species transmission | journal = Infection, Genetics and Evolution | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 260–268 | publisher =  | location =  | date = 2013  | issn = | doi =  10.1016/j.meegid.2013.04.025| mr =  | pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; CST of [[rabies]] virus variants between many different species populations is a major wildlife management concern. Introduction of these variants into non-reservoir animals increases the risk of human exposures and threatens current advances toward rabies control.&lt;ref name=Wallace&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Wallace | first1 = RM | last2 = Gilbert | first2 = A | last3 = Slate | first3 = D | last4 = Chipman | first4 = R | title = Right Place, Wrong Species: A 20-Year Review of Rabies Virus Cross Species Transmission among Terrestrial Mammals in the United States | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 9 | issue = 10 | pages = e107539 | publisher = | location = | date = 2014 | issn = | doi =  10.1371/journal.pone.0107539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many pathogens are thought to have host specialization, which explains the maintenance of distinct [[strain (biology)|strain]]s in host species.&lt;ref name=Haven/&gt; Pathogens would have to overcome their host specificity to cross to a new host species.  Some studies have argued that host specializations may be exaggerated, and pathogens are more likely to exhibit CST than previously thought.&lt;ref name=Haven/&gt; Original hosts usually have low death rates when infected with a pathogen, with [[Death (science)|fatality]] rates tending to be much higher in new hosts&lt;ref name=Chen&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Chen | first1 = EC | last2 =  Yagi | first2 = S | last3 = Kelly | first3 = KR | last4 = Mendoza | first4 = SP | display-authors = etal | title = Cross-Species Transmission of a Novel Adenovirus Associated with a Fulminant Pneumonia Outbreak in a New World Monkey Colony | journal = PLoS Pathogens | volume = 7 | issue = 7 | pages = e1002155 | publisher =  | location =  | date = 2011 | issn = | doi =  10.1371/journal.ppat.1002155| mr =  | pmid = 21779173| pmc=3136464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross-Species Transmission between Humans and Nonhuman Primates===

Due to the close relation of [[human]]s and [[nonhuman primate]]s (NHP), disease transmission between NHP and humans is relatively common and can become a major public health concern. Diseases, such as [[HIV]] and human [[adenovirus]]es have been associated with NHP interactions.&lt;ref name=Hoppe&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Hoppe | first1 = E | last2 =  Pauly | first2 = M | last3 = Gillespie | first3 = TR | last4 = Akoua-Koffi | first4 = C | display-authors = etal | title = Multiple Cross-Species Transmission Events of Human Adenoviruses (HAdV) during Hominine Evolution | journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume = 32 | issue = 8 | pages = 2072–2084 | publisher =  | location =  | date = 2015 | issn = | doi =  10.1093/molbev/msv090| mr =  | pmid = 25862141| pmc=4833075}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lemey&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Lemey | first1 = P | last2 =  Pybus | first2 = OG | last3 = Wang | first3 = B | last4 = Saksena | first4 = NK | display-authors = etal | title = Tracing the origin and history of the HIV-2 epidemic.  | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 100 | issue = 11 | pages = 6588–6592 | publisher =  | location =  | date = 2003 | issn = | doi =  10.1073/pnas.0936469100| mr =  | pmid = 12743376| pmc=164491}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In places where contact between humans and NHPs is frequent, precautions are often taken to prevent disease transmission. [[Simian foamy virus]]es (SFV) is an [[enzootic]] [[retrovirus]] that has high rates of cross-species transmission and has been known to affect humans bitten by infected NHPs.&lt;ref name=Mouinga&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Mouinga-Ondémé | first1 = A | last2 = Caron | first2 = M | last3 = Nkoghé | first3 = D | last4 = Telfer l | first4 = P | display-authors = etal | title = Cross-Species Transmission of Simian Foamy Virus to Humans in Rural Gabon, Central Africa  | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 86 | issue = 2 | pages = 1255–1260 | publisher =  | location =  | date = 2012 | url = http://jvi.asm.org/content/86/2/1255.full | issn = | doi =  10.1128/jvi.06016-11| mr =  | pmid = | pmc = 3255803}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has caused health concerns in places like Indonesia where visitors at monkey temples can contract SFV from temple macaques (''[[Macaca fascicularis]]'').&lt;ref name=Engel&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Engel | first1 = G | last2 = Hungerford | first2 = LL | last3 = Jones-Engel | first3 = L | last4 = Travis | first4 = D | display-authors = etal | title = Risk assessment: A model for predicting cross-species transmission of simian foamy virus from macaques (''M. fascicularis'') to humans at a monkey temple in bali, indonesia | journal = American Journal of Primatology | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 934–948 | publisher = | location = | date = 2006 | issn = | doi = 10.1002/ajp.20299 }}&lt;/ref&gt; TMAdV ([[titi monkey adenovirus]]) is a highly divergent, sharing &lt;57% [[pairwise comparison|pairwise]] nucleotide identity with other adenoviruses, NHP virus that had a high fatality rate (83%) in monkeys and is capable of spreading through human hosts.&lt;ref name=Chen/&gt;

==Predicting and Preventing Transmission between Species==
Prediction and monitoring are important for the study of CSTs and their effects.  However, factors that determine the origin and fate of cross-species transmission events remain unclear for the majority of human pathogens.&lt;ref name=Faria/&gt; This has resulted in the use of different [[statistical model]]s for the analyzation of CST. Some of these include risk-analysis models,&lt;ref name=Parrish2/&gt; single rate dated tip (SRDT) models,&lt;ref name=Lemey/&gt; and phylogenetic diffusion models.&lt;ref name=Faria/&gt; The study of the [[genome]]s of pathogens involved in CST events is very useful in determining their origin and fate.&lt;ref name=Faria/&gt; This is because a pathogens [[genetic diversity]] and [[mutation]] rate are key factors in determining if it is able to transmit across multiple hosts.  This makes it important for the genomes of transmission species to be partially or completely sequenced.&lt;ref name=Chen/&gt; A change in genomic structure could cause a pathogen that has narrow host range to become capable of exploiting a wider host range.&lt;ref name=Haven/&gt; [[Genetic distance]] between different species, geographical range, and other interaction barriers will also influence cross-species transmission.&lt;ref name=Faria/&gt;

One approach to risk assessment analysis of CST is to develop risk-analysis models that break the ‘‘process’’ of disease transmission into component parts. Processes and interactions that could lead to cross-species disease transmission are explicitly described as a hypothetical infection chain. Data from laboratory and field experiments is used to estimate the probability of each component, expected natural variation, and margins of error.&lt;ref name=Engel/&gt;

Different types of CST research would require different analysis pathways to meet their needs. A study on identification of viruses in bats that could spread to other mammals used the workflow:  sequencing of genomic samples → “cleaning” of raw reads → elimination of host reads and eukaryotic contaminants → de novo assembly of the remaining reads → annotation of viral contigs → molecular detection of specific viruses → phylogenetic analysis → interpretation of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Dacheux| first1 = L| last2 =  Cervantes-Gonzalez | first2 = M| last3 = Guigon| first3 = G| last4 = Thiberge | first4 = JM| display-authors = etal| title = A Preliminary Study of Viral Metagenomics of French Bat Species in Contact with Humans: Identification of New Mammalian Viruses| journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 845–53 | publisher =  | location =  | date = 2014 | issn = | doi =  10.1371/journal.pone.0087194| mr =  | pmid = 24489870| pmc=3906132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detecting CST and estimating its rate based on prevalence data is challenging.&lt;ref name=Benavides/&gt; Due to these difficulties [[computational]] methods are used to analyse CST events and the pathogens associated with them. The explosive development of [[molecular]] techniques has opened new possibilities for using phylogenetic analysis of pathogen genetics to infer [[epidemiological]] parameters.&lt;ref name=Benavides/&gt; This provides some insight into the origins of these events and how they could be addressed. Methods of CST prevention are currently using both biological and computational data. An example of this is using both [[cell biology|cellular]] [[assay]]s and [[phylogenetic]] comparisons to support a role for TRIM5α, the product of the TRIM5 gene, in suppressing interspecies transmission and emergence of retroviruses in nature.&lt;ref name=Kirmaier&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Kirmaier | first1 = A | last2 = Wu | first2 = F | last3 = Newman | first3 = RM | last4 = Hall | first4 = LR | display-authors = etal | title = TRIM5 Suppresses Cross-Species Transmission of a Primate Immunodeficiency Virus and Selects for Emergence of Resistant Variants in the New Species | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 8 | pages = e1000462 | publisher =  | location =  | date = 2013 | url = http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000462 | issn = | doi =  10.1371/journal.pbio.1000462| mr =  | pmid = 20808775 | pmc=2927514}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cross-Species Transmission Analyzation ==

===Phylogeny===
The comparison of genomic data is very important for the study of cross-species transmission. [[Phylogenetic analysis]] is used to compare genetic variation in both pathogens associated with CST and the host species that they infect. Taken together, it is possible to infer what allowed a pathogen to crossover to a new host (i.e. mutation in a pathogen, change in host susceptibility) and how this can be prevented in the future. If the mechanisms a pathogens uses to initially enter a new species are well characterized and understood a certain level of risk control and prevention can be obtained. In contact, a poor understanding of pathogens, and their associated diseases, makes it harder for preventive measures to be taken&lt;ref name=Parrish2&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Parrish | first1 = CR | last2 = Holmes | first2 = EC | last3 = Morens | first3 = DM | last4 = Park | first4 = EC | display-authors = etal | title = Cross-Species Virus Transmission and the Emergence of New Epidemic Diseases | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews : MMBR | volume = 72 | issue = 3 | pages = 457–470 | publisher = | location = | date = 2008 | issn = | doi =  10.1128/MMBR.00004-08| mr =  | pmid = 18772285| pmc=2546865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phylogenetic analysis can be used to track a pathogens history through different species populations. Even if a pathogen is new and highly divergent, phylogenetic comparison can be very insightful&lt;ref name=Chen/&gt; A useful strategy for investigating the history of epidemics caused by pathogen transmission combines [[molecular clock]] analysis, to estimate the timescale of the epidemic, and [[coalescent theory]], to infer the [[demographic]] history of the pathogen.&lt;ref name=Lemey/&gt;
When constructing phylogenies, computer databases and tools are often used.  Programs, such as [[BLAST]], are used to annotate pathogen sequences, while databases like [[GenBank]] provide information about functions based on the pathogens genomic structure. Trees are constructed using computational methods such as MPR or Bayesian Inference, and models are created depending on the needs of the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Allison | first1 = AB | last2 = Kohler | first2 = DJ | last3 = Fox | first3 = KA | last4 = Brown | first4 = JD | title = Network analysis of host–virus communities in bats and rodents reveals determinants of cross-species transmission | journal = Ecology Letters | volume = 18 | issue = 11 | pages = 1153–1162 | publisher = | location = | date = 2015 | doi =  10.1111/ele.12491| mr =  | pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Single rate dated tip (SRDT) models, for example, allows for estimates of [[wikt:time scale|timescale]] under a phylogenetic tree.&lt;ref name=Lemey/&gt; Models for CST prediction will vary depending on what parameters need to be accounted for when constructing the model.

===Most Parsimonious Reconstruction (MPR)===
[[Occam's razor|Parsimony]] is the principle in which one chooses the simplest scientific explanation that fits the evidence. In terms of building phylogenetic trees, the best [[hypothesis]] is the one that requires the fewest evolutionary changes. Using parsimony to reconstruct ancestral character states on a phylogenetic tree is a method for testing [[ecological]] and [[evolutionary]] hypotheses.&lt;ref name=Cunningham&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Cunningham | first1 = CW | last2 = Omland | first2 = KE | last3 = Oakley | first3 = TH | title = Reconstructing ancestral character states: A critical reappraisal  | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 13 | issue = 9 | pages = 361–366 | publisher =  | location =  | date = 1998 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534798013822 | issn = | doi =  10.1016/s0169-5347(98)01382-2| mr =  | pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This method can be used in CST studies to estimate the number of character changes that exist between pathogens in relation to their host.&lt;ref name=Benavides/&gt; This makes MPR useful for tracking a CST pathogen to its origins. MPR can also be used to the compare traits of host species populations. Traits and behaviours within a population could make them more susceptible to CST. For example, species which [[Animal migration|migrate]] regionally are important for spreading viruses through population networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Luis | first1 = AD | last2 = O'Shea | first2 = TJ | last3 = Hayman | first3 = DTS | last4 = Wood | first4 = JLN | title = Network analysis of host–virus communities in bats and rodents reveals determinants of cross-species transmission | journal = Ecology Letters | volume = 18 | issue = 11 | pages = 1153–1162 | publisher = | location = | date = 2015| issn = | doi =  10.1111/ele.12491| mr =  | pmid = | url = https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/1810/252687/1/Luis%20et%20al.%202015%20Ecology%20Letters.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the success of parsimony reconstructions, research suggests they are often sensitive and can sometimes be prone to bias in complex models.&lt;ref name=Cunningham/&gt; This can cause problems for CST models that have to consider many variables.  Alternatives methods, such as maximum likelihood, have been developed as an alternative to parsimony reconstruction.&lt;ref name=Cunningham/&gt;

===Using Genetic Markers===
Two methods of measuring genetic variation, [[variable number tandem repeat]]s (VNTRs) and [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]s (SNPs), have been very beneficial to the study of bacterial transmission.&lt;ref name=Benavides/&gt; VNTRs, due to the low cost and high mutation rates, make them particularly useful to detect genetic differences in recent [[outbreak]]s, and while SNPs have a lower mutation rate per locus than VNTRs, they deliver more stable and reliable genetic relationships between isolates. Both methods are used to construct phylogenies for genetic analysis, however, SNPs are more suitable for studies on phylogenies contraction.&lt;ref name=Benavides/&gt;
However, it can be difficult for these methods accurately simulate CSTs everts.  Estimates of CST based on [[phylogeny]]s made using VNTR marker can be biased towards detecting CST events across a wide range of the parameters. SNPs tend to be less biased and variable in estimates of CST when estimations of CST rates are low and low number of SNPs is used. In general, CST rate estimates using these methods are most reliable in systems with more mutations, more markers, and high genetic differences between introduced strains.&lt;ref name=Benavides/&gt; CST is very complex and models need to account for a lot of parameters to accurately represent the phenomena. Models that oversimplify reality can result in biased data. Multiple parameters such as number of mutations accumulated since introduction, [[stochasticity]], the genetic difference of strains introduced, and the sampling effort can make unbiased estimates of CST difficult even with whole-genome sequences, especially if sampling is limited, mutation rates are low, or if pathogens were recently introduced.&lt;ref name=Benavides/&gt; More information on the factors that influence CST rates is needed for the contraction of more appropriate models to study these events.

The process of using genetic markers to estimate CST rates should take into account several important factors to reduce bias. One, is that the phylogenetic tree constructed in the analysis needs to capture the underlying epidemiological process generating the tree.&lt;ref name=Benavides/&gt; The models need to account for how the genetic variability of a pathogen influences a disease in a species, not just general differences in genomic structure. Two, the strength of the analysis will depend on the amount of mutation accumulated since the pathogen was introduced in the system.&lt;ref name=Benavides/&gt; This is due to many models using amount of mutations as an indicator of CST frequency. Therefore, efforts are focused on estimating either time since introduction or the substitution rate of the marker (from laboratory experiments or genomic comparative analysis). This is important not only when using the MPR method but also for [[Likelihood]] approaches that require an estimation of the mutation rate.&lt;ref name=Benavides/&gt; Three, CST will also affect disease prevalence in the potential host, so combining both epidemiological time series data with genetic data may be an excellent approach to CST study&lt;ref name=Benavides/&gt;

===Bayesian Analysis===
Bayesian frameworks are a form of maximum likelihood-based analyses and can be very effective in cross-species transmission studies. [[Bayesian inference]] of character evolution methods can account for phylogenetic tree uncertainty and more complex scenarios, with models such as the character diffusion model currently being developed for the study of CST in [[RNA virus]]es.&lt;ref name=Benavides/&gt; A Bayesian statistical approach presents advantages over other analyses for tracking CST origins. Computational techniques allow integration over an unknown phylogeny, which cannot be directly observed, and unknown migration process, which is usually poorly understood.&lt;ref name=LemeyP&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Lemey | first1 = P | last2 =  Rambaut | first2 = A | last3 = Drummoond | first3 = AJ | last4 = Suchard | first4 = MA | display-authors = etal | title = Bayesian Phylogeography Finds Its Roots  | journal = PLoS Comput Biol | volume = 5 | issue = 9 | pages = e1000520 | publisher =  | location =  | date = 2003 | url = http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000520&amp;type=printable | issn = | doi =  10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000520| mr =  | pmid = 19779555 | pmc=2740835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bayesian frameworks are also wellsuited to bring together different kinds of information. The BEAST software, which has a strong focus on calibrated phylogenies and genealogies, illustrates this by offering a large number of complementary evolutionary models including substitution models, demographic and relaxed clock models that can be combined into a full probabilistic model. By adding spatial reconstruction, these models create the probability of [[biogeographical]] history reconstruction from genetic data.&lt;ref name=LemeyP/&gt; This could be useful for determining origins of cross-species transmissions. 
The high effectiveness of Bayesian statistical methods has made them instrumental in evolutionary studies.&lt;ref name=R&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Ronquist | first1 = F | title = Bayesian inference of character evolution | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 19 | issue = 9 | pages = 475–481 | publisher =  | location =  | date = 2004 | url = http://www.nrm.se/download/18.42129f1312d951207af800041642/1367705015783/Ronquist_TREE_2004.pdf | issn = | doi =  10.1016/j.tree.2004.07.002| mr =  | pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bayesian ancestral host reconstruction under discrete diffusion models can be used to infer the origin and effects of pathogens associated with CST.  One study on Human adenoviruses using Bayesian supported a [[gorilla]] and [[chimpanzee]] origin for the viral species, aiding prevention efforts.&lt;ref name=Hoppe/&gt; Despite presumably rare direct contact between sympatric populations of the two species, CST events can occur between them. The study also determined that two independent HAdV-B transmission events to humans occurred and that the HAdV-Bs circulating in humans are of zoonotic origin and have probably affected global health for most of our species lifetime.&lt;ref name=Hoppe/&gt;

Phylogenetic diffusion models are frequently used for phylogeographic analyses, with the inference of host jumping becoming of increasing interest.&lt;ref name=Faria/&gt; The Bayesian inference approach enables model averaging over a number of potential diffusion predictors and estimates the support and contribution of each predictor while marginalizing over phylogenetic history.&lt;ref name=Faria/&gt; For studying viral CST, the flexibility of the Bayesian statistical framework allows for the reconstruction of virus transmission between different host species while simultaneously testing and quantifying the contribution of multiple ecological and evolutionary influences of both CST spillover and host shifting.&lt;ref name=Faria/&gt; One study on rabies in bats showed geographical range overlap is a modest predictor for CST, but not for host shifts.&lt;ref name=Faria/&gt; This highlights how Bayesian inferences in models can be used for CST analysis.

In a [[steam engine]], '''cutoff''' is the point in the [[piston]] stroke at which the inlet valve is closed. On a [[steam locomotive]], the cutoff is controlled by the [[reversing gear]].

The point at which the inlet valve closes and stops the entry of steam into the cylinder from the boiler plays a crucial role in the control of a steam engine. Once the valve has closed, steam trapped in the cylinder expands [[Adiabatic process|adiabatically]]. The steam pressure drops as it expands. A late cutoff delivers full steam pressure to move the piston through its entire stroke, for maximum start-up forces.  But, since there will still be unexploited pressure in the cylinder at the end of the stroke, this is achieved at the expense of engine efficiency. In this situation the steam will still have considerable pressure remaining when it is exhausted resulting in the characteristic “chuff chuff” sound  of a steam engine.  An early cutoff has greater thermodynamic efficiency but results in a lower [[Mean effective pressure]] so less average force on the piston and is used for running the engine at higher speeds. The steam engine is the only thermodynamic engine design that can provide its maximum [[torque]] at zero revolutions per minute.

== Explanation ==
[[File:Indicator diagram steam admission.svg|thumb|250px|Schematic [[Indicator diagram]] of pressure in a steam locomotive cylinder. The pressure in the cylinder declines after cutoff as the steam pushes the piston down its bore]] Cutoff is one of the four [[valve events]]. Early cutoff is used to increase the efficiency of the engine by allowing the steam to expand for the rest of the power stroke, yielding more of its energy and conserving steam. This is known as expansive working. Late cutoff is used to provide maximum torque to the shaft at the expense of efficiency and is used to start the engine under load.

Cutoff is conventionally expressed as percentage of the power stroke of the piston; if the piston is at a quarter of its stroke at the cutoff point, the cutoff is stated as 25%.

Smaller [[stationary steam engine]]s generally have a fixed cutoff point while, in large ones, the speed and power output is generally governed by altering the cutoff, frequently under [[Centrifugal governor|governor]] control using an [[expansion valve (steam engine)|expansion valve]] or [[Trip valve|trip gear]]. In steam engines for transport, it is desirable to be able to alter the cutoff over a wide range. For starting and at low speed and heavy load, the cylinders need steam supply at maximum pressure for almost the full length of the stroke. In a two-cylinder locomotive, for example, the maximum or 'full gear' cutoff is typically about 85%. At high speeds, the cutoff may be 15% of the piston stroke or less. Steam engines used in boats and ships operate under a constant, unvarying load through the [[propeller]] and so have a fixed cutoff, with speed being controlled through the regulator.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} 

Providing variable cutoff is an important function of the [[valve gear]].

'''Demolition waste''' is waste debris from destruction of buildings, roads, bridges, or other structures.&lt;ref name=Sustainable&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/smm/sustainable-management-construction-and-demolition-materials|title=Sustainable Management of Construction and Demolition Materials - US EPA|first=US|last=EPA,OSWER,ORCR|date=|website=US EPA|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debris varies in composition, but the major components, by weight, in the US include [[concrete]], wood products, asphalt [[shingles]], brick and clay tile, steel, and drywall. &lt;ref name=Fact&gt;https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-11/documents/2014_smmfactsheet_508.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; There is the potential to recycle many elements of demolition waste.&lt;ref name=Sustainable/&gt;  

== Composition ==
In 2014, 505.1 million tons of demolition debris was generated in the US. Out of the 505.1 million tons, the debris was composed of 353.6 million tons of concrete, 76.6 million tons of asphalt concrete, 35.8 million tons of wood product, 12.7 million tons of asphalt shingles, 11.8 million tons of brick and clay tile, 10.3 million tons of drywall and plaster, and 4.3 million tons of steel. &lt;ref name=Fact/&gt;  
 
== Disposal ==
Before demolition debris is extracted, contamination from [[lead]], [[asbestos]] or different [[hazardous materials]] must be resolved. &lt;ref name=Harm&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/large-scale-residential-demolition/harmful-materials-and-residential-demolition|title=Harmful Materials and Residential Demolition - US EPA|first=US EPA,REG|last=05|date=|website=US EPA|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazardous materials must be disposed of separately, according to federal regulation.&lt;ref name=Harm/&gt; Demolition debris can be disposed of in either Construction and Demolition Debris landfills or municipal solid waste landfills.&lt;ref name=Ohio &gt;{{cite web|url=http://epa.ohio.gov/dmwm/Home/CDD.aspx|title=Construction and Demolition Debris (C&amp;DD)|first=Ohio EPA Division of Materials and Waste|last=Management|date=|website=epa.ohio.gov|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, debris may also be sorted and recycled. Sorting may happen as deconstruction on the demolition site, off-site at a sorting location, or at a Construction and Demolition recycling center.&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt; Once sorted, materials are managed separately and recycled accordingly. 

== Recycling ==

'''Concrete and Brick'''

{{Main|Concrete recycling}}

Concrete and brick can be recycled by crushing it into rubble. &lt;ref name=Colorado&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/HM_sw-beneficial-use-of-asphalt-brick-concrete.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207134250/https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/HM_sw-beneficial-use-of-asphalt-brick-concrete.pdf|archivedate=2017-02-07|title=Wayback Machine|author=|date=7 February 2017|website=archive.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once sorted, screened and contaminants are removed, reclaimed concrete or brick can be used in concrete aggregate, fill, road base, or riprap.&lt;ref name=Colorado/&gt; Mobile concrete crushers also allow for recycling of concrete on-site.

'''Wood'''

{{Main|Timber recycling}}

Wood can be reused, repurposed, recycled, or burned as bioenergy.&lt;ref name=Sustainable/&gt; Reused wood to eliminate the need for full-size new lumber if used for smaller building components. Repurposed or recycled wood can be used in pathways, coverings, mulches, compost, animal bedding, or particleboard.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timberstewardship.org.au/images/pdf_documents/wood_packaging_recycling_brochure_final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Using recycled wood as a bioenergy feedstock is advantageous because it has lower water content, about 20% water, compared to virgin lumber, about 60% water.

'''Drywall'''

Drywall is made primarily of gypsum. Once the gypsum is depapered, it can be added in cement production, as a soil amendment, used in aerated composting, or recycled into new drywall. Gypsum recycling can be particularly beneficial because in landfill conditions gypsum will release hydrogen sulfide, a toxic gas.

'''Asphalt'''

Asphalt, from shingles or asphalt concrete, is typically recycled and used in pavement.

'''Metal'''

{{Main|Scrap}}

Scrap metal is an established industry focused on the collection, buying, selling, and recycling of salvaged materials. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-04/documents/scrap_metal_final_v4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

An often mentioned incentive for using [[biodiesel]] is its capacity to lower [[greenhouse gas]] emissions compared to those of [[fossil fuels]]. Whether this is true or not depends on many factors. A general critic to biodiesel is the [[land use]] change, which have potential to cause even more emissions than what would be caused by using fossil fuels alone.&lt;ref name="Science, Land Use Change"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fargione |first=Joseph |author2=Jason Hill |author3=David Tilman |author4=Stephen Polasky |author5=Peter Hawthorne |date=2008-02-29 |title=Land Clearing and the Biofuel Carbon Debt |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |doi=10.1126/science.1152747 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1152747 |format=fee required |accessdate=2008-04-29 |volume=319 |pages=1235–8 |pmid=18258862 |issue=5867 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413151143/http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1152747 |archivedate=April 13, 2008 }}
*{{cite press release | title = New Study Raises Major Questions on Biofuels | publisher = The Nature Conservancy in Minnesota | date =2008-02-07 | url =http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/minnesota/press/press3348.html | accessdate =2008-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet this problem would be fixed with [[algal biofuel]] which can use land unsuitable for agriculture. 

[[Carbon dioxide]] is one of the major [[greenhouse gas]]es. Although the burning of biodiesel produces carbon dioxide emissions similar to those from ordinary fossil fuels, the [[plant]] feedstock used in the production absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere when it grows. Plants absorb carbon dioxide through a process known as [[photosynthesis]] which allows it to store energy from sunlight in the form of sugars and starches. After the [[biomass]] is converted into biodiesel and burned as fuel the energy and carbon is released again. Some of that energy can be used to power an engine while the carbon dioxide is released back into the atmosphere.

When considering the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions it is therefore important to consider the whole production process and what indirect effects such production might cause. The effect on carbon dioxide emissions is highly dependent on production methods and the type of feedstock used. Calculating the [[carbon intensity]] of biofuels is a complex and inexact process, and is highly dependent on the assumptions made in the calculation. A calculation usually includes:

* Emissions from growing the feedstock (e.g. Petrochemicals used in fertilizers)
* Emissions from transporting the feedstock to the factory
* Emissions from processing the feedstock into biodiesel
* Absorption of CO2 Emissions from growing the feedstock
Other factors can be very significant but are sometimes not considered. These include:
* Emissions from the change in land use of the area where the fuel feedstock is grown.
* Emissions from transportation of the biodiesel from the factory to its point of use
* The efficiency of the biodiesel compared with standard diesel

&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is ongoing research to improve the efficiency of the production process.&lt;ref name=SHU /&gt;&lt;ref name="EEA report" /&gt; Biodiesel produced from used cooking oil or other waste fat could reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by as much as 85%.&lt;ref name=UKRTFO/&gt; As long as the feedstock is grown on existing cropland, land use change has little or no effect on greenhouse gas emissions. However, there is concern that increased feedstock production directly affects the rate of deforestation.

== Pollution ==
In the United States, biodiesel is the only [[alternative fuel]] to have successfully completed the Health Effects Testing requirements (Tier I and Tier II) of the [[Clean Air Act (1990)]].

Biodiesel can reduce the direct tailpipe-emission of [[particulate]]s, small particles of solid combustion products, on vehicles with particulate filters by as much as 20 percent compared with low-sulfur (&lt; 50 ppm) diesel. Particulate emissions as the result of production are reduced by around 50 percent compared with fossil-sourced diesel.{{sfn|Beer et al.|2004}}

== Biodegradation ==
A [[University of Idaho]] study compared biodegradation rates of biodiesel, neat vegetable oils, biodiesel and petroleum diesel blends, and neat 2-D diesel fuel. Using low concentrations of the product to be degraded (10 ppm) in nutrient and sewage sludge amended solutions, they demonstrated that biodiesel degraded at the same rate as a dextrose control and 5 times as quickly as petroleum diesel over a period of 28 days, and that biodiesel blends doubled the rate of petroleum diesel degradation through [[co-metabolism]].&lt;ref name=uidaho04&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uidaho.edu/bioenergy/BiodieselEd/publication/04.pdf |title=Biodegradability, BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, COD and Toxicity of Biodiesel Fuels |date=2004-12-03 |accessdate=2008-04-30 |format=PDF&amp;nbsp;64&amp;nbsp;KB |work=National Biodiesel Education Program, University of Idaho |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410055942/http://www.uidaho.edu/bioenergy/BiodieselEd/publication/04.pdf |archivedate=April 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The same study examined [[soil retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]] using 10 000 ppm of biodiesel and petroleum diesel, and found biodiesel degraded at twice the rate of petroleum diesel in soil. In all cases, it was determined biodiesel also degraded more completely than petroleum diesel, which produced poorly degradable undetermined intermediates. Toxicity studies for the same project demonstrated no mortalities and few toxic effects on rats and rabbits with up to 5000&amp;nbsp;mg/kg of biodiesel. Petroleum diesel showed no mortalities at the same concentration either, however toxic effects such as hair loss and urinary discolouring were noted with concentrations of &gt;2000&amp;nbsp;mg/l in rabbits.:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Biodegradation in Aquatic Environments ==

As biodiesel becomes more widely used, it is important to consider how consumption affects water quality and aquatic ecosystems. Research examining the biodegradability of different biodiesel fuels found that all of the biofuels studied (including Neat Rapeseed oil, Neat Soybean oil, and their modified ester products) were “readily biodegradable” compounds, and had a relatively high biodegradation rate in water.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, X.; Peterson, C. L.; Reece, D.; Moller, G.; Haws, R. Biodegradability of Biodiesel in the Aquatic Environment. ASABE 1998, 41(5), 1423-1430&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the presence of biodiesel can increase the rate of diesel biodegradation via co-metabolism. As the ratio of biodiesel is increased in biodiesel/diesel mixtures, the faster the diesel is degraded. Another study using controlled experimental conditions also showed that fatty acid methyl esters, the primary molecules in biodiesel, degraded much faster than petroleum diesel in sea water.&lt;ref&gt;DeMello, J. A.; Carmichael, C. A.; Peacock, E. E.; Nelson, R. K.; Arey, J. S.; Reddy, C. M. Biodegradation and Environmental Behavior of Biodiesel Mixtures in the Sea: An Initial Study. Marine Poll. Bull. 2007, 54, 894-904&lt;/ref&gt;

== Carbonyl Emissions ==

When considering the emissions from fossil fuel and biofuel use, research typically focuses on major pollutants such as hydrocarbons. It is generally recognized that using biodiesel in place of diesel results in a substantial reduction in regulated gas emissions, but there has been a lack of information in research literature about the non-regulated compounds which also play a role in air pollution.&lt;ref name="Tan, J. 2009"&gt;He, C.; Ge, Y.; Tan, J.; You, K.; Han, X.; Wang, J.; You, Q.; Shah, A. N. Comparison of Carbonyl Compounds Emissions from Diesel Engine Fueled with Biodiesel and Diesel. Atmos. Environ. 2009, 43, 3657-3661&lt;/ref&gt; One study focused on the emissions of non-criteria carbonyl compounds from the burning of pure diesel and biodiesel blends in heavy-duty diesel engines. The results found that carbonyl emissions of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, acetone, propionaldehyde and butyraldehyde, were higher in biodiesel mixtures than emissions from pure diesel. Biodiesel use results in higher carbonyl emissions but lower total hydrocarbon emissions, which may be better as an alternative fuel source. Other studies have been done which conflict with these results, but comparisons are difficult to make due to various factors that differ between studies (such as types of fuel and engines used). In a paper which compared 12 research articles on carbonyl emissions from biodiesel fuel use, it found that 8 of the papers reported increased carbonyl compound emissions while 4 showed the opposite.&lt;ref name="Tan, J. 2009"/&gt; This is evidence that there is still much research required on these compounds.

[[File:Blast Area Security.webm|thumb|A video on safety when using explosives in the workplace]]
'''Explosives safety''' originated as a formal program in the [[United States]] in the aftermath of [[World War I]] when several ammunition storage areas were destroyed in a series of mishaps. The most serious occurred at [[Picatinny Arsenal Ammunition Storage Depot]], New Jersey, in July, 1926 when an electrical storm led to fires that caused explosions and widespread destruction. The severe property damage and 19 fatalities led Congress to empower a board of Army and Naval officers to investigate the Picatinny Arsenal disaster and determine if similar conditions existed at other ammunition depots. The board reported in its findings that this mishap could recur, prompting [[United States Congress|Congress]] to establish a permanent board of colonels to develop explosives safety standards and ensure compliance beginning in 1928. This organization evolved into the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] Explosives Safety Board (DDESB) and is chartered in Title 10 of the US Code. Today, the DDESB authors DOD Manual 6055.9, Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards. It also evaluates scientific data which may adjust those standards, reviews and approves all explosives site plans for new construction, and conducts worldwide visits to locations containing US title munitions.

==US Air Force==
The [[United States Air Force]] counterpart to the DDESB is the [[Air Force Safety Center]] (AFSEC/SEW). Similarly safety functions are found at major command headquarters, intermediate command headquarters and at unit level as the weapons safety office. Quantity-Distance (QD) has evolved into the foundation of DOD 6055.9-STD, Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards.  The current Air Force regulation governing explosives safety is Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 91-201.  AFMAN 91-201 was written using DODI 6055.9 as a parent regulation, and in most cases will follow the limitations set forth in the DODI (excluding mission specific requirements).  The Air Force deviates from DODI 6055.9 using AFMAN 91-201 as their primary source document to allow for deviation from many of the requirements of the DODI as long as the risks of doing so are accepted at the appropriate level.

==US Army==
The [[United States Army]] counterpart to the DDESB is the U.S. Army Technical Center for Explosives Safety (USATCES). The USATCES is located with the [[Defense Ammunition Center (United States)|Defense Ammunition Center]] on [[McAlester Army Ammunition Plant]], near McAlester, Oklahoma . USATCES is responsible for providing ammunition and explosives (A&amp;E) safety worldwide by acting as the field office of the Department of Army Safety responsible for A&amp;E safety. The USATCES also acts as the Army agency having safety oversight of clean-up of [[Formerly Used Defense Sites|Former Used Defense Sites (FUDS)]]&lt;ref&gt;1 [http://www.azdeq.gov/environ/waste/sps/download/state/fuds.pdf azdeq.gov] retrieved 2011-11-23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2 [https://environment.usace.army.mil/what_we_do/fuds/ U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).] retrieved 2011-11-23&lt;/ref&gt; and Former Toxic Chemical Agent Sites where munitions from all branches of service disposed of A&amp;E by burial or dumping up until the end of the [[Vietnam War]]. The USATCES acts as the Army’s safety watchdog for disposal of chemical ammunition at the Army’s Chemical Disposal Facilities. As part of Army's Ordinance Corps under TRADOC Specially trained Civilian Explosives Safety Personnel [Quality Assurance Specialist (Ammunition Surveillance) (QASAS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r702_12.pdf apd.army.mil] retrieved 2011-11-23&lt;/ref&gt;]  and Safety Specialist that have received specialized training in A&amp;E Safety) from the USATCES are deployed worldwide, wherever the U.S. Army has A&amp;E. Their mission is to provide A&amp;E safety to the soldier, the public, and the environment making sure the Army’s A&amp;E is not only stored safely but ready, reliable, and lethal when the U.S. military needs it.

==Net Explosives Weight (NEW)==
The net explosives weight (NEW) (or TNT Equivalence) is based on explosives compounds that are equal to one  expressed by the value of “K,” using the terminology K9, K11, K18, to mean K = 9, K = 11, and K = 18.

==Blast Wave Phenomena==
A Blast Wave Phenomenon is an incident involving the violent release of energy created by detonation of an explosive device. The sudden and intense pressure disturbance is termed the “blast wave.” The blast wave is characterized by an almost instantaneous rise from ambient pressure to a peak incident pressure (Pi). This pressure increase or “shock front,” travels radially outward from the detonation point, with a diminishing velocity that is always in excess of the speed of sound in that medium. Gas molecules making up the front move at lower velocities. This velocity, which is called the “particle velocity,” is associated with the “dynamic pressure,” or the pressure formed by the winds produced by the shock front. As the shock front expands into increasingly larger volumes of the medium, the incident pressure decreases and, generally, the duration of the pressure-pulse increase. If the shock wave strikes a rigid surface (e.g., a building) at an angle to the direction of the wave’s propagation, a reflected pressure is instantly developed on the surface and this pressure rises to a value that exceeds the incident pressure. This reflected pressure is a function of the incident wave’s pressure and the angle formed between the rigid surface and the plane of the shock front.

==Fragments==
An important consideration in the analysis of the hazards associated with an explosion is the effect of any fragments produced. Fragmentation most commonly occur in high explosives events, fragmentation may occur in any incident involving ammunition and explosives (A&amp;E). Depending on their origin, fragments are referred to as “primary” or “secondary” fragments.

Primary fragments result from the shattering of a container (e.g., shell casings, kettles, hoppers, and other containers used in the manufacture of explosives and rocket engine housings) in direct contact with the explosive. These fragments usually are small, initially travel at thousands of feet per second, and may be lethal at long distances from an explosion.

Secondary fragments are debris from structures and other items in close proximity to the explosion. These fragments, which are somewhat larger in size than primary fragments and initially travel at hundreds of feet per second, do not normally travel as far as primary fragments.

==Thermal Hazards==
Generally, thermal hazards from explosives events are of less concern than blast and fragment hazards. With the release of energy from an explosion is heat. The amount of heat varies with the energetic compound (explosive). All explosives compound molecules are potentially unstable held together with weak bonds in their outer shell. When this weak bond is broken heat and energy is violently released. It normally takes longer for the thermal blast to incur. Injury from thermal effects follows the blast and fragmentation effects which happen almost instantaneously.  This does not imply that there is a time lapse between blast and fragmentation effects of explosives; in fact it happens so fast that humans cannot notice the delay without specialized equipment.  The time available to react to a thermal event does increases survivability by rapid equipment designed to react in a fragment of a second. The primary effect of the thermal effect from an explosive detonation on structures, material, and ammunition and explosives (A&amp;E) is their partial or total destruction by fire. The primary concern for explosives safety with a fire involving A&amp;E is that it may transition to a more severe reaction, causing detonations of additional or more hazardous explosives devises and placing more people or property at a greater degree of risk of damage, destruction, injury, or death.

==Susan Test==
{{redirect|Susan Test|the ''Johnny Test'' character|List of Johnny Test characters#Susan and Mary Test}}
Following the [[1966 Palomares B-52 crash]] and the [[1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash]], accident investigators concluded that the conventional explosives used at the time in nuclear weapons were not [[Chemical stability|stable]] enough to withstand the forces involved in an [[aircraft]] accident.  The finding triggered research by scientists in the United States into safer conventional explosives that could be used in nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l77rP6LA8TEC|title=Explosive Effects and Applications|author=Jonas A. Zukas, William P. Walters|pages=305–307|isbn=0-387-95558-5|publisher=Springer|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] developed the "Susan Test" — a standard test that uses a special projectile whose design simulates an aircraft accident by squeezing and nipping explosive material between metal surfaces.  The test projectile is fired under controlled conditions at a hard surface to measure the reactions and thresholds of different explosives to an impact.

==Explosives Safety Specialist==
This is a highly trained and skilled civilian professional usually a QASAS or a Safety Specialist that has been trained to evaluate risk and hazards involved with conventional, guided missiles and toxic chemical ammunition operations. Department of Defense Standards requires that only trained and certified personnel are permitted to participate in operations involving ammunition, explosives, and/or explosive components, guided missiles, and toxic chemicals. They are responsible for providing protection from the effects of ammunition and explosives by evaluation of a set of standards developed by the Department of Defense and reinforced by additional regulations by the branch of military service responsible for the explosives item. 
They develop safety programs to minimize losses due to injuries and property damage. They try to eliminate unsafe practices and conditions on sites where ammunition and explosives (A&amp;E) are used or stored. Military explosives safety specialist are deployed along with U.S. Military forces to maintain safe storage and use of A&amp;E.   They are responsible to recommend to military command ways to store A&amp;E that reduce the risk of injury or death to service men and women in case of an accidental detonation or if the A&amp;E supply is hit by enemy attack.  
 
Much of the work of military explosives safety specialist is identical to their civilian counterparts. They have offices where they analyze data and write reports to upper commands on the storage of A&amp;E.  Much of their time is spent reviewing or preparing explosives safety site plans. An explosives site plan (ESS) is the composite risk management (CRM) process associated with explosives/toxic chemical activities to ensure the minimum risk to personnel, equipment, and assets, while meeting mission requirements. The damage or injury potential of explosions is determined by the separation distance between potential explosion sites (PES) and exposed sites (ES); the ability of the PES to suppress blast overpressure, primary and secondary fragments; and the ability of the ES to resist explosion effects. Planning for the proper location and construction of A&amp;E facilities and surrounding facilities exposed to A&amp;E facilities is a key element of the explosives/toxic chemical site planning process. This management process also ensures that risks above those normally accepted for A&amp;E activities are identified and approved at the proper level of command.

Explosives Safety Specialist must often travel to different storage sites to verify that the military installation is meeting the service explosives safety regulations.

Explosives Safety Specialist often works with other safety professionals. They are required to know OSHA, EPA, NFPA and other consensus standards when looking at safety and if these regulations are stricter than their service regulation they must apply these standards and regulations. They must also know Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) regulations dealing with A&amp;E and apply those standards if it is required.  They must be able to convince people the need for following prescribes explosives safety standards/regulations. They must also work with ammunition cleanup sites insuring that safety laws and regulations as well as industry standards are followed. They should be good at solving problems.

The military is not the only industry to use explosives safety specialist but are by far the largest employer.  Mining and construction also use explosives safety specialist to evaluate hazard and risk from explosives and blasting operations. Ammunition and explosives manufactures also use these professionals. Outside the military explosives safety specialist must apply and be knowledgeable of ATF, OSHA, EPA, NFPA, as well as state and local regulations dealing with safety of A&amp;E.

The '''Felicity effect''' is an effect observed during [[acoustic emission]] in a structure undergoing repeated mechanical loading. It negates the effect of emission silence in the structure that is often observed from the related [[Kaiser effect (material science)|Kaiser effect]] at high loads. A material demonstrating the Felicity effect gives off acoustic emission at a lower load than one previously reached in an increasing load cycle regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndt-ed.org/EducationResources/CommunityCollege/Other%20Methods/AE/AE_Theory-Sources.htm |title=AE Sources |publisher=Ndt-ed.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndt.net/ndtaz/content.php?id=471 |title=Felicity Effect |publisher=Ndt.net |accessdate=2014-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3VePAhhi_OsC&amp;lpg=PA424&amp;ots=OUhaQMbexL&amp;dq=felicity%20effect&amp;pg=PA424#v=onepage&amp;q=felicity%20effect&amp;f=false |title=Infrastructure Health in Civil Engineering: Theory and Components - Mohammed M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5852">'''Flame lift-off''' in oil fired pressure jet burners is an unwanted condition in which the [[flame]] and [[Oil burner|burner]] become separated. This condition is most commonly created by excessive [[combustion air]] and often results in the loss of flame as the photo-electric cell fails to register the light of the flame, this in turn results in a safety lockout of the control box.

==Other outcomes==
Other outcomes may be experienced: –
# There may be delayed [[Combustion|ignition]] as the oil spray is too far forward for the [[electrode]]s to ignite, only when the oil spray has filled the [[combustion chamber]] will the mixture ignite. In this condition it is likely that the excessive volume of unburnt oil will ignite with explosive ignition.
# The oil mixture will fail to ignite resulting in safety lockout of the control box.

'''Liquid level floats''', also known as '''float balls''', are spherical, cylindrical, oblong or similarly shaped objects, made from either rigid or flexible material, that are [[buoyant]] in water and other liquids. They are non-electrical hardware frequently used as visual sight-indicators for surface demarcation and [[level measurement]]. They may also be incorporated into switch mechanisms or translucent fluid-tubes as a component in monitoring or controlling liquid level.

Liquid level floats, or float switches, use the principle of material buoyancy (differential densities) to follow fluid levels. Solid floats are often made of plastics with a density less than water or other application liquid, and so they float. Hollow floats filled with air are much less dense than water or other liquids, and are appropriate for some applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Learn More About Liquid Level Floats|url=http://www.globalspec.com/LearnMore/Sensors_Transducers_Detectors/Level_Sensing/Liquid_Level_Floats|publisher=globalspec.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stainless Steel Magnetic floats are tubed magnetic floats, used for reed switch activation; they have a hollow tubed connection running through them. These magnetic floats have become standard equipment where strength, corrosion resistance and buoyancy are necessary. They are manufactured by welding two drawn half shells together. The welding process is critical for the strength and durability of the float. The weld is a full penetration weld providing a smoothly finished seam, hardly distinguishable from the rest of the float surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mechanical &amp; Magnetic Floats|url=http://www.deeter.co.uk/products/mechanical-magnetic-floats|publisher=deeter.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1565">'''Fold number''' refers to how many [[double fold (paper testing)|double folds]] that are required to cause rupture of a paper test piece under standardized conditions. Fold number is defined in ISO 5626:1993 as the [[antilogarithm]] of the mean folding endurance:&lt;ref&gt;ISO 5626:1993 Paper &amp;ndash; Determination of folding endurance, 3.3&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f=\text{antilog}_{10} \frac{\textstyle\sum_{i=1}^n F_i}{n}=10^{\frac{\textstyle\sum_{i=1}^n F_i}{n}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f'' is the fold number, ''F&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the folding endurance for each test piece and ''n'' is total number of test pieces used.

In the introduction of ISO 5626:1993 it is emphasized that fold number, as defined in that very International Standard, does not equal the mean number of double folds observed. The latter is however still the definition used in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;ISO 5626:1993 Paper &amp;ndash; Determination of folding endurance, Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; If the numerical value of the folding endurance is not rounded off, these will however be equal.

In the former Swedish standard SS 152005 ("Pappersordlista") from 1992, with paper related terms defined in Swedish and English, fold number is explained as "the number of double folds which a test strip withstands under specified conditions before a break occurs in the strip"; that is, ''not'' the antilogarithm of the mean folding endurance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6578">The main '''fuel tax in Australia''' is an [[excise tax]], to which is added a [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|Goods and Services Tax]] ("GST"). Both taxes are levied by the federal government. In [[Australia]], like [[Canada]], the GST (in Australia's case of 10%) is applied on top of the fuel excise tax. In some cases, businesses may be entitled to exemptions or rebates for fuel excise tax, including [[tax credits]] and certain excise-free fuel sources.

The double dipping (GST imposed on the excise tax) was fully compensated for by lowering the excise at the time the GST was introduced in 2001{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}. While the excise stopped being indexed for inflation in 2001, it was reintroduced in 2014 (see History below).

The tax collected is partly used to fund national road infrastructure projects and repair roads, but most of it (approximately 75%) goes into general revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/raise-highway-spend-from-fuel-tax-nrma-20100103-lmq2.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Raise highway spend from fuel tax: NRMA | date=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excise tax rates==
The excise tax on commonly used fuels in Australia as of October 2018:
* A$0.412 per litre on [[unleaded petrol]] fuel (including standard, blended ([[E10 fuel|E10]]) and premium grades)
* A$0.412 per litre on [[diesel fuel]] (ultra-low sulphur/conventional)
* A$0.134 per litre on [[liquified petroleum gas]] used as fuel ([[autogas]] or LPG as it is commonly known in Australia).
* A$0.081 per litre on [[ethanol]] fuel for use as fuel in an internal combustion engine (which can be reduced/removed with grants)
* A$0.041 per litre on [[biodiesel]] (which can be reduced/removed with grants)

'''Note:''' Gasoline for use as fuel in an aircraft is taxed at $0.03556 per litre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Excise-and-excise-equivalent-goods/Fuel-excise/Excise-rates-for-fuel/#FuelDef2|publisher=ATO|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal government increased the fuel excise tax with effect from 10 November 2014 by restoring CPI indexation to the tax every six months, on 1 February and 1 August.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Fuel-schemes/In-detail/Fuel-tax-credits---for-GST-registered-businesses/Overview/Fuel-tax-credits---changes-from-1-July-2014/?anchor=Ratesandtools#Ratesandtools ATO - Fel Schemes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821024022/https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Fuel-schemes/In-detail/Fuel-tax-credits---for-GST-registered-businesses/Overview/Fuel-tax-credits---changes-from-1-July-2014/?anchor=Ratesandtools#Ratesandtools |date=August 21, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From that date the fuel excise tax increased to 38.6 cents per litre.

The excise tax on commonly used fuels in Australia as of 1 October 2018 is:
* A$0.412 per litre on unleaded petrol fuel (including standard, blended (E10) and premium grades)
* A$0.412 per litre on diesel fuel
* A$0.134 per litre on liquified petroleum gas used as fuel (autogas or LPG as it is commonly known in Australia)
In addition all fuels are subject to 10% Goods and Services Tax(GST).

'''Note:''' Gasoline for use as fuel in an aircraft is taxed at $0.03556 per litre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ato.gov.au/business/excise-and-excise-equivalent-goods/fuel-excise/excise-rates-for-fuel/|title=Excise rates for fuel|publisher=ATO|accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also a number of various [[grant (money)|grants]] and [[incentive schemes]] involving tax credits and rebates that generally apply to businesses or industries that rely heavily on the use of fuels, such as [[transport]] and [[aviation]]. There are also rebates that encourage the production and importation of [[clean fuels]].

== History ==
The Commonwealth introduced a twice yearly indexation for [[Consumer Price Index]] of fuel excise taxes in 1983. The states used to levy fuel franchise fees until the [[High Court of Australia]] in ''[[Ha v New South Wales]]'' (1997) ruled that a licence fee based on the value of tobacco was unconstitutional, as it was an excise tax that only the Commonwealth can levy. The ruling brought into doubt the revenues of the states. In consequence, the federal government introduced a fuel excise tax and gave the revenue to the states.

In 2001, the [[Howard Government]] adjusted the excise rates because of the introduction of the [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|GST]] and stopped the automatic indexation of the fuel excise tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004B00862| title= Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001|last=Ireland|first=Ian|date=2001-06-04|work=Bills Digest No. 142  2000-01|publisher=Department of the Parliamentary Library|accessdate=2009-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second phase of the Australian Fuel Tax Credits Scheme came into effect on 1 July 2008. Under these changes, all off-road business use of fuel became eligible for subsidies. In other words, businesses that do not run large vehicle fleets but consume large amounts of fuel in business processes (such as mining, manufacturing, construction, plant operations) became eligible for a fuel tax credit.

[[Queensland]] used to provide an 8.354c/L subsidy on most fuels sold in the state, including on unleaded, blended unleaded, LPG and ethanol. The subsidy reflected the lower franchise fee Queensland charged compared to other states prior to 1997. This was usually reflected by an 8.354c/L price difference at the pump, as the subsidy was paid directly to retailers. The subsidy was removed from 1 July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treasury.qld.gov.au/services/grants/fuel.shtml |title=Fuel Subsidy Scheme |date=2009-09-30 |publisher=Queensland Treasury |accessdate=2009-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810091220/http://www.treasury.qld.gov.au/services/grants/fuel.shtml |archivedate=2009-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The indexation of the fuel excise tax was reintroduced by the [[Abbott Government]] from 10 November 2014, with indexation being effected twice a year, on 1 February and 1 August.

While optimizing the magnetic field, theoretical and experimental results of the TF profile are compared using a combination of fast and slow capacitor banks. The magnetic field produced by poloidal field (PF) coils are compared with theoretically predicted values. 

It is found that calculated results are in good agreement with experimental measurement. An economical [[microwave]] source of 2.45 ± 0.02 GHz is fabricated using a [[Cavity magnetron|magnetron]] obtained from a household microwave oven. Pulsed-mode operation of the magnetron is achieved through certain necessary modifications in the circuit. The magnetic field is upgraded to enhance the microwave power, where an additional [[electromagnet]] is introduced around the magnetron cavity that confines the fast moving electrons. This modified microwave source is sufficient to achieve the breakdown in GLAST-II with improved plasma current of 5kA.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khan|first=R.|last2=Nazir|first2=M.|last3=Ali|first3=A.|last4=Hussain|first4=S.|last5=Vorobyev|first5=G.M.|date=Jan 2018|title=Development of microwave pre-ionization source for GLAST tokamak|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0920379617308992|journal=Fusion Engineering and Design|volume=126|pages=10–14|doi=10.1016/j.fusengdes.2017.11.002|issn=0920-3796|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diagnostics ===
GLAST-III retained most of the diagnostics used in GLAST-I and GLAST-II, but a newly developed spectroscopic system based on linear [[photodiode]] array was installed on the upgraded GLAST-III for spatial and temporal characterization of hydrogen discharge through light emission. The spectral range of each silicon photodiode is from 300 nm to 1100 nm with response time of 10 ns and active area of 5 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (circular). The light from the plasma is collected through holes along 4 line-of-sight channels with spatial resolution of about 5 cm passing from entire poloidal cross section. The photodiode's signals located at position of 10 and 14 cm from inboard side show fluctuations in the central plasma region. Moreover, the sequence of plasma lighting shows that plasma instigates from the central resonant field region and then expands outwards. At lower pressure, outboard movement of the plasma is slower suggesting better plasma confinement. In addition to photodiode array, an [[optical spectrometer]] (Ocean Optics HR2000+) has been used to record the visible spectrum over the selected range (597–703 nm) with a spectral resolution of 0.15 nm. The studies have been conducted during initial phase of plasma formation for two different hydrogen gas fill pressures. The triple probe is used to get time-resolved information on plasma parameters in the edge region. The time evolution of whole discharge including microwave pre-ionization phase and current formation phase has been demonstrated by temporal profiles of light emission and plasma floating potential.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Gallium antimonide''' (GaSb) is a [[semiconductor|semiconducting]] compound of [[gallium]] and [[antimony]] of the III-V family. It has a [[lattice constant]] of about 0.61 [[nanometre|nm]].

==History==
The intermetallic compound GaSb was first prepared in 1926 by [[Victor Goldschmidt]], who directly combined the elements under an inert gas atmosphere and reported on GaSb's lattice constant, which has since been revised. Goldschmidt also synthesized [[gallium phosphide]] and [[gallium arsenide]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldschmidt, V. M., ''Skr. Akad.'' ''Oslo'', '''8''' (1926).&lt;/ref&gt; The Ga-Sb phase equilibria was investigated in 1955 by Koster&lt;ref&gt;Koster, W.; Thoma, B., ''Z. Metallkd''. '''46''', 291 (1955).&lt;/ref&gt; and by Greenfield.&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, I. G.; Smith, R. L., ''Trans. AIME'' '''203''', 351 (1955).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
GaSb can be used for [[Infrared detector]]s, [[infrared]] [[LED]]s and [[semiconductor laser|lasers]] and [[transistors]], and [[thermophotovoltaic]] systems.

'''Glow fuel''' is a [[fuel]] source used in [[model engine]]s – generally the same or similar fuels can be used in [[Physical model|model]] [[model aircraft|airplanes]], [[Radio-controlled helicopter|helicopters]], [[Radio-controlled car|cars]] and [[Model boats|boats]].  Glow fuel can be burned by very simple two-stroke engines or by more complicated four-stroke engines, and these engines can provide impressive amounts of power for their very small size. Glow fuel is primarily for two-stroke engines with the need for oil mixed in the fuel and limited exhaust and fuel/air between cycles. [[Top Fuel]] race cars with 4-stroke engines may also use glow fuel, but in this case it does not contain appreciable oil.

==Name==
Other commonly used names are '''nitro''' or just '''model fuel'''.  Note that the '''nitro''' name is generally inaccurate, as [[nitromethane]] is usually not the primary ingredient, and in fact many glow fuels, especially the so-called "FAI" type, named for the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]], which requires such fuel in some forms of aeromodeling competition, contain no nitromethane at all.

==Ingredients==
Glow fuel is a mixture of [[methanol]], [[nitromethane]], and [[oil]].

Methanol is the primary ingredient as it provides the bulk of the fuel, and is needed as a solvent for the other ingredients. The presence of methanol vapor causes the [[Model_engine#Glowplug_engines|glow plug]] found in model engines to heat via a catalytic reaction with the platinum wire and glow.

Nitromethane is added to the methanol to increase power and to make the engine easier to tune.  Typically glow fuel is about 0-30% nitromethane. While higher concentrations can result in better engine performance, use of highly concentrated nitromethane is rare because of its cost. Although a given amount of nitromethane contains less energy than the same amount of methanol, it increases the amount of available oxygen in the combustion chamber, which allows the engine to draw in less air and more fuel. The increased amount of fuel increases power output and also helps cool the engine. For racing use, the nitromethane content can be increased to the range of 30%-65%.

Nitromethane is often difficult to obtain in many countries, so in these countries glow fuel typically has no nitromethane at all, which is generally not detrimental to engine longevity.

==Lubrication==
Most model engines require oil to be included with the fuel as a lubricant since the engine has no independent oiling capability.  Model engine fuel is typically 8-22% oil, with the higher percentages run in older design two-stroke glow engines that use bushings for the crankshaft bearings. The most commonly used lubricants are [[castor oil]] and synthetic oils, and many glow fuels include a mixture of the two.  The oils included in glow fuel generally are not burned by the engine, and are expelled out the [[exhaust system|exhaust]] of the engine.  This also helps the engine dissipate heat, as the oil emitted is generally hot.

[[Four stroke]] model engines, since they are generally designed to be simple powerplants while still incorporating the usual camshaft, rocker arms and poppet valves of larger sized four stroke engines, are generally meant to use glow ignition and their fuel.  Often, the oil percentage for four stroke glow fuel can be lowered from the 18–20% figure used for some two-stroke engines, down to as low as a 12–15%, but use of such low-lubricant fuel can also mandate the need for a small amount of castor oil in the mix, and mandates setting the high-speed fuel mixture carefully by using a handheld digital [[tachometer]] to check engine speed to avoid over-leaning of the fuel mixture.

Glow engines generally have to be run slightly rich with a higher fuel/air ratio than is ideal in order to keep the engine cool. The uncombusted fuel in the exhaust carries heat, providing the cooling effect. Because of this, vehicles with glow engines generally get coated with lots of oil. Almost all the oil mixed with the fuel is unconsummed and comes out the exhaust, as well as some of the nitromethane and methanol as well. This requires some cleaning.

The nitromethane in many glow fuel blends can cause corrosion of metal parts in model engines, especially four-stroke designs, due to the [[nitric acid]] residue formed from combustion of nitromethane-containing fuel, making the use of a so-called "after-run oil" a common practice after a model flying session with a four-stroke glow-engine-powered model.   

Glow fuel is not difficult to make, and so many modelers mix their own to save money, but some of the ingredients are flammable or explosive and so can be dangerous, especially in large quantities.  Most modelers buy their glow fuel premixed.

==Alternatives==
Nitromethane is sometimes replaced or supplemented by [[nitroethane]]. [[Propylene oxide]] is sometimes added in small percentages.
Another form of model fuel, for small compression ignition engines, is called "Diesel Fuel", which generally consists of [[kerosene]], [[ether]], oil and some sort of ignition improver, usually [[amyl nitrate]] or [[isopropyl nitrate]], it is in no way related to the automotive fuel of the same name.

These two climate states last for  millions of years and should not be confused with [[glacial period|glacial]] and [[interglacial]] periods, which occur only during an icehouse period and tend to last less than 1 million years. There are [[Timeline of glaciation|five known great glaciation]]s in Earth's climate history; the main factors involved in changes of the [[paleoclimate]] are believed to be the concentration of atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]], changes in the [[Earth's orbit]], and oceanic and [[orogenic]] changes due to [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plate dynamics]]. Greenhouse and icehouse periods have profoundly shaped the [[evolution]] of life on Earth.

==Greenhouse Earth==
===Overview of greenhouse Earth===
A "greenhouse Earth" or "hothouse Earth" is a period in which there are no continental [[glacier]]s whatsoever on the planet, the levels of carbon dioxide and other [[greenhouse gas]]es (such as [[water vapor]] and [[methane]]) are high, and [[sea surface temperature]]s (SSTs) range from 28&amp;nbsp;°C (82.4&amp;nbsp;°F) in the [[tropics]] to 0&amp;nbsp;°C (32&amp;nbsp;°F) in the [[polar region]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Price|first=Gregory|author2=Paul J.

===Causes of greenhouse Earth===
There are several theories as to how a greenhouse Earth can come about.  The geological record shows CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other greenhouse gases are abundant during this time. [[Tectonic movement]]s were extremely active during the more well-known greenhouse ages (such as 368 million years ago in the [[Paleozoic]] Era). Because of [[Divergent boundary|continental rifting]] ([[continental plate]]s moving away from each other) [[volcanic]] activity becomes more prominent, producing more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and heating up the Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norris|first=Richard D.|author2=Karen L.

==Icehouse Earth==
{{Life timeline}}
{{see also|Ice age|Timeline of glaciation}}

===Overview of icehouse Earth===
An "icehouse Earth" is the earth as it experiences an [[ice age]]. Unlike a greenhouse Earth, an icehouse Earth has [[ice sheet]]s present, and these sheets wax and wane throughout times known as [[glacial periods]] and [[interglacial|interglacial period]]s. During an icehouse Earth, greenhouse gases tend to be less abundant, and temperatures tend to be cooler globally. The Earth is currently in an icehouse stage,&lt;ref name="Montanez-p24-27"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Montanez|first=Isabel|author2=G.S. Soreghan|title=Earth's Fickle Climate: Lessons Learned from Deep-Time Ice Ages|journal=Geotimes|date=March 2006|volume=51|pages=24–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; as ice sheets are present on both [[Geographical pole|pole]]s and glacial periods have occurred at regular intervals over the past million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Monnin |first1=E. |last2=Indermühle |first2=A. |last3=Dällenbach |first3=A. |last4=Flückiger |first4=J. |last5=Stauffer |first5=B. |last6=Stocker |first6=T.

===Causes of icehouse Earth===
The causes of an icehouse state are much debated, because not much is really known about the transition periods between greenhouse to icehouse climates and what could make the climate so different. One important aspect is clearly the decline of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere, possibly due to low volcanic activity.

Other important issues are the movement of the tectonic plates and the opening and closing of oceanic gateways.&lt;ref name="Smith-p337-340"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Alan G.|author2=Kevin T. Pickering|title=Oceanic gateways as a critical factor to initiate icehouse Earth|journal=Journal of the Geological Society|year=2003|volume=160|pages=337–340|doi=10.1144/0016-764902-115}}&lt;/ref&gt; These seem to play a crucial part in icehouse Earths because they can bring forth cool waters from very deep water circulations that could assist in creating ice sheets or thermal isolation of areas. Examples of this occurring are the opening of the [[Oligocene#The opening of the Tasman Gateway|Tasmanian gateway]] 36.5 million years ago that separated [[Australia]] and [[Antarctica]] and which is believed to have set off the [[Cenozoic]] icehouse,&lt;ref name="Exon-p11-17"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Exon|first=N.|author2=J.

The revealed fresh [[soil]]s act as [[scrubber]]s of carbon dioxide, which can significantly affect the amount of this greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. An example of this is the collision between the [[Indian subcontinent]] and the [[Asia]]n continent, which created the [[Himalayas|Himalayan Mountains]] about 50 million years ago.

=== Glacials and interglacials ===
{{main|Glacial period|Interglacial}}
Within icehouse states, there are "[[glacial period|glacial]]" and "[[interglacial]]" periods that cause ice sheets to build up or retreat. The causes for these glacial and interglacial periods are mainly variations in the movement of the earth around the [[Sun]].&lt;ref name="Broecker-p49-56"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Broecker|first=Wallace S.|author2=George H. Denton|title=What Drives Glacial Cycles|journal=Scientific American|date=January 1990|pages=49–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The astronomical components, discovered by the Serbian geophysicist [[Milutin Milanković]] and now known as [[Milankovitch cycles]], include the [[axial tilt]] of the Earth, the [[orbital eccentricity]] (or shape of the [[orbit]]) and the [[precession]] (or wobble) of the [[Earth's rotation|Earth's spin]]. The tilt of the axis tends to fluctuate between 21.5° to 24.5° and back every 41,000 years on the vertical axis. This change actually affects the [[seasonality]] upon the earth, since more or less [[Insolation|solar radiation]] hits certain areas of the planet more often on a higher tilt, while less of a tilt would create a more even set of seasons worldwide. These changes can be seen in ice cores, which also contains information that shows that during glacial times (at the maximum extension of the ice sheets), the atmosphere had lower levels of carbon dioxide. This may be caused by the increase or redistribution of the [[acid]]/[[Base (chemistry)|base]] balance with [[bicarbonate]] and [[carbonate]] [[ion]]s that deals with [[alkalinity]]. During an Icehouse, only 20% of the time is spent in interglacial, or warmer times.&lt;ref name="Broecker-p49-56" /&gt;

=== Snowball earth ===
{{main|Snowball Earth}}
A "[[snowball earth]]" is the complete opposite of greenhouse Earth, in which the earth's surface is completely frozen over; however, a snowball earth technically does not have continental ice sheets like during the icehouse state. "The Great Infra-[[Cambrian]] Ice Age" has been claimed to be the host of such a world, and in 1964, the scientist [[W. Brian Harland]] brought forth his discovery of indications of glaciers in [[low latitudes]] (Harland and Rudwick). This became a problem for Harland because of the thought of the "Runaway Snowball Paradox" (a kind of [[Snowball effect]]) that, once the earth enters the route of becoming a snowball earth, it would never be able to leave that state. However, in 1992 {{ill|Joseph Kirschvink|display=1|de}} brought up a solution to the paradox. It is believed that since the continents at this time were huddled at the low and mid-latitudes that there was a great cooling event by planetary [[albedo]], or reflection of the earth’s surface. Kirschvink explained that the way to get out of the snowball could be connected to carbon dioxide, since volcanic activity would not halt, and that the buildup and lack of "[[scrubber|scrubbing]]" of this carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, that the earth would return to a greenhouse state. Some scientists believe that the end of the snowball Earth caused an event known as the [[Cambrian Explosion]], which produced the beginnings of [[multi-cellular]] life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maruyama|first=S.|author2=M. Santosh|title=Models on Snowball Earth and Cambrian explosion: A synopsis|journal=Gondwana Research|year=2008|volume=14|pages=22–32|doi=10.1016/j.gr.2008.01.004|bibcode=2008GondR..14...22M}}&lt;/ref&gt; However some biologists claim that a complete snowball Earth could not have happened since [[photosynthetic]] life would not have survived underneath many meters of ice without [[sunlight]]. However, it has been observed that, even under meters of thick ice around Antarctica, sunlight shows through. Most scientists{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} today believe that a "hard" Snowball Earth, one completely covered by ice, is probably impossible. However, a "slushball earth", with points of openings near the [[equator]], is possible.

Recent studies may have again complicated the idea of a snowball earth. In October 2011, a team of French researchers announced that the carbon dioxide during the last speculated "snowball earth" may have been lower than originally stated, which provides a challenge in finding out how Earth was able to get out of its state and if it were a snowball or slushball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=CNRS|first=Delegation Paris Michel-Ange|title=Snowball Earth's hypothesis challenged|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/000102083450.htm|work=ScienceDaily|accessdate=24 November 2011}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transitions==

===Causes===
The [[Eocene]], which occurred between 53 and 49 million years ago, was the Earth's warmest temperature period for 100 million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Herath|first=Anuradha K.|title=From Greenhouse to icehouse|url=http://www.astrobio.net./exclusive/3320/from-greenhouse-to-icehouse|work=Astrobio|accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this "super-greenhouse" eventually became an icehouse by the late Eocene. It was believed that the decline of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; caused this change, though there are possible [[positive feedback]]s, or added influence that contributes to the cooling.

The best record we have for a transition from an icehouse to a greenhouse period where plant life exists is during the [[Permian]] [[Age (geology)|epoch]] that occurred around 300 million years ago. In 40 million years a major transition took place, causing the Earth to change from a moist, icy planet where [[rainforest]]s covered the tropics, into a hot, dry, and windy location where little could survive. Professor [[Isabel P. Montañez]] of [[University of California, Davis]], who has researched this time period, found the climate to be "highly unstable" and "marked by dips and rises in carbon dioxide".&lt;ref name="UCDavis"&gt;{{cite web|last=University of California-Davis|title=A Bumpy Shift from Ice House to Greenhouse|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/01/070104144854.htm|work=ScienceDaily|accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impacts===
The Eocene-Oligocene transition, the latest transition occurring approximately 34 million years ago, resulted in rapid global temperature decrease, the glaciation of Antarctica and a series of biotic extinction events. The most dramatic species turnover event associated with this time period is the [[Grande Coupure]], a period which saw the replacement of European tree-dwelling and leaf-eating mammal species by migratory species from Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prothero|first=D. R.|date=1994-01-01|title=The Late Eocene-Oligocene Extinctions|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.ea.22.050194.001045|journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences|volume=22|issue=1|pages=145–165|doi=10.1146/annurev.ea.22.050194.001045|bibcode=1994AREPS..22..145P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
The science of [[paleoclimatology]] attempts to understand the history of greenhouse and icehouse conditions over geological time. Through the study of [[ice core]]s, [[dendrochronology]], [[ocean]] and [[lake]] [[sediment]]s ([[varve]]), [[palynology]] ([[fossil]]ized [[pollen]]) and [[isotope]] analysis (such as [[Radiometric dating]] and stable isotope analysis), scientists can create models of past climate. One study has shown that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels during the [[Permian]] age rocked back and forth between 250 [[parts per million]] (which is close to present-day levels) up to 2,000 parts per million.&lt;ref name="UCDavis" /&gt; Studies on lake sediments suggest that the "Hothouse" or "super-Greenhouse" [[Eocene]] was in a "permanent [[El Nino]] state" after the 10&amp;nbsp;°C warming of the deep ocean and high latitude surface temperatures shut down the [[Pacific Ocean]]'s El Nino-[[Southern Oscillation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huber|first=Matthew|author2=Rodrigo Caballero|title=Eocene El Nino: Evidence for Robust Tropical Dynamics in the "Hothouse"|journal=Science|date=7 February 2003|volume=299|pages=877–881|bibcode = 2003Sci...299..877H |doi = 10.1126/science.1078766|pmid=12574626}}&lt;/ref&gt; A theory was suggested for the [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum]] on the sudden decrease of carbon isotopic composition of global inorganic carbon pool by 2.5 parts per million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Higgins|first=John A.|author2=Daniel P. Schrag|title=Beyond Methane: Towards a theory for the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|year=2006|volume=245|pages=523–537|bibcode = 2006E&amp;PSL.245..523H |doi = 10.1016/j.epsl.2006.03.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A hypothesis noted for this negative drop of isotopes could be the increase of [[methane hydrate]]s, the trigger for which remains a mystery. This increase of [[Atmospheric methane|methane in the atmosphere]], which happens to be a potent, but short-lived greenhouse gas, increased the global temperatures by 6&amp;nbsp;°C with the assistance of the less potent carbon dioxide.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==List of Icehouse and Greenhouse Periods==

* A greenhouse period ran from 4.6 to 2.4 billion years ago.
* [[Huronian|Huronian Glaciation]] - an icehouse period that ran from 2.4 billion years ago to 2.1 billion years ago
* A greenhouse period ran from 2.1 billion to 720 million years ago.
* [[Cryogenian]] - an icehouse period that ran from 720 to 635 million years ago, at times the entire Earth was frozen over
* A greenhouse period ran from 635 million years ago to 450 million years ago.
* [[Andean-Saharan glaciation]] - an icehouse period that ran from 450 to 420 million years ago
* A greenhouse period ran from 420 million years ago to 360 million years ago.
* [[Karoo Ice Age|Late Paleozoic Ice Age]] - an icehouse period that ran from 360 to 260 million years ago
* A greenhouse period ran from 260 million years ago to 33.9 million years ago
* [[Late Cenozoic Ice Age]] - the current icehouse period which began 33.9 million years ago

==Modern conditions==
Currently, the Earth is in an icehouse climate state. About 34 million years ago, ice sheets began to form in [[Antarctica]]; the ice sheets in the [[Arctic]] did not start forming until 2 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Montanez-p24-27" /&gt; Some processes that may have led to our current icehouse may be connected to the development of the Himalayan Mountains and the opening of the [[Drake Passage]] between [[South America]] and Antarctica.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Scientists have been attempting to compare the past transitions between icehouse and greenhouse, and vice versa to understand where our planet is now heading.

Without the human influence on the greenhouse gas concentration, the Earth would be heading toward a [[ice age|glacial]] period. Predicted changes in [[orbital forcing]] suggest that in absence of human-made [[global warming]] the next glacial period would begin at least 50,000 years from now&lt;ref name=BergerLoutre&gt;{{cite journal |author=Berger A, Loutre MF |title=Climate. An exceptionally long interglacial ahead? |journal=Science |volume=297 |issue=5585 |pages=1287–8 |date=August 2002 |pmid=12193773 |doi=10.1126/science.1076120 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/297/5585/1287 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Milankovitch cycles]]).

But due to the ongoing anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, the Earth is instead heading toward a greenhouse Earth period.&lt;ref name="Montanez-p24-27" /&gt; Permanent ice is actually a rare phenomenon in the history of the Earth, occurring only in coincidence with the icehouse effect, which has affected about 20% of Earth's history.

:The [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme (PVPS) is one of the collaborative R&amp;D agreements established within the IEA and, since its establishment in 1993, the PVPS participants have been conducting a variety of joint projects in the application of photovoltaic conversion of solar energy into electricity. Its annual "Snapshot" report is released in early April and provides the first and detailed figures of worldwide PV-deployment of the previous year. An overview of all international statistics PDF reports since 1995 can be found on IEA-PVPS' [http://www.iea-pvps.org/index.php?id=92 Statistic Reports] website.

;Worldwide

In 2013, worldwide deployment of solar PV amounted to almost 40&amp;nbsp;GW (39,953&amp;nbsp;MW)—an increase of about 35 percent over the previous year. Cumulated capacity increased by 38 percent to more than 139&amp;nbsp;GW. This is sufficient to generate at least 160 [[terawatt-hour]]s (TWh) or 0.85 percent of the world's total [[electricity consumption]] of 18,400 TWh.&lt;ref name="iea-pvps-snapshot-1992-2013" /&gt;{{rp|5,13}}&lt;ref name="iea-pvps-trends-2014" /&gt;{{rp|9}}

&lt;div style="font-size: 0.9em; margin: 0 12px 12px 6px;"&gt;An uncertainty in Chinese deployment was the reason for a significant discrepancy between EPIA's ''outlook'' and IEA's ''Trends'' reports. EPIA did not take 1.1&amp;nbsp;GW of additional Chinese deployment into account, since at the time it was unsure whether these installations were connected to the grid.&lt;ref name="epia-2014" /&gt;{{rp|5}} In IEA's final ''Trends'' report, the confirmed figures not only raised domestic Chinese deployment from 11.8&amp;nbsp;GW to 12.92&amp;nbsp;GW, but also contributed to increase global figures to almost 40&amp;nbsp;GW.&lt;/div&gt;

; Regions

In 2013, Asia has been the fastest growing region, with China and Japan accounting for 49% of worldwide deployment. About a quarter has been installed in Europe (10,975&amp;nbsp;MW). The remaining quarter of the 38,400&amp;nbsp;MW deployed in 2013 is split between North America and other countries.

Europe is still the most developed region with a cumulative capacity of 81.5&amp;nbsp;GW, about 59 percent of the global total, followed by the [[Asia-Pacific]] region (APAC), including countries such as Japan, India and Australia with 22&amp;nbsp;GW or about 16 percent of worldwide cumulative capacity (due to its significance, China is excluded from the APAC region in all PV statistics and listed separately). European solar PV now covers 3 percent of the electricity demand and 6 percent of the peak electricity demand. However, deployment in Europe has slowed down by half compared to the record year of 2011, and will most likely continue to decrease. This is mainly due to the strong decline of new installations in Germany and Italy.&lt;ref name="epia-2014" /&gt;{{rp|18}}

Cumulative capacity in the MEA (Middle East and Africa) region and ROW (rest of the world) accounted for less than 3&amp;nbsp;GW or about 2.2% of the global total. A great untapped potential remains for many of these countries, especially in the Sunbelt.&lt;ref name="epia-2014" /&gt;{{rp|19,23}}

In 2013, the world's top installer were [[Solar power in China|China]] (+12.92&amp;nbsp;GW), followed by [[Solar power in Japan|Japan]] (+6.97&amp;nbsp;GW) and the [[Solar power in the United States|United States]] (+4.75&amp;nbsp;GW), while Germany remained the world's largest overall producer of power from solar PV, with a total capacity around 36&amp;nbsp;GW and contributing 5.7% to its net electricity consumption. Italy met more than 7% of its electricity demands with solar PV, thus leading the world in that respect.

In 2013, Europe added 11 gigawatts of new PV installation (including non-EU countries). It is still the most developed region with a cumulated total of 81.5 GW, about 59 percent of the worldwide installed capacity. Solar PV now covers 3 percent of the electricity demand and 6 percent of the peak electricity demand. However, European PV deployment has slowed down by half compared to the record year of 2011, and will most likely continue to decrease. This is mainly due to the strong decline of new installations in Germany and Italy.

Off grid refers to photovoltaics which are not grid connected. On grid means connected to the local electricity grid. Δ means the amount installed during the previous year. Σ means the total amount installed. Wp/capita refers to the ratio of total installed capacity divided by total population, or total installed Wp per person. Module price is average installed price, in Euros. kW·h/kWp·yr indicates the range of insolation to be expected. While National Report(s) may be cited as source(s) within an International Report, any contradictions in data are resolved by using only the most recent report's data. Exchange rates represent the 2006 annual average of daily rates (OECD Main Economic Indicators June 2007).&lt;br&gt;Module Price: Lowest:2.5 EUR/Wp (2.83 USD/Wp&lt;ref name="Exchange Rates"/&gt;) in Germany 2003. Uncited insolation data is from maps dating 1991–1995.&lt;ref name="PV Power 2007-June"&gt;iea-pvps.org [http://www.iea-pvps.org/pvpower/download/pvpower26.pdf PV Power (2007-June)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baro178-PDF"/&gt;

The superconductor is [[bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide]] (BSCCO) which superconducts at liquid nitrogen temperatures. Other parts of the system include a {{convert|13000|gal|liter}} liquid nitrogen storage tank, a [[Brayton cycle|Brayton]] Helium [[Refrigeration|refrigerator]], and a number of [[cryostat]]s which manage the transition between cryogenic and ambient temperatures.&lt;ref name="schmidt"/&gt;

The project was funded by the [[United States Department of Energy]], and operates as part of the [[Long Island Power Authority]] power grid.&lt;ref name="schmidt"/&gt;

[[Image:US006758018-004.gif|thumb|The nail, as shown in the patent document.]]
The '''HurriQuake''' nail is a construction [[nail (fastener)|nail]] designed by Ed Sutt for [[Bostitch]], a division of [[Stanley Works]], and patented in 2004. The features of the nail are designed primarily to provide more structural integrity for a building, especially against the forces of [[hurricane]]s and [[earthquake]]s.

==Features ==
[[Image:US006758018-005.gif|thumb|Detail of the barbed rings on the shank.]]
Starting at the bottom of the nail, the ring shanks on the lower half of the nail are enhanced with angular barbs, which add maximum resistance to the nail being pulled out. The middle of the nail has no extra features, which leaves the section most likely to be damaged during an earthquake thicker and least prone to damage. The area directly below the head of the nail features a spiral-style shank used to enhance the nail's strength in holding boards together. This enhancement keeps boards that are nailed together from moving around under nature's forces and overall weakening the joints. The final feature of this nail is the nail head, which is 25% larger than the average, allowing it to be more resistant to being pulled completely through attached pieces of wood.&lt;ref name= "pop-sci-nov06-41"&gt;{{Citation | surname=Unknown| given=Unknown | title=Best of What's New 2006 — Home Tech  | url=http://www.popsci.com/popsci/flat/bown/2006/product_75.html | journal=Popular Science |volume=269 |issue=6 | year=2006 | page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==

===Pre-development===
The nail's design began when its inventor, [[civil engineering|civil engineer]] Ed Sutt, traveled to the [[Caribbean]] in the wake of [[Hurricane Marilyn]]. Sutt's trip to the Caribbean was part of a team examining the wreckage of the 80% of the island's homes and business that had been destroyed in the hurricane's winds of 95&amp;nbsp;mph (155&amp;nbsp;km/h). The finding among the homes that had been destroyed was that wood failure was not the cause of destruction; instead, the findings showed that the nails holding the wood together had failed, leading to the buildings' ultimate collapse.&lt;ref name= "pop-sci-nov06-106"&gt;{{Citation | surname=Clynes| given=Tom | title= Dr. Nail vs. the Monster  | url= http://www.popsci.com/popsci/flat/bown/2006/innovator_5.html | journal= Popular Science |volume=269 |issue=6 | year=2006 | page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sutt's research began after taking a research assistantship program at the [[Clemson Wind Load Test Facility]], which had received funding through a grant from [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]]. The grant was used to research wooden-framed structures and the relationship of their failure to wind velocity.&lt;ref name= "pop-sci-nov06-107"&gt;{{Citation | surname=Clynes| given=Tom | title=Dr. Nail vs. the Monster | journal=Popular Science |volume=269 |issue=6 | year=2006 | page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome of the project's research showed that the best way to strengthen a structure was to improve the fasteners that held the [[roof]]ing and wall sheathing to the internal frame, and with this information Sutt signed on as a fastener engineer for the Stanley subsidiary, [[Bostitch]].&lt;ref name= "pop-sci-nov06-107 – 8"&gt;{{Citation | surname=Clynes| given=Tom | title= Dr. Nail vs. the Monster | journal=Popular Science |volume=269 |issue=6 | year=2006 | pages=107–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
As development began on the nail, there were three major causes of failure to be overcome. These were having the nail — head and all — rip through the sheathing, having the entire nail pull out of the frame, and having the nail's midsection snap under stress. Early research showed that the larger the head, the less chance there was of the nail being ripped through the sheathing. However, the difficult task was increasing the nail's head while still making it compatible with popular [[nail gun]] models. After finding the ideal nail head size, the next task to conquer was preventing the entire nail from pulling out of the frame. This was overcome by adding barbed ring shanks around the lower portion of the nail. During the testing of the shanks, it was noted that above a certain point the shanks no longer strengthened the nail but instead weakened the nail by making it more susceptible to shearing. The final touch to the original prototype was a special high-carbon alloy designed by a [[metallurgy|metallurgist]] that had the perfect combination of stiffness and pliability, giving it the highest possible strength.&lt;ref name="pop-sci-nov06-108"&gt;{{Citation | surname=Clynes| given=Tom | title =Dr. Nail vs. the Monster | journal=Popular Science |volume=269 |issue=6 | year=2006 | page= 108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sheather plus and beyond===
After analyzing hundreds of designs, and finally coming up with what was believed to be the best design, Bostich finally released the nail in 2005 and labeled it the Sheather Plus.&lt;ref name= "pop-sci-nov06-108 – 9"&gt;{{Citation | surname=Clynes| given=Tom | title= Dr. Nail vs. the Monster | journal=Popular Science |volume=269 |issue=6 | year=2006 | pages=108–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the new nail was stronger than most nails, the barbs, which added the much needed strength to the nail's holding power, weakened the strength of the joint by opening the hole too far. This caused the joint to be sloppy and wobbly, so the team went back to the drawing board where the final feature was added to the nail. To compensate for the extra width of the nail hole, due to the ring shanks, Sutt decided to add a thicker screw-shank to the portion of the nail directly under the head. This addition thickened the top portion of the nail giving it a tighter joint, as well as enhancing its overall holding power.&lt;ref name="pop-sci-nov06-109"&gt;{{Citation | surname=Clynes| given=Tom | title=Dr. Nail vs. the Monster | journal=Popular Science |volume=269 |issue=6 | year=2006 | page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Testing==
Independent tests of the nail's stretch were conducted by several organizations, including [[Florida International University]] and the [[International Code Council]]. Those tests confirmed what the researchers at Bostitch had claimed, that they had created a better nail. Among all of the different tests, it was found that the new nail had twice the "uplift capacity" of other power driven nails, as well as increasing a home's resistance to wind and increasing earthquake resistance by up to 50%. For further testing, Sutt asked for the assistance of Scott Schiff, the coordinator of the graduate program in civil engineering and engineering mechanics at [[Clemson University]]. Tests at the Clemson Wind Load Test Facility confirmed what had already been stated.&lt;ref name="pop-sci-nov06-109"/&gt; With equipment to simulate the force of winds, roofs attached with traditional nails were pulled apart at around 13,500 pounds of force (60.1 [[Newton (unit)|kN]]). At forces up to 16,000 pounds (71&amp;nbsp;kN), walls built with the HurriQuake environment nail showed minimal wall movement. As the pressure increased to 17,000 pounds (75&amp;nbsp;kN), then 18,000 (80&amp;nbsp;kN), then 19,000 (85&amp;nbsp;kN), the walls began to make creaking and groaning noises but they still stayed attached. As the test rig pushed 20,000 pounds (89&amp;nbsp;kN), the maximum it was capable of testing, it gave out, showing that the HurriQuake environment nail sustained 20,000 pounds of force (89&amp;nbsp;kN) and still was not sheared or completely pulled out.&lt;ref name= "pop-sci-nov06-134"&gt;{{Citation | surname=Clynes| given=Tom | title= Dr. Nail vs. the Monster | journal=Popular Science |volume=269 |issue=6 | year=2006 | page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
The Hurriquake won the ''[[Popular Science]]'' Best of What's New 2006 award for Home Technology and was honored as the grand award winner for Best Innovation of the Year.&lt;ref name= "pop-sci-nov06-41" /&gt;

'''''In Old Oklahoma''''' (reissued as '''''War of the Wildcats''''') is a 1943 American [[Western (genre)|Western]] film directed by [[Albert S. Rogell]] starring [[John Wayne]] and [[Martha Scott]]. The film was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]], one for Music Score of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture and the other for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Sound Recording]] ([[Daniel J. Bloomberg]]).&lt;ref name="Oscars1944"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1944 |title=The 16th Academy Awards (1944) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=2011-08-14|work=oscars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Eastern school teacher Catherine Allen becomes notorious in 1906 when it is learned that she has authored a romance novel. She decides to move West and begin a new life.

On the train, oil man Jim Gardner makes a pass at her. Catherine asks a cowboy, Dan Somers, to sit nearby as a safety measure. Both are on their way to Oklahoma, with stagecoach driver Despirit Dean tagging along with his friend Dan.

Many people in Sapulpa are upset with Jim's business tactics. A farmer feels he was paid too little for his property after Jim discovers oil there. Jim is furious when Dan strongly discourages Chief Big Tree from selling Indian land at too low an offer.

Dan travels to Washington, D.C., to ask President Theodore Roosevelt about oil rights. He fought for Teddy and the Rough Riders a few years before. Teddy offers him a chance to transport thousands of barrels of oil to a Tulsa refinery to win the rights over Jim, which leads to Jim's hired man, the Cherokee Kid, setting off an explosion and sabotaging the trip.

Catherine and Dan fall in love, with hotel owner Bessie Baxter playing matchmaker. A final fistfight between Dan and Jim settles matters once and for all.

The film still took a number of months to move into production.  Eleanor Griffin and Ethel Hill were hired to work on the script "which puts the feature in the big league class" according to the ''Los Angeles Times''. They were "to give the story the epic flavor."&lt;ref&gt;DRAMA AND FILM: Epical Regeneration Planned for Oil Story Lesser to Glorify Three More Canteens; Gabin Named for 'Passage to Marseille' Schallert, Edwin.

The movie was retitled ''In Old Oklahoma'' and filming was to start 15 June.  [[Martha Scott]] was signed for the female lead, which was seen as a coup for Republic because she was associated with prestigious films such as ''[[Our Town (1940 film)|Our Town]]'' (1940).&lt;ref&gt;DRAMA AND FILM: Martha Scott Likely Oil Pioneer Heroine 'Tomorrow the World' Quoted High; Two Comedians Will Vie as Rookies

The '''Jännersdorf Solar Park''' is a [[photovoltaic power station]] in [[Prignitz]], [[Germany]]. It has a capacity of 40.5 [[megawatts]] (MW) and an annual output of 38&amp;nbsp;[[GWh]]. The solar park was developed and built by Parabel AG.

The project is built on a former military training area on {{convert|90|ha}}. The project is equipped with 167,550 [[photovoltaic modules]], with 25.6&amp;nbsp;MW from [[Trina Solar]], 9.6&amp;nbsp;MW from [[Suntech Power]] and 5.3&amp;nbsp;MW from Hareon. The solar park was connected to the grid on 30 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pvresources.com/PVPowerPlants/Top50.aspx Large-Scale Photovoltaic Power Plants] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101000000/http://www.pvresources.com/PVPowerPlants/Top50.aspx |date=January 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.parabel-solar.com/press-/786| title=Parabel AG puts 40.5 MW Jännersdorf Solar Park in operation| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730151109/http://www.parabel-solar.com/press-/786| archive-date=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pv-tech.org/news/brandenburgs_40.5mw_jaennersdorf_solar_park_officially_opens Brandenburg’s 40.5MW Jännersdorf solar park officially opens]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.solarserver.com/solar-magazine/solar-news/current/2012/kw27/parabel-ag-completes-405-mw-jaennersdorf-solar-park-before-fit-cut-deadline.html| title=Parabel AG completes 40.5 MW Jännersdorf Solar Park before FIT cut deadline| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222080842/http://www.solarserver.com/solar-magazine/solar-news/current/2012/kw27/parabel-ag-completes-405-mw-jaennersdorf-solar-park-before-fit-cut-deadline.html| archive-date=2013-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
First references in historical documents are dated by 1581 in relation to [[Mścisław Voivodship]] of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. It was granted city status in 1777, and  a [[Coat of Arms]] in 1781.
According to the census of 1897, the city had 4,714 inhabitants. 50.2 percent were Orthodox, 47.9 percent Jews and 1.5 percent Catholics.

It was occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]] on August 10, 1941 and liberated in October 1943.

In January 1939, there were 1,693 Jews in the village. There was a Yiddish school until 1938. The majority of the Jews were merchants. 
There were 4 executions of Jews in Klimovichi. At the end of August 1941, 13 Jews were arrested, taken to the Jewish cemetery in order to dig a pit. They were shot there afterwards. The second execution took place on November 6, 1941. Some Jews were sent to work and the remaining Jews were gathered in a garage near the hospital. Germans took their valuables. The Jews were then displaced near the airport, not far from the village of Dolgaya Gora and were shot by Germans and local policemen. On the same day, the Jews who were sent to work were shot at the same location. According to some sources, between 750 and 900 Jews were killed on that day. After this massacre, 80 Jews remained alive. They were concentrated in one house. At the end of November 1941, these Jews were forced to walk to Melovaya Gora and were shot. In April 1943, the children from mixed-families were imprisoned by the Germans and were shot on April 12, 1943.&lt;ref&gt;http://yahadmap.org/#village/klimovichi-klimavichi-mogilev-belarus.654&lt;/ref&gt;

The city and especially its [[raion]] heavily suffered during the [[Chernobyl disaster]].

The '''Kutta–Joukowski theorem''' is a fundamental theorem in [[aerodynamics]] used for the calculation of lift of an airfoil and any two-dimensional bodies including circular cylinders translating in a uniform fluid at a constant speed large enough so that the flow seen in the body-fixed  frame is steady and unseparated. The theorem relates the [[lift (force)|lift]] generated by  an airfoil to the speed of the airfoil through the fluid, the density of the fluid and the [[circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]] around the airfoil. The circulation is defined as the line integral around a closed loop enclosing the airfoil of the component of the velocity of the fluid [[tangent]] to the loop.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J.D. Jr., ''Introduction to Flight,'' Section 5.19, McGraw-Hill, NY (3rd ed. 1989.)&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after [[Martin Kutta]] and [[Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky|Nikolai Zhukovsky]] (or Joukowski) who first developed its key ideas in the early 20th century. Kutta–Joukowski theorem is an [[Inviscid flow|inviscid theory]], but it is a good approximation for real viscous flow in typical aerodynamic applications.    
 
Kutta–Joukowski theorem relates lift to circulation much like the [[Magnus effect]] relates side force (called Magnus force) to rotation.&lt;ref name="Glenn"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/cyl.html |title=Lift on rotating cylinders |publisher= NASA Glenn Research Center |date=2010-11-09 |accessdate=2013-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However,  the circulation here is not induced by rotation of the airfoil. The fluid flow in the presence of the airfoil can be considered to be the [[Superposition principle|superposition]] of a translational flow and a rotating flow. This rotating flow is induced by the effects of camber, angle of attack and a sharp trailing edge of the airfoil. It should not be confused with a vortex like a [[tornado]] encircling the airfoil. At a large distance from the airfoil, the rotating flow may be regarded as induced by a line vortex (with the rotating line perpendicular to the two-dimensional plane). In the derivation of the Kutta–Joukowski theorem the [[airfoil]] is usually mapped onto a circular cylinder. In many text books, the theorem is proved for a circular cylinder and the [[Joukowski airfoil]], but it holds true for general airfoils.

==Lift force formula==
The theorem applies to two-dimensional flow around a fixed airfoil (or any shape of infinite [[wing span|span]]).  The lift per unit span &lt;math&gt;L'\,&lt;/math&gt;of the airfoil is given by&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section 4.5&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;L^\prime = -\rho_\infty V_\infty\Gamma,\,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;\rho_\infty\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_\infty\,&lt;/math&gt; are the fluid density and the fluid velocity far upstream of the airfoil, and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\,&lt;/math&gt; is the circulation defined as the [[line integral]]

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma= \oint_{C} V \cdot d\mathbf{s}=\oint_{C} V\cos\theta\; ds\,&lt;/math&gt;

around a closed contour &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; enclosing the airfoil and followed in the positive (anti-clockwise) direction.  As explained below, this path must be in a region of [[potential flow]] and not in the [[boundary layer]] of the cylinder. The integrand &lt;math&gt;V\cos\theta\,&lt;/math&gt; is the component of the local fluid velocity in the direction tangent to the curve &lt;math&gt;C\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;ds\,&lt;/math&gt; is an infinitesimal length on the curve, &lt;math&gt;C\,&lt;/math&gt;.  Equation {{EquationNote|1|(1)}} is a form of the ''Kutta–Joukowski theorem.''

Kuethe and Schetzer state the Kutta–Joukowski theorem as follows:&lt;ref&gt;A.M. Kuethe and J.D. Schetzer, ''Foundations of Aerodynamics'', Section 4.9 (2nd ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;
:''The force per unit length acting on a right cylinder of any cross section whatsoever is equal to &lt;math&gt;-\rho_\infty V_\infty \Gamma&lt;/math&gt; and is perpendicular to the direction of &lt;math&gt;V_\infty.&lt;/math&gt;''

==Circulation and the Kutta condition==
{{main|Kutta condition}}
A lift-producing airfoil either has camber or operates at a positive angle of attack,  the angle between the chord line and the fluid flow far upstream of the airfoil. Moreover, the airfoil must have a "sharp" trailing edge.

Any real fluid is viscous, which implies that the fluid velocity vanishes on the airfoil. Prandtl showed that for large Reynolds number, defined as  &lt;math&gt;Re=\frac{\rho V_{\infty}c_A}{\mu}\,&lt;/math&gt;,  and small angle of attack, the flow around a thin airfoil is composed of a narrow viscous region called the [[boundary layer]] near the body and an [[inviscid flow]] region outside. In applying the Kutta-Joukowski theorem, the loop must be chosen outside this boundary layer. (For example, the circulation calculated using the loop corresponding to the surface of the airfoil would be zero for a viscous fluid.)

The sharp trailing edge requirement corresponds physically to a flow in which the fluid moving along the lower and upper surfaces of the airfoil meet smoothly, with no fluid moving around the trailing edge of the airfoil. This is known as the "Kutta condition."  

Kutta and Joukowski showed that for computing the pressure and lift of a thin airfoil for flow at large [[Reynolds number]] and small angle of attack, the flow can be assumed inviscid in the entire region outside the airfoil provided the Kutta condition is imposed. This is known as the [[potential flow]] theory and works remarkably well in practice.

==Derivation==
Two derivations are presented below. The first is a [[heuristic]] argument, based on physical insight.  The second is a formal and technical one, requiring basic [[vector analysis]] and [[complex analysis]].

===Heuristic argument===
For a heuristic argument, consider a thin airfoil of [[chord (aircraft)|chord]] &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and infinite span, moving through air of density &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;. Let the airfoil be inclined to the oncoming flow to produce an air speed &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; on one side of the airfoil, and an air speed &lt;math&gt;V + v&lt;/math&gt; on the other side. The circulation is then

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = Vc-(V+ v)c = -v c.\,&lt;/math&gt;

The difference in pressure &lt;math&gt;\Delta P&lt;/math&gt; between the two sides of the airfoil can be found by applying [[Bernoulli's equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\rho}{2}(V)^2 + (P + \Delta P) = \frac {\rho}{2}(V + v)^2 + P,\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\rho}{2}(V)^2 + \Delta P = \frac {\rho}{2}(V^2 + 2 V v + v^2),\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta P = \rho V v \qquad \text{(ignoring } \frac{\rho}{2}v^2),\,&lt;/math&gt;

so the lift force per unit span is

:&lt;math&gt;L' = c \Delta P = \rho V v c =-\rho V\Gamma.\,&lt;/math&gt;

A [[Differential (calculus)|differential]] version of this theorem applies on each element of the plate and is the basis of [[thin-airfoil theory]].

===Formal derivation===

!Formal derivation of Kutta–Joukowski theorem
|-
|First of all, the force exerted on each unit length of a cylinder of arbitrary cross section is calculated.&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor, G. K., ''An Introduction to Fluid Dynamics'', p 406&lt;/ref&gt; Let this force per unit length (from now on referred to simply as force) be &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}\,&lt;/math&gt;. So then the total force is:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}=-\oint_C p \mathbf{n}\, ds, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''C'' denotes the borderline of the cylinder, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the [[static pressure]] of the fluid, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[unit vector]] normal to the cylinder, and ''ds'' is the arc element of the borderline of the cross section. Now let &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; be the angle between the normal vector and the vertical. Then the components of the above force are:

: &lt;math&gt; F_x= -\oint_C p \sin\phi\, ds \quad, \qquad F_y= \oint_C p \cos\phi\, ds. &lt;/math&gt;

Now comes a crucial step: consider the used two-dimensional space as a [[complex plane]]. So every vector can be represented as a [[complex number]], with its first component equal to the real part and its second component equal to the imaginary part of the complex number. Then, the force can be represented as:

: &lt;math&gt;F=F_x+iF_y=-\oint_Cp(\sin\phi-i\cos\phi)\,ds .&lt;/math&gt;

The next step is to take the [[complex conjugate]] of the force &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and do some manipulation:

: &lt;math&gt;\bar{F}=-\oint_C p(\sin\phi+i\cos\phi)\,ds=-i\oint_C p(\cos\phi-i\sin\phi)\, ds=-i\oint_C p e^{-i\phi}\,ds.&lt;/math&gt;

Surface segments ''ds'' are related to changes ''dz'' along them by:

: &lt;math&gt; dz=dx+idy=ds(\cos\phi+i\sin\phi)=ds\,e^{i\phi} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad d\bar{z}=e^{-i\phi}ds.&lt;/math&gt;

Plugging this back into the integral, the result is:

: &lt;math&gt; \bar{F}=-i\oint_C p \, d\bar{z}.&lt;/math&gt;

Now the [[Bernoulli's principle|Bernoulli equation]] is used, in order to remove the pressure from the integral. Throughout the analysis it is assumed that there is no outer force field present. The mass density of the flow is &lt;math&gt;\rho.&lt;/math&gt; Then pressure &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is related to velocity &lt;math&gt; v=v_x+iv_y&lt;/math&gt; by:

: &lt;math&gt;p=p_0-\frac{\rho |v|^2}{2}. &lt;/math&gt;

With this the force &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; becomes:

: &lt;math&gt; \bar{F}=-ip_0\oint_C d\bar{z} +i \frac{\rho}{2} \oint_C |v|^2\, d\bar{z} = \frac{i\rho}{2}\oint_C |v|^2\,d\bar{z}.&lt;/math&gt;

Only one step is left to do: introduce &lt;math&gt;w=f(z),&lt;/math&gt; the [[complex potential]] of the flow. This is related to the velocity components as &lt;math&gt; w'=v_x-iv_y=\bar{v},&lt;/math&gt; where the apostrophe denotes differentiation with respect to the complex variable ''z''. The velocity is tangent to the borderline ''C'', so this means that &lt;math&gt; v=\pm |v| e^{i\phi}.&lt;/math&gt; Therefore, &lt;math&gt; v^2d\bar{z}=|v|^2dz, \,&lt;/math&gt; and the desired expression for the force is obtained:

: &lt;math&gt; \bar{F}=\frac{i\rho}{2}\oint_C w'^2\,dz,&lt;/math&gt;

which is called the [[Blasius theorem]].

To arrive at the Joukowski formula, this integral has to be evaluated. From complex analysis it is known that a [[holomorphic function]] can be presented as a [[Laurent series]]. From the physics of the problem it is deduced that the derivative of the complex potential &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; will look thus:

: &lt;math&gt; w'(z)=a_0+\frac{a_1}{z}+\frac{a_2}{z^2}+\dots .&lt;/math&gt;

The function does not contain higher order terms, since the velocity stays finite at infinity. So &lt;math&gt;a_0\,&lt;/math&gt; represents the derivative the complex potential at infinity: &lt;math&gt;a_0=v_{x\infty}-iv_{y\infty}\,&lt;/math&gt;. 
The next task is to find out the meaning of &lt;math&gt;a_1\,&lt;/math&gt;. Using the [[residue theorem]] on the above series:

: &lt;math&gt; a_1=\frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_C w'\, dz. &lt;/math&gt;

Now perform the above integration:

: &lt;math&gt; \oint_C w'(z)\,dz =\oint_C (v_x-iv_y)(dx+idy)= \oint_C (v_x\,dx+v_y\,dy)+i\oint_C(v_x\,dy-v_y\,dx)=\oint_C \mathbf{v}\,{ds} +i\oint_C(v_x\,dy-v_y\,dx).&lt;/math&gt;

The first integral is recognized as the [[circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]] denoted by &lt;math&gt;\Gamma.&lt;/math&gt; The second integral can be evalutated after some manipulation:

: &lt;math&gt;\oint_C(v_x\,dy-v_y\,dx)=\oint_C\left(\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y}dy+\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial x}dx\right)=\oint_C d\psi=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\psi\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[stream function]]. Since the ''C'' border of the cylinder is a streamline itself, the stream function does not change on it, and &lt;math&gt;d\psi=0 \,&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the above integral is zero. As a result:

:&lt;math&gt;a_1=\frac{\Gamma}{2\pi i}.&lt;/math&gt;

Take the square of the series:

: &lt;math&gt;w'^2(z)=a_0^2+\frac{a_0\Gamma}{\pi i z} +\dots.&lt;/math&gt;

Plugging this back into the Blasius–Chaplygin formula, and performing the integration using the residue theorem:

: &lt;math&gt; \bar{F}=\frac{i\rho}{2}\left[2\pi i \frac{a_0\Gamma}{\pi i}\right]=i\rho a_0 \Gamma = i\rho \Gamma(v_{x\infty}-iv_{y\infty})=\rho\Gamma v_{y\infty}+ i\rho\Gamma v_{x\infty}=F_x-iF_y.&lt;/math&gt;

And so the Kutta–Joukowski formula is:

: &lt;math&gt;F_x=\rho \Gamma v_{y\infty} \quad, \qquad F_y= -\rho \Gamma v_{x\infty}. &lt;/math&gt;

==Lift forces for more complex situations==
The lift predicted by the Kutta-Joukowski theorem within the framework of inviscid potential flow theory is quite accurate, even for real viscous flow, provided the flow is steady and unseparated.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson J. ''Fundamentals of Aerodynamics'', Mcgraw-Hill Series in Aeronautical and Aerospace Engineering, McGraw-Hill Education, New York 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''a) Kutta-Joukowski theorem for steady irrotational flow'''.  In deriving the Kutta–Joukowski theorem, the assumption of irrotational flow was used. When there are free vortices outside of the body, as may be the case for a large number of unsteady flows, the flow is rotational. When the flow is rotational, more complicated theories should be used to derive the lift forces. Below are several important examples.

'''b) Impulsively started flow at small angle of attack'''. For an  impulsively started flow such as obtained by suddenly accelerating an airfoil or setting an angle of attack, there is a vortex sheet continuously shed at the trailing edge and the lift force is unsteady or time-dependent. For small angle of attack starting flow, the vortex sheet follows a planar path, and the curve of the [[lift coefficient]] as function of time is given by the Wagner function.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner H  Uber die Entstehung des dynamischen Auftriebes von Tragflueln. Z. Angew. Math. Mech.1925, 5, 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case the initial lift is one half of the final lift given by the Kutta Joukowski formula.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Saffman PG ''Vortex Dynamics'', Cambridge University Press, New York, 1992 .&lt;/ref&gt; The lift attains 90% of its steady state value when the [[wing]] has traveled a distance of about seven chord lengths.
 
'''c) Impulsively started flow at large angle of attack'''. When the angle of attack is high enough, the trailing edge vortex sheet is initially in a spiral shape and the lift is singular (infinitely large) at the initial time.&lt;ref&gt;Graham JMR，The lift on an aerofoil in starting flow |publisher= Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 1983, vol 133, pp 413-425&lt;/ref&gt;  The lift drops for a very short time period before the usually assumed monotonically increasing lift curve is reached.

'''d) Starting flow at large angle of attack for wings with sharp leading edges'''.  If, as for a flat plate, the leading edge is also sharp, then vortices also shed at the leading edge and the role of leading edge vortices is two-fold：(1) they are lift increasing when they are still close to the leading edge, so that they elevate the Wagner lift curve,(2) they are detrimental to lift when they are convected to the trailing edge, inducing a new trailing edge vortex spiral moving in the lift decreasing direction. 
For this type of flow a vortex force line (VFL) map &lt;ref name=LW&gt;{{cite web|vauthors=Li J, Wu ZN|title= Unsteady lift for the Wagner problem in the presence of additional leading trailing edge vortices |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2015.118 |publisher=Journal of Fluid Mechanics,  2015, Vol 769,  pp 182 - 217.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  can be used to understand the effect of the different vortices in a variety of situations (including more situations than starting flow) and may be used to improve vortex control to enhance or reduce the lift. The vortex force line map is a two dimensional map on which vortex force lines are displayed. For a vortex at any point in the flow, its lift contribution is proportional to its speed, its circulation and  the cosine of the angle between the streamline and the vortex force line. Hence the vortex force line map clearly shows whether a given vortex is lift producing or lift detrimental.  
  
'''e) Lagally theorem'''. When a (mass) source is fixed outside the body, a force correction due to this source can be expressed as the product of the strength of outside source and the induced velocity at this source by all the causes except this source. This is known as the Lagally theorem.&lt;ref&gt;Milne-Thomson L M.  ''Theoretical Hydrodynamics'' [p226], Macmillan Education LTD, Hong Kong.1968&lt;/ref&gt;
For two-dimensional inviscid flow, the classical Kutta Joukowski theorem predicts a zero drag.  When, however, there is vortex outside the body, there is a vortex induced drag, in a form similar to the induced lift.

'''f) Generalized Lagally theorem'''.   For free vortices and other bodies outside one body without bound vorticity and without vortex production, a generalized Lagally theorem holds,&lt;ref&gt;Wu CT, Yang FL &amp; Young DL Generalized two-dimensional Lagally theorem with free vortices and its application to fluid-body interaction problems, Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 2012, vol 698, pp73--92.&lt;/ref&gt; with which the forces are expressed as the products of strength of inner singularities (image vortices, sources and doublets inside each body) and the induced velocity at these singularities by all causes except those inside this body. The contribution due to each inner singularity sums up to give the total force. The motion of outside singularities also contributes to forces, and the force component due to this contribution is proportional to the speed of the singularity.

'''g) Individual force of each body for multiple-body rotational flow'''.  When in addition to multiple free vortices and multiple bodies, there are bound vortices and vortex production on the body surface,  the generalized Lagally theorem still holds, but a force due to vortex production exists. This vortex production force is proportional to the vortex production rate and the distance between the vortex pair in production. With this approach,  an explicit and algebraic force formula, taking into account of all causes (inner singularities, outside vortices and bodies, motion of all singularities and bodies, and vortex production) holds individually for each body &lt;ref name=BLW&gt;{{cite web|vauthors=Bai CY, Li J, Wu ZN |title=Generalized Kutta-Joukowski theorem for multi-vortex and multi-airfoil flow with vortex production — A general model|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cja.2014.03.014|publisher=Chinese Journal of Aeronautics,2014 Vol.27(5), pp1037-1050}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the role of other bodies represented by additional singularities. Hence a force decomposition according to  bodies is possible.

'''h) General three-dimensional viscous flow'''. For general three-dimensional, viscous and unsteady flow, force formulas are expressed in integral forms. The volume integration of certain flow quantities, such as vorticity moments, is related to forces. Various forms of integral approach are now available for unbounded domain&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wu JC, Theory for aerodynamic force and moment in viscous flows, AIAA Journal,1981, vol. 19, pp432-441.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howe MS, On the force and moment on a body in an incompressible fluid, with application to rigid bodies and bubbles at high Reynolds numbers, Quartly Journal of Mechanics and Applied Mathematics, 1995,vol.48, pp401-425.&lt;/ref&gt; and for artificially truncated domain.&lt;ref&gt;Wu JC, Lu XY &amp; Zhuang LX, Integral force acting on a body due to local flow structures, Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 2007, vol.576, pp265-286.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kutta Joukowski theorem can be recovered from these approaches when applied to a two-dimensional airfoil and when the flow is steady and unseparated.

'''i) Lifting line theory for wings, wing-tip vortices and induced drag'''. A wing has a finite span, and the circulation at any section of the wing varies with the spanwise direction. This variation is compensated by the release of streamwise vortices (called trailing vortices), due to conservation of vorticity or Kelvin Theorem of Circulation Conservation. These streamwise vortices merge to two counter-rotating strong spirals, called wing tip vortices,  separated by distance close to the wingspan and may be visible if the sky is cloudy. Treating the trailing vortices as a series of semi-infinite straight line vortices leads to the well-known lifting line theory. By this theory, the wing has a lift force smaller than that predicted by a purely two-dimensional theory using the Kutta–Joukowski theorem. Most importantly, there is an induced drag. This induced drag is a pressure drag which has nothing to do with frictional drag.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1071">A '''magnetic impurity''' is an [[impurity]] in a host metal that has a [[magnetic moment]]. The magnetic impurity can then interact with the conduction electrons of the metal, leading to interesting physics such as the [[Kondo effect]], and [[heavy fermion]] behaviour. Some examples of magnetic impurities that metals can be doped with are [[iron]] and [[nickel]]. Such an impurity will contribute a [[Curie-Weiss]] term to the [[magnetic susceptibility]], 
:&lt;math&gt;\chi_{imp} = \frac{C}{T + \theta}&lt;/math&gt;.

Early theoretical work concentrated on explaining the trend observed as the impurity was varied across the [[transition metal]] group. Based on the idea of a [[virtual bound state]], [[P._W._Anderson|Anderson]] proposed a model that was successful in explaining the formation of a localized magnetic moment from a magnetic impurity.

A '''people mover''' or '''automated people mover''' ('''APM''') is a type of small scale [[automated guideway transit]] system. The term is generally used only to describe systems serving relatively small areas such as airports, downtown districts or theme parks.

The term was originally applied to three different systems, developed roughly at the same time. One was [[Transit Expressway Revenue Line|Skybus]], an automated mass transit system [[prototype]]d by the [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] beginning in 1964.&lt;ref name="urlSkybus in Pittsburgh"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brooklineconnection.com/history/Facts/Skybus.html |title=Skybus in Pittsburgh |work= |accessdate=2010-04-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210165740/http://www.brooklineconnection.com/history/Facts/Skybus.html |archivedate=2010-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Finally the last, called [[PeopleMover]] or WEDway PeopleMover, was an attraction that was originally presented by [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company]] and that opened at [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Now, however, the term "people mover" is generic, and may use technologies such as [[monorail]], [[Rail tracks|duorail]], [[automated guideway transit]] or [[Maglev train|maglev]]. Propulsion may involve conventional on-board electric motors, [[linear motor]]s or [[Cable car (railway)|cable traction]].
[[File:Morgantown_PRT_-_Beechurst_Station.jpg|right|thumb|[[Morgantown PRT]]]]
Generally speaking, larger APMs are referred to by other names. The most generic is "[[automated guideway transit]]", which encompasses any automated system regardless of size. Some complex APMs deploy fleets of small vehicles over a track network with off-line stations, and supply near non-stop service to passengers. These taxi-like systems are more usually referred to as [[personal rapid transit]] (PRT). Larger systems, with vehicles with 20 to 40 passengers, are sometimes referred to as "[[group rapid transit]]" (GRT), although this term is not particularly common. Other complex APMs have similar characteristics to [[mass transit]] systems, and there is no clear cut distinction between a complex APM of this type and an automated mass transit system. Another term "[[Light Metro]]" is also applied to describe the system worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Michael Taplin |url=http://www.lrta.org/world/worldind.html |title=A world of trams and urban transit - A complete listing of Light Rail, Light Railway, Tramway &amp; Metro systems throughout the World |publisher=Light Rail Transit Association (LRTA) |date=March 2013 |accessdate=2014-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.railjournal.com/index.php/metros/korean-city-opens-automatic-light-metro.html?channel=542#.T_yoifVQT2k |title=Korean city opens automatic light metro |website=Rail Journal.com |date= |accessdate=2014-11-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106102915/http://www.railjournal.com/index.php/metros/korean-city-opens-automatic-light-metro.html?channel=542#.T_yoifVQT2k |archivedate=2014-11-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-bjp-promises-light-metro-in-bhopal-and-indore-2037210 |title=BJP promises light metro in Bhopal and Indore |website=dnaindia.com |date= |accessdate=2014-11-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205145459/http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-bjp-promises-light-metro-in-bhopal-and-indore-2037210 |archivedate=2014-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Never-Stop Railway===
One of the first automated systems for human transportation was the screw-driven 'Never-Stop-Railway',&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/619596# British Film Institute] Never-Stop Railway&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=8750 British Pathe (agency)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611090212/http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=8750 |date=2011-06-11 }} Never-Stop Railway film (probably 1925)&lt;/ref&gt; constructed for the [[British Empire Exhibition]] at [[Wembley]], [[London]] in 1924. This railway consisted of 88 unmanned carriages, on a continuous double track along the northern and eastern sides of the exhibition, with reversing loops at either end.

The carriages ran on two parallel concrete beams and were guided by pulleys running on the inner side of these concrete beams,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=8750 British Pathe (agency)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611090212/http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=8750 |date=2011-06-11 }} Never-Stop Railway film (probably 1925), see at 01:24 for analyzing the guiding system&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hulton Archive:[http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/modified-tractor-running-on-the-never-stop-railway-at-the-news-photo/3314382 modified tractor running on the 'Never Stop Railway'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723122027/http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/modified-tractor-running-on-the-never-stop-railway-at-the-news-photo/3314382 |date=2013-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and were propelled by gripping a revolving screw thread running between the tracks in a pit; by adjusting the pitch of this thread at different points, the carriages could be sped up, or slowed down to a walking pace at stations, to allow passengers to join and leave. The railway ran reliably for the two years of the exhibition, and was then dismantled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040905/spectrum/art.htm | title = Exhibiting the Empire | newspaper = The Tribune | location = Chandigarh | accessdate = 2006-11-06 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070312051308/http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040905/spectrum/art.htm | archivedate = 2007-03-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goodyear and Stephens-Adamson ===
[[File:PHX_SKY_TRAIN.jpg|thumb|[[PHX Sky Train]] in Phoenix, Arizona, opened in 2013]]
In late 1949, Mike Kendall, chief engineer and Chairman of the Board of Stephens-Adamson Manufacturing Company, an Illinois-based manufacturer of [[conveyor belt]]s and [[conveyor system|systems]],&lt;ref name=StephensWeb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stephens-adamson.com/about.htm|title=About S-A|publisher=Stephens-Adamson|accessdate=2014-01-05|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318200854/http://www.stephens-adamson.com/about.htm|archivedate=2013-03-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; asked Al Neilson, an engineer in the Industrial Products Division of [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co.]], if Goodyear had ever considered working on People Movers. He felt that with Goodyear's ability to move materials in large quantities on [[conveyor belts]] they should consider moving batches of people.

Four years of engineering design, development and testing led to a joint patent being issued for three types of people movers, named Speedwalk, Speedramp, and Carveyor.
Goodyear would sell the concept and Stephens-Adamson would manufacture and install the components.

A Speedwalk consisted of a flat conveyor belt riding on a series of rollers, or a flat slippery surface, moving at {{convert|1.5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} (approximately half the speed of walking). The passengers would walk onto the belt and could stand or walk to the exit point. They were supported by a moving [[handrail]]. Customers were expected to include [[airport terminal]]s, [[ballpark]]s, [[train station]]s, etc.  Today, several manufacturers produce similar units called [[moving walkway]]s.

A Speedramp was very similar to a Speedwalk but it was used to change elevations; up or down a floor level. This could have been accomplished by an escalator, but the Speedramp would allow wheeled luggage, small [[handcart]]s etc. to ride the belt at an operating cost predicted to be much lower than [[escalator]]s or [[elevator]]s. The first successful installation of a Speedramp was in the spring of 1954 at the [[Hudson and Manhattan]] Railroad Station in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]] to connect the [[Erie Railroad]] to the [[Hudson and Manhattan Railroad|Hudson and Manhattan Tubes]]. This unit was {{convert|227|ft|m}} long with a rise of {{convert|22|ft|m}} on a 15 degree [[Grade (slope)|grade]], and only cost $75,000.

A Carveyor consisted of many small cubicles or cars carrying ten people riding on a flat conveyor belt from point A to point B. The belt rode on a series of motorized rollers. The purpose of the motorized rollers was to facilitate the gradual acceleration and deceleration speeds on the conveyor belt and overcome the tendency of all belts to stretch at start up and during shutdown. At point "A" passengers would enter a Speedwalk running parallel to the belts and cars of the Carveyor. The cars would be moving at the same speed as the Speedwalk; the passengers would enter the cars and be seated, while the motorized rollers would increase the speed of the cars up to the traveling speed (which would be preset depending on the distance to be covered). At point B Passengers could disembark and by means of a series of flat slower belts (Speedwalks) go to other Carveyors to other destinations or out to the street. The cars at point B would continue on rollers around a semicircle and then reverse the process carrying passengers back to point A. The initial installation was to be the [[42nd Street Shuttle]] in [[New York City]] between [[Times Square (IRT 42nd Street Shuttle)|Times Square]] and [[Grand Central (IRT 42nd Street Shuttle)|Grand Central]] station.

The first mention of the Carveyor in a hardback book was in ''There's Adventure in Civil Engineering'' by Neil P. Ruzic (1958), one of a series of books published by ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' in the 1950s in their "Career" series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruzic|first=Neil|title=There's Adventure in Civil Engineering |asin=B0007E9RTY|year=1958|publisher= Popular Mechanics Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book the Carveyor was already installed and operational in downtown Los Angeles.

Colonel Sydney H. Bingham, Chairman of the [[New York City Board of Transportation]], had several meetings with a group of architects who were trying to revamp the whole [[New York City Subway]] system in the heart of town to connect Pennsylvania Station, [[Madison Square Garden]], Times Square, Grand Central and several new [[office complex]]es together.   Several of these architects were involved in other programs, and in later years many variations of the Carveyor people movers were developed.

In November 1954 the [[New York City Transit Authority]] issued an order to Goodyear and Stephens-Adamson to build a complete Carveyor system between Times Square and Grand Central. A brief summary and confirmation can be found in ''Time'' magazine on November 15, 1954. under the heading "Subway of the Future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Subway of the Future|publisher= [[Time Inc.|Time]]|date=November 15, 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost was to be under $4 million, but the order was never fulfilled due to political difficulties.

[[Chocolate World]] in [[Hershey, Pennsylvania]], [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] in California, and [[Walt Disney World]] in Florida are among many locations that have used variations of the Carveyor concept.

=== Other developments ===
[[File:Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center Station Platform.JPG|thumb|Platform of Zhujiang New Town APM in Guangzhou, China ]]
The term 'people mover' was used by [[Walt Disney]], when he and his [[Walt Disney Imagineering|Imagineers]] were working on the new 1967 [[Tomorrowland]] at [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]]. The name was used as a working title for a new attraction, the [[PeopleMover]]. According to Imagineer [[Bob Gurr]], "the name got stuck," and it was no longer a working title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the late 1960s and into the 1970s, people movers were the topic of intense development around the world. Worried about the growing congestion and pollution in downtown areas due to the spread of cars, many countries started studying mass transit systems that would lower capital costs to the point where any city could afford to deploy them. Most of these systems used elevated guideways, which were much less expensive to deploy than underground tunnels. However, elevating the track causes problems with noise, so traditional steel-wheel-on-rail solutions were rare as they squealed when rounding bends in the rails. Rubber tired solutions were common, but some systems used [[hovercraft]] techniques or various [[magnetic levitation]] systems.

Two major government funded APM projects are notable. In Germany, [[Demag|Mannesmann Demag]] and [[Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm]] developed a system known as [[Cabinentaxi]] during the 1970s. Cabinetaxi featured small cars with from four to eight seats that were called to pick up passengers on-demand and drove directly to their destination. The stations were "offline", allowing the cabs to stop by moving off the main lines while other cars continued to their destinations. The system was designed so the cars could be adapted to run on top or bottom of the track (but not easily converted from one to the other), allowing dual-track movements from a single elevated guideway only slightly wider than the cars. A test track was completed in 1975 and ran until development was completed in 1979, but no deployments followed and the companies abandoned the system shortly thereafter.

In the U.S., a 1966 federal bill provided funding that led to the development of APM systems under the Downtown People Mover Program. Four systems were developed, [[Rohr, Inc.|Rohr]]'s [[ROMAG]], [[Ling-Temco-Vought|LTV]]'s [[Vought AirTrans|AirTrans]], [[Ford]]'s APT and [[Otis Elevator]]'s hovercraft design. A major presentation of the systems was organized as TRANSPO'72 at [[Dulles Airport]] where the various systems were presented to delegations from numerous cities in the US. Prototype systems and test tracks were built during the 1970s.  One notable example was Pittsburgh's Skybus, which was proposed by the [[Port Authority of Allegheny County]] to replace its streetcar system, which, having large stretches of private right of way, was not suited for bus conversion.  A short demonstration line was set up in South Park and large tracts of land were secured for its facilities.  However, opposition arose to the notion that it would replace the streetcar system.  This, combined with the immaturity of the technology and other factors, led the Port Authority to abandon the project and pursue alternatives. By the start of the 1980s most politicians had lost interest in the concept and the project was repeatedly de-funded in the early 1980s. Only two APMs were developed as a part of the People Mover Program in the US, the [[Metromover]] in [[Miami]], and the [[Detroit People Mover]]. The [[Jacksonville Skyway]] was built in the late 1980s.

==From development to implementation==
Although many government-funded systems were generally considered failures, several APM systems developed by other groups have been much more successful. Lighter systems with shorter tracks are widely deployed at airports; the world's first airport people movers, the [[Tampa International Airport People Movers]], were installed in 1971 at [[Tampa International Airport]] in the [[United States]]. APMs have now become common at large airports and hospitals in the United States.

Driver-less metros have become common in Europe and parts of Asia. The economics of automated trains tend to reduce the scale so tied to "mass" transit (the largest operating expense is the driver's salary, which is only affordable if very large numbers of passengers are paying fares), so that small-scale installations are feasible{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}. Thus cities normally thought of as too small to build a metro (e.g. [[Rennes]], [[Lausanne]], [[Brescia]], etc.) are now doing so.

On September 30, 2006, the [[Peachliner]] in [[Komaki, Aichi|Komaki]], [[Aichi Prefecture]], [[Japan]] became that nation's first people mover to cease operations.

'''Petro-aggression''' is the tendency for a petrostate to be involved in international conflicts, or to be the targets of them.  One study suggests that petro-revolutionary states are 250 percent more likely to instigate international conflicts than a typical country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Colgan|first=Jeff|title=Petro-Aggression: When Oil Causes War|year=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It remains unclear whether the pattern of petro-aggression found in oil-rich countries also applies to other natural resources besides oil.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13532">'''Petrocurrency''', is a [[neologism]] used with three distinct meanings, often confused:

#Dollars paid to oil producing nations ([[Petrodollar recycling|'''Petrodollar''']] or [[Petrodollar recycling]]) A term invented in the [[Opec oil crises|1970s]] meaning Trading surpluses of oil-producing nations.&lt;ref name="investo"&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of 'petrodollars' |url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/petrodollars.asp |website=www.investopedia.com |publisher=Investopedia |accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Currencies of oil-producing nations which tend to rise in value against other currencies when the [[price of oil]] rises (and fall when it falls).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Amadeo |first1=Kimberley |title=Petrodollar and the system that created it |url=https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-a-petrodollar-3306358 |accessdate=19 October 2018 |publisher=The Balance |date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Pricing of oil in US Dollars: Currencies used as a [[unit of account]] to price oil in the international market.&lt;ref name="ven"&gt;{{cite news |title=US dollars no longer a quote currency in Venezuela |url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-10/18/c_137540829.htm |accessdate=19 October 2018 |publisher=Xinhua Net |date=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oil producers' trading surpluses==
{{Main|Petrodollar recycling}}
"Petrocurrency" or (more commonly) "petrodollars" are popular shorthand for revenues from [[petroleum]] exports, mainly from the [[OPEC#Membership|OPEC members]] plus [[Russia]] and [[Norway]]. Especially during periods of historically expensive oil, the associated financial flows can reach a scale of hundreds of billions of [[US dollar]]-equivalents per year – including a wide range of transactions in a variety of currencies, some [[Currency peg|pegged]] to the US dollar and some not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nsouli |first=Saleh M. |title=Petrodollar Recycling and Global Imbalances |url=http://www.imf.org/en/news/articles/2015/09/28/04/53/sp032306a |publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]] |date=March 23, 2006 |accessdate=January 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21553424 |title=Petrodollar Profusion |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |date=April 28, 2012 |accessdate=February 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Currencies correlated with oil prices==
The [[pound sterling]] has sometimes been regarded as a petrocurrency as a result of [[North Sea oil]] exports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cepr.org/pubs/Bulletin/meets/154.htm Sterling and the EMS In for a penny&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dutch guilder]] was once regarded as a petrocurrency due to its large quantities of natural gas and [[North Sea oil]] exports. The Dutch Guilder strengthened greatly in the 1970s, after [[OPEC]] began a series of price hikes throughout the decade that consequently increased the value of all oil producing nations' currencies. However, as a result of the appreciation of the Guilder, industrial manufacturing and services in the Netherlands during the 1970s and into the 1980s were crowded out of the larger national economy, and the country became increasingly non-competitive on world markets due to the high cost of Dutch industrial and service exports . This phenomenon is often referred to in economics literature as [[Dutch disease]].

The [[Canadian dollar]] is increasingly viewed as a petrocurrency in the 21st Century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Generally speaking, as the price of oil rises, oil-related export revenues rise for an oil exporting nation, and thus constitute a larger monetary component of exports. Thus it has been for Canada. As their [[oil sands]] deposits have been increasingly exploited and sold on the international market, movements of the Canadian dollar have become increasingly correlated with the price of oil.  For example, the exchange rate of Canadian dollars for [[Japanese yen]] (99% of Japan's oil is imported) is 85% correlated with crude prices. As long as oil exports remain a strong component of Canada’s exports, oil prices will influence the value of the Canadian dollar. If the share of oil and gas exports increases further, the link between oil prices and the exchange rate may become even stronger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.ubc.ca/2015/04/16/is-the-canadian-dollar-a-petrocurrency/|title=Is the Canadian dollar a petrocurrency?|work=UBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Currencies used to trade oil==
As the world's dominant [[reserve currency]] the [[United States dollar]] has been a major currency for trading oil (sometimes the term 'Petrodollar' is mistakenly used to refer to this concept).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/oct/06/oil-us-dollar-threat-to-america&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ft.com/content/27a6a302-02eb-11e8-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2018, [[Venezuela]] joined the group of countries that allow their oil to be purchased in currencies other than US Dollars, thus allowing purchases in [[Euros]], [[Yuan (currency)|Yuan]] and other directly convertible currencies.&lt;ref name="ven"&gt;{{cite news |title=US dollars no longer a quote currency in Venezuela |url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-10/18/c_137540829.htm |accessdate=19 October 2018 |publisher=Xinhua Net |date=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other nations that permit  this include [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="scott"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cooper |first1=Andrew Scott |title=The Oil Kings: How the U.S., Iran, and Saudi Arabia Changed the Balance of Power in the Middle East |date=11 September 2012 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location=New York |isbn=9781439155189 |accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II to 1970===
After WWII, international oil prices were for some time based on discounts or premiums relative to that for oil in the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, M. A. (1972). ''The World Petroleum Market'', Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods conference]] in the year 1944, the UK and its allies discontinued linking their currencies with gold; however, the US dollar continued to be pegged to gold, at $35 per ounce -- from 1941 to 1971.

===1970 to 2000===
[[Nixon_Shock|President Nixon cancelled the fixed-rate convertibility of US dollars to gold in 1971]]. In the absence of fixed value convertibility to gold, compared to other currencies, the US dollar subsequently deteriorated in value for several years, making fixed USD to local currency exchange rates unsustainable for most countries.&lt;ref name= nixon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inflationdata.com/articles/2014/05/30/oil-petrodollars-gold/|title= Oil, Petrodollars and Gold|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the agreements&lt;ref name= agreements&gt;{{Cite news |last=Wong |first=Andrea |date=May 30, 2016 |title=The Untold Story Behind Saudi Arabia's 41-Year U.S. Debt Secret |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-05-30/the-untold-story-behind-saudi-arabia-s-41-year-u-s-debt-secret |work=[[Bloomberg News]] |access-date=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 1971 and 1973, OPEC oil is generally quoted in US dollars, sometimes referred to as petrodollars.

In October 1973, [[OPEC]] declared an [[1973 oil crisis|oil embargo]] in response to the United States' and Western Europe's support of [[Israel]] in the [[Yom Kippur War]].

===Iran===

Since the beginning of 2003, Iran has required payment in euros for exports to Asia and Europe. The government opened an [[Iranian Oil Bourse]] on the free trade zone on the island of [[Kish, Iran|Kish]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iran-daily.com/1383/2199/html/economy.htm|title=Kish Oil Exchange Planned|last1=|first1=|last2=|first2=|date=January 24, 2006|website=Iran-Daily.com|publisher=Iran Daily|access-date=|quote=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517160248/http://www.iran-daily.com/1383/2199/html/economy.htm|archivedate=May 17, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/HC22Ak01.html|title=A frenzied Persian new year|date=March 22, 2006|work=[[Asia Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the express purpose of trading oil priced in other currencies, including euros.

===OPEC and shale oil boom===
The [[shale oil]] boom in the USA starting in the early 2000s through 2010s (as well as increased production capacity in many other countries) greatly limited OPEC's ability to control oil prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/391283/if-opec-dead-how-is-saudi-arabia-still-calling-the-shots-in-the-oil-market/|title= If OPEC is dead, how is Saudi Arabia still calling the shots in the oil market?|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/23/business/energy-environment/new-balance-of-power.html |title= New Balance of Power |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, due to a drastic fall in [[Nymex]] crude oil price to as low as $35.35 dollars per barrel in 2015, many oil-exporting countries have had severe problems in balancing their budget.

'''Polyvinylidene fluoride''' or '''polyvinylidene difluoride''' ('''PVDF''') is a highly non-reactive [[thermoplastic]] [[fluoropolymer]] produced by the polymerization of [[1,1-Difluoroethylene|vinylidene difluoride]].

PVDF is a specialty plastic used in applications requiring the highest purity, as well as resistance to solvents, acids and bases. Compared to other fluoropolymers, like [[polytetrafluoroethylene]] (Teflon), PVDF has a low density (1.78&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).

It is available as piping products, sheet, tubing, films, plate and an insulator for premium wire. It can be injected, molded or welded and is commonly used in the chemical, semiconductor, medical and defense industries, as well as in [[lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion batteries]]. It is also available as a [[Cross-link|crosslinked]] [[closed-cell foam]], used increasingly in aviation and aerospace applications. It can also be used in repeated contact with food products, as it is FDA-compliant and absolutely non-toxic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plasticsintl.com/pvdf.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

As a fine powder grade, it is an ingredient in high-end paints for metals. These PVDF paints have extremely good [[Gloss paint|gloss]] and color retention. They are in use on many prominent buildings around the world, such as the [[Petronas Towers]] in Malaysia and [[Taipei 101]] in Taiwan, as well as on commercial and residential metal roofing.

PVDF membranes are used in [[western blot]]s for the immobilization of proteins, due to its non-specific affinity for amino acids.

PVDF is also used as a binder component for the carbon electrode in supercapacitors and for other electrochemical applications.

==Names==

PVDF is sold under a variety of brand names including KF ([[Kureha Chemical Industries|Kureha]]), Hylar ([[Solvay S.A.|Solvay]]), Kynar ([[Arkema]]) and Solef (Solvay).

==Properties==
In 1969, strong [[piezoelectricity]] was observed in PVDF, with the piezoelectric coefficient of [[Piezoelectricity#Mechanism|poled]] (placed under a strong electric field to induce a net dipole moment) thin films as large as 6–7 [[picocoulomb|pC]]/[[Newton (units)|N]]: 10 times larger than that observed in any other polymer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1143/JJAP.8.975|title=The Piezoelectricity of Poly (vinylidene Fluoride)|year=1969|last1=Kawai|first1=Heiji|journal=Japanese Journal of Applied Physics|volume=8|issue=7|pages=975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PVDF has a [[glass transition temperature]] (T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;) of about −35 °[[Celsius|C]] and is typically 50–60% crystalline. To give the material its piezoelectric properties, it is mechanically stretched to orient the molecular chains and then poled under tension. PVDF exists in several forms: alpha (TGTG'), beta (TTTT), and gamma (TTTGTTTG') phases, depending on the chain conformations as trans (T) or gauche (G) linkages. When poled, PVDF is a [[ferroelectric]] polymer, exhibiting efficient [[piezoelectric]] and [[pyroelectric]] properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lolla|first=Dinesh|last2=Gorse|first2=Joseph|last3=Kisielowski|first3=Christian|last4=Miao|first4=Jiayuan|last5=Taylor|first5=Philip L.|last6=Chase|first6=George G.|last7=Reneker|first7=Darrell H.|date=2015-12-17|title=Polyvinylidene fluoride molecules in nanofibers, imaged at atomic scale by aberration corrected electron microscopy|url=http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=C5NR01619C|journal=Nanoscale|language=en|volume=8|issue=1|pages=120–128|doi=10.1039/c5nr01619c|issn=2040-3372}}&lt;/ref&gt; These characteristics make it useful in [[sensor]] and [[battery (electricity)|battery]] applications. Thin films of PVDF are used in some newer [[thermal camera]] sensors.

Unlike other popular piezoelectric materials, such as [[lead zirconate titanate]] (PZT), PVDF has a negative [[piezoelectric coefficient|d&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt;]] value. Physically, this means that PVDF will compress instead of expand or vice versa when exposed to the same electric field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lolla|first=Dinesh|last2=Lolla|first2=Manideep|last3=Abutaleb|first3=Ahmed|last4=Shin|first4=Hyeon U.|last5=Reneker|first5=Darrell H.|last6=Chase|first6=George G.|date=2016-08-09|title=Fabrication, Polarization of Electrospun Polyvinylidene Fluoride Electret Fibers and Effect on Capturing Nanoscale Solid Aerosols|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/9/8/671|journal=Materials|language=en|volume=9|issue=8|pages=671|doi=10.3390/ma9080671}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Processing==
PVDF may be synthesized from the gaseous [[vinylidene fluoride]] (VDF) monomer via a free radical (or controlled radical) polymerization process. This may be followed by processes such as melt casting, or processing from a solution (e.g. solution casting, [[spin coating]], and film casting). [[Langmuir-Blodgett film]]s have also been made. In the case of solution-based processing, typical solvents used include [[dimethylformamide]] and the more volatile [[butanone]]. In aqueous [[emulsion polymerization]], the [[fluorosurfactant]] [[perfluorononanoic acid]] is used in [[anion]] form as a processing aid by solubilizing monomers.&lt;ref name=Prevedouros2006&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Prevedouros K, Cousins IT, Buck RC, Korzeniowski SH |title=Sources, fate and transport of perfluorocarboxylates |journal=Environ Sci Technol |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=32–44 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16433330 |doi=10.1021/es0512475 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to other fluoropolymers, it has an easier [[Polymer melt|melt]] process because of its relatively low melting point of around 177&amp;nbsp;°C.

Processed materials are typically in the non-piezoelectric alpha phase. The material must either be stretched or annealed to obtain the piezoelectric beta phase. The exception to this is for PVDF [[thin films]] (thickness in the order of micrometres). Residual stresses between thin films and the substrates on which they are processed are great enough to cause the beta phase to form.

In order to obtain a piezoelectric response, the material must first be poled in a large electric field. Poling of the material typically requires an external field of above 30 [[Mega-|M]][[Volt|V]]/m. Thick films (typically &gt;100 [[micrometre|µm]]) must be heated during the poling process in order to achieve a large piezoelectric response. Thick films are usually heated to 70–100&amp;nbsp;°C during the poling process.

A quantitative defluorination process was described by [[mechanochemistry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1002/app.1663|title= Mechanochemical solid-phase reaction between polyvinylidene fluoride and sodium hydroxide|year= 2001|last1= Zhang|first1= Qiwu|last2= Lu|first2= Jinfeng|last3= Saito|first3= Fumio|last4= Baron|first4= Michel|journal= Journal of Applied Polymer Science|volume= 81|issue= 9|pages= 2249}}&lt;/ref&gt; for safe eco-friendly PVDF waste processing.

==Applications==
[[File:A UPW Installation using PVDF Piping.png|thumb|right|PVDF piping used to carry [[ultrapure water]].]]
PVDF is commonly used as insulation on electrical wires, because of its combination of flexibility, low weight, low thermal conductivity, high chemical corrosion resistance, and heat resistance. Most of the narrow 30-gauge wire used in [[wire wrap]] circuit assembly and [[printed circuit board]] rework is PVDF-insulated. In this use the wire is generally referred to as "Kynar wire", from the trade name.

The piezoelectric properties of PVDF are exploited in the manufacture of [[tactile sensor#Tactile sensor arrays|tactile sensor arrays]], inexpensive [[strain gauges]], and lightweight audio [[transducer]]s. Piezoelectric panels made of PVDF are used on the Venetia Burney Student Dust Counter, a scientific instrument of the [[New Horizons]] space probe that measures dust density in the [[outer solar system]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

PVDF is the standard binder material used in the production of composite electrodes for lithium-ion batteries.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} {{nobr|1−2%}} weight solution of PVDF dissolved in [[Methylpyrrolidone|''N''-methyl-2-pyrrolidone]] (NMP) is mixed with an active lithium storage material such as graphite, silicon, tin, LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, LiMn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, or LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and a conductive additive such as [[carbon black]] or [[carbon nanofiber]]s. This slurry is cast onto a metallic current collector and the NMP is evaporated to form a composite or [[paste electrode]]. PVDF is used because it is chemically inert over the potential range used, and does not react with the electrolyte or lithium.

In the biomedical sciences, PVDF is used in [[immunoblotting]] as an [[artificial membrane]] (usually with 0.22 or 0.45 micrometre pore sizes), on which proteins are transferred using electricity (see [[western blotting]]). PVDF is resistant to solvents and, therefore, these membranes can be easily stripped and reused to look at other proteins. PVDF membranes may be used in other biomedical applications as part of a membrane filtration device, often in the form of a syringe filter or wheel filter. The various properties of this material, such as heat resistance, resistance to chemical corrosion, and low protein binding properties, make this material valuable in the biomedical sciences for preparation of medications as a sterilizing filter, and as a filter to prepare samples for analytical techniques such as [[high performance liquid chromatography]] (HPLC), where small amounts of particulate matter can damage sensitive and expensive equipment.

PVDF is used for specialty [[monofilament fishing line]]s, sold as fluorocarbon replacements for nylon monofilament. The surface is harder, so it is more resistant to abrasion and sharp fish teeth. Its [[optical density]] is lower than nylon, which makes the line less discernible to sharp fish eyes. It is also denser than nylon, making it sink faster towards fish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seaguar.com/about-seaguar/seaguar-history-01.htm Seaguar history&amp;nbsp;— Kureha America, Inc. manufacturer's site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620214019/http://www.seaguar.com/about-seaguar/seaguar-history-01.htm |date=2010-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

PVDF transducers have the advantage of being dynamically more suitable for [[modal testing]] than semiconductor [[piezoresistive transducer]]s, and more compliant for structural integration than [[piezoceramic transducer]]s. For those reasons, the use of PVDF active sensors is a keystone for the development of future structural health monitoring methods, due to their low cost and compliance.&lt;ref name=Guzman&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/0964-1726/22/6/065020|title=Survivability of integrated PVDF film sensors to accelerated ageing conditions in aeronautical/aerospace structures|year=2013|last1=Guzman|first1=E.|last2=Cugnoni|first2=J|last3=Gmür|first3=T|journal=Smart Mater Struct|volume=22|issue=6|pages=065020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other forms==
===Copolymers===
Copolymers of PVDF are also used in piezoelectric and [[electrostriction|electrostrictive]] applications. One of the most commonly used copolymers is P(VDF-trifluoroethylene), usually available in ratios of about 50:50 wt% and 65:35 wt% (equivalent to about 56:44&amp;nbsp;mol% and 70:30&amp;nbsp;mol%). Another one is P(VDF-[[tetrafluoroethylene]]). They improve the piezoelectric response by improving the crystallinity of the material.

While the copolymers' unit structures are less polar than that of pure PVDF, the copolymers typically have a much higher crystallinity. This results in a larger piezoelectric response: d&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt; values for P(VDF-TFE) have been recorded to be as high as −38 [[pico-|p]][[Coulomb|C]]/N&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.364300|title=Temperature dependence of elastic, dielectric, and piezoelectric properties of "single crystalline'' films of vinylidene fluoride trifluoroethylene copolymer |year=1997 |last1=Omote |first1=Kenji |last2=Ohigashi |first2=Hiroji |last3=Koga |first3=Keiko |journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=81|issue=6|pages=2760}}&lt;/ref&gt; versus −33 pC/N in pure PVDF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00150198608245016|title=The measurement of the shear piezoelectric coefficients of polyvinylidene fluoride |year=1986 |last1=Nix |first1=E.

===Terpolymers===
[[Terpolymer]]s of PVDF are the most promising one in terms of electromechanically induced strain. The most commonly used PVDF-based terpolymers are P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE) and P(VDF-TrFE-CFE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/apl/78/16/10.1063/1.1358847 | title = Ferroelectric and electromechanical properties of poly(vinylidene-fluoride–trifluoroethylene–chlorotrifluoroethylene) terpolymer | first1 = Haisheng | last1 = Xu | first2 = Z.-Y. | last2 = Cheng | first3 = Dana | last3 = Olson | first4 = T. | last4 = Mai | first5 = Q.

This random incorporation of CTFE in P(VDF-TrFE) copolymer disrupts the long-range ordering of the ferroelectric polar phase, resulting in the formation of nano-polar domains. When an electric field is applied, the disordered nano-polar domains change their conformation to all-[[Cis-trans isomerism|trans]] conformation, which leads to large electrostrictive strain and a high room-temperature [[dielectric constant]] of ~50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://spie.org/Publications/Proceedings/Paper/10.1117/12.2084785?origin_id=x4323&amp;start_year=2015 | title = Electric field responsive origami structures using electrostriction-based active materials | first1 = Saad | last1 = Ahmed | first2 = Erika | last2 = Arrojado | first3 = Nirmal | last3 = Sigamani | first4 = Zoubeida | last4 = Ounaies | journal = Proceedings of SPIE: Behavior and Mechanics of Multifunctional Materials and Composites 2015 | editor-first = Nakhiah C. | editor-last = Goulbourne | date = 14 May 2015 | isbn = 9781628415353 | volume = 9432 | publisher = Society of Photographic Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE) | doi = 10.1117/12.2084785 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''power strip''' (also known as an '''extension block''', '''power board''', '''power bar''', '''plug board''', '''trailing gang''', '''trailing socket''', '''plug bar''', '''trailer lead''', '''multi-socket''', '''multi-box''',  '''multiple socket''', '''multiple outlet''', '''polysocket''' and by many other variations) is a block of electrical sockets that attaches to the end of a flexible [[electrical cable|cable]] (typically with a [[mains plug]] on the other end), allowing multiple electrical devices to be powered from a single electrical socket.  Power strips are often used when many electrical devices are in proximity, such as for [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]], [[video]], [[computer]] systems, appliances, [[power tool]]s, and [[lighting]]. Power strips often include a [[circuit breaker]] to interrupt the [[electric current]] in case of an overload or a short circuit. Some power strips provide protection against electrical power surges. Typical housing styles may include strip, [[19-inch rack|rack-mount]], under-monitor and direct plug-in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tripplite.com/products/powerStrip-Buying-Guide|title=Power Strip Buying Guide|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Control ==
[[Image:Socket 5.jpg|thumb|Illuminated power switch on a power strip]]
[[Image:Master-Slave-Steckdose.jpg|thumb|German master-slave remote controlled power strip]]

Some power strips include a master [[switch]] to turn all devices on and off. This can be used with simple devices, such as lights, but not with most computers, which must use shutdown commands from the software. Computers may have open files, which may be damaged if the power is simply turned off.

Some power strips have individually switched outlets.

"[[Master/slave (technology)|Master/slave]]" strips can detect one "master" device being turned off (such as the PC itself in a computer setup, or a TV in a home theatre) and turn everything else on or off accordingly.

[[Power distribution unit|Remote control strips]] are used in [[data center]]s, to allow computer systems or other devices to be remotely restarted, often over the Internet (although this leaves them vulnerable to outside attacks).{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

== Indication ==
Many power strips have a [[neon lamp|neon]] or [[LED]] indicator light or one per output socket to show when power is on. Better-quality surge-protected strips have additional lights to indicate the status of the surge protection system, however these are not always reliable as an indicator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dansdata.com/sbs9.htm |title=Dan's Data - Power Conditioning |publisher=Dansdata.com |date=2011-12-03 |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Energy-saving features and standby power ==
Some power strips have energy-saving features, which switch off the strip if appliances go into standby mode. Using a sensor circuit, they detect if the level of power through the socket is in standby mode (less than 30 watts), and if so they will turn off that socket.&lt;ref name="Power Saving Mode Power strips"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dunn|first=Collin|title="Smart" Power Strips: Helping to Stop Idle Current Now!|url=http://www.treehugger.com/gadgets/smart-power-strips-helping-to-stop-idle-current-now.html|work=Treehugger|publisher=MNN HOLDINGS|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Energy Saving Power strips"&gt;{{cite web|title=BITS Energy Saving Smart Strip Surge Protectors|url=http://catalog.bitsltd.us/power_strips/|work=Bits Limited|publisher=Bits Limited|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reduces the consumption of [[standby power]] used by computer peripherals and other equipment when not in use, saving money and energy &lt;ref name="saving money and energy"&gt;{{cite web|last=Morris|first=Tyler|title=Are Smart Power Strips Worth the Money?|url=http://resources.verde.expert/are-smart-power-strips-worth-the-money|work=Verde Energy Efficiency Experts|publisher=Verde Sustainable Solutions, L3C|accessdate=Feb 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some more-sophisticated power strips have a master and slave socket arrangement, and when the "master" socket detects standby mode in the attached appliance's current it turns off the whole strip.

However, there can be problems detecting standby power in appliances that use more power in standby mode (such as plasma televisions) as they will always appear to the power strip to be switched on.  When using a master–slave power strip, one way to avoid such problems is to plug an appliance with a lower standby wattage (such as a DVD player) into the master socket, using it as the master control instead.

A different power strip design intended to save energy uses a passive infrared (PIR) or ultrasonic sound detector to determine if a person is nearby. If the sensors don't detect any motion for a preset period of time, the strip shuts off several outlets, while leaving one outlet on for devices that should not be powered off.  These so-called "smart power strips" are intended to be installed in offices, to shut down equipment when the office is unoccupied.

It is recommended that appliances that need a controlled [[Shutdown (computing)|shutdown]] sequence (such as many ink-jet printers) ''not'' be plugged into a slave socket on such a strip as it can damage them if they are switched off incorrectly (for example the inkjet printer may not have capped the print head in time, and consequently the ink will dry and clog the print head.)

Within Europe, power strips with energy-saving features are within the scope of the Low Voltage Directive 2006/95/EC and the EMC Directive 2004/108/EC and require a [[CE mark]].

== Socket arrangement ==
[[Image:Italian power strip.jpg|thumb|Italian power strip with two different types of socket]]

In some countries where multiple socket types are in use, a single power strip can have two or more kinds of socket. Socket arrangement varies considerably, but for physical access reasons there are rarely more than two rows. In Europe, power strips without surge suppression are normally single row, but models with surge suppression are supplied both in single and double row configurations.

If sockets on a power strip are grouped closely together, a [[power cord|cable]] with a large "[[wall wart]]" [[transformer]] at its end may cover up multiple sockets. Various designs address this problem, some by simply increasing the spacing between outlets.  Other designs include receptacles which rotate in their housing, or multiple short receptacle cords feeding from a central hub. A simple DIY method for adapting problematic power strips arrangements to large "wall warts" is to use a three-way socket adapter to extend the socket above its neighbors, providing the required clearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noprobo.com/cleverts/power-adapter-outlet-liberator |title=Power Adapter Outlet Liberator Method |publisher=Noprobo.com |date=2008-12-24 |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[PowerCube]] adapter is arranged as a cube, meaning the adapters do not fight for space next to each other.&lt;ref name=techly&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.techly.com.au/2015/03/24/powercube-solving-issue-bad-powerboards/|title=PowerCube – solving the problem of bad powerboards?|first=Tristan|last=Rayner|work=Techly|date=24 March 2015|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Surge protection and filtering ==
{{Main|Surge protector}}
[[Image:Surge protector.jpg|thumb|German/Dutch surge protected power strip (this model is unlikely to incorporate an inductor-capacitor network, due to lack of internal physical space)]]

Many power strips have built-in [[surge protector]]s or [[Radio frequency interference|EMI/RFI]] filters: these are sometimes described as '''surge suppressors''' or '''electrical line conditioners'''.  Some also provide surge suppression for phone lines, [[Television|TV]] cable coax, or network cable.  Unprotected power strips are often mistakenly called "surge suppressors" or "surge protectors" even though they may have ''no ability to suppress surges''.

Surge suppression is usually provided by one or more metal-oxide [[varistor]]s (MOVs), which are inexpensive two-terminal [[semiconductor]]s. These act as very high speed switches, momentarily limiting the peak [[voltage]] across their terminals. By design, MOV surge limiters are selected to trigger at a voltage somewhat above the local mains supply voltage, so that they do not clip normal voltage peaks, but clip abnormal higher voltages.  In the [[United States|US]], this is (nominally) 120&amp;nbsp;VAC.  It should be borne in mind that this voltage specification is [[Root mean square|RMS]], not peak, and also that it is only a nominal (approximate) value.

Mains electrical power circuits are generally [[Ground (electricity)|grounded]] (earthed), so there will be a live (hot) wire, a neutral wire, and a ground wire. Low-cost power strips often come with only one MOV mounted between the live and neutral wires. More complete (and desirable) power strips will have three MOVs, connected between each possible pair of wires. Since MOVs degrade somewhat each time they are triggered, power strips using them have a limited, and unpredictable, protective life. Some power strips have "protection status" lights which are designed to turn off if protective MOVs connected to the live wire have failed, but such simple circuits cannot detect all failure modes (such as failure of a MOV connected between neutral and ground).

The surge-induced triggering of MOVs can cause damage to an upstream device, such as an [[uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS), which typically sees an overload condition while the surge is being suppressed.  Therefore, it is recommended not to connect a surge-protected power strip to a UPS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jpaa-en.apc.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1372 |title=APC Knowledgebase - using surge strips with UPS devices |publisher=Jpaa-en.apc.com |date=2010-07-13 |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; but instead to rely solely on surge protection provided by the UPS itself.

More-elaborate power strips may use inductor-capacitor networks to achieve a similar effect of protecting equipment from high voltage spikes on the mains circuit. These more-expensive arrangements are much less prone to silent degradation than MOVs, and often have monitoring lights that indicate whether the protective circuitry is still connected.

Within the EU, power strips with surge suppression circuits can demonstrate compliance with the (LVD) Low Voltage Directive 2006/95/EC &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newapproach/standardization/harmstds/reflist/lvd.html |title=Official Journal of the European Union |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; by complying with the requirements of EN 61643-11:2002+A1. The standard covers both the performance of the surge suppression circuit and their safety. Likewise, power strips with telecoms surge suppression circuits can demonstrate compliance with the LVD by complying with the requirements of EN 61643-21:2001.

=== Daisy chaining and surge protection ===
[[File:Surge suppressor.jpg|thumb|North American surge suppressor power strip with separate  protection status indicator lights]]

Connecting MOV-protected power strips in a "daisy chain" (in a series, with each power strip plugged into a previous one in the chain)  does not necessarily increase the protection they provide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://0051d9e.netsolhost.com/FAQ's.htm |title=Surge Protection FAQs |publisher=0051d9e.netsolhost.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connecting them in this manner effectively connects their surge protection components in parallel, in theory spreading any potential surge across each surge protector. However, due to manufacturing variations between the MOVs, the surge energy will not be spread evenly, and will typically go through the one that triggers first.

Daisy chaining of power strips (known in building and electric codes as multi-plug adapters or relocatable power taps), whether surge protected or not, is specifically against most codes. As an example, the International Code Council's ''International Fire Code 2009 Edition'' in 605.4.2 states, "Relocatable power taps shall be directly connected to permanently installed receptacles."

== Overload protection ==
Where the current rating of the socket outlet, plug and lead of the power strip is equal to the rating of the circuit breaker supplying the circuit concerned, additional overload protection for the power strip is unnecessary, since the existing circuit breaker will provide the required protection.
However, where the rating of a socket outlet (and, hence, the plug and lead of the power strip) is less than the rating of the circuit breaker supplying the circuit concerned, overload protection for the power strip and its supply cable is necessary.

In the UK, standard [[AC power plugs and sockets: British and related types|BS 1363 plugs]] and sockets are rated at 13 A but are provided on circuits protected by circuit breakers of up to 32 A.
However, UK [[Consumer Protection]] legislation requires that plug-in domestic electrical goods must be provided with plugs to BS&amp;nbsp;1363, which include a fuse rated at not more than 13 A.
Hence, in the UK and in other countries using [[AC power plugs and sockets: British and related types|BS 1363 plugs]], this fused plug provides overload protection for any power strip.  The fuse must be replaced if the power strip is overloaded, causing the fuse to operate.

[[File:Australian 10 A Power Board with Overload Protection.jpg|thumb|Australian/NZ 10 A, 6 Outlet Power Board, with resettable overload protection]]
In Australia and New Zealand the rating for a standard socket outlet is 10 Amperes but these outlets are provided on circuits protected by circuit breakers of up to 20 A.   Also, it is possible to insert an Australian/NZ 10 A plug into socket outlets rated at up to 32 A.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plugsocketmuseum.nl/Australian_3hd.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Hence, all power strips sold in Australia and New Zealand are required to have overload protection so that, if the total current drawn exceeds 10 A, the inbuilt circuit breaker will operate and disconnect ''all'' connected devices.
These power strips have a reset button for the circuit breaker, which is used to return the strip to service after an overload has caused it to trip.

== Safety ==
{{Main|Domestic power safety}}
[[Image:Steckdosenleistenansammlung mit Steckernetzteilen an üblicher Computerinstallation IMGP0998.jpg|thumb|Multiple power strips and AC adapters]]

Electrical overloading can be a problem with any sort of power distribution adapter. This is especially likely if multiple high-power appliances are used, such as those with heating elements, like room heaters or electric frying pans. Power strips may have a [[circuit breaker]] integrated to prevent overload. In the UK, power strips are required to be protected by the fuse in the [[BS 1363]] plug. Some also feature a 13A BS1362 fuse in the socket end.

Power strips are generally considered a safer alternative to “double adapters”, “two-way plugs”, “three-way plugs”, or “cube taps” which plug directly into the socket with no lead for multiple appliances. These low-cost adapters are generally not fused (although more modern ones in the UK and Ireland are). Therefore, in many cases the only protection against overload is the branch circuit fuse which may well have a rating higher than the adapter. The weight of the plugs pulling on the adapter (and often pulling it part way out of the socket) can also be a problem if adapters are stacked or if they are used with brick-style power supplies. Such adapters, while still available, have largely fallen out of use in some countries (although two- and three-way adapters are still common in the US, UK, and Ireland).

When plugging a device into a power strip, a buildup of carbon or dust can cause [[Electrostatic discharge#Sparks|sparking]] to occur. This generally doesn’t pose much of a risk in a non-explosive atmosphere, but explosive atmospheres (for example, near a gasoline refueling station or a solvent cleaning facility) require specialized explosion-proof sealed electrical equipment.

=== US regulations ===
[[Image:US-power-strip-rotated.jpg|thumb|US power strip with switch]]

* [[Underwriters Laboratories]] standard 1363 contains requirements for ''relocatable power taps''. Included in the scope section of the standard is the statement: {{quote|1.1 These requirements cover cord-connected, relocatable power taps rated 250 V AC or less and 20 A AC or less. A relocatable power tap is intended only for indoor use as a temporary extension of a grounding alternating-current branch circuit for general use.}}
* [[National Electrical Code]] recognizes power strip as Multioutlet Assembly in Article 380.

=== EU and UK regulations ===
[[Image:Surge Guard Power Strip (UK).jpg|thumb|British power strip with neon indicator]]

In Europe, plugs and sockets without additional control or surge protection circuits are outside the scope of the Low Voltage Directive 2006/95/EC and controlled by National regulations, and therefore must not be CE marked. In the UK the legal requirements for plugs and sockets are listed in Statutory Instrument 1994 No. 1768, The Plugs and Sockets etc. (Safety) Regulations 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berr.gov.uk/whatwedo/sectors/sustainability/regulations/ecdirect/page12568.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422191917/http://www.berr.gov.uk/whatwedo/sectors/sustainability/regulations/ecdirect/page12568.html |archivedate=2009-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This regulation lists the requirements for all domestic plugs and sockets; including socket outlet units (power strips), see&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file38628.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207064541/http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file38628.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Electrical Equipment - Requirements for Plugs &amp; Sockets etc. - Guidance notes on the UK Plugs &amp; Sockets etc. (Safety) Regulations 1994 (S.I. 1994/1768).

The regulation requires all socket outlet units to comply with the requirements of BS 1363-2 Specification for 13A switched and unswitched socket-outlets and with the requirements of BS 5733 Specification for General requirements for electrical accessories. Sockets and socket outlets do not require independent approval under the regulations. Any plug fitted to the socket outlet unit must comply with the requirements of BS 1363-1 Specification for rewirable and non-rewirable 13A fused plugs. Plugs must also be independently approved and marked in accordance with the requirements of the regulation.

If a socket outlet unit contains additional control circuits or surge protection circuits they will fall within the scope of the Low Voltage Directive 2006/95/EC and must be CE marked. Socket outlet units with control circuits also fall within the scope of the EMC Directive 2004/108/EC.

== History ==

Examples of power strips exist in the U.S. patent system dating back as far as 1929, starting with the creation of Carl M. Peterson's "Table Tap".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1929-04-16|title=Table tap|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US1889695A/en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another early example was created by Allied Electric Products in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1950-04-14|title=Extension cord tap|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US2609414A/en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the first modern designs for the power strip were created by the U.S. firm Fedtro, which filed two patents in 1970 for designs that hew close to designs used in the modern day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1969-04-16|title=Multiple electric outlet bar|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/USD217251S/en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1969-04-16|title=Multiple electric outlet unit|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/USD216887S/en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One early iteration, called a "power board", was invented in 1972 by Australian electrical engineer Peter Talbot working under Frank Bannigan, Managing Director of Australian company [[Kambrook]]. The product was hugely successful, however, it was not patented and market share was eventually lost to other manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150406093129/http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/about-us/news-media-and-events/feature-articles-listing/powerful-patent "Powerful patents"], 17 Sep 2012, IP Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://kambrook.com.au/pages/history "Kambrook invents the power board"]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33251">The '''pseudo Jahn–Teller effect''' (PJTE), occasionally also known as '''second-order JTE''', is a direct extension of the [[Jahn–Teller effect]] (JTE) where [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] in polyatomic systems ([[molecules]] and [[solids]]) occurs even in [[Degenerate energy levels|nondegenerate electronic states]] under the influence of sufficiently low-lying excited states of appropriate symmetry.
"The pseudo Jahn–Teller effect is the only source of instability and distortions of high-symmetry configurations of polyatomic systems in nondegenerate states, and it contributes  significantly to the instability in degenerate states".&lt;ref name="Bersuker13"&gt;I. B. Bersuker, The Pseudo Jahn–Teller Effect – a Two-State Paradigm in Formation, Deformation, and Transformation of Molecular Systems and Solids, Chem. Rev., 113, 1351-1390 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In the first publication in 1957 on the (what is now called) pseudo Jahn–Teller effect (PJTE), Öpik and Pryce&lt;ref name="Öpik"&gt;U. Öpik, and M. H. L. Pryce, "Studies of the Jahn Teller Effect.1. A Survey of the Static Problem". Proc. R. Soc. A. 238 (1215): 425–447 (1957). doi:10.1098/rspa.1957.0010&lt;/ref&gt; showed that a small splitting of the degenerate electronic term does not necessarily remove the instability and distortion of the polyatomic system induced by the [[Jahn–Teller effect]] (JTE), provided the splitting is sufficiently small (the two split states remain “pseudodegenerate”), and the vibronic coupling between them is strong enough. From another perspective, the idea of vibronic admixture of different electronic terms by low-symmetry vibrations was introduced in 1933 by Herzberg and Teller&lt;ref&gt;G. Herzberg, and E. Teller, "Vibrational structure of electronic transitions for polyatomic molecules", Z. Phys. Chem. B, 21, 410 (1933).&lt;/ref&gt; to explore forbidden electronic transitions, and extended in the late 1950s by Murrell and Pople&lt;ref&gt;J. N. Murrell, and J. A. Pople, "The intensities of the symmetry-forbidden electronic bands of benzene", Proc. Phys. Soc. London, Ser. A, 69, 245 (1956).&lt;/ref&gt; and by Liehr.&lt;ref&gt;A. D. Liehr, "Interaction of the vibrational and electronic motion in some simple conjugated hydrocarbons. I. Exact calculation of the intensity of the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;1g&lt;/sub&gt; → &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;B1u, 1B2u, vibronic transitions of benzene", Z. Naturforsch. a 13, 311 (1958).&lt;/ref&gt;  The role of excited states in softening the ground state with respect to distortions in benzene was demonstrated qualitatively by Longuet-Higgins and Salem&lt;ref&gt;H. C. Longuet-Higgins, L. Salem, Proc. R. Soc. London, A 251, 172 (1959).&lt;/ref&gt; by analyzing the [[pi bond|π electron levels]] in the [[Hückel method|Hückel approximation]], while a general second-order perturbation formula for such vibronic softening was derived by Bader in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;R. F. W. Bader, Mol. Phys. 3, 137 (1960).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961 Fulton and Gouterman&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Fulton and M. Gouterman, J. Chem. Phys. 35, 1059 (1961).&lt;/ref&gt; presented a symmetry analysis of the two-level case in [[dimer (chemistry)|dimer]]s and introduced the term "pseudo Jahn–Teller effect". The first application of the PJTE to solving a major solid-state structural problem with regard to the origin of [[ferroelectricity]] was published in 1966 by Bersuker,&lt;ref name="Bersuker66"&gt;I. B. Bersuker, "On the origin of ferroelectricity in perovskite-type crystals", Phys. Lett. 20, 589 (1966).&lt;/ref&gt; and the first book on the JTE covering the PJTE was published in 1972 by Englman.&lt;ref name="Englman72"&gt;R. Englman "The Jahn–Teller Effect in Molecules and Crystals", Wiley-Interscience, (1972). {{ISBN|9780471241683}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second-order perturbation approach was employed by Pearson in 1975 to predict instabilities and distortions in molecular systems;&lt;ref name="Pearson76"&gt;G. Pearson, "Symmetry Rules for Chemical Reactions. Orbital Topology for Elementary Processes", Wiley: New York, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; he called it "second-order JTE" (SOJTE). The first explanation of PJT origin of puckering distortion as due to the vibronic coupling to the excited state was given for the N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; radical by Borden, Davidson, and Feller in 1980&lt;ref&gt;W. T. Borden, E. R. Davidson, and D. Feller, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 102, 5302 (1980).&lt;/ref&gt; (they called it "piramidalization"). Methods of numerical calculation of the PJT vibronic coupling effect with applications to spectroscopic problems were developed in the early 1980s&lt;ref&gt;H. Köppel, W. Domcke, and L. S.  Cederbaum, Adv. Chem. Phys. 57, 59 (1984); Adv. Chem. Phys.  67, 59 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;
	A significant step forward in this field was achieved in 1984 when it was shown by numerical calculations&lt;ref&gt;I. B. Bersuker, N. N. Gorinchoy, and V. Z. Polinger, "On the origin of dynamic instability of molecular systems", Theor. Chim. Acta, 66, 161 (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; that the energy gap to the active excited state may not be the ultimate limiting factor in the PJTE, as there are two other compensating parameters in the condition of instability. It was also shown that, in extension of the initial definition,&lt;ref name="Öpik"/&gt; the PJT interacting electronic states are not necessarily components emerging from the same symmetry type (as in the split degenerate term). As a result, the applicability of the PJTE became ''a priory'' unlimited. Moreover, it was shown by Bersuker that the PJTE is the only source of instability of high-symmetry configurations of polyatomic systems in nondegenerate states (works cited in Refs.&lt;ref name="Bersuker13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BP89"&gt;I. B. Bersuker and V. Z. Polinger, "Vibronic Interactions in Molecules and Crystals", Springer-Verlag, Berlin-Heidelberg-New York, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bersuker06"&gt;I. B. Bersuker, "The Jahn–Teller effect", Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;), and degeneracy and pseudodegeneracy are the only source of [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] in matter in all its forms.&lt;ref name="Bersuker16"&gt;I. B. Bersuker, "Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Matter Induced by Degeneracy and Pseudodegeneracy", in Advances in Chemical Physics, Vol. 160, S. Rice and R. Dinner, eds., Wiley, New York, 2016, pp159-208.&lt;/ref&gt; The many applications of the PJTE to the study of a variety of properties of molecular systems and solids are reflected in a number of reviews and books &lt;ref name="Bersuker13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Englman72"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearson76"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BP89"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bersuker06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bersuker16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burdett80"&gt;J. K. Burdett, "Molecular Shapes. Theoretical Models of Inorganic Stereochemistry", Wiley: New York, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoffmann88"&gt;R. Hoffmann, "Solids and Surfaces: A Chemist’s View of Bonding in Extended Structures", VCH: New York, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;), as well as in proceedings of conferences on the JTE.

==Theoretical background==

===General theory===

The equilibrium geometry of any polyatomic system in nondegenerate states is defined as corresponding to the point of the minimum of the [[potential energy surface|adiabatic potential energy surface]] (APES), where its first derivatives are zero and the second derivatives are positive. Denote the energy of the system as a function of normal displacements Q&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; by E(Q&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;). At the point of minimum (Q&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;=0) of the APES the curvature K of E(Q&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;) in the Q direction,
 
	K = (d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;E/dQ&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;                                         (1)

is positive, K &gt; 0. Very often the geometry of the system at this point of equilibrium on the APES does not coincide with the highest possible (or even with any high) symmetry expected from general symmetry considerations. For instance, linear molecules are bent at equilibrium, planar molecules are puckered, octahedral complexes are elongated, or compressed, or tilted, cubic crystals are tetragonally polarized (or have several structural phases), etc. The PJTE is the general driving force of all these distortions if they occur in the nondegenerate electronic states of the high-symmetry (reference) geometry.
	If at the reference configuration the system is structurally unstable with respect to some nuclear displacements Q&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;, than K &lt; 0 in this direction. The general formula for the energy is E = &lt;ψ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;|H|ψ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;, where H is the Hamiltonian and ψ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the wavefunction of the nondegenerate ground state. Substituting E in Eq.(1), we get (omitting the α index for simplicity)&lt;ref name="Bersuker13"/&gt;

	K=K&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;	         								                                                (2)

K&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=&lt;ψ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;|(d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H/dQ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;|ψ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;         		                         (3)

K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;=-Σ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;|&lt;ψ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;|(dH/dQ)&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;|ψ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/[E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;-E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]			                                                   (4)
 		 		 		 		 		
where ψ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; are the wavefunctions of the excited states, and the K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; expression, obtained as a second order perturbation correction, is always negative, K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;0. Therefore, if K&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;0, the K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; contribution is the only source of instability. The matrix elements in Eq. (4) are off-diagonal [[vibronic coupling]] constants,&lt;ref name="Englman72"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BP89"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bersuker06"/&gt;

	 F&lt;sub&gt;0n&lt;/sub&gt;= &lt;ψ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;|(dH/dQ)&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;|ψ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;	         	            	  (5)

They measure the mixing of the ground and excited states under the nuclear displacements Q, and therefore K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; is termed the vibronic contribution. Together with the K&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; value and the energy gap 2∆&lt;sub&gt;0n&lt;/sub&gt;=E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;-E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; between the mixing states, F&lt;sub&gt;0n&lt;/sub&gt; are the main parameters of the PJTE (see below). 
In a series of papers beginning in 1980 (see references in &lt;ref name="Bersuker13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BP89"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bersuker06"/&gt;) it was proved that for any polyatomic system in the high-symmetry configuration

K&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;0,	        			  (6)

and hence the vibronic contribution is the only source of instability of any polyatomic system in nondegenerate states.
If K&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;0 for the high-symmetry configuration of any polyatomic system, then a negative curvature, K =(K&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt; 0, can be achieved only due to the negative vibronic coupling component K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;, and only if |K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;|&gt; K&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. It follows that any distortion of the high-symmetry configuration is due to, and only to the mixing of its ground state with excited electronic states by the distortive nuclear displacements realized via the [[vibronic coupling]] in Eq. (5). The latter softens the system with respect to certain nuclear displacements (K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;0), and if this softening is larger than the original (nonvibronic) hardness K&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in this direction, the system becomes unstable with respect to the distortions under consideration, leading to its equilibrium geometry of lower symmetry, or to dissociation. 
There are many cases when neither the ground state is degenerate, nor is there a significant vibronic coupling to the lowest excited states to realize PJTE instability of the high-symmetry configuration of the system, and still there is a ground state equilibrium configuration with lower symmetry. In such cases the symmetry breaking is produced by a hidden PJTE (similar to a hidden JTE); it takes place due to a strong PJTE mixing of two excited states, one of which crosses the ground state to create a new (lower) minimum of the APES with a distorted configuration.&lt;ref name="Bersuker13"/&gt;

===The two-level problem===

The use of the second order perturbation correction, Eq. (4), for the calculation of the K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; value in the case of PJTE instability is incorrect because in this case |K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;|&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, meaning the first perturbation correction is larger than the main term, and hence the criterion of applicability of the [[perturbation theory]] in its simplest form does not hold. In this case, we should consider the contribution of the lowest excited states (that make the total curvature negative) in a pseudodegenerate problem of perturbation theory. For the simplest case when only one excited state creates the main instability of the ground state, we can treat the problem via a pseudodegenerate two-level problem, including the contribution of the higher, weaker-influencing states as a second order correction.&lt;ref name="Bersuker13"/&gt;
In the PJTE two-level problem we have two electronic states of the high-symmetry configuration, ground β and excited γ, separated by an energy interval of 2Δ, that become mixed under nuclear displacements of certain symmetry Q=Q&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;; the denotations α, β, and γ indicate, respectively, the irreducible representations to which the symmetry coordinate and the two states belong. In essence, this is the original formulation of the PJTE. Assuming that the excited state is sufficiently close to the ground one, the [[vibronic coupling]] between them should be treated as a perturbation problem for two near-degenerate states. With both interacting states non-degenerate the vibronic coupling constant F in Eq.(5) (omitting indices)is non-zero for only one coordinate Q=Q&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; with α=β×γ. This gives us directly the symmetry of the direction of softening and possible distortion of the ground state. Assuming that the primary force constants K&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in the two states are the same (for different K&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; see [1]), we get a 2×2 secular equation with the following solution for the energies ε&lt;sub&gt;±&lt;/sub&gt; of the two states interacting under the linear vibronic coupling (the energy is read off the middle of the 2Δ interval between the initial levels):

ε&lt;sub&gt;±&lt;/sub&gt;= (1/2)Q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;±[Δ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+F&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;(1/2)&lt;/sup&gt;     (7)

It is seen from this expressions that, on taking into account the vibronic coupling, F≠0, the two APES curves change in different ways: in the upper sheet the curvature (the coefficient at Q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the expansion on Q) increases, whereas in the lower one it decreases.  But until (F&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;Δ the minima of both states correspond to the point Q = 0, as in the absence of vibronic mixing. However, if

(F&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)&gt;Δ								(8)

the curvature of the lower curve of the APES becomes negative, and the system is unstable with respect to the Q displacements (Fig. 1). The minima points on the APES in this case are given by

±Q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=[F&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-Δ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/F&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;  (9)

From these expressions and Fig. 1 it is seen that while the ground state is softened (destabilized) by the PJTE, the excited state is hardened (stabilized), and this effect is the larger, the smaller Δ and the larger F. It takes place in any polyatomic system and influences many molecular properties, including the existence of stable excited states of molecular systems that are unstable in the ground state (e.g., excited states of intermediates of chemical reactions); in general, even in the absence of instability the PJTE softens the ground state and increases the vibrational frequencies in the excited state.

===Comparison with the JTE. Added covalency is driving PJTE distortions===

[[File:Jahn-Teller and pseudo Jahn-Teller effects.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Fig. 1. Energy profiles in a two-level PJTE (lower - b) versus the JTE (upper - a) in a single distortion coordinate Q.]]
The two branches of the APES for the case of strong PJTE resulting in the instability of the ground state (when the condition of instability (11) holds) are illustrated in Fig. 1b in comparison with the case when the two states have the same energy (Fig. 1a), i. e. when they are degenerate and the Jahn–Teller effect (JTE) takes place. We see that the two cases, degenerate and nondegenerate but close-in-energy (pseudodegenerate) are similar in generating two minima with distorted configurations, but there are important differences: while in the JTE there is a crossing of the two terms at the point of degeneracy (leading to conical intersections in more complicated cases), in the nondegenerate case with strong vibronic coupling there is an “avoided crossing” or “pseudo crossing”. Even a more important difference between the two vibronic coupling effects emerges from the fact that the two interacting states in the JTE are components of the same symmetry type, whereas in the PJTE each of the two states may have any symmetry. For this reason the possible kinds of distortion is very limited in the JTE, and unlimited in the PJTE. It is also noticeable that while the systems with JTE are limited by the condition of electron degeneracy, the applicability of the PJTE has no a priori limitations, as it includes also the cases of degeneracy. Even when the PJT coupling is weak and the inequality (11) does not hold, the PJTE is still significant in softening (lowering the corresponding vibrational frequency) of the ground state and increasing it in the excited state.&lt;ref name="Bersuker13"/&gt; When considering the PJTE in an excited state, all the higher in energy states destabilize it, while the lower ones stabilize it.

[[File:Fig. 2 Illustration to the origin of the PJTE as due to added covalence bonding by distortion.tif|thumb|Fig. 2. Illustration to the origin of the PJTE as due to added covalence bonding by distortion: (a) when the Fe atom in metalloporphyrins is in the porphyrin-ring in-plane position, the net overlap of its d&lt;sub&gt;z2&lt;/sub&gt; orbital with the near-neighbor nitrogen p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals is zero by symmetry, and these orbitals do not contribute to the bonding; (b) the out-of-plane displacement of Fe results in their non-zero overlap producing a covalence contribution to the bonding]]
For a better understanding it is important to follow up on how the PJTE is related to intramolecular interactions. In other words, what is the physical driving force of the PJTE distortions (transformations) in terms of well-known electronic structure and bonding? The driving force of the PJTE is added (improved) covalence: the PJTE distortion takes place when it results in energy gain due to better covalence bonding between the atoms in the distorted configuration.&lt;ref name="Bersuker13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bersuker06"/&gt; Indeed, in the starting high-symmetry configuration the wavefunctions of the electronic states, ground and excited, are orthogonal by definition. By distortion their orthogonality is violated, and a nonzero overlap between them occurs. If for two near-neighbor atoms the ground state wavefunction pertains (mainly) to one of them, while the excited state wavefunction belongs (mainly) to the other one, the overlap by distortion adds covalency to the bonding between them, facilitating the distortion (Fig. 2).

==Applications==
Applications of the PJTE to solving chemical, physical, biological, and [[materials science]] problems are innumerable; as stated above, the PJTE is the only source of instability and distortions in high-symmetry configurations of molecular systems and solids with nondegenerate states, hence any problem steaming from such instability can be treated by the PJTE. Below are some illustrative examples.

=== Linear systems ===
'''PJTE versus [[Renner–Teller effect]] in bending distortions'''. Linear molecules are exceptions from the JTE, and for a long time it was assumed that their bending distortions in degenerate states (observed in many molecules) is produced by the Renner–Teller effect (RTE) (the splitting of the generate state by the quadratic terms of the vibronic coupling). However, recently it was proved (see in the review &lt;ref name="Bersuker13"/&gt;) that the RTE, by splitting the degenerate electronic state, just softens the lower branch of the APES, but this lowering of the energy is not enough to overcome the rigidity of the linear configuration and to produce bending distortions. It follows that the bending distortion of linear molecular systems is due to, and only to the PJTE that mixes the electronic state under consideration with higher in energy (excited) states. This statement is enhanced by the fact that many linear molecules in nondegenerate states (and hence with no RTE) are, too, bent in the equilibrium configuration. The physical reason for the difference between the PJTE and the RTE in influencing the degenerate term is that while in the former case the vibronic coupling with the excited state produces additional covalent bonding that makes the distorted configuration preferable (see above, section 2.3), the RTE has no such influence; the splitting of the degenerate term in the RTE takes place just because the charge distribution in the two states becomes nonequivalent under the bending distortion.

'''[[Peierls distortion]]s in linear chains'''. In linear molecules with three or more atoms there may be PJTE distortions that do not violate the linearity but change the interatomic distances. For instance, as a result of the PJTE a centrosymmetric linear system may become non-centrosymmetric in the equilibrium configurations, as, for example, in the BNB molecule (see in &lt;ref name="Bersuker13"/&gt;). An interesting extension of such distortions in sufficiently long (infinite) linear chains was first considered by Peierls.&lt;ref&gt;R. E. Peierls "Quantum theory of solids", Oxford, Clarendon, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case the electronic states, combinations of atomic states, are in fact band states, and it was shown that if the chain is composed by atoms with unpaired electrons, the valence band is only half filled, and the PJTE interaction between the occupied and unoccupied band states leads to the doubling of the period of the linear chain (see also in the books &lt;ref name="BP89"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bersuker06"/&gt;).
 
'''Broken cylindrical symmetry'''. It was shown also that the PJTE not only produces the bending instability of linear molecules, but if the mixing electronic states involve a Δ state (a state with a nonzero momentum with respect to the axis of the molecule, its projection quantum number being Λ=2), the APES, simultaneously with the bending, becomes warped along the coordinate of rotations around the molecular axis, thus violating both the linear and cylindrical symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;W. Hermoso, Y. Liu, and I. B. Bersuker, "A Novel Effect Induced by Pseudo Jahn–Teller Interactions: Broken Cylindrical Symmetry in Linear Molecules", J. Chem. Theory Comput., 10, 4377 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; It happens because the PJTE, by mixing the wavefunctions of the two interacting states, transfers the high momentum of the electrons from states with Λ=2 to states with lower momentum, and this may alter significantly their expected rovibronic spectra.

=== Nonlinear molecules and two-dimensional (2D) systems===
'''PJTE and combined PJTE plus JTE effects in molecular structures'''. There is a practically unlimited number of molecular systems for which the origin of their structural properties was revealed and/or rationalized based on the PJTE, or a combination of the PJTE and JTE. The latter stems from the fact that in any system with a JTE in the ground state the presence of a PJT active excited state is not excluded, and vice versa, the active excited state for the PJTE of the ground one may be degenerate, and hence JT active. Examples are shown, e.g., in Refs.,&lt;ref name="Bersuker13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Englman72"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearson76"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BP89"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bersuker16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burdett80"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoffmann88"/&gt; including molecular systems like Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (X= H, F, Cl, Br), CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (with R as large ligands), planar cyclic C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, all kind of coordination systems of transition metals, mixed-valence compounds, biological systems, origin of conformations, geometry of ligands’ coordination, etc., etc. In fact it is difficult to find a molecular system for which the PJTE implications are a priori excluded, which is understandable in view of the mentioned above unique role of the PJTE in such instabilities.

'''Hidden PJTE, [[spin crossover]], and [[magnetic-dielectric bistability]]'''. As mentioned above, there are molecular systems in which the ground state in the high-symmetry configuration is neither degenerate to trigger the JTE, nor does it interact with the low-lying excited states to produce the PJTE (e.g., because of their different spin multiplicity). In these situations the instability is produced by a strong PJTE in the excited states; this is termed “hidden PJTE” in the sense that its origin is not seen explicitly as a PJTE in the ground state. An interesting typical situation of hidden PJTE emerges in molecular and solid state systems with valence half-filed closed shells electronic configurations e&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and t&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. For instance, in the e&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; case the ground state in the high-symmetry equilibrium geometry is an orbital non-degenerate triplet &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;A, while the nearby low-lying two excited electronic states are close-in-energy singlets &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;E and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A; due to the strong PJT interaction between the latter, the lower component of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;E crosses the triplet state to produce a global minimum with lower symmetry. Fig. 3 illustrates the hidden PJTE in the CuF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; molecule, showing also the singlet-triplet spin crossover and the resulting two coexisting configurations of the molecule: high-symmetry (undistorted) spin-triplet state with a nonzero magnetic moment, and a lower in energy dipolar-distorted singlet state with zero magnetic moment. Such [[magnetic-dielectric bistability]] is inherent to a whole class of molecular systems and solids.&lt;ref name="GB12"&gt;P. Garcia-Fernandez and I. B. Bersuker, Class of molecular and solid state systems with correlated magnetic and dielectric bistabilities induced by the pseudo Jahn–Teller effect, Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 246406 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Puckering in planar molecules and graphene-like 2D and quasi 2D systems'''. Special attention has been paid recently to two-dimensional (2D) systems in view of a variety of their planar-surface-specific physical and chemical properties and possible graphene-like applications in electronics. Similar-to-[[graphene]] properties are sought for in silicene, phosphorene, boron nitride, zinc oxide, gallium nitride, as well as in other attractive subjects like 2D transition metal dichalcogenids and oxides, and there is a number of other organic and inorganic 2D and quasi-2D compounds with expected similar properties. One of the main important features of these systems is their planarity or quasi-planarity, but many of the quasi-2D compounds are subject to out-of-plane deviations known as puckering (buckling). It was shown, as expected, that the instability and distortions of the planar configuration (as in any other systems in nondegenerate state) is due to the PJTE.&lt;ref name="Bersuker13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BP89"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bersuker06"/&gt; Detailed exploration of the PJTE in such systems allows one to reveal the excited states that are responsible for the puckering, and suggest possible external influence that restores their planarity, including oxidation, reduction, substitutions, or coordination to other species.&lt;ref name="Bersuker06"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I. B. Bersuker, The Jahn–Teller and pseudo Jahn–Teller effect in materials science, in Proc. 23th International conference on the Jahn–Teller effect, J. Phys. Conf. Series, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solid state and materials science ===
'''Cooperative PJTE in [[BaTiO3|BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]-type crystals and [[ferroelectricity]]'''. In crystals with PJTE centers the interaction between the local distortions may lead to their ordering to produce a phase transition to a regular crystal phase with lower symmetry. Such cooperative PJTE is quite similar to the cooperative JTE; it was shown in one of the first applications of the PJTE to solid state systems &lt;ref name="Bersuker66"/&gt; that in case of ABO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; crystals with perovskite structure the local dipolar PJTE distortions at the transition metal B center and their cooperative interactions leads to ferroelectric phase transitions. Provided the criterion of PJTE is obeyed, each [BO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] center has an APES with eight equivalent minima along the trigonal axes, six orthorhombic, and (higher) twelve tetragonal saddle-points between them. With temperature, the gradually reached transitions between the minima via the different kind of saddle-points explains the origin of all the four phases (three ferroelectric and one paraelectric) in perovskites of the type BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and their properties. The predicted by the theory trigonal displacement of the Ti ion in all four phases, the fully disordered PJTE distortions in the paraelectric phase, and their partially disordered state in two other phases was confirmed by a variety of experimental investigations (see in &lt;ref name="Bersuker13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bersuker66"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BP89"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bersuker06"/&gt;).

'''[[Multiferroicity]] and magnetic-ferroelectric crossover'''. The PJTE theory of [[ferroelectricity]] in ABO3 crystals was expanded to show that, dependent of the number of electrons in the d&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; shell of the transition metal ion B&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; and their low spin or high spin arrangement (which controls the symmetry and spin multiplicity of the ground and PJTE active excited states of the [BO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] center), their ferroelectricity may coexist with a magnetic moment ([[multiferroicity]]). Moreover, in combination with the temperature dependent spin crossover phenomenon (which changes the spin multiplicity), this kind of multiferroicity may lead to a novel effect of magnetic-ferroelectric crossover.&lt;ref&gt;I. B. Bersuker, Pseudo Jahn–Teller Origin of Perovskite Multiferroics, Magnetic-Ferroelectric Crossover, and Magnetoelectric Effects. The d&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;-d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; problem, Phys. Rev. Lett., 108, 137202 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Solid state magnetic-dielectric bistability'''. Similar to the mentioned above molecular bistability induced by the hidden PJTE, a magnetic-dielectric bistability due to two coexisting equilibrium configurations with corresponding properties may take place also in crystals with transition metal centers, subject to the electronic configuration with half-filled e&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or t&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; shells.&lt;ref name="GB12"/&gt; As in molecular systems, the latter produce a hidden PJTE and local bistability which, distinguished from the molecular case, are enhanced by the cooperative interactions, thus acquiring larger lifetimes. This crystal bistability was proved by calculations for LiCuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NaCuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; crystals, in which the Cu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ion has the electronic e&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(d&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;) configuration (similar to the CuF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; molecule).&lt;ref name="GB12"/&gt;
 
'''Giant enhancement of observable properties in interaction with external perturbations'''. In a recent development of the PJTE applications in materials science it was shown that in crystals with PJTE centers, in which the local distortion are not ordered (before the phase transition to the cooperative phases), the effect of interaction with external perturbations acquires an orientational contribution which enhances the observable properties by several orders of magnitude. This was demonstrated on the properties of crystals like paraelectric BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in interaction with electric fields (in [[permittivity]] and [[electrostriction]]), or under a strain gradient ([[flexoelectricity]]). These giant enhancement effects occur due to the dynamic nature of the PJTE local dipolar distortions (their tunneling between the equivalent minima); the independently rotating dipole moments on each center become oriented (frozen) along the external perturbation resulting in an orientational polarization which is not there in the absence of the PJTE&lt;ref&gt;I.

Lett. 107, 202904 (2015); Pseudo Jahn–Teller effect in the origin of enhanced flexoelectricity, Appl. Phys. Lett. 106, 022903 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''self-regulating heater''' is an electrical heater which strives to keep a constant temperature regardless of how the ambient conditions changes. It is the material in the heater itself that regulates the temperature. The heater requires no regulating electronics, temperature sensors, overheat protection etc. The temperature the heater will hold is decided when the material and the heater is produced. It can be fine tuned by changing the voltage to the heater. Self-regulating heaters are made from materials with strong [[Positive temperature coefficient]] (PTC) characteristics, i.e. the [[resistivity]] of the material increases rapidly with increasing temperature. Such materials include [[ceramic]] PTC stones.&lt;ref&gt;US Patent 4,822,980&lt;/ref&gt; and [[PTC rubber]].&lt;ref&gt;US patent 6,734,250&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ceramic type==
A ceramic PTC heater is made of small ceramic pieces pressed between two metal plates. The constraint compartment causes them to get a strong PTC effect. The typical temperature of ceramic stones is 140–250&amp;nbsp;°C (284–482&amp;nbsp;°F). Ceramic stones actually have [[Negative temperature coefficient]] (NTC) properties at low temperatures which makes them slow to heat up.

==Rubber type==
A rubber [[PTC heater]] is made from a special type of rubber which conducts electricity, but only up to a temperature which is defined at the production of the [[PTC rubber]]. Typical design temperatures are between 0–80&amp;nbsp;°C (32–176&amp;nbsp;°F). The resistivity of the rubber increases exponentially with temperature for all temperatures up to the design temperature. Hence, it has strong PTC properties for all temperatures and heats up rapidly. Above this temperature the rubber is an [[Insulator (electricity)|electrical isolator]] and cease to produce heat. This makes the heater self-limiting. The rubber foil is thin and flexible and can be formed to any shape and size.

==Operation==
When a voltage is applied to a [[PTC heater]] electrical current flows through the material and the [[resistivity]] of the material causes it to heat up (P(T)=U∧2÷R(T)). As it heats up the [[resistivity]] increases rapidly and the power (heat) produced decreases. At the same time heat is being transferred from the heater to the object it is attached to, and its surrounding. Eventually the amount of heat produced is in equilibrium with the amount of heat conducted and radiated away from the heater. The heater reaches its equilibrium temperature and remains there. The exponential PTC properties of the material assures that the equilibrium temperature is virtually insensitive to changes in the ambient temperatures.

In the 2001 book '''''The Unfinished Twentieth Century''''', author [[Jonathan Schell]] suggests that an essential feature of the twentieth century was the development of humankind's capacity for self-destruction, with the rise in many forms of "policies of extermination". Schell goes on to suggest that the world now faces a clear choice between the abolition of all [[nuclear weapons]], and full nuclearization, as the necessary technology and materials diffuse around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9907E6D61030F932A25752C1A9679C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|title=The Empire Strikes Back.

It was designed in response to requirements of the secret US government program code-named ''[[Lockheed CL-400 Suntan|Suntan]]'', which aimed to develop a high speed, high altitude hydrogen-powered military aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sloop|first1=John L|title=Liquid hydrogen as a propulsion fuel, 1945-1959|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4404/ch8-11.htm|website=NASA History Program|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|accessdate=April 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trailer was constructed by the Cambridge Corporation and had a capacity of 26,500 liters with a [[hydrogen]] loss rate of approximately 2 percent per day.  The U-1 was a single [[axle]] [[semi-trailer]]. The specifications for its successor the U-2 a double axle semi-trailer were issued on 15 March 1957.

==Ownership==
AkerBP is the operator of the field with 80% of interest in the project. AkerBP's partner DONG Energy holds 20% of interest.&lt;ref name=BP/&gt; DONG Energy increased its initial share of 5% to 20% by acquiring [[Svenska Petroleum Exploration AB|Svenska Petroleum]]'s complete share of 15% for US$130&amp;nbsp;million in 2008.&lt;ref name=Rigzone/&gt;

==Production==
Ula is located in approximately {{convert|70|m|ft|abbr=on}} of water. The main reservoir stands at {{convert|3345|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the Upper Jurassic Ula Formation.&lt;ref name=NPD/&gt; The field has three conventional steel facilities with production, drilling, living quarters. It has 7 production and 2 water injection wells. Current production at Ula field is 10,000 bbl/d. The existing gas process plant was recently extended with a new module, turbine and compressor and has been operative since 2008. The gas from [[Blane oil field|Blane]] field is injected into the Ula reservoir for production. The gas produced at Ula field is re-injected into the field for increased recovery as well. The field is expected to be abandoned in 2028.&lt;ref name=BP/&gt; The produced oil is then transported by a pipeline to [[Ekofisk oil field]] and on to [[Teesside]] for refining.&lt;ref name=NPD/&gt; In 2009, [[Aker Solutions]] was awarded a contract to tieback Ula field to [[Oselvar oil field|Oselvar field]].

'''Uranpyrochlore''' (ellsworthite) (Ca,U)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Ti,Nb,Ta)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(OH) is a rare earth mineral mostly found in the northern parts of North America. It is named after Hardy V. Ellsworth of the [[Canadian Geological Survey]] by Walker and Parsons.&lt;ref&gt;T. L. Walker and A. L. Parsons (1923) Ellsworthite and associated minerals from Hybla, Ontario. Contrib. Canad. Min., 1923, Univ. Toronto Stud., Geol. Ser., 16, 13-20&lt;/ref&gt; Ellsworthite is also known under the name {Betafite}. It is a very {{uranium}} and {{thorium}} rich mineral, which in fact makes it slightly radioactive. {{Uranium}} makes up about 17.1% of the mineral.&lt;ref name="Frondel"&gt;Frondel, J.W., Fleischer, M. (1950) A Glossary of Uranium-and Thorium-Bearing minerals. Geological Survey Circular 74, pg.11, http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.32106020887797;view=1up;seq=1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==

Ellsworthite is part of pyrochlore super group and the sub group betafite and was named after the Canadian Mineralogist and surveyor H. V. Ellsworth. Ellsworthite is also known as the mineral Betafite. Ellsworthite is a {{thorium}}- bearing mineral that is found mostly in Canada and Alaska. It was first discovered in Hybla, Ontario, which is now a ghost town.&lt;ref name="Frodel" /&gt; Minerals of the pyrochlore group present one of the most important modes of occurrence of trace elements (Nb,Ta) and were found in various geological (geochemical) environments. It is very important geochemically that the pyrochlore structure is very suitable for diverse isomorphic substitutions.&lt;ref&gt;Yaroshevski, A.A., Bagdasarev, Yu.A. (2007). Geothermal Diversity Of Minerals of the Pyrochlore Group.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==

Ellsworthite has complex hydrous oxides of {{niobium}}, {{tantalum}}, {{sodium}}, {{calcium}}, with hydroxyl and fluorine; it may contain as much as 17% {{uranium}}.&lt;ref name="bates"&gt;Bates, R.G., Wedow Jr, H. (1953). Preliminary summary review of Thorium- Bearing mineral occurrence in Alaska. Geological Survey bulletin 202&lt;/ref&gt; It is composed of calcium, uranium, titanium, niobium, tantalum, and oxygen. Ellsworthite is heavily abundant in uranium, niobium and titanium oxides.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt; It is very uranium, thorium, and water rich. One can consider Betafite as a hydrous uranium pyrochlore.&lt;ref&gt;Hogarth D.D. (1961) A study of Pyrochlore and Betafite, volume 6, issue 5. Canadian Mineralogist pg.610&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

The structure of Ellsworthite is cubic and has a point group of 4/m 3* 2/m. It is part of the isometric system and has the space group Fd3m. It forms into a Hexoctahedral with {110}, {100}, {113}, {233}, and {230}.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt; It has conchoidal fracture with no cleavage. Betafite is a synonym to Ellsworthite.

==Physical Properties==

Ellsworthite is mostly found in Canada and is amber yellow to dark brown in color. In most cases it has an amber rusty color and has a hardness of about 5.5. The luster is waxy or greasy to vitreous.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt; The outer, more altered parts are relatively high in water and low in uranium. Its streak is yellow to brownish.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt; The inner parts are brown, greenish brown, yellowish brown, or yellow. It is translucent to opaque &lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;

[[Image:Savanna_Army_Depot_Storage_Bunkers_1997.jpg|thumb|right|Typical WSA]]
'''Weapon storage areas (WSA)''', also known as '''special ammunition storage (SAS)''', were extremely well guarded and well defended locations where United States and [[NATO]] [[nuclear weapon]]s were stored during the [[Cold War]] era.

In most situations, the WSA or SAS areas were located inside the perimeter of an army barracks or an air base in NATO territory, but in a few cases they were located deep inside wooded areas and miles away from a [[military base]]. 

Due to changes in the political landscape, the number of special weapons in [[Europe]] has been drastically decreased. Moreover, the introduction of the [[WS3 Weapon Storage and Security System]] has made WSAs obsolete. 

At present, few WSAs are still operational as modern day special weapons are stored in the floors of concrete aircraft shelters and placed under 24/7 electronic surveillance.
