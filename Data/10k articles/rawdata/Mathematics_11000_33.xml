The '''Actuarial Society of South Africa HIV/AIDS models''', also known as '''ASSA AIDS models''', are a series of [[mathematical model]]s developed to assist the actuarial profession and the [[Actuarial Society of South Africa]] in assessing and addressing the impact of the [[AIDS|HIV and AIDS]] epidemic in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name=IMF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avert.org/south-africa-hiv-aids-statistics.htm South Africa HIV AIDS Statistics and Actuarial Society of South Africa HIV/AIDS Models]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actuarialsociety.co.za/default.aspx Actuarial Society of South Africa] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104031521/http://www.actuarialsociety.co.za/default.aspx |date=January 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The models have been developed by the [[AIDS|AIDS Committee]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/News-3139.htm AIDS Committee Publications till date] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701024530/http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/News-3139.htm |date=July 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Actuarial Society of South Africa|Society]] and the Center for Actuarial Research (CARe) at the [[University of Cape Town]] in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/Models-3145.htm ASSA AIDS Models] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313090613/http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/Models-3145.htm |date=March 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Models ==
In 1996 the first and earliest version of ASSA AIDS model ASSA500 was developed by the [[AIDS|AIDS Committee]] of the [[Actuarial Society of South Africa|society]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/2008-releases/researchers-estimate-lives-lost-delay-arv-drug-use-hivaids-south-africa.html Harvard School of Public Health Report on ASSA HIV AIDS Models ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/ASSA500-3163.htm ASSA500 the first model of AIDS Committee] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601041036/http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/ASSA500-3163.htm |date=June 1, 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image:Red Ribbon.svg|100px|thumb|A red ribbon use as logo of ASSA AIDS Committee]] While the ASSA2008 model is the most recent version of ASSA AIDS and demographic model which was released in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/ASSA2008-Model-3480.htm The ASSA2008 model the most recent model] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410192403/http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/ASSA2008-Model-3480.htm |date=April 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The models have assisted insurers and those insured to have fair and balanced insurance policies in a country ravaged by AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.actuarialsociety.org.za/Portals/1/Documents/fa4bedae-e09d-4ed6-a3aa-47f7a0369ff7.pdf{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cover.co.za/long-term-insurance/still-a-lot-of-life-in-life&lt;/ref&gt;

A joint task team of the South African National Department of Health and the Treasury used the ASSA model to estimate the impact of extending the life of AIDS patients.&lt;ref name=IMF&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=W_LcnKavtYgC&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=ASSA%20AIDS%20model&amp;pg=PA119#v=onepage&amp;q=ASSA%20AIDS%20model&amp;f=false|title= Post-Apartheid South Africa: The First Ten Years|accessdate=25 June 2012|author= Michael Nowak and Luca Antonio Ricci, eds|publisher= International Monetary Fund, 2006, p. 119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ASSA is one of only two models used in South Africa;&lt;ref name=IMF/&gt; both are capable of making projections on the progression of the epidemic through an interaction of many factors. Four population risk groups are included, along with assumptions about sexual behaviour, rates of infection, conception rates, the median duration to mortality of those with HIV/AIDS, and the rates of transmission between mother and child.&lt;ref name=IMF/&gt; The impact of drug treatments at birth and while nursing, enhanced STD treatment, and risk avoidance is projected by a lower rate scenario&lt;ref name=IMF/&gt; The model makes provisions for migration of the population, separate modeling of racial groups, and separate modeling of provincial populations.&lt;ref name=IMF/&gt;

A study by the South African National Department of Health and the Treasury used the ASSA model to project a positive result for the increased implementation of [[antiretroviral drug]]s (ARV) in the country,&lt;ref name=IMF/&gt; although their cost is a problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmg.org.za/report/20100504-public-hearings-provincial-departments-helath-under-spending-hospital Public Hearings with National Treasury, Department of Health on under-expenditure of Hospital Revitalisation, Comprehensive HIV and AIDS, and Forensic Pathology Grants]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Albert James Wohlstetter''' (December 19, 1913 – January 10, 1997) was an influential and controversial nuclear strategist during the [[Cold War]]. He and his wife [[Roberta Wohlstetter]], an accomplished historian and intelligence expert, received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] from [[Ronald Reagan]] on November 7, 1985.

==Ancestry==
Albert Wohlstetter's paternal grandparents were cosmopolitan Jews who immigrated to the United States from the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] in the latter half of the nineteenth century. Albert's father, Philip, was born in the United States about twenty years later.{{sfn|Charles Wohlstetter|1997|p=1}}

==Early life and education==
Albert was born on 19 December 1913, the fourth and youngest child of Philip Wohlstetter and Nellie (née Friedman). Albert's older siblings were William (1902–1967), Helene (1906–1974) and [[Charles Wohlstetter|Charles]] (1910–1995). Albert's brother Charles was an accomplished businessman who would help Albert get his start as a young man. Charles also employed Helene at one of his companies, [[ConTel]], where she was killed in a shooting by a disgruntled employee in 1974.{{sfn|Zarate|2009|p=66}}

The Wohlstetters lived in the [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] neighborhood of Manhattan. Philip Wohlstetter had attended City College of New York was an attorney and the Chief Legal Council to the [[Metropolitan Opera|Metropolitan Opera Company]]. In 1912, he founded one of the early phonograph companies, the [[Rex Records (1912)|Rex Talking Machine Corporation]]. Luminaries of the performance world were regular guests in the Wohlstetter home. The Rex company was taken over and its Wilmington, Delaware factory converted to war production during the First World War. Philip died of a heart attack in 1918 when Albert was four years old.{{sfn|Charles Wohlstetter|1997|p=2}}

===City College of New York===
Wohlstetter started at [[City College of New York]] in 1931 through a scholarship in modern dance, earning a B.A. in 1934.

===Columbia University===
Wohlstetter started at [[Columbia Law School]] on a fellowship in 1934. It was in a class there that he met Roberta Morgan. Wohlstetter was bored by the law and left the program after only one year. But he stayed at Columbia to pursue a Ph.D. in [[mathematical logic]] and the [[philosophy of science]]. He studies under [[Abraham Wald]] where he was a peer of [[Jacob Wolfowitz]].{{sfn|Richardson|2009|p=98}} After a thesis titled ''Language and Empiricism'' earned him an M.A. in June 1937, several fellowships allowed him to work on is dissertation. He had a fellowship with the [[Social Science Research Council]] on a project to incorporate modern mathematical methods into economics and [[business cycle]] research. From 1941–1942 he was a research associate at the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]].{{sfn|Zarate|2009|p=8}}

In August 1942 the Wohlstetters vacationed with [[Dwight Macdonald]], one of the editors of ''[[Partisan Review]]'', and his wife, Nancy in Nantucket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wreszin |first=Michael |date=1994 |title=A Rebel In Defense of Tradition: The Life and Politics of Dwight Macdonald |location=New York |publisher=HarperCollins |page=113 |isbn=0-465-01739-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He left Columbia's graduate program when the Second World War started to work for the U.S. government on war planning and never completed his doctorate.

==Early career==
During the Second World War, Wohlstetter worked on problems of war production. He was first hired by the Planning Committee of the [[War Production Board]]. It is unclear how he ended up there. In an interview, Wohlstetter says that while on the Carnegie associateship with NBER, [[Simon Kuznets]] was hired by [[Robert R. Nathan]] and it was Kuznets who hired Wohlstetter.{{sfn|Wohlstetter|30 January 1986|p=1}} Albert's brother Charles recounts that it was [[Arthur F. Burns]] who gave Albert the job.{{sfn|Charles Wohlstetter|1997|p=116}}

Later he worked at [[Atlas Aircraft Products Company]].

After the war, Wohlstetter worked briefly in business in New York.{{sfn|Kaplan|1983|p=96}} He moved back to Washington, D.C. to serve as the Director of Programs for the [[United States Housing Authority|National Housing Agency]] (USHA) in 1946 and 1947, the only time in his career he was a federal employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mukherjee|Jacobs|Porfirenko|Bulatoff|2001|p=3}}; {{harvnb|Zarate|2009|p=66}}; {{harvnb|Herken|1985|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the USHA Wohlstetter worked with [[Paul Weidlinger]], an engineer who had worked during the war for an aircraft company owned by Albert's brother, Charles, designing modular buildings such as airplane hangers that could be assembled quickly. At the USHA Wohlstetter and Weidlinger worked on applying such principles to domestic residential buildings.{{sfn|Kaplan|1983|p=96}}

During the 1937–1938 school year, Roberta had worked as a teaching assistant at the [[University of Southern California]], during which time she became enamored with the California lifestyle.{{sfn|Robin|2016|pp=47, 49}} At her urging, and with his brother Charles helping to secure a job for Albert, the Wohlstetters moved to Santa Monica in 1947. Albert went to work for the [[General Panel Corporation]] to "tool up" their industrial plant. General Panel Corporation was a company founded by [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Konrad Wachsmann]], two important figures in the [[Bauhaus]] movement.{{sfn|Wohlstetter|29 July 1987|p=2}}

==The RAND Corporation==
While on a walk, Albert and Roberta ran into [[Meyer Abraham Girschick|Abe Girschick]], [[Olaf Helmer]] and [[J.C.C. McKinsey|Chen McKinsey]] on the street in Santa Monica. Albert knew the three from his days as a student and in government service.{{sfn|Kaplan|1983|p=97}} The three mathematicians "... were overjoyed to see us. Mathematical logic was a very, very small world. There were only a little over a dozen mathematical logicians before the war in the United States ..."{{sfn|Wohlstetter|29 July 1987|pp=1–2}} Girschick, Helmer and McKinsey were working at the recently formed [[RAND Corporation]]. With their help, [[Hans Speier]], the head of the RAND social science division, hired Roberta, initially to write book abstracts for circulation to the RAND staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robin|2016|pp=50–53}}; {{harvnb|Abella|2008|pp=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; When General Panel Corporation finally went out of business in 1951, Albert wanted to return to academia in the east, but Roberta was intent on remaining in California.{{sfn|Robin|2016|pp=50–51}} She set up a meeting between Albert and [[Charles J. Hitch]], the head of the RAND economics department. The two hit it off and Wohlstetter was brought on as a consultant to the Mathematics Department.{{sfn|Zarate|2009|p=9}}

Wohlstetter remained a consultant with RAND for the first few years. It was not until June or July 1953, a few months after he began briefing ''Selection and Use of Strategic Air Bases'' to the Air Force that Hitch finally insisted that his consultant status was "absurd" and that he join the permanent staff.{{sfn|Wohlstetter|29 July 1987|p=4}}

At RAND, he researched how to posture and operate U.S. strategic nuclear forces to deter plausible forms of Soviet nuclear-armed aggression in way that was credible, cost-effective and controllable.&lt;ref&gt;See Albert Wohlstetter, et al., [https://www.rand.org/pubs/reports/R0266/ ''Selection and the Use of Strategic Air Bases''], a report prepared for United States Air Force Project RAND, R-266 (Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation, April 1954); Wohlstetter, et al., [http://www.albertwohlstetter.com/writings/R290''Protecting U.S. Power to Strike Back in the 1950s and 1960s''], staff report, R-290 (Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation, September 1, 1956); and Wohlstetter, [http://www.albertwohlstetter.com/writings/DBOT "The Delicate Balance of Terror,"] ''Foreign Affairs'', Vol. 37, No. 2 (January 1959), pp. 211-234.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wohlstetter's 1958 'The Delicate Balance of Terror' was highly influential in shaping the thinking of the Washington foreign policy establishment, particularly in its emphasis on the looming threat of Soviet attack.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Bacevich, 'Tailors to the Emperor', New Left Review 69, May–June 2011, p. 108 [http://www.newleftreview.org/?page=article&amp;view=2901]&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between Bernard Brodie and Wohlstetter grew increasingly acrimonious and personal. In 1963, Brodie accused Wohlstetter of a security violation and financial malfeasance. Wohlstetter had shared a draft RAND paper by [[Constantin Melnik]] with Henry Rowen, then one of the [[Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|Whiz Kids]] working as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs at McNamara's Pentagon. Brodie also claimed that Wohlstetter was extravagant in wining and dining clients and colleagues using RAND funds. Wohlstetter defended himself by pointing out that the Melnik paper was only a "D" designated document, RAND's lowest level classification, and as a former RAND employee who had collaborated extensively with Wohlstetter on some of his most important studies, Rowen was authorized to receive the paper. Nevertheless, RAND Director [[Frank Collbohm]] demanded that Wohlstetter submit his resignation. When Wohlstetter refused, Collbohm fired him, but agreed to let Wohlstetter stay on at RAND long enough to find another job.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robin|2016|p=97}}; {{harvnb|Abella|2008|pp=196–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Independent consultant==
At the suggestion of [[Hans Morgenthau]] and with his help, Wohlstetter secured a position as a professor of political science at the University of Chicago.{{sfn|Zarate|2009|p=31}}

In the 1960s and 1970s, he expanded the scope of his research to include alliance policy and nuclear nonproliferation,&lt;ref&gt;See Albert Wohlstetter, [http://www.albertwohlstetter.com/writings/NuclearSharing "Nuclear Sharing: NATO and the N+1 Country,"] Foreign Affairs, Vol. 39, No. 3 (April 1961), pp. 355-387.&lt;/ref&gt; ballistic missile defense,&lt;ref&gt;See Albert Wohlstetter, "The Case for Strategic Force Defense," in Johan Jørgen Holst and William Schneider, Jr., eds., ''Why ABM? Policy Issues in the Missile Defense Controversy'' (New York, NY: Pergamon Press, 1969), pp. 119-142.&lt;/ref&gt; innovation in military technology,&lt;ref&gt;See D. A. Paolucci, [http://www.albertwohlstetter.com/writings/LRRDPP ''Summary Report of the Long Range Research and Development Planning Program (LRRDPP)''], DRAFT, February 7, 1975, declassified on December 31, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; peacetime military competitions,&lt;ref&gt;See Albert Wohlstetter, "Racing Forward? Or Ambling Back?," in Robert Conquest, ed., ''Defending America'' (New York, NY: Basic Books, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt; and military potential and economics of civil nuclear energy.&lt;ref&gt;See Albert Wohlstetter, et al., [http://www.albertwohlstetter.com/writings/NuclearArmedCrowd ''Moving Toward Life in a Nuclear Armed Crowd?''], final report prepared for the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in fulfillment of ACDA/PAB-263, PH76-04-389-14 (Los Angeles, CA: PAN Heuristics, December 4, 1975 [revised April 22, 1976]); and Wohlstetter, et al., ''Swords from Plowshares: The Military Potential of Civilian Nuclear Energy'' (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, Wohlstetter frequently criticized proponents of [[mutual assured destruction]] who supported targeting of nuclear weapons on civilians and cities instead over enemy combatants and military forces.&lt;ref&gt;See Albert Wohlstetter, "Bishops, Statesmen, and Other Strategists on the Bombing of Innocents," ''Commentary'', Vol. 75, No. 6 (June 1983), pp. 15-35; Wohlstetter, "Between an Unfree World and None: Increasing Our Choices," Foreign Affairs, Vol. 63, No. 5 (Summer 1985), pp. 962-994; and Wohlstetter, "Swords Without Shields," ''The National Interest'', No. 9 (Summer 1987), pp. 31-57.  In 2003, [http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article2978.htm two French journalists] writing for ''[[Le Monde]]'' (Paris) tried to summarize Wohlstetter's ideas on nuclear strategy. They wrote that Wohlstetter:  &lt;blockquote&gt;was at the origin of the rethinking of the traditional doctrine known as '[[mutual assured destruction]]' (MAD, in its [[English language|English]] acronym), which was the basis for nuclear deterrence.  According to this theory, two blocs capable of inflicting upon each other irreparable damages would cause leaders to hesitate to unleash the nuclear fire. For Wohlstetter and his pupils, MAD was both immoral -- because of the destruction inflicted on civilian populations -- and ineffective: it led to the mutual neutralization of nuclear arsenals. No statesman endowed with reason, and in any case no American president, would decide on 'reciprocal suicide.' Wohlstetter proposed on the contrary a 'graduated deterrence,' i.e. the acceptance of limited wars, possibly using tactical nuclear arms, together with 'smart' precision-guided weapons capable of hitting the enemy's military apparatus. He criticized the politics of [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|nuclear arms limitations]] conducted together with [[Moscow]]. It amounted, according to him, to constraining the technological creativity of the [[United States]] in order to maintain an artificial equilibrium with the [[USSR]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Wohlstetter and his wife, [[Roberta Wohlstetter]], also counseled both Democratic and Republican administrations, including advisers to President [[John F. Kennedy]] during the [[Cuban missile crisis]] in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;On February 25, 1963, the Wohlstetters published "Studies for a Post-Communist Cuba."  See Albert and Roberta Wohlstetter, Studies for a Post-Communist Cuba, D(L)-11060-ISA (Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation, February 25. 1963).&lt;/ref&gt;  They received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] from [[Ronald Reagan]] on November 7, 1985.

During his long career, Wohlstetter also taught at [[UCLA]] and the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in the early 1960s. From 1964 to 1980, he taught in the political science department of the [[University of Chicago]], and chaired the dissertation committees of [[Paul Wolfowitz]] and [[Zalmay Khalilzad]].  He is often credited with influencing a number of prominent members of the [[neoconservative]] movement,&lt;ref&gt;See Craig Unger, ''The Fall of the House of the Bush'', London: Pocket Books, 2008, p. 42. "Thanks in large part to Wohlstetter, to his methodology, his demeanor, his political know-how, proto-neocons learned how to turn their ideas into political action."&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Richard Perle]] (who, as a teenager, dated Wohlstetter's daughter Joan).&lt;ref&gt;Unger, 2008, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;  He is the uncle of John Wohlstetter, author of ''Sleepwalking with the Bomb'' and ''The Long War Ahead and The Short War Upon Us''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discoveryinstitutepress.com/the-long-war-ahead/reviews.php |title=Reviews: Praise for The Long War Ahead |accessdate=2014-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504225701/http://www.discoveryinstitutepress.com/the-long-war-ahead/reviews.php |archivedate=2014-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On 16 December 1996, his 83rd birthday, Wohlstetter was not feeling well. He and Roberta thought he was just ill or having an asthma attack. Over the telephone from New York their daughter Joan reviewed the symptoms for a heart attack and told Roberta to call an ambulance. Albert made a fuss, not wanting to go to the emergency room. At the hospital he was diagnosed as having had a serious heart attack and was discharged home with around-the-clock nursing care. In the living room he set up a makeshift chair  that allowed him to partially recline so he could continue to work. A month later, on 10 January 1997, Wohlstetter died at his [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles|Laurel Canyon]] home.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abella|2008|pp=301–302}}; {{harvnb|Pace|14 January 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A memorial was held at the office of the RAND Corporation{{sfn|Abella|2008|p=302}} and a month later Senator [[Jon Kyl]] and special guest Richard Perle conducted a brief remembrance in the Senate chamber.{{sfn|Kyl|Perle|6 February 1997}} Albert Wohlstetter is buried at [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]] in Los Angeles. Roberta Wolstetter died on 6 January 2007.

==Awards==

He was twice awarded the [[Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service]], first by [[Robert McNamara]] in February 1965 and again by [[Donald Rumsfeld]] in November 1976. He is the first recipient not employed by the Department of Defense and the first person awarded it twice.{{sfn|Marshall|Martin|Rowen|1991|p=320}}

On 7 November 1985 President Reagan awarded Albert Wohlstetter, along with his wife Roberta Wohlstetter and Paul Nitze, the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]].

==Legacy==
The ''[http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt1489q8rg/ Albert J. and Roberta Wohlstetter Papers]'' are available at the Hoover Institution Archives at Stanford University.

==In popular culture==
Wohlstetter served as an inspiration for Stanley Kubrick's film, ''[[Dr. Strangelove|Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]''. In 1962, Kubrick was looking for his next project after ''Lolita'' and started reading intensively on nuclear issues. One of Kubrick's early ideas was to make a realistic thriller, titled after Wohlstetter's "Delicate Balance of Terror". But Kubrick could not conceive of a realistic scenario for an accidental nuclear war, so turned instead to the idea of making a comedy. While the character of Dr. Stragelove is a composite of numerous people associated with RAND (Dr. Strangelove confesses to the president having commissioned a study by "the Bland Corporation" of the possibility of a doomsday device) in the movie that was made, he is mostly based on [[Herman Kahn]], [[John von Neumann]], [[Wernher von Braun]] and [[Edward Teller]].{{sfn|Menand|27 June 2005}}

'''Algorithmic information theory''' is a subfield of [[information theory]] and [[computer science]] that concerns itself with the relationship between [[theory of computation|computation]] and [[Information#Measuring information|information]]. According to [[Gregory Chaitin]], it is "the result of putting [[Claude Shannon|Shannon]]'s information theory and [[Alan Turing|Turing]]'s computability theory into a cocktail shaker and shaking vigorously."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/research/groups/CDMTCS/docs/ait.php Algorithmic Information Theory&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Algorithmic information theory principally studies [[asymptotic complexity|complexity]] measures on [[string (computer science)|string]]s (or other [[data structure]]s).  Because most mathematical objects can be described in terms of strings, or as the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of a [[sequence]] of strings, it can be used to study a wide variety of mathematical objects, including [[integer]]s.

The theory was founded by [[Ray Solomonoff]],&lt;ref name=Vitanyi/&gt; who published the basic ideas on which the field is based as part of his invention of [[algorithmic probability]]—a way to overcome serious problems associated with the application of [[Bayes' rule]]s in statistics. He first described his results at a Conference at [[Caltech]] in 1960,&lt;ref name=Caltech1960/&gt; and in a report, February 1960, "A Preliminary Report on a General Theory of Inductive Inference."&lt;ref name=v131/&gt;

Algorithmic information theory was later developed independently by [[Andrey Kolmogorov]], in 1965 and [[Gregory Chaitin]], around 1966. There are several variants of Kolmogorov complexity or algorithmic information; the most widely used one is based on self-delimiting programs and is mainly due to [[Leonid Levin]] (1974).

[[Per Martin-Löf]] also contributed significantly to the information theory of infinite sequences. An axiomatic approach to algorithmic information theory based on the [[Blum axioms]] (Blum 1967) was introduced by Mark Burgin in a paper presented for publication by Andrey Kolmogorov (Burgin 1982). The axiomatic approach encompasses other formulations.

== Overview ==
Algorithmic information theory principally studies [[asymptotic complexity|complexity]] measures on [[string (computer science)|string]]s (or other [[data structure]]s).  Because most mathematical objects can be described in terms of strings, or as the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of a [[sequence]] of strings, it can be used to study a wide variety of mathematical objects, including [[integer]]s.

Informally, from the point of view of algorithmic information theory, the information content of a string is equivalent to the length of the most-[[data compression|compressed]] possible self-contained representation of that string. A self-contained representation is essentially a [[program (computing)|program]]—in some fixed but otherwise irrelevant universal [[programming language]]—that, when run, outputs the original string.

From this point of view, a 3000-page encyclopedia actually contains less information than 3000 pages of completely random letters, despite the fact that the encyclopedia is much more useful. This is because to reconstruct the entire sequence of random letters, one must know, more or less, what every single letter is. On the other hand, if every vowel were removed from the encyclopedia, someone with reasonable knowledge of the English language could reconstruct it, just as one could likely reconstruct the sentence "Ths sntnc hs lw nfrmtn cntnt" from the context and consonants present.

Unlike classical information theory, algorithmic information theory gives [[Formal system|formal]], [[Rigour#Mathematical rigour|rigorous]] definitions of a [[Kolmogorov complexity|random string]] and a [[algorithmically random sequence|random infinite sequence]] that do not depend on physical or philosophical [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]]s about [[wikt:nondeterminism|nondeterminism]] or [[likelihood]]. (The set of random strings depends on the choice of the [[universal Turing machine]] used to define [[Kolmogorov complexity]], but any choice
gives identical asymptotic results because the Kolmogorov complexity of a string is invariant up to an additive constant depending only on the choice of universal Turing machine. For this reason the set of random infinite sequences is independent of the choice of universal machine.)

Some of the results of algorithmic information theory, such as [[Kolmogorov complexity#Chaitin's incompleteness theorem|Chaitin's incompleteness theorem]], appear to challenge common mathematical and philosophical intuitions. Most notable among these is the construction of [[Chaitin's constant]] '''Ω''', a real number which expresses the probability that a self-delimiting universal Turing machine will [[halting problem|halt]] when its input is supplied by flips of a fair coin (sometimes thought of as the probability that a random computer program will eventually halt). Although '''Ω''' is easily defined, in any [[consistent]] [[axiom]]atizable [[theory (mathematical logic)|theory]] one can only compute finitely many digits of '''Ω''', so it is in some sense ''unknowable'', providing an absolute limit on knowledge that is reminiscent of [[Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem]]. Although the digits of '''Ω''' cannot be determined, many properties of '''Ω''' are known; for example, it is an [[algorithmically random sequence]] and thus its binary digits are evenly distributed (in fact it is [[normal number|normal]]).

== History ==
Algorithmic information theory was founded by [[Ray Solomonoff]],&lt;ref name=Vitanyi&gt;Vitanyi, P. "[http://homepages.cwi.nl/~paulv/obituary.html Obituary: Ray Solomonoff, Founding Father of Algorithmic Information Theory"]&lt;/ref&gt; who published the basic ideas on which the field is based as part of his invention of [[algorithmic probability]]—a way to overcome serious problems associated with the application of [[Bayes' rule]]s in statistics.  He first described his results at a Conference at [[Caltech]] in 1960,&lt;ref name=Caltech1960&gt;Paper from conference on "Cerebral Systems and Computers", California Institute of Technology, February 8–11, 1960, cited in "A Formal Theory of Inductive Inference, Part 1, 1964, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and in a report, February 1960, "A Preliminary Report on a General Theory of Inductive Inference."&lt;ref name=v131&gt;Solomonoff, R., "[http://world.std.com/~rjs/z138.pdf A Preliminary Report on a General Theory of Inductive Inference]", Report V-131, Zator Co., Cambridge, Ma., (November Revision of February 4, 1960 report.)&lt;/ref&gt;  Algorithmic information theory was later developed independently by [[Andrey Kolmogorov]], in 1965 and [[Gregory Chaitin]], around 1966.

There are several variants of Kolmogorov complexity or algorithmic information; the most widely used one is based on [[self-delimiting program]]s and is mainly due to [[Leonid Levin]] (1974). [[Per Martin-Löf]] also contributed significantly to the information theory of infinite sequences. An axiomatic approach to algorithmic information theory based on the [[Blum axioms]] (Blum 1967) was introduced by Mark Burgin in a paper presented for publication by [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] (Burgin 1982). The axiomatic approach encompasses other approaches in the algorithmic information theory. It is possible to treat different measures of algorithmic information as particular cases of axiomatically defined measures of algorithmic information. Instead of proving similar theorems, such as the basic invariance theorem, for each particular measure, it is possible to easily deduce all such results from one corresponding theorem proved in the axiomatic setting. This is a general advantage of the axiomatic approach in mathematics. The axiomatic approach to algorithmic information theory was further developed in the book (Burgin 2005) and applied to software metrics (Burgin and Debnath, 2003; Debnath and Burgin, 2003).

== Precise definitions ==
{{Main|Kolmogorov complexity}}
A binary string is said to be random if the [[Kolmogorov complexity]] of the string is at least the length of the string. A simple counting argument shows that some strings of any given length are random, and almost all strings are very close to being random. Since Kolmogorov complexity depends on a fixed choice of universal Turing machine (informally, a fixed "description language" in which the "descriptions" are given), the collection of random strings does depend on the choice of fixed universal machine. Nevertheless, the collection of random strings, as a whole, has similar properties regardless of the fixed machine, so one can (and often does) talk about the properties of random strings as a group without having to first specify a universal machine.

{{Main|Algorithmically random sequence}}
An infinite binary sequence is said to be random if, for some constant ''c'', for all ''n'', the [[Kolmogorov complexity]] of the initial segment of length ''n'' of the sequence is at least ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''c''. It can be shown that almost every sequence (from the point of view of the standard [[measure (mathematics)|measure]]—"fair coin" or [[Lebesgue measure]]—on the space of infinite binary sequences) is random. Also, since it can be shown that the Kolmogorov complexity relative to two different universal machines differs by at most a constant, the collection of random infinite sequences does not depend on the choice of universal machine (in contrast to finite strings). This definition of randomness is usually called ''Martin-Löf'' randomness, after [[Per Martin-Löf]], to distinguish it from other similar notions of randomness. It is also sometimes called ''1-randomness'' to distinguish it from other stronger notions of randomness (2-randomness, 3-randomness, etc.). In addition to Martin-Löf randomness concepts, there are also recursive randomness, Schnorr randomness, and Kurtz randomness etc. [[Yongge Wang]] showed &lt;ref&gt;Yongge Wang: Randomness and Complexity. PhD Thesis, 1996. http://webpages.uncc.edu/yonwang/papers/thesis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; that all of these randomness concepts are different.

(Related definitions can be made for alphabets other than the set &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;.)

== Specific sequence ==
Algorithmic information theory (AIT) is the information theory of individual objects, using computer science, and concerns itself with the relationship between computation, information, and randomness.

The information content or complexity of an object can be measured by the length of its shortest description. For instance the string

&lt;code&gt;"0101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101"&lt;/code&gt;

has the short description "32 repetitions of '01'", while

&lt;code&gt;"1100100001100001110111101110110011111010010000100101011110010110"&lt;/code&gt;

presumably has no simple description other than writing down the string itself.

More formally, the Algorithmic Complexity (AC) of a string x is defined as the length of the shortest program that computes or outputs x, where the program is run on some fixed reference universal computer.

A closely related notion is the probability that a universal computer outputs some string x when fed with a program chosen at random. This Algorithmic "Solomonoff" Probability (AP) is key in addressing the old philosophical problem of induction in a formal way.

The major drawback of AC and AP are their incomputability. Time-bounded "Levin" complexity penalizes a slow program by adding the logarithm of its running time to its length. This leads to computable variants of AC and AP, and Universal "Levin" Search (US) solves all inversion problems in optimal time (apart from some unrealistically large multiplicative constant).

AC and AP also allow a formal and rigorous definition of randomness of individual strings to not depend on physical or philosophical intuitions about non-determinism or likelihood. Roughly, a string is Algorithmic "Martin-Löf" Random (AR) if it is incompressible in the sense that its algorithmic complexity is equal to its length.

AC, AP, and AR are the core sub-disciplines of AIT, but AIT spawns into many other areas. It serves as the foundation of the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, can simplify proofs in computational complexity theory, has been used to define a universal similarity metric between objects, solves the Maxwell daemon problem, and many others.

'''Archytas''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑr|k|ɪ|t|ə|s}}; {{lang-el|Ἀρχύτας}}; 428–347 BC) was an [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[philosopher]], [[mathematician]], [[astronomer]], [[wikt:statesman|statesman]], and [[military strategy|strategist]]. He was a scientist of the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] school and famous for being the reputed founder of mathematical mechanics, as well as a good friend of [[Plato]].

==Life and work==
Archytas was born in [[Taranto|Tarentum]], [[Magna Graecia]] and was the son of Mnesagoras or Histiaeus. For a while, he was taught by [[Philolaus]], and was a teacher of mathematics to [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]]. Archytas and Eudoxus' student was [[Menaechmus]]. As a Pythagorean, Archytas believed that only arithmetic, not geometry, could provide a basis for satisfactory proofs.&lt;ref&gt;Morris Kline, Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times Oxford University Press, 1972 p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Archytas is believed to be the founder of mathematical [[mechanics]].&lt;ref name="diogenes laertius"&gt;{{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 83}}: ''Vitae philosophorum''&lt;/ref&gt; As only described in the writings of [[Aulus Gellius]] five centuries after him, he was reputed to have designed and built the first artificial, self-propelled flying device, a bird-shaped model propelled by a jet of what was probably steam, said to have actually flown some 200 meters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aulus Gellius]], "Attic Nights", Book X, 12.9 at [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Gellius/10*.html LacusCurtius]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmth.edu.gr/en/aet/1/14.html ARCHYTAS OF TARENTUM, Technology Museum of Thessaloniki, Macedonia, Greece] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226181400/http://www.tmth.edu.gr/en/aet/1/14.html |date=December 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This machine, which its inventor called ''The pigeon'', may have been suspended on a wire or pivot for its flight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressconnects.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070104/NEWS02/701040323/1006/ Modern rocketry]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://automata.co.uk/History%20page.htm |title=Automata history |access-date=2018-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021205014113/http://www.automata.co.uk/History%20page.htm |archive-date=2002-12-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Archytas also wrote some lost works, as he was included by [[Vitruvius]] in the list of the twelve authors of works of mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vitruvius]], ''De architectura'', vii.14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thomas Winter has suggested that the pseudo-Aristotelian ''[[Mechanics (Aristotle)|Mechanical Problems]]'' is an important mechanical work by Archytas, not lost after all, but misattributed.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Nelson Winter, "[http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/classicsfacpub/68/  The Mechanical Problems in the Corpus of Aristotle]," DigitalCommons@University of Nebraska - Lincoln, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archytas named the [[harmonic mean]], important much later in [[projective geometry]] and [[number theory]], though he did not invent it.&lt;ref&gt;J. J. O'Connor and E. F. Robertson. [http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Archytas.html Archytas of Tarentum]. The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive. Visited 11 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Eutocius]], Archytas solved the problem of [[doubling the cube]] in his manner (though he believed "that only arithmetic, not geometry", could provide a basis for satisfactory proofs) with a geometric construction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eutocius]], commentary on [[Archimedes]]' ''On the sphere and cylinder''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hippocrates of Chios]] before, reduced this problem to finding mean [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportionals]]. Archytas' theory of proportions is treated in book VIII of [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', where is the construction for two proportional means, equivalent to the extraction of the [[cube root]]. According to [[Diogenes Laertius]], this demonstration, which uses lines generated by moving figures to construct the two proportionals between magnitudes, was the first in which geometry was studied with concepts of mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]] blamed Archytas for his contamination of geometry with mechanics ([[Plutarch]], [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/p/plutarch/symposiacs/chapter8.html#section80 ''Symposiacs'', Book VIII, Question 2]): ''And therefore Plato himself dislikes Eudoxus, Archytas, and Menaechmus for endeavoring to bring down the doubling the cube to mechanical operations; for by this means all that was good in geometry would be lost and corrupted, it falling back again to sensible things, and not rising upward and considering immaterial and immortal images, in which God being versed is always God.''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Archytas#Archytas curve|Archytas curve]], which he used in his solution of the doubling the cube problem, is named after him.

Politically and militarily, Archytas appears to have been the dominant figure in Tarentum in his generation, somewhat comparable to [[Pericles]] in [[Athens]] a half-century earlier. The Tarentines elected him ''[[strategos]]'', 'general', seven years in a row – a step that required them to violate their own rule against successive appointments. He was allegedly undefeated as a general, in Tarentine campaigns against their southern Italian neighbors. The ''[[Seventh Letter (Plato)|Seventh Letter]]'' of [[Plato]] asserts that Archytas attempted to rescue Plato during his difficulties with [[Dionysius the Younger|Dionysius II]] of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]. In his public career, Archytas had a reputation for virtue as well as efficacy. Some scholars have argued that Archytas may have served as one model for Plato's [[philosopher king]], and that he influenced Plato's political philosophy as expressed in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' and other works (i.e., how does a society obtain good rulers like Archytas, instead of bad ones like Dionysius II?).

Archytas may have drowned in a shipwreck in the shore of [[Mattinata]], where his body lay unburied on the shore until a sailor humanely cast a handful of sand on it. Otherwise, he would have had to wander on this side of the [[Styx (mythology)|Styx]] for a hundred years, such the virtue of a little dust, ''munera pulveris'', as [[Horace]] calls it in Ode 1.28 on which this information on his death is based. The poem, however, is difficult to interpret and it is not certain that the shipwrecked and Archytas are in fact the same person.

The crater [[Archytas (crater)|Archytas]] on the [[Moon]] is named in his honour.

===Archytas curve&lt;!--'Archytas curve' redirects here--&gt;===
[[File:Archytas curve.png|thumb|The Archytas curve]]
The '''Archytas curve''' is created by placing a semicircle (with a diameter of d) on the diameter of one of the two circles of a cylinder (which also has a diameter of d) such that the plane of the semicircle is at right angles to the plane of the circle and then rotating the semicircle about one of its ends in the plane of the cylinder's diameter. This rotation will cut out a portion of the cylinder forming the Archytas curve.&lt;ref&gt;http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/davies/cubedbl.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way of thinking of this construction is that the Archytas curve is basically the result of cutting out a torus formed by rotating a hemisphere of diameter d out of a cylinder also of diameter d. A cone can go through the same procedures also producing the Archytas curve. Archytas used his curve to determine the construction of a cube with a volume of one third of that of a given cube.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23808">'''Arithmetic Fuchsian groups''' are a special class of [[Fuchsian group]]s constructed using [[Order (ring theory)|order]]s in [[quaternion algebra]]s. They are particular instances of [[arithmetic group]]s. The prototypical example of an arithmetic Fuchsian group is the [[modular group]] &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{PSL}_2(\Z )&lt;/math&gt;. They, and the [[hyperbolic manifold|hyperbolic surface]] associated to their action on the [[hyperbolic plane]] often exhibit particularly regular behaviour among Fuchsian groups and hyperbolic surfaces.

== Definition and examples ==

=== Quaternion algebras ===
{{Main article| Quaternion algebra}}

A quaternion algebra over a field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a four-dimensional [[Central simple algebra|central simple]] &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-algebra. A quaternion algebra has a basis &lt;math&gt;1, i, j, ij&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;i^2, j^2 \in F^\times&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;ij = -ji&lt;/math&gt;.

A quaternion algebra is said to be split over &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; if it is isomorphic as an &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-algebra to the algebra of matrices &lt;math&gt;M_2(F)&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is an embedding of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; into a field &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; we shall denote by &lt;math&gt;A \otimes_\sigma E&lt;/math&gt; the algebra obtained by [[Extension of scalars|extending scalars]] from &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; where we view &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; as a subfield of &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; via &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Arithmetic Fuchsian groups ===

A subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PSL}_2(\R)&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''derived from a quaternion algebra'' if it can be obtained through the following construction. Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be a [[totally real number field]] and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; a quaternion algebra over &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the following conditions. First there is a unique embedding &lt;math&gt;\sigma: F \hookrightarrow \R&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A \otimes_\sigma \R&lt;/math&gt; is split over &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt; ; we denote by &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; such an isomorphism. We also ask that for all other embeddings &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; the algebra &lt;math&gt;A \otimes_\tau \R&lt;/math&gt; is not split (this is equivalent to it being isomorphic to the [[Hamilton quaternions]]). Next we need an order &lt;math&gt;\mathcal O&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal O^1&lt;/math&gt; be the group of elements in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal O&lt;/math&gt; of reduced norm 1 and let &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; be its image in &lt;math&gt;M_2(\R )&lt;/math&gt; via &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. Then the image of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2(\R )&lt;/math&gt; (since the reduced norm of a matrix algebra is just the determinant) and we can consider the Fuchsian group which is its image in &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PSL}_2(\R)&lt;/math&gt;.

The main fact about these groups is that they are discrete subgroups and they have finite covolume for the [[Haar measure]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PSL}_2(\R).&lt;/math&gt; Moreover, the construction above yields a cocompact subgroup if and only if the algebra &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is not split over &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. The discreteness is a rather immediate consequence of the fact that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is only split at one real embedding. The finiteness of covolume is harder to prove.{{sfn|Katok|1992}}

An ''arithmetic Fuchsian group'' is any subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PSL}_2(\R)&lt;/math&gt; which is [[commensurability (group theory)|commensurable]] to a group derived from a quaternion algebra. It follows immediately from this definition that arithmetic Fuchsian groups are discrete and of finite covolume (this means that they are [[Lattice (discrete subgroup)|mattices]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PSL}_2(\R)&lt;/math&gt;).

=== Examples ===

The simplest example of an arithmetic Fuchsian group is the modular &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PSL}_2(\Z),&lt;/math&gt; which is obtained by the construction above with &lt;math&gt;A = M_2(\Q)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal O = M_2(\Z).&lt;/math&gt; By taking [[Eichler order]]s in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; we obtain subgroups &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_0(N)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;N \geqslant 2&lt;/math&gt; of finite index in &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PSL}_2(\Z)&lt;/math&gt; which can be explicitly written as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; \Gamma_0(N) = \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d \end{pmatrix} \in \mathrm{PSL}_2(\Z) :  c = 0 \pmod N \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Of course the arithmeticity of such subgroups follows from the fact that they are finite-index in the arithmetic group &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PSL}_2(\Z )&lt;/math&gt; ; they belong to a more general class of finite-index subgroups, congruence subgroups.

Any order in a quaternion algebra over &lt;math&gt;\Q&lt;/math&gt; which is not split over &lt;math&gt;\Q&lt;/math&gt; but splits over &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt; yields a cocompact arithmetic Fuchsian group. There is a plentiful supply of such algebras.{{sfn|Katok|1992|loc=section 5.6}}

More generally, all orders in quaternion algebras (satisfying the above conditions) which are not &lt;math&gt;M_2(\Q)&lt;/math&gt; yield cocompact subgroups. A further example of particular interest is obtained by taking &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to be the [[Hurwitz quaternion]]s.

=== Maximal subgroups ===

A natural question is to identify those among arithmetic Fuchsian groups which are not strictly contained in a larger discrete subgroup. These are called ''maximal'' Kleinian groups and it is possible to give a complete classification in a given arithmetic commensurability class. Note that a theorem of Margulis implies that a lattice in &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PSL}_2(\Complex)&lt;/math&gt; is arithmetic if and only if it is commensurable to infinitely many maximal Kleinian groups.

=== Congruence subgroups ===

A ''principal congruence subgroup'' of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma = \mathrm{SL}_2(\Z)&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of the form :

:&lt;math&gt; \Gamma(N) =  \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d \end{pmatrix} \in \mathrm{PSL}_2(\Z) : a,d = 1 \pmod N, \, b,c = 0 \pmod N  \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

for some &lt;math&gt;N \geqslant 1.&lt;/math&gt; These are finite-index normal subgroups and the quotient &lt;math&gt;\Gamma/\Gamma(N)&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to the finite group &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2(\Z /N\Z).&lt;/math&gt; A ''congruence subgroup'' of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is by definition a subgroup which contains a principal cingruence subgroup (these are the groups which are defined by taking the matrices in &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; which satisfy certain congruences modulo an integer, hence the name).

Notably, not all finite-index subgroups of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2(\Z)&lt;/math&gt; are congruence subgroups. A nice way to see this is to observe that &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2(\Z)&lt;/math&gt; has subgroups which surject onto the [[alternating group]] &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; for arbitrary &lt;math&gt;n,&lt;/math&gt; and since for large &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; the group &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; is not a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2(\Z/N \Z)&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; these subgroups cannot be congruence subgroups. In fact one can also see that there are many more non-congruence than congruence subgroups in &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2(\Z)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lubotzky |first1=Alexander |last2=Segal |first2=Dan  |date=2003 |title=Subgroup growth |chapter= Chapter 7 |publisher=Birkhäuser}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of a congruence subgroup generalizes to cocompact arithmetic Fuchsian groups and the results above also hold in this general setting.

=== Construction via quadratic forms ===

There is an isomorphism between &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PSL}_2(\R)&lt;/math&gt; and the connected component of the [[orthogonal group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SO}(2,1)&lt;/math&gt; given by the action of the former by conjugation on the space of matrices of trace zero, on which the determinant induces the structure of a real [[quadratic space]] of signature (2,1). Arithmetic Fuchsian groups can be constructed directly in the latter group by taking the integral points in the orthogonal group associated to quadratic forms defined over number fields (and satisfying certain conditions).

In this correspondence the modular group is associated up to commensurability to the group &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SO}(2,1)(\Z).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lamington.wordpress.com/2014/05/17/a-tale-of-two-arithmetic-lattices/ |title=A tale of two arithmetic lattices |last=Calegari |first=Danny | date=May 17, 2014 |access-date=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arithmetic Kleinian groups ===
{{Main article | Arithmetic hyperbolic 3-manifold}}

The construction above can be adapted to obtain subgroups in &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PSL}_2(\Complex)&lt;/math&gt;: instead of asking for &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; to be totally real and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to be split at exactly one real embedding one asks for &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; to have exactly one complex embedding up to complex conjugacy, at which &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is automatically split, and that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is not split at any embedding &lt;math&gt;F \hookrightarrow \R&lt;/math&gt;. The subgroups of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PSL}_2(\Complex)&lt;/math&gt; commensurable to those obtained by this construction are called ''arithmetic Kleinian groups''. As in the Fuchsian case arithmetic Kleinian groups are discrete subgroups of finite covolume.

== Trace fields of arithmetic Fuchsian groups ==

The invariant [[trace field]] of a Fuchsian group (or, through the monodromy image of the fundamental group, of an hyperbolic surface) is the field generated by the traces of the squares of its elements. In the case of an arithmetic surface whose fundamental group is commensurable with a Fuchsian group derived from a quaternion algebra over a number field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; the invariant trace field equals &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.

One can in fact characterise arithmetic manifolds through the traces of the elements of their fundamental group, a result known as Takeuchi's criterion.{{sfn|Katok|1992|loc=Chapter 5}} A Fuchsian group is an arithmetic group if and only if the following three conditions are realised:
*Its invariant trace field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a totally real number field; 
*The traces of its elements are [[algebraic integer]]s; 
*There is an embedding &lt;math&gt;\sigma: F \to \R&lt;/math&gt; such that for any &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; in the group, &lt;math&gt;t=\mathrm{Trace}(\gamma^2)&lt;/math&gt; and any other embedding &lt;math&gt;\sigma \neq \sigma': F \to \R&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;|\sigma'(t)| \leqslant 2&lt;/math&gt;.

== Geometry of arithmetic hyperbolic surfaces ==

The Lie group &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PSL}_2(\R)&lt;/math&gt; is the group of positive isometries of the hyperbolic plane &lt;math&gt;\mathbb H^2&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, if &lt;math&gt; \Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a discrete subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PSL}_2(\R)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; acts [[Properly discontinuous action|properly discontinuously]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb H^2&lt;/math&gt;. If moreover &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is [[Torsion (algebra)|torsion-free]] then the action is [[Group action#free|free]] and the quotient space &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \setminus \mathbb H^2&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Surface (mathematics)|surface]] (a 2-manifold) with an [[hyperbolic manifold|hyperbolic metric]] (a Riemannian metric of constant sectional curvature −1). If &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is an arithmetic Fuchsian group such a surface &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is called an ''arithmetic hyperbolic surface'' (not to be confused with the [[arithmetic surface]]s from arithmetic geometry; however when the context is clear the "hyperbolic" specifier may be omitted). Since arithmetic Fuchsian groups are of finite covolume, arithmetic hyperbolic surfaces always have finite Riemannian volume (i.e. the integral over &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of the [[Volume form#Riemannian volume form|volume form]] is finite).

=== Volume formula and finiteness ===

It is possible to give a formula for the volume of distinguished arithmetic surfaces from the arithmetic data with which it was constructed. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal O&lt;/math&gt; be a maximal order in the quaternion algebra &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of [[Quaternion algebra#Quaternion algebras over the rational numbers|discriminant]] &lt;math&gt;D_A&lt;/math&gt; over the field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;r = [F : \Q]&lt;/math&gt; be its degree, &lt;math&gt;D_F&lt;/math&gt; its [[Discriminant of a number field|discriminant]] and &lt;math&gt;\zeta_F&lt;/math&gt; its [[Dedekind zeta function]]. Let &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{\mathcal O}&lt;/math&gt; be the arithmetic group obtained from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal O&lt;/math&gt; by the procedure above and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; the [[orbifold]] &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_O \setminus \mathbb H^2&lt;/math&gt;. Its volume is computed by the formula&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Borel | first=Armand |title=Commensurability classes and volumes of hyperbolic 3-manifolds| journal=Ann. Scuola Norm. Sup.Pisa Cl. Sci.| volume= 8 | year=1981| pages=1–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{vol}(S) =  \frac {2 |D_F|^{\frac 3 2} \cdot \zeta_F(2)} {(2\pi)^{2r - 2}} \cdot \prod_{\mathfrak p \mid D_A} (N(\mathfrak p) - 1) ;&lt;/math&gt;

the product is taken over [[prime ideal]]s of &lt;math&gt;O_F&lt;/math&gt; dividing &lt;math&gt;(D_A)&lt;/math&gt; and we recall the &lt;math&gt;N(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Field norm#Further properties|norm]] function on ideals, i.e. &lt;math&gt;N(\mathfrak p)&lt;/math&gt; is the cardinality of the finite ring &lt;math&gt;O_F /\mathfrak p&lt;/math&gt;). The reader can check that if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal O = M_2(\Z)&lt;/math&gt; the output of this formula recovers the well-known result that the hyperbolic volume of the modular surface equals &lt;math&gt;\pi/3&lt;/math&gt;.

Coupled with the description of maximal subgroups and finiteness results for number fields this formula allows to prove the following statement:

:''Given any &lt;math&gt;V &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; there are only finitely many arithmetic surfaces whose volume is less than &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.''

Note that in dimensions four and more Wang's finiteness theorem (a consequence of [[local rigidity]]) asserts that this statement remains true by replacing "arithmetic" by "finite volume". An asymptotic equivalent for the number if arithmetic manifolds of a certain volume was given by Belolipetsky—Gelander—Lubotzky—Mozes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Belolipetsky |first1=Misha |last2=Gelander |first2=Tsachik| last3=Lubotzky| first3=Alexander |last4=Shalev| first4=Aner |title=Counting arithmetic lattices and surfaces| journal=Ann. of Math. | year=2010|volume=172 |pages=2197–2221 | doi=10.4007/annals.2010.172.2197|arxiv=0811.2482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Minimal volume ===
{{Main article | Hurwitz surface}}

The hyperbolic orbifold of minimal volume can be obtained as the surface associated to a particular order, the [[Hurwitz quaternion order]], and it is compact of volume &lt;math&gt;\pi/21&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Closed geodesics and injectivity radii ===

A [[closed geodesic]] on a Riemannian manifold is a [[closed curve]] that is also [[geodesic]]. One can give an effective description of the set of such curves in an arithmetic surface or three—manifold: they correspond to certain units in certain quadratic extensions of the base field (the description is lengthy and shall not be given in full here). For example, the length of primitive closed geodesics in the modular surface corresponds to the absolute value of units of norm one in real quadratic fields. This description was used by Sarnak to establish a conjecture of Gauss on the mean order of [[class group]]s of real quadratic fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Sarnak| first= Peter| title= Class numbers of indefinite binary quadratic forms| journal= J. Number Theory| volume=15 |year=1982| pages= 229–247 | doi=10.1016/0022-314x(82)90028-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arithmetic surfaces can be used&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Katz |first=M. |last2=Schaps |first2=M. |last3=Vishne |first3=U. |title= Logarithmic growth of systole of arithmetic Riemann surfaces along congruence subgroups |journal=J.

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{sys}(S) \geqslant \frac{4}{3} \log g.&lt;/math&gt;

== Spectra of arithmetic hyperbolic surfaces ==

=== Laplace eigenvalues and eigenfunctions ===
{{Main article | Spectral geometry}}

If &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is an hyperbolic surface then there is a distinguished operator &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; on [[smooth function]]s on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. In the case where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is compact it extends to an [[Unbounded operator|unbounded]], [[Unbounded operator#Extensions of symmetric operators|essentially self-adjoint]] operator on the Hilbert space &lt;math&gt;L^2(S)&lt;/math&gt; of [[square-integrable function]]s on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. The [[Spectral theorem for the Laplace--Beltrami operator|spectral theorem]] in Riemannian geometry states that there exists an [[Hilbert space#orthonormal basis|orthonormal basis]] &lt;math&gt;\phi_0, \phi_1, \ldots, \phi_n, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; of [[eigenfunction]]s for &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;. The associated [[eigenvalue]]s &lt;math&gt;\lambda_0 = 0 &lt; \lambda_1 \leqslant \lambda_2 \leqslant \cdots&lt;/math&gt; are unbounded and their asymptotic behaviour is ruled by [[Weyl's law]].

In the case where &lt;math&gt;S = \Gamma \setminus \mathbb H^2&lt;/math&gt; is arithmetic these eigenfunctions are a special type of [[automorphic form]]s for &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; called [[Maass form]]s. The eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; are of interest for number theorists, as well as the distribution and [[???|nodal set]]s of the &lt;math&gt;\phi_n&lt;/math&gt;.

The case where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is of finte volume is more complicated but a similar theory can be established via the notion of [[cusp form]].

=== Selberg conjecture ===
{{Main article | Selberg's 1/4 conjecture}}

The ''spectral gap'' of the surface &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is by definition the gap between the smallest eigenvalue &lt;math&gt;\lambda_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt; and the second smallest eigenvalue &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;; thus its value equals &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1&lt;/math&gt; and we shall denote it by &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1(S).&lt;/math&gt; In general it can be made arbitrarily small(ref Randol) (however it has a positive lower bound for a surface with fixed volume). The Selberg conjecture is the following statement providing a conjectural uniform lower bound in the arithmetic case:

:''If &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \subset \mathrm{PSL}_2(\R)&lt;/math&gt; is lattice which is derived from a quaternion algebra and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma'&lt;/math&gt; is a torsion-free congruence subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma,&lt;/math&gt; then for &lt;math&gt;S = \Gamma' \setminus \mathbb H^2&lt;/math&gt; we have'' &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1(S) \geqslant \tfrac{1}{4}.&lt;/math&gt; 

Note that the statement is only valid for a subclass of arithmetic surfaces and can be seen to be false for general subgroups of finite index in lattices derived from quaternion algebras. Selberg's original statement&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Selberg | first1=Atle | editor1-last=Whiteman | editor1-first=Albert Leon | title=Theory of Numbers | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6xAZAQAAIAAJ | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | location=Providence, R.I. | series=Proceedings of Symposia in Pure Mathematics | isbn=978-0-8218-1408-6  | mr=0182610 | year=1965 | volume=VIII | chapter=On the estimation of Fourier coefficients of modular forms | pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; was made only for congruence covers of the modular surface and it has been verified for some small groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last= Roelcke |first=W. | title=Über die Wellengleichung bei Grenzkreisgruppen erster Art| journal=S.-B.

Kl. 1953/1955 |pages= 159–267 | language=german}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selberg himself has proven the lower bound &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 \geqslant \tfrac{1}{16},&lt;/math&gt; a result known as "Selberg's 1/16 theorem". The best known result in full generality is due to Luo—Rudnick—Sarnak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Kim | first1=H.

Amer. Math. Soc. |volume = 16 | year = 2003 | pages=139–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The uniformity of the spectral gap has implications for the construction of [[expander graph]]s as Schreier graphs of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2(\Z).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lubotzky |first=Alexander |title=Discrete groups, expanding graphs and invariant measures |publisher=Birkhäuser | date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relations with geometry ===
{{Main article | Selberg's trace formula }}
{{Main article | Cheeger constant}}

Selberg's trace formula shows that for an hyperbolic surface of finite volume it is equivalent to know the length spectrum (the collection of lengths of all closed geodesics on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, with multiplicities) and the spectrum of &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;. However the precise relation is not explicit.

Another relation between spectrum and geometry is given by [[Cheeger constant#Cheeger's inequality|Cheeger's inequality]], which in the case of a surface &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; states roughly that a positive lower bound on the spectral gap of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; translates into a positive lower bound for the total length of a collection of smooth closed curves separating &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; into two connected components.

=== Quantum ergodicity ===
{{Main article | Quantum ergodicity }}

The [[quantum ergodicity]] theorem of Shnirelman, Colin de Verdière and Zelditch states that on average, eigenfunctions equidistribute on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. The unique quantum ergodicity conjecture of Rudnick and Sarnak asks whether the stronger statement that individual eigenfunctions equidistribure is true. Formally, the statement is as follows.

:''Let  &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be an arithmetic surface and &lt;math&gt;\phi_j&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of functions on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; such that'' 
::&lt;math&gt;\Delta\phi_j = \lambda_j\phi_j, \qquad \int_S \phi_j(x)^2 \,dx = 1.&lt;/math&gt;
:''Then for any smooth, compactly supported function &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; we have''
::&lt;math&gt; \lim_{j\to \infty} \left( \int_S \psi(x) \phi_j(x)^2 \,dx \right) = \int_S \psi(x)\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

This conjecture has been proven by E. Lindenstrauss&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |last= Lindenstrauss | first=Elon |title=Invariant measures and arithmetic quantum unique ergodicity |journal= Ann. of Math.| volume=163 | date=2006 | pages=165–219 | doi=10.4007/annals.2006.163.165}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the case where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is compact and the &lt;math&gt;\phi_j&lt;/math&gt; are additionally eigenfunctions for the [[Hecke operator]]s on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. In the case of congruence covers of the modular some additional difficulties occur, which were dealt with by K. Soundararajan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Soundararajan | first=Kannan |title=Quantum unique ergodicity for &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2(\Z) \setminus \mathcal H&lt;/math&gt;| journal=Ann. of Math. | volume=172 |date=2010 |pages= 1529–1538 |doi=10.4007/annals.2010.172.1529 |mr= 2680500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Isospectral surfaces ===
{{Main article | Isospectral}}

The fact that for arithmetic surfaces the arithmetic data determines the spectrum of the Laplace operator &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; was pointed out by M. F. Vignéras&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Vignéras | first=Marie-France | title=Variétés riemanniennes isospectrales et non isométriques | language=French | journal=Ann. of Math. | volume=112 | date=1980 | pages=21–32 | doi=10.2307/1971319}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used by her to construct examples of isospectral compact hyperbolic surfaces. The precise statement is as follows:

:''If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a quaternion algebra, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal O_1, \mathcal O_2&lt;/math&gt; are maximal orders in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and the associated Fuchsian groups &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_1,\Gamma_2&lt;/math&gt; are torsion-free then the hyperbolic surfaces &lt;math&gt;S_i = \Gamma_i \setminus \mathbb H^2&lt;/math&gt; have the same Laplace spectrum. ''

Vignéras then constructed explicit instances for &lt;math&gt;A, \mathcal O_1, \mathcal O_2&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the conditions above and such that in addition &lt;math&gt;\mathcal O_2&lt;/math&gt; is not conjugated by an element of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal O_2.&lt;/math&gt; The resulting isospectral hyperbolic surfaces are then not isometric.

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{ dy }{ dt } = g(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;

has no nonconstant [[periodic solution]]s lying entirely within the region.&lt;ref name=Burton2005&gt;{{cite book|last=Burton|first=Theodore Allen|title=Volterra Integral and Differential Equations|year=2005|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780444517869|page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Almost everywhere" means everywhere except possibly in a set of [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] 0, such as a point or line.

The theorem was first established by Swedish mathematician [[Ivar Bendixson]] in 1901 and further refined by French mathematician [[Henri Dulac]] in 1933 using [[Green's theorem]].

==Proof==
Without loss of generality, let there exist a function &lt;math&gt; \varphi(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac { \partial (\varphi f) }{ \partial x } +\frac { \partial (\varphi g) }{ \partial y } &gt;0&lt;/math&gt;

in simply connected region &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; be a closed trajectory of the plane autonomous system in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; be the interior of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. Then by [[Green's theorem]],

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \iint_D \left( \frac { \partial (\varphi f) }{ \partial x } +\frac { \partial (\varphi g) }{ \partial y }  \right) \,dx\,dy =\oint_C \left( -\varphi g\,dx+\varphi f\,dy \right) \\[6pt]
= {} &amp; \oint_C \varphi \left( -\dot { y } \,dx+\dot { x } \,dy \right).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

But on &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;dx=\dot { x } \,dt&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;dy=\dot { y } \,dt&lt;/math&gt;, so the integral evaluates to&amp;nbsp;0. This is a contradiction, so there can be no such closed trajectory &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13872">The '''biological half-life''' of a biological substance is the time it takes for half to be removed by biological processes when the rate of removal is roughly exponential.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Biological Half Life|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/B00658.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often denoted by the abbreviation &lt;math&gt;t_{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;. Examples include [[metabolite]]s, [[drug]]s, and [[signalling molecule]]s. Typically, this refers to the body's cleansing through the function of kidneys and liver in addition to excretion functions to eliminate a substance from the body. In a medical context, half-life may also describe the time it takes for the [[blood plasma]] concentration of a substance to halve (''plasma half-life'') its steady-state. The relationship between the biological and plasma half-lives of a substance can be complex depending on the substance in question, due to factors including accumulation in tissues ([[Plasma protein binding|protein binding]]), active metabolites, and receptor interactions.&lt;ref name="SCM"&gt;{{cite book|title=Spinal Cord Medicine|author1=Lin VW|author2=Cardenas DD|publisher=Demos Medical Publishing, LLC|page=251|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3anl3G4No_oC&amp;pg=PA251&amp;lpg=PA251|year=2003|isbn=1-888799-61-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

=== Water ===
The biological half-life of water in a human is about 7 to 14 [[day]]s. It can be altered by behavior. Drinking large amounts of [[alcohol]] will reduce the biological half-life of water in the body.&lt;ref name="isbn0-12-369413-2"&gt;{{cite book | author = Nordberg, Gunnar | title = Handbook on the toxicology of metals | edition = | publisher = Elsevier | location = Amsterdam | year = 2007 | pages =119 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = | isbn = 0-12-369413-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-521-84228-X"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Silk, Kenneth R. |author2=Tyrer, Peter J. | title = Cambridge textbook of effective treatments in psychiatry | edition = | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK | year = 2008 | pages = 295 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = | isbn = 0-521-84228-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been used to decontaminate humans who are internally contaminated with [[tritiated water]] ([[tritium]]). The basis of this decontamination method (used at [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment|Harwell]]){{cn|date=June 2017}} is to increase the rate at which the water in the body is replaced with new water.

=== Alcohol ===
The removal of [[ethanol]] (drinking alcohol) through oxidation by [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] in the [[liver]] from the human body is limited. Hence the removal of a large concentration of alcohol from [[blood]] may follow [[Rate equation#Zero order|zero-order kinetics]]. Also the rate-limiting steps for one substance may be in common with other substances. For instance, the blood alcohol concentration can be used to modify the biochemistry of [[methanol]] and [[ethylene glycol]]. In this way the oxidation of methanol to the [[toxic]] [[formaldehyde]] and [[formic acid]] in the human body can be prevented by giving an appropriate amount of [[ethanol]] to a person who has [[eating|ingested]] methanol. Note that methanol is very toxic and causes [[blindness]] and death. A person who has ingested [[ethylene glycol]] can be treated in the same way. Half life is also relative to the subjective metabolic rate of the individual in question.

=== Metals ===
The biological half-life of [[caesium]] in humans is between one and four months. This can be shortened by feeding the person [[prussian blue]]. The prussian blue in the digestive system acts as a solid [[ion exchange]]r which absorbs the caesium while releasing [[potassium]] ions.

For some substances, it is important to think of the human or animal body as being made up of several parts, each with their own affinity for the substance, and each part with a different biological half-life ([[physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modelling]]). Attempts to remove a substance from the whole organism may have the effect of increasing the burden present in one part of the organism. For instance, if a person who is contaminated with lead is given [[EDTA]] in a [[chelation therapy]], then while the rate at which lead is lost from the body will be increased, the lead within the body tends to relocate into the [[brain]] where it can do the most harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lead toxicity update.

=== Peripheral half-life ===
Some substances may have different half-lives in different parts of the body. For example, [[oxytocin]] has a [[half-life]] of typically about three minutes in the blood when given [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]]. Peripherally administered (e.g. intravenous) peptides like oxytocin cross the [[blood-brain-barrier]] very poorly, although very small amounts (&lt; 1%) do appear to enter the [[central nervous system]] in humans when given via this route.&lt;ref name="BaribeauAnagnostou2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baribeau |first1=Danielle A |last2=Anagnostou |first2=Evdokia |title=Oxytocin and vasopressin: linking pituitary neuropeptides and their receptors to social neurocircuits |journal=Frontiers in Neuroscience |volume=9 |year=2015 |issn=1662-453X |doi=10.3389/fnins.2015.00335 |pmid=26441508 |pmc=4585313}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to peripheral administration, when administered [[intranasal administration|intranasally]] via a nasal spray, oxytocin reliably crosses the [[blood–brain barrier]] and exhibits [[psychoactive]] effects in humans.&lt;ref name="Oxy BBB"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE |veditors=Sydor A, Brown RY |title=Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience |year=2009 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical |location=New York |isbn=9780071481274 |page=195 |edition=2nd |chapter=Chapter 7: Neuropeptides |quote=Oxytocin can be delivered to humans via nasal spray following which it crosses the blood–brain barrier.&amp;nbsp;...

{{Main|Rate equation}}

===First-order elimination===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Sodium thiopental]] --&gt;
Half-times apply to processes where the elimination rate is exponential. If &lt;math&gt;C(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the concentration of a substance at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, its time dependence is given by
:&lt;math&gt;C(t) = C(0) e^{-kt} \,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''k'' is the [[reaction rate constant]]. Such a decay rate arises from a [[Rate equation#First order|first-order reaction]] where the rate of elimination is proportional to the amount of the substance:&lt;ref name=Bonate&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bonate|first1=Peter L.|last2=Howard|first2=Danny R.|title=Clinical study design and analysis|date=2004|publisher=AAPS Press|location=Arlington, VA|isbn=9780971176744|pages=237&amp;ndash;239}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d C}{d t} = -k C.&lt;/math&gt;

The half-life for this process is&lt;ref name=Bonate/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t_\frac{1}{2} = \frac{\ln 2}{k}. \,&lt;/math&gt;

Half-life is determined by [[Clearance (medicine)|clearance]] (CL) and [[volume of distribution]] (V&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;) and the relationship is described by the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;t_\frac{1}{2} = \frac{{\ln 2}\cdot{V_D}}{CL} \,&lt;/math&gt;

In clinical practice, this means that it takes 4 to 5 times the half-life for a drug's serum concentration to reach steady state after regular dosing is started, stopped, or the dose changed.  So, for example, digoxin has a half-life (or t&lt;sub&gt;½&lt;/sub&gt;) of 24–36 h; this means that a change in the dose will take the best part of a week to take full effect. For this reason, drugs with a long half-life (e.g., [[amiodarone]], elimination t&lt;sub&gt;½&lt;/sub&gt; of about 58 days) are usually started with a [[loading dose]] to achieve their desired clinical effect more quickly.

===Biphasic half-life===
Many drugs follow a biphasic elimination curve — first a steep slope then a shallow slope:
:STEEP (initial) part of curve —&gt; initial distribution of the drug in the body.
:SHALLOW part of curve —&gt; ultimate excretion of drug, which is dependent on the release of the drug from tissue compartments into the blood. 
The longer half-life is called the ''terminal half-life'' and the half-life of the largest component is called the ''dominant half-life.''&lt;ref name=Bonate/&gt; For a more detailed description see [[Pharmacokinetics#Multi-compartmental models|Pharmacokinetics--Multi-compartmental_models]].

[[File:Circle-withsegments.svg|thumb|200px|right|Circle illustration with circumference (C) in black, diameter (D) in blue
, radius (R) in red, and centre or origin (O) in magenta.]]
In [[geometry]], a '''centre''' (or '''center''') (from [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] ''κέντρον'') of an object is a point in some sense in the middle of the object. According to the specific definition of centre taken into consideration, an object might have no centre. If geometry is regarded as the study of [[isometry group]]s then a centre is a fixed point of all the isometries which move the object onto itself.

==Circles, spheres, and segments==
The centre of a [[circle]] is the point [[equidistant]] from the points on the edge. Similarly the centre of a [[sphere]] is the point equidistant from the points on the surface, and the centre of a line segment is the [[midpoint]] of the two ends.

==Symmetric objects==
For objects with several [[symmetries]], the [[center of symmetry|centre of symmetry]] is the point left unchanged by the symmetric actions. So the centre of a [[square (geometry)|square]], [[rectangle]], [[rhombus]] or [[parallelogram]] is where the diagonals intersect, this being (amongst other properties) the fixed point of rotational symmetries. Similarly the centre of an [[ellipse]] or a [[hyperbola]] is where the axes intersect.

==Triangles==

{{Main|Triangle centre}}

Several special points of a triangle are often described as [[triangle center|triangle centres]]:

*the [[circumcentre]], which is the centre of the circle that passes through all three [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]];
*the [[centroid]] or [[centre of mass]], the point on which the triangle would balance if it had uniform density;
*the [[incentre]], the centre of the circle that is internally tangent to all three sides of the triangle;
*the [[orthocentre]], the intersection of the triangle's three [[altitude (geometry)|altitudes]]; and
*the [[nine-point centre]], the centre of the circle that passes through nine key points of the triangle.

For an [[equilateral triangle]], these are the same point, which lies at the intersection of the three axes of symmetry of the triangle, one third of the distance from its base to its apex.

A strict definition of a triangle centre is a point whose [[trilinear coordinate]]s are ''f''(''a'',''b'',''c'') : ''f''(''b'',''c'',''a'') : ''f''(''c'',''a'',''b'') where ''f'' is a function of the lengths of the three sides of the triangle, ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' such that:

# ''f'' is homogeneous in ''a'', ''b'', ''c''; i.e., ''f''(''ta'',''tb'',''tc'')=''t''&lt;sup&gt;''h''&lt;/sup&gt;''f''(''a'',''b'',''c'') for some real power ''h''; thus the position of a centre is independent of scale.
# ''f'' is symmetric in its last two arguments; i.e., ''f''(''a'',''b'',''c'')= ''f''(''a'',''c'',''b''); thus position of a centre in a mirror-image triangle is the mirror-image of its position in the original triangle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/tcenters/roads.html Algebraic Highways in Triangle Geometry] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119140931/http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/tcenters/roads.html |date=January 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This strict definition excludes pairs of bicentric points such as the [[Brocard point]]s (which are interchanged by a mirror-image reflection). The [[Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers]] lists over 9,000 different triangle centres.

==Tangential polygons and cyclic polygons==

A [[tangential polygon]] has each of its sides [[tangent]] to a particular circle, called the [[incircle]] or inscribed circle. The centre of the incircle, called the incentre, can be considered a centre of the polygon.

A [[cyclic polygon]] has each of its vertices on a particular circle, called the [[circumcircle]] or circumscribed circle. The centre of the circumcircle, called the circumcentre, can be considered a centre of the polygon.

If a polygon is both tangential and cyclic, it is called [[bicentric polygon|bicentric]]. (All triangles are bicentric, for example.) The incentre and circumcentre of a bicentric polygon are not in general the same point.

==General polygons==
{{See also|Quadrilateral#Remarkable points and lines in a convex quadrilateral}}

The centre of a general [[polygon]] can be defined in several different ways. The "vertex centroid" comes from considering the polygon as being empty but having equal masses at its vertices. The "side centroid" comes from considering the sides to have constant mass per unit length. The usual centre, called just the [[centroid]] (centre of area) comes from considering the surface of the polygon as having constant density. These three points are in general not all the same point.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7638">In [[differential geometry]] and [[theoretical physics]], the '''classification of electromagnetic fields''' is a [[pointwise]] classification of [[bivector]]s at each point of a [[Pseudo-Riemannian manifold#Lorentzian manifold|Lorentzian manifold]]. It is used in the study of solutions of [[Maxwell's equations]] and has applications in Einstein's [[theory of relativity]].

==The classification theorem==

The electromagnetic field at a point ''p'' (i.e. an event) of a Lorentzian spacetime is represented by a [[Real number|real]] bivector {{nowrap|1=''F'' = ''F''&lt;sup&gt;''ab''&lt;/sup&gt;}} defined over the tangent space at ''p''.

The tangent space at ''p'' is isometric as a real inner product space to E&lt;sup&gt;1,3&lt;/sup&gt;.  That is, it has the same notion of vector [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] and [[angle]] as [[Minkowski spacetime]]. To simplify the notation, we will assume the spacetime ''is'' Minkowski spacetime. This tends to blur the distinction between the tangent space at ''p'' and the underlying manifold; fortunately, nothing is lost by this specialization, for reasons we discuss as the end of the article.

The classification theorem for electromagnetic fields characterizes the bivector ''F'' in relation to the Lorentzian metric {{nowrap|1=''η'' = ''η''&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt;}} by defining and examining the so-called "principal null directions". Let us explain this.

The bivector ''F''&lt;sup&gt;''ab''&lt;/sup&gt; yields a [[Skew-symmetric matrix#Coordinate-free|skew-symmetric]] [[linear operator]] {{nowrap|1=''F''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''F''&lt;sup&gt;ac&lt;/sup&gt;''η''&lt;sub&gt;''cb''&lt;/sub&gt;}} defined by lowering one index with the metric. It acts on the tangent space at ''p'' by {{nowrap|''r''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt; → ''F''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;''r''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. We will use the symbol ''F'' to denote either the bivector or the operator, according to context.

We mention a dichotomy drawn from exterior algebra. A bivector that can be written as {{nowrap|1=''F'' = ''v'' ∧ ''w''}}, where ''v'', ''w'' are linearly independent, is called ''simple''. Any nonzero bivector over a 4-dimensional vector space either is simple, or can be written as {{nowrap|1=''F'' = ''v'' ∧ ''w'' + ''x'' ∧ ''y''}}, where ''v'', ''w'', ''x'', and ''y'' are linearly independent; the two cases are mutually exclusive. Stated like this, the dichotomy makes no reference to the metric ''η'', only to exterior algebra. But it is easily seen that the associated skew-symmetric linear operator ''F''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; has rank 2 in the former case and rank 4 in the latter case.&lt;ref&gt;The rank given here corresponds to that as a linear operator or tensor; the [[Exterior algebra#Rank of a k-vector|rank as defined for a ''k''-vector]] is half that given here.&lt;/ref&gt;

To state the classification theorem, we consider the ''eigenvalue problem'' for ''F'', that is, the problem of finding [[eigenvalues]] ''&amp;lambda;'' and [[eigenvectors]] ''r'' which satisfy the eigenvalue equation
: &lt;math&gt;F^a{}_br^b = \lambda\, r^a .&lt;/math&gt; 
The skew-symmetry of ''F'' implies that:

* ''either'' the eigenvector ''r'' is a [[null vector (Minkowski space)|null vector]] (i.e. {{nowrap|1=''η''(''r'',''r'') = 0}}), ''or'' the eigenvalue ''λ'' is zero, ''or both''.

A 1-dimensional subspace generated by a null eigenvector is called a ''principal null direction'' of the bivector.

The classification theorem characterizes the possible principal null directions of a bivector.  It states that one of the following must hold for any nonzero bivector:
* the bivector has one "repeated" principal null direction; in this case, the bivector itself is said to be ''null'',
* the bivector has two distinct principal null directions; in this case, the bivector is called ''non-null''.
Furthermore, for any non-null bivector, the two eigenvalues associated with the two distinct principal null directions have the same magnitude but opposite sign, {{nowrap|1=''&amp;lambda;'' = ±''&amp;nu;''}}, so we have three subclasses of non-null bivectors:
:*''spacelike'': ''&amp;nu;'' = 0
:*''timelike'' : ''&amp;nu;'' ≠ 0 and {{nowrap|1=rank ''F'' = 2}}
:*''non-simple'': ''&amp;nu;'' ≠ 0 and {{nowrap|1=rank ''F'' = 4}},
where the rank refers to the [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] of the linear operator ''F''.{{clarify|reason=It would be nice to know the rank in all cases, including the case of a "null" bivector. Is the case labelled "non-simple" precise the case where F is non-simple? Then this should be stated explicitly.|date=June 2015}}

==Physical interpretation==

The algebraic classification of bivectors given above has an important application in [[relativistic physics]]: the [[electromagnetic field]] is represented by a skew-symmetric second rank tensor field (the [[electromagnetic tensor|electromagnetic field tensor]]) so we immediately obtain an algebraic classification of electromagnetic fields.

In a cartesian chart on [[Minkowski space]]time, the electromagnetic field tensor has components
:&lt;math&gt;F_{ab} = \left(
\begin{matrix}
0 &amp; B_z &amp; -B_y &amp; E_x/c \\
-B_z &amp; 0 &amp; B_x &amp; E_y/c \\
B_y &amp; -B_x &amp; 0 &amp; E_z/c \\
-E_x/c &amp; -E_y/c &amp; -E_z/c &amp; 0
\end{matrix}
\right) &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;E_x, E_y, E_z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_x, B_y, B_z&lt;/math&gt; denote respectively the components of the electric and magnetic fields, as measured by an inertial observer (at rest in our coordinates).  As usual in relativistic physics, we will find it convenient to work with [[geometrized unit system|geometrised units]] in which &lt;math&gt;c=1&lt;/math&gt;. In the "[[Index gymnastics]]" formalism of special relativity, the [[Minkowski metric]] &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is used to raise and lower indices.

===Invariants===

The fundamental invariants of the electromagnetic field are:
:&lt;math&gt; P \equiv \frac{1}{2} F_{ab} \, F^{ab} = \| \vec{B} \|^2 - \frac{\| \vec{E} \|^2}{c^2} = -\frac{1}{2}{}^* F_{ab} \, {}^* F^{ab}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Q \equiv \frac{1}{4}  F_{ab} \, {}^*F^{ab} =\frac{1}{8}\epsilon^{abcd}F_{ab}F_{cd}= \frac{\vec{E} \cdot \vec{B}}{c}&lt;/math&gt;. 
(Fundamental means that every other invariant can be expressed in terms of these two.)

A '''null electromagnetic field''' is characterised by  &lt;math&gt;P = Q =0&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, the invariants reveal that the electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular and that they are of the same magnitude (in geometrised units). An example of a null field is a [[plane wave|plane electromagnetic wave]] in [[Minkowski space]].

A '''non-null field''' is characterised by &lt;math&gt;P^2+Q^2 \neq \, 0&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;P \neq 0 = Q&lt;/math&gt;, there exists an [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial reference frame]] for which either the electric or magnetic field vanishes.  (These correspond respectively to ''magnetostatic'' and ''electrostatic'' fields.)  If &lt;math&gt;Q \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;, there exists an inertial frame in which electric and magnetic fields are proportional.

==Curved Lorentzian manifolds==

So far we have discussed only [[Minkowski spacetime]].  According to the (strong) equivalence principle, if we simply replace "inertial frame" above with a [[frame fields in general relativity|frame field]], everything works out exactly the same way on curved manifolds.

[[Image:Circle as Lie group.svg|right|thumb|The [[circle]] of center 0 and radius 1 in the [[complex plane]] is a compact Lie group with complex multiplication.]]

In [[mathematics]], a '''compact''' ('''topological''') '''group''' is a [[topological group]] whose [[topology]] is [[compact space|compact]]. Compact groups are a natural generalization of [[finite group]]s with the [[discrete topology]] and have properties that carry over in significant fashion. Compact groups have a well-understood theory, in relation to [[group action]]s and [[representation theory]].

In the following we will assume all groups are [[Hausdorff space]]s.

==Compact Lie groups==

[[Lie group]]s form a very nice class of topological groups, and the compact Lie groups have a particularly well-developed theory. Basic examples of compact Lie groups include&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 1.2&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[circle group]] '''T''' and the [[torus group]]s '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;,
* the [[orthogonal group]]s O(''n''), the [[special orthogonal group]] SO(''n'') and its covering [[spin group]] Spin(''n''),
* the [[unitary group]] U(''n'') and the [[special unitary group]] SU(''n''),
* the [[symplectic group]] Sp(''n''),
* the compact forms of the [[exceptional Lie group]]s: [[G2 (mathematics)|G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[F4 (mathematics)|F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[E6 (mathematics)|E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[E7 (mathematics)|E&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[E8 (mathematics)|E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]],
The [[classification theorem]] of compact Lie groups states that up to finite [[group extension|extensions]] and finite [[covering group|covers]] this exhausts the list of examples (which already includes some redundancies). This classification is described in more detail in the next subsection.

===Classification===

Given any compact Lie group ''G'' one can take its [[identity component]] ''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, which is [[connected space|connected]]. The [[quotient group]] ''G''/''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the group of components &amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''G'') which must be finite since ''G'' is compact. We therefore have a finite extension
:&lt;math&gt;1\to G_0 \to G \to \pi_0(G) \to 1.\,&lt;/math&gt;
Meanwhile, for connected compact Lie groups, we have the following result:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bröcker|1985}} Chapter V, Sections 7 and 8&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''Theorem''': Every connected compact Lie group is the quotient by a finite central subgroup of a product of a simply connected compact Lie group and a torus.
Thus, the classification of connected compact Lie groups can in principle be reduced to knowledge of the simply connected compact Lie groups together with information about their centers. (For information about the center, see the section below on fundamental group and center.)

Finally, every compact, connected, simply-connected Lie group ''K'' is a product of compact, connected, simply-connected [[simple Lie group]]s ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; each of which is isomorphic to exactly one of the following:
*The [[Symplectic_group#Sp.28n.29|compact symplectic group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Sp}(n),\,n\geq 1&lt;/math&gt;
*The [[special unitary group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SU}(n),\,n\geq 3&lt;/math&gt;
*The [[spin group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Spin}(n),\,n\geq 7&lt;/math&gt;
or one of the five exceptional groups [[G2 (mathematics)|G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[F4 (mathematics)|F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[E6 (mathematics)|E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[E7 (mathematics)|E&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[E8 (mathematics)|E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]]. The restrictions on ''n'' are to avoid special isomorphisms among the various families for small values of ''n''. For each of these groups, the center is known explicitly. The classification is through the associated [[root system]] (for a fixed maximal torus), which in turn are classified by their [[Dynkin diagram]]s.

The classification of compact, simply connected Lie groups is the same as the classification of complex [[semisimple Lie algebra]]s. Indeed, if ''K'' is a simply connected compact Lie group, then the complexification of the Lie algebra of ''K'' is semisimple. Conversely, every complex semisimple Lie algebra has a compact real form isomorphic to the Lie algebra of a compact, simply connected Lie group.

===Maximal tori and root systems===
{{see also|Maximal torus|Root system}}
A key idea in the study of a connected compact Lie group ''K'' is the concept of a ''maximal torus'', that is a subgroup ''T'' of ''K'' that is isomorphic to several copies of &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; and that is not contained in any larger subgroup of this type. A basic example is the case &lt;math&gt;K=SU(n)&lt;/math&gt;, in which case we may take &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; to be the group of diagonal elements in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;. A basic result is the ''torus theorem'' which states that every element of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; belongs to a maximal torus and that all maximal tori are conjugate.

The maximal torus in a compact group plays a role analogous to that of the [[Semisimple_Lie_algebra#Cartan_subalgebras_and_root_systems|Cartan subalgebra]] in a complex semisimple Lie algebra. In particular, once a maximal torus &lt;math&gt;T\subset K&lt;/math&gt; has been chosen, one can define a [[root system]] and a [[Weyl group]] similar to what one has for [[semisimple Lie algebra]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt; These structures then play an essential role both in the classification of connected compact groups (described above) and in the representation theory of a fixed such group (described below).

The root systems associated to the simple compact groups appearing in the classification of simply connected compact groups are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 7.7&lt;/ref&gt;
*The special unitary groups &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SU}(n)&lt;/math&gt; correspond to the root system &lt;math&gt;A_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;
*The odd spin groups &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Spin}(2n+1)&lt;/math&gt; correspond to the root system &lt;math&gt;B_{n}&lt;/math&gt;
*The compact symplectic groups &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Sp}(n)&lt;/math&gt; correspond to the root system &lt;math&gt;C_{n}&lt;/math&gt;
*The even spin groups &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Spin}(2n)&lt;/math&gt; correspond to the root system &lt;math&gt;D_{n}&lt;/math&gt;

===Fundamental group and center===
{{see also|Fundamental group#Lie groups}}
It is important to know whether a connected compact Lie group is simply connected, and if not, to determine its [[fundamental group]]. For compact Lie groups, there are [[Fundamental_group#Lie_groups|two basic approaches]] to computing the fundamental group. The first approach applies to the classical compact groups &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SU}(n)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{U}(n)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SO}(n)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Sp}(n)&lt;/math&gt; and proceeds by induction on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. The second approach uses the root system and applies to all connected compact Lie groups.

It is also important to know the center of a connected compact Lie group. The center of a classical group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; can easily be computed "by hand," and in most cases consists simply of whatever multiples of the identity are in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. (The group SO(2) is an exception—the center is the whole group, even though most elements are not multiples of the identity.) Thus, for example, the center of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SU}(n)&lt;/math&gt; consists of ''n''th roots of unity times the identity, a cyclic group of order &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

In general, the center can be expressed in terms of the root lattice and the kernel of the exponential map for the maximal torus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 13.8&lt;/ref&gt; The general method shows, for example, that the simply connected compact group corresponding to the exceptional root system &lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt; has trivial center. Thus, [[G2_(mathematics)|the compact &lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt; group]] is one of very few simple compact groups that are simultaneously simply connected and center free. (The others are [[F4 (mathematics)|&lt;math&gt;F_4&lt;/math&gt;]] and [[E8 (mathematics)|&lt;math&gt;E_8&lt;/math&gt;]].)

==Further examples==

Amongst groups that are not Lie groups, and so do not carry the structure of a [[manifold]], examples are the additive group ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; of [[p-adic integer]]s, and constructions from it. In fact any [[profinite group]] is a compact group. This means that [[Galois group]]s are compact groups, a basic fact for the theory of [[algebraic extension]]s in the case of infinite degree.

[[Pontryagin duality]] provides a large supply of examples of compact commutative groups. These are in duality with abelian [[discrete group]]s.

==Haar measure==

Compact groups all carry a [[Haar measure]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Weil | first = André | author-link = André Weil | title = L'intégration dans les groupes topologiques et ses applications | series = Actualités Scientifiques et Industrielles | publisher = Hermann | year = 1940 | place = Paris | volume = 869}}''&lt;/ref&gt; which will be invariant by both left and right translation (the [[Haar measure|modulus function]] must be a continuous [[homomorphism]] to [[positive reals]] (ℝ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, ×), and so 1). In other words, these groups are [[unimodular group|unimodular]]. Haar measure is easily normalized to be a [[probability measure]], analogous to d&amp;theta;/2&amp;pi; on the circle.

Such a Haar measure is in many cases easy to compute; for example for orthogonal groups it was known to [[Adolf Hurwitz]], and in the Lie group cases can always be given by an invariant [[differential form]]. In the profinite case there are many subgroups of [[finite index]], and Haar measure of a coset will be the reciprocal of the index. Therefore, integrals are often computable quite directly, a fact applied constantly in [[number theory]].

==Representation theory==

The representation theory of compact groups (not necessarily Lie groups and not necessarily connected) was founded by the [[Peter–Weyl theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=F.|last1=Peter|first2=H.|last2=Weyl|title=Die Vollständigkeit der primitiven Darstellungen einer geschlossenen kontinuierlichen Gruppe|journal=Math. Ann.|volume=97|year=1927|pages=737–755|doi=10.1007/BF01447892}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermann Weyl]] went on to give the detailed [[character theory]] of the compact connected Lie groups, based on [[maximal torus]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Part III&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting [[Weyl character formula]] was one of the influential results of twentieth century mathematics. The combination of the Peter–Weyl theorem and the Weyl character formula led Weyl to a complete classification of the representations of a connected compact Lie group; this theory is described in the next section.

A combination of Weyl's work and [[Closed subgroup theorem|Cartan's theorem]] gives a survey of the whole representation theory of compact groups ''G'' . That is, by the Peter–Weyl theorem the irreducible [[unitary representation]]s &amp;rho; of ''G'' are into a unitary group (of finite dimension) and the image will be a closed subgroup of the unitary group by compactness. Cartan's theorem states that Im(&amp;rho;) must itself be a Lie subgroup in the unitary group. If ''G'' is not itself a Lie group, there must be a kernel to &amp;rho;. Further one can form an [[inverse system]], for the kernel of &amp;rho; smaller and smaller, of finite-dimensional unitary representations, which identifies ''G'' as an [[inverse limit]] of compact Lie groups. Here the fact that in the limit a [[faithful representation]] of ''G'' is found is another consequence of the Peter–Weyl theorem,

The unknown part of the representation theory of compact groups is thereby, roughly speaking, thrown back onto the [[complex representations of finite groups]]. This theory is rather rich in detail, but is qualitatively well understood.

==Representation theory of a connected compact Lie group==
Certain simple examples of the representation theory of compact Lie groups can be worked out by hand, such as the representations of the [[Representation_of_a_Lie_group#An_example:_The_rotation_group_SO.283.29|rotation group SO(3)]], the [[Representation theory of SU(2)|special unitary group SU(2)]], and the [[Clebsch–Gordan_coefficients_for_SU(3)#Representations_of_the_SU.283.29_group|special unitary group SU(3)]]. We focus here on the general theory. See also the parallel theory of [[Lie_algebra_representation#Classifying_finite-dimensional_representations_of_Lie_algebras|representations of a semisimple Lie algebra]].

Throughout this section, we fix a connected compact Lie group ''K'' and a [[maximal torus]] ''T'' in ''K''.
===Representation theory of ''T''===
Since ''T'' is commutative, [[Schur's lemma]] tells us that each irreducible representation &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; of ''T'' is one-dimensional:
:&lt;math&gt;\rho:T\rightarrow GL(1;\mathbb{C})=\mathbb{C}^*&lt;/math&gt;.
Since, also, ''T'' is compact, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; must actually map into &lt;math&gt;S^1\subset\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

To describe these representations concretely, we let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt; be the Lie algebra of ''T'' and we write points &lt;math&gt;h\in T&lt;/math&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt;h=e^{H},\quad H\in\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt;.
In such coordinates, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; will have the form
:&lt;math&gt;\rho(e^{H})=e^{i \lambda(H)}&lt;/math&gt;
for some linear functional &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt;. 

Now, since the exponential map &lt;math&gt;H\mapsto e^{H}&lt;/math&gt; is not injective, not every such linear functional &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; gives rise to a well-defined map of ''T'' into &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt;. Rather, let &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; denote the kernel of the exponential map:
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma=\{ H\in\mathfrak{t}|e^{2\pi H}=\mathrm{Id}\}&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Id}&lt;/math&gt; is the identity element of ''T''. (We scale the exponential map here by a factor of &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt; in order to avoid such factors elsewhere.) 
Then for &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; to give a well-defined map &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; must satisfy
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda(H)\in\mathbb{Z},\quad H\in\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of integers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 12.9&lt;/ref&gt; A linear functional &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; satisfying this condition is called an '''analytically integral element'''. This integrality condition is related to, but not identical to, the notion of [[Weight_(representation_theory)#Weights_in_the_representation_theory_of_semisimple_Lie_algebras|integral element]] in the setting of semisimple Lie algebras.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 12.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Suppose, for example, ''T'' is just the group of &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; of complex numbers &lt;math&gt;e^{i\theta}&lt;/math&gt; of absolute value 1. The Lie algebra is the set of pure imaginary numbers, &lt;math&gt;H=i\theta,\,\theta\in\mathbb{R},&lt;/math&gt; and the kernel of the (scaled) exponential map is the set of numbers of the form &lt;math&gt;in&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is an integer. A linear functional &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; takes integer values on all such numbers if and only if it is of the form &lt;math&gt;\lambda(i\theta)=k\theta&lt;/math&gt; for some integer &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. The irreducible representations of ''T'' in this case are one-dimensional and of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\rho(e^{i\theta})=e^{ik\theta},\quad k \in\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Representation theory of ''K''===
{{see also|Lie algebra representation#Classifying finite-dimensional representations of Lie algebras}}
[[File:A2example.pdf|thumb|Example of the weights of a representation of the group SU(3)]]
[[Image:meson octet.png|thumb|The "[[Eightfold Way (physics)|eightfold way]]" representation of SU(3), as used in particle physics]]
[[File:Weights_for_A2_root_system.png|thumb|right|Black dots indicate the dominant integral elements for the group SU(3)]]
We now let &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; denote a finite-dimensional irreducible representation of ''K'' (over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;). We then consider the restriction of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; to ''T''. This restriction not irreducible unless &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is one-dimensional. Nevertheless, the restriction decomposes as a direct sum of irreducible representations of ''T''. (Note that a given irreducible representation of ''T'' may occur more than once.) Now, each irreducible representation of ''T'' is described by a linear functional &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; as in the preceding subsection. If a given &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; occurs at least once in the decomposition of the restriction of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; to ''T'', we call &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; a '''weight''' of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;. The strategy of the representation theory of ''K'' is to classify the irreducible representations in terms of their weights.

We now briefly describe the structures needed to formulate the theorem; more details can be found in the article on [[Weight_(representation_theory)#Weights_in_the_representation_theory_of_semisimple_Lie_algebras|weights in representation theory]]. We need the notion of a '''root system''' for ''K'' (relative to a given maximal torus ''T''). The construction of this root system &lt;math&gt;R\subset \mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt; is very similar to the [[Semisimple_Lie_algebra#Cartan_subalgebras_and_root_systems|construction for complex semisimple Lie algebras]]. Specifically, the weights are the nonzero weights for the adjoint action of ''T'' on the complexified Lie algebra of ''K''. The root system ''R'' has all the usual properties of a [[root system]], except that the elements of ''R'' may not span &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 11.7&lt;/ref&gt; We then choose a base &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; for ''R'' and we say that an integral element &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is '''dominant''' if &lt;math&gt;\lambda(\alpha)\ge 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\lambda\in\Delta&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, we say that one weight is '''higher''' than another if their difference can be expressed as a linear combination of elements of &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; with non-negative coefficients.

The irreducible finite-dimensional representations of ''K'' are then classified by a '''theorem of the highest [[Weight_(representation_theory)|weight]]''',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt; which is closely related to the analogous theorem classifying [[Lie_algebra_representation#Classifying_finite-dimensional_representations_of_Lie_algebras|representations of a semisimple Lie algebra]]. The result says that: 
:(1) every irreducible representation has highest weight, 
:(2) the highest weight is always a dominant, analytically integral element, 
:(3) two irreducible representations with the same highest weight are isomorphic, and 
:(4) every dominant, analytically integral element arises as the highest weight of an irreducible representation.

The theorem of the highest weight for representations of ''K'' is then almost the same as for semisimple Lie algebras, with one notable exception: The concept of an [[Weight_(representation_theory)#Integral_weight|integral element]] is different. The weights &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; of a representation &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; are analytically integral in the sense described in the previous subsection. Every analytically integral element is [[Weight_(representation_theory)#Integral_weight|integral]] in the Lie algebra sense, but not the other way around.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 12.2&lt;/ref&gt; (This phenomenon reflects that, in general, [[Lie_group–Lie_algebra_correspondence#Lie_group_representations|not every representation]] of the Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; comes from a representation of the group ''K''.) On the other hand, if ''K'' is simply connected, the set of possible highest weights in the group sense is the same as the set of possible highest weights in the Lie algebra sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Corollary 13.20&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Weyl character formula===
{{main|Weyl character formula}}
If &lt;math&gt;\Pi:K\rightarrow\mathrm{GL}(V)&lt;/math&gt; is representation of ''K'', we define the '''character''' of &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; to be the function &lt;math&gt;\Chi :K\rightarrow\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; given by
:&lt;math&gt;\Chi(x)=\mathrm{trace}(\Pi(x)),\quad x\in K&lt;/math&gt;.
This function is easily seen to be a class function, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\Chi(xyx^{-1})=\Chi(y)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in ''K''. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\Chi&lt;/math&gt; is determined by its restriction to ''T''.

The study of characters is an important part of the representation theory of compact groups. One crucial result, which is a corollary of the [[Peter–Weyl theorem]], is that the characters form an orthonormal basis for the set of square-integrable class functions in ''K''. A second key result is the [[Weyl character formula]], which gives an explicit formula for the character—or, rather, the restriction of the character to ''T''—in terms of the highest weight of the representation. 

In the closely related representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras, the Weyl character formula is an additional result established ''after'' the representations have been classified. In Weyl's analysis of the compact group case, however, the Weyl character formula is actually a crucial part of the classification itself. Specifically, in Weyl's analysis of the representations of ''K'', the hardest part of the theorem—showing that every dominant, analytically integral element is actually the highest weight of some representation—is proved in totally different way from the usual Lie algebra construction using [[Verma_module|Verma modules]]. In Weyl's approach, the construction is based on the [[Peter–Weyl theorem]] and an analytic proof of the [[Weyl character formula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Sections 12.4 and 12.5&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the irreducible representations of ''K'' are realized inside the space of continuous functions on ''K''.

===The SU(2) case===
We now consider the case of the compact group SU(2). The representations are often considered from the [[Representation theory of SU(2)|Lie algebra point of view]], but we here look at them from the group point of view. We take the maximal torus to be the set of matrices of the form
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix}
e^{i\theta} &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; e^{-i\theta}
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;.
According to the example discussed above in the section on representations of ''T'', the analytically integral elements are labeled by integers, so that the dominant, analytically integral elements are non-negative integers &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;. The general theory then tells us that for each &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, there is a unique irreducible representation of SU(2) with highest weight &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;. 

Much information about the representation corresponding to a given &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is encoded in its character. Now, the Weyl character formula says, [[Weyl_character_formula#The_SU.282.29_case|in this case]], that the character is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\Chi\left(\begin{pmatrix}
e^{i\theta} &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; e^{-i\theta}
\end{pmatrix}\right)=\frac{\mathrm{sin}((m+1)\theta)}{\mathrm{sin}(\theta)}.&lt;/math&gt;
We can also write the character as sum of exponentials as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\Chi\left(\begin{pmatrix}
e^{i\theta} &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; e^{-i\theta}
\end{pmatrix}\right)=e^{im\theta}+e^{i(m-2)\theta}+\cdots e^{-i(m-2)\theta}+e^{-im\theta}.&lt;/math&gt;
(If we use the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series on the above expression and simplify, we obtain the earlier expression.)

From this last expression and the standard formula for the [[Weyl_character_formula#Complex_semisimple_Lie_algebras|character in terms of the weights of the representation]], we can read off that the weights of the representation are 
:&lt;math&gt;m,m-2,\ldots,-(m-2),-m&lt;/math&gt;,
each with multiplicity one. (The weights are the integers appearing in the exponents of the exponentials and the multiplicities are the coefficients of the exponentials.) Since there are &lt;math&gt;m+1&lt;/math&gt; weights, each with multiplicity 1, the dimension of the representation is &lt;math&gt;m+1&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, we recover much of the information about the representations that is usually obtained from the Lie algebra computation.

===An outline of the proof===
We now outline the proof of the theorem of the highest weight, following the original argument of [[Hermann Weyl]]. We continue to let &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; be a connected compact Lie group and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; a fixed maximal torus in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;. We focus on the most difficult part of the theorem, showing that every dominant, analytically integral element is the highest weight of some (finite-dimensional) irreducible representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Sections 12.4 and 12.5&lt;/ref&gt;

The tools for the proof are the following:
*The [[Maximal_torus#Properties|torus theorem]].
*The [[Maximal_torus#Weyl_integral_formula|Weyl integral formula]].
*The [[Peter–Weyl_theorem#Restriction_to_class_functions|Peter–Weyl theorem for class functions]], which states that the characters of the irreducible representations form an orthonormal basis for the space of square integrable class functions on &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;.

With these tools in hand, we proceed with the proof. The first major step in the argument is to prove the [[Weyl character formula]]. The formula states that if &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; is an irreducible representation with highest weight &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, then the character &lt;math&gt;\Chi&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; satisfies:
: &lt;math&gt;\Chi(e^H)=\frac{\sum_{w\in W} \mathrm{det}(w) e^{i\langle w\cdot(\lambda+\rho),H\rangle}}{\sum_{w\in W} \mathrm{det}(w)e^{i\langle w\cdot\rho,H\rangle}}&lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; in the Lie algebra of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. Here &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is half the sum of the positive roots. (The notation uses the convention of "real weights"; this convention requires an explicit factor of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in the exponent.) Weyl's proof of the character formula is analytic in nature and hinges on the fact that the &lt;math&gt;L^2&lt;/math&gt; norm of the character is 1. Specifically, if there were any additional terms in the numerator, the Weyl integral formula would force the norm of the character to be greater than 1.

Next, we let &lt;math&gt;\Phi_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; denote the function on the right-hand side of the character formula. We show that ''even if &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is not known to be the highest weight of a representation'', &lt;math&gt;\Phi_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a well-defined, Weyl-invariant function on &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, which therefore extends to a class function on &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;. Then using the Weyl integral formula, one can show that as &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; ranges over the set of dominant, analytically integral elements, the functions &lt;math&gt;\Phi_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; form an orthonormal family of class functions. We emphasize that do not currently know that every such &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the highest weight of a representation; nevertheless, the expressions on the right-hand side of the character formula gives a well-defined set of functions &lt;math&gt;\Phi_\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, and these functions are orthonormal.

Now comes the conclusion. The set of all &lt;math&gt;\Phi_\lambda&lt;/math&gt;—with &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; ranging over the dominant, analytically integral elements—forms an orthonormal set in the space of square integrable class functions. But by the Weyl character formula, the characters of the irreducible representations form a subset of the &lt;math&gt;\Phi_\lambda&lt;/math&gt;'s. And by the Peter–Weyl theorem, the characters of the irreducible representations form an orthonormal basis for the space of square integrable class functions. If there were some &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; that is not the highest weight of a representation, then the corresponding &lt;math&gt;\Phi_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; would not the character of a representation. Thus, the characters would be a ''proper'' subset of the set of &lt;math&gt;\Phi_\lambda&lt;/math&gt;'s. But then we have an impossible situation: an orthonormal ''basis'' (the set of characters of the irreducible representations) would be contained in a strictly larger orthonormal set (the set of &lt;math&gt;\Phi_\lambda&lt;/math&gt;'s). Thus, every &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; must actually be the highest weight of a representation.

==Duality==

The topic of recovering a compact group from its representation theory is the subject of the [[Tannaka–Krein duality]], now often recast in term of [[tannakian category]] theory.

==From compact to non-compact groups==

The influence of the compact group theory on non-compact groups was formulated by Weyl in his [[unitarian trick]]. Inside a general [[semisimple Lie group]] there is a [[maximal compact subgroup]], and the representation theory of such groups, developed largely by [[Harish-Chandra]], uses intensively the [[restriction of a representation]] to such a subgroup, and also the model of Weyl's character theory.

'''Computational mechanics''' is the discipline concerned with the use of computational methods to study phenomena governed by the principles of [[mechanics]]. Before the emergence of [[computational science]] (also called scientific computing) as a "third way" besides theoretical and experimental sciences, computational mechanics was widely considered to be a sub-discipline of [[applied mechanics]]. It is now considered to be a sub-discipline within computational science.

==Overview==
Computational mechanics (CM) is interdisciplinary. Its three pillars are [[mechanics]], [[mathematics]], and [[computer science]].

===Mechanics===
[[Computational fluid dynamics]], [[computational thermodynamics]], [[computational electromagnetics]], computational [[solid mechanics]] are some of the many specializations within CM.

===Mathematics===
The areas of mathematics most related to computational mechanics are [[partial differential equation]]s, [[linear algebra]] and [[numerical analysis]]. The most popular numerical methods used are the [[Finite element method|finite element]], [[Finite difference method|finite difference]], and [[Boundary element method|boundary element]] methods in order of dominance. In solid mechanics finite element methods are far more prevalent than finite difference methods, whereas in fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism, finite difference methods are almost equally applicable. The boundary element technique is in general less popular, but has a niche in certain areas including acoustics engineering, for example.

===Computer Science===
With regard to computing, computer programming, algorithms, and parallel computing play a major role in CM. The most widely used programming language in the scientific community, including computational mechanics, is [[Fortran]]. Recently, [[C++]] has increased in popularity. The scientific computing community has been slow in adopting C++ as the lingua franca. Because of its very natural way of expressing mathematical computations, and its built-in visualization capacities, the proprietary language/environment [[MATLAB]] is also widely used, especially for rapid application development and model verification.

==Process==

Scientists within the field of computational mechanics follow a list of tasks to analyze their target mechanical process:

# A [[mathematical model]] of the physical phenomenon is made. This usually involves expressing the natural or engineering system in terms of [[partial differential equation]]s. This step uses [[physics]] to formalize a complex system.
# The mathematical equations are converted into forms which are suitable for digital computation. This step is called [[discretization]] because it involves creating an approximate discrete model from the original continuous model.  In particular, it typically translates a partial differential equation (or a system thereof) into a system of [[algebraic equations]]. The processes involved in this step are studied in the field of [[numerical analysis]].
# [[Computer program]]s are made to solve the discretized equations using direct methods (which are single step methods resulting in the solution) or [[iterative method]]s (which start with a trial solution and arrive at the actual solution by successive refinement). Depending on the nature of the problem, [[supercomputer]]s or [[Parallel computing|parallel computers]] may be used at this stage.
# The mathematical model, numerical procedures, and the computer codes are verified using either experimental results or simplified models for which exact [[Closed-form expression|analytical solution]]s are available. Quite frequently, new numerical or computational techniques are verified by comparing their result with those of existing well-established numerical methods. In many cases, benchmark problems are also available. The numerical results also have to be visualized and often physical interpretations will be given to the results.

==Applications==

Some examples where computational mechanics have been put to practical use are [[Crash simulation|vehicle crash simulation]], [[Reservoir simulation|petroleum reservoir modeling]], biomechanics, glass manufacturing, and semiconductor modeling. 

Complex systems that would be very difficult or impossible to treat using analytical methods have been successfully simulated using the tools provided by computational mechanics.

==Notation regarding CW complexes==

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; be a [[CW complex]]. Define the ''incidence function'' &lt;math&gt;\kappa:\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; in the following way: given two cells &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;\kappa(\sigma,~\tau)&lt;/math&gt; be the [[Topological degree theory|degree]] of the [[attaching map]] from the boundary of &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. The [[boundary operator]] &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\partial(\sigma) = \sum_{\tau \in \mathcal{X}}\kappa(\sigma,\tau)\tau&lt;/math&gt;

It is a defining property of boundary operators that &lt;math&gt;\partial\circ\partial \equiv 0&lt;/math&gt;. In more axiomatic definitions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mischaikow|first1=Konstantin|last2=Nanda|first2=Vidit|title=Morse Theory for Filtrations and Efficient computation of Persistent Homology|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00454-013-9529-6|publisher=Springer|accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; one can find the requirement that &lt;math&gt;\forall \sigma,\tau^{\prime} \in \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{\tau \in \mathcal{X}} \kappa(\sigma,\tau) \kappa(\tau,\tau^{\prime}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

which is a corollary of the above definition of the boundary operator and the requirement that &lt;math&gt;\partial\circ\partial \equiv 0&lt;/math&gt;.

==Discrete Morse functions==

A [[Real number|real]]-valued function &lt;math&gt;\mu:\mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a ''discrete Morse function'' if it satisfies the following two properties:

# For any cell &lt;math&gt;\sigma \in \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;, the number of cells &lt;math&gt;\tau \in \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; in the boundary of &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; which satisfy &lt;math&gt;\mu(\sigma) \leq \mu(\tau)&lt;/math&gt; is at most one.
# For any cell &lt;math&gt;\sigma \in \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;, the number of cells &lt;math&gt;\tau \in \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; in their boundary which satisfy &lt;math&gt;\mu(\sigma) \geq \mu(\tau)&lt;/math&gt; is at most one.

It can be shown&lt;ref&gt;Forman, Robin: [https://drona.csa.iisc.ernet.in/~vijayn/courses/TopoForVis/papers/FormanDiscreteMorseTheory.pdf ''Morse Theory for Cell Complexes''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424224841/https://drona.csa.iisc.ernet.in/~vijayn/courses/TopoForVis/papers/FormanDiscreteMorseTheory.pdf |date=April 24, 2012 }}, Lemma 2.5&lt;/ref&gt; that the cardinalities in the two conditions cannot both be one simultaneously for a fixed cell &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, provided that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is a ''regular'' CW complex. In this case, each cell &lt;math&gt;\sigma \in \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; can be paired with at most one exceptional cell &lt;math&gt;\tau \in \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;: either a boundary cell with larger &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; value, or a co-boundary cell with smaller &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; value. The cells which have no pairs, i.e., whose function values are strictly higher than their boundary cells '''and''' strictly lower than their co-boundary cells are called ''critical'' cells. Thus, a discrete Morse function partitions the CW complex into three distinct cell collections: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X} = \mathcal{A} \sqcup \mathcal{K} \sqcup \mathcal{Q}&lt;/math&gt;, where:

# &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the '''critical''' cells which are unpaired,
# &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{K}&lt;/math&gt; denotes cells which are paired with boundary cells, and
# &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Q}&lt;/math&gt; denotes cells which are paired with co-boundary cells.

By construction, there is a [[bijection]] of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] between &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional cells in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{K}&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;(k-1)&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional cells in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Q}&lt;/math&gt;, which can be denoted by &lt;math&gt;p^k:\mathcal{K}^k \to \mathcal{Q}^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt; for each [[natural number]] &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. It is an additional technical requirement that for each &lt;math&gt;K \in \mathcal{K}^k&lt;/math&gt;, the degree of the attaching map from the boundary of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; to its paired cell &lt;math&gt;p^k(K) \in \mathcal{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Unit (ring theory)|unit]] in the underlying [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;. For instance, over the [[integer]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, the only allowed values are &lt;math&gt;\pm 1&lt;/math&gt;. This technical requirement is guaranteed, for instance, when one assumes that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is a regular CW complex over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.

The fundamental result of discrete Morse theory establishes that the CW complex &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] on the level of [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]] to a new complex &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; consisting of only the critical cells. The paired cells in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{K}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Q}&lt;/math&gt; describe ''gradient paths'' between adjacent critical cells which can be used to obtain the boundary operator on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;. Some details of this construction are provided in the next section.

==The Morse complex==

A ''gradient path'' is a sequence of paired cells

:&lt;math&gt;\rho = (Q_1, K_1, Q_2, K_2, \ldots, Q_M, K_M)&lt;/math&gt;

satisfying &lt;math&gt;Q_m = p(K_m)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\kappa(K_m,~Q_{m+1}) \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;. The ''index'' of this gradient path is defined to be the integer

:&lt;math&gt;\nu(\rho) = \frac{\prod_{m=1}^{M-1}-\kappa(K_m,Q_{m+1})}{\prod_{m=1}^{M}\kappa(K_m,Q_m)}&lt;/math&gt;.

The division here makes sense because the incidence between paired cells must be &lt;math&gt;\pm 1&lt;/math&gt;. Note that by construction, the values of the discrete Morse function &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; must decrease across &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;. The path &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is said to ''connect'' two critical cells &lt;math&gt;A,A' \in \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\kappa(A,Q_1) \neq 0 \neq \kappa(K_M,A')&lt;/math&gt;. This relationship may be expressed as &lt;math&gt;A \stackrel{\rho}{\to} A'&lt;/math&gt;. The ''multiplicity'' of this connection is defined to be the integer &lt;math&gt;m(\rho) = \kappa(A,Q_1)\cdot\nu(\rho)\cdot\kappa(K_M,A)&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, the '''Morse boundary operator''' on the critical cells &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(A) = \kappa(A,A') + \sum_{A \stackrel{\rho}{\to} A'}m(\rho) A'&lt;/math&gt;

where the sum is taken over all gradient path connections from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;A'&lt;/math&gt;.

==Basic Results==

Many of the familiar results from continuous Morse theory apply in the discrete setting.

===The Morse Inequalities===

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; be a Morse complex associated to the CW complex &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;. The number &lt;math&gt;m_q = |\mathcal{A}_q|&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;-cells in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is called the &lt;math&gt;q^{th}&lt;/math&gt; ''Morse number''. Let &lt;math&gt;\beta_q&lt;/math&gt; denote the &lt;math&gt;q^{th}&lt;/math&gt; [[Betti number]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;. Then, for any &lt;math&gt;N &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, the following inequalities&lt;ref&gt;Forman, Robin: [https://drona.csa.iisc.ernet.in/~vijayn/courses/TopoForVis/papers/FormanDiscreteMorseTheory.pdf ''Morse Theory for Cell Complexes''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424224841/https://drona.csa.iisc.ernet.in/~vijayn/courses/TopoForVis/papers/FormanDiscreteMorseTheory.pdf |date=April 24, 2012 }}, Corollaries 3.5 and 3.6&lt;/ref&gt; hold

:&lt;math&gt;m_N \geq \beta_N&lt;/math&gt;, and
:&lt;math&gt;m_N - m_{N-1} + \ldots \pm m_0 \geq \beta_N - \beta_{N-1} + \ldots \pm \beta_0&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, the [[Euler characteristic]] &lt;math&gt;\chi(\mathcal{X})&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;\chi(\mathcal{X}) = m_0 - m_1 + \ldots \pm m_{\dim \mathcal{X}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Discrete Morse Homology and Homotopy Type===

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; be a regular CW complex with boundary operator &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt; and a discrete Morse function &lt;math&gt;\mu:\mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; be the associated Morse complex with Morse boundary operator &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;. Then, there is an [[Group isomorphism|isomorphism]]&lt;ref&gt;Forman, Robin: [https://drona.csa.iisc.ernet.in/~vijayn/courses/TopoForVis/papers/FormanDiscreteMorseTheory.pdf ''Morse Theory for Cell Complexes''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424224841/https://drona.csa.iisc.ernet.in/~vijayn/courses/TopoForVis/papers/FormanDiscreteMorseTheory.pdf |date=April 24, 2012 }}, Theorem 7.3&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]] groups

:&lt;math&gt;H_*(\mathcal{X},\partial) \simeq H_*(\mathcal{A},\Delta),&lt;/math&gt;

and similarly for the homotopy groups.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7487">In [[proof theory]], a discipline within [[mathematical logic]], '''double-negation translation''', sometimes called '''negative translation''', is a general approach for embedding [[classical logic]] into [[intuitionistic logic]], typically by translating formulas to formulas which are classically equivalent but intuitionistically inequivalent. Particular instances of double-negation translation include '''Glivenko's translation''' for [[propositional logic]], and the '''Gödel–Gentzen translation''' and '''Kuroda's translation''' for [[first-order logic]].

== Propositional logic ==
The easiest double-negation translation to describe comes from '''Glivenko's theorem''', proved by [[Valery Glivenko]] in 1929. It maps each classical formula φ to its double negation ¬¬φ.

Glivenko's theorem states:
:If &amp;phi; is a propositional formula, then &amp;phi; is a classical tautology if and only if ¬¬&amp;phi; is an intuitionistic tautology.

Glivenko's theorem implies the more general statement:
:If ''T'' is a set of propositional formulas, ''T*'' a set consisting of the doubly negated formulas of ''T'', and &amp;phi; a propositional formula, then ''T'' ⊢ &amp;phi; in classical logic if and only if ''T*'' ⊢ ¬¬&amp;phi; in intuitionistic logic.

In particular, a set of propositional formulas is intuitionistically consistent if and only if it is classically satisfiable.

== First-order logic ==

The ''Gödel–Gentzen translation'' (named after [[Kurt Gödel]] and [[Gerhard Gentzen]]) associates with each formula φ in a first-order language another formula φ&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;, which is defined inductively:

* If φ is atomic, then φ&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; is ¬¬φ
* (φ ∧ θ)&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; is φ&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; ∧ θ&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;
* (φ ∨ θ)&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; is ¬(¬φ&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; ∧ ¬θ&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;)
* (φ → θ)&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; is φ&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; → θ&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;
* (¬φ)&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; is ¬φ&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; 
* (∀''x'' φ)&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; is ∀''x'' φ&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; 
* (∃''x'' φ)&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; is ¬∀''x'' ¬φ&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; 

This translation has the property that φ&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; is classically equivalent to φ. The fundamental soundness theorem (Avigad and Feferman 1998, p. 342; Buss 1998 p. 66) states:
:If ''T'' is a set of axioms and &amp;phi; is a formula, then ''T'' proves &amp;phi; using classical logic if and only if ''T''&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; proves &amp;phi;&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; using intuitionistic logic.

Here ''T''&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; consists of the double-negation translations of the formulas in ''T''.

A sentence φ may not imply its negative translation φ&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; in intuitionistic first-order logic.  Troelstra and Van Dalen (1988, Ch. 2, Sec. 3) give a description (due to Leivant) of formulas that do imply their Gödel–Gentzen translation.

== Variants ==

There are several alternative definitions of the negative translation. They are all provably equivalent in intuitionistic logic, but may be easier to apply in particular contexts.

One possibility is to change the clauses for disjunction and existential quantifier to
* (φ ∨ θ)&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; is ¬¬(φ&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; ∨ θ&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;)
* (∃''x'' φ)&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; is ¬¬∃''x'' φ&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; 
Then the translation can be succinctly described as: prefix ¬¬ to every atomic formula, disjunction, and existential quantifier.

Another possibility (known as [[Sigekatu Kuroda|Kuroda]]'s translation) is to construct φ&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; from φ by putting ¬¬ before the whole formula and after every universal quantifier. Notice that this reduces to the simple ¬¬φ translation if φ is propositional.

It is also possible to define φ&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; by prefixing ¬¬ before every subformula of φ, as done by [[Kolmogorov]]. Such a translation is the logical counterpart to the [[call-by-name]] [[continuation-passing style]] translation of [[functional programming languages]] along the lines of the [[Curry–Howard correspondence]] between proofs and programs.

== Results ==

The double-negation translation was used by Gödel&amp;nbsp;(1933) to study the relationship between classical and intuitionistic theories of the natural numbers ("arithmetic"). He obtains the following result:
:If a formula &amp;phi; is provable from the axioms of [[Peano arithmetic]] then &amp;phi;&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; is provable from the axioms of intuitionistic [[Heyting arithmetic]].

This result shows that if Heyting arithmetic is consistent then so is Peano arithmetic. This is because a contradictory formula {{nowrap|1=&amp;theta; &amp;and; ¬&amp;theta;}} is interpreted as {{nowrap|1=&amp;theta;&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;and; ¬&amp;theta;&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which is still contradictory. Moreover, the proof of the relationship is entirely constructive, giving a way to transform a proof of {{nowrap|1=&amp;theta; &amp;and; ¬&amp;theta;}} in Peano arithmetic into a proof of {{nowrap|1=&amp;theta;&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;and; ¬&amp;theta;&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;}} in Heyting arithmetic. (By combining the double-negation translation with the [[Friedman translation]], it is in fact possible to prove that Peano arithmetic is [[arithmetical hierarchy|Π&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.65em"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]-[[conservative extension|conservative]] over Heyting arithmetic.)

The propositional mapping of φ to ¬¬φ does not extend to a sound translation of first-order logic, because {{nowrap|1=&amp;forall;''x'' ¬¬&amp;phi;(''x'') → ¬¬&amp;forall;''x'' &amp;phi;(''x'')}} is not a theorem of intuitionistic predicate logic. This explains why φ&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; has to be defined in a more complicated way in the first-order case.

'''Embodied design''' grows from the idea of [[embodied cognition]]: that the actions of the body can play a role in the development of thought and ideas.&lt;ref name="McNerney"&gt;Sam McNerney "Embodied Cognition and Design: A New Approach and Vocabulary" (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abrahamson &amp; Lindgren"&gt;Dor Abrahamson, and Robb Lindgren "Embodiment and Embodied Design." Accessed May 7, 2014. http://ccl.northwestern.edu/papers/2014/AbrahamsonLindgren-embodiment-and-embodied-design-in-press_.pdf (In Press)&lt;/ref&gt; Embodied design brings mathematics to life; studying the effects of the body on the mind, researchers learn how to design objects and activities for learning.&lt;ref name="Alibali &amp; Nathan"&gt;Martha W. Alibali &amp; Mitchell J. Nathan "Embodiment in Mathematics Teaching and Learning: Evidence From Learners' and Teachers' Gestures (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Embodiment is an aspect of [[pattern recognition]] in all fields of human endeavor.

Embodied design has an increasing role in mathematics education. Designers can use embodied cognition as a tool to study human behavior and create [[user-centered design]]s. Embodied design examines the meaning of abstractions, analyzing student reasoning and connecting mathematics to other subjects; for example, students can look at [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional relationships]] in a work of art.

Learning strategies based on embodied design rely on motion and visualization; physical activity is helpful in learning a mathematical concept. When students are physically and mentally involved in learning, they retain content better. Recent theoretical advances such as Embodied Cognitive Load Theory have been suggested to harvest the potential advantages of embodied interaction modes for learning without filling up cognitive resources.&lt;ref name="Skulmowski et al., 2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skulmowski|first1=Alexander|last2=Pradel|first2=Simon|last3=Kühnert|first3=Tom|last4=Brunnett|first4=Guido|last5=Rey|first5=Günter Daniel|title=Embodied learning using a tangible user interface: The effects of haptic perception and selective pointing on a spatial learning task|journal=Computers &amp; Education|volume=92–93|pages=64–75|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2015.10.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Embodied design frequently includes trial-and-error learning.

Embodied cognition is a tool designers can use to study "human behavior normally unobservable in order to create human-centric designs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/insights-of-genius/embodied-cognition-and-design-a-new-approach-and-vocabulary|title=Embodied Cognition and Design: A New Approach and Vocabulary|author=Sam McNerney|work=Big Think}}&lt;/ref&gt; For teachers, embodied design is planning experiences for students with lesson plans, curricula, activities and lessons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathedresearch.blogspot.com/2008/08/embodied-design.html|title=Mathematics Education Research Blog|work=mathedresearch.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical manipulatives==
One aspect of embodied design is the use of [[Manipulative (mathematics education)|manipulatives]] in learning. Manipulatives allow students to explore mathematical concepts by working with physical objects, linking their discoveries to abstractions. Although manipulatives are primarily used to illustrate [[modern elementary mathematics]], educators use objects to represent abstract topics taught in high school, college and beyond.&lt;ref name="Eisenberg"&gt;Michael Eisenberg “Embodiment as a Strategy for Mathematics Education” (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; A function of embodied design is to expand the use of manipulatives to foster the understanding of undergraduate abstract mathematics.

One disadvantage of manipulatives is that students struggle to connect the physical activity to mathematical symbols and notation. Although manipulatives allow students to develop a deeper understanding of a concept, they need support to transfer that knowledge to algebraic representations.&lt;ref name="Alexander&amp;Co"&gt;April Alexander &amp; Larissa Co “Tangible Digital Manipulatives for Math Learning” (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although an influential theory in the field of instructional design, [[cognitive load theory]], recommends designs involving lower levels of interactivity in order to save up cognitive resources for learning, the benefits of embodied interactions are evident. As a result, a synthesis, embodied cognitive load theory, has been proposed to aid in embodied design. In this model, embodied interactions are conducive to learning if the cognitive costs (such as motor coordination) are outweighed by their benefits (such as multimodal processing).&lt;ref name="Skulmowski et al., 2016"/&gt;

==Problem solving==
Another application of embodied design in mathematics education is its effect on [[problem solving]] and the development of critical-thinking skills. Throughout the problem-solving process students use objects to develop understanding, conveying understanding and meaning through gestures.&lt;ref name="Abrahamson"&gt;Dor Abrahamson “Handling problems: embodied reasoning in situated mathematics” (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Problem solvers use gestures to connect their thoughts to the manipulatives with which they are familiar, and changing a manipulative's shape affects how a student connects with it and uses it to solve a problem. In a study by van Gog, Post, ten Napel and Deijkers, students performed better when they used simpler objects (such as colored discs) than when they used more-complicated objects (such as animal figures).&lt;ref name="van Gog"&gt;Tamara van Gog, Lysanne S. Post, Robin J. ten Napel, &amp; Lian Deijkers “Effect of Object’s ‘Embodiment’ on the Acquisition of Problem Solving Skills through Practice or Video-Based Modeling Example Study” (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Although problems can be as simple as what to wear or eat, their solutions are still a cognitive process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://managementhelp.org/personalproductivity/problem-solving.htm|title=Problem Solving and Decision Making (Solving Problems and Making Decisions)|work=managementhelp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Problem solving through manipulatives}}With manipulatives===
With embodied design, mathematics is not only about correct answers but the process of finding them. Students are asked to communicate the process ("road map") they took to arrive at an answer. Typical problem-solving questions, such as "What needs do you have? What is the problem you are posed with? How did you collect information? How did you come to your conclusion? How could you have optimized your steps to reach that conclusion?" can be answered with manipulatives. One aim of problem solving in embodied design is to inspire students' creativity and curiosity, allowing personal connections to problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fie-conference.org/fie95/3a5/3a54/3a54.htm |title=Engineering Design Processes |work=fie-conference.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325005727/http://fie-conference.org/fie95/3a5/3a54/3a54.htm |archivedate=2014-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs-wm/22850.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

If students are given a problem which involves tactile manipulation, the learning process may be more meaningful. For example, students can learn to solve a [[Rubik's Cube]] puzzle by using a series of [[algorithm]]s and steps. The process involves orientation, following directions and spatial cognition.&lt;ref name="Arizpe"&gt;Omar Arizpe, Jerry Dwyer, Tara Stevens “Mathematical Self-Efficacy of Middle School Students Solving the Rubik Cube” (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical arts and crafts==
One approach to embodied design in mathematics is the use of creative tasks, such as arts and crafts. When a student has mathematics in mind while creating a unique piece, they are engaged in mental and physical learning. The concept of area can be taught with an arts-and-crafts activity, where students find leaves and trace them on paper; they are then asked to determine the number of beans (or peas) required to cover the entire leaf area. The class can then be asked which student had the largest (or smallest) leaf, and the areas can be compared.&lt;ref name="Reys"&gt;Robert E. Reys "Mathematics, multiple embodiment, and elementary teachers" (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer programming==
With game consoles such as the [[Wii]] and [[PlayStation Move]], students can understand how moving a gaming wand can change the effects on the screen. Researchers who developing programs in mathematics use embodied design and gaming principles to help students create and manipulate mathematical models. At the Embodied Design Research Laboratory, researchers created a game in which fifth-graders learn ratios by holding tennis balls in the air. When the tennis balls are held at a 1:2 ratio, the screen turns green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edrl.berkeley.edu/content/toward-embodied-interaction-design-framework-mathematical-concepts|title=Toward an embodied-interaction design framework for mathematical concepts.  - Embodied Design Research Laboratory|work=berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another embodied-design area related to programming is digital manipulatives. Some students feel weak in mathematics because it is not connected to the physical world, and digital manipulatives are being created to strengthen the connection between mathematics and the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.antle.iat.sfu.ca/CEIWorkshop/Papers/MathManipulatives_WorkshopPaper_IDC09_Eisenberg.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

When students use a touchscreen with their fingers, they use gestures to create (or use) virtual objects in the program. Computers can model environments where the students imagine their bodies to be, and the mind behaves as it would on a playground. Cell phones, pads and computers provide mathematically-enhanced models everywhere, exploring everyday experiences and the curriculum in more-abstract ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/tlauwers/proposal/tlauwers_proposal.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923172306/http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/tlauwers/proposal/tlauwers_proposal.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.editlib.org/p/29179|title=Embodied Cognition and Video Game Programming|author=Cameron Fadjo|date=30 June 2008|work=editlib.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Endre Szemerédi''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈɛndrɛ ˈsɛmɛreːdi|lang}}; born August 21, 1940) is a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-[[United States|American]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nepszava.hu/articles/article.php?id=532617|title=Magyar tudós kapta a matematika Nobel-díját|publisher=[[Népszava]]|date=March 21, 2012|accessdate=April 19, 2012|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[mathematician]] and [[computer scientist]], working in the field of [[combinatorics]] and [[theoretical computer science]]. He has been the State of New Jersey Professor of computer science at [[Rutgers University]] since 1986. He also holds a professor emeritus status at the [[Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics]] of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].

Szemerédi has won prizes in mathematics and science, including the [[Abel Prize]] in 2012. He has made a number of discoveries in combinatorics and computer science, including [[Szemerédi's theorem]], the [[Szemerédi regularity lemma]], the [[Erdős–Szemerédi theorem]], the [[Hajnal–Szemerédi theorem]] and the [[Szemerédi–Trotter theorem]].

==Early life==
Szemerédi was born in [[Budapest]]. Since his parents wished him to become a doctor, Szemerédi enrolled at a college of medicine, but he dropped out after six months (in an interview&lt;ref&gt;By Gabor Stockert&lt;/ref&gt; he explained it: "I was not sure I could do work bearing such responsibility.").&lt;ref name="ams"&gt;{{citation|first1=Martin|last1=Raussen|first2=Christian|last2=Skau|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/201302/rnoti-p221.pdf|journal=[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]|title=Interview with Endre Szemerédi|volume=60|year=2013|issue=2|pages=221–231|doi=10.1090/noti948}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/blog/laureate/endre-szemeredi/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nopr.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/16108/1/SR%2050%282%29%2016-18.pdf Sunita Chand; Ramesh Chandra Parida . ''Science Reporter'', February 2013, p. 17]&lt;/ref&gt; He studied in [[Eötvös Loránd University]] in Budapest and received his PhD from [[Moscow State University]]. His adviser was [[Israel Gelfand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{mathgenealogy|id=70200}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stemmed from a misspelling, as Szemerédi originally wanted to study with [[Alexander Gelfond]].&lt;ref name="ams"/&gt;

==Academic career==
Szemerédi has been the State of New Jersey Professor of computer science at [[Rutgers University]] since 1986. He has held visiting positions at [[Stanford University]] (1974), [[McGill University]] (1980), the [[University of South Carolina]] (1981–1983) and the [[University of Chicago]] (1985–1986).

==Work==
Endre Szemerédi has published over 200 scientific articles in the fields of discrete mathematics, theoretical computer science, arithmetic combinatorics and discrete geometry. He is best known for his proof from 1975 of an old conjecture of [[Paul Erdős]] and [[Pál Turán]]: if a sequence of natural numbers has positive [[upper density]] then it contains arbitrarily long [[arithmetic progression]]s. This is now known as [[Szemerédi's theorem]]. One of the lemmas introduced in his proof is now known as the [[Szemerédi regularity lemma]], which has become an important lemma in [[combinatorics]], being used for instance in [[property testing]] for graphs and in the theory of [[graph limit]]s.

He is also known for the [[Szemerédi–Trotter theorem]] in [[Incidence geometry (structure)|incidence geometry]] and the [[Hajnal–Szemerédi theorem]] in [[graph theory]]. [[Miklós Ajtai]] and Szemerédi proved the [[corners theorem]], an important step toward higher-dimensional generalizations of the [[Szemerédi's theorem|Szemerédi theorem]]. With Ajtai and [[János Komlós (mathematician)|János Komlós]] he proved the ''ct''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/log ''t'' upper bound for the [[Ramsey number]] ''R''(3,''t''), and constructed a [[sorting network]] of optimal depth. With Ajtai, [[Václav Chvátal]], and [[Monty Newborn|Monroe M. Newborn]], Szemerédi proved the famous Crossing Lemma, that a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] with ''n'' vertices and ''m'' edges, where {{nowrap|''m'' &gt; 4''n''}} has at least {{nowrap|''m''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; / 64''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} [[Crossing lemma|crossings]].  With [[Paul Erdős]], he proved the [[Erdős–Szemerédi theorem]] on the number of sums and products in a finite set. With Wolfgang Paul, [[Nick Pippenger]], and [[William T. Trotter|William Trotter]], he established a separation between [[Non-deterministic Turing machine|nondeterministic]] [[linear time]] and [[Deterministic computation|deterministic]] linear time, in the spirit of the infamous [[P versus NP problem]].

==Awards and honors==
Szemerédi has won numerous awards and honors for his contribution to mathematics and computer science. A few of them are listed here:
* Grünwald Prize (1967)
* Grünwald Prize (1968)
* [[Alfréd Rényi Prize|Rényi Prize]] (1973)
* [[George Pólya Prize]] for Achievement in Applied Mathematics (SIAM), (1975)
* Prize of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (1979)
* State of New Jersey Professorship (1986)

Szemerédi is a corresponding member (1982), and member (1987) of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] and a member (2010) of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]. He is also a member of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] and a permanent research fellow at the [[Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics]] in Budapest.  He was the Fairchild Distinguished Scholar at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in 1987–88.
He is an honorary doctor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://kam.mff.cuni.cz/conferences/endrehc/|title=Doctor honoris causa Endre Szemerédi|date=June 15–16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Charles University]] in [[Prague]].
He was the lecturer in the Forty-Seventh Annual DeLong Lecture Series&lt;ref name=delong&gt;[http://math.colorado.edu/~rmg/delong/ DeLong Lecture Series]. Math.colorado.edu. Retrieved on March 22, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Colorado]].  He is also a recipient of the Aisenstadt Chair at CRM,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/Chaires/chairesPrec_an.shtml Aisenstadt Chair Recipients]. Crm.umontreal.ca. Retrieved on March 22, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Montreal]]. In 2008 he was the Eisenbud Professor at the [[Mathematical Sciences Research Institute]] in [[Berkeley, California]].

In 2012, Szemerédi was awarded the [[Abel Prize]] “for his fundamental contributions to discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science, and in recognition of the profound and lasting impact of these contributions on [[additive number theory]] and [[ergodic theory]]”&lt;ref name=abel&gt;{{cite web|title=Hungarian-American Endre Szemerédi named Abel Prize winner|url=http://www.abelprize.no/nyheter/vis.html?tid=54138|publisher=The Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Abel Prize citation also credited Szemerédi with bringing combinatorics to the centre-stage of mathematics and noted his place in the tradition of Hungarian mathematicians such as [[George Pólya]] who emphasized a problem-solving approach to mathematics.&lt;ref name=hindu&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramachandran|first=R.|title=Hungarian mathematician Endre Szemerédi gets 2012 Abel Prize|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/article3025783.ece?homepage=true|accessdate=22 March 2012|newspaper=The Hindu|date=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Szemerédi reacted to the announcement by saying that "It is not my own personal achievement, but recognition for this field of mathematics and Hungarian mathematicians," that gave him the most pleasure.&lt;ref name=nj.com&gt;{{cite news|last=Ellis-Nutt|first=Amy|title=Rutgers math professor's discovery earns prestigious award, $1M prize|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/03/rutgers_math_professors_discov.html|accessdate=22 March 2012|newspaper=NJ.com|date=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Euler calculus''' is a methodology from applied [[algebraic topology]] and [[integral geometry]] that integrates [[constructible function]]s and more recently [[definable function]]s&lt;ref&gt;Baryshnikov, Y.; Ghrist, R. [http://www.pnas.org/content/107/21/9525.full Euler integration for definable functions], ''Proc. National Acad. Sci.'', 107(21), 9525–9530, 25 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; by integrating with respect to the [[Euler characteristic]] as a finitely-additive [[measure theory|measure]].

==Euler integration for constructible functions==

Euler calculus begins from the observation that the Euler characteristic with compact supports obeys one of the main properties of a measure:
&lt;math&gt; \chi(A \cup B) = \chi(A) + \chi(B) - \chi(A \cap B)&lt;/math&gt;. As a result, for a suitably restricted class of functions, it is possible to define an integral with respect to this measure. One begins by selecting an [[o-minimal theory|o-minimal structure]] of ''definable'' sets in the topology, for instance, semialgebraic or subanalytic sets. The class of constructible functions consists of those functions &lt;math&gt;f: X \to \mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(n)&lt;/math&gt; is definable for all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. A definition of the Euler integral follows: 
&lt;math display="block"&gt;\int_X f d\chi = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty n \chi( f^{-1}(n)).&lt;/math&gt;
Due to the properties of the o-minimal structure, the integral may also be computed by decomposing &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; as a sum of indicator functions defined on a disjoint union of cells &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; (giving &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; a cell structure). If &lt;math&gt;f = \sum_{\alpha} n_\alpha \mathbf{1}_{\sigma_\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, then
&lt;math display="block"&gt;\int_X f d\chi = \sum_{\alpha} n_\alpha \chi(\sigma_\alpha).&lt;/math&gt;

A '''frequency-selective surface''' ('''FSS''') is any thin, repetitive surface (such as the screen on a microwave oven) designed to reflect, transmit or absorb electromagnetic fields based on the frequency of the field.  In this sense, an FSS is a type of [[optical filter]] or [[metal-mesh optical filter]]s in which the filtering is accomplished by virtue of the regular, periodic (usually metallic, but sometimes dielectric) pattern on the surface of the FSS. Though not explicitly mentioned in the name, FSS's also have properties which vary with incidence angle and polarization as well - these are unavoidable consequences of the way in which FSS's are constructed.  Frequency-selective surfaces have been most commonly used in the radio frequency region of the electromagnetic spectrum and find use in applications as diverse as the aforementioned [[microwave oven]], [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] [[radome]]s and modern [[metamaterial]]s.  Sometimes frequency selective surfaces are referred to simply as periodic surfaces and are a 2-dimensional analog of the new periodic volumes known as [[photonic crystals]].

Many factors are involved in understanding the operation and application of frequency selective surfaces.  These include analysis techniques, operating principles, design principles, manufacturing techniques and methods for integrating these structures into space, ground and airborne platforms.

== Analysis – first principles approaches ==

=== Spectral domain method of moments (overview and mathematical introduction) ===

==== Background ====

=====History=====

Historically, the first approach to solving for fields reflected and transmitted by FSS was the spectral domain method (SDM), and it is still a valuable tool even today [Scott(1989)].  The spectral domain method is known at Ohio State University as the periodic method of moments (PMM).  The SDM starts out with an assumed Floquet/Fourier series solution for all fields, currents and potentials whereas the PMM starts out with a single scatterer, then adds in all of the scatterers in the infinite plane (in the ''spatial'' domain), then uses a transformation to yield the spectral domain representation of the fields.  Both approaches are effectively the same approach, in the sense that they both assume an infinite planar structure which gives rise to a discrete Fourier series representation for the fields.

=====Advantages and disadvantages=====

The spectral domain method has one very important advantage over other – strictly numerical - solutions to Maxwell's equations for FSS.  And that is that it yields a matrix equation of very small dimensionality, so it is amenable to solution on virtually any type of computer.  The dimension of the matrix is determined by the number of current basis functions on each individual scatterer and can be as small as 1×1 for a dipole at or below resonance.  The matrix elements however take longer to compute than with volumetric approaches such as FEM.  Volumetric approaches require that a volume surrounding the unit cell be gridded accurately, and can require many thousands of elements for an accurate solution, though the matrices are usually sparse.

=====Floquet's principle=====
The spectral domain method is based on Floquet's principle, which implies that when an infinite, planar, periodic structure is illuminated by an infinite plane wave, then every unit cell in the periodic plane must contain exactly the same currents and fields, except for a phase shift, corresponding to the incident field phase.  This principle allows all currents, fields and potentials to be written in terms of a modified Fourier series, which consists of an ordinary Fourier series multiplied by the incident field phase.  If the periodic plane occupies the ''x''-''y'' plane, then the Fourier series is a 2-dimensional Fourier series in&amp;nbsp;''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y''.

=====Plane wave spectrum=====
As in [[Fourier optics]], the Floquet–Fourier series expansion of fields and currents ''in the plane of the FSS'' leads immediately to the discrete plane wave spectrum representation of the fields on either side of the FSS.

==== Field equations for 2D PEC frequency selective surfaces ====

Perfectly electrically conducting (PEC) periodic surfaces are not only the most common but also the easiest to understand mathematically, as they admit only electric current sources '''J'''.  This section presents the spectral domain method for analyzing a free-standing (no substrate) PEC FSS.  The electric field '''E''' is related to the vector magnetic potential '''A''' via the well-known relation (Harrington [2001], Scott [1989], Scott [1997]):

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf E ~ = ~ -j k \eta \left [ \mathbf A + \frac {1}{k^2} \nabla (\nabla \bullet \mathbf A) \right ]  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(1.1) &lt;/math&gt;

and the vector magnetic potential is in turn related to the source currents via (Harrington [2001], Scott [1997]):

: &lt;math&gt;  \nabla^2 \mathbf A + k^2 \mathbf A ~ = ~ -\mathbf J ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ (1.2) &lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;  k^2 ~ = ~ \omega^2 (\mu \epsilon) = (2 \pi / \lambda)^2 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ (1.3) &lt;/math&gt;

==== Plane wave expansion of the fields in source-free media ====

Frequency-selective surfaces are frequently stratified in the direction normal to the plane of the surface.  That is, all dielectrics are stratified and all metallic conductors are considered stratified as well, and they will be regarded as perfectly planar.  As a result, we are excluding metallic vias (wires perpendicular to the plane of the FSS) which could potentially connect currents from different strata of the FSS structure.  With this type of a stratified structure in mind, we can then use a plane wave expansion for the fields in and around the FSS, since plane waves are the eigenfunction solution to the vector wave equations in ''source-free media''.

To solve equations (1.1) and (1.2) for a free-standing, doubly periodic surface, we consider an infinite 2D periodic surface occupying the entire x-y plane, and assume a discrete plane wave expansion for all currents, fields and potentials (Tsao [1982], Scott [1989], [[Fourier optics]]):

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf J(x,y,z) ~ = ~ \sum_{mn} ~ \mathbf J(\alpha_m,\beta_n) ~ e^{j(\alpha_m x + \beta_n y \pm \gamma_{mn} z)} ~~~~~~(2.1a)  &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf E(x,y,z) ~ = ~ \sum_{mn} ~ \mathbf E(\alpha_m,\beta_n) ~ e^{j(\alpha_m x + \beta_n y \pm \gamma_{mn} z)} ~~~~~(2.1b)  &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf A(x,y,z) ~ = ~ \sum_{mn} ~ \mathbf A(\alpha_m,\beta_n) ~ e^{j(\alpha_m x + \beta_n y \pm \gamma_{mn} z)} ~~~~(2.1c)  &lt;/math&gt;

where for mathematical simplicity, we assume a rectangular lattice in which α only depends on ''m'' and  β only depends on ''n''.  In the equations above,

: &lt;math&gt; \alpha_m ~ = ~ k ~ \sin \theta_0 ~ \cos \phi_0 ~ + ~ \frac{2m\pi}{l_x} ~~~~~~~~~~~~(2.2a) &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \beta_n ~ = ~ k ~ \sin \theta_0 ~ \sin \phi_0 ~ + ~ \frac{2n\pi}{l_y} ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(2.2b)  &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \gamma_{mn} ~ = ~ \sqrt{ ~ k^2 ~ - ~ \alpha_m^2 ~ - ~ \beta_n^2}  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(2.2c) &lt;/math&gt;

and,

: &lt;math&gt; k ~ = ~ 2\pi/\lambda  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(2.3) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''l''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''l''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; are the dimensions of the unit cell in the ''x'',''y'' directions respectively, λ is the free space wavelength and θ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, φ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are the directions of an assumed incident plane wave, with the FSS regarded as lying in the ''x''-''y'' plane.  In (2.2c), the root is taken which has a positive real part and non-positive (''i''.''e''., either negative or zero) imaginary part).

==== Integral equation for free-standing PEC FSS ====

Substituting equations (2.1) into (1.1) and (1.2) yields the spectral domain Greens function relating the radiated electric field to its source currents (Scott [1989]), where we now consider only those components of the field vectors lying in the plane of the FSS, the x-y plane:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf E(\alpha_m,\beta_n) ~ = ~ \frac {jk\eta}{\sqrt{k^2-\alpha_m^2-\beta_n^2}} ~ \mathbf G_{mn} ~ \mathbf J(\alpha_m,\beta_n) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(3.1)  &lt;/math&gt;

where,

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf G_{mn} ~ = ~ \left ( \begin{matrix}

1-\frac{\alpha_m^2}{k^2} &amp; -\frac{\alpha_m \beta_n}{k^2}   \\
 -\frac{\alpha_m \beta_n}{k^2} &amp; 1- \frac {\beta_n^2}{k^2}

\end{matrix}
\right )         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(3.2)  &lt;/math&gt;

One notices the branch point singularity in the equation above (the inverse square root singularity), which is no problem thanks to the discrete spectrum, as long as the wavelength never equals the cell spacing.  With this, the electric field boundary condition on the surface of PEC material within a unit cell becomes (Scott [1989]):

: &lt;math&gt; ~ \sum_{mn} ~ \frac {1} \sqrt{k^2-\alpha_m^2-\beta_n^2} ~ \mathbf G_{mnp} ~ \mathbf J(\alpha_m,\beta_n) ~ e^{j(\alpha_m x + \beta_n y )} ~ = ~ - \mathbf E^{inc} (x,y)  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(3.3)  &lt;/math&gt;

where again, we are restricting our attention to the x,y components of currents and fields, which lie in the plane of the scatterer.

Equation (3.3) is not strictly correct, since only the tangential components of electric field are actually zero on the surface of the PEC scatterers.  This inexactness will be resolved presently when (3.3) is tested with the current basis functions, defined as residing on the surface of the scatterer.

In this type of problem, the incident field is considered a plane wave expressed as

: &lt;math&gt; ~ \mathbf E^{inc} (x,y) = ~ \mathbf E^{inc} (\alpha_0, \beta_0)  ~ e^{j(\alpha_0 x + \beta_0 y )} ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(3.4)  &lt;/math&gt;

in the x-y plane.

==== Method of moments (MoM) solution ====

As is usual in the method of moments, we assume an expansion for the source currents over some known set of basis functions with unknown weighting coefficients ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; (Scott [1989]):

: &lt;math&gt; ~ \mathbf J(x,y,z) ~ = ~ \sum_j ~ J_j ~ \mathbf J_j(x,y,z)   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(4.1)  &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting (4.1) into (3.3) and then testing the resulting equation with the ''i''-th current basis function (i.e., dotting from the left and integrating over the domain of the ''i''-th current basis function, thereby completing the quadratic form) produces the ''i''-th row of the matrix equation as (Scott [1989]):

: &lt;math&gt; ~ \sum_j ~ J_j ~\left[~ \sum_{mn} ~ \frac {\mathbf J_i(-\alpha_m,-\beta_n) ~ \mathbf G_{mn} ~ \mathbf J_j(\alpha_m,\beta_n)} \sqrt{k^2-\alpha_m^2-\beta_n^2} \right]~  = ~- \mathbf J_i(-\alpha_0, -\beta_0) ~ \bullet ~ \mathbf E^{inc} (\alpha_0, \beta_0)  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~(4.2)  &lt;/math&gt;

This is the ''i''-th row of the electric field integral equation (EFIE) for a free-standing metallic FSS.  Equation (4.2) may be readily modified for analyzing FSS with surrounding dielectric sheets (substrates and/or superstrates), and even complex multi-layer FSS structures (Scott [1989]).  All of these matrix equations are very simple to implement and require only that the 2D Fourier transform (FT) of the basis functions be computed, preferably in closed form.  There is a striking similarity between eqn. (4.2) above, and the [[Bloch wave – MoM method#Method of moments (MoM) solution|Bloch wave - MoM method eqn. (4.2)]] for computing ω–β diagrams for triply-periodic electromagnetic media such as [[photonic crystals]] (Scott [1998], Scott [2002], available on researchgate.net).  Given this similarity, eqn. (4.2) and its numerous variants in dielectric-layered FSS structures (Scott [1989]) could also be used (with the RHS set to zero) to find surface waves in complex FSS structures.

The RWG (Rao–Wilton–Glisson) basis functions (Rao, Wilton and Glisson [1982]) are a very versatile choice for many purposes and have a transform that is readily computed using [[Barycentric coordinate system#Barycentric coordinates on triangles|area coordinates]].

==== Computing reflection and transmission coefficients ====

Equations (4.2) and (3.1) have been used to solve for the electric current '''J''' and then the scattered fields '''E''' to compute reflection and transmission from various types of FSS (Scott[1989]).  The reflected field is due to the currents on the FSS (the field radiated by the FSS) and the transmitted field is equal to the radiated field plus the incident field, and differs from the reflected field only for the ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 order (the zero order).

== Equivalent circuits – introduction ==

=== Background ===

====Overview====

For wavelengths greater than the FSS lattice dimensions, only one – out of the infinitude of Floquet modes – actually propagates.  All of the others are (exponentially decaying in the z-direction, normal to the plane of the FSS, since the quantity under the root in (2.2c) is negative. And for FSS spacings greater than roughly a tenth of a wavelength or so, these evanescent wave fields have negligible effect on FSS stack performance. So, for practical purposes, in the frequency bands for which we'll be likely to use the FSS, a single propagating wave will be sufficient to capture the significant properties of a multi-layer FSS stack.  This single propagating wave can be modeled in terms of an equivalent transmission line.

The FSS sheet may be represented in terms of lumped RLC networks placed in parallel across the transmission line.    The shunt admittance FSS model is exact only for an infinitesimally thin FSS, for which the tangential electric field is continuous across the FSS; for finite thickness FSS, a tee or pi network can be used as a better approximation.

====Free space as a transmission line====

Both free space and transmission lines admit TEM traveling wave solutions, and even the TE/TM plane waves in free space can be modeled using equivalent transmission line models.  The main thing is that both free space and transmission lines admit traveling wave solutions with a z-dependence of the form:

: &lt;math&gt; ~  e^{\pm  jk z }  &lt;/math&gt;

One can construct equivalent transmission lines as follows:

For TEM waves,

: &lt;math&gt; ~ Z_0 ~=~ \sqrt { \frac {\mu_0} {\epsilon_0}}  &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; ~ k_0 ~=~ \omega \sqrt { \mu_0 \epsilon_0}  &lt;/math&gt;

For TE waves,

: &lt;math&gt; ~ Z_0 ~=~ \sqrt { \frac {\mu_0} {\epsilon_0}} ~/~ \cos \theta   &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; ~ k_0 ~=~\cos \theta ~ \omega \sqrt { \mu_0 \epsilon_0}  &lt;/math&gt;

For TM waves,

: &lt;math&gt; ~ Z_0 ~=~ \sqrt { \frac {\mu_0} {\epsilon_0}} ~ \cos \theta     &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; ~ k_0 ~=~\cos \theta ~ \omega \sqrt { \mu_0 \epsilon_0}  &lt;/math&gt;

where θ is the angle off-normal that the incident wave makes with respect to the FSS.  Z&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; for [[Impedance of free space|free space]] is 377 Ohms.

====Shunt circuit resonators and FSS====

Circuit elements placed in parallel across an equivalent transmission line have some factors in common with thin FSS.  The continuity of tangential electric field condition for thin FSS mirrors the voltage continuity condition on either side of the shunt circuit elements.  The magnetic field jump condition for the FSS mirrors the Kirchhoff current division law for the equivalent circuit.  For sufficiently thick FSS sheets, a more general pi or tee model will likely be required for good approximation to the real FSS.

====Resonant circuits can approximately model resonant scatterers.====

For all but the most tightly packed dipole arrays (the brickwork-like "gangbuster" low-pass filters), a first order understanding of FSS operation can be achieved by simply considering the scattering properties of a single periodic element in free space.  A dipole or patch in free space will strongly reflect energy for wavelengths comparable in size to the object itself, for example when the dipole is 1/2 wavelength in length.  For frequencies below this first resonance (and for frequencies between the first and second resonance), the object will reflect little energy.  So, this resonance phenomenon observed with dipoles and patches leads naturally to the notion of modeling them as a resonant circuit connected in parallel across a transmission line - in this case the element is a series connection of a capacitor and inductor, which produces a reflective short circuit at resonance.  This type of structure would be known as a band-reject or band-stop filter.  Bandpass filters may be constructed using apertures in conducting planes, which are modeled as a shunt element consisting of a parallel connection of an inductor and a capacitor.

One-dimensional line gratings can be modeled as shunt inductors (for polarization parallel to the lines) or shunt capacitors (for polarization perpendicular to the lines).  Tightly packed "gangbuster" dipole arrays are lowpass structures that can be modeled using shunt capacitors.

====Resonant circuit R,L,C values must be determined from first principles analysis====

The exact circuit topology and element values of an equivalent circuit for a FSS sheet have to be determined using first-principles codes.  A bandpass mesh-type FSS sheet is a parallel connection of L,C and bandstop patch-type FSS sheet is a series connection of L,C and in both cases, the L,C values are determined from the center frequency and bandwidth of the filter.

=== Reflection and transmission properties of bandpass and bandstop FSS and equivalent circuits – introduction ===

The equivalent transmission line circuit models for FSS came into being from the observation that FSS yield reflection and transmission properties that are very similar to the reflection and transmission properties of inductors and capacitors placed in parallel across a transmission line.

==== Bandstop FSS filter equivalent circuit and reflection response ====

[[File:Inductive-capacitive-grid-for-metal-mesh-filter.PNG|thumb|400px|Fig. 2.4.1-1. Bandspass mesh FSS (left) and bandstop patch FSS (right)]]

[[File:Bandstop.jpg|thumb|400px|Fig. 2.4.1-2. Equivalent circuit for patch-type bandstop FSS]]

The two fundamental types of FSS are shown in Fig. 2.4.1-1 to the right - the bandpass mesh-type FSS and the bandstop patch-type FSS ([[Metal-mesh optical filters]]).  The equivalent circuit for a patch-type bandstop FSS is shown in Fig. 2.4.1-2.  The impedance of the series connection of the inductor and the capacitor is (Desoer, Kuh [1984]):

: &lt;math&gt;  Z_\text{shunt} ~ = ~ j \omega L ~ + ~ \frac {1} {j \omega C}   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  &lt;/math&gt;

or,

: &lt;math&gt;  Z_\text{shunt} ~ = ~ \frac { 1-\omega^2LC} {j \omega C}   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  &lt;/math&gt;

and this series connection of an inductor and capacitor produces a zero impedance (short circuit) condition when

: &lt;math&gt;  \omega_0^2 ~ = ~ \frac {1} {LC}   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  &lt;/math&gt;

At the short circuit condition, all incident energy is reflected, and so this is the equivalent circuit of a resonant patch bandstop filter.

The magnitude of the reflection coefficient is:

: &lt;math&gt;    |R| = \frac{\omega C Z_0}  {\sqrt{\omega^2  C^2  Z_0^2 ~ + ~ 4~ (1~-~\omega^2 L C)^2 } }   &lt;/math&gt;

where Z&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the characteristic impedance of the transmission line.

The frequencies for the upper and lower 3 dB points are given as the solution to the equation:

: &lt;math&gt;    \omega^2_{1,2}~=~  \frac {-b \pm \sqrt {b^2~-~4ac}} {2a}    &lt;/math&gt;

where,

: &lt;math&gt;    a ~=~  (LC)^2    &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;    b ~=~  -(C^2Z_0^2~/~4~+ ~2LC)   &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;    c ~=~  1    &lt;/math&gt;

So, if the center frequency and the width of the resonance are determined from first principles codes, the L,C of the equivalent circuit may be readily obtained by fitting the reflection response of the equivalent resonant circuit to the reflection response of the actual FSS, and in this way, the circuit parameters L,C are readily extracted.  Once that is done, then we can use the equivalent circuit model for multi-layer FSS design.  Any nearby dielectrics should be included in the equivalent circuit.

For small values of ω, the impedance of the inductor, jωL, is smaller than the impedance of the capacitor, 1/jωC, therefore the capacitor dominates the shunt impedance and so the patch-type bandstop FSS is capacitive below resonance.  We'll use this fact in section 2.3.1 to design a lowpass FSS filter using equivalent circuits.

==== Bandpass FSS filter equivalent circuit and transmission response ====

[[File:Bandpass FSS.jpg|thumb|400px|Fig. 2.4.2-1. Equivalent circuit for mesh-type bandpass FSS]]

The equivalent circuit for a mesh-type bandpass FSS is shown in Fg. 2.4.2-1.  The admittance of the parallel connection of inductor and capacitor is (Desoer, Kuh [1984]):

: &lt;math&gt;  Y_\text{shunt} ~ = ~ \frac {1 - \omega^2 L C} {j \omega L}   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  &lt;/math&gt;

and this admittance is zero (open-circuit condition) when

: &lt;math&gt;  \omega_0^2 ~ = ~ \frac {1} {LC}   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  &lt;/math&gt;

When the parallel combination of inductor and capacitor produces an open circuit, all energy is transmitted.

In the same way, the magnitude of the transmission coefficient of the bandpass filter is:

: &lt;math&gt;    |T| = \frac{2 \omega L / Z_0}  {\sqrt{4 \omega^2  L^2 / Z_0^2 ~ + ~ (1~-~\omega^2 L C)^2 } }   &lt;/math&gt;

Below resonance, the admittance of the inductor, 1/jωL is greater than the admittance of the capacitor jωC, therefore the mesh-type bandpass FSS is inductive below resonance.

==== Comparison of equivalent circuit response and actual FSS response ====

[[File:FSS vs. Eq. Circuit Plot.jpg|thumb|400px|Fig. 2.4.3-1.  Equivalent Circuit Approximation to crossed-dipole bandstop FSS]]

Fig. 2.4.3-1 shows the comparison in reflection between a single-layer crossed dipole FSS and its fitted equivalent circuit.  The equivalent circuit is a series connection of a capacitor and inductor placed in parallel across the transmission line, as in Fig. 2.4.1-2.  This resonator produces a short circuit condition at resonance.  The fit is very good below the resonance though not nearly as good above.

The real FSS has a reflection null at 18.7 GHz (the frequency at which the wavelength equals the unit cell dimension of .630"), which is not accounted for in the equivalent circuit model.  The null is known as a Wood's anomaly and is caused by the inverse square root singularity in the spectral domain Green's function (3.1) going to infinity.  Physically, this represents a uniform plane wave propagating in the plane of the FSS.  In the spatial domain, the coherent summation of all of the spatial domain Green's function's becomes infinite, so that any finite current produces an infinite field on the surface of the FSS.  As a result, all currents must be zero under this condition.

This example illustrates the usefulness and shortcomings of the simple equivalent circuit model.  The equivalent circuit only includes features related to the individual scattering element, not features related to the periodic array, such as interactions between the scatterers.

==== FSS duality versus circuit duality ====

=====FSS duality=====

If a mesh type FSS is created from a patch type FSS in such a way that the metal portions or the former are replaced by aperture portions of the latter, then the two FSS are said to be duals of one another.  Duality only strictly applies when no dielectric substrates are present, therefore it is only approximately satisfied in practice, though even when dielectric substrates are present, duality can be useful in FSS design.  As a side note, Pathological FSS patterns such as a checkerboard FSS may be treated as the limit of the patch and mesh as the patch (and aperture) size approaches the unit cell size, with electrical connections of the mesh retained in the limit. For dual FSS, the reflection coefficient of the patch will be equal to the transmission coefficient of the mesh.

Circuit duality

The dual circuit of the bandstop filter can be obtained simply equating the reflection coefficient of the bandstop FSS to the transmission coefficient of the bandpass FSS to obtain (if we use L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for the bandstop patch FSS and L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for the bandpass mesh FSS):

: &lt;math&gt;    L_2 ~ = ~C_1~ \frac {Z_0^2} {4}     &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;    C_2 ~ = ~L_1~ \frac {4} {Z_0^2}      &lt;/math&gt;

This produces a bandpass circuit (with parameters L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) which is the dual of the bandstop circuit (with parameters L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;).

== FSS equivalent circuits - applications to FSS design ==

Once the transmission line equivalent circuit has been determined, multi-layer FSS design becomes much simpler and more intuitive - like ordinary filter analysis and design.  Now while it is certainly possible to design multi-layer FSS structures using first principles codes and generalized scattering matrices (GSM), it is far easier, quicker and more intuitive to use equivalent circuit models for FSS design, since it is possible to leverage decades' worth of research performed on electrical filter analysis and design and bring it to bear on FSS structures.  And, FSS filters are even easier to design than waveguide filters since the incidence angle does not vary with frequency.

=== Butterworth lowpass filter design using FSS equivalent circuits ===

[[File:Butterworth Filter Prototype Ladder With Series L's and Shunt C's.jpg|thumb|right|Fig. 3.1.1-1. Butterworth Filter: Lowpass Prototype Ladder Network]]

==== Starting point: prototype lumped ''L'', ''C'' Butterworth filter ====

As an example of how to use FSS equivalent circuits for quick and efficient design of a practical filter, we can sketch out the process that would be followed in designing a 5-stage [[Butterworth filter]] (Hunter [2001], Matthaei [1964]) using a stack of 5 frequency selective surfaces, with 4 air spacers in between the FSS sheets.

The lowpass prototype L,C ladder network is shown in Fig. 3.1.1-1 (Hunter [2001]).  The cutoff frequency will be scaled to 7 GHz and the filter will be matched to 377 Ohms (the impedance of free space) on the input and output sides.  The idea we'll follow is that the shunt capacitors will eventually be replaced by sub-resonant (capacitive) patch-type FSS sheets and the series inductors will be replaced by air spacers between the 5 FSS layers.  Short transmission lines are approximately equivalent to series inductors.

[[File:Scaled Butterworth Filter Response.jpg|thumb|right|Fig. 3.1.2-1. Transmission response of scaled butterworth filter.]]

==== Transmission response of prototype lumped ''L'', ''C'' filter ====

The transmission magnitude and phase response of the scaled Butterworth L,C filter is shown in Fig. 3.1.2-1. Transmission magnitude is flat in the passband (below the 7 GHz cutoff frequency) and has a monotonically decreasing skirt on the high frequency side of the passband.  The phase through the filter is linear throughout the 7 GHz passband, making this filter an ideal choice for a linear phase filter application, for example in the design of an ultra-wideband filter that approximates a true time delay transmission line.  This is the baseline lumped L,C filter that will be the starting point for our 5-layer FSS Butterworth filter design.

Now we begin the process of transforming the prototype Butterworth lumped L,C filter into an equivalent FSS Butterworth filter.  Two modifications of the baseline lumped L,C filter will be necessary, in order to obtain the corresponding FSS filter.  First, the series inductors will be replaced by their equivalent transmission line sections, and then the shunt capacitors will be replaced by capacitive frequency selective surfaces.

[[File:Transmission Line Spacers between FSS layers.jpg|thumb|right|Fig. 3.1.3-1. Spacers between capacitors (FSS layers).]]

==== First transformation: replace series inductors with transmission line spacers ====

At this point in the development, the series inductors in the prototype L,C ladder network will now be replaced by sub-half-wavelength air spacers (which we will model as transmission lines) between the FSS layers.  The thickness of the air spacers may be determined as shown in Fig. 3.1.3-1, in which we compare the ABCD matrix of a series inductor with the ABCD matrix of a short transmission line (Ramo [1994]), in order to obtain the proper length of transmission line between the shunt capacitors (sub-resonant FSS layers) to produce a Butterworth filter response.  It is well known that a series inductor represents an approximate lumped circuit model of a short transmission line, and we'll exploit this equivalence to determine the required thickness of the air spacers.

With the thickness of the air spacers between sheets now determined, the equivalent circuit now takes on the form shown in Fig. 3.1.4-1:

[[File:Butterworth Transmission Line Filter.jpg|thumb|right|Fig. 3.1.4-1.  Butterworth transmission line filter.]]

==== Second transformation: Replace shunt capacitors with capacitive patch FSS below resonance ====

Now the only thing left to do is to find the lowpass FSS that yields the shunt capacitance values called out in Fig. 2.3.1-4.  This is usually done through trial and error.  Fitting a shunt capacitor to a real FSS is done by repeated running of a first principles code to match the reflection response of the shunt capacitor with the reflection from a capacitive FSS.  Patch-type FSS below resonance will produce a capacitive shunt admittance equivalent circuit, with closer packing of elements in the FSS sheet yielding higher shunt capacitance values in the equivalent circuit.

== Examples ==

FSS can seemingly take on a nearly infinite number of forms, depending on the application.  And now FSS are being used in the development of certain classes of meta-materials.

=== Classification: by form or by function ===

FSS are typically resonance region structures (wavelength comparable to element size and spacing). FSS can be classified either by their form or by their function.  Morphologically, Munk (Munk [200]) classified FSS elements into 2 broad categories: those that are "wire-like" (one-dimensional) and those that are "patch-like" (two-dimensional) in appearance.  His lifelong preference was for the one-dimensional wire-like FSS structures, and they do seem to have advantages for many applications.  Frequency selective surfaces, as any type of filter, may also be classified according to their function, and these usually fall into 3 categories: low-pass, high-pass and bandpass, in addition to band-stop filters.  FSS may be made to be absorptive as well, and absorption is usually over some frequency band.

=== Elements ===

A number of FSS scatterer configurations are now known, ranging from early types such as resonant dipoles, disks and squares to crossed dipoles, Jerusalem crosses, four-legged loaded slots and tripoles,

=== Low-pass ===

The FSS reflection and transmission properties are determined by both the individual scatterer and the lattice.

=== Band-stop or band-reject ===

=== Bandpass ===

{{Empty section|date=December 2014|section=}}

=== Angular filters ===

=== AFA stacks ===

== Fabrication ==

Typically FSSs are fabricated by chemically etching a copper-clad dielectric sheet, which may consist of Teflon (ε=2.1), Kapton, (ε=3.1), fiberglass (ε-4.5) or various forms of duroid (ε=6.0, 10.2).  The sheet may range in thickness from a few thousandths of an inch to as much as 20–40 thousand.

== Applications ==

Applications of FSS range from the mundane (microwave ovens) to the forefront of contemporary technology involving active and reconfigurable structures such as smart skins.

'''George Neville Watson''' (31 January 1886 – 2 February 1965) was an English mathematician, who applied [[complex analysis]] to the theory of [[special function]]s. His collaboration on the 1915 second edition of [[E. T. Whittaker]]'s ''A Course of Modern Analysis'' (1902) produced the classic "[[Whittaker and Watson]]" text. In 1918 he proved a significant result known as [[Watson's lemma]], that has many applications in the theory on the asymptotic behaviour of [[Exponential function|exponential]] [[integrals]].&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rankin | first1 = R.

==Education==
He was educated at [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]], as a pupil of [[F. S. Macaulay]], and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. There he encountered Whittaker, though their overlap was only two years. He became Professor at the [[University of Birmingham]] in 1918, where he remained until 1951.

He was awarded an [[honorary degree|honorary]] MSc Pure Science in 1919 by Birmingham University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University campus Blue Plaque Trail|url=http://bhamalumni.org/NetCommunity/Page.aspx?pid=1111&amp;frcrld=1|publisher=Birmingham University|accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
His ''Treatise on the theory of Bessel functions'' (1922)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Carmichael, R. D.|authorlink=Robert Daniel Carmichael|title=Review: ''A Treatise on the Theory of Bessel Functions'', by G. N. Watson|journal=Bull. Amer. Math. Soc.|year=1924|volume=30|issue=7|pages=362–364|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1924-30-07/S0002-9904-1924-03906-8/|doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1924-03906-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; also became a classic, in particular in regard to the [[asymptotic expansion]]s of [[Bessel function]]s.

He subsequently spent many years on [[Ramanujan]]'s formulae in the area of [[Modular form#Modular functions|modular equations]], [[mock theta function]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Watson, G. N.|title=The mock theta functions (2)|journal=Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society|year=1937|volume=2|issue=1|pages=274–304|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1112/plms/s2-42.1.274/abstract|doi=10.1112/plms/s2-42.1.274}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Q-Pochhammer symbol#q-series|q-series]], and for some time looked after [[Ramanujan's lost notebook]].

{{blockquote|Sometime in the late 1920s, G. N. Watson and [[Bertram Martin Wilson|B. M. Wilson]] began the task of editing Ramanujan's notebooks. The second notebook, being a revised, enlarged edition of the first, was their primary focus. Wilson was assigned Chapters 2–14, and Watson was to examine Chapters 15–21. Wilson devoted his efforts to this task until 1935, when he died from an infection at the early age of 38. Watson wrote over 30 papers inspired by the notebooks before his interest evidently waned in the late 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Berndt, Bruce C.|title=An overview of Ramanujan's notebooks|page=3|postscript=; paper delivered at Proc.

Ramanujan discovered many more modular equations than all of his mathematical predecessors combined. Watson provided proofs for most of Ramanujan's modular equations. [[Bruce C. Berndt]] completed the project begun by Watson and Wilson. Much of Berndt's book ''Ramanujan's Notebooks, Part 3'' (1998) is based upon the prior work of Watson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite|url=http://eprints.uni-mysore.ac.in/9771/|author=Adiga, B.|author2=Berndt, B.

Watson's interests included solvable cases of the [[quintic equation]]. He introduced [[Watson's quintuple product identity]].

==Honours and awards==
Watson was elected in 1919 to the [[Royal Society]],&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; and in 1946, he received the [[Sylvester Medal]] from the Society. He was president of the [[London Mathematical Society]] from 1933 to 1935.

He is sometimes confused with the mathematician [[George Leo Watson|G. L. Watson]], who worked on quadratic forms, and [[G. Watson]], a statistician.

[[File:Galactic longitude.JPG|thumb|300px|Longitudinal lines of the [[galactic coordinate system]].]]

A '''galactic quadrant''', or '''quadrant of the Galaxy''', is one of four [[circular sector]]s in the division of the [[Milky Way]] Galaxy.

==Quadrants in the galactic coordinate system==
In actual astronomical practice, the delineation of the galactic quadrants is based upon the [[galactic coordinate system]], which places the [[Sun]] as the [[polar coordinates|pole of the mapping system]]. The Sun is used instead of the [[Galactic Center]] for practical reasons since all astronomical observations (by [[human]]s) to date have been based on [[Earth]] or within the [[solar system]].

===Delineation===
Quadrants are described using [[Ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinals]]—for example, "1st galactic quadrant"&lt;ref name=toolsofradio&gt;Thomas L.

=== Visibility of each quadrant ===
[[File:Celestial.png|right|thumb|Orientation of the galactic, [[Ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic]] and [[equatorial coordinate system]]s, projected on the [[celestial sphere]].]]

Due to the orientation of the Earth with respect to the rest of the Galaxy, the 2nd galactic quadrant is primarily only visible from the [[northern hemisphere]] while the 4th galactic quadrant is mostly only visible from the [[southern hemisphere]]. Thus, it is usually more practical for [[Amateur astronomy|amateur stargazers]] to use the [[Quadrant (astronomy)|celestial quadrants]]. Nonetheless, cooperating or international astronomical organizations are not so bound by the Earth's [[horizon]].

Based on a view from Earth, one may look towards major [[constellation]]s for a rough sense of where the borders of the quadrants are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkastronomy.com/M13/Manual/common/galactic_coords.html |title=Galactic Coordinates |publisher=Thinkastronomy.com |accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Note: by drawing a line through the following, one can also approximate the [[Galactic coordinate system#Definition|galactic equator]].)
* For 0°, look towards the [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]] constellation. (The galactic center)
* For 90°, look towards the [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]] constellation.
* For 180°, look towards the [[Auriga (constellation)|Auriga]] constellation. (The [[galactic anticenter]])
* For 270°, look towards the [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]] constellation.

==Traditional fourfold divisions of the skies==
{{Expand section|date=August 2010}}

A long tradition of dividing the visible skies into four precedes the modern definitions of four galactic quadrants. Ancient Mesopotamian formulae spoke of "the four corners of the universe" and of "the heaven's four corners",&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
and the Biblical [[Book of Jeremiah]] echoes this phraseology: "And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven" (Jeremiah,  49:36). [[Astrology]] too uses [[House (astrology)#Quadrant house systems|quadrant system]]s to divide up its stars of interest. And the astronomy of the location of [[constellation]]s sees each of the Northern and Southern [[celestial hemisphere]]s divided into four quadrants.

==In fiction==
=== ''Star Trek'' ===
{{see also| Galactic quadrant (Star Trek)}}
"Galactic quadrants" within ''[[Star Trek]]'' are based around a [[Meridian (astronomy)|meridian]] that runs from the center of the Galaxy through Earth's [[solar system]],&lt;ref name="Encyc"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Star Trek Encyclopedia]]|first=Michael|last=Okuda|authorlink=Michael Okuda |first2=Denise|last2=Okuda |first3=Debbie|last3=Mirek |publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|isbn=978-0-671-53609-1|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is not unlike the system used by astronomers. However, rather than have the [[perpendicular]] [[Cartesian coordinate system|axis]] run through the Sun, as is done in astronomy, the ''Star Trek'' version runs the axis through the galactic center. In that sense, the ''Star Trek'' quadrant system is less [[geocentric]] as a [[cartographical]] system than the standard. Also, rather than use ordinals, ''Star Trek'' designates them by the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] letters [[Alpha (letter)|Alpha]], [[Beta (letter)|Beta]], [[Gamma]], and [[Delta (letter)|Delta]].

The Canadian Galactic Plane Survey (CGPS) created a [[Radio astronomy|radio]] map of the Galaxy based on ''Star Trek''{{'}}s quadrants, joking that "the CGPS is primarily concerned with [[Cardassia]], while the SGPS (Southern Galactic Plane Survey) focuses on [[Romulans]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ras.ucalgary.ca/CGPS/where/plan/ |work=The Canadian Galactic Plane Survey |title=Plan Views of the Milky Way Galaxy |publisher=Ras.ucalgary.ca |accessdate=2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir George Howard Darwin''', [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath|KCB]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]], [[FRSE]] (9 July 1845 – 7 December 1912)&lt;ref&gt;GRO Register of Deaths: DEC 1912 3b 552 CAMBRIDGE – George H. Darwin, aged 67&lt;/ref&gt; was an English barrister and [[astronomer]], the second son and fifth child of [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Emma Darwin]].

==Biography==
George H. Darwin was born at [[Down House]], Kent, the fifth child of geneticist [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Emma Darwin]].

From the age of 11 he studied under [[Charles Pritchard]] at [[Clapham]] Grammar School, and entered [[St John's College, Cambridge]], in 1863, though he soon moved to [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]],&lt;ref name="Venn"&gt;{{acad|id=DRWN863GH|name=Darwin, George Howard}}&lt;/ref&gt; where his tutor was [[Edward John Routh]]. He graduated as [[second wrangler]] in 1868, when he was also placed second for the [[Smith's Prize]] and was appointed to a college fellowship. He earned his M.A. in 1871.&lt;ref name="Venn"/&gt; He was admitted to the bar in 1872, but returned to science.&lt;ref name="Venn"/&gt; 
George Darwin conducted studies into the prevalence and health outcomes of contemporary first-cousin marriages in Great Britain. His father Charles had become concerned after the death of three of his children, including his favorite daughter, Annie, from tuberculosis in 1851, that his and Emma’s union may have been a mistake from a biological perspective. He was reassured by George's results.&lt;ref&gt;George H Darwin.

In 1879, he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] and won their [[Royal Medal]] in 1884 and their [[Copley Medal]] in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=5&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27darwin%27%29 |title=Library and Archive Catalogue |publisher=Royal Society |accessdate=29 December 2010 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He delivered their [[Bakerian Lecture]] in 1891 on the subject of "tidal prediction".

In 1883 Darwin became [[Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy]] at the [[University of Cambridge]]. He studied [[tidal forces]] involving the [[Sun]], [[Moon]], and [[Earth]], and formulated the [[Moon#Formation|fission theory of Moon formation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9029407/Sir-George-Darwin Britannica.com: Sir George Darwin]&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin was a Fellow of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] (RAS) and won the [[Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society|Gold Medal of the RAS]] in 1892. From 1899–1901 he served as [[President of the Royal Astronomical Society|President of the RAS]]. The RAS founded a prize lectureship in 1984 and named it the [[George Darwin Lectureship]] in Darwin's honour.

He was an invited speaker in the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] 1908, Rome on the topic of "''Mechanics, Physical Mathematics, Astronomy''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICM Plenary and Invited Speakers since 1897|url=http://www.mathunion.org/db/ICM/Speakers/SortedByCongress.php|publisher=[[International Congress of Mathematicians]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As President of the [[Cambridge Philosophical Society]], he also gave the Introductory Address to the Congress in 1912 on the character of pure and applied mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hobson, E.

Love, eds.|title=Proceedings of the Fifth International Congress of Mathematicians (Cambridge, 22-28 August 1912)|date=1913|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=33–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He received the degree of ''Doctor mathematicae ([[honoris causa]])'' from the [[Royal Frederick University]] on 6 September 1902, when they celebrated the centennial of the birth of [[mathematician]] [[Niels Henrik Abel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Foreign degrees for British men of Science |day_of_week=Monday |date=8 September 1902 |page_number=4 |issue=36867| }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uio.no/om/tall-og-fakta/aresdoktorer/tidligere-aresdoktorer/1902-1910/ |title=Honorary doctorates from the University of Oslo 1902-1910}} ''(in Norwegian)''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

Darwin married [[Maud Darwin|Martha (Maud) du Puy]], the daughter of Charles du Puy of [[Philadelphia]], in 1884;
his wife was a member of the [[Ladies Dining Society]] in Cambridge, with 11 other members.

She died on 6 February 1947. They had three sons and two daughters:

* [[Gwen Raverat]] (1885–1957), artist.
* [[Sir Charles Galton Darwin]] (1887–1962), physicist and applied mathematician.
* Margaret Elizabeth Darwin (1890–1974), married Sir [[Geoffrey Keynes]].
* William Robert Darwin (1894–1970)
* Leonard Darwin (1899–1899)

George and Maud Darwin bought [[Newnham Grange]], Cambridge in 1885. The Darwins extensively remodelled the house.  Since 1962 the Grange has been part of [[Darwin College, Cambridge]].

He is buried in Trumpington Extension Cemetery in Cambridge with his son Leonard and his daughter Gwen (Raverat), his wife Lady [[Maud Darwin]] was cremated at Cambridge Crematorium; his brothers Sir [[Francis Darwin]] and Sir [[Horace Darwin]] and their respective wives are interred in the [[Ascension Parish Burial Ground, Cambridge|Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground]].

In [[graph theory]], the '''Golomb graph''' is a [[polyhedral graph]] with 10 [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] and 18 [[edge (graph theory)|edges]]. It is named after [[Solomon W. Golomb]], who constructed it (with a non-[[planar graph|planar]] embedding) as a [[unit distance graph]] that requires four colors in any [[graph coloring]]. Thus, like the simpler [[Moser spindle]], it provides a lower bound for the [[Hadwiger–Nelson problem]]: coloring the points of the [[Euclidean plane]] so that each unit [[line segment]] has differently-colored endpoints requires at least four colors.{{r|soifer}}

==Construction==

[[File:GolombGraphProperties.svg|thumb|4-coloring of the Golomb graph, drawn as a unit distance graph]]
The method of construction of the Golomb graph as a unit distance graph, by drawing an outer regular polygon connected to an inner twisted polygon or star polygon, has also been used for unit distance representations of the [[Petersen graph]] and of [[generalized Petersen graph]]s.{{r|zhp}} As with the Moser spindle, the coordinates of the unit-distance embedding of the Golomb graph can be represented in the [[quadratic field]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{33}]&lt;/math&gt;.{{r|pegg}}

==Fractional coloring==

The [[fractional chromatic number]] of the Golomb graph is 10/3. The fact that this number is at least this large follows from the fact that the graph has 10 vertices, at most three of which can be in any independent set. The fact that the number is at most this large follows from the fact that one can find 10 three-vertex independent sets, such that each vertex is in exactly three of these sets.
This fractional chromatic number is less than the number 7/2 for the Moser spindle and less than the fractional chromatic number of the unit distance graph of the plane, which is bounded between 3.6190 and 4.3599.{{r|cranrab}}

In [[quantum computation]] the '''Hadamard test''' is a method used to create a random variable whose [[expected value]] is the expected [[real part]] of the observed value of a state with respect to some [[unitary matrix|unitary operator]].

Let &lt;math&gt;\left|\alpha\right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; be a state which can be efficiently generated, and let &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; be a [[quantum gate|unitary gate]]. The Hadamard test produces a random variable whose image is in &lt;math&gt;\{\pm 1\}&lt;/math&gt; and whose expected value is exactly &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Re}\left\langle\alpha\mid Q\mid\alpha\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. A variant of the test produces a random variable whose expected value is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Im}\left\langle\alpha\mid Q\mid\alpha\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

To perform the Hadamard test we first calculate the state &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\left|0\right\rangle +\left|1\right\rangle \right)\otimes\left|\alpha\right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;. We then apply the unitary operator on &lt;math&gt;\left|\alpha\right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; conditioned on the first qubit to obtain the state &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\left|0\right\rangle \otimes\left|\alpha\right\rangle +\left|1\right\rangle \otimes Q\left|\alpha\right\rangle \right)&lt;/math&gt;. We then apply the [[Quantum Gate#Hadamard gate|Hadamard gate]] to the first qubit, yielding &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\left(\left|0\right\rangle \otimes(I+Q)\left|\alpha\right\rangle +\left|1\right\rangle \otimes (I-Q)\left|\alpha\right\rangle \right)&lt;/math&gt;. 

Measuring the first qubit, the result is &lt;math&gt;\left|1\right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; with probability &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{4}\left\langle\alpha\mid (I+Q^\dagger)(I+Q)\mid\alpha\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, in which case we output &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. The result is &lt;math&gt;\left|0\right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; with probability &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{4}\left\langle\alpha\mid (I-Q^\dagger)(I-Q)\mid\alpha\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, in which case we output &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt;. The expected value of the output will then be the difference between the two probabilities, which is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\left\langle\alpha\mid (Q^\dagger+Q)\mid\alpha\right\rangle=\mathcal{Re}\left\langle\alpha\mid Q\mid\alpha\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

To obtain a random variable whose expectation is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Im}\left\langle\alpha\mid Q\mid\alpha\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; follow the exact same procedure but start with &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\left|0\right\rangle -i\left|1\right\rangle \right)\otimes\left|\alpha\right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;.

The Hadamard test has many applications in quantum algorithms such as the [[Aharonov-Jones-Landau algorithm]].

{{unsolved|mathematics|Does every graph with [[chromatic number]] &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; have a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-vertex [[complete graph]] as a [[Minor (graph theory)|minor]]?}}
[[File:Hadwiger conjecture.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|A graph that requires four colors in any coloring, and four connected subgraphs that, when contracted, form a complete graph, illustrating the case ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4 of Hadwiger's conjecture]]
In [[graph theory]], the '''Hadwiger conjecture''' (or '''Hadwiger's conjecture''') states that, if all [[graph coloring|proper colorings]] of an [[undirected graph]] ''G'' use ''k'' or more colors, then one can find ''k'' [[disjoint set|disjoint]] [[connected graph|connected]] [[Glossary of graph theory#Subgraphs|subgraphs]] of ''G'' such that each subgraph is connected by an [[edge (graph theory)|edge]] to each other subgraph. Contracting the edges within each of these subgraphs so that each subgraph collapses to a single vertex produces a [[complete graph]] ''K&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' on ''k'' vertices as a [[minor (graph theory)|minor]] of ''G''.

This conjecture, a far-reaching generalization of the [[four-color problem]], was made by [[Hugo Hadwiger]] in 1943 and is still unsolved. {{harvtxt|Bollobás|Catlin|Erdős|1980}} call it “one of the deepest unsolved problems in graph theory.”&lt;ref name="BolCatErd1980" /&gt;

==Equivalent forms==
An equivalent form of the Hadwiger conjecture (the [[contrapositive]] of the form stated above) is that, if there is no sequence of [[edge contraction]]s (each merging the two endpoints of some edge into a single supervertex) that brings a graph ''G'' to the complete graph ''K&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', then ''G'' must have a vertex coloring with ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 colors.

Note that, in a [[complete coloring|minimal]] ''k''-coloring of any graph ''G'', contracting each color class of the coloring to a single vertex will produce a complete graph ''K&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''. However, this contraction process does not produce a minor of ''G'' because there is (by definition) no edge between any two vertices in the same color class, thus the contraction is not an [[edge contraction]] (which is required for minors). Hadwiger's conjecture states that there exists a different way of properly edge contracting sets of vertices to single vertices, producing a complete graph ''K&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', in such a way that all the contracted sets are connected.

If ''F&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' denotes the family of graphs having the property that all minors of graphs in ''F&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be (''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-colored, then it follows from the [[Robertson–Seymour theorem]] that ''F&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be characterized by a finite set of [[Forbidden graph characterization|forbidden minors]]. Hadwiger's conjecture is that this set consists of a single forbidden minor, ''K&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''.

The [[Hadwiger number]] ''h''(''G'') of a graph ''G'' is the size ''k'' of the largest complete graph ''K&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' that is a minor of ''G'' (or equivalently can be obtained by contracting edges of ''G''). It is also known as the '''contraction clique number''' of ''G''.&lt;ref name="BolCatErd1980"&gt;{{harvtxt|Bollobás|Catlin|Erdős|1980}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hadwiger conjecture can be stated in the simple algebraic form ''χ''(''G'')&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''h''(''G'') where ''χ''(''G'') denotes the [[chromatic number]] of ''G''.

==Special cases and partial results==
The case where ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 is trivial: a graph requires more than one color if and only if it has an edge, and that edge is itself a ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; minor. The case ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 is also easy: the graphs requiring three colors are the non-[[bipartite graph]]s, and every non-bipartite graph has an odd [[cycle (graph theory)|cycle]], which can be contracted to a 3-cycle, that is, a ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; minor.

In the same paper in which he introduced the conjecture, Hadwiger proved its truth for ''k''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;4. The graphs with no ''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; minor are the [[series-parallel graph]]s and their subgraphs. Each graph of this type has a vertex with at most two incident edges; one can 3-color any such graph by removing one such vertex, coloring the remaining graph recursively, and then adding back and coloring the removed vertex. Because the removed vertex has at most two edges, one of the three colors will always be available to color it when the vertex is added back.

The truth of the conjecture for ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5 implies the [[four color theorem]]: for, if the conjecture is true, every graph requiring five or more colors would have a ''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; minor and would (by [[Wagner's theorem]]) be nonplanar.
[[Klaus Wagner (mathematician)|Klaus Wagner]] proved in 1937 that the case ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5 is actually equivalent to the four color theorem and therefore we now know it to be true. As Wagner showed, every graph that has no ''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; minor can be decomposed via [[clique-sum]]s into pieces that are either planar or an 8-vertex [[Möbius ladder]], and each of these pieces can be 4-colored independently of each other, so the 4-colorability of a ''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-minor-free graph follows from the 4-colorability of each of the planar pieces.

{{harvtxt|Robertson|Seymour|Thomas|1993}} proved the conjecture for ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6, also using the four color theorem; their paper with this proof won the 1994 [[Fulkerson Prize]]. It follows from their proof that [[linkless embedding|linklessly embeddable graphs]], a three-dimensional analogue of planar graphs, have chromatic number at most five.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nešetřil|Thomas|1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this result, the conjecture is known to be true for ''k''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;6, but it remains unsolved for all ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;6.

For ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;7, some partial results are known: every 7-chromatic graph must contain either a ''K''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; minor or both a ''K''&lt;sub&gt;4,4&lt;/sub&gt; minor and a ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3,5&lt;/sub&gt; minor.&lt;ref&gt;The existence of either a ''K''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; or ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3,5&lt;/sub&gt; minor was shown by [[Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi]], and {{harvtxt|Kawarabayashi|Toft|2005}} proved the existence of either a ''K''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; or ''K''&lt;sub&gt;4,4&lt;/sub&gt; minor.&lt;/ref&gt;

Every graph ''G'' has a vertex with at most O(''h''(''G'')&amp;nbsp;{{radic|log ''h''(''G'')}}) incident edges,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kostochka|1984}}. The letter O in this expression invokes [[big O notation]].&lt;/ref&gt; from which it follows that a [[greedy coloring]] algorithm that removes this low-degree vertex, colors the remaining graph, and then adds back the removed vertex and colors it, will color the given graph with O(''h''(''G'')&amp;nbsp;{{radic|log ''h''(''G'')}}) colors.

{{harvtxt|Van der Zypen|2012}} has constructed a graph ''H'' with ''χ(H)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[[ordinal number|ω]]'' but no ''K&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;'' minor, demonstrating that the conjecture does ''not'' hold for graphs with countably infinite coloring number.

==Generalizations==
[[György Hajós]] conjectured that Hadwiger's conjecture could be strengthened to [[Homeomorphism (graph theory)|subdivisions]] rather than minors: that is, that every graph with chromatic number ''k'' contains a subdivision of a complete graph ''K&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''. Hajós' conjecture is true for ''k'' ≤ 4, but {{harvtxt|Catlin|1979}} found counterexamples to this strengthened conjecture for ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;7; the cases ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5 and ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6 remain open.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Yu|Zickfeld|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvtxt|Erdős|Fajtlowicz|1981}} observed that Hajós' conjecture fails badly for [[random graph]]s: for any ε&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0, in the limit as the number of vertices, ''n'', goes to infinity, the probability approaches one that a random ''n''-vertex graph has chromatic number ≥&amp;nbsp;(1/2&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;ε)''n''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n'', and that its largest clique subdivision has at most ''cn''&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; vertices for some constant ''c''. In this context it is worth noting that the probability also approaches one that a random ''n''-vertex graph has Hadwiger number greater than or equal to its chromatic number, so the Hadwiger conjecture holds for random graphs with high probability; more precisely, the Hadwiger number is with high probability a constant times ''n''/{{radic|log&amp;nbsp;''n''}}.&lt;ref name="BolCatErd1980"/&gt;

{{harvtxt|Borowiecki|1993}} asked whether Hadwiger's conjecture could be extended to [[list coloring]]. For ''k''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;4, every graph with list chromatic number ''k'' has a ''k''-vertex clique minor. However, the maximum list chromatic number of planar graphs is 5, not 4, so the extension fails already for ''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-minor-free graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Voigt|1993}}; {{harvtxt|Thomassen|1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, for every ''t''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1, there exist graphs whose Hadwiger number is 3''t''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 and whose list chromatic number is 4''t''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Barát|Joret|Wood|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerards and Seymour conjectured that every graph ''G'' with chromatic number ''k'' has a complete graph ''K&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' as an ''odd minor''. Such a structure can be represented as a family of ''k'' vertex-disjoint subtrees of ''G'', each of which is two-colored, such that each pair of subtrees is connected by a monochromatic edge. Although graphs with no odd ''K&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' minor are not necessarily [[sparse graph|sparse]], a similar upper bound holds for them as it does for the standard Hadwiger conjecture: a graph with no odd ''K&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' minor has chromatic number ''χ''(''G'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;O(k&amp;nbsp;{{radic|log&amp;nbsp;''k''}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Geelen|Gerards|Reed|Seymour|2006}}; Kawarabayashi (Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B, Volume 99, Issue 1, January 2009, Pages 20-29).&lt;/ref&gt;

By imposing extra conditions on ''G'', it may be possible to prove the existence of larger minors than ''K&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''. One example is the [[Snark (graph theory)|snark theorem]], that every [[cubic graph]] requiring four colors in any [[edge coloring]] has the [[Petersen graph]] as a minor, conjectured by [[W. T. Tutte]] and announced to be proved in 2001 by Robertson, Sanders, Seymour, and Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Pegg|first=Ed, Jr.|authorlink=Ed Pegg, Jr.|title=Book Review: The Colossal Book of Mathematics|journal=Notices of the American Mathematical Society|volume=49|issue=9|year=2002|pages=1084–1086|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200209/rev-pegg.pdf | doi = 10.1109/TED.2002.1003756|bibcode=2002ITED...49.1084A}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15594">'''Hilbert's Nullstellensatz''' (German for "theorem of zeros," or more literally, "zero-locus-theorem"—see ''[[wikt:Satz|Satz]]'') is a theorem that establishes a fundamental relationship between [[geometry]] and [[algebra]]. This relationship is the basis of [[algebraic geometry]], a branch of [[mathematics]]. It relates [[algebraic set]]s to [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] in [[polynomial ring]]s over [[algebraically closed field]]s. This relationship was discovered by [[David Hilbert]] who proved the Nullstellensatz and several other important related theorems named after him (like [[Hilbert's basis theorem]]).

== Formulation ==
Let ''k'' be a field (such as the [[rational number]]s) and ''K'' be an algebraically closed field extension (such as the [[complex number]]s), consider the [[polynomial ring]] ''k''[''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] and let ''I'' be an [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] in this ring. The [[algebraic set]] V(''I'') defined by this ideal consists of all ''n''-tuples '''x''' = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) in ''K''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; such that ''f''('''x''') = 0 for all ''f'' in ''I''. Hilbert's Nullstellensatz states that if ''p'' is some polynomial in ''k''[''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] that vanishes on the algebraic set V(''I''), i.e. ''p''('''x''') = 0 for all '''x''' in ''V''(''I''), then there exists a [[natural number]] ''r'' such that ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; is in ''I''.

An immediate corollary is the "weak Nullstellensatz": The ideal ''I'' in ''k''[''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] contains 1 if and only if the polynomials in ''I'' do not have any common zeros in ''K''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. It may also be formulated as follows:
if ''I'' is a proper ideal in ''k''[''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;], then V(''I'') cannot be [[empty set|empty]], i.e. there exists a common zero for all the polynomials in the ideal in every algebraically closed extension of ''k''. This is the reason for the name of the theorem, which can be proved easily from the 'weak' form using the [[Rabinowitsch trick]]. The assumption of considering common zeros in an algebraically closed field is essential here; for example, the elements of the proper ideal (''X''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1) in '''R'''[''X''] do not have a common zero in '''R'''.
With the notation common in algebraic geometry, the Nullstellensatz can also be formulated as
:&lt;math&gt;\hbox{I}(\hbox{V}(J))=\sqrt{J}&lt;/math&gt;
for every ideal ''J''. Here, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{J}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[radical of an ideal|radical]] of ''J'' and I(''U'') is the ideal of all polynomials that vanish on the set ''U''.

In this way, we obtain an order-reversing [[bijective]] correspondence between the algebraic sets in ''K''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and the [[radical ideal]]s of ''K''[''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]. In fact, more generally, one has a [[Galois connection]] between subsets of the space and subsets of the algebra, where "[[Zariski closure]]" and "radical of the ideal generated" are the [[closure operator]]s.

As a particular example, consider a point &lt;math&gt;P = (a_1, \dots, a_n) \in K^n&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;I(P) = (X_1 - a_1, \dots, X_n - a_n)&lt;/math&gt;. More generally,
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{I} = \bigcap_{(a_1, \dots, a_n) \in V(I)}  (X_1 - a_1, \dots, X_n - a_n).&lt;/math&gt;
Conversely, every [[maximal ideal]] of the polynomial ring &lt;math&gt;K[X_1,\dots,X_n]&lt;/math&gt; (note that &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is algebraically closed) is of the form &lt;math&gt;(X_1 - a_1, \dots, X_n - a_n)&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;a_1,\dots,a_n \in K&lt;/math&gt;.

As another example, an algebraic subset ''W'' in ''K''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is irreducible (in the Zariski topology) if and only if &lt;math&gt;I(W)&lt;/math&gt; is a prime ideal.

== Proof and generalization ==
There are many known proofs of the theorem. One proof &lt;!-- due to Zariski? --&gt; uses [[Zariski's lemma]], which asserts that, if a field is [[finitely generated algebra|finitely generated]] as an [[associative algebra]] over a field ''k'', then it is a [[finite field extension]] of ''k'' (that is, it is also finitely generated as a [[vector space]]). Here is a sketch of this proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah-MacDonald|1969|loc=Ch. 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;A = k[t_1, \ldots, t_n]&lt;/math&gt; (''k'' algebraically closed field), ''I'' an ideal of ''A'' and ''V'' the common zeros of ''I'' in &lt;math&gt;k^n&lt;/math&gt;. Clearly, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{I} \subseteq I(V)&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;f \not\in \sqrt{I}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;f \not\in \mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; for some prime ideal &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}\supseteq I&lt;/math&gt; in ''A''. Let &lt;math&gt;R = (A/\mathfrak{p}) [f^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; a maximal ideal in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. By Zariski's lemma, &lt;math&gt;R/\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; is a finite extension of ''k''; thus, is ''k'' since ''k'' is algebraically closed. Let &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; be the images of &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt; under the natural map &lt;math&gt;A \to k&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that &lt;math&gt;x = (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \in V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(x) \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;.

The Nullstellensatz will also follow trivially once one systematically developed the theory of a [[Jacobson ring]], a ring in which a radical ideal is an intersection of maximal ideals. Let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; be a Jacobson ring. If &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a finitely generated [[associative algebra|''R''-algebra]], then &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a Jacobson ring. Further, if &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{n}\subset S&lt;/math&gt; is a maximal ideal, then &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m} := \mathfrak{n} \cap R&lt;/math&gt; is a maximal ideal of R, and &lt;math&gt;S/\mathfrak{n}&lt;/math&gt; is a finite extension field of &lt;math&gt;R/\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt;.

Another generalization states that a faithfully flat morphism of schemes &lt;math&gt;f: Y \to X&lt;/math&gt; locally of finite type with ''X'' quasi-compact has a ''quasi-section'', i.e. there exists &lt;math&gt;X'&lt;/math&gt; affine and faithfully flat and quasi-finite over ''X'' together with an ''X''-morphism &lt;math&gt;X' \to Y&lt;/math&gt;

== Effective Nullstellensatz ==
In all of its variants, Hilbert's Nullstellensatz asserts that some polynomial {{mvar|g}} belongs or not to an ideal generated, say, by {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''f&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}}; we have {{math|''g'' {{=}} ''f&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;r&lt;/sup&gt;''}} in the strong version, {{math|''g'' {{=}} 1}} in the weak form. This means the existence or the non-existence of polynomials {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''g&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} such that {{math|''g'' {{=}} ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + ''f&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;g&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. The usual proofs of the Nullstellensatz are not constructive, non-effective, in the sense that they do not give any way to compute the {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

It is thus a rather natural question to ask if there is an effective way to compute the {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} (and the exponent {{mvar|r}} in the strong form) or to prove that they do not exist. To solve this problem, it suffices to provide an upper bound on the total degree of the {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}: such a bound reduces the problem to a finite [[system of linear equations]] that may be solved by usual [[linear algebra]] techniques. Any such upper bound is called an '''effective Nullstellensatz'''.

A related problem is the '''ideal membership problem''', which consists in testing if a polynomial belongs to an ideal. For this problem also, a solution is provided by an upper bound on the degree of the {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. A general solution of the ideal membership problem provides an effective Nullstellensatz, at least for the weak form.

In 1925, [[Grete Hermann]] gave an upper bound for ideal membership problem that is doubly exponential in the number of variables. In 1982 Mayr and Meyer gave an example where the {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} have a degree that is at least double exponential, showing that every general upper bound for the ideal membership problem is doubly exponential in the number of variables.  

Since most mathematicians at the time assumed the effective Nullstellensatz was at least as hard as ideal membership, few mathematicians sought a bound better than double-exponential.  In 1987, however, [[W. Dale Brownawell]] gave an upper bound for the effective Nullstellensatz that is simply exponential in the number of variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Brownawell|first=W. Dale|title=Bounds for the degrees in the Nullstellensatz|journal=[[Ann. of Math.]]|volume=126|year=1987|issue=3|pages=577–591|mr=0916719|doi=10.2307/1971361}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brownawell's proof relied on analytic techniques valid only in characteristic 0, but, one year later, [[János Kollár]] gave a purely algebraic proof, valid in any characteristic, of a slightly better bound.

In the case of the weak Nullstellensatz, Kollár's bound is the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first=János| last=Kollár| title=Sharp Effective Nullstellensatz|journal=[[Journal of the American Mathematical Society]]| volume = 1| issue=4|year=1988|pages=963–975|url=http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~deloera/MISC/BIBLIOTECA/trunk/Kollar/kollarnullstellen.pdf| doi=10.2307/1990996 | mr=0944576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Let {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''f&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''}} be polynomials in {{math|''n'' ≥ 2}} variables, of total degree {{math|''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ ... ≥ ''d&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. If there exist polynomials {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} such that {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + ''f&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;g&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 1}}, then they can be chosen such that 
::&lt;math&gt;\deg(f_ig_i) \le \max(d_s,3)\prod_{j=1}^{\min(n,s)-1}\max(d_j,3).&lt;/math&gt; 
:This bound is optimal if all the degrees are greater than 2.

If {{mvar|d}} is the maximum of the degrees of the {{math|''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, this bound may be simplified to 
:&lt;math&gt;\max(3,d)^{\min(n,s)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Kollár's result has been improved by several authors. {{As of|2012|10|14}}, the best improvement, due to M. Sombra is&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Martín|last=Sombra|title=A Sparse Effective Nullstellensatz| journal=Advances in Applied Mathematics|volume= 22|issue=2|year=1999| pages=271–295 |arxiv=alg-geom/9710003|doi=10.1006/aama.1998.0633 | mr=1659402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\deg(f_ig_i) \le 2d_s\prod_{j=1}^{\min(n,s)-1}d_j.&lt;/math&gt;

His bound improves Kollár's as soon as at least two of the degrees that are involved are lower than&amp;nbsp;3.

==Projective Nullstellensatz==
We can formulate a certain correspondence between homogeneous ideals of polynomials and algebraic subsets of a projective space, called the '''projective Nullstellensatz''', that is analogous to the affine one. To do that, we introduce some notations. Let &lt;math&gt;R = k[t_0, \ldots, t_n].&lt;/math&gt; The homogeneous ideal &lt;math&gt;R_+ = \bigoplus_{d \ge 1} R_d&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''maximal homogeneous ideal'' (see also [[irrelevant ideal]]). As in the affine case, we let: for a subset &lt;math&gt;S \subseteq \mathbb{P}^n&lt;/math&gt; and a homogeneous ideal ''I'' of ''R'',
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\operatorname{I}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(S) &amp;= \{ f \in R_+ \mid f = 0 \text{ on } S \}, \\
\operatorname{V}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(I) &amp;= \{ x \in \mathbb{P}^n \mid f(x) = 0 \text{ for all } f \in I \}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
By &lt;math&gt;f = 0 \text{ on } S&lt;/math&gt; we mean: for every homogeneous coordinates &lt;math&gt;(a_0 : \cdots : a_n)&lt;/math&gt; of a point of ''S'' we have &lt;math&gt;f(a_0,\ldots, a_n)=0&lt;/math&gt;. This implies that the homogeneous components of ''f'' are also zero on ''S'' and thus that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{I}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(S)&lt;/math&gt; is a homogeneous ideal. Equivalently, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{I}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(S)&lt;/math&gt; is the homogeneous ideal generated by homogeneous polynomials ''f'' that vanish on ''S''. Now, for any homogeneous ideal &lt;math&gt;I \subseteq R_+&lt;/math&gt;, by the usual Nullstellensatz, we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{I} = \operatorname{I}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(\operatorname{V}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(I)),&lt;/math&gt;
and so, like in the affine case, we have:&lt;ref&gt;This formulation comes from Milne, Algebraic geometry [http://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/ag.html] and differs from {{harvnb|Hartshorne|1977|loc=Ch. I, Exercise 2.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:There exists an order-reversing one-to-one correspondence between proper homogeneous radical ideals of ''R'' and subsets of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}^n&lt;/math&gt; of the form &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{V}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(I).&lt;/math&gt; The correspondence is given by &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{I}_{\mathbb{P}^n}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{V}_{\mathbb{P}^n}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Analytic Nullstellensatz ==
The Nullstellensatz also holds for the germs of holomorphic functions at a point of complex ''n''-space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^n&lt;/math&gt;. Precisely, for each open subset &lt;math&gt;U \subset \mathbb{C}^n&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{C}^n}(U)&lt;/math&gt; denote the ring of holomorphic functions on ''U''; then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{C}^n}&lt;/math&gt; is a ''[[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]]'' on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^n&lt;/math&gt;. The stalk &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{C}^n, 0}&lt;/math&gt; at, say, the origin can be shown to be a [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]] [[local ring]] that is a [[unique factorization domain]].

If &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{C}^n, 0}&lt;/math&gt; is a germ represented by a holomorphic function &lt;math&gt;\widetilde{f}: U \to \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;, then let
:&lt;math&gt;V_0(f)&lt;/math&gt; = the equivalence class of the set &lt;math&gt;\{ z \in U | \widetilde{f}(z) = 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;
where two subsets ''X'', ''Y'' of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^n&lt;/math&gt; are considered equivalent if &lt;math&gt;X \cap U = Y \cap U&lt;/math&gt; for some neighborhood ''U'' of 0. Note &lt;math&gt;V_0(f)&lt;/math&gt; is independent of a choice of the representative &lt;math&gt;\widetilde{f}&lt;/math&gt;. For each ideal &lt;math&gt;I \subset \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{C}^n, 0}&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;V_0(I)&lt;/math&gt; denote &lt;math&gt;V_0(f_1) \cap \dots \cap V_0(f_r)&lt;/math&gt; for some generators &lt;math&gt;f_1, \dots, f_r&lt;/math&gt; of ''I''. It is well-defined; i.e., is independent of a choice of the generators.

For each subset &lt;math&gt;X \subset \mathbb{C}^n&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;I_0(X) = \{ f \in \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{C}^n, 0} | V_0(f) \supset X \}&lt;/math&gt;. It is easy to see that &lt;math&gt;I_0(X)&lt;/math&gt; is an ideal of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{C}^n, 0}&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;I_0(X) = I_0(Y)&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;X \sim Y&lt;/math&gt; in the sense discussed above.

The '''analytic Nullstellensatz''' then states:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Huybrechts|loc=Proposition 1.1.29.}}&lt;/ref&gt; for each ideal &lt;math&gt;I \subset \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{C}^n, 0}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{I} = I_0(V_0(I))&lt;/math&gt;
where the left-hand side is the [[radical of an ideal|radical]] of ''I''.&lt;!-- TODO: need to mention an analytic subset, which apparently is yet to be created. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4745">In [[algebraic geometry]], an '''infinitely near point''' of an algebraic surface ''S'' is a point on a surface obtained from ''S'' by repeatedly blowing up points. Infinitely near points of [[algebraic surface]]s were introduced by {{harvs|txt|first=Max|last=Noether|authorlink=Max Noether|year=1876}}.&lt;ref&gt;''Infinitely Near Points on Algebraic Surfaces'', Gino Turrin, ''American Journal of Mathematics'', Vol. 74, No. 1 (Jan., 1952), pp. 100–106&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some other meanings of "infinitely near point". Infinitely near points can also be defined for higher-dimensional varieties: there are several inequivalent ways to do this, depending on what one is allowed to blow up. Weil gave a definition of infinitely near points of smooth varieties,&lt;ref&gt;[4] Weil, A., ''Theorie des points proches sur les varietes differentielles'', Colloque de Topologie et Geometrie Diferentielle, Strasbourg, 1953, 111–117; in his ''Collected Papers'' II. The notes to the paper there indicate this was a rejected project for the [[Bourbaki group]]. Weil references [[Pierre de Fermat]]'s approach to calculus, as well as the jets of [[Charles Ehresmann]]. For an extended treatment, see O. O. Luciano, ''Categories of multiplicative functors and Weil's infinitely near points'',  Nagoya Math. J.  109 (1988), 69–89 (online [http://projecteuclid.org/Dienst/UI/1.0/Summarize/euclid.nmj/1118780892 here] for a full discussion.&lt;/ref&gt; though these are not the same as infinitely near points in algebraic geometry.
In the line of [[hyperreal number]]s, an extension of the [[real number]] line, two points are called infinitely near if their difference is [[infinitesimal]].

== Definition==

When [[blowing up]] is applied to a point ''P'' on a surface ''S'', the new surface ''S''* contains a whole curve ''C'' where ''P'' used to be. The points of ''C'' have the geometric interpretation as the tangent directions at ''P'' to ''S''. They can be called infinitely near to ''P'' as way of visualizing them on ''S'', rather than ''S''*. More generally this construction can be iterated by blowing up a point on the new curve ''C'', and so on.

An '''infinitely near point''' (of order ''n'') ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; on a surface ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is given by a sequence of points ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; on surfaces ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; such that  ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is given by blowing up ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''i''–1&lt;/sub&gt; at the point ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''–1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is a point of the surface ''S''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; with image ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''–1&lt;/sub&gt;.

In particular the points of the surface ''S'' are the infinitely near points on ''S'' of order 0.

Infinitely near points correspond to 1-dimensional valuations of the function field of ''S'' with 0-dimensional center, and in particular correspond to some of the points of the [[Zariski–Riemann surface]]. (The 1-dimensional valuations with 1-dimensional center correspond to irreducible curves of ''S''.) It is also possible to iterate the construction infinitely often, producing an infinite sequence ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,... of infinitely near points. These infinite sequences correspond to the 0-dimensional valuations of the function field of the surface, which correspond to the "0-dimensional" points of the [[Zariski–Riemann surface]].

==Applications==

If ''C'' and ''D'' are distinct irreducible curves on a smooth surface ''S'' intersecting at a point ''p'', then the multiplicity of their intersection at ''p'' is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{x \text{ infinitely near }p} m_x(C)m_x(D)&lt;/math&gt;
where ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'') is the multiplicity of ''C'' at ''x''. In general this is larger than ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'')''m''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''D'') if ''C'' and ''D'' have a common tangent line at ''x'' so that they also intersect at infinitely near points of order greater than&amp;nbsp;0, for example if ''C'' is the line ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and ''D'' is the parabola ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(0,0).

The genus of ''C'' is given by 
:&lt;math&gt; g(C)=g(N)+\sum_{\text{infinitely near points }x}m_x(m_x-1)/2&lt;/math&gt;
where ''N'' is the normalization of ''C'' and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; is the multiplicity of the infinitely near point ''x'' on ''C''.

He also worked as a [[computer architecture|computer architect]] at [[Goodyear Aerospace]] in [[Akron, Ohio]] for 28 years. 

==Early life and Education==
He was born in December 1935 in Queens, New York City. His father, Ralph R. Batcher, was the Chief Engineer of The [[Alfred H. Grebe|A. H. Grebe]] Radio Company until its bankruptcy in 1932. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlytelevision.org/batcher_articles.html/ Early Electronic Television, Early TV In New York City] Retrieved on 5 Mar 2018&lt;/ref&gt;
Batcher graduated from [[Iowa State University]] with [[Bachelor of Engineering|B.E.]] degree in 1957. In 1964, Batcher received his Ph.D. in [[electrical engineering]] from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]]. He graduated from [[Brooklyn Technical High School]].&lt;ref name="kent"/&gt;

==His career and achievements==
Among the designs he worked on at Goodyear were the:

* [[Goodyear MPP|Massively Parallel Processor]] (16,384 custom bit-serial processors {8 to a chip} organized in a [[SIMD]] 128 x 128 processor array with additional CPU rows for [[fault-tolerance]]) which was located at the [[NASA]] [[Goddard Space Flight Center]], and is now in the [[Smithsonian]]. This unit predates [[Danny Hillis]]' [[Thinking Machines Corporation]]'s [[Connection Machine]]
* The Goodyear [[STARAN]] associative processor arrays, a version of which (called ASPRO) was found in the [[US Navy]] [[Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye]] radar planes.

He published several technical papers and owns 14 patents of his own. "He discovered two parallel sorting algorithms: the odd-even mergesort and the bitonic mergesort". He is also a discoverer of scrambling data method in a random access memory which allows accesses along multiple dimensions. These memories were used in the STARAN and the MPP parallel processors.&lt;ref name="kent"&gt;[http://www.cs.kent.edu/~batcher/ Kenneth E.

==Awards==
In 1980 he received an ''Arnstein Award'' presented by Goodyear Aerospace Corporation for technical achievement.&lt;ref name="kent"/&gt;

In 1990, Batcher was awarded the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]/[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] [[Eckert-Mauchly Award]] for his pioneering work on parallel computers.  He holds 14 patents.

In 2007, Batcher was awarded the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] [[Seymour Cray Computer Engineering Award]]; ''"For fundamental theoretical and practical contributions to massively parallel computation, including parallel sorting algorithms, interconnection networks, and pioneering designs of the STARAN and MPP computers."''

He is credited with discovering two important parallel sorting algorithms: the [[odd-even mergesort]] and the [[bitonic sorter|bitonic mergesort]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first = Thomas H. | last = Cormen | authorlink = Thomas H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14995">In [[mathematics]], '''loop-erased random walk''' is a model for a [[random]] [[path (graph theory)|simple path]] with important applications in [[combinatorics]] and, in [[physics]], [[quantum field theory]]. It is intimately connected to the '''uniform spanning tree''', a model for a random [[Tree (graph theory)|tree]]. See also ''[[random walk]]'' for more general treatment of this topic.

==Definition==
Assume ''G'' is some [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is some [[path (graph theory)|path]] of length ''n'' on ''G''. In other words, &lt;math&gt;\gamma(1),\dots,\gamma(n)&lt;/math&gt; are vertices of ''G'' such that &lt;math&gt;\gamma(i)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma(i+1)&lt;/math&gt; are connected by an edge. Then the '''loop erasure''' of &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a new simple path created by erasing all the loops of &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; in chronological order. Formally, we define indices &lt;math&gt;i_j&lt;/math&gt; [[Mathematical induction|inductively]] using

:&lt;math&gt;i_1 = 1\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i_{j+1}=\max\{i:\gamma(i)=\gamma(i_j)\}+1\,&lt;/math&gt;

where "max" here means up to the length of the path &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;. The induction stops when for some &lt;math&gt;i_j&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;\gamma(i_j)=\gamma(n)&lt;/math&gt;. Assume this happens at ''J'' i.e. &lt;math&gt;i_J&lt;/math&gt; is the last &lt;math&gt;i_j&lt;/math&gt;. Then the loop erasure of &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{LE}(\gamma)&lt;/math&gt; is a simple path of length ''J'' defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{LE}(\gamma)(j)=\gamma(i_j).\,&lt;/math&gt;

Now let ''G'' be some graph, let ''v'' be a vertex of ''G'', and let ''R'' be a random walk on ''G'' starting from ''v''. Let ''T'' be some [[stopping time]] for ''R''. Then the '''loop-erased random walk''' until time ''T'' is LE(''R''([1,''T''])). In other words, take ''R'' from its beginning until ''T''&amp;nbsp;— that's a (random) path&amp;nbsp;— erase all the loops in chronological order as above&amp;nbsp;— you get a random simple path.

The stopping time ''T'' may be fixed, i.e. one may perform ''n'' steps and then loop-erase. However, it is usually more natural to take ''T'' to be the [[hitting time]] in some set. For example, let ''G'' be the graph '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and let ''R'' be a random walk starting from the point (0,0). Let ''T'' be the time when ''R'' first hits the circle of radius 100 (we mean here of course a ''discretized'' circle). LE(''R'') is called the loop-erased random walk starting at (0,0) and stopped at the circle.

==Uniform spanning tree==

A [[spanning tree]] chosen randomly from among all possible spanning trees with equal probability is called a uniform spanning tree.  To create such a tree Wilson’s algorithm uses loop-erased random walks. The algorithm proceeds by initializing the tree maze with a random starting cell. New cells are then subsequently added to the maze, initiating a random walk. The random walk progresses uninterrupted until it eventually links with the prevailing maze. However, if the random walk traverses through itself, the resulting loop is erased before the random walk proceeds. The initial random walks are unexpected to link with the small existing maze. As the maze develops, the random walks tend to have a higher probability to collide with the maze and may cause the algorithm to accelerate dramatically.

For instance, Let ''G'' again be a graph. A [[spanning tree (mathematics)|spanning tree]] of ''G'' is a [[Glossary of graph theory#Subgraphs|subgraph]] of ''G'' containing all vertices and some of the edges, which is a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]], i.e. [[Glossary of graph theory#Connectivity|connected]] and with no [[Glossary of graph theory#cycle|cycles]]. The uniform spanning tree (UST for short) is a ''random'' spanning tree chosen among all the possible spanning trees of ''G'' with equal probability.

Let now ''v'' and ''w'' be two vertices in ''G''. Any spanning tree contains precisely one simple path between ''v'' and ''w''. Taking this path in the ''uniform'' spanning tree gives a random simple path. It turns out that the distribution of this path is identical to the distribution of the loop-erased random walk starting at ''v'' and stopped at ''w''.

An immediate corollary is that loop-erased random walk is symmetric in its start and end points. More precisely, the distribution of the loop-erased random walk starting at ''v'' and stopped at ''w'' is identical to the distribution of the reversal of loop-erased random walk starting at ''w'' and stopped at ''v''. This is not a trivial fact. Loop-erasing a path and the reverse path do not give the same result. It is only the ''distributions'' that are identical.

A-priori [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]] a UST seems difficult. Even a relatively modest graph (say a 100x100 grid) has far too many spanning trees to prepare a complete list. Therefore, a different approach is needed. There are a number of algorithms for sampling a UST, but we will concentrate on '''Wilson's algorithm'''.

Take any two vertices and perform loop-erased random walk from one to the other. Now take a third vertex (not on the constructed path) and perform loop-erased random walk until hitting the already constructed path. This gives a tree with either two or three leaves. Choose a fourth vertex and do loop-erased random walk until hitting this tree. Continue until the tree spans all the vertices. It turns out that ''no matter which method you use to choose the starting vertices'' you always end up with the same distribution on the spanning trees, namely the uniform one.

==The Laplacian random walk==
Another representation of loop-erased random walk stems from solutions of the [[Discrete mathematics|discrete]] [[Laplace equation]]. Let ''G'' again be a graph and let ''v'' and ''w'' be two vertices in ''G''. Construct a random path from ''v'' to ''w'' inductively using the following procedure. Assume we have already defined &lt;math&gt;\gamma(1),...,\gamma(n)&lt;/math&gt;. Let ''f'' be a function from ''G'' to '''R''' satisfying

:&lt;math&gt;f(\gamma(i))=0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i\leq n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(w)=1&lt;/math&gt;
:''f'' is discretely [[Harmonic function|harmonic]] everywhere else

Where a function ''f'' on a graph is discretely harmonic at a point ''x'' if ''f''(''x'') equals the average of ''f'' on the neighbors of ''x''.

With ''f'' defined choose &lt;math&gt;\gamma(n+1)&lt;/math&gt; using ''f'' at the neighbors of &lt;math&gt;\gamma(n)&lt;/math&gt; as weights. In other words, if &lt;math&gt;x_1,...,x_d&lt;/math&gt; are these neighbors, choose &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; with probability

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{f(x_i)}{\sum_{j=1}^d f(x_j)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Continuing this process, recalculating ''f'' at each step, with result in a random simple path from ''v'' to ''w''; the distribution of this path is identical to that of a loop-erased random walk from ''v'' to ''w''.

An alternative view is that the distribution of a loop-erased random walk [[Conditional probability|conditioned]] to start in some path β is identical to the loop-erasure of a random walk conditioned not to hit β. This property is often referred to as the '''Markov property''' of loop-erased random walk (though the relation to the usual [[Markov property]] is somewhat vague).

It is important to notice that while the proof of the equivalence is quite easy, models which involve dynamically changing harmonic functions or measures are typically extremely difficult to analyze. Practically nothing is known about the [[p-Laplacian walk]] or [[Brownian tree|diffusion-limited aggregation]]. Another somewhat related model is the [[harmonic explorer]].

Finally there is another link that should be mentioned: [[Kirchhoff's theorem]] relates the number of spanning trees of a graph ''G'' to the [[eigenvalue]]s of the discrete [[Laplacian]]. See [[spanning tree (mathematics)|spanning tree]] for details.

==Grids==
Let ''d'' be the dimension, which we will assume to be at least 2. Examine '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; i.e. all the points &lt;math&gt;(a_1,...,a_d)&lt;/math&gt; with integer &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt;. This is an infinite graph with degree 2''d'' when you connect each point to its nearest neighbors. From now on we will consider loop-erased random walk on this graph or its subgraphs.

===High dimensions===
The easiest case to analyze is dimension 5 and above. In this case it turns out that there the intersections are only local. A calculation shows that if one takes a random walk of length ''n'', its loop-erasure has length of the same order of magnitude, i.e. ''n''. Scaling accordingly, it turns out that loop-erased random walk converges (in an appropriate sense) to [[Brownian motion]] as ''n'' goes to infinity. Dimension 4 is more complicated, but the general picture is still true. It turns out that the loop-erasure of a random walk of length ''n'' has approximately &lt;math&gt;n/\log^{1/3}n&lt;/math&gt; vertices, but again, after scaling (that takes into account the logarithmic factor) the loop-erased walk converges to Brownian motion.

===Two dimensions===
In two dimensions, arguments from [[two-dimensional conformal field theory|conformal field theory]] and simulation results led to a number of exciting conjectures. Assume ''D'' is some [[simply connected]] [[Domain (mathematics)|domain]] in the plane and ''x'' is a point in ''D''. Take the graph ''G'' to be

:&lt;math&gt;G:=D\cap \varepsilon \mathbb{Z}^2,&lt;/math&gt;

that is, a grid of side length ε restricted to ''D''. Let ''v'' be the vertex of ''G'' closest to ''x''. Examine now a loop-erased random walk starting from ''v'' and stopped when hitting the "boundary" of ''G'', i.e. the vertices of ''G'' which correspond to the boundary of ''D''. Then the conjectures are
* As ε goes to zero the distribution of the path converges to some distribution on simple paths from ''x'' to the boundary of ''D'' (different from Brownian motion, of course&amp;nbsp;— in 2 dimensions paths of Brownian motion are not simple). This distribution (denote it by &lt;math&gt;S_{D,x}&lt;/math&gt;) is called the '''scaling limit''' of loop-erased random walk.
* These distributions are [[Conformal map|conformally invariant]]. Namely, if φ is a [[Riemann mapping theorem|Riemann map]] between ''D'' and a second domain ''E'' then

:&lt;math&gt;\phi(S_{D,x})=S_{E,\phi(x)}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

*The [[Hausdorff dimension]] of these paths is 5/4 [[almost surely]].

The first attack at these conjectures came from the direction of '''[[domino tiling]]s'''. Taking a spanning tree of ''G'' and adding to it its [[Planar graph|planar dual]] one gets a [[Dominoes|domino]] tiling of a special derived graph (call it ''H''). Each vertex of ''H'' corresponds to a vertex, edge or face of ''G'', and the edges of ''H'' show which vertex lies on which edge and which edge on which face. It turns out that taking a uniform spanning tree of ''G'' leads to a uniformly distributed random domino tiling of ''H''. The number of domino tilings of a graph can be calculated using the determinant of special matrices, which allow to connect it to the discrete [[Green's function|Green function]] which is approximately conformally invariant. These arguments allowed to show that certain measurables of loop-erased random walk are (in the limit) conformally invariant, and that the [[Expected value|expected]] number of vertices in a loop-erased random walk stopped at a circle of radius ''r'' is of the order of &lt;math&gt;r^{5/4}&lt;/math&gt;.

In 2002 these conjectures were resolved (positively) using [[Stochastic Löwner Evolution]]. Very roughly, it is a stochastic conformally invariant [[ordinary differential equation]] which allows to catch the Markov property of loop-erased random walk (and many other probabilistic processes).

===Three dimensions===
The scaling limit exists and is invariant under rotations and dilations.&lt;ref&gt;Kozma, Gady (2007) "The scaling limit of loop-erased random walk in three dimensions", ''Acta Mathematica'', 199 (1), 29–152 {{doi|10.1007/s11511-007-0018-8}} [https://arxiv.org/abs/math.PR/0508344 preprint]&lt;/ref&gt; If &lt;math&gt;L(r)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the expected number of vertices in the loop-erased random walk until it gets to a distance of ''r'', then

:&lt;math&gt;cr^{1+\varepsilon}\leq L(r)\leq Cr^{5/3}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ε, ''c'' and ''C'' are some positive numbers &lt;ref&gt;Lawler, Gregory F. (1999) "Loop-erased random walk", in ''Perplexing problems in probability: Festschrift in honor of Harry Kesten'' (M. Bramson and R. T. Durrett, eds.), Progr. Probab., vol. 44, Birkhäuser Boston, Boston, MA, 1999, pp. 197–217.&lt;/ref&gt; (the numbers can, in principle, be calculated from the proofs, but the author did not do it). This suggests that the scaling limit should have Hausdorff dimension between &lt;math&gt;1+\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; and 5/3 almost surely. Numerical experiments show that it should be &lt;math&gt;1.62400\pm 0.00005&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, David B. (2010) "The dimension of loop-erased random walk in 3D", ''Physical Review E'',82(6):062102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Named in honor of [[Benoit Mandelbrot]], the '''Mandelbrot Competition''' is a [[mathematics competition]] founded by [[Sam Vandervelde]], [[Richard Rusczyk]] and [[Sandor Lehoczky]] that allows high school students to compete individually and in four-person teams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Resources/AoPS_R_Contests_Mandelbrot.php Mandelbrot&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013115042/http://artofproblemsolving.com/Resources/AoPS_R_Contests_Mandelbrot.php |date=2007-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition==
The Mandelbrot is a "correspondence competition," meaning that the competition is sent to a school's coach and students compete at their own school on a predetermined date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cogito.org/calendar/CalendarDetail.aspx?ContentID=11056 Cogito - Mandelbrot Competition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Individual results and team answers are then sent back to the contest coordinators.  The most notable aspects of the Mandelbrot competition are the difficulty of the problems (much like the [[American Mathematics Competition]] and harder [[American Invitational Mathematics Examination]] problems) and the proof-based team round.{{fact|date=July 2014}} Many past medalists at the [[International Mathematics Olympiad]] first tried their skills on the Mandelbrot Competition.{{fact|date=July 2014}}

==History==
The Mandelbrot Competition was started by [[Sam Vandervelde]], [[Richard Rusczyk]] and [[Sandor Lehoczky]] while they were undergraduates in the early 1990s.  Vandervelde still runs the competition.  Rusczyk now manages Art of Problem Solving Inc. and Lehoczky enjoys a successful career on [[Wall Street]].

== Contest format ==

The individual competition consists of seven questions of varying value, worth a total of 14 points, that students have 40 minutes to answer.  The team competition is a proof-based competition, where many questions are asked about a particular situation, and a team of four students is given 60 minutes to answer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathpropress.com/books/competitions/mandelbrot/MandelbrotInfo.html About the Mandelbrot Competition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Divisions ==

The Mandelbrot Competition has two divisions, currently referred to as ''National'' and ''Regional.''  Questions at the National level are more difficult than those at the Regional level, but generally have overlap or concern similar topics.  For example, in the individual competition, the National competition will remove some of the easier Regional questions, and add some harder questions.  In the team competition, the topic will be the same but the National level will give fewer hints.

== Recent winners ==

The top four high schools in the 2003–2004 National division were [[Academy for the Advancement of Science and Technology]], [[New Jersey|NJ]]; [[Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology]], [[Virginia|VA]]; [[Stuyvesant High School]], [[New York (state)|NY]]; and the [[Illinois Math and Science Academy]].

== Research work ==
[[File:Remise de la médaille Fields à Maryam Mirzakhani.webm|left|thumb|Maryam Mirzakhani, August 2014]]

Mirzakhani made several contributions to the theory of [[moduli space]]s of [[Riemann surface]]s. Mirzakhani’s early work solved the problem of counting simple closed [[geodesics]] on [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]] Riemann surfaces by finding a relationship to volume calculations on moduli space. Geodesics are the natural generalization of the idea of a "[[Line (mathematics)|straight line]]"  to "[[manifold|curved space]]s". Slightly more formally, a curve is a geodesic if no slight deformation can make it shorter. Closed geodesics are geodesics which are also closed curves—that is, they are curves that close up into loops. A  closed geodesic is [[Curve#Definitions|simple]] if it does not cross itself.

A previous result, known as the “[[prime number theorem]] for geodesics”, established that the number of closed geodesics of length less than L grows exponentially with L—it is asymptotic to &lt;math&gt; e^L/L&lt;/math&gt;. However, the analogous counting problem for simple closed geodesics remained open, despite being “the key object to unlocking the structure and geometry of the whole surface,” according to University of Chicago topologist [[Benson Farb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/maryam-mirzakhani-is-first-woman-fields-medalist-20140812/|title=Maryam Mirzakhani Is First Woman Fields Medalist {{!}} Quanta Magazine|work=Quanta Magazine|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mirzakhani’s 2004 PhD thesis solved this problem, showing that the number of simple closed geodesics of length less than L is polynomial in L. Explicitly, it is asymptotic to &lt;math&gt; cL^{6g-6}&lt;/math&gt;, where g is the [[Genus (mathematics)|genus]] (roughly, the number of “holes”) and c is a constant depending on the hyperbolic structure. This result can be seen as a generalization of the [[theorem of the three geodesics]] for [[spherical surface]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mirzakhani|first1=Maryam |title=Growth of the number of simple closed geodesics on hyperbolic surfaces |journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] |year=2008 |doi=10.4007/annals.2008.168.97 |volume=168 |issue=1 |pages=97–125 |mr=2415399 |zbl=1177.37036}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ams.org/notices/201304/rnoti-p490.pdf|title=Notices of the AMS|last=Kehoe|first=Elaine|date=April 2013|work=Notices of the AMS|access-date=September 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mirzakhani solved this counting problem by relating it to the problem of computing volumes in [[moduli space]]—a space whose points correspond to different complex structures on a surface genus g. In her thesis, Mirzakhani found a volume formula for the moduli space of bordered Riemann surfaces of genus g with n geodesic boundary components. From this formula followed the counting for simple closed geodesics mentioned above, as well as a number of other results. This led her to obtain a new proof for the formula discovered by [[Edward Witten]] and [[Maxim Kontsevich]] on the intersection numbers of tautological classes on moduli space.&lt;ref name="Weil-Petersson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 2014|title=2014 Fields Medals|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/201409/rnoti-p1074.pdf|journal=Notices of the AMS|volume= 61| issue = 9|pages=1079–1081|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her subsequent work focused on Teichmüller dynamics of moduli space. In particular, she was able to prove the long-standing conjecture that [[William Thurston]]'s [[Earthquake map|earthquake]] flow on [[Teichmüller space]] is [[Ergodicity|ergodic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mirzakhani|first1=M. |title=Ergodic Theory of the Earthquake Flow |journal=[[International Mathematics Research Notices]] |year=2008 |volume=2008 |doi=10.1093/imrn/rnm116 |mr=2416997}}&lt;/ref&gt; One can construct a simple earthquake map by cutting a surface along a finite number of disjoint simple closed geodesics, sliding the edges of each of these cut past each other by some amount, and closing the surface back up. One can imagine the surface being cut by [[Fault (geology)#Strike-slip faults|strike-slip faults]]. An earthquake is a sort of limit of simple earthquakes, where one has an infinite number of geodesics, and instead of attaching a positive real number to each geodesic one puts a [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] on them.

In 2014, with [[Alex Eskin]] and with input from Amir Mohammadi, Mirzakhani proved that complex geodesics and their closures in moduli space are surprisingly regular, rather than irregular or fractal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Alex | last1=Eskin | first2=Maryam | last2=Mirzakhani | first3=Amir | last3=Mohammadi | title=Isolation, equidistribution, and orbit closures for the SL(2,R) action on moduli space | journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] | volume=182 | issue=2 | pages=673–721 | doi=10.4007/annals.2015.182.2.7 | year=2015| arxiv=1305.3015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IMU-pressrelease /&gt; The closures of complex geodesics are algebraic objects defined in terms of polynomials and therefore they have certain rigidity properties, which is analogous to a celebrated result that [[Marina Ratner]] arrived at during the 1990s.&lt;ref name=IMU-pressrelease /&gt; The [[International Mathematical Union]] said in its press release that "It is astounding to find that the rigidity in homogeneous spaces has an echo in the inhomogeneous world of moduli space."&lt;ref name=IMU-pressrelease&gt;{{cite press release|title=The Work of Maryam Mirzakhani|publisher=International Mathematics Union|url=http://www.mathunion.org/fileadmin/IMU/Prizes/2014/news_release_mirzakhani.pdf|format=PDF|access-date=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|[Her] work expertly blends dynamics with geometry. Among other things, she studies billiards. But now, in a move very characteristic of modern mathematics, it gets kind of meta: She considers not just one billiard table, but the universe of all ''possible'' billiard tables. And the kind of dynamics she studies doesn't directly concern the motion of the billiards on the table, but instead a transformation of the billiard table itself, which is changing its shape in a rule-governed way; if you like, the table itself moves like a strange planet around the universe of all possible tables&amp;nbsp;... This isn't the kind of thing you do to win at pool, but it's the kind of thing you do to win a Fields Medal. And it's what you need to do in order to expose the dynamics at the heart of geometry; for there's no question that they're there.&lt;ref name="Slate Fields article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ellenberg|first=Jordan|authorlink=Jordan Ellenberg|title=Math Is Getting Dynamic|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/do_the_math/2014/08/maryam_mirzakhani_fields_medal_first_woman_to_win_math_s_biggest_prize_works.html|newspaper=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2014, President [[Hassan Rouhani]] of Iran congratulated her for winning the topmost world mathematics prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=President hails Prof Mirzakhani, winner of topmost world math prize|url=http://president.ir/en/79887|website=Official Site of the President of The Islamic Republic of Iran|access-date=19 August 2014|date=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
In 2008, Mirzakhani married Jan Vondrák, a Czech [[Theoretical computer science|theoretical computer scientist]] and [[Applied mathematics|applied mathematician]] who currently is an associate professor at [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=Persian|title=بیوگرافی مریم میرزاخانی؛ ستاره پرفروغ دنیای ریاضیات [Biography Maryam Mirzakhani; the best-selling star of the world of mathematics]|url=http://www.zoomit.ir/2017/7/15/189155/maryam-mirzakhani-biography/|publisher=Zoomit|date=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theory.stanford.edu/~jvondrak/data/cv.pdf|title=Jan Vondrák, CV|last=|first=|date=|website=Stanford University|access-date=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have a daughter named Anahita.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simonsfoundation.org/quanta/20140812-a-tenacious-explorer-of-abstract-surfaces "A Tenacious Explorer of Abstract Surfaces"], simonsfoundation.org.

Mirzakhani described herself as a "slow" mathematician, saying that "you have to spend some energy and effort to see the beauty of math." To solve problems, Mirzakhani would draw doodles on sheets of paper and write mathematical formulas around the drawings. Her daughter described her mother's work as "painting".&lt;ref name="stanforddeath" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jul/29/maryam-mirzakhani-great-artist-mathematician-fields-medal-howard-jacobson|title=The world has lost a great artist in mathematician Maryam Mirzakhani|first=Howard|last=Jacobson|date=29 July 2017|accessdate=21 October 2017|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She declared:

Iranian president [[Hassan Rouhani]] and other officials published condolence messages and praised Mirzakhani's scientific achievements. Rouhani said in his message that "the unprecedented brilliance of this creative scientist and modest human being, who made Iran's name resonate in the world's scientific forums, was a turning point in showing the great will of Iranian women and young people on the path towards reaching the peaks of glory and in various international arenas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2017/07/15/528535/Iran-Maryam-Mirzakhani-cancer-US|title=Iranian math genius Mirzakhani passes away|date=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sharif University of Technology]], the place where Mirzakhani studied, announced that its faculty of mathematics will be renamed to "Mirzakhani".{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5615">In [[mathematics]], in the field of [[functional analysis]], a '''Minkowski functional''' is a function that recovers a notion of distance on a linear space.

Let ''K'' be a symmetric (i.e. if it contains ''x'' it also contains -''x'') convex body in a linear space ''V''.  We define a function ''p'' on ''V'' as

:&lt;math&gt;p(x) = \inf \{ \lambda \in \mathbb{R}_{&gt; 0} : x \in \lambda K \} &lt;/math&gt;

This is the Minkowski functional of ''K''.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (1996) p.17&lt;/ref&gt; Usually it is assumed that ''K'' is such that the set of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is never empty, but sometimes the set is allowed to be empty and then ''p(x)'' is defined as infinity.

== Examples ==

===Example 1===

Consider a [[normed vector space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, with the norm ||·||. Let &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; be the unit ball in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Define a function &lt;math&gt;p:X\rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; by 

:&lt;math&gt;p(x) = \inf \left\{r &gt; 0: x \in r K \right\}. &lt;/math&gt;

One can see that &lt;math&gt;p(x) = \|x\|&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is just the norm on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. The function ''p'' is a special case of a Minkowski functional.

=== Example 2===

Let ''X'' be a vector space without topology with underlying scalar field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{K}&lt;/math&gt;. Take &lt;math&gt;\phi \in X'&lt;/math&gt;, the algebraic dual of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\phi: X \rightarrow \mathbb{K}&lt;/math&gt; is a linear functional on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Fix &lt;math&gt;a&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Let the set &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; be given by

:&lt;math&gt;K = \{ x \in X : | \phi(x) | \leq a \}. &lt;/math&gt;

Again we define

:&lt;math&gt;p(x) = \inf \left\{r &gt; 0: x \in r K \right\}. &lt;/math&gt;

Then

:&lt;math&gt;p(x) = \frac{1}{a} | \phi(x) |.&lt;/math&gt;

The function ''p''(''x'') is another instance of a Minkowski functional. It has the following properties:

#It is ''subadditive'': &lt;math&gt;p(x + y) \leqslant p(x) + p(y)&lt;/math&gt;,
#It is ''homogeneous'': for all &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in \mathbb{K}, p(\alpha x) = \left\vert \alpha \right\vert p(x)&lt;/math&gt;,
#It is nonnegative.

Therefore, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a [[seminorm]] on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, with an induced topology. This is characteristic of Minkowski functionals defined via "nice" sets. There is a one-to-one correspondence between seminorms and the Minkowski functional given by such sets. What is meant precisely by "nice" is discussed in the section below.

Notice that, in contrast to a stronger requirement for a norm, &lt;math&gt;p(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt; need not imply &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;. In the above example, one can take a nonzero &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; from the kernel of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. Consequently, the resulting topology need not be [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]].

== Definition ==

The above examples suggest that, given a (complex or real) vector space ''X'' and a subset ''K'', one can define a corresponding Minkowski functional

:&lt;math&gt;p_K:X \rightarrow [0, \infty)&lt;/math&gt;

by

:&lt;math&gt;p_K (x) = \inf \left\{r &gt; 0: x \in r K \right\},&lt;/math&gt;

which is often called the gauge of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;.

It is implicitly assumed in this definition that 0 ∈ ''K'' and the set {''r'' &gt; 0: ''x'' ∈ ''r K''} is nonempty for every x. In order for ''p&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;'' to have the properties of a seminorm, additional restrictions must be imposed on ''K''. These conditions are listed below.

#The set ''K'' being [[convex set|convex]] implies the subadditivity of ''p&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;''.
#[[Homogeneous function|Homogeneity]], i.e. ''p&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;''(''α x'') = |''α''| ''p&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') for all ''α'', is ensured if ''K'' is ''balanced'', meaning ''α K'' ⊂ ''K'' for all |''α''| ≤ 1.

A set ''K'' with these properties is said to be [[absolutely convex set|absolutely convex]].

=== Convexity of ''K'' ===

A simple geometric argument that shows convexity of ''K'' implies subadditivity is as follows. Suppose for the moment that ''p&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') = ''p&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;''(''y'') = ''r''. Then for all ''ε'' &gt; 0, we have ''x'', ''y'' ∈ (''r + ε'') ''K'' = '' K' ''. The assumption that ''K'' is convex means '' K' '' is also. Therefore, ½ ''x'' + ½ ''y'' is in '' K' ''. By definition of the Minkowski functional ''p&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;'', one has

:&lt;math&gt;p_K\left( \frac{1}{2} x + \frac{1}{2} y\right) \le r + \epsilon = \frac{1}{2} p_K(x) + \frac{1}{2} p_K(y) + \epsilon .&lt;/math&gt;

But the left hand side is ½ ''p&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'' + ''y''), i.e. the above becomes

:&lt;math&gt;p_K(x + y) \le  p_K(x) + p_K(y) + \epsilon, \quad \mbox{for all} \quad \epsilon &gt; 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This is the desired inequality. The general case ''p&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') &gt; ''p&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;''(''y'') is obtained after the obvious modification.

'''Note''' Convexity of ''K'', together with the initial assumption that the set {''r'' &gt; 0: ''x'' ∈ ''r K''} is nonempty, implies that ''K'' is [[absorbing set|absorbing]].

=== Balancedness of ''K'' ===

Notice that ''K'' being balanced implies that

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda x \in r K \quad \mbox{if and only if} \quad x \in \frac{r}{|\lambda|} K.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore

:&lt;math&gt;p_K (\lambda x) = \inf \left\{r &gt; 0:  \lambda x \in r K \right\} 
=  \inf \left\{r &gt; 0:  x \in \frac{r}{|\lambda|} K \right\}
= \inf \left\{ | \lambda | \frac{r}{ | \lambda | } &gt; 0:  x \in \frac{r}{|\lambda|} K \right\}
= |\lambda| p_K(x).
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8078">In [[mathematics]], a '''monomial''' is, roughly speaking, a [[polynomial]] which has only one term. Two definitions of a monomial may be encountered:
*(1): A monomial, also called '''power product''', is a product of powers of [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] with [[nonnegative integer]] exponents, or, in other words, a product of variables, possibly with repetitions. The constant 1 is a monomial, being equal to the [[empty product]] and {{mvar|x}}&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; for any variable {{mvar|x}}. If only a single variable {{mvar|x}} is considered, this means that a monomial is either 1 or a power {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} of {{mvar|x}}, with {{mvar|n}} a positive integer. If several variables are considered, say, &lt;math&gt;x, y, z,&lt;/math&gt; then each can be given an exponent, so that any monomial is of the form &lt;math&gt;x^a y^b z^c&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;a,b,c&lt;/math&gt; non-negative integers (taking note that any exponent 0 makes the corresponding factor equal to 1).
*(2): A monomial is a monomial in the first sense multiplied by a nonzero constant, called the [[coefficient]] of the monomial. A monomial in the first sense is a special case of a monomial in the second sense, where the coefficient is 1. For example, in this interpretation &lt;math&gt;-7x^5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(3-4i)x^4yz^{13}&lt;/math&gt; are monomials (in the second example, the variables are &lt;math&gt;x, y, z,&lt;/math&gt; and the coefficient is a [[complex number]]).

In the context of [[Laurent polynomial]]s and [[Laurent series]], the exponents of a monomial may be negative, and in the context of [[Puiseux series]], the exponents may be [[rational number]]s.

Since the word "monomial", as well as the word "polynomial", comes from the late Latin word "binomium" (binomial), by changing the prefix "bi" (two in Latin), a monomial should theoretically be called a "mononomial". "Monomial" is a [[syncope (phonetics)|syncope]] by [[haplology]] of "mononomial".&lt;ref&gt;''American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison of the two definitions ==
With either definition, the set of monomials is a subset of all polynomials that is closed under multiplication.

Both uses of this notion can be found, and in many cases the distinction is simply ignored, see for instance examples for the first&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cox | first = David | authorlink = |author2=John Little |author3=Donal O'Shea  | title = Using Algebraic Geometry | publisher = Springer Verlag | year = 1998 | location = | pages = 1 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-387-98487-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and second&lt;ref&gt;{{Springer|id=M/m064760|title=Monomial}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning. In informal discussions the distinction is seldom important, and tendency is towards the broader second meaning. When studying the structure of polynomials however, one often definitely needs a notion with the first meaning. This is for instance the case when considering a [[monomial basis]] of a [[polynomial ring]], or a [[monomial order]]ing of that basis. An argument in favor of the first meaning is also that no obvious other notion is available to designate these values (the term power product is in use, in particular when ''monomial'' is used with the first meaning, but it does not make the absence of constants clear either), while the notion term of a polynomial unambiguously coincides with the second meaning of monomial. 

''The remainder of this article assumes the first meaning of "monomial".''

==Monomial basis==
{{main|Monomial basis}}
The most obvious fact about monomials (first meaning) is that any polynomial is a [[linear combination]] of them, so they form a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of the [[vector space]] of all polynomials, called the ''monomial basis'' - a fact of constant implicit use in mathematics.

==Number==
The number of monomials of degree ''d'' in ''n'' variables is the number of [[multicombination]]s of ''d'' elements chosen among the ''n'' variables (a variable can be chosen more than once, but order does not matter), which is given by the [[multiset coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\left(\!\!{n\choose d}\!\!\right)}&lt;/math&gt;. This expression can also be given in the form of a [[binomial coefficient]], as a [[polynomial expression]] in ''d'', or using a [[Pochhammer symbol#Alternate notations|rising factorial power]] of {{nowrap|''d'' + 1}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\!\!{n\choose d}\!\!\right) = \binom{n+d-1}{d} = \binom{d+(n-1)}{n-1}
  = \frac{(d+1)\times(d+2)\times\cdots\times(d+n-1)}{1\times2\times\cdots\times(n-1)} = \frac{1}{(n-1)!}(d+1)^{\overline{n-1}}.&lt;/math&gt;
The latter forms are particularly useful when one fixes the number of variables and lets the degree vary. From these expressions one sees that for fixed ''n'', the number of monomials of degree ''d'' is a polynomial expression in ''d'' of degree &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; with leading coefficient &lt;math&gt;\tfrac1{(n-1)!}&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, the number of monomials in three variables (&lt;math&gt;n=3&lt;/math&gt;) of degree ''d'' is &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac{1}{2}}(d+1)^{\overline2} = \textstyle{\frac{1}{2}}(d+1)(d+2)&lt;/math&gt;; these numbers form the sequence 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ... of [[triangular number]]s.

The [[Hilbert series]] is a compact way to express the number of monomials of a given degree: the number of monomials of degree {{mvar|d}} in {{mvar|n}} variables is the coefficient of degree {{mvar|d}} of the [[formal power series]] expansion of
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{(1-t)^n}.&lt;/math&gt;

The number of monomials of degree at most {{math|''d''}} in {{math|''n''}} variables is &lt;math&gt;\binom{n+d}{n} = \binom{n+d}{d}.&lt;/math&gt; This follows from the one-to-one correspondence between the monomials of degree {{math|''d''}} in {{math|''n''+1}} variables and the monomials of degree at most {{math|''d''}} in {{math|''n''}} variables, which consists in substituting by 1 the extra variable.

==Notation==

Notation for monomials is constantly required in fields like [[partial differential equation]]s. If the variables being used form an indexed family like &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_3&lt;/math&gt;, ..., then ''[[multi-index notation]]'' is helpful: if we write 

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = (a, b, c)&lt;/math&gt;

we can define 
:&lt;math&gt;x^{\alpha} = x_1^a\, x_2^b\, x_3^c&lt;/math&gt;

and save a great deal of space.

==Degree&lt;!-- [[Degree of a monomial]] redirects here --&gt;==

The degree of a monomial is defined as the sum of all the exponents of the variables, including the implicit exponents of 1 for the variables which appear without exponent; e.g., in the example of the previous section, the degree is &lt;math&gt;a+b+c&lt;/math&gt;. The degree of &lt;math&gt;x y z^2&lt;/math&gt; is 1+1+2=4. The degree of a nonzero constant is 0. For example, the degree of -7 is 0. 

The degree of a monomial is sometimes called order, mainly in the context of series. It is also called total degree when it is needed to distinguish it from the degree in one of the variables.

Monomial degree is fundamental to the theory of univariate and multivariate polynomials. Explicitly, it is used to define the [[degree of a polynomial]] and the notion of [[homogeneous polynomial]], as well as for graded [[monomial ordering]]s used in formulating and computing [[Gröbner basis|Gröbner bases]]. Implicitly, it is used in grouping the terms of a [[Taylor series#Taylor series in several variables|Taylor series in several variables]].

==Geometry==

In [[algebraic geometry]] the varieties defined by monomial equations &lt;math&gt;x^{\alpha} = 0&lt;/math&gt; for some set of α have special properties of homogeneity. This can be phrased in the language of [[algebraic group]]s, in terms of the existence of a [[group action]] of an [[algebraic torus]] (equivalently by a multiplicative group of [[diagonal matrix|diagonal matrices]]). This area is studied under the name of ''[[Toric geometry|torus embedding]]s''.

In computing, a '''one-pass algorithm''' is a [[streaming algorithm]] which reads its input exactly once, in order, without unbounded [[Buffer (computer science)|buffering]].  A one-pass algorithm generally requires O(n) (see [[Big O Notation|'big O' notation]]) time and less than O(n) storage (typically O(1)), where n is the size of the input.

Basically one-pass algorithm operates as follows:
(1) the object descriptions are processed serially;

In [[mathematics]] and [[computer programming]], the '''order of operations''' (or '''operator precedence''') is a collection of rules that reflect conventions about which procedures to perform first in order to evaluate a given [[Expression (mathematics)|mathematical expression]].

For example, in mathematics and most computer languages, multiplication is granted a higher precedence than addition, and it has been this way since the introduction of modern algebraic notation.&lt;ref name="Bronstein_1987"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/52582.html |title=Ask Dr. Math |publisher=Math Forum |date=22 November 2000 |accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the expression {{nowrap|2 + 3 × 4}} is interpreted to have the value {{nowrap|2 + (3 × 4) {{=}} 14}}, not {{nowrap|(2 + 3) × 4 {{=}} 20}}. With the introduction of exponents in the 16th and 17th centuries, they were given precedence over both addition and multiplication and could be placed only as a superscript to the right of their base.&lt;ref name="Bronstein_1987"/&gt; Thus {{nowrap|3 + 5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 28}} and {{nowrap|3 × 5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 75}}.

These conventions exist to eliminate ambiguity while allowing notation to be as brief as possible. Where it is desired to override the precedence conventions, or even simply to emphasize them, parentheses ( ) (sometimes replaced by brackets [ ] or braces { } for readability) can indicate an alternate order or reinforce the default order to avoid confusion. For example, {{nowrap|(2 + 3) × 4 {{=}} 20}} forces addition to precede multiplication, and {{nowrap|(3 + 5)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 64}} forces addition to precede exponentiation.

==Definition==
The order of operations used throughout mathematics, science, technology and many computer [[programming language]]s is expressed here:&lt;ref name="Bronstein_1987" /&gt;
# [[Exponentiation|exponents]] and [[Nth root|roots]]
# [[multiplication]] and [[Division (mathematics)|division]]
# [[addition]] and [[subtraction]]

This means that if a mathematical expression is preceded by one binary operator and followed by another, the operator higher on the list should be applied first.

The [[Commutative property|commutative]] and [[Associative property|associative]] laws of addition and multiplication allow adding terms in any order, and multiplying factors in any order—but mixed operations must obey the standard order of operations.

In some contexts, it is helpful to replace a division by multiplication by the reciprocal (multiplicative inverse) and a subtraction by addition of the opposite (additive inverse). For example, in [[computer algebra]], this allows manipulating fewer [[binary operation]]s and makes it easier to use [[commutativity]] and [[associativity]] when simplifying large [[expression (mathematics)| expressions]] – for more details, see {{slink|Computer algebra|Simplification}}.  Thus {{nowrap|3 ÷ 4 {{=}} 3 × ¼}}; in other words, the quotient of 3 and 4 equals the product of 3 and ¼. Also {{nowrap|3 − 4 {{=}} 3 + (−4)}}; in other words the difference of 3 and 4 equals the sum of 3 and −4. Thus, {{nowrap|1 − 3 + 7}} can be thought of as the sum of {{nowrap|1 + (−3) + 7}}, and the three [[summand]]s may be added in any order, in all cases giving 5 as the result. 

The root symbol √ requires a symbol of grouping around the radicand. The usual symbol of grouping is a bar (called [[vinculum (symbol)|vinculum]]) over the radicand. Other functions use parentheses around the input to avoid ambiguity. The parentheses are sometimes omitted if the input is a [[monomial]]. Thus, {{nowrap|sin 3x {{=}} sin(3x)}}, but {{nowrap|sin x + y {{=}} sin(x) + y}}, because {{nowrap|x + y}} is not a monomial.&lt;ref name="Bronstein_1987"&gt;{{cite book |title=Taschenbuch der Mathematik |author-first1=Ilja Nikolaevič&lt;!-- Nikolajewitsch --&gt; |author-last1=Bronstein&lt;!-- 1903–1976 --&gt; |author-first2=Konstantin Adolfovič&lt;!-- Adolfowitsch --&gt; |author-last2=Semendjajew&lt;!-- 1908–1988 --&gt; |editor-first1=Günter |editor-last1=Grosche |editor-first2=Viktor |editor-last2=Ziegler&lt;!-- 1922–1980--&gt; |editor-first3=Dorothea |editor-last3=Ziegler |others=Weiß, Jürgen&lt;!-- lector --&gt; |translator-first=Viktor |translator-last=Ziegler |volume=1 |date=1987 |edition=23 |orig-year=1945 |publisher=[[Verlag Harri Deutsch]] (and [[B. G. Teubner Verlagsgesellschaft]], Leipzig) |location=Thun and Frankfurt am Main |language=German |chapter=2.4.1.1. |pages=115–120 |isbn=3-87144-492-8 |title-link=Bronstein and Semendjajew}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some calculators and programming languages require parentheses around function inputs, some do not.

Symbols of grouping can be used to override the usual order of operations.&lt;ref name="Bronstein_1987"/&gt; Grouped symbols can be treated as a single expression.&lt;ref name="Bronstein_1987"/&gt; Symbols of grouping can be removed using the associative and distributive laws, also they can be removed if the expression inside the symbol of grouping is sufficiently simplified so no ambiguity results from their removal.

===Examples===
: &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1 + 3} + 5 = \sqrt 4 + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7.&lt;/math&gt;

A horizontal fractional line also acts as a symbol of grouping:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1 + 2}{3 + 4} + 5 = \frac{3}{7} + 5.&lt;/math&gt;

For ease in reading, other grouping symbols, such as curly braces { } or square brackets [ ], are often used along with parentheses ( ). For example:
: &lt;math&gt;[(1 + 2) - 3] - (4 - 5) = [3 - 3] - (-1) = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

===Exceptions===

===Unary minus sign===
There are differing conventions concerning the unary operator − (usually read "minus"). In written or printed mathematics, the expression −3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is interpreted to mean {{nowrap|0 − (3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) {{=}} − 9}},&lt;ref name="Bronstein_1987"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Allen R. Angel |title=Elementary Algebra for College Students |edition=8 |at=Chapter 1, Section 9, Objective 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some applications and programming languages, notably [[Microsoft Excel]] (and other spreadsheet applications) and [[bc programming language|the programming language bc]], unary operators have a higher priority than binary operators, that is, the unary minus has higher precedence than exponentiation, so in those languages −3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; will be interpreted as {{nowrap|(−3)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 9}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/kb/kbview/132686 |title=Formula Returns Unexpected Positive Value |publisher=Support.microsoft.com |date=15 August 2005 |accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This does not apply to the binary minus operator −; for example while the formulas &lt;code&gt;=-2^2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;=0+-2^2&lt;/code&gt; return 4 in Microsoft Excel, the formula &lt;code&gt;=0-2^2&lt;/code&gt; returns −4. In cases where there is the possibility that the notation might be misinterpreted, a binary minus operation can be enforced by explicitly specifying a leading 0 (as in &lt;code&gt;0-2^2&lt;/code&gt; instead of just &lt;code&gt;-2^2&lt;/code&gt;), or parentheses can be used to clarify the intended meaning.

===Mixed division and multiplication===
Similarly, there can be ambiguity in the use of the [[Slash (punctuation)#Arithmetic|slash symbol]] / in expressions such as 1/2''x''.&lt;ref name="Ball_1978"&gt;{{cite book |title=Algorithms for RPN calculators |first=John A. |last=Ball |date=1978 |edition=1 |publisher=[[Wiley-Interscience]], [[John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]] |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA |isbn=0-471-03070-8 |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; If one rewrites this expression as {{nowrap|1 ÷ 2''x''}} and then interprets the division symbol as indicating multiplication by the reciprocal, this becomes:
: {{nowrap|1 ÷ 2 × ''x'' {{=}} 1 × ½ × ''x'' {{=}} ½ × ''x''}}.

With this interpretation {{nowrap|1 ÷ 2''x''}} is equal to {{nowrap|(1 ÷ 2)''x''}}.&lt;ref name="Bronstein_1987"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"division and multiplication have the same priority", http://www.mathcentre.ac.uk/resources/uploaded/mc-ty-rules-2009-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some of the academic literature, [[multiplication denoted by juxtaposition]] (also known as [[implied multiplication]]) is interpreted as having higher precedence than division, so that {{nowrap|1 ÷ 2''x''}} equals {{nowrap|1 ÷ (2''x'')}}, not {{nowrap|(1 ÷ 2)''x''}}.

For example, the manuscript submission instructions for the ''[[Physical Review]]'' journals state that multiplication is of higher precedence than division with a slash,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://publish.aps.org/files/styleguide-pr.pdf |title=Physical Review Style and Notation Guide |publisher=[[American Physical Society]] |accessdate=5 August 2012 |at=Section IV&amp;ndash;E&amp;ndash;2&amp;ndash;e}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this is also the convention observed in prominent physics textbooks such as the ''[[Course of Theoretical Physics]]'' by [[Lev Landau|Landau]] and [[Evgeny Lifshitz|Lifshitz]] and the ''[[Feynman Lectures on Physics]]''.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;For example, the third edition of ''Mechanics'' by Landau and Lifshitz contains expressions such as ''hP''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;/2{{pi}} (p. 22), and the first volume of the ''Feynman Lectures'' contains expressions such as 1/2{{sqrt|''N''}} [http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_06.html (p. 6–7)]. In both books these expressions are written with the convention that the solidus is evaluated last.&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|PEMDAS|PEDMAS|BEDMAS|BEMDAS|BODMAS|BIDMAS|BIMDAS|BOMDAS|GEMDAS|BERDMAS|PERDMAS|BPODMAS}}Mnemonics==
[[Mnemonics]] are often used to help students remember the rules, involving the first letters of words representing various operations.  Different mnemonics are in use in different countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mathcentre.ac.uk/resources/uploaded/mc-ty-rules-2009-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.edweek.org/teachers/coach_gs_teaching_tips/2011/01/math_teachers_please_excuse_dear_aunt_sally--forever.html|title=Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally (PEMDAS)--Forever!|date=1 January 2011|work=Education Week - Coach G's Teaching Tips}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-pemdas-definition-rule-examples.html|title=What is PEMDAS? - Definition, Rule &amp; Examples|work=Study.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the United States, the acronym '''''PEMDAS''''' is common. It stands for ''P''arentheses, ''E''xponents, ''M''ultiplication/''D''ivision, ''A''ddition/''S''ubtraction. PEMDAS is often expanded to the mnemonic "'''Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally'''".&lt;ref name="Ball_1978" /&gt; 
* Canada and New Zealand use '''''BEDMAS''''', standing for ''B''rackets, ''E''xponents, ''D''ivision/''M''ultiplication, ''A''ddition/''S''ubtraction. 
* Most common in the UK, India, Bangladesh and Australia&lt;ref&gt;http://syllabus.bos.nsw.edu.au/assets/global/files/maths_s3_sampleu1.doc&lt;/ref&gt; and some other English-speaking countries are '''''BODMAS''''' meaning ''B''rackets, ''O''rder, ''D''ivision/''M''ultiplication, ''A''ddition/''S''ubtraction. Nigeria and some other West African countries also use BODMAS. Similarly in the UK, '''''BIDMAS''''' is used, standing for ''B''rackets, ''I''ndices, ''D''ivision/''M''ultiplication, ''A''ddition/''S''ubtraction.

These mnemonics may be misleading when written this way.&lt;ref name="Ball_1978" /&gt; For example, misinterpreting any of the above rules to mean "addition first, subtraction afterward" would incorrectly evaluate the expression&lt;ref name="Ball_1978" /&gt;
: {{nowrap|10 − 3 + 2}}.

The correct value is 9 (and not 5, as if the addition would be carried out first and the result used with the subtraction afterwards).

==Special cases==
===Serial exponentiation===
If exponentiation is indicated by stacked symbols, the usual rule is to work from the top down, because exponentiation is [[right-associative]] in mathematics thus:&lt;ref name="Bronstein_1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NIST_2010"&gt;{{cite book |title=NIST Handbook of Mathematical Functions |title-link=NIST Handbook of Mathematical Functions |editor-first=Frank W. J. |editor-last=Olver |editor2-first=Daniel W. |editor2-last=Lozier |editor3-first=Ronald F. |editor3-last=Boisvert |editor4-first=Charles W. |editor4-last=Clark |year=2010 |publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST), [[U.S. Department of Commerce]], [[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-19225-5 |mr=2723248}}[http://www.cambridge.org/uk/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521140638]&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{nowrap|''a''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''a''&lt;sup&gt;(''b''&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;}}
which typically is not equal to (''a''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;.

However, some computer systems may resolve the ambiguous expression differently.&lt;ref name="Codeplea_2016"&gt;[https://codeplea.com/exponentiation-associativity-options Exponentiation Associativity and Standard Math Notation] Codeplea. 23 Aug 2016. Retrieved 20 Sep 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Microsoft Excel]] evaluates &lt;code&gt;''a''^''b''^''c''&lt;/code&gt; as (''a''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;, which is opposite of normally accepted convention of top-down order of execution for exponentiation. Thus &lt;code&gt;4^3^2&lt;/code&gt; is evaluated to 4,096 instead of 262,144.

Another difference in Microsoft Excel is &lt;code&gt;-''a''^''b''&lt;/code&gt; which is evaluated as &lt;code&gt;(-''a'')^''b''&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;-(''a''^''b'')&lt;/code&gt;. For compatibility, the same behavior is observed on [[LibreOffice]]. The computational programming language [[MATLAB]] is another example of a computer system resolving the stacked exponentiation in the non-standard way.

===Serial division===
A similar ambiguity exists in the case of serial division, for example, the expression {{nowrap| 10 ÷ 5 ÷ 2}} can either be interpreted as 
: {{nowrap| 10 ÷ ( 5 ÷ 2 ) {{=}} 4 }}
or as
: {{nowrap|( 10 ÷ 5 ) ÷ 2 {{=}} 1 }}

The left-to-right operation convention would resolve the ambiguity in favor of the last expression. Further, the mathematical habit of combining factors and representing division as multiplication by a reciprocal both greatly reduce the frequency of ambiguous division. However, when two long expressions are combined by division, the correct order of operations can be lost in the notation.

==Calculators==
{{main article|Calculator input methods}}
Different calculators follow different orders of operations. Many simple calculators without a stack implement [[chain input]] working left to right without any priority given to different operators, for example typing
: &lt;code&gt;1 + 2 × 3&lt;/code&gt; yields 9,
while more sophisticated calculators will use a more standard priority, for example typing
: &lt;code&gt;1 + 2 × 3&lt;/code&gt; yields 7.

The ''[[Microsoft Calculator]]'' program uses the former in its standard view and the latter in its scientific and programmer views.

Chain input expects two operands and an operator. When the next operator is pressed, the expression is immediately evaluated and the answer becomes the left hand of the next operator. Advanced calculators allow entry of the whole expression, grouped as necessary, and evaluates only when the user uses the equals sign.

Calculators may associate exponents to the left or to the right depending on the model or the evaluation mode. For example, the expression &lt;code&gt;''a''^''b''^''c''&lt;/code&gt; is interpreted as ''a''&lt;sup&gt;(''b''&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt; on the [[TI-92]] and the [[TI-30#Models|TI-30XS MultiView]] in "Mathprint mode", whereas it is interpreted as (''a''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt; on the [[TI-30#Models|TI-30XII]] and the [[TI-30#Models|TI-30XS MultiView]] in "Classic mode".

An expression like &lt;code&gt;1/2''x''&lt;/code&gt; is interpreted as 1/(2''x'') by [[TI-82]], but as (1/2)''x'' by [[TI-83]] and every other TI calculator released since 1996,&lt;ref name="TI_2011_11773"&gt;{{cite web |title=Implied Multiplication Versus Explicit Multiplication on TI Graphing Calculators |publisher=[[Texas Instruments]] |date=2011-01-16 |id=11773 |url=http://epsstore.ti.com/OA_HTML/csksxvm.jsp?nSetId=103110 |access-date=2015-08-24 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417214906/https://epsstore.ti.com/OA_HTML/csksxvm.jsp?nSetId=103110 |archive-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by all [[Hewlett-Packard]] calculators with algebraic notation. While the first interpretation may be expected by some users, only the latter is in agreement with the standard rule that multiplication and division are of equal precedence,&lt;ref name="Zachary_1997_Maple"&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to scientific programming - Computational problem solving using Maple and C - Operator precedence worksheet|first=Joseph L.|last=Zachary|date=1997|url=http://www.cs.utah.edu/~zachary/isp/worksheets/operprec/operprec.html|accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zachary_1997_Mathematica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to scientific programming - Computational problem solving using Mathematica and C - Operator precedence notebook|first=Joseph L.|last=Zachary|date=1997|url=http://www.cs.utah.edu/~zachary/ispmma/notebooks/operprec/operprec.html|accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; so 1/2''x'' is read one divided by two and the answer multiplied by ''x''.

When the user is unsure how a calculator will interpret an expression, it is a good idea to use parentheses so there is no ambiguity.

Calculators that utilize [[reverse Polish notation]] (RPN), also known as postfix notation, use a [[Stack (data structure)|stack]] to enter formulas without the need for parentheses.&lt;ref name="Ball_1978"/&gt;

==Programming languages==
Some [[programming languages]] use precedence levels that conform to the order commonly used in mathematics,&lt;ref name="Codeplea_2016" /&gt; though others, such as [[APL (programming language)|APL]], [[Smalltalk]] or [[occam (programming language)|Occam]], have no [[Operator (programming)|operator]] precedence rules (in APL, evaluation is strictly right to left; in Smalltalk and Occam, it is strictly left to right).

In addition, because many operators are not associative, the order within any single level is usually defined by grouping left to right so that &lt;code&gt;16/4/4&lt;/code&gt; is interpreted as {{nowrap|(16/4)/4 {{=}} 1}} rather than {{nowrap|16/(4/4) {{=}} 16}}; such operators are perhaps misleadingly referred to as "left associative". Exceptions exist; for example, languages with operators corresponding to the [[cons]] operation on lists usually make them group right to left ("right associative"), e.g. in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], &lt;code&gt;1:2:3:4:[] == 1:(2:(3:(4:[]))) == [1,2,3,4]&lt;/code&gt;.

The [[logical bitwise operator]]s in [[C (programming language)|C]] (and all programming languages that borrow precedence rules from C, for example, [[C++]], [[Perl]] and [[PHP]]) have a precedence level that the creator of the C language considered unsatisfactory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dennis M. Ritchie]]: [https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/chist.html The Development of the C Language]. In History of Programming Languages, 2nd ed., ACM Press 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many programmers have become accustomed to this order. The relative precedence levels of [[Operator (programming)|operators]] found in many C-style languages are as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|1 || () &amp;nbsp; [] &amp;nbsp; -&gt; &amp;nbsp; . &amp;nbsp; :: || Function call, scope, array/member access
|-
|2 || ! &amp;nbsp; ~ &amp;nbsp; - &amp;nbsp; + &amp;nbsp; * &amp;nbsp; &amp; &amp;nbsp; [[sizeof]] &amp;nbsp; ''[[Type conversion|type cast]]'' &amp;nbsp; ++ &amp;nbsp; -- &amp;nbsp; || (most) unary operators, [[sizeof]] and [[Type conversion|type casts]] (right to left)

|-

|-
|6 || &lt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;= &amp;nbsp; &gt; &amp;nbsp; &gt;= || Comparisons: less-than and greater-than

|7 || == &amp;nbsp; != || Comparisons: equal and not equal

|-
|15 ||, || [[Comma operator]]
|}

Examples:
(Note: in the examples below, '≡' is used to mean "is equivalent to", and not to be interpreted as an actual assignment operator used as part of the example expression.)
* &lt;code&gt;!A + !B&lt;/code&gt; ≡ &lt;code&gt;(!A) + (!B)&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;++A + !B&lt;/code&gt; ≡ &lt;code&gt;(++A) + (!B)&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;A + B * C&lt;/code&gt; ≡ &lt;code&gt;A + (B * C)&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;A || B &amp;&amp; C&lt;/code&gt; ≡ &lt;code&gt;A || (B &amp;&amp; C)&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;A &amp;&amp; B == C&lt;/code&gt; ≡ &lt;code&gt;A &amp;&amp; (B == C)&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;A &amp; B == C&lt;/code&gt; ≡ &lt;code&gt;A &amp; (B == C)&lt;/code&gt;

[[Source-to-source compiler]]s that compile to multiple languages need to explicitly deal with the issue of different order of operations across languages. [[Haxe]] for example standardizes the order and enforces it by inserting brackets where it is appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.onthewings.net/2011/05/02/six-divided-by-two-bracket-one-plus-two/ 6÷2(1+2)=?] Andy Li's Blog. 2 May 2011. Retrieved 31 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The accuracy of software developer knowledge about binary operator precedence has been found to closely follow their frequency of occurrence in source code.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.knosof.co.uk/cbook/accu06.html Developer beliefs about binary operator precedence]" Derek M. Jones, CVu 18(4):14&amp;ndash;21&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pierre Emile Cartier''' (born 10 June 1932) is a [[France|French]] [[mathematician]]. An associate of the [[Bourbaki group]] and at one time a colleague of [[Alexander Grothendieck]], his interests have ranged over [[algebraic geometry]], [[representation theory]], [[mathematical physics]], and [[category theory]].

He studied at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in [[Paris]] under [[Henri Cartan]] and [[André Weil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy |id=56562 |name=Pierre Cartier }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since his 1958 [[thesis]] on algebraic geometry he has worked in a number of fields. He is known for the introduction of the [[Cartier operator]] in algebraic geometry in characteristic ''p'', and for work on duality of [[abelian varieties]] and on [[formal group]]s. He is the eponym of [[Cartier divisor]]s and [[Cartier duality]].

From 1961 to 1971 he was a Professor at the [[University of Strasbourg]].  In 1970 he was an Invited Speaker at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in [[Nice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cartier, Pierre|chapter=Groupes formels, fonctions automorphes et fonctions zeta des courbes elliptiques|title=''In:'' Actes des Congrés intern.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6554">{{Cleanup|reason=This page is about positive Hilbert space operators. The discussion on positive operators on ordered Banach spaces probably does not belong here.|date=October 2013}}

In [[mathematics]], especially [[functional analysis]], a [[self-adjoint]] (or [[Hermitian]]) element &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of a [[C*-algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is called '''positive''' if its [[spectrum of an operator|spectrum]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma(A)&lt;/math&gt; consists of non-negative real numbers. Moreover, an element &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of a C*-algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is positive if and only if there is some &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A = B^* B&lt;/math&gt;. A positive element is self-adjoint and thus [[normal element|normal]].

If &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is a [[bounded operator|bounded]] [[linear operator]] on a complex [[Hilbert space]] &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, then this notion coincides with the condition that &lt;!-- &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is self-adjoint and --&gt; &lt;!-- No need to demand this explicitly, "self-adjointness" follows automatically!--&gt; &lt;!-- "self-adjointness only follows in complex Hilbert spaces!; counter example for real Hilbert space: 2x2 matrix ((4 , 1), (0, 4))--&gt; &lt;math&gt;\langle Tx,x \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is non-negative for every vector &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;!-- Is "boundedness" needed here? (Yes, boundedness is equivalent to continuity) Doesn't positivity imply continuity? (No, there are non-positive linear operators, see below). You mean, there are unbounded positive linear operators. Anyway, in the first place positivity is defined for operators that are bounded.--&gt; Note that &lt;math&gt;\langle Tx,x \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is real for every &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is self-adjoint. &lt;!--This equivalence is a standard result in the theory of operators on Hilbert spaces. Reference needed?--&gt; Hence, a positive operator on a Hilbert space is always [[self-adjoint operator|self-adjoint]] (and a self-adjoint ''everywhere defined'' operator on a Hilbert space is always bounded because of the [[Hellinger-Toeplitz theorem]]).

The set of positive elements of a C*-algebra forms a [[convex cone]].

== Positive and positive definite operators ==
A bounded linear operator &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; on an [[inner product space]] &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''positive'' (or ''positive semidefinite'') if &lt;math&gt;P = S^*S&lt;/math&gt; for some bounded operator &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, and is said to be ''positive definite'' if &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is also [[Strictly singular operator|non-singular]]. &lt;!-- link to a page on non-singular operators needed!--&gt;

&lt;!--Relevant theorems:--&gt;
'''(I)''' The following conditions for a bounded operator &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; to be positive semidefinite are equivalent:
* &lt;math&gt;P = S^*S&lt;/math&gt; for some bounded operator &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;P = T^2&lt;/math&gt; for some self-adjoint operator &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;\langle Pu,u \rangle \geq 0, \forall u \in V&lt;/math&gt;.

'''(II)''' The following conditions for a bounded operator &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; to be positive definite are equivalent:
* &lt;math&gt;P = S^*S&lt;/math&gt; for some non-singular bounded operator &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;P = T^2&lt;/math&gt; for some non-singular self-adjoint operator &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;\langle Pu,u \rangle &gt; 0, \forall u \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.

'''(III)''' A complex matrix &lt;math&gt;A = \begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; represents a positive (semi)definite operator if and only if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is [[hermitian matrix|Hermitian]] (or self-adjoint) &lt;!--(that is &lt;math&gt;A^* = A&lt;/math&gt; in the complex case and &lt;math&gt;A^T = A&lt;/math&gt; in the real case)--&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\det(A) = ad - bc&lt;/math&gt; are (strictly) positive real numbers. &lt;!-- Note that the parentheses convention doesn't really work here, it's the other way round.--&gt;

{{off topic|date=October 2013}}

== Positive operators on Banach spaces ==
Let the [[Banach space]]s &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; be [[ordered vector space]]s and let &lt;math&gt;T \colon X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; be a [[linear operator]].
The operator &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is called ''positive'' if &lt;math&gt;Tx \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. For a positive operator &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; we write &lt;math&gt;T \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;.

A positive operator maps the [[ordered vector space|positive cone]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; onto a subset of the positive cone of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is called a positive [[linear functional]].

Many important operators are positive. For example:
* the [[Laplace operator]]s &lt;math&gt;-\Delta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\frac{d^2}{dx^2}&lt;/math&gt; are positive,
* the limit and [[Banach limit]] functionals are positive,
* the identity and absolute value operators are positive,
* the integral operator with a positive measure is positive.

The Laplace operator is an example of an unbounded positive linear operator. Hence, by the [[Hellinger-Toeplitz theorem]] it cannot be everywhere defined.

== Examples ==
* The following matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is not positive definite since &lt;math&gt;\det(A) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. However, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is positive semidefinite since &lt;math&gt;a = 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\det(A) = 0&lt;/math&gt; are non-negative.
:&lt;math&gt;A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Partial ordering using positivity ==
&lt;!--Hermitian elements are also called self-adjoint.--&gt; &lt;!--This has already been mentioned in the introduction.--&gt;
By introducing the convention
:&lt;math&gt; A \geq B \iff A-B \text{ is positive}&lt;/math&gt;
for self-adjoint elements in a C*-algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, one obtains a [[partial order]] on the set of self-adjoint elements in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that according to this convention, we have &lt;math&gt;A \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is positive, which is convenient.

This partial order is analogous to the natural order on the real numbers, but only to some extent. For example, it respects multiplication by positive reals and addition of self-adjoint elements, but &lt;math&gt;AB \geq CD&lt;/math&gt; need not hold for positive elements &lt;math&gt;A,B,C,D \in \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;A \geq C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B \geq D&lt;/math&gt;.

'''''Prime Obsession: Bernhard Riemann and the Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics''''' (2003) is a historical book on mathematics by [[John Derbyshire]], detailing the history of the [[Riemann hypothesis]], named for [[Bernhard Riemann]], and some of its applications. 
The book is written such that even-numbered chapters present historical elements related to the development of the conjecture, and odd-numbered chapters deal with the mathematical and technical aspects. Despite the title, the book provides biographical information on many iconic mathematicians including Euler, Gauss, and Lagrange. 

==Overview==
In chapter 1, "Card Trick", Derbyshire introduces the idea of an infinite series and the ideas of [[convergence (mathematics)|convergence]] and [[divergence]] of these series. He imagines that there is a deck of cards stacked neatly together, and that one pulls off the top card so that it overhangs from the deck. Explaining that it can overhang only as far as the [[center of gravity]] allows, the card is pulled so that exactly half of it is overhanging. Then, without moving the top card, he slides the second card so that it is overhanging too at [[:wikt:equilibrium|equilibrium]]. As he does this more and more, the fractional amount of overhanging cards as they accumulate becomes less and less. He explores various types of series such as the [[harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]].

In chapter 2, [[Bernhard Riemann]] is introduced and a brief historical account of [[Eastern Europe]] in the 18th Century is discussed.

In chapter 3, the [[Prime Number Theorem]] (PNT) is introduced. The function which mathematicians use to describe the number of primes in ''N'' numbers, π(''N''), is shown to behave in a logarithmic manner, as so:
:&lt;math&gt; \pi(N) \approx \frac{N}{\log(N)} &lt;/math&gt;
where ''log'' is the [[natural logarithm]]. In chapter 5, the [[Riemann Zeta Function]] is introduced:
:&lt;math&gt; \zeta(s) = 1 + \frac{1}{2^s} + \frac{1}{3^s} + \frac{1}{4^s} + \cdots = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s} &lt;/math&gt;

In chapter 4, Derbyshire gives a short biographical history of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and [[Leonard Euler]], setting up their involvement in the [[Prime Number Theorem]].

In chapter 7, the [[sieve of Eratosthenes]] is shown to be able to be simulated using the Zeta function. With this, the following statement which becomes the pillar stone of the book is asserted:
:&lt;math&gt; \zeta(s) = \prod_{p\ \mathrm{prime}} \frac{1}{1 - {p^{-s}}}&lt;/math&gt;

Following the derivation of this finding, the book delves into how this is manipulated to expose the PNT's nature.

The book was awarded the [[Mathematical Association of America]]'s inaugural [[Euler Book Prize]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mathematical Association of America's Euler Book Prize|url=http://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/writing-awards/euler-book-prize|accessdate=2007-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes grew up on the South Side of [[Chicago]]. She attended [[Gage Park High School]], where she was a cheerleader and valedictorian of her class. She studied engineering at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] for one and a half years, then left school and worked for six months before resuming her education at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] on an Illinois State Scholarship studying mathematics. There, she came under the mentorship of Yoram Sagher, who encouraged her to pursue graduate studies in mathematics.&lt;ref name="nwm"/&gt; She earned a Ph.D. from the same university in 1975, under the supervision of [[Shmuel Kantorovitz]], with a dissertation entitled ''Semi-Groups of Unbounded Linear Operators in Banach Space''.&lt;ref name="nwm"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{mathgenealogy|id=64692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

She began her teaching career at [[Tufts University]] then spent a year as a [[fellow]] at the [[Bunting Institute]] of [[Radcliffe College]]. She moved to [[Bryn Mawr College]] in 1980,&lt;ref name="nwm"/&gt; where she served as department chair for six years.
She is the Helen Herrmann professor emeritus of mathematics at Bryn Mawr, and retired in 2011.&lt;ref name="bingham"&gt;{{citation|url=http://inside.blogs.brynmawr.edu/2013/03/28/professor-emeritus-rhonda-hughes-awarded-elizabeth-bingham-award/|title=Professor Emeritus Rhonda Hughes Awarded Elizabeth Bingham Award|work=Inside Bryn Mawr|publisher=[[Bryn Mawr College]]|date=March 28, 2013|accessdate=2016-02-04}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3203">'''Robert William Genese''' (1848, Dublin – 1928) was an Irish mathematician whose career was spent in Wales.

Genese was born on [[Westland Row]] a street on the south side of Dublin on 8 May 1848. From St John's College of the University of Cambridge, Genese received in 1871 his bachelor's degree (with rank eighth Wrangler in the Tripos) and in 1874 his master's degree.

Following an unsuccessful application for the Chair of Mathematics at [[Aberystwyth University|Aberystwyth]] in 1872, he taught at the Training College in [[Carmarthen]].  He finally secured the professorship at Aberystwyth in 1879, and held it until 1919. Along the way his title became Professor of Mathematics and Astronomy.&lt;ref name=Aberystwyth&gt;''[https://www.llgc.org.uk/fileadmin/fileadmin/docs_gwefan/amdanom_ni/cylchgrawn_llgc/cgr_erth_XXXVrh1_2010_4.pdf The College by the Sea’ and its photographs]'' a history of The [[University College of Wales]], [[Aberystwyth]]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Genese introduced into the United Kingdom the ideas of [[Hermann Grassmann]] (advancing the use of vector analysis). In his 1941 book ''The calculus of extensions'', [[Henry Forder]] published numerous examples in vector analysis taken from Genese's posthumous notes. (Genese's notes were left to the [[Mathematical Association]] and then given in 1929 to Forder by [[Eric Harold Neville|E. H. Neville]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Forder, Henry George|chapter=Preface, page v|title=The Calculus of Extension, including examples by Robert William Genese|year=1941|publisher=University of Cambridge Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yyU9AAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genese was an Invited Speaker of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]] in 1904 in Heidelberg with talk ''On some useful theorems in the continued multiplication of a regressive product in real four-point space''&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=miun.aag4063.0004.001;view=1up;seq=399 ''On some useful theorems in the continued multiplication of a regressive product in real four-point space''], Proceedings of the ICM in 1904, Heidelberg&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1908 in Rome with talk ''The method of reciprocal polars applied to forces in space''.

In [[mathematics]], the '''successor function''' or '''successor operation''' is a [[primitive recursive function]] ''S'' such that ''S''(''n'') = ''n''+1 for each [[natural number]] ''n''.
For example, ''S''(1) = 2 and ''S''(2) = 3.  Successor operations are also known as '''zeration''' in the context of a zeroth [[hyperoperation]]: H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'', ''b'') = 1 + ''b''.

==Overview==
The successor function is used in the [[Peano axioms]] which define the [[natural number]]s. As such, it is not defined by addition, but rather is used to define all natural numbers beyond 0, as well as addition. For example, 1 is defined to be ''S''(0), and addition on natural numbers is defined recursively by:

:{|
|-
| ''m'' + 0 || = ''m''
|-
| ''m'' + ''S''(''n'') || = ''S''(''m'') + ''n''
|}

This yields e.g. 5 + 2 = 5 + ''S''(1) = ''S''(5) + 1 = 6 + 1 = 6 + ''S''(0) = ''S''(6) + 0 = 7 + 0 = 7

Several ways have been proposed to construct the natural numbers using set theory, see [[set-theoretic definition of natural numbers]]. A common approach is to define the number 0 to be the empty set {}, and the successor ''S''(''x'') to be ''x'' ∪ { ''x'' }. The [[axiom of infinity]] then guarantees the existence of a set ℕ that contains 0 and is [[Closure (mathematics)#Closure operator|closed]] with respect to ''S''; members of ℕ are called natural numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Halmos, Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The successor function is the level-0 foundation of the infinite hierarchy of [[hyperoperation]]s (used to build [[addition]], [[multiplication]], [[exponentiation]], [[tetration]], etc.).

It is also one of the primitive functions used in the characterization of computability by [[computable function|recursive function]]s.

The '''IEEE Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science''' ('''FOCS''') is an [[academic conference]] in the field of [[theoretical computer science]]. FOCS is sponsored by the [[IEEE Computer Society]].

As {{harvtxt|Fich|1996}} writes, FOCS and its annual [[Association for Computing Machinery]] counterpart STOC (the [[Symposium on Theory of Computing]]) are considered the two top conferences in theoretical computer science, considered broadly: they “are forums for some of the best work throughout theory of computing that promote breadth among theory of computing researchers and help to keep the community together.” {{harvtxt|Johnson|1984}} includes regular attendance at FOCS and STOC as one of several defining characteristics of theoretical computer scientists.

== Awards ==

The [[Knuth Prize]] for outstanding contributions to theoretical computer science is presented alternately at FOCS and [[STOC]].  Works of the highest quality presented at the conference are awarded the Best Paper Award&lt;ref&gt;http://jeffhuang.com/best_paper_awards.html#focs&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition, the [[Machtey Award]] is presented to the best student-authored paper in FOCS.

== History ==

In 1960–1965, FOCS was known as the '''Symposium on Switching Circuit Theory and Logical Design''', and in 1966–1974 it was known as the '''Symposium on Switching and Automata Theory'''. The current name has been used since 1975. Since 1973, the cover page of the conference proceedings has featured an artwork entitled ''synapse'', by [[Alvy Ray Smith]], who has also been the author of three papers in the conference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alvyray.com/Art/Synapse.htm Alvy Ray Smith synapse FOCS cover].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==

FOCS is almost exclusively held in North America, and in particular in the United States, with few exceptions&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieee-focs.org/ IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS)]&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9556">In [[mathematics]] before the 1970s, the term '''''umbral calculus''''' referred to the surprising similarity between seemingly unrelated [[polynomial equation]]s and certain shadowy techniques used to 'prove' them. These techniques were introduced by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=John Blissard|first=John|last=Blissard|year=1861}} and are sometimes called '''Blissard's symbolic method'''. They are often attributed to [[Édouard Lucas]] (or [[James Joseph Sylvester]]), who used the technique extensively.&lt;ref&gt;E. T. Bell, "The History of Blissard's Symbolic Method, with a Sketch of its Inventor's Life", ''The American Mathematical Monthly'' '''45''':7 (1938), pp. 414–421.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Short History ==
In the 1930s and 1940s, [[Eric Temple Bell]] attempted to set the umbral calculus on a rigorous footing.

In the 1970s, [[Steven Roman]], [[Gian-Carlo Rota]], and others developed the umbral calculus by means of [[linear functional]]s on spaces of polynomials. Currently, ''umbral calculus'' refers to the study of [[Sheffer sequence]]s, including polynomial sequences of [[binomial type]] and [[Appell sequence]]s, but may encompass systematic correspondence techniques of the [[calculus of finite differences]].

==The 19th-century umbral calculus==
The method is a notational procedure used for deriving identities involving indexed sequences of numbers by ''pretending that the indices are exponents''.  Construed literally, it is absurd, and yet it is successful: identities derived via the umbral calculus can also be properly derived by more complicated methods that can be taken literally without logical difficulty.

An example involves the [[Bernoulli polynomials]].  Consider, for example, the ordinary [[binomial expansion]] (which contains a [[binomial coefficient]]):

:&lt;math&gt;(y+x)^n=\sum_{k=0}^n{n\choose k}y^{n-k} x^k&lt;/math&gt;

and the remarkably similar-looking relation on the [[Bernoulli polynomials]]:

:&lt;math&gt;B_n(y+x)=\sum_{k=0}^n{n\choose k}B_{n-k}(y) x^k.&lt;/math&gt;

Compare also the ordinary derivative

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} x^n = nx^{n-1} &lt;/math&gt;

to a very similar-looking relation on the Bernoulli polynomials: 
  
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} B_n(x) = nB_{n-1}(x).&lt;/math&gt;

These similarities allow one to construct ''umbral'' proofs, which, on the surface, cannot be correct, but seem to work anyway.  Thus, for example,  by pretending that the subscript ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k'' is an exponent:

:&lt;math&gt;B_n(x)=\sum_{k=0}^n {n\choose k}b^{n-k}x^k=(b+x)^n,&lt;/math&gt;

and then differentiating, one gets the desired result:

:&lt;math&gt;B_n'(x)=n(b+x)^{n-1}=nB_{n-1}(x).&lt;/math&gt;

In the above, the variable ''b'' is an "umbra" ([[Latin]] for ''shadow'').

See also [[Faulhaber's formula]].

==Umbral Taylor series==
Similar relationships were also observed in the theory of [[finite differences]]. The umbral version of the [[Taylor series]] is given by a similar expression involving the ''k''-th [[forward difference]]s &lt;math&gt;\Delta^k [f]&lt;/math&gt; of a [[polynomial]] function ''f'',

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{\Delta^k [f](0)}{k!}(x)_k&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;(x)_k=x(x-1)(x-2)\cdots(x-k+1)&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[Pochhammer symbol]] used here for the falling sequential product.  A similar relationship holds for the backward differences and rising factorial.

This series is also known as the [[Finite difference#Newton's_series|''Newton series'']] or '''Newton's forward difference expansion'''.
The analogy to Taylor's expansion is utilized in the [[calculus of finite differences]].

==Bell and Riordan==

In the 1930s and 1940s, [[Eric Temple Bell]] tried unsuccessfully to make this kind of argument logically rigorous. The [[combinatorics|combinatorialist]] [[John Riordan (mathematician)|John Riordan]] in his book ''Combinatorial Identities'' published in the 1960s, used techniques of this sort extensively.

==The modern umbral calculus==

Another combinatorialist, [[Gian-Carlo Rota]], pointed out that the mystery vanishes if one considers the [[linear functional]] ''L'' on polynomials in ''z'' defined by

:&lt;math&gt;L\left(z^n\right)= B_n(0)= B_n.&lt;/math&gt;

Then, using the definition of the Bernoulli polynomials and the definition and linearity of ''L'', one can write

:&lt;math&gt;
B_n(x) =\sum_{k=0}^n{n\choose k}B_{n-k}x^k = \sum_{k=0}^n{n\choose k}L\left(z^{n-k}\right)x^k = L\left(\sum_{k=0}^n{n\choose k}z^{n-k}x^k\right) = L\left((z+x)^n\right).
&lt;/math&gt;

This enables one to replace occurrences of &lt;math&gt;B_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;L((z+x)^n)&lt;/math&gt;, that is, move the ''n'' from a subscript to a superscript (the key operation of umbral calculus).
For instance, we can now prove that
:&lt;math&gt;B_n(y+x)=\sum_{k=0}^n{n\choose k}B_{n-k}(y) x^k&lt;/math&gt;
by expanding the right-hand side as
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^n{n\choose k}B_{n-k}(y) x^k = \sum_{k=0}^n{n\choose k}L\left((z+y)^{n-k}\right) x^k = L\left(\sum_{k=0}^n{n\choose k}(z+y)^{n-k} x^k\right) = L\left((z+x+y)^n\right) = B_n(x+y).&lt;/math&gt;
Rota later stated that much confusion resulted from the failure to distinguish between three [[equivalence relation]]s that occur frequently in this topic, all of which were denoted by "=". &lt;!-- Details need to be added here. --&gt;

In a paper published in 1964, Rota used umbral methods to establish the [[recursion]] formula satisfied by the [[Bell numbers]], which enumerate [[partition of a set|partitions]] of finite sets.

In the paper of Roman and Rota cited below, the umbral calculus is characterized as the study of the '''umbral algebra''', defined as the [[algebra over a field|algebra]] of linear functionals on the [[vector space]] of polynomials in a variable ''x'', with a product ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of linear functionals defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\langle L_1 L_2 \mid x^n \rangle = \sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k}\langle L_1 \mid x^k\rangle \langle L_2 \mid x^{n-k} \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

When [[polynomial sequence]]s replace sequences of numbers as images of ''y''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; under the linear mapping ''L'', then the umbral method is seen to be an essential component of Rota's general theory of special polynomials, and that theory is the '''umbral calculus''' by some more modern definitions of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rota | first1 = G.

Another is the article titled [[Sheffer sequence]].

Rota later applied umbral calculus extensively in his paper with Shen to study the various combinatorial properties of the [[cumulant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;G.-C. Rota and J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2159">In [[mathematics]], a '''weakly symmetric space''' is a notion introduced by the Norwegian mathematician [[Atle Selberg]] in the 1950s as a generalisation of [[symmetric space]], due to [[Élie Cartan]]. Geometrically the spaces are defined as complete [[Riemannian manifold]]s such that any two points can be exchanged by an [[isometry]], the symmetric case being when the isometry is required to have period two. The classification of weakly symmetric spaces relies on that of periodic automorphisms of complex [[semisimple Lie algebra]]s. They provide examples of [[Gelfand pair]]s, although the corresponding theory of [[Zonal spherical function|spherical functions]] in [[harmonic analysis]], known for symmetric spaces, has not yet been developed.

In the [[mathematical]] discipline of [[graph theory]], a '''wheel graph''' is a graph formed by connecting a single [[universal vertex]] to all vertices of a [[Cycle graph|cycle]]. A wheel graph with ''n'' vertices can also be defined as the 1-[[Skeleton (topology)|skeleton]] of an (''n''-1)-gonal [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]]. Some authors&lt;ref&gt;{{mathworld | urlname = WheelGraph | title = Wheel Graph}}&lt;/ref&gt; write ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; to denote a wheel graph with ''n'' vertices (n ≥ 4); other authors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosen |first=Kenneth H. |year=2011 |title=Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications |edition=7th |publisher=McGraw-Hill |page=655 |isbn=0073383090}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead use ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; to denote a wheel graph with ''n''+1 vertices (n ≥ 3), which is formed by connecting a single vertex to all vertices of a cycle of length ''n''. In the rest of this article we use the former notation. 

==Set-builder construction==
Given a vertex set of {1,2,3,…,v}, the edge set of the wheel graph can be represented in [[set-builder notation]] by {{1,2},{1,3},…,{1,v},{2,3},{3,4},…,{v-1,v},{v,2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Trudeau|first=Richard J.|title=Introduction to Graph Theory|year=1993|publisher=Dover Pub.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-486-67870-2|pages=56|url=http://store.doverpublications.com/0486678709.html|edition=Corrected, enlarged republication.|accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
Wheel graphs are [[planar graph]]s, and as such have a unique planar embedding. More specifically, every wheel graph is a [[Halin graph]]. They are self-dual: the [[Dual graph|planar dual]] of any wheel graph is an isomorphic graph. Every maximal planar graph, other than ''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = ''W''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, contains as a subgraph either ''W''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; or ''W''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.

There is always a [[Hamiltonian cycle]] in the wheel graph and there are &lt;math&gt;n^2-3n+3&lt;/math&gt; cycles in ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; {{OEIS|id=A002061}}.

{| class=wikitable
|[[Image:CyclesW4.svg|320px]]&lt;BR&gt;The 7 cycles of the wheel graph ''W''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.
|}

For odd values of ''n'', ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[perfect graph]] with [[chromatic number]] 3: the vertices of the cycle can be given two colors, and the center vertex given a third color. For even ''n'', ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; has [[chromatic number]] 4, and (when ''n'' ≥ 6) is not perfect.  ''W''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; is the only wheel graph that is a [[unit distance graph]] in the Euclidean plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The [[chromatic polynomial]] of the wheel graph ''W&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is :
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;P_{W_n}(x)=x((x-2)^{(n-1)}-(-1)^{n}(x-2)).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

In [[matroid]] theory, two particularly important special classes of matroids are the ''wheel matroids'' and the ''whirl matroids'', both derived from wheel graphs. The ''k''-wheel matroid is the [[graphic matroid]] of a wheel ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''k+1''&lt;/sub&gt;, while the ''k''-whirl matroid is derived from the ''k''-wheel by considering the outer cycle of the wheel, as well as all of its [[spanning tree]]s, to be independent.

The wheel ''W''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; supplied a counterexample to a conjecture of [[Paul Erdős]] on [[Ramsey theory]]: he had conjectured that the complete graph has the smallest Ramsey number among all graphs with the same chromatic number, but Faudree and McKay (1993) showed ''W''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; has Ramsey number 17 while the complete graph with the same chromatic number, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, has Ramsey number 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
