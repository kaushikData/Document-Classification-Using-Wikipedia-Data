      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5314">[[File:Aircraft propeller diameter.svg|thumb|Diameter of the propeller.]]

In [[aeronautics]] and marine hydrodynamics, the ''advance ratio'' is the ratio of the freestream fluid speed to the [[propeller]], [[helicopter rotor|rotor]], or [[cyclorotor]] tip speed. When a propeller-driven vehicle is moving at high speed relative to the fluid, or the propeller is rotating slowly, the advance ratio of its propeller(s) is a high number; and when it is moving at low speed, or the propeller is rotating at high speed, the advance ratio is a low number.  The advance ratio is a useful non-dimensional velocity in helicopter and propeller theory, since propellers and rotors will experience the same [[angle of attack]] on every blade [[airfoil]] section at the same advance ratio regardless of actual forward speed. It is the inverse of the [[tip speed ratio]] used for wind turbines.

==Mathematical definition==

===Propellers===
The advance ratio '''J''' is a non-dimensional term given by:&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J. (1975), ''Aerodynamics'', Section 17.2, Pitman Publishing Limited, London. {{ISBN|0-273-01120-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Spak&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/aeroastro/people/spakovszky.html Prof. Z. S. Spakovszky]. "[http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/node86.html 11.7.4.5 Typical propeller performance]" ''[[School of Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology#Aeronautics and Astronautics|MIT turbines]]'', 2002. [http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/notes.html Thermodynamics and Propulsion, main page]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;J = \frac{V_a}{nD},&lt;/math&gt;

where 
:{| border="0"
|-
| '''V&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'''          || is the freestream fluid velocity, typically the [[true airspeed]] of the aircraft or the water speed of the vessel
|-
| '''n''' || is the rotations per second of the propeller
|-
| '''D'''          || is the propeller's diameter
|}

===Helicopter rotors and cyclorotors===
The advance ratio '''μ''' is defined as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leishman|first1=J. Gordon|title=Principles of helicopter aerodynamics|date=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-521-85860-1|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jarugumilli|first1=T.|last2=Benedict|first2=M.|last3=Chopra|first3=I.|title=Experimental Investigation of the Forward Flight Performance of a MAV-Scale Cycloidal Rotor|journal=68 th Annual Forum and Technology Display of the American Helicopter Society|date=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mu = \frac{V_{\infty}}{\Omega r},&lt;/math&gt;

where 
:{| border="0"
|-
| '''V&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;'''          || is the freestream fluid velocity, typically the [[true airspeed]] of the aircraft or the water speed of the vessel
|-
| '''Ω''' || is the rotor rotational speed in &lt;math&gt;\frac{rad}{s}&lt;/math&gt;

|-
| '''r'''          || is the rotor radius
|}

==Significance==
===Helicopters===
Single rotor helicopters are limited in forward speed by a combination of sonic tip speed and [[retreating blade stall]]. As the advance ratio increases, the relative velocity experienced by the retreating blade decreases so that the tip of the blade experiences zero velocity at an advance ratio of one. [[Helicopter rotor]]s pitch the retreating blade to a higher [[angle of attack]] to maintain lift as the relative velocity decreases. At a sufficiently high advance ratio, the blade will reach the stalling angle of attack and experience retreating blade stall. Specially designed airfoils can increase the operating advance ratio by utilizing high lift coefficient airfoils. Currently, single rotor helicopters are practically limited to advance ratios less than 0.7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leishman|first1=J. Gordon|title=The helicopter : thinking forward, looking back|date=2007|publisher=College Park Press|location=College Park, Md.|isbn=978-0-9669553-1-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Propellers===
For a specific propeller geometry, Kt and Kq are often given as a function of the advance number J. It is a dimensionless number indicating some speed. It has all the components of how fast the rpm should be. These co-efficients are experimentally determined by so-called open water tests, usually performed in a cavitation tunnel or a towing tank.{{Expand section|date=March 2016}}

==Relation to tip speed ratio==
The advance ratio is the inverse of the [[tip speed ratio]], &lt;math&gt; \lambda &lt;/math&gt;, used in wind turbine aerodynamics:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spera|first1=editor, David A.|title=Wind turbine technology : fundamental concepts of wind turbine engineering|date=2009|publisher=ASME Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0791802601|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mu = \lambda^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

In operation, propellers and rotors are generally spinning, but could be immersed in a stationary fluid. Thus the tip speed is placed in the [[denominator]] so the advance ratio increases from zero to a positive non-infinite value as the velocity increases. Wind turbines use the reciprocal to prevent infinite values since they start stationary in a moving fluid.

The '''Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute''', or '''AARI''' ({{lang-ru|Арктический и антарктический научно-исследовательский институт}}, abbreviated as '''ААНИИ''') is the oldest and largest [[Russia]]n research institute in the field of comprehensive studies of [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctica]]. It is located in [[Saint Petersburg]]. 

The AARI has numerous departments, such as those of [[oceanography]], [[glaciology]], [[meteorology]], [[hydrology]] or Arctic river mouths and water resources, [[geophysics]], polar geography, and others. It also has its own computer center, ice research laboratory, experimental workshops, and a museum (the [[Arctic and Antarctic Museum]]). 

Scientists, such as [[Alexander Karpinsky]], [[Alexander Fersman]], [[Yuly Shokalsky]], [[Nikolai Mikhailovich Knipovich|Nikolai Knipovich]], [[Lev Berg]], [[Otto Schmidt]], [[Rudolf Samoylovich]], [[Professor Vize|Vladimir Vize]], [[Nikolai Zubov]], [[Pyotr Shirshov]], [[Nikolai Urvantsev]], and [[Yakov Gakkel]] have all made their valuable contributions to the work of the AARI.

Throughout its history, the AARI has organized more than a thousand Arctic expeditions, including dozens of high-latitude aerial expeditions, which transported 34(?) manned [[Soviet and Russian manned drifting ice stations|drifting ice station]]s ''Severniy Polyus'' ("Северный полюс", or North Pole) to Central Arctic. 
==History==
The AARI was founded on 3 March 1920 as the '''Northern Research and Trade Expedition''' (Северная научно-промысловая экспедиция) under the Scientific and Technical Department of the [[Vesenkha|All-Union Council of State Economy]]. In 1925, the expedition was reorganized into the '''Institute of Northern Studies''' (Институт по изучению Севера) and five years later - into the '''All-Union Arctic Institute''' (Всесоюзный арктический институт). In 1932, the institute was integrated into the [[Chief Directorate of the Northern Sea Route]] (Главное управление Северного морского пути). In 1948 the Arctic Geology Research Institute (Научно-исследовательский институт геологии Арктики, or НИИГА) was established on the basis of the [[geology]] department of the All-Union Arctic Institute, which would subordinate to the [[Ministry of Geology of the USSR]]. 

In 1955, the AARI participated in the organization of Antarctic research. In 1958, it began to organize and lead all of the Soviet Antarctic expeditions, which would later make many geographic discoveries, and in the same year the [[All-Union]] Arctic Institute was renamed '''Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute'''. In 1963, the AARI was incorporated into the [[Hydrometeorological Service of the USSR|Chief Administration of the Hydrometeorological Service]] (Главное управление Гидрометеослужбы) under the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers of the USSR]] (now [[Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring of Russia]]).

In 1967, AARI was awarded the [[Order of Lenin]]. In 1968, the institute engaged in research of the areas of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] contiguous to the Arctic and Antarctica.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2073">The '''Athens Charter''' for the Restoration of Historic Monuments is a seven-point manifesto adopted at the First International Congress of Architects and Technicians of Historic Monuments in [[Athens]] in 1931.

== Manifesto ==
The Athens Charter for the Restoration of Historic Monuments was produced by the participants of the First International Congress 
of Architects and Technicians of Historic Monuments organized by the International Museums Office and held in Athens in 1931.
The seven points of the manifesto were:

* to establish organizations for restoration advice
* to ensure projects are reviewed with knowledgeable criticism 
* to establish national legislation to preserve historic sites
* to rebury excavations which were not to be restored. 
* to allow the use of modern techniques and materials in restoration work.
* to place historical sites under custodial protection.
* to protect the area surrounding historic sites.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2923">'''Baltistics''' is a multidisciplinary study of language and culture (history, literature, folklore, mythology) of the [[Balts|Baltic nations]]. Baltistics by its subject splits into Lithuanistics, Latvistics, Prussistics, etc. Special attention is paid to the language studies, especially to the Baltic protolanguage.
Currently there are about 30 centres of Baltistics, most of them based in Europe, the [[Vilnius University|University of Vilnius]] considered to be the most active centre.

== History ==
[[File:LT-2014-10litų-Baltistika-b.png|thumb|200px|right|A commemorative [[Lithuanian litas]] coin, dedicated to Baltistics, depicts an [[amber]] disk from the [[Neolithic]] era]]

First signs of researching and comparing of the [[Baltic languages]] – [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and [[Latvian language|Latvian]] – were seen in the writings of the grammar creators ([[Daniel Klein (grammarian)|Daniel Klein]], ''Grammatica Litvanica'' 1653, [[Gotthard Friedrich Stender]], ''Lettische Grammatik'' 1783). For the first time, scientifically Baltic languages were researched and compared with other [[Indo-European languages]] in the 19th century, when [[Franz Bopp]] in 1816 laid the ground for [[comparative linguistics]]. In his ''Vergleichende Grammatik'', published in 1833, Lithuanian was included. [[Prussian language]] was researched by [[Georg Heinrich Ferdinand Nesselmann]] (''Die Sprache der alten Preussen an ihren Ueberresten erlaeutert'', 1845) and [[Erich Berneker]] (''Die preussische Sprache'', 1896). It was Nesselmann who first suggested the term "Baltic languages".

From 1718 to 1944, a seminar for the study of the Lithuanian language took place in the [[University of Königsberg]].

{{Cosmology|cTopic=Baryon Acoustic Oscillations}}

In [[cosmology]], '''baryon acoustic oscillations''' ('''BAO''') are fluctuations in the density of the visible [[baryonic]] matter (normal matter) of the universe, caused by [[Acoustics|acoustic]] density waves in the primordial plasma of the early universe.  In the same way that [[supernova]]e provide a "[[standard candle]]" for astronomical observations,&lt;ref name="ref:Perlmutter"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The length of this standard ruler is given by the maximum distance the acoustic waves could travel in the primordial plasma before the plasma cooled to the point where it became neutral atoms ([[Recombination_(cosmology)|the epoch of recombination]]), which stopped the expansion of the plasma density waves, "freezing" them into place. The length of this standard ruler (~490 million light years in today's universe&lt;ref name="ref:EisensteinAPJ"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;) can be measured by looking at the [[Large-scale structure of the universe|large scale structure]] of matter using [[astronomical survey]]s.&lt;ref name="ref:EisensteinAPJ"/&gt;  BAO measurements help cosmologists understand more about the nature of [[dark energy]] (which causes the acceleration of the expansion of the universe) by constraining [[Lambda-CDM model#Parameters|cosmological parameters]].&lt;ref name="ref:EisensteinNAR"/&gt;

==The early universe==
The early universe consisted of a hot, dense [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] of [[electrons]] and [[baryons]] (protons and neutrons). [[Photons]] (light particles) traveling in this universe were essentially trapped, unable to travel for any considerable distance before interacting with the plasma via [[Thomson scattering]].&lt;ref name="ref:Dodelson"&gt;

 |title=Modern Cosmology
 |publisher=[[Academic Press]]
 |isbn=978-0122191411
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the universe expanded, the plasma cooled to below 3000 K—a low enough energy such that the electrons and protons in the plasma could combine to form neutral [[hydrogen atoms]].  This [[Timeline of the Big Bang#Recombination|recombination]] happened when the universe was around 379,000 years old, or at a [[redshift]] of {{nowrap|1=''z'' = 1089}}.&lt;ref name="ref:Dodelson"/&gt;  Photons interact to a much lesser degree with neutral matter, and therefore at recombination the universe became transparent to photons, allowing them to [[Decoupling (cosmology)|decouple]] from the matter and [[free-stream]] through the universe.&lt;ref name="ref:Dodelson"/&gt; Technically speaking, the [[mean free path]] of the photons became of order the size of the universe. The [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) radiation is light that was emitted after recombination that is only now reaching our telescopes.  Therefore, looking at, for example, [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) data, one is basically looking back in time to see an image of the universe when it was only 379,000 years old.&lt;ref name="ref:Dodelson"/&gt;

[[WMAP]] indicates (Figure 1) a smooth, homogeneous universe with density [[Anisotropies#Physics|anisotropies]] of 10 parts per million.&lt;ref name="ref:Dodelson"/&gt;  However, There are large structures and density fluctuations in the present universe.  Galaxies, for instance, are a million times more dense than the universe's mean density.&lt;ref name="ref:EisensteinNAR"/&gt;  The current belief is that the universe was built in a bottom-up fashion, meaning that the small anisotropies of the early universe acted as gravitational seeds for the structure observed today. Overdense regions attract more matter, whereas underdense regions attract less, and thus these small anisotropies, seen in the CMB, became the large scale structures in the universe today.

==Cosmic sound==
Imagine an overdense region of the [[Structure formation#Primordial plasma|primordial plasma]].  While this region of overdensity [[gravitationally]] attracts matter towards it, the heat of photon-matter interactions creates a large amount of outward [[pressure]].  These counteracting forces of gravity and pressure created [[oscillations]], analogous to [[sound waves]] created in air by pressure differences.&lt;ref name="ref:EisensteinAPJ"/&gt;

Consider a single wave originating from this overdense region from the center of the plasma.  This region contains [[dark matter]], [[baryons]] and [[photons]].  The pressure results in a spherical sound wave of both baryons and photons moving with a speed slightly over half the [[speed of light]]&lt;ref name="ref:SunyaevZeldovich"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; outwards from the overdensity.  The dark matter interacts only gravitationally, and so it stays at the center of the sound wave, the origin of the overdensity.  Before [[Decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]], the photons and baryons moved outwards together.  After decoupling the photons were no longer interacting with the baryonic matter and they diffused away.  That relieved the pressure on the system, leaving behind a shell of baryonic matter at a fixed radius.  This radius is often referred to as the sound horizon.&lt;ref name="ref:EisensteinAPJ"/&gt;  Without the photo-baryon pressure driving the system outwards, the only remaining force on the baryons was gravitational.  Therefore, the baryons and dark matter (left behind at the center of the perturbation) formed a configuration which included overdensities of matter both at the original site of the anisotropy and in the shell at the sound horizon for that anisotropy.&lt;ref name="ref:EisensteinAPJ"/&gt;

Many such anisotropies created the ripples in the density of space that attracted matter and eventually [[galaxies]] formed in a similar pattern. Therefore, one would expect to see a greater number of galaxies separated by the sound horizon than at other length scales.&lt;ref name="ref:EisensteinAPJ"/&gt;{{clarify|date=August 2015}}  This particular configuration of matter occurred at each anisotropy in the early universe, and therefore the universe is not composed of one sound ripple,&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~deisenst/acousticpeak/anim.gif&lt;/ref&gt; but many overlapping ripples.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~deisenst/acousticpeak/anim_many.gif&lt;/ref&gt;  As an analogy, imagine dropping many pebbles into a pond and watching the resulting wave patterns in the water.&lt;ref name="ref:EisensteinNAR"/&gt;  It is not possible to observe this preferred separation of galaxies on the sound horizon scale by eye, but one can measure this artifact [[statistically]] by looking at the separations of large numbers of galaxies.

==Standard ruler==
The physics of the propagation of the baryon waves in the [[early universe]] is fairly simple; as a result cosmologists can predict the size of the sound horizon at the time of [[Timeline of the Big Bang#Recombination: 240,000–310,000 years|recombination]].  In addition the [[CMB]] provides a measurement of this scale to high accuracy.&lt;ref name="ref:EisensteinAPJ"/&gt;  However, in the time between recombination and present day, the universe has been [[Expanding universe|expanding]].  This expansion is well supported by [[Hubble's law|observations]] and is one of the foundations of the [[big bang|Big Bang Model]].  In the late 1990s, observations of [[supernova]]e&lt;ref name="ref:Perlmutter"/&gt; determined that not only is the universe expanding, it is expanding at an increasing rate.  A better understanding of the [[Accelerating universe|acceleration of the universe]], or [[dark energy]], has become one of the most important questions in cosmology today.  In order to understand the nature of the dark energy, it is important to have a variety of ways of measuring the acceleration.  BAO can add to the body of knowledge about this acceleration by comparing observations of the sound horizon today (using clustering of galaxies) to that of the sound horizon at the time of recombination (using the CMB).&lt;ref name="ref:EisensteinAPJ"/&gt;  Thus BAO provides a measuring stick with which to better understand the nature of the acceleration, completely independent from the [[Dark energy#Supernovae|supernova technique]].

==BAO signal in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey==
&lt;!--[[File:Sloan BAO Slice.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Figure 3: A slice through the SDSS map of the distribution of galaxies.

The [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] (SDSS) is a 2.5-metre wide-angle [[optical telescope]] at [[Apache Point Observatory]] in [[New Mexico]]. The goal of this five-year survey was to take [[Photometric system|images]] and [[Spectroscopic astronomy|spectra]] of millions of celestial objects.  The result of compiling the SDSS data is a three-dimensional map of objects in the nearby universe: the SDSS catalog.  The SDSS catalog provides a picture of the distribution of matter in a large enough portion of the universe that one can search for a BAO signal by noting whether there is a statistically significant overabundance of galaxies separated by the predicted sound horizon distance.

The SDSS team looked at a sample of 46,748 luminous red galaxies (LRGs), over 3,816 square-degrees of sky (approximately five billion [[light years]] in diameter) and out to a [[redshift]] of {{nowrap|1=''z'' = 0.47}}.&lt;ref name="ref:EisensteinAPJ"/&gt;  They analyzed the clustering of these galaxies by calculating a [[Correlation function (astronomy)|two-point correlation function]] on the data.&lt;ref name="ref:LandySzalay"&gt;

One would expect a high correlation of galaxies at small separation distances (due to the clumpy nature of galaxy formation) and a low correlation at large separation distances.  The BAO signal would show up as a bump in the correlation function at a comoving separation equal to the sound horizon.  This signal was detected by the SDSS team in 2005.&lt;ref name="ref:EisensteinAPJ"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sdss.org/news/releases/20050111.yardstick.html&lt;/ref&gt; SDSS confirmed the WMAP results that the sound horizon is ~{{val|150|ul=Mpc}} in today's universe.&lt;ref name="ref:EisensteinNAR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref:EisensteinAPJ"/&gt;

==BAO and dark energy formalism==

===BAO constraints dark energy parameters===
The BAO in the radial and tangential directions provide measurements of the [[Hubble parameter]] and angular diameter distance, respectively. The angular diameter distance and Hubble parameter can include different functions that explain dark energy behavior.&lt;ref&gt;

===General relativity and dark energy===
In [[general relativity]], the expansion of the universe is parametrized by a [[Scale factor (Universe)|scale factor]] &lt;math&gt;a(t)&lt;/math&gt; which is related to [[Redshift#Expansion of space|redshift]]:&lt;ref name="ref:Dodelson"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;a(t) \equiv (1+z(t))^{-1}\!&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Hubble parameter]], &lt;math&gt;H(z)&lt;/math&gt;, in terms of the scale factor is:

:&lt;math&gt;H(t) \equiv \frac{\dot a}{a}\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\dot a&lt;/math&gt; is the time-derivative of the scale factor.  The [[Friedmann equations]] express the expansion of the universe in terms of Newton's [[gravitational constant]], &lt;math&gt;G_{N}&lt;/math&gt;, the mean [[pressure|gauge pressure]], &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Density parameter|Universe's density]] &lt;math&gt;\rho\!&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Curvature of the universe|curvature]], &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, and the [[cosmological constant]], &lt;math&gt;\Lambda\!&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref name="ref:Dodelson"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H^2 = \left(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\right)^2 = \frac{8 \pi G}{3} \rho - \frac{kc^2}{a^2} + \frac{\Lambda c^2}{3}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{H} + H^2 = \frac{\ddot{a}}{a} =  -\frac{4 \pi G}{3}\left(\rho+\frac{3p}{c^2}\right) + \frac{\Lambda c^2}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

Observational evidence of the acceleration of the universe implies that (at present time) &lt;math&gt;\ddot{a} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the following are possible explanations:&lt;ref name="ref:DETFreport"&gt;
{{cite arXiv
 |last=Albrecht |first=A.

 |title=Report of the Dark Energy Task Force

* The universe is dominated by some field or particle that has negative pressure such that the equation of state:
:&lt;math&gt;w = \frac{P}{\rho} &lt; -1/3\!&lt;/math&gt;
*There is a non-zero cosmological constant, &lt;math&gt;\Lambda\!&lt;/math&gt;.
*The Friedmann equations are incorrect since they contain over simplifications in order to make the general relativistic field equations easier to compute.

In order to differentiate between these scenarios, precise measurements of the Hubble parameter as a function of [[redshift]] are needed.

===Measured observables of dark energy===
The [[density parameter]], &lt;math&gt;\Omega\!&lt;/math&gt;, of various components, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, of the universe can be expressed as ratios of the density of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to the [[Friedmann equations#Density parameter|critical density]], &lt;math&gt;\rho_c\!&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref name="ref:DETFreport"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_c = \frac{3 H^2}{8 \pi G}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_x \equiv \frac{\rho_x}{\rho_c} = \frac{8 \pi G\rho_x}{3 H^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Friedman equation]] can be rewritten in terms of the density parameter.  For the current prevailing model of the universe, [[Lambda-CDM model|ΛCDM]], this equation is as follows:&lt;ref name="ref:DETFreport"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H^2(a) = \left(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\right)^2 = H_0^2\left [ \Omega_m a^{-3} + \Omega_r a^{-4} + \Omega_k a^{-2} + \Omega_\Lambda a^{-3(1+w)} \right ]&lt;/math&gt;
where m is matter, r is radiation, k is curvature, Λ is dark energy, and w is the [[Equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]].  Measurements of the [[CMB]] from [[WMAP]] put tight constraints on many of these [[Lambda-CDM model#Parameters|parameters]]; however it is important to confirm and further constrain them using an independent method with different systematics.

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20100703051259/http://cmb.as.arizona.edu/~eisenste/acousticpeak/paperfigs/xi_jack.eps.gif BAO signal] is a [[standard ruler]] such that the length of the sound horizon can be measured as a function of [[cosmic time]].&lt;ref name="ref:EisensteinAPJ"/&gt;  This measures two cosmological distances: the Hubble parameter, &lt;math&gt;H(z)&lt;/math&gt;, and the [[angular diameter distance]], &lt;math&gt;d_A(z)&lt;/math&gt;, as a function of [[redshift]] &lt;math&gt;(z)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="ref:MWhiteSF"&gt;
{{cite web

 |title=The Echo of Einstein's Greatest Blunder

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By measuring the [[subtended angle]], &lt;math&gt;\Delta\theta&lt;/math&gt;, of the ruler of length &lt;math&gt;\Delta\chi&lt;/math&gt;, these parameters are determined as follows:&lt;ref name="ref:MWhiteSF"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\theta = \frac{\Delta\chi}{d_A(z)}\!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;d_A(z) \propto \int_{0}^{z}\frac{dz'}{H(z')}\!&lt;/math&gt;

the redshift interval, &lt;math&gt;\Delta z&lt;/math&gt;, can be measured from the data and thus determining the Hubble parameter as a function of redshift:

:&lt;math&gt;c\Delta z = H(z)\Delta\chi\!&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the BAO technique helps constrain cosmological parameters and provide further insight into the nature of dark energy.

'''Bordels Mobiles de Campagne''' or '''Bordel Militaire de Campagne''' (both abbreviated to '''BMC''') is a [[French language|French]] term for the mobile [[brothel]]s which were used during [[World War I]], [[Second World War]], and [[First Indochina War]] to supply [[prostitution]] services to [[France|French]] [[soldier]]s who were facing combat in areas where brothels were unusual, such as at the [[front line]] or in isolated [[garrison]]s.&lt;ref&gt;World Association of International Studies [http://cgi.stanford.edu/group/wais/cgi-bin/index.php?p=2351 article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612081843/http://cgi.stanford.edu/group/wais/cgi-bin/index.php?p=2351 |date=2007-06-12 }}, retrieved on March 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tlv"&gt;''The Last Valley'' [[Martin Windrow]], 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The BMCs gradually generated regulation of prostitution within the French army.

These mobile brothels were in some cases officially organized by the army. They consisted of large trailer trucks in which up to ten women would work.&lt;ref name="iesv"&gt;''The International Encyclopaedia of Sexuality: Vietnam'', retrieved on March 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The first references to these BMC's were in World War I, and they are noted particularly in the Indochina War and the [[Algerian War]]. 

Almost absent in France after World War II, there were many during the Indochina War and the war in Algeria. Subsequently, only the [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]] still used them. The BMC in [[Djibouti]] was still operating until 2003.&lt;ref name="canard"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date= 24 September 2003 |title= C'est le bordel à Djibouti  |trans-title= This is the brothel in Djibouti |url= |language=French |work= [[Le Canard enchaîné]] |location= |access-date= |ISSN=0008-5405 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kedor"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kedor|first1=Roman|title=Todeskampf im tropischen Regenwald|date=2016|publisher=Books on Demand|isbn=9783739235547|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gbp6CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT19&amp;lpg=PT19&amp;dq=last+bordel+militaire+de+campagne+Djibouti#v=onepage&amp;q=last%20bordel%20militaire%20de%20campagne%20Djibouti&amp;f=false|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;

==History==
The tradition of bringing "brothels to soldiers" was started during the [[Third Crusade]] by [[Philip II of France]]. He was so shocked by the extent of sodomy and rapes committed by the Crusaders, he arranged for a full boat of "girls of joy" to be sent from France.&lt;ref name="reynaert"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reynaert|first1=François|title=Dans les bordels de l'armée française|url=https://bibliobs.nouvelobs.com/essais/20140424.OBS5078/dans-les-bordels-de-l-armee-francaise.html|website=Bibliobs|accessdate=15 April 2018|language=fr-FR|date=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first BMCs probably appeared during the period of military control of Algeria (1830-1870), following its conquest by the French army.&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; The BMCs remained confined to the army in Africa until the [[First World War]]. BMCs then arrived in France with the arrival of indigenous units from the colonies. The military command not wanting indigenous soldiers to have sex with local women,&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt; but especially to try to limit the infection of the troops by [[venereal diseases]], especially [[syphilis]] which was hardly curable at the time. ([[Penicillin]] was only available from 1944). Despite this, four years of war saw the infection of 400,000 men.&lt;ref name="benoit"&gt;{{cite interview |last= Benoit |first= Lieutenant-Colonel Christian  |subjectlink= |interviewer= |title=L'armée a fermé son dernier bordel en 1995 |trans-title= The army closed its last brothel in 1995 |work= |publisher=Guerres &amp; Histoire |location= |date=13 June 2013|language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, no official designation is given to the BMCs. The acronym first appeared in the 1920s with the regulation of signs in the French army, and from then BMCs are mentioned in military documents.&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt;

Military officials actively provided prostitutes for their troops.&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt; The "association des maitres et maitresses d'hôtels meublés de France et des colonies" plays an almost official coordinating role. It was governed by a law of 1 July 1901, and located at 73 rue de Nazareth, [[Paris]]. The prostitutes were volunteers.&lt;ref name="canada"&gt;{{cite web|title=Le Bordel militaire de campagne ferma en 1995|url=http://www.journalducanada.com/le-bordel-militaire-de-campagne-ferma-en-1995-2424-2014/|website=Journal Du Canada|accessdate=16 April 2018|language=fr-FR|date=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The military brothels multiplied during the interwar period,&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt; almost every town has a garrison or a regiment with a BMC.&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt; During the colonial wars, the organisation and attendance of BMC was public knowledge and encouraged by the army, especially in [[Indochina]] and [[Algeria]] ("the candy box").&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;  In France brothels were prohibited by "Loi Marthe Richard" in 1946. However, in 1947, the Ministry of the Armed Forces authorised the maintenance of BMC for North African units while stationed in Metropolitan France,&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt; the prostitutes for these BMCa coming from Algeria.&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt;

BMCs, were generally mobile and temporary and should be distinguished from "reserved areas" close to permanent garrisons, such as [[Bousbir|Bousbir de Casablanca]].

French literature has several times mentioned the "Buffalo Park", a BMC in [[Saigon]]. In the Indochina War, the French used women from the [[Ouled Naïl]] tribe of the highlands of [[Algeria]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard B. Fall]], ''[[Street Without Joy#The book|Street Without Joy]]: The French Debacle in Indochina'', Pen &amp; Sword, 1961, p.133, {{ISBN|978-0811732369}}&lt;/ref&gt; BMC's were known to have a significant role in the spread of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s&lt;ref name="iesv"/&gt; and were an avenue of attack by female [[Viet Minh]] sympathizers.&lt;ref&gt;''Vietnam, a war lost and won'', Nigel Cawthorne&lt;/ref&gt; There was a vast BMC in [[Saigon]] known as "the park of the buffaloes", and in January 1954, a BMC containing [[Vietnam]]ese and Algerian prostitutes&lt;ref name="iht"&gt;IHT [http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/04/01/edpringle_ed3_.php article], retrieved on March 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; was flown to [[Dien Bien Phu]].&lt;ref name="tlv"/&gt; Here, the prostitutes became [[nursing assistant]]s for the French garrison during the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu|siege]],&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt; though they were sent for reeducation by the Viet Minh after the French garrison fell.&lt;ref name="iht"/&gt;

==Closure==
The last BMC in France, that of the Foreign Legion [[2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment]] in [[Calvi, Haute-Corse|Calvi]], [[Corsica]] was closed in 1978.&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; The last BMC in [[French territory]], that of the Legion in [[Kourou]], [[French Guiana]] closed in 1995&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="france24"&gt;{{cite web|title=France's military brothels: Hidden history of the First World War - France 24|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20141212-france-military-brothels-hidden-history-first-world-war-prostitution|website=France 24|accessdate=27 December 2017|date=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kedor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;  (following a complaint by a [[Brazil]]ian [[pimp]] for unfair competition).&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trouillard|first1=Stéphanie|title=Prostituées et soldats, le couple indissociable de la Grande Guerre|url=http://www.france24.com/fr/20141213-sexe-prostitution-xxx-grande-guerre-bordel-militaire-poilus-soldat-putain-bmc-proxenete-syphilis|website=France 24|accessdate=16 April 2018|language=fr-FR|date=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of the French territories, the Foreign Legion still had a BMC in the Republic of Djibouti in 2003.&lt;ref name="canard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kedor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;

==In film==
* In the film ''RAS'' (1973), directed by [[Yves Boisset]], about the war in Algeria, a sequence shows the arrival of a BMC and its use by the soldiers.
* Stéphane Benhamou's 2013 documentary film, ''Putains de guerre'', contains many sequences and testimonials on BMC, especially in Indochina.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3111">'''Casualty estimation''' is the process of estimating the number of injuries or deaths in a battle or natural disaster that has already occurred.  On the other, [[casualty prediction]] is the process of estimating the number of injuries or deaths that might occur in a planned or potential battle or natural disaster.

Measures used to imply casualties include:
* Reported number of kills
* Number of enemy individual weapons captured after engagement
* Number of tanks and aircraft lost
* Remote sensing of mass graves

==Methods==

[[MASINT|Measurement and signature intelligence]] alone cannot give a reasonable estimate of casualties. What [[Electro-optical MASINT#Spectroscopic MASINT|Spectroscopic MASINT]] can do is help find mass graves. [[Geophysical MASINT]] can help localize metal and possibly bodies at that site. [[TECHINT]] is needed if there are weapons or artifacts to analyze.  IMINT has a role to play in  tracking movements. These all have to combine with all-source analysis. Perhaps the losses of tanks and aircraft, if available, might better predict what actually happened in a battle. [[Electro-optical MASINT#Mass graves|MASINT's mass graves capability]] is a means that has been used for remote sensing of clandestine mass graves.

Author Sam Adams' book, ''War of Numbers'' discusses, in great detail, a process of casualty estimation.  Adams was a CIA analyst who eventually resigned over what he felt was political manipulation of casualty figures in the [[Vietnam War]]. He explains how he came up with casualty figures for the NLF and PAVN.  Adams, and other U.S. analysts dealing with a guerilla war in jungle, found there were better metrics than "body count". [[David Hackworth]], for example, used number of enemy weapons captured after an engagement, and that turned out to be a good predictor of casualties, with certain limits.

==Earthquakes==
{{main|Earthquake casualty estimation}}
Recent advances are improving the speed and accuracy of loss estimates immediately after [[earthquakes]] (within less than an hour) so that injured people may be rescued more efficiently. After major and large earthquakes, rescue agencies and [[civil defense]] managers rapidly need quantitative estimates of the extent of the potential disaster, at a time when information from the affected area may not yet have reached the outside world. For the injured below the rubble every minute counts.
To rapidly provide estimates of the extent of an earthquake disaster is much less of a problem in industrialized than in developing countries. This article focuses on how one can estimate earthquake losses in developing countries in real time.

CSEM-BMP was founded as the Brunel Environmental Management Programme (BEMP)&lt;ref name="brady_2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hutchinson_1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DfE_1993" /&gt;  or the Environmental Management Centre (EMC) within the [[Brunel Management Programme]] (BMP) by [[Ken Knight (environmentalist)|Ken Knight]] and [[Ross King (environmentalist)|Ross King]].&lt;ref name="imperial_college_2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brady_2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="king_1993" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brady_2011" /&gt; The EMC later became the Centre for Sustainable and Environmental Management (CSEM),&lt;ref name="imperial_college_2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brady_2004" /&gt; then the Centre for Sustainability and Environmental Management (CSEM)&lt;ref name="rob_2010" /&gt;  and is now known as CSEM-BMP.&lt;ref name="green_energy_2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brady_2011" /&gt;

Through the EMC, BMP offered the first and largest broad senior level environmental management programme in Europe.&lt;ref name="brady_2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brady_2011" /&gt;

By 1993 the BEMP had organised 39 short courses, with 380 attendees.&lt;ref name="charter_1993" /&gt;

The EMC established the first modular masters degree in Environmental Management in 1993 / 1994.&lt;ref name="brady_2011" /&gt;

By the end of 1994 about 1000 managers had attended EMC courses.&lt;ref name="king_1993" /&gt;

From that time the focus of the EMC was on both identifying and disseminating the requisite management knowledge and theory so that directors and managers could lead their organizations towards economically advantageous environmental and social sustainability.&lt;ref name="brady_2011" /&gt;

Work has been done by CSEM-BMP on management development provision for each business function (such as purchasing, operations, marketing, and logistics) rethinking the function from a sustainability perspective, so that each function can relieve overburdened environmental specialists.&lt;ref name="brady_2011" /&gt;

== Sustainability Leadership Programme ==

In 2010 CSEM-BMP offered the Sustainability Leadership Programme (SLP) of Integrated Sustainability Management for Business. The programme offered by CSEM-BMP is for developing leadership and management. The programme is designed against the curriculum for an MBA, is based on sustainability principles and designed to meet the needs of each business function, process and level. It is designed for the needs of senior functional managers, those wishing to move into these positions, and those that need to communicate to such people. Being modular individual courses can be taken or combined in any combination including as a Masters programme.&lt;ref name="rob_2010" /&gt;

Each module on the SLP comprise one week of study and an eight-week work-based assignment. Assignments on the SLP are generally to apply the material from the module and further reading to participant's own organisation in the form of a board level paper. Additional support is provided on the SLP in the form of tutorials and self organised learning groups.&lt;ref name="rob_2010" /&gt;

The SLP highlights that any environmental or sustainability initiative requires a sound business case. It examines current management understanding and what needs to be done differently or better to operate with environmental and social limits. Core modules on the SLP help participants 'sit behind a chair' at the boardroom table, providing the ability to talk to board members and act as change agents in their organisation.&lt;ref name="rob_2010" /&gt;

SLP contributors include 50+ associates. These associates are among the leaders in their respective fields.&lt;ref name="rob_2010" /&gt;

== Commendations ==

Philip Sadler, CBE, former CEO of [[Ashridge Business School]], Patron of the Tomorrowís Company Project has stated: ìCSEMís Sustainability Management Programme has long roots and huge experience and may be the Executive MBA of the future.î&lt;ref name="rob_2010" /&gt;

In 2009 a programme review panel commended CSEM on:
* "a leading-edge programme providing what organisations need ...;
* the programme's pioneering nature giving learners business currency and practical information transfer;
* the design principles of the programme, the focus of the course design and the appropriate module content meeting students' need in creative ways;
* the tailoring of assignments to students' needs and those of their organisations;
* the learning set approach and the support it provides to students;
* the calibre of the tutors and the exceptional range of practitioner input."&lt;ref name="rob_2010" /&gt;

A '''colicin''' is a type of [[bacteriocin]] produced by and toxic to some strains of ''[[Escherichia coli]]''.&lt;ref&gt;*  {{cite journal | vauthors = Feldgarden M, Riley MA | year = 1999 | title = The phenotypic and fitness effects of colicin resistance in Escherichia coli K-12 | journal = Evolution | volume = 53 | issue = 4| pages = 1019–27 | jstor=2640807 | doi=10.2307/2640807}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colicins are released into the environment to reduce competition from other [[bacterial strain]]s. Colicins bind to [[TonB-dependent receptors|outer membrane receptor]]s, using them to [[Translocase of the outer membrane|translocate]] to the cytoplasm or cytoplasmic membrane, where they exert their cytotoxic effect, including depolarisation of the cytoplasmic membrane, [[DNase]] activity, [[RNase]] activity, or inhibition of [[murein]] synthesis.

==Structure==
Channel-forming colicins (colicins A, B, E1, Ia, Ib, and N) are [[transmembrane protein]]s that depolarize the cytoplasmic membrane, leading to dissipation of cellular energy.&lt;ref name="PUB00030669"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kang C, Postle K, Chen G, Park H, Youn B, Hilsenbeck JL |title=Crystal structure of the cytotoxic bacterial protein colicin B at 2.5 A resolution |journal=Mol.

Bio. Rev. 71(1), 158-229. [http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/71/1/158 Abstract][http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/reprint/71/1/158 pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  One domain regulates the target and binds to the receptor on the sensitive cell.  The second is involved with translocation, co-opting the machinery of the target cell.  The third is the 'killing' domain and may produce a pore in the target [[cell membrane]], or act as a [[nuclease]] to chop up the [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] of the target cell.

==Translocation==
Most colicins are able to translocate the outer membrane by a two-receptor system, where one receptor is used for the initial binding and the second for translocation. The initial binding is to [[TonB-dependent receptors|cell surface receptors]] such as the outer membrane proteins OmpF, FepA, BtuB, Cir and FhuA; colicins have been classified according to which receptors they bind to. The presence of specific periplasmic proteins, such as [[Outer membrane efflux proteins|TolA, TolB, TolC]], or TonB, are required for translocation across the membrane.&lt;ref name="PUB00014773"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cao Z, Klebba PE |title=Mechanisms of colicin binding and transport through outer membrane porins |journal=Biochimie |volume=84 |issue=5-6 |pages=399–412 |year=2002 |pmid=12423783 |doi=10.1016/S0300-9084(02)01455-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cloacin DF13 is a bacteriocin that inactivates ribosomes by hydrolysing 16S RNA in 30S ribosomes at a specific site.&lt;ref name="PUB00006229"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van den Elzen PJ, Veltkamp E, Nijkamp HJ, Walters HH |title=Molecular structure and function of the bacteriocin gene and bacteriocin protein of plasmid Clo DF13 |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=11 |issue=8 |pages=2465–2477 |year=1983 |pmid=6344017 |doi=10.1093/nar/11.8.2465 |pmc=325896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resistance==
Because they target specific receptors and use specific translocation machinery, cells can make themselves resistant to the colicin by repressing or deleting the genes for these proteins.  Such resistant cells may suffer the lack of a key nutrient (such as [[iron]] or a [[vitamin B|B vitamin]]), but benefit by not being killed.  Colicins exhibit a '1-hit killing kinetic' which does not necessarily mean a single molecule is sufficient to kill, but certainly that it only takes a small number.  In his 1969 Nobel Laureate speech, [[Salvador E. Luria]] speculated that colicins could only be this toxic by causing a [[domino effect]] that destabilized the cell membrane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1969/luria-lecture.html Luria, S. E. (1969)  Nobel Lecture]&lt;/ref&gt;  He was not entirely correct, but pore-forming colicins do depolarize the membrane and thus eliminate the energy source for the cell.  The colicins are highly effective [[toxin]]s.

==Genetic organisation==
Virtually all colicins are carried on [[plasmid]]s.  The two general classes of colicinogenic plasmids are large, low-copy-number plasmids, and small, high-copy-number plasmids.  The larger plasmids carry other genes, as well as the colicin operon.  The colicin operons are generally organized with several major [[gene]]s.  These include an immunity gene, a colicin structural gene, and a [[bacteriocin release protein]] (BRP), or [[lysis]], gene.  The immunity gene is often produced constitutively, while the BRP is generally produced only as a read-through of the [[stop codon]] on the colicin structural gene.  The colicin itself is repressed by the [[SOS response]] and may be regulated in other ways, as well.

Retaining the colicin plasmid is very important for cells that live with their relatives, because if a cell loses the immunity gene, it quickly becomes subject to destruction by circulating colicin.  At the same time, colicin is only released from a producing cell by the use of the lysis protein, which results in that cell's death.  This suicidal production mechanism would appear to be very costly, except for the fact that it is regulated by the [[SOS response]], which responds to significant [[DNA]] damage.  In short, colicin production may only occur in terminally ill cells.  The Professor Kleanthous Research Group at the [[University of Oxford]] study colicins extensively as a model system for characterising and investigating protein-protein interactions and recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kleanthous Research Group|url=http://www.bioch.ox.ac.uk/aspsite/index.asp?pageid=910|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14933">'''Computational auditory scene analysis''' (CASA) is the study of [[auditory scene analysis]] by computational means.&lt;ref name="wangbrown06"&gt;Wang, D. L. and Brown, G. J. (Eds.) (2006). ''Computational auditory scene analysis: Principles, algorithms and applications''. IEEE Press/Wiley-Interscience&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, CASA systems are "machine listening" systems that aim to separate mixtures of sound sources in the same way that human listeners do. CASA differs from the field of [[blind signal separation]] in that it is (at least to some extent) based on the mechanisms of the human [[auditory system]], and thus uses no more than two microphone recordings of an acoustic environment.  It is related to the [[cocktail party problem]].

==Principles==
Since CASA serves to model functionality parts of the auditory system, it is necessary to view parts of the biological auditory system in terms of known physical models. Consisting of three areas, the outer, middle and inner ear, the auditory periphery acts as a complex transducer that converts sound vibrations into action potentials in the auditory nerve.  The [[outer ear]] consists of the external ear, [[ear canal]] and the [[ear drum]]. The outer ear, like an acoustic funnel, helps locating the sound source.&lt;ref name = "warren"&gt;Warren, R.(1999). ''Auditory Perception: A New Analysis and Synthesis''. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The ear canal acts as a resonant tube (like an organ pipe) to amplify frequencies between 2–5.5&amp;nbsp;kHz with a maximum amplification of about 11&amp;nbsp;dB occurring around 4&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name = "wiener"&gt;Wiener, F.(1947), "On the diffraction of a progressive wave by the human head". ''Journal of the Acoustical Society of America'', '''19''', 143&amp;ndash;146.&lt;/ref&gt; As the organ of hearing, the [[cochlea]] consists of two membranes, Reissner’s and the [[basilar membrane]]. The basilar membrane moves to audio stimuli through the specific stimulus frequency matches the resonant frequency of a particular region of the basilar membrane. The movement the basilar membrane displaces the inner hair cells in one direction, which encodes a half-wave rectified signal of action potentials in the spiral ganglion cells.  The axons of these cells make up the auditory nerve, encoding the rectified stimulus. The auditory nerve responses select certain frequencies, similar to the basilar membrane. For lower frequencies, the fibers exhibit "phase locking". Neurons in higher auditory pathway centers are tuned to specific stimuli features, such as periodicity, sound intensity, amplitude and frequency modulation.&lt;ref name = "wangbrown06" /&gt; 
There are also neuroanatomical associations of ASA through the posterior cortical areas, including the posterior superior temporal lobes and the [[posterior cingulate]].  Studies have found that impairments in ASA and segregation and grouping operations are affected in patients with [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref name = "goll"&gt;Goll, J., Kim, L. (2012), "Impairments of auditory scene analysis in Alzheimer's disease", ''Brain'' '''135 (1)''', 190&amp;ndash;200.&lt;/ref&gt;

==System Architecture==

===Cochleagram===
As the first stage of CASA processing, the cochleagram creates a time-frequency representation of the input signal. By mimicking the components of the outer and middle ear, the signal is broken up into different frequencies that are naturally selected by the cochlea and hair cells. Because of the frequency selectivity of the basilar membrane, a [[filter bank]] is used to model the membrane, with each filter associated with a specific point on the basilar membrane.&lt;ref name = "wangbrown06" /&gt;

Since the hair cells produce spike patterns, each filter of the model should also produce a similar spike in the [[impulse response]].  The use of a [[gammatone filter]] provides an impulse response as the product of a gamma function and a tone. The output of the gammatone filter can be regarded as a measurement of the basilar membrane displacement. Most CASA systems represent the firing rate in the auditory nerve rather than a spike-based.  To obtain this, the filter bank outputs are half-wave rectified followed by a square root.  (Other models, such as automatic gain controllers have been implemented). The half-rectified wave is similar to the displacement model of the hair cells. 
Additional models of the hair cells include the Meddis hair cell model which pairs with the gammatone filter bank, by modeling the hair cell transduction.&lt;ref name = "meddis"&gt;Meddis, R., Hewitt, M., Shackleton, T. (1990). "Implementation details of a computational model of the inner hair-cell/auditory nerve synapse". ''Journal of the Acoustical Society of America''  '''87(4)''' 1813&amp;ndash;1816.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the assumption that there are three reservoirs of transmitter substance within each hair cell, and the transmitters are released in proportion to the degree of displacement to the basilar membrane, the release is equated with the probability of a spike generated in the nerve fiber.  This model replicates many of the nerve responses in the CASA systems such as rectification, compression, spontaneous firing, and adaptation.&lt;ref name = "wangbrown06" /&gt;

===Correlogram===
Important model of pitch perception by unifying 2 schools of pitch theory:&lt;ref name = "wangbrown06" /&gt;

* Place theories (emphasizing the role of resolved harmonics)
* Temporal theories (emphasizing the role of unresolved harmonics)

The correlogram is generally computed in the time domain by autocorrelating the simulated auditory nerve firing activity to the output of each filter channel.&lt;ref name = "wangbrown06" /&gt;  By pooling the autocorrelation across frequency, the position of peaks in the summary correlogram corresponds to the perceived pitch.&lt;ref name = "wangbrown06" /&gt;

===Cross-Correlogram===
Because the ears receive audio signals at different times, the sound source can be determined by using the delays retrieved from the two ears.&lt;ref name = "jeffress"&gt;[[Lloyd A. Jeffress|Jeffress, L.A.]] (1948). "A place theory of sound localization". ''Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology'', '''41''' 35&amp;ndash;39.&lt;/ref&gt; By cross-correlating the delays from the left and right channels (of the model), the coincided peaks can be categorized as the same localized sound, despite their temporal location in the input signal.&lt;ref name = "wangbrown06" /&gt; 
The use of interaural cross-correlation mechanism has been supported through physiological studies, paralleling the arrangement of neurons in the auditory [[midbrain]].&lt;ref name = "yin"&gt;Yin, T., Chan, J. (1990). "Interaural time sensitivity in medial superior olive of cat"  ''Journal Neurophysiology'', '''64(2)''' 465&amp;ndash;488.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time-Frequency Masks===
To segregate the sound source, CASA systems mask the cochleagram.  This mask, sometimes a [[Wiener filter]], weighs the target source regions and suppresses the rest.&lt;ref name = "wangbrown06" /&gt; The physiological motivation behind the mask results from the auditory perception where sound is rendered inaudible by a louder sound.&lt;ref name = "moore"&gt;Moore, B. (2003). ''An Introduction to the Psychology of Hearing'' (5th ed.). Academic Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resynthesis===
A resynthesis pathway reconstructs an audio signal from a group of segments.  Achieved by inverting the cochleagram, high quality resynthesized speech signals can be obtained.&lt;ref name = "wangbrown06" /&gt;

==Applications==

===Monaural CASA===
Monaural sound separation first began with separating voices based on frequency.  There were many early developments based on segmenting different speech signals through frequency.&lt;ref name = "wangbrown06" /&gt; Other models followed on this process, by the addition of adaption through state space models, batch processing, and prediction-driven architecture.&lt;ref name = "Ellis"&gt;Ellis, D (1996). "Predication-Driven Computational Auditory Scene Analysis". PhD thesis, MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of CASA has improved the robustness of ASR and speech separation systems.&lt;ref name = "li"&gt;Li, P., Guan, Y. (2010). "Monaural speech separation based on MASVQ and CASA for robust speech recognition" ''Computer Speech and Language'', '''24''', 30&amp;ndash;44.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Binaural CASA===
Since CASA is modeling human auditory pathways, binaural CASA systems better the human model by providing sound localization, auditory grouping and robustness to reverberation by including 2 spatially separated microphones. With methods similar to cross-correlation, systems are able to extract the target signal from both input microphones.&lt;ref name = "bodden"&gt;Bodden, M. (1993). "Modeling human sound-source locations and cocktail party effect" ''Acta Acustica''  '''1''' 43&amp;ndash;55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "lyon"&gt;Lyon, R.(1983). "A computational model of binaural locations and separation".  ''Proceedings of the International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing'' 1148&amp;ndash;1151.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neural CASA Models===
Since the biological auditory system is deeply connected with the actions of neurons, CASA systems also incorporated neural models within the design. Two different models provide the basis for this area. Malsburg and Schneider proposed a [[neural network]] model with oscillators to represent features of different streams (synchronized and desynchronized).&lt;ref name = "vdm"&gt;Von der Malsburg, C., Schneider, W. (1986). "A neural cocktail-party processor". ''Biological Cybernetics''  '''54''' 29&amp;ndash;40.&lt;/ref&gt; Wang also presented a model using a network of excitatory units with a global inhibitor with delay lines to represent the auditory scene within the time-frequency.&lt;ref name = "wangseg"&gt;Wang, D.(1994). "Auditory stream segregation based on oscillatory correlation". ''Proceedings of the IEEE International Workshop on Neural Networks for Signal Processings'', 624&amp;ndash;632.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "wangprim"&gt;Wang, D.(1996), "Primitive auditory segregation based on oscillatory correlation". ''Cognitive Science'' '''20''', 409&amp;ndash;456.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysis of Musical Audio Signals===
Typical approaches in CASA systems starts with segmenting sound-sources into individual constituents, in its attempts to mimic the physical auditory system.  However, there is evidence that the brain does not necessarily process audio input separately, but rather as a mixture.&lt;ref name = "bregman2"&gt;Bregman, A (1995). "Constraints on computational models of auditory scene analysis as derived from human perception". ''The Journal of the Acoustical Society of Japan (E)'', '''16(3)''', 133&amp;ndash;136.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of breaking the audio signal down to individual constituents, the input is broken down of by higher level descriptors, such as chords, bass and melody, beat structure, and chorus and phrase repetitions. These descriptors run into difficulties in real-world scenarios, with monaural and binaural signals.&lt;ref name = "wangbrown06" /&gt; Also, the estimation of these descriptors is highly dependent on the cultural influence of the musical input. For example, within Western music, the melody and bass influences the identity of the piece, with the core formed by the melody.  By distinguishing the frequency responses of melody and bass, a fundamental frequency can be estimated and filtered for distinction.&lt;ref name = "Goto"&gt;Goto, M.(2004). "A real-time music-scene-description system: predominate-F0 estimation for detecting melody and bass lines in real-world audio signals". ''Speech Communication'', '''43''', 311&amp;ndash;329.&lt;/ref&gt; Chord detection can be implemented through pattern recognition, by extracting low-level features describing harmonic content.&lt;ref name = "zb"&gt;Zbigniew, R., Wieczorkowska, A.(2010). "Advances in Music Information Retrieval". ''Studies in Computational Intelligence'',  '''274''' 119&amp;ndash;142.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The techniques utilized in music scene analysis can also be applied to [[speech recognition]], and other environmental sounds.&lt;ref name = "masudak"&gt;Masuda-Katsuse, I (2001). "A new method for speech recognition in the presence of non-stationary, unpredictable and high-level noise". ''Proceedings Eurospeech'', 1119&amp;ndash;1122.&lt;/ref&gt; Future bodies of work include a top-down integration of audio signal processing, such as a real-time beat-tracking system and expanding out of the signal processing realm with the incorporation of auditory psychology and physiology.&lt;ref name = "gotodrum"&gt;Goto, M (2001). "An Audio-based real-time beat tracking system for music with or without drum sounds". ''Journal of New Music Research'', '''30(2)''': 159&amp;ndash;171.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neural Perceptual Modeling===
While many models consider the audio signal as a complex combination of different frequencies, modeling the auditory system can also require consideration for the neural components.  By taking a holistic process, where a stream (of feature-based sounds) correspond to neuronal activity distributed in many brain areas, the perception of the sound could be mapped and modeled. Two different solutions have been proposed to the binding of the audio perception and the area in the brain.  Hierarchical coding models many cells to encode all possible combinations of features and objects in the auditory scene.&lt;ref name = "decharm"&gt;deCharms, R., Merzenich, M, (1996). "Primary cortical representation of sounds by the coordination of action-potential timing". ''Nature'', '''381''', 610&amp;ndash;613.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "wangtime"&gt;Wang, D.(2005). "The time dimension of scene analysis". ''IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks'', '''16(6)''', 1401&amp;ndash;1426.&lt;/ref&gt; Temporal or oscillatory correlation addressing the binding problem by focusing on the synchrony and desynchrony between neural oscillations to encode the state of binding among the auditory features.&lt;ref name = "wangbrown06" /&gt; These two solutions are very similar to the debacle between place coding and temporal coding. While drawing from modeling neural components, another phenomenon of ASA comes into play with CASA systems: the extent of modeling neural mechanisms.  The studies of CASA systems have involved modeling some known mechanisms, such as the bandpass nature of cochlear filtering and random auditory nerve firing patterns, however, these models may not lead to finding new mechanisms, but rather give an understanding of purpose to the known mechanisms.&lt;ref name = "bregman"&gt;Bregman, A.(1990).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28630">'''Computational electromagnetics''', '''computational electrodynamics''' or '''electromagnetic modeling''' is the process of modeling the interaction of [[electromagnetic field]]s with physical objects and the environment.

It typically involves using computationally efficient approximations to [[Maxwell's equations]] and is used to calculate [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] performance, [[electromagnetic compatibility]], [[radar cross section]] and electromagnetic [[wave propagation]] when not in free space.

A specific part of computational electromagnetics deals with [[electromagnetic radiation]] [[light scattering by particles|scattered and absorbed by small particles]].

==Background==
&lt;!-- ''Why do electromagnetic modeling?   is being modeled?  What are the computational issues?''  {{Expand section|date=October 2008}} --&gt;
Several real-world electromagnetic problems like [[Scattering#Electromagnetic scattering|electromagnetic scattering]], [[electromagnetic radiation]], modeling of [[waveguide]]s etc., are
not analytically calculable, for the multitude of irregular geometries found in actual devices. Computational numerical techniques can overcome the inability to derive closed form solutions of Maxwell's equations under various [[constitutive relation]]s of media, and [[boundary condition]]s. This makes ''computational electromagnetics'' (CEM) important to the design, and modeling of antenna, radar, [[communication satellite|satellite]] and other communication systems, [[nanophotonic]] devices and high speed [[silicon]] electronics, [[medical imaging]], cell-phone antenna design, among other applications.

CEM typically solves the problem of computing the ''E'' (electric) and ''H'' (magnetic) fields across the problem domain (e.g., to calculate antenna [[radiation pattern]] for an arbitrarily shaped antenna structure). Also calculating power flow direction ([[Poynting vector]]), a waveguide's [[normal mode]]s, media-generated wave dispersion, and scattering can be computed from the ''E'' and ''H'' fields. CEM models may or may not assume [[symmetry]], simplifying real world structures to idealized [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]s, [[sphere]]s, and other regular geometrical objects. CEM models extensively make use of symmetry, and solve for reduced dimensionality from 3 spatial dimensions to 2D and even 1D.

An [[Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace|eigenvalue]] problem formulation of CEM allows us to calculate steady state normal modes in a structure. [[Transient response]] and impulse field effects are more accurately modeled by CEM in time domain, by [[FDTD]]. Curved geometrical objects are treated more accurately as finite elements [[Finite element method|FEM]], or non-orthogonal grids. [[Beam propagation method]] (BPM) can solve for the power flow in waveguides. CEM is application specific, even if different techniques converge to the same field and power distributions in the modeled domain.

==Overview of methods==
One approach is to discretize the space in terms of grids (both orthogonal, and non-orthogonal) and solving Maxwell's equations at each point in the grid. Discretization consumes computer memory, and solving the equations takes significant time. Large-scale CEM problems face memory and CPU limitations. As of 2007, CEM problems require supercomputers,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} high performance clusters,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} vector processors and/or [[parallel computer|parallelism]]. Typical formulations involve either time-stepping through the equations over the whole domain for each time instant; or through banded [[matrix inversion]] to calculate the weights of basis functions, when modeled by finite element methods; or matrix products when using transfer matrix methods; or calculating [[integral]]s when using [[Boundary element method|method of moments]] (MoM); or using [[fast fourier transform]]s, and time iterations when calculating by the split-step method or by BPM.

==Choice of methods==
Choosing the right technique for solving a problem is important, as choosing the wrong one can either result in incorrect results, or results which take excessively long to compute. However, the name of a technique does not always tell one how it is implemented, especially for commercial tools, which will often have more than one solver.

Davidson&lt;ref name="davidson" /&gt; gives two tables comparing the FEM, MoM and FDTD techniques in the way they are normally implemented. One table is for both open region (radiation and scattering problems) and another table is for guided wave problems.

==Maxwell's equations in hyperbolic PDE form==
Maxwell's equations can be formulated as a [[hyperbolic system]] of [[partial differential equation]]s.  This gives access to powerful techniques for numerical solutions.

It is assumed that the waves propagate in the (''x'',''y'')-plane and restrict the direction of the magnetic field to be parallel to the ''z''-axis and thus the electric field to be parallel to the (''x'',''y'') plane. The wave is called a transverse magnetic (TM) wave.  In 2D and no polarization terms present, Maxwell's equations can then be formulated as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\bar{u} + A\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\bar{u} + B\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\bar{u} +C\bar{u} = \bar{g}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''u'', ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' are defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{u}=\left(\begin{matrix} E_x \\ E_y \\ H_z \end{matrix}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A=\left(\begin{matrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{1}{\epsilon} \\ 0 &amp; \frac{1}{\mu} &amp; 0 \end{matrix}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;B=\left(\begin{matrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{-1}{\epsilon} \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ \frac{-1}{\mu} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{matrix}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C=\left(\begin{matrix} \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon} &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{matrix}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

In this representation, &lt;math&gt;\bar{g}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[forcing function (differential equations)|forcing function]], and is in the same space as &lt;math&gt;\bar{u}&lt;/math&gt;.  It can be used to express an externally applied field or to describe an optimization [[constraint (mathematics)|constraint]].  As formulated above:
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{g}=\left(\begin{matrix} E_{x, constraint} \\ E_{y, constraint} \\ H_{z, constraint} \end{matrix}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\bar{g}&lt;/math&gt; may also be explicitly defined equal to zero to simplify certain problems, or to find a [[Generalized eigenvector|characteristic solution]], which is often the first step in a method to find the particular inhomogeneous solution.

==Integral equation solvers==

===The discrete dipole approximation===
The [[discrete dipole approximation]] is a flexible technique for computing scattering and absorption by targets of arbitrary [[geometry]]. The formulation is based on integral form of Maxwell equations. The DDA is an approximation of the continuum target by a finite array of polarizable points. The points acquire [[Magnetic moment|dipole moment]]s in response to the local electric field. The dipoles of course interact with one another via their electric fields, so the DDA is also sometimes referred to as the coupled [[dipole]] approximation. The resulting linear system of equations is commonly solved using [[conjugate gradient]] iterations. The discretization matrix has symmetries (the integral form of Maxwell equations has form of convolution) enabling [[Fast Fourier Transform]] to multiply matrix times vector during conjugate gradient iterations.

===Method of moments element method ===
The method of moments (MoM)&lt;ref&gt;Roger F. Harrington (1968). Field Computation by Moment Methods. Latest printing by IEEE Press in 1993, {{ISBN|0780310144}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[boundary element method]] (BEM) is a numerical computational method of solving linear partial differential equations which have been formulated as [[integral equation]]s (i.e. in ''boundary integral'' form). It can be applied in many areas of engineering and science including [[fluid mechanics]], [[acoustics]], [[electromagnetics]], [[fracture mechanics]], and [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]].

MoM has become more popular since the 1980s. Because it requires calculating only boundary values, rather than values throughout the space, it is significantly more efficient in terms of computational resources for problems with a small surface/volume ratio. Conceptually, it works by constructing a "mesh" over the modeled surface.  However, for many problems, BEM are significantly computationally less efficient than volume-discretization methods ([[finite element method]], [[finite difference method]], [[finite volume method]]).  Boundary element formulations typically give rise to fully populated matrices. This means that the storage requirements and computational time will tend to grow according to the square of the problem size.  By contrast, finite element matrices are typically banded (elements are only locally connected) and the storage requirements for the system matrices typically grow linearly with the problem size.  Compression techniques (''e.g.'' multipole expansions or adaptive cross approximation/hierarchical matrices) can be used to ameliorate these problems, though at the cost of added complexity and with a success-rate that depends heavily on the nature and geometry of the problem.

BEM is applicable to problems for which [[Green's function]]s can be calculated.  These usually involve fields in [[linear]] [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] media.  This places considerable restrictions on the range and generality of problems suitable for boundary elements.  Nonlinearities can be included in the formulation, although they generally introduce volume integrals which require the volume to be discretized before solution, removing an oft-cited advantage of BEM.

===Fast multipole method ===
The [[fast multipole method]] (FMM) is an alternative to MoM or Ewald summation. It is an accurate simulation technique and requires less memory and processor power than MoM. The FMM was first introduced by [[Leslie Greengard|Greengard]] and [[Vladimir Rokhlin (American scientist)|Rokhlin]]&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Greengard and Vladimir Rokhlin (1987). "A Fast Algorithm for Particle Simulations." J. Computational Physics Vol. 73, No. 2, pp 325-348.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Rokhlin (1985). "Rapid Solution of Integral Equations of Classic Potential Theory." J. Computational Physics Vol. 60, pp. 187-207.&lt;/ref&gt; and is based on the [[multipole expansion]] technique. The first application of the FMM in computational electromagnetics was by Engheta et al.(1992).&lt;ref&gt;Nader Engheta, William D. Murphy, Vladimir Rokhlin, and Marius Vassiliou (1992), "The Fast Multipole Method for Electromagnetic Scattering Computation," IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation 40, 634-641.&lt;/ref&gt;  FMM can also be used to accelerate MoM.

===Plane wave time-domain ===
While the fast multipole method is useful for accelerating MoM solutions of integral equations with static or frequency-domain oscillatory kernels, the '''plane wave time-domain (PWTD)''' algorithm employs similar ideas to accelerate the MoM solution of time-domain integral equations involving the [[retarded potential]]. The PWTD algorithm was introduced in 1998 by Ergin, Shanker, and Michielssen.&lt;ref&gt;Ergin, A. A., Shanker, B., &amp; Michielssen, E. (1998). Fast evaluation of three-dimensional transient wave fields using diagonal translation operators. Journal of Computational Physics, 146(1), 157-180.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partial element equivalent circuit method===
The [[partial element equivalent circuit]] (PEEC) is a 3D full-wave modeling method suitable for combined [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] and [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] analysis. Unlike MoM, PEEC is a full [[spectrum]] method valid from [[Direct current|dc]] to the maximum [[frequency]] determined by the meshing. In the PEEC method, the [[integral equation]] is interpreted as [[Kirchhoff's voltage law]] applied to a basic PEEC cell which results in a complete circuit solution for 3D geometries. The equivalent circuit formulation allows for additional [[SPICE]] type circuit elements to be easily included. Further, the models and the analysis apply to both the time and the frequency domains. The circuit equations resulting from the PEEC model are easily constructed using a modified [[loop analysis]] (MLA) or [[modified nodal analysis]] (MNA) formulation. Besides providing a direct current solution, it has several other advantages over a MoM analysis for this class of problems since any type of circuit element can be included in a straightforward way with appropriate matrix stamps. The PEEC method has recently been extended to include nonorthogonal geometries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1200853 A. E. Ruehli, G. Antonini, J. Esch, J. Ekman, A. Mayo, A. Orlandi, "Nonorthogonal PEEC formulation for time- and frequency-domain EM and circuit modeling," IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility, vol. 45, no. 2, pp. 167–176, May 2003.]&lt;/ref&gt; This model extension, which is consistent with the classical [[orthogonal]] formulation, includes the Manhattan representation of the geometries in addition to the more general [[quadrilateral]] and [[hexahedral]] elements. This helps in keeping the number of unknowns at a minimum and thus reduces computational time for nonorthogonal geometries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sm.luth.se/~jekman/PEEC/Program/ Partial Element Equivalent Circuit (PEEC) homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Finite-difference time-domain]] (FDTD) is a popular CEM technique. It is easy to understand. It has an exceptionally simple implementation for a full wave solver. It is at least an order of magnitude less work to implement a basic FDTD solver than either an FEM or MoM solver. FDTD is the only technique where one person can realistically implement oneself in a reasonable time frame, but even then, this will be for a quite specific problem.&lt;ref name="davidson"&gt;David B. Davidson, ''Computational Electromagnetics for RF and Microwave Engineering'', Second Edition, Cambridge University Press, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Since it is a time-domain method, solutions can cover a wide frequency range with a single simulation run, provided the time step is small enough to satisfy the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem]] for the desired highest frequency.

FDTD belongs in the general class of grid-based differential time-domain numerical modeling methods. [[Maxwell's equations]] (in [[Partial differential equation|partial differential]] form) are modified to central-difference equations, discretized, and implemented in software. The equations are solved in a cyclic manner:  the [[electric field]] is solved at a given instant in time, then the [[magnetic field]] is solved at the next instant in time, and the process is repeated over and over again.

The basic FDTD algorithm traces back to a seminal 1966 paper by Kane Yee in [[IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation]]. [[Allen Taflove]] originated the descriptor "Finite-difference time-domain" and its corresponding "FDTD" acronym in a 1980 paper in IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility. Since about 1990, FDTD techniques have emerged as the primary means to model many scientific and engineering problems addressing electromagnetic wave interactions with material structures. An effective technique based on a time-domain finite-volume discretization procedure was introduced by Mohammadian et al. in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Alireza H. Mohammadian, Vijaya Shankar, and William F. Hall (1991). "Computation of Electromagnetic Scattering and Radiation Using a Time-Domain Finite-Volume Discretization Procedure. Computer Physics Communications Vol. 68, No. 1, 175-196.&lt;/ref&gt;  Current FDTD modeling applications range from near-DC (ultralow-frequency geophysics involving the entire Earth-[[ionosphere]] waveguide) through [[microwave]]s (radar signature technology, antennas, wireless communications devices, digital interconnects, biomedical imaging/treatment) to visible light ([[photonic crystal]]s, nanoplasmonics, [[soliton]]s, and [[biophotonics]]).  Approximately 30 commercial and university-developed software suites are available.

===Multiresolution time-domain===
MRTD is an adaptive alternative to the finite difference time domain method (FDTD) based on [[wavelet]] analysis.

===Finite element method ===
The [[finite element method]] (FEM) is used to find approximate solution of [[partial differential equation]]s (PDE) and [[integral equation]]s.  The solution approach is based either on eliminating the time derivatives completely (steady state problems), or rendering the PDE into an equivalent [[ordinary differential equation]], which is then solved using standard techniques such as [[finite difference]]s, etc.

In solving [[partial differential equation]]s, the primary challenge is to create an equation which approximates the equation to be studied, but which is [[numerically stable]], meaning that errors in the input data and intermediate calculations do not accumulate and destroy the meaning of the resulting output. There are many ways of doing this, with various advantages and disadvantages. The finite element method is a good choice for solving partial differential equations over complex domains or when the desired precision varies over the entire domain.

===Finite integration technique ===
The finite integration technique (FIT) is a spatial discretization scheme to numerically solve electromagnetic field problems in time and frequency domain. It preserves basic [[topological]] properties of the continuous equations such as conservation of charge and energy. FIT was proposed in 1977 by [[w:de:Thomas Weiland|Thomas Weiland]] and has been enhanced continually over the years.&lt;ref&gt;
T. Weiland, A Discretization Method for the Solution of Maxwell's Equations for Six-Component Fields, Electronics and Communications AEUE, vol. 31, no. 3, pp. 116–120, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; This method covers the full range of electromagnetics (from static up to high frequency) and optic applications and is the basis for commercial simulation tools.&lt;ref&gt;
CST Studio Suite developed by [[Computer Simulation Technology]] (CST AG).&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;
Electromagnetic Simulation solutions developed by [[Nimbic]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2013}}

The basic idea of this approach is to apply the Maxwell equations in integral form to a set of staggered grids. This method stands out due to high flexibility in geometric modeling and boundary handling as well as incorporation of arbitrary material distributions and material properties such as [[anisotropy]], non-linearity and dispersion. Furthermore, the use of a consistent dual orthogonal grid (e.g. [[Cartesian grid]]) in conjunction with an explicit time integration scheme (e.g. leap-frog-scheme) leads to compute and memory-efficient algorithms, which are especially adapted for transient field analysis in [[radio frequency]] (RF) applications.

===Pseudo-spectral time domain ===
This class of marching-in-time computational techniques for Maxwell's equations uses either discrete Fourier or [[discrete Chebyshev transform]]s to calculate the spatial derivatives of the electric and magnetic field vector components that are arranged in either a 2-D grid or 3-D lattice of unit cells. PSTD causes negligible numerical phase velocity anisotropy errors relative to FDTD, and therefore allows problems of much greater electrical size to be modeled.&lt;ref&gt;
For a recent comprehensive summary of PSTD techniques for Maxwell's equations, see Q. Liu and G. Zhao "Advances in PSTD Techniques," Chapter 17 in Computational Electrodynamics: The Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method, A. Taflove and S. C. Hagness, eds., Boston: [[Artech House]], 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pseudo-spectral spatial domain ===
PSSD solves Maxwell's equations by propagating them forward in a chosen spatial direction. The fields are therefore held as a function of time, and (possibly) any transverse spatial dimensions. The method is pseudo-spectral because temporal derivatives are calculated in the frequency domain with the aid of FFTs. Because the fields are held as functions of time, this enables arbitrary dispersion in the propagation medium to be rapidly and accurately modelled with minimal effort.&lt;ref&gt;
J.C.A. Tyrrell et al., [[Journal of Modern Optics]] 52, 973 (2005); {{doi|10.1080/09500340512331334086}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the choice to propagate forward in space (rather than in time) brings with it some subtleties, particularly if reflections are important.&lt;ref&gt;P. Kinsler, [[Phys. Rev. A]]81, 013819 (2010); {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevA.81.013819}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transmission line matrix ===
[[Transmission line matrix method|Transmission line matrix]] (TLM) can be formulated in several means as a direct set of lumped elements solvable directly by a circuit solver (ala SPICE, [[HSPICE]], et al.), as a custom network of elements or via a [[scattering matrix]] approach.  TLM is a very flexible analysis strategy akin to FDTD in capabilities, though more codes tend to be available with FDTD engines.

===Locally one-dimensional  ===

This is an implicit method. In this method, in two-dimensional case, Maxwell equations  are computed in two steps, whereas in three-dimensional case Maxwell equations are divided into three spatial coordinate directions. Stability and dispersion analysis of the three-dimensional LOD-FDTD method have been discussed in detail.&lt;ref&gt;I.Ahmed, E.K.Chua, E.P.Li, Z.Chen., [[IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation]] 56, 3596-3600 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I.Ahmed, E.K.Chua, E.P.Li., [[IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation]] 58, 3983-3989 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other methods==

===EigenMode expansion ===
[[Eigenmode expansion]] (EME) is a rigorous bi-directional technique to simulate electromagnetic propagation which relies on the decomposition of the electromagnetic fields into a basis set of local eigenmodes. The eigenmodes are found by solving Maxwell's equations in each local cross-section. Eigenmode expansion can solve Maxwell's equations in 2D and 3D and can provide a fully vectorial solution provided that the mode solvers are vectorial. It offers very strong benefits compared with the FDTD method for the modelling of optical waveguides, and it is a popular tool for the modelling of [[fiber optics]] and [[silicon photonics]] devices.

===Physical optics ===
[[Physical optics]] (PO) is the name of a [[high frequency approximation]] (short-[[wavelength]] [[approximation]]) commonly used in optics, [[electrical engineering]] and [[applied physics]].  It is an intermediate method between geometric optics, which ignores [[wave]] effects, and full wave [[electromagnetism]], which is a precise [[theory]]. The word "physical" means that it is more physical than [[geometrical optics]] and not that it is an exact physical theory.

The approximation consists of using ray optics to estimate the field on a surface and then [[integral|integrating]] that field over the surface to calculate the transmitted or scattered field. This resembles the [[Born approximation]], in that the details of the problem are treated as a [[perturbation theory|perturbation]].

===Uniform theory of diffraction ===
The [[uniform theory of diffraction]] (UTD) is a [[high frequency]] method for solving [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] [[scattering]] problems from electrically small discontinuities or discontinuities in more than one dimension at the same point.

The [[uniform theory of diffraction]] approximates [[near and far field|near field]] electromagnetic fields as quasi optical and uses ray diffraction to determine diffraction coefficients for each diffracting object-source combination. These coefficients are then used to calculate the field strength and [[phase (waves)|phase]] for each direction away from the diffracting point. These fields are then added to the incident fields and reflected fields to obtain a total solution.

==Validation==
Validation is one of the key issues facing electromagnetic simulation users. The user must understand and master the validity domain of its simulation. The measure is, "how far from the reality are the results?"

Answering  this question involves three steps: comparison between simulation results and analytical formulation, cross-comparison between codes, and comparison of simulation results with measurement.

===Comparison between simulation results and analytical formulation===
For example, assessing the value of the [[radar cross section]] of a plate with the analytical formula:

:: &lt;math&gt;\text{RCS}_\text{Plate} = \frac{4 \pi A^2}{\lambda^2},&lt;/math&gt;

: where '''A''' is the surface of the plate and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the wavelength. The next curve presenting the RCS of a plate computed at 35 [[GHz]] can be used as reference example.

===Cross-comparison between codes===
One example is the cross comparison of results from method of moments and asymptotic methods in their validity domains.&lt;ref&gt;
As an illustration, the company [http://www.oktal-se.fr/ OKTAL-SE] made common development and cross comparison with the French research institute [http://www.onera.fr/ ONERA], comparing Method of Moment and Asymptotic methods. The cross comparison helped the validation process of the SE-RAY-EM code of OKTAL-SE. [http://www.oktal-se.fr/website/external/rcs_plate_35ghz.jpg Illustration]{{dead link|date=February 2017}} of the comparison between the SE-RAY-EM code and the ONERA reference code (right image).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison of simulation results with measurement===
The final validation step is made by comparison between measurements and simulation. For example, the RCS calculation&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.oktal-se.fr/ SE-RAY-EM]&lt;/ref&gt; and the measurement&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.fgan.de/ FGAN-FHR]&lt;/ref&gt; of a complex metallic object at 35&amp;nbsp;GHz. The computation implements GO, PO and PTD for the edges.

Validation processes can clearly reveal that  some differences can be explained by the differences between the experimental setup and its reproduction in the simulation environment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071013230028/http://www.oktal-se.fr/website/news/pdf/RCS_35GHz_March2007.pdf full article]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Light scattering codes==
There are now many efficient codes for solving electromagnetic scattering problems. They are listed as [[discrete dipole approximation codes]], [[codes for electromagnetic scattering by cylinders]], [[codes for electromagnetic scattering by spheres]]. Solutions which are analytical, such as Mie solution for scattering by spheres or cylinders, can be used to validate more involved techniques.

Furthermore, the DSM-IV-TR notes, "Fantasies, behaviors, or objects are paraphilic only when they lead to clinically significant distress or impairment (e.g. are obligatory, result in [[sexual dysfunction]], require participation of nonconsenting individuals, lead to legal complications, interfere with social relationships)".

Although there may be no connection between coprophilia and [[sadomasochism]] (SM), the limited data on the former comes from studies of the latter.

[[File:Scribus-1.3-Linux.png|300px|thumb|[[Scribus]], an [[Open-source software|open source]] desktop publishing application]]

'''Desktop publishing''' (abbreviated '''DTP''') is the creation of documents using [[page layout]] skills on a personal ("desktop") [[personal computer|computer]] primarily for print. Desktop publishing software can generate layouts and produce typographic quality text and images comparable to traditional [[typography]] and [[printing]]. This technology allows individuals, businesses, and other organizations to self-publish a wide range of printed matter. Desktop publishing is also the main reference for [[typography|digital typography]]. When used skillfully, desktop publishing allows the user to produce a wide variety of materials, from [[menu]]s to magazines and books, without the expense of commercial printing.

Desktop publishing combines a [[personal computer]] and [[WYSIWYG]] page layout [[software]] to create [[publication]] [[document]]s on a computer for either [[Publishing|large scale publishing]] or small scale local [[Multifunction printer|multifunction peripheral]] output and distribution. Desktop publishing methods provide more control over design, layout, and typography than [[word processing]]. However, word processing software has evolved to include some, though by no means all, capabilities previously available only with professional printing or desktop publishing.

The same DTP skills and software used for common paper and book publishing are sometimes used to create graphics for [[point of sale display]]s, [[promotional item]]s, [[Trade fair|trade show exhibits]], [[packaging|retail package designs]] and [[Out-of-home advertising|outdoor signs]]. Although what is classified as "DTP software" is usually limited to print and PDF publications, DTP skills aren't limited to print. The content produced by desktop publishers may also be exported and used for [[electronic media]]. The job descriptions that include "DTP", such as [[DTP artist]], often require skills using software for producing [[e-book]]s, web content, and [[web page]]s, which may involve [[web design]] or [[user interface design]] for any [[graphical user interface]].

== History ==

Desktop publishing was first developed at Xerox PARC in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winograd|first1=Terry|title=Bringing Design to Software|date=1996|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=978-0201854916|url=http://hci.stanford.edu/publications/bds/2p-star.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Steve|title=Encyclopedia of New Media|date=2002|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-0761923824|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contradictory claim states that desktop publishing began in 1983 with a program developed by [[James Davise]] at a community newspaper in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;"What You See Is Pretty Close to What You Get: New h&amp;j, pagination program for IBM PC, " Seybold Report on Publishing Systems, 13(10), February 13, 1984, pp. 21-2.&lt;/ref&gt; The program Type Processor One ran on a [[Personal computer|PC]] using a [[graphics card]] for a [[WYSIWYG]] display and was offered commercially by Best info in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;"Type-X '85: Fulfilling the Promise of the PC, " Seybold Report on Publishing Systems, 15(2) pp. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; (Desktop ''[[typesetting]]'' with only limited page makeup facilities had arrived in 1978–9 with the introduction of [[TeX]], and was extended in the early 1980s by [[LaTeX]].) The DTP market exploded in 1985 with the introduction in January of the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[LaserWriter]] printer, and later in July with the introduction of [[Adobe PageMaker|PageMaker]] software from [[Aldus Corporation|Aldus]], which rapidly became the DTP industry standard software. Later on, PageMaker overtook [[Microsoft Word]] in professional DTP in 1985. The term "desktop publishing" is attributed to Aldus founder [[Paul Brainerd]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.optimism-modernity.org.uk/documents/index.html#note1 |title=The Stafford papers |first=Paul |last=Stiff |date=13 September 2006 |work=The optimism of modernity: recovering modern reasoning in typography |accessdate=27 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who sought a marketing catch-phrase to describe the small size and relative affordability of this suite of products, in contrast to the expensive commercial [[phototypesetting]] equipment of the day.

Before the advent of desktop publishing, the only option available to most people for producing typed documents (as opposed to handwritten documents) was a [[typewriter]], which offered only a handful of typefaces (usually fixed-width) and one or two font sizes.  Indeed, one popular desktop publishing book was entitled ''The Mac is not a typewriter'', and it had to actually explain how a Mac could do so much more than a typewriter.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Williams, ''The Mac is not a typewriter: A style manual for creating professional-level type on your Macintosh'' (Berkeley: Peachpit Press, 1990), 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ability to create [[WYSIWYG]] page layouts on screen and then [[printing|print]] pages containing text and graphical elements at crisp 300 [[dots per inch|dpi]] resolution was revolutionary for both the typesetting industry and the personal computer industry; newspapers and other print publications made the move to DTP-based programs from older layout systems such as [[Atex (software)|Atex]] and other programs in the early 1980s.  

Early 1980s desktop publishing was a primitive affair. Users of the PageMaker-LaserWriter-Macintosh 512K system endured frequent software crashes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0TAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=%2Baldus+%22pagemaker%22+infoworld+review+1987#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=MacIntosh Layout Package Remarkably Fast, Powerful | date=8 June 1987 | accessdate=2011-04-15 | last=Thompson | first=Keith | journal=InfoWorld | volume=9 | issue=23 | pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; cramped display on the Mac's tiny 512 x 342 1-bit [[monochrome]] screen, the inability to control [[letter-spacing]], [[kerning]],&lt;ref&gt;the addition or removal of space between individual characters in a piece of typeset text to improve its appearance or alter its fit&lt;/ref&gt; and other [[typography|typographic features]], and discrepancies between the screen display and printed output. However, it was a revolutionary combination at the time, and was received with considerable acclaim.

Behind-the-scenes technologies developed by [[Adobe Systems]] set the foundation for professional desktop publishing applications. The LaserWriter and LaserWriter Plus printers included high quality, scalable Adobe [[PostScript]] fonts built into their [[Read-only memory|ROM]] memory. The LaserWriter's PostScript capability allowed publication designers to proof files on a local printer, then print the same file at DTP [[service bureau]]s using [[optics|optical resolution]] 600+ ppi PostScript printers such as those from [[Linotronic]]. Later, the [[Macintosh II]] was released which was much more suitable for desktop publishing because of its greater expandability, support for large color [[multi-monitor]] displays, and its [[SCSI]] storage interface which allowed fast high-capacity hard drives to be attached to the system. Macintosh-based systems continued to dominate the market into 1986, when the [[Graphics Environment Manager|GEM]]-based [[Ventura Publisher]] was introduced for [[MS-DOS]] computers. PageMaker's pasteboard metaphor closely simulated the process of creating layouts manually, but Ventura Publisher automated the layout process through its use of tags and [[style sheet (desktop publishing)|style sheets]] and automatically generated indices and other body matter. This made it suitable for manuals and other long-format documents.

Desktop publishing moved into the home market in 1986 with [[Professional Page]] for the [[Amiga]], [[PageStream|Publishing Partner]] (now PageStream) for the [[Atari ST]], GST's [[Timeworks Publisher]] on the PC and Atari ST, and [[Calamus (DTP)|Calamus]] for the [[Atari TT030]]. Software was published even for 8-bit computers like the [[Apple II]] and [[Commodore 64]]: Home Publisher, [[The Newsroom (software)|The Newsroom]], and [[geoPublish]]. During its early years, desktop publishing acquired a bad reputation as a result of untrained users who created poorly organized, unprofessional-looking "[[ransom note effect]]" layouts; similar criticism was leveled again against early [[World Wide Web]] publishers a decade later.  However, some desktop publishers who mastered the programs were able to realize truly professional results. Desktop publishing skills were considered of primary importance in career advancement in the 1980s, but increased accessibility to more user-friendly DTP software has made DTP a secondary skill to [[art direction]], [[graphic design]], [[multimedia]] development, [[marketing communications]], and [[Administration (business)|administrative careers]].  DTP skill levels range from what may be learned in a few hours (e.g., learning how to put clip art in a word processor) to what requires a college education.  The discipline of DTP skills range from technical skills such as [[prepress]] production and programming to creative skills such as [[communication design]] and [[graphic image development]].

{{asof|2014}} Apple computers remain dominant in publishing, even as the most popular software has changed from [[QuarkXPress]] (an estimated 95% market share in the 1990s) to [[Adobe InDesign]]. An [[Ars Technica]] writer claimed that year that "I've heard about Windows-based publishing environments, but I've never actually seen one in my 20+ years in design and publishing".&lt;ref name="girard20140113"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/01/quarkxpress-the-demise-of-a-design-desk-darling/ |title=How QuarkXPress became a mere afterthought in publishing |last=Girard |first=Dave |date=2014-01-13 |work=Ars Technica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==

There are two types of pages in desktop publishing, [[electronic page]]s and virtual paper pages to be printed on [[Page (paper)|physical paper pages]]. All computerized documents are technically electronic, which are limited in size only by [[computer memory]] or [[computer data storage]] space. Virtual paper pages will ultimately be [[printing|printed]], and therefore require paper parameters that coincide with [[paper size|international standard physical paper sizes]] such as "A4, " "letter, " etc., if not custom sizes for trimming. Some desktop publishing programs allow custom sizes designated for large format printing used in [[poster]]s, [[billboard]]s and [[trade show displays]]. A virtual page for printing has a predesignated size of virtual printing material and can be viewed on a monitor in [[WYSIWYG]] format. Each page for printing has trim sizes (edge of paper) and a printable area if [[bleed (printing)|bleed printing]] is not possible as is the case with most [[desktop printer]]s. A [[web page]] is an example of an electronic page that is not constrained by virtual paper parameters. Most electronic pages may be dynamically re-sized, causing either the [[content (media and publishing)|content]] to scale in size with the page or causing the [[reflow document|content to re-flow]].

Master pages are templates used to automatically copy or link elements and graphic design styles to some or all the pages of a multipage document. Linked elements can be modified without having to change each instance of an element on pages that use the same element. Master pages can also be used to apply graphic design styles to automatic page numbering. [[Cascading Style Sheets]] can provide the same global formatting functions for web pages that master pages provide for virtual paper pages. [[Page layout]] is the process by which the elements are laid on the page orderly, aesthetically, and precisely. Main types of components to be laid out on a page include [[wikt:text|text]], linked [[image]]s that can only be modified as an external source, and embedded images that may be modified with the layout application software. Some embedded images are [[Artistic rendering|rendered]] in the application software, while others can be placed from an external source image file. Text may be [[typing|keyed]] into the layout, placed, or (with [[database publishing]] applications) linked to an external source of text which allows multiple editors to develop a document at the same time.
[[Graphic design]] styles such as color, transparency, and filters, may also be applied to layout elements. [[Typography]] styles may be applied to text automatically with [[stylé sheet (desktop publishing)|style sheets]]. Some layout programs include style sheets for images in addition to text. Graphic styles for images may be border shapes, colors, transparency, filters, and a parameter designating the way text flows around the object called "wraparound" or "runaround. "

== Comparisons ==

=== With word processing ===

As desktop publishing software still provides extensive features necessary for print publishing, modern word processors now have publishing capabilities beyond those of many older DTP applications, blurring the line between [[word processing]] and desktop publishing. In the early days of [[graphical user interface]]s in the early 1980s, DTP software was in a class of its own when compared to the fairly spartan word processing applications of the time.  Programs such as [[WordPerfect]] and [[WordStar]] were still mainly text-based and offered little in the way of page layout, other than perhaps margins and line spacing.  On the other hand, word processing software was necessary for features like indexing and spell checking, features that are common in many applications today. As computers and operating systems have become more powerful, versatile and user-friendly in the 2010s, vendors have sought to provide users with a single application platform that can meet almost all their publication needs.

=== With other electronic layout software ===

In 2010-era usage, DTP does not usually include digital tools such as [[TeX]] or [[troff]], though both can easily be used on a modern desktop system and are standard with many [[Unix-like]] operating systems and readily available for other systems. The key difference between electronic [[typesetting]] software and DTP software is that DTP software is generally interactive and "What you see [onscreen] is what you get" ([[WYSIWYG]]) in design, while other electronic typesetting software, such as [[TeX]], [[LaTeX]] and other variants, tend to operate in "[[batch mode]]", requiring the user to enter the processing program's [[markup language]] (e.g. [[HTML]]) without immediate visualization of the finished product.  This kind of workflow is less user-friendly than WYSIWYG, but more suitable for conference proceedings and scholarly articles as well as corporate newsletters or other applications where consistent, automated layout is important.  In the 2010s, {{when|date=June 2014}} interactive front-end components of [[TeX]], such as [[TeXworks]] or [[LyX]] have produced "what you see is what you mean" ([[WYSIWYM]]) hybrids of DTP and batch processing. These hybrids are focused more on [[semantics]] than traditional DTP. There is some overlap between desktop publishing and what is known as [[hypermedia]] publishing (e.g. [[web design]], kiosk, [[CD-ROM]]).  Many graphical [[HTML editors]] such as [[Microsoft FrontPage]] and [[Adobe Dreamweaver]] use a layout engine similar to a DTP program. However, many web designers still prefer to write HTML without the assistance of a WYSIWYG editor, for greater control and ability to fine-tune the appearance and functionality. Another reason that some Web designers write in HTML is that WYSIWYG editors often result in excessive lines of code, leading to [[code bloat]] that can make the pages hard to [[troubleshoot]].

=== With web design ===

Desktop publishing produces primarily static print or [[electronic media]], the focus of this article.  Similar skills, processes, and terminology are used in [[web design]].  Digital typography is the specialization of [[typography]] for desktop publishing. [[Web typography]] addresses typography and the use of fonts on the [[World Wide Web]].  [[style sheet (desktop publishing)|Desktop style sheets]] apply formatting for print, web [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) provide format control for web display. Web  [[font family (HTML)|HTML font families]] map [[website]] font usage to the [[computer font|fonts]] available on the user [[web browser]] or display device.

The '''Deutsch-Französisches Institut''' (DFI) is an independent non-profit organization devoted to research on and documentation of contemporary [[Franco-German relations]].

[[Image:DFI Villa.jpg|thumb|The '''Deutsch-Französisches Institut''' in Ludwigsburg.]]
The institute is funded by the [[German Foreign Office]], the regional government of [[Baden-Württemberg]] and the town of [[Ludwigsburg]]. Projects are also funded by external partners.

== History ==
The Institute was established in 1948, with the aim of promoting Franco-German cooperation in all areas of public life and academia. It is based in  [[Ludwigsburg]], a Paris office being opened in 2004. In 1990 the Frankreich-Bibliothek, a library and documentation centre, was opened in Ludwigsburg. 

Founding members of the DFI included prominent figures, such as [[Joseph Rovan]] and Alfred Grosser, on the French side, and the Germans [[Theodor Heuss]] and [[Carlo Schmid (German politician)|Carlo Schmid]]. The first director was Fritz Schenk (1948-1972), followed by [[Robert Picht]] (1972-2002) and Frank Baasner (2002- ). The titular head of the Institute is the president, currently the former prime minister of Baden Württemberg, [[Erwin Teufel]]. 

The Institute currently has approximately 20 members of staff, including 5 researchers.

== Profile and activities ==
The dfi conducts applied research and provides consultancy on social, political and economic developments in France and on topics relating to Franco-German relations. The core research areas of economic policy, social policy, European policy, and [[intercultural communication]] form the focus of its activities, which are mainly long-term projects, partially or wholly funded by external financing from foundations or businesses. With the aim of promoting links between research and practice, the dfi hosts conferences and seminars, publishes extensively, and provides background information for the media.

In addition to this, the Institute holds seminars and training sessions for various groups. Participants include journalists and students from France and Germany. The research staff also teach at German and foreign universities.

The Institute’s activities are chiefly directed at decision makers and those occupying positions of influence in politics, business, education and the media, but also at the German and French public.

== Frankreich-Bibliothek ==
[[Image:DFI Bibliothek.JPG|thumb|The Frankreich-Bibliothek of the '''Deutsch-Französisches Institut''' in Ludwigsburg.]]
The open access library and documentation centre was opened in 1990,  the collection focusing on contemporary France and Franco-German relations. The library currently holds around 37,000 volumes. In addition, there is a press cuttings archive containing over half a million articles, covering the period from 1975 to the present. The press archive has been online since summer 2009, although older material has not yet been retro-digitalised.

The dfi, represented by the Frankreich-Bibliothek, is a member of the information network “International Relations and Area Studies” (FIV) and thus participates in the production of the World Affairs Online database (WAO). All literature, including relevant journal articles and book chapters, is catalogued in the FIV database and can be searched via the dfi catalogue, as well as through further regional and national online catalogues. The Frankreich-Bibliothek is an associate member of the Südwestdeutschen Bibliotheksverbund, a union catalogue.

With the support of the Wüstenrot Foundation, the dfi offers a limited number of grants for short-term research in the library for both undergraduate and post-graduate students from Germany and abroad.

Hypertexts may take a variety of forms including [[imitation]], [[parody]], and [[pastiche]].

The word was defined by the French theorist [[Gérard Genette]] as follows: "Hypertextuality refers to any relationship uniting a text B (which I shall call the ''hypertext'') to an earlier text A (I shall, of course, call it the [[hypotext]]), upon which it is grafted in a manner that is not that of commentary."&lt;ref name="Genette1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Genette|first=Gérard |title=Palimpsests: Literature in the Second Degree|year=1997|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, a hypertext derives from hypotext(s) through a process which Genette calls transformation, in which text B "evokes" text A without necessarily mentioning it directly ".&lt;ref name="Herman1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Herman|first=David|title=Palimpsests: Literature in the Second Degree (review)|year=1998|publisher=MFS Modern Fiction Studies|pages=1043–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that this technical use of the word in semiotics differs from its use to mean a link in the field of , although the two are related. Liestøl's study of Genette's narratological model and [[hyperfiction]] considers how they are related and suggests that hyperfiction narratives have four levels:&lt;ref name="Liestol1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Liestøl|first=Gunnar|chapter=Wittgenstein, Genette, and the Reader's Narrative in Hypertext|title=

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9091">[[File:National Security Operations Center photograph, c. 1975 - National Cryptologic Museum - DSC07658.JPG|thumb|The United States national security operations center in 1975]]
An '''information security operations center''' ("'''ISOC'''" or "'''SOC'''") is a facility where [[enterprise information systems]] ([[web sites]], [[application software|applications]], [[databases]], [[data centers]] and [[server (computing)|servers]], [[computer network|networks]], [[client (computing)|desktops]] and other endpoints) are monitored, assessed, and defended.

==Objective==
A SOC is related to the people, processes and technologies that provide situational awareness through the detection, containment, and remediation of IT threats.  A SOC will handle, on behalf of an institution or company, any threatening IT incident, and will ensure that it is properly identified, analyzed, communicated, investigated and reported.  The SOC also monitors applications to identify a possible cyber-attack or intrusion (event), and determines if it is a genuine malicious threat (incident), and if it could affect business.

===Regulatory requirements===
Establishing and operating a SOC is expensive and difficult; organisations should need a good reason to do it. This may include:
* Protecting sensitive data
* Complying with industry rules such as [[PCI DSS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PCI DSS 3.0: The Impact on Your Security Operations|url=http://www.securityweek.com/pci-dss-30-impact-your-security-operations|accessdate=22 June 2014|work=Security Week|date=31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Complying with government rules, such as CESG GPG53.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transaction Monitoring for HMG Online Service  Providers|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/271268/GPG_53_Transaction_Monitoring_issue_1-1_April_2013.pdf|publisher=CESG|accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative names==
A security operations center (SOC) can also be called a security defense center (SDC), security analytics center (SAC), network security operations center (NSOC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Managed Services at the Tactical FLEX, Inc. Network Security Operations Center (NSOC)|url=https://www.aanval.com/nsoc|publisher=Tactical FLEX, Inc.|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; security intelligence center, cyber security center, threat defense center, security intelligence and operations center (SIOC). In the Canadian Federal Government the term, infrastructure protection center (IPC), is used to describe a SOC.

==Technology==
SOCs typically are based around a [[security information and event management]] (SIEM) system which aggregates and correlates data from security feeds such as network discovery and [[vulnerability assessment]] systems; governance, risk and compliance (GRC) systems; web site assessment and monitoring systems, application and database scanners; [[penetration test]]ing tools; [[intrusion detection systems]] (IDS); [[intrusion prevention system]] (IPS); log management systems; network behavior analysis and [[Cyber threat intelligence]]; wireless intrusion prevention system; firewalls, enterprise [[antivirus]] and unified threat management (UTM).  The SIEM technology creates a "single pane of glass" for the security analysts to monitor the enterprise.

==People==
SOC staff includes analysts, security engineers, and SOC managers who should be seasoned IT and networking professionals. They are usually trained in [[computer engineering]], [[cryptography]], [[Computer network|network engineering]], or [[computer science]] and may have credentials such as [[Certified Information Systems Security Professional|CISSP]] or [[Global Information Assurance Certification|GIAC]].

SOC staffing plans range from eight hours a day, five days a week (8x5) to twenty four hours a day, seven days a week (24x7). Shifts should include at least two analysts and the responsibilities should be clearly defined.

==Organization==
Large organizations and governments may operate more than one SOC to manage different groups of [[information and communication technology]] or to provide redundancy in the event one site is unavailable. SOC work can be outsourced, for instance, by using a [[managed security service]]. The term SOC was traditionally used by governments and managed computer security providers, although a growing number of large corporations and other organizations also have such centers.

The SOC and the [[network operations center]] (NOC) complement each other and work in tandem. The NOC is usually responsible for monitoring and maintaining the overall network infrastructure, and its primary function is to ensure uninterrupted network service. The SOC is responsible for protecting networks, as well as web sites, applications, databases, servers and data centers, and other technologies.  Likewise, the SOC and the physical security operations center coordinate and work together. The physical SOC is a facility in large organizations where security staff monitor and control security officers/guards, alarms, CCTV, physical access, lighting, vehicle barriers, etc.

Not every SOC has the same role. There are three different focus areas in which a SOC may be active, and which can be combined in any combination:
*Control - focusing on the state of the security with compliancy testing, penetration testing, vulnerability testing, etc.
*Monitoring - focusing on events and the response with log monitoring, SIEM administration, and incident response
*Operational - focusing on the operational security administration such as identity &amp; access management, key management, firewall administration, etc.

In some cases the SOC, NOC or physical SOC may be housed in the same facility or organizationally combined, especially if the focus is on ''operational'' tasks. If the SOC originates from a [[Computer emergency response team|CERT]] organisation, then the focus is usually more on ''monitoring'' and ''control'', in which case the SOC operates independently from the NOC to maintain [[separation of duties]]. Typically, larger organizations maintain a separate SOC to ensure focus and expertise. The SOC then collaborates closely with network operations and physical security operations.

==Facilities==
SOCs usually are well protected with physical, electronic, computer, and personnel security. Centers are often laid out with desks facing a video wall, which displays significant status, events and alarms; ongoing incidents; a corner of the wall is sometimes used for showing a news or weather TV channel, as this can keep the SOC staff aware of current events which may affect information systems. A security engineer or security analyst may have several computer monitors on their desk.

==Process and procedures==
Processes and procedures within a SOC will clearly spell out roles and responsibilities as well as monitoring procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://expel.io/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-build-a-24x7-soc/|title=How much does it cost to build a 24x7 SOC? - Expel|date=2018-02-28|work=Expel|access-date=2018-05-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These processes include business, technology, operational and analytical processes. They lay out what steps are to be taken in the event of an alert or breach including escalation procedures, reporting procedures, and breach response procedures.

== CloudSOC ==

A cloud security operations center (CloudSOC) may be set up to monitor cloud service use within an enterprise (and keep the [[Shadow IT]] problem under control), or parse and audit [[IT infrastructure]] and application logs via  [[Security information and event management|SIEM]] technologies and machine data platforms (such as [[LogRhythm]], [[Splunk]], [[IBM QRadar]], [[Assuria]], [[HP ArcSight]], CYBERShark&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blackstratus.com/cybershark/&lt;/ref&gt; and Elastica&lt;ref&gt;https://www.symantec.com/products/web-and-cloud-security/cloud-application-security-cloudsoc&lt;/ref&gt;) to provide alerts and details of suspicious activity.

== Smart SOC ==

A Smart SOC (Security Operations Center) is a comprehensive, technology agnostic [[Computer security|cybersecurity]] solution that utilizes leading-edge technology and tools, highly skilled and experienced human talent (composed of cyber intelligence gatherers, analysts, and security experts), and proactive [[cyberwarfare]] principles to prevent and neutralize threats against an organization’s digital infrastructure, assets, and data.

== Other types and references ==
In addition, there are many other commonly referenced terms related to the original "ISOC" title including the following:
* NSOC, Network Security Operations Center
* ASOC, Advanced Security Operations Center
* GSOC, Global Security Operations Center
* vSOC, Virtual Security Operations Center&lt;ref&gt;https://www.alienvault.com/resource-center/videos/what-is-a-virtual-security-operations-center-vsoc&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jewish philosophy''' ({{Lang-he|פילוסופיה יהודית}}) includes all [[philosophy]] carried out by Jews, or in relation to the religion of [[Judaism]].  Until modern ''[[Haskalah]]'' (Jewish Enlightenment) and [[Jewish emancipation]], Jewish philosophy was preoccupied with attempts to reconcile coherent new ideas into the tradition of [[Rabbinic Judaism]], thus organizing emergent ideas that are not necessarily Jewish into a uniquely Jewish scholastic framework and world-view. With their acceptance into modern society, Jews with secular educations embraced or developed entirely new philosophies to meet the demands of the world in which they now found themselves.

Medieval re-discovery of [[ancient Greek philosophy]] among the [[Geonim]] of 10th century Babylonian academies brought rationalist philosophy into [[Tanakh|Biblical]]-[[Talmud]]ic Judaism. The philosophy was generally in competition with [[Kabbalah]]. Both schools would become part of classic [[Rabbinic literature]], though the decline of scholastic [[rationalism]] coincided with historical events which drew Jews to the Kabbalistic approach. For [[Ashkenazi Jews]], emancipation and encounter with secular thought from the 18th century onwards altered how philosophy was viewed. [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] and [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] communities had later more ambivalent interaction with secular culture than in Western Europe. In the varied responses to modernity, Jewish philosophical ideas were developed across the range of emerging [[Jewish religious movements|religious movements]]. These developments could be seen as either continuations of or breaks from the canon of [[Rabbinic]] philosophy of the Middle Ages, as well as the other historical [[dialectic]] aspects of Jewish thought, and resulted in diverse contemporary Jewish attitudes to philosophical methods.

== Ancient Jewish philosophy ==

=== Philosophy in the Bible ===
[[Rabbinic literature]] sometimes views Abraham as a [[philosopher]]. Some have suggested that [[Abraham]] introduced a philosophy learned from [[Melchizedek]];&lt;ref&gt;"The Melchizedek Tradition: A Critical Examination of the Sources to the Fifth Century ad and in the Epistle to the Hebrews", by Fred L. Horton, Jr., Pg. 54, Cambridge University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0-521-01871-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Jews ascribe the ''[[Sefer Yetzirah]]'' "Book of Creation" to Abraham.&lt;ref&gt;"Sefer Yetzirah", By Aryeh Kaplan, xii, Red Wheel, 1997, {{ISBN|0-87728-855-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[midrash]]&lt;ref&gt;Bereishit Rabba (39,1)&lt;/ref&gt; describes how Abraham understood this world to have a creator and director by comparing this world to "a house with a light in it", what is now called the [[Teleological argument|argument from design]].  [[Psalms]] contains invitations to admire the wisdom of God through his works; from this, some scholars suggest, Judaism harbors a Philosophical under-current.&lt;ref&gt;"Medieval Philosophy and the Classical Tradition: In Islam, Judaism and Christianity" by John Inglis, Page 3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ecclesiastes]] is often considered to be the only genuine philosophical work in the [[Hebrew Bible]]; its author seeks to understand the place of human beings in the world and life's meaning.&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction to Philosophy" by Dr Tom Kerns&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philo of Alexandria ===
[[File:PhiloThevet.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Philo]]]]
[[Philo]] attempted to fuse and harmonize Greek and Jewish philosophy through allegory, which he learned from Jewish exegesis and [[Stoicism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=281&amp;letter=P |title=Philo Judæus |publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philo attempted to make his philosophy the means of defending and justifying Jewish religious ''truths''. These ''truths'' he regarded as fixed and determinate, and philosophy was used as an aid to ''truth'', and a means of arriving at it. To this end Philo chose from philosophical tenets of Greeks, refusing those that did not harmonize with Judaism such as Aristotle's doctrine of the ''eternity and indestructibility of the world''.

Dr. [[Bernard Revel]], in dissertation on Karaite [[halakha]], points to writings of a 10th-century [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]], [[Jacob Qirqisani]], who quotes Philo, illustrating how Karaites made use of Philo's works in development of Karaite Judaism. Philo's works became important to Medieval Christian scholars who leveraged the work of Karaites to lend credence to their claims that "these are the beliefs of Jews" - a technically correct, yet deceptive, attribution.

== Jewish scholarship after destruction of Second Temple ==
With the Roman destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 CE, [[Second Temple Judaism]] was in disarray,&lt;ref&gt;"Christianity, Judaism and other Greco-Roman cults: studies for Morton Smith at sixty", Volume 12, Part 1, Pg 110, Volume 12 of Studies in Judaism in late antiquity, by Jacob Neusner ann  Morton Smith, Brill 1975, {{ISBN|90-04-04215-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Jewish traditions were preserved especially thanks to the shrewd maneuvers of [[Johanan ben Zakai]], who saved the [[Sanhedrin]] and moved it to [[Yavne]]. Philosophical speculation was not a central part of [[Rabbinic Judaism]], although some have seen the [[Mishnah]] as a philosophical work.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Neusner, ''Judaism as Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rabbi Akiva]] has also been viewed as a philosophical figure:&lt;ref&gt;"Beginnings in Jewish Philosophy", By Meyer Levin, Pg 49, Behrman House 1971, {{ISBN|0-87441-063-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; his statements include 1.) ''"How favored is man, for he was created after an image "for in an image, Elokim made man" ''(Gen. ix. 6)''"'', 2.) ''"Everything is foreseen; but freedom ''[of will]'' is given to every man"'', 3.) ''"The world is governed by mercy... but the divine decision is made by the preponderance of the good or bad in one's actions"''.

After the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]], Rabbinic scholars gathered in [[Tiberias]] and [[Safed]] to re-assemble and re-assess Judaism, its laws, theology, liturgy, beliefs and leadership structure. In 219 CE, the [[Sura Academy]] (from which [[Jewish Kalam]] emerged many centuries later) was founded by [[Abba Arika]]. For the next five centuries, Talmudic academies focused upon reconstituting Judaism and little, if any, philosophic investigation was pursued.

=== Who influences whom? ===
{{further|Early Islamic philosophy}}
Rabbinic Judaism had limited philosophical activity until it was challenged by [[Islam]], Karaite Judaism, and [[Christianity]]—with Tanach, Mishnah, and Talmud, there was no need for a philosophic framework.  From an economic viewpoint, [[Radhanite]] trade dominance was being usurped by coordinated Christian and Islamic forced-conversions, and torture, compelling Jewish scholars to understand nascent economic threats.  These investigations triggered new ideas and intellectual exchange among Jewish and Islamic scholars in the areas of jurisprudence, mathematics, astronomy, logic and philosophy.  Jewish scholars influenced Islamic scholars and Islamic scholars influenced Jewish scholars.  Contemporary scholars continue to debate who was Muslim and who was Jew—some "Islamic scholars" were "Jewish scholars" prior to forced conversion to Islam, some Jewish scholars willingly converted to Islam, such as [[Abdullah ibn Salam]], while others later reverted to Judaism, and still others, born and raised as Jews, were ambiguous in their religious beliefs such as [[ibn al-Rawandi]], although they lived according to the customs of their neighbors.

Around 700 CE, ʿAmr ibn ʿUbayd Abu ʿUthman al-Basri introduces two streams of thought that influence Jewish, Islamic and Christian scholars:
#[[Qadariyah]]
# [[Bahshamiyya]] [[Muʿtazila]]

The story of the Bahshamiyya Muʿtazila and Qadariyah is as important, if not more so, as the intellectual symbiosis of Judaism and Islam in Islamic Spain.

Around 733 CE, [[Mar]] Natronai ben Habibai moves to [[Kairouan]], then to Spain, transcribing the [[Talmud]] ''Bavli'' for the Academy at Kairouan from memory—later taking a copy with him to Spain.&lt;ref&gt;"Geonica", By Ginzberg Louis, Pg. 18, {{ISBN|1-110-35511-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Karaism ====
{{main|Karaite Judaism}}
Borrowing from the [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800–1400)|Mutakallamin]] of [[Basra]], the Karaites were the first Jewish group to subject Judaism to Muʿtazila. Rejecting the Talmud and Rabbinical tradition, Karaites took liberty to reinterpret the [[Tanakh]]. This meant abandoning foundational Jewish belief structures. Some scholars suggest that the major impetus for the formation of Karaism was a reaction to the rapid rise of Shi'i Islam, which recognized Judaism as a fellow monotheistic faith but claimed that it detracted from monotheism by deferring to Rabbinic authority. Karaites absorbed certain aspects of Jewish sects such as the followers of [[Abu Isa]] (Shi'ism), [[Maliki]] (Sunnis) and Yudghanites (Sufis), who were influenced by East-Islamic scholarship yet deferred to the [[Ash'ari]] when contemplating the sciences.

The spread of Islam throughout the Middle East and North Africa rendered Muslim all that was once Jewish.  Greek philosophy, science, medicine and mathematics was absorbed by Jewish scholars living in the Arab world due to Arabic translations of those texts; remnants of the [[Library of Alexandria]].  Early Jewish converts to Islam brought with them stories from their heritage, known as ''[[Isra'iliyyat]]'', which told of the ''Banu Isra'il'', the pious men of ancient Israel.  One of the most famous early mystics of [[Sufism]], [[Hasan of Basra]], introduced numerous ''Isra'iliyyat'' legends into Islamic scholarship, stories that went on to become representative of Islamic mystical ideas of piety of Sufism.

[[Hai Gaon]] of [[Pumbedita Academy]] begins a new phase in Jewish scholarship and investigation (''hakirah''); Hai Gaon augments Talmudic scholarship with non-Jewish studies.  Hai Gaon was a savant with an exact knowledge of the theological movements of his time so much so that [[Moses ibn Ezra]] called him a [[kalam|mutakallim]].  Hai was competent to argue with followers of Qadariyyah and Mutazilites, sometimes adopting their polemic methods.  Through correspondence with Talmudic Academies at Kairouan, Cordoba and Lucena, Hai Gaon passes along his discoveries to Talmudic scholars therein.

The teachings of the [[Brethren of Purity]] were carried to the West by a Spanish Arab of Madrid, Muhammad Abu'l-Qasim al-Majnti al-Andalusi, who died in AD 1004–1005. Thanks to [[Averroes]], Spain became a center of philosophical learning as is reflected by the explosion of philosophical inquiry among Jews, Muslims and Christians.&lt;ref&gt;"A literary History of Persia" Book IV, Chapter X.

== Jewish philosophy before Maimonides ==

=== "Hiwi the Heretic" ===
According to Sa'adya Gaon, the Jewish community of [[Balkh]] (Afghanistan) was divided into two groups: "Jews" and "people that are called Jews"; [[Hiwi al-Balkhi]] was a member of the latter.  Hiwi is generally considered to be the very first "Jewish" philosopher to subject the Pentateuch to critical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Fleischer, Ezra. "A Fragment from Hivi Al-Balkhi's Criticism of the Bible." Tarbiz 51, no. 1 (1981): 49-57.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hiwi is viewed by some scholars as an intellectually conflicted man torn between Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Gnostic Christianity, and Manichaean thought.&lt;ref&gt;"The Messiah in Isaiah 53: The Commentaries of Sa'adya Gaon, Salmon Ben Yeruham, and Yefet Ben Eli 52:13-53:12", Trade paperback (1998)   by Sa'adia, Joseph Alobaidi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, J. "Hiwi Al-Balkhi: A Comparative Study." Jewish Quarterly Review 38; 39 (1947-48; 1948-49): 317-42, 419-30; 79-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hiwi espoused the belief that miraculous acts, described in the Pentateuch, are simply examples of people using their skills of reasoning to undertake, and perform, seemingly miraculous acts.&lt;ref&gt;Gil, Moshe. Hivi Ha-Balkhi Ha-Kofer Me-Horasan, Ketavim. Merhaviah: Sifriyyat Po'alim, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;  As examples of this position, he argued that the parting of the Red Sea was a natural phenomenon, and that Moses' claim to greatness lay merely in his ability to calculate the right moment for the crossing.  He also emphasized that the Egyptian magicians were able to reproduce several of Moses' "miracles," proving that they could not have been so unique.  According to scholars, Hiwi's gravest mistake was having the Pentateuch redacted to reflect his own views - then had those redacted texts, which became popular,  distributed to children.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Israel, ed. Sa'adya's Polemic against Hiwi Al-Balkhi: A Fragment Edited from a Genizah Ms, Texts and Studies of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. New York: The Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1915.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since his views contradicted the views of both Rabbanite and Karaite scholars, Hiwi was declared a heretic.  In this context, however, we can also regard Hiwi, while flawed, as the very first critical biblical commentator; zealous rationalistic views of Hiwi parallel those of [[Ibn al-Rawandi]].

Saʿadya Gaon dedicated an entire treatise, written in rhyming Hebrew, to a refutation of Ḥīwī's arguments, two fragments of which, preserved in the Cairo Geniza, have been published (Davidson, 1915; Schirmann, 1965).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marzena Zawanowska|title=" Ḥīwī al-Balkhī."

Sa'adya Gaon denounced Hiwi as an extreme rationalist, a "Mulhidun", or atheist/deviator.  Abraham Ibn Daud described HIwi as a sectarian who "denied the Torah, yet used it to formulate a new Torah of his liking".&lt;ref&gt;Malter, Henry. Sa'adya Gaon: His Life and Works, Morris Loeb Series. Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sa'adya Gaon ===
[[Saadia Gaon]], son of a [[proselyte]], is considered the greatest early Jewish philosopher. During his early years in [[Tulunids|Tulunid]] Egypt, the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] ruled Egypt; the leaders of the [[Tulunids]] were Ismaili Imams.  Their influence upon the Jewish academies of Egypt resonate in the works of Sa'adya.  Sa'adya's ''[[Emunoth ve-Deoth]]'' ("Beliefs and Opinions") was originally called ''Kitab al-Amanat wal-l'tikadat'' ("Book of the Articles of Faith and Doctrines of Dogma"); it was the first systematic presentation and philosophic foundation of the dogmas of Judaism, completed at Sura Academy in 933 CE.

Little known is that Saadia traveled to [[Tiberias]] in 915CE to study with Abū 'l-Kathīr Yaḥyā ibn Zakariyyāʾ al-Katib al-Tabari (Tiberias), a Jewish theologian and Bible translator from Tiberias whose main claim to fame is the fact that Saadia Gaon studied with him at some point. He is not mentioned in any Jewish source, and apart from the Andalusian heresiographer and polemicist [[Ibn Hazm]], who mentions him as a Jewish mutakallim (rational theologian), our main source of information is the ''Kitāb al-Tanbīh'' by the Muslim historian [[Al-Masudi|al-Masʿūdī]] (d. 956). In his brief survey of Arabic translations of the Bible, al-Masʿūdī states that the Israelites rely for exegesis and translation of the Hebrew books—i.e., the Torah, Prophets, and Psalms, twenty-four books in all, he says—on a number of Israelites whom they praise highly, almost all of whom he has met in person. He mentions Abū ʾl-Kathīr as one of them, and also Saadia ("Saʿīd ibn Yaʿqūb al-Fayyūmī").  Regardless of what we do not know, Saadia traveled to Tiberias (home of the learned scribes and exegetes) to learn and he chose Abū 'l-Kathīr Yaḥyā ibn Zakariyyāʾ al-Katib al-Tabariya. The extent of Abū ʾl-Kathīr's influence on Saadia's thought cannot be established, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Camilla Adang]]|title=" Abū 'l-Kathīr Yaḥyā ibn Zakariyyāʾ." Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World. Executive Editor Norman A. Stillman|publisher=Brillonline.com|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopedia-of-jews-in-the-islamic-world/abu-l-kathir-yahya-ibn-zakariyya-COM_0000600|accessdate=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abū ʾl-Kathīr's profession is also unclear. al-Masʿūdī calls him a ''kātib'', which has been variously interpreted as secretary, government official, (biblical) scribe, Masorete, and book copyist. For lack of further information, some scholars have tried to identify Abū ʾl-Kathīr with the Hebrew grammarian Abū ʿAlī Judah ben ʿAllān, likewise of Tiberias, who seems to have been a Karaite Jew. However, al-Masūdī unequivocally describes Abu ʾl-Kathīr (as well as his student Saadia) as an ashmaʿthī (Rabbanite).

In "Book of the Articles of Faith and Doctrines of Dogma" Saadia declares the rationality of the Jewish religion with the caveat that reason must capitulate wherever it contradicts tradition. Dogma takes precedence over reason. Saadia closely followed the rules of the [[Kalam|Muʿtazila]] school of Abu Ali al-Jubba'i in composing his works.&lt;ref&gt;s.v. al-Djubba'i, {{Cite book | edition = New | publisher = E. J.

Montgomery Watt, Free will and predestination in early Islam, London 1948, 83-7, 136-7.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was Saadia who laid foundations for Jewish rationalist theology which built upon the work of the Muʿtazila, thereby shifting Rabbinic Judaism from mythical explanations of the Rabbis to reasoned explanations of the intellect.

=== David ibn Merwan al-Mukkamas ===

[[David ibn Merwan al-Mukkamas]] was author of the earliest known Jewish philosophical work of the [[Middle Ages]], a commentary on the ''[[Sefer Yetzirah]]''; he is regarded as the father of Jewish medieval philosophy. Sl-Mukkamas was first to introduce the ''methods'' of [[Kalam]] into Judaism and the first Jew to mention Aristotle in his writings.  He was a [[proselyte]] of [[Rabbinic Judaism]] (not [[Karaite Judaism]], as some argue); al-Mukkamas was a student of physician, and renowned Christian philosopher, Hana.  His close interaction with Hana, and his familial affiliation with Islam gave al-Mukkamas a unique view of religious belief and theology.

In 1898 [[Abraham Harkavy]] discovered, in Imperial Library of St. Petersburg, fifteen of the twenty chapters of David's philosophical work entitled ''Ishrun Maḳalat'' (Twenty Chapters) of which 15 survive.  One of the oldest surviving witnesses to early Kalām, it begins with epistemological investigations, turns to proofs of the creation of the world and the subsequent existence of a Creator, discusses the unity of the Creator (including the divine attributes), and concludes with theodicy (humanity and revelation) and a refutation of other religions (mostly lost).

In 915 CE, Sa'adya Gaon left for Palestine, where, according to al-Masʿūdī (Tanbīh, 113), he perfected his education at the feet of Abū 'l-Kathīr Yaḥyā ibn Zakariyyāʾ al-Katib al-Tabari (d. 320/932). The latter is also mentioned by Ibn Ḥazm in his K. al-Fiṣlal wa 'l-niḥal, iii, 171, as being, together with Dāwūd ibn Marwān al-Muqammiṣ and Sa'adya himself, one of the mutakallimūn of the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=" Saʿadyā Ben Yōsēf."

Since al-Muqammiṣ made few references to specifically Jewish issues and very little of his work was translated from Arabic into Hebrew, he was largely forgotten by  Jewish tradition. Nonetheless, he had a significant impact on subsequent Jewish philosophical followers of the Kalām, such as Saʿadya Gaon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Daniel J.

=== Samuel ibn Naghrillah ===
[[Samuel ibn Naghrillah]], born in [[Mérida, Spain]], lived in [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]] and was a child prodigy and student of Hanoch ben Moshe. Samuel ibn Naghrillah, [[Hasdai ibn Shaprut]], and Moshe ben Hanoch founded the Lucena Yeshiva that produced such brilliant scholars as [[Isaac ibn Ghiyyat]] and Maimon ben Yosef, the father of [[Maimonides]]. Ibn Naghrillah's son, Yosef, provided refuge for two sons of [[Hezekiah Gaon]]; Daud Ibn Chizkiya Gaon Ha-Nasi and Yitzhak Ibn Chizkiya Gaon Ha-Nasi.  Though not a philosopher, he did build the infrastructure to allow philosophers to thrive.  In 1070 the gaon Isaac ben Moses ibn Sakri of Denia, Spain traveled to the East and acted as ''rosh yeshivah'' of the Baghdad Academy.

[[Solomon ibn Gabirol]] was born in [[Málaga]] then moved to [[Valencia]].  Ibn Gabirol was one of the first teachers of [[Neoplatonism]] in Europe. His role has been compared to that of Philo. Ibn Gabirol occidentalized Greco-Arabic philosophy and restored it to Europe.  The philosophical teachings of Philo and ibn Gabirol were largely ignored by fellow Jews; the parallel may be extended by adding that Philo and ibn Gabirol both exercised considerable influence in secular circles; Philo upon early Christianity and Ibn Gabirol upon the scholars of medieval Christianity. Christian scholars, including [[Albertus Magnus]] and  [[Thomas Aquinas]], defer to him frequently.

[[Abraham bar Hiyya]], of [[Barcelona]] and later [[Arles]]-[[Provence]], was a student of his father [[Hiyya al-Daudi]] and one of the most important figures in the scientific movement which made the Jews of Provence, Spain and Italy the intermediaries between [[Averroism]], Muʿtazila and Christian Europe. He aided this scientific movement by original works, translations and as interpreter for another translator, [[Plato Tiburtinus]]. Bar-Hiyya's best student was [[v]].  His philosophical works are "Meditation of the Soul", an ethical work written from a rationalistic religious viewpoint, and an apologetic epistle addressed to [[Judah ben Barzillai]].

=== Hibat Allah ===
Originally known by his Hebrew name Nethanel Baruch ben Melech al-Balad,&lt;ref&gt;"Jews in Islamic countries in the Middle Ages Volume 28 of Études sur le judaïsme médiéval" by Moshe Gil and David Strassler, {{ISBN|90-04-13882-X}}, 9789004138827&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abu'l-Barakāt al-Baghdādī]], known as ''Hibat Allah'', was a Jewish philosopher and physicist and father-in-law of Maimonides who converted to Islam in his twilight years - once head of the Baghdad Yeshiva and considered the leading philosopher of Iraq.

Historians differ over the motive for his conversion to Islam. Some suggest it was a reaction to a social slight inflicted upon him because he was a Jew, while others suggest he was forcibly converted at the edge of a sword (which prompted Maimonides to comment upon [[Anusim]]). Despite his conversion to Islam, his works continued to be studied at the Jewish Baghdad Academy, a well-known academy, into the thirteenth century. He was a follower of Avicenna's teaching, who proposed an explanation of the acceleration of falling bodies by the accumulation of successive increments of power with successive increments of velocity.

His writings include ''Kitāb al-Muʿtabar'' ("The Book of What Has Been Established by Personal Reflection"); a philosophical commentary on the Kohelet, written in Arabic using Hebrew aleph bet; and the treatise "On the Reason Why the Stars Are Visible at Night and Hidden in Daytime." According to Hibat Allah, ''Kitāb al-Muʿtabar'' consists in the main of critical remarks jotted down by him over the years while reading philosophical text, and published at the insistence of his friends, in the form of a philosophical work.

[[Natan'el al-Fayyumi]]&lt;ref&gt;A history of Jewish philosophy in the Middle Ages By Colette Sirat&lt;/ref&gt; of Yemen, was the twelfth-century author of ''Bustan al-Uqul'' ("Garden of Intellects"), a Jewish version of [[Isma'ilism|Ismaili]] [[Shia Islam|Shi'i]] doctrines. Like the Ismailis, Natan'el al-Fayyumi argued that God sent different prophets to various nations of the world, containing legislations suited to the particular temperament of each individual nation.  Ismaili doctrine holds that a single universal religious truth lies at the root of the different religions. Some Jews accepted this model of religious pluralism, leading them to view [[Muhammad]] as a legitimate prophet, though not Jewish, sent to preach to the [[Arabs]], just as the Hebrew prophets had been sent to deliver their messages to Israel; others refused this notion in entirety. Natan'el's son Yaqub turned to Maimonides, asking urgently for counsel on how to deal with forced conversions to Islam and religious persecutions at the hand of [[Saladin]].  Maimonides' response was the ''[[Epistle to Yemen]]''.

[[Bahya ibn Paquda|Bahye ben Yosef Ibn Paquda]], of Zaragoza, was author of the first Jewish system of ethics ''Al Hidayah ila Faraid al-hulub'', ("Guide to the Duties of the Heart").  Bahya often followed the method of the Arabian encyclopedists known as "the [[Brethren of Purity]]" but adopts some of Sufi tenets rather than Ismaili.  According to Bahya, the Torah appeals to reason and knowledge as proofs of God's existence.  It is therefore a duty incumbent upon every one to make God an object of speculative reason and knowledge, in order to arrive at true faith.  Baḥya borrows from [[Sufism]] and [[Jewish Kalam]] integrating them into Neoplatonism.  Proof that Bahya borrowed from Sufism is underscored by the fact that the title of his eighth gate, ''Muḥasabat al-Nafs'' ("Self-Examination"), is reminiscent of the Sufi  ''Abu Abd Allah Ḥarith Ibn-Asad'', who has been surnamed ''El Muḥasib'' ("the self-examiner"), because—say his biographers—"he was always immersed in introspection"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=134&amp;letter=B&amp;search=Bahya#ixzz0Tx3CqjNq |title=Bahya Ben Joseph Ibn Paḳuda |publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Daud's philosophical work written in Arabic, ''Al-'akidah al-Rafiyah'' ("The Sublime Faith"), has been preserved in Hebrew by the title ''Emunah Ramah''.  Ibn Daud did not introduce a new philosophy, but he was the first to introduce a more thorough systematic form derived from [[Aristotle]].  Accordingly, [[Hasdai Crescas]] mentions Ibn Daud as the only Jewish philosopher among the predecessors of Maimonides.&lt;ref&gt;''Or Adonai'', ch. i.&lt;/ref&gt;  Overshadowed by Maimonides, ibn Daud's ''Emunah Ramah'', a work to which Maimonides was indebted, received little notice from later philosophers.  "True philosophy", according to Ibn Daud, "does not entice us from religion; it tends rather to strengthen and solidify it. Moreover, it is the duty of every thinking Jew to become acquainted with the harmony existing between the fundamental doctrines of Judaism and those of philosophy, and, wherever they seem to contradict one another, to seek a mode of reconciling them".

{{main|Maimonides}}
[[Maimonides#Philosophy|Maimonides]] wrote ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'' — his most influential philosophic work.  He was a student of his father, Rabbi Maimon ben Yosef (a student of [[Joseph ibn Migash]]) in Cordoba, Spain.  When his family fled Spain, for Fez, Maimonides enrolled in the Academy of Fez and studied under Rabbi Yehuda Ha-Kohen Ibn Soussan — a student of [[Isaac Alfasi]].  Maimonides strove to reconcile Aristotelian philosophy and science with the teachings of Torah.  In some ways his position was parallel to that of [[Averroes]]; in reaction to the attacks on Avicennian Aristotelism, Maimonides embraced and defended a stricter Aristotelism without Neoplatonic additions.  The principles which inspired all of Maimonides' philosophical activity was identical those of [[Abraham Ibn Daud]]: there can be no contradiction between the truths which God has revealed and the findings of the human intellect in science and philosophy. Maimonides departed from the teachings of Aristotle by suggesting that the world is not eternal, as Aristotle taught, but was created ''[[ex nihilo]]''.  In "Guide for the Perplexed" (1:17 &amp; 2:11)" Maimonides explains that Israel lost its [[Tradition|Mesorah]] in exile, and with it "we lost our science and philosophy — only to be rejuvenated in Al Andalus within the context of interaction and intellectual investigation of Jewish, Christian and Muslim texts.

== Medieval Jewish philosophy after Maimonides ==
Maimonides writings almost immediately came under attack from Karaites, Dominican Christians, Tosafists of Provence, [[Ashkenaz]] and [[Al Andalus]].  His genius was obvious, protests centered around his writings.  Scholars suggest that [[Maimonides]] instigated the [[Maimonidean Controversy]] when he verbally attacked ''Samuel ben Ali Ha-Levi al-Dastur'' ("Gaon of Baghdad") as "one whom people accustom from his youth to believe that there is none like him in his generation," and he sharply attack the "monetary demands" of the academies.  ''al-Dastur''was an anti-Maimonidean operating in Babylon to undermine the works of [[Maimonides]] and those of Maimonides' patrons (the Al-Constantini Family from North Africa).  To illustrate the reach of the Maimonidean Controversy, ''al-Dastur'', the chief opponent of Maimonides in the East, was excommunicated by ''Daud Ibn Hodaya al Daudi'' (Exilarch of Mosul).  Maimonides' attacks on Ibn al-Dastur may not have been entirely altruistic given the position of Maimonides' in-laws in competing Yeshivas.

In Western Europe, the controversy was halted by the burning of Maimonides' works by Christian Dominicans, in 1232. [[Avraham son of Rambam]], continued fighting for his father's beliefs in the East; desecration of Maimonides' tomb, at [[Tiberias]] by Jews, was a profound shock to Jews throughout the Diaspora and caused all to pause and reflect upon what was being done to the fabric of Jewish Culture.  This compelled many Anti-Maimonideans to recant their assertions and realize what cooperation with Christians meant to them, their texts and their communities.

Contemporary Kabbalists, Tosafists and Rationalists continue to engage in lively, sometimes caustic, debate in support of their positions and influence in the Jewish world.  At the center of many of these debates are 1) "Guide for the Perplexed", 2) "13 Principles of Faith", 3) "Mishnah Torah", and 4) his commentary on [[Anusim]].

}}[[Joseph ben Judah of Ceuta]] was the son of Rabbi Yehuda Ha-Kohen Ibn Soussan and a student of Maimonides for whom the ''Guide for the Perplexed'' is written.  Yosef traveled from [[Alexandria]] to [[Fustat]] to study logic, mathematics, and astronomy under Maimonides.  Philosophically, Yosef's dissertation, in Arabic, on the problem of "Creation" is suspected to have been written before contact with Maimonides. It is entitled ''Ma'amar bimehuyav ha-metsiut ve'eykhut sidur ha-devarim mimenu vehidush ha'olam'' ("A Treatise as to (1) Necessary Existence (2) The Procedure of Things from the Necessary Existence and (3) The Creation of the World").

=== Jacob Anatoli ===
[[Jacob Anatoli|Jacob ben Abba Mari ben Simson Anatoli]] is generally regarded as a pioneer in the application of the Maimonidean Rationalism to the study of Jewish texts.   He was the son-in-law of [[Samuel ibn Tibbon]], translator of Maimonides.  Due to these family ties Anatoli was introduced to the philosophy of Maimonides, the study of which was such a great revelation to him that he, in later days, referred to it as the beginning of his intelligent and true comprehension of the Scriptures, while he frequently alluded to Ibn Tibbon as one of the two masters who had instructed and inspired him.  Anatoli wrote the ''Malmad'' exhibiting his broad knowledge of classic Jewish exegetes, as well as Plato, Aristotle, Averroes, and the Vulgate, as well as with a large number of Christian institutions, some of which he ventures to criticize, such as celibacy and monastic castigation, as well as certain heretics and he repeatedly appeals to his readers for a broader cultivation of the classic languages and the non-Jewish branches of learning.  To Anatoli all men are, in truth, formed in the image of God, though the Jews stand under a particular obligation to further the true cognition of God simply by reason of their election—"the Greeks had chosen wisdom as their pursuit; the Romans, power; and the Jews, religiousness"

=== Hillel ben Samuel ===
Firstly, [[Hillel ben Samuel]]'s importance in the history of medieval Jewish philosophy lies in his attempt to deal, systematically, with the question of the immortality of the soul.  Secondly, Hillel played a major role in the controversies of 1289–90 concerning the philosophical works of Maimonides.  Thirdly, Hillel was the first devotee of Jewish learning and Philosophy in Italy, bringing a close to a period of relative ignorance of Hakira in Verona (Italy).  And finally, Hillel is one of the early Latin translators of "the wise men of the nations" (non-Jewish scholars).

Defending Maimonides, Hillel addressed a letter to his friend Maestro Gaio asking him to use his influence with the Jews of Rome against Maimonides' opponents (Solomon Petit).  He also advanced the bold idea of gathering together Maimonides' defenders and opponents in Alexandria, in order to bring the controversy before a court of Babylonian rabbis, whose decision would be binding on both factions.  Hillel was certain the verdict would favor Maimonides.

Hillel wrote a commentary on the 25 propositions appearing at the beginning of the second part of the Guide of the Perplexed, and three philosophical treatises, which were appended to Tagmulei ha-Nefesh: the first on knowledge and free will; the second on the question of why mortality resulted from the sin of Adam; the third on whether or not the belief in the fallen angels is a true belief.

[[Shem-Tov ibn Falaquera]] was a Spanish-born philosopher who pursued reconciliation between Jewish dogma and philosophy.  Scholars speculate he was a student of Rabbi [[David Kimhi]] whose family fled Spain to Narbonne.&lt;ref&gt;The encyclopædia britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences ..., Volume 13 edited by Hugh Chisholm, Pg 174&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Falaquera lived an ascetic live of solitude.&lt;ref&gt;A short biographical article about Rabeinu Shem Tov Ben Yosef Falaquera, one of the great Rishonim who was a defender of the Rambam, and the author of the Moreh HaMoreh on the Rambam's Moreh Nevuchim. Published in the Jewish Quarterly Review journal (Vol .1 1910/1911).&lt;/ref&gt;  Ibn Falaquera's two leading philosophic authorities were Averroes and Maimonides.  Ibn Falaquera defended the ''"Guide for the Perplexed"'' against attacks of anti-Maimonideans.&lt;ref&gt;Torah and Sophia: The Life and Thought of Shem Tov Ibn Falaquera (Monographs of the Hebrew Union College) by Raphael Jospe&lt;/ref&gt;  He knew the works of the Islamic philosophers better than any Jewish scholar of his time, and made many of them available to other Jewish scholars – often without attribution (''Reshit Hokhmah'').  Ibn Falaquera did not hesitate to modify Islamic philosophic texts when it suited his purposes. For example, Ibn Falaquera turned Alfarabi's account of the origin of philosophic religion into a discussion of the origin of the "virtuous city".  Ibn Falaquera's other works include, but are not limited to Iggeret Hanhagat ha-Guf we ha-Nefesh, a treatise in verse on the control of the body and the soul.

* ''Iggeret ha-Wikkuaḥ'', a dialogue between a religious Jew and a Jewish philosopher on the harmony of philosophy and religion.
* ''Reshit Ḥokmah'', treating of moral duties, of the sciences, and of the necessity of studying philosophy.
* ''Sefer ha-Ma'alot'', on different degrees of human perfection.
* ''Moreh ha-Moreh'', commentary on the philosophical part of Maimonides' "Guide for the Perplexed".

=== Joseph ben Abba Mari ibn Kaspi ===
[[Joseph Caspi|Ibn Kaspi]] was a fierce advocate of Maimonides to such an extent that he left for Egypt in 1314 in order to hear explanations on the latter's Guide of the Perplexed from Maimonides' grandchildren.  When he heard that the Guide of the Perplexed was being studied in the Muslim philosophical schools of Fez, he left for that town (in 1332) in order to observe their method of study.

Ibn Kaspi began writing when he was 17 years old on topics which included logic, linguistics, ethics, theology, biblical exegesis, and super-commentaries to Abraham Ibn Ezra and Maimonides.  Philosophic system he followed Aristotle and Averroes.  He defines his aim as "not to be a fool who believes in everything, but only in that which can be verified by proof...and not to be of the second unthinking category which disbelieves from the start of its inquiry," since "certain things must be accepted by tradition, because they cannot be proven."  Scholars continue to debate whether ibn Kaspi was a heretic or one of Judaisms most illustrious scholars.

Rabbi [[Gersonides|Levi ben Gershon]] was a student of his father [[Gerson ben Solomon of Arles]], who in turn was a student of [[Shem-Tov ibn Falaquera]].  Gersonides is best known for his work ''Milhamot HaShem'' ("Wars of the Lord").  ''Milhamot HaShem'' is modelled after the "[[Guide for the Perplexed]]".  Gersonides and his father were avid students of the works of [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]], Aristotle, [[Empedocles]], [[Galen]], [[Hippocrates]], [[Homer]], Plato, [[Ptolemy]], [[Pythagoras]], [[Themistius]], [[Theophrastus]], [[Ali ibn Abbas al-Magusi]], [[Ali ibn Ridwan]], Averroes, [[Avicenna]], [[Qusta ibn Luqa]], [[Al-Farabi]], Al-Fergani, Chonain, Isaac Israeli, [[Ibn Tufail]], [[Ibn Zuhr]], Isaac Alfasi, and Maimonides.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Gersonides held that God does not have complete foreknowledge of human acts.  "Gersonides, bothered by the old question of how God's foreknowledge is compatible with [[human freedom]], suggests that what God knows beforehand is all the choices open to each individual. God does not know, however, which choice the individual, in his freedom, will make."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Jacobs |first=Louis |year=1990 |title= God, Torah, Israel: traditionalism without fundamentalism |location=Cincinnati |publisher=Hebrew Union College Press |isbn= 0-87820-052-5 |oclc= 21039224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His best-known work is his ''Shelemut ha-Nefesh'' ("Treatise on the Perfection of the Soul").  Moses began studying philosophy with his father when he was thirteen later studying with Moses ben David Caslari and [[Abraham ben David Caslari]] - both of whom were students of [[Kalonymus ben Kalonymus]].  Moses believed that Judaism was a guide to the highest degree of theoretical and moral truth. He believed that the Torah had both a simple, direct meaning accessible to the average reader as well as a deeper, metaphysical meaning accessible to thinkers. Moses rejected the belief in miracles, instead believing they could be explained, and defended man's free will by philosophical arguments.

[[Isaac ben Sheshet]] Perfet, of Barcelona, studied under [[Hasdai Crescas]] and Rabbi [[Nissim ben Reuben]] Gerondi.  [[Nissim ben Reuben]] Gerondi, was a steadfast Rationalist who did not hesitate to refute leading authorities, such as [[Rashi]], [[Rabbeinu Tam]], [[Moses ben Nahman]], and [[Solomon ben Adret]].  The pogroms of 1391, against Jews of Spain, forced Isaac to flee to Algiers - where he lived out his life.   Isaac's responsa evidence a profound knowledge of the philosophical writings of his time; in one of Responsa No. 118 he explains the difference between the opinion of ''Gersonides'' and that of ''Abraham ben David of Posquières'' on free will, and gives his own views on the subject. He was an adversary of Kabbalah who never spoke of the Sefirot; he quotes another philosopher when reproaching kabbalists with "''believing in the "Ten" (Sefirot) as the Christians believe in the Trinity''".&lt;ref&gt;Responsa No. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hasdai Crescas]], of Barcelona, was a leading rationalist on issues of natural law and free-will. His views  can be seen as precursors to [[Baruch Spinoza]].  His work, ''[[Or Adonai]]'', became a classic refutation of medieval Aristotelism, and harbinger of the scientific revolution in the 16th century.  Hasdai Crescas was a student of [[Nissim ben Reuben]] Gerondi, who in turn was a student of Reuben ben Nissim Gerondi.  Crescas was not a Rabbi, yet he was active as a teacher.  Among his fellow students and friends, his best friend was [[Isaac ben Sheshet]] Perfet.  Cresca's students won accolades as participants in the [[Disputation of Tortosa]].

=== Simeon ben Zemah Duran ===
Influenced by the teaching of Rabbi [[Nissim of Gerona]], via Ephraim Vidal's Yeshiva in Majorca, Duran's commentary ''Magen Avot'' ("The Shield of the Fathers"), which influenced [[Joseph Albo]], is important.  He was also a student of philosophy, astronomy, mathematics, and especially of medicine, which he practiced for a number of years at Palma, in Majorca.  ''Magen Avot'' deals with concepts such as the nature of God, the eternity of the Torah, the coming of the Messiah, and the Resurrection of the dead.  Duran believed that Judaism has three dogmas only: the existence of God, the Torah's Divine origin, and Reward and Punishment; in this regard he was followed by Joseph Albo.

}}[[Joseph Albo]], of Monreal, was a student of [[Hasdai Crescas]].  He wrote ''Sefer ha-Ikkarim'' ("Book of Principles"), a classic work on the fundamentals of Judaism.  Albo narrows the fundamental Jewish principles of faith from thirteen to three -
::::::* belief in the existence of God,
::::::* belief in revelation, and
::::::* belief in divine justice, as related to the idea of immortality.
Albo rejects the assumption that [[creation ex nihilo]] is essential in belief in God.  Albo freely criticizes Maimonides' thirteen principles of belief and Crescas' six principles.  According to Albo, "belief in the Messiah is only a 'twig' unnecessary to the soundness of the trunk"; not essential to Judaism.  Nor is it true, according to Albo, that every law is binding.  Though every ordinance has the power of conferring happiness in its observance, it is not true that every law must be observed, or that through the neglect of a part of the law, a Jew would violate the divine covenant or be damned.  Contemporary Orthodox Jews, however, vehemently disagree with Albo's position believing that all Jews are divinely obligated to fulfill every applicable commandment.

[[Hoter ben Shlomo]] was a scholar and philosopher in Yemen heavily influenced by Nethanel ben al-Fayyumi, Maimonides, Saadia Gaon and al-Ghazali.  The connection between the "Epistle of the [[Brethren of Purity]]" and Ismailism suggests the adoption of this work as one of the main sources of what would become known as "Jewish Ismailism" as found in Late Medieval Yemenite Judaism.  "Jewish Ismailism" consisted of adapting, to Judaism, a few Ismaili doctrines about cosmology, prophecy, and hermeneutics.  There are many examples of the [[Brethren of Purity]] influencing [[Yemenite Jew]]ish philosophers and authors in the period 1150–1550.&lt;ref&gt;D. Blumenthal, "An  Illustration of the Concept 'Philosophic Mysticism' from Fifteenth Century Yemen," and "A Philosophical-Mystical Interpretation of a Shi'ur Qomah Text."&lt;/ref&gt;  Some traces of Brethren of Purity doctrines, as well as of their [[numerology]], are found in two Yemenite philosophical [[midrashim]] written in 1420–1430: ''Midrash ha-hefez'' ("The Glad Learning") by Zerahyah ha-Rofé (a/k/a Yahya al-Tabib) and the ''Siraj al-'uqul'' ("Lamp of Intellects") by Hoter ben Solomon.

[[Isaac Abravanel]], statesman, philosopher, Bible commentator, and financier who commented on Maimonides' thirteen principles in his ''Rosh Amanah''.  [[Isaac Abravanel]] was steeped in Rationalism by the Ibn Yahya family, who had a residence immediately adjacent to the ''Great Synagogue of Lisbon'' (also built by the Ibn Yahya Family). His most important work, ''Rosh Amanah'' ("The Pinnacle of Faith"), defends Maimonides' thirteen articles of belief against attacks of Hasdai Crescas and Yosef Albo.  ''Rosh Amanah'' ends with the statement that "Maimonides compiled these articles merely in accordance with the fashion of other nations, which set up axioms or fundamental principles for their science".

Isaac's grandfather, Samuel Abravanel, was forcibly converted to Christianity during the pogroms of 1391 and took the Spanish name "''Juan Sanchez de Sevilla''".  Samuel fled Castile-León, Spain, in 1397 for Lisbon, Portugal, and reverted to Judaism - shedding his ''[[Converso]]'' after living among Christians for six years.   Conversions outside Judaism, coerced or otherwise, had a strong impact upon young Isaac, later compelling him to forfeit his immense wealth in an attempt to redeem Iberian Jewry from coercion of the [[Alhambra Decree]].  There are parallels between what he writes, and documents produced by Inquisitors, that present [[conversos]] as ambivalent to Christianity and sometimes even ironic in their expressions regarding their new religion - [[crypto-jews]].

=== Leone Ebreo ===
[[Judah Leon Abravanel]] was Portuguese physician, poet and philosopher. His work ''Dialoghi d'amore'' ("Dialogues of Love"), written in Italian, was one of the most important philosophical works of his time. In an attempt to circumvent a plot, hatched by local Catholic Bishops to kidnap his son, Judah sent his son from Castile, to Portugal with a nurse, but by order of the king, the son was seized and baptized.  This was a devastating insult to Judah and his family, and was a source of bitterness throughout Judah's life and the topic of his writings years later; especially since this was not the first time the Abravanel Family was subjected to such embarrassment at the hands of the Catholic Church.

Judah's ''Dialoghi'' is regarded as the finest of Humanistic Period works.  His neoplatonism is derived from the Hispanic Jewish community, especially the works of [[Ibn Gabirol]].  Platonic notions of reaching towards a nearly impossible ideal of beauty, wisdom, and perfection encompass the whole of his work.  In ''Dialoghi d'amore'', Judah defines love in philosophical terms.  He structures his three dialogues as a conversation between two abstract "characters": Philo, representing love or appetite, and Sophia, representing science or wisdom, Philo+Sophia (philosophia).

=== Criticisms of Kabbalah ===
The word "Kabbalah" was used in medieval Jewish texts to mean "tradition", see [[Abraham Ibn Daud]]'s ''Sefer Ha-Qabbalah'' also known as the "Book of our Tradition".  "Book of our Tradition" does not refer to mysticism of any kind - it chronicles "our tradition of scholarship and study" in two Babylonian Academies, through the Geonim, into Talmudic Yeshivas of Spain.  In Talmudic times there was a mystic tradition in Judaism, known as ''Maaseh Bereshith'' (the work of creation) and ''Maaseh Merkavah'' (the work of the chariot); Maimonides interprets these texts as referring to Aristotelian physics and metaphysics as interpreted in the light of Torah.

In the 13th century, however, a mystical-esoteric system emerged which became known as "the [[Kabbalah]]."  Many of the beliefs associated with Kabbalah had long been rejected by philosophers.  [[Saadia Gaon]] had taught in his book ''Emunot v'Deot'' that Jews who believe in [[gilgul]] have adopted a non-Jewish belief.  [[Maimonides]] rejected many texts of ''[[Heichalot]]'', particularly ''[[Shi'ur Qomah]]'' whose anthropomorphic vision of God he considered heretical.

In the 13th century, *Meir ben Simon of Narbonne wrote an epistle (included in ''Milhhemet Mitzvah'') against early Kabbalists, singled out ''[[Sefer Bahir]]'', rejecting the attribution of its authorship to the tanna R. Nehhunya ben ha-Kanah and describing some of its content as follow -

::''"... And we have heard that a book had already been written for them, which they call  Bahir, that is 'bright' but no light shines through it. This book has come into our hands and we have found that they falsely attribute it to Rabbi Nehunya ben Haqqanah. haShem forbid! There is no truth in this... The language of the book and its whole content show that it is the work of someone who lacked command of either literary language or good style, and in many passages it contains words which are out and out heresy."''

}}[[Elia del Medigo]] was a descendant of ''[[Judah ben Eliezer ha-Levi Minz]]'' and ''[[Moses ben Isaac ha-Levi Minz]]''.  Eli'ezer del Medigo, of Rome, received the surname "Del Medigo" after studying Medicine.  The name was later changed from ''Del Medigo'' to ''Ha-rofeh''. He was the father and teacher of a long line of rationalist philosophers and scholars.  Non-Jewish students of Delmedigo classified him as an "Averroist", however, he saw himself as a follower of Maimonides. Scholastic association of Maimonides and Ibn Rushd would have been a natural one; Maimonides, towards the end of his life, was impressed with the Ibn Rushd commentaries and recommended them to his students. The followers of Maimonides (Maimonideans) had therefore been, for several generations before Delmedigo, the leading users, translators and disseminators of the works of Ibn Rushd in Jewish circles, and advocates for Ibn Rushd even after Islamic rejection of his radical views.  Maimonideans regarded Maimonides and Ibn Rushd as following the same general line.  In his book, Delmedigo portrays himself as defender of Maimonidean Judaism, and — like many Maimonideans — he emphasized the rationality of Jewish tradition.

With expulsion from Spain came the dissemination of Jewish philosophical investigation throughout the Mediterranean Basin, Northern Europe and the Western Hemisphere. The center-of-mass of Rationalism shifted to France, Italy, Germany, Crete, Sicily and Netherlands.  Expulsion from Spain and the coordinated pogroms of Europe resulted in the cross-pollination of variations on Rationalism incubated within diverse communities.  This period is also marked by the intellectual exchange among leaders of the Christian Reformation and Jewish scholars.  Of particular note is the line of Rationalists who migrated out of Germany, and present-day Italy into Crete, and other areas of the [[Ottoman Empire]] seeking safety and protection from the endless pogroms fomented by the [[House of Habsburg]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] against Jews.

Rationalism was incubating in places far from Spain. From stories told by Rabbi [[Elijah Ba'al Shem of Chelm]], German-speaking Jews, descendants of Jews who migrated back to Jerusalem after Charlemagne's invitation was revoked in Germany many centuries earlier, who lived in Jerusalem during the 11th century, were influenced by prevailing [[Mutazilite]] scholars of Jerusalem. A German-speaking Palestinian Jew saved the life of a young German man surnamed "Dolberger". When the knights of the [[First Crusade]] came to besiege Jerusalem, one of Dolberger's family members rescued German-speaking Jews in Palestine and brought them back to the safety of Worms, Germany, to repay the favor.&lt;ref&gt;"Seder ha-Dorot", p. 252, 1878 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Further evidence of German communities in the holy city comes in the form of halakic questions sent from Germany to Jerusalem during the second half of the eleventh century.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, in "Monatsschrift", xlvii. 344; Jerusalem: Under the Arabs&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the foregoing resulted in an explosion of new ideas and philosophic paths.

=== Baruch Spinoza ===
[[File:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|120px|left|[[Baruch Spinoza]]]]
[[Baruch Spinoza]] founded [[Spinozism]], broke with [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbinic Jewish]] tradition, and was placed in ''[[Herem (censure)|herem]]'' by the [[Beit Din]] of [[Amsterdam]]. The influence in his work from [[Maimonides]] and [[Leone Ebreo]] is evident. [[Elia del Medigo]] claims to be a student of the works of Spinoza. Some contemporary critics (e.g., Wachter, ''Der Spinozismus im Judenthum'') claimed to detect the influence of the [[Kabbalah]], while others (e.g., [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]) regarded Spinozism as a revival of [[Averroism]] – a talmudist manner of referencing to Maimonidean Rationalism. In the centuries that have lapsed since the ''herem'' declaration, scholars{{Who|date=March 2014}} have re-examined the works of Spinoza and find them to reflect a body of work and thinking that is not unlike some contemporary streams of Judaism. For instance, while Spinoza was accused of [[pantheism]], scholars{{Who|date=March 2014}} have come to view his work as advocating [[panentheism]], a valid contemporary view easily accommodated by contemporary Judaism.

=== Tzvi Hirsch ben Yaakov Ashkenazi ===
Rabbi [[Tzvi Ashkenazi|Tzvi Hirsch ben Yaakov Ashkenazi]] was a student of his father, but most notably also a student of his grandfather Rabbi [[Elijah Ba'al Shem of Chelm]].

Rabbi [[Jacob Emden]] was a student of his father Rabbi [[Tzvi Ashkenazi|Tzvi Hirsch ben Yaakov Ashkenazi]] a Rabbi in Amsterdam. Emden, a steadfast Talmudist, was a prominent opponent of the [[Sabbateans]] (Messianic Kabbalists who followed Sabbatai Tzvi).  Though anti-Maimonidean, Emden should be noted for his critical examination of the Zohar concluding that large parts of it were forged.

A new era began in the 18th century with the thought of [[Moses Mendelssohn]].  Mendelssohn has been described as the "'third Moses,' with whom begins a new era in Judaism," just as new eras began with [[Moses|Moses the prophet]] and with [[Moses Maimonides]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=446&amp;letter=M |title=Mendelssohn |publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mendelssohn was a [[German Jew]]ish philosopher to whose ideas the renaissance of European Jews, [[Haskalah]] (the Jewish Enlightenment) is indebted. He has been referred to as the father of Reform Judaism, though Reform spokesmen have been "resistant to claim him as their spiritual father".&lt;ref&gt;Wein (1997), p. 44. ([https://books.google.com/books?id=11f9xBbOBBEC&amp;pg=PA44 Google books])&lt;/ref&gt; Mendelssohn came to be regarded as a leading cultural figure of his time by both [[German people|Germans]] and Jews.  His most significant book was ''[[Jerusalem (Mendelssohn)|Jerusalem oder über religiöse Macht und Judentum]]'' (''Jerusalem''), first published in 1783.

Alongside Mendelssohn, other important Jewish philosophers of the eighteenth century included:
* [[Menachem Mendel Lefin]], anti-Hasidic [[Haskalah]] philosopher
* [[Salomon Maimon]], Enlightenment philosopher
* [[Isaac Satanow]], a [[Haskalah]] philosopher
* [[Naphtali Ullman]], [[Haskalah]] philosopher&lt;ref&gt;Shmuel Feiner, ''The Jewish Enlightenment'' 72-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Important Jewish philosophers of the nineteenth century included:
* [[Elijah Benamozegh]], a [[Sephardic]] rabbi and philosopher
* [[Hermann Cohen]], a [[neo-Kantian]] Jewish philosopher
* [[Moses Hess]], a secular Jewish philosopher and one of the founders of [[socialism]]
* [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]], leader of the [[Torah im Derech Eretz]] school of 19th century neo-Orthodoxy
* [[Samuel Hirsch]], a leader of [[Reform Judaism]]
* [[Nachman Krochmal]], [[Haskalah]] philosopher in [[Galicia (eastern Europe)|Galicia]]
* [[Samuel David Luzzatto]] a [[Sephardic]] rabbi and philosopher
* [[Karl Marx]], German [[economist]] and Jewish philosopher.

=== Traditionalist attitudes towards philosophy ===
{{main|Haredi Judaism|Hasidic philosophy}}
[[Haredi]] traditionalists who emerged in reaction to the [[Haskalah]] considered the fusion of religion and philosophy as difficult because classical philosophers start with no preconditions for which conclusions they must reach in their investigation, while classical religious believers have a set of religious principles of faith that they hold one must believe.  Most Haredim contended that one cannot simultaneously be a philosopher and a true adherent of a revealed religion.  In this view, all attempts at synthesis ultimately fail.  Rabbi [[Nachman of Breslov]], for example, viewed all philosophy as untrue and heretical.  In this he represents one strand of [[Hasidic]] thought, with creative emphasis on the emotions.

Other exponents of [[Hasidic philosophy|Hasidism]] had a more positive attitude towards philosophy.  In the [[Chabad]] writings of [[Schneur Zalman of Liadi]], Hasidut is seen as able to unite all parts of Torah thought, from the schools of philosophy to mysticism, by uncovering the illuminating Divine essence that permeates and transcends all approaches.  Interpreting the verse from [[Book of Job|Job]], "from my flesh I see [[HaShem]]", Shneur Zalman explained the inner meaning, or "soul", of the Jewish mystical tradition in intellectual form, by means of analogies drawn from the human realm.  As explained and continued by the later leaders of Chabad, this enabled the human mind to grasp concepts of Godliness, and so enable the heart to feel the love and awe of God, emphasised by all the founders of hasidism, in an internal way.  This development, the culminating level of the Jewish mystical tradition, in this way bridges philosophy and mysticism, by expressing the transcendent in human terms.

== 20th and 21st-century Jewish philosophy ==
[[File:Martin Buber portrait.jpg|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]]]

=== Jewish existentialism ===
{{main|Jewish existentialism}}
One of the major trends in modern Jewish philosophy was the attempt to develop a theory of Judaism through [[existentialism]].  Among the early Jewish existentialist philosophers was [[Lev Shestov]] (Jehuda Leib Schwarzmann), a Russian-Jewish philosopher.  One of the most influential Jewish existentialists in the first half of the 20th century was [[Franz Rosenzweig]].  While researching his doctoral dissertation on the 19th-century German philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], Rosenzweig reacted against Hegel's idealism and developed an existential approach.  Rosenzweig, for a time, considered conversion to Christianity, but in 1913, he turned to Jewish philosophy. He became a philosopher and student of [[Hermann Cohen]].  Rozensweig's major work, ''Star of Redemption'', is his new philosophy in which he portrays the relationships between haShem, humanity and world as they are connected by creation, revelation and redemption. Orthodox rabbi [[Joseph Soloveitchik]]{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} and Conservative rabbis [[Neil Gillman]]{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} and [[Elliot N. Dorff]]{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} have also been described as existentialists.

The [[France|French]] philosopher and [[Talmudic]] commentator [[Emmanuel Levinas]], whose approach grew out of the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] tradition in philosophy, has also been described as a Jewish existentialist.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin A. Wurgaft, [http://www.myjewishlearning.com/beliefs/Theology/Thinkers_and_Thought/Jewish_Philosophy/Philosophies/Modern/Emmanuel_Levinas.shtml Emmanuel Levinas], myjewishlearning.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jewish rationalism ===
[[File:Hermann Cohen (lithograph by Karl Doerbecker).jpg|thumb|left|[[Hermann Cohen]]]]

Rationalism has re-emerged as a popular perspective among Jews.&lt;ref&gt;"Jewish Rationalism Reemergent," ''Conservative Judaism,'' Volume 36, Issue 4, Page 81&lt;/ref&gt;  Contemporary Jewish rationalism often draws on ideas associated with medieval philosophers such as [[Maimonides]] and modern Jewish rationalists such as [[Hermann Cohen]].

Cohen was a German Jewish neo-Kantian philosopher who turned to Jewish subjects at the end of his career in the early 20th century, picking up on ideas of [[Maimonides]].  In America, [[Steven Schwarzschild]] continued Cohen's legacy.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Schwarzschild, "To Re-Cast Rationalism," ''Judaism'' 2 (1962).&lt;/ref&gt;  Another prominent contemporary Jewish rationalist is [[Lenn Goodman]], who works out of the traditions of medieval Jewish rationalist philosophy.  [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] rabbis [[Alan Mittleman]] of the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jtsa.edu/x12578.xml |title=The Jewish Theological Seminary |publisher=Jtsa.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313185226/http://www.jtsa.edu/x12578.xml |archivedate=2013-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Elliot N.

Some Orthodox rationalists in Israel take a "restorationist"{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} approach, reaching back in time for tools to simplify Rabbinic Judaism and bring all Jews, regardless of status or stream of Judaism, closer to observance of Halacha, Mitzvot, Kashrut and embrace of [[Maimonides]]' "13 Principles of Faith".  [[Dor Daim]], and [[Dor Daim#Talmide ha-Rambam|Rambamists]] are two groups who reject mysticism as a "superstitious innovation" to an otherwise clear and succinct set of Laws and rules.  According to these rationalists, there is shame and disgrace attached to failure to investigate matters of religious principle using the fullest powers of human reason and intellect.  One cannot be considered wise, or perceptive, if one does not attempt to understand the origins, and establish the correctness, of one's beliefs.

=== Holocaust theology ===
{{main|Holocaust theology}}
Judaism has traditionally taught that God is [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]], [[Omniscience|omniscient]] and [[omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]]. Yet, these claims are in jarring contrast with the fact that there is much [[evil]] in the world. Perhaps the most difficult question that monotheists have confronted is "how can one reconcile the existence of this view of God with the existence of evil?" or "how can there be good without bad?"  "how can there be a God without a devil?" This is [[the problem of evil]].  Within all monotheistic faiths many answers ([[theodicy|theodicies]]) have been proposed.  However, in light of the magnitude of evil seen in the [[Holocaust]], many people have re-examined classical views on this subject. How can people still have any kind of faith after the Holocaust?  This set of Jewish philosophies is discussed in the article on [[Holocaust theology]].

=== Reconstructionist theology ===
{{main|Reconstructionist Judaism}}
Perhaps the most controversial form of Jewish philosophy that developed in the early 20th century was the religious naturalism of Rabbi [[Mordecai Kaplan]].  His theology was a variant of [[John Dewey]]'s [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] philosophy.  Dewey's naturalism combined atheist beliefs with religious terminology in order to construct a philosophy for those who had lost faith in traditional Judaism.  In agreement with the classical medieval Jewish thinkers, Kaplan affirmed that haShem is not personal, and that all anthropomorphic descriptions of haShem are, at best, imperfect metaphors.  Kaplan's theology went beyond this to claim that haShem is the sum of all natural processes that allow man to become self-fulfilled.  Kaplan wrote that "to believe in haShem means to take for granted that it is man's destiny to rise above the brute and to eliminate all forms of violence and exploitation from human society."

=== Process theology ===
A recent trend has been to reframe Jewish theology through the lens of [[process philosophy]], more specifically [[process theology]]. Process philosophy suggests that fundamental elements of the universe are occasions of experience.  According to this notion, what people commonly think of as concrete objects are actually successions of these occasions of experience. Occasions of experience can be collected into groupings; something complex such as a human being is thus a grouping of many smaller occasions of experience. In this view, everything in the universe is characterized by experience (not to be confused with consciousness); there is no mind-body duality under this system, because "mind" is simply seen as a very developed kind of experiencing entity.

Intrinsic to this worldview is the notion that all experiences are influenced by prior experiences, and will influence all future experiences.  This process of influencing is never deterministic; an occasion of experience consists of a process of comprehending other experiences, and then reacting to it.  This is the "process" in "process philosophy". Process philosophy gives God a special place in the universe of occasions of experience. God encompasses all the other occasions of experience but also transcends them; thus process philosophy is a form of [[panentheism]].

The original ideas of process theology were developed by [[Charles Hartshorne]] (1897–2000), and influenced a number of [[Judaism|Jewish]] theologians, including [[United Kingdom|British]] philosopher Samuel Alexander (1859–1938), and [[Rabbis]] [[Max Kadushin]], Milton Steinberg and Levi A. Olan, Harry Slominsky, and [[Bradley Shavit Artson]].  [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]] has also been linked to this tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Donald J.|title=The Human and the Holy: The Spirituality of Abraham Joshua Heschel|year=1989|publisher=Fordham University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0823212361|pages=82–83|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LdfdS5YwOHoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kabbalah and philosophy ===
Kabbalah continued to be central to [[Haredi Orthodox Judaism]], which generally rejected philosophy, although the [[Chabad]] strain of [[Chasidism]] showed a more positive attitude towards philosophy. Meanwhile, non-Orthodox Jewish thought in the latter 20th century saw resurgent interest in [[Kabbalah]]. In academic studies, [[Gershom Scholem]] began the critical investigation of Jewish mysticism, while in non-Orthodox [[Jewish denominations]], [[Jewish Renewal]] and [[Neo-Hasidism]], spiritualised worship. Many philosophers do not consider this a form of philosophy, as Kabbalah is a collection of esoteric methods of textual interpretation. Mysticism is generally understood as an alternative to philosophy, not a variant of philosophy.

Among modern the modern critics of Kabbalah was [[Yihhyah Qafahh]], who wrote a book entitled ''[[Milhamoth ha-Shem]]'', (''Wars of the Name'') against what he perceived as the false teachings of the Zohar and the false Kabbalah of Isaac Luria. He is credited with spearheading the [[Dor Daim]]. [[Yeshayahu Leibowitz]] publicly shared the views expressed in Rabbi [[Yihhyah Qafahh]]'s book ''Milhhamoth ha-Shem'' and elaborated upon these views in his many writings.

==== Jewish philosophers whose philosophy is not necessarily focused on Jewish themes ====
In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries there have also been many philosophers who are Jewish or of Jewish descent, and whose Jewish background might influence their approach to some degree, but whose writing is not necessarily focused on issues specific to Judaism.  These include:
* [[Theodor W. Adorno]]
* [[Joseph Agassi]], an Israeli philosopher of science who developed [[Karl Popper]]'s ideas&lt;ref&gt;As early as 1934 [[Karl Popper]] wrote of the search for truth as "one of the strongest motives for scientific discovery." Still, he describes in ''Objective Knowledge'' (1972) early concerns about the much-criticized notion of truth as correspondence. Then came the semantic theory of truth formulated by the logician Alfred Tarski and published in 1933. Popper writes of learning in 1935 of the consequences of Tarski's theory, to his intense joy. The theory met critical objections to truth as correspondence and thereby rehabilitated it. The theory also seemed, in Popper's eyes, to support metaphysical realism and the regulative idea of a search for truth. Popper coined the term critical rationalism to describe his philosophy. Contemporary Jewish philosophers who follow Popper's philosophy include [[Joseph Agassi]], [[Adi Ophir]] and [[Yehuda Elkana]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lieb-Robinson bound''' is a theoretical upper limit on the [[speed]] at which [[information]] can propagate in non-[[Special relativity|relativistic]] [[Quantum mechanics|quantum]] systems. It demonstrates that information cannot travel instantaneously in quantum theory, even when the [[Theory of relativity|relativity]] limits of the [[speed of light]] are ignored. The existence of such a finite speed was discovered mathematically by [[:de:Elliott Lieb|Elliott Lieb]] and [[:de:Derek W. Robinson|Derek William Robinson]] in 1972.&lt;ref name="LR72"&gt;E. Lieb, D. Robinson, The finite group velocity of quantum spin systems, Commun. Math. Phys. 28, 251–257, (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; It turns the locality properties of physical systems into the existence of, and upper bound for this speed. The bound is now known as the Lieb-Robinson bound and the speed is known as the Lieb-Robinson velocity. This velocity is always finite but not universal, depending on the details of the system under consideration. For finite-range, e.g. nearest-neighbor, interactions, this velocity is a constant independent of the distance travelled. In long-range interacting systems, this velocity remains finite, but it can increase with the distance travelled.&lt;ref name="HK04" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the study of quantum systems such as [[quantum optics]], [[quantum information theory]], [[atomic physics]], and [[condensed matter physics]], it is important to know that there is a [[wikt:finite|finite]] speed with which information can propagate. The theory of relativity shows that no information, or anything else for that matter, can travel faster than the speed of light. When non-relativistic mechanics is considered, however, ([[Newtonian mechanics|Newton's equations]] of motion or [[Schrödinger's equation]] of quantum mechanics) it had been thought that there is then no limitation to the speed of propagation of information. This is not so for certain kinds of quantum systems of atoms arranged in a lattice, often called quantum spin systems. This is important conceptually and practically, because it means that, for short periods of time, distant parts of a system act independently.

One of the practical applications of Lieb-Robinson bounds is [[Quantum computer|quantum computing]]. Current proposals to construct quantum computers built out of atomic-like units mostly rely on the existence of this finite speed of propagation to protect against too rapid dispersal of information.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Haah|first=Jeongwan|last2=Hastings|first2=Matthew B.|last3=Kothari|first3=Robin|last4=Low|first4=Guang Hao|date=2018-01-11|title=Quantum algorithm for simulating real time evolution of lattice Hamiltonians|eprint=1801.03922|class=quant-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Review articles can be found in the following references, for example,&lt;ref&gt;B. Nachtergaele, R. Sims, Much Ado About Something: Why Lieb-Robinson bounds are useful,  IAMP News Bulletin, October 2010, 22–29, (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Kliesch, C. Gogolin, J. Eisert, Lieb-Robinson bounds and the simulation of time evolution

== Set up ==

To define the bound, it is necessary to first describe basic facts about quantum mechanical systems composed of several units, each with a finite dimensional [[Hilbert space]].

Lieb-Robinson bounds are considered on a &lt;math&gt; \nu &lt;/math&gt;-dimensional lattice (&lt;math&gt; \nu = 1, 2 &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; 3 &lt;/math&gt;) &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, such as the square lattice
&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = \mathbb{Z}^\nu &lt;/math&gt;.

A [[Hilbert space]] of states &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{H}_x&lt;/math&gt; is associated with each point  &lt;math&gt;x\in\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;. The dimension of this space is finite, but this was generalized in 2008 to include infinite dimensions (see below). This is called ''quantum spin system''.

For every finite subset of the lattice, &lt;math&gt;X  \subset\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;,  the associated Hilbert space is given by the tensor product
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_X=\otimes_{x\in X} \mathcal{H}_x &lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_X&lt;/math&gt;  is a subspace of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_Y&lt;/math&gt; if  &lt;math&gt;X  \subset Y&lt;/math&gt;.

An [[observable]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; supported on (i.e., depends only on) a finite set &lt;math&gt;X\subset \Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a [[linear operator]] on the Hilbert space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_X&lt;/math&gt;.

When &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_x&lt;/math&gt; is finite dimensional, choose a finite [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of operators that span the set of linear operators on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_x&lt;/math&gt;. Then any observable on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_x&lt;/math&gt; can be written as a sum of basis operators on  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_x&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] of the system is described by an interaction &lt;math&gt;\Phi(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt;. The ''interaction'' is a function from the finite sets &lt;math&gt;X\subset\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; to [[Self-adjoint operator|self-adjoint]] observables &lt;math&gt;\Phi(X)&lt;/math&gt; supported in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. The interaction is assumed to be finite range (meaning that  &lt;math&gt;\Phi(X)=0 &lt;/math&gt; if the size of &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; exceeds a certain prescribed size) and [[Translation-invariant|translation invariant]]. These requirements were lifted later.&lt;ref name="HK04"&gt;M. Hastings, T. Koma, Spectral Gap and Exponential Decay of Correlations, Commun.
Math. Phys. 256, 781, (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NOS06" /&gt;

Although translation invariance is usually assumed, it is not necessary to do so. It is enough to assume that the interaction is bounded above and below on its domain. Thus,
the bound is quite robust in the sense that it is tolerant of changes of the Hamiltonian. A finite range ''is'' essential, however. An interaction is said to be of finite range if there is a finite number &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; such that for any set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with diameter greater than &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; the interaction is zero, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\Phi(X)=0&lt;/math&gt;. Again, this requirement was lifted later.&lt;ref name="HK04" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NOS06" /&gt;

The Hamiltonian of the system with interaction &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is defined formally by:
:&lt;math&gt;H_\Phi=\sum_{X\subset\Gamma}\Phi(X)&lt;/math&gt;.

The laws of quantum mechanics say that corresponding to every physically observable quantity there is a self-adjoint operator &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.
For every observable &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; with a finite support Hamiltonian defines a continuous one-parameter group  &lt;math&gt;\tau_t&lt;/math&gt;
of transformations of the observables &lt;math&gt;\tau_t&lt;/math&gt;
given by
:&lt;math&gt;\tau_t(A)=e^{itH_\Phi}Ae^{-itH_\Phi}.&lt;/math&gt;
Here, &lt;math&gt;t &lt;/math&gt; has a physical meaning of time.
(Technically speaking, this time evolution is defined by a power-series expansion that is known to be a norm-convergent series &lt;math&gt;\tau_t(A)=A+it[H,A]+\frac{(it)^2}{2!}[H, [H, A]]+\cdots &lt;/math&gt;, see,&lt;ref name="R68"&gt;D. Ruelle, Statistical mechanics. Rigorous results, Benjamin, New York, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; Theorem 7.6.2, which is an adaptation from.&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Robinson, Statistical mechanics of quantum spin systems II. Comm. Math. Phys. 7, 337–348, (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; More rigorous details can be found in.&lt;ref name="LR72" /&gt;)

The bound in question was proved in&lt;ref name="LR72" /&gt; and is the following: For any observables &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; B&lt;/math&gt; with finite supports &lt;math&gt;X\subset\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;Y\subset\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, and for any time &lt;math&gt;t\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; the following holds for some positive constants &lt;math&gt;a, c &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; v&lt;/math&gt;:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\| \, [\tau_t(A), B]\,  \|\leq c\, \exp\{-a(d(X,Y)-v|t|)\},&lt;/math&gt; |{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;d(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the distance between the sets &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. The operator  &lt;math&gt; [A,B] = AB-BA&lt;/math&gt; is called the commutator of the operators &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; B &lt;/math&gt;, while the symbol &lt;math&gt;  \| O  \|&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Operator norm|norm]], or size, of an operator &lt;math&gt; O &lt;/math&gt;. It is very important to note that the bound has nothing to do with the ''state'' of the quantum system, but depends only on the Hamiltoninan governing the dynamics. Once this operator bound is established it necessarily carries over to any state of the system.

A positive constant &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; depends on the norms of the observables &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, the sizes of the supports &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, the interaction, the lattice structure and the dimension of the Hilbert space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_x&lt;/math&gt;. A positive constant &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; depends on the interaction and the lattice structure only. The number &lt;math&gt;a&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;
can be chosen at will provided &lt;math&gt;d(X,Y)/v|t|&lt;/math&gt; is chosen sufficiently large. In other words, the further out one goes on the light cone, &lt;math&gt;d(X,Y)-v|t|&lt;/math&gt;, the sharper the exponential decay rate is.
(In later works authors tended to regard &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; as a fixed constant.) The constant  &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''group velocity''' or '''Lieb-Robinson velocity'''.

The bound ({{EquationNote|1}}) is presented slightly differently from the equation in the original paper which derived ''velocity-dependent'' decay rates along spacetime ''rays'' with velocity greater than &lt;math&gt;v_{LR}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="LR72" /&gt; This more explicit form ({{EquationNote|1}}) can be seen from the proof of the bound&lt;ref name="LR72" /&gt;

Lieb-Robinson bound shows that for times &lt;math&gt;|t| &lt; d(X, Y )/v&lt;/math&gt; the norm on the right-hand side is exponentially small. This is the exponentially small error mentioned above.

The reason for considering the commutator on the left-hand side of the Lieb–Robinson bounds is the following:

The commutator between observables &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; B&lt;/math&gt; is zero if their supports are disjoint.

The converse is also true: if observable &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is such that its commutator with any observable &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; supported outside some set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is zero, then &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; has a support inside set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

This statement is also approximately true in the following sense:&lt;ref&gt;S. Bachmann, S. Michalakis, B. Nachtergaele, R. Sims, Automorphic Equivalence within Gapped Phases of Quantum Lattice Systems, Commun. Math. Phys. 309, 835–871, (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; suppose that there exists some &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that  &lt;math&gt;\|[A, B]\| \leq \epsilon \|B\|&lt;/math&gt; for some observable &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and any observable &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; that is supported outside the set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exists an observable &lt;math&gt;A(\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt; with support inside set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; that approximates an observable &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt; \|A - A(\epsilon)\| \leq \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, Lieb-Robinson bounds say that the time evolution of an observable &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; with support in a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is supported (up to exponentially small errors) in a &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-neighborhood of set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\delta &lt; v|t|&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; being the Lieb-Robinson velocity. Outside this set there is no influence of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, this bounds assert that the speed of propagation of perturbations in quantum spin systems is bounded.

== Improvements of the Lieb-Robinson bounds ==

In&lt;ref name="R76"&gt;D. W. Robinson, Properties of propagation of quantum spin systems, J. Austral. Math. Soc. 19 (Series B), 387–399, (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson generalized the bound ({{EquationNote|1}}) by considering exponentially decaying interactions (that need not be translation invariant), i.e., for which the strength of the interaction decays exponentially with the diameter of the set.
This result is discussed in detail in,&lt;ref name="BR2"&gt;O. Bratteli, D. W. Robinson, Operator algebras and quantum statistical mechanics, 1ed., vol. 2, Springer-Verlag, 1981 and 2 ed., vol. 2, Springer-Verlag, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter 6. No great interest was shown in the Lieb-Robinson bounds until 2004 when Hastings&lt;ref name="H04_2"&gt;M. Hastings, Lieb–Schultz–Mattis in higher dimensions, Phys. Rev. B 69, 104431–10444, (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; applied them to the [[#Lieb_Schutz_Mattis_2015_05_08|Lieb–Schultz–Mattis]] theorem.
Subsequently,  Nachtergaele and Sims&lt;ref name="NS06"&gt;B. Nachtergaele, R. Sims, Lieb-Robinson bounds and the exponential clustering theorem, Commun. Math. Phys., 265, 119–130, (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; extended the results of&lt;ref name="R76"/&gt; to include models on vertices with a metric and to derive [[#Exp_decay_corr_2015_05_08|exponential decay of correlations]]. From 2005–2006 interest in Lieb–Robinson bounds strengthened with additional applications to exponential decay of correlations (see&lt;ref name="HK04" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NOS06"&gt;B. Nachtergaele, Y. Ogata, R. Sims, Propagation of Correlations in Quantum Lattice Systems, J. Stat. Phys. 124, 1–13, (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="H04"&gt;M. Hastings, Locality in quantum and Markov dynamics on lattices and networks, Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 140402, (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; and the sections below). New proofs of the bounds were developed and, in particular, the constant in ({{EquationNote|1}}) was improved making it independent of the dimension of the Hilbert space.

Several further improvements of the constant &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; in  ({{EquationNote|1}}) were made.&lt;ref&gt;B. Nachtergaele, R. Sims. Locality Estimates for Quantum Spin Systems, Sidoravicius, Vladas (Ed.), New Trends in Mathematical Physics. Selected contributions of the XVth International Congress on Mathematical Physics, Springer Verlag, 591–614, (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008 the Lieb-Robinson bound was extended to the case in which each &lt;math&gt;H_x&lt;/math&gt; is infinite dimensional.&lt;ref name="NRSS09"&gt;B. Nachtergaele, H. Raz, B. Schlein, R. Sims, Lieb-Robinson bounds for harmonic and anharmonic lattice systems, Commun. Math. Phys. 286, 1073–1098, (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
In&lt;ref name="NRSS09" /&gt; it was shown that on-site unbounded perturbations do not change the Lieb-Robinson bound. That is,  Hamiltonians of the following form can be considered on a finite subset &lt;math&gt;\Lambda\subset\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;H_\Lambda=\sum_{x\in\Lambda}H_x+\sum_{X\subset\Lambda}\Phi(X),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;H_x&lt;/math&gt; is a self-adjoint operator over &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_x&lt;/math&gt;, which needs not to be bounded.

=== Harmonic and Anharmonic Hamiltonians ===

The Lieb-Robinson bounds were extended to certain continuous quantum systems, that is to a general harmonic Hamiltonian,&lt;ref name="NRSS09" /&gt; which, in a finite volume &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_L=(-L, L)^d \cap\mathbb{Z}^d,&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;L, d &lt;/math&gt; are positive integers, takes the form:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{x\in\Gamma_L}p_x^2+\omega^2q_x^2+\sum_{x\in\Gamma_L}\sum_{j=1}^\nu\lambda_j(q_x-q_{x+e_j})^2,&lt;/math&gt;
where the periodic boundary conditions are imposed and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_j\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\omega&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Here &lt;math&gt;\{e_j\}&lt;/math&gt; are canonical basis vectors in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^d&lt;/math&gt;.

Anharmonic Hamiltonians with on-site and multiple-site perturbations were considered and the Lieb–Robinson bounds were derived for them,&lt;ref name="NRSS09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NSSSZ10"&gt;B. Nachtergaele, B. Schlein, R. Sims, S. Starr, V. Zagrebnov, On the existence of the dynamics for anharmonic quantum oscillator systems, Rev. Math. Phys., 22, 207–231, (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;
Further generalizations of the harmonic lattice were discussed,&lt;ref&gt;M. Cramer, A. Serafini, J. Eisert, Locality of dynamics in general harmonic quantum systems, arXiv:0803.0890, (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Juenemann, A. Cadarso, D. Perez-Garcia, A. Bermudez, J. J. Garcia-Ripoll, Lieb–Robinson bounds for spin-boson lattice models and trapped ions, arXiv:1307.1992, (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Irreversible dynamics ===

Another generalization of the Lieb–Robinson bounds was made to the irreversible dynamics,
in which case the dynamics has a Hamiltonian part and also a dissipative part. The dissipative part is described by terms of Lindblad form, so that the dynamics &lt;math&gt;\tau_t&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the [[Lindblad equation|Lindblad-Kossakowski]] master equation.

Lieb-Robinson bounds for the irreversible dynamics were considered by&lt;ref name="H04"/&gt; in the classical context and by&lt;ref&gt;D. Poulin, Lieb–Robinson bound and locality for general Markovian quantum dynamics, Phys.
Rev. Lett. 104, 190401, (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; for a class of quantum lattice systems with finite-range interactions. Lieb-Robinson bounds for lattice models with a dynamics generated by both Hamiltonian and dissipative interactions with suitably fast decay in space, and that may depend on time, were proved by,&lt;ref name="NVZ11"&gt;B. Nachtergaele, A. Vershynina, V. Zagrebnov, Lieb-Robinson bounds and Existence of the thermodynamic limit for a class of irreversible quantum dynamics, AMS Contemporary Mathematics, 552, 161–175, (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; where they also proved the existence of the infinite dynamics as a strongly continuous cocycle of unit preserving completely positive maps.

=== Power-law interactions ===
The Lieb-Robinson bounds were also generalized to interactions that decay as a power-law, i.e. the strength of the interaction is upper bounded by &lt;math&gt;1/r^\alpha,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;is the diameter of the set and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;is a positive constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hastings|first=Matthew B.|last2=Koma|first2=Tohru|date=2006-04-22|title=Spectral Gap and Exponential Decay of Correlations|journal=Communications in Mathematical Physics|language=en|volume=265|issue=3|pages=781–804|doi=10.1007/s00220-006-0030-4|issn=0010-3616|citeseerx=10.1.1.339.9339}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gong|first=Zhe-Xuan|last2=Foss-Feig|first2=Michael|last3=Michalakis|first3=Spyridon|last4=Gorshkov|first4=Alexey V.|date=2014-07-16|title=Persistence of Locality in Systems with Power-Law Interactions|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=113|issue=3|pages=030602|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.030602|pmid=25083624}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Foss-Feig|first=Michael|last2=Gong|first2=Zhe-Xuan|last3=Clark|first3=Charles W.|last4=Gorshkov|first4=Alexey V.|date=2015-04-13|title=Nearly Linear Light Cones in Long-Range Interacting Quantum Systems|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=114|issue=15|pages=157201|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.157201|pmid=25933335}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Tran|first=Minh C.|last2=Guo|first2=Andrew Y.|last3=Su|first3=Yuan|last4=Garrison|first4=James R.|last5=Eldredge|first5=Zachary|last6=Foss-Feig|first6=Michael|last7=Childs|first7=Andrew M.|last8=Gorshkov|first8=Alexey V.|date=2018-08-15|title=Locality and digital quantum simulation of power-law interactions|eprint=1808.05225|class=quant-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding whether locality persists for power-law interactions hold serious implications for systems such as trapped ions, Rydberg atoms, ultracold atoms and molecules.

In contrast to the finite-range interacting systems where information may only travel at a constant speed, power-law interactions allow information to travel at a speed that increases with the distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eldredge|first=Zachary|last2=Gong|first2=Zhe-Xuan|last3=Young|first3=Jeremy T.|last4=Moosavian|first4=Ali Hamed|last5=Foss-Feig|first5=Michael|last6=Gorshkov|first6=Alexey V.|date=2017-10-25|title=Fast Quantum State Transfer and Entanglement Renormalization Using Long-Range Interactions|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=119|issue=17|pages=170503|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.170503|pmid=29219445}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Lieb-Robinson bounds for power-law interactions typically yield a sub-linear light cone that is asymptotically linear in the limit &lt;math&gt;\alpha \rightarrow \infty.&lt;/math&gt; A recent analysis using quantum simulation algorithm implied a light cone &lt;math&gt;t \gtrsim r^{(\alpha-2D)(\alpha-D)},&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the dimension of the system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Tightening the light cone for power-law interactions is still an active research area.

== Some applications ==

Lieb–Robinson bounds are used in many areas of mathematical physics. Among the main applications of the bound there is the error bounds on quantum simulation algorithms, the existence of the thermodynamic limit, the exponential decay of correlations and the Lieb–Schultz–Mattis theorem.

=== {{anchor|Exp_decay_corr_2015_05_08}} Digital quantum simulation algorithms ===
The aim of digital quantum simulation is to simulate the dynamics of a quantum system using the least amount of elementary quantum gates. For a nearest-neighbor interacting system with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; particles, simulating its dynamics for time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; using the [[Lie product formula]] requires &lt;math&gt;O(n^2t^2)&lt;/math&gt; quantum gates. In 2018, Haah et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; proposed a near optimal quantum algorithm that uses only &lt;math&gt;O(nt\log(nt))&lt;/math&gt; quantum gates. The idea is to approximate the dynamics of the system by dynamics of its subsystems, some of them spatially separated. The error of the approximation is bounded by the original Lieb-Robinson bound. Later, the algorithm is generalized to power-law interactions and subsequently used to derive a stronger Lieb-Robinson bound.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== {{anchor|Exp_decay_corr_2015_05_08}} Thermodynamic limit of the dynamics ===

One of the important properties of any model meant to describe properties of bulk matter is the existence of the thermodynamic limit. This says that intrinsic properties of the system should be essentially independent of the size of the system which, in any experimental setup, is finite.

The static thermodynamic limit from the equilibrium point of view was settled much before the Lieb–Robinson bound was proved, see&lt;ref name="R68" /&gt; for example. In certain cases one can use a Lieb–Robinson bound to establish the existence of a thermodynamic limit of the ''dynamics'', &lt;math&gt;\tau_t^{\Gamma}&lt;/math&gt;, for an
infinite lattice &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; as the limit of finite lattice dynamics. The limit is usually considered over an increasing sequence of finite subsets &lt;math&gt;\Lambda_n\subset\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. such that for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;m&lt;/math&gt;, there is an inclusion &lt;math&gt; \Lambda_n\subset\Lambda_m&lt;/math&gt;. In order to prove the existence of the infinite dynamics &lt;math&gt;\tau_t^\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; as a strongly continuous, one-parameter group of automorphisms, it was proved that &lt;math&gt; \{\tau_t^{\Lambda_n} \}_n&lt;/math&gt; is a Cauchy sequence and consequently is convergent. By elementary considerations, the existence of the thermodynamic limit then follows. A more detailed discussion of the thermodynamic limit can be found in&lt;ref name="BR2_2"&gt;O. Bratteli, D. W. Robinson, Operator algebras and quantum statistical mechanics, 2 ed., vol. 2, Springer Verlag, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; section 6.2.

Robinson was the first to show the existence of the thermodynamic limit for exponentially decaying interactions.&lt;ref name="R76" /&gt; Later, Nachtergaele et al.&lt;ref name="NOS06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NSSSZ10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NVZ11" /&gt; showed the existence of the infinite volume dynamics for almost every type of interaction described in the section "Improvements of Lieb–Robinson bounds" above.

=== {{anchor|Exp_decay_corr_2015_05_08}} Exponential decay of correlations ===

Let &lt;math&gt;\langle A \rangle_\Omega &lt;/math&gt; denote the [[Expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expectation value]] of the observable &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in a state &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. The correlation function between two observables &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt; \langle AB \rangle_\Omega-\langle A \rangle_\Omega\langle B \rangle_\Omega.&lt;/math&gt;

Lieb–Robinson bounds are used to show that the correlations decay exponentially in distance for a system with an ''energy gap above a non-degenerate ground state'' &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, see.&lt;ref name="HK04" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NS06" /&gt; In other words, the inequality
:&lt;math&gt;|\langle AB \rangle_\Omega-\langle A \rangle_\Omega\langle B \rangle_\Omega|\leq K\|A\|\|B\|\min(|X|,|Y|)\ e^{-a\, d(X,Y)}, &lt;/math&gt;
holds for observables &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; with support in the sets &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Here &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; are some constants.

Alternatively the state &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; can be taken as a product state, in which case correlations decay exponentially without assuming the energy gap above the ground state.&lt;ref name="NOS06" /&gt;

Such a decay was long known for relativistic dynamics, but only guessed for Newtonian dynamics. The Lieb–Robinson bounds succeed in replacing the relativistic symmetry by local estimates on the Hamiltonian.

=== {{anchor|Lieb_Schutz_Mattis_2015_05_08}} Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem ===

'''Lieb-Schultz-Mattis''' theorem implies that the ground state of the Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a bipartite lattice with isomorphic sublattices, is non-degenerate, i.e., unique, but the gap can be very small.&lt;ref&gt;E. Lieb, D. Mattis, Ordering energy levels in interacting spin chains, Journ. Math. Phys. 3,
749–751, (1962)&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_L\leq c/L,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; L &lt;/math&gt; is the size of the lattice and &lt;math&gt; c&lt;/math&gt; is a constant. Many attempts were made to extend this result to ''higher dimensions'', &lt;math&gt; d&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;,

The Lieb–Robinson bound was utilized by Hastings&lt;ref name="H04_2"/&gt; and by Nachtergaele-Sims&lt;ref name="NS07"&gt;B. Nachtergaele, R. Sims, A multi-dimensional Lieb–Schultz–Mattis theorem, Commun. Math. Phys. 276, 437-472, (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  in a proof of the Lieb–Schultz–Mattis Theorem for higher-dimensional cases.
The following bound on the gap was obtained:
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_L\leq c\log (L)/L. &lt;/math&gt;.

=== {{anchor|Continua_Discretisation_2016_02_14}} Discretisation of the Continuum via Gauss-Quadrature Rules ===

In 2015, it was shown that the Lieb-Robinson bound can also have applications outside of the context of local Hamiltonians as we now explain. The [[Quantum dissipation|Spin-Boson model]] describes the dynamics of a spin coupled to a continuum of oscillators. It has been studied in great detail and explains quantum dissipative effects in a wide range of quantum systems. Let &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; denote the Hamiltonian of the Spin-Boson model with a continuum bosonic bath, and &lt;math&gt;H_L&lt;/math&gt; denote the Spin-Boson model who's bath has been discretised to include &lt;math&gt;L\in\mathbb{N}^+&lt;/math&gt; harmonic oscillators with frequencies chosen according to [[Gaussian quadrature|Gauss Quadrature Rules]]. For all observables &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; on the Spin Hamiltonian, the error on the expectation value of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; induced by discretising the Spin-Boson model according to the above discretisation scheme is bounded by&lt;ref&gt;M.P. Woods &amp; M.B. Plenio, Dynamical error bounds for continuum discretisation via Gauss quadrature rules, --A Lieb-Robinson bound approach, J. Math. Phys. 57, 022105 (2016), [https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07354 ArXiv]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; 
|\text{tr}[e^{i t H}A e^{-i t H}]-\text{tr}[e^{i t H_L}A e^{-i t H_L}]|\leq c\, e^{-a (L-v|t|)},
&lt;/math&gt; |}}
where &lt;math&gt;c,a&lt;/math&gt; are positive constants and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the Lieb-Robinson velocity which in this case is directly proportional to &lt;math&gt;\omega_{max}&lt;/math&gt;, the maximum frequency of the bath in the Spin-Boson model. Here, the number of discrete modes &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; play the role of a distance &lt;math&gt;d(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt; mentioned below Eq. ({{EquationNote|1}}). One can also bound the error induced by local Fock space truncation of the harmonic oscillators&lt;ref&gt;M.P. Woods, M. Cramer &amp; M.B. Plenio, Simulation Bosonic Baths with Error bars, Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 130401 (2015) [https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01531 ArXiv]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lignophagia''' is the [[List of abnormal behaviours in animals|abnormal behaviour]] of chewing and eating [[wood]].&lt;ref name="Broom2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Broom, D.M.  |author2=Fraser, A.F.|year=2015|title=Domestic Animal Behaviour and Welfare|publisher=CABI|edition=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been recorded in several species, but perhaps most commonly in [[horse]]s where it is usually called, simply, "wood chewing". Lignophagia is a form of the [[Pica (disorder)|pica disorder]], in which normally non-nutritive substances are chewed or eaten. For some animals, wood is the normal primary food source; such animals are known as [[Xylophagy|xylophagous]].

A related [[stable vices| stereotypy]] in horses is [[Cribbing (horse)|cribbing]], where a horse grabs a board or other edged object with its teeth, arches its neck and sucks in air.  While this activity may cause some tooth marks on the surface used, this is not the same disorder as lignophagia.

==Etymology==
Lignophagia is derived from the Latin ''lignum'', meaning "wood", and the Greek ''phago'', meaning "to eat".

==In horses==
Horses often gnaw on wood rails, fences or boards as if they were food.&lt;ref name=Litva&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Litva |first1=A. |last2=Robinson |first2=C. S. |last3=Archer |first3=D. C. |title=Exploring lay perceptions of the causes of crib-biting/windsucking behaviour in horses |journal=Equine Veterinary Journal |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=288–93 |year=2010 |pmid=20525045 |doi=10.1111/j.2042-3306.2009.00025.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been linked with dietary deficiencies, and often can be remedied with a balanced diet or dietary supplementation&lt;ref name=Green/&gt;  Lignophagia in horses can be a cause of [[colic]] due to the ingestion of wood splinters.&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Green |first1=P. |last2=Tong |first2=J. |title=Small intestinal obstruction associated with wood chewing in two horses |journal=Veterinary Record |volume=123 |issue=8 |pages=196–8 |year=1988 |pmid=3176272 |doi=10.1136/vr.123.8.196}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in severe cases, can cause excessive wearing and deterioration of the teeth.&lt;ref name="Dixon 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dixon|first1=P.M.|last2=Dacre|first2=I|title=A review of equine dental disorders|journal=Veterinary Journal|year=2005|volume=169|issue=2|pages=165–187|pmid=15727909|doi=10.1016/j.tvjl.2004.03.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related vice is [[Cribbing (horse)|cribbing]], wherein the horse grabs a wood board and sucks in air; not all wood-chewing is cribbing and though cribbing may also result in chewing on the wood surface, the two vices are not identical.

Colic can be a consequence of wood chewing due to the ingestion of wood splinters.&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Green |first1=P. |last2=Tong |first2=J. |title=Small intestinal obstruction associated with wood chewing in two horses |journal=Veterinary Record |volume=123 |issue=8 |pages=196–8 |year=1988 |pmid=3176272 |doi=10.1136/vr.123.8.196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both cribbing and wood chewing can cause excessive wearing and deterioration of the teeth in severe cases.&lt;ref name="Dixon 2005"/&gt;  Horses displaying these behaviors may be less desirable to potential buyers and may be devalued as a consequence.&lt;ref name="Cooper1998"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cooper, J.J.  |author2=Mason G.J.|year=1998|title=The identification of abnormal behaviour and behavioural problems in stabled horses and their relationship to horse welfare: a comparative review|journal=Equine Veterinary Journal|volume=30|pages=Supplementary 27, 5–9|doi=10.1111/j.2042-3306.1998.tb05136.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood chewing also is destructive to barns and fences, sometimes requiring costly repairs and ongoing maintenance.

Wood chewing has been linked with dietary deficiencies, and often can be remedied with a balanced diet or dietary supplementation.&lt;ref name=Green/&gt; Some cases are thought to be linked to boredom or anxiety, often related to confinement.

==In dogs==
Dogs sometimes eat wood which can have negative consequences.  Sometimes they will chew the [[furniture]] of their owners meaning items must be replaced.  Splinters may lodge in the mouth, gums or tongue, causing a depressed appetite. The wood can perforate or block the [[Esophagus|oesophagus]] or the [[intestine]], often requiring surgery.  Chemically treated wood can result in poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sarahsdogs.com/qa/why-do-dogs-eat-wood/|title=Why do dogs eat wood?|author=Sarah's Dogs|year=2012|accessdate=September 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In humans==
Humans sometimes chew or eat wood, e.g. [[pencils]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheknows.com/food-and-recipes/articles/840423/top-10-craziest-eating-habits|author=Borboa, M.|title=Weird eating behaviors|year=2011|accessdate=September 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In humans, eating wood is sometimes referred to as '''[[Pica (disorder)|xylophagia]]'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6391">'''Lime-ash floors''' were an economic form of floor construction from the 15th century to the 19th century, for upper floors in parts of [[England]] where [[limestone]] or [[chalk]] were easily available. They were strong, flexible, and offered [[heat insulation|good heat]] and [[sound insulation]].&lt;ref name=Hartley&gt;{{Harvnb|Hartley|1996|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Malthouse, Kirklees Home Farm, Clifton - geograph.org.uk - 177720.jpg|thumb|A malthouse in [[Yorkshire]], England, that uses lime-ash floors]] &lt;!-- I need some better images!--&gt;
Lime-ash is the residue found at the bottom of a wood-fired [[lime kiln]], consisting of waste lime and wood ash.&lt;ref name=BiffVernon&gt;{{Harvnb|Vernon|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; These kilns became common in the early 15th century and continued to be used until newer technology replaced them in the late 19th century. Lime-ash could also be made in coal-fired kilns. In areas where gypsum was common they were known as plaster floors.{{r|Hartley}} Lime ash was used on the upper floors of yeomans houses and in great houses such as [[Hardwick Hall]] in Derbyshire, where the upper surface would be buffed to a fine finish using a mixture of egg-white, curdled milk and [[isinglass|fish-gelatine]].{{r|BiffVernon}} The underside could be left bare or smoothed with a lime-plaster. Alternatively the floor joist could be concealed with a conventional lath and plaster ceiling.{{r|Hartley}}

Isaac Ware in his ''A Complete Body of Architecture (1756)'' remarks on "the beauty of floors of plaster mixed with other ingredients", comparing them with those of granite.{{r|Hartley-2}}

==Construction==
A lime-ash floor typically occurs on the upper floors of a building. One can expect to find construction beams lying the length of the building with flooring [[joist]]s being placed across at intervals of about 400mm (16&amp;nbsp;in). A bed of [[Reed (plant)|reeds]] (or similar grasses) is placed on the joists making a tight thatch. They are secured by placing oak laths over them and nailing these to the joists. A 50mm slurry of ''lime-ash composition'' is poured over the bedding material which supports it  until the lime-ash has dried out.{{r|BiffVernon}} The reed bed acts as [[Formwork|shuttering]] and laths add to the rigidity of the floor. However laths that are too tightly fixed to the joists hinder the movement the floor must have to cope with settlement and the structural changes during its lifetime which can be counted in centuries.{{r|Hartley-2}}

The lime-ash composition varies according to the materials locally available:

* [[Lime (material)|Lime]]&amp;nbsp;– acts as a binder and contains particles of raw limestone and over burnt lime.
* Fuel ash&amp;nbsp;– this [[pozzolan#Pozzolanic materials|pozzolanic]] material binds its constituent Si(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with the Ca² ions in a [[pozzolanic reaction]]. It contains burnt wood or coal.
* [[Gypsum]], to help with set
* [[Clay]] with fragments of broken brick and tile, another pozzolanic material
* [[Silica]] or sand, which acts as an [[Aggregate (composite)|aggregate]]
* Other debris&amp;nbsp;– vegetable or animal and bubbles of air.{{r|Hartley-2}}

Nigel and Mary Kerr in ''Lincolnshire Life'', November 1987, write: "A traditional mix used in Nottinghamshire, Northamptonshire and south Lincolnshire was: 'One third lime, one third well sifted coal ashes and one third loamy clay and horse dung from grasses{{'"}}. They add that ox blood and horse hair were sometimes included.{{r|BiffVernon}}&lt;ref name="Kerr"&gt;{{citation|last=Kerr|first=Nigel |author2=Kerr, Mary|year=1987|journal=Lincolnshire Life|volume=1987|issue=November}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problems occurring===
After long use the surface can start to break up: this can be ignored, or a further [[screed]] of lime-ash composition can be laid over the original floor. This was often done in the past but does increase the weight of the structure. Damp can cause fungi to rot the bedding material, or insects to gnaw away the laths and indeed the joists, taking with it the floor. Knocking through service ducts without due care can destroy the floor, as can overloading due to change of use or addition of partition walls.{{r|Hartley-2}}

===Laying a new floor===
Lime-ash is generally no longer available, so repairs and reconstruction are usually done using a mixture of lime putty, coal ash, Gypsum (Class A hemi hydrate fine casting plaster), unburnt loamy clay and burnt crushed tile. To this are added retardants such as [[Keratin]] (natural) or [[Sodium Citrate]] (manufactured).&lt;ref name=Hartley-3&gt;{{Harvnb|Hartley|1996|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bedding material is repaired with [[water reed]] {{convert|5|ft|mm}}, or [[winter wheat|combed winter wheat]] which is the strongest form of straw, and [[chestnut|chestnut laths]] which can be obtained in {{convert|4|ft|mm}} lengths.

==Geographical variations==
They can be found principally in Derbyshire, Cheshire, Shropshire, Herefordshire and the Welsh borders, Staffordshire, Leicestershire, Worcestershire and Warwickshire; Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire and many parts of Yorkshire.&lt;ref name=Hartley-2&gt;{{Harvnb|Hartley|1996|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some floors are made almost entirely of gypsum, particularly around Newark&amp;nbsp;– plaster floors would be a better description.{{r|BiffVernon}}

[[File:Serpentine lines from William Hogarth's The Analysis of Beauty.jpg|thumbnail|right|Serpentine lines from Hogarth's ''The Analysis of Beauty'']]

'''Line of beauty''' is a term and a theory in [[art]] or [[aesthetics]] used to describe an S-shaped curved line (a [[serpentine shape|serpentine]] line) appearing within an object, as the boundary line of an object, or as a virtual boundary line formed by the composition of several objects. This theory originated with [[William Hogarth]] (18th-century English painter, satirist, and writer), and is an essential part of Hogarth's theory of aesthetics as described in his ''[[Analysis of Beauty]]'' (1753). According to this theory, S-shaped curved lines signify liveliness and activity and excite the attention of the viewer as contrasted with straight lines, parallel lines, or right-angled intersecting lines, which signify stasis, death, or inanimate objects.

In contrast to grand compositional lines, which are regularly found in [[Baroque]] or [[Rococo]] art, the serpentine line is not primarily dictating the whole composition of a canvas. Instead, the line should be understood as being found in parts; a composition is created by employing various kinds of lines in various relations to each other without destroying its simplicity.

A '''media event,''' also known as a pseudo-event,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scherer|first1=Helmut|title=Media Events and Pseudo-Events|url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405131995_chunk_g978140513199518_ss36-1|website=Blackwell Reference Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an event or activity conducted for the purpose of media [[publicity]]. It may also include any event that is covered in the [[mass media]] or was hosted largely with the media in mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media events may center on a news announcement, an [[anniversary]], a [[news conference]], or planned events like speeches or demonstrations.  Instead of paying for advertising time, a media or pseudo-event seeks to use [[public relations]] to gain media and public attention.

The term pseudo-event was coined by the [[theorist]] and [[historian]] [[Daniel J. Boorstin]] in his 1961 book ''[[The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-events in America]]'': “The celebration is held, [[Photo Op|photographs are taken]], the occasion is widely reported.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boorstin|first=Daniel Joseph
 |title=The image: A guide to pseudo-events in America
 |publisher=Vintage|location=New York|year=1961|isbn=0-679-74180-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is closely related to idea of [[hyperreality]] and thus [[postmodernism]], although Boorstin’s coinage  predates the two ideas and related work of postmodern thinkers such as [[Jean Baudrillard]]. A media event being a kind of [[Event management|planned event]], it may be called [[Authenticity (philosophy)|inauthentic]] in contrast to a spontaneous one.

In distinguishing between a pseudo-event and a spontaneous one, Boorstin states characteristics of a pseudo-event in his book titled "Hidden History."  He says that a pseudo-event is: dramatic, repeatable, costly, intellectually planned, and social.  It causes other pseudo-events, and one must know about it to be considered "informed".&lt;ref&gt;Boorstin, D. Hidden History. Harper &amp; Row, 1987. 279-280. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Elihu Katz outlines the defining characteristics of a media event as: immediate (i.e., it is broadcast live), organized by a non-media entity, containing ceremonial and dramatic value, preplanning, and centering on a personality, whether that be a single person or a group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Katz|first1=Elihu|title=Media Events: The Sense of Occasion|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1271&amp;context=asc_papers|website=University of Pennsylvania ScholarlyCommons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[video art]]ists have explored the concept of a pseudo-event. The group [[Ant Farm (group)|Ant Farm]] especially plays with pseudo events, though not so identified, in their works "Media Burn" (1975) and "[[The Eternal Frame]]" (1975).

==Types ==
[[File:Madrid 2020 bid - 130907 203400.jpg|thumb|upright|Madrid sends its bid for the [[2020 Summer Olympics]]]]
A [[news conference]] is often held when an organization wants members of the press to get an announcement simultaneously. The in-person events may include interviews, questioning, and show-and-tell.

Media events like news conferences can come to be expected, especially before, during, and after sporting events, and the [[National Football League]] demands that its players provide a weekly media event by taking postgame questions from reporters.  When Seattle Seahawks running back [[Marshawn Lynch]] dressed and left the stadium after a loss on Nov. 16, 2014, the NFL fined him $100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Werder|first1=Ed|title=Silence Costs Marshawn Lynch $100K|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11904067/nfl-takes-100k-seattle-seahawks-marshawn-lynch-media-silence|website=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Award ceremony|Award ceremonies]], red carpet events and celebrity [[photo op]]portunities are all considered a type of media event, where the event is orchestrated for the purpose of introducing a chosen narrative into the media.

[[Sex tape|Sex tapes]] when created with the intention of being 'leaked' are a form of pseudo event because their purpose is to generate media attention.

A [[protest]] may be planned almost exclusively for the purpose of getting media attention to an issue or cause.

[[Political convention|Political conventions]], or planned presentations or speeches about company earnings or political issues, are a form of media event.

== Historic examples ==
Media events became prominent when the media did. The driving of the [[Golden Spike]] in [[Promontory Summit, Utah]], in 1869 has been described as one of the first media events in the United States.  [[Edward Bernays]] and his [[Torches of Freedom]] campaign in 1929 is an example of an early media event that successfully influenced public opinion.  Similarly, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] visit to the United States in 1959 was highly influential, and has been cited as the first example of media events being utilised in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Media events became practical in the middle 19th century as the Morse [[telegraph]] and the expansion of [[daily newspaper]]s introduced same-day [[news cycle]]s.  The emergence of the internet led to many media stories being published live from the media event, real-time Twitter coverage, and immediate analysis of televised media events. When musical artist [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] pretended to take questions during his [[Super Bowl]] press conference but instead broke immediately into song, his performance itself became a meta media-event-within-a-media-event&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prince--The Super Bowl Press Conference 2007|url=http://www.wat.tv/video/prince-the-superbowl-press-6pq1b_2hztv_.html|website=Wat|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109225101/http://www.wat.tv/video/prince-the-superbowl-press-6pq1b_2hztv_.html|archivedate=2015-01-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mobile television''' is [[television]] watched on a small [[handheld]] or mobile device. It includes [[pay TV]] service delivered via [[mobile phone]] networks or received [[free-to-air]] via [[terrestrial television]] stations. Regular broadcast standards or special mobile TV transmission formats can be used. Additional features include [[download]]ing [[TV program]]s and [[podcast]]s from the Internet and storing programming for later viewing.

According to the ''Harvard Business Review'', the growing adoption of [[smartphones]] allowed users to watch as much mobile video in three days of the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] as they watched throughout the entire [[2008 Summer Olympics]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;an increase of 564%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2011/01/31/4-ways-smartphones-save-tv/ Looking for TV Genius? | Red Bee Media]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430000855/http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2011/01/31/4-ways-smartphones-save-tv/ |date=April 30, 2011 }}[http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2011/01/31/4-ways-smartphones-save-tv/ &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] &lt;/ref&gt;

Early mobile television receivers were based on the old [[analog television]] signal system. They were the earliest televisions that could be placed in a coat pocket. The first was the Panasonic IC TV MODEL TR-001, introduced in 1970. The second was sold to the public by [[Clive Sinclair]] in January 1977. It was called the Microvision or the [[MTV-1]]. It had a two-inch (50&amp;nbsp;mm) [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] screen and was also the first television which could pick up signals in multiple countries. It measured 102×159×41&amp;nbsp;mm and was sold for less than [[Pounds sterling|£]]100 in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and for around [[US dollar|$]]400 in the [[United States]]. The project took over ten years to develop and was funded by around £1.6 million in British government grants.&lt;ref name="Clive's achievements"&gt;[http://www.sinclair-research.co.uk/about-srl.php Clive's achievements] [[Sinclair Research]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Video and TV gear"&gt;[http://www.retrothing.com/video_tv/index.html Video and TV gear], [[Retrothing.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In later decades the term "mobile television" was associated with mobile telephones and other mobile digital devices. Mobile TV is among the features provided by many 3G phones.

&lt;!-- The following paragraph is a huge, convoluted mess. The sources don't agree with the prose. Do we really need every carrier listed? How can South Korea be first to have MTV in 2005 when the sentence before said they had it in 2002? etc. --AlanM1--&gt;
In 2002, South Korea became the first country in the world to have a commercial mobile TV by CDMA IS95-C network, and mobile TV over 3G ([[CDMA2000]] 1X EVDO) also became available in that same year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1036976/korean-mobile-content-kings-spill-beans&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, South Korea became the first country in the world to have mobile TV. It started satellite DMB (S-DMB) and terrestrial DMB (T-DMB) services on May 1 and December 1. Today, [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]] are at the forefront of this developing sector.&lt;ref&gt;NYTimes.com via Yahoo! Finance: [http://biz.yahoo.com/nytimes/080506/1194771946810.html?.v=18 Mobile TV Spreading in Europe and to the U.S.], May 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Mobile TV services were launched by the operator CSL during March 2006 in Hong Kong on the 3G network.&lt;ref&gt;3G UK: The service is based on the [http://www.3g.co.uk/PR/March2006/2732.htm Golden Dynamic Enterprises Ltd.]'s [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2006_Dec_4/ai_n16881105 "VOIR Portal"] and follows the 3GPP standard 3G-324 M. The same service was also deployed to the Philippines in 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[British Telecom|BT]] in the [[United Kingdom]] was among the first companies outside South Korea to launch mobile TV in September 2006, although the service was abandoned less than a year later.&lt;ref&gt;ZDnet: [http://news.zdnet.co.uk/communications/0,1000000085,39288247,00.htm BT ditches mobile TV service], 26 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The same happened to MFD Mobiles Fernsehen Deutschland, who launched their [[Digital Multimedia Broadcasting|DMB]]-based service June 2006 in Germany, and stopped it in April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Broadband TV news: [http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/?p=4682 MFD hands back German T-DMB licence], May 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Also in June 2006, mobile operator 3 in Italy (part of [[Hutchison Whampoa]]) launched their mobile TV service, but opposed to their counterpart in Germany this was based on [[DVB-H]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Register'': [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/07/28/dvbh_success_in_italy/ DVB-H rockets ahead in Italy], 28 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Sprint started offering the service in February 2006 and was the first US carrier to offer the service. In the US [[Verizon Wireless]] and more recently [[AT&amp;T Mobility|AT&amp;T]] are offering the service.

In South Korea, mobile TV is largely divided into satellite DMB ([[S-DMB]]) and terrestrial DMB ([[T-DMB]]). Although S-DMB initially had more content, T-DMB has gained much wider popularity because it is free and included as a feature in most mobile handsets sold in the country today.

==Challenges==
Mobile TV usage can be divided into three classes:
* "Fixed"&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;watched while not moving, possibly moved when not being watched
* "Nomadic"&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;watched while moving slowly (e.g. walking)
* "Mobile"&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;watched when moving quickly (e.g. in a car)

Each of these pose different challenges.

===Device manufacturers' challenges===
&lt;!--No explanation for these, and no source. I'm going with something generic for now
* Power consumption&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;battery technology for mobile portable devices may be stuck in a race condition. Improved battery life can be used up by the upgraded mobile content and enhanced functions. However, [[dashtop mobile]] devices can also be powered by a 12-volt vehicle battery, however vehicle batteries are not a sustainable source of power for mobile devices. --AlanM1--&gt;
* Power consumption&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;continuous receipt, decoding, and display of video requires continuous power, and cannot benefit from all of the types of optimizations that are used to reduce power consumption for data and voice services.
* Memory&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;to support the large buffer requirements of mobile TV. Currently available{{when|date=August 2012}} memory capabilities are not suited for long hours of mobile TV viewing. Furthermore, potential future applications like [[peer-to-peer video sharing]] in mobile phones and consumer broadcasting would add to the increasing memory requirements{{why?|date=August 2012}}. The existing P2P algorithms are not expected to be enough for mobile devices, necessitating the advent of [[mobile P2P]] algorithms{{why?|date=August 2012}}. There is one start-up technology that claims [[patent]]ability on its mobile P2P, but has not drawn attention from device manufacturers yet.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

&lt;!--What does this have to do with UI design?
* [[User interface]] design&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;a large number of mobile phones do not support mobile TV; users have to purchase new handsets with improved LCD display and user interface that support mobile TV. This new design has to appeal to the end-users and increase the clarity of images without making the handset very bulky. The wider LCD touchscreens has been preferred by end-users and the iPhone's popularity in the United States is part of the compelling evidence. --AlanM1--&gt;
* Display&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;larger and higher-resolution displays are necessary for an optimal viewing experience.
* Processing power&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;significantly more processor performance is required for mobile TV than that used for UI and simple applications, like browsers and messaging.

==Digital television==

===North America===
{{As of|2012|01}}, there were 120 stations in the United States broadcasting using the [[ATSC-M/H]] "Mobile DTV" standard&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;a mobile and handheld enhancement to the HDTV standard that improves handling of [[multipath interference]] while mobile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OMVC announces sizable growth in number of MDTV stations at CES|url=http://broadcastengineering.com/RF/OMVC-mobile-DTV-presence-announces-growth-CES-01192012/index.html|website=Broadcast Engineering|accessdate=18 August 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922040843/http://broadcastengineering.com/RF/OMVC-mobile-DTV-presence-announces-growth-CES-01192012|archivedate=22 September 2012|date=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- I don't know what this means. Seems like it's talking about audio, not video.

The FCC also chose [[HD Radio]] which uses COFDM and has reasonable mobile reception, does not have provisions for mobile TV as [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]]-T has with [[DMB-T]] and is incompatible even with neighboring [[Canada]], where the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) already chose DAB in the [[L band]]. --AlanM1--&gt;

The defunct [[MediaFLO]] used [[COFDM]] broadcast on [[UHF]] [[TV channel]] 55. Like satellite TV, it was [[encrypt]]ed and controlled by [[conditional access]] (provided via the [[cellular network]]). It required a [[Pay TV|subscription]] for each mobile device, and was limited to the [[AT&amp;T Mobility]] or [[Verizon Wireless]] networks.

===Broadcast mobile DTV development===
&lt;!--Another section in extreme need of a trim --AlanM1--&gt;
While MediaFLO used the TV spectrum and [[MobiTV]] used [[Mobile phone|cell phone]] networks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mobitv.com/technology/managed-service-platform |title=mobile tv cell phone networks: |last=Thompson |first=Mark |date=2010-06-03 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2010-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515184507/http://www.mobitv.com/technology/managed-service-platform |archivedate=May 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "mobile DTV" (ATSC-M/H) used the [[digital TV]] spectrum.

At the April 2007 [[National Association of Broadcasters|National Association of Broadcasters (NAB)]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], the [[ATSC]] and [[8VSB]] methods for delivering mobile DTV were shown. [[A-VSB|Advanced VSB (A-VSB)]], from [[Samsung Group|Samsung]] and [[Rohde &amp; Schwarz]], was shown at the April 2006 show. In 2007, [[Zenith Electronics]], owned by [[LG Group|LG]], came up with 8VSB, which was introduced with [[Harris Corporation|Harris Group]]'s) [[MPH (ATSC)|Mobile-Pedestrian-Handheld (MPH)]] system.

As the broadcast networks began making their content available online, mobile DTV meant stations would have to find another way to compete. [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]] tested A-VSB in the fall of 2006. Their stations [[KVCW]] and [[KSNV|KVMY]] were participating in the mobile DTV [[product demonstration|products demonstrations]] at the NAB show. A-VSB had worked in [[bus]]es at the 2007 [[Consumer Electronics Show]].

[[ION Media Networks]] started a test station on channel 38, which was to be used for digital [[LPTV]], which used a [[single-frequency network|single-frequency network (SFN)]]. In some areas, more than one [[TV transmitter]] would be needed to cover all areas. Mobile DTV could have been used at that time because it would not affect [[HDTV]] reception. A single standard, however, had to be developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/108538-NAB_Mobile_DTV_Hits_the_Strip.php|title=NAB: Mobile DTV Hits the Strip|last=Dickson |first=Glen |date=2007-04-14 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2009, the first [[prototype]] devices from LG and other manufacturers were demonstrated, including receivers for cars from [[Kenwood Corporation|Kenwood]], [[Visteon]] and [[Delphi (auto parts)|Delphi]]. It was announced that 63 stations in 22 markets would debut the service in 2009. [[Gannett Broadcasting]] president David Lougee pointed out that many of those attending the [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|inauguration of Barack Obama]] would likely hear him but not see him; had the new technology been in place, this would not have been a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/161893-CES_Broadcasters_Mobile_DTV_Moment.php?rssid=20102&amp;q=broadcasters+mobile+dtv+moment|title=CES: Broadcasters' Mobile DTV Moment|last=Dickson |first=Glen |date=2009-01-11 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, the [[Open Mobile Video Coalition]], made up of over 800 broadcast stations, selected four test stations: Gannett's [[WATL (TV)|WATL]], ION's [[WPXA-TV]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Fisher Communications|Fisher Communications']] [[KOMO-TV]], and [[Belo]]'s [[KONG-TV]] in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]]. WPXA had begun mobile DTV broadcasting on April 1. The others would begin in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/209447-NAB_2009_Broadcasters_Set_Mobile_DTV_Test_Markets.php?rssid=20068&amp;q=broadcasters+set+mobile+dtv+test+markets|title=NAB 2009: Broadcasters Set Mobile DTV Test Markets|last=Dickson |first=Glen |date=2009-04-20 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2009-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 2009, ION said HDTV, [[Digital terrestrial television|standard definition]] and mobile DTV streams were now available using its affiliates in [[New York City]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] The "triple-play" concept was part of an effort to create a mobile DTV standard. At the time, only those with prototype receivers could pick up the streams.

ION chairman and CEO Brandon Burgess said mobile DTV lets stations "think beyond the living room and bring live television and real time information to consumers wherever they may be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/307120-ION_Broadcasts_Mobile_DTV_in_N_Y_D_C_.php?rssid=20068&amp;q=digital+tv|title=ION Broadcasts Mobile DTV in N.Y., D.C.: Hails Its Digital TV "Triple Play"|last=Dickson |first=Glen |date=2009-06-29 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2009-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Advanced Television Systems Committee started work on mobile DTV standards in May 2007, and manufacturers and sellers worked quickly to make the new technology a reality. The [[OMVC]] persuaded LG and Samsung to work together starting in May 2008 so that differing systems (possibly a self-destructing format war) would not delay or kill the technology.

Early in July 2009, the ATSC Technology and Standards Group approved the [[ATSC-M/H]] standard for mobile DTV which all members green-lighted October 15. The public could be using the new devices by 2010, though watching TV on [[cell phone]]s seemed unlikely in the near future since telephone manufacturers did not yet include that capability. The technology was expected to be used for [[Opinion poll]]s and even voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/307463-Mobile_DTV_is_Almost_Official.php?rssid=20065&amp;q=digital+tv |title=ATSC-M/H voted to proposed standard status |last=Dickson |first=Glen |date=2009-07-06 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=october&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/358341-Mobile_DTV_Standard_Approved.php?rssid=20292&amp;q=digital+tv|title=Mobile DTV Standard Approved|last=Dickson |first=Glen |date=2009-10-16 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the year, the ATSC and the [[Consumer Electronics Association]] began identifying products meeting the standard with "MDTV".&lt;ref name=mdtv&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/440764-ATSC_Launches_Certification_Program_For_Mobile_DTV.php?rssid=20102&amp;q=digital+tv

Paul Karpowicz, NAB Television Board chairman and president of Meredith Broadcast Group, said &lt;blockquote&gt;"This milestone ushers in the new era of digital television broadcasting, giving local TV stations and networks new opportunities to reach viewers on the go. This will introduce the power of local broadcasting to a new generation of viewers and provide all-important emergency alert, local news and other programming to consumers across the nation."&lt;ref name=october/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later in July, the first multi-station tests began in [[Washington, D.C.]], while single stations in [[New York (city)|New York City]] and [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] already offered mobile DTV. The OMVC chose Atlanta's WATL and Seattle's KONG as "model stations" where product testing could take place. Seventy stations in 28 [[media market]]s planned streams by the end of 2009. All of the stations would have two or more channels each, with "[[electronic program guide|electronic service guide]] and alert data" among the services.

Twenty sellers of equipment would use these stations to test using the existing standard, but testing the final standard would come later, and tests by the public would happen in 2010, when many more devices would be ready.  Manufacturing large numbers of the devices could not take place without the final standard. LG, however, began mass-producing chips in June. ION technology vice president Brett Jenkins said, "We're really at a stage like the initial launch of DTV back in 1998. There are almost going to be more transmitters transmitting mobile than receive devices on the market, and that's probably what you'll see for the next six to nine months."&lt;ref name=Special/&gt;

Devices would eventually include [[USB]] dongles, [[netbook]]s, [[Portable DVD Player|portable DVD players]] and in-car displays.&lt;ref name=Special&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/314792-Special_Report_Mobile_DTV_Heats_Up.php |title=Special Report: Mobile DTV Heats Up |last=Dickson |first=Glen |date=2009-07-13 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

White House officials and members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] saw the triple-play concept in an ION demonstration on July 28, 2009 in conjunction with the OMVC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/316065-ION_OMVC_Organize_DTV_Showcase_in_D_C_.php?rssid=20068&amp;q=digital+tv|title=ION, OMVC Organize DTV Showcase in D.C.|last=Dickson |first=Glen |date=2009-07-22 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LIN&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/326796-LIN_TV_Develops_Blackberry_App_For_Mobile_TV_Service.php?q=digital+tv |title=LIN TV Develops Blackberry App For Mobile TV Service|last=Eggerton |first=John |date=2009-08-07 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another demonstration took place October 16, 2009 with journalists, industry executives and broadcasters riding around Washington, D.C. in a bus with prototype devices. Included were those who would be testing the devices in the Washington and Baltimore markets in January 2010.&lt;ref name=tour&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/358415-OMVC_Does_Mobile_DTV_Tour.php?rssid=20103&amp;q=digital+tv |title=OMVC Does Mobile DTV Tour |last=Eggerton |first=John |date=2009-10-16 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2009-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Progress==

{{overly detailed|section|date=April 2014}}
On August 7, 2009, [[BlackBerry]] service began on six TV stations. Eventually 27 other stations are expected to offer the service. By October, 30 stations were airing mobile DTV signals, and that number is expected to grow to 50. Also in the same month, FCC chair Julius Genachowski announced an effort to increase the spectrum available to wireless services.&lt;ref name=october/&gt;
Also in August, [[WTVE]] and [[Axcera]] began testing a [[single-frequency network]] (SFN) with multiple transmitters using the new mobile standard. The [[WRNN-TV|RNN]] affiliate in [[Reading, Pennsylvania]] had used this concept since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/441031-WTVE_Tests_SFN_For_Mobile_DTV.php?rssid=20065&amp;q=digital+tv|title=WTVE Tests SFN For Mobile DTV|last=Dickson |first=Glen |date=2009-12-18 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2010-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Mertz of Cavell, Mertz &amp; Associates says VHF will not work as well for mobile DTV because a 15-inch antenna or some other solution would be required, although he has heard from people who had no problems. An amplified antenna or higher power for the transmitting station would likely be needed, as well as [[Broadcast relay station|repeater stations]] where terrain is a problem.&lt;ref name=Jessell&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/articles/2009/09/24/daily.2/ |title=Digital VHF Needs A Power Boost |last=Jessell|first=Harry A.|work=TVNewsCheck|date=2009-09-24|accessdate=2009-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lougee, whose company planned testing in its 19 markets in 2010, said the [[Computer chip|chip]] designs with the new devices made [[targeted advertising]] possible.&lt;ref name=tour/&gt;

In December 2009, Concept Enterprises introduced the first mobile DTV tuner for automobiles. Unlike earlier units, this one provides a clear picture without pixelation in a fast-moving vehicle, using an LG M/H chip and a one-inch roof-mounted antenna. No subscription is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.twice.com/article/388144-First_Mobile_DTV_Car_Tuner_At_499.php/|title=First Mobile DTV Car Tuner At $499|last=Gilroy|first=Amy|work=[[Twice (magazine)|TWICE]]|date=2009-11-09|accessdate=2009-11-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112153057/http://www.twice.com/article/388144-First_Mobile_DTV_Car_Tuner_At_499.php|archivedate=2009-11-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also in December, the [[Consumer Electronics Association]] hosted a "plugfest" in Washington, D.C. to allow manufacturers to test various devices. More than 15 companies, and engineers from different countries, tested four transmission systems, 12 receiver systems, and four software types.&lt;ref name=mdtv/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/394993-Mobile_DTV_Picks_Up_Speed.php?rssid=20068&amp;q=digital+tv

On December 1, [[News Corp.]] chairman [[Rupert Murdoch]] said mobile DTV would be important to the future of all journalism, and he planned to offer TV and possibly [[newspaper]] content in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/391233-Murdoch_Says_Mobile_TV_Is_Key_to_Future.php?rssid=20070&amp;q=digital+tv|title=Murdoch Says Mobile TV Is Key to Future|last=Eggerton|first=John|date=2009-12-01|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the January 2010 Consumer Electronics Show, NAB head [[Gordon H. Smith]] disputed the idea that broadcasting's days were numbered, calling mobile DTV the proof over-the-air television would continue its popularity. He said people would use cell phones and other devices to watch, and broadcast technology would be the best way to do this. [[Wireless broadband]], which some wanted to replace broadcasting, would not be able to handle the demand for video services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/442953-CES_2010_Broadcasters_Tout_Mobile_DTV_Progress.php?rssid=20068&amp;q=digital+tv|title=CES 2010: Broadcasters Tout Mobile DTV Progress

He also explained to the FCC that mobile DTV was the best method for sending out live video to those using cell phones and similar devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/444575-FCC_s_Bellaria_Says_Broadcasters_Lobbying_Against_Scenario_That_s_No_Longer_On_Table.php?rssid=20103&amp;q=digital+tv

The [[OMVC]]'s Mobile DTV Consumer Showcase began May 3, 2010, and lasted all summer. Nine stations planned to distribute 20 programs, including local and network shows as well as cable programs, to [[Samsung Moment]] phones. [[Dell Netbooks]] and Valups Tivits also received programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mobile DTV's Real-World Test|first=Glen|last=Dickson|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 23, 2010, Media General began its first MDTV service at [[WCMH-TV]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]] and had plans to do the same a month later at [[WFLA-TV]] in the [[Tampa Bay|Tampa Bay, Florida]] area and five to seven more stations in its portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/458539-Media_General_Expands_MDTV_Services.php|title=Media General Expands MDTV Services|first=George|last=Winslow|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=2010-10-18|accessdate=2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 19, 2010, a joint venture of 12 major broadcasters known as the [[Mobile Content Venture|Mobile Content Venture (MCV)]] announced plans to upgrade TV stations in 20 markets representing 40 percent of the United States population to deliver live video to portable devices by the end of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://broadcastengineering.com/eng/omvc-welcomes-mobile-content-venture-plans-upgrade-stations-mobile-video-delivery-20101124/|title=OMVC welcomes Mobile Content Venture plans to upgrade stations for mobile video delivery|last=Kurz|first=Phil|work=[[Broadcast Engineering]]|date=2010-11-22|accessdate=2011-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian Lawlor, a [[E. W. Scripps Company|Scripps TV]] senior vice president said that in September 2011, Scripps stations would offer an [[Mobile apps|mobile app]] allowing people with an [[iPhone]] or [[iPad]] to see emergency information (e.g. weather bulletins) in the event of a power outage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/473636-Broadcaster_of_the_Year_Brian_Lawlor.php |title=Broadcaster of the Year: Brian Lawlor |last=Malone |first=Michael |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |date=2011-09-12 |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, a number of stations plan to conduct tests of the Mobile Emergency Alert System (M-EAS), a system to deliver emergency information via mobile DTV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/480143-PBS_Stations_on_the_Alert_for_Emergency_Systems.php|title=PBS Stations on the Alert For Emergency Systems |last=Winslow |first=George |work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable |date=2012-02-06|accessdate=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, the MCV announced that [[MetroPCS]] would offer MCV's Dyle mobile DTV service. [[Samsung]] planned an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] phone capable of receiving this service late in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/478677-Tech_You_Need_to_See.php |title=Tech You Need to See |last=Winslow |first=George |work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable |date=2012-01-09 |accessdate=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2012, Dyle was in 35 markets and capable of reaching 55 percent of viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/491167-Mobilizing_the_TV_Business_Remains_a_Challenge.php|title=Mobilizing the TV Business Remains a Challenge |last=Winslow |first=George |work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable |date=2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the home page on its website, "As of May 22, 2015, Dyle® mobile TV is no longer in service, and Dyle-enabled devices and their apps will no longer be supported."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dyle.tv|title=Dyle TV|website=Dyle.tv|accessdate=14 May 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012113823/http://www.dyle.tv/|archivedate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the NAB show in April 2012, MCV announced that 17 additional television stations would launch mobile DTV, bringing the total to 92, covering more than 55% of US homes. Included are stations in three new markets: [[Austin, Texas]], [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]], and [[Dayton, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/483472-Mobilizing_for_Mobile_DTV.php |title=Mobilizing for Mobile DTV |last=Winslow |first=George |work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable |date=2012-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, [[WRAL-TV]] announced rollout of a [[Mobile Emergency Alert System]] based around mobile digital television technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvtechnology.com/news/0086/wral-tv-to-demo-mobile-eas/215408 TVTechnology: WRAL-TV to Demo Mobile EAS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A OTT technology platform called [[Syncbak]] enables smart phones and tablets rather than TV spectrum. Syncbak has been deployed across the United States at 55 major station groups, including FOX and CBS affiliates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Syncbak Makes Its Case for Mobile|last=Winslow |first=George |work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable |date=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 2013, 130 stations were providing content, but adoption of devices such as [[dongle]]s was not widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/news/broadcasters-worry-zero-tv-homes-154357101--finance.html|title=Broadcasters worry about 'Zero TV' homes|last=Nakashima|first=Ryan|work=[[Associated Press]]|date=2013-04-07|accessdate=2013-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While traditional pay TV operators and broadcast networks still dominate the consumer television landscape, new options are emerging, from subscription video on demand (SVOD), to electronic sell-through (EST), to free TV streaming. While SVOD drives the most online TV streams by far, the incidence of consumers who used SVOD and free streaming in 2012 was relatively equal. According to NPD’s “Free Streaming TV” report, released in February 2013, 12 percent of United States TV watchers reported streaming TV shows for free during the prior three months, compared to 14 percent who watched a TV show via SVOD.&lt;ref&gt;Free Streaming Making Inroads with Traditional Television Consumers from The [[NPD Group]]: https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/the-npd-group-free-streaming-making-inroads-with-traditional-television-consumers/&lt;/ref&gt;

"Over half of the viewers for streaming TV are between the ages of 18 and 34, so the YouTube generation is evolving from short-form and user-generated content to TV shows and, like YouTube, they can watch where and when they want," said Russ Crupnick, senior vice president of industry analysis at NPD. "Despite the attention lavished on tablets and phones, an astonishing 83 percent of free TV streaming programs are viewed on a computer."

Like [[Hagen-Poiseuille Law]] and [[Fick's Law]], which were also formulated from a biological context, Murray’s law is a basic physical principle for transfer networks.&lt;ref name="sherman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mcculloh" /&gt;

Murray's law is also a powerful [[biomimetics]] design tool in engineering. It has been applied in the design of [[self-healing material]]s, [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], [[photocatalysts]], and [[gas sensors]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} However, since its discovery, little attention has been paid to exploit this law for designing advanced materials, reactors and industrial processes for maximizing mass or energy transfer to improve material performance and process efficiency.&lt;ref name="williams" /&gt;

== Murray's law in mass-conservative networks ==

Murray's original analysis&lt;ref name="murray1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murray|first=Cecil D.|year=1926|title=The Physiological Principle of Minimum Work: I. The Vascular System and the Cost of Blood Volume|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=12|issue=3|pages=207–214|doi=10.1073/pnas.12.3.207|pmc=1084489|pmid=16576980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="murray2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murray|first=Cecil D.|year=1926|title=The Physiological Principle of Minimum Work: II.

Larger vessels lower the expended energy for transport, but increase the overall volume of blood in the system; blood being a living fluid and hence requiring metabolic support. Murray's law is therefore an optimisation exercise to balance these factors.

For &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; child branches splitting from a common parent branch, the law states that:

&lt;math&gt;r^3 = r_1^3 + r_2^3 + r_3^3 +...+ r_n^3&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the parent branch, and &lt;math&gt;r_1, \ldots, r_n&lt;/math&gt; are the radii of the child branches. This law is only valid for [[laminar flow]], since its derivation uses the [[Hagen-Poiseuille equation]] as a measure for the transport work (see below). Williams et al. deduced the formula for [[turbulent flow]]:&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Hugo R.|year=2008|title=Minimum mass vascular networks in multifunctional materials|url=http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/5/18/55.full|journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface|volume=5|issue=18|pages=55–65|doi=10.1098/rsif.2007.1022|pmc=2605499|pmid=17426011|author2=Trask, Richard S.|author3=Weaver, Paul M.|author4=Bond, Ian P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;r^{(7/3)} = r_1^{(7/3)} + r_2^{(7/3)} + r_3^{(7/3)} + ... + r_n^{(7/3)} &lt;/math&gt;

=== Derivation ===

As stated above, the underlying assumption of the Murray's law is that the [[Power (physics)|power]] ([[energy (physics)|energy]] per [[time]]) for transport and upkeep is minimal in a natural transport system. Hence we seek to minimize &lt;math&gt;P = P_t + P_m&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;P_t&lt;/math&gt; is the power required for transport and &lt;math&gt;P_m&lt;/math&gt; the power required to maintain the transport medium (e.g. blood).

==== Laminar Flow ====

We first minimize the power of transport and upkeep in a single channel of the system, i.e. ignore bifurcations. Together with the assumption of mass-conservation this will yield the law. Let &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; be the [[laminar flow|laminar]] [[volumetric flow rate|flow rate]] in this channel, which is assumed to be fixed. The power for transport in a laminar flow is &lt;math&gt;P_t = Q \Delta p&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Delta p&lt;/math&gt; is the pressure difference between the entry and exit of a tube of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;. The [[Hagen-Poiseuille Law]] for laminar flow states that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Q = \frac{\pi\,r^4}{8\,\mu\,l}\Delta p&lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\Delta p = \frac{8\,\mu\,l}{\pi\,r^4} Q&lt;/math&gt; , where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[dynamic viscosity]] of the fluid. Substituting this into the equation for &lt;math&gt;P_t&lt;/math&gt;, we get&lt;math display="block"&gt;P_t = \frac{8\,\mu\,l}{\pi\,r^4} Q^2.&lt;/math&gt;We furthermore make the assumption that the power necessary for maintenance is proportional to the [[Volume#Volume formulas|volume of the cylinder]] &lt;math&gt;V = \pi\,l\,r^2&lt;/math&gt; :&lt;math display="block"&gt;P_m = \lambda\,V = \lambda\,\pi\,l\,r^2&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;\lambda &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; is a constant number (metabolic factor). This yields&lt;math display="block"&gt;P = P_t + P_m = \frac{8\,\mu\,l}{\pi\,r^4} Q^2 + \lambda\,\pi\,l\,r^2. &lt;/math&gt;Since we seek the radius with minimal power, we calculate the [[stationary point]] with respect to r &lt;math display="block"&gt;{\operatorname{d}\over\operatorname{d}\!r} P = 0 \;\Leftrightarrow\; - \frac{32\,\mu\,l}{\pi\,r^5} Q^2 + 2\,\lambda\,\pi\,l\,r = 0 \;\Leftrightarrow\; Q^2 = \frac{\pi^2}{16} \frac{\lambda}{\mu} r^6 \;\Leftarrow\; Q = \frac{\pi}{4} \sqrt{\frac{\lambda}{\mu}} r^3. &lt;/math&gt;With this relationship between the flow rate &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; and radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; on an arbitrary channel, we return to the bifurcation: Since mass is conserved, the flow rate of the parent branch &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of the flow rates in the children branches &lt;math&gt;Q_1, \ldots, Q_n&lt;/math&gt;. Since in each of these branches the power is minimized, the relationship above holds and hence, as claimed:&lt;math display="block"&gt; Q = \sum_{i=1}^N Q_i \;\Rightarrow\; \frac{\pi}{4} \sqrt{\frac{\lambda}{\mu}} \, r^3 = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\pi}{4} \sqrt{\frac{\lambda}{\mu}}\, r_i^3 \; \Rightarrow\; r^3 = \sum_{i=1}^N  r_i^3.&lt;/math&gt;

==== Diffusion ====

The power for transport spent by diffusion is given by

&lt;math&gt;P_t = Q\,\Delta C = \left( \pi\,D\,r^2 \frac{\Delta C}{l}\right) \Delta C&lt;/math&gt;

where the flow rate is given by Fick's Law, whose &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the diffusivity constant and &lt;math&gt;\Delta C&lt;/math&gt; is the difference of concentration between the ends of the cylinder. Similarly to the case of laminar flow, the minimisation of the objective function results in

&lt;math&gt; \frac{\Delta C}{l} = \sqrt{\frac{\lambda}{D}} \Rightarrow Q = \pi\,D\,r^2 \sqrt{\frac{\lambda}{D}} \Leftrightarrow Q = k\,r^2&lt;/math&gt;

Hence,

&lt;math&gt; Q_p = \sum_{i=1}^N Q_i \Rightarrow k\, r_p^2 = \sum_{i=1}^N k\, r_i^2 \Leftrightarrow r_p^2 = \sum_{i=1}^N  r_i^2&lt;/math&gt;

== The generalized Murray’s law ==

However, the special Murray’s law is only applicable to flow processes involving no mass variations. Significant theoretical advances need to be made for more broadly applicable in the fields of chemistry, applied materials, and industrial reactions.

For connecting a parent pipe with radius of '''''r&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''''' to many children pipes with radius of '''''r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''''' , the formula of generalized Murray's law is: &lt;math&gt;r_o^a={1 \over 1-X}\sum_{i=1}^Nr_i^a&lt;/math&gt;, where the '''''X''''' is the ratio of mass variation during mass transfer in the parent pore, the exponent '''''α''''' is dependent on the type of the transfer. For laminar flow ''α'' =3; for turbulent flow ''α'' =7/3; for molecule or ionic diffusion ''α'' =2; etc.

== Murray materials ==

The generalized Murray’s law defines the basic geometric features for porous materials with optimum transfer properties. The generalized Murray’s law can be used to design and optimize the structures of an enormous range of porous materials. This concept has led to materials, termed as the [https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14921 '''Murray materials'''], whose pore-sizes are multiscale and are designed with diameter-ratios obeying the generalized Murray’s law.&lt;ref name="Zheng2017" /&gt;

To achieve substances or energy transfer with extremely high efficiency, evolution by natural selection has endowed many classes of organisms with Murray materials, in which the pore-sizes regularly decrease across multiple scales and finally terminate in size-invariant units. For example, in [[plant stem]]s and [[Leaf|leaf veins]], the sum of the radii cubed remains constant across every branch point to maximize the flow conductance, which is proportional to the rate of photosynthesis. For [[insect]]s relying upon gas diffusion for breathing, the sum of radii squared of tracheal pores remains constant along the diffusion pathway, to maximize gases diffusion. From plants, animals and materials to industrial processes, [https://uk.news.yahoo.com/leaf-vein-structure-might-help-114254703.html the introduction of Murray material concept to industrial reactions can revolutionize the design of reactors with highly enhanced efficiency, minimum energy, time, and raw material consumption for a sustainable future.]

London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The name is based on the historical legacy of the English [[Luddite]]s, who were active between 1811 and 1816.&lt;ref name="jonesagainstechnology"/&gt;

Neo-Luddism is a leaderless movement of non-affiliated groups who resist modern technologies and dictate a return of some or all technologies to a more primitive level.&lt;ref name = Sale&gt;Sale, Kirkpatrick, America’s new Luddites. URL=http://mondediplo.com/1997/02/20luddites&lt;/ref&gt; Neo-Luddites are characterized by one or more of the following practices: passively abandoning the use of technology, harming those who produce technology, advocating [[simple living]], or [[monkeywrenching|sabotaging]] technology. The modern neo-Luddite movement has connections with the [[anti-globalization movement]], [[antiscience|anti-science movement]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], [[radical environmentalism]], and [[deep ecology]].&lt;ref name = Sale /&gt;

Neo-Luddism is based on the concern of the technological impact on individuals, their communities, and/or the environment,&lt;ref name=christensenencyclopedia&gt;{{cite book  | last = Christensen  | first = Karen  |author2=David Levinson  | title = Encyclopedia of community: from the village to the virtual world, Volume 3  | publisher = SAGE  | year = 2003  | location =   | pages = 886  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=t1geOjQ6R0MC&amp;dq=Neo-Luddism| isbn = 978-0-7619-2598-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neo-Luddism stipulates the use of the [[precautionary principle]] for all new technologies, insisting that technologies be proven safe before adoption, due to the unknown effects that new technologies might inspire.

==Philosophy==
Neo-Luddism  calls for slowing or stopping the development of new technologies. Neo-Luddism prescribes a lifestyle that abandons specific technologies, because of its belief that this is the best prospect for the future. As Robin and Webster put it, "a return to nature and what are imagined as more natural communities." In the place of industrial capitalism, neo-Luddism prescribes small-scale agricultural communities such as those of the Amish and the [[Chipko movement]] in Nepal and India&lt;ref name="Basney" /&gt; as models for the future.

Neo-Luddism denies the ability of any new technology to solve current problems, such as [[environmental degradation]],&lt;ref name="Basney" /&gt; [[nuclear warfare]] and [[biological weapons]], without creating more, potentially dangerous problems.&lt;ref name=grahaminternet&gt;{{cite book  | last = Graham  | first = Gordon  | title = The Internet: a philosophical inquiry  | publisher = Routledge  | year = 1999  | location =   | page = 9  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NDr8Fh4rNQAC&amp;dq=Neo-Luddism| isbn = 978-0-415-19749-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011).

In 1990, attempting to reclaim the term 'Luddite' and found a unified movement, [[Chellis Glendinning]] published her "Notes towards a Neo-Luddite manifesto". In this paper, Glendinning describes neo-Luddites as "20th century citizens—activists, workers, neighbors, social critics, and scholars—who question the predominant modern worldview, which preaches that unbridled technology represents [[Idea of Progress|progress]]."&lt;ref name="GlendinningChellis"&gt;[[Chellis Glendinning|Glendinning, Chellis]]. ''[https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/chellis-glendinning-notes-toward-a-neo-luddite-manifesto Notes towards a Neo-Luddite manifesto]''. Utne Reader, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Glendinning voices an opposition to technologies that she deems destructive to communities or are materialistic and rationalistic. She proposes that technology encourages biases, and therefore should question if technologies have been created for specific interests, to perpetuate their specific values including short-term efficiency, ease of production and marketing, as well as profit. Glendinning also says that secondary aspects of technology, including social, economic and ecological implications, and not personal benefit need to be considered before adoption of technology into the technological system.&lt;ref name="GlendinningChellis" /&gt;

===Vision of the future without intervention===
Neo-Luddism often establishes stark predictions about the effect of new technologies. 
Although there is not a cohesive vision of the ramifications of technology, neo-Luddism predicts that a future without technological reform has dire consequences. Neo-Luddites believe that current technologies are a threat to humanity and to the natural world in general, and that a future [[societal collapse]] is possible or even probable. 

Neo-Luddite [[Ted Kaczynski]] predicted a world with a depleted environment, an increase in [[Causes of schizophrenia#Urbanicity|psychological disorders]], with either "leftists" who aim to control humanity through technology, or technology directly controlling humanity.&lt;ref name="Kaczynski" /&gt; According to Sale, "The industrial civilization so well served by its potent technologies cannot last, and will not last; its collapse is certain within not more than a few decades.".&lt;ref name="jour" /&gt; [[Stephen Hawking]], a famous astrophysicist, predicted that the means of production will be controlled by the "machine owner" class and that without redistribution of wealth, technology will create more economic inequality.&lt;ref name=HuffPo&gt;Stephen Hawking Says We Should Really, 2016 | http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stephen-hawking-capitalism-robots_us_5616c20ce4b0dbb8000d9f15&lt;/ref&gt;

These predictions include changes in humanity's place in the future due to replacement of humans by computers, genetic decay of humans due to lack of natural selection, biological engineering of humans, misuse of technological power including disasters caused by [[genetically modified organism]]s, [[nuclear warfare]], and [[biological weapons]]; control of humanity using surveillance, propaganda, pharmacological control, and psychological control; humanity failing to adapt to the future manifesting as an increase in psychological disorders, widening economic and political [[Economic inequality|inequality]], widespread [[social alienation]], a loss of community, and massive [[unemployment]]; technology causing [[environmental degradation]] due to shortsightedness, overpopulation, and overcrowding.&lt;ref name="Basney" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Theodore J. Kaczynski, David Skrbina; ''Technological Slavery, The Collected Writings of Theodore J. Kaczynski, a.k.a. "The Unabomber."''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of intervention===
In 1990, attempting to reclaim the term 'Luddite' and found a unified movement, [[Chellis Glendinning]] published her "Notes towards a Neo-Luddite manifesto". In this paper, Glendinning proposes destroying the following technologies: electromagnetic technologies (this includes communications, computers, appliances, and refrigeration), chemical technologies (this includes synthetic materials and medicine), [[Nuclear technology|nuclear technologies]] (this includes weapons and power as well as cancer treatment, sterilization, and smoke detection), [[genetic engineering]] (this includes crops as well as insulin production).&lt;ref name="GlendinningChellis" /&gt; She argues in favor of the "search for new technological forms" which are local in scale and promote social and political freedom.

[[File:Young theodore kaczynski.jpeg|thumb|Kaczynski as a young professor at [[University of California, Berkeley|U.C. Berkeley]], 1968|alt=A man in a suit faces the camera while he stands in front of a building.]]
In "The coming revolution", Kaczynski outlined what he saw as changes humanity will have to make in order to make society functional, "new values that will free them from the yoke of the present technoindustrial system", including:
* Rejection of all modern technology  –  "This is logically necessary, because modern technology is a whole in which all parts are interconnected; you can’t get rid of the bad parts without also giving up those parts that seem good."
* Rejection of civilization itself
* Rejection of [[Economic materialism|materialism]] and its replacement with a conception of life that values moderation and self-sufficiency while deprecating the acquisition of property or of status.
* Love and reverence toward nature or even worship of nature
* Exaltation of freedom
* Punishment of those responsible for the present situation. "Scientists, engineers, corporation executives, politicians, and so forth to make the cost of improving technology too great for anyone to try"

==Movement==
Contemporary neo-Luddites are a widely diverse group of loosely affiliated or non-affiliated groups which includes "writers, academics, students, families, [[Amish]], [[Mennonites]], [[Quakers]], [[environmentalists]], "fallen-away [[yuppies]]," "ageing [[flower children]]" and "young idealists seeking a technology-free environment."&lt;ref name="jour"&gt;Doresa Banning, Modern Day Luddites, November 30, 2001, URL=http://www.jour.unr.edu/j705/RP.BANNING.LUDDITE.HTML&lt;/ref&gt; Some Luddites see themselves as victims of technology trying to prevent further victimization (such as Citizens Against Pesticide Misuse and Parents Against Underage Smartphones). Others see themselves as advocates for the natural order and resist environmental degradation by technology (such as [[Earth First!]]).&lt;ref name="jour" /&gt;

One neo-Luddite assembly was the "Second Neo-Luddite Congress", held April 13–15, 1996, at a Quaker meeting hall in [[Barnesville, Ohio]]. On February 24, 2001, the "Teach-In on Technology and Globalization" was held at [[Hunter College]] in New York city with the purpose to bring together critics of technology and globalization.&lt;ref name="jour" /&gt; The two figures who are seen as the movement's founders are [[Chellis Glendinning]] and [[Kirkpatrick Sale]].

In May 2012, credit for the shooting of Roberto Adinolfi, an [[Ansaldo Nucleare]] executive, was claimed by an [[anarchist]] group who targeted him for stating that none of the deaths following the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] were caused by the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] itself: &lt;blockquote&gt;Adinolfi knows well that it is only a matter of time before a European Fukushima kills on our continent [...] Science in centuries past promised us a golden age, but it is pushing us towards self destruction and slavery [...] With our action we give back to you a small part of the suffering that you scientists are bringing to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Italian anarchists kneecap nuclear executive and threaten more shootings |author=Tom Kington |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/11/italian-anarchists-kneecap-nuclear-executive |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=11 May 2012 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kaczynski, also known as the ''Unabomber'', initially sabotaged developments near his cabin but dedicated himself to getting back at the system after discovering a road had been built over a plateau he had considered beautiful. Between 1978 and 1995, Kaczynski engaged in a nationwide bombing campaign against modern technology, planting or mailing numerous home-made bombs, killing three people and injuring 23 others. In his 1995 manifesto, ''Industrial Society and Its Future'',&lt;ref name="Kaczynski" /&gt; Kaczynski states: &lt;blockquote&gt;The kind of revolution we have in mind will not necessarily involve an armed uprising against any government. It may or may not involve physical violence, but it will not be a POLITICAL revolution. Its focus will be on technology and economics, not politics.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In August 2011 in [[Mexico]] a group or person calling itself [[Individuals Tending Towards the Wild]] perpetrated an attack with a bomb at the [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, State of Mexico Campus]], intended for the coordinator of its Business Development Center and Technology Transfer. The attack was accompanied by the publication of a [[manifesto]] criticizing [[nanotechnology]] and [[computer science]].

Sale says that neo-Luddites are not motivated to commit violence or vandalism.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with the Luddite, Wired magazine, Issue 3.06, Jun 1995. URL=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.06/saleskelly.html&lt;/ref&gt; The manifesto of the 'Second Luddite Congress', which Sale took a major part in defining, attempts to redefine neo-Luddites as people who reject violent action.&lt;ref name="jour" /&gt;

==History==
===Origins of contemporary critiques of technology in literature===
According to Julian Young, [[Martin Heidegger]] was a Luddite in his early philosophical phase and believed in the destruction of modern technology and a return to an earlier agrarian world.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Julian. ''Heidegger's Later Philosophy'', p. 80. Cambridge University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Martin Heidegger#Later works: The Turn|later Heidegger]] did not see technology as wholly negative and did not call for its abandonment or destruction.&lt;ref name=Wheeler /&gt; In ''The Question Concerning Technology'' (1953), Heidegger posited that the modern technological "mode of Being" was one which viewed the natural world, plants, animals, and even human beings as a "standing-reserve"—resources to be exploited as means to an end.&lt;ref name=Wheeler&gt;Wheeler, Michael, "Martin Heidegger", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2013 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2013/entries/heidegger/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate this "monstrousness", Heidegger uses the example of a [[hydroelectric plant]] on the [[Rhine river]] which turns the river from an unspoiled natural wonder to just a supplier of [[hydropower]]. In this sense, technology is not just the collection of tools, but a way of being in the world and of understanding the world which is instrumental and grotesque. According to Heidegger, this way of being defines the modern way of living in the West.&lt;ref name=Wheeler /&gt; For Heidegger, this technological process ends up reducing beings to not-beings, which Heidegger calls 'the abandonment of being' and involves the loss of any sense of awe and wonder, as well as an indifference to that loss.&lt;ref name=Wheeler /&gt;

One of the first major contemporary anti-technological thinkers was French philosopher [[Jacques Ellul]]. In his ''The Technological Society'' (1964), Ellul argued that the rationality of technology enforces logical and mechanical organization which "eliminates or subordinates the natural world." Ellul defined ''technique'' as the entire totality of organizational methods and technology with a goal toward maximum rational efficiency. According to Ellul, technique has an impetus which tends to drown out human concerns: "The only thing that matters technically is yield, production. This is the law of ''technique''; this yield can only be obtained by the total mobilization of human beings, body and soul, and this implies the exploitation of all human psychic forces."&lt;ref&gt;Ellul, ''The Technological Society'' p. 324&lt;/ref&gt; Another critic of political and technological expansion was [[Lewis Mumford]], who wrote ''[[The Myth of the Machine]]''. The views of Ellul influenced the ideas of the infamous American neo-Luddite Kaczynski. The opening of Kaczynski's manifesto reads: "The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race."&lt;ref name=Kaczynski&gt;[[The Washington Post]]: Unabomber Special Report: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/unabomber/manifesto.text.htm Industrial Society and Its Future by Theodore Kaczynski]&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[philosophy of technology|philosophers of technology]] who have questioned the validity of technological progress include [[Albert Borgmann]], [[Don Ihde]] and [[Hubert Dreyfus]].&lt;ref name=Basney&gt;Basney, Lionel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33855">'''Nitrogen fixation''' is a process by which [[nitrogen]] in the [[Earth's atmosphere]] is converted into [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) or related nitrogenous compounds.&lt;ref name=postgate&gt;{{cite book |last=Postgate|first= J. |year=1998 |title= Nitrogen Fixation|edition= 3rd |publisher=Cambridge University Press|location= Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Atmospheric nitrogen, which is molecular dinitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), is relatively nonreactive and is metabolically useless to all but a few microorganisms.  The fixation process converts N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into ammonia, which is metabolized by most organisms.

Nitrogen fixation is essential to life because fixed inorganic nitrogen compounds are required for the [[biosynthesis]] of all nitrogen-containing compounds. Therefore, as part of the [[nitrogen cycle]], it is essential for [[agriculture]] and the manufacture of [[fertilizer]]. It is also, indirectly, relevant to the manufacture of all chemical compounds that contain nitrogen, which includes explosives, most pharmaceuticals, and dyes.  Nitrogen fixation is carried out naturally in the [[soil]] by a wide range of nitrogen fixing [[Bacteria]] and [[Archaea]], including ''[[Azotobacter]]''. Some nitrogen-fixing bacteria have [[symbiotic]] relationships with some [[plant]] groups, especially [[legume]]s.  Looser relationships between nitrogen-fixing bacteria and plants are often referred to as associative or non-symbiotic, as seen in nitrogen fixation occurring on [[rice]] roots. It also occurs naturally in the air by means of [[NOx]] production by [[lightning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Slosson|first=Edwin|title=Creative Chemistry|year=1919|publisher=The Century Co.|location=New York, NY|pages=19–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=R.

All biological nitrogen fixation is effected by enzymes called [[nitrogenase]]s. These enzymes contain [[iron]], often with a second metal, usually [[molybdenum]] but sometimes [[vanadium]].  Microorganisms that can fix nitrogen are [[prokaryotes]] (both [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]], distributed throughout their respective domains) called [[diazotroph]]s. Some higher plants, and some animals ([[termite]]s), have formed associations ([[symbiosis]]) with diazotrophs.

==Non-biological natural nitrogen fixation==
[[File:Lightning Pritzerbe 01 (MK).jpg|thumb|Lightning heats up the air around it breaking the bonds of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; starting the formation of nitrous acid.]]
Nitrogen can be fixed by [[lightning]] converting nitrogen and oxygen into [[NOx]] (nitrogen oxides). NOx may react with water to make [[nitrous acid]] or [[nitric acid]], which seeps into the soil, where it makes [[nitrate]], which is of use to growing plants. Nitrogen in the atmosphere is highly stable and nonreactive due to there being a [[triple bond]] between atoms in the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tuck|first=A.

Nitrogenases are rapidly degraded by oxygen. For this reason, many bacteria cease production of the enzyme in the presence of oxygen. Many nitrogen-fixing organisms exist only in [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] conditions, respiring to draw down oxygen levels, or binding the oxygen with a protein such as [[leghemoglobin]].&lt;ref name=postgate/&gt;

===Microorganisms that fix nitrogen===
{{main|Diazotroph}}
Diazotrophs are widespread within domain [[Bacteria]] including [[cyanobacteria]] (e.g. the highly significant ''[[Trichodesmium]]'' and ''[[Cyanothece]]''), as well as [[green sulfur bacteria]], [[Azotobacteraceae]], [[rhizobia]] and ''[[Frankia]]''. Several obligately anaerobic bacteria fix nitrogen including many  (but not all) [[Clostridium]] spp. Some [[Archaea]] also fix nitrogen, including several [[methanogen]]ic taxa, which are significant contributors to nitrogen fixation in anoxic soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bae|first=Hee-Sung|last2=Morrison|first2=Elise|last3=Chanton|first3=Jeffrey P.|last4=Ogram|first4=Andrew|date=2018-04-01|title=Methanogens Are Major Contributors to Nitrogen Fixation in Soils of the Florida Everglades | journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology|language=en|volume=84|issue=7|pages=e02222–17|doi=10.1128/AEM.02222-17 |pmc=5861825|pmid=29374038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cyanobacteria]] inhabit nearly all illuminated environments on Earth and play key roles in the carbon and [[nitrogen cycle]] of the [[biosphere]]. In general, [[cyanobacteria]] can use various inorganic and organic sources of combined nitrogen, like [[nitrate]], [[nitrite]], [[ammonium]], [[urea]], or some [[amino acid]]s. Several cyanobacterial strains are also capable of [[diazotroph]]ic growth, an ability that may have been present in their last common ancestor in the [[Archean]] eon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Latysheva | first1 = N. | last2 = Junker | first2 = V.

The colonial marine cyanobacterium ''[[Trichodesmium]]'' is thought to fix nitrogen on such a scale that it accounts for almost half of the nitrogen fixation in marine systems globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bergman|first1= B.|last2= Sandh|first2= G.|last3= Lin|first3= S.|last4= Larsson|first4= H.|last5= Carpenter|first5= E.

===Root nodule symbioses===
====The Legume family====
Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include those of the [[legume]] family&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; [[Fabaceae]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; with taxa such as [[kudzu]], [[clover]]s, [[soybean]]s, [[alfalfa]], [[lupin]]es, [[peanut]]s, and [[rooibos]]. They contain [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] bacteria called [[rhizobia]] within [[root nodule|nodules]] in their [[root|root systems]], producing nitrogen compounds that help the plant to grow and compete with other plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the plant dies, the fixed nitrogen is released, making it available to other plants; this helps to fertilize the [[soil]].&lt;ref name=postgate/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Smil|first=Vaclav |year=2000 |title=Cycles of Life |publisher=Scientific American Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; The great majority of legumes have this association, but a few genera (e.g., ''[[Styphnolobium]]'') do not. In many traditional and organic farming practices, fields are rotated through various types of crops, which usually include one consisting mainly or entirely of [[clover]] or [[buckwheat]] (non-legume family [[Polygonaceae]]), often referred to as "[[green manure]]".&lt;ref&gt;By who?&lt;/ref&gt;

The efficiency of nitrogen fixation in soil is dependent on many factors, including the legume as well as air and soil conditions. For example, nitrogen fixation by red clover can range from 50 - 200&amp;nbsp;lb./acre depending on these variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.foragebeef.ca/$Foragebeef/frgebeef.nsf/all/frg90/$FILE/fertilitylegumefixation.pdf|title=Nitrogen Fixation and Inoculation of Forage Legumes|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:A sectioned alder root nodule gall.JPG|right|thumb|A sectioned alder tree root nodule]]

Although by far the majority of plant species able to form nitrogen-fixing root nodules are in the legume family [[Fabaceae]], there are exceptions:

* ''Parasponia'', a tropical genus in the [[Cannabaceae]] also able to interact with rhizobia and form nitrogen-fixing nodules&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Rik |last=Op den Camp |title=LysM-Type Mycorrhizal Receptor Recruited for Rhizobium Symbiosis in Nonlegume ''Parasponia'' |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=331 |issue=6019 |pages=909–912 |doi=10.1126/science.1198181 |year=2010 |first2=A. |last3=De Mita |first3=S. |last4=Cao |first4=Q. |last5=Polone |first5=E. |last6=Liu |first6=W. |last7=Ammiraju |first7=J.

* [[Actinorhizal plant]]s such as [[alder]] and [[bayberry]] can also form nitrogen-fixing nodules, thanks to a symbiotic association with ''[[Frankia]]'' bacteria.

The ability to fix nitrogen is present in the families listed below. They belong to the [[order (biology)|order]]s [[Cucurbitales]], [[Fagales]], and [[Rosales]], which together with the [[Fabales]] form a clade of [[eurosid]]s. The ability to fix nitrogen is not universally present in these families. For example, of 122 genera in the [[Rosaceae]], only 4 genera are capable of fixing nitrogen. Fabales were the first lineage to branch off this nitrogen-fixing clade; thus, the ability to fix nitrogen may be [[plesiomorphic]] and subsequently lost in most descendants of the original nitrogen-fixing plant; however, it may be that the basic [[genetics|genetic]] and [[physiological]] requirements were present in an incipient state in the [[most recent common ancestor]]s of all these plants, but only evolved to full function in some of them.

==Industrial nitrogen fixation==

The possibility that atmospheric nitrogen reacts with certain chemicals was first observed by [[Desfosses]] in 1828. He observed that mixtures of [[alkali metal]] oxides and carbon react at high temperatures with nitrogen. With the use of [[barium carbonate]] as starting material the first commercially used process became available in the 1860s developed by Margueritte and Sourdeval. The resulting [[barium cyanide]] could be reacted with steam yielding [[ammonia]]. In 1898 [[Adolph Frank]] and [[Nikodem Caro]] decoupled the process and first produced  [[calcium carbide]] and in a subsequent step reacted it with nitrogen to [[calcium cyanamide]]. The [[Ostwald process]] for the production of [[nitric acid]] was discovered in 1902. [[Frank-Caro process]] and Ostwald process dominated the industrial fixation of nitrogen until the discovery of the [[Haber process]] in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Die Umwandlungsgleichung Ba(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → BaCN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + C im Temperaturgebiet von 500 bis 1000&amp;nbsp;°C | trans-title = The conversion reaction Ba(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → BaCN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + C in the temperature range from 500 to 1,000&amp;nbsp;°C | first1 = H. | last1 = Heinrich | first2 = Rolf | last2= Nevbner  | journal = Z.

Prior to 1900, [[Nikola Tesla]] also experimented with the industrial fixation of nitrogen "by using currents of extremely high frequency or rate of vibration".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/1900-06-00.htm|title="The Problem of Increasing Human Energy" by Nikola Tesla|publisher=|accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Haber process===

[[File:THC 2003.902.022 D. C. Bardwell Study of Nitrogen Fixation.tif|thumb|right|Equipment for a study of nitrogen fixation by [[alpha ray]]s (Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory, 1926)]]
Artificial fertilizer production is now the largest source of human-produced fixed nitrogen in the [[Earth]]'s [[ecosystem]].  Ammonia is a required precursor to [[fertilizer]]s, [[explosive]]s, and other products. The most common method is the [[Haber process]]. The Haber process requires high pressures (around 200&amp;nbsp;atm) and high temperatures (at least 400&amp;nbsp;°C), routine conditions for industrial catalysis. This highly efficient process uses natural gas as a hydrogen source and air as a nitrogen source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cfpub.epa.gov/watertrain/pdf/issue1.pdf |publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|title=Human Alteration of the Global Nitrogen Cycle: Causes and Consequences |first1=Peter M. |last1=Vitousek |first2=John |last2=Aber|first3=Robert W. |last3=Howarth|first4= Gene E. |last4=Likens|first5= Pamela A. |last5=Matson|first6= David W. |last6=Schindler|first7= William H. |last7=Schlesinger|first8= G. David|last8= Tilman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much research has been conducted on the discovery of catalysts for nitrogen fixation, often with the goal of reducing the energy required for this conversion. However, such research has thus far failed to even approach the efficiency and ease of the Haber process. Many compounds react with atmospheric nitrogen to give [[dinitrogen complex]]es. The first dinitrogen [[Complex (chemistry)|complex]] to be reported was [[pentaamine(dinitrogen)ruthenium(II) chloride|Ru(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Ambient nitrogen reduction ===
Catalytic chemical nitrogen fixation  at ambient conditions is an ongoing scientific endeavor.  Guided by the example of nitrogenase, this area of homogeneous catalysis is ongoing, with particular emphasis on hydrogenation to give ammonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schrock | first1 = Richard R. | year = 2006 | title = Reduction of dinitrogen | journal = PNAS | volume = 103 | issue = 46| page = 17087 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0603633103 | pmc = 1859893 | pmid = 17088548 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/103/46/17087.full.pdf| bibcode = 2006PNAS..10317087S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metallic [[lithium]] has long been known for burning in an atmosphere of nitrogen and then converting to [[lithium nitride]]. Hydrolysis of the resulting nitride gives ammonia. In a related process, [[trimethylsilyl chloride]], lithium, and nitrogen react in the presence of a catalyst to give [[tris(trimethylsilyl)amine]]. Tris(trimethylsilyl)amine can then be used for reaction with α,δ,ω-tri[[ketone]]s to give tricyclic [[pyrrole]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brook|first=Michael A.|title=Silicon in Organic, Organometallic, and Polymer Chemistry|year=2000|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|location=New York|pages=193–194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Processes involving [[lithium]] metal are however of no practical interest since they are non-catalytic and re-reducing the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion residue is difficult.

Beginning in the 1960s several homogeneous systems were identified that convert nitrogen to ammonia, sometimes even catalytically but often operating via ill-defined mechanisms. The original discovery is described in an early review:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Vol'pin and co-workers, using a non-protic Lewis acid, aluminium tribromide, were able to demonstrate the truly catalytic effect of titanium by treating dinitrogen with a mixture of titanium tetrachloride, metallic aluminium, and aluminium tribromide at 50&amp;nbsp;°C, either in the absence or in the presence of a solvent, e.g. benzene. As much as 200&amp;nbsp;mol of ammonia per mol of TiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; was obtained after hydrolysis.…"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chatt|first=J.|last2=Leigh|first2=G. J.|title=Nitrogen Fixation|journal=Chem. Soc. Rev.|date=1972|volume=1|page=121|doi=10.1039/cs9720100121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:NitrogenReduction.png|Synthetic nitrogen reduction&lt;ref name=Yandulov/&gt;|thumb|400px|right]]
The quest for well defined intermediates led to the characterization of many [[transition metal dinitrogen complex]]es.  Few of these well-defined complexes function catalytically, their behavior illuminated likely stages in nitrogen fixation.  Fruitful early studies focused on M(N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;([[dppe]])&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (M = Mo, W), which protonates to give intermediates with ligand M=N−NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In 1995, a molybdenum(III) amido complex was discovered that cleaved N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to give the corresponding molybdenum(VI) nitride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Dinitrogen Cleavage by a Three-Coordinate Molybdenum(III) Complex|first1=Catalina E.|last1= Laplaza |first2= Christopher C.|last2= Cummins |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|date=1995|volume=268|issue=5212|pages= 861–863|doi=10.1126/science.268.5212.861|pmid=17792182|bibcode=1995Sci...268..861L}}&lt;/ref&gt; This and related terminal nitrido complexes have been used to make [[nitriles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=John J.|last1= Curley |first2=Emma L. |last2=Sceats|first3= Christopher C.|last3= Cummins |title=A Cycle for Organic Nitrile Synthesis via Dinitrogen Cleavage|journal=[[J.

Nitrogen adds end-on to the molybdenum atom, and the bulky HIPT substituents prevent the formation of the stable and nonreactive Mo−N=N−Mo [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]]. In this isolated pocket is the Mo−N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The proton donor is a [[pyridinium]] salt of weakly coordinating counter anion. The [[reducing agent]] is decamethylchromocene. All ammonia formed is collected as the HCl salt by trapping the distillate with a HCl solution.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note also that, although the dinitrogen complex is shown in brackets, this species can be isolated and characterized. Here the brackets do not indicate that the intermediate is not observed.&lt;/ref&gt; In these systems, like the biological one, hydrogen is provided to the substrate heterolytically, by means of protons and a strong [[reducing agent]] rather than with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; itself.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3025">The '''noisy channel model''' is a framework used in [[spell checker]]s,
[[question answering]], [[speech recognition]], and [[machine translation]].
In this model, the goal is to find the intended word given a word where the
letters have been scrambled in some manner.

== Definition ==

Given an alphabet &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; be the set
of all finite strings over &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;. Let the dictionary
&lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; of valid words be some subset of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.,
&lt;math&gt;D\subseteq\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''noisy channel''' is the matrix

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{ws} = \Pr(s|w)&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;w\in D&lt;/math&gt; is the intended word and &lt;math&gt;s\in\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;
is the scrambled word that was actually received.

== Example ==

Consider the English alphabet
&lt;math&gt;\Sigma = \{a, b, c, ..., y, z, A, B, ..., Z, ...\}&lt;/math&gt;. Some subset
&lt;math&gt;D\subseteq\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; makes up the dictionary of valid English
words.

There are several mistakes that may occur while typing, including:

# Missing letters, e.g., ''{{notatypo|leter}}'' instead of ''letter''
# Accidental letter additions, e.g., ''{{notatypo|misstake}}'' instead of ''mistake''
# Swapping letters, e.g., ''{{notatypo|recieved}}'' instead of ''received''
# Replacing letters, e.g., ''{{notatypo|fimite}}'' instead of ''finite''

To construct the noisy channel matrix &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, we must consider
the probability of each mistake, given the intended word
(&lt;math&gt;\Pr(s|w)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;w\in D&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;s\in\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;). These probabilities may be gathered, for
example, by considering the [[Levenshtein distance]] between &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; or by comparing the draft of an essay with one that has
been manually edited for spelling.

== Error-correction ==

The goal of the noisy channel model is to find the intended word given the
scrambled word that was received. The '''decision function'''
&lt;math&gt;\sigma : \Sigma^* \to D&lt;/math&gt; is a function that, given a scrambled word, returns
the intended word.

Methods of constructing a decision function include the
[[maximum likelihood|maximum likelihood rule]], the
[[maximum a posteriori|maximum a posteriori rule]], and the
[[minimum distance estimation|minimum distance rule]].

In some cases, it may be better to accept the scrambled word as the intended
word rather than attempt to find an intended word in the dictionary. For
example, the word ''[[schönfinkeling]]'' may not be in the dictionary, but might
in fact be the intended word.

In [[R&amp;D management]] and [[systems development]], '''open coopetition'''  or '''open-coopetition''' is a [[neologism]] to describe cooperation among competitors in the open-source arena.The term was first coined by the scholars Jose Teixeira and Tingting Lin to describe how rival firms that, while competing with similar products in the same markets (e.g., [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Samsung]], [[Google]], [[Nokia]]), collaborate which each other in the development of open-source projects (e.g., [[Webkit]]).&lt;ref name="TeixeiraAndLin2014"&gt;{{cite conference| author1=Jose Teixeira|author2=Lin Tingting|title=Collaboration in the open-source arena: The WebKit case|conference=52nd ACM conference on Computers and people research|book-title=ACM SIGMIS CPR 2014|date=2014|location=Singapore|pages=121–129|doi=10.1145/2599990.2600009|arxiv=1401.5996|publisher=ACM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Open-coopetition is a [[Compound (linguistics)|compound-word]] term bridging [[coopetition]] and [[Open-source software|open-source]]. [[Coopetition]] refers to a paradoxical relationship between two or more actors simultaneously involved in cooperative and competitive interactions;&lt;ref name="BengtssonANDKock2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Maria Bengtsson|author2=Sören Kock|title=Coopetition" in business Networks - to cooperate and compete simultaneously|journal=Industrial marketing management|date=2000|volume=29|issue=5|pages=411–426|doi=10.1016/S0019-8501(99)00067-X|publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BengtssonANDKock2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Maria Bengtsson|author2=Sören Kock|title=Coopetition—Quo vadis?

[[File:Integrating open-coopetition in practice.svg|Integrating open-coopetition in practice|thumb| alt= open-coopetition in practice maximizes transparency | upright=1.25| Situating open-coopetition in practice.]]

Such intertwined behavior of cooperation and competition in an [[Open-source software|open-source]] way, emphasizes [[Transparency (behavior)#Technology|transparency on the development of technological artifacts]] that become available to the public under an [[open-source license]]—allowing anyone to freely obtain, study, modify and redistribute them. Within open-coopetition, [[Transparency (behavior)#Technology|development transparency]] and [[sense of community]] are maximized; while the [[Control (management)|managerial control]] and [[Intellectual property|IP enforcement]] are minimized. Open-coopetitive relationships are paradoxical as the core managerial concepts of property, contract and price play an outlier role.

The [[Openness|openness characteristic]] of open-source projects also distinguishes open-coopetition from other forms of [[Strategic alliance|cooperative arrangements]] by its inclusiveness: Everybody can contribute.  Users or other contributors do not need to hold a supplier contract or sign a legal [[intellectual property]] arrangement to contribute. Moreover, neither to be a member of a particular firm or affiliated with a particular [[joint venture]] or [[consortia]] to be able to contribute. In the words of [[Massimo Banzi]], "You don't need anyone's permission to make something great".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Banzi|first1=Massimo|title=How Arduino is open-sourcing imagination @ TEDGlobal 2012|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/massimo_banzi_how_arduino_is_open_sourcing_imagination?language=en#t-1202|website=ted.com|publisher=TED|accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===2008===

In a large-scale study involving multiple European-based software intensive firms, the scholars Pär Ågerfalk and Brian Fitzgerald revealed a shift from "[[Open-source software|open-source]]  as a community of individual developers to [[Open-source software|open-source]] as a community of commercial organizations, primarily small and medium-sized enterprises, operating as a symbiotic ecosystem in a spirit of [[coopetition]]".&lt;ref name="Agerfalk_and_Fitzgeral2008"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pär Ågerfalk|author2=Brian Fitzgerald| title=Outsourcing to an Unknown Workforce: Exploring Opensorcing as a Global Sourcing Strategy| journal=MIS Quarterly|date=2008|doi=10.2307/25148845 |publisher=Management Information Systems Research Center, University of Minnesota|volume=32|issue=2|pages=385–409}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Even if they were exploring [[Open-sourcing|opensourcing]] as "a novel and unconventional approach to global sourcing and [[coopetition]]", they captured the following quote that highlights that competition in the open-source arena is not as in business as usual. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 "In a traditional market you don't call up your competitor and be like, oh, well tell me what your stuff
 does. But in open source you do." [Open Source Program Director, at [[IONA Technologies|IONA]]] &lt;ref name="Agerfalk_and_Fitzgeral2008"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===2012===

Also in the academic world, and after following an [[software company]] based in Norway for over five years, and while theorizing on the concept of [[software ecosystem]], the academic Geir K. Hanssen noted that the characteristic networks of an [[software ecosystem]], open-source or proprietary ones, can embed competing organizations.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Software ecosystems have a networked character. CSoft and its external environment constitute a network of customers and
third party organizations. Even competitors may be considered a part of this network, although this aspect has not been studied
in particular here."&lt;ref name="Hanssen2012"&gt;{{cite journal|author1= Geir K. Hanssen | title=A longitudinal case study of an emerging software ecosystem: Implications for practice and theory | journal= Journal of Systems and Software|date=2012|doi=10.1016/j.jss.2011.04.020|publisher=Elsevier|volume=85|issue=7|pages=1455–1466}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an opinion article entitled Open Source Coopetition Fueled by Linux Foundation Growth, the journalist and market analyst Jay Lyman highlights that "working with direct rivals may have been unthinkable 10 years ago, but  [[Linux]], [[Open Source Software|open-source]] and organizations such as [[Linux Foundation|the Linux Foundation]]  have highlighted how solving common problems and easing customer pain and friction in using and choosing different technologies can truly drive innovation and traction in the market."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lyman|first1=Jay|title=Open Source Coopetition Fueled by LF Growth|url=http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/74624.html|accessdate=18 March 2015|publisher=LinuxInsider @ ECT News Network|date=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "open source coopetition" was employed to highlight the role of the [[Linux Foundation]] as a mediator of collaboration among rival firms.

===2013===
At the OpenStack summit in [[Hong Kong]], the co-founder of [[Mirantis]]  Boris Renski talked about his job on figuring out how to co-opete in the crowded OpenStack open-source community. In a 43-minute broadcast video, Boris Renski shed some light on OpenStack coopetition politics and shared a subjective view on strategies of individual players within the OpenStack community (e.g., [[Rackspace]], [[Mirantis]], [[IBM]], [[Hewlett Packard Enterprise|HP]] and [[Red Hat]] among others).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Along with this lines, the pioneering scholarly work of Germonprez et al. (2013)&lt;ref name="Germonprez_et_al2013"&gt;{{cite journal|author1= Matt Germonprez |author2=  J. Allen | author3= Jamie Hill| author4= Glenn McClements  |title=Open source communities of competitors|journal= interactions|date=2013|pages=54--49|doi=10.1145/2527191|publisher=ACM|location=NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported on how key business actors within the financial services industry that traditionally viewed [[Open-source software movement|open-source software]] with skepticism,  tied up an [[Open-source software movement|open-source]] ‘community of competitors’.  By taking the case of  [http://www.openmama.org/ OpenMAMA], a [[Middleware]]    Agnostic Messaging   [[API]] used by some of the world’s largest financial players,  they show that corporate market rivals (e.g., [[J. P. Morgan]], [[Bank of America]], [[IBM]] and [[BMC Software|BMC]]) can coexist in [[Open-source software movement|open-source communities]],   and intentionally coordinate activities or mutual benefits in precise, market focused,     and non-differentiating engagements.  Their work pointed out that high-competitive capital-oriented industries do not epitomize the traditional and grassroots idea that [[Open-source software movement|open-source software]] was originally born from. Furthermore, they argued that [[Open-source software movement|open-source communities]] can be deliberately designed to include competing vendors and customers under neutral institutional structures (e.g., foundations and steering committees).

=== 2014 ===
In an academic paper entitled "Collaboration in the open-source arena: The WebKit case", the scholars Jose Teixeira and Tingting Lin executed an [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] informed [[social network analysis]] on the development of the [[WebKit]] [[Open Source Software|open-source]] [[Web navigation|web browsing]] technologies. Among a set of the reported findings, they pointed out that even if [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Samsung]] were involved in expensive patent wars in the courts at the time, they still collaborated in the open-source arena. As some of the research results did not confirm prior research in [[coopetition]],&lt;ref name="BengtssonANDKock2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BengtssonANDKock2014"/&gt; the authors proposed and coined the "open-coopetition" term while emphasizing the [[openness]] of collaborating with competitors in the [[Open-source software|open-source]] arena.&lt;ref name="TeixeiraAndLin2014"/&gt;

=== 2015 ===

By turning to [[OpenStack]], the scholars Teixeira et al. (2015)&lt;ref name="teixeira_et_al2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author1= Jose Teixeira |author2=  Gregorio Robles | author3= Jesús M. González-Barahona |title=Lessons learned from applying social network analysis on an industrial Free/Libre/Open Source Software ecosystem|journal= Journal of Internet Services and Applications|date=2015|doi=10.1186/s13174-015-0028-2|publisher=Springer|doi-access=free|arxiv=1507.04587}}&lt;/ref&gt;
went further and modeled and analyzed both collaborative and competitive networks from the [[OpenStack]] open-source project (a large and complex [[cloud computing]] infrastructure for [[big data]]).  Somewhat surprising results point out that competition for the same [[revenue model]] (i.e., operating conflicting business models) does not necessarily affect collaboration within the [[OpenStack|OpenStack ecosystem]]—in other words, competition among firms did not significantly influence collaboration among software developers affiliated with them. Furthermore, the expected social tendency of developers to work with developers from same firm (i.e., [[homophily]]) did not hold within the [[OpenStack|OpenStack ecosystem]]. The case of [[OpenStack]] revealed to be much about genuine collaboration in software development besides ubiquitous competition among the firms that produce and use the software.

A related study by Linåker et al. (2016)&lt;ref name="linaker_et_al2016"&gt;
{{cite conference | url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-30282-9_5| author1= Johan Linåker | author2= Patrick Rempel | author3= Björn Regnell | author4=Patrick Mäder |date=2016 |title=How Firms Adapt and Interact in Open Source Ecosystems: Analyzing Stakeholder Influence and Collaboration Patterns |book-title=  REFSQ 2016| conference=22nd International Working Conference on Requirements Engineering: Foundation for Software Quality|pages= 63–81 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-30282-9_5|publisher=Springer| location=Göteborg, Sweden}} &lt;!-- volume=LNCS 9619 --&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; analyzed the [[Apache Hadoop]] ecosystem in a quantitative longitudinal case study to investigate changing stakeholder influence and collaboration patterns. They found that the collaborative network had a quite stable number of network components (i.e., number of [[Community structure|sub-communities]] within the community) with many unconnected stakeholders. Furthermore, such components were dominated by a core set of stakeholders that engaged in most of the collaborative relationships. As in [[OpenStack]], there was much cooperation among competing and non-competing actors within the [[Apache Hadoop]] ecosystem—or in other words, firms with competing [[business models]] collaborate as openly as non-rivaling firms. Finally, they also 
argued that the openness of software ecosystems decreases the distance to competitors within the same ecosystem, it becomes possible and important to track what the competitors do within. Knowing about their existing collaborations, contributions, and interests in specific features offer valuable information about the competitors’ strategies and tactics.

In a study addressing coopetition in the [[cloud computing]] industry, Teixeira et al.&lt;ref name="teixeira_et_al_icis2016"&gt;
{{cite conference |title=Cooperation among competitors in the open-source arena: The case of OpenStack | author1=Jose Teixeira | author2= Salman Mian | author3=Ulla Hytti |publisher= AIS |book-title= ICIS 2016 | location=Dublin, Ireland  |conference= 37th International Conference on Information Systems| arxiv=1612.09462|bibcode=2016arXiv161209462T}} 
&lt;/ref&gt; analyzed not only coopetition among individuals and organizations but also among [[business networks|cohesive inter-organizational networks]]. Relationships among individuals were modeled and visualized in 2D longitudinal visualizations and relationships among [[business networks|inter-organizational networks]] (e.g., alliances, consortium or ecosystem) were modeled and visualized in 3D longitudinal visualizations. The author added evidence to prior research&lt;ref name="BengtssonANDKock2014"/&gt; suggesting that competition is a [[Multilevel model|multi-level phenomenon]] that is influenced by individual-level, organizational-level, and network-level factors.

By noting that many firms engaging into open-coopetition actively manage multiple portfolios of [[Strategic alliance|alliances]] in the software industry (i.e., many strategically contribute to multiple [[Open-source software|open-source]] [[software ecosystem]]s) and by analyzing the co-evolution of [[OpenStack]] and the [[CloudStack]] [[cloud computing]] platforms,  the same authors propose that development transparency and the weak intellectual property rights, two well-known characteristics of [[Open-source software|open-source]] [[Software ecosystem|ecosystems]], allow an easier transfer of information and resources from one [[Strategic alliance|alliance]] to another.  Even if openness enables a focal firm to transfer information and resources more easily between multiple [[Strategic alliance|alliancess]], such  'ease of transfer'  should not be seen as a source of [[competitive advantage]] as competitors can do the same.

=== 2017 ===

In a study explicitly addressing coopetition in [[Open-source software|open-source]] [[software ecosystem]]s, Nguyen Duc et al. (2017)&lt;ref name="duc_et_al2017"&gt;
{{cite conference |url=https://link.springer.com/conference/icsob |title=Coopetition of software firms in open source software ecosystems |author1= Anh Nguyen Duc|author2=Daniela Cruzes S.|author3=Geir Hanssen K.|author4=Pekka Abrahamsson| author5= Terje Snarby|date= 2017 |publisher= Springer |book-title=ICSOB 2017 |pages= |location= Essen, Germany |conference= 8th International Conference on Software Business}}
&lt;/ref&gt; identified a number of situations in which different actors within the [[software ecosystem]] deal with collaborative-competitive issues:

* Central actors that act as a bridge between the community and the companies contributing to it (e.g., a [[Lead programmer|lead developer]] or a [[Software maintainer|maintainer]]) need to act as gatekeepers (aka [[Boundary spanning|boundary spanners]]) for bugs reported against specific products sold by the participating firms. As the software is integrated [[Downstream (software development)|downstream]] into specific products often sold by competing firms, it matters to sort out what bugs are the responsibility of a specific firm or the community as a whole. In parallel, such 'bridging' actors also act as gatekeepers in flows of code and information  (e.g., what code should, or should not, be included in the official [[Release early, release often|community-releases]] and what information should circulate among the ecosystem participants).
* Contributors affiliated with firms need to balance the interests of their employers with the interests of the community as a whole. Therefore, their work encompasses the filtering of what is to be kept private (hidden and/or property of the firm)  or what is to be open (transparent and publicly-available under the open-source community terms). Such filtering is impacted by many factors that can range from technical, legal, bureaucratic, as well as organizational strategy issues. &lt;!-- control different policies is challenging as point out by jarben ppa and ann --&gt; .

Competitive behavior within [[Open-source software development|open-source software ecosystems]] frictions with the more purist view of [[free and open-source software]]. The same authors reported on some working practices that conflict with the more traditional values of [[free and open-source software]].
 
* Developers occasionally establish private communication channels. Some open-source purists would prefer that all communication remains transparent and publicly available to the overall community.
* Developers limit sensitive information to certain partners.  While purists would prefer all relevant information to remain available to all ecosystem participants, legal or security issues are often discussed in private and secure communication channels.

The same study also unfolded a number of benefits that organization can rip by actively contributing to [[Open-source software development|open-source software ecosystems]] that encompass both cooperative and competitive relationships: 
* '''Keeping the differences between their packaged software and the upstream software to a minimum'''. This allows firms to more easily benefit from the newest developments in the community. By implementing an [[Upstream (software development)|upstream]] first policy,  organizations can more easily catch updates, fixes, and changes from [[Upstream (software development)|upstream]]. 
* '''Sharing maintenance responsibilities'''. Organizations working only [[Downstream (software development)|downstream]] (i.e., just taking the software without contributing back) become solely responsible for maintaining their solution without the benefit of the overall community. 
* '''Reducing maintenance costs by revealing their own developments'''. If organizations extensively modify the software and opt to close some parts (keep it private or obfuscated) they will need to maintain such closed parts by themselves in the future without the benefit of the overall community. &lt;!-- avoid duplication of efforts and get all the community working together on improving a single set of patches avoid later having to rework changes that are incompatible with the latest software version. --&gt; 
* '''Faster integration of new contributions'''. Active contributors will get their work integrated [[Upstream (software development)|upstream]] more easily due to an improved social position within the community.
* '''Receiving help'''.  Active contributors with an improved social position within the community are more likely to benefit from the help from others members in the community.  Given the complex nature of software development, help from other members in the ecosystem can be very valuable.
* '''A sense of friendly competitiveness'''.  Besides being competitors, the ecosystem participants develop a [[sense of community]]. Developers employed by competing firms can perceive others as partners and/or friends rather than competitors.  In their work, developers often think of others as developers, partners or colleagues (individual persons) over the firms that they are representing.
* '''Mutual [[co-creation]] of value'''. Even if many of competing firms are competitors they are often also customers/suppliers of each other. Furthermore, they might be competing in different geographical areas or different business domains creating a heterogeneous and [[Heterophily|heterophilous]] environment for reciprocal learning and value [[co-creation]]. Given the complex nature of software development, value creation should benefit from the involvement of multiple and heterogeneous actors holding complementary skills and resources.

== Cases ==

Cases of [[open-coopetition]] are recurrent in the [[software industry]] in general. Furthermore, some cases exist also in the [[Consumer electronics|electronics]], [[Semiconductor industry|semiconductors]], [[automotive industry|automotive]], [[Financial services|financial]], [[Telecommunications industry|telecommunications]], [[retail]], [[education]], [[Healthcare industry|healthcare]], [[Arms industry|defense]], [[Aerospace manufacturer|aerospace]], and [[3D printing|additive manufacturing]] industries. Cases of [[open-coopetition]] are often associated with high-tech corporations and startups based in the USA (predominantly on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]).

Many of the software projects encompassing [[open-coopetition]] are legally governed by [http://flossfoundations.org/foundation-directory foundations] such as the [[Linux Foundation]], the [[Free Software Foundation]], the [[Apache Software Foundation]], the [[Eclipse Foundation]], the [[Cloud Native Computing Foundation]], and the [[X.Org Foundation]] among many others.  Most of the [[Linux Foundation]] [https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects/ collaborative projects] are coopetitive in nature --- the [[Linux Foundation]] claims to be "a neutral home for collaborative development".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects/ |title= Projects - The Linux Foundation |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;  | website= Linux Foundation |publisher= |access-date=  11 Oct 2017|quote=...&amp;nbsp;hosting your project at The Linux Foundation, a neutral home for collaborative development.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, many coopetitive open-source projects dealing with both software and hardware (e.g., [[computer graphics]], [[Computer data storage|data storage]]) are bounded by [[Standards organization|standard organizations]] such as the [[Khronos Group]], [[W3C]] and the [[Open Compute Project]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2287">{{for|the shopping center in Houston|Palm Center (Houston)}}
The '''Palm Center''' is a [[think tank]] founded in 1998 at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], that produces scholarship designed to improve the quality of public dialogue about critical and controversial [[public policy]] issues. It commissions and disseminates research in the areas of gender, sexuality, and the military that has been published in leading social scientific journals and cited in the press. The Palm Center is a resource for university-affiliated as well as independent scholars, students, journalists, opinion leaders, and members of the public.

At its founding in 1998, it was known as the Center for the Study of [[Sexual minorities|Sexual Minorities]] in the Military. It was renamed in 2006 in recognition of a one million dollar endowment gift from the Michael D. Palm Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronoicle of Philanthropy'': [http://philanthropy.com/article/Philanthropys-Military/128431/ Anthony Bowen and Andrew Lane, "End of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” Is a Victory for Philanthropy," July 26, 2011], accessed February 1, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Palm Center's research has been cited on the floor of Congress and covered by newspapers and radio and television stations throughout the world. Palm scholars have delivered briefings and lectures at the [[British Ministry of Defence]], the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point, the [[United States Naval Academy]], the [[United States Air Force Academy]], the [[United States Army War College|Army War College]] and the [[National Defense University]].

The director of the Palm Center is [[Aaron Belkin]].&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/us/26bcjames.html Scott James, "Celebration of Gay Pride Masks Community in Transition," June 25, 2011], accessed February 1, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Penile plethysmography''' ('''PPG''') or '''phallometry''' is measurement of [[blood]]flow to the [[human penis|penis]], typically used as a proxy for measurement of [[sexual arousal]]. The most commonly reported methods of conducting penile plethysmography involve the measurement of the circumference of the penis with a mercury-in-rubber or electromechanical [[strain gauge]], or the volume of the penis with an airtight cylinder and inflatable cuff at the base of the penis. [[Corpus cavernosum penis|Corpora cavernosa]] nerve penile plethysmographs measure changes in response to inter-operative electric stimulation during surgery. The volumetric procedure was invented by [[Kurt Freund]] and is considered to be particularly sensitive at low arousal levels. The easier to use circumferential measures are more widely used, however, and more common in studies using [[erotic film]] stimuli. A corresponding device in women is the [[vaginal photoplethysmograph]].&lt;ref&gt;Prause, Nicole, and Erick Janssen. "Blood flow: Vaginal photoplethysmography." Women’s sexual function and dysfunction: Study, diagnosis, and treatment (2006): 359-367.&lt;/ref&gt;

For sexual offenders it is typically used to determine the level of sexual arousal as the subject is exposed to sexually suggestive content, such as pictures, movies or audio, although some have argued that phallometry is not always appropriate for the evaluation of sexual preferences or treatment effects.&lt;ref name="simon"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Simon W.

For [[prostatectomy]] [[nerve-sparing surgery]], the surgeon applies a mild electrical stimulation near the [[cavernous nerves of penis]] to verify their locations and avoid operative trauma. Damage to these difficult-to-see nerves can cause [[erectile dysfunction]] outcomes. At the surgery's conclusion, the electrical stimulation penile plethysmograph result is a [[prognosis]] which helps to manage the erectile function outcomes earlier than the many months required for recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Klotz L, Heaton J, Jewett M, etal |title=A randomized phase 3 study of intraoperative cavernosa nerve stimulation with penile tumescence monitoring to improve nerve sparing during radical prostatectomy |journal=J.

==Types==
There are two types of penile plethysmograph:

*Volumetric air chamber
:When this is placed over the subject's penis, as [[tumescence]] increases, the air displaced is measured.
*Circumferential transducer
:This uses a mercury-in-rubber or indium/gallium-in-rubber ring or electromechanical [[strain gauge]] and is placed around the shaft of the subject's penis to measure changes in circumference.

The circumferential type is more common,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Howes R. J. | year = 1995 | title = A survey of plethysmographic assessment in North America | url = | journal = Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 9–24 | doi=10.1007/bf02254871}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the volumetric method is believed to be more accurate at low arousal levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kuban M, Barbaree HE, Blanchard R |title=A comparison of volume and circumference phallometry: response magnitude and method agreement |journal=Arch Sex Behav |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=345–59 |date=August 1999 |pmid=10553495 |doi= 10.1023/A:1018700813140|url=http://www.kluweronline.com/art.pdf?issn=0004-0002&amp;volume=28&amp;page=345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant suppliers of PPG machines include Behavioral Technology Inc. and Medical Monitoring Systems. The device is known to be used in [[Brazil]], [[UK|Britain]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Hong Kong]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Slovak Republic]], [[Spain]], and the [[United States]].

The surgical machine is supplied as CaverMap by Blue Torch Medical Technology, Inc.

A roughly equivalent procedure for women, [[vaginal photoplethysmograph]]y, measures blood through the walls of the [[vagina]], which researchers claim increases during sexual arousal.

==History==
The original volumetric was developed during the 1950s by [[Kurt Freund]] in then-[[Czechoslovakia]]. Freund later wrote, "In the early fifties homosexual interaction was still an indictable offense in Czechoslovakia. I was of course opposed to this measure, but I still thought, as did my colleagues at the psychiatric university hospital in Prague where I was working, that homosexuality was an experientially acquired neurosis". He then developed phallometry to replace [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] methods of assessment because "[P]sychoanalysis had turned out to be a failure, virtually unusable as an instrument for individual diagnosis or research....When phallometry began to look promising as a test of erotic sex and age preferences, we started using it mainly as a test of [[pedophilia]], that is determining who has an erotic preference for children over adults".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Freund K | year = 1991 | title = Reflections on the development of the phallometric method of assessing sexual preference | url = | journal = Annals of Sex Research | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 221–228 | doi = 10.1007/BF00850054 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In post–World War II Czechoslovakia, Freund was assigned by the communist government the task of identifying among military conscripts men who were falsely declaring themselves to be gay to avoid the draft.&lt;ref name = wilson2006&gt;Wilson, R. J., &amp; Mathon, H. F. (2006, fall). Remembering Kurt Freund (1914-1996). ''ATSA Forum.'' Beaverton, OR: Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepdic.com/penilep.html penile plethysmograph (PPG) (Sceptic's dictionary)]&lt;/ref&gt; "Freund (1957) developed the first device, which measured penile volume changes... to distinguish heterosexual and homosexual males for the Czechoslovakian army."&lt;ref name="odonohue"&gt;W O'Donohue, E Letourneau.

Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; When he escaped Europe for Canada, Freund was able to pursue his research using phallometry for the assessment of sexual offenders.&lt;ref name = wilson2006/&gt; At that time, attempts to develop methods of changing homosexual men into heterosexual men were being made by many sexologists, including [[John Bancroft (sexologist)|John Bancroft]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bancroft J |title=Aversion therapy of homosexuality.

(See also [[LGBT rights in the Czech Republic]].)

==Reliability and validity==
In 1994, the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (Fourth Edition) of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] stated that penile plethysmography has been used in research settings to assess various paraphilias by measuring an individual's sexual arousal in response to visual and auditory stimuli. The reliability and validity of this procedure in clinical assessment have not been well established, and clinical experience suggests that subjects can simulate response by manipulating mental images."&lt;ref name="dsmiv"&gt;DSM-IV, p. 524.&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, a recent meta-analysis provides support for the validity of phallometric testing as a measure of sexual interests in children across 37 samples and 6,785 individuals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McPhail|first=Ian V.|last2=Hermann|first2=Chantal A.|last3=Fernane|first3=Stephanie|last4=Fernandez|first4=Yolanda M.|last5=Nunes|first5=Kevin L.|last6=Cantor|first6=James M.|title=Validity in Phallometric Testing for Sexual Interests in Children: A Meta-Analytic Review|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1073191117706139|journal=Assessment|language=en|doi=10.1177/1073191117706139|year=2017|page=107319111770613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Hanson and Bussière published a comprehensive meta-analysis of 61 scientific reports on the prediction of sexual offenses spanning more than 40,000 individual cases. They ascertained that of all the methods attempted and reported, penile phethysmographic responses to imagery depicting [[children]] was the single most accurate predictor of sexual re-offense across 7 studies reporting data from phallometric testing.&lt;ref name = Hanson1998/&gt; Another meta-analysis in 2005 of 13 studies and 2,180 individual cases repeated the finding that phallometric responses to children was a strong predictor of sexual re-offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hanson R. K. |author2=Morton-Bourgon K. E. | year = 2005 | title = The characteristics of persistent sexual offenders: A meta-analysis of recidivism studies | url = | journal = Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology | volume = 73 | issue = | pages = 1154–1163 | doi=10.1037/0022-006x.73.6.1154 | pmid=16392988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent meta-analysis that included 16 samples and 2,709 sexual offenders replicated and extended the previous findings that phallometric responding to children is a predictor of sexual re-offence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This meta-analysis extended previous meta-analytic research by showing phallometric responding to both male and female pedophilic and [[Hebephilia|hebephilic]] stimuli predict sexual re-offence.   Further, this meta-analysis showed that phallometric testing predicts sexual re-offence in distinct subgroups of sexual offenders against children.

===Critique of methodological problems===
There are criticisms of the methodology used to determine the reliability and specificity of penile plethysmography. One such criticism is that while penile plethysmography is said to be important for being more objective than a test subject’s subjective reports on sexual arousal, the argument for penile plethysmography being a more reliable gauge of sexual arousal than vaginal plethysmography is still that there is a higher correspondence on average between what the test subjects report and what the instruments observe in male subjects than in female subjects. There is a criticism of this discrepancy for lacking consistency in the standards of whether or not subjective reports are useful. There is also criticism regarding the possibility of sampling bias being greater in male subjects of penile plethysmography than in female subjects of vaginal plethysmography, males being generally more aware of their physical sexual responses than females in most cultures may cause the male volunteers to be almost exclusively individuals who have category specific erections due to those with nonspecific erections fearing erection in taboo contexts and therefore not signing up for the studies. This effect may explain apparent male specificity as a result of methodological bias. The difference between tests of volunteers and tests of convicted or suspected sex offenders in penile plethysmography results may be caused by the sex offender group often effectively lacking the choice not to volunteer, without difference in erection patterns from the average population. One criticism of reoffending studies is that cultural attitudes that assume that men are sexually attracted to what they phallometrically respond to may cause men with no actual sexual interest in children to identify as pedophiles due to knowing that they phallometrically respond to them, making them more likely to be convicted again.&lt;ref&gt;Science and Pseudoscience in Clinical Psychology, Scott O. Lilienfeld, Steven Jay Lynn, Jeffrey M. Lohr 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;At the Fringes of Science, 1998, Michael W. Friedlander&lt;/ref&gt;

==Utility==

=== Erectile dysfunction ===
The penile plethysmograph has value in screening organic versus psychogenic [[erectile dysfunction]] in [[urological]] [[polysomnography]] centres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5377691.html Patent]&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of sexual response during [[REM sleep]] may indicate that further evaluation by a [[urologist]] is required.&lt;ref name="marshall"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marshall P, Surridge D, Delva N |title=The role of nocturnal penile tumescence in differentiating between organic and psychogenic impotence: the first stage of validation |journal=Arch Sex Behav |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |date=February 1981 |pmid=7212992 |doi= 10.1007/BF01542669|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When applied during [[nerve-sparing surgery]], electrical stimulation penile plethysmograph is an erectile dysfunction prognostic. The patient is provided with objective information on his specific outcome which aids in planning for further erectile function therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Klotz L |title=Cavernosal nerve mapping: current data and applications |journal=BJU Int. |volume=93 |issue=1 |pages=9–13 |date=January 2004 |pmid=14678359 |doi= 10.1111/j.1464-410X.2004.04546.x|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=1464-4096&amp;date=2004&amp;volume=93&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pedophilia, hebephilia, pedohebephilia, and ephebophilia===
Studies examining the efficiency of using penile plethysmograph to distinguish [[Pedophilia|pedophilic]] men from non-pedophilic men, including [[Hebephilia|hebephiles]], show that a majority can be correctly assigned to the proper category.&lt;ref name="pmid11281033"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blanchard R, Klassen P, Dickey R, Kuban ME, Blak T |title=Sensitivity and specificity of the phallometric test for pedophilia in nonadmitting sex offenders |journal=Psychol Assess |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=118–26 |date=March 2001 |pmid=11281033 |doi= 10.1037/1040-3590.13.1.118|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/pas/13/1/118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="57-1-100"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Freund K, Blanchard R |title=Phallometric diagnosis of pedophilia |journal=J Consult Clin Psychol |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=100–5 |date=February 1989 |pmid=2925958 |doi= 10.1037/0022-006X.57.1.100|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/ccp/57/1/100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, W. &amp; Barbaree, H.

[[Sensitivity and specificity|Specificity]] of these tests is defined as the accuracy of the test to identify non-pedophilic (or non-hebephilic) individuals as such.  Meta-analytic research has shown that sexual offenders against children show greater responding on phallomtric tests for pedophilia and hebephilia than controls.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Volumetric penile plethysmography ====
In one study, 21% of the subjects were excluded for various reasons, including "the subject's erotic age-preference was uncertain and his phallometrically diagnosed sex-preference was the same as his verbal claim" and attempts to influence the outcome of the test.&lt;ref name="57-1-100"/&gt; This study found the sensitivity for identifying pedohebephilia in sexual offenders against children admitting to this interest to be 100%.  In addition, the sensitivity for this phallometric test in partially admitting sexual offenders against children was found to be 77% and for denying sexual offenders against children to be 58%.  The specificity of this volumetric phallometric test for pedohebephilia was estimated to be 95%.

Further studies by Freund have estimated the sensitivity of a volumetric test for pedohebephilia to be 35% for sexual offenders against children with a single female victim, 70% for those with two or more female victims, 77% for those offenders with one male victim, and 84% for those with two or more male victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freund|first1=K.|last2=Watson|first2=R.

In a similar study, the sensitivity of a volumetric test for pedophilia to be 62% for sexual offenders against children with a single female victim, 90% for those with two or more female victims, 76% for those offenders with one male victim, and 95% for those with two or more male victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freund|first1=K.|last2=Watson|first2=R.

In a separate study, sensitivity of the method to distinguish between pedohebephilic men from non-pedohebephilic men was estimated between 29% and 61% depending on subgroup.&lt;ref name="pmid11281033"/&gt;  Specifically, sensitivity was estimated to be 61% for sexual offenders against children with 3 or more victims and 34% in incest offenders.  The specificity of the test using a sample of sexual offenders against adults was 96% and the [[area under the curve]] for the test was estimated to be .86.

In addition, the specificity for this phallometric test was 68% in a sample of community males.

Another study examined the possibility that juvenile sex offenders might be able to suppress arousal deemed deviant.  Of the juveniles who exhibited sexual arousal, categorization was made into two age appropriate categories—Adult and Peer responders—and three age inappropriate categories—Child, Child/Adult, and Nondiscriminating responders—based on whether they had the greatest sexual arousal in response to adult female, peer female, or younger child female stimuli.  Sexual arousal in response to older adult women or peers was deemed age appropriate;  sexual arousal in response to significantly younger females was deemed inappropriate.  Many of the juveniles who denied responsibility for their offenses showed no sexual arousal at all—however about one-third still showed age inappropriate arousal despite denying responsibility for their offenses.&lt;ref name="23-1-87"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Becker J.V. |author2=Kaplan M |author3=Tenke C |title=The Relationship of Abuse History, Denial and Erectile Response Profiles of Adolescent Sexual Perpetrators |journal=Behavior Therapy |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=87–97 |date=Winter 1992 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005789405803107 |doi=10.1016/s0005-7894(05)80310-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross-dressing===
Phallometry might distinguish men with erotic interests in [[cross-dressing]] from non-cross-dressers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Buhrich N. |author2=McConaghy N. | year = 1977 | title = The discrete syndromes of transvestism and transsexualism | url = | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 483–495 | doi=10.1007/bf01541153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Freund K. |author2=Seto M.

===Biastophilia===
There is some evidence that phallometry can distinguish groups of men with [[biastophilia]] (a [[paraphilia]] involving [[rape]]) from groups of men without it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Seto M. C. |author2=Kuban M. | year = 1996 | title = Criterion-related validity of a phallometric test for paraphilic rape and sadism | url = | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 175–183 | doi=10.1016/0005-7967(95)00056-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal admissibility==
In general, phallometric test results are employed as part of the sentencing and rehabilitation phase of forensic systems, but ''not'' for determining whether a specific defendant is guilty of any specific offense against any specific person.

=== United States ===

====Use as trial evidence====
In the [[United States]], a scientific technique could not be used as evidence in court unless the technique was "generally accepted" as reliable in the relevant scientific community. This was known as the [[Frye standard]], adopted in 1923. In 1993, the doctrine was rejected by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in favor of a more comprehensive "reliable foundation" test in ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals]]''. In the [[Daubert standard]], the "generally accepted" test was no longer determinative. Several other factors could now be considered, including whether the technique had been published and peer reviewed. Myers notes, "Courts that have considered penile plethysmography generally rule that the technique is not sufficiently reliable for use in court."&lt;ref name="myers"&gt;Myers JEB (2005). ''Myers on Evidence in Child, Domestic, and Elder Abuse Cases.'' Aspen Publishers Online {{ISBN|0-7355-5668-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''United States v. Powers'' the court excluded the penile plethysmograph test because it failed to qualify under Daubert's scientific validity prong for two reasons: the scientific literature does not regard the test as a valid diagnostic tool, and "a vast majority of incest offenders who do not admit their guilt, such as Powers, show a normal reaction to the test. The Government argues that such [[false negative]]s render the test unreliable."&lt;ref name="powers"&gt;''United States v. Powers'', 59 F.3d 1460 (4th Cir. 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Barker and Howell, penile plethysmography (PPG) does not meet the legal threshold for the guilt phase for the following reasons:&lt;ref name="barker"&gt;Barker and Howell, The Plethysmograph: A Review of Recent Literature, 20 ''Bull. Am. Acad. of Psychiatry and Law'' 13 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

*No standardization
*Test results are not sufficiently accurate
*Results are subject to faking and voluntary control by test subjects
*High incidence of false negatives and false positives
*Results are open to interpretation

They concluded, "Until a way can be devised to detect and/or control false negatives and false positives, the validity of the test data will be questionable."&lt;ref name="barker"/&gt; Responding to Barker and Howell, Simon and Schouten noted, "Our own analysis suggests that the standardization and faking issues, as well as other problems not addressed in the Barker and Howell paper, warrant much more guarded conclusions about the use of the plethysmograph in legal and clinical settings."&lt;ref name="simon"/&gt; Prentky noted "the increased likelihood in forensic settings that dissimulation may compromise the validity of the assessment."&lt;ref name="prentky"&gt;Prentky RA, Knight RA, Lee AFS (1997) Risk factors associated with recidivism among extrafamilial child molesters. ''Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology.''&lt;/ref&gt; Hall and Crowther noted penile plethysmography "may be even more problematic than other [methods] in assessing susceptibility of the test to faking."&lt;ref name="hall"&gt;Hall GCN, Crowther JH (1991). Psychologists' involvement in cases of child maltreatment: additional limits of assessment methods. ''[[American Psychologist]]'' Jan Vol 46(1) 79-80&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''State of North Carolina v. Spencer'',&lt;ref name="spencer"&gt;North Carolina v. Spencer, 459 S.E.2d 812, 815 (N.C. Ct. App. 1995),&lt;/ref&gt; the court reviewed the literature and case law and concluded that penile plethysmography was scientifically unreliable: "Despite the sophistication of the current equipment technology, a question remains whether the information emitted is a valid and reliable means of assessing sexual preference."

More recently, a substantial amount of research data has been gathered and reviewed, and significant steps have been taken toward standardization.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} According to Launay (1999), "[T]he validity of the technique for research and clinical assessment is now established;"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/cbm.317 | last1 = Launay | first1 = G. | year = 1999 | title = The phallometric assessment of sex offenders: an update | url = | journal = Criminal Behaviour and Mental Health | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 254–274 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is only the use in guilt-determination proceedings that is inappropriate.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Fedoroff and Moran called it an "experimental procedure" and noted, "Virtually every expert who has written about phallometry has cautioned that it is insufficiently sensitive or specific to be used to determine the guilt or innocence of a person accused of a sex crime."&lt;ref name="fedoroff"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fedoroff | first1 = JP | last2 = Moran | first2 = B | year = 1997 | title = Myths and Misconceptions about Sex Offenders | url = | journal = The Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality | volume = 6 | issue = | page = 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Post-conviction use====
Phallometry is widely considered appropriate for treatment and supervision of convicted [[Sex and the law|sex offenders]]: "Courts have permitted plethysmographic testing for monitoring compliance by convicted sex offenders with the conditions of their community placement as part of crime-related treatment for sexual deviancy."&lt;ref&gt;Sachsenmaier, S. J., &amp; Peters, J. M. (2002). Sexual offender risk assessment methods and admissibility as expert witness evidence. In J. M. Peters (Ed.), ''Assessment and management of sex offenders: What prosecutors need to know.'' Washington, DC: United States Department of Justice, Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section&lt;/ref&gt; Its use for the treatment and management of sexual offenders is recommended by the [[Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers]].&lt;ref&gt;Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers. (2004). ''ATSA Practice Standards and Guidelines for the evaluation, treatment and management of adult male sexual abusers.''

What we know and do not know about assessing and treating sex offenders. ''Psychology, Public Policy, and Law.'' Volume:4 Issue:1/2 Dated:March/June 1998 Pages:116 to 137&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sexual assault]] trial of [[basketball]] player [[Kobe Bryant]] in [[Colorado]] brought this device and its use to public attention before the case was dropped in 2004, because Colorado law would have required evaluation with this device following conviction.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Shaw for USATODAY- [https://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/lakers/2003-10-08-shaw-analysis_x.htm Bryant's off-court issues may aid prosecution]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] recently addressed the procedures required before a [[federal supervised release]] program could include penile plethysmograph testing.&lt;ref name="usvweber"&gt;''United States v. Weber'', 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 15111 (9th Cir. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The device is routinely used at civil commitment facilities, but "some clinicians and offenders say it is easy, particularly in a laboratory, to stifle arousal and thus cheat on a plethysmograph test."&lt;ref name="goodnough"&gt;Goodnough A, Davey M (March 6, 2007). [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/06/us/06civil.html For Sex Offenders, a Dispute Over Therapy's Benefits.] ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; This has been reported to occur in 16% of cases.&lt;ref name="pmid11281033"/&gt;

During the [[Catholic sex abuse cases]], the reliability of the test was questioned by some officials in the [[Sexual abuse scandal in Philadelphia archdiocese|Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia]]. Later, these officials chose to seek therapy at an institution where the plethysmograph was not used.&lt;ref&gt;''Court of Common Pleas, First Judicial District of PA'', County Investigating Grand Jury, 9-17-2003
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===

Courts in [[Canada]] came to a similar conclusion as those in the United States. The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] adopted the [[Daubert standard|Daubert doctrine]] in ''R. v . J.-L.J.'' [2000] 2 S.C.R. 600, which upheld a lower court's decision to exclude testimony by a psychiatrist who had administered several tests on the accused, including a penile plethysmograph:

{{quote|A level of reliability that is quite useful in therapy because it yields some information about a course of treatment is not necessarily sufficiently reliable to be used in a court of law to identify or exclude the accused as a potential perpetrator of an offence. In fact, penile plethysmography has received a mixed reception in Quebec courts: ''Protection de la jeunesse'' – 539, [1992] R.J.Q. 1144; ''R. c. Blondin'', [1996] Q.J. No. 3605 (QL) (S.C.); L. Morin and C. Boisclair in "La preuve d'abus sexuel: allégations, déclarations et l'évaluation d'expert" (1992), 23 R.D.U.S. 27. Efforts to use penile plethysmography in the United States as proof of disposition have largely been rejected: ''People v. John W.'', 185 Cal.App.3d 801 (1986); ''Gentry v. State'', 443 S.E.2d 667 (Ga. Ct. App. 1994); ''United States v. Powers'', 59 F.3d 1460 (4th Cir. 1995); ''State v. Spencer'', 459 S.E.2d 812 (N.C. App. 1995); J. E. B.

As of 2010, all youth in sex offender treatment programs administered by the Youth Forensic Psychiatric Service of [[British Columbia]] were offered a voluntary penile plethysmograph test to predict whether they can properly control their deviant arousal, or whether they will require medication or other forms of treatment. According to sceptics, however, the test does not reliably predict recurrent violations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2010/07/29/adrian-macnair-b-c-government-rethinks-penis-arousal-tests/ Adrian MacNair: B.C. government rethinks penis-arousal tests (National Post, July 29, 2010)] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120711073409/http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2010/07/29/adrian-macnair-b-c-government-rethinks-penis-arousal-tests/ |date=July 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics and legality of use===
[[Robert Todd Carroll]] writes, "More objectionable than the questionable scientific validity of the device, however, are the moral and legal questions its use raises."&lt;ref name="todd2003"&gt;Carroll, Robert Todd (2003). Penile plethysmograph (PPG). ''The skeptic's dictionary: a collection of strange beliefs, amusing deceptions, and dangerous delusions,'' pp. 278-281. John Wiley and Sons, {{ISBN|978-0-471-27242-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll and others cite the legality of the depictions of minors, as well as the constitutionality of requiring PPG for admission to jobs or the military, or in custody cases. In ''Harrington v. Almy'' the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]] found that a PPG ordered to be administered by [[William O'Donohue]] as a precondition of employment was a violation of plaintiff's rights under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name="harrison"&gt;''Harrington v.

The EU's leading human rights agency, the Fundamental Rights Agency, has criticised the use of phallometric tests by the Czech Republic to determine whether asylum seekers presenting themselves as homosexual were in fact gay. According to the Agency, the Czech Republic was in 2010 the only EU country to employ a sexual arousal test, which the Agency said could violate the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11954499 Czech gay asylum 'phallometric test' criticised by EU (BBC, December 8, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the [[EU commission]] issued a statement calling the Czech practice illegal, saying "The practice of phallometric tests constitutes a strong interference with the person's private life and human dignity. This kind of degrading treatment should not be accepted in the European Union, nor elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;[http://euobserver.com/22/32349 Czech sexuality tests not legal, EU commission says (EUobserver, 17.05.2011)]&lt;/ref&gt; The Czech Interior Ministry replied that the testing was conducted only after written consent has been obtained, and when it was not possible to use a different method of verification. According to the Ministry, all those who had passed the test had been granted asylum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2010/12/08/czech_republic_defends_test_of_gay_asylum_seekers_despite_eu_criticism.html Czech Republic defends test of gay asylum seekers despite EU criticism (Thestar.com, Dec 08 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Planetary engineering''' is the application of [[technology]] for the purpose of influencing the global environments of a [[planet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| authorlink=Martyn J.

Perhaps the best-known type of planetary [[engineering]] is [[terraforming]], by which a planet's surface conditions are altered to be more like those of Earth. Planetary engineering is largely the realm of [[science fiction]] at present, although recent [[climate change]] on Earth shows that [[human]] technology can cause change on a global scale.

==Terraforming==
{{Main|Terraforming}}
Terraforming is the hypothetical process of deliberately modifying the atmosphere, [[temperature]], or environment of a planet, [[moon]], or other body to be similar to those of Earth in order to make it habitable by humans.

==Seeding==
Seeding is a term used for the process of introducing microbial or algae species on a planet or moon already offering habitable regions. Jupiter's moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] is a good example as it has a well protected ocean under a thick ice crust. Living on the surface of the ice crust is not possible, but some microorganisms from Earth could possibly survive in the oxygen rich environment of Europa's subsurface ocean. In the case of Europa it might be possible to incrementally seed with the species in their trophic (see foodchain) context and to build up an aquatic [[ecosystem]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Geoengineering==
{{Main|Climate engineering}}
Geoengineering is the application of planetary engineering techniques to Earth. Recent geoengineering proposals have principally been methods to tackle human-induced [[climate change]] by either removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (e.g. using [[ocean iron fertilization]]) or by managing solar radiation (e.g. by using mirrors in space) in order to negate the net warming effect of climate change.&lt;ref name = royal_society&gt;{{cite book

==Habitability maintenance==

Planetary engineering can also be applied to keep habitability of Earth in the far future. The rate of weathering of silicate minerals will increase as rising temperatures speed up chemical processes. This in turn will decrease the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, as these weathering processes convert carbon dioxide gas into solid carbonates. Within the next 600 million years from the present, the concentration of CO2 will fall below the critical threshold needed to sustain C3 photosynthesis: about 50 parts per million. At this point, trees and forests in their current forms will no longer be able to survive. Unlike other animal species, humankind has the potential ability to prolong the habitability of the planet Earth by extracting and re-injecting inert carbon trapped underground back into the biosphere.

'''Protistology''' is a scientific discipline devoted to the study of [[protists]], a highly diverse group of [[Microorganism#Eukaryotes|eukaryotic]] organisms. Its field of study overlaps with more traditional disciplines of [[phycology]], [[mycology]], and [[protozoology]], just as protists, which, being a [[paraphyletic group]] embrace [[algae]], some organisms regarded previously as primitive [[fungi]], and [[protozoa]] ("animal" motile protists lacking chloroplasts).

==History==
As the term "[[protozoology]]" has become dated as our understanding of the evolutionary relationships of the eukaryotes has improved, the term "protistology" become more common. For example, the Society of Protozoologists, founded in 1947, was renamed International Society of Protistologists in 2005. However, the older term persists in some cases (e.g., the Polish journal Acta Protozoologica).

==Journals and societies==
Dedicated academic journals include:&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, M., &amp; Hausmann, K. (2001). Protozoology from the perspective of science theory: history and concept of a biological discipline. ''Linzer biol.

[[File:Phenakistoscope 3g07690b.gif|thumb|Rhythm, a sequence in time repeated, featured in dance: an [[Phenakistoscope|early moving picture]] demonstrates the [[waltz]].]]

'''Rhythm''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ῥυθμός}}, ''rhythmos'', "any regular [[repetition (music)|recurring]] motion, [[symmetry#Symmetry in music|symmetry]]" {{harv|Liddell and Scott|1996}}) generally means a "[[motion (physics)|movement]] marked by the regulated succession of strong and weak elements, or of opposite or different conditions" {{harv|Anon.|1971|loc=2537}}. This general meaning of regular recurrence or pattern in time can apply to a wide variety of cyclical natural phenomena having a [[Frequency|periodicity]] or [[frequency]] of anything from microseconds to several seconds (as with the [[riff]] in a rock music song); to several minutes or hours, or, at the most extreme, even over many years.

In the [[performance arts]], rhythm is the timing of events on a human scale; of [[music|musical sounds and silences]] that occur over time, of the steps of a dance, or the meter of spoken [[language]] and poetry. In some performing arts, such as [[hip hop music]], the rhythmic delivery of the lyrics is one of the most important elements of the style. Rhythm may also refer to visual presentation, as "timed movement through space" {{harv|Jirousek|1995}} and a common language of [[pattern]] unites rhythm with geometry. In recent years, rhythm and meter have become an important area of research among music scholars. Recent work in these areas includes books by [[Maury Yeston|Maury]] {{harvtxt|Yeston|1976}}, [[Fred Lerdahl]] and [[Ray Jackendoff]] {{harv|Lerdahl and Jackendoff|1983}}, [[Jonathan Kramer]], Christopher {{harvtxt|Hasty|1997}}, [[Godfried Toussaint|Godfried]] {{harvtxt|Toussaint|2005}}, William {{harvtxt|Rothstein|1989}}, Joel Lester {{harv|Lester|1986}}, and [[Guerino Mazzola]].

==Anthropology==
[[File:Traditional indonesian instruments02.jpg|thumb|300px|Percussion instruments have clearly defined sounds that aid the creation and perception of complex rhythms]]

In his television series ''How Music Works'', [[Howard Goodall]] presents theories that human rhythm recalls the regularity with which we walk and the heartbeat {{harv|Goodall|2006|loc=0:03:10}}. Other research suggests that it does not relate to the heartbeat directly, but rather the speed of emotional affect, which also influences heartbeat. Yet other researchers suggest that since certain features of human music are widespread, it is "reasonable to suspect that beat-based rhythmic processing has ancient evolutionary roots" {{harv|Patel|2014|loc=1}}. Justin London writes that musical metre "involves our initial perception as well as subsequent anticipation of a series of beats that we abstract from the rhythm surface of the music as it unfolds in time" {{harv|London|2004|loc=4}}. The "perception" and "abstraction" of rhythmic measure is the foundation of human instinctive musical participation, as when we divide a series of identical clock-ticks into "tick-tock-tick-tock" ({{harvnb|Scholes|1977b}}; {{harvnb|Scholes|1977c}}).

[[File:Characteristic rock drum pattern.png|thumb|A simple [quadr][[duple meter|duple]] [[drum pattern]], which lays a foundation of duration common in popular music: {{Audio|Simple duple drum pattern.mid|Play}}.]]

[[Joseph Jordania]] recently suggested that the sense of rhythm was developed in the early stages of [[hominid]] evolution by the forces of [[natural selection]] {{harv|Jordania|2011|pg.99-101}}. Plenty of animals walk rhythmically and hear the sounds of the heartbeat in the womb, but only humans have the ability to be engaged ([[Entrainment (biomusicology)|entrained]]) in rhythmically coordinated vocalizations and other activities. According to Jordania, development of the sense of rhythm was central for the achievement of the specific neurological state of the [[battle trance]], crucial for the development of the effective [[defense (military)|defense]] system of early hominids. Rhythmic [[Battle cry|war cry]], rhythmic drumming by [[shaman]]s, rhythmic [[drilling]] of the soldiers and contemporary professional combat forces listening to the heavy rhythmic rock music {{harv|Pieslak|2009|loc={{Page needed|date=April 2016}}}} all use the ability of rhythm to unite human individuals into a shared [[collective identity]] where group members put the interests of the group above their individual interests and safety.

Some types of parrots can know rhythm {{harv|Anon.|2009}}. Neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]] states that [[chimpanzee]]s and other animals show no similar appreciation of rhythm yet posits that human affinity for rhythm is fundamental, so that a person's sense of rhythm cannot be lost (e.g. by stroke). "There is not a single report of an animal being trained to tap, peck, or move in synchrony with an auditory beat" ({{harvnb|Patel|2006}}, cited in {{harvnb|Sacks|2007|loc=239–40}}, who adds, "No doubt many pet lovers will dispute this notion, and indeed many animals, from the Lippizaner horses of the Spanish Riding School of Vienna to performing circus animals appear to 'dance' to music. It is not clear whether they are doing so or are responding to subtle visual or tactile cues from the humans around them.") Human rhythmic arts are possibly to some extent rooted in courtship ritual {{harv|Mithen|2005|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2014}}}}.

[[File:Compound triple drum pattern.png|thumb|right|Compound triple drum pattern: divides three beats into three. {{Audio|Compound triple drum pattern.mid|Play}} Contains repetition on three levels.]]

The establishment of a basic beat requires the perception of a regular sequence of distinct short-duration pulses and, as a subjective perception of loudness is relative to background noise levels, a pulse must decay to silence before the next occurs if it is to be really distinct. For this reason, the fast-transient sounds of percussion instruments lend themselves to the definition of rhythm. Musical cultures that rely upon such instruments may develop multi-layered [[polyrhythm]] and simultaneous rhythms in more than one time signature, called [[polymeter]]. Such are the [[Rhythm in Sub-Saharan African music|cross-rhythms of Sub-Saharan Africa]] and the [[Kotekan|interlocking ''kotekan'']] rhythms of the ''[[gamelan]]''.

For information on rhythm in [[Music of India|Indian music]] see [[Tala (music)]]. For other Asian approaches to rhythm see [[Rhythm in Persian music]], [[Rhythm in Arabian music]] and [[Usul (music)|''Usul''—Rhythm in Turkish music]] and [[Dumbek rhythms]].

==Terminology==

===Pulse, beat and measure===

''(See main articles; [[Pulse (music)]], [[Beat (music)]])''
[[File:Metric levels.svg|thumb|right|250px|[[Metric level]]s: beat level shown in middle with division levels above and multiple levels below.]]
Most music, dance and oral poetry establishes and maintains an underlying "metric level", a basic unit of time that may be audible or implied, the [[pulse (music)|pulse]] or ''tactus'' of the [[mensural level]] ({{harvnb|Berry|1987|loc=349}}; {{harvnb|Lerdahl and Jackendoff|1983}}; {{harvnb|Fitch and Rosenfeld|2007|loc=44}}), or ''beat level'', sometimes simply called the [[beat (music)|beat]]. This consists of a (repeating) series of identical yet distinct [[Frequency|periodic]] short-duration [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] perceived as points in time {{harv|Winold|1975|loc=213}}. The "beat" pulse is not necessarily the fastest or the slowest component of the rhythm but the one that is perceived as fundamental: it has a [[tempo]] to which listeners [[Entrainment (biomusicology)|entrain]] as they tap their foot or dance to a piece of music {{harv|Handel|1989}}. It is currently most often designated as a crotchet or [[quarter note]] in western notation (see [[time signature]]). Faster levels are ''division levels'', and slower levels are ''multiple levels'' {{harv|Winold|1975|loc=213}}. [[Maury Yeston]] clarified "Rhythms of recurrence" arise from the interaction of two levels of motion, the faster providing the pulse and the slower organizing the beats into repetitive groups {{harv|Yeston|1976|loc=50–52}}. "Once a metric hierarchy has been established, we, as listeners, will maintain that organization as long as minimal evidence is present" {{harv|Lester|1986|loc=77}}.

===Unit and gesture===
[[File:Rhythmic units.png|thumb|Rhythmic units: division level shown above and rhythmic units shown below {{audio|Rhythmic units.mid|Play}}.]]

A [[Duration (music)|durational pattern]] that synchronises with a [[pulse (music)|pulse]] or pulses on the underlying [[metric level]] may be called a ''rhythmic unit''. These may be classified as; ''metric''—even patterns, such as steady [[eighth note]]s or [[pulse (music)|pulses]]—''intrametric''—confirming patterns, such as [[dotted note|dotted]] [[eighth note|eighth]]-[[sixteenth note]] and [[swung note|swing]] patterns—''contrametric''—non-confirming, or [[syncopated]] patterns and ''extrametric''—irregular patterns, such as [[tuplet]]s.

A rhythmic gesture is any [[Duration (music)|durational pattern]] that, in contrast to the rhythmic unit, does not occupy a period of time equivalent to a [[pulse (music)|pulse]] or pulses on an underlying [[metric level]]. It may be described according to its beginning and ending or by the [[rhythmic unit]]s it contains. Beginnings on a strong pulse are ''thetic'', a weak pulse, ''anacrustic'' and those beginning after a rest or tied-over note are called ''initial rest''. Endings on a strong pulse are ''strong'', a weak pulse, ''weak'' and those that end on a strong or weak upbeat are ''upbeat'' {{harv|Winold|1975|loc=239}}.

===Alternation and repetition===
Rhythm is marked by the regulated succession of opposite elements, the [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]] of the [[Accent (music)|strong and weak]] beat, the played beat and the inaudible but implied [[rest (music)|rest beat]], the long and short note. As well as perceiving rhythm we must be able to anticipate it. This depends on [[repetition (music)|repetition]] of a pattern that is short enough to memorize.

The alternation of the strong and weak beat is fundamental to the ancient language of poetry, dance and music. The common [[Foot (prosody)|poetic term "foot"]] refers, as in dance, to the [[Arsis and thesis|lifting and tapping]] of the foot in time. In a similar way musicians speak of an [[Beat (music)#Upbeat|upbeat]] and a [[Beat (music)#Downbeat|downbeat]] and of the [[Beat (music)#On-beat and off-beat|"on" and "off" beat]]. These contrasts naturally facilitate a dual hierarchy of rhythm and depend on repeating patterns of duration, accent and rest forming a "pulse-group" that corresponds to the [[foot (poetry)|poetic foot]]. Normally such pulse-groups are defined by taking the most accented beat as the first and [[counting (music)|counting]] the pulses until the next accent ({{harvnb|MacPherson|1930|loc=5}}; {{harvnb|Scholes|1977b}}). A rhythm that accents another beat and de-emphasises the downbeat as established or assumed from the melody or from a preceding rhythm is called [[Syncopation|syncopated]] rhythm.

Normally, even the most complex of meters may be broken down into a chain of duple and triple pulses ({{harvnb|MacPherson|1930|loc=5}}; {{harvnb|Scholes|1977b}}) either by [[Additive and divisive rhythm|addition or division]]. According to [[Pierre Boulez]], beat structures beyond four, in western music, are "simply not natural" {{harv|Slatkin|n.d.|loc=at 5:05}}.

===Tempo and duration===
''(See main articles; [[Duration (music)]], [[Tempo]])''

The tempo of the piece is the speed or frequency of the ''tactus'', a measure of how quickly the beat flows. This is often measured in 'beats per minute' ([[Tempo|bpm]]): 60&amp;nbsp;bpm means a speed of one beat per second, a frequency of 1&amp;nbsp;Hz. A [[rhythmic unit]] is a durational pattern that has a period equivalent to a [[pulse (music)|pulse]] or several pulses {{harv|Winold|1975|loc=237}}. The duration of any such unit is inversely related to its tempo.

Musical sound may be analyzed on five different time scales, which Moravscik has arranged in order of increasing duration {{harv|Moravcsik|2002|loc=114}}.
*Supershort: a single cycle of an audible wave, approximately {{frac|1|30}}–{{frac|1|10,000}} second (30–10,000&amp;nbsp;Hz or more than 1,800&amp;nbsp;bpm). These, though rhythmic in nature, are not perceived as separate events but as continuous [[pitch (music)|musical pitch]].
*Short: of the order of one second (1&amp;nbsp;Hz, 60&amp;nbsp;bpm, 10–100,000 audio cycles). Musical tempo is generally specified in the range 40 to 240 beats per minute. A continuous pulse cannot be perceived as a musical beat if it is faster than 8–10 per second (8–10&amp;nbsp;Hz, 480–600&amp;nbsp;bpm) or slower than 1 per 1.5–2 seconds (0.6–0.5&amp;nbsp;Hz, 40–30&amp;nbsp;bpm). Too fast a beat becomes a [[drone (music)|drone]], too slow a succession of sounds seems unconnected ({{harvnb|Fraisse|1956}}{{Page needed|date=July 2014}}; {{harvnb|Woodrow|1951}}{{Page needed|date=July 2014}}, both quoted in {{harvnb|Covaciu-Pogorilowski|n.d.}}). This time-frame roughly corresponds to the human [[heart rate]] and to the duration of a single step, syllable or [[rhythmic gesture]].
*Medium: ≥ few seconds, This median durational level "defines rhythm in music" {{harv|Moravcsik|2002|loc=114}} as it allows the definition of a rhythmic unit, the arrangement of an entire sequence of accented, unaccented and silent or "[[rest (music)|rest]]" pulses into the [[cell (music)|cells]] of a ''measure'' that may give rise to the "briefest intelligible and self-existent musical unit" {{harv|Scholes|1977c}}, a ''[[motif (music)|motif]]'' or ''[[figure (music)|figure]]''. This may be further organized, by repetition and variation, into a definite ''phrase'' that may characterise an entire genre of music, dance or poetry and that may be regarded as the fundamental formal unit of music ({{harvnb|MacPherson|1930}}, {{Page needed|date=July 2014}}).
*Long: ≥ many seconds or a minute, corresponding to a durational unit that "consists of musical phrases" {{harv|Moravcsik|2002|loc=114}}—which may make up a melody, a formal section, a poetic [[stanza]] or a characteristic [[Sequence dance|sequence]] of [[Dance move|dance moves and steps]]. Thus the temporal regularity of musical organisation includes the most elementary levels of [[form (music)|musical form]] {{harv|MacPherson|1930|loc=3}}.
*Very long: ≥ minutes or many hours, musical compositions or subdivisions of compositions.

[[Curtis Roads]] {{harv|Roads|2001}} takes a wider view by distinguishing nine-time scales, this time in order of decreasing duration. The first two, the [[Infinity|infinite]] and the supra musical, encompass natural periodicities of months, years, decades, centuries, and greater, while the last three, the [[sample (music)|sample]] and subsample, which take account of digital and electronic rates "too brief to be properly recorded or perceived", measured in millionths of seconds ([[microsecond]]s), and finally the [[infinitesimal]] or infinitely brief, are again in the extra-musical domain. Roads' Macro level, encompassing "overall musical architecture or [[musical form|form]]" roughly corresponds to Moravcsik's "very long" division while his Meso level, the level of "divisions of form" including [[movement (music)|movements]], [[section (music)|sections]], [[phrase (music)|phrases]] taking seconds or minutes, is likewise similar to Moravcsik's "long" category. Roads' [[Sound object]] ({{harvnb|Schaeffer|1959}}; {{harvnb|Schaeffer|1977}}): "a basic unit of musical structure" and a generalization of [[note (music)|note]] (Xenakis' mini structural time scale); fraction of a second to several seconds, and his [[Microsound]] (see [[granular synthesis]]) down to the threshold of audible perception; thousands to millionths of seconds, are similarly comparable to Moravcsik's "short" and "supershort" levels of duration.

===Metric structure===
''(See main articles; [[Metre (music)]], [[Bar (music)]], [[Metre (poetry)]])''

[[File:Claves-detail.gif|thumb|left|300px|Notation of a [[Clave (rhythm)|clave rhythm pattern]]: Each cell of the grid corresponds to a fixed duration of time with a resolution fine enough to capture the timing of the pattern, which may be counted as two bars of four beats in divisive (metrical or symmetrical) rhythm, each beat divided into two cells. The first bar of the pattern may also usefully be counted additively (in measured or [[asymmetrical rhythm]]) as {{serif|'''3 + 3 + 2'''}}.]]

The study of rhythm, stress, and [[pitch (music)|pitch]] in [[Speech communication|speech]] is called [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] (see also: [[prosody (music)]]): it is a topic in [[linguistics]] and [[poetics]], where it means the number of lines in a [[verse (poetry)|verse]], the number of syllables in each line and the arrangement of those syllables as long or short, accented or unaccented. Music inherited the term "[[Meter (music)|meter or metre]]" from the terminology of poetry ({{harvnb|Scholes|1977b}}; {{harvnb|Scholes|1977c}}; {{harvnb|Latham|2002}}).

The metric structure of music includes meter, tempo and all other rhythmic aspects that produce temporal regularity against which the foreground details or [[Duration (music)|durational patterns]] of the music are projected ({{harvnb|Winold|1975|loc=209-10}}). The terminology of western music is notoriously imprecise in this area {{harv|Scholes|1977b}}. {{harvnb|MacPherson|1930|loc=3}} preferred to speak of "time" and "rhythmic shape", Imogen Holst {{harv|Holst|1963|loc=17}} of "measured rhythm".

Dance music has instantly recognizable patterns of beats built upon a characteristic tempo and measure. The Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing defines the [[Tango music|tango]], for example, as to be danced in {{music|time|2|4}} time at approximately 66 beats per minute. The basic slow step forwards or backwards, lasting for one beat, is called a "slow", so that a full "right–left" step is equal to one {{music|time|2|4}} measure {{harv|Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing|1977|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2014}}}} (''See [[Rhythm and dance]]'').

[[File:clavepattern.svg|thumb|right|300px|Notation of three measures of a clave pattern preceded by one measure of steady quarter notes. This pattern is noted in [[double time]] relative to the one above, in one instead of two four-beat measures {{audio|clave pattern.ogg|Four beats followed by three Clave patterns}}.]]

The general classifications of ''metrical rhythm'', ''measured rhythm'', and ''free rhythm'' may be distinguished {{harv|Cooper|1973|loc=30}}. Metrical or divisive rhythm, by far the most common in Western music calculates each time value as a multiple or fraction of the beat. Normal accents re-occur regularly providing systematical grouping (measures). Measured rhythm ([[additive rhythm]]) also calculates each time value as a multiple or fraction of a specified time unit but the accents do not recur regularly within the cycle. Free rhythm is where there is neither {{harv|Cooper|1973|loc=30}}, such as in Christian [[chant]], which has a basic pulse but a freer rhythm, like the rhythm of prose compared to that of verse {{harv|Scholes|1977c}}. ''See [[Free time (music)]]''.

Finally some music, such as some graphically scored works since the 1950s and non-European music such as [[Honkyoku]] repertoire for [[shakuhachi]], may be considered ''ametric'' {{harv|Karpinski|2000|loc=19}}. ''Senza misura'' is an Italian musical term for "without meter", meaning to play without a beat, using time to measure how long it will take to play the bar ({{harvnb|Forney and Machlis|2007}}{{Page needed|date=December 2009}}).

==Composite rhythm==&lt;!--[[Composite rhythm]] redirects directly here--&gt;

[[File:Bach, Sinfonia in F minor BWV 795, mm. 1-3a composite rhythm.png|thumb|right|350px|[[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s ''[[Inventions and Sinfonias|Sinfonia in F minor]]'' BWV 795, mm. 1-3 {{audio|Bach, Sinfonia in F minor BWV 795, mm. 1-3a.mid|Play original}} {{audio|Bach, Sinfonia in F minor BWV 795, mm. 1-3a composite rhythm.mid|Play with composite}}.]]

A ''composite rhythm'' is the [[duration (music)|durations]] and patterns (rhythm) produced by amalgamating all sounding [[part (music)|parts]] of a musical [[texture (music)|texture]]. In music of the [[common practice period]], the composite rhythm usually confirms the [[meter (music)|meter]], often in [[meter (music)|metric]] or even-note patterns identical to the [[pulse (music)|pulse]] on a specific metric level. White defines ''composite rhythm'' as, "the resultant overall rhythmic [[articulation (music)|articulation]] among all the voices of a [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] texture" {{harv|White|1976|loc=136.}}. This concept was concurrently defined as “attack point rhythm” by [[Maury Yeston]] in 1976 as “the extreme rhythmic foreground of a composition – the absolute surface of articulated movement” {{harv|Yeston|1976|loc=41-42}}.

==Rhythm notation==
Worldwide there are many different approaches to passing on rhythmic phrases and patterns, as they exist in traditional music, from generation to generation.

==Educational literature/Advanced training courses==
In the western academic world several schools and training courses have been developed since the 1960s according to national tradition and educational policy. Amongst the few methods and learning programmes for music colleges, universities and conservatoires that are employed on an international scale it is worthy mentioning the following books:
*''Maat en Ritme'', by Horst F. Van Der (1963), published by [https://www.broekmans.com/NL/Bladmuziek/Resultaat [[Broekmans &amp; Van Poppel]]], {{ISBN|9789491906008}}. A collection of graded exercises in two volumes, from elementary to advanced level.
*''Die Kunst des Rhythmus'', by Peter Giger (1993), published by [https://de.schott-music.com/shop/die-kunst-des-rhythmus.html Schott], {{ISBN|978-3-7957-1862-6}}. A theoretical approach to western and non-western rhythms.
*''Rhythm to go'', by [[John Palmer (composer)|John Palmer]] (2013), published by [https://web.archive.org/web/20161229164625/https://visionedition.com/index.php/en/rhythm-to-go Vision Edition] and distributed by [http://composersedition.com/john-palmer-rhythm-to-go CE Books], ISMN 979-0-9002315-1-2. A fast-track collection of graded exercises from elementary to advanced level divided in four sections and including an additional chapter with rhythmic structures used in contemporary music.

===African music===
[[File:Diffa Niger Griot DSC 0177.jpg|thumb|right|170px|A Griot performs at Diffa, Niger, West Africa. The Griot is playing a Ngoni or Xalam.]]
In the [[Griot]] tradition of Africa everything related to music has been passed on orally. [[Babatunde Olatunji]] (1927–2003) developed a simple series of spoken sounds for teaching the rhythms of the hand-drum, using six vocal sounds, "Goon, Doon, Go, Do, Pa, Ta", for three basic sounds on the drum, each played with either the left or the right hand.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} The debate about the appropriateness of staff notation for African music is a subject of particular interest to outsiders while African scholars from Kyagambiddwa to Kongo have, for the most part, accepted the conventions and limitations of staff notation, and produced transcriptions to inform and enable discussion and debate {{harv|Agawu|2003|loc=52}}.

John Miller {{harvnb|Chernoff|1979}} has argued that West African music is based on the tension between rhythms, [[polyrhythms]] created by the simultaneous sounding of two or more different rhythms, generally one dominant rhythm interacting with one or more independent competing rhythms. These often oppose or complement each other and the dominant rhythm. Moral values underpin a musical system based on repetition of relatively simple patterns that meet at distant [[Cross-beat|cross-rhythmic]] intervals and on [[Call and response (music)|call-and-response form]]. Collective utterances such as proverbs or lineages appear either in phrases translated into "drum talk" or in the words of songs. People expect musicians to stimulate participation by reacting to people dancing. Appreciation of musicians is related to the effectiveness of their upholding community values {{harv|Chernoff|1979|}}{{Page needed|date=July 2014}}.

===Indian music===
{{See also|Bol (music)}}
Indian music has also been passed on orally. Tabla players would learn to speak complex rhythm patterns and phrases before attempting to play them. [[Sheila Chandra]], an English pop singer of Indian descent, made performances based on her singing these patterns. In [[Indian Classical music]], the [[Tala (music)|Tala]] of a composition is the rhythmic pattern over which the whole piece is structured.

===Western music===
In the 20th century, composers like [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Béla Bartók]], [[Philip Glass]], and [[Steve Reich]] wrote more rhythmically complex music using [[List of works in unusual time signatures|odd meters]], and techniques such as [[Phasing (music)|phasing]] and [[additive rhythm]]. At the same time, modernists such as [[Olivier Messiaen]] and his pupils used increased complexity to disrupt the sense of a regular beat, leading eventually to the widespread use of [[irrational rhythm]]s in [[New Complexity]]. This use may be explained by a comment of [[John Cage]]'s where he notes that regular rhythms cause sounds to be heard as a group rather than individually; the irregular rhythms highlight the rapidly changing pitch relationships that would otherwise be subsumed into irrelevant rhythmic groupings {{harv|Sandow|2004|loc=257}}. [[LaMonte Young]] also wrote music in which the sense of a regular beat is absent because the music consists only of long sustained tones ([[drone (music)|drones]]). In the 1930s, [[Henry Cowell]] wrote music involving multiple simultaneous periodic rhythms and collaborated with [[Léon Thérémin]] to invent the [[Rhythmicon]], the first electronic [[Drum machine|rhythm machine]], in order to perform them. Similarly, [[Conlon Nancarrow]] wrote for the [[player piano]].

==Linguistics==
{{Main article|Isochrony}}
In [[linguistics]], rhythm or isochrony is one of the three aspects of [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], along with [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] and [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]. Languages can be categorized according to whether they are syllable-timed, mora-timed, or stress-timed. Speakers of syllable-timed languages such as Spanish and [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]] put roughly equal time on each syllable; in contrast, speakers of stressed-timed languages such as English and [[Mandarin Chinese]] put roughly equal time lags between stressed syllables, with the timing of the unstressed syllables in between them being adjusted to accommodate the stress timing.

{{harvnb|Narmour|1977}} (cited in {{harvnb|Winold|1975}}, {{Page needed|date=July 2014}}) describes three categories of prosodic rules that create rhythmic successions that are additive (same duration repeated), cumulative (short-long), or countercumulative (long-short). Cumulation is associated with closure or relaxation, countercumulation with openness or tension, while additive rhythms are open-ended and repetitive. Richard Middleton points out this method cannot account for [[syncopation]] and suggests the concept of [[Transformation (music)|transformation]] ({{harvnb|Middleton|1990}}, {{Page needed|date=July 2014}}).

==In popular culture==

In day-to-day, figurative language, there are several non-music related uses of the word "rhythm". For example, a person may describe the rhythm of the workday in a certain company or occupation, or the rhythm of life in a certain country or region. In these contexts, the meaning of rhythm is often confused with the concept of "[[Tempo (music)|tempo]]", with people erroneously referring to a certain rhythm as being "slow" or "fast". Speed (tempo) cannot be a specification for a certain rhythm, as the same rhythm can occur at any tempo. A certain tempo compares to other tempi by the difference in speed, whereas a certain rhythm compares to other rhythms by the difference in structure.

[[Image:Ruderal community Dittrichia viscosa on gravel01.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A single-species ruderal community of ''[[Dittrichia viscosa]]'' on gravel near [[Petah Tikva]]-Sgula railway station, [[Israel]]. (Compare with mixed-species image below.)]]

A '''ruderal species''' is a [[plant]] [[species]] that is first to colonize disturbed lands. The disturbance may be natural{{spaced ndash}} for example, [[wildfire]]s or [[Landslide|avalanche]]s{{spaced ndash}}or a consequence of human activity, such as construction ([[Road construction|of roads]], [[building construction|of buildings]], [[mining]], etc.) or agriculture (abandoned fields, [[irrigation]], etc.).

The word ''[[Wikt:ruderal|ruderal]]'' comes from the Latin ''rudus'' [[rubble]].

Ruderal species typically dominate the disturbed area for a few years, gradually losing the [[Competition (biology)|competition]] to other native species. However, in extreme disturbance circumstances, such as when the natural [[topsoil]] is covered with a foreign substance, a single-species ruderal community may become permanently established, as depicted in the image on the right. In addition, some ruderal [[invasive species]] may have such a competitive advantage over the native species that they, too, may permanently prevent a disturbed area from returning to its original state despite natural topsoil.

== Features ==

Features contributing to a species' success as ruderal are:
* Massive seed production
* [[Germination|Seedling]]s whose [[Plant nutrition|nutritional]] requirements are modest
* Fast-growing roots{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}
* Independence of [[mycorrhizae]]{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}
* [[Polyploidy]]

==Quantification==

Ecologists have proposed various scales for quantifying ruderality, which can be defined as the "ability to thrive where there is disturbance through partial or total destruction of plant biomass" (Grime, Hodgson &amp; Hunt, 1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hill, M.O. |author2=Roy, D.B. |author3=Thompson, K. |year=2002 |title=Hemeroby, urbanity and ruderality: bioindicators of disturbance and human impact |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=708–720 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2664.2002.00746.x |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2664.2002.00746.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruderality scale of [[J. Philip Grime|Grime]] presents values that are readily available, and it takes into account disturbance factors as well as other indicators such as the annual or perennial character of the plants.

[[File:Sea foam at Ocean Beach in San Francisco -1 on 3-25-11.jpg|thumb|300px| {{center|Sea foam washed up or blown onto a beach}}]]

'''Sea foam''', ocean foam, beach foam, or spume is a type of [[foam]] created by the agitation of [[seawater]], particularly when it contains higher concentrations of [[dissolved organic matter]] (including [[Protein|proteins]], [[Lignin|lignins]], and [[Lipid|lipids]]) derived from sources such as the offshore breakdown of [[Algal bloom|algal blooms]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1 October 2011|title=Foam in the aquatic environment|url=|journal=Water Research|language=en|volume=45|issue=15|pages=4355–4366|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2011.06.004|issn=0043-1354|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These compounds can act as [[Surfactant|surfactants]] or [[Foaming agent|foaming agents]]. As the seawater is churned by [[Breaking wave|breaking waves]] in the [[surf zone]] adjacent to the shore, the surfactants under these turbulent conditions trap air, forming persistent [[bubble (physics)|bubbles]] that stick to each other through [[surface tension]]. Sea foam is a global phenomenon&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and it varies depending on location and the potential influence of the surrounding marine, freshwater, and/or terrestrial environments.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=HAROLD|first=E.|last2=SCHLICHTING|first2=JR.|date=1971|title=A Preliminary Study of the Algae and Protozoa in Seafoam|url=|journal=Botanica Marina|volume=14|issue=1|pages=|doi=10.1515/botm.1971.14.1.24|issn=0006-8055|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its low density and persistence, foam can be blown by strong on-shore winds from the beach face inland.

== Formation ==
[[File:Sea spray sea foam connection.png|thumb|600px| {{center|Connection between sea foam and [[sea spray]] formation. The dark orange line indicates processes common to the formation of both [[sea spray]] and sea foam.}}]]

Sea foam is formed under conditions that are similar to the formation of [[sea spray]]. One of the main distinctions from sea spray formation is the presence of higher concentrations of dissolved organic matter from [[macrophytes]] and [[phytoplankton]]. The dissolved organic matter in the surface water, which can be derived from the natural environment or human-made sources, provides stability to the resulting sea foam.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Velimirov|first=B.|date=1980|title=Formation and potential trophic significance of marine foam near kelp beds in the benguela upwelling system|url=|journal=Marine Biology|volume=58|issue=4|pages=311–318|doi=10.1007/bf00390779|issn=0025-3162|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physical processes that contribute to sea foam formation are breaking [[Surface wave|surface waves]], bubble entrainment, and whitecap formation. Breaking of surface waves injects air from the atmosphere into the water column, leading to bubble creation. These bubbles get transported around the top few meters of the surface ocean due to their [[buoyancy]]. The smallest bubbles entrained in the water column dissolve entirely leading to higher ratios of dissolved gases in the surface ocean. The bubbles that do not dissolve eventually make it back to the surface. As they rise, these bubbles accumulate [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] substances. Presence of dissolved organic matter stabilizes the bubbles, aggregating together as sea foam.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some studies on sea foam report that breaking of algal cells in times of heavy swells makes sea foam production more likely.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Falling rain drops on the sea surface can also contribute to sea foam formation and destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Veron|first=Fabrice|date=2015-01-03|title=Ocean Spray|url=|journal=Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics|language=en|volume=47|issue=1|pages=507–538|doi=10.1146/annurev-fluid-010814-014651|issn=0066-4189|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been some non-mechanistic studies demonstrating increased sea foam formation due to high rainfall events.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Turbulence in the surface mixed layer can affect the concentration of dissolved organic matter and aids in the formation of nutrient-dense foam.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Craig|first=Douglas|last2=Ireland|first2=Robert J.|last3=Bärlocher|first3=Felix|date= September 1989|title=Seasonal variation in the organic composition of seafoam|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology|volume=130|issue=1|pages=71–80|doi=10.1016/0022-0981(89)90019-1|issn=0022-0981|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==
[[File:Brandung (MW 2015.02.27.).JPG|thumb|Sea foam usually contains a mixture of decomposed organic materials]]

The composition of sea foam is generally a mixture of decomposed organic materials, including [[zooplankton]], [[phytoplankton]], [[algae]] (including [[Diatom|diatoms]]&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Druzhkov|first=Nikolai V.|last2=Makarevich|first2=Pavel R.|last3=Bardan|first3=Sergei I.|date=12 January 1997|title=Sea foam as an object of sea-surface film studies|url=|journal=Polar Research|language=en|volume=16|issue=2|pages=117–121|doi=10.3402/polar.v16i2.6630|issn=1751-8369|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[bacteria]], [[Fungus|fungi]], [[Protozoa|protozoans]], and vascular plant [[detritus]],&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; though each occurrence of sea foam varies in its specific contents. In some areas, sea foam is found to be made up of primarily [[protein]], dominant in both fresh and old foam, as well as [[Lipid|lipids]] and [[Carbohydrate|carbohydrates]]. The high protein and low carbohydrate concentration suggest that [[Sugar|sugars]] originally present in the surrounding mucilage created by algae or plant matter has been quickly consumed by bacteria.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Additional research has shown that between a small fraction of sea foam measured by dry weight is [[organic carbon]], which contains [[Phenols|phenolics]], sugars, [[Amino sugar|amino sugars]], and [[Amino acid|amino acids]]. In the [[Bay of Fundy]], high mortality rates of an abundant tube-dwelling [[Amphipoda|amphipod]] (''Corophium volutator)'' by natural die-offs as well as predation by migrating seabirds contributed to amino sugars released in the surrounding environment and thus, in sea foam.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The organic matter in sea foam has been found to increase dramatically during [[Algal bloom|phytoplankton blooms]] in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Dowd|first=Colin|last2=Ceburnis|first2=Darius|last3=Ovadnevaite|first3=Jurgita|last4=Bialek|first4=Jakub|last5=Stengel|first5=Dagmar B.|last6=Zacharias|first6=Merry|last7=Nitschke|first7=Udo|last8=Connan|first8=Solene|last9=Rinaldi|first9=Matteo|date=2015-10-14|title=Connecting marine productivity to sea-spray via nanoscale biological processes: Phytoplankton Dance or Death Disco?|url=|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=5|pages=14883|doi=10.1038/srep14883|issn=2045-2322|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research has shown very high concentrations of [[Plankton|microplankton]] in sea foam, with significantly higher numbers of [[Autotroph|autotrophic]] phytoplankton than [[Heterotroph|heterotrophs]]&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Some foams are particularly rich in their diatom population which can make up the majority of the microalgal [[biomass]] in some cases.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A diversity of bacteria is also present in sea foam; old foam tends to have a higher density of bacteria. One study found that 95% of sea foam bacteria was rod-shaped, while the surrounding surface water contained mostly coccoid-form bacteria and only 5% - 10% rod-shaped bacteria.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There is also seasonal variability of sea foam composition;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; in some regions there is a seasonal occurrence of pollen in sea foam which can alter its chemistry.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Though foam is not inherently toxic, it may contain high concentrations of contaminants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Foam bubbles can be coated with or contain these materials which can include [[petroleum]] compounds, [[Pesticide|pesticides]], and [[Herbicide|herbicides]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Longevity and stability ==
[[File:Sea Foam off Amphitrite Point near Ucluelet.webm|thumb|Sea foam off [[Vancouver Island]]]]

Structurally, sea foam is [[Thermodynamically stable|thermodynamically]] unstable, though some sea foam can persist in the environment for several days at most. There are two types of sea foam categorized based on their stability: 1) Unstable or transient foams have very short lifetimes of only seconds. The bubbles formed in sea foam may burst releasing aerosols into the air, contributing to [[sea spray]]. 2) Metastable foams can have a lifetime of several hours to several days; their duration is sometimes attributed to small particles of [[Silicate|silica]], [[calcium]], or [[iron]] which contribute to foam stability and longevity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, seawater that contains released dissolved organic material from phytoplankton and macrophytic algae that is then agitated in its environment is most likely to produce stable, longer-lasting foam when compared with seawater lacking one of those components. For example, filtered seawater with added with the fronds of the [[kelp]], ''Ecklonia maxima,'' produced foam but it lacked the stability that unfiltered seawater provided. Additionally, kelp fronds that were maintained in flowing water therefore reducing their [[mucus]] coating, were unable to help foam form.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Different types of salt are also found to have varying effects on bubble proximity within sea foam, therefore contributing to its stability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Ecological role ==

=== Food source ===
[[File:Plankton creates sea foam 2.jpg|thumb| Bubbles of plankton-enriched foam left in a [[tide pool]] after [[high tide]]]]

The presence of sea foam in the marine environment plays a number of ecological roles including providing sources of food and creating habitat. As a food source, sea foam with a stable composition is more important ecologically, as it is able to persist longer and can transport nutrients within the marine environment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Longer decay times result in a higher chance that energy contained in sea foam will move up the food web into higher [[trophic level]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;In the Bay of Fundy for example, a tube-dwelling [[Amphipoda|amphipod]], ''Corophium volutator,'' can potentially attain 70% of its nutritional requirements from the sugars and amino acids derived from sea foam in its environment. At times however, the sea foam was found to be toxic to this species. It is thought that high concentrations of [[Phenols|phenolics]] and/or the occasional presence of heavy metals or pesticides incorporated into the sea foam from the sea surface contributed to its toxicity.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; On the west coast of [[Cape Peninsula]], [[South Africa]], sea foam often occurs in nearshore marine areas with large kelp beds during periods of strong westerly winds. It is thought that the foam generated in these conditions is an important food source for local organisms due to the presence of organic [[detritus]] in the sea foam.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Material transport ===
Sea foam also acts as a mode of transport for both organisms and nutrients within the marine environment and, at times, into the [[Intertidal zone|intertidal]] or terrestrial environments. Wave action can deposit foam into intertidal areas where it can remain when the tide recedes, bringing nutrients to the intertidal zone.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Additionally, sea foam can become airborne in windy conditions, transporting materials between marine and terrestrial environments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The ability of sea foam to transport materials is also thought to benefit [[Seaweed|macroalgal]] organisms, as macroalgae propagules can be carried to different microenvironments, thus influencing the tidal landscape and contributing to new possible ecological interactions.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meneses|first=Isabel|date=June 1993|title=Foam as a dispersal agent in the rocky intertidal of central Chile|url=|journal=European Journal of Phycology|language=en|volume=28|issue=2|pages=107–110|doi=10.1080/09670269300650171|issn=0967-0262|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As sea foam is a wet environment, it is conducive habitat to algal spores where [[Propagule|propagules]] can attach to the substrate and avoid risk of [[dissemination]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; When sea foam contains fungi, it can also aid in the decomposition of plant and animal remains in coastal ecosystems.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Habitat ===
Additionally, sea foam is a habitat for a number of marine [[Microorganism|microorganisms]]. Some research has shown the presence of various microphytoplanktonic, nanophytoplanktonic, and diatom groups in seafoam; the phytoplankton groups appeared in significantly higher abundance than in sea surface film and the top [[pelagic zone]]&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Hazards==

=== Toxicity ===
Naturally occurring sea foam is not inherently [[Toxicity|toxic]]; however, it can be exposed to high concentrations of contaminants in the surface microlayer derived from the breakdown of algal blooms, fossil fuel production and transport, and stormwater runoff.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These contaminants contribute to the formation of noxious sea foam through [[adsorption]] onto bubbles. Bubbles may burst and release toxins into the atmosphere in the form of sea spray or [[aerosol]], or they may persist in foams. Toxins released through aerosols and breaking bubbles can be inhaled by humans. The microorganisms that occupy sea foams as habitat have increased susceptibility for contaminant exposure.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Napolitano|first=Guillermo E.|last2=Richmond|first2=Jacqueline E.|date=February 1995|title=Enrichment of biogenic lipids, hydrocarbons and PCBs in stream-surface foams|url=|journal=Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry|language=en|volume=14|issue=2|pages=197–201|doi=10.1002/etc.5620140203|issn=0730-7268|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, these toxic substances can be integrated into the trophic [[food web]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Harmful algal blooms ===
Foams can form following the degradation of [[Harmful algal bloom|harmful algal blooms]] (HABs). These are primarily composed of algal species, but can also consist of [[Dinoflagellate|dinoflagellates]] and [[cyanobacteria]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blauw|first=A.N.|last2=Los|first2=F.J.|last3=Huisman|first3=J.|last4=Peperzak|first4=L.|date=November 2010|title=Nuisance foam events and Phaeocystis globosa blooms in Dutch coastal waters analyzed with fuzzy logic|url=|journal=Journal of Marine Systems|volume=83|issue=3-4|pages=115–126|doi=10.1016/j.jmarsys.2010.05.003|issn=0924-7963|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biomass from algae in the bloom is integrated into sea foam in the sea surface microlayer.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; When the impacted sea foam breaks down, toxins from the algae are released into the air causing respiratory issues and occasionally initiating asthma attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/why_habs.html|title=Why do harmful algal blooms occur?|last=Administration|first=US Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric|website=oceanservice.noaa.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Phaeocystis globosa'' is one algal species that is considered problematic, as observed in a study in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Its high biomass accumulation allows it to create large quantities of toxic foam that often wash onto beaches. ''P. globosa'' blooms are initiated in areas of high nutrient availability, often affiliated with coastal locations with a lot of stormwater runoff and [[eutrophication]]. Studies suggest that the development of foam is directly correlated to blooms caused by ''P. globosa'', despite that foam formation typically occurs approximately two weeks after the appearance of an algal bloom offshore. Organic material from ''P. globosa'' was observed decomposing while suspended at the sea surface, but was not observed lower in the water column. ''P. globosa'' is also considered a nuisance species because its large foam formations impair the public's ability to enjoy the beach.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Human activities ===
While sea foam is a common result of the agitation of seawater mixing with organic material in the surface ocean, human activities can contribute to the production of excess and often toxic foam.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition to the organic oils, acids, and proteins that amass in the [[sea surface microlayer]], compounds derived from petroleum production and transport, synthetic surfactants, and pesticide use can enter the sea surface and be incorporated into foam. The pollutants present can also affect the persistence of the foam produced. Crude oil discharged from tankers, motor oil, sewage, and detergents from polluted runoff can create longer-lasting foams.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In one study, [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|polychlorinated biphenyls]] (PCBs), a persistent organic pollutant, were found to amass in sea foams.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

[[Natural gas]] terminals have been cited as contributors to the production of modified foams due to the process of using seawater to convert natural gas to [[Liquefied natural gas|liquified natural gas]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Franzo|first=Annalisa|last2=Karuza|first2=Ana|last3=Celussi|first3=Mauro|last4=Fornasaro|first4=Daniela|last5=Beran|first5=Alfred|last6=Di Poi|first6=Elena|last7=Del Negro|first7=Paola|date=2015-04-17|title=Foam production as a side effect of an offshore liquefied natural gas terminal: how do plankton deal with it?|url=|journal=Environmental Science and Pollution Research|language=en|volume=22|issue=11|pages=8763–8772|doi=10.1007/s11356-015-4499-2|issn=0944-1344|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study showed a much greater abundance of heterotrophic [[Prokaryote|prokaryotes]] (archaea and bacteria) and cyanobacteria in foam that was generated near a liquified natural gas terminal. These prokaryotes were able to recycle chemical materials discharged from the terminal, which enhanced microbial growth. Additionally, higher levels of [[total organic carbon]] (TOC) and plankton biomass were recorded in foam generated in close proximity to the terminal. Organic carbon was transferred readily into the pelagic food web after uptake by prokaryotes and ingestion by grazers.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

{{Sociology}}
'''Sociology of disaster''' is a special branch of [[sociology]].  The research is predominantly done in the United States, Germany and Italy.  Theoretically, it includes not only local [[disaster]]s, but catastrophes on a grand scale. The field is closely linked with [[environmental sociology]] and [[sociocultural anthropology]].

== Overview ==
Many studies in the field of sociology of disaster focus on the link between social [[solidarity]] and the vulnerabilities exposed by disasters. Scholarship in this field has observed how such events can produce both social solidarity&lt;ref&gt;Barton AH. 1969. Communities in Disaster: A Sociological Analysis of Collective Stress. Garden City, NY: Doubleday&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drabek TE. 1986. Human System Responses to Disaster. New York: Springer-Verlag&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dynes RR. 1970. Organized Behavior in Disaster. Lexington, MA: Lexington Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor VA. 1977. Good news about disasters. Psychol. Today 5:93-94&lt;/ref&gt; and social conflict,&lt;ref&gt;Barry JM. 1997. Rising Tide: The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 and How It Changed America. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bolton M. 1997. Recovery for whom? Social conflict after the San Francisco earthquake and fire, 1906-1915. PhD thesis. Univ. Calif., Davis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fradkin P. 2005. The Great Earthquake and Firestorms of 1906: How San Francisco Nearly Destroyed Itself. Berkeley: Univ. Calif. Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson AD. 2005. Reconstructing home: gender, disaster relief, and social life after the San Francisco earthquake and fire, 1906-1915. PhD thesis. Stanford Univ. Press, Stanford, CA. 278 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phillips B. 1998. Sheltering and housing of low-income and minority groups in Santa Cruz county after the Loma Prieta earthquake. In The Loma Prieta, California, Earthquake of October 11, 1989?Recovery, Mitigation, and Reconstruction, ed. JM Nigg, pp. D17-28. U.S. Geol. Surv. Prof. Pap. 1553D. Washington, DC: USGPO&lt;/ref&gt; and more importantly, expose inequalities inherent in the social order by exponentially exacerbating its effects.

Early disaster research established the mainstream parameters of what it is to do such research - i.e. a focus on solidarity arising in the aftermath of disasters and that disasters are a consequence of human maladaptation to the hazardous environment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/60461618&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types and causes of disasters ==
*[[Natural disaster]] – a natural disaster is an event that occurs on its own due to the earth's regular processes. Some natural disasters can be predicted while others happen very suddenly. Injury, death and damage to personal or commercial property often occurs during these events. A few examples are tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. Certain areas around the globe are prone to certain natural disasters.
*Human-made/technological disaster – these types of disaster are caused by the human race but can also be prevented by the human race. Advancements in technology are a wonderful thing but some uses of it can be very hazardous to life on earth. Extreme precautions must be taken in order to avoid most of these types of disasters. A few examples are chemical/nuclear, mass power outages and cyber attacks such as computer hacking.
*[[Terrorist attack]]s – a terrorist attack is an act of crime or violence that is directed towards a certain group or belief system. These attacks are usually provoked by political or religious reasons. These events usually include the use of violence that often occur in bodily injury and even loss of life. Some examples are 9/11, Boston marathon bomber and the beheading of multiple American reporters by ISIS

Natural disasters and terrorist attacks are the most common occurring types of disasters that affect the human population not only physically but mentally also. These types of disasters are the most detrimental to the morality of society and inflict a lot of mental stress and fear. People affected often have horrific flashbacks and can lead to self-harm and suicide is even possible.

== Behaviour before, during, and after disasters ==
In the sociology of disaster, human beings are naturally inclined to prepare for the odd event of disaster by buying supplies such as non-perishable foods, bottled water, basic medical supplies, sources of light and heat and batteries to operate such things. We stow these things away in an accessible place but we also have predetermined evacuation routes and ways of transportation to escape the area that will be affected in the coming hours or days if a reliable prediction of catastrophe is presented to us.
During the event of disaster, humans usually panic and become stressed out. This is predictable because many have seen the destruction that certain natural disasters can do. People often contact loved ones and try to seek shelter if they cannot avoid the upcoming disaster. Sometimes, nearby societies will prepare and gather supplies to help the people that are being affected by the disaster. Some organizations will try to help the best they can during the disaster and get people out of harm's way.
After disaster strikes people tend to act in many different ways. The community as a whole tries to help the affected victims but sometimes a few people can act out of the norm and act in criminal ways. Looting and shootings are often associated with disasters. Many organizations band together and provide relief. Communities eventually learn to adapt to the situation at hand and eventually start to thrive again.

==Positives of disasters==
:When cities experience different types of disasters it promotes social change and the coming together of communities in order to help one another. Once a community experiences a disaster they are able to learn and be prepared for the next possible disaster that could happen to them.

===Conflict Theory===
:The best scope to look at disaster's effect on society is through [[conflict theory]]. A conflict theorist believes that conflict is meant to happen in order to better society and help people to grow through competition and the inequalities between different people and groups.

==Socioeconomic status and disaster==
:Responding to an areas disaster can depend on many factors including the economic state of that area. Whether or not an area of people is well-off or poor tends to determine how fast they are re-developed and helped after a disaster. '''Socioeconomic status''' refers to an individual's position in a stratified social order. This system puts people into groups based on their income and wealth. Those groups consist of Upper Class, Middle Class/ Working Class, and the Lower class/ The Poor. When either of these classes experiences a social disaster there are differences in how well and fast they are helped. If a wealthy community experiences a disaster such as a flood they will most likely receive special treatment due to the way American society treats their poor communities as compared to their wealthy ones.

===Location===
====Urban Cities====
:Urban areas are especially at risk when it comes to disaster affecting them because of how they are viewed and taken care of by different groups.

[[File:Giambologna sabine.jpg|thumb|''The Kidnapping of the Sabine Women'' by [[Giambologna]], in the [[Loggia dei Lanzi]] in Florence]]
{{Campaignbox Apocryphal Roman Wars}}

'''The Rape of the Sabine Women''' was an incident in [[Roman mythology]] in which the men of Rome committed a [[Bride kidnapping|mass abduction]] of young women from the other cities in the region.  It has been a frequent subject of artists, particularly during the [[Renaissance]] and post-Renaissance eras.

The word "rape" is the conventional translation of the [[Latin]] word ''[[raptio]]'' used in the ancient accounts of the incident. Modern scholars tend to interpret the word as "abduction" or "kidnapping" as opposed to a [[rape|sexual assault]].  Controversy remains, however, as to how the acts committed against the women should be judged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Packman ZM |url=http://journals.co.za/docserver/fulltext/scholia/8/1/scholia_v8_a3.pdf?expires=1480217427&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=4ABED64BF8B19FE8D2E3E99593E3DC0D |title=Rape and consequences in the Latin declamations |journal=Scholia: Studies in Classical Antiquity vol. 8 |date=January 1999 |page=34|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
[[File:Cortona Rape of the Sabine Women 01.jpg|thumb|''Rape of the Sabine Women'' by [[Pietro da Cortona]], 1627–1629.]]
The Rape occurred in the early history of Rome, shortly after its founding by [[Romulus]] and his mostly male followers. Seeking wives in order to establish families, the Romans negotiated unsuccessfully with the [[Sabines]], who populated the surrounding area. The Sabines feared the emergence of a rival society and refused to allow their women to marry the Romans.  Consequently, the Romans planned to abduct Sabine women during a festival of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune Equester]]. They planned and announced a marvelous festival to attract people from all nearby towns. According to Livy, many people from Rome's neighboring towns attended, including folk from the [[Caenina (Town)|Caeninenses]], [[Crustumerium|Crustumini]], and [[Antemnae|Antemnates]], and many of the Sabines.  At the festival, Romulus gave a signal, at which the Romans grabbed the Sabine women and fought off the Sabine men.  The indignant abductees were soon implored by Romulus to accept Roman husbands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19725/19725-h/19725-h.htm#a10 Livy, Ab Urbe Condita Book 1 Ch. 9, p.15].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Livy]] claims that no direct sexual assault took place, albeit the fuller evidence, when compared with the later history, suggests a seduction based on promises by the Romans and then betrayal of those promises. Livy says that Romulus offered them free choice and promised civic and property rights to women. According to Livy, Romulus spoke to them each in person, declaring "that what was done was owing to the pride of their fathers, who had refused to grant the privilege of marriage to their neighbours; but notwithstanding, they should be joined in lawful wedlock, participate in all their possessions and civil privileges, and, than which nothing can be dearer to the human heart, in their common children."&lt;ref name="Livy"&gt;Livy, ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'' [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19725/19725-h/19725-h.htm#a9 1.9].&lt;/ref&gt;

==War with Sabines and other tribes==

[[File:Stella, Jacques, The Rape of the Sabines, mid 17th century.jpg|thumb|[[Jacques Stella]], ''The Rape of the Sabines'', mid 17th century, [[Princeton University Art Museum]]]]

Outraged at the occurrence, the king of the Caeninenses entered upon Roman territory with his army.  Romulus and the Romans met the Caeninenses in battle, killed their king, and routed their army. Romulus later attacked Caenina and took it upon the first assault. Returning to Rome, he dedicated a temple to [[Feretrius|Jupiter Feretrius]] (according to Livy, the first temple dedicated in Rome) and offered the spoils of the enemy king as ''[[spolia opima]]''. According to the [[Roman triumph#The Fasti Triumphales|Fasti Triumphales]], Romulus celebrated a triumph over the Caeninenses on 1 March 752 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19725/19725-h/19725-h.htm#a10 1.10]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the army of the Antemnates invaded Roman territory. The Romans retaliated, and the Antemnates were defeated in battle and their town captured. According to the ''Fasti Triumphales,'' Romulus celebrated a second triumph in 752 BC over the Antemnates.

The Crustumini also started a war, but they too were defeated and their town captured.

Roman [[Colonia (Roman)|colonists]] subsequently were sent to Antemnae and Crustumerium by Romulus, and many citizens of those towns also migrated to Rome (particularly the families of the captured women).

The Sabines themselves finally declared war, led into battle by their king, [[Titus Tatius]]. Tatius almost succeeded in capturing Rome, thanks to the treason of [[Tarpeia]], daughter of [[Spurius Tarpeius]], Roman governor of the citadel on the [[Capitoline Hill]]. She opened the city gates for the Sabines in return for "what they bore on their arms", thinking she would receive their golden bracelets. Instead, the Sabines crushed her to death with their shields, and her body was thrown from a rock known ever since by her name, the [[Tarpeian Rock]].

The Romans [[Battle of the Lacus Curtius|attacked]] the Sabines, who now held the citadel. The Roman advance was led by [[Hostus Hostilius]], the Sabine defence by Mettus Curtius. Hostus fell in battle, and the Roman line gave way. They retreated to the gate of the Palatium. Romulus rallied his men by promising to build a temple to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter Stator]] on the site. He then led them back into battle. Mettus Curtius was unhorsed and fled on foot, and the Romans appeared to be winning.

At this point, however, the Sabine women intervened:

{{bquote|[They], from the outrage on whom the war originated, with hair dishevelled and garments rent, the timidity of their sex being overcome by such dreadful scenes, had the courage to throw themselves amid the flying weapons, and making a rush across, to part the incensed armies, and assuage their fury; imploring their fathers on the one side, their husbands on the other, "that as fathers-in-law and sons-in-law they would not contaminate each other with impious blood, nor stain their offspring with parricide, the one their grandchildren, the other their children. If you are dissatisfied with the affinity between you, if with our marriages, turn your resentment against us; we are the cause of war, we of wounds and of bloodshed to our husbands and parents. It were better that we perish than live widowed or fatherless without one or other of you."&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'' [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19725/19725-h/19725-h.htm#a13 1.13]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The battle came to an end, and the Sabines agreed to unite in one nation with the Romans. Titus Tatius jointly ruled with Romulus until Tatius's death five years later.

The new Sabine residents of Rome settled on the Capitoline Hill, which they had captured in the battle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19725/19725-h/19725-h.htm#a33 1:33]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic representations==
Many treatments of the incident combined a suitably inspiring example of the hardiness and courage of ancient Romans with the opportunity to depict multiple figures, including heroically semi-[[Nude (art)|nude figures]], in intensely passionate struggle.

[[File:Johann Heinrich Schönfeld 004.jpg|thumb|''The Rape of the Sabine Women'' by [[Johann Heinrich Schönfeld]]]]

The subject was popular during the Renaissance as symbolising the importance of marriage for the continuity of families and cultures. It was also an example of a battle subject in which the artist could demonstrate his skill in depicting female as well as male figures in extreme poses, with the added advantage of a sexual theme.  It was depicted regularly on 15th-century Italian ''[[cassone|cassoni]]'' and later in larger paintings. A comparable opportunity from the [[New Testament]] was afforded by the theme of the [[Massacre of the Innocents]].

"The masters must be copied over and over again," Degas said, "and it is only after proving yourself a good copyist that you should reasonably be permitted to draw a radish from nature." Degas first received permission to copy paintings at the Louvre in 1853 when he was eighteen. He was most interested in the great works of the Italian Renaissance and of his own classical French heritage, hence this detailed copy of Poussin's painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nortonsimon.org/collections/browse_title.php?id=F.1983.06.P|title=The Rape of the Sabines (after Poussin) - Browse by Title - Norton Simon Museum|website=www.nortonsimon.org|access-date=2016-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Giambologna===
[[File:Florence Rape of the Sabine Women 3.jpg|thumb|''The Rape of the Sabine Women'' by [[Giambologna]] at the [[Loggia dei Lanzi]]]]
16th-century Italo-Flemish sculptor [[Giambologna]] sculpted a representation of this theme with three figures (a man lifting a woman into the air while a second man crouches), carved from a single block of [[marble]]. This sculpture is considered Giambologna's masterpiece&lt;ref&gt;Liam E. Semler, ''The English Mannerist Poets and the Visual Arts'' 1998, {{ISBN|978-0-8386-3759-3}}, page 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally intended as nothing more than a demonstration of the artist's ability to create a complex sculptural group, its subject matter, the legendary rape of the Sabines, had to be invented after [[Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]], decreed that it be put on public display in the [[Loggia dei Lanzi]] in [[Piazza della Signoria]], Florence.

The proposed site for the sculpture, opposite [[Benvenuto Cellini]]'s statue of [[Perseus]], prompted suggestions that the group should illustrate a theme related to the former work, such as the rape of [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] by [[Phineus (son of Belus)|Phineus]]. The respective rapes of [[Proserpina]] and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] were also mooted as possible themes. It was eventually decided that the sculpture was to be identified as one of the Sabine virgins.

The work is signed &lt;small&gt;OPVS IOANNIS BOLONII FLANDRI MDLXXXII&lt;/small&gt; ("The work of Johannes of Boulogne of [[Flanders]], 1582"). An early preparatory [[bronze]] featuring only two figures is in the [[Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte]] in [[Naples]]. Giambologna then revised the scheme, this time with a third figure, in two wax models now in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London. The artist's full-scale [[gesso]] for the finished sculpture, executed in 1582, is on display at the [[Galleria dell'Accademia]] in [[Florence]].

Bronze reductions of the sculpture, produced in Giambologna's own studio and imitated by others, were a staple of connoisseurs' collections into the 19th century.

[[File:Poussin RapeSabineLouvre.jpg|thumb|''The Rape of the Sabine Women'', by Nicolas Poussin, Rome, 1637–38 ([[Louvre Museum]])]]

===Nicolas Poussin===
[[Nicolas Poussin]] produced two major versions of this subject, which enabled him to display to the full his unsurpassed antiquarian knowledge, together with his mastery of complicated relations of figures in dramatic encounter. One, now at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], was executed in Rome in 1634–35. It depicts Romulus at the left giving the signal for the abduction.

The second version, of 1636–37, now at the [[Louvre Museum]], shows that, though some of the principal figures are similar, he had not exhausted the subject. The architectural setting is more developed.

===Peter Paul Rubens===
{{main|The Rape of the Sabine Women (Rubens)}}
[[Peter Paul Rubens]] painted a version of the subject about 1635–40. It is at the [[National Gallery, London]].

===Jacques-Louis David===
[[File:The Intervention of the Sabine Women.jpg|thumb|''The Intervention of the Sabine Women'' ([[1799 in art|1799]]).]]
[[Jacques-Louis David]] painted the other end of the story, when the women intervene to reconcile the warring parties. ''The Sabine Women Enforcing Peace by Running Between the Combatants'' (also known as ''[[The Intervention of the Sabine Women]]'') was completed in 1799. It is in the [[Louvre Museum]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

David had worked on it from 1796, when France was at war with other European nations, after a period of civil conflict culminating in the [[Reign of Terror]] and the [[Thermidorian Reaction]], during which David himself had been imprisoned as a supporter of [[Robespierre]]. After David's estranged wife visited him in jail, he conceived the idea of telling the story, to honor his wife, with the theme being love prevailing over conflict. The painting was also seen as a plea for the people to reunite after the bloodshed of the revolution.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The painting depicts Romulus's wife Hersilia — the daughter of [[Titus Tatius]], leader of the Sabines — rushing between her husband and her father and placing her babies between them. A vigorous Romulus prepares to strike a half-retreating Tatius with his spear, but hesitates. Other soldiers are already sheathing their swords.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===John Leech===
[[File:Comic History of Rome p 010 The Romans walking off with the Sabine Women.jpg|thumb|[[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]]'s satirical version of The Rape of the Sabine Women]]

The English 19th-century satirical painter [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]] included in his ''Comic History of Rome'' a depiction of the Rape of the Sabine Women, where the women are portrayed, with a deliberate anachronism, in Victorian costume and being carried off from the "Corona et Ancora" ("Crown and Anchor", a common English pub sign in seafaring towns).

===Pablo Picasso===
[[Pablo Picasso]] visited this theme in his several versions of the ''Rape of the Sabine Women'' (1962–63), one of which is in the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]. These are based on David's version. These conflate the beginning and end of the story, depicting the brutish Romulus and Tatius ignoring and trampling on the exposed figure of Hersilia and her child.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.principisabini.it/glossario/zoom.php?id=23 La tomba del principe sabino — Glossario] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102053759/http://www.principisabini.it/glossario/zoom.php?id=23 |date=2011-01-02 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charles Christian Nahl===
[[Charles Christian Nahl]] painted the subject in a trio of works entitled ''The Abduction'', ''The Captivity'', and ''The Invasion''.

==Literature and performing arts==
[[Stephen Vincent Benét]] wrote a short story called "The Sobbin' Women" that parodied the legend. Later adapted into the musical ''[[Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (film)|Seven Brides for Seven Brothers]]'', it tells the story of seven gauche but sincere backwoodsmen, one of whom gets married, encouraging the others to seek partners. After a social where they meet girls they are attracted to, they are denied the chance to pursue their courtship by the latter's menfolk. Following the Roman example, they abduct the girls. As in the original tale, the women are at first indignant but are eventually won over.

The story was parodied by Lady Carlotta, the mischief-making character in [[Saki]]'s short story "The Schartz-Metterklume Method".&lt;ref&gt;H. H. Munro (Saki), ''Beasts and Super-Beasts: Beasts'', available at [http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/372/ Read book online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106102640/http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/372/ |date=2009-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[midrash]] ''[[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|Sefer haYashar]]'' (first attested AD 1624) portrays the story as part of a war between the [[Sabines]], descended from [[Tubal]], and the Roman [[Kittim]] ([[s:Book of Jasher/Chapter 17|Jasher 17:1–15]]). A more detailed version of this narrative is found in the earlier mediaeval rabbinic work ''[[Yosippon]]''.

In 1962, a Spanish "[[sword and sandal]]" film based on the story was made, directed by [[Alberto Gout]]. Titled ''El Rapto de las Sabinas,'' the film was released in the USA under the titles ''[[The Rape of the Sabine Women (1962 film)|The Rape of the Sabine Women]]'' and ''The Shame of the Sabine Women.''

The latest adaptation is a [[The Rape of the Sabine Women (film)|video film, ''The Rape of the Sabine Women'']] without dialogue, which was produced in 2005 by [[Eve Sussman]] and the Rufus Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Rape of the Sabine Women: Present at an Empire’s Corrupted Birth|publisher=[[New York Times]]|author=Roberta Smith|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/21/arts/design/21sabi.html|date=February 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tom Stoppard]]'s play ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' features a group of all-male players offering to put on a performance of The Rape of the Sabine Women, to the disgust of the title characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shmoop.com/rosencrantz-and-guildenstern-are-dead/summary.html|title=Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead|work=Shmoop}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have cited parallels between the Rape of the Sabine Women, the [[Æsir–Vanir War]] in [[Norse mythology]], and the [[Mahabharata]] from [[Hindu mythology]], providing support for a [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Proto-Indo-European]] "war of the functions". Regarding these parallels, [[J. P. Mallory]] states:
{{quote|Basically, the parallels concern the presence of first-(magico-juridical) and second-(warrior) function representatives on the victorious side of a war that ultimately subdues and incorporates third function characters, for example, the Sabine women or the Norse Vanir. Indeed, the ''[[Iliad]]'' itself has also been examined in a similar light. The ultimate structure of the myth, then, is that the three estates of [[Proto-Indo-European society]] were fused only after a war between the first two against the third.&lt;ref name=MALLORY139&gt;Mallory (2005:139).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Indroda eggs.JPG|thumb|160px|Fossilized Dinosaur eggs displayed at [[Indroda Dinosaur and Fossil Park]].]]
This '''timeline of egg fossils research''' is a chronologically ordered list of important discoveries, controversies of interpretation, [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] revisions, and cultural portrayals of [[egg fossils]]. Humans have encountered egg fossils for thousands of years. In [[stone age]] [[Mongolia]], local peoples fashioned fossil [[dinosaur]] eggshell into jewelry. In [[the Americas]], fossil eggs may have inspired [[Navajo people|Navajo]] [[creation myths]] about the human theft of a primordial water monster's egg. Nevertheless, the [[scientific]] study of fossil eggs began much later. As reptiles, dinosaurs were presumed to have laid eggs from the 1820s on, when their first scientifically documented remains were being described in England.&lt;ref name="enbd-first-1" /&gt; In 1859, the first scientifically documented dinosaur ''egg'' fossils were discovered in southern France by a Catholic [[Catholic priest|priest]] and amateur naturalist named Father [[Jean-Jacques Poech]], however he thought they were laid by giant birds.

The first scientifically recognized dinosaur egg fossils were discovered [[serendipitously]] in 1923 by an [[American Museum of Natural History]] crew while looking for evidence of [[early humans]] in Mongolia. These eggs were mistakenly attributed to the locally abundant herbivore ''[[Protoceratops]]'', but are now known to be ''[[Oviraptor]]'' eggs. Egg discoveries continued to mount all over the world, leading to the development of multiple competing classification schemes. In 1975 Chinese paleontologist [[Zhao Zi-Kui]] started a revolution in fossil egg classification by developing a system of "[[parataxonomy]]" based on the traditional [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean]] system to classify eggs based on their physical qualities rather than their hypothesized mothers. Zhao's new method of egg classification was hindered from adoption by Western scientists due to language barriers. However, in the early 1990s Russian paleontologist [[Konstantin Mikhailov]] brought attention to Zhao's work in the English language [[scientific literature]].

This implies that the mother's drinking water had a higher percentage of the heavier oxygen in its water molecules due to evaporation, which meant the environment was hot.&lt;ref name="enbd-tools-131" /&gt;

They also found that the carbon in the eggshell is mostly the heavier [[Carbon 13]] rather than the lighter[[Carbon 12]]. This means the dinosaur were primarily feeding on [[C3 plants]] which use 3 carbon atoms in their [[photosynthesis]] products rather than [[C4 plants]] that use four.&lt;ref name="enbd-tools-132" /&gt;

* Paleontologist [[William A. Clemens, Jr.|Bill Clemens]] alerted [[John R. Horner|Jack Horner]] and [[Bob Makela]] to the presence of unidentified dinosaur fossils in [[Bynum, Montana|Bynum]], [[Paleontology in Montana|Montana]]. Horner visited the town and recognized the remains as belonging to a [[Hadrosaur|duck-billed dinosaur]]. While in town the owner of a local rock shop, Marion Brandvold, showed him some tiny bones. Horner identified them as baby duck-bill bones. Horner also knew that this was an important find and convinced Brandvold to let him study her fossils at [[Princeton University]].&lt;ref name="bigsky-history-56" /&gt; The fossil embryos were returned to Bynum a few years ago and are now on display at the Two Medicine Dinosaur Center.

'''[[1979 in paleontology|1979]]'''{{anchor|1979}}
* Karl Hirsch disputed Romer and Price's claim to have discovered a Permian hard-shelled egg, since the fossil in question didn't show evidence for the [[calcite]] that should have composed the shell. Hirsch found enough [[phosphorus]] in the object's outer layer to propose that the fossil was actually an egg, with a leathery shell.&lt;ref name="enbd-evolution-43" /&gt;
* Erben and others found isotope ratios of [[Carbon]] and [[Oxygen]] in French dinosaur eggs similar to those found in Mongolian dinosaur eggs by Folinsbee and others in 1970. The ratios are indicative of a diet of C3 plants and hot living conditions.&lt;ref name="enbd-tools-132" /&gt;

* [[Steve Etches]], [[Jane Clarke (scientist)|Jane Clarke]], and [[John Callomon]] reported the discovery of eight clusters of [[ammonite]] eggs in the Lower and Upper [[Kimmeridge Clay]] of the [[Dorset|Dorset Coast]] in England. The eggs are subspherical to spherical in shape. Some are isolated but some were also found in association with the shells of [[perisphinctid]] ammonites. They were interpreted by the researchers as ammonite eggs sacks and are the best preserved specimens of such known to science. The parents of the egg sacks are thought to be two local ammonite genera co-occurring with the eggs, ''[[Aulacostephanus]]'' and ''[[Pectinatites]]''.&lt;ref name="kim-am-eggs-abs-204" /&gt;

A '''wildlife corridor''', '''habitat corridor''', or '''green corridor'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/england/professionals/en/1115310689250.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201180024/http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/england/professionals/en/1115310689250.html |date=1 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an area of [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] connecting [[wildlife]] populations separated by human activities or structures (such as roads, development, or logging). This allows an exchange of individuals between populations, which may help prevent the negative effects of [[inbreeding]] and reduced genetic diversity (via [[genetic drift]]) that often occur within isolated populations.  Corridors may also help facilitate the re-establishment of populations that have been reduced or eliminated due to [[Disturbance (ecology)|random events (such as fires or disease)]].

This may potentially moderate some of the worst effects of habitat fragmentation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bond, M.|date=2003|title=Principles of Wildlife Corridor Design. Center for Biological Diversity|url=http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/publications/papers/wild-corridors.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Biologivaldiversity.org|accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein [[urbanization]] can split up habitat areas, causing animals to lose both their natural habitat and the ability to move between regions to use all of the resources they need to survive.  Habitat fragmentation due to [[Human development theory|human development]] is an ever-increasing threat to [[biodiversity]], and habitat corridors are a possible mitigation.

==Purpose==
The main goal of implementing habitat corridors is to increase [[biodiversity]]. When areas of land are broken up by human interference, population numbers become unstable and many animal and plant species become endangered. By re-connecting the fragments, the population fluctuations can decrease dramatically. Corridors can contribute to three factors that stabilize a population: 
* '''[[Colonisation (biology)|Colonization]]'''—animals are able to move and occupy new areas when food sources or other natural resources are lacking in their core habitat.
* '''[[Animal migration|Migration]]'''—species that relocate seasonally can do so more safely and effectively when it does not interfere with human development barriers.
* '''Interbreeding'''—animals can find new mates in neighboring regions so that [[genetic diversity]] can increase and thus have a positive impact on the overall population.

Rosenberg et.al. (1995) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosenberg |first1=Daniel K. |last2=Noon |first2=Barry R. |last3=Meslow |first3=E. Charles |title=Towards a definition of wildlife corridor |journal=Integrating People and Wildlife for a Sustainable Future |date=1995 |volume=Proceedings of the First International Wildlife Congress |pages=436–9 |url=https://www.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/pubs/3662 |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; were among the first to define what constitutes a wildlife corridor. The definitions of "[[biological corridor]]" (i.e., wildlife corridor) had, in the early years of studying corridors, been "vague and inconsistent, and often they confound form and function" Rosenberg et.al. developed a [[conceptual model]] that emphasized the role of a wildlife corridor as a facilitator of movement that is not restricted by requirements of [[native vegetation]] or intermediate [http://www.umass.edu/landeco/research/fragstats/documents/Conceptual%20Background/What%20is%20a%20Landscape/What%20is%20a%20Landscape.htm target patches of habitat]. Their definition simply required that movement to a target patch via the corridor be greater that if the corridor were absent.

Although corridors had originally been implemented with the assumption that they would increase biodiversity, not enough research had been done to come to a solid conclusion. The case for corridors has been built more on intuition and much less on [[Empirical research|empirical evidence]] (Tewksbury et al. 2002). Tewksbury et. al. claimed that the early controversies had arisen because most studies had been limited in that they had a narrow taxonomic focus and, that if corridors facilitate animal movement, they should also have strong indirect effects on plant [[populations]] due to increased [[pollen]] and [[seed]] by animals. Results of their 2002 experiment provided a large-scale experimental demonstration that [[habitat]] (or wildlife) corridors facilitate movement of disparate [[Taxon|taxa]] between otherwise isolated patches even after controlling for area effects (Tewksbury et al, 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tewksbury |first1=Joshua |title=Corridors affect plants, animals, and their interactions in fragmented landscapes |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |date=October 1, 2002 |volume=99 |issue=20 |pages=12923–6 |doi=10.1073/pnas.202242699 |pmid=12239344 |pmc=130561 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/99/20/12923.short |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  Another factor that needs to be taken into account is what species the corridor is intended for. Some species have reacted more positively to corridors than others.

A habitat corridor could be considered as a possible solution in an area where the destruction of a natural area has greatly affected its [[native species]]. Development such as [[roads]], [[buildings]], and [[farms]] can interrupt plants and animals in the region being destroyed. Furthermore, [[natural disaster]]s such as [[wildfire]]s and [[flood]]s can leave animals with no choice but to evacuate. If the habitat is not connected to a safer one, it will ultimately lead to death. A remaining portion of natural habitat is called a remnant, and such portions need to be connected because when migration decreases, extinction increases (Fleury 1997).

Corridors can be made in two distinct areas—either water or land. Water corridors are called riparian ribbons and usually come in the form of rivers and streams. Land corridors come on a scale as large as wooded strips connecting larger woodland areas. However, they can also be as simple as [[Hedge|a line of shrubs along a sidewalk]] (Fleury 1997). Such areas can facilitate the movement of small animals, especially birds, from tree to tree, until they find a safe habitat to nest in. Not only do minimal corridors aid in the movement of animals, they are also aesthetically pleasing, which can sometimes encourage the community to accept and support them.

== Users ==
Species can be categorized in one of two groups; passage users and corridor dwellers.

Passage users occupy corridors for brief periods of time. These animals use corridors for such events as [[wikt:migration|seasonal migration]], [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] of a juvenile, or moving between parts of a large home range. Usually large [[Herbivory|herbivores]], medium to large [[carnivore]]s, and migratory species are passage users (Beier &amp; Loe 1992). One common misconception is that the corridor only needs to be wide enough for the passage users to get through. However, the corridor still must be wide enough to be safe and also encourage the animals to use it, even though they do not live out their entire lives in it.

Corridor dwellers can occupy the passage anywhere from several days to several years. Species such as [[plants]], [[reptiles]], [[amphibians]], [[birds]], [[insects]], and small [[mammals]] can spend their entire lives in linear habitats. In this case, the corridor must include everything that a species needs to live and breed, such as soil for [[germination]], burrowing areas, and multiple other breeding adults (Beier &amp; Loe 1992).

== Types ==
Habitat corridors can be categorized according to their width. Typically the wider the corridor, the more use it will get from species. However, the width-length ratio, as well as design and quality play just as important of a role in creating the perfect corridor (Fleury 1997). The strip of land will suffer less from [[edge effect]]s such as weeds, predators, and chemicals if it is constructed properly.  The following are three divisions in corridor widths: 
* '''Regional''' – (&gt;500m wide); connect major ecological gradients such as migratory pathways.
* '''Sub-regional''' – (&gt;300m wide); connect larger vegetated landscape features such as ridgelines and valley floors.
* '''Local''' – (some &lt;50m); connect remnant patches of gullies, wetlands, ridgelines, etc.

Habitat corridors can also be divided according to their continuity. Continuous corridors are strips that are not broken up, while “stepping stone” corridors are small patches of suitable habitat. When stepping stones are arranged in a line, they form a strip of land connecting two areas, just like a continuous corridor would. Both kinds provide linkages between protected core areas and stimulate or allow species to migrate.

Finally, corridors can come in the form of [[underpass]]es or [[overpass]]es, which can be very safe for both animals and humans. Many busy highways cross through natural habitats that native species occupy, as well. Large animals such as deer become a hazard when they cross in front of [[traffic]] and get hit. An overpass or an underpass serves as a bridge to facilitate the movement of animals across a busy road. Observations have shown that underpasses are actually more successful than overpasses because many times animals are too timid to cross over a bridge in front of traffic and would prefer to be more hidden (Dole et al. 2003).
[[Image:Estakada ponad Bogdanką Poznań.jpg|thumb|Overpasses such as this one allow for traffic to continue for human convenience, while allowing wildlife to pass unharmed beneath from place to place.]]

== Costs ==
Corridors can be expensive to plan out and put into action. For example, Daniel Simberloff et al. states that “a bridge that would maintain a [[Riparian zone|riparian corridor]] costs about 13 times as much per [[lane mile|lane-mile]] as would a road that would sever the corridor.” He also states that maintenance of a corridor would be much more costly than refuges for [[endangered species]]. It would simply be easier to move animals between refuges than to buy land, install a corridor, and maintain it. However, where the goal is not just to preserve a few large animal species but to protect biodiversity among all plants and animals, then habitat corridors may be the only option.  Corridors are going to be expensive to implement no matter what, but it does depend on the type, location, and size, which can all vary to a great degree. With the lack of field data on the effectiveness, many agencies are not willing to consider putting in corridors.

== Monitoring use ==
{{Tone|section|date=March 2008}}
It is extremely important for researchers to pay attention to the population changes in animals after a corridor has been implemented to ensure that there are no harmful effects. Researchers can use both [[Mark and recapture|mark-recapture techniques]] and evaluate [[Gene flow|genetic flow]] in order to observe how much a corridor is being used. Marking and recapturing animals is more useful when keeping a close eye on individual movement (Mech &amp; Hallet 2001). The only problem is that tagging animals and watching them does not tell anyone whether the migrating individuals are successfully mating with other populations in connected areas of land. On the other hand, genetic techniques can be more effective in evaluating migration and mating patterns.

One of the most important goals of developing a corridor is to increase migration in certain animal species. By looking at a population’s [[gene flow]], researchers can understand the genetic consequences of corridors (Mech &amp; Hallett 2001). The migration patterns of an entire population are much more important than the movements of a few individuals. From these techniques, researchers will better understand whether or not habitat corridors are increasing biodiversity.

Stephen Mech and James Hallett introduce an additional reason genetic techniques are more useful; they “measure average migration rates over time, which reveals the effects of fragmentation of several generations and is not as sensitive to current population sizes as mark-recapture studies are.” For example, when a population is extremely small, mark-recapture is almost impossible. Clearly, genetic analysis of a species is the best way to determine if animals are actually using corridors to move and reproduce.

==Design==
According to new research, wildlife corridors are best built with a certain degree of randomness or asymmetry, rather than built symmetrically. The research was conducted at UC Davis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/10/081020135221.htm|title=Designing wildlife corridors|publisher=Sciencedaily.com|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wildlife corridors are susceptible to [[edge effect]]s; habitat quality along the edge of a habitat fragment is often much lower than in core habitat areas. Wildlife corridors are important for large species requiring significant sized [[range (biology)|range]]s; however, they are also vital as connection corridors for smaller animals and plants as well as ecological connectors to provide a ''[[rescue effect]]''.

== Examples ==

Both the safety of animals and humans can be achieved through the creation of corridors. For example, deer commonly cross roads in order to get to other grazing land. When they are faced with a car coming at them, they freeze; this puts both the deer and the human’s life in danger. In [[Alberta|Alberta, Canada]], an overpass was constructed to keep animals off of the busy highway; the area is part of a [[national park]], so many different creatures roam the area. The top of the bridge is covered in the native grass of the area so that it blends in better and animals will not know the difference. Gates were also put of on either side of the overpass to help guide animals in the right direction (Semrad 2007).

In [[Southern California]], 15 underpasses and drainage [[culvert]]s were observed to see how many animals used them as corridors. They proved to be especially effective on wide-ranging species such as carnivores, [[mule deer]], small mammals, and reptiles, even though the corridors were not intended specifically for animals. Researchers also learned that factors such as surrounding habitat, underpass dimensions, and human activity also played a role in how much use they got. From this experiment, much was learned about what would constitute a successful habitat corridor (Dole et al. 2003).

In [[South Carolina]], five remnant areas of land were monitored; one was put in the center and four were surrounding it. Then, a corridor was put between one of the remnants and the center. Butterflies that were placed in the center habitat were two to four times more likely to move to the connected remnant rather than the disconnected ones. Furthermore, male holly plants were placed in the center region, and female holly plants in the connected region increased by 70 percent in seed production compared to those plants in the disconnected region. The most impressive dispersal into the connected region, though, was through bird droppings.  Far more plant seeds were dispersed through bird droppings in the corridor-connected patch of land (M. 2002).

There have also been positive effects on the rates of transfer and interbreeding in [[vole]] populations. A control population in which voles were confined to their core habitat with no corridor was compared to a treatment population in their core habitat with passages that they could use to move to other regions. Females typically stayed and mated within their founder population, but the rate of transfer through corridors in the males was very high. Researchers are not sure why the females did not move about as much, but it is apparent that the corridor effectively transferred at least some of the species to another location for breeding (Aars 1999).

In 2001, a wolf corridor was restored through a golf course in [[Jasper National Park]], [[Alberta]], which enabled [[Gray wolf|wolves]] to pass through the course. After this restoration, wolves passed through the corridor frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Shepherd, B|author2=J. Whittington |date=2006|title=Response of wolves to corridor restoration and human use management|journal=Ecology and Society |volume=11 |issue=2|url=http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol11/iss2/art1/|accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the first demonstrations that corridors are used by wildlife, and can be effective in decreasing fragmentation.

===Elephant corridor===
Elephant corridors are narrow strips of land that allow elephants to move from one habitat patch to another. There are 88 identified elephant corridors in India.

In Africa, [[Botswana]] houses the largest number of free-roaming elephant herds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourafricansafari.com/articles/new-way-to-protect-africas-elephant-herds|title=Elephant corridors in Botswana to protect the herds|author=Fran|website=Your African Safari|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elephants Without Borders (EWB) studies the movement of elephants is working to gain community support of local community corridors, so that elephants and humans can co-exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elephantswithoutborders.org/living_with_elephants.php|title=Elephants Without Borders Living with elephants|publisher=Elephantswithourborders.org|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major wildlife corridors===
Several artificial wildlife corridors have been created, these include:
* the Paséo Pantera (also known as the MesoAmerican Biological corridor or [[Paseo del Jaguar|Paséo del Jaguar]])
* the Eastern Himalayan Corridor
* China-Russia Tiger Corridor
* Tandai Tiger Corridor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panthera.org/programs/tiger/tiger-corridor-initiative|title=Panthera|publisher=Panthera.org|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[European Green Belt]]
* The Siju-Rewak Corridor, located in the Garo Hills of India, protects an important population of elephants(thought to be approximately 20% of all the elephants that survive in the country).This corridor project links together the Siju Wildlife Sanctuary and the Rewak Reserve Forest in Meghalaya State, close to the India-Bangladesh border. This area lies within the meeting place of the Himalayan Mountain Range and the Indian Peninsula and contains at least 139 other species of mammal, including tiger, clouded leopard and the Himalayan black bear.
* the [[Ecologische Hoofdstructuur]] is a network of corridors and habitats created for wildlife in the Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;[[:nl:Ecologische hoofdstructuur|Ecologische Hoofdstructuur]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluation ==
Some animal species are much more apt to use habitat corridors than others depending on what their migration and mating patterns are like. For example, many cases of birds and butterflies successfully using corridors have been observed. Less successful stories have come out of mammals such as deer. How effective a corridor is may simply rely on what species it is directed towards (Tewskbury 2002). Corridors created with birds in mind may be more successful because they are highly migratory to begin with.

Human interference is almost inevitable with the quickly increasing population. The goal behind habitat corridors shows the most hope for solving habitat fragmentation and restoring biodiversity as much as possible. Although there are many positives and negatives, there may be enough positives to continue studying and improving corridors. It is truly difficult to say whether corridors are the solution to increasing biodiversity, because each one must be judged on its own.  Each corridor has its own set of standards and goals that may set it apart from another one.

===Negatives===
A major downfall to habitat corridors is that not much information has been gathered about their success. Due to the lack of positive data, many agencies will not allow corridors to be established because they are unsure of their effectiveness. Another problem with corridors is that they are not as useful as simply preserving land so that it cannot be fragmented. However, it is becoming very difficult to set aside land for nature reserves when road-building, industry, and [[urban sprawl]] are all competing for space.

Even if corridors are sought as a solution, it does not necessarily mean that animals will use them. Especially in the case of overpasses, research shows that animals do not like to use them to get to another remnant area of land. Usually overpasses are built over busy highways, and many species are too timid to expose themselves in front of all of the traffic. As more roads and buildings arise, there becomes less space to try to preserve.

Habitat corridors need to be species-specific (not every kind of animal will use every kind of corridor) and corridors can be barriers to some species.  For instance plants may use road verges as corridors however some mammals will not cross roads to reach a suitable habitat.

When a corridor is implemented, many times development is so close by, that it becomes difficult to build a wide enough passage. There is usually a very limited amount of space available for corridors, so buffers are not usually added in (Rosenberg 1997). Without a buffer zone, corridors become susceptible to harmful outside factors from city streets, [[suburb]] development, rural homes, [[forestry]], cropland, and feedlots.

Unfortunately, another limiting factor to the implementation of corridors is money. With such inconclusive data about the effectiveness of connecting land, it is difficult to get the proper funding. Those who would be in charge of the corridor design and construction would ask such questions as, “What if the corridors affect species negatively?” and “What if they actually aid in the spread of disease and catastrophic events?” Furthermore, there is a possibility that corridors could not only aid in the dispersal of native organisms, but invasive ones, as well (Beier &amp; Loe 1998). If [[invasive species]] take over an area they could potentially threaten another species, even to the point of extinction.

Although wildlife corridors have been proposed as solutions to habitat and wildlife population fragmentation, there is little evidence that they are broadly useful as a conservation strategy for all biodiversity in non-developed or less-developed areas, compared to protecting connectivity as the relevant ecological attribute. In other words, corridors may be a useful meme for conservation planning/ers, but the concept has less meaning to wildlife species themselves. Very few wildlife follow easily identified "corridors" or "linkages" (e.g., using [[Computer simulation|computer modeling]]), instead most species meander and opportunistically move through landscapes during daily, seasonal, and dispersal movement behavior. Wildlife corridors may be useful in highly developed landscapes where they are easily identified as the last remaining and available habitat.

===Positives===
Habitat corridors may be defenseless against a number of outside influences, but they are still an efficient way of increasing biodiversity. Strips of land aid in the movement of various animal species and [[pollen]] and [[Biological dispersal|seed dispersal]], which is an added benefit to the intended one (M. 2002). For example, when insects carrying pollen or birds carrying seeds travel to another area, plant species effectively get transported, as well.

Another positive aspect of corridors is that they allow both animals and humans to occupy virtually the same areas of land, and thus co-exist where without the corridor this would not be possible. Large animals such as [[bear]]s can be attracted to residential areas in search of food due to lack of natural resources because of [[habitat fragmentation]]. A corridor would provide a passage for the bears to [[Foraging|forage]] in other locations, so that they would not pose as much of a threat to humans.
