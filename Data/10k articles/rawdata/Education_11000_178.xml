'''Bassick High School''' is a US public high school located in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]].

==History==

In 1924, the Bassick family home was demolished to begin construction for a school. The E &amp; F Construction Company was awarded the contract after submitting a bid for $692,946. Architect [[Ernest G. Southey]] created a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] style plan set back 100 feet from Fairfield Avenue leaving "ample room to the south of the school for a large athletic field."

Bassick Junior High School opened in 1929 with 1,034 students in grades seven through nine and was soon thereafter converted to a senior high school. A new addition was built in 1968 at a cost of $3.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bassickhighschool.org/history.htm |title=History Of Bassick High School |author= |pages= |date= |accessdate=2010-07-28 |quote= |publisher=Bassick High School |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228040053/http://www.bassickhighschool.org/history.htm |archivedate=2010-02-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
As of 2006, the school administration planned to continue developing "Achievement and Career Academies" within the school. "These Academies will create small communities of learners that will personalize the educational experience for each student and provide needed support for increased levels of academic achievement," according to the Federal Department of Education Web site. "Through an Advisory Program, Bassick will ensure that each student is known well by at least one adult member of the school community." The program was also to integrate reading and mathematics instruction.&lt;ref name=slc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slcprogram.ed.gov/cgi-bin/mysql/slcawards.cgi?l%3Dshowschool%26sr%3D1201 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817192526/http://slcprogram.ed.gov/cgi-bin/mysql/slcawards.cgi?l=showschool&amp;sr=1201 |archivedate=2009-08-17 |df= }} Web page titled "Smaller Learning Communities Awards database / Bassick High School", accessed April 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the federal 2006 fiscal year, The U.S. Department of Education awarded the school $476,753 for a five-year "Smaller Learning Communities" grant.&lt;ref name=slc/&gt;

==Athletics==
The school is a former member of the [[FCIAC]] conference, having departed for the Constitution State Conference in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ctpost.com/highschool/article/Bridgeport-schools-approve-Harding-Bassick-move-5574201.php&lt;/ref&gt; Bassick High School offers various athletic teams for both boys and girls.  The Bassick Lions compete in football, soccer, cross country, track, basketball, volleyball, baseball, and softball, and there is also an active cheer squad, the Lionettes.  Bassick's basketball team boasts several great successes, including the 1940 and 1989 Connecticut state championships,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.casciac.org/pdfs/champions_boysbasketball.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and three more finals appearances, in 1939, 2000 and 2004.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.courant.com/2007-03-14/sports/0703140714_1_guard-school-officials-free-throw&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, the team qualified for the semifinals of the 2015 Connecticut state championship, before losing to Bunnell High School of [[Stratford, Connecticut|Stratford]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ctpost.com/highschool/article/Pittman-lifts-Bunnell-over-Bassick-and-into-Class-6146481.php&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carol Rasco''' (née '''Hampton'''; born January 13, 1948) is an American political aide and advocate for disability rights, literacy, and children who served as Director of the [[United States Domestic Policy Council|Domestic Policy Council]] under President [[Bill Clinton]] from 1993 to 1996.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Deparle |first=Jason |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/17/garden/at-home-with-carol-rasco-she-s-the-advocate-she-once-needed.html |title=AT HOME WITH: Carol Rasco; She's the Advocate She Once Needed |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1993-06-17 |accessdate=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1993/08/24/clintons-window-on-the-home-front/ff05f37a-1d7a-41af-9695-70e1ac7a2c6f/|title=CLINTON'S WINDOW ON THE HOME FRONT|last=Radcliffe|first=Donnie|date=1993-08-24|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-07-28|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been described as a trusted aide to the former president and governor and, during his absence due to his presidential campaign, was credited with running Arkansas' daily business.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She cites her life experiences as the mother of a child with a disability as motivation for her political advocacy and influence and has most recently worked most with literacy projects. 

== Early life and education ==
Rasco was born in [[Columbia, South Carolina]], in 1948, to Frank Barnes Hampton, a pharmacist, and Ruby Hampton, a stay-at-home mother. The family returned to [[DeWitt, Arkansas]], after Barnes returned to take over his family's drugstore.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Rasco skipped the 12th grade and enrolled in [[Hendrix College]], though she would later transfer to the [[University of Arkansas]], where she would graduate. She began as a drama major but later changed her major to education due to an interest in children's psychology.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On campus, she became a member of [[Alpha Delta Pi]] sorority&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.alphadeltapi.org/page/accomplishedmembers/|title=Accomplished Members – Alpha Delta Pi|website=www.alphadeltapi.org|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also displayed an interest in politics. She was involved in fellow student [[Mack McLarty]]'s campaign for student body president, who would become Clinton's chief of staff under the same administration in which she would work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She married husband Terry Rasco in 1969.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

After teaching for several years, Rasco went to the [[University of Central Arkansas]] for her Masters degree in Elementary Couseling and Psychology, graduating in 1972.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/carol-rasco|title=Carol Rasco {{!}} HuffPost|website=www.huffingtonpost.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/carol-rasco-b211728/|title=Carol Rasco|last=Rasco|first=Carol|date=|website=LinkedIn|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Bryant, Arkansas]], she set up a psychological counseling system for the public school system, where she would continue working when her first son was born.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Influence of motherhood and beginnings of activism ==
In 1973, Rasco's son was born with [[cerebral palsy]] and brain damage, which she believed may possibly have been prevented if the hospital staff had been less inattentive and performed a [[Caesarean section]] to prevent a traumatic and extended labor. She states that working with her son's disability and development gave her "empathy with those who were reliant on government, from the elderly to young mothers on welfare." In 1981, she gave birth to a daughter.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Rasco stated that, "as I began to learn about all the different agencies and entities you have to try to coordinate to raise a child like this, I became very interested in how we could better design systems to help children and families."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

During her early career, Rasco taught elementary school in the public school system and was a middle school counselor. She volunteered with arts organizations, [[Disability rights movement|disability rights]] groups, and the [[United Methodist Church]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://clintonwhitehouse1.archives.gov/White_House/EOP/dpc/html/Carol_Rasco.html|title=Carol Rasco, Assistant to The President for Domestic Policy|website=clintonwhitehouse1.archives.gov|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, she met the Clintons during a coffee chat as Bill ran for state [[Arkansas Attorney General|Attorney General]], and she would later work with disability rights coalitions to lobby the Arkansas legislature to integrate and provide education for disabled children in school.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Political career ==
Rasco began as the Director of Policy for the [[Arkansas]] Governor's Office, serving for ten years from the beginning of 1983 to the end of 1992. From 1985 to 1992, she served as Liaison to the [[National Governor's Association]] under [[Bill Clinton]]'s terms as Arkansas governor; in this position, she worked primarily on child care, welfare reform, and healthcare reform,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; but in a profile by ''[[The New York Times]]'', she was described as running "much of the state's daily business" during the year Clinton was absent [[Bill Clinton presidential campaign, 1992|campaigning for president]]. During these terms, she helped create consensus on welfare legislation and managed the state's human service policies during a federal lawsuit on insufficient and failing child welfare programs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

From 1993 to 1996, Rasco then served as Director of the [[United States Domestic Policy Council|Domestic Policy Council]] under President Clinton and also served on the [[United States Department of Education]]'s Education Goals Panel.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As a trusted aide to President Clinton, she played a role in immunization policy and continued to push for a more helpful government, especially towards families and for disability rights.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She also influenced other areas of policy, such as family preservation, immigration, and healthcare coverage, and emphasized to her staff that policy should not forget individuals and reasons behind why individuals may be affected by an issue.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

From 1997 to 2000, she became the senior adviser to [[United States Secretary of Education]] [[Richard Riley]] and became the director of Clinton's childhood literacy initiative, the America Reads Challenge,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.yale.edu/1997/11/10/director-america-reads-challenge-speak-new-haven|title=Director of the "America Reads Challenge" to Speak in New Haven|date=1997-11-10|work=YaleNews|access-date=2018-07-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which she and Riley designed and implemented.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.childrensbooksandreviews.com/children-reading-and-literacy-interview-with-carol-rasco-reading-is-fundamental/|title=Interview: Carol Rasco, Reading is Fundamental|last=Mead|first=Aaron|date=2010-10-30|work=Children's Books and Reviews|access-date=2018-07-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Rasco briefly worked for [[College Board]] as a consultant on government relations&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; before joining [[Reading Is Fundamental]] (RIF), the largest literacy non-profit organization in the United States, as its president and CEO that November.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; She had previously become familiar with the organization while implementing the America Reads Challenge, and while at the organization, its communications department encouraged her to start blogging.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; During her leadership, the organization experienced federal budget cuts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/on-parenting/post/reading-is-fundamental-unless-its-too-expensive/2011/11/02/gIQAAZtsiM_blog.html|title=Reading is Fundamental (unless it’s too expensive)|last=D'Arcy|first=Janice|date=2011-11-03|website=Washington Post|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and celebrated its 50th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Reading Is Fundamental|title=Carol Rasco, President and CEO of RIF|date=2015-11-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo5Z56BUd10|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, she began working as a Child Advocate for Three Boys with Books.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

'''Carol Tecla Christ''' (born 1944 in [[New York City]]) is an American academic. In March 2017, she was named the 11th Chancellor of the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the first woman to hold that position. She replaced Chancellor [[Nicholas B. Dirks]] on July 1, 2017.&lt;ref name="sfgate-13mar2017"&gt;{{cite news|first1=Nanette |last1=Asimov|title=Carol Christ is named UC Berkeley’s new chancellor|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Carol-Christ-is-named-UC-Berkeley-s-new-10998372.php|accessdate=March 13, 2017|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and background==
In 1966, Christ graduated with high honors in English from [[Douglass College]], the women's college at [[Rutgers University]]. She received a MPhil. in 1969 and a Ph.D. in 1970 in English from [[Yale University]].&lt;ref name="thesis-christ-1970"&gt;{{cite thesis |url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/302452460/ |title=The aesthetic of particularity in the poetry of Rossetti, Browning, and Hopkins |date=1970 |publisher=[[Yale University]] |type=Ph.D. |last=Christ |first=Carol Tecla |via=[[ProQuest]] |subscription=yes |oclc=14054842}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her late husband, Paul Alpers, was a scholar of Renaissance English literature and the founding director of UC Berkeley’s Townsend Center for the Humanities, until his death in 2013. She has two grown children, Jonathan and Elizabeth Sklute, from a previous marriage, as well as two grandchildren. She lives in Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography, berkeley.edu. Retrieved September 5, 2017.|url=http://chancellor.berkeley.edu/chancellor-christ/biography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1970, Christ joined the faculty at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and was chair of the English department from 1985 to 1988. In 1988, she was appointed dean of humanities, mathematics, and natural sciences. She also served as provost and dean of the College of Letters and Sciences. In 1994, Christ was appointed vice chancellor, assistant manager, and provost (and later became executive vice chancellor) at Berkeley. Christ was the highest-ranking female administrator at Berkeley until she returned to full-time teaching in 2000.&lt;ref name="latimes-13mar2017"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Teresa Watanabe|author2=Rosanna Xia|title=Former Smith College president will be UC Berkeley's first female chancellor|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-uc-berkeley-new-chancellor-20170313-story.html|accessdate=March 13, 2017|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christ became the 10th president of [[Smith College]] in 2002.&lt;ref name="latimes-13mar2017" /&gt; At Smith, Christ led an energetic and wide-ranging strategic planning process to identify the distinctive intellectual traditions of the Smith curriculum and foster initiatives to further develop students’ essential capacities. Throughout her administrative career, Christ has maintained an active program of teaching and research. She has published two books: ''The Finer Optic: The Aesthetic of Particularity in Victorian Poetry'' and ''Victorian and Modern Poetics''. She also edited a Norton Critical Edition of [[George Eliot]]’s ''[[The Mill on the Floss]]'' and co-edited the ''Norton Anthology of English Literature and Victorian Literature'' and ''The Victorian Visual Imagination''. Until recently, she was professor of English at Smith, offering seminars on science and literature and on the arts.

Christ was the president of [[Smith College]] from 2002 to 2013. She announced in May 2012 that she had, along with the Board of Trustees, began the search for her successor. She retired in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2012/03/12/carol_christ_smith_college_president_says_she_will_retire_next_year/ |title=Carol Christ, Smith College president, says she will retire next year - The Boston Globe |website=Boston.com |date=2012-03-12 |accessdate=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, Christ returned to her role as Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost (interim) at the University of California, Berkeley, replacing [[Claude Steele]], who stepped down.&lt;ref name="berkeley-26apr2016"&gt;{{cite news|title=Carol Christ named interim executive vice chancellor and provost|url=http://news.berkeley.edu/2016/04/26/carol-christ-named-interim-executive-vice-chancellor-and-provost/|accessdate=March 13, 2017|newspaper=Berkeley News|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|date=April 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 13, 2017, Christ was named by University of California President [[Janet Napolitano]] as the new Chancellor-elect of the University of California, Berkeley. On March 16, 2017, the [[Regents of the University of California]] confirmed her appointment.&lt;ref name=berkeley-16mar2017&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.berkeley.edu/2017/03/16/carol-christ-confirmed-as-uc-berkeleys-11th-chancellor/ |title=UC Regents confirm Carol Christ as Berkeley’s 11th chancellor |author=Barry Bergman |newspaper=Berkeley News | date=March 16, 2017 | accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 1, 2017, Christ became the 11th UC Berkeley Chancellor and the first woman to serve in this role, succeeding Chancellor [[Nicholas B. Dirks]].&lt;ref name="sfgate-13mar2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name=berkeley-16mar2017 /&gt;

At the start of her first academic year as chancellor, Christ responded to the [[2017 Berkeley protests]] in which protests against conservative speakers led to violent outbreaks. In a letter to the campus which quoted [[John Stuart Mill]], she affirmed the administration's commitment to free speech and urged the community to remember its roots as part of the [[free speech movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.berkeley.edu/2017/08/23/chancellor-christ-free-speech-is-who-we-are/|title=Chancellor Christ: Free speech is who we are|publisher=Berkeley News|date=2017-08-23|accessdate=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later took other steps in this direction which included moderating a panel on free expression and committing $800,000 to providing security for controversial speakers. In a September 2017 interview, she stated that some students find the concept of free speech objectionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-uc-berkeley-chancellor-free-speech-20170914-htmlstory.html|title=UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol T. Christ: 'Free speech has itself become controversial'|first=Teresa|last=Watanabe|publisher=LA Times|date=2017-09-14|accessdate=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christ serves on the board of the [[Consortium on Financing Higher Education]] (COFHE) and is a trustee of [[Sarah Lawrence College]] and [[Dominican University of California]].

==Honors==
Christ was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amacad.org/multimedia/pdfs/classlist.pdf |format=PDF |title=List of Active Members by Class |website=Amacd.org |accessdate=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Member of the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amphilsoc.org/members/electedApril2013 |title=Newly Elected - April 2013 &amp;#124; American Philosophical Society |website=Amphilsoc.org |date= |accessdate=2016-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403002431/https://www.amphilsoc.org/members/electedApril2013 |archivedate=2014-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, she was awarded Yale University's [[Wilbur Cross Medal]] in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aya.yale.edu/content/2007-winners-bios |title=2007 Bios &amp;#124; Association of Yale Alumni |website=Aya.yale.edu |date=2010-08-20 |accessdate=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2011, the [[American College of Greece]] awarded her an honorary doctorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sophia.smith.edu/blog/intadv/2011/06/29/president-christ-receives-honorary-degree/ |title=President Christ receives honorary degree « International Advancement Blog |website=Sophia.smith.edu |date=2011-06-29 |accessdate=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4882">The '''Certificate of Use of Language in Spanish''', or '''CELU''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Certificado de Español: Lengua y Uso''), is an exam designed to determine the level of [[Language proficiency|proficiency]] in the [[Argentinian Spanish]] language. The exam can be taken by anyone whose mother language is not Spanish and needs to demonstrate he has a certain level of proficiency of the language, whether it is for working or studying, in Spanish speaking countries. The exam is required by universities in [[Argentina]] for foreigners and it is also accepted as a valid exam in [[Brazil]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} and [[China]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==Candidates==
Any person whose mother language is not Spanish can take this exam. They must be at least 16 years of age and certify a minimum three years of high school education (EGB III according to the [[Education in Argentina|current educational system in Argentina]], roughly someone who has just passed to the 12th grade in the [[Secondary education in the United States|American system]]).

Passing the exam fulfills the language requirements for studying or working in Argentina{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} where knowledge of Spanish is a requirement.

==Grading==
There are two "pass" grades, either "Intermediate" or "Advanced" level, awarded to candidates who achieve these grades. Candidates who do not pass are not given a grade. Both grades reflect how proficient the person is in the use of Spanish as a foreign language, especially in dealing with everyday situations and work related or academic issues.

This exam is aimed at certifying a certain level of command of the language, therefore, regardless of the regional variation a candidate may know, they will be able to understand the situations to be dealt with in the exam.

==Acceptance==
The CELU is recognized as a certificate which demonstrates a persons knowledge of the [[Spanish language]] in:
* [[Argentina]]
* [[Brazil]]
* [[China]]
* [[Italy]]

'''Ch''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|iː|ˈ|eɪ|tʃ}} is a proprietary [[cross-platform]] [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] and scripting language environment, originally designed by Harry H. Cheng as a scripting language for beginners to learn mathematics, computing, [[numerical analysis]] (numeric methods), and programming in C/C++. Ch is now developed and marketed by SoftIntegration, Inc. A student edition is freely available. Ch Professional Edition for Raspberry Pi is free for non-commercial use.

Ch can be embedded in C/C++ application programs. It has numerical computing and graphical plotting features. Ch is a combined shell and IDE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Veeraraghavan |first= Sriranga |year= 2013 |title= An introduction to Ch: Implementing a temperature converter in Ch |url= http://www.techworld.com.au/article/452524/an_introduction_ch_implementing_temperature_converter_ch/ |publisher= ComputerWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ch shell combines the features of common shell and C language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.softintegration.com/docs/ch/shell/ Ch Shell]&lt;/ref&gt; ChIDE provides quick code navigation and symbolic debugging.  It is based on embedded Ch, Scite and Scintilla.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.softintegration.com/docs/ch/chide/ Ch IDE]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Wang |first= Gary |year= 2002 |title= Ch Solves Portability Headaches |url= http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1049264 |publisher= IEEE Spectrum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ch is written in C and runs on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]], [[macOS]], [[FreeBSD]], [[IBM AIX|AIX]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[QNX]], and [[HP-UX]]. It supports C90 and major C99 features, but it does not support the full set of C++ features. C99 complex number, IEEE-754 floating-point arithmetic, and [[variable-length array]] features were supported in Ch before they became part of the [[C99]] standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Cheng |first= Harry |year= 1993 |title= Handling of Complex Numbers in the Ch Programming Language |pages= 76–106 |url= http://iospress.metapress.com/content/xml874m51x1w42w0/|journal=Scientific Programming}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Cheng |first= Harry |year= 1993 |title= Scientific Computing in the Ch Programming Language |pages= 49–75 |url= http://iospress.metapress.com/content/f225771541203807/ |publisher= Scientific Programming}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Cheng |first= Harry |year= 1995 |title= Extending C and FORTRAN for Design Automation |pages= 390–395 |url= http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=JMDEDB000117000003000390000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=yes&amp;ref=no |publisher= ASME Trans., Journal of Mechanical Design}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Cheng |first= Harry |year= 1995 |title= Extending C with arrays of variable length |pages= 375–406 |url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TYV-3Y6PCHF-V&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=09%2F15%2F1995&amp;_alid=1737140035&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_origin=search&amp;_zone=rslt_list_item&amp;_cdi=5628&amp;_sort=r&amp;_st=13&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_ct=1&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=1369ffa56fdef3033135fa8fc1eb4c15&amp;searchtype=a |publisher= Computer Standards &amp; Interfaces |doi=10.1016/0920-5489(95)00007-H |journal= Computer Standards &amp; Interfaces |volume= 17 |issue= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article published by ''Computer Reseller News'' ([[CRN Magazine|CRN]]) named Ch as notable among C-based virtual machines for its functionality and the availability of third-party libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Morejon |first=Mario |year= 2006 |title= Ch Language Rivals Java Functionality |url= http://www.crn.com/reviews/applications-os/175804126/ch-language-rivals-java-functionality.htm |publisher= CRN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ch has many toolkits that extend its functions. For example, Ch Mechanism Toolkit is used for design and analysis of commonly used mechanisms such as fourbar linkage, five-bar linkage, six-bar linkage, crank-slider mechanism, and cam-follower system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Cheng |first= Harry |year= 2006 |title= Object-Oriented Interactive Mechanism Design and Analysis |pages= 237–246 |url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00366-005-0008-4 |publisher= Engineering with Computers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ch Control System Toolkit is used for modeling, design, and analysis of continuous-time or discrete-time linear time invariant (LTI) control systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Zhu |first= Yong |year= 2003 |title= An Object-Based Software Package for Interactive Control System Design and Analysis |pages= 366–367 |url= http://computingengineering.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleid=1399866f |publisher= ASME Trans. Journal of Computing and Information Science in Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both toolkits includes the source code.

== Features ==
Ch supports the 1999 ISO C Standard (C99) and C++ classes. It is a superset of C with C++ classes. Several major features of C99 are supported, such as complex numbers, variable length arrays (VLAs), IEEE-754 floating-point arithmetic, and generic mathematical functions. The specification for wide characters in Addendum 1 for C90 is also supported.

C++ features available in Ch include:

* Member functions
* Mixed code and declaration
* The ''[[this (computer programming)|this]]'' -&gt; pointer
* Reference type and pass-by-reference
* Function-style type conversion
* Classes
* Private/public data and functions in classes. Ch is compatible with C++ in that by default, members of a class definition are assumed to be private until a 'public' declaration is given
* Static member of class/struct/union
* Const member functions
* The new and delete operators
* Constructors and destructors
* Polymorphic functions
* The scope resolution operator ::
* The I/O functions cout, cerr, and cin with endl
* Arguments for variadic functions are optional

Ch supports classes in C++ with added abilities, including:

* Classes inside member functions
* Nested functions with classes
* Passing member function to argument of pointer-to-function type of functions

Ch can interact with existing C/C++ libraries and call C/C++ functions from Ch script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Wilson |first= Matthew |year= 2004 |title= Open-RJ and Ch |url= http://drdobbs.com/184401877?queryText=ChSDK |publisher= Dr. Dobb's Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a C/C++ interpreter, Ch can be used as a scripting engine and extension language for applications. Pointers to arrays or variables can be passed and shared in both C-compiled and Ch scripting contexts. One example of an embedded Ch scripting application is Mobile-C, which has been used for collaborative visualization of distributed mesh model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Cheng |first= Harry |year= 2009 |title= Speeding-Up Software Development Using Embedded Scripting |pages= 8–8 |url= http://drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/212201774 |publisher= Dr. Dobb's Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Li-rong |last2= Bo |first2= Yo|last3=Hagiwara |first3= I |title= Mobile-C based agent management for collaborative visualization of distributed mesh model |url= http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/freesrchabstract.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5375178&amp;queryText%3DMobile-C%26openedRefinements%3D*%26searchField%3DSearch+All |publisher= Computer-Aided Industrial Design &amp; Conceptual Design, 2009.

Ch has a built-in string type (string_t) for automatic memory allocation and de-allocation. It supports shell aliases, history, piping, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Campbell |first= Matt |year= 2003 |title= Ch, A C/C++ Interpreter – New possibilities for people who like C and Unix |url= http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.19/19.09/CInterpreter/index.html |publisher= MACTECH, the journal of Apple technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cheng|first=Harry|title=The Ch Language Environment|edition=6.3|year=2010|publisher= SoftIntegration , Inc.|location=Davis, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ch has built-in 2D/3D graphical plotting features and computational [[array data type|arrays]] for numerical computing. A 2D [[linear equation]] of the form ''b = A*x'' can be written verbatim in Ch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Glassborow |first= Francis |year= 2001 |title= The Ch Language Environment Version 2.0 |url= http://www.softintegration.com/company/pub/accu.html |pages= 36–37 |publisher= C Vu Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clark Blanchard Millikan''' (August 23, 1903 – January 2, 1966) was a distinguished professor of [[aeronautics]] at the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech), and a founding member of the [[National Academy of Engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nae.edu/About/leadership/57773.aspx |title=Founding members of the National Academy of Engineering |publisher=[[National Academy of Engineering]] |accessdate={{Format date|2012|10|21}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Millikan's parents were noted physicist [[Robert A. Millikan]] and Greta Erwin Blanchard. He attended the [[University of Chicago Laboratory Schools]], graduated from [[Yale College]] in 1924, then  earned his PhD in [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] at [[Caltech]] in 1928 under Professor [[Harry Bateman]]. He became a professor upon receiving his degree, full professor of [[aeronautics]] in 1940, and Director of the [[Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory]] in 1949.&lt;ref name=Zisch&gt;{{cite journal

Southern California Cooperative Wind Tunnel. Pasadena Star News. Pasadena, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; Caltech wind tunnels were subsequently used during the design phase of more than 600 types of aircraft and missiles.&lt;ref name=Zisch/&gt;

He was active in the formation of the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] during [[World War II]], and served as chairman of Caltech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory committee from 1949 onwards. He also taught first college course in [[rocket propulsion]] in the United States. He authored ''Aerodynamics of the Airplane''.&lt;ref name=Zisch/&gt;

Millikan received both the [[Medal for Merit]] from the [[U.S. President]] and the British government's [[King's Medal for Service in the Cause of Freedom]] for his [[World War II]] work in aeronautics and [[ballistic missiles]]. He also served as a member of the [[United States Air Force  Scientific Advisory Board|Air Force Scientific Advisory Board]], [[Naval Research Advisory Committee]], [[Defense Science Board]], and the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Army [[Ballistic Research Laboratory]]. He was a fellow of the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]] of Great Britain, the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and the [[American Physical Society]], and an honorary fellow of the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]] (having served as president of its predecessor, the Institute of Aeronautical Sciences, in 1937). He was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in 1964 and was a founding member of the [[National Academy of Engineering]].&lt;ref name=Zisch/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11777">The '''Common Final Examination (CFE)''' is the last [[Test (assessment)|examination]] [[Chartered Professional Accountant|CPA Students]] took in pursuit of the Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA) designation in Canada. The 3-day CFE is also reputed to be among the world's most challenging professional exams where students are required to use an integrative business thinking model to obtain the designation. Previously known as the Uniform Evaluation (UFE), the UFE has been discontinued following the unification of the three accounting designations (CA, CMA, CGA) in [[Canada]] and [[Bermuda]] in June 2015.

Administered nationally by [[CPA Canada]], and conducted regionally by the provincial/regional orders, the CFE is written over the course of three sequential days and is the culmination of years of study in [[financial accounting]], [[management accounting]], [[corporate finance]], [[performance management]], [[taxation]] and other business-related university courses. Writing the CFE requires successful completion of preliminary education requirements including CPA preparatory courses and Professional Education Program (PEP). Upon passing the CFE and 30 months of approved practical experiences, the candidate will become a [[Chartered Professional Accountant]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The new Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA) certification program: Overview |url=https://www.cpacanada.ca/en/become-a-cpa/why-become-a-cpa/the-cpa-certification-program/the-cpa-certification-program-overview |website=CPA Canada |publisher=CPA Canada |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Common Final Exam is typically offered once per year in September (Fall). Sometimes, it may be offered twice a year in Spring and Fall (such as May and September 2016). The upcoming CFE dates are: September 11 - September 13, 2019. Two CFEs are scheduled for 2020, between May 26 - May 29 and September 9 - September 11, 2020&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Common Final Examination |url=https://www.cpacanada.ca/en/become-a-cpa/cpa-certification-program-evaluation/cpa-certification-capstone-1-cfe-cases |website=CPA Canada |publisher=CPA Canada |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Exam Structure ==

Students must demonstrate the depth and breadth of their abilities according to the CPA Competency Map. Students answer questions which are presented in the form of business cases that include a combination of both explicit and implicit requirements for each case's "users", followed by a list of exhibits that provide case facts from which observations, suggestions and conclusions are derived. Common scenarios include providing advice on how to conduct an audit, advising a client on the pros and cons of investing funds in a given business venture, and providing support to an organization as an internal accountant or auditor. 

All students must demonstrate "depth" in financial reporting or management accounting for the CFE, and one of the elective areas. Students should also demonstrate "breadth" in all 6 competency areas.

The 3-day exam consisted of case based simulations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How each day of the CFE works |url=http://www.cfeblog.ca/2016/01/22/how-each-day-of-the-cfe-works/ |website=CFE Blog |publisher=CFE Blog |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;: 
* Day 1: candidates will have 4 hours to write a case in relation to the Capstone 1 group project. Candidates will be assessed on enabling competencies such as communications skills and professionalism, as well as some technical competencies.

* Day 2: students would choose an elective "depth" area from 4 competency areas - Performance Management, Finance, Assurance or Taxation. Day 2 will last 5 hours in length and students must be "Competent" in the chosen elective area as well as either Financial Reporting or Management Accounting. Note that students wishing to pursue a Public Accounting Licence must have passed Assurance and Taxation from their prior PEP modules and show depth in both Financial Reporting and Assurance on the CFE &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Elective Depth Role |url=https://www.cpaontario.ca/become-a-cpa/complete-your-designation/cpa-pep-cfe |website=CPA Ontario |publisher=CPA Ontario |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Become a Licensed Public Accountant (LPA) |url=https://www.cpaontario.ca/become-a-cpa/why-cpa/program-info/public-accountant-licence |website=Public Accountant Licence |publisher=CPA Ontario |accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

* Day 3: multiple (usually 3) multi-competency cases would be provided within a time frame of 4 hours aimed to evaluate the student's "breadth" in the competency map. A minimum "Reaching Competent (RC)" grade must be achieved for every single competency (all 6 areas). 

===Evaluation Criteria===
All CPA cases are evaluated based on "Competency Ratings". They are:
* '''Not Addressed (NA)''': Candidate has not addressed the Assessment Opportunity.
* '''Not Competent (NC)''': Candidate has addressed the Assessment Opportunity, but the analysis is incorrect or not related to the issue.
* '''Reaching Competent (RC)''': RCs and Cs are both counted towards "Breadth" test for day 3. RC candidates demonstrate more proficiency and understanding than NC, but not at the Competent level.
* '''Competent (C)''': the amount of Cs are used for the "depth" test on day 2. Competent candidates demonstrate the required competency levels as expected by a CPA.
* '''Competent with Distinction (CD)''': Candidates are not expected to achieve this high level of competency. CDs are essentially Cs in terms of exam grading.

===Pass and Fail Decision===
The evaluation decision is separate into day 1 and day 2 with day 3. A student must pass all 3 days in order to "pass the CFE". However, Day 1 is marked separately and Day 2 &amp; 3 are marked together. Therefore, a candidate can pass Day 1 and fail Day 2 &amp; 3 and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Common Final Examination (CFE) Enrolment FAQs |url=https://www.cpaontario.ca/become-a-cpa/complete-your-designation/cpa-pep-cfe/cpa-common-final-examination/common-final-examination-enrolment-faq |website=CPA Ontario |publisher=CPA Ontario |accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*If a student passes Day 1 and fails Days 2 &amp; 3, the student has to write Days 2 &amp; 3 on their next attempt.
*If a student fails Day 1 and passes Days 2 &amp; 3, the student has to write Day 1 on their next attempt (the Capstone 1 case may be different and the student will need to ensure they are comfortable with the new Capstone 1 case).
*If the student fails all three days, they must rewrite all three days.

A candidate may attempt the Common Final Examination 3 times maximum. A student will be deregistered after their third unsuccessful attempt at either Core 1, Core 2, Capstone 1, Capstone 2 or the CFE. A student may not be admitted back to CPA or re-registered except in extraordinary circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Common Final Examination - Frequently Asked Questions |url=https://www.cpaontario.ca/become-a-cpa/complete-your-designation/cpa-pep-cfe/cfe-results-faqs |website=CFE Results FAQs |publisher=CPA Ontario |accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pass Rates==

The exam is administered once per year during September and approximately 5,500 students attempt the exam each year.  National pass rates for 2003 to 2008 have been 65.5%,&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Chartered Accountants in Canada and Bermuda: "Uniform Evaluation Report 2003", page 12. The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; 74.5%,&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Chartered Accountants in Canada and Bermuda: "Uniform Evaluation Report 2004", page 12. The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; 74.0%,&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Chartered Accountants in Canada and Bermuda: "Uniform Evaluation Report 2005", page 12. The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 79.3%,&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Chartered Accountants in Canada and Bermuda: "Uniform Evaluation Report 2006", page 12. The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 74.6%,&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Chartered Accountants in Canada and Bermuda: "Uniform Evaluation Report 2007", page 12. The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and 71.7%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casb.com/index.php?catid=65|title=CA School of Business UFE Statistics|accessdate=2008-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively. Exam results are released in late November following each September sitting of the UFE.

Beginning with the September 2009 UFE, the Board of Evaluators no longer releases statistics on pass rates.

The CFE Board of Evaluators began releasing statistics on pass rates along with Board Reports on candidate performance. The following are the first attempts of CFE Pass Rates for CFE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CPA certification program: Examination performance rates |url=https://www.cpacanada.ca/en/become-a-cpa/cpa-certification-program-evaluation/cpa-examination-performance-rates |website=CPA Canada |publisher=CPA Canada |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
* 2017 September CFE 77.6%
* 2016 September CFE 76.8%
* 2016 May CFE 68.7%
* 2015 September CFE 82.9%

== Exam Entry Method ==

Since 2005, students have been able to type in their responses on laptop computers secured with Securexam (CA) lockdown software in all regions of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cica.ca/becoming-a-ca/the-ufe/computers-in-the-ufe/index.aspx|title=Computers in the UFE|accessdate=2008-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of computer is no longer voluntary. It became a requirement to use a computer starting with the 2009 UFE.

== CFE Honour Roll &amp; Gold Medal ==
Every CFE, the Board would release the Honour Roll recipients along with the CFE results. The CFE honour roll members consists of the nation's top 1% performers on the exam and recognizes performance in the exam that demonstrated academic excellence and exceptional abilities. The Honour Roll of 68 candidates is determined as the top 1% of the first-time writers that wrote all three days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Common Final Examination (CFE) honour roll |url=https://www.cpacanada.ca/en/become-a-cpa/cpa-certification-program-evaluation/common-final-examination-honour-roll |website=CPA Canada |publisher=CPA Canada |accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the honour roll members, a national Gold Medal (highest standing in Canada) is selected, along with 3 provincial gold medalists (top performers in their respective CPA representations). The CPA Governor General's Gold Medal (National Gold Medal) is awarded to 1 individual for a cash prize of $5,000. While each regional Gold Medalist receives a cash price of $2,500 each.

[[File:Réaccrochage de la salle IItalie-Espagne après la guerre 1914-1918.jpg|thumb|right|In the center of the picture, Emile Theodore (museum curator of the [[w:Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille|Palace of Fine Arts in Lille (museum)]] from 1912 to 1937, here during reconstruction of the gallery dedicated to Spanish and Italian paintings, two years after the end of the First World War]]

A '''curator''' (from {{lang-la|cura}}, meaning "to take care")&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Curator |volume=7 |page=636}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a manager or overseer. Traditionally, a curator or '''keeper''' of a [[cultural heritage]] institution (e.g., [[Art museum|gallery]], [[museum]], [[library]], or [[archive]]) is a content specialist charged with an institution's [[Collection (artwork)|collections]] and involved with the [[Heritage interpretation|interpretation]] of heritage material.

A traditional curator's concern necessarily involves tangible objects of some sort — artwork, collectibles, historic items, or scientific collections. More recently, new kinds of curators have started to emerge: [[digital curation|curators of digital data objects]] and [[biocurator]]s.

== Curation scope ==
In smaller organizations, a curator may have sole responsibility for acquisitions and even for [[collections care]]. The curator makes decisions regarding what objects to select, oversees their potential and documentation, conducts research based on the collection and its history, provides proper [[packaging and labeling|packaging]] of art for transportation, and shares  research with the public and community through exhibitions and publications. In very small, volunteer-based museums such as those of local historical societies, a curator may be the only paid staff-member.

In larger institutions, the curator's primary function is that of a subject specialist, with the expectation that he or she will conduct original research on objects and guide the organization in its collecting. Such institutions can have multiple curators, each assigned to a specific collecting area (e.g., curator of ancient art, curator of prints and drawings, etc.) and often operating under the direction of a head curator. In such organizations, the physical care of the collection may be overseen by museum collections-managers or by museum conservators, with documentation and administrative matters (such as personnel, insurance, and loans) handled by a museum registrar.

In the United Kingdom, the term "curator" also applies to government employees who monitor the quality of contract archaeological work under [[PPG 16|Planning Policy Guidance 16: Archaeology and Planning (PPG 16)]] and manage the cultural resource of a region. In the museum setting, a curator in the United Kingdom may also be called a "keeper".

In Scotland, the term "curator" is also used to mean the guardian of a child, known as [[Curator ad litem|curator ''ad litem'']].{{citation needed|date= February 2014}}

In the US, curators have multifaceted tasks dependent on the particular institution and its mission. But in recent years{{when?|date=March 2018}} the role of the curator has evolved alongside the changing role of museums. As US museums have become increasingly more digitized, curators find themselves constructing narratives in both the material and digital worlds. Historian Elaine Gurian has called for museums in which "visitors could comfortably search for answers to their own questions regardless of the importance placed on such questions by others".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clough |first=Wayne |title=Best of Both Worlds: Museums, Libraries and Achieves in the Digital Age |date=2013 |publisher= [[The Smithsonian Institution]] |page=30 |url=http://www.si.edu/content/gwc/BestofBothWorldsSmithsonian.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would change the role of curator from teacher to "facilitator and assistor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clough |first=Wayne |title=Best of Both Worlds: Museums Libraries and Archives in a Digital World |date=2013 |publisher=The Smithsonian Institution |page=30 |url=http://www.si.edu/content/gwc/BestofBothWorldsSmithsonian.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this sense, the role of curator in the United States is precarious, as digital and interactive exhibits often allow members of the public to become their own curators, and to choose their own information. Citizens are then able to educate themselves on the specific subject they are interested in, rather than spending time listening to information they have no desire to learn.

More recently,{{when?|date=March 2018}} advances{{which?|date=March 2018}} in new technologies have led to a further widening of the role of curator. This has been a focus in major art institutions internationally and has become an object of academic study and research.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

In [[contemporary art]], the title "curator" identifies a person who selects and often interprets works of art. In addition to selecting works, the curator is often responsible for writing labels, catalog essays, and other content supporting exhibitions. Such curators may be permanent staff members, "guest curators" from an affiliated organization or university, or "freelance curators" working on a consultancy basis. The late-20th century saw an explosion of artists organizing exhibitions. The artist-curator has a long tradition of influence, notably featuring Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] (1723-1792), inaugural president of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]], London, founded in 1768.

In some US cultural organizations, the term "curator" may designate the head of any given division. This has led to the proliferation of titles such as "Curator of Education" and "Curator of Exhibitions". The term "literary curator" has been used to describe persons who work in the field of poetry, such as former [[92nd Street Y]] poetry-director [[Karl Kirchwey]].&lt;ref name=twsOctB75544&gt;{{cite news

}}{{dead link|date= December 2016 |bot= InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted= yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend has increasingly been mirrored in the United Kingdom in such institutions as Ikon, Birmingham, UK and Baltic, Gateshead, UK.

In Australia and New Zealand the term also applies to a person who prepares a sports ground for use (especially a [[Cricket field| cricket ground]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blogs.espncricinfo.com/thebuzz/archives/2010/12/adelaide_curator_annoys_kp.php|title= The Cordon – Cricket Blogs – ESPN Cricinfo|work= Cricinfo|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101204114323/http://blogs.espncricinfo.com/thebuzz/archives/2010/12/adelaide_curator_annoys_kp.php|archivedate= December 4, 2010|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This job is equivalent to that of [[Groundskeeping|groundsman]] in some other cricketing nations.

In France, the term curator is translated as ''conservateur''. There are two kinds of curators: heritage curators (''conservateurs du patrimoine'') with five specialities (archeology, archives, museums, historical monuments, natural science museums), and librarian curators (''conservateurs des bibliothèques''). These curators are selected by competitive examination and attend the INP (Institut National du Patrimoine)&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Institut national du patrimoine (France)]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason= per WP:CIRCULAR|date= November 2017}}. The "conservateurs du patrimoine" are civil servants or work in the public service; the use of the title by private workers is not possible.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

== Education and training ==
Curators hold a high academic degree in their subject, typically a Doctor of Philosophy or a master's degree in subjects such as history, [[history of art]], art, [[archaeology]], [[anthropology]], or [[classics]].&lt;ref name="times-how-do-i"&gt;Carly Chynoweth, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/student/how_to_get_a_job/article989842.ece ''How do I become a museum curator?''] December 22, 2006, Times Online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="day-in-the-life"&gt;Valarie Kinkade, [http://www.aam-us.org/pubs/webexclusive/kinkade.cfm ''Day in the life: curator.''] American Alliance of Museums&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="edubook-how-to"&gt;Stephanie A. Harper, [http://www.edubook.com/how-to-become-a-museum-curator/8589/ ''How to become a museum curator.''] July 6, 2009, Edubook&lt;/ref&gt; Curators are also expected to have contributed to their academic field, for example, by delivering public talks, publishing articles, or presenting at specialist academic conferences.&lt;ref name="times-how-do-i" /&gt; It is important that curators have knowledge of the current collecting market for their area of expertise, and are aware of current ethical practices and laws that may impact their organisation's collecting.&lt;ref name="curcom-ethics"&gt;[http://www.aam-us.org/docs/continuum/curcomethics.pdf ''A code of ethics for curators.''] 2009, American Alliance of Museums Curators Committee&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="combatting-illicit-trade"&gt;[http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/publications/Combating_Illicit_Trade05.pdf ''Combatting Illicit Trade: Due diligence guidelines for museums, libraries and archives on collecting and borrowing cultural material.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100927233414/http://culture.gov.uk/images/publications/Combating_Illicit_Trade05.pdf |date=September 27, 2010 }} October 2005, Department for Culture, Media and Sport&lt;/ref&gt;

The increased complexity of many museums and cultural organisations has prompted the emergence of professional programs in fields such as public history, [[public humanities]], [[Museology|museum studies]], [[Arts administration|arts management]], and curating/curatorial practice.&lt;ref name="hang-it-all"&gt;Niru Ratnam, [https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2003/mar/09/features.magazine47 ''Hang it all.''] March 9, 2003, The Observer&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the [[Royal College of Art]] established an MA course co-funded by the Royal College of Art and the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]], the first in Britain to specialise in curating with a particular focus on [[contemporary art]]. The course is now funded by [[Arts Council England]], and in 2001 the course title was amended to Curating Contemporary Art to more accurately reflect the content and primary focus of the programme.&lt;ref name="cca-intro"&gt;[http://www.cca.rca.ac.uk/docs/introduction/index.htm ''Curating contemporary art.'']{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Royal College of Art&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a number of contemporary art institutions launched curatorial study courses as an alternative to traditional academic programs. Established in 1987, the École du Magasin is a curatorial training program based at the art center [[Le Magasin]] in Grenoble, France. Similarly, the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], through its independent study program, hosts a curatorial program as one of its three study areas, and [[de Appel]] arts centre has hosted a curatorial programme since 1994. Other institutions that run programs in curating include [[Norwich University of the Arts]]; The Courtauld Institute of Art, London, UK, [[Kingston University]]; [[Goldsmiths, University of London]]; [[Birkbeck, University of London]]; [[Chelsea College of Arts]]; [[University of the Arts London]]; [[California College of the Arts]]; [[University of Southern California]]; [[Bard College]]; [[School of Visual Arts]]; the [[École du Louvre]]; the [[Institut national du patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage), [[University of Rennes 2 – Upper Brittany|University of Rennes 2—Upper Brittany]]; [[OCAD University]]; and [[University of Melbourne]]. (See ''[[#External links|→External links]]'' for further information on courses.)

== Community curation ==
Community curation - alternately known as public curation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=Kris | last1=Morrissey | first2=Tom | last2=Satwicz |title=“Public Curation: From Trend to Research-Based Practice” in Bill Adair, Benjamin Filene, and Laura Koloski, eds., Letting Go? Sharing Historical Authority in a User-Generated World|year=2011|publisher=The Pew Center for Arts and Heritage|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-9834803-0-3|pages=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; - is a movement in US museums and [[public humanities]] organizations to involve community members in various curatorial processes, including exhibit development and programming. Community members involved in community curation are likely not trained as museum professionals, but have vested interests in the outcomes of curatorial projects. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McLean|first=Kathleen|title=“Whose Questions, Whose Conversations?” in Bill Adair, Benjamin Filene, and Laura Koloski, eds., Letting Go? Sharing Historical Authority in a User-Generated World|year=2011|publisher=The Pew Center for Arts and Heritage|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-9834803-0-3|pages=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community curation is a response to the 19th century “information transmission” model of learning, in which museums are sources of expert knowledge and visitors are the recipients of that expertise. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McLean|first=Kathleen|title=“Whose Questions, Whose Conversations?” in Bill Adair, Benjamin Filene, and Laura Koloski, eds., Letting Go? Sharing Historical Authority in a User-Generated World|year=2011|publisher=The Pew Center for Arts and Heritage|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-9834803-0-3|pages=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community curation seeks not to abandon expertise, but to broaden definitions of expertise to “include broader domains of experience” that visitors bring to museums. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McLean|first=Kathleen|title=“Whose Questions, Whose Conversations?” in Bill Adair, Benjamin Filene, and Laura Koloski, eds., Letting Go? Sharing Historical Authority in a User-Generated World|year=2011|publisher=The Pew Center for Arts and Heritage|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-9834803-0-3|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Community curation practices are varied. The [[Wing Luke Museum of the Asian Pacific American Experience|Wing Luke Museum]] conducts community outreach at the beginning of exhibition projects, and convenes community advisory committees at various stages in the curatorial process. &lt;ref name=broom&gt;{{cite news | last = Chinn | first = Cassie | title = Push Me, Pull You | newspaper=[[Pew Center for Arts &amp; Heritage]] |date = June 22, 2012 | url=https://www.pewcenterarts.org/post/push-me-pull-you-cassie-chinn}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Brooklyn Historical Society]] has accepted exhibit proposals from community members and trained them in curatorial skills to co-create exhibits. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schwartz|first=Deborah|title=“Community as Curator: A Case Study at the Brooklyn Historical Society” in Bill Adair, Benjamin Filene, and Laura Koloski, eds., Letting Go? Sharing Historical Authority in a User-Generated World|year=2011|publisher=The Pew Center for Arts and Heritage|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-9834803-0-3|pages=113-114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such efforts to allow communities to participate in curation can require "''more'' not less expertise from museum staff." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Filene|first=Benjamin|title=“Listening Intently: Can StoryCorps Teach Museums How to Win the Hearts of New Audiences?” in Bill Adair, Benjamin Filene, and Laura Koloski, eds., Letting Go?

== Technology and society ==
In the same way that a museum curator may acquire objects of relevance or an art curator may select or interpret a work of art, the injection of technology and impact of [[social media]] into every aspect of society has seen the emergence of technology curators.

Technology curators are people who are able to disentangle the science and logic of a particular technology and apply it to real world situations and society, whether it is for social change, commercial advantage, or other purposes. The first UK ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' Conference had a test lab, where an independent curator selected technology that showcased radical technology advancements and their impact on society, such as the ability to design and [[3D printing|"print"]] physical objects using [[3D printer]]s (such as a fully working violin) or the ability to model and represent accurate interactive medical and molecular models in stereoscopic 3D.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wiredevent.co.uk/wired/agenda&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eduniversal''' is a university ranking business by the French [[Consultant|consulting]] company and [[rating agency]] ''SMBG'' specialized in [[Higher education|Higher Education]].&lt;ref&gt;Presentation of the Eduniversal Company on a TV program, ''Télématin'' on a French Channel, France 2 - 26th of June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1994, one of the main goals of Eduniversal is to provide a tool, for students all around the world, which provides information on the Best [[Business school|Business Schools]], located in Eduniversal's 9 geographical regions (the 5 continents).

The Eduniversal ranking agency establishes an official selection of the Best 1000 Business Schools in more than 150 countries in the world. The purpose of this  selection is to offer students a serious [[referent]] that reflects the international dimension of each School, and therefore enables them to make the right decision regarding the choice of their future School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20080510110455694 FRANCE: Global list of business schools published]&lt;/ref&gt;

The official selection is the result of the work of an International Scientific Committee gathered at the initiative of the Eduniversal Company. The International Scientific Committee is composed of 12 members; 9 members coming from nine different geographic zones ([[Africa]], [[Central Asia]], [[Eastern Europe]], [[Eurasia]] and [[Middle East]], [[Far East Asia]], [[Latin America]], [[North America]], [[Oceania]] and [[Western Europe]]), and 2 members from the Eduniversal Company (The CEO and the International Coordinator).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.trncinfo.com/TANITMADAIRESI/ARSIV2008/ENGLISHarcive/JANUARY/310108.htm, ''Gau and Emu selected amongst 1000 Business Schools of the world ''published on the 31 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
The '''official selection'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.universityworldnews.com/index.php?page=Top_1000_BusSchools_2009, ''2009 : The World's Top 1000 Business Schools'', paragraph 6.&lt;/ref&gt; as it is defined by the Eduniversal Company is the classification of the 1000 best Business Schools in 153 countries in the World. The selection is classified in terms of '''Palms''' and '''Ratings''', issued from the Deans' votes.
The aim of this official selection is to provide sufficient information for [[student]]s about a range of [[academic institution]]s, sorted by their reputations and international ambitions and located in 9 different zones.

===Official Selection===

The Official Selection is a selection of Business Schools made by a Scientific Committee that has established a global mapping system meeting the criteria of universality and the international reputation of each academic institution.

Eduniversal offers to describe the best academic opportunities for students zone by zone, via a range of schools with different types of [[reputation]] and international ambitions, within the nine zones list.

According to the Eduniversal company, the international reputation is the capacity of a Business School to increase the prestige of a student – and therefore improve his [[employment]] prospects – in his country of study and on the international stage.

In order to execute the official selection, each country and each continent is represented according to a quota method. The number of schools per country is therefore weighted by quantitative and qualitative criteria.

'''Quantitative criteria'''
* the national [[expenditure]] on [[education]] per inhabitant
* the [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]
* the size of the population
* the number of students in higher education

'''Qualitative criterion'''

the educational environment in the country (established, among other things, according to the number of [[secondary education]] academic institutions in the country, as well as a historical importance of the national educational tradition).
The results can therefore be expressed in the following way:

{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
! '''Country''' !! '''National Expenditure on Education per inhabitant''' !! '''GDP per inhabitant''' !! '''Population size in Millions''' !! No. of students in Higher Education !! '''Qualitative Criterion''' !! '''Schools Quota Results'''
|-
| Tunisia || $605.10 || $8,898 || 9,815,644 || 26,435 || - || 4 Schools
|-
| Poland || $773.80 || $14,880 || 38,625,478 || 447,785 || - || 12 Schools
|-
| Indonesia || $64.80 || $4,323 || 245,452,739 || 552,660 || - || 7 Schools
|-
| Mexico || $495 || $11,249 || 107,449,525 || 339,450 || - || 17 Schools
|-
| Netherlands || $1,683.70 || $35,078 || 16,318,199 || 89,341 || - || 13 Schools
|}

The official selection is made by the International Scientific Committee composed of 9 members coming from the nine geographic zones listed above.

The 9 expert members are all well-known academics in their respective zone.

The International Scientific Committee&lt;ref&gt;http://www.universityworldnews.com/index.php?page=Top_1000_BusSchools_2009, International Selection Committee - last chapter.&lt;/ref&gt; meets:
* to modify the Official Selection, two years after the first Selection, then every four years, depending on changes and global trends.
* yearly, to publish the Palmes arising from international criteria and the votes of the Deans on the website: www.eduniversal.net.

===Palmes===
The EDUNIVERSAL Palmes indicate the level of an academic institution's international reputation. They are awarded on the basis of the [[research]] work carried out by the International Scientific Committee, which compiles the list of criteria, together with the assessments made by peers: '''The Deans vote'''

They help the student to make his choice within the Official Selection and rate the reputation of the [[school]] or [[university]] within the country, its geographical zone, or even at the global level.

The Palmes&lt;ref&gt;http://www.universityworldnews.com/index.php?page=Top_1000_BusSchools_2009, Chapter : Identifying the Best Business Schools, ''Awarding the Palmes''&lt;/ref&gt; are divided into a league system, which allows horizontal intercontinental comparison, different from the vertical comparison made by most of the international classification systems.

This segmentation is presented as a normal probability curve:
* 100 schools in the 5 Palmes league
* 200 schools in the 4 Palmes league
* 400 schools in the 3 Palmes league
* 200 schools in the 2 Palmes league
* 100 schools in the 1 Palme league

The classification by Palmes is made using two essential elements: the '''internationalisation criteria''' and the '''Deans vote'''.

'''Internalisation criteria'''

* the [[accreditation]]s obtained by the schools ([[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business|AACSB]], [[European Quality Improvement System|EQUIS]], [[European Quality Improvement System|AMBA]], State Qualification, etc.)
* the main classifications ([[Financial Times]], [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]], [[Business Week]], [[Asiaweek]], [[Wall Street Journal]], America savings, [[Times Higher Education|THES]], SMBG, etc.)
* participation in international academic associations ([[European Foundation for Management Development|EFMD]], CLADEA, [[Central and East European Management Development Association|CEEMAN]], [[Executive Master of Business Administration|EMBA]], [[Association of Asia-Pacific Business Schools|AAPBS]], etc.)
* the network of partners of Deans and Business Schools at the international and local levels
* reputed studies and sites in the world of education and universities

'''Deans vote''':&lt;ref&gt;http://vijaysrinivasan.wordpress.com/2008/11/23/iim-bangalore-ranked-among-27-best-b-schools-in-the-world-1-in-india/&lt;/ref&gt;

Each [[Dean (education)|Dean]] from the universities and schools on the list of 1,000 can vote to recommend the other academic institutions. This vote is converted into a recommendation rate that the student can use to evaluate each academic institution and compare them.

These recommendations give another reply to the question: "Out of the following schools, which ones would you most recommend to a person who wants to study in this country?"

==Insolvency proceedings==
Eduniversal was placed into receivership on February 20, 2018. The announce of the receivership procedure was published in the ''BODACC'' ([[French (language)|French]]: ''Bulletin officiel des annonces civiles et commerciales'', the French official registry of civil and commercial notices) on March 1, 2018. &lt;ref&gt;http://entreprises.lefigaro.fr/eduniversal-92/entreprise-399207729&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.procedurecollective.fr/fr/redressement-judiciaire/1390184/eduniversal.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bodacc.fr/annonce/detail-annonce/A/20180042/2406&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid 1950s the '''[[Pye Ltd.|Pye]]''' factory in Haig Road (now [[Elizabeth Way]]), '''Cambridge''' employed around 100 young men participating in electrical or mechanical five-year apprenticeships. The apprentices generally started at age 16 with some passes at “O” level [[General Certificate of Education]] and were indentured to the company. The indenture took the form of a formal written agreement signed by both the apprentice and the company and bound the apprentice to work for the company for a full five years without leaving their employment or going on strike. The company on its part undertook to pay the apprentice and provide both work experience and college education for as long as the apprentice continued passing annual examinations. Failure in the examinations resulted in the apprentice having to work full-time with only the work experience content of the agreement until completion of the five years.

Typical pay for a first year apprentice between 1955 and 1959 was around two pounds five shillings  (£2.25)  for a 44-hour week (8am to 6pm  Monday to Thursday and finishing at 5pm on Fridays). Special ‘clocking in’ clocks were used to record arrival and departure time with penalties of 15 minutes deduction of pay for clocking in late at any time – even one minute - after the correct starting time. Many apprentices needed a state subsistence allowance in the early years since lodging (digs) typically cost about two pounds ten shillings a week. Nearly all apprentices were living away from their home town.

Initially apprentices typically spent 3 to 4 months working on production lines producing components for radios and TV’s such as transformers, deflection coils, [[printed circuit boards]], 13 channel tuners and various other sub-assemblies. These departments predominately employed women between 16 and 60 years old, many of whom were bussed daily to the factory from the surrounding Cambridgeshire villages. Further time was spent in the machine shop operating power presses, fly presses, and capstan lathes. Some apprentices spent time in the toolroom, others in the maintenance department helping senior engineers maintain the plant and equipment throughout the factory. In the later stages of their apprenticeship, apprentices might spend six months to a year in research departments, the ‘model shop’, the drawing office or at other Pye facilities which allowed or encouraged original thought. The Pye "Service Centre" in Cambridge as well as Centres in Glasgow and Edinburgh also provided hands on expericence with the help of experienced technicians.

Apprentices attended the Cambridgeshire Technical College and School of Art (later [[Cambridge College of Arts and Technology]] and now Ruskin Anglia University) for one day and one evening a week during term time to study engineering. Study was for [[City and Guilds]] Examinations or [[Ordinary National Certificate]] followed by [[Higher National Certificate]] in electrical or mechanical engineering. Some apprentices managed to voluntarily attend college for extra evenings to study complementary courses, typically radio and TV servicing or Telecommunications. Further study led some apprentices on to become members of the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]] and [[Institute of Measurement and Control]].

The apprentices were members of the Association of Pye Limited Apprentices (APLA) Association which arranged weekend educational visits to the Radio Show at Earls Court, the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] and other educational venues. On the lighter side they also organized a number of ball room dances in [[Cambridge]] and some very popular events featuring the Jazz Bands of [[Chris Barber]] and [[Acker Bilk]] who were in their heyday at that time. In 1959 they participated in the annual [[Poppy Day]] collection running a flat-bed lorry (truck) around Cambridge with a closed circuit camera and multiple monitor hook-up.

Pye also employed a smaller number of Graduate Apprentices who usually were at least 18 years old and had some [[A level]] Certificates. These apprentices typically started in a research department.

Around 1960 Pye apprentices started participating in newly offered Sandwich Courses at the College of Arts and Technology (CAT). Apprentices spent six months at the CAT and then six months working at Pye Cambridge Works Limited. After three years a [[Higher National Diploma]] was awarded. Later a fourth year was added which qualified participants for the entry requirements for the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]] (I.E.E. now the I.E.T.). Many apprentices continued with extra studies to later become a [[Chartered Engineer (UK)]] with full membership of their appropriate Institute.

'''Ernest Binfield Havell''' (16 September 1861 – 31 December 1934), who published under the name '''E.B. Havell,''' was an influential English [[arts administrator]], [[art historian]] and author of numerous books about [[Indian art]] and [[Indian architecture|architecture]]. He was a member of the [[Havell family]] of artists and art educators. He was the principal of the [[Government College of Art &amp; Craft, Kolkata|Government School of Art, Calcutta]] from 1896 to 1905, where, along with [[Abanindranath Tagore]], he developed a style of art and art education based on Indian rather than Western models, which led to the foundation of the [[Bengal school of art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitter|first=Partha |title=Indian art |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FHxsDV1GDOIC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=Ernest+Binfield+Havell+education&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ek6-6QKq--&amp;sig=s5l_7kw7or0vB99ORZT6iiUucFo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=sbLPTMbKLoG-uwPStZyBBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwBDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Ernest%20Binfield%20Havell%20education&amp;f=false|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-284221-8|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ny"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/20/arts/design/20bose.html|title=Art Review: Indian Modernism via an Eclectic and Elusive Artist|last=Cotter|first=Holland|date=19 August 2008|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Ernest was born in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] in the [[English people|English]] county of [[Berkshire]] in 1861,&lt;ref name=fa/&gt; the son of Charles Richard Havell and his wife, Charlotte Amelia Lord.

==Career==
In India, Havell initially served the [[Madras School|Madras School of Art]] as Superintendent for a decade from 1884. He arrived Calcutta on 5 July 1896 and joined as Superintendent of the [[Government College of Art &amp; Craft, Kolkata|Government School of Art, Calcutta]] next day. In between, he went to England for a year from April 1902 to March 1903. While in England, he published two valuable articles on Indian art in the October 1902 and January 1903 issues of a well known art journal of London, ''The Studio''. In January 1906 he left for England on long leave and finally in 1908, he was removed from the post.&lt;ref&gt;Bagal, Jogesh Chandra (1966). ''History of the Govt. College of Art and Craft'' in the ''Centenary: Government College of Art &amp; Craft, Calcutta'', Calcutta: Government College of Art &amp; Craft, pp.21–34&lt;/ref&gt;

Havell worked with [[Abanindranath Tagore]] to redefine Indian art education. He established the Indian Society of Oriental Art, which sought to adapt British art education in [[India]] so as to reject the previous emphasis placed on European traditions in favour of revivals of native Indian styles of art, in particular the [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] miniature tradition.

==Personal life==
He married Angelique Wilhelmina Jacobsen in 1895 at [[St Giles, London]], Middlesex, England. The couple had a daughter, Sonia Joyce Havell in 1902.&lt;ref name=fa&gt;[http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/s/c/h/John-K-Schlosser/GENE3-0018.html Descendants of Luke Havell]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15631">The '''Florida statewide teachers' strike of 1968''' was a [[strike action]] in the state of [[Florida]] in February and March 1968 by teachers and other education workers belonging to the [[Florida Education Association]] (FEA). The cause of the strike was under-funding of the state's educational system at a time when attendance was rising sharply, and low pay and benefits for teachers. The strike lasted from a few days in some [[school district]]s to three months in others. Although a special session of the [[Florida Legislature]] approved higher taxes to pay for more school funding, FEA members felt the funding hikes were not enough and voted to continue striking. No additional funding was forthcoming, however, and most local affiliates of the FEA settled their contracts and went back to work by March.

The 1968 Florida strike is considered the first statewide teachers' strike in United States history.&lt;ref&gt;"It was the nation's first statewide walkout of public-school teachers." "Walkout in Florida", ''Time'', March 1, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The claim of 'first statewide teachers' strike in U. S. history' is also made by the [[Utah Education Association]]:[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,830441,00.html "Teachers: Showdown in Utah," Time Magazine,Friday, May. 24, 1963]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes of the strike==
The primary causes of the strike were an increase in activism among Florida's teachers, leading to the transformation of the FEA into a labor union, and state underfunding of the Florida education system.

===Rise of the Florida teacher strike (1968)===
The [[Florida Education Association]] was established in 1886 as an affiliate of the [[National Education Association]] (NEA). It was an association rather than a [[trade union|labor union]], and was opposed to [[collective bargaining]] and strikes.

In 1963, [[Pat Tornillo]], a teacher in the [[Dade County, Florida|Dade County]] school system, ran for the presidency of the Dade County Classroom Teachers Association (DCCTA). He won by calling for greater organizational militancy and the desegregation of teaching staff.&lt;ref name="Tornillo"&gt;Fish, "School Crisis Echoes '67 Deadlock", ''Orlando Sentinel'', March 16, 1992; Mailander, "From Teacher to Union Boss", ''Miami Herald'', September 17, 1996; Park, "The Old School of Power", ''Miami New Times'', September 19, 1996; Rado, "For Florida Schools, 'Mr. T' is King of Blackboard Jungle", ''St. Petersburg Times'', September 24, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tornillo's election was a sign of a wave of union-like militancy sweeping the NEA in Florida and nationally. Since its inception, the NEA had rejected collective bargaining and strikes as unprofessional. But after the [[American Federation of Teachers]] won collective bargaining rights for teachers in New York City and formed the [[United Federation of Teachers]], many NEA members began to push for the association to act more like a union. In 1961, about 200 of the NEA's largest urban locals formed the [[National Council of Urban Education Associations]] to push the national organization toward collective bargaining. The caucus was successful: The same year, the NEA Representative Assembly (RA) passed a resolution establishing an "Urban Project", adopting a policy of "professional negotiations" akin to collective bargaining, and requiring the NEA to provide staff, research and financial assistance to locals involved in "professional negotiations." By 1965, the NEA was providing nearly $885,000 a year to locals in support of "professional negotiations", up from a mere $28,000 in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, "A Review of Events in Professional Negotiations", ''Theory Into Practice'', April 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, pro-unionization forces in the NEA pushed to remove the organization's prohibition against strikes. They were unsuccessful, but did win approval of a "sanctions" policy. "Sanctions" included waging a [[public relations]] campaign against the school district, encouraging teachers to not accept teaching positions with the school system, refusing to provide unpaid services (such as tutoring or supervision of clubs), and political action to defeat anti-union politicians. "Sanctions" could be employed against any school district which, in the opinion of the local association, had engaged in "unethical or arbitrary" policies or which had refused "sound professional practices."&lt;ref&gt;"Teachers' Boycott", ''Time'', August 17, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; The first time the NEA voted sanctions against an entire state was in Utah in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,830441,00.html "Teachers: Showdown in Utah," Time Magazine,Friday, May. 24, 1963]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tornillo eagerly embraced professional negotiations and sanctions, and in 1966 he forced the Dade County school system to open negotiations with the DCCTA. Although the national NEA was obligated to provide assistance, the FEA was not and refused to become involved in Tornillo's professional negotiations. Nevertheless, the DCCTA won a contract. But FEA's reluctance to support the local association led Tornillo and other leaders to lobby the state association to become more militant.&lt;ref name="Tornillo" /&gt;

===State underfunding of education===
Florida, like many American states, strictly regulates the way in which local school districts may fund education. [[Property taxes]] are the largest source of income, and may be levied by each local school district under a formula controlled by the state legislature.  However, the state of Florida also provides funds for a variety of educational programs under formulas established by in state law. These programmatic funds are often funded by the state's [[sales taxes]] and so-called [[sin taxes]].

In 1967, Florida's schools were suffering from a large influx of students. The [[post-World War II baby boom]], U.S. [[human migration|migration]], and [[emigration]] into the state had caused school enrollment to rise by more than 50 percent, yet little school building or hiring of new personnel had taken place. The underfunding of Florida public schools was acknowledged by most elected leaders, but there seemed little public demand for increased school funding.&lt;ref&gt;"Deadlock" ''Orlando Sentinel'', March 16, 1992; Thomas, "25 Years After Strike, Schools Still at Issue", ''St. Petersburg Times'', February 21, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strike==

===Legislative inaction===
1966 was an election year. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Claude R. Kirk, Jr.]] ran for [[Governor#United States|governor]] and won, becoming the first Republican governor since 1877. Kirk had campaigned heavily on a promise to improve funding for education, but he also made a pledge not to raise taxes.

During the 1967 legislature session, the FEA lobbied the state legislature hard for more funding for public schools. State legislative action had often been the only way for NEA locals to win better pay and working conditions prior to the enactment of the professional negotiations policy, so FEA was no newcomer to politics. FEA asked for a minimum teacher salary of $5,000 a year and a more equitable means of funding schools than property taxes. The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]-controlled state legislature approved a higher sales tax to provide for more school funding. But Kirk vetoed the budget, and Republican legislators upheld the [[Veto#United States|veto]].&lt;ref name="Strike"&gt;Farrell, "1968 Strike a Landmark for Schools", ''Miami Herald'', February 2, 1998; Fish, "School Crisis Echoes '67 Deadlock", ''Orlando Sentinel'', March 16, 1992; Thomas, "25 Years After Strike, Schools Still at Issue", ''St. Petersburg Times'', February 21, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fall 1967 spot-strikes===
Many Florida teachers were angered by the Gov. Kirk's veto. An August 1967 rally at the [[Tangerine Bowl (1947–82)|Tangerine Bowl]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] drew 30,000 teachers, who demanded state action. FEA leaders began talking of holding a statewide strike.

Spot strikes occurred throughout the state after the August rally. Even though public employee strikes are illegal in Florida, teachers in [[Pinellas County, Florida|Pinellas]] and Broward counties struck in September.&lt;ref&gt;The teachers actually resigned in order to avoid the legal penalties which accompanied a strike.&lt;/ref&gt; Schools in many districts closed, although no school districts were shuttered. Courts ordered the teachers back into the classroom, but hundreds of teachers still stayed out—some for several weeks.&lt;ref name="Strike" /&gt;

===February 1968 statewide strike===
The September spot-strikes galvanized public opinion into supporting the changes the teachers demanded. Gov. Kirk called a special session of the legislature in January 1968. In a bipartisan effort, legislators raised taxes to expand state funding for school building and to pay for higher teacher salaries. Gov. Kirk signed the tax and funding package immediately.&lt;ref name="Strike" /&gt;

But most teachers felt the increases were not enough, and a statewide strike occurred. A special convention of the FEA voted to approve a resolution which condemned the increases as inadequate.&lt;ref name="Selden"&gt;Selden, ''The Teacher Rebellion'', 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1968, FEA president [[Jane Arnold]] said the state association would support local teachers if they walked off the job. Thousands did. Since strikes were illegal, what actually happened were mass resignations.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Waldron, "Strike by Teachers Ending in Florida", New York Times, March 9, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

Schools closed in roughly two-thirds of Florida's counties. Many individual schools closed in those districts which managed to remain open and functioning. At the height of the strike, 25,712 educators—about 40 percent of the state's teachers—walked out.

The impact of the strike was not uniform, however. Strikes lasted only a few days in some districts, while in others teachers walked picket lines for weeks. In Pinellas County, the local education association stayed out for six weeks, and some small groups of teachers struck for as long as three months.&lt;ref name="Strike" /&gt;

Gov. Kirk and the legislature stood firm, however, and refused to appropriate more money or raise taxes further.

Local school districts began taking action to break the strike. Arnold and other FEA leaders were threatened with arrest. Tornillo was fined $30,000 and given a two-year jail term (which, after appeal, he was not forced to serve). School districts hired substitute teachers as [[Strike action#"Scab"|strikebreakers]], and local businesses paid their employees to teach classes.&lt;ref name="Strike" /&gt;

Most teachers went back after only a few weeks, when it became clear that public support for the teachers, weak at the beginning of the strike, had shrunk dramatically. "'We thought they (the public) would be with us,' Arnold said. 'We thought it would unite the community and the teachers. It did a little bit of the opposite. ... A lot of teachers lost their innocence. They thought the community liked them.'"&lt;ref name="Strike" /&gt; Local education associations began to negotiate their own settlements, often agreeing to not challenge school districts for terminating the most militant teachers.&lt;ref name="Selden" /&gt; By the end of March, nearly all teachers were back at work, and the strike was over.

==Assessment of the strike==
The strike was the nation's first statewide teachers' strike, keeping more than 40 percent of Florida teachers at home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1968/Pope-Paul-VI/Garbage-Strike/12303153093431-7/ "1968 Year In Review, UPI.com"]&lt;/ref&gt; Education funding rose significantly, but the organization felt that it did not rise enough to meet the needs identified by the teachers. From this perspective, the strike was not a success. However, FEA did obtain much higher funding for education and convinced Gov. Kirk to break his no-new-taxes pledge.

The strike had a profound effect on the national NEA. Following the 1968 Florida strike, delegates to the NEA Representative Assembly (the organization's national governing body) approved a resolution which—for the first time—sanctioned teacher strikes (calling them "withdrawal of services") and denouncing state attempts to ban them.&lt;ref&gt;Urban, Wayne J. "The Making of a Teachers' Union: The National Education Association, 1957–1972." ''Historical Studies in Education.'' Spring 1993; Hartman, James B. "Collective Bargaining in the University." ''Interchange.'' 6:1 (March 1975).&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution was a direct outcome of the statewide Florida strike.&lt;ref&gt;Urban, Wayne J. "Power and Ideology in a Teacher Walkout: Florida, 1968." ''[[Journal of Collective Negotiations|Journal of Collective Negotiations in the Public Sector]].'' Spring 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

A longer-term effect of the strike was to dramatically improve the outlook for teachers' unions in Florida. FEA members were radicalized by the strike and the statewide federation later won significant court and legislative victories which legalized and promoted the formation of teacher and education unions in the state. Although the 1968 strike would lead to the fragmentation of the FEA in 1974, education unions merged back into one organization in 2000, and as of 2006 unions were recognized in school districts covering 90 percent of the state's education workers.&lt;ref&gt;Because Florida is a [[Right-to-work law|right-to-work]] state, FEA "represents" 200,000 potential members, or 90 percent of the state's public school educational workforce. But only about 120,000 of these individuals actually belong to FEA local unions and pay dues. Still, that represents about 60 percent of the state's educational workforce.

Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel'', May 21, 1999; Kleindienst, "Merged Teacher Union Is Poised for Education Battle", ''Orlando Sentinel'', June 19, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; FEA is now one of Florida's largest unions, and the second-largest in the [[Florida AFL-CIO]].

Afterwards he founded elearning company Fuel which was subsequently sold 10 years later to a US compliance and ethics company in 2007.&lt;ref name=trainingzone/&gt;

The main product, which is the Fuse platform, evolved from the Fuse School. This is a foundation and charity, established in 2008, helping to share free of charge Maths, English and ICT secondary school curricula all over the world.

Two years later in 2010 the platform sold on licenses, was brought to the world and called Fusion Universal. After two and half years of operating in the market, the company was renamed to Fuse Universal.

The '''Institute of Information Technology Advancement''' (IITA) is a [[South Korea]] government organization under the National IT Industry Promotion Agency (NIPA), working in the fields of [[research and development]] (R&amp;D) and [[information technology]] (IT).

Many IT-projects in Korea are funded by the IITA.

==IITA Scholarship==
IITA also offers the Korean government's "IITA Scholarship Program" to qualified international [[Graduate school|graduate]] students enrolled in Korean universities in majors such as IT, [[computer engineering]], computer science, [[electronics]] and related fields. Applications are possible twice a year (in spring and fall). Those already enrolled in a Korean university must have an academic advisor. All applications must be made through the participating schools on behalf of the students. The scholarships cover tuition fees and all other expenses for two years (masters) or four years (for a [[PhD]] degree).

The '''International Association for Feminist Economics (IAFFE)''' is a non-profit international association dedicated to raising awareness and inquiry of [[feminist economics]]. It has approximately six hundred members in sixty-four countries.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.iaffe.org/pages/about-iaffe/history/|publisher=International Association for Feminist Economics (IAFFE)|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The association publishes a quarterly journal entitled ''[[Feminist Economics (journal)|Feminist Economics]]''.&lt;ref name=Purpose&gt;{{cite web |title= Purposes and activities |url= http://www.iaffe.org/pages/about-iaffe/purposes-activities-copy/ |publisher=International Association for Feminist Economics (IAFFE) |accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1998 IAFFE has held [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] [[Special Consultative Status#Special|special consultative status]].&lt;ref name=Consult&gt;{{cite web | last= Willetts | first= Peter | title= List Non-Governmental Organisations in Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, as of August 2003 - ECOSOC Special Consultative Status | url= http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/p.willetts/NGOS/NGO-2003.HTM#special |publisher=City University London | accessdate=7 June 2014 | quote= 598.

The organization is made up of [[Administrative division|'chapters']] which conduct panel meetings alongside the meetings of other economic groups such as, the [[European Association for Evolutionary Political Economy|European Association for Evolutionary and Political Economy (EAEPE)]] and the [[American Economic Association|American Economic Association (AEA)]].

== History ==
In 1990 [[Diana Strassmann]] organized a panel named, ''Can feminism find a home in economics?'' Members of the audience were invited specifically, by [[Jean Shackelford]] and April Aerni, to join a start-up network for economists which would be overtly feminist in outlook. In 1992 this network became the International Association for Feminist Economics (IAFFE) with Shackleford becoming their first president.&lt;ref name="Beyond"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Nelson | first1 = Julie A. | last2 = Ferber | first2 = Marianne | author-link1 = Julie A.

In 1998 IAFFE was made an [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] with [[Special Consultative Status#Special|special consultative status]] to the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council of the United Nations (ECOSOC)]].&lt;ref name=Consult /&gt;

By 2003 IAFFE had more than five hundred members from over thirty countries.&lt;ref name=Beyond /&gt; The association's president from 2003 to 2004 was [[Lourdes Benería]]. Shahra Razavi paid tribute to Benería in a speech at the IAFFE conference in 2012 describing Benería's work as, "not only empirically grounded and conceptually informed, but also contributing to a feminist critique that is systemic and connected to a broader critique of capitalism".&lt;ref name=Homage&gt;{{cite web|last1=Al-Adhami|first1=Rheem |last2=Razavi |first2=Shahra| title= Paying Homage: Shahra Razavi on the life and work of feminist economist Lourdes Benería|url=http://www.unrisd.org/80256B3C005BE6B5/search/394D8E693A63B3BFC1257A33004A3816?OpenDocument|publisher=United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD)|accessdate=7 June 2014|date=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IAFFE was awarded a grant of $1.5&amp;nbsp;million in 2010 from the [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency|Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA)]], to continue their work, including the publication of special issues of ''Feminist Economics''.&lt;ref name=SIDA&gt;{{cite web |title=International feminist organization based at UNL earns $1.5 million grant |url=http://newsroom.unl.edu/releases/2010/01/22/International+feminist+organization+based+at+UNL+earns+$1.5+M+grant |publisher=University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) |accessdate=7 June 2014 |date=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the association has gone on to number six hundred members in sixty-four countries.&lt;ref name=History /&gt;

== Chapters ==

=== European chapter ===
At the same time as IAFFE was setting up, a separate group of women, including [[Edith Kuiper]], in the Netherlands organized a conference on feminist perspectives on economic theory called ''Out of the Margins''. The conference brought many like minded people together who continued to network with one another and be involved in groups and activism, sometimes involving the IAFFE. (Another small group of Dutch economists founded another organization named FENN, the Feminist Economics Network in the Netherlands). In 1998, at a second Amsterdam conference, arrangements were made to hold the first meeting of IAFFE European chapter.&lt;ref name="Beyond_2"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Nelson | first1 = Julie A. | last2 = Ferber | first2 = Marianne | author-link1 = Julie A.

The first official meeting of IAFFE Europe took place in Brussels in November 1998, there were twenty-five participants from ten countries and, as a result of the meeting, an e-mail list was created. Information about futures sessions and a report of the first meeting was sent to those interested, this led to more IAFFE panels (in 1999 and 2000) being organized for meetings of the [[European Association for Evolutionary Political Economy|European Association for Evolutionary and Political Economy (EAEPE)]].&lt;ref name=Beyond_2 /&gt;

The European chapter of IAFFE continued to meet and [[Ailsa McKay]], professor of economics at [[Glasgow Caledonian University]], was its chair until her death in March 2014.&lt;ref name=McKay&gt;{{cite news |last=Stewart |first=Catriona |title=Tributes for Caley Uni professor Ailsa |url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/tributes-for-caley-uni-professor-ailsa-154863n.23623353 |accessdate=7 June 2014 |newspaper=Evening Times|date=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australian and New Zealand Association for Feminist Economics (ANZAFFE) ===
The ''Out of the Margins'' conference resulted in a network of contacts being formed, one of these networks gradually became the Australian and New Zealand Association for Feminist Economics (ANZAFFE), a chapter of IAFFE. The chapter includes a small feminist economics group in Wellington, New Zealand led by [[Prue Hyman]].&lt;ref name=Beyond_2 /&gt;

=== United States chapter ===
The American chapter of IAFFE hold sessions at the [[American Economic Association|American Economic Association's (AEA)]] annual meetings.&lt;ref name=Beyond_2 /&gt;

== The Rhonda Williams Prize ==
IAFFE offer a prize scholarship in memory of former associate editor of ''Feminist Economics'' (1994–1998), Rhonda Williams. In 2014 the amount awarded was $1,500 to be given out at their summer conference to allow underrepresented groups in IAFFE attend the conference and present a paper.

Award winners must demonstrate a commitment to one or more of the following issues: inequalities; interrelationships (racism, sexism, homophobia, and classism); and connections between scholarship and activism. Funding is provided by both [[Routledge]] and, [[Taylor &amp; Francis]].&lt;ref name=RW_prize&gt;{{cite web|title=Upcoming Events|url=http://www.diversifyingecon.org/index.php/Upcoming_Events|publisher=Diversifying Economic Quality (Div.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35247">'''Interpersonal emotion regulation''' is the process of changing the emotional experience of one's self or another person through social interaction. It encompasses both '''intrinsic emotion regulation''' (also known as [[emotional self-regulation]]), in which one attempts to alter their own feelings by recruiting social resources, as well as '''extrinsic emotion regulation''', in which one deliberately attempts to alter the trajectory of other people's feelings.

== History of concept ==
The concept of interpersonal emotion regulation stems from earlier research into [[emotional self-regulation]], which is the within-person process whereby people influence and change their own feelings.&lt;ref name="Gross2"&gt;Gross, J. J. (1998). The emerging field of emotion regulation: An integrative review. Review of general psychology, 2, 271-299.&lt;/ref&gt;  The field of psychology has traditionally focused on ''intra''personal processes in which a person manages their own emotions individually outside of the social context&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barthel|first=Abigail L.|last2=Hay|first2=Aleena|last3=Doan|first3=Stacey N.|last4=Hofmann|first4=Stefan G.|date=2018-10-18|title=Interpersonal Emotion Regulation: A Review of Social and Developmental Components|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/bec.2018.19|journal=Behaviour Change|pages=1–14|doi=10.1017/bec.2018.19|issn=0813-4839}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, modern theories have expanded the concept of emotion regulation to include ''inter''personal processes, in which emotion is regulated with or through other people. Interpersonal models emphasize that humans are social creatures who rarely experience emotions in isolation, and instead more commonly share, express, and manage their emotions with the help of others.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beckes|first=Lane|last2=Coan|first2=James A.|date=2011|title=Social Baseline Theory: The Role of Social Proximity in Emotion and Economy of Action|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1751-9004.2011.00400.x|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|language=en|volume=5|issue=12|pages=976–988|doi=10.1111/j.1751-9004.2011.00400.x|issn=1751-9004|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zaki|first=Jamil|last2=Williams|first2=W.

== Concept ==

=== Intrinsic interpersonal emotion regulation ===
Intrinsic interpersonal emotion regulation involves managing one's own emotions through social interaction&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;, such as seeking [[social support]] or [[reassurance]] from others. Examples include calling a friend for advice, venting to a partner about a stressful situation, or engaging in conversation as a distraction from distress. In addition to regulating negative emotions, people also seek to amplify positive emotions by sharing good news with others. As with intrapersonal emotion regulation, people typically attempt to use interpersonal emotion regulation improve their affective state by decreasing negative emotions or increase positive emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsai|first=Jeanne L.|date=2007|title=Ideal Affect: Cultural Causes and Behavioral Consequences|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.sagepub.com%2Fdoi%2F10.1111%2Fj.1745-6916.2007.00043.x|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|language=en|volume=2|issue=3|pages=242–259|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6916.2007.00043.x|issn=1745-6916|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Extrinsic interpersonal emotion regulation ===
Extrinsic interpersonal emotion regulation refers to the deliberate influence of others' [[emotion|feelings]].&lt;ref name="Niven"&gt;Niven, K., Totterdell, P., &amp; Holman, D. (2009). A classification of controlled interpersonal affect regulation strategies. Emotion, 9, 498-509.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the many ways how social factors influence an individual's emotions&lt;ref&gt;Hofmann, S. G. &amp; Doan, S. N. (2018). "The social foundations of emotion: Developmental, cultural, and clinical dimensions". Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. {{ISBN|978-1433829277}}.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Examples include trying to cheer up a friend who is upset, trying to make one's partner feel guilty for neglecting oneself, or trying to calm a stressed coworker. These examples illustrate that interpersonal emotion regulation may be used to make others feel better or worse, although making others feel better appears to be far more common.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== In groups ===
Many instances of interpersonal emotion regulation, such as those described above, are dyadic; in other words, they involve one person trying to influence the feelings of another person. However, interpersonal emotion regulation can occur between larger social groups. For example, in the workplace a leader might try to influence the feelings of a whole group of followers to make them feel more enthusiastic and motivated.&lt;ref&gt;George, J. M. (2000). Emotions and leadership: The role of emotional intelligence. Human relations, 53, 1027-1055.&lt;/ref&gt; Or in support groups, the whole group might work together to influence the feelings of a member to make the member feel less anxious or depressed.&lt;ref&gt;Thoits, P. A. (1996). Managing the emotions of others. Symbolic Interaction, 19, 85-109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpersonal emotion regulation is used in most of the important social relationships that we have. Within the fields of developmental and clinical [[psychology]], researchers have long-recognized that people try to influence others' emotions (e.g., mothers influence the feelings of their babies,&lt;ref&gt;Field, T. (1994). The effects of mothers' physical and emotional unavailability on emotion regulation. Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 59, 208-227.&lt;/ref&gt; therapists try to alleviate the sadness of their clients&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, H. C., Barkham, M., Stiles, W. B., &amp; Goldfried, M. R. (2002). Patterns of client emotion in helpful sessions of cognitive-behavioral and psychodynamic-interpersonal therapy. Journal of counseling psychology, 49, 376-380.&lt;/ref&gt;). More recently, social and organizational psychologists have also documented the use of interpersonal emotion regulation within romantic and familial relationships&lt;ref&gt;Niven, K., Macdonald, I., &amp; Holman, D. (2012). You spin me right round: Cross-relationship variability in interpersonal emotion regulation. Frontiers in Psychology, 3, 394.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vangelisti, A. L., Daly, J. A., &amp; Rudnick, J. R. (1991). Making people feel guilty in conversations: Techniques and correlates. Human Communication Research, 18, 3-39.&lt;/ref&gt; and in a range of work settings (e.g., hospitals,&lt;ref&gt;Francis, L. E., Monahan, K., &amp; Berger, C. (1999). A laughing matter? The uses of humor in medical interactions. Motivation and Emotion, 23, 154-177.&lt;/ref&gt; law firms,&lt;ref&gt;Lively, K. J. (2000). Reciprocal emotion management: Working together to maintain stratification in private law firms. Work and Occupations, 27, 32-63.&lt;/ref&gt; debt collection agencies,&lt;ref name="Sutton"&gt;Sutton, R. I. (1991). Maintaining norms about expressed emotions: The case of bill collectors. Administrative Science Quarterly, 36, 245-268.&lt;/ref&gt; and prisons&lt;ref&gt;Niven, K., Totterdell, P., &amp; Holman, D. (2007). Changing moods and influencing people: The use and effects of emotional influence behaviours at HMP Grendon. Prison Service Journal, 173, 39-45.&lt;/ref&gt;). Interpersonal emotion regulation may even be used towards complete strangers as a way of making social interactions run more smoothly.&lt;ref&gt;Cahill, S. E., &amp; Eggleston, R. (1994). Managing emotions in public: The case of wheelchair users. Social Psychology Quarterly, 57, 300-312.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Related processes ===

Interpersonal emotion regulation overlaps with [[social support]], which involves giving others emotional, informational, or practical support.&lt;ref&gt;House, J. S., &amp; Kahn, R. L. (1985). Measures and concepts of social support. In S. Cohen and S. L. Syme (Eds.), Social support and health (pp. 79-108). Orlando, FL: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Models of interpersonal emotion regulation specify social support within the framework of regulatory goals to improve the feelings of one's self (by seeking support) or another person (by providing support). Emotion regulation mechanisms of social support include attentional deployment (e.g. distraction away from negative thoughts and toward the conversation) and cognitive change (e.g. encouragement to "look on the bright side" or change one's negative interpretation of a given situation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marroquín|first=Brett|date=2011|title=Interpersonal emotion regulation as a mechanism of social support in depression|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2011.09.005|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=31|issue=8|pages=1276–1290|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2011.09.005|issn=0272-7358|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpersonal emotion regulation also shares links with other processes by which people come to influence others' emotions, such as [[emotional contagion]], in which the emotions of one person are 'caught' by another person as a result of mere contact (e.g., if someone was having a terrible day, they might 'infect' their friends with their bad mood).&lt;ref&gt;Hatfield, E., Cacioppo, J. T., &amp; Rapson, R. L. (1993). Emotional contagion. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 2, 96-99.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the compulsion to tell other people about our emotional experiences (termed the [[social sharing of emotions]]) can also result in other people coming to feel what we feel.&lt;ref&gt;Rimé, B., Finkenauer, C., Luminet, O., Zech, E., &amp; Philippot, P. (1998). Social sharing of emotion: New evidence and new questions. European review of social psychology, 9, 145-189.&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between these processes and interpersonal emotion regulation regards the [[Automatic and Controlled Processes (ACP)|level of processing]] involved. Interpersonal emotion regulation is a controlled process, whereby a person intentionally tries to change the way others feel. In contrast, emotional contagion is thought to be relatively [[automaticity|automatic]], engaged without conscious awareness, while social sharing is somewhat more conscious but typically lacks the intent to influence others' emotions.

Interpersonal emotion regulation relates to [[emotional labor]], the [[regulation of emotion]] as part of one's job role.&lt;ref&gt;Grandey, A. A. (2000). Emotion regulation in the workplace: A new way to conceptualize emotional labor. Journal of occupational health psychology, 5, 95-110.&lt;/ref&gt; In emotional labor, an employee (usually in a service or care role) is required to manage his or her emotions as part of the job (e.g., 'service with a smile'). Because employees can also be required to manage the emotions of their customers or clients as part of their job (e.g., debt collectors are required to elicit anxiety in relaxed debtors to encourage them to make a payment&lt;ref name="Sutton" /&gt;), interpersonal emotion regulation can be performed as a form of emotional labor.&lt;ref&gt;Niven, K., Totterdell, P., Holman, D., &amp; Cameron, D. (2012). Emotional labor at the unit-level. In A. Grandey, J. Diefendorff, &amp; D. Rupp (Eds.), Emotional labor in the 21st century: Diverse perspectives on emotion regulation at work. Psychology Press/Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another related process is interpersonal influence, which involves trying to change the attitudes and/or behaviors of other people.&lt;ref&gt;Kipnis, D., Schmidt, S. M., &amp; Wilkinson, I. (1980). Intraorganizational influence tactics: Exploration of getting one's way. Journal of Applied Psychology, 65, 440-452.&lt;/ref&gt; The key difference here is that interpersonal emotion regulation is primarily concerned with changing other people's feelings; any changes to attitudes or behaviors are secondary to the impact on emotion.

== Theories ==

=== Social Baseline Theory ===
Drawing from [[evolutionary psychology]], '''social baseline theory''' purports that humans have adapted to function in a social environment.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coan, J., &amp; Maresh, E. L. (2013). Social baseline theory and the social regulation of emotion. In J. Gross (Ed.), Handbook of emotion regulation (2nd ed.). New York, NY: Guilford Press&lt;/ref&gt; The brain acts under the assumption that proximity to other people is the norm, or baseline condition. As opposed to social isolation, which is associated with stress and poor health, social proximity is associated with attenuated cardiovascular, hormonal, and neural responses to threat, as well as longevity and physical health. The presence of others is theorized to help individuals conserve effort and metabolic resources through the social regulation of emotion. For example, the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] is less active during the down-regulation of negative affect while the presence of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eisenberger|first=Naomi I.|last2=Taylor|first2=Shelley E.|last3=Gable|first3=Shelly L.|last4=Hilmert|first4=Clayton J.|last5=Lieberman|first5=Matthew D.|date=2007|title=Neural pathways link social support to attenuated neuroendocrine stress responses|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.01.038|journal=NeuroImage|volume=35|issue=4|pages=1601–1612|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.01.038|issn=1053-8119|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coan|first=James A.|last2=Schaefer|first2=Hillary S.|last3=Davidson|first3=Richard J.|date=2006|title=Lending a Hand|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01832.x|journal=Psychological Science|volume=17|issue=12|pages=1032–1039|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01832.x|issn=0956-7976|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social proximity is hypothesized to confer emotion regulatory benefits through three mechanisms: 1) risk distribution, 2) load sharing, and 3) capitalization. Risk distribution lowers [[Vigilance (psychology)|vigilance]] towards threat because risks seem lower as group size increases. Load sharing involves the knowledge that close others can provide help and resources if needed. Finally, capitalization refers to the intensification of positive emotions when they are shared with others.

=== Map of Interpersonal Regulation ===
A prominent model proposed by Jamil Zaki and Craig Williams (2013) conceptualizes different classes of interpersonal emotion regulation along two orthogonal dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zaki|first=Jamil|last2=Williams|first2=W. Craig|date=2013|title=Interpersonal emotion regulation.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0033839|journal=Emotion|volume=13|issue=5|pages=803–810|doi=10.1037/a0033839|issn=1931-1516}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first, intrinsic ''vs'' extrinsic, refers to the target of regulatory efforts. Intrinsic regulation involves an attempt to change one's own emotions through social contact, while extrinsic regulation involves trying to change the emotions of another person or group of people. The second dimension, response-dependent vs. response-independent, refers to whether or not the regulatory efforts depend upon the behavior of other people. Processes that rely upon how others respond or behave are considered response-dependent, while strategies that do not depend upon others' behavior are classified as response-independent. This model yields four classes of interpersonal emotion regulation:

# Intrinsic response-dependent: An individual tries to change their own affect through interaction with another person, whose feedback impacts the regulatory attempt. [[Safety behaviors (anxiety)|Safety behaviors]] fall into this category. For example, to alleviate anxiety a child might seek comfort from his mother, who responds in a soothing manner. Some forms of [[Social sharing of emotions|social sharing]] can also be considered an intrinsic response-dependent strategy, insofar as the listener's feedback influences the speaker's affect. For instance, sharing good news can intensify one's positive affect, but only if the listener responds enthusiastically.
# Intrinsic response-independent: Processes in this category involve attempts to alter one's own emotional experience through social contact, but the regulatory success does not depend upon how others react or behave. Affect labeling, or putting feelings into words, can dampen the intensity of emotional experience&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torre|first=Jared B.|last2=Lieberman|first2=Matthew D.|date=2018-03-20|title=Putting Feelings Into Words: Affect Labeling as Implicit Emotion Regulation|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1754073917742706|journal=Emotion Review|volume=10|issue=2|pages=116–124|doi=10.1177/1754073917742706|issn=1754-0739}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commonly occurs during communication in social contexts without necessarily relying on the response of others. For instance, describing one's emotions through a conversation may result in a more nuanced understanding of one's feelings that facilitates coping.
# Extrinsic response-dependent: A person acts with the goal of changing another person's emotion, whose feedback plays an important role in indicating the success of the regulatory attempt. Examples include [[prosocial behavior]] and related processes such as [[Empathy|empathic]] responding that endeavor to improve other people's affective state. Feedback from the recipient is needed to signal whether or not they were helped.
# Extrinsic response-independent: This classification includes attempts to change another person's affective experience that to not depend upon that person's feedback. For example, [[Warm-glow giving|warm glow]] giving may result in the achieved extrinsic goal of engaging in prosocial behavior without receiving cues from the recipient as to whether or not they benefitted.

== Strategies ==

There are potentially hundreds of strategies that people can use to influence others' feelings. A series of studies reported by Niven and colleagues generated almost 400 unique strategies that could be differentiated primarily according to whether they are used to improve or to worsen others' feelings.&lt;ref name="Niven" /&gt; Another key distinction is between strategies that engage a person in the specific situation that has caused the emotion (e.g., trying to get the person to see a situation in a different light) and those that divert attention away (e.g., joking with the person).

Research based on Niven and colleagues' classification has indicated that these distinct strategy types have different effects on the well-being of the people who use them and also on the people who they are used towards.&lt;ref&gt;Martínez-Íñigo, D., Poerio, G. L., &amp; Totterdell, P. (2013). The association between controlled interpersonal affect regulation and resource depletion. Applied Psychology: Health and Well-being.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niven, K., Totterdell, P., Holman, D., &amp; Headley, T. (2012). Does regulating others' feelings influence people's own affective well-being? Journal of Social Psychology, 152, 246-260.&lt;/ref&gt; They may even have different implications for the quality of the relationship between these two parties.&lt;ref&gt;Niven, K., Holman, D., &amp; Totterdell, P. (2012). How to win friendship and trust by influencing people: An investigation of interpersonal affect regulation and the quality of relationships. Human Relations, 65, 777-805.&lt;/ref&gt;

A different way of distinguishing interpersonal emotion regulation strategies is according to the stage of the emotion that they focus on. Inspired by James Gross's process model of emotion,&lt;ref name="Gross"&gt;Gross, J. J. (1998). The emerging field of emotion regulation: An integrative review. Review of general psychology, 2, 271-299.&lt;/ref&gt; some researchers have suggested that there is a difference between strategies that try to change the underlying emotion someone is feeling and strategies that try to change the emotion that the person expresses outwardly.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, M. (2007). Building genuine trust through interpersonal emotion management: A threat regulation model of trust and collaboration across boundaries. Academy of Management Review, 32, 595-621.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Little, L. M., Kluemper, D., Nelson, D. L., &amp; Ward, A. (2013). More than Happy to Help? Customer‐Focused Emotion Management Strategies. Personnel Psychology, 66, 261-286.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In psychopathology ==
Patterns of interpersonal emotion dysregulation may contribute to the onset and maintenance of mental health disorders.

=== Anxiety disorders ===
[[Anxiety disorder|Anxiety disorders]] are perpetuated by avoidance of feared stimuli. [[Avoidance coping|Avoidance]] behaviors can include the presence of "safety people", who reduce the anxious individual's distress while [[Negative Reinforcement|negatively reinforcing]] the avoidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hofmann|first=Stefan G.|date=2014-05-23|title=Interpersonal Emotion Regulation Model of Mood and Anxiety Disorders|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10608-014-9620-1|journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research|volume=38|issue=5|pages=483–492|doi=10.1007/s10608-014-9620-1|issn=0147-5916}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an individual with panic disorder may ask her partner to drive her to work, which alleviates her fear of having a panic attack while driving. This pattern may lead to reliance upon others and contribute to continued avoidance (e.g. of driving a car alone). Another interpersonal strategy used in anxiety disorders is reassurance seeking. For example, someone with [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|obsessive compulsive disorder]] may rely upon a roommate to assure them that the doors have been locked, or an individual with [[generalized anxiety disorder]] may ask a romantic partner for reassurances of love.

=== Depression ===
Individuals with depression experience maladaptive interpersonal interactions, which contribute to their depressive symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hammen|first=Constance|date=2018-06-07|title=Stress Generation and Depression|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190681777.013.15|journal=Oxford Handbooks Online|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190681777.013.15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These behaviors include greater expressed negativity (e.g. criticism, blaming, demanding, and disengagement) toward romantic partners,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davila|first=Joanne|last2=Bradbury|first2=Thomas N.|last3=Cohan|first3=Catherine L.|last4=Tochluk|first4=Shelly|date=1997|title=Marital functioning and depressive symptoms: Evidence for a stress generation model.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037//0022-3514.73.4.849|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=73|issue=4|pages=849–861|doi=10.1037//0022-3514.73.4.849|issn=0022-3514}}&lt;/ref&gt; and negative feedback seeking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swann|first=William B.|last2=Wenzlaff|first2=Richard M.|last3=Krull|first3=Douglas S.|last4=Pelham|first4=Brett W.|date=1992|title=Allure of negative feedback: Self-verification strivings among depressed persons.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037//0021-843x.101.2.293|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|volume=101|issue=2|pages=293–306|doi=10.1037//0021-843x.101.2.293|issn=0021-843X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excessive reassurance seeking is also a vulnerability factor for depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joiner|first=Thomas E.|last2=Metalsky|first2=Gerald I.|date=2001-09|title=Excessive Reassurance Seeking: Delineating a Risk Factor Involved in the Development of Depressive Symptoms|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9280.00369|journal=Psychological Science|language=en|volume=12|issue=5|pages=371–378|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00369|issn=0956-7976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Osborne|first=David W.

Social interaction that diverts attention away from self-referential negative thinking and promotes cognitive reappraisal may help to alleviate depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marroquín|first=Brett|date=2011-12|title=Interpersonal emotion regulation as a mechanism of social support in depression|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2011.09.005|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=31|issue=8|pages=1276–1290|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2011.09.005|issn=0272-7358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Borderline personality disorder ===
According to the [[Biosocial theory|biosocial model]],&lt;ref&gt;Linehan, M. M. (1993). Cognitive-behavioral treatment of borderline personality disorder. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; individuals with [[borderline personality disorder]] develop intense emotional expression in part because they have been reinforced throughout development. For instance, a teenager with heightened emotional sensitivity is not taken seriously by her family until she threatens a suicide attempt. If her family responds with attention to extreme emotional expressions, she will learn to continue to express emotions in this way. Venting is another interpersonal emotion regulation strategy that is associated with personality disorder symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vollrath|first=Margarete|last2=Alnæs|first2=Randolf|last3=Torgersen|first3=Svenn|date=1998|title=Coping Styles Predict Change in Personality Disorders*|url=https://guilfordjournals.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fguilfordjournals.com%2Fdoi%2F10.1521%2Fpedi.1998.12.3.198|journal=Journal of Personality Disorders|language=en-US|volume=12|issue=3|pages=198–209|doi=10.1521/pedi.1998.12.3.198|issn=0885-579X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dixon-Gordon|first=Katherine L.|last2=Haliczer|first2=Lauren A.|last3=Conkey|first3=Lindsey C.|last4=Whalen|first4=Diana J.|date=2018|title=Difficulties in Interpersonal Emotion Regulation: Initial Development and Validation of a Self-Report Measure|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10862-018-9647-9|journal=Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment|volume=40|issue=3|pages=528–549|doi=10.1007/s10862-018-9647-9|issn=0882-2689|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychotherapy ===
Certain types of psychotherapy target interpersonal factors to improve well-being. [[Dialectical behavior therapy|Dialectical behavioral therapy]], originally developed for individuals with [[borderline personality disorder]], teaches clients interpersonal effectiveness, which includes a variety of skills for communicating emotions in a clear and socially acceptable manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lynch|first=Thomas R.|last2=Trost|first2=William T.|last3=Salsman|first3=Nicholas|last4=Linehan|first4=Marsha M.|date=2007|title=Dialectical Behavior Therapy for Borderline Personality Disorder|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.2.022305.095229|journal=Annual Review of Clinical Psychology|volume=3|issue=1|pages=181–205|doi=10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.2.022305.095229|issn=1548-5943|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Assertiveness|Assertiveness training]] is a behavioral intervention that teaches verbal and non-verbal assertiveness skills to inhibit anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frank|first=Jerome D.|date=1958|title=Psychotherapy by Reciprocal Inhibition by Joseph Wolpe|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/pbm.1958.0006|journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine|volume=2|issue=1|pages=123–125|doi=10.1353/pbm.1958.0006|issn=1529-8795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessment measures ==

Several questionnaires have been developed to measure people's self-reported use of interpersonal emotion regulation, including the Emotion Regulation of Others and Self (EROS),&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Niven, K., Totterdell, P., Stride, C., &amp; Holman, D. (2011). Emotion Regulation of Others and Self (EROS): The development and validation of a new individual difference measure.

=== Emotion Regulation of Others and Self ===
The Emotion Regulation of Others and Self (EROS) questionnaire &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Niven, K., Totterdell, P., Stride, C., &amp; Holman, D. (2011). Emotion Regulation of Others and Self (EROS): The development and validation of a new individual difference measure. Current Psychology, 30, 53-73.&lt;/ref&gt; is a freely available measure that assess strategies used to improve or worsen either one's own or another person's emotions, yielding a two-by-two framework: 1) intrinsic affect-improving, 2) intrinsic affect-worsening, 3) extrinsic affect-improving, and 4) extrinsic affect-worsening. The ''intrinsic'' subscale measures [[emotion self-regulation]] using 10 items. The ''extrinsic'' subscale measures deliberate attempts to improve or worsen others' emotions using 9 items.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.erosresearch.org/index.php/resources/tools/&lt;/ref&gt; There is low item endorsement for the affect-worsening dimension, suggesting that people rarely make deliberate attempts to worsen their own or others' emotions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, extrinsic affect-worsening is associated with health-related impairments, suggesting detrimental effects of engaging in these strategies likely due to negative social repercussions. Additionally, the affect-improving factor is unrelated to current levels of affect, which may be attributed to the scale's [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] properties or to a discrepancy between current mood state and strategy use (e.g., reporting use of affect-improving strategies more often while in a negative mood state).

=== Interpersonal Emotion Regulation Questionnaire ===
The Interpersonal Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (IERQ)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Hofmann, S. G., Carpenter, J. K., &amp; Curtiss, J. (2016). Interpersonal Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (IERQ): Scale development and psychometric characteristics. Cognitive Therapy and Research, 40, 341-356. doi: 0.1007/s10608-016-9756-2.&lt;/ref&gt; is a 20-item measure designed to assess how individuals regulate their own emotions through the use of others. The questionnaire was developed through [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] interviews with participants (e.g., "When you are feeling down, in what ways do you look to other people to help you feel better?"), whose responses were [[Quantitative research|quantitatively]] tested using exploratory and confirmatory [[factor analysis]] to derive 4 factors containing 5 items each. The 4 factors include Enhancing Positive Affect (seeking social interaction to enhance happiness), Perspective Taking (recruiting others to point out that other people are in a worse situation), Soothing (seeking comfort and sympathy from others), and Social Modeling (observing others for examples of how to cope).

=== Interpersonal Regulation Questionnaire ===
The Interpersonal Regulation Questionnaire (IRQ)&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=W. Craig|last2=Morelli|first2=Sylvia A.|last3=Ong|first3=Desmond C.|last4=Zaki|first4=Jamil|date=2018|title=Interpersonal emotion regulation: Implications for affiliation, perceived support, relationships, and well-being.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/pspi0000132|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=115|issue=2|pages=224–254|doi=10.1037/pspi0000132|issn=1939-1315|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a 16-item measure of intrinsic interpersonal emotion regulation that assesses individuals' ''tendency'' to recruit social resources in response to emotional events, as well as their perceived [[Self-efficacy|''efficacy'']] of how effective interpersonal strategies are in improving their emotional experiences. Because it is a less common for individuals to deliberately worsen their mood,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elliot|first=Andrew J.|last2=Thrash|first2=Todd M.|date=2002|title=Approach-avoidance motivation in personality: Approach and avoidance temperaments and goals.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.82.5.804|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=82|issue=5|pages=804–818|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.82.5.804|issn=1939-1315}}&lt;/ref&gt; the measure focuses on increasing positive emotions and decreasing negative emotions. High interpersonal emotion regulation tendency and efficacy is related to greater emotional expressivity, empathy, social connectedness, and supportive relationships.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Individuals who score high on efficacy are more likely to benefit from social support.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Difficulties in Interpersonal Regulation of Emotion ===
The Difficulties in Interpersonal Regulation of Emotion (DIRE)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; is a self-report measure of maladaptive interpersonal emotion regulation strategies that may relate to [[psychopathology]]. Respondents rate how likely they would be to use a variety of strategies in response to three vignettes about stressful hypothetical scenarios (task-oriented, romantic, social). The DIRS consists of four factors, including two intrapersonal (Accept, Avoid) and two interpersonal (Reassurance-seek, Vent) classes of strategies. Reassurance-seeking is related to overall emotion dysregulation, as well as [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[anxiety]] symptoms. Both reassurance-seeking and venting are associated with negative affect, interpersonal problems, stress, and [[borderline personality disorder]] symptoms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8398">The '''Kahn Lectures''' were series of lectures that took place from 1929 to 1931 at the Department of Art and Archaeology of [[Princeton University]], sponsored by the New York banker [[Otto Hermann Kahn]] (1867–1934). Kahn had funded visits by European scholars to Princeton since 1925, and the new lectures were announced as a continuation of the earlier ones.

[[File:Otto Kahn 1.jpg|thumb|Otto Kahn]]
In 1923, shortly after Otto Kahn's son had entered Princeton, the banker was approached by the art historian [[Charles Rufus Morey]], described by architectural historian Neil Levine as the prime mover of the Department of Art and Archaeology. Kahn agreed in 1924 to donate $1,500 a year for two years to finance extended visits by European scholars to the university. This was later extended for a third year.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of these scholars was the Russian classical scholar [[Michael Rostovtzeff]], who had already settled in the United States in 1918, after the Russian revolution. His lectures were later published as ''The Animal Style in South Russia and China''. The second was the French byzantinist [[Gabriel Millet]], who held the chair for Æsthetics and Art History at the [[Collège de France]]. The third was the British archaeologist and [[Hittites|hittitologist]] [[John Garstang]].&lt;ref&gt;Levine, p. xii. Rostovtzeff's lectures were published as ''The [[Animal Style]] in South Russia and China'' (Princeton monographs in art and archaeology, 14, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1929)&lt;/ref&gt;

After Kahn had become a member of the Visiting Committee of the Department in 1927, he promised to continue supporting lectures there. These were to begin in 1928/29 and would run for five years. The donation was reported on the front page of the ''[[New York Times]]'', which quoted Professor Morey's statement that the money would be used for the "continuation of the special lectures in art, archaeology, architecture and criticism which were initiated two years ago with Mr. Kahn's help". The report described the intended plan for "a course of eight lectures on different subjects given each year by a distinguished authority in his own field, while special emphasis will be placed on the selection of subjects not included in the Princeton curriculum."&lt;ref&gt;"Otto H. Kahn gives funds to Princeton to aid art", ''The New York Times'', 30 April 1928&lt;/ref&gt;

After considering [[Arthur Pillans Laurie]], [[Eugénie Sellers Strong]] and [[Herbert Joseph Spinden]], the Department settled on the Swedish art historian [[Johnny Roosval]], professor at Stockholm University, as the first lecturer. Roosval's lectures on Swedish art, described by Levine as "apparently not very exciting", were published in 1932. According to Levine, Roosval had been asked to extend his lectures to the modern architecture of Sweden, an area outside the expertise of the Swedish scholar, who was known for his studies of medieval art.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, p. xii-xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frank Lloyd Wright LC-USZ62-36384.jpg|thumb|Frank Lloyd Wright]]
For the second round of lectures, Morey originally invited the Dutch architect [[Jacobus Oud|J.J.P. Oud]], "a star in the rising pantheon of younger European architects". Morey had been influenced in this choice by an article on Oud by [[Henry-Russell Hitchcock]] in the magazine ''[[The Arts (magazine)|The Arts]]'' in February 1928. Oud accepted, although he would have preferred to hold his lectures later in the spring than was possible, but ultimately he had to cancel because of illness (one of his frequent periods of depression).&lt;ref&gt;Levine, p. xiii-xv.&lt;/ref&gt; After once again considering H. J. Spinden,&lt;ref&gt;Levine, p. xv&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baldwin Smith]], who was acting chair of the Department during Morey's absence in Europe, invited Frank Lloyd Wright.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt; Wright had recently published a number of pieces on architectural theory, but had little to do at the time, and the recent [[Wall Street Crash]] had made it look unlikely that he would get any new commissions for the time being.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, p. xvi-xvii&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Levine suggests that Wright's reason for accepting the offer was not primarily financial, but rather the "prestige of the venue and the bully pulpit it would afford him".&lt;ref&gt;Levine, p. xviii&lt;/ref&gt; According to the original donation by Kahn, each series was to consist of eight lectures, but Wright proposed that he would instead hold six lectures and arrange an exhibition of his own recent work "illustrating the ideas and principles involved in the ‘course'".&lt;ref&gt;Levine, p. xviii, citing a letter from Wright to Baldwin Smith, dated 6 June 1931, in the archives of The Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; According to Levine, Wright's Kahn lectures gave him a new and important experience and even "opened a new career path" for the architect, who continued to lecture extensively at universities and other institutions for the next year. His exhibition toured America in 1930 and Europe for six months in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, p. xxi&lt;/ref&gt; Wright's lectures were originally published in 1931 in the Princeton monograph series for art and archaeology. They were reprinted in 1987, and a new edition, with an introduction by Harvard professor Neil Levine, was published in 2008. In a contemporary review of the first edition of Wright's lectures, the critic [[Catherine Bauer]] described the book as "the very best book on modern architecture that exists".&lt;ref&gt;Levine, p. ix, citing Catherine Bauer, "The 'Exuberant and Romantic' Genius of Frank Lloyd Wright", review of ''Modern Architecture: Being the Kahn Lectures for 1930,'' by Frank Lloyd Wright, in ''New Republic'' 67 (8 July 1931), p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next two series of lectures in the series were held in January 1931 by Herbert Joseph Spinden, the expert in pre-Columbian American archaeology who had already been considered twice before, and in the fall of 1931 by [[Edward Denison Ross]], director of (what was still known as) the [[School of Oriental and African Studies|School of Oriental Studies]] of the [[University of London]], who talked about Persian art. Neither of these were published. Ross's lectures were described by Baldwin Smith as "rather flat, as the Englishman thought he could chat along pleasantly on most anything to an American audience."&lt;ref&gt;Levine, p. xxii, citing a letter from Smith to F. L. Wright dated 4 January 1931 [which should be 1932, according to Levine] in the archives of The Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; For the fifth round of lectures, the Department invited the French architectural historian [[Marcel Aubert]], but he had to cancel after a scheduling conflict appeared with his lectures at Yale. Morey suggested to Kahn that the remaining funds be given to a student in need.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, p. xxii, citing a letter from Morey to Kahn of 21 April 1932, Princeton University Library&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the financial losses Kahn had sustained during the preceding years, he could not renew his gift.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, p. xxii.&lt;/ref&gt; Otto Kahn died two years later.

'''La Leche League International''' ('''LLLI''') (''La Leche'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "the milk") is a non-governmental, nonprofit organization that organizes advocacy, educational, and training related to [[breastfeeding]]. It is present in about [https://www.llli.org/get-help/ 89 countries].&lt;ref name="DePaul" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bazelon, Emily.

Retrieved September 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The organization was founded in 1956 (OCt 17) by [[Marian Tompson]], Mary White, Mary Ann Cahill, Edwina Froehlich, [[Mary Ann Kerwin]], Viola Lennon, and [[Betty Wagner Spandikow|Betty Wagner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.llli.org/docs/founders_bio1.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705205541/https://www.llli.org/docs/founders_bio1.pdf |archivedate=July 5, 2009 |title=Founders' Bios |accessdate=September 22, 2008 |format=PDF |work=LLLI.org |publisher=La Leche League International |date=February 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, other professionals joined and supported the group - [[Herbert Ratner]] and Gregory White.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lalecheleague.org/cbi/cbi.html | archive-url = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20011216210859/http://www.lalecheleague.org/cbi/cbi.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = December 16, 2001 | title = Happy mothers, breastfed babies: La Leche League International 2005 Annual Report | publisher = La Leche League International | accessdate = May 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Medicine: An Interview by Donald McDonald with Herbert Ratner, M.D.'' One of a Series of Interviews on the American Character. Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions. Comment by Scott Buchanan. Santa Barbara, California: [[Fund for the Republic]], May 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert Ratner was influential in expanding the organization's philosophy beyond breastfeeding. At the time, most women bottle-fed their babies.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Ember |first=Carol |author2=Melvin Ember |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of medical anthropology: Health and Illness in the World's Cultures |title=Breast-feeding practices in the west |year=2003 |publisher=Springer |isbn= 9780306477546 |pages=234 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the organization was founded, only 20% of babies were breastfeeding in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.llli.org/about/history/ |title=A Brief History of La Leche League International |accessdate=March 7, 2018 |work=LLLI.org |publisher=La Leche League International |date=July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first formal La Leche League meeting was held in October 1956.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt; The seven Leaders originally held meetings in private homes; more recently, hospitals, parenting centers, and other public venues have provided meeting spaces. In 1957, Dr. [[Grantly Dick-Read]], considered the father of the natural childbirth movement, also came to speak with them.&lt;ref name="nysun"&gt;{{cite journal

|accessdate=October 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first La Leche League Group outside of the United States formed in 1960 in [[Jonquiere, Quebec]], Canada. The La Leche League became La Leche League International, Inc. (LLLI) in 1964 with groups in Canada, Mexico and New Zealand. In 1964 the first international conference was held in Chicago with 425 adults and 100 babies in attendance.

In 1981 LLLI was granted consultative status with the [[UNICEF|United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF).&lt;ref name="nysun" /&gt; In 1985 LLLI served on the International Board of [[Lactation consultant|Lactation Consultant]] Examiners, established to develop and administer a voluntary certification program for lactation consultants. The first IBLCE exam was administered in July 1985.  The name "La Leche" comes from the Spanish word ''leche'' [pronounced leh-cheh] meaning ''milk''. It was inspired by a shrine in St. Augustine, Florida, dedicated to "Nuestra Señora de la Leche y Buen Parto", meaning "Our Lady of Happy Delivery and Plentiful Milk".&lt;ref name="nysun" /&gt;

Group meetings were held by a Leader, someone approved by LLLI to run the meetings and moderate the discussion that would take place. LLLI grew from a local, to a national, and then an international organization that has been helping thousands of mothers and babies all over the world for more than 60 years.

==Philosophy and mission==
The mission of LLLI is "to help mothers worldwide to breastfeed through mother-to-mother support, encouragement, information, and education, and to promote a better understanding of breastfeeding as an important element in the healthy development of the baby and [[mother]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.llli.org/mission.html?m=1,0,2 |title=La Leche League Mission |accessdate=September 22, 2008 |work=LLLI.org |publisher=La Leche League International |date=July 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="crin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crin.org/Organisations/viewOrg.asp?ID=626 |title=Child Rights Information Network |accessdate=October 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are statements of LLLI's [[philosophy]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.llli.org/about/philosophy/|title=La Leche League Philosophy|last=|first=|date=July 19, 2006|work=LLLI.org|publisher=La Leche League International|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=September 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mothering through breastfeeding is the most natural and effective way of understanding and satisfying the needs of the [[baby]].
* Mother and baby need to be together early and often to establish a satisfying [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] and an adequate milk supply.
* In the early years the baby has an intense need to be with his mother, which is as basic as its need for food.
* [[Human milk]] is the natural food for babies, uniquely meeting their changing needs. 
* For the healthy, full-term baby, breast milk is the only food necessary until the baby shows signs of needing [[Baby food|solids]], about the middle of the first year after birth.
* Ideally the breastfeeding relationship will continue until the baby outgrows the need.
* Alert and active participation by the mother in [[childbirth]] is a help in getting breastfeeding off to a good start.
* Breastfeeding is enhanced and the nursing couple sustained by the loving support, help, and companionship of the baby's [[father]]. A father's unique relationship with his baby is an important element in the child's development from early infancy.
* Good [[nutrition]] means eating a well-balanced and varied diet of foods in as close to their natural state as possible.
* From infancy on, children need loving guidance which reflects acceptance of their capabilities and sensitivity to their feelings.

== Services ==
The primary purpose of LLLI is to encourage, inform, and support mothers primarily via meetings, telephone help, skype, Facebook, W app, helpforms and e-mail. Some Leaders also do home and/or hospital visits.  LLLI leaders are accredited volunteers who have breastfed their own babies and have been specially trained to help mothers with breastfeeding. Leaders keep up-to-date through continued training and study of the most current medical research on breastfeeding.

Leaders organize group meetings, where mothers are encouraged to share their own experiences with other mothers. A common theme repeated by Leaders at a LLLI meeting is "take what you like and leave the rest," acknowledging that every mother-baby dyad is unique and each mother knows her own baby best.  In most countries with a LLL-presence, Leaders also offer telephone help, online meetings, Facebook groups, email help and several types of personal help.

In some locales, there is a centralized phone number (for an entire country or a US state, for example) where mothers can either receive help directly or be referred to a Leader in her area. In other areas, these Leaders directly publicize their telephone numbers, and sometimes e-mail addresses, via the LLLI website, FB groups, telephone directories, and posters in parenting centres, libraries, physicians' and midwives' offices, health centres and other places where pregnant women and new parents might seek information. Mothers may also submit questions or concerns through online Help Forms available on the LLLI website.&lt;ref name="nursingmother"&gt;{{cite book |title=Nursing Mother, Working Mother: The Essential Guide to Nursing Your Baby Before and After You Return to Work |last=Pryor |first=Gale |author2=Kathleen Huggins |year=2007 |publisher=Harvard Common Press |isbn= 9781558323315 |pages=40, 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last LLLI International Conference took place July 2007 in Chicago, and included a seminar for health care professionals. Currently emphasis is on Area parenting and nursing conferences, held in many parts of the world every year. Some Areas offer continuing education seminars for health care professionals in addition to ongoing training for Leaders.

Currently LLLI publishes a bimonthly nursing and parenting journal, ''Breastfeeding Today'', available online and by link to members worldwide. LLLI's core publications are ''The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding'' (now in its 8th edition), "Feed Yourself Feed Your Family" and "Sweet Sleep".

===Great Britain===

La Leche League came to Great Britain in the early 1970s. The first group in GB was started in Leicester in 1973 by an American Leader, Anne Harrison, who was living in Britain. Toward the end of the 1970s, it was suggested that LLLGB become an autonomous organization. It would remain affiliated to LLLI and would be identical or very similar in structure with the same commitments to the same mothering philosophy. The philosophy would remain intact, along with the structure of meetings, and Leader support.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lalecheleague.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1980 discussions continued and a meeting in April decided that La Leche League could best meet the needs of mothers and babies in Britain as a fully autonomous organisation with a democratically elected Board of Directors, ideally affiliated with LLLI. There were approximately 70 Leaders at this time and this was the majority view with a minority feeling few changes were necessary.

Some Leaders had gone ahead with a decision to set up a separate organisation and on July 2, 1980 the inaugural meeting was held of the Association of Nursing Mothers which then formed a break-away group.

==Criticism==
The [[Weston A. Price Foundation]] has criticized [http://www.llli.org/theWomanlyArtofBreastfeeding/ ''The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding''], published by LLLI, as providing nutritional guidance that may undermine the potential of human milk composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westonaprice.org/bookreviews/laleche.html |publisher=[[The Weston A.

(ed) (2004) Breastfeeding... naturally (2nd ed) Australian Breastfeeding Association, Victoria&lt;/ref&gt; The book has also been reviewed as easy to read, comprehensive, and reliable, and unapologetically supportive of the biological norm of the nursing relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.storknet.com/bookshelf/waob.htm | accessdate = June 2, 2008 | publisher = storknet.com | last = Harkavy | first = Susan | title = Book review: ''The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding'' by La Leche League International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 La Leche League Ukraine appealed to La Leche League International to address the issue of a language based discrimination attack on Ukrainian leaders. LLLI supported the Russian attackers, failed to recognize the problem or address the root causes on the issue, thus leading to the demise of La Leche League Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mamochek.net/this-is-what-neocolonial-disrespect-looks-like/|title=This is what neocolonial disrespect looks like.

'''Lilli Lehmann''', born '''Elisabeth Maria Lehmann''', later Elisabeth Maria Lehmann-Kalisch (24 November 1848 – 17 May 1929) was a [[Germany|German]] [[opera]]tic [[soprano]] of phenomenal versatility. She was also a [[voice teacher]].

==Biography==
The future opera star's father, Karl-August Lehmann, was a singer ([[Heldentenor]]) while her mother, Maria Theresia Löw (1809–1885), was a soprano.  Her younger sister, [[Marie Lehmann (soprano)|Marie]], also went on to become an operatic soprano.&lt;ref name="Lehmann 1914" /&gt; Her first lessons were from her mother, who had been a [[prima donna]] under [[Louis Spohr|Spohr]] at the [[Kassel|Cassel]] opera. After singing small parts on the stage, for example in [[Mozart]]'s ''[[Magic Flute]]'' at [[Prague]] in 1866, and studies under [[Heinrich Laube]] in [[Leipzig]],&lt;ref name=acab&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Lehmann, Lilli|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lehmann made her proper debut in 1870 in [[Berlin]] as a light soprano in [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]]'s ''Das Feldlager in Schlesien''. She subsequently became so successful that she was appointed an [[Chamber Singer|Imperial Chamber Singer]] for life in 1876.

Lehmann sang in the first [[Bayreuth Festival]] in 1876, singing in the first complete performances of [[The Ring Cycle]] as Woglinde and Helmwige. She performed in [[London]] in 1884, and appeared at the [[Metropolitan Opera|New York Metropolitan Opera]] in 1885–1899. Together with her Met colleagues  [[Emil Fischer (basso)|Fischer]], [[Max Alvary|Alvary]], [[Marianne Brandt (contralto)|Brandt]], and [[Anton Seidl|Seidl]], she helped to popularise [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s music in America. By remaining in America beyond the leave granted her by the Berlin Opera, she faced a ban following her return to Germany. After the personal intervention of the [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Emperor]], the ban was lifted.

She appeared at London's [[Royal Opera House]], [[Covent Garden]], in 1899 and sang in Paris and Vienna in 1903 and 1909 respectively. In 1905, she sang at the [[Salzburg Festival]], later becoming the festival's artistic director. Lehmann was also renowned as a [[Lieder]] singer. She continued to give recitals until her retirement from the concert stage in the 1920s.

Her mature voice, of splendid quality and large volume, gained for her the reputation of being not only one of the greatest Wagnerian singers of her day but also an ideal interpreter of [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]]'s [[Norma (opera)|Norma]] and the operatic music of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]. She was considered unsurpassed in the roles of Brünnhilde and Isolde but sang an astonishingly wide array of other parts. Indeed, across the span of her career, she performed 170 different parts in a total of 119 German, Italian and French operas. She was noted not only for her rendering of the musical score, but also as a tragic actress.&lt;ref name=acab/&gt; She was also a noted voice teacher. Among her pupils were the famous sopranos [[Geraldine Farrar]], [[Viorica Ursuleac]], [[Edytha Fleischer]], [[Olive Fremstad]] and the mezzo-sopranos [[Lula Mysz-Gmeiner]] and [[Marion Telva]]. Longtime [[Juilliard School]] professor of voice [[Lucia Dunham]], who trained many other famous singers, was also one of her pupils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1959/04/03/82714582.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=LedeAsset&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=27|title=Mrs. Lucia Dunham, Juilliard Teacher|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 3, 1959|page=27|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite work|title=Obituary: Lucia Dunham|work=The Juilliard Review|volume=6|number=2|date=Spring 1959|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888, she married the tenor [[Paul Kalisch]].  
[[Image:Lilli Lehmann, von J. C. Schaarwächter.jpg|thumb|Portrait with signature, 1903]]
Lehmann founded the International Summer Academy at the [[Mozarteum University of Salzburg|Mozarteum]] in Salzburg in 1916. The academy's curriculum concentrated on voice lessons at first but it was extended later to include a wide variety of musical instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moz.ac.at/english/soak/history.shtml |title=International Summer Academy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702015801/http://www.moz.ac.at/english/soak/history.shtml |archivedate=2008-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lilli Lehmann Medal]] is awarded by the Mozarteum in her honour. Her voice can be heard on CD reissues of the recordings which she made prior to [[World War I]]. Although past her peak as an operatic singer when she made these records, they still impress.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33143">'''M-learning''' or '''mobile learning''' is defined as education or training through the use of portable wireless devices such as mobile phones, personal digital assistants (pads), personal computers and small tablet PCs, to achieve the goal of mobility and interactivity. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bukharaev|first=Nail|last2=Wisam Altaher|first2=Ammar|date=2017|title=Mobile Learning Education has Become More Accessible|url=http://www.imedpub.com/articles/mobile-learning-education-has-become-more-accessible.php?aid=21566|journal=American Journal of Computer Science and Information Technology|language=en|volume=05|issue=02|doi=10.21767/2349-3917.100005|issn=2349-3917}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

M-learning technologies include handheld computers, [[MP3 player]]s, notebooks, mobile phones and tablets. M-learning focuses on the mobility of the learner, interacting with portable technologies. Using mobile tools for creating learning aids and materials becomes an important part of [[informal learning]].&lt;ref&gt;Trentin G. &amp; Repetto M. (Eds) (2013). [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235929936_Using_Network_and_Mobile_Technology_to_Bridge_Formal_and_Informal_Learning/ ''Using Network and Mobile Technology to Bridge Formal and Informal Learning''], Woodhead/Chandos Publishing Limited, Cambridge, UK, {{ISBN|978-1-84334-699-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

M-learning is convenient in that it is accessible from virtually anywhere. Sharing is almost instantaneous among everyone using the same content, which leads to the reception of instant feedback and tips. This highly active process has proven to increase exam scores from the fiftieth to the seventieth percentile, and cut the dropout rate in technical fields by 22 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Mobile Wave: How Mobile Intelligence Will Change Everything |last=Saylor |first=Michael |year=2012 |publisher=Perseus Books/Vanguard Press |isbn=978-1593157203 |page=176 }}&lt;/ref&gt; M-learning also brings strong portability by replacing [[book]]s and notes with small devices, filled with tailored learning contents. M-learning has the added benefit of being cost effective, as the price of digital content on tablets is falling sharply compared to the traditional media (books, CD and DVD, etc.). One digital textbook, for instance, costs one-third to half the price of a paper textbook (AFD, 2012), with zero marginal cost.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; 

Some of the possibilities offered by this methodology, according to Fombona, Pascual-Sevillana and González-Videgaray, are a greater and different access to information, along with transcendent innovations, such as the increase of informal and playful activities, iconic virtual, membership of specific groups, and networks of friendly interaction within new scales of values.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fombona|first=Javier|last2=Pascual-Sevillana|first2=Ángeles|last3=González-Videgaray|first3=MariCarmen|date=2017|title=M-learning and Augmented Reality: A Review of the Scientific Literature on the WoS Repository|url=https://doi.org/10.3916/C52-2017-06|journal=Comunicar|language=es|volume=25|issue=52|pages=63–72|doi=10.3916/c52-2017-06|issn=1134-3478}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
Mobile learning is the delivery of learning, education or learning support on mobile phones, PDAs or tablets.&lt;ref name="educause.edu"&gt;Oller, Rick. [http://www.educause.edu/ecar ''The Future of Mobile Learning'' (research bulletin).] Louisville, CO: EDUCAUSE Center for Analysis and Research, May 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

New mobile technology, such as hand-held based devices, is playing a large role in redefining how people receive information.   "Numerous agencies including the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD), [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS), Intelligence community, and law enforcement are utilizing mobile technology for information management."&lt;ref&gt;Hosmer, Chet; Carlton Jeffcoat, Matthew Davis, Thomas McGibbon [http://www.thedacs.com/techs/abstract/518055 ''Use of Mobile Technology for Information Collection and Dissemination''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111004901/http://www.thedacs.com/techs/abstract/518055 |date=2012-01-11 }} Data &amp; Analysis Center for Software, March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History of M-learning ===
Concepts of m-learning was given by Alan Kay in 1970's. He joined Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research Center and formed a group to develop "Dynabook", which is a portable and hands on personal computer. It aimed to let children have access to the digital world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tracing the Dynabook: A Study of Technocultural Transformations|last=Maxwell|first=John|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;This project failed eventually due to the lack of technological support at that time. Until 1994, first smart phone, [[IBM Simon]], was created by Mitsubishi Electric Corp. It was defined as a handheld personal communicator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Abacus to Smartphone: The evolution of mobile and portable computing|last=Koblentz|first=Evan}}&lt;/ref&gt;From then on, technological companies started to design the so-called "smartphones". The creation of smartphone provided the platform for mobile-learning, and current of mobile device innovation pushed mobile learning to project and research status.

Chronologically, m-learning research has been characterized into three phases: first phase is the focus upon devices; second is the focus on learning outside the classroom; third phase is the focus on the mobility of the learner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Summary and Critique of M-Learning Research and Practice|last=Cochrane|first=Thomas|year=2013|isbn=9780415503693}}&lt;/ref&gt;At its second phase, around year of 2005, tremendous amount of projects has been done, four major projects are "The Leonardo da Vinci project From e-learning to m-learning led by Ericsson Education Dublin", "The Leonardo da Vinci project Mobile learning: the next generation of learning led by Ericsson Education Dublin", "The IST project M-Learning led by the United Kingdom government Learning and Skills Development Agency (LSDA)" and "The IST project MOBILearn led by Giunti Ricerca of Genoa, Italy". These projects are mainly targeted on the effects of m-learning, like motivation to learn, engagement in learning activities and focus on special needs people&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|last=Swan|first=Karen|title=Teaching and Learning with Mobile Computing Devices: Closing the Gap|year=2005|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.508.5837}}&lt;/ref&gt;; they set the tone for mobile learning, m-learning is prepared to transfer from project status to mainstream education and training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=THE INCORPORATION OF MOBILE LEARNING INTO MAINSTREAM EDUCATION AND TRAINING|last=Keegan|first=Desmond|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And M-learning research is globalized now: Africa , Asia, North America, Europe, Scandinavia, Australia and New Zealand all have remarkable achievement on this field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Summary and Critique of M-Learning Research and Practice|last=Cochrane|first=Thomas|year=2013|isbn=9780415503693}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches==
[[Image:Military Mobile Learning.jpg|thumb|150px|The use of mobile learning in the military is becoming increasingly common due to low cost and high portability.]]

===Classroom===
[[File:Group Collaboration.png|thumb|Parts of Group Collaboration]]
Applications in [[classroom]]s and other [[learning space]]s combine the use of [[umpc|handheld computers]], [[PDA]]s, [[smartphone]]s or handheld voting systems (such as [[Clicker (classroom)|clickers]]) with traditional resources {{Harv|Tremblay|2010}}.
; Class management:

Mobile devices in brick-and-mortar classrooms can be used to enhance [[student-centered learning]], group [[collaboration]] among students through communication applications, interactive displays, and video features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murray|first=Orrin|author2=Nicole Olcese|title=Teaching and Learning with iPads, Ready or Not?|journal=TechTrends|date=November–December 2011|volume=55|issue=6|doi=10.1007/s11528-011-0540-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Existing mobile technology can replace cumbersome resources such as textbooks, visual aids, and presentation technology.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|title=7 THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT MOBILE APPS FOR LEARNING|journal=EDUCAUSE Learning Initiative|date=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Interactive and multi-mode technology allows students to engage and manipulate information.
*Mobile Device features with WIFI capabilities allow for on-demand access to information.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
*Access to classroom activities and information on mobile devices provides a continuum for learning inside and outside the classroom.&lt;ref name="Naismith 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Naismith|first=Laura|author2=Lonsdale, Peter  |author3=Vavoula, Giasemi  |author4=Sharples, Mike  |title=Literature Review in Mobile Technologies and Learning|journal=FutureLab Series|year=2004|issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a literature review conducted by FutureLab, researchers found that increased communication, collaboration, and understanding of concepts was a result of mobile technology applications.&lt;ref name="Naismith 2004"/&gt;

; Distance Learning:
{{See also|Distance Education}}
Mobile devices can be used in online settings to enhance learning experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, R. &amp; Reinhart, J. (2014). [http://bookboon.com/en/digital-thinking-and-mobile-teaching-ebook Digital Thinking and Mobile Teaching: Communicating, Collaborating, and Constructing in an Access Age]. Denmark: Bookboon.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The mobile phone (through text [[SMS]] notices) can be used especially for distance education or with students whose courses require them to be highly mobile and in particular to communicate information regarding availability of assignment results, venue changes and cancellations, etc. 
*Mobile devices facilitate online interaction between teacher and student, and student to student. Mobile devices make it possible to facilitate interaction in real time, allowing students to obtain immediate feedback. Educators can also assess student comprehension by using mobile devices, which provide real time updates on student progress, enabling teachers to adapt and personalize their teaching.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;
*It can also be of value to business people, e.g. [[sales representatives]] who do not wish to waste time away from their busy schedules to attend formal training events.

; Podcasting:
{{See also|Podcast}}
[[Podcasting]] consists of listening to audio recordings of lectures. It can be used to review live lectures {{Harv|Clark|Westcott|2007}} and to provide opportunities for students to rehearse oral presentations.
Podcasts may also provide supplemental information to enhance traditional lectures {{Harv|McGarr|2009}} {{Harv|Steven|Teasley|2009}}.

Psychological research suggests that university students who download podcast lectures achieve substantially higher exam results than those who attend the lecture in person (only in cases in which students [[Notetaking|take notes]]) {{Harv|Callaway|Ewen|2009}}.

Podcasts may be delivered using [[broadcast syndication|syndication]], although this method of delivery is not always easily adopted {{Harv|Lee|Miller|Newnham|2009}}.

===Work===
M-learning in the context of work can embrace a variety of different forms of learning. It has been defined as the "processes of coming to know, and of being able to operate successfully in, and across, new and ever changing contexts, including learning for, at and through work, by means of mobile devices".&lt;ref name="Pachler, N. 2011"&gt;Pachler, N., Pimmer, C., &amp; Seipold, J. (Eds.). (2011). ''Work-Based Mobile Learning. Concepts and Cases''. Oxford, Bern, Berlin, Bruxelles, Frankfurt am Main, New York, Wien: Peter-Lang, drawing on Pachler, N., Bachmair, B., &amp; Cook, J. (2010). ''Mobile Learning: Structures, Agency, Practices'' (Vol. 1). New York, Dordrecht, Heidelberg, London: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

*M-learning for work
*M-learning at and through work
*Cross-contextual m-learning

'''Learning for work''', which could be also described as 'just-in-case' learning, involves classic and formal education activities, such as training courses, that prepare learners for future work-related tasks. A typical, corporate application is the delivery of mobile compliance training, which can be seen as a viable means to reach geographically mobile employees, such as consultants&lt;ref&gt;Swanson, K. (2008). "Merrill Lynch: Bullish on Mobile Learning (case study)". ''Chief Learning Officer''. Retrieved from http://clomedia.com/articles/view/merrill_lynch_bullish_on_mobile_learning{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; or staff in logistic and transport systems.&lt;ref&gt;Stead, G., &amp; Good, M. (2011). "Mobile learning in vocational settings: lessons from the E-Ten BLOOM project". In N. Pachler, C. Pimmer, &amp; J. Seipold (Eds.), ''Work-based mobile learning: concepts and cases''. Oxford, Bern, Berlin, Bruxelles, Frankfurt am Main, New York, Wien: Peter-Lang&lt;/ref&gt; Another application is mobile simulations that prepare learners for future situations, for example real-time SMS-based simulations for disaster response training.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius, S., &amp; Marston, P. (2011). "Work-based simulations: using text messaging and the role of the virtual context". In N. Pachler, C. Pimmer, &amp; J. Seipold (Eds.), ''Work-based mobile learning: concepts and cases''. Oxford, Bern, Berlin, Bruxelles, Frankfurt am Main, New York, Wien: Peter-Lang&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Learning at and through work''', which could be labelled as "just-in-time" mobile learning,&lt;ref&gt;Pimmer, C., &amp; Gröhbiel, U. (2008). ''Mobile Learning in corporate settings. Results from an Expert Survey''. Paper presented at the mLearn2008. The Bridge From Text To Context, Telford.&lt;/ref&gt; occurs in informal education settings at the workplace. Employees can use the mobile phone to solve problems via handheld devices in situ, for example by accessing informational resources (such as checklists and reference guides) prior to customer visits&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad, N., &amp; Orion, P. (2010). "Smartphones Make IBM Smarter, But Not As Expected". ''Training &amp; Development'', 64(1), 46-50.&lt;/ref&gt; or mobile decision support systems. The latter are popular in clinical settings where they support highly mobile medical staff through rule-based algorithms in the decision regarding more complex patient cases. Their application was associated with learning and in particular with practice improvement of medical staff.&lt;ref&gt;Grad, R. M., Pluye, P., Meng, Y., Segal, B., &amp; Tamblyn, R. (2005). "Assessing the impact of clinical information retrieval technology in a family practice residency". ''Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice'', 11(6), 576-586.&lt;/ref&gt; Learning through work also occurs by interacting with distant peers via phone. "People tagging" is an approach whereby people assign topics they associate with co-workers. The aggregation of interests and experiences serves not only as a means to raise awareness but also to help find competent experts on demand,&lt;ref&gt;Cook, J. &amp; Pachler, N. (2012). "Online people tagging: Social (mobile) network (ing) services and work‐based learning". ''British Journal of Educational Technology'', 43(5), 711-725&lt;/ref&gt; for example with context-sensitive expert location systems.

'''Cross-contextual learning''' that bridges the gap between work settings and formal education formats has perhaps the biggest potential for work-based mobile learning,&lt;ref name="Pachler, N. 2011"/&gt; especially with respect to tertiary education systems. This involves approaches in which learning in the workplace is facilitated and substantiated (for example through formative assessments,&lt;ref&gt;Coulby, C., Hennessey, S., Davies, N. &amp; Fuller, R. (2009). "The use of mobile technology for work-based assessment: the student experience". ''British Journal of Educational Technology'', 42, 251-265.&lt;/ref&gt; reflective questions&lt;ref&gt;Pirttiaho, P., Holm, J.-M., Paalanen, H., &amp; Thorström, T. (2007). Etaitava - Mobile Tool for On-the-Job Learning Paper presented at the Iadis, International Conference Mobile Learning, Lisbon, Portugal&lt;/ref&gt; or the documentation of personal achievements in multimedia learning diaries or portfolios&lt;ref&gt;Chan, S. (2011). "Becoming a baker: using mobile phones to compile e-portfolios". In N. Pachler, C. Pimmer &amp; J. Seipold (Eds.), ''Work-based mobile learning:Concepts and cases'' (pp. 91-117). Oxford, Bern, Berlin, Bruxelles, Frankfurt am Main, New York, Wien: Peter-Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;) The so-created materials are later used in more formal educational formats, for example in the classroom or in the discussion with tutors. The value of these mobile phone-mediated learning practices lies in the integration and reconciliation of work-based learning and formal education experiences which otherwise tend to remain separated.

===Lifelong learning and self-learning===
Mobile technologies and approaches, i.e. [[mobile-assisted language learning]] (MALL), are also used to assist in [[language learning]]. For instance handheld computers, cell phones, and [[podcasting]] {{Harv|Horkoff|Kayes2008}} have been used to help people acquire and develop language skills.

===Other===
* Improving levels of literacy, numeracy, and participation in education amongst young adults.
* Using the communication features of a mobile phone as part of a larger learning activity, e.g.: sending media or texts into a central portfolio, or exporting audio files from a learning platform to your phone.
* Developing workforce skills and readiness among youth and young adults.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/feb/26/mobile-education-mobile-phones |title= Youth Unemployment: Can Mobile Technology Improve Employability? |newspaper= The Guardian |date=February 26, 2013 |accessdate=August 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Around the world ==
=== Pakistan ===
In Pakistan, the Rehan School was one of the first initiatives to offer remote courses that could be accessed from a basic mobile phone. The application offers short educational sequences, showing how to write common names and words and conveying mathematical and scientific concepts. Sometimes featuring television personalities, the teaching sketches are intended for viewing on small telephone screens. The films are sold for a few cents in the telecoms boutiques and can then be exchanged by Bluetooth. The Rehan School estimates that over 40,000 individuals follow its lessons, but the real number is certainly higher.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Agence Française de Développement, Agence universitaire de la Francophonie, Orange, &amp; UNESCO. (2015). [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002318/231867e.pdf Digital Services for Education in Africa]. ''Savoirs communs, 17.''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Papua New Guinea ===
In Papua New Guinea, the SMS Story project has improved teachers' classroom practices in teaching children to read by using short messages and sent by SMS.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Sub-Saharan Africa ===
Since the 1960s, various information and communication technologies have aroused strong interest in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] as a way of increasing access to education, and enhancing its quality and fairness. In Sub-Saharan Africa, teachers and students are faced with an extreme shortage of teaching materials. The number of textbooks available are limited, so few students have individual access to textbooks in class or at home. Given the shortage of textbooks in many African schools, tablets and mobile phones are being viewed by governments and international organizations as a solution to provide access to learning materials. In one example, the Tangerine mobile assessment and coaching system, deployed in Kenya, aims to help teachers in their assessment activities. With Tangerine, a student's reading level can be evaluated by recording the student's answers on a mobile phone or a tablet. The data gathered by the application also allows comparisons of the learning levels of students according to their age, geographical area and gender.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==Analysis==

===Value===
;The value of mobile learning&lt;ref&gt;''Mobile learning in Practice: Piloting a Mobile Learning Teachers’ Toolkit in Further Education Colleges''. C. Savil-Smith ''et al.'' (2006), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;
Tutors who have used m-learning programs and techniques have made the following value statements in favor of m-learning.

*It is important to bring new technology into the classroom.
*Devices used are more lightweight than books and PCs. 
*Mobile learning can be used to diversify the types of learning activities students partake in (or a blended learning approach).
*Mobile learning supports the learning process rather than being integral to it.
*Mobile learning can be a useful add-on tool for students with special needs. However, for SMS and MMS this might be dependent on the students’ specific disabilities or difficulties involved.
*Mobile learning can be used as a ‘hook’ to re-engage disaffected youth.
*M-Learning can be designed to combine decision making in complex learning scenarios with formative scoring and assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.iadisportal.org/digital-library/a-holistic-approach-to-scoring-in-complex-mobile-learning-scenarios#|title=MCCSIS 2016 |chapter=A Holistic Approach to Scoring in Complex Mobile Learning Scenarios |last=Gebbe |first=Marcel |last2=Teine |first2=Matthias |last3=Beutner |first3=Marc |date=2016 |publisher=IADIS Press |editor=Miguel Baptista Nunes |editor2=Maggie McPherson |isbn=9789898533517 |location=Madeira |pages=19-27 |oclc=958149790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mark D. Pesce''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɛ|ʃ|i}} {{respell|PESH|ee}}; born 1962) is an [[American Australians|American-Australian]] author, researcher, engineer, [[futurist]] and teacher.

== Early life ==
Pesce was born in Everett, Massachusetts in 1962. In September 1980, Pesce attended [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) for a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree, but left in June 1982 to pursue opportunities in the newly emerging [[High technology|high-tech]] industry. He worked as an engineer for the next few years, developing prototype firmware and software for [[SecurID]] cards.

==Career==
In 1988, Pesce joined [[Shiva Corporation]], which pioneered and popularized [[dial-up networking]]. Pesce's role in the company was to develop user interfaces, and his research extended into virtual reality.&lt;ref name=Vitae&gt;{{cite web|last=Pesce|first=Mark|title=Curriculum Vitae|url=http://hyperreal.org/~mpesce/|work=hyperreal.org|publisher=Mark Pesce|accessdate=19 August 2011|format =PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Pesce founded the Ono-Sendai Corporation, named after a fictitious company in the [[William Gibson]] novel ''[[Neuromancer]]''. Ono-Sendai was a first-generation [[virtual reality]] startup, chartered to create inexpensive, home-based networked VR systems. The company developed a key technology, which earned Pesce his first [[patent]] for a "Sourceless Orientation Sensor" that tracks the motion of persons in virtual environments. Sega Corporation of America would use the technology on the design of the [[Sega VR]], a consumer head-mounted display (HMD).&lt;ref name=Vitae /&gt;

In 1993, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] hired Pesce as a consulting engineer to develop interfaces between Apple and [[IBM]] networking products.&lt;ref name=NYtimes2&gt;{{cite news|last=MARKOFF|first=JOHN|title=A New Language Is Adding Depth to the Flat Computer Screen|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/25/business/a-new-language-is-adding-depth-to-the-flat-computer-screen.html?pagewanted=2&amp;src=pm|accessdate=20 August 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 25, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In early 1994, while in [[San Francisco]], Pesce, with software engineers Tony Parisi and Gavin Bell, spearheaded an effort to standardize 3D on the Web, and formed [[VRML]] Architecture Group (VAG), under the leadership of Pesce.&lt;ref name=NYtimes96&gt;{{cite news|last=MARKOFF|first=JOHN|title=Tomorrow, the World Wide Web!;Microsoft, the PC King, Wants to Reign Over the Internet|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/16/business/tomorrow-world-wide-web-microsoft-pc-king-wants-reign-over-internet.html?scp=9&amp;sq=Mark%20Pesce&amp;st=nyt&amp;pagewanted=2|accessdate=20 August 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 16, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The purpose of VRML was to allow for the creation of 3D environments within the [[World Wide Web]], accessible through a [[web browser]]. Working in conjunction with such corporations as [[Microsoft]], [[Netscape]], [[Silicon Graphics]], [[Sun Microsystems]] and [[Sony]], Pesce convinced the industry to accept the new protocol as a standard for desktop virtual reality.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} This development spring-boarded Pesce into a career which has included extensive writings for both the popular and scientific press, teaching and lecturing at universities, conferences, performances, presentations, and films appearances.

==Australia==
In 2003, Pesce relocated to Australia, where he continues to live, and became an Australian citizen on 4 February 2011.&lt;ref name=Aussie&gt;{{cite web|last=Pesce|first=Mark|title=Mateship and becoming Aussie|url=http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/43650.html|work=ABC.net.au|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an Honorary Lecturer at the [[University of Sydney]] and is a judge on ''[[The New Inventors]]'', a nationally televised program in Australia.

In 2006, Pesce founded FutureSt, a [[Sydney]] consultancy, serving as an advisory to analytic's firm [http://www.peoplebrowsr.com/ PeopleBrowsr], and [http://www.servalproject.org/ The Serval Project].&lt;ref name=BioMarkPesceCom&gt;{{cite web|title=Creativity {{!}} Insight {{!}} Inspiration |url=http://markpesce.com/about/|work=markpesce.com|accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Pesce began writing an online column for the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s ''The Drum Opinion''.&lt;ref name=ABCstories&gt;{{cite web|title=Mark Pesce - The Drum Opinion|url=http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/mark-pesce-28684.html|publisher=ABC.net.au|accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently Pesce has been designing and coding Plexus,&lt;ref name=Plexus&gt;{{cite web|last=Bauwens|first=Michel|title=Why we need a wikileaks for social media: Marke Pesce on the launching of the Plexus project|url=http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/why-we-need-a-wikileaks-for-social-media-marke-pesce-on-the-launching-of-the-plexus-project/2010/08/08|work=blog.p2pfoundation.net|publisher=P2P Foundation|accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  a [[Web 2.0]] address book and social networking tool, and is writing his next book, ''The Next Billion Seconds''.&lt;ref name=NextBillion&gt;{{cite web|last=Pesce|first=Mark|title=The Next Billion Seconds|url=http://thenextbillionseconds.com/|accessdate=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His current major project, however, is Light ''MooresCloud'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afr.com/f/free/technology/digitallife/australian_startup_reinvents_the_LrNIW5n4mlxctY0GwOclpM&lt;/ref&gt; an [[ambient device]] of 52-[[LEDs]] which is a lamp with a [[LAMP (software bundle)|LAMP]]-stack;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.engadget.com/2012/10/13/moorescloud-light-runs-linux-puts-lamp-on-your-lamp/&lt;/ref&gt; the trademark pays homage to the inexpensive [[ubiquitous computing]] engendered by [[Moore's Law]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4961">'''Nina Hunt''' (1932&amp;ndash;1995) was a Manx [[Latin dance|Latin American dance]] coach and [[choreographer]]. She had a high reputation for coaching competitive Latin dancers.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Frank and Peggy 1968. ''Come dancing''. Allen, London. p147&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Hunt was born in 1932 on the [[Isle of Man]]. She came to [[England]] to become an actress and found work in a jewellery shop, where she met early Latin American dancer and innovator [[Dimitri Petrides]]. She persuaded him to teach her to dance and quickly became an adept dancer, but went into coaching instead of competing. The couple married, and had a son, Ian. Dimitri died whilst judging at Blackpool in 1985; Nina died from a [[stroke]] 10 years later.

Nina trained many world champions and was known for her choreography. [[Len Goodman]], in his autobiography, gives an amusing account of the relationships between the four leading Latin coaches in the 1960s: Hunt, [[Walter Laird]], Doris Lavelle and Sidney Francis, likening a lesson with Hunt to being sent for a golf session with Tiger Woods.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Len 2008. ''Better late than never''. Ebury, London. p170&lt;/ref&gt; Among those she trained and choreographed were [[Bill and Bobbie Irvine]], whom she coached in their quest for the World Professional Latin Championship, [[Donnie Burns]] – the most successful Latin dancer of all time, Len Goodman, [[Sammy Stopford]] and Barbara McColl, Alan and Hazel Fletcher, Walter and Marianne Kaiser and [[Ian Waite]]. Nina was once asked to choreograph Winter Olympic gold medal winners [[Torvill and Dean]] but turned them down. Nina first served on the Latin American Faculty Committee in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istd.org/latin/facultynews/july08/ninahunt.html Article on Nina Hunt by Hazel Fletcher published by ISTD]&lt;/ref&gt;

An article written by one of Nina's former pupils, five times [[World Latin Dance Champions|World Latin Champion]] Hazel Fletcher, began by saying 
:"Nina Hunt was indisputably the most successful Latin American competitive dance coach of all time. Her record...I am sure, will never be challenged again...Success in dancing is generally calculated by how many Championship titles a dancer has to his or her credit, if it were possible to count the number of couples that Nina trained solely to become top Champions, her record would be so staggering, it is almost unbelievable. She reigned supreme for over three decades."

:"Nina's name became ‘the name’ synonymous with winning...She became a brilliant coach with a great eye for what was successful and how to achieve that in her couples. She was an excellent choreographer and had the ability to poach ‘moves’ from other forms of dance and indoctrinate them into the Latin dances. She was also a great mentor and motivator...Nina decided what competitions her couples should attend; she got involved in their grooming in every detail, their diet was discussed and she even versed her couples on how to walk onto the floor and where to dance. From her tiny studio in Balham she produced so many giants in the competitive world of dance." Hazel Fletcher.&lt;ref&gt;''Dance'' [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing]], edition 444.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Uppsala students arrival at Christiania 1852.png|thumb|Uppsala students arrive in [[Oslo]], 23 June 1852.]]
'''Nordic student meeting''' or '''Scandinavian student meeting''' were a series of gatherings between students at the Scandinavian universities during the 19th century. Students from [[Uppsala University]], [[Lund University]], the [[University of Copenhagen]] and the [[University of Oslo]] took turns in inviting respectively visiting each other's universities. Students from the [[University of Helsinki]] were also invited, but were unable to attend, as the [[Emperor of Russia]] had imposed travel bans upon the Helsinki students.&lt;ref name="Ergo"&gt;Erik &amp; Marta Ronne (8–2005). [http://ergo.ronne.se/E2005N8.html ”Studentmötet 1875”]. ''Ergo''. Retrieved 26 December 2016. ''(Swedish)''&lt;/ref&gt;

The meetings were a part of the [[Scandinavism|scandinavistic movement]] which sought to unify the Scandinavian countries politically and culturally. Scandinavianism originated from the University of Copenhagen and spread to Sweden in 1839 when students from [[Copenhagen]] marched across [[Øresund]] in order to meet the students at [[Lund]]. The first Scandinavian student meeting was held in [[Uppsala]] year 1843. The Nordic [[student cap]] was designed for this occasion, and was adopted as common headgear by all Scandinavian students at the subsequent meeting in Lund and Copenhagen year 1845. In 1851 the students at the university of Oslo invited to a third student meeting. However, the Uppsala students were unable to attend since the semester hadn't stopped. These were instead invited back the following year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/studtog/ Studentertog til Christiania 1851 og 1852] ''(Danish)''&lt;/ref&gt; The final student meeting was held in Uppsala 1875.&lt;ref name="Ergo"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1313">'''''Okwuobi v Lester B Pearson School Board''''', 2005 SCC 16, is a leading [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision on minority language rights. The Court held that parents in Quebec who are denied access to English schools for their children must apply through the Administrative Tribunal of Quebec (ATQ), which holds exclusive jurisdiction to hear appeals regarding minority language rights, and cannot bypass the tribunal by applying to the courts. In examining the intent of the Quebec legislation the Court found that the tribunal also had the power to hear constitutional questions.

This decision was part of a trilogy of cases on minority language rights which included ''[[Solski (Tutor of) v Quebec (AG)]]'', 2005 SCC 14, and ''[[Gosselin (Tutor of) v Quebec (AG)]]'', 2005 SCC 15.

The case was decided with ''Casimir v Quebec (AG)'' and ''Zorilla v Quebec (AG)''.

'''Physlets''' are ''phys''ics app''lets'' that are free for non-commercial use and were created by the same team as the [[Open Source Physics]] Project. Since their creation at [[Davidson College]] in 1998, over 2,000 individual exercises have been created using Physlets for the teaching and learning of astronomy and physics on a variety of levels and a variety of settings. Physlets have also been used in a number of textbooks, and have been translated into a number of languages including: Spanish, Slovenian, German, Hebrew, and Portuguese.

==Recent Developments==
On July 1, 2013, the second, all electronic version of the book, ''Physlets Physics 2E'', was released under a [[Creative Commons]] Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License on the ComPADRE National Science Digital Library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compadre.org/Physlets/ Physlet Physics 2E]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Physlets are small, flexible [[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[applet]]s that can be used in the teaching of [[physics]] and other sciences. In particular:
* Physlets use simple graphics to convey only the salient features of physical phenomena.
* Physlet-based exercises can be used as part of almost any curriculum with almost any teaching style.
* Physlets are created and controlled with [[JavaScript]], meaning that with only 24 Physlets, there can be hundreds of Physlet-based exercises created.
* Physlets are Web based and run on any platform ([[Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], or [[Linux]]).
* Physlets are free for noncommercial use. The Java programs themselves are free and can be downloaded from the ComPADREPhyslet site.

==Requirements==
Physlets were created using the Java programming language, and they are accessed via a web browser as Java applets. [[Java Virtual Machine]]s (JVM) are available for many different platforms; Physlets have been tested and run on the Windows, Macintosh (OSX), and Linux platforms.

As "Physlet" is a registered trademark,&lt;ref&gt;[http://webphysics.davidson.edu/Applets/DownLoad_Files/intro_download.html Physlet site copyright page]&lt;/ref&gt; this word may not be appropriate to name arbitrary Java applet that demonstrates physical laws without approval from the trademark owners.

'''PlanetMath''' is a [[free content|free]], collaborative, online [[mathematics]] [[encyclopedia]].  The emphasis is on rigour, openness, [[pedagogy]], real-time content, interlinked content, and also  [[community]] of about 24,000 people with various maths interests. Intended to be comprehensive, the project is currently hosted by the [[University of Waterloo]]. The site is owned by a US-based nonprofit corporation, "PlanetMath.org, Ltd".&lt;ref&gt;Self-descriptions of PM {{cite web |url=http://planetmath.org/?op%3Dgetobj%26from%3Dcollab%26id%3D35#SECTION00021000000000000000 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826090901/http://planetmath.org/?op=getobj&amp;from=collab&amp;id=35 |archivedate=2016-08-26 |df= }}, {{cite web |url=http://planetmath.org/?op%3Dabout |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611023918/http://planetmath.org/?op=about |archivedate=2016-06-11 |df= }} {{cite web |url=http://aux.planetmath.org/doc/donate.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509123133/http://aux.planetmath.org/doc/donate.html |archivedate=2008-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

PlanetMath was started when the popular free online mathematics encyclopedia [[MathWorld]] was temporarily taken offline for 12 months by a court injunction as a result of the [[CRC Press]] lawsuit against the [[Wolfram Research]] company and its employee (and MathWorld's author) [[Eric Weisstein]].

==Content==

The main PlanetMath focus is on  [[encyclopedia|encyclopedic]] entries.  It formerly operated a self-hosted forum, but now encourages discussion via [[Gitter]].

{{As of|2013|02|15}}, the encyclopedia hosted about 9,289 entries and over 16,258 ''concepts'' (a concept may be for example a specific notion defined within a more general entry).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/|title=PlanetMath Encyclopedia|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215215112/http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/|archivedate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; An overview of the current PlanetMath contents is also available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/OverviewOfTheContentOfPlanetMath.html |title=Overview of the content of PlanetMath |publisher=Planetmath.org |date=2013-03-21 |accessdate=2013-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804090402/http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/OverviewOfTheContentOfPlanetMath.html |archivedate=2012-08-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 300 Wikipedia entries incorporate text from PlanetMath articles; they are listed in [[:Category:Wikipedia articles incorporating text from PlanetMath]].

An all-inclusive PlanetMath ''Free Encyclopedia'' book of 2,300 pages is available for the encyclopedia contents up to 2006 as a free download PDF file.&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetphysics.org/?op=getobj&amp;from=books&amp;id=207 PlanetMath "''Free Encyclopedia''" book] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160620044430/http://planetphysics.org/?op=getobj&amp;from=books&amp;id=207 |date=June 20, 2016 }} based on 2004-2005 content of PlanetMath&lt;/ref&gt;

===Content development model===

PlanetMath implements a specific content creation system called ''authority model''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetmath.org/?op=getobj&amp;from=collab&amp;id=34 Noosphere's] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304034756/http://planetmath.org/?op=getobj&amp;from=collab&amp;id=34 |date=March 4, 2016 }} authority model&lt;/ref&gt; This is a set of rules determining who can add, modify or remove content. Only registered users can create or edit entries.

An author who starts a new article becomes its ''owner'', that is the only person authorized to edit that article.  Other users may add corrections and discuss improvements but the resulting modifications of the article, if any, are always made by the owner.  However, if there are long lasting unresolved corrections, the ownership can be removed. More precisely, after 2 weeks the system starts to remind the owner by mail; at 6 weeks any user can "adopt" the article; at 8 weeks the ownership of the entry is completely removed (and such an entry is called "orphaned").

To make the development more smooth, the owner may also choose to grant editing rights to other individuals or groups.

The user can explicitly create links to other articles, and the system also automatically turns certain words into  links to the defining articles. The topic area of every article is classified by the [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] (MSC) of the [[American Mathematical Society]] (AMS).

The site is supervised by the Content Committee. Its basic mission is to  ''maintain the integrity and quality of the mathematical content and organization of PlanetMath.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Username * |url=http://planetmath.org/?op=getobj&amp;from=collab&amp;id=130 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126222624/http://planetmath.org/?op=getobj&amp;from=collab&amp;id=130 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-11-26 |title=ContentCommittee Charter |publisher=Planetmath.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As defined in its Charter, the tasks of the Committee include:
* Developing/maintaining the standards for PlanetMath content
* Improving individual PlanetMath entries in its Encyclopedia, Book, Paper, and Exposition)
* Developing topic areas
* Developing/improving site and user documentation
* Managing the PlanetMath Request list and Unproved Theorems list
* Improving categorization and other meta-attributes of entries.
* Developing software recommendations for improved content authoring and editorial functions.

===Technical details===
PlanetMath content is licensed under the [[copyleft]] [[Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License]].  
All content is written in [[LaTeX]], a typesetting system popular among [[mathematician]]s because of its support of the technical needs of mathematical typesetting and its high-quality output.

The software running PlanetMath is written in [[Perl]] and runs on [[Linux]] and the web server [[apache server|Apache]]. It is known as ''Noösphere'' and has been released under the free [[BSD License]]. As of March 13, 2013 PlanetMath has retired Noösphere and runs now on a software called ''Planetary'', which itself was implemented with [[Drupal]].

===Related projects===
Encyclopedic content and bibliographic materials related to physics, mathematics and mathematical physics are developed by [[PlanetPhysics]]. The site, launched in 2005, uses similar software (Noosphere), but a significantly different moderation model with emphasis on current research in physics and peer review.&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetphysics.org/ PlanetPhysics.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225121156/http://planetphysics.org/ |date=February 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160620042751/http://planetphysics.org/?op=listobj&amp;from=books Free Book downloads] in PDF format, Original Papers (~10 pages) and Expositions (&gt;30 pages) {{dead link|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a PlanetComputing project is envisaged that would also include [[Computational Physics]] and [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] together with logical, categorical, ontological and mathematical foundations of computers and automata. (Seems to be abandoned plan.)

'''Rate Your Students''' was a [[weblog]] that ran from November 2005 to June 2010. It was started by a "tenured humanities professor from the South," but was run for most of its five years by a rotating group of anonymous academics. The blog has not been updated since Dec 2010.

In an article from the ''[[Arizona State]] Web Devil'', one of many that appeared on the site, the original moderator said that the impulse to start the blog was:
{{quote|...to poke fun at [[RateMyProfessors.com]], a mostly unmonitored and disingenuous site that traffics mostly in character assassination. Often I've heard people raise the notion of, 'What if there was a Rate My Students? Wouldn't people be horrified to find out how awful some students can be?' And I thought I'd do it as a lark. I suspected it'd be fun for a couple of weeks and then I'd ditch it. But the response was great, and very quickly the e-mail I was getting was about other things: how to make classrooms work better, what students need to succeed, what professors need to know about the modern student. So my goal became to offer a public forum where interested parties can talk about these things.}}

The site received much national press in early 2006, the ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' and ''[[Inside Higher Ed]].'' Both weighed in:
{{quote|For some professors who have had to cringe at scathing personal attacks posted by students on RateMyProfessors.com, a new blog—Rate Your Students—is providing a bit of [[catharsis]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2006/01/16/rate&lt;/ref&gt;}}

But some college newspapers were dismissive, including the ''[[Cavalier Daily]]'', the weekly student newspaper at the [[University of Virginia]], where one editor wrote:
{{quote|Rate Your Students exists for no serious reason. After perusing the site for 20 minutes or so, I was shocked and disappointed with the immature content I found. These professors are substituting mockery for the constructive communication that should be taking place. Rather than create an elitist Web site where students are depicted as rude, [[iPod]]-sporting somnambulists, professors should advocate a better response to students' desire for information about their future professors—a desire that stems more from insecurity than apathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cavalierdaily.com/CVArticle_print.asp?ID=25631&amp;pid1386 |title=Ranting, Not Rating |first=Sina |last=Kian |work=[[Cavalier Daily]] |date=2006-12-05 |archiveurl=http://google.com/search?q=cache:tv-jdnsJLRQJ:www.cavalierdaily.com/CVArticle.asp%3FID%3D25631%26pid%3D1386+ranting+not+rating+site:cavalierdaily.com&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=us&amp;client=firefox-a |archivedate=2008-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==The program==
The Root-Tilden-Kern Program looks for students with a demonstrated commitment to the public interest, exceptional leadership ability, and a history of academic achievement. In assessing these criteria, the program looks at the whole person and considers previous life experience and professional work. The program values diversity and strives to select a class that is diverse in terms of race, sex, class, ethnicity, sexual orientation, geographic origins, and ideology. Interested candidates should submit an application with their application to New York University School of Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.nyu.edu/publicinterestlawcenter/financialassistance/scholarships/rootscholarship/howtoapply/index.htm |title=How to Apply | work = NYU Law |publisher=New York University School of Law |date= |accessdate=May 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application is reviewed by a student and faculty committee before recommendation for an interview. Each year, approximately 50 applicants are invited to interview with a panel composed of a faculty member, a judge, a practitioner and third-year scholars. Twenty scholars are selected for each incoming class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.nyu.edu/publicinterestlawcenter/financialassistance/scholarships/rootscholarship/theselectionprocess/index.htm |title=The Selection Process | work = NYU Law |publisher=New York University School of Law |date=April 6, 2016 |accessdate=May 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
In the 1950s, Dean Emeritus Arthur Vanderbilt conceived of the Root-Tilden Scholarship to transform NYU from a local law school to a nationally and internationally esteemed institution. Founded in 1951, the purpose of the program was to “train promising young men so as to help attain again for the American bar the high position which it once held as the reservoir of altruistic and competent public leadership.” 

The program was named for two alumni, [[Elihu Root]] and [[Samuel Tilden]], who exemplified Vanderbilt's ideal – lawyers dedicated to public leadership. Twenty scholars were selected for the first class from each of the country's then ten judicial circuits. Scholars were at first required to take special courses in the humanities, social sciences, history and natural sciences and required to live together and share mealtimes five days a week. Scholars met with leaders in government, industry and finance. In 1969,&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt; after a campaign by student groups, the first women were admitted to the Root Program. To date, more than 800 Root-Tilden Scholars have graduated from NYU School of Law.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.nyu.edu/publicinterestlawcenter/financialassistance/scholarships/rootscholarship/programhistory/index.htm |title=Program History | work = NYU Law |publisher=New York University School of Law |date= |accessdate=May 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, then Dean John Sexton announced a precedent-setting gift of $5 million from an alumnus of the Root-Tilden Scholarship, Jerome H. Kern 1960, that began a major capital campaign to raise $30 million for the program. To honor Kern's generous contribution, the Law School renamed the program as the Root-Tilden-Kern Scholarship Program. Kern is the chairman of Symphony Media Systems, LLC, and was formerly a senior partner of the law firm Baker &amp; Botts. In 2004, under the leadership of Dean Richard Revesz, the Law School successfully completed its campaign goal of $30 million and now offers full-tuition scholarships to 20 students each year.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Early life and education==

Barkley was born in [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]], [[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh]], [[New York (state)|New York]].  He was one of five children, born to Donald Stuart Barkley (27 February 1916 - 15 June 1999) and Mildred Minerva (10 September 1914 - 25 April 2008). Barkley had a twin brother, Ronald Foster Barkley,&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.additudemag.com/adhd/article/9673.html |title=Adult ADHD: Driving Under the Influence...of Attention Deficit |access-date=2014-04-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315173352/http://www.additudemag.com/adhd/article/9673.html |archive-date=2014-03-15 |dead-url=no |df= |date=2012-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who was killed in a car crash on 24 July 2006. Barkley attributes his brother's history of dangerous and reckless behavior, including not wearing a seat belt and speeding at the time of his crash, to untreated ADHD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adhdrewired.com/russell-barkley-meaning-of-adhd/|title=Russell Barkley on the Meaning of ADHD - ADHD reWired|date=12 May 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronald was several times over the drink drive limit, speeding and not wearing a speed belt at the time of his fatal crash.&lt;ref&gt;ADHD Nation - Schwarz (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Barkley married his wife Patricia on 15 March 1969.

Barkley earned an [[Associate of Arts]] from [[Wayne Community College]] in [[Goldsboro, North Carolina]] in June 1972, and a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in psychology from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].&lt;ref name="VITA Russell A.

==Career==
In 1978, Barkley founded the Neuropsychology Service at the [[Medical College of Wisconsin]] and [[Children's Hospital of Wisconsin|Milwaukee Children's Hospital]], and served as its chief until 1985. He then moved to the [[University of Massachusetts Medical School]], where he served as Director of Psychology from 1985 to 2000. Barkley was professor of psychiatry and neurology at the [[University of Massachusetts Medical School|University of Massachusetts Medical Center]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Richardson, [https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/04/news/04iht-cane.html "Suicide Risk in Caning, U.S. Doctor Warns"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306203558/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/04/news/04iht-cane.html |date=2016-03-06 }}, ''The New York Times'', May 4, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.russellbarkley.org/about.html |title=About Russell A.

On 16 November 1998 Barkley asserted that "Ritalin will be classed as one of the leading developments for helping individuals".&lt;Ref&gt;ADHD Nation - Alan Schwarz (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

Barkley, a leader in the burgeoning [[sluggish cognitive tempo]] research field has direct financial ties to Eli Lilly, a promoter of the condition (Barkley received $118,000 from 2009 to 2012 for consulting and speaking engagements from Eli Lilly). When referring to the "increasing clinical referrals occurring now and more rapidly in the near future driven by increased awareness of the general public in SCT", Barkley writes "The fact that SCT is not recognized as yet in any official taxonomy of psychiatric disorders will not alter this circumstance given the growing presence of information on SCT at various widely visited internet sites such as YouTube and Wikipedia, among others." 

Peter Breggin and Fred Baughman are very critical of Barkley's work on ADHD, claiming that he exaggerates the benefits of stimulants and minimizes their hazards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=hBd0V7Ex8PUC&amp;pg=PR17&amp;lpg=PR17&amp;dq=Peter+breggin%2BRussell+Barkley%2BADHD |title=Brain Disabling Treatments in Psychiatry |author=Breggin, P. R. |page=264|isbn=9780826129352 |date=2007-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barkley himself edits the Sluggish Cognitive Tempo Wikipedia page.&lt;ref name="Schwarz"/&gt;

Gretchen LeFever Watson, a practising psychologist in south east Virginia began a program of ADHD research that included epidemiologic surveys. This research documented 15% rates of ADHD diagnosis and drug treatment in her community. Diagnosis rates also slammed and attacked by [[Keith Conners]] and [[Allen Frances]]. Upon hearing of this, Barkley intervened and struck back, asserting that too few people were being diagnosed and medicated for ADHD. In 2004 Barkley claimed that LeFever’s findings from multiple peer-reviewed and published studies were so questionable that they “deserve investigation".&lt;ref name="Watson GL, Arcona AP, Antonuccio DO, Healy D 2014 43–52"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3918118/|title=Shooting the Messenger: The Case of ADHD|first1=Gretchen LeFever|last1=Watson|first2=Andrea Powell|last2=Arcona|first3=David O.|last3=Antonuccio|first4=David|last4=Healy|date=9 November 2018|journal=Journal of Contemporary Psychotherapy|volume=44|issue=1|pages=43–52|via=PubMed Central|doi=10.1007/s10879-013-9244-x|pmid=24532852|pmc=3918118}} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons License.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within weeks of Barkley’s call for an investigation of LeFever’s findings, someone submitted an anonymous complaint about LeFever’s work to EVMS (i.e., the complaint described above). In response, EVMS conducted an internal investigation of LeFever’s past and current research. Against EVMS policy and common protocol for investigation of allegations of scientific misconduct, the medical school confirmed to the media that LeFever was under investigation.&lt;ref name="Watson GL, Arcona AP, Antonuccio DO, Healy D 2014 43–52"/&gt;

==Political views==

Barkley is a [[right-wing libertarian]]. He deeply believes in "Limited government, individual rights, freedom of speech and association, and the nonaggression principle (no one, including the government, has a right to initiate force or fraud against another), and private property rights". He has attacked "the leftist, [[social democratic]] or socialist leanings of Facebook's founder and most mainstream media outlets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/DrRussellBarkley/posts/554279708096260|title=Russell A Barkley, PhD|website=www.facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4804">The '''Scotland Road Free School''' was a short-lived example of [[democratic education]] and [[Free school movement|free-schooling]] started in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 1970 by two [[Liverpool]] teachers, John Ord and Bill Murphy.  The latter went on to  initiate a closely linked project, '''Liverpool Community Transport'''.

==The Free School==
According to the school's prospectus, Ord and Murphy wanted  to establish "a school run by children, parents and teachers together, without a headmaster, centralised authority or the usual hierarchies.  It would be open when it was needed and lessons would be optional". The prospectus added: "The school will be a community school....totally involved with its environment.....the vanguard of social change".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afed.org.uk/org/issue63/learn.html&lt;/ref&gt;  It was based in a former school building in Major Street, close to the Boundary Street/[[Scotland Road]] junction  .  The pupils were granted considerable freedom and responsibility, and they benefitted from frequent trips to outside venues.   Summer camps were organised at Carrog and Coniston.  Teachers and helpers were all unpaid volunteers, many "on the dole".

The "Scottie Road"  Free School experiment took place while the world-wide "free-schooling/de-schooling" ideology was at its height.  The School attained a certain notoriety, receiving visits from educationalists, researchers and social workers.  Partly to raise funds and partly to spread "the message", teachers at the school would travel to give lectures at meetings and at colleges (including  Leeds University and Bretton Hall College).  The School became a forum that linked with other radical movements, such as a women's refuge in Seel Street, and (later) some housing association developments.

Bill Murphy moved on to concentrate on Liverpool Community Transport, which he established in nearby Leeds Street; but John Ord stayed with the school throughout.  The Local Authority found the school's lack of formal curriculum unsatisfactory and were antipathetic to its existence; and the school closed after only a few years.  After the closure, Ord later went on to become a [[Derek Hatton|"Hattonista"]] on the local Council; while Murphy emigrated to New Zealand to further his interest in [[alternative technology]].

In 1971, John Walmsley, a photographer who specialises in education photos, captured a series of images which record the early days of the Free School.&lt;ref&gt;http://educationphotos.photoshelter.com/gallery/Liverpool-Free-School-1971/G0000yYUNf1OH3wc/C0000jJDw4WXKPR4/&lt;/ref&gt;  (Walmsley also wrote a "pictorial study" of [[Summerhill School|Summerhill]] which Penguin published as an Education Special&lt;ref&gt;Neill &amp; Summerhill, A Man and His Work – A pictorial study by John Walmsley, Penguin Education, 1969, {{ISBN|0140801340}} &amp; {{ISBN|978-0140801347}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

In July 2017 Liverpool's Bluecoat Gallery&lt;ref&gt;Bluecoat Gallery [http://www.thebluecoat.org.uk/gallery/gallery-public-view-art-at-the-heart-of-bluecoat]&lt;/ref&gt; began staging a 10-week exhibition called "Abacus".&lt;ref&gt; Abacus [http://www.thebluecoat.org.uk/blog/view/who-is-blogging/302]&lt;/ref&gt; It purpose was to be "for and about children", and one part of the exhibition featured John Walmsley's photographs of the school.  John Ord was present and he announced that in 2020 a 50-year retrospective event of the Free School is proposed.

== Liverpool Community Transport ==
Having set up the Free School with John Ord, Bill Murphy went on to establish and concentrate on a new venture, Liverpool Community Transport.  This began in ramshackle premises, but soon moved to a large disused transport depot in Leeds Street.  A number of vehicles were acquired, including two [[Leyland Titan (front-engined double-decker)|Leyland PD2]] double-decker buses, a coach, and a Luton van.  The buses were used to take Free School children on school visits and camping trips to Carrog in Wales, and to Coniston in the Lake District, as well as giving local families and pensioners outings such as visits to the [[Blackpool Illuminations]].  Most notably, a double-decker took a busload of activists across the Snake Pass in the Pennines to support the [[Clay Cross#Housing Finance Act dispute|Clay Cross councillors]] who were [[Rate-capping rebellion|refusing to implement the rate-capping provisions]] of the Conservative government's Housing Finance Act.

[[Birju Maharaj]] and Pt. Mohan Rao Kallianpurkar. Her idiom of Kathak dance which has been developed over many years of learning's from the above-mentioned gurus and from self learning has led to a blending, which has special inputs in ‘Taal’ and ‘Laya’, from tabla taal maestro and exponent Pt.

'''Shelburne Farms''' is a nonprofit education center for sustainability, {{convert|1400|acre}} working farm, and [[National Historic Landmark]] on the shores of [[Lake Champlain]] in [[Shelburne, Vermont]].  The property is nationally significant as a well-preserved example of a [[Gilded Age]] "ornamental farm", developed in the late 19th century with architecture by [[Robert Henderson Robertson]] and landscaping by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]].

==Description and history==
Shelburne Farms was created in 1886 by [[William Seward Webb|Dr. William Seward Webb]] and [[Eliza Osgood Vanderbilt Webb]] as a model agricultural estate, using money inherited from railroad magnate [[William Henry Vanderbilt]]. They commissioned landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] to guide the layout of {{convert|3800|acre}} of farm, field and forest, and New York architect [[Robert Henderson Robertson]],  to design the buildings.  The estate was created by purchasing a large number of mostly agricultural properties, and then adapting the existing roads and lanes (some of which were public ways the Webbs petitioned to have closed) to fulfill the Webbs' vision for the estate.&lt;ref name=nhl&gt;{{cite web|url={{NHLS url|id=80000330}}|title=NHL nomination for Shelburne Farms|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2015-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The property was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1980, and was designated a [[National Historic Landmark District]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

Shelburne Farms was incorporated as a nonprofit educational organization in 1972 by descendants of the Webbs. Nearly {{convert|400|acre}} of sustainably managed woodlands received ''Green Certification'' from the [[Forest Stewardship Council]] in 1998.  The farm's grass-based [[dairy]] supports a herd of 125 purebred, registered [[Brown Swiss]] [[cows]]. Their milk is made into farmhouse [[cheddar cheese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shelburnefarms.org/about/cheesmakingawards.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908012838/http://www.shelburnefarms.org/about/cheesmakingawards.htm |archivedate=2006-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The farm serves as an educational resource by practicing rural land use that is environmentally, economically and culturally [[Sustainability|sustainable]]. Visitors may enjoy the walking trails, children's farmyard, inn, restaurant, property tours and special events.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3524">A '''student-run advertising agency''' acts like a real [[advertising agency]], but is operated by students. The agency can be included in the academic curriculum, allowing students to work in the agency for academic credit. Or, the agency can simply be housed within the academic unit, allowing students to work in the agency for volunteer experience. In other cases, the agency can operate as a student club within the broader organizational structure of the university. The student-run agency provides advertising and similar communications services to various organizations such as college departments, small businesses, and community-based [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organization]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. Some agencies compete with professionals and charge for services. Other agencies do all their work without charge. Other agencies have a philanthropic focus whereby communications work is conducted for free for nonprofits, while for-profit entities are asked to make a charitable donation to the agency to support its learner-centered focus.

As is the case with communications agencies in the real world, student-run agencies typically offer a variety of support to clients, including public relations, marketing, promotions, and social media support. The main appeal of a student-run advertising agency for clients is that the agency can provide professional-quality work at no cost or very small cost. The primary appeal for students is that they gain real-world experience unlike anything that can result from a traditional classroom experience. Students working in this environment have to mentor each other. Students learn to engage in "reverse mentoring" whereby they typically have more experience and knowledge of communication than their clients - so they must educate the clients. In all agency environments, development of time management and teamwork skills is essential. Students must collaborate to produce work that satisfies the client and the agency supervisor (typically a faculty member). The work must be academically appropriate and professionally relevant. This balance of responsibilities and oversight makes the student-run agency an ideal learning experience and preparation for the professional workplace.

The '''Student Spaceflight Experiments Program''' ('''SSEP''') provides an opportunity for student groups from upper elementary school through university to design and fly [[microgravity]] experiments in [[low Earth orbit|low Earth orbit (LEO)]].&lt;ref name="ncesse_ssep"&gt;{{cite web | title = Student Spaceflight Experiments Program | work = ncesse.org | publisher = National Center for Earth and Space Science Education | date = October 30, 2012 | url = http://ncesse.org/programs/student-spaceflight-experiments-program/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; SSEP is a program of the [[National Center for Earth and Space Science Education]] (NCESSE, a project of the [[Tides Center]]), the [[Arthur C. Clarke]] Institute for Space Education, and the private space hardware company [[NanoRacks]].&lt;ref name="gaskill"/&gt; SSEP operates under a [[Space Act Agreement]] between the sponsoring organizations and [[NASA]], allowing the  [[International Space Station]] (ISS) to be utilized as a [[Center for the Advancement of Science in Space|national laboratory]].&lt;ref name="spaceref"&gt;{{cite web | title = Student Spaceflight Experiments Program – Mission 6 to the International Space Station | work = spaceref.com | publisher = SpaceRef Interactive Inc. | date = October 30, 2013 | url = http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=44901 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The program was launched in June 2010, by NCESSE in the U.S. and by the Clarke Institute internationally.&lt;ref name="gaskill"&gt;{{cite web | last = Gaskill | first = Melissa | title = Student Scientists Present Unexpected Results from Space Station Research | work = Space Station: Research &amp; Technology | publisher = [[NASA]] | date = August 6, 2014 | url = http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/2014_ssep_conference/#.VDsAivmwLYj }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2018}}, SSEP has sponsored fourteen missions to LEO – two on board the [[Space Shuttle]], and twelve to the ISS – with a thirteenth mission to the ISS announced in March 2018, and expected to fly in the spring/summer of 2019.&lt;ref name="ssep_in_the_news"&gt;{{cite web | title = SSEP in the News | work = Student Spaceflight Experiments Program Community Network Hubsite | publisher = National Center for Earth and Space Science Education | url = http://ssep.ncesse.org/communities/in-the-news/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mission7"&gt;{{cite web | last = Goldstein | first = Jeff | title = New Flight Opportunity for School Districts: Announcing Student Spaceflight Experiments Program (SSEP) Mission 7 to the International Space Station for 2014-15 Academic Year | work = ncesse.org | publisher = National Center for Earth and Space Science Education | date = April 21, 2014 | url = http://ssep.ncesse.org/2014/04/new-flight-opportunity-for-school-districts-announcing-student-spaceflight-experiments-program-ssep-mission-7-to-the-international-space-station-for-2014-15-academic-year/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mission 13"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Flight Opportunity for School Districts: Announcing Student Spaceflight Experiments Program (SSEP) Mission 13 to the International Space Station, Starting September 2018|url=http://ssep.ncesse.org/2018/03/new-flight-opportunity-for-school-districts-announcing-student-spaceflight-experiments-program-ssep-mission-13-to-the-international-space-station-starting-september-2018/|publisher=Student Spaceflight Experiments Program|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first fourteen SSEP flight opportunities, 86,800 students in grades 5 through 16 ([[Senior (education)|senior undergraduate]] in the [[higher education in the United States|U.S. higher education system]]) participated in experiment design and proposal writing. Of 18,759 proposals received, a total of 240 experiments were selected for flight, with one from each community participating in each flight opportunity. {{As of|2017|8|14}}, 206 of these experiments have been successfully launched.&lt;ref name="experiments_selected"&gt;{{cite web | title = Experiments Selected for Flight | work = Student Spaceflight Experiments Program Community Network Hubsite | publisher = National Center for Earth and Space Science Education | url = http://ssep.ncesse.org/communities/experiments-selected-for-flight/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 18 experiments comprising Mission 6 to the ISS were lost when the [[Cygnus CRS Orb-3]] vehicle exploded shortly after launch on 28 October 2014.&lt;ref name=bever&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bever|first1=Lindsey|title=Students lost science experiments in Antares explosion|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/10/29/students-lost-science-experiments-in-antares-explosion/|accessdate=31 October 2014|work=The Washington Post|date=October 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
The competition to select student projects for flight is designed to resemble a standard [[research proposal]] process. Interested groups must submit proposals in response to [[request for proposal|announced criteria]]; these proposals are then [[peer-review]]ed against the criteria in a two-stage selection process, with the vast majority of proposals rejected.&lt;ref name="the_competition"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Flight Experiment Design Competition | work = ncesse.org | publisher = National Center for Earth and Space Science Education  | url = http://ssep.ncesse.org/about-ssep/the-flight-experiment-design-competition/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each selected experiment is provided with one mini-laboratory, which is flown on the ISS and then returned to Earth for analysis.&lt;ref name="mission7"/&gt; Experiments selected for flight have included research into [[crystal growth]], [[composting]], [[cell division]], [[seed germination]], and [[calcium metabolism]].&lt;ref name="mission4_selected"&gt;{{cite web | title = Selected Experiments on SSEP Mission 4 to ISS | work = Student Spaceflight Experiments Program Community Network Hubsite | publisher = National Center for Earth and Space Science Education | url = http://ssep.ncesse.org/communities/experiments-selected-for-flight/selected-experiments-on-ssep-mission-4-to-iss/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mission5_selected"&gt;{{cite web | title = Selected Experiments on SSEP Mission 5 to ISS | work = Student Spaceflight Experiments Program Community Network Hubsite | publisher = National Center for Earth and Space Science Education | url = http://ssep.ncesse.org/communities/experiments-selected-for-flight/selected-experiments-on-ssep-mission-5-to-iss/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mission6_selected"&gt;{{cite web | title = Selected Experiments on SSEP Mission 6 to ISS | work = Student Spaceflight Experiments Program Community Network Hubsite | publisher = National Center for Earth and Space Science Education | url = http://ssep.ncesse.org/communities/experiments-selected-for-flight/selected-experiments-on-ssep-mission-6-to-iss/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of each experiment is on the order of [[United States dollar|US$]]24,500, which must be raised by the community developing the experiment.&lt;ref name="bass"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ssep.ncesse.org/about-ssep/ssep-program-costs/|title=SSEP Program costs|last=|first=|date=|work=ncesse.org|publisher=National Center for Earth and Space Science Education|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students have an opportunity to share their research at a national conference sponsored by the Smithsonian [[National Air and Space Museum]], NCESSE, and the Clarke Institute.&lt;ref name="gaskill"/&gt; Students participating in the program have also been given the chance to participate in a [[videoconferencing|videoconference]] with space station astronauts.&lt;ref name="nasm"&gt;{{cite web | last = Grove | first = Tim | title = An Out-of-This-World Program | work = nasm.si.edu | publisher = Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum | date = April 26, 2013 | url = http://blog.nasm.si.edu/education/an-out-of-this-world-program/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32300">[[The Holocaust]] is conceptualized and narrated in [[textbook]]s worldwide in a variety of approaches to treating temporal and spatial scales, protagonists, interpretative paradigms, narrative techniques, didactic methods and national idiosyncrasies with and within which the Holocaust. There exist convergent trends or internationally shared narrative templates, and divergent trends or narrative idiosyncrasies, which generally establish links between the Holocaust and local events. Textbooks in most countries focus most closely, via photographs and legal documentation, on the perpetrators’ point of view. This is a key component of [[education about the Holocaust]].&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002287/228776e.pdf|title=The International status of education about the Holocaust: a global mapping of textbooks and curricula|last=Carrier|first=Peter|last2=Fuchs|first2=Eckhardt|last3=Messinger|first3=Torben|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100033-1|location=|pages=4, 12, 19–20, 34–37, 74, 158–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scale ==

=== Spatial scale ===
Many textbooks ascribe multiple spaces (ranging from local, national to European and worldwide) to the Holocaust via authorial texts and especially in maps which show either the sites of [[Extermination camp|concentration and extermination camps]] or, less commonly, military manœuvres during the Second World War. Transnational spaces are evoked in relation to the topics of collaboration (in France and Republic of Moldova, for example), [[emigration]] (in China, Argentina and the USA, for example) and in relation to mass atrocities or genocide in China and Rwanda, while textbooks from other countries, such as Brazil or El Salvador, do not allude to the significance of the Holocaust in their own countries. The event is generally named as one which occurred in Europe and Germany, while some textbooks domesticate the event, as in Belarus, Germany and Republic of Moldova, by providing details about the local repercussions of the Holocaust. Details of the occupying regime and administration of the General Government and of the role of satellite states are rare. Transcontinental connections are sometimes established which pit Europe against Asia where, for example, Indian authors refer to the threat of the ‘Europeanization’ of Asia, where authors of a Russian textbook qualify National Socialism as a ‘European’ phenomenon, or where another textbook from the Russian Federation refers to a ‘battle of European culture against Russian and [[Bolsheviks|bolshevist]] barbarity’.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Temporal scales ===
The temporal or historical context ascribed to the Holocaust is generally that of the Second World War; time spans given range from 1933 to 1945, with some mentions of key changes in 1938 or 1942 or the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising|Warsaw ghetto uprising of 1943]]. References to deeper historical currents such as racial theories from the nineteenth century are mentioned in textbooks in Brazil, India, Germany and Namibia; Jewish history, emigration, or pre-twentieth century antisemitism are addressed in Argentinian, German, Japanese and American textbooks. Likewise, several textbook authors in Argentina, France, Germany, Namibia and the Russian Federation write about the aftereffects or memory of the Holocaust after 1945. Although human rights are frequently mentioned in connection with the Holocaust, textbook authors rarely explain or express in detail the universal legal or moral significance of the Holocaust. Some authors, of English textbooks for example, emphasize wider issues regarding how ‘ordinary people’ became ‘killers’, and while authors in Singapore focus on the universal history of racism, no textbooks in any countries can be said to present an ahistorical or universal narrative of the Holocaust.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Protagonists ==

=== Perpetrators ===
Perpetrators are most frequently referred to as ‘Nazis’, ‘Germans’ and ‘fascists’. Individuals commonly named include [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]], [[Reinhard Heydrich|Heydrich]], [[Rudolf Höss|Höss]] and [[Adolf Eichmann|Eichmann]]. Most striking is the extent to which Hitlercentrism pervades textbook narratives of the Holocaust, with Hitler functioning as a moral repository for the event, as embodied in portraits of Hitler, excerpts from [[Mein Kampf]] and the attribution of sole responsibility to Hitler in such phrases, found in Russian textbooks, as ‘Hitlerian aggression’ or the ‘policy of Hitler-Germany’. By contrast, textbooks in France and Germany generally marginalize the role of Hitler in favour of an explanation of the event as a result of plural causes.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Victims ===
Victims are most frequently named as Jews and ‘Gypsies’ in textbooks from almost all countries, while other groups of victims, such as Slavs, people with disabilities, political opponents and homosexuals, are named less frequently. Other categories of victims are named, for example, as ‘black victims’ or ‘black people’ in South African, Rwandan and Indian textbooks. Generic references to an ‘inner enemy’ (in one Russian textbook) or to so-called ‘inferior’ or ‘undesirable’ ‘people’ (in Chinese, Russian and Uruguyan textbooks) detract from the specificity of Nazi ideology, while some references to Jewish victims as ‘opponents’ (in Côte d’Ivoire, for example) may mislead readers into believing that all Jews resisted or posed a threat to the National Socialist regime and that they were therefore a legitimate target of repression. Few textbooks depict Jewish life before 1933 or after 1945 (Germany is one example of a country whose textbooks do); most textbooks therefore largely present Jews as voiceless victims and as objects of perpetrators’ volition. Textbook authors in some countries regularly define victims in terms of national groups (as Poles, Ukrainians and Russians in Russian textbooks, for example) or nationalize Jewish identity in terms of ‘Polish’and ‘European’ (in Chinese textbooks), or ‘Ukrainian’ and ‘Hungarian’ Jews (in French textbooks). Numbers of victims are named in textbooks from approximately half the countries surveyed; most of these figures are accurate, although several textbooks draw attention not to the overall numbers of Jewish victims, but to the numbers of war victims generally (as in Russian textbooks), and to numbers of victims of specific nations or of specific camps. Images of the destroyed cities of [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima]] and [[Bombing of Dresden|Dresden]] in French textbooks or of victims of [[apartheid]] in South Africa or of Chinese people during the Japanese invasion of 1937 extend the scope of victims to those of other atrocities.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Other protagonists ===
Other protagonists include members of the [[Resistance during World War II|resistance]], rescuers of the persecuted, [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]], and local individuals who are named by their proper names, such as [[Janusz Korczak]] in Polish textbooks. Few bystanders or collaborators feature in the textbooks.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Individual complexity ===
The general distinction between active and passive protagonists, which is underscored by the use of the passive mode in several textbooks, highlights a dichotomy which fails to acknowledge the day-to-day responsibilities and decisions with which protagonists such as [[Kurt Gerstein]] or members of the [[Sonderkommando]] (presented in Polish and German textbooks respectively) were faced. Moreover, the focus on concentration and extermination camps as places of systematic persecution and murder detracts from details of lives of individuals at all stages of the Holocaust and from complex relationships between individuals, between individuals and groups, and between one group and another. [[Gender role]]s and relations during the Holocaust, as embodied in the different treatment of male and female prisoners or in the behaviour of female camp guards, are addressed in none of the textbooks in this sample; [[Anne Frank]] and/or homosexual victims are mentioned in the textbooks, albeit without reference to gender roles and relations.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Interpretative paradigms ==
Textbook authors generally present the Holocaust in the context of a political history of the Second World War (of the rise of the National Socialist Party, of Hitler, of nationalism, expansionism and appeasement), but also emphasize state racial policy, Hitler’s personal beliefs, [[totalitarianism]], and concentration and extermination camps, while in some cases drawing on historiographical models such as a ‘breach in civilization’ (in Chinese and Indian textbooks) and stages of ‘deportation’, ‘concentration’ and ‘extermination’ (in the Ivorian textbook) which correspond to the concepts found in Dan Diner’s and Raul Hilberg’s work on the Holocaust.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Conceptualizations of the Holocaust ===
The majority of textbooks in all countries name the event as the ‘Holocaust’, to which are added, in the course of the presentations, paraphrases of the event in terms of, for example, ‘discrimination against Jewish people, sent to concentration camps’ (in a Japanese textbook) or, characteristically, as ‘systematic killings’, ‘extermination’, ‘systematic genocide’, the ‘Final Solution’ and ‘massacres’ (in South African textbooks). The largely descriptive nature of history textbooks means that they generally adopt inclusive definitions of the event, that is, definitions which derive from the details of the event rather than from an exclusive a priori definition. Exceptions to this general rule are cases in which the Holocaust is not named or alluded to euphemistically, as in one Indian textbook, or in which it is paraphrased in partial terms, as in Egyptian and Syrian textbooks.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Aims, motives and responsibilities of protagonists ===
Most commonly, in almost all countries, the personalization of the event (its explanation as stemming from the personal convictions of one person) in relation to Hitler is a central interpretative paradigm. The textbook currently used in Namibian schools is characteristic of this technique. In this book, the Holocaust is dealt with in a section entitled ‘antisemitism’, on the first page of which the word ‘Hitler’ appears in a box in the middle of the page from which arrows point towards party organizations; the authors describe Hitler’s personal ‘determination to remove Jews from Germany’. English textbooks also refer to Hitler’s irrational hatred of the Jews and to his personal desire for revenge against Jews.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Causes ===
The most frequently named cause of the Holocaust is ideology ([[racism]], antisemitism, totalitarianism, [[authoritarianism]], [[militarism]], [[capitalism]], fascism). Textbooks in Brazil, Germany, Côte d’Ivoire, Japan, Republic of Moldova and Rwanda also qualify the expansionist policy of Nazi Germany as a form of colonialism.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Historiographical paradigms ===
Most textbook authors make use of one or more historiographical paradigms in order to explain the Holocaust. The two most common, and largely shared, paradigms are the identification of categories of protagonists in terms of perpetrators, victims and bystanders, and the attribution of moral responsibility to one or more individuals in what has become known as ‘intentionalism’. Most textbooks in this survey conceive of protagonists as either perpetrators or victims, in addition to those who resisted the regime and, occasionally, bystanders and/or rescuers. No textbooks explore ambivalent roles beyond these categories. In some cases, as in French and Ivorian textbooks, Hilberg’s stages of the Holocaust, defined as identification, concentration and deportation, are reflected in textbook representations. Other paradigms include: the ‘breach of civilization’ ascribed to Dan Diner, which is echoed in textbooks in China and India; the behaviour of ‘ordinary Germans’ ascribed to Daniel Goldhagen in English textbooks; the effects of bureaucratization ascribed to [[Zygmunt Bauman]], featured in textbooks in Argentina; the effects of peer pressure ascribed to [[Christopher Browning]], discussed in textbooks in the USA; cumulative radicalization or functionalism ascribed to [[Hans Mommsen]], raised in textbooks in England; and references to colonial aspects underpinning the Holocaust, made in textbooks from Brazil, Germany, Japan and Republic of Moldova. The large variety of historiographical authorities and works referred to in order to explain the event show that there is little consensus between textbook authors over explanatory models.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Metanarratives ===
A small number of textbooks, in Argentina, Poland, Spain and the USA, for example, complement their presentations of the history of the Holocaust with meta-historical commentaries in the form of glossaries of historic terms. Meta-narrative approaches are pedagogically effective when explaining the political expediency of commemorations of the Holocaust via monuments or in international relations, as in textbooks from Argentina, Germany, India and the Russian Federation. They also encourage a critical approach to such phenomena as the personality cult surrounding Hitler, as outlined in the Salvadorian textbook in our sample. In exceptional cases, authors not only apply historiographical paradigms, but also discuss their merits, as in the sketches of [[Hannah Arendt|Hannah Arendt’s]], Zygmunt Bauman’s and [[Daniel Goldhagen|Daniel Goldhagen’s]] explanations of the Holocaust in Argentinian textbooks.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Comparisons ===
Comparisons between the Holocaust and other mass atrocities or genocides are often alluded to but not explained. Usage of the terms ‘terror’ and ‘cleansing’ in some Polish textbooks to describe historically different events detracts from their historical specificities. Similarly, the use of the term ‘terrorist’ to describe Hitler in one Brazilian textbook, ‘terror’ to describe the Holocaust in one German textbook, or even the definition of [[Zionism|Zionist]] forces in Palestine as Jewish ‘terror groups’ in one Iraqi textbook lend themselves to semantic confusion if not anachronism. Similar semantic confusion arises when the term ‘extermination’ is used to describe the function of the Gulag in one Brazilian textbook or when a Belarussian textbook inaccurately claims that the National Socialist regime planned the ‘extermination of the Soviet people’, or when different regimes are described collectively as ‘totalitarian’ in Argentinian, Brazilian, French, Moldovan, Polish, Spanish, and briefly in English and Rwandan textbooks. The use of the term ‘fascism’ to describe the German and Japanese authorities during the Second World War and the use of the term ‘genocide’ (datusha) in Chinese textbooks to refer to crimes committed by both the Japanese forces in Nanjing and the National Socialists in the Holocaust detract from historical distinctions. Comparisons are also evoked by the use of images. The juxtaposition of images of different events, such as the images of [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] and the [[Nanking Massacre|Nanjing massacre]] in one French textbook, or of Dresden and Hiroshima in another French textbook, the association of suffering during the Holocaust with suffering caused by the atomic bomb in Hiroshima in one Ivorian textbook, or the association of Auschwitz and life under apartheid in one South African textbook, similarly obscure historical differences rather than explaining them comparatively. While such indiscriminate use of terms and imagery to describe different historical events is commonplace, and while textbooks in some countries allude to similarities by juxtaposing images or textual association, some textbooks in Poland and Argentina, for example, avoid relativizing the Holocaust by providing clear explanations of the comparable motives, methods and aims of the perpetrators of different mass crimes.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Narrative techniques ==

=== Open versus closed narratives ===
Narrative techniques found in a small number of the textbooks are ‘closed’, which means that the authorial perspective involves a single narrative voice without quotations or complementary documents (as in Albanian textbooks). At the other extreme, some authors apply, at least in part, an open technique by juxtaposing images of different historical events (of a man holding his passport during apartheid beside an image of prisoners arriving in Auschwitz in one South African textbook, for example) in order to allude to meanings without explaining them. The majority of textbooks apply a technique midway between these extremes, juxtaposing authorial texts with additional perspectives reflected in quotations and textual and visual documentation.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Points of view ===
The predominance of textual and visual documentation produced by perpetrators, which generally assures considerable understanding of perpetrators’ lives and motives, is frequently found in combination with emotive language expressing condemnation of their acts, often in pathological terms, such as the descriptions of them as ‘crazy’ and ‘unbelievable’ in Chinese textbooks. In some cases authors inadvertently perpetuate the perpetrators’ viewpoint. One Ivorian textbook, for example, presents victims primarily as ‘opponents, especially the Jews and the Gypsies’, then as ‘millions of men, women and children’, then as ‘Jews’, and thereby reinforces the idea that ‘the’ Jews and ‘the’ Gypsies (that is, all of them) were killed as a result of their role as ‘opponents’, as if the killers, at least according to their own reasoning, therefore had a just reason to kill them. This conflation of members of the resistance, Jews and Gypsies effectively reproduces the perpetrators’ view that the [[Third Reich]] needed to defend itself against an alleged threat.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Types of moral narrative employed (decline, fatalism or progression) ===
Most striking are the different ways in which authors lend moral value to the Holocaust. Most authors couch the history of the Holocaust in terms of decline followed by progress. However, the object of this progression varies from one country to another. Polish textbooks notably combine stories of national resistance to the German occupation of Poland with references to the Polish underground government, Polish helpers and Jewish resistance as exemplified by the Warsaw ghetto uprising. Russian textbooks, by contrast, as do those from the USA, focus on progression towards military victory in the Second World War and thus present allied military victory in the place of victory over the Holocaust, in particular over the camp system. The French textbook designed for the final year of secondary schooling even presents the history of commemoration of the Holocaust in progressive terms as one which shifted from national homage to national moral integrity via the acknowledgement of crimes. The most commonly found narrative of progression is one which ends with an allusion to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[Genocide Convention|Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]] adopted by the United Nations in 1948.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Implied readers ===
The complexity of the presentation of, the values named in relation to, and the type of (local, national or international) framework in which authors place the Holocaust, reflects the prior knowledge of the textbooks’ expected readers. North American textbooks, for example, emphasize liberal values and tolerance of difference; Chinese and Albanian textbooks praise local people who helped Jewish refugees; German textbooks extol democracy and the rule of law as opposed to dictatorship, and also assume that the Holocaust is a German event, the product of National Socialism in the absence of non-German collaborators.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Didactic approaches ==

=== Types of exercises ===
These vary widely from, at one extreme, the lack of any exercises urging pupils to question and explore materials presented in the textbooks, to a wide variety of exercises including storytelling, document interpretation, role play, textual or pictorial analysis, and exercises requiring pupils to either find rational explanations of the events or else to empathize with protagonists via letter writing, biographical writing and analysis of protagonists’ decisions. In some cases, exercises simply involve collating information provided in the textbooks (Rwanda) or comparing statistics (Republic of Moldova).&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Specific learning objectives associated with the Holocaust ===
The textbooks testify to a trend towards stating and affirming values such as human rights (in India, Iraq, Namibia, Republic of Moldova and Rwanda, for example) or affirming the role of the United Nations in securing human rights after 1945 (in Brazil, El Salvador, Spain or Uruguay, for example), albeit without explaining the origins, meaning, history, implementation and effectiveness of the principles of human rights. Textbook authors adopt similar approaches by affirming democratic values (as in France, Republic of Moldova, the Russian Federation, South Africa and Uruguay) as a radical alternative to values associated with [[dictatorship]] or [[autocracy]] (El Salvador), while references to citizenship, moral norms, or genocide prevention are rare. No textbooks in our sample address human rights historically.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Didactic links to localities ===
Many textbooks link the Holocaust to local horizons by appealing to pupils to, for example, conduct interviews with Jewish survivors in Shanghai (in a Chinese textbook), explore the rescuing of persecuted people in Albania and compare the motivations of perpetrators in Romania and Germany (Republic of Moldova), or explore local historical and commemorative sites (Germany).

=== National idiosyncrasies ===
All of the textbooks, to varying extents, decontextualize and recontextualize the Holocaust in terms which are alien to the event itself or partial, in a process of (national) appropriation and ‘domestication’. Authors appeal to local readerships, in particular in countries whose populations have no direct experience or inherited memory of the event. These expedient idiosyncrasies are linked largely to the interests of authors writing in the present day within curricular guidelines for identifiable readerships, meaning that textbook representations of the Holocaust may subsume historical information to values or legal and political interests which are largely the product of the situation within and out of which the textbooks are written.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== The Holocaust as a measure of local mass atrocities ===
Some Chinese, Rwandan and South African textbooks radically deviate from western historical perspectives by evoking the Holocaust in sections of textbooks devoted to other examples of persecution or genocide. Chinese textbooks, for example, treat the Holocaust briefly as an example by which to illustrate and measure the extent of the local massacre of 1937 in Nanjing. Experts agree that discussion of the Holocaust among peoples whose countries have only recently experienced mass atrocities, or in which little discussion of the event has hitherto taken place, is an effective way of broaching local persecution indirectly while avoiding the conflict which a direct discussion of the issues might provoke.&lt;ref&gt;Freedman, R. 2014.Engaging with Holocaust education in post-apartheid South Africa in K. Fracapane and M. Haß (eds), 2014, ''Holocaust Education in a Global Context'', UNESCO, Paris, pp. 134-142, 136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xu X. 2014. A new frame to reinterpret China’s past. Holocaust studies in China, K. Fracapane and M. Haß, ''Holocaust Education''. Paris, UNESCO, pp. 143-152, 151.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Nationalizing victimhood in post-communist Europe ===
Belarussian and Russian textbooks generally adhere to the notion that the Second World War involved a violation of national territories. The authors of Belarussian textbooks, for example, refer to ‘the occupied territory’ and to that fact that ‘The territory of Belarus was covered with a network of concentration camps’. Russian textbooks likewise largely displace the Holocaust behind a history of the suppression of Slavs and of Soviet heroism. Textbooks in Albania also appear to uphold the Holocaust as a measure of local heroism by defining the Holocaust as the ‘age of upheaval 1914-1945’ while drawing attention to heroic acts of Albanian citizens who rescued Jews, and to the humanitarian values of hospitality, religious tolerance, [[humanism]] and antifascism. Although Polish textbooks firmly focus on the Polish dimension of the Holocaust by presenting it as an event in Polish history with Polish figureheads and as a consequence of the [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|occupation of Poland]], the books in this sample no longer nationalize victimhood, but render multiple perspectives with meta-historical critiques. However, representations from countries of the former Soviet Union and former members of the [[Warsaw Pact]] do not conform to a uniform pattern. Research has shown that Baltic States traditionally depict a ‘symmetry between Nazi and communist crimes’.&lt;ref&gt;Himka, J.-P. and Michlic, J. 2013. Introduction. J.-P.Himka and J. Michlic (eds), ''Bringing the Dark Past to Light''. Nebraska, Uni. Of Nebraska Press, pp. 1-24, 17f.&lt;/ref&gt; And in Ukraine, the famine known as the Holodomor continues to compete with and even displace representations of the Holocaust, which harbours more ambiguous recollections of both persecution and collaboration among Ukrainian citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Dietsch, J. 2006. ''Making Sense of Suffering. Holocaust and Holodomor in Ukrainian Historical Culture''. Lund, Lund University Press, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Exculpatory appropriation ===
By defining crimes committed during the Holocaust as ‘genocide’ while defining local crimes euphemistically (as ‘cruel acts’, for example), some Japanese textbooks play down the moral and legal repercussions of crimes committed locally. Thus ‘exculpatory interpretations’&lt;ref&gt;J.-B. Shin, 2012, e Second World War in world history textbooks of Korea, China, and Japan, U. Han et al. (eds), ''History Education and Reconciliation. Comparative Perspectives on East Asia'', Frankfurt am Main, Peter Lang, pp. 121-136, 132.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Holocaust may be used as a ‘measure’ or ‘benchmark’&lt;ref&gt;Buettner, A. 2011. ''Holocaust Images and Picturing Catastrophe. The Cultural Politics of Seeing''. Burlington, Ashgate, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; of the putatively relatively minor significance of local persecution, by which attention is detracted from those responsible for comparable crimes.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Borrowed history in a former colony ===
By focusing on French collaboration and resistance rather than deportation, the authors of Ivorian textbooks adopt the viewpoint of, and thereby affirm a degree of loyalty to, the former colonial power. The Ivorian textbook, for example, adopts a ‘French’ reading of the Second World War by emphasizing collaboration and resistance, and by subsuming Jewish victims to the legend of a nation united in resistance which pervaded public perceptions of the role of France during the Second World War until the 1980s.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Political expediency of the Holocaust ===
In extreme cases, textbooks evoke the Holocaust marginally in a history which focuses entirely on the Second World War. One Indian textbook produced during the mandate of the government coalition led by the Left Front, for example, marginalizes the Holocaust in favour of the history of resistance to the Nazi war effort as an analogy to the struggle for Indian independence. Likewise, the total disregard for the Holocaust in another textbook may be ascribed to the fact that its authors appear to sympathize with the nationalist [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) and with its radical nationalism and the goal of territorial unity akin to that of the National Socialists. By contrast, liberal authors present Gandhi’s attempts to negotiate with Hitler in the hope that the regime may abstain from its racial policy.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Generalization and abstraction ===
While no textbooks in the sample overtly question the history of the Holocaust, some present it in partial or abstract terms, such that the reader learns little about the event. A Syrian textbook, for example, refers to the event as ‘conditions of oppression by the Nazis in Europe’; an Iraqi textbook similarly describes the violation of human rights and crimes against humanity committed under the National Socialist regime, but conceptualizes the event in purely legal terms as one which ended once perpetrators had been tried, punished or exculpated by the [[Nuremberg trials|Nuremberg Tribunal]]. Jewish victims of Nazi oppression are named in these textbooks in association with the alleged lack of resolve of the British Mandate to stem Jewish immigration to Palestine.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Selective reductionism ===
South African and Rwandan textbooks are examples of selective narratives which partly reduce the Holocaust to a form of racism, illustrated with images of Hitler and [[Darwinism|Darwin]] side by side, or evoke analogies between life under apartheid and persecution carried out by the National Socialists.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Connection to curricula ==
{{Main|The Holocaust in curricula}}

The Holocaust in curricula discusses the ways in which the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] is presented in secondary school level history and social studies [[Curriculum|curricula]] worldwide. Curricula and textbooks, in particular those designed for history teaching, provide both a space for the formation of a condensed canon of knowledge which is considered to be relevant to a specific society, and a means by which claims to social legitimacy may be made. The study of curricula and textbooks enables the reconstruction of patterns of perception and interpretation, or the standards and values which hold sway at any given time. Moreover, they offer insights into the variety of ways in which national identities are conceived of and constructed.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Curricula and textbooks provide reasonably reliable points of reference for educators. The complexity of the Holocaust and the sensitivity towards the social and political consequences of this event which continues to be felt in the present day mean that teachers are often uncertain about how they should teach the Holocaust. As a result, curricula and in particular textbooks are held by educators to provide secure sources of information and of methods to which teachers refer on the assumption that they provide accurate content and reliable didactic and methodological guidelines, which have been compiled by experienced historians, educational experts and authors.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

'''Total Communication''' ('''TC''') is an approach to [[Deaf education]] that aims to make use of a number of modes of communication such as [[Manual communication|signed]], [[oralism|oral]], auditory, written and visual aids, depending on the particular needs and abilities of the child.

In the UK 'Total Communication' (also known as 'Inclusive Communication') is an approach used, mainly by Speech and Language therapists, to help children and adults with learning disabilities communicate using any mode of communication such as symbols, signing (usually [[Makaton]]), photographs as well as the spoken and written word and gesture.  It has also been found to be useful for those recovering from a stroke or head injury where spoken language is impaired or for people whose language processing is affected, perhaps in old age or through dementia.

Total Communication not only helps deaf children learn to communicate but children who have down syndrome and other learning disabilities where it makes communication hard especially for school aged children and the families who are evolved. 

Total Communication focuses on teaching children special tools to help them communicate better like finger spelling, how to use body language to tell people how you feel, sign language, lip reading and other natural gestures to communicate. Total Communication encourages children to use the little bit of hearing they may have to help make this process work better, with the help of hearing aids and other different kind of implants. Not being able to communicate can be very frustrating, this can cause behavior problems when a child is not able to communicate what her or she needs. 

Total Communication uses both a visual aspect and hearing to help children communicate. When a child is in a classroom setting the teacher and the students may be speaking and using sign language at the same time. This is called simultaneous communication, this form of communication works best in a classroom setting. Teachers who teach these types of classes always emphasize learning the language first. There programs follow the sign language system based on the english system. 

Some things to always remember when using total communcation is that some children may process things at a slower pace, this mean you might have to wait up to 10 seconds to get an answer. The use of yes and no and short answer question are usually the best when asking questions   they only require one answer a yes or no. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.icommunicatetherapy.com/child-speech-language/children-special-needs-learning-difficulties/key-guidelines-creating-total-communication-environment/|title=Key Guidelines to Creating a Total Communication Environment - icommunicate therapy|work=icommunicate therapy|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;Using print like pictures or symbols can also really help children understand what you are trying to say.

To really help a child you need to understand his or her strengths and weaknesses. Cusacke494 

==History==
An approach very similar to Total Communication was developed by David Denton at the [[Maryland School for the Deaf]] in 1967. The term "Total Communication", though, and its specific philosophy, was first used by Roy Holcomb in California.&lt;ref&gt;Holcomb, R. K. (1970). The Total Approach: Beginning and structure. In R. Madebrink (Ed.) (1972). ''Proceedings of the International Congress on Education of the Deaf, Stockholm, 1970.''. Stockholm, Sweden: International Congress on Education of the Deaf, pp. 104-107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nagengast, Larry. (1973) Deafness no handicap to newcomer. ''The Morning News'' (September 4, 1973), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; It was adopted by the Maryland school as the official name for their educational philosophy. TC was supposed to find a middle ground in age-old disputes between [[oralism]] and [[manualism]], and as an alternative to [[Simultaneous Communication]]. In practice, however, most Total Communication programs use some form of Simultaneous Communication.

Total Communication educational programs have been established in the UK, France, U.S., China, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands, France, Germany and elsewhere. In the United States, TC was most popular during the 1970s and 1980s, when most schools and programs for children who are Deaf, as well as most major organizations in the field supported the TC philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ericec.org/digests/e559.html]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310111234/http://ericec.org/digests/e559.html|date=March 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the debate seems to be between TC programs and [[bilingual-bicultural education]].

There is little research concerning that the use of total communication in child centers or his or her own natural environment . But it is considered to be best practiced in early intervention. 

TC's original intent was to provide children with the communication tools needed for children to develop complete language. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hearinglikeme.com/total-communication/|title=How to Use "Total Communication" - Hearing Like Me|date=2016-09-06|work=Hearing Like Me|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;But in later years the philosophy of TC has often been over-simplified and has been confused with simultaneous communication. (found very little research on the confusion) Cusacke494

'''Yousician''' is an interactive [[music education|music service]] to learn and play a [[musical instrument]]. Yousician currently supports [[guitar]], [[piano]], [[ukulele]] and [[bass (instrument)|bass]], [[voice]], and is available on [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Windows]] and [[macOS]] platforms. Yousician analyses the users’ playing on their real musical instruments, and provides them with instant feedback and guidance. Yousician claims to be the world’s largest music educator.&lt;ref name="yousician1"&gt;{{cite web|website=Official website|publisher=Yousician|title=Landing page|url=http://www.about.yousician.com | accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Yousician Ltd. is a [[Helsinki]] based music education company founded  by Chris Thür and Mikko Kaipainen in 2010 under the name Ovelin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lappalainen|first=Elina|title=Tamperelaiselle Ovelinille miljoonasijoitus Piilaaksosta|url=http://www.talouselama.fi/uutiset/tamperelaiselle+ovelinille+miljoonasijoitus+piilaaksosta/a2083000|work=Talouselämä|accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was part of the [[Startup Sauna]] accelerator programme at [[Aalto University]].&lt;ref name="wired1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Geere|first=Duncan|title=WildChords enlists animals to help you learn guitar|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-12/11/wildchords|work=Wired.co.uk|accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yousician states its mission as "Making musicality as common as literacy".&lt;ref name="yousician1"/&gt; The company develops and operates a [[music education|music service]] called Yousician, and a tuner application called GuitarTuna. As of December 2016, Yousician claims over 8 million monthly active users worldwide across their products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Slush Conference|title=5 years after winning Slush100|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIH-Wr2mJWw|website=YouTube|publisher=Slush - official channel|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the company raised $1.4m from [[Silicon Valley]]-based investor True Ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Greg|title=Ovelin Grabs €1.1 Million From True Ventures|url=http://www.arcticstartup.com/2012/02/08/ovelin-true-ventures-seed-funding|work=Arcticstartup.com|accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yousician==
The ''Yousician'' service is built on [[audio signal processing]] technology that can recognize [[Musical note|note]]s and [[chord (music)|chord]]s played by its users on their real instruments (both acoustic and electric).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anssi Klapuri - From Time-Frequency to Time-Pitch Domain: Psychoacoustic vs. Data-Driven Approach|url=http://ccrma.stanford.edu/events/anssi-klapuri-time-frequency-time-pitch-domain-psychoacoustic-vs-data-driven-approach|accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users are shown either a gamified, colourful version of [[sheet music]] or [[tablature]] notation for an exercise, and hear a backing track as they play along. A major criticism of this app is its inability to display correct, standard, black and white music notation.{{Citation needed|reason=No reference to being &amp;#34;major&amp;#34;|date=August 2018}} Using the built-in microphone of the device, Yousician listens to the users play, gives feedback on accuracy and [[timing (music)|timing]], and tracks users’ progress over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Apple Appstore|first1=iTunes|title=App description|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yousician-your-personal-music-teacher/id959883039?mt=8|website=Apple Appstore|publisher=Apple|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Yousician'' is currently available for four [[musical instruments|instruments]]: [[guitar]], [[piano]], [[bass (instrument)|bass]] and [[ukulele]]. For every instrument, Yousician features a [[syllabus]] developed and produced in-house by the company. Syllabi are made up of songs and exercises, [[tutorial]] videos and mini-games to learn new skills. Over all instruments, there are around 150 missions and over 25,000 exercises available. Yousician used to offer a [[user generated content]] platform where users can create their own content via an in-built editor for their own usage, or choose to share it with the community. There are some features available that do not require an instrument, e.g. ear-training or theory practice while people don’t have instruments at hand. Yousician operates under a [[freemium]] model where one lesson per day is given for free, while unlimited lesson time is offered via paid subscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grannell|first=Craig|title=Review: Yousician Guitar Gamifies Learning Chords and Riffs|url=http://www.tapsmart.com/reviews/apps/review-yousician-guitar-gamifies-learning-chords-and-riffs/|work=tapsmart.com|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guitar===
''Yousician for Guitar'' was the first instrument launched on the platform when it was released in November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leier|first=Kendra|title=Unlock the Yousician in you!|url=http://kendraleier.com/2014/10/20/unlock-the-yousician-in-you/|work=kendraleier.com|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The syllabus of guitar is divided into 3 paths: Lead, Rhythm and Knowledge. The standard visualization for guitar is a tablature view, but users can also choose to display songs as sheet music or a hybrid of the two.

===Piano===
''Yousician for Piano'' was the second instrument launched on the platform in November 2015. The syllabus of piano is divided into 3 paths: Classical, Pop and Knowledge. The standard visualization for piano is a simplified version of sheet music, but users can also choose to display songs as traditional sheet music.

===Ukulele===
''Yousician for Ukulele'' was the third instrument launched on the platform in December 2015. The syllabus of ukulele is divided into 3 paths: Lead, Rhythm and Knowledge. The standard visualization for ukulele is a tablature view, but users can also choose to display songs as sheet music or a hybrid of the two.

===Bass===
''Yousician for Bass'' was the fourth instrument launched on the platform in April 2016. The syllabus of bass is divided into 2 paths: Playing and Knowledge. The standard visualization for bass is a tablature view, but users can also choose to display songs as sheet music or a hybrid of the two.

===Voice===
''Yousician for Voice'' was the fifth instrument launched on the platform in August 2018. There's a single path in the syllabus. The visualization is a chromatic staff where notes are represented by bars, comparable to some other singing applications such as ''[[SingStar]]''.

==Yousician for Educators==
''Yousician for Educator''s is a service built on the Yousician platform for [[teachers]] using Yousician with their [[students]], both for in-classroom and for the students to practice at home. Teachers are able to assign and monitor [[homework]] tasks and student progression from the ''Educator Dashboard''. As of February 2017, Yousician claims the service is being used by thousands of teachers around the world. Yousician has a “Distinguished Educators” section featuring teachers that help other teachers to utilize Yousician in their classrooms. Yousician for Educators uses a freemium model for teachers and their students, although they previously had a free model for teachers.

==Reception==
Yousician was released on November 2014, to mostly positive reviews. [[Guitar World]] called it “modern technology’s gift to music education” and in March 2015 it was featured as 'Editor's Choice' in the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[iOS App Store]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Priario|first1=Guitar World|title=Yousician Is a Fast, Fun Way to Learn to Play Guitar|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/yousician-fast-fun-way-learn-play-guitar-video/25427|publisher=Guitar World|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gray|first=Chris|title=Ep 68: Find My iPhone &amp; Spring Ahead|url=http://www.hipcast.com/podcast/HX46Z0T7|work=hipcast.com|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical voices usually do not question the product itself, but contrast it to the option of learning to play an instrument in private [[lessons]]. Voicesinc.org for example stated that “If you’re happy to learn from a digital screnen, then it’s great, but if you want a lot more human interaction and demonstration, there may be some better options.” As of October 2018, the Yousician app had 227,660 ratings on [[Google Play]] with an average 4.5 of the 5-star rating and on the [[iOS App Store]] 10,076 ratings with an average of 4.3 of the 5-stars.

Yousician was featured two times as 'Editor's Choice' in the [[iOS App Store]] and won a "Best of 2016 Apps" award from Google Play. Yousician was one of ''[[Wired UK|Wired's]]'' top 100 European [[Startup company|startups]] in 2012,&lt;ref name="wired2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cheshire|first=Tom|title=Europe's 100 hottest startups 2012: Helsinki|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2012/09/european-startups/helsinki|work=Wired.co.uk|accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were also featured in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' "World's Best Apps List 2012". Yousician and its apps have won several technology and start-up competitions, including [[SXSW]] Accelerator 2012 (Music)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SXSW Music Accelerator 2012 Recap|url=http://sxsw.com/music/startupvillage/accelerator/recap|accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Midem]]lab 2012.

As of July 2018 Yousician has removed all user-generated content, an act some users regard as negating its worth completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yousician User Forums|url=https://yousician.uservoice.com/forums/296820-welcome-to-yousician-feedback-forum/suggestions/34740235-youcisian-used-to-be-good}}&lt;/ref&gt;
