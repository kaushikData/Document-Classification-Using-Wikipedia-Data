'''Adela Constantia Mary Pankhurst Walsh''' (19 June 1885 – 23 May 1961) was a British-Australian [[suffragette]], political organiser, and co-founder of both the [[Communist Party of Australia]] and the [[Australia First Movement]].

==Early life==
Pankhurst was born on 19 June 1885 in [[Manchester]], England, into a politicised family: her father, [[Richard Pankhurst]] was a socialist and candidate for [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], and her mother [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] and sisters [[Sylvia Pankhurst|Sylvia]] and [[Christabel Pankhurst|Christabel]] were leaders of the British suffragette movement. Her mother was of [[Manx people|Manx]] descent.&lt;ref name="bart16"&gt;Bartley, p. 16; Liddington and Norris, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Adela attended the all-woman [[Studley College|Studley Horticultural College]] in Warwickshire, and [[Manchester High School for Girls]]. 

==UK==
As a teenager, Adela became involved in the militant [[Women's Social and Political Union]] founded by her mother and sisters. In November 1909 she joined a protest that disturbed a talk by [[Winston Churchill]] at his constituency in [[Dundee]]. She was arrested along with [[Helen Archdale]] and [[Maud Joachim]].&lt;ref name="spartj"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/WjoachimM.htm|title=Maud Joachim|work=Spartacus Educational|access-date=2018-01-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adela had slapped a policeman who was trying to evict her from the building.

[[Eagle House (suffragette's rest)|Eagle House]] near Bath in Somerset had became an important refuge for [[suffragettes]] who had been released from prison. [[Mary Blathwayt]]'s parents planted trees there between April 1909 and July 1911 to commemorate the achievements of suffragettes including [[Emmeline Pankhurst|Adela's mother]] and [[Christabel Pankhurst|sister, Christabel]] as well as [[Annie Kenney]], [[Charlotte Despard]], [[Millicent Fawcett]] and [[Constance Lytton|Lady Lytton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eagle House |work=Images of England |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=32156 |accessdate=25 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015012822/http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=32156 |archivedate=15 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The trees were known as "Annie's Arboreatum" after Annie Kenney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hammond|first1=Cynthia Imogen|title=Architects, Angels, Activists and the City of Bath, 1765-1965 ": Engaging with Women's Spatial Interventions in Buildings and Landscape|date=2017|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781351576123|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FikxDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT189&amp;lpg=PT189&amp;dq=Eagle+House+Batheaston+John+Wood+Elder&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ckzd5pj4qM&amp;sig=Y4Bbi3HWs5s2toD4kKrXxJS7Yus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQ-orY5JDXAhUBKcAKHS0tDZUQ6AEIMTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Eagle%20House%20Batheaston%20John%20Wood%20Elder&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hannam|first1=June|title=Suffragette Photographs|journal=Regional Historian|date=Winter 2002|issue=8|url=http://www2.uwe.ac.uk/faculties/CAHE/Documents/Research/Regional-history/RH8Hannam.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a "Pankhurst Pond" within the grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of the Week: A Nest of Suffragettes in Somerset|url=https://womanandhersphere.com/2012/09/12/book-of-the-week-a-nest-of-suffragettes-in-somerset/|publisher=Woman and her Sphere|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Adela was invited to Eagle House in 1909 and 1910. She planted a [[Cedrus deodara|Himalayan Cedar]] on 3 July 1910. A plaque was made and her photograph was recorded again by Colonel Linley Blathwayt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bathintime.co.uk/image/249415/blathwayt-col-linley-suffragettes-adela-pankhurst-jessie-and-annie-kenney-1910|title=Suffragettes Adela Pankhurst, Jessie and Annie Kenney 1910, Blathwayt, Col Linley|website=Bath in Time, Images of Bath online|language=en|access-date=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her mother's favourite was Christabel and the two of them took the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] as their own organisation. They fell out with many of their leading volunteers and supporters and this included [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] and Adela. Both of them believed in socialism whereas Emmeline and Chistabel were pushing for the vote for middle class women. Sylvia was ejected from the party and she set up her own splinter group in East London. Christabel is reported to have said to Sylvia "“I would not care if you were multiplied by a hundred, but one of Adela is too many.” Adela was given £20, a ticket to Australia and a letter introducing her to [[Vida Goldstein]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Australia==
Following estrangement from her family, Adela emigrated to Australia in 1914. (Her sister Sylvia created a new life for herself in Ethiopia after the Second World War.) Adela's experience of activism enabled her to be recruited during World War I as an organiser for the [[Women's Peace Army]] in Melbourne by [[Vida Goldstein]].&lt;ref name="os"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/pankhurst-adela-constantia-9275|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=Hogan|first=Susan|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|location=Canberra}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pankhurst wrote a book called ''Put Up the Sword'', penned a number of anti-war pamphlets&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sparrow|first1=Jeff|title='Wayward suffragette' Adela Pankhurst and her remarkable Australian Life|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/dec/24/wayward-suffragette-adela-pankhurst-and-her-remarkable-australian-life|accessdate=9 March 2016|work=The Guardian|date=December 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and addressed public meetings on her opposition to the war and conscription. In August 1917, Pankhurst was arrested during a march against rising food prices in Melbourne, which had been part of a series of sometimes violent demonstrations, unusual for the time in that they were spearheaded by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smart|first1=Judith|title=Feminists, food and the cost of living demonstrations in Melbourne August-September 1917|journal=Labour History|date=May 1986|issue=50|pages=113–131|doi=10.2307/27508786}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1917, she married [[Tom Walsh (trade unionist)|Tom Walsh]] of the [[Federated Seamen's Union of Australasia]], with whom she had a son and five daughters. In 1920, Pankhurst became a founding member of the [[Communist Party of Australia]], from which she was later expelled.

She became disillusioned with communism and founded the anti-communist Australian Women's Guild of Empire in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sparrow|first1=Jeff|title='Wayward suffragette' Adela Pankhurst and her remarkable Australian Life|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/dec/24/wayward-suffragette-adela-pankhurst-and-her-remarkable-australian-life|accessdate=9 March 2016|work=The Guardian|date=December 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941 Pankhurst became one of the founding members of the right wing and nationalistic [[Australia First Movement]]. She visited Japan in 1939, and was arrested and interned in 1942 for her advocacy of peace with Japan.&lt;ref name=os/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6943">The '''Anif declaration''' ({{lang-de|Anifer Erklärung}}) was issued by the [[Kingdom of Bavaria|king of Bavaria]] [[Ludwig III]] on 12 November 1918 at [[Anif Palace]], [[Austria]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archontology.org/nations/german/bavaria/00_1806_1918_s.php Germany: Bavaria: Heads of State: 1806-1918] archontology.org, accessed: 14 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a declaration in which the monarch relieved all civil servants and military personnel from their oath of loyalty to him and ended the 738-year rule of the [[House of Wittelsbach]] in [[Bavaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{BBKL|r/rupprecht_m_l_f|band=22|autor= Manfred Berger|artikel=Rupprecht, Maria Luitpold Ferdinand, Kronprinz von Bayern, Pfalzgraf bei Rhein, Herzog von Bayern, Franken und in Schwaben usw.|spalten=1173-1186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
With the imminent collapse of the [[German Empire]] at the end of the [[First World War]] in November 1918, the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]], like all other states of the Empire, was in a state of transition from [[monarchy]] to [[republic]].

[[Max von Speidel]], [[Minister of War]] in the Bavarian government, under orders from [[Kurt Eisner]], tried to persuade King Ludwig on 10 November (the day before the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice]]) to issue a declaration in which he would release all officers of the [[Bavarian Army]] of their oath. Speidel however arrived at the King's residence at [[Schloss Wildenwart]], near [[Rosenheim]], after Ludwig had already left for Austria.

Ludwig III decided to leave Bavaria temporarily for Austria, and, following an invitation of Ernst Graf von Moy, decided to take up residence at Anif Palace, near [[Salzburg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burgen-austria.com/Archiv.asp?Artikel=Anif burgen.austria.com - Anif] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115220959/http://www.burgen-austria.com/Archiv.asp?Artikel=Anif |date=November 15, 2007 }} (in German) accessed: 14 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; There, he ordered [[Otto Ritter von Dandl]], the last prime minister of the Kingdom of Bavaria,&lt;ref&gt;[http://rzblx2.bibliothek.uni-regensburg.de/blo/boslview/boslview.php?seite=143&amp;band=1 Universitätsbibliothek Regensburg - Bosls bayrische Biographie - Otto Ritter von Dandl] (in German) author: Karl Bosl, publisher: Pustet, page 127.&lt;/ref&gt; to issue a declaration. Dandl demanded an [[abdication]] but the King was only willing to issue a statement absolving all officers, soldiers and government officials of the Kingdom of their oath.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verfassungen.de/de/by/bayern18-index.htm Verfassungsurkunde für das Königreich Bayern - Titel X. Von der Gewähr der Verfassung - § 3] (in German) Bavarian constitution from 26 May 1818, Oath of loyalty for government servant, accessed: 21 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; With this, the Anif declaration, Dandl returned to the Bavarian capital, [[Munich]].

==The declaration==
The original document of the declaration has been lost. It was in the possession of the then interior minister of Bavaria, Erhard Auer, but was lost during the [[Hitler Putsch]] in 1923. Only typed copies exist now, bearing handwritten additions by Kurt Eisner.
{{Verse translation |lang=de

}}

==Publication==
Dandl returned to Munich the same day and the government under Eisner published the declaration as the abdication of Ludwig III. While some, even conservative politicians, shared the government's interpretation of the declaration as an abdication, others pointed out the discrepancy between its wording and its use by the government as a declaration of abdication.

Kurt Eisner had the declaration published word by word with his own below it. In his addition he states that the ''People's State of Bavaria'' ({{lang-de|Volksstaat Bayern|links=no}}) accepts the abdication of King Ludwig III and assures him and his family that they are free to return to Bavaria, like every other citizen, providing they take no steps against the people's state.&lt;ref name="HLB: Thronverzicht König Ludwig III."&gt;[http://www.historisches-lexikon-bayerns.de/document/artikel_44319_bilder_value_1_anifererklaerung3.jpg Historisches lexikon Bayerns - Thronverzicht König Ludwig III.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520030658/http://www.historisches-lexikon-bayerns.de/document/artikel_44319_bilder_value_1_anifererklaerung3.jpg |date=May 20, 2011 }} (in German), accessed: 14 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Ludwig III in 1921, his son, [[Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria]], asserted his rights to the Bavarian crown,&lt;ref name="HLB: Die Wittelsbacher nach 1918"&gt;[http://www.historisches-lexikon-bayerns.de/artikel/artikel_44648 Historisches Lexikon Bayerns - Die Wittelsbacher nach 1918] (in German) accessed: 14 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; claiming it to be his birthright to be King of Bavaria unless the people decided on a different form of government after free elections.&lt;ref name="HLB: Monarchismus"&gt;[http://www.historisches-lexikon-bayerns.de/artikel/artikel_44550 Historisches Lexikon Bayerns - Monarchismus] (in German) accessed: 28 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Until his death in 1955, Rupprecht [[monarchism in Bavaria after 1918|continued to demand]] that the question of whether Bavaria would be a republic or a monarchy should be decided by a [[constituent assembly]] chosen in a democratic election.&lt;ref name="HLB: Monarchismus"/&gt;

'''Argentine Brazilians''' ({{lang-pt|Argentino-brasileiro}}, Spanish: ''Argentino-brasileño'', Rioplatense Spanish: ''Argentino-brasilero'') are [[Brazil]]ian citizens of full, partial, or predominantly [[Argentina|Argentine]] ancestry, or an Argentine-born person residing in Brazil.
 
After gaining its independence from [[Spain]] in the early 19th century, Argentina adopted an open [[immigration]] policy and encouraged immigrants to embrace the country as their own. For a short period at the end of the 1880s, the government went so far as to subsidize [[immigrant]] boat passages. It is estimated that the country received over seven million immigrants, predominantly from [[Spain]] and [[Italy]], between 1870 and 1930. 

[[Argentina]] proved attractive to many [[Alien (law)|foreigners]] confronted with harsh economic conditions in [[Europe]], they were drawn by the appeal of the [[New World]] and an underpopulated country rich in natural resources and employment prospects ranging from [[agriculture]] to [[factory]] [[Wage labour|work]] that made the country an immigrant destination. Since then, argentine emigration is low compared to other Latin American countries something that is similar to [[brazilian emigration]] situation.

==History==
Argentina is a [[multiethnic society]], which means that it is home to people of many different ethnic backgrounds. Argentina is, along with other areas of new settlement like the [[Demography of the United States|United States]], [[Demography of Canada|Canada]], [[Demography of Australia|Australia]], or [[Demography of Brazil|Brazil]], a [[melting pot]] of different peoples.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Enrique Oteiza]] and [[Susana Novick]] maintain that "Argentina since the 19th century has become, as have Australia, Canada and USA, a 'land of immigrants', meaning a society formed by massive immigration from a minute native population". (Oteiza, Enrique; Novick, Susana. [http://www.iigg.fsoc.uba.ar/pobmigra/archivos/rc31.pdf ''Inmigración y derechos humanos. Política y discursos en el tramo final del menemismo''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531184634/http://www.iigg.fsoc.uba.ar/pobmigra/archivos/rc31.pdf |date=31 May 2011 }}. [en línea&amp;#93;. Buenos Aires: Instituto de Investigaciones Gino Germani, Facultad de Ciencias Sociales, [[Universidad de Buenos Aires]], 2000 [Citado FECHA&amp;#93;. (IIGG Documentos de Trabajo, Nº 14). Available on: http://www.iigg.fsoc.uba.ar/docs/dt/dt14.pdf{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }})]; "The Brazilian anthropologist [[Darcy Ribeiro]] places Argentina in a group of 'transplanted countries' with Uruguay, Canada, and United States.  (Ribeiro, Darcy. ''Las Américas y la Civilización'' (1985). Buenos Aires: [[:es:Editorial Universitaria de Buenos Aires|EUDEBA]], pp. 449 ss.); The Argentine historian [[José Luis Romero (historiador)|José Luis Romero]]  defines Argentina as a 'flood country'". (Romero, José Luis. «Indicación sobre la situación de las masas en Argentina (1951)», en ''La experiencia argentina y otros ensayos'', Buenos Aires: [[Universidad de Belgrano]], 1980, p. 64). {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-19th century a large wave of immigration started to arrive in Argentina due to new Constitutional policies that encouraged immigration, and issues in the countries the immigrants came from such as wars, poverty, hunger, famines, pursuit of a better life, among other reasons. The main immigration sources were from Europe, the countries from the [[Near East|Near]] and Middle East, Russia and Japan. Eventually Argentina became the second country that received the most immigrants in the world, only second to the United States.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Therefore, most Argentines are of European descent, and are either descendants of colonial-era settlers and/or of the 19th and 20th century [[Great European immigration wave to Argentina|immigrants from Europe]], with about 86% of the population being of ethnic [[European ethnic groups|European]] descent.&lt;ref name="worldstatesmen argentina"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Argentina.html|title=Argentina, at worldstatesmen.org|publisher=|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common ethnic groups are [[Italian Argentine|Italian]] and [[Spanish Argentine|Spanish]] (including [[Galician people|Galicians]] and [[Basque people|Basques]]). It is estimated that up to 25 million Argentines, up to 60% of the total population, have Italian ancestry, wholly or in part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igougo.com/travelcontent/Journal.aspx?JournalID=52009#1214518|title=Travelocity Travel: Vacations, Cheap Flights, Airline Tickets &amp; Airfares|publisher=|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also [[Germanic people|Germanic]], [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]], British and French populations.&lt;ref name=ecpi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indec.gov.ar/webcenso/ECPI/index_ecpi.asp|title=INDEC|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller [[Jewish]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native]], [[Arab peoples|Arab]], [[Asian people|Asian]], [[Romani people|Gypsy]] and [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] communities contribute to the melting pot.

Recent decades immigration includes mainly [[Paraguayans]], [[Bolivians]] and [[Peruvians]], among other [[Latin Americans]], Eastern Europeans, Africans and Asians.&lt;ref name=lastdecade&gt;{{cite news|title=En la última década se radicaron en el país 800.000 extranjeros|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1727640-en-la-ultima-decada-se-radicaron-en-el-pais-800000-extranjeros|newspaper=[[La Nación]] |language=Spanish |date=16 September 2014 |accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caref.org.ar/texto/europa_del_este.pdf Comisión de apoyo a refugiados y migrantes (CAREF): Los migrantes de Europa del Este y Central en el Área Metropolitana 1999-2002] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003071328/http://www.caref.org.ar/texto/europa_del_este.pdf |date=2013-10-03 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the economic recovery that occurred between 2003 and 2011, the 2010 census showed that the country once again became a country of immigration with an increase in total numbers and in percentage of resident foreigners. It is estimated that in 2018 there are more than 2 million immigrants residing in the country, from 1.8 million registered in 2010. It is the country of Latin America with the highest number of total immigrants and the second with the highest percentage of immigrants over the total number of immigrants population.

According to the {{census-ar|2010}}, Argentina had a population of 40,091,359 inhabitants, of which 1,805,957 or 4.6%, were born abroad. The country has long had one of Latin America's lowest [[population growth rate|growth rates]], estimated in 2008 to be 0.917% annually, with a birth rate of 16.32 live births per 1,000 inhabitants and a mortality rate of 7.54 deaths per 1,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Strikingly, though, its fertility rate is still nearly twice as high (2.3 children per woman) as that in Spain or Italy, despite comparable religiosity figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prb.org/pdf09/09wpds_eng.pdf|title=PRB|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''UN Demographic Yearbook, 2007''&lt;/ref&gt; The median age is approximately 30 years and [[life expectancy]] at birth is 76 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Life expectancy at birth, total (years) {{!}} Data {{!}} Table|url = http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN|website = data.worldbank.org|access-date = 2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Argentine people in the world==
Most Argentines outside Argentina are people who have migrated from the middle and upper middle classes. According to official estimates there are 600,000 worldwide Argentine, according to estimates by the [[International Organization for Migration]] are about 806,369 since 2001. It is estimated that their descendants would be around 1,900,000. The first wave of emigration occurred during the military dictatorship between 1976 and 1983, with principally to Spain, USA, Mexico and Venezuela. During the 1990s, due to the abolition of visas between Argentina and the United States, thousands of Argentines emigrated to the North American country. The last major wave of emigration occurred during the 2001 crisis, mainly to Europe, especially Spain, although there was also an increase in emigration to neighboring countries, particularly Brazil, Chile and Paraguay.

The language of the ancient kingdom of [[Baekje]] (18 BCE – 660 CE), one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, was a Koreanic language, related to [[Goguryeo language]] and [[Silla language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bellwood|first1=Peter|title=The Global Prehistory of Human Migration|date=2013|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden|isbn=9781118970591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Baekje was established by immigrants from [[Goguryeo]] (the Buyeo-Baekje / Puyo-Paekche), it is presumed that they spoke the [[Goguryeo language]], and several attested words support this idea; however, even if that is true, the indigenous [[Samhan]] people (Han-Baekje) spoke [[Han languages|Han language]].&lt;ref name="Indiana"&gt; 2014. Multitree: A digital library of language relationships. Bloomington, IN: Department of Linguistics, The LINGUIST List, Indiana University. http://multitree.org/.&lt;/ref&gt; or if the attested material may be a mix of Goguryeo and Samhan. The [[Gaya confederacy]], however, was founded by one of the Samhan [[tribe]]s, so it's possible that the Han-Baekje language was related to [[Gaya language|Gaya]]; it may be then that Buyeo-Baekje was related to [[Buyeo languages]], and Han-Baekje to [[Han languages]],&lt;ref name="Indiana"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which was a branch of the ancient [[Koreanic languages]].&lt;ref name="Indiana"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The World's Major Languages": Edition 2.

The '''Bhutia''' བོད་རིགས ({{lang-sip|Drenjongpa / Drenjop}} ; {{bo|t=འབྲས་ལྗོངས་པ་|w='Bras-ljongs-pa}}; "inhabitants of Sikkim"; in [[Bhutan]]: ''Dukpa'') are a community of people of [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] ancestry, who speak Lhopo or [[Sikkimese language|Sikkimese]], a [[Tibetan languages|Tibetan dialect]] fairly mutually intelligible with [[standard Tibetan]]. In 2001, the Bhutia numbered around 70,300. Bhutia here refers to Sikkimese of Tibetan ancestry; in contrast, the [[Bhotiya]] are a larger family of related Tibetan peoples in northeastern [[Nepal]] of which the Bhutia are one member group.

==Language==

The language spoken by the Bhutias in Sikkim is [[Sikkimese language|Sikkimese]], which is 85% mutually intelligible with Tibetan and [[Dzongkha]], the language of Bhutan. Most Bhutias practice the [[Nyingma]] school, followed by the [[Kagyu]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. The Bhutias are spread out over [[Nepal]], [[Bhutan]], and in northern [[West Bengal]], especially in the towns of [[Kalimpong]] and [[Darjeeling]].

==History==
{{main|History of Sikkim}}
The ancestors of the Bhutia migrated from [[Tibet]] to north eastern [[Nepal]], [[Sikkim]], [[Darjeeling]], [[Kalimpong]], and other parts of modern-day [[Nepal]],  [[India]] and [[Bhutan]]. They migrated through the different passes ("La" in Tibetan means "hill") in the [[Himalayas]]. Geographical indications in the name of Bhutias' last names are common. In Northern Sikkim, for example, where the Bhutias are the majority inhabitants, they are known as the Lachenpas or Lachungpas, meaning inhabitants of Lachen ({{bo|t=ལ་ཆེན་}}; "big pass") or Lachung ({{bo|t=ལ་ཆུང་}}; "small pass") respectively.

Bhutia aristocrats were called ''Kazis'' after similar landlord titles in neighboring regions, especially in modern-day [[Bangladesh]]. This feudal system was an integral part of the [[Chogyal]] monarchy prior to 1975, when Sikkim was an independent monarchy; the ruling dynasty of the [[Kingdom of Sikkim]] before the mid-1970s plebiscite was the Bhutia [[Chogyal|Namgyal]] dynasty. Among the Bhutias, the Lachenpas and Lachungpas have their own traditional legal system called the "Dzumsa" which means ''the meeting place of the people''. The Dzumsa is headed by the village headman known as the ''Pipon''. People of [[North Sikkim]] have been given full protection by the state government by deeming a status of Panchayat ward and the Pipon, a status of Panchayat head.

==Clothing==
The traditional outfit of Bhutias is the ''[[Kho (costume)|bakhu]]'' (similar to the Tibetan [[chuba]], but sleeveless), which is a loose cloak type garment fastened at the neck on one side and near the waist with a silk/cotton belt. Male members array the bakhu with loose trousers. Womenfolk wear the bakhu with a silken full sleeve blouse called a ''honju''; a loose gown type garment fastened tight near the waist with a belt. In the front portion, a loose sheet of multicolored woolen cloth with exotic geometric designs is tied. This is called the ''pangden'' and is a symbol of a married woman. This traditional outfit is complemented by embroidered leather boots worn by both men and women.

Bhutia women enjoy a much higher status than their counterparts from other communities. Both women and men have a weakness for gold in its purest form and, traditional jewelry is mostly made of 24 carat (100%) gold.

==Society==
In Sikkim, the Bhutias are mostly employed in the government sector, in agriculture, and increasingly in the business arena as well. In the district of Darjeeling, Bhutias are often employed in government and commerce. Bhutias practise intermarriage within their [[clan]]s and follow a very hierarchical system of bride and groom selection. Clan discrimination is widespread, and marriage outside the community is looked down upon.

==Religion==

[[File:Buddhist Monastery in Darjeeling, 1870.jpg|thumb|Buddhist Monastery in Darjeeling, 1870]]

The Bhutias are followers of [[Vajrayana Buddhism]], mainly the [[Nyingma]] and [[Kagyu]] schools. The main festivals observed by them are [[Losar]] and Losoong. The first week of February is usually the time of [[Losar]] as it marks the start of the Tibetan New Year. Fire dances are common in the evenings during Losar. Losoong is usually celebrated as the end of the Tibetan year and falls at the end of the tenth Tibetan lunar month (usually December). It is the most important festival among the Bhutias in India, and is marked by the traditional Chaan dancing and merry-making. Losoong is celebrated across the monasteries in Bhutan, Nepal and India. In Sikkim, during the festival of Losoong, often dance forms depict narrativized tales from the life of [[Padmasambhava]] or Guru Ugyen.

Monasteries of the Bhutias dot various places in India, most notably the [[Rumtek Monastery]] in Sikkim and the [[Bhutia Busty Monastery]] or Karma Dorjee Chyoling Monastery, which is also the oldest Monastery in Darjeeling.

=== Hindu Bhutia ===
Bhutia is also the surname of [[Marwari people]] of [[Brahmin]] caste. They worship deity [[Ramdev Pir]], [[Khatushyam]] &amp; [[Salasar Balaji]] as [[Ishta-deva]].

==Houses==
A traditional Bhutia house is called a "khim" and is usually rectangular.

The Bhutias have a stone structure outside the house which is used for burning incense. It is called "sangbum." "Sang" means incense and "bum" means vase; the shape of the structure is like a vase. It is used for burning sang, a sacred offering to the deities. The deities are offered scented dried leaves/stalks of rhododendron anthopogon, juniperus recurva, rhododendron setosum or incense sticks made of pine.

==Cuisine==

Bhutia people traditionally eat rice with animal-fat-fried vegetables or meat, usually pork or beef, and occasionally mutton or chicken. Other well-known foods are [[Momo (dumpling)|momo]], steamed meat dumplings, and the ''thukpa'', noodles in broth. The [[Losar]] and Loosong are two among many festivals celebrated by the Bhutia community. Almost all Bhutia festivals and holidays hold Buddhist religious significance. They are also known to utilize over 70 species of animal, fungi, and plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=O'Neill |first1=Alexander |display-authors=etal |date=2017-03-29 |title=Integrating ethnobiological knowledge into biodiversity conservation in the Eastern Himalayas |url=https://ethnobiomed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13002-017-0148-9 |dead-url= |journal=Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine |volume=13 |issue=21 |pages= |doi=10.1186/s13002-017-0148-9 |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=2017-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chhaang]] is the favourite drink of the Bhutias, and increasingly of other communities coexisting with the Bhutias. It is made of fermented barley or millet, and served in a [[bamboo]] container called the ''Tongba''. [[Tea]] with milk and sugar, and butter tea, are also served on religious or social occasions.

==Status within India==

Within the Dominion of India, the Bhutias as recognized as [[Scheduled Tribes]] in the states of Sikkim, West Bengal and [[Tripura]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State/Union Territory-wise list of Scheduled Tribes in India|url=http://tribal.nic.in/content/list%20of%20scheduled%20tribes%20in%20India.aspx|website=Ministry of Tribal Affairs, GOI|accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 26, 2015, during her visit to Darjeeling, the [[Mamata Banerjee]] led West Bengal Government, announced the formation of a separate development board for the Bhutia community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Now, Mamata announces a Bhutia dev board|url=https://www.thestatesman.com/bengal/now-mamata-announces-a-bhutia-dev-board-85213.html |accessdate=2015-09-19|publisher=The Statesman, Kolkata}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Butonese''' (sometimes '''Butuni''', '''Butung''' or '''Wolio''') people is a generic term that embraces a number of sub-ethnic groups from [[Buton]] and its neighbouring islands in [[Southeast Sulawesi]]. Often at times the [[Bajau people]] are mislabeled as Butonese people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Natasha Stacey|title=Boats to Burn: Bajo Fishing Activity in the Australian Fishing Zone|year=2007|publisher=ANU E Press|isbn=1-920942-95-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Butonese are also referred to as '''Orang Burung''', which literally means "bird people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Timothy J. O'Leary|title=Encyclopedia of world cultures: North America, Volume 1|year=1991|publisher=Hall|isbn=978-0-8168-8840-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just like most tribes in Sulawesi, the Butonese people are also seafarers and traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Aris Ananta|title=The Indonesian Crisis: A Human Development Perspective|year=2002|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|isbn=981-230-171-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Butonese people have long since migrated to all corners of the Malay archipelago using smaller vessels ranging from those that can only accommodate five people to large boats that can hold up to about 150 tons of goods. In general, the Butonese is a community that inhabits the region of the Buton Sultanate. When the ''swapraja'' (self-governance, created by the Dutch colonial government) domain was abolished, so did the Buton Sultanate also ended in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brigitta Hauser-Schäublin|title=Adat and Indigeneity in Indonesia: Culture and Entitlements between Heteronomy and Self-Ascription Göttingen Studies in Cultural|year=2013|publisher=Universitätsverlag Göttingen|isbn=3-86395-132-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those regions have now changed to several regencies and cities in [[Southeast Sulawesi]]. Among them are [[Bau-Bau|Baubau City]], [[Buton Regency]], [[South Buton Regency]], [[Central Buton Regency]], [[North Buton Regency]], [[Wakatobi Regency]] and [[Bombana Regency]].

Apart from being a community of seafarers, the Butonese people are also familiar with agriculture in earlier times. Commodities that are planted include paddy, corn, cassava, sweet potatoes, cotton, coconut, betel, pineapple, banana, and all other common needs of their everyday lives. Butonese people are well known for their culture and until today it can still be seen in regions of the Buton Sultanate. Such as the fortress of the Butonese palace which is the largest fortress in the world, the Malige Palace which is a traditional Butonese house that stands firmly as high as four stories without using a single nail,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.wisatamelayu.com/en/tour/569-Malige-palace/navgeo |title=Malige palace |publisher=Wisata Melayu |accessdate=2015-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the currency of the Buton Sultanate called ''kampua'' or ''bida'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Museum Nasional (Indonesia)|title=Perjalanan Sejarah Dan Budaya Bangsa Indonesia: Koleksi Pilihan Museum Nasional|year=1995|publisher=Proyek Pembinaan Museum Nasional|oclc=34973488}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many more.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12541">'''Children in jail in the Philippines''' is a significant problem. According to [[Amnesty International]], over 50,000 children in the [[Philippines]] have been arrested and detained since 1995. [[Torture]], [[rape]] and other forms of cruel and inhumane treatment are a part of everyday life for those children while they're incarcerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0508/10/i_ins.01.html |title=CNN.com - Transcripts |date=10 August 2005 |newspaper=CNN |accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most are charged with minor crimes, such as petty theft, sniffing solvents and [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]].&lt;ref name="unicef.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/philippines_30525.html |title=UNICEF - At a glance: Philippines - Philippines Senate action builds hope for children in jail |first=Sabine |last=Dolan |date=25 May 2012 |website=UNICEF |accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and statistics==
By 2001, jailed children in the Philippines was attracting international media attention. The Australian government-owned television network, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], ran a documentary on the issue in which it stated that children as young as eight are being held in adult prisons in the Philippines in contravention of international statutes and the country’s own laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/stories/s516102.htm |title=Foreign Correspondent - 03/04/2002: The Philippines - Child Prisoners |first=Kylie |last=Grey |date=4 March 2002 |newspaper=ABC |accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005, it was estimated that over 4,000 children were in jails and detention centers all over the country &amp;mdash; many of them mixed with adults.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;

Another estimate states there are an estimated 20,000 children in prison in the Philippines throughout a single year.&lt;ref name="crin.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crin.org/resources/infoDetail.asp?ID=5961 |title=PHILIPPINES: Jailed Children are the Victims of World Poverty |date=28 July 2005 |publisher=Preda Foundation |website=CRIN |accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By May 6, 2005, it was estimated there were 2,100 children in jails across the Philippines, 20 of them on death row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.handsoffcain.info/archivio_news/200505.php?iddocumento=7107436&amp;mover=2 |title=THE PHILIPPINES. 2,100 CHILDREN IN JAIL, 20 ON DEATH ROW |date=6 May 2005 |website=HANDS OFF CAIN against death penalty in the world |accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Getting information on children in jail is difficult. "No one knows what goes on inside of prisons because no one is allowed in," Father Cullen said during an interview with the ''Western Catholic Reporter'', the official newspaper of the Archdiocese of Edmonton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=24145 |title=CCN/Western Catholic Reporter: Catholic priest challenges abuse of Philippine children - Catholic Online |website=Catholic Online |first=Bill |last=Glen |date=18 May 2007 |accessdate=13 February 2014 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140222001210/http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=24145 |archivedate = 22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
[[UNICEF]] is a member of the Juvenile Justice Network-Philippines (JJNP), a broad coalition of government agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) responsible for groundwork on the landmark child protection law.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt; Since the Juvenile Justice and Welfare Law (Republic Act 9344) was enacted in 2006, there has been improvements, and some children are referred to welfare homes bypassing the jail.&lt;ref name="MNLT"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2007/may/13/yehey/opinion/20070513opi4.html |title=The Manila Times Internet Edition &amp;#124; OPINION &gt; Children in jail still need saving |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012140116/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2007/may/13/yehey/opinion/20070513opi4.html |first=Shay |last=Cullen |date=13 May 2007 |archivedate=12 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jailing of children in the Philippines is routine despite the fact that is forbidden by Philippine laws such as the Special Child Protection Act (RA 7610 Article VI[10][a]), the Presidential Decree 603 and RA 9344. The abusive practice, detrimental and dangerous to the child, is forbidden by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Article 10[2][b]) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (Article 37[c]).&lt;ref name="MNLT"/&gt;

==The child victims==
Amnesty International stated that Filipino children who come into conflict with the law are often from [[marginalized]] groups including street youth, drug users, and those with interrupted education, who have limited access to the family and societal structures meant to protect them. These children straddle the child and adult worlds and, in some ways, get the worst of each. Even before arrest, children who come into conflict with the law tend to represent the most disadvantaged and marginalized sectors of society. Many are fleeing difficult home situations, often exacerbated by abuse and poverty and resulting in an interrupted education.&lt;ref name="DL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA350072003?open&amp;of=ENG-PHL |title=Philippines: A different childhood: the apprehension and detention of child suspects and offenders &amp;#124; Amnesty International |website=Amnesty International |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105191617/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA350072003?open&amp;of=ENG-PHL |archivedate=November 5, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corruption==
Children are often jailed for things such as playing cards on a sidewalk and held there until their family can pay off a bribe to corrupt police.

==Indiscriminate 'rescue' operations==
In response to widespread criticism of the government's often violent and harmful clean-up exercises, government officials in Metro Manila committed to a new initiative of 'rescuing' abused, neglected and exploited street children, placing them in shelters where they were said to be provided with food, medical care, education and protection. However, a 2009 report jointly published by Bahay Tuluyan and UNICEF reported that most ‘rescued’ street children comment that not only were they taken involuntarily and with violence, the conditions in the shelters to which they are taken are extremely poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20091117-236861/Rescued-Filipino-street-kids-still-abused |title=Rescued Filipino street kids still abused |first=Philip |last=Tubeza |publisher=United Nations |newspaper=Inquirer News |accessdate=13 February 2014 |date=17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charities==
A number of charities are active in helping children in jail in the Philippines.

[[Preda Foundation]] visits the jails on a regular basis and hands out food and medicines.&lt;ref name="preda.org"/&gt;

Jubilee have been active in gathering evidence and gave testimony to the [[Congressional Human Rights Caucus]] on the subject of children in prison in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jubileeaction.co.uk/campaigns/kbb/kbb.html |title=Jubilee Action - bringing hope, changing lives |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820050359/http://www.jubileeaction.co.uk/campaigns/kbb/kbb.html |archivedate=20 August 2008 |website=Jubilee Action |accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kids Go Free was formed to advocate for children in conflict with the law. Based on research in the Philippines the group is concerned with the situation of children in jail worldwide. The website{{which?|date=December 2014}} aims to raise awareness of this global problem and includes a forum.

==Conditions in Angeles Jail==
Children in Angeles Jail are detained in a small (3 meters by 7 meters approx) unventilated concrete cell. There is no window in the cell, and the minors have no access to an electric fan (which many of the adult cells have and which is necessary in the constant oppressive heat). The children's cell is in a block containing over 100 convicted adult prisoners. The same cell is always used to house children regardless of the number in the jail. Reports from adult inmates indicate that the same cell was used for up to 15 children at a time. There is no bedding or basic sanitary items supplied by the jail. There is a separated concrete cubicle in the corner of the cell with a toilet. The children are not given any change of clothes and commonly wear rags. There have been reports of a hepatitis and TB epidemic in the jail. The children have a maximum one-hour a day of exercise. They have to request this each day. Children report being underfed and hungry. There is little effort made to rehabilitate the children who report visits from a social worker on average less than once a month.&lt;ref name="DL"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.preda.org/work/child%20rescue/minreport.html |title=Preda Foundation, Inc.

Conditions in the jail may amount to torture, inhuman, degrading treatment of the children. Children are often sexually abused by adult inmates or prison authorities and are sold as prostitutes. Children have been detained at Angeles District Jail, Angeles City, for months without charges, legal counsel or any regard for their legal rights. No arrest warrants were issued at the time of their arrest and no court order was given for their detention. None of these children has been provided with competent legal counsel, as required by Philippine law.&lt;ref name="DL"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.preda.org/work/child%20rescue/minreport.html |title=Preda Foundation, Inc.

This issue contributes to '''Chinese luxury shopping behaviour''' regarded to the basic aspects of luxury industry. This work offers further information about the history of fashion and luxury goods market in different part of the continent focusing more on Chinese market. We can get closer to this field of social aspect highlighting Chinese middle class luxury shopping behaviour and gain more information from the field of luxuries.

==Luxury goods and luxury market==

The term luxury comes from the Latin ´luxuria´, which means the ´extras of life´.&lt;ref&gt;Zhan, L. (2012). Understanding luxury consumption in China: Consumer perceptions of best-known brands. Journal of business research: JBR, Elsevier, ISSN 0148-2963, ZDB-ID 1897731. - Vol. 65.2012, 10, p. 1452-1460 [ONLINE] Available at:http://homepage.fudan.edu.cn/heyanqun/files/2013/12/JBR.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of luxury goods refers to have expensive, exclusive goods. Those goods often enjoy high brand perceived quality, and are characterised by high price, superb quality, aesthetic design, heritage, reputation, exclusivity, desirability, personality. Luxuries are objects that provide positional status in society.

==History of fashion and luxury goods industry in the West==

The modern luxury fashion industry originated in France when Charles Frederick Worth arrived in Paris and invented haute couture. The emerging clothing identity was pivotal for the development of luxury goods in the 19c.The success of an haute couture house depended on the talent of a designer who owned the house and who produced made-to-order clothes for aristocracy and upper class. The social groups wanted to reflect wealth and social status. In the 19th century the industrialization of Europe gave rise to luxury brands, many of which are still existing today, such as Louis Vuitton (1854).&lt;ref&gt;Zhan, L. (2012). Understanding luxury consumption in China: Consumer perceptions of best-known brands. Journal of business research: JBR, Elsevier, ISSN 0148-2963, ZDB-ID 1897731. - Vol. 65.2012, 10, p. 1452-1460 [ONLINE] Available at:http://homepage.fudan.edu.cn/heyanqun/files/2013/12/JBR.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  From the late 1960s, Italian and American luxury fashion companies entered in the market providing ready-to-wear clothes instead of traditional made-to-order ones which replaced in many ways the function of haute couture houses. 
Nowadays the purchase and the use of luxury goods has a big role to exhibit personal and social identity through independent style rather than single brands. Consumers are more au demanding, heterogeneous and sophisticated. On global scale, they increase choices in luxury products, shopping channels, and price levels.

==The luxury goods industry==

Luxury goods companies are trying to improve their competitiveness with expanding their market geographically. They are oriented towards markets such as [[China]], which currently is the biggest market for luxury and prestige brands from the Western industries.  The number of Chinese consumers who can afford luxury goods is about 1.3billion (2012).&lt;ref&gt;Zhan, L. (2012) ibid., p.21-22&lt;/ref&gt;  Chinese consumers are increasingly brand aware, and they intend to invest in luxury fashion brands.

==China and luxury goods consumption==

Luxury goods companies have to cope with the challenge of cultural and purchasing power differences in China. According to Wong and Ahuvia: ´´The Western rationality inherent in most consumer theories needs to be reinterpreted through the eyes of Eastern reality" (Wong &amp; Ahuvia, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;436).&lt;ref&gt;Zhan, L. (2012) ibid.,  p.23&lt;/ref&gt; 
China is culturally a collectivist country, and identities are often described as Confucian collectivism which emphases the social relationship and group welfare over individual needs. Chinese consumers are concerned with positional value consumption in their luxury fashion brand purchasing behaviour. They perceive and pursue comprehensive values associated with luxury fashion brands. Chinese consumers put more emphasis on social value brands compared with other countries. They often use material possessions and brand names to reinforce their social identity. Luxury goods are their social tools to increase distance from other social groups and to identify with peers of same social status. However personal cultural orientations can be influenced by age, social class, education and travel.&lt;ref&gt;Zhan, L. (2012) ibid.,  p.42-43&lt;/ref&gt; Western luxury goods companies, when entering China, should also take into consideration the Chinese multidimensional cultural orientation (heterogeneity of Chinese consumers).
When cultural meanings of a luxury brand are consistent with one's cultural orientation, the consumer is more likely to form positive beliefs about and attitude towards purchasing the specific brand resulting in higher purchases. Chinese consumers are the most influenced by word-of mouth strategy when buying new goods. According to some research, collectivist consumers are likely to pay more attention to interpersonal effects of purchasing goods whereas individualist are more likely to consider the personal dimension of purchasing luxury goods, and whereas collectivist consumers tend to comply with social pressure,  individualist consumers are less affected by the influence of reference groups.&lt;ref&gt;Zhan, L. (2012) ibid.,  p.150-152;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chinese luxury fashion brand consumer behavior (middle classes)==

With a fast growing economy and a massive population, China managed to become the most attractive markets for luxury brands in the world. The growing middle-class group in China is a main engine for luxury businesses. Increased buying power and following the trend of shopping in high quality and branding goods make these people willing to purchase mid to high end luxury products .&lt;ref&gt;Zhan, L. (2012). Understanding luxury consumption in China: Consumer perceptions of best-known brands. Journal of business research: JBR, Elsevier, ISSN 0148-2963, ZDB-ID 1897731. - Vol. 65.2012, 10, p. 1452-1460 [ONLINE] Available at:http://homepage.fudan.edu.cn/heyanqun/files/2013/12/JBR.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the lack of knowledge Middle-class consumers in China buy luxury products under the recommendations of experts in the fashion industry. For Chinese people luxuries are still very much a ´fetish´ from ´abroad´.  Many people buy luxuries in order to show off, and people consider each other very much on the appearance and just by the first glance .&lt;ref&gt;Ma, D. (2010) ‘Luxury Shopping Behaviour of Chinese Consumers’ [ONLINE] Available at:{{cite web |url=http://www.ceibs.edu/images/bmt/research/2012/02/08/AE1B40615F8503B5E933FA1E981D18D0.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923202016/http://www.ceibs.edu/images/bmt/research/2012/02/08/AE1B40615F8503B5E933FA1E981D18D0.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chinese people seem to purchase luxury goods to good fortune, and apparat to stren the positional value of luxury rather than personal hedonism.

Chinese middle-class consumers perceive luxury brands as highly valuable possessions, and they primarily use them as a tool to meet the social expectations of important reference groups .&lt;ref&gt;Jaffrelot, Ch &amp; van der Veer, P (eds) 2008, Patterns of middle class consumption in India and China, Sage Publication India Pvt Ltd, India. Available at: https://books.google.com/books?hl=sk&amp;lr=&amp;id=kuKGAwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=chinese+middle+class+consumption&amp;ots=lfSSVnvIoh&amp;sig=YlSc5E7lOmMrS2cF5i9uiVaFQM4&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=chinese%20middle%20class%20consumption&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; The best-known luxury brands are no good options for consumers who want to express their own uniqueness, probably due to the popularity of the brands.
Chinese middle-class consumers are not perceived as extravagant shoppers but they prefer to buy products that will provide them with a social status.  This trend also explains why Chinese consumers constitute a fast-growing market for luxury products at the same time that they save a much higher percentage of their incomes than their counterparts in other countries.
Due to their culture Value Consciousness and Susceptibility to Normative influence played a crucial role luxury brands and Chinese Middle-class consumers. Those to elements helped Companies to communicate with target consumers and build marketing strategies to position a luxury brand in China.  For example, a common positioning strategy used by established luxury brands in China is to place an emphasis on superior product.&lt;ref&gt;Atsmon Y. &amp; Dixit V. (2009), Understanding China's wealthy, McKinsey Q (4):32–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the lack of knowledge of Chinese consumers this strategy may have worked successfully but companies are trying to focus on the ways in which the brands can help consumers accomplish their social goals. Luxury brands in China need to highlight the social meanings of their products and clearly communicate how their products can benefit consumers in important social situations and connect them with desirable social groups.

==The most famous luxury brand categories according to Chinese consumers==
China is set to become the second biggest consumer of luxury goods by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://red-luxury.com/brands-retail/the-most-popular-luxury-brands-in-china&lt;/ref&gt;
Hatssmon Y. &amp; Dixit V. (2009), Understanding China's wealthy, McKinsey Q (4):32–3.eavily influenced by fashion advertising and magazines for over two decades, wealthy Chinese consumers are no longer naïve admirers of just any big logos. They have developed their favourite luxury retailers. 
The top luxury brands favoured by Chinese consumers:

=== Fashion ===
#  Chanel, Saint Laurent, Dior, Bally 
#  [[Louis Vuitton]]: Vuitton is probably the most recognized luxury brand in China. Not as popular among the fun-loving younger set, Vuitton is beloved by the more mature generation, who admire its royal background, quality and the trademark design. 
# [[Hermès]]
# [[Gucci]]: [[Gucci]] has 16 stores in China, recorded sales growth of more than 65% last year.

The '''cold blob''' in the North Atlantic describes a cold temperature anomaly of ocean surface waters, affecting the [[Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation]] (AMOC) which is part of the [[thermohaline circulation]], possibly related to [[global warming]]-induced melting of the [[Greenland ice sheet]].

==General==
{{See also|Greenland ice sheet}}
AMOC is driven by ocean temperature and [[salinity]] differences. The major possible mechanism causing the cold ocean surface temperature anomaly is based on the fact that [[freshwater]] decreases ocean water salinity, and through this process prevents colder waters sinking. Observed freshwater increase originates probably from Greenland ice melt.&lt;ref name=WP2015Sep&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/09/30/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-cold-blob-in-the-north-atlantic-ocean/|title=Everything you need to know about the surprisingly cold ‘blob’ in the North Atlantic ocean|year=2015|publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015 and earlier===
[[File:Amoc-index.svg|thumb|AMOC-Index since 900 CE with pronounced slowdown since ~1850; Rahmstorf et al. (2015)&lt;ref name="rahmstorf2015"/&gt;]]
Climate scientists [[Michael E. Mann|Michael Mann]] of Penn State and [[Stefan Rahmstorf]] from the [[Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research]] suggested that the observed cold pattern during years of temperature records is a sign that the Atlantic Ocean’s [[Meridional overturning circulation]] (AMOC) may be weakening. They published their findings, and concluded that the AMOC circulation shows exceptional slowdown in the last century, and that [[Greenland]] melt is a possible contributor.&lt;ref name="rahmstorf2015"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Nature Climate Change|title=Exceptional twentieth-century slowdown in Atlantic Ocean overturning circulation|authors=Stefan Rahmstorf, Jason E. Box, Georg Feulner, Michael E. Mann, Alexander Robinson, Scott Rutherford &amp; Erik J.

A 2014 study by Jon Robson et al. from the University of Reading concluded about the anomaly, "''...suggest that a substantial change in the AMOC is unfolding now.''"&lt;ref name=WP2015Sep /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Nature Geoscience|title=Atlantic overturning in decline?|authors=Jon Robson, Dan Hodson, Ed Hawkins, Rowan Sutton|url=

===2016===
A study published in 2016, by researchers from the University of South Florida, Canada and the Netherlands, used [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment|GRACE]] satellite data to estimate freshwater flux from Greenland. They concluded that freshwater runoff is accelerating, and could eventually cause a disruption of AMOC in the future, which would affect Europe and North America.&lt;ref name=PhysorgJan2016&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2016-01-greenland-ice-sheet-affect-global.html|title=Melting Greenland ice sheet may affect global ocean circulation, future climate|year=2016|publisher=Phys.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study published in 2016, found further evidence for a considerable impact from [[sea level rise]] for the [[U.S. East Coast]]. The study confirms earlier research findings which identified the region as a hotspot for rising seas, with a potential to divert 3–4 times higher than the global average sea level rise rate. The researchers attribute the possible increase to an ocean circulation mechanism called deep water formation, which is reduced due to AMOC slow down, leading to more warmer water pockets below the surface. Additional the study noted, "Our results suggest that higher carbon emission rates also contribute to increased [sea level rise] in this region compared to the global average."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/02/01/why-the-u-s-east-coast-could-be-a-major-hotspot-for-sea-level-rise/|title=Why the U.S. East Coast could be a major ‘hotspot’ for rising seas|year=2016|publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{See also|North Atlantic Current|Shutdown of thermohaline circulation}}
In 2005, British researchers noticed that the net flow of the northern Gulf Stream had decreased by about 30% since 1957. Coincidentally, scientists at Woods Hole had been measuring the freshening of the North Atlantic as Earth becomes warmer. Their findings suggested that precipitation increases in the high northern latitudes, and polar ice melts as a consequence. By flooding the northern seas with lots of extra fresh water, global warming could, in theory, divert the Gulf Stream waters that usually flow northward, past the British Isles and Norway, and cause them to instead circulate toward the equator. If this were to happen, Europe's climate would be seriously impacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garrison|first=Tom|authorlink =|title=Oceanography: An Invitation to Marine Science|publisher=Cengage Learning|edition=7th|date=2009|pages=582|isbn=9780495391937}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

'''Crime Expo South Africa (CESA)''' was a website that detailed [[crime in South Africa]] and encouraged victims to tell their stories. Pages on the site dealt with murder, rape, [[South African farm attacks|farm attacks]] and [[armed robbery]]. The stated aim of the site was "''to provide foreigners with detailed information and regular updates regarding the issue of safety in South Africa''".&lt;ref name="crimeexpo"&gt;{{cite web | title=Crime Expo South Africa. Ordinary South Africans exposing the truth | work=Crime Expo South Africa | url=http://www.crimexposouthafrica.org/ | accessdate=15 September 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061124201234/http://www.crimexposouthafrica.org/ | archivedate=24 November 2006 | df=dmy-all }} Expired on 21 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The site was started on 4 July 2006 purportedly by a Neil Watson, later purportedly joined by Shaun Thompson; although newspaper reports later suggested that both of these may have been noms-de-plume of a gay rights activist, Juan Duval Uys.

On 21 November 2006 the website was suspended due to the failure of the owners to remove what the hosting service deemed to be abusive content. Watson stated that the offending comments were left by hackers as part of a [[smear campaign]] to discredit the site, and that the site would be relaunched with a new host by 30 November 2006.&lt;ref name="smear"&gt;{{cite web | author=Juanita Williams | title=It's a smear campaign, says Watson | work=Independent Online | date=24 November 2006 | url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=13&amp;art_id=iol1164364456685C653 | accessdate=28 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was back online at the url [http://crimexposouthafrica.net crimexposouthafrica.net], but, as of October 2008, is discontinued.

== Reaction ==
The site received much criticism for "''highlighting negative news and ignoring successes in the fight against crime''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5157614.stm | title=Row over SA website crime warning | work=[[BBC News]] | date = 7 July 2006 | accessdate=15 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, criticism came from the tourism sector for "''skewing the truth''", as well as the [[South African Football Association]] for "''counteracting job creation by discouraging tourism and investment''" (South Africa hosted the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]]). The Crime Expo site contended that South African tourism agencies were only interested in the money spent by international tourists, not in their safety, and were thus downplaying publicity on the violent crimes committed in the country.&lt;ref name="crimeexpo"/&gt;

In response to the Crime Expo website, several individuals started opposing sites claiming to provide a more balanced view of crime in the country. The two most prominent ones are Real South Africa (started by Pieter Boshoff), whose stated aim is to "''make a positive contribution to the development of the country by following a positive approach''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.realsouthafrica.co.za | title=Real South Africa | accessdate=15 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and True Crime Expo(created by Malan Jacobs), which was started "''to try and bring some perspective in this debate''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.truecrimexpo.co.za | title=True Crime Expo – Bringing perspective to Crime Expo | accessdate=15 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further websites have been developed more recently that enable "public interactivity in the debate". Crime Out Loud (created by Claudio Caldeira), displays a more interactive, community-based website for a balanced debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crime Out Loud|url=http://www.crimeoutloud.co.za|accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boshoff's website has been endorsed by prominent businessman [[Raymond Ackerman]], which led to a call from Watson for people to boycott Ackerman's [[Pick 'n Pay Stores|Pick 'n Pay]] supermarket and to send e-mail and text messages to the chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=3015&amp;art_id=vn20060824102616909C333266 | title=SA 'cyberspace crime war' hots up | work=[[Cape Argus]] | date=24 August 2006 | accessdate=26 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Press coverage ==
The website, and the intense debate it sparked, received wide press coverage, being syndicated by [[Reuters]] both locally and abroad. Major news stations and papers which covered the story include [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5157614.stm BBC News], [http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=3015&amp;art_id=vn20060926135134641C198636 Independent Online] and [http://news.independent.co.uk/world/africa/article1195242.ece The Independent]. The impact and content of the site was also debated in several [https://web.archive.org/web/20061006213057/http://www.moneyweb.co.za/blogs/mike_stopforth/781476.htm local] and international blogs.

== Accusations of fraud ==
On 14 November 2006 ''[[The Citizen (South Africa)|The Citizen]]'' published an investigative report alleging that Watson and Shaun Thompson may be the same person, and that they may also be the same person as Juan Duval Uys.&lt;ref name="UysLink"&gt;{{cite web | author=Werner Swart and Paul Kirk | title=Crime website linked to shady gay 'activist' | work=[[The Citizen (South Africa)|The Citizen]] | date=14 November 2006 | url=http://www.citizen.co.za/index/article.aspx?pDesc=27414,1,22 | accessdate=23 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uys is a [[gay rights]] activist and leader of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance. Watson has denied being Uys, stating that Uys was a volunteer at CESA and was involved in its establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Malani Venter and Katrien Smit | title=Crime Expo link to gay group? | work=[[Die Burger]] | date=24 November 2006 | url=http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0,9294,2-7-1442_2035287,00.html | accessdate=27 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Citizen'' further reported that although the website had been accepting donations for some time, no Section 21 company (referring to a South African non-profit organisation) had been registered in its name.&lt;ref name="IntoPolitics"/&gt; [[Simon Grindrod]], the [[Cape Town]] leader of the [[Independent Democrats]], laid a charge of fraud against Watson, calling on him to "explain what he has done with the money".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Juanita Williams | title=Crime expo website: Grindrod lays charge | work=Independent Online | date=23 November 2006 | url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=13&amp;art_id=iol1164284350209C652 | accessdate=28 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation of political party ==
According to the website, the leaders of the organisation were in the process of filing an application at the [[Independent Electoral Commission (South Africa)|Independent Electoral Commission]] in [[Pretoria]] to register as a political party. The party would be registered as ''Crime Expo South Africa'', abbreviated CESA. In early November 2006, the IEC reported that a man claiming to be Mr. Watson had enquired about forming a political party, but had not actually begun the process.&lt;ref name="IntoPolitics"&gt;{{cite web | author=Werner Swart | title=Crime website mystery man going into politics? | work=[[The Citizen (South Africa)|The Citizen]]| date=15 November 2006 | url=http://www.citizen.co.za/index/article.aspx?pDesc=27534,1,22 | accessdate=23 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, the [[National Party South Africa]] party was registered with the [[Independent Electoral Commission (South Africa)|Independent Electoral Commission]] as a new incarnation of the defunct [[New National Party (South Africa)|New National Party]].&lt;ref name="NewOldNP"&gt;{{cite web | author=Janet Smith  | title=NP is back, itching for a fight | work=Independent Online| date=24 August 2008 | url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=13&amp;art_id=vn20080824084245354C368343 | accessdate=26 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juan-Duval Uys was listed as the party's organiser.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6466">'''Darkhad''' (also "Darkhat") is a dialect in-between [[Mongolian language|Central Mongolian]] and [[Oirat language|Oirat]]&lt;ref&gt;Sanjaa and Tuyaa 2001: 33-34&lt;/ref&gt; still variously seen as closer to Oirat&lt;ref&gt;as Tuyaa and Tuul 2008: 5 can be understood&lt;/ref&gt; or as a dialect of [[Khalkha Mongolian]] with some Oirat features.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Svantesson et al. 2005: 142.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it seems to have substantially [[Language contact|assimilated]] to the Khalkha dialect since it first was described by Sanžeev,&lt;ref&gt;Gáspár 2006: 25 based on own field research and Sanžeev 1931&lt;/ref&gt; and some classificational differences seem to be due to what historical (or even ideal) state got classified. A population of 20,000 was reported in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{e16|drh|Darkhat}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers live mainly in the west of [[Lake Khövsgöl]] in the [[Sums of Mongolia|sum]]s [[Bayanzürkh, Khövsgöl|Bayanzürkh]], [[Ulaan-Uul, Khövsgöl|Ulaan-Uul]] and [[Renchinlkhümbe, Khövsgöl|Rinchinlkhümbe]] in the [[Khövsgöl Province]] of [[Mongolia]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanžaa and Tujaa 2001: 33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonetics and phonology==

In contrast to Oirat, it has {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} and a [[diphthong]]ized equivalent of *ai.&lt;ref&gt;Rinchen 1979: 176-177, 179, 197, 202, phoneme analysis according to Svantesson et al. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[monophthong]]ized [[Reflex (disambiguation)|reflexes]] of *ai can be encountered and more so in older language material, so it can be assumed that {{IPA|*ai &gt; ɛː &gt; ɛe}} due to Khalkha influence.&lt;ref&gt;Gáspár 2006: 16-17, 19&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhat similar developments can be observed for other vowels,&lt;ref&gt;Gáspár 2006: 13-20&lt;/ref&gt; but as at least {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/l/}} can get [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]],&lt;ref&gt;Gáspár 2006: 22-23&lt;/ref&gt; it is problematic whether palatalized consonants or [[Front vowel|fronted vowels]] have to be considered as [[phoneme]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Non-initial *i has disappeared from the phonemic representation (Gáspár 2006: 11), but as Gáspár doesn't ask the question.&lt;/ref&gt; It patterns with the Oirat dialects of the Mongolian state in that it retains *ŋn &lt;ref&gt;Rinchen 1979: 231-234; instead of {{IPA|[ŋ]}}, an underlined "n" is used which is cryptically explained as a "nasalized n", but is used on 185 and 189 to mark the well-known word-final {{IPA|/ŋ/}} in such words as ⟨šaltgaan⟩ ({{IPA|[ɴ]}}) and ⟨hövüün⟩ ({{IPA|[ŋ]}}; cp. Svantesson et al. 2005: 18)&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes has *b &gt; {{IPA|/m/}}.&lt;ref&gt;Rinchen 1979: 222-223, for a counterexample see 225&lt;/ref&gt; It doesn't have the Khalkh {{IPA|/ʊ/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} in non-first [[syllable]]s, as these [[Merger (phonology)|merged]] with {{IPA|/ɔ/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}.&lt;ref&gt;Sanžaa and Tujaa 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Verbal system==

[[Grammatical person|Person]] [[inflection]]s as in Oirat or [[Buryat language|Buryat]] are getting lost, but used to be present. There are both voluntatives (irrespective of number) in –ja/-ji as in Khalkha and –su for first person singular as in Oirat and Buryat, e.g. {{IPA|/ɡaldat͡ʃixa̯ja̯/}}&lt;ref&gt;From the material cited in this article, it is impossible to say whether Darkhad differentiates between voicedness or aspiratedness. It is not even possible to make a reasonable guess as Khalkha, Oirat and Buryat seem to differ from each other in this respect. As the transcription quoted is neither strictly phonemic nor phonetic, it is also impossible to know whether {{IPA|/l, ɡ, x/}} or rather {{IPA|/ɮ, ɢ, χ/}}&lt;/ref&gt; ‘let’s burn it’ and {{IPA|ɔrsu}} 'I shall enter', but the latter form is rare.  The benedictive –kti is actively used as holds for Buryat, e.g. {{IPA|/taː bide̯ nertæ jawd͡ʒi̯ bɛekti/}} ‘Please, come with us’. Next to the normal concessive in –g/-k ‘s/he may’, there is also a concessive -{{IPA|/ɡalda̯/}} that marks an order to a third person. The other, fairly unremarkable [[Linguistic modality|modal]] verbal [[suffix]]es are the imperative, prescriptive, optative and dubitative.&lt;ref&gt;Gáspár 2006: 27-31&lt;/ref&gt; The inventory of indicative finite verbal suffixes contains the usual reflexes of Written Mongolian ⟨-nam⟩, ⟨-luγ-a⟩, ⟨-ǰuqui⟩ and ⟨-ba⟩, the last one being rare as usual. There is a fifth suffix, {{IPA|/-t͡ʃɔ/}} (possibly from ⟨-ǰu orkiǰuqui⟩), probably expressing some kind of perfect aspect meaning, that is peculiar to Darkhad, e.g. {{IPA|/jawult͡ʃɔ/}} ‘has sent’. The [[participle]]s are the same as in Common Mongolic.&lt;ref&gt;Gáspár 2006: 31-36&lt;/ref&gt; However, a thorough analysis of the function of these items in contrast to each other has not been conducted. The [[converb]]s are not very particular, but the earliest texts of Darkhad still have a conditional {{IPA|/-wa̯s/}} (as in Buryat and [[Middle Mongolian language|Middle Mongolian]]) next to {{IPA|/-wa̯l/}}. Furthermore, it used to be possible to negative them with reflexes of ⟨ügei⟩ as in Buryat. Instead of ⟨-maγča⟩ ‘as soon as’, ⟨-nsar⟩ is used.&lt;ref&gt;Gáspár 2006: 36-39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nominal system==

The [[Grammatical case|case system]] is the same as in Khalkha, and Oirat [[plural]]s like –mud are absent.&lt;ref&gt;Gáspar 2006: 40-42&lt;/ref&gt; The [[pronoun]]s are the same as Khalkha, but a paradigm of the first person plural exclusive without [[nominative]] is attested for the old stages of Darkhat&lt;ref&gt;Gáspar 2006: 44-45&lt;/ref&gt; (as would hold for Khalkha&lt;ref&gt;Poppe 1951: 71&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1930s and still holds for Oirat).

'''''Delusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference''''' is a 2010 book by [[Cordelia Fine]], written to [[Debunker|debunk]] the idea that men and women are hardwired with different interests. The author criticizes claimed evidence of the existence of innate biological differences between men and women's [[mind]]s as being faulty and exaggerated, and while taking a position of agnosticism with respect to inherent differences relating to interest/skill in 'understanding the world' versus 'understanding people', reviews literature demonstrating how cultural and societal beliefs contribute to sex differences.

==Contents==
In the first part of the book, "'Half Changed World', Half Changed Minds", Fine argues that social and environmental factors strongly influence the mind, challenging a 'biology as fallback' view that, since society is equal now for the sexes, persistent inequalities must be due to biology. She also discusses the history and impact of gender stereotypes and the ways that science has been used to justify sexism.

In the second part of the book, "Neurosexism", Fine criticizes the current available arguments and studies supporting sex differences in the mind, focusing on methodological weaknesses and implicit assumptions. Within neuroscientific investigations, these include small samples that give rise to unreliable, spurious results, and poorly justified 'reverse inferences' (claims of stereotype-consistent psychological differences between the sexes on the basis of brain differences). Fine also demonstrates how already weak neuroscientific conclusions are then grossly overblown by popular writers. Fine also discusses non-neuroimaging evidence cited as support for innate differences between the sexes. For example, she explains weaknesses in the work done by a student of [[Simon Baron-Cohen]] that has been widely cited (by the [[Michael Gurian|Gurian Institute]], by [[Leonard Sax]], by [[Peter Lawrence (biologist)|Peter Lawrence]], and by Baron-Cohen himself): one-and-a-half-day-old babies were tested for preference in sequence rather than being given a choice; were tested in different viewing positions, some horizontal on their backs and some held in a parent's lap, which could affect their perception; inadequate efforts were made to ensure the sex of the subject was unknown to the tester at the time of the test; the authors assume, without justification, that newborn looking preferences are a reliable 'flag' for later social skills that are the product of a long and complex developmental process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fine, Cordelia|title=Delusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference|publisher=W. W. Norton|year=2010|isbn=978-0-393-34024-2|pages=112–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third part of the book, "Recycling Gender", Fine discusses the highly gendered society in which children develop, and the contribution of that to the group identity processes that motivate children to 'self-socialize'. This challenges the common belief of parents that they tried gender-neutral parenting, but it didn't work. An overall thesis of the work is the negative impact for sex equality of neurosexism (popular or academic neuroscientific claims that reinforce or justify gender stereotypes in ways that are not scientifically justified).

===Academic reaction===
[[Simon Baron-Cohen]] reviewed the book in ''The Psychologist''. In it, he accused Fine of "fusing science with politics," writing, "Where I – and I suspect many other contemporary scientists – would part ways with Fine is in her strident, extreme denial of the role that biology might play in giving rise to any sex differences in the mind and brain. ...(she) ignores that you can be a scientist interested in the nature of sex differences while being a clear supporter of equal opportunities and a firm opponent of all forms of discrimination in society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Baron-Cohen | first = Simon | author-link = Simon Baron-Cohen | title = Delusions of gender – ‘neurosexism’, biology and politics | journal = [[The Psychologist (magazine)|The Psychologist]] | volume = 23 | issue = 11 | pages = 904&amp;ndash;905 | publisher = [[British Psychological Society]] | date = November 2010 | url = http://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-23/edition-11/book-reviews | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fine responded in a published letter to ''The Psychologist,'' stating "The thesis of my book (no veils required) is that while social effects on sex differences are well-established, spurious results, poor methodologies and untested assumptions mean we don’t yet know whether, on average, males and females are born differently predisposed to systemizing versus empathising."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fine | first = Cordelia | author-link = Cordelia Fine | title = Forum: Seductive arguments? | journal = [[The Psychologist (magazine)|The Psychologist]] | volume = 23 | issue = 11 | pages = 948&amp;ndash;949 | publisher = [[British Psychological Society]] | date = December 2010 | url = https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-23/edition-12/forum | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20110708192356/http://www.cordeliafine.com/Fine_Response_Psychologist_December_2010.pdf Pdf version.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[American Psychological Association|APA]] President [[Diane F.

Most of these are ignored by Fine.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanford neurobiologist [[Ben Barres]] stated in a review for the Public Library of Science Biology that Delusions of Gender "should be required reading for every neurobiology student, if not every human being."&lt;ref name="Barres2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barres|first1=Ben A.|title=Neuro Nonsense|journal=PLoS Biology|volume=8|issue=12|year=2010|pages=e1001005|issn=1545-7885|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lewis Wolpert]], a developmental biologist who is the author of ''Why can't a woman be more like a man?'', in a video lecture stated that Fine "[hasn't] got a clue about biology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OQUuGMwqyU|title=Physical &amp; Psychological Differences Between Men and Women. Lewis Wolpert (2013)|first=|last=George Kalarritis|date=8 January 2017|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he offered no specific criticism of Fine's claims.

McCarthy and Ball (2011) reviewed the book in the journal ''Biology of Sex Differences.'' They acknowledged that "Prompting laypeople to adopt a more critical view of overly simplistic views of complex data sets is a goal any scientist can support, and for that we applaud (Fine's) efforts." However, their overall review is not positive, and they suggest that Fine's book presents an oversimplified and seriously distorted characterization of neuroscience as applied to the study of sex differences. They expressed disappointment that Fine's book "...can be vexing in the ways the scientific study of sex differences in brain and behavior is portrayed and (how) the current state-of-the-art is presented."&lt;ref name="McCarthyBall2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCarthy|first1=Margaret M|last2=Ball|first2=Gregory F|title=Tempests and tales: challenges to the study of sex differences in the brain|journal=Biology of Sex Differences|volume=2|issue=1|year=2011|pages=4|issn=2042-6410|doi=10.1186/2042-6410-2-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later work by Fine published in the journal ''Neuroethics'' identified systematic issues in the way human neuroimaging investigations of sex differences tend to be investigated, contra the notion of a few 'bad apples'.&lt;ref name="FineNEth2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fine|first1=Cordelia|title=Is There Neurosexism in Functional Neuroimaging Investigations of Sex Differences?|journal=Neuroethics|volume=6|issue=2|year=2012|pages=369–409|issn=1874-5490|doi=10.1007/s12152-012-9169-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the criticisms of such work made in ''Delusions of Gender'' were noted in the article "Perils and pitfalls of reporting sex differences" by Donna L. Maney, as part of a ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society'' Theme Issue "Multifaceted origins of sex differences in the brain', compiled and edited by McCarthy in 2016.

Evolutionary biologist [[Marlene Zuk]], reviewing the book with [[Rebecca Jordan-Young]]'s ''Brain Storm'', in the ''Quarterly Review of Biology'' wrote: "It is important to emphasize that neither author advocates throwing the gender-neutral baby out with its pink or blue bathwater ... The books are good ammunition for arguments with people who think science has incontrovertibly shown biological bases for gender differences such as mathematical ability. At the same time, they are not simply claiming that “it is all culture” or that science can play no role in understanding gender. Both Fine and Jordan-Young want better science, not less of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=10.1086/661120|title=Mentally Rotating Gender|first=Marlene|last=Zuk|editor-first1=Cordelia|editor-last1=Fine|editor-first2=Rebecca M.|editor-last2=Jordan-Young|date=15 August 2017|publisher=|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|volume=86|issue=3|pages=198–202|doi=10.1086/661120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12992">The '''Demographics of Gabon''' is the makeup of the population of [[Gabon]]. As of {{UN_Population|Year}}, Gabon has a population of {{UN_Population|Gabon}}{{UN_Population|ref}}. Gabon's population is relatively young with 35.5% of its population under 15 years of age and only 4.3% of its population over 65 years old. Gabon has a nearly even split between males and females with 0.99 males for every female in the population. In the age range of 15–65, the ration is exactly 1 male to 1 female. The [[life expectancy]] of Gabon is lower than the world average. Gabon's population's life expectancy at birth is 53.11 years while the world average is 67.2 years as of 2010. Ethnically, the biggest group in Gabon are the [[Fang people]] with over 500,000 people, or about a third of Gabon's population, belonging to this ethnic group. The biggest religion in Gabon is [[Christianity]], with between 55–75% of the population of Gabon being Christian.

'''Dongotono''' (Dongotono pronunciation: /dóŋòtónò/&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Eastern Nilotes: Linguistic and Historical Reconstructions|last = Vossen|first = Rainer|publisher = Dietrich Reimer Verlag|year = 1982|isbn = |location = Berlin|pages = 165}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[Eastern Nilotic languages|Eastern Nilotic]] language spoken by an estimated 5,000 people in [[South Sudan]].&lt;ref name=e18/&gt;

== Classification ==
Dongotono has been classified as a member of the Eastern Nilotic branch of Nilotic, in the Eastern Sudanic sub-grouping of [[Nilo-Saharan]]. Within Eastern Nilotic, Dongotono is considered part of the Lotuko language group, in the Lotuko-Maa branch of Teso-Lotuko-Maa (also referred to as the non-Bari languages).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Eastern Nilotes: Linguistic and Historical Reconstructions|last = Vossen|first = Rainer|publisher = Dietrich Reimer Verlag|year = 1982|isbn = |location = Berlin|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other members of the Lotuko language group include [[Lopit language|Lopit]], [[Lotuko language|Lotuko]], [[Lokoya language|Lokoya]] and [[Lango language (South Sudan)|Lango]], all spoken in nearby regions of in [[South Sudan]]. Of these languages, Lopit is most similar to Dongotono, with a comparative study showing 66.4% lexical similarity between the two. The same study showed 60.6% lexical similarity between Dongotono and Lotuko, and 56.5% similarity between Dongotono and Lokoya.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Eastern Nilotes: Linguistic and Historical Reconstructions|last = Vossen|first = Rainer|publisher = Dietrich Reimer Verlag|year = 1982|isbn = |location = Berlin|pages = 111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geographic distribution ==
The Dongotono language is spoken by the [[Dongotono people]], who live on the north-western slopes of the [[Dongotono Mountains]] in the southern part of [[Eastern Equatoria State]], [[South Sudan]]. Administratively, this area is part of [[Ikotos County]], and the Dongotono live in large and densely populated settlements which include Chakari, Ikotos, Isoke, and Bira.&lt;ref name=e18/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.gurtong.net/Peoples/PeoplesProfiles/Dongotona/tabid/190/Default.aspx|title = Dongotona|date = 2014|accessdate = 9 Jan 2015|website = Gurtong|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are an estimated 5,000 speakers of the language,&lt;ref name=e18/&gt; and the language is considered threatened,  though the number of Dongotono people may be as much as 20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.gurtong.net/Peoples/PeoplesProfiles/Dongotona/tabid/190/Default.aspx|title = Dongotona|date = 2014|accessdate = Jan 9, 2015|website = Gurtong|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phonology ==

There has been very little research on Dongotono, but some tentative phonological and morphological observations can be found in Vossen (1982), based on wordlist data collected in the 1970s. Vossen notes that the data are too limited to draw any safe conclusions. He observed that the phoneme inventories of Dongotono, Lokoya and Lopit were similar enough to be treated together, and provided a consonant inventory for all three languages together, represented in the table below.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Eastern Nilotes: Linguistic and Historical Reconstructions|last = Vossen|first = Rainer|publisher = Dietrich Reimer Verlag|year = 1982|isbn = |location = Berlin|pages = 189–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The voiced palatal stop /ɟ/ is described as implosive (/ʄ/). Vossen also notes that /b/ is interchangeable with implosive [ɓ], and /d/ is interchangeable with implosive [ɗ]. /p/ does not occur word-initially in Vossen's Dongotono data, and is replaced by [f] or [ɸ] between vowels. /pː/ does not seem to be present in Dongotono. /k/ is replaced by [x] in certain environments but is retained in others. There are no examples the voiced velar stop /g/ in Vossen's Dongotono data. The glottal stop /ʔ/ occurs word-finally only. The glides /wː/ and /jː/ are only found word-medially.

=== Vowels ===

According to Vossen, Dongotono has two sets of five vowels, distinguished by the phonological feature [[Advanced and retracted tongue root|Advanced Tongue Root]] ([ATR]). These are listed in the table below.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Eastern Nilotes: Linguistic and Historical Reconstructions|last = Vossen|first = Rainer|publisher = Dietrich Reimer Verlag|year = 1982|isbn = |location = Berlin|pages = 192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

However, Vossen notes that no different symbols were used for [+ATR] /a/ and [-ATR] /a/ "as they cannot be distinguished phonetically".

Vossen finds no examples of vowel length being contrastive in Dongotono. He observes that vowel harmony plays an important role, but does not describe the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Eastern Nilotes: Linguistic and Historical Reconstructions|last = Vossen|first = Rainer|publisher = Dietrich Reimer Verlag|year = 1982|isbn = |location = Berlin|pages = 193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tone ===

Vossen observes that on the surface there are four tones in Dongotono: High, Low, Mid, and High-Falling. They appear to be used for both lexical and grammatical contrasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Eastern Nilotes: Linguistic and Historical Reconstructions|last = Vossen|first = Rainer|publisher = Dietrich Reimer Verlag|year = 1982|isbn = |location = Berlin|pages = 193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grammar ==
Word order in Dongotono is generally [[Verb-Subject-Object]], as is typical for most Eastern Nilotic languages.

Vossen states that for all the non-Bari languages, including Dongotono, the verbs fall into two morphological classes, conventionally called Class 1 and Class 2. Class 2 verbs have a stem with an initial close-front vowel /i-/ or /ɪ-/, and Class 1 verb stems are consonant-initial. A number of possible verbal affixes were observed but their functions not determined.

Number-marking on nouns appears to be extremely irregular. A variety of suffixes are used to indicate singular, singulative, and plural.

Like other languages in the Lotuxo group, Dongotono has two grammatical genders, masculine and feminine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Eastern Nilotes: Linguistic and Historical Reconstructions|last = Vossen|first = Rainer|publisher = Dietrich Reimer Verlag|year = 1982|isbn = |location = Berlin|pages = 213–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vocabulary ==

Some example Dongotono words are given below, from the wordlist in Vossen (1982). Each Dongotono word is in the phonetic transcription used by Vossen, as there is not yet an established orthography for the language.

'''''Environment &amp; Urbanization''''' is a biannual [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] covering [[urban studies|urban]] and [[environmental studies]]. It is published by [[Sage Publications]] and was established in 1989. Each issue of the journal focuses on a particular theme.

== Abstracting and indexing ==
The journal is abstracted and indexed in:
* [[Current Contents]]/Social and Behavioral Science
* [[GEOBASE]]
* [[International Bibliography of the Social Sciences]]
* [[Social Sciences Citation Index]]
According to the ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]'', the journal has a 2017 [[impact factor]] of 2.254, ranking it twelfth among 40 journals in the category "Urban Studies".&lt;ref name="WoS"&gt;{{cite book|title=2017 [[Journal Citation Reports]]|last=|first=|publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]]|year=2018|isbn=|edition=Science|series=[[Web of Science]]|location=|pages=|chapter=Journals Ranked by Impact: Urban Studies|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scope ==
The journal focuses on urban issues in Africa, Asia, and Latin America because these regions have most of the world's urban population.&lt;ref&gt;Satterthwaite, David (2003), "Setting an urban agenda: Human settlements and IIED-America Latina", in Cross, Nigel (editor), Evidence of Hope; the Search for Sustainable Development, Earthscan Publications, London, pages 122-146&lt;/ref&gt; It is available free to teaching or training institutions and [[non-governmental organization]]s in low- and middle-income countries. Articles can be submitted in French, Spanish, or Portuguese and, if accepted for publication, are translated into English at the journal's expenses.

To reach a more general public who may not usually read academic journals, a five-page ''Environment and Urbanization Brief'' appears with each issue.&lt;ref name=briefs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.environmentandurbanization.org/eandu_briefs.html |title=Environment &amp; Urbanization: Briefs |work= |accessdate=2010-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628073409/http://www.environmentandurbanization.org/eandu_briefs.html |archivedate=2010-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
''Environment &amp; Urbanization'' was established in 1989 by the [[International Institute for Environment and Development]] (IIED) to fill a perceived gap in coverage of urban issues in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. It was based on a Spanish language journal of the same name (''Medio Ambiente y Urbanización'') that had been set up in 1983 by IIED’s sister institution in Argentina, IIED-America Latina. Both journals sought to give more prominence to urban issues, especially those linked to urban poverty. Another related journal, ''Environment &amp; Urbanization ASIA'' was launched in 2010, edited by Om Prakash Mathur and published by Sage Publications India, in response to the fact that half the world's urban population now lives in Asia.&lt;ref name=eua&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sagepub.com/journals/Journal201993/title |title=SAGE journal: Environment and Urbanization ASIA |work= |accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Environment &amp; Urbanization'' was first published on the web in 1994 with free access to issues older than two years. Sage Publications began publishing the journal from 2006. A selection of papers is available in Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccpg.org.cn |title=城市社区参与治理资源平台 &gt;&gt; 首页 |publisher=Ccpg.org.cn |date= |accessdate=2012-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307202237/http://www.ccpg.org.cn/ |archivedate=2012-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bromsten Fascinate målad 1989.jpg|thumb|Fascinate in February 2011]]
'''''Fascinate''''' is a [[graffiti]] painting at an industrial park in [[Bromsten]], [[Stockholm]].

''Fascinate'' was created by Circle and Tariq ([[Tarik Saleh]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fria.nu/artikel/8494 Fria Tidningen: Hög tid för en ny syn på graffiti]&lt;/ref&gt; then 17 years old, in 1989 and was then the largest graffiti painting in northern Europe. It is painted on an outside wall of an industrial building and was made with consent from the property owner. ''Fascinate'' is one of the world's oldest still existing graffiti paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stockholmsfria.nu/artikel/86803 Stockholms Fria: Oviss framtid för väggmålning som skrämmer och fascinerar]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 graffiti was a relatively new phenomenon in Sweden. The Bromsten industrial area was reconstructed into a residential area starting in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://xn--vxer-loa.stockholm/omraden/spanga-bromstensstaden/&lt;/ref&gt; A discussion took place about possible protection of ''Fascinate'' as the [[Stockholm City Museum]] considered it culturally valuable. In 2008, however, the center-right majority in the city planning committee decided that the painting should not be maintained, referring to the city's graffiti policy, which says that the city should not "participate in activities that in any way encourages graffiti".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Borg|first1=Kristian|title=Stockholms klotterpolicy förbjuder även laglig graffiti|url=http://www.stockholmsfria.se/artikel/79754|website=stockholmsfria.se|publisher=[[Stockholms Fria Tidning]]|accessdate=9 December 2015|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a period of uncertainty regarding the future of ''Fascinate'', the wall became the first graffiti work in Sweden to be officially protected in 2015. The rest of the building is to be demolished and the area around the wall transformed into a park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weibull|first1=Hedvig|title=Första graffitimålningen i Sverige skyddad|url=http://www.svt.se/kultur/konst/omtvistade-fascinate-officiellt-k-markt|website=svt.se|publisher=[[Sveriges Television]]|accessdate=9 December 2015|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gothic''' &lt;!-- Do NOT specify endonyms without specifying a reliable source --&gt;is an [[extinct language|extinct]] [[East Germanic languages|East]] [[Germanic language]] that was spoken by the [[Goths]]. It is known primarily from the ''[[Codex Argenteus]]'', a 6th-century copy of a 4th-century Bible translation, and is the only [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic language]] with a sizable [[text corpus]].  All others, including [[Burgundian language (Germanic)|Burgundian]] and [[Vandalic language|Vandalic]], are known, if at all, only from proper names that survived in historical accounts, and from [[loanword]]s in other languages such as [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[French language|French]].

As a Germanic language, Gothic is a part of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] family. It is the earliest Germanic language that is attested in any sizable texts, but it lacks any modern descendants. The oldest documents in Gothic date back to the fourth century. The language was in decline by the mid-sixth century, partly because of the military defeat of the Goths at the hands of the [[Franks]], the elimination of the Goths in Italy, and geographic isolation (in Spain the Gothic language lost its last and probably already declining function as a church language when the [[Visigoths]] converted to Catholicism in 589).&lt;ref&gt;''Strategies of Distinction: Construction of Ethnic Communities, 300–800'' (''Transformation of the Roman World'', vol. 2) by Walter Pohl, {{ISBN|90-04-10846-7}} (pp. 119–121)&lt;/ref&gt; 
The language survived as a domestic language in the [[Iberian peninsula]] (modern Spain and Portugal) as late as the eighth century. Gothic-seeming terms are found in manuscripts subsequent to this date, but these may or may not belong to the same language. In particular, a language known as [[Crimean Gothic]] survived in the lower [[Danube]] area and in isolated mountain regions in [[Crimea]]. Lacking certain sound changes characteristic of Gothic, however, Crimean Gothic cannot be a lineal descendant of Bible Gothic.{{sfn|Stearns|1978|p=118}}

The existence of such early attested texts makes it a language of considerable interest in [[comparative linguistics]].

==History and evidence==
[[File:Ambrosianus.jpg|thumb|240px|A leaf of the ''Codex Ambrosianus B'']]
Only a few documents in Gothic survive, not enough for completely reconstructing the language. Most Gothic corpora are translations or glosses of other languages (namely, Greek), so foreign linguistic elements most certainly influenced the texts. These are the primary sources:

* The largest body of surviving documentation consists of [[codices]] commissioned by the [[Arianism|Arian]] bishop [[Ulfilas]] (Wulfila, 311–382), the leader of a community of [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] [[Christianity|Christian]]s in the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province of [[Moesia]] (modern [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]]/[[Romania]]). He commissioned a translation of the [[Greek Vulgate|Greek Bible]] into the Gothic language, of which roughly three-quarters of the [[New Testament]] and some fragments of the [[Old Testament]] have survived. The translations, performed by several scholars, are collected in the following codices:
:*''[[Codex Argenteus]]'' ([[Uppsala]]), including the Speyer fragment: 188 leaves
::The best-preserved Gothic manuscript and dating from the sixth century, it was preserved and transmitted by northern [[Ostrogoths]] in modern Italy. It contains a large part of the four [[Gospel]]s. Since it is a translation from Greek, the language of the ''Codex Argenteus'' is replete with borrowed Greek words and Greek usages. The syntax in particular is often copied directly from the Greek.
:*''[[Codex Ambrosianus]]'' ([[Milan]]) and the ''[[Codex Taurinensis]]'' ([[Turin]]): Five parts, totaling 193 leaves
::It contains scattered passages from the New Testament (including parts of the Gospels and the [[Epistle]]s), of the [[Old Testament]] ([[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]]), and some commentaries known as ''[[Skeireins]]''.  The text likely had been somewhat modified by copyists.
:*''[[Codex Gissensis]]'' ([[Gießen]]): One leaf, fragments of Luke 23–24 was found in an excavation in [[Faiyum|Arsinoë]] in Egypt in 1907 and was destroyed by water damage in 1945, after copies had already been made by researchers.
:*''[[Codex Carolinus]]'' ([[Wolfenbüttel]]): Four leaves, fragments of Romans 11–15
:* ''Codex Vaticanus Latinus'' 5750 ([[Vatican City]]): Three leaves, pages 57–58, 59–60, and 61–62 of the ''Skeireins''. This is a fragment of ''Codex Ambrosianus E''. 

* A scattering of old documents: alphabets, calendars, glosses found in a number of manuscripts and a few [[Gothic runic inscriptions|runic inscriptions]] (between three and 13) that are known or suspected to be Gothic: some scholars believe that these inscriptions are not at all Gothic.&lt;ref&gt;Braune/Ebbinghaus, ''Gotische Grammatik'', Tübingen 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Several names in an Indian inscription were thought to be possibly Gothic by Krause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krause|first1=Wolfgang|title=Handbuch des Gotischen|publisher=Niemeyer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, late ninth-century Christian inscriptions (using the Gothic alphabet, not runes, and copying or mimicking Biblical Gothic orthography) have been found at [[Mangup]] in [[Crimea]].&lt;ref&gt;Korobov, M. and A. Vinogradov, 'Gotische Graffito-Inschriften aus der Bergkrim', Zeitschrift für deutsches Altertum und Literatur 145.2 (2016) pp. 141-157, esp. p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A small dictionary of more than 80 words and a song without translation, compiled by the Fleming [[Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq]], the [[Habsburg]] ambassador to the court of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in [[Istanbul]] from 1555 to 1562, who was curious to find out about the language and by arrangement met two speakers of [[Crimean Gothic]] and listed the terms in his compilation ''Turkish Letters'':  These terms date from nearly a millennium later than Ulfilas, so are not representative of his language. Busbecq's material also contains many puzzles and enigmas and is difficult to interpret in the light of comparative Germanic linguistics.

Reports of the discovery of other parts of Ulfilas' Bible have not been substantiated. [[Heinrich May]] in 1968 claimed to have found in England 12 leaves of a [[palimpsest]] containing parts of the [[Gospel of Matthew]]. 

Only fragments of the Gothic translation of the [[Bible]] have been preserved. The translation was apparently done in the [[Balkans]] region by people in close contact with Greek [[Christianity|Christian]] culture. The Gothic Bible apparently was used by the [[Visigoths]] in [[Iberian peninsula|Iberia]] until about 700, and perhaps for a time in Italy, the [[Balkans]], and [[Ukraine]]. In exterminating [[Arianism]], many texts in Gothic were probably expunged and overwritten as palimpsests or collected and burned. Apart from Biblical texts, the only substantial Gothic document that still exists and the only lengthy text known to have been composed originally in the Gothic language, is the ''Skeireins'', a few pages of commentary on the [[Gospel of John]].

Very few secondary sources make reference to the Gothic language after about 800. In ''De incrementis ecclesiae Christianae'' (840–842), [[Walafrid Strabo]], a Frankish monk who lived in [[Swabia]], speaks of a group of monks, who reported that "even now certain peoples in [[Scythia]] ([[Dobruja]]), especially around [[Constanța|Tomis]] spoke a ''sermo Theotiscus'' ('Germanic language'), the language of the Gothic translation of the Bible, and they used such a liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;
Alice L. Harting-Correa, "Walahfrid Strabo's libellus de exordiis et incrementis quarundam in observationibus ecclesiasticis rerum. A translation and liturgical commentary", Leiden-New York-Köln: Brill, 1996 ({{ISBN|90 04 09669 8}}), pp. 72–73. Discussion between W. Haubrichs and S. Barnish in D. H. Green (2007), "Linguistic and Literary Traces of the Ostrogoths", ''The Ostrogoths from the Migration Period to the Sixth Century: An Ethnographic Perspective'', Sam J. Barnish and Federico Marazzi, eds., part of ''Studies in Historical Archaeoethnology'', Volume 7, Giorgio Ausenda, series ed. (Oxford: Boydell Press, {{ISBN|978-1-84383-074-0}}.), p. 409 and n1.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In evaluating medieval texts that mention the [[Goths]], many writers used the word ''Goths'' to mean any Germanic people in eastern Europe (such as the [[Varangians]]), many of whom certainly did not use the Gothic language as known from the Gothic Bible. Some writers even referred to [[Slavic languages|Slavic]]-speaking people as Goths. However, it is clear from Ulfilas' translation that despite some puzzles the language belongs with the Germanic language group, not with Slavic.

The relationship between the language of the Crimean Goths and Ulfilas's Gothic is less clear. The few fragments of Crimean Gothic from the 16th century show significant differences from the language of the Gothic Bible although some of the glosses, such as ''ada'' for "egg", could indicate a common heritage, and Gothic ''mena'' ("moon"), compared to Crimean Gothic ''mine'', can suggest an East Germanic connection.

Generally, the Gothic language refers to the language of [[Ulfilas]], but the attestations themselves are largely from the 6th century, long after Ulfilas had died. The above list is not exhaustive, and a more extensive list is available on the website of the Wulfila project.

==Alphabet and transliteration==
{{Main|Gothic alphabet}}

Ulfilas's Gothic, as well as that of the ''Skeireins'' and various other manuscripts, was written using an alphabet that was most likely invented by Ulfilas himself for his translation.  Some scholars (such as Braune) claim that it was derived from the [[Greek alphabet]] only while others maintain that there are some Gothic letters of [[Runic]] or [[Latin]] origin.

A standardized system is used for transliterating Gothic words into the [[Latin script]]. The system mirrors the conventions of the native alphabet, such as writing long {{IPA|/iː/}} as ''ei''.  The Goths used their equivalents of ''e'' and ''o'' alone only for long higher vowels, using the digraphs ''ai'' and ''au'' (much as in [[French orthography|French]]) for the corresponding short or lower vowels. There are two variant spelling systems: a "raw" one that directly transliterates the original Gothic script and a "normalized" one that adds [[diacritic]]s ([[Macron (diacritic)|macron]]s and [[acute accent]]s) to certain vowels to clarify the pronunciation or, in certain cases, to indicate the [[Proto-Germanic]] origin of the vowel in question. The latter system is usually used in the academic literature.

The following table shows the correspondence between spelling and sound for vowels:

Notes:
* This "normalised transliteration" system devised by [[Jacob Grimm]] is used in some modern editions of Gothic texts and in studies of [[Proto-Germanic language|Common Germanic]]. It signals distinctions not made by Ulfilas in his alphabet. Rather, they reflect various origins in Proto-Germanic. Thus,
** &lt;big&gt;''aí''&lt;/big&gt; is used for the sound derived from the Proto-Germanic short vowels ''e'' and ''i'' before {{IPA|/h/}} and {{IPA|/r/}}.
** &lt;big&gt;''ái''&lt;/big&gt; is used for the sound derived from the Proto-Germanic diphthong ''ai''. Some scholars have considered this sound to have remained as a diphthong in Gothic. However, Ulfilas was highly consistent in other spelling inventions, which makes it unlikely that he assigned two different sounds to the same digraph. Furthermore, he consistently used the digraph to represent Greek {{lang|grc|αι}}, which was then certainly a [[monophthong]]. A monophthongal value is accepted by [[Eduard Prokosch]] in his influential ''A Common Germanic Grammar''.&lt;ref name="Prokosch"&gt;Prokosch p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; It had earlier been accepted by [[Joseph Wright (linguist)|Joseph Wright]] but only in an appendix to his ''Grammar of the Gothic Language''.&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;Wright (1910 edition) p. 362&lt;/ref&gt;
** &lt;big&gt;''ai''&lt;/big&gt; is used for the sound derived from the Common Germanic long vowel ''ē'' before a vowel.
** &lt;big&gt;''áu''&lt;/big&gt; is used for the sound derived from Common Germanic diphthong ''au''. It cannot be related to a Greek digraph, since {{lang|grc|αυ}} then represented a sequence of a vowel and a spirant ([[fricative consonant|fricative]]) consonant, which Ulfilas transcribed as ''aw'' in representing Greek words. Nevertheless, the argument based on simplicity is accepted by some influential scholars.&lt;ref name="Prokosch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt;
*The "normal environment of occurrence" refers to native words. In foreign words, these environments are often greatly disturbed. For example, the short sounds {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} alternate in native words in a nearly allophonic way, with {{IPA|/ɛ/}} occurring in native words only before the consonants {{IPA|/h/}}, {{IPA|/hʷ/}}, {{IPA|/r/}} while {{IPA|/i/}} occurs everywhere else (nevertheless, there are a few exceptions such as {{IPA|/i/}} before {{IPA|/r/}} in ''hiri'', {{IPA|/ɛ/}} consistently in the [[reduplication|reduplicating]] syllable of certain past-tense verbs regardless of the following consonant, which indicate that these sounds had become phonemicized). In foreign borrowings, however, {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} occur freely in all environments, reflecting the corresponding vowel quality in the source language.
*Paradigmatic alterations can occur either intra-paradigm (between two different forms within a specific paradigm) or cross-paradigm (between the same form in two different paradigms of the same class).  Examples of intra-paradigm alternation are {{lang|got-Latn|gawi}} {{IPA|/ɡa.wi/}} "district ({{abbr|nom.|nominative}})" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|gáujis}} {{IPA|/ɡɔː.jis/}} "district ({{abbr|gen.|genitive}})"; {{lang|got-Latn|mawi}} {{IPA|/ma.wi/}} "maiden ({{abbr|nom.|nominative}})" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|máujōs}} {{IPA|/mɔː.joːs/}} "maiden ({{abbr|gen.|genitive}})"; {{lang|got-Latn|þiwi}} {{IPA|/θi.wi/}} "maiden ({{abbr|nom.|nominative}})" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|þiujōs}} {{IPA|/θiu.joːs/}} "maiden ({{abbr|gen.|genitive}})"; {{lang|got-Latn|taui}} {{IPA|/tɔː.i/}} "deed ({{abbr|nom.|nominative}})" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|tōjis}} {{IPA|/toː.jis/}} "deed ({{abbr|gen.|genitive}})"; {{lang|got-Latn|náus}} {{IPA|/nɔːs/}} "corpse ({{abbr|nom.|nominative}})" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|naweis}} {{IPA|/na.wiːs/}} "corpses ({{abbr|nom.|nominative}})"; {{lang|got-Latn|triu}} {{IPA|/triu/}}?? "tree ({{abbr|nom.|nominative}})" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|triwis}} {{IPA|/tri.wis/}} "tree ({{abbr|gen.|genitive}})"; {{lang|got-Latn|táujan}} {{IPA|/tɔː.jan/}} "to do" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|tawida}} {{IPA|/ta.wi.ða/}} "I/he did"; {{lang|got-Latn|stōjan}} {{IPA|/stoː.jan/}} "to judge" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|stauida}} {{IPA|/stɔː.i.ða/}} "I/he judged".  Examples of cross-paradigm alternation are Class IV verbs {{lang|got-Latn|qiman}} {{IPA|/kʷiman/}} "to come" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|baíran}} {{IPA|/bɛran/}} "to carry", {{lang|got-Latn|qumans}} {{IPA|/kʷumans/}} "(having) come" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|baúrans}} {{IPA|/bɔrans/}} "(having) carried"; Class VIIb verbs {{lang|got-Latn|lētan}} {{IPA|/leː.tan/}} "to let" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|saian}} {{IPA|/sɛː.an/}} "to sow" (note similar preterites {{lang|got-Latn|laílōt}} {{IPA|/lɛ.loːt/}} "I/he let", {{lang|got-Latn|saísō}} {{IPA|/sɛ.soː/}} "I/he sowed"). A combination of intra- and cross-paradigm alternation occurs in Class V {{lang|got-Latn|sniwan}} {{IPA|/sni.wan/}} "to hasten" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|snáu}} {{IPA|/snɔː/}} "I/he hastened" (expected *''snaw'', compare {{lang|got-Latn|qiman}} "to come", {{lang|got-Latn|qam}} "I/he came").
*The carefully maintained alternations between ''iu'' and ''iw'' suggest that ''iu'' may have been something other than {{IPA|/iu/}}. Various possibilities have been suggested (for example, high central or high back unrounded vowels, such as {{IPA|[ɨ] [ʉ] [ɯ]}}); under these theories, the spelling of ''iu'' is derived from the fact that the sound alternates with ''iw'' before a vowel, based on the similar alternations ''au'' and ''aw''. The most common theory, however, simply posits {{IPA|/iu/}} as the pronunciation of ''iu''.
*Macrons represent long ''ā'' and ''ū'' (however, long i appears as ''ei'', following the representation used in the native alphabet). Macrons are often also used in the case of ''ē'' and ''ō''; however, they are sometimes omitted since these vowels are always long.  Long ''ā'' occurs only before the consonants {{IPA|/h/}}, {{IPA|/hʷ/}} and represents [[Proto-Germanic]] nasalized {{IPA|/ãː(h)/}} &lt; earlier {{IPA|/aŋ(h)/}}, still non-nasal {{IPA|/aː/}} did not occur in Proto-Germanic. It is possible that the Gothic vowel still preserved the nasalization, or else that the nasalization was lost but the length distinction kept, as has happened with [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] {{lang|lt|ą}}. Non-nasal {{IPA|/iː/}} and {{IPA|/uː/}} occurred in Proto-Germanic, however and so long ''ei'' and ''ū'' occur in all contexts. Before {{IPA|/h/}} and {{IPA|/hʷ/}}, long ''ei'' and ''ū'' could stem from either non-nasal or nasal long vowels in Proto-Germanic; it is possible that the nasalization was still preserved in Gothic but not written.

The following table shows the correspondence between spelling and sound for consonants:

*{{IPA|/hʷ/}}, which is written with a single character in the native alphabet, is transliterated using the symbol ''[[hwair|ƕ]]'', which is used only in transliterating Gothic.
*{{IPA|/kʷ/}} is similarly written with a single character in the native alphabet and is transliterated ''q'' (with no following ''u'').
*{{IPA|/ɡʷ/}}, however, is written with two letters in the native alphabet and hence ''gw''. The lack of a single letter to represent this sound may result from its restricted distribution (only after {{IPA|/n/}}) and its rarity.
*{{IPA|/θ/}} is written ''þ'', similarly to other Germanic languages.
*Although {{IPA|[ŋ]}} is the [[allophone]] of {{IPA|/n/}} occurring before {{IPA|/ɡ/}} and {{IPA|/k/}}, it is written ''g'', following the native alphabet convention (which, in turn, follows Greek usage), which leads to occasional ambiguities, e.g. {{lang|got-Latn|saggws}} {{IPA|[saŋɡʷs]}} "song" but {{lang|got-Latn|triggws}} {{IPA|[triɡɡʷs]}} "faithful" (compare English "true").

==Phonology==
It is possible to determine more or less exactly how the Gothic of [[Ulfilas]] was pronounced, primarily through comparative phonetic reconstruction. Furthermore, because Ulfilas tried to follow the original Greek text as much as possible in his translation, it is known that he used the same writing conventions as those of contemporary Greek. Since the Greek of that period is well documented, it is possible to reconstruct much of Gothic pronunciation from translated texts. In addition, the way in which non-Greek names are transcribed in the Greek Bible and in Ulfilas's Bible is very informative.

* {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} can be either long or short.&lt;ref&gt;See also {{Cite book |authorlink=Fausto Cercignani |first=Fausto |last=Cercignani |chapter=The Development of the Gothic Vocalic System |title=Germanic Dialects: Linguistic and Philological Investigations |editor1-first=Bela |editor1-last=Brogyanyi |editor2-first=Thomas |editor2-last=Krömmelbein |location=Amsterdam and Philadelphia |publisher=Benjamins |year=1986 |pages=121–151 |isbn=90-272-3526-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gothic writing distinguishes between long and short vowels only for {{IPA|/i/}} by writing ''i'' for the short form and ''ei'' for the long (a [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] or ''false diphthong''), in an imitation of Greek usage (ει = {{IPA|/iː/}}). Single vowels are sometimes long where a historically present [[nasal stop|nasal consonant]] has been dropped in front of an {{IPA|/h/}} (a case of [[compensatory lengthening]]). Thus, the preterite of the verb ''briggan'' {{IPA|[briŋɡan]}} "to bring" (English ''bring'', Dutch ''brengen'', German ''bringen'') becomes ''brahta'' {{IPA|[braːxta]}} (English ''brought'', Dutch ''bracht'',  German ''brachte''), from [[Proto-Germanic]] *''branhtē''. In detailed [[transliteration]], when the intent is more [[phonetic transcription]], length is noted by a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] (or failing that, often a [[circumflex]]): ''brāhta'', ''brâhta''. This is the only context in which {{IPA|/aː/}} appears natively whereas {{IPA|/uː/}}, like {{IPA|/iː/}}, is found often enough in other contexts: ''brūks'' "useful" (Dutch ''gebruik'', German ''Gebrauch'', Icelandic ''brúk'' "use").
* {{IPA|/eː/}} and {{IPA|/oː/}} are long [[close-mid vowel]]s. They are written as ''e'' and ''o'': ''neƕ'' {{IPA|[neːʍ]}} "near" (English ''nigh'', Dutch ''nader'', German ''nah''); ''fodjan'' {{IPA|[foːdjan]}} "to feed".
* {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/}} are short [[open-mid vowel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;For the Gothic short vowels see also {{Cite journal |first=Fausto |last=Cercignani |title=The Development of the Gothic Short/Lax Subsystem |journal=Zeitschrift für vergleichende Sprachforschung |volume=93 |issue=2 |year=1979 |pages=272–278 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are noted using the digraphs ''ai'' and ''au'': ''taihun'' {{IPA|[tɛhun]}} "ten" (Dutch ''tien'', German ''zehn'', Icelandic ''tíu''), ''dauhtar'' {{IPA|[dɔxtar]}} "daughter" (Dutch ''dochter'', German ''Tochter'', Icelandic ''dóttir''). In transliterating Gothic, accents are placed on the second vowel of these digraphs ''aí'' and ''aú'' to distinguish them from the original diphthongs ''ái'' and ''áu'': ''taíhun'', ''daúhtar''. In most cases short {{IPA|[ɛ]}} and {{IPA|[ɔ]}} are allophones of {{IPA|/i, u/}} before {{IPA|/r, h, ʍ/}}.&lt;ref&gt;But see  {{Cite journal |first=Fausto |last=Cercignani |title=The Enfants Terribles of Gothic "Breaking": hiri, aiþþau, etc. |journal=The Journal of Indo-European Studies |volume=12 |issue=3-4 |year=1984 |pages=315–344 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the reduplication syllable of the reduplicating preterites has ''ai'' as well, which was probably pronounced as a short {{IPA|[ɛ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;See also {{Cite journal |first=Fausto |last=Cercignani |title=The Reduplicating Syllable and Internal Open Juncture in Gothic |journal=Zeitschrift für vergleichende Sprachforschung |volume=93 |issue=1 |year=1979 |pages=126–132 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, short {{IPA|[ɛ]}} and {{IPA|[ɔ]}} occur in loan words from Greek and Latin (''aípiskaúpus'' {{IPA|[ɛpiskɔpus]}} = {{lang|grc|ἐπίσκοπος}} "bishop", ''laíktjo'' {{IPA|[lɛktjoː]}} = ''lectio'' "lection", ''Paúntius'' {{IPA|[pɔntius]}} = ''Pontius'').
* The Germanic [[diphthong]]s {{IPA|/ai/}} and {{IPA|/au/}} appear as [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s written {{angle bracket|ai}} and {{angle bracket|au}} in Gothic. Researchers have disagreed over whether they were still pronounced as diphthongs {{IPA|/ai̯/}} and {{IPA|/au̯/}} in Ulfilas's time (4th century) or had become long [[open-mid vowel]]s: {{IPA|/ɛː/}} and {{IPA|/ɔː/}}: ''ains'' {{IPA|[ains] / [ɛːns]}} "one" (German ''eins'', Icelandic ''einn''), ''augo'' {{IPA|[auɣoː] / [ɔːɣoː]}} "eye" (German ''Auge'', Icelandic ''auga''). It is most likely that the latter view is correct, as it is indisputable that the digraphs {{angle bracket|ai}} and {{angle bracket|au}} represent the sounds {{IPA|/ɛː/}} and {{IPA|/ɔː/}} in some circumstances (see below), and {{angle bracket|aj}} and {{angle bracket|aw}} were available to unambiguously represent the sounds {{IPA|/ai̯/}} and {{IPA|/au̯/}}. The digraph {{angle bracket|aw}} is in fact used to represent {{IPA|/au/}} in foreign words (such as ''Pawlus'' "Paul"), and alternations between {{angle bracket|ai}}/{{angle bracket|aj}} and {{angle bracket|au}}/{{angle bracket|aw}} are scrupulously maintained in paradigms were both variants occur (e.g. ''taujan'' "to do" vs. past tense ''tawida'' "did"). Evidence from transcriptions of Gothic names into Latin suggests that the sound change had occurred very recently when Gothic spelling was standardized: Gothic names with Germanic ''au'' are rendered with ''au'' in Latin until the 4th century and ''o'' later on (''Austrogoti'' &gt; ''Ostrogoti''). The digraphs {{angle bracket|ai}} and {{angle bracket|au}} are normally written with an accent on the first vowel (''ái, áu'') when they correspond to Proto-Germanic {{IPA|/ai̯/}} and {{IPA|/au̯/}}.
* Long {{IPA|[ɛː]}} and {{IPA|[ɔː]}} also occur as allophones of {{IPA|/eː/}} and {{IPA|/uː, oː/}} respectively before a following vowel: ''waian'' {{IPA|[wɛːan]}} "to blow" (Dutch ''waaien'', German ''wehen''), ''bauan'' {{IPA|[bɔːan]}} "to build" (Dutch ''bouwen'', German "bauen", Icelandic ''búa'' "to live, reside"), also in Greek words ''Trauada'' "Troad" (Gk. {{lang|grc|Τρῳάς}}). In detailed transcription these are notated ''ai, au''.
* {{IPA|/y/}} (pronounced like German ''ü'' and French ''u'') is a Greek sound used only in borrowed words. It is transliterated as ''w'' (as it uses the same letter that otherwise denoted the consonant {{IPA|/w/}}): ''azwmus'' {{IPA|[azymus]}} "unleavened bread" ( &lt; Gk. {{lang|grc|ἄζυμος}}). It represents an υ (y) or the diphthong οι (oi), both of which were pronounced {{IPA|[y]}} in the Greek of the time. Since the sound was foreign to Gothic, it was perhaps pronounced {{IPA|[i]}}.
* {{IPA|/iu/}} is a falling [[diphthong]] ({{IPA|[iu̯]}}: ''diups'' {{IPA|[diu̯ps]}} "deep" (Dutch ''diep'', German ''tief'', Icelandic ''djúpur'').
* Greek diphthongs: In [[Ulfilas]]'s era, all the diphthongs of Classical Greek had become simple vowels in speech (''[[monophthong]]ization''), except for αυ (au) and ευ (eu), which were probably still pronounced {{IPA|[aβ]}} and {{IPA|[ɛβ]}}. (They evolved into {{IPA|[av~af]}} and {{IPA|[ev~ef]}} in [[Modern Greek]].) Ulfilas notes them, in words borrowed from Greek, as ''aw'' and ''aiw'', probably pronounced {{IPA|[au̯, ɛu̯]}}: ''Pawlus'' {{IPA|[pau̯lus]}} "Paul" (Gk. {{lang|grc|Παῦλος}}), ''aíwaggelista'' {{IPA|[ɛwaŋɡeːlista]}} "evangelist" (Gk. {{lang|grc|εὐαγγελιστής}}, via the Latin ''evangelista'').
* All vowels (including diphthongs) can be followed by a {{IPA|[w]}}, which was likely pronounced as the second element of a diphthong with roughly the sound of {{IPA|[u̯]}}. It seems likely that this is more of an instance of phonetic juxtaposition than of true diphthongs (such as, for example, the sound {{IPA|/aj/}} in the French word ''paille'' ("straw"), which is not the diphthong {{IPA|/ai̯/}} but rather a vowel followed by an [[approximant]]): ''alew'' {{IPA|[aleːw]}} "olive oil" ( &lt; Latin ''oleum''), ''snáiws'' {{IPA|[snɛːws]}} ("snow"), ''lasiws'' {{IPA|[lasiws]}} "tired" (English ''lazy'').

In general, Gothic consonants are [[final devoicing|devoiced]] at the ends of words. Gothic is rich in fricative consonants (although many of them may have been [[approximant]]s, it is hard to separate the two) derived by the processes described in [[Grimm's law]] and [[Verner's law]] and characteristic of [[Germanic languages]]. Gothic is unusual among Germanic languages in having a {{IPA|/z/}} phoneme, which has not become {{IPA|/r/}} through rhotacization. Furthermore, the doubling of written consonants between vowels suggests that Gothic made distinctions between long and short, or [[gemination|geminated]] consonants: ''atta'' {{IPA|[atːa]}} "dad", ''kunnan'' {{IPA|[kunːan]}} "to know" (Dutch ''kennen'', German ''kennen'' "to know", Icelandic ''kunna'').

====Stops====
* The voiceless stops {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} are regularly noted by ''p'', ''t'' and ''k'' respectively: ''paska'' {{IPA|[paska]}} "Easter" (from the Greek {{lang|grc|πάσχα}}), ''tuggo'' {{IPA|[tuŋɡoː]}} "tongue", ''kalbo'' {{IPA|[kalboː]}} "calf".
* The letter ''q'' is probably a [[labialized voiceless velar plosive|voiceless labiovelar stop]], {{IPA|/kʷ/}}, comparable to the Latin ''qu'': ''qiman'' {{IPA|[kʷiman]}} "to come". In later Germanic languages, this phoneme has become either a [[consonant cluster]] {{IPA|/kw/}} of a [[voiceless velar stop]] + a [[labio-velar approximant]] (English ''qu'') or a simple voiceless velar stop {{IPA|/k/}} (English ''c, k'')
* The voiced stops {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} are noted by the letters ''b'', ''d'' and ''g''. Like the other Germanic languages, they occurred in word-initial position, when doubled and after a nasal. In addition, they apparently occurred after other consonants,: ''arbi'' {{IPA|[arbi]}} "inheritance", ''huzd'' {{IPA|[huzd]}} "treasure". (This conclusion is based on their behavior at the end of a word, in which they do not change into voiceless fricatives, unlike when they occur after a vowel.)
* There was probably also a [[voiced velar plosive|voiced labiovelar stop]], {{IPA|/ɡʷ/}}, which was written with the digraph ''gw''. It occurred after a nasal, e.g. ''saggws'' {{IPA|[saŋɡʷs]}} "song", or long as a regular outcome of Germanic *''ww'': ''triggws'' {{IPA|[triɡʷːs]}} "faithful" (English ''true'', German ''treu'', Icelandic ''tryggur'').
* Similarly, the letters ''ddj'', which is the regular outcome of Germanic *''jj'', may represent a voiced palatal stop, {{IPA|/ɟː/}}: ''waddjus'' {{IPA|[waɟːus]}} "wall" (Icelandic ''veggur''), ''twaddje'' {{IPA|[twaɟːeː]}} "two (genitive)" (Icelandic ''tveggja'').

====Fricatives====
* {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}} are usually written ''s'' and ''z''. The latter corresponds to Germanic *''z'' (which has become ''r'' or silent in the other Germanic languages); at the end of a word, it is regularly devoiced to ''s''. E.g. ''saíhs'' {{IPA|[sɛhs]}} "six", ''máiza'' {{IPA|[mɛːza]}} "greater" (English ''more'', Dutch ''meer'', German ''mehr'', Icelandic ''meira'') versus ''máis'' {{IPA|[mɛːs]}} "more, rather".
* {{IPA|/ɸ/}} and {{IPA|/θ/}}, written ''f'' and ''þ'', are voiceless bilabial and voiceless dental fricatives respectively. It is likely that the relatively unstable sound {{IPA|/ɸ/}} became {{IPA|/f/}}. ''f'' and ''þ'' are also derived from ''b'' and ''d'' at the ends of words and then are devoiced and become approximants: ''gif'' {{IPA|[ɡiɸ]}} "give (imperative)" (infinitive ''giban'': German ''geben''), ''miþ'' {{IPA|[miθ]}} "with" ([[Old English language|Old English]] ''mid'', [[Old Norse]] ''með'', Dutch ''met'', German ''mit'').
* {{IPA|/h/}} is written as ''h'': ''haban'' "to have". It was probably pronounced {{IPA|[h]}} in word-final position and before a consonant as well (not {{IPA|[x]}}, since {{IPA|/ɡ/}} &gt; {{IPA|[x]}} is written ''g'', not ''h''): ''jah'' {{IPA|[jah]}} "and" (Dutch, German, Scandinavian ''ja'' "yes").
* {{IPA|[x]}} is an allophone of {{IPA|/ɡ/}} at the end of a word or before a voiceless consonant; it is always written ''g'': ''dags'' {{IPA|[daxs]}} "day" (German ''Tag''). In some borrowed Greek words is the special letter ''x'', which represents the Greek letter χ (''ch''): ''Xristus'' {{IPA|[xristus]}} "Christ" (Gk. {{lang|grc|Χριστός}}). It may also have signified a {{IPA|/k/}}.
* {{IPA|[β]}}, {{IPA|[ð]}} and {{IPA|[ɣ]}} are voiced fricative found only in between vowels. They are [[allophones]] of {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} and are not distinguished from them in writing. {{IPA|[β]}} may have become {{IPA|/v/}}, a more stable labiodental form. In the study of Germanic languages, these phonemes are usually transcribed as ''ƀ'', ''đ'' and ''ǥ'' respectively: ''haban'' {{IPA|[haβan]}} "to have", ''þiuda'' {{IPA|[θiu̯ða]}} "people" (Dutch ''Diets'',  German ''Deutsch'', Icelandic ''þjóð'' &gt; English ''Dutch''), ''áugo'' {{IPA|[ɔːɣoː]}} "eye" (English ''eye'', Dutch ''oog'', German ''Auge'', Icelandic ''auga''). When occurring after a vowel at the end of a word or before a voiceless consonant, these sounds become unvoiced {{IPA|[ɸ]}}, {{IPA|[θ]}} and {{IPA|[x]}}, e.g. ''hláifs'' {{IPA|[hlɛːɸs]}} "loaf" but genitive ''hláibis'' {{IPA|[hlɛːβis]}} "of a loaf", plural ''hláibōs'' {{IPA|[hlɛːβoːs]}} "loaves".
* ''ƕ'' (also transcribed ''hw'') is the labiovelar equivalent of {{IPA|/x/}}, derived from Proto-Indo-European *kʷ. It was probably pronounced {{IPA|[ʍ]}} (a voiceless {{IPA|[w]}}), as ''wh'' is pronounced in certain dialects of English and in Scots: ''ƕan'' {{IPA|/ʍan/}} "when", ''ƕar'' {{IPA|/ʍar/}} "where", ''ƕeits'' {{IPA|[ʍiːts]}} "white".

====Sonorants====
Gothic has three nasal consonants, one of which is an allophone of the others, all found only in [[complementary distribution]] with them. Nasals in Gothic, like most other languages, are pronounced at the same [[point of articulation]] as either the consonant that follows them ([[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]]). Therefore, clusters like {{IPA|[md]}} and {{IPA|[nb]}} are not possible.
* {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/m/}} are freely distributed and so can be found in any position in a syllable and form [[minimal pair]]s except in certain contexts where they are neutralized: {{IPA|/n/}} before a [[bilabial consonant]] becomes {{IPA|[m]}}, while {{IPA|/m/}} preceding a [[Dental consonant|dental stop]] becomes {{IPA|[n]}}, as per the principle of assimilation described in the previous paragraph. In front of a [[velat consonant|velar stop]], they both become {{IPA|[ŋ]}}. {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/m/}} are transcribed as ''n'' and ''m'', and, in writing, neutralisation is marked: ''sniumundo'' {{IPA|/sniu̯mundoː/}} ("quickly").
* {{IPA|[ŋ]}} is not a phoneme and cannot appear freely in Gothic. It is present where a nasal consonant is neutralised before a velar stop and is in a complementary distribution with {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/m/}}. Following Greek conventions, it is normally written as ''g'' (sometimes ''n''): ''þagkjan'' {{IPA|[θaŋkjan]}} "to think", ''sigqan'' {{IPA|[siŋkʷan]}} "to sink" ~ ''þankeiþ'' {{IPA|[θaŋkiːθ]}} "thinks". The cluster ''ggw'' sometimes denotes {{IPA|[ŋɡʷ]}}, but sometimes {{IPA|[ɡʷː]}} (see above).
* {{IPA|/w/}} is transliterated as ''w'' before a vowel: ''weis'' {{IPA|[wiːs]}} ("we"), ''twái'' {{IPA|[twai]}} "two" (German ''zwei'').
* {{IPA|/j/}} is written as ''j'': ''jer'' {{IPA|[jeːr]}} "year", ''sakjo'' {{IPA|[sakjoː]}} "strife".
* {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/r/}} occur as in other European languages: ''laggs'' (possibly {{IPA|[laŋɡs]}}, {{IPA|[laŋks]}} or {{IPA|[laŋɡz]}}) "long", ''mel'' {{IPA|[meːl]}} "hour" (English ''meal'', Dutch ''maal'', German ''Mahl'', Icelandic ''mál'').  The exact pronunciation of {{IPA|/r/}} is unknown, but it is usually assumed to be a [[Trill consonant|trill]] {{IPA|[r]}} or a [[Flap consonant|flap]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}}): ''raíhts'' {{IPA|[rɛxts]}} "right", ''afar'' {{IPA|[afar]}} "after".
* {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/m/}}, {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/r/}} may occur either between two other consonants of lower sonority or word-finally after a consonant of lower sonority. It is probable that the sounds are pronounced partly or completely as [[syllabic consonant]]s in such circumstances (as in English "bottle" or "bottom"): ''tagl'' {{IPA|[taɣl̩]}} or {{IPA|[taɣl]}} "hair" (English ''tail'', Icelandic ''tagl''), ''máiþms'' {{IPA|[mɛːθm̩s]}} or {{IPA|[mɛːθms]}} "gift", ''táikns'' {{IPA|[tɛːkn̩s]}} or {{IPA|[tɛːkns]}} "sign" (English ''token'', Dutch ''teken'', German ''Zeichen'', Icelandic ''tákn'') and ''tagr'' {{IPA|[taɣr̩]}} or {{IPA|[taɣr]}} "tear (as in crying)".

===Accentuation and intonation===
Accentuation in Gothic can be reconstructed through phonetic comparison, [[Grimm's law]] and [[Verner's law]]. Gothic used a [[stress accent]] rather than the [[pitch accent]] of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]. This is indicated by the shortening of long vowels {{IPA|[eː]}} and {{IPA|[oː]}} and the loss of short vowels {{IPA|[a]}} and {{IPA|[i]}} in unstressed final syllables.

Just as in other [[Germanic languages]], the free moving [[Proto-Indo-European accent]] was replaced with one fixed on the first syllable of simple words. Accents do not shift when words are [[inflection|inflected]]. In most compound words, the location of the stress depends on the type of compound:

* In compounds in which the second word is a ''noun'', the accent is on the first syllable of the first word of the compound.
* In compounds in which the second word is a ''verb'', the accent falls on the first syllable of the verbal component. Elements prefixed to verbs are otherwise unstressed except in the context of separable words (words that can be broken in two parts and separated in regular usage such as [[separable verb]]s in German and Dutch). In those cases, the prefix is stressed.

For example, with comparable words from modern Germanic languages:
* Non-compound words: ''marka'' {{IPA|[ˈmarka]}} "border, borderlands" (English ''march'', Dutch ''mark''); ''aftra'' {{IPA|[ˈaɸtra]}} "after"; ''bidjan'' {{IPA|[ˈbiðjan]}} "pray" (Dutch, ''bidden'', German ''bitten'', Icelandic ''biðja'', English ''bid'').
* Compound words:
** Noun first element: ''guda-láus'' {{IPA|[ˈɡuðalɔːs]}} "godless".
** Verb second element: ''ga-láubjan'' {{IPA|[ɡaˈlɔːβjan]}} "believe" (Dutch ''geloven'', German ''glauben'' &lt; [[Old High German]] ''g(i)louben'' by [[syncope (phonetics)|syncope]] of the unaccented ''i'').

==Grammar==

===Morphology===

====Nouns and adjectives====
{{Main|Gothic declension}}
Gothic preserves many archaic Indo-European features that are not always present in modern Germanic languages, in particular the rich Indo-European [[declension]] system. Gothic had [[nominative]], [[accusative]], [[genitive]] and [[dative case]]s, as well as vestiges of a [[vocative case]] that was sometimes identical to the nominative and sometimes to the accusative. The three [[grammatical gender|genders]] of Indo-European were all present. Nouns and adjectives were inflected according to one of two [[grammatical number]]s: the singular and the plural.

Nouns can be divided into numerous declensions according to the form of the stem: ''a'', ''ō'', ''i'', ''u'', ''an'', ''ōn'', ''ein'', ''r'', etc. Adjectives have two variants, ''indefinite'' and ''definite'' (sometimes ''indeterminate'' and ''determinate''), with definite adjectives normally used in combination with the definite [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]]s (such as the [[definite article]] ''sa''/''þata''/''sō'') while indefinite adjectives are used in other circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ratkus |first1=Artūras |title=Weak adjectives need not be definite |journal=Indogermanische Forschungen |date=1 August 2018 |volume=123 |issue=1 |pages=27–64 |doi=10.1515/if-2018-0002}}&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ratkus |first1=Artūras |title=This is not the same: the ambiguity of a Gothic adjective |journal=Folia Linguistica Historica |date=25 October 2018 |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=475–494 |doi=10.1515/flih-2018-0017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indefinite adjectives generally use a combination of ''a''-stem and ''ō''-stem endings, and definite adjectives use a combination of ''an''-stem and ''ōn''-stem endings. The concept of "strong" and "weak" declensions that is prevalent in the grammar of many other [[Germanic languages]] is less significant in Gothic because of its conservative nature: the so-called "weak" declensions (those ending in ''n'') are, in fact, no weaker in Gothic (in terms of having fewer endings) than the "strong" declensions (those ending in a vowel), and the "strong" declensions do not form a coherent class that can be clearly distinguished from the "weak" declensions.

Although descriptive adjectives in Gothic (as well as superlatives ending in ''-ist'' and ''-ost'') and the [[past participle]] may take both definite and indefinite forms, some adjectival words are restricted to one variant. Some pronouns take only definite forms: for example, ''sama'' (English "same"), adjectives like ''unƕeila'' ("constantly", from the root ''ƕeila'', "time"; compare to the English "while"), comparative adjective and [[present participle]]s. Others, such as ''áins'' ("some"), take only the indefinite forms.

The table below displays the declension of the Gothic adjective ''blind'' (English: "blind"), compared with the ''an''-stem noun ''guma'' "man"(human) and the ''a''-stem noun ''dags'' "day":

This table is, of course, not exhaustive.  (There are secondary inflexions of various sorts not described here.) An exhaustive table of only the ''types'' of endings that Gothic took is presented below.

* '''vowel declensions''':
** roots ending in ''-a'', ''-ja'', ''-wa'' (masculine and neuter): equivalent to the Greek and Latin second declension in ''‑us'' / ''‑ī'' and ‑ος / ‑ου;
** roots ending in ''-ō'', ''-jō'' and ''-wō'' (feminine): equivalent to the Greek and Latin first declension in ''‑a'' / ''‑ae'' and ‑α / ‑ας (‑η / ‑ης);
** roots ending in ''-i'' (masculine and feminine): equivalent to the Greek and Latin third declension in ''‑is'' / ''‑is'' ({{abbr|abl.|ablative}} {{abbr|sg.|singular}} ''‑ī'', {{abbr|gen.|genitive}} {{abbr|pl.|plural}} ''-ium'') and ‑ις / ‑εως;
** roots ending in ''-u'' (all three genders): equivalent to the Latin fourth declension in ''‑us'' / ''‑ūs'' and the Greek third declension in ‑υς / ‑εως;
* '''''n''-stem declensions''', equivalent to the Greek and Latin third declension in ''‑ō'' / ''‑inis/ōnis'' and ‑ων / ‑ονος or ‑ην / ‑ενος:
** roots ending in ''-an'', ''-jan'', ''-wan'' (masculine);
** roots ending in ''-ōn'' and ''-ein'' (feminine);
** roots ending in ''-n'' (neuter): equivalent to the Greek and Latin third declension in ''‑men'' / ''‑minis'' and ‑μα / ‑ματος;
* '''minor declensions''': roots ending in ''-r'', ''-nd'' and vestigial endings in other consonants, equivalent to other third declensions in Greek and Latin.

Gothic adjectives follow noun declensions closely; they take same types of inflexion.

====Pronouns====
{{Main|Gothic declension#Pronouns|l1=Gothic declension: Pronouns}}
Gothic inherited the full set of Indo-European pronouns: [[personal pronoun]]s (including [[reflexive pronoun]]s for each of the three [[grammatical person]]s), [[possessive pronoun]]s, both simple and compound [[demonstrative pronoun|demonstratives]], [[relative pronoun]]s, [[interrogative pronoun|interrogatives]] and [[indefinite pronoun]]s. Each follows a particular pattern of inflexion (partially mirroring the noun declension), much like other Indo-European languages. One particularly noteworthy characteristic is the preservation of the [[dual grammatical number|dual number]], referring to two people or things; the plural was used only for quantities greater than two. Thus, "the two of us" and "we" for numbers greater than two were expressed as ''wit'' and ''weis'' respectively. While [[Proto-Indo-European language|proto-Indo-European]] used the dual for all grammatical categories that took a number (as did Classical [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Sanskrit]]), most Old Germanic languages are unusual in that they preserved it only for pronouns.  Gothic preserves an older system with dual marking on both pronouns and verbs (but not nouns or adjectives).

The simple demonstrative pronoun ''sa'' (neuter: ''þata'', feminine: ''so'', from the Indo-European root ''*so'', ''*seh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''*tod''; cognate to the [[Greek language|Greek]] article ὁ, ἡ, τό and the [[Latin]] ''is'''tud''''') can be used as an article, allowing constructions of the type ''definite article + weak adjective + noun''.

The interrogative pronouns begin with ''ƕ-'', which derives from the proto-Indo-European consonant ''*kʷ'' that was present at the beginning of all interrogratives in proto-Indo-European.  That is cognate with the ''wh-'' at the beginning of many English interrogative, which, as in Gothic, are pronounced with {{IPA|[ʍ]}} in some dialects. The same etymology is present in the interrogatives of many other Indo-European languages": ''w-'' {{IPA|[v]}} in [[German language|German]], ''hv-'' in [[Danish language|Danish]], the [[Latin]] ''qu-'' (which persists in modern [[Romance languages]]), the [[Greek language|Greek]] τ- or π-, the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] and [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indic]] ''k-'' as well as many others.

====Verbs====
{{Main|Gothic verbs}}
The bulk of Gothic verbs follow the type of Indo-European conjugation called '[[thematic stem|thematic]]' because they insert a vowel derived from the reconstructed proto-Indo-European phonemes ''*e'' or ''*o'' between roots and inflexional suffixes. The pattern is also present in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]]:
*Latin - ''leg-i-mus'' ("we read"): root ''leg-'' + thematic vowel ''-i-'' (from ''*o'') + suffix ''-mus''.
*Greek - λύ-ο-μεν ("we untie"): root λυ- + thematic vowel -ο- + suffix -μεν.
*Gothic - ''nim-a-m'' ("we take"):  root ''nim-'' + thematic vowel ''-a-'' (from ''*o'') + suffix ''-m''.

The other conjugation, called '[[athematic]]', in which suffixes are added directly to roots, exists only in unproductive vestigial forms in Gothic, just like in Greek and Latin. The most important such instance is [[Indo-European copula|the verb "to be"]], which is athematic in Greek, Latin, Sanskrit and many other Indo-European languages.

Gothic verbs are, like nouns and adjectives, divided into strong verbs and weak verbs. Weak verbs are characterised by [[preterite]]s formed by appending the suffixes ''-da'' or ''-ta'', parallel to past participles formed with ''-þ'' / ''-t''. Strong verbs form preterites by [[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]] (the alternating of vowels in their root forms) or by [[reduplication]] (prefixing the root with the first consonant in the root plus ''aí'') but without adding a suffix in either case. That parallels the Greek and Sanskrit [[perfect (grammar)|perfects]].  The dichotomy is still present in modern Germanic languages:
* weak verbs ("to have"):
** Gothic: ''haban'', preterite: ''habái'''da''''', past participle: ''habái'''þ'''s'';
** English: ''(to) have'', preterite: ''ha'''d''''', past participle: ''ha'''d''''';
** German: ''haben'', preterite: ''hat'''te''''', past participle: ''gehab'''t''''';
** Icelandic: ''hafa'', preterite: ''haf'''ði''''', past participle: ''haf'''t''''';
** Dutch: ''hebben'', preterite: ''ha'''d''''', past participle: ''geha'''d''''';
** Swedish: ''ha(va)'', preterite: ''ha'''d'''e'', supine: ''haf'''t''''';
* strong verbs ("to give"):
** Gothic: infinitive: ''g'''i'''ban'', preterite: ''g'''a'''f'';
** English: infinitive: ''(to) g'''i'''ve'', preterite: ''g'''a'''ve'';
** German: infinitive: ''g'''e'''ben'', preterite: ''g'''a'''b'';
** Icelandic: infinitive: ''g'''e'''fa'', preterite: ''g'''a'''f'';
** Dutch: infinitive: ''g'''e'''ven'', preterite: ''g'''a'''f'';
** Swedish: infinitive: ''g'''i'''va'' (''ge''), preterite: ''g'''a'''v''.

Verbal conjugation in Gothic have two [[grammatical voice]]s: the active and the medial; three numbers: singular, dual (except in the third person) and plural; two tenses: present and preterite (derived from a former perfect); three [[grammatical mood]]s: [[indicative mood|indicative]], [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] (from an old [[optative mood|optative]] form) and [[imperative mood|imperative]] as well as three kinds of nominal forms: a present [[infinitive]], a present [[participle]], and a past [[passive voice|passive]]. Not all tenses and persons are represented in all moods and voices, as some conjugations use [[auxiliary verb|auxiliary forms]].

Finally, there are forms called 'preterite-present': the old Indo-European perfect was reinterpreted as present tense. The Gothic word ''wáit'', from the proto-Indo-European ''*woid-h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e'' ("to see" in the perfect), corresponds exactly to its Sanskrit cognate ''véda'' and in Greek to ϝοἶδα. Both etymologically should mean "I have seen" (in the perfect sense) but mean "I know" (in the preterite-present meaning). Latin follows the same rule with ''nōuī'' ("I have learned" and "I know"). The preterite-present verbs include ''áigan'' ("to possess") and ''kunnan'' ("to know") among others.

===Syntax===

==== Word order ====
The word order of Gothic is fairly free as is typical of other inflected languages. The natural word order of Gothic is assumed to have been like that of the other old Germanic languages; however, nearly all extant Gothic texts are translations of Greek originals and have been heavily influenced by Greek syntax.

Sometimes what can be expressed in one word in the original Greek will require a verb and a complement in the Gothic translation; for example, διωχθήσονται (''diōchthēsontai'', "they will be persecuted") is rendered:
:{|
|''wrakos''||''winnand''||(2 Timothy 3:12)
|-
|persecution-{{abbr|{{sc|pl}}|plural}}-{{abbr|{{sc|acc}}|accusative}}||suffer-{{abbr|{{sc|3pl}}|third person plural}}
|-
|colspan=3|"they will suffer persecution"
|}
Likewise Gothic translations of Greek noun phrases may feature a verb and a complement. In both cases, the verb follows the complement, giving weight to the theory that basic word order in Gothic is object–verb. This aligns with what is known of other early Germanic languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eythórsson |first=Thórhallur |editor-last1=Thráinsson |editor-first1=Höskuldur |editor-last2=Epstein |editor-first2=Samuel David |editor-last3=Peter |editor-first3=Stever |title=Studies in Comparative Germanic Syntax |volume=II |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |date=2001 |pages=109-10 |chapter=Functional Categories, Cliticization, and Verb Movement in the Early Germanic Languages |isbn=978-1-402-00294-6 |lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this pattern is reversed in imperatives and negations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eythórsson |first=Thórhallur |editor-last1=Thráinsson |editor-first1=Höskuldur |editor-last2=Epstein |editor-first2=Samuel David |editor-last3=Peter |editor-first3=Stever |title=Studies in Comparative Germanic Syntax |volume=II |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |date=2001 |pages=110 |chapter=Functional Categories, Cliticization, and Verb Movement in the Early Germanic Languages |isbn=978-1-402-00294-6 |lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

|-
|colspan=6|"What shall the child become?"
|}

====Clitics====
Gothic has two [[clitic]] particles placed in the second position in a sentence, in accordance with [[Wackernagel's Law]].

One such clitic particle is -''u'', indicating a yes–no question or an indirect question, like Latin -''ne'':

:{|
|''ni-'''u'''''||''taíhun''||''þái''||''gahráinidái''||''waúrþun?''||(Luke 17:17)
|-
|not-'''{{abbr|{{sc|q}}|question}}'''||ten||that-{{abbr|{{sc|masc}}|masculine}}-{{abbr|{{sc|pl}}|plural}}||cleanse-{{abbr|{{sc|pp}}|past participle}}-{{abbr|{{sc|masc}}|masculine}}-{{abbr|{{sc|pl}}|plural}}||become-{{abbr|{{sc|3pl}}|third person plural}}-{{abbr|{{sc|pst}}|past}}
|-
|colspan=6|"Were there not ten that were cleansed?"
|}
:{|
|''ei''||''saíƕam''||''qimái-'''u'''''||''Helias''||''nasjan''||''ina''||(Matthew 27:49)
|-
|that||see-{{abbr|{{sc|1pl}}|first person plural}}||come-{{abbr|{{sc|3sg}}|third person singular}}-{{abbr|{{sc|opt}}|optative}}-'''{{abbr|{{sc|q}}|question}}'''||Elias||save-{{abbr|{{sc|inf}}|infinitive}}||he-{{abbr|{{sc|acc}}|accusative}}
|-
|colspan=7|"that we see whether or not Elias will come to save him"
|}

It should be noted that the prepositional phrase without the clitic -''u'' appears as ''af þus silbin'': the clitic causes the reversion of originally voiced fricatives, unvoiced at the end of a word, to their voiced form; another such example is ''wileid-u'' "do you ({{abbr|pl.|plural}}) want" from ''wileiþ'' "you ({{abbr|pl.|plural}}) want". If the first word has a [[preverb]] attached, the clitic actually splits the preverb from the verb: ''ga-u-láubjats'' "do you both believe...?" from ''galáubjats'' "you both believe".

Another such clitic is ''-uh'' "and", appearing as ''-h'' after a vowel: ''ga-h-mēlida'' "and he wrote" from ''gamēlida'' "he wrote", ''urreis nim-uh'' "arise and take!" from the imperative form ''nim'' "take".  After ''iþ'' or any indefinite besides ''sums'' "some" and ''anþar'' "another", -''uh'' cannot be placed; in the latter category, this is only because indefinite [[determiner phrases]] cannot move to the front of a clause. It should be pointed out that, unlike, for example, Latin -''que'', -''uh'' can only join two or more main clauses. In all other cases, the word ''jah'' "and" is used, which can also join main clauses.

More than one such clitics can occur in one word: ''diz-uh-þan-sat ijōs'' "and then he seized them ({{abbr|fem.|feminine}})" from ''dissat'' "he seized" (notice again the voicing of ''diz-''), ''ga-u-ƕa-sēƕi'' "whether he saw anything" from ''gasēƕi'' "he saw".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eythórsson |first=Thórhallur |editor-last1=Thráinsson |editor-first1=Höskuldur |editor-last2=Epstein |editor-first2=Samuel David |editor-last3=Peter |editor-first3=Stever |title=Studies in Comparative Germanic Syntax |volume=II |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |date=2001 |pages=117-18, 122 |chapter=Functional Categories, Cliticization, and Verb Movement in the Early Germanic Languages |isbn=978-1-402-00294-6 |lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to other Germanic languages==
For the most part, Gothic is known to be significantly closer to Proto-Germanic than any other Germanic language except for that of the (scantily attested) early Norse runic inscriptions, which has made it invaluable in the reconstruction of Proto-Germanic. In fact, Gothic tends to serve as the primary foundation for reconstructing Proto-Germanic. The reconstructed Proto-Germanic conflicts with Gothic only when there is clearly identifiable evidence from other branches that the Gothic form is a secondary development.

===Distinctive features===
Gothic fails to display a number of innovations shared by all Germanic languages attested later:
*Lack of [[Germanic umlaut]]
*Lack of [[Rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]]

The language has also preserved many features that have been lost mostly in other early Germanic languages:
*Dual inflections on verbs
*Morphological passive voice for verbs
*Reduplication in the past tense of Class VII strong verbs
*Clitic conjunctions that appear in second position of a sentence in accordance with [[Wackernagel's Law]], splitting verbs from pre-verbs.

====Lack of umlaut====
Most conspicuously, Gothic shows no sign of morphological [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]]. Gothic ''fotus'', {{abbr|pl.|plural}} ''fotjus'', can be contrasted with English ''foot'' : ''feet'', German ''Fuß'' : ''Füße'', Old Icelandic ''fótr'' : ''fœtr'', Danish ''fod'' : ''fødder''. These forms contain the characteristic change {{IPA|/oː/}} &gt; {{IPA|/øː/}} (&gt; English {{IPA|/iː/}}, German {{IPA|/yː/}}) due to i-umlaut; the Gothic form shows no such change.

====Lack of rhotacism====
Proto-Germanic *''z'' remains in Gothic as ''z'' or is devoiced to ''s''. In North and West Germanic, *''z'' changes to ''r'' by [[Rhotacism (sound change)#Germanic languages|rhotacism]].
* Gothic ''dius'', [[genitive case|{{abbr|gen.|genitive}}]] {{abbr|sg.|singular}} ''diuzis''
* Old English ''dēor'', {{abbr|gen.|genitive}} {{abbr|sg.|singular}} ''dēores'' "wild animal" (Modern English ''deer'')

====Passive voice====
Gothic retains a morphological passive voice inherited from Indo-European but unattested in all other Germanic languages except for the single fossilised form preserved in, for example, Old English ''hātte'' or Runic Norse ({{circa|400}}) ''haitē'' "am called", derived from Proto-Germanic ''*haitaną'' "to call, command". (It should be noted that the related verbs ''heißen'' in modern German and ''heten'' in Dutch are both derived from the active voice of this verb but have the passive meaning "to be called" alongside the dated active meaning "to command".)

The morphological passive in North Germanic languages (Swedish ''gör'' "does", ''görs'' "is being done") originates from the [[Old Norse]] [[Old Norse morphology#Suffixes and clitics|middle voice]], which is an innovation not inherited from Indo-European.

====Dual number====
Unlike other Germanic languages, which retained [[dual grammatical number|dual number]] marking only in some pronoun forms, Gothic has dual forms both in pronouns and in verbs. Dual verb forms exist in the first and second person only and only in the active voice; in all other cases, the corresponding plural forms are used.  In pronouns, Gothic has first and second person dual pronouns: Gothic/Old English/Old Norse ''wit'' "we two" (thought to have been in fact derived from ''*wi-du'' literally "we two").

====Reduplication====
Gothic possesses a number of verbs which form their preterite by reduplication, another archaic feature inherited from Indo-European. While traces of this category survived elsewhere in Germanic, the phenomenon is largely obscured in these other languages by later sound changes and analogy. In the following examples the infinitive is compared to the third person singular preterite indicative:

* Gothic ''saian'' "to sow" : '''''sai'''so''
* Old Norse ''sá'' : '''''se'''ri'' &lt; Proto-Germanic *'''''se'''zō''
* Gothic ''laikan'' "to play" : ''lailaik''
* Old English ''lācan'' : '''''leo'''lc'', ''lēc''

===Classification===
The standard theory of the origin of the Germanic languages divides the languages into three groups: [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]] (Gothic and a few other very scantily-attested languages), [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] and its derivatives, such as [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], and [[Faroese language|Faroese]]) and [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] (all others, including [[Old English]], [[Old High German]], [[Old Saxon]], [[Old Low Franconian]], [[Old Frisian]] and the numerous modern languages derived from these, including [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], and [[Dutch language|Dutch]]). Sometimes, a further grouping, that of the [[Northwest Germanic]] languages, is posited as containing the North Germanic and West Germanic languages, reflecting the hypothesis that Gothic was the first attested language to branch off.

A minority opinion (the so-called Gotho-Nordic Hypothesis) instead groups North Germanic and [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]] together. It is based partly on historical claims: for example, [[Jordanes]], writing in the 6th century, ascribes to the Goths a Scandinavian origin. There are a few linguistically significant areas in which Gothic and Old Norse agree against the West Germanic languages.

Perhaps the most obvious is the evolution of the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] *''-jj-'' and *''-ww-'' into Gothic ''ddj'' (from Pre-Gothic ''ggj''?) and ''ggw'', and Old Norse ''ggj'' and ''ggv'' ("[[Holtzmann's Law]]"), in contrast to West Germanic where they remained as semivowels. Compare Modern English ''true'', German ''treu'', with Gothic ''triggws'', Old Norse ''tryggr''.

However, it has been suggested that these are, in fact, two separate and unrelated changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=J. B. |last=Voyles |title=Early Germanic Grammar |year=1992 |location=San Diego |publisher=Academic Press |pages=25–26 |isbn=0-12-728270-X}}
&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other posited similarities exist (for example, the existence of numerous inchoative verbs ending in -''na'', such as Gothic ''ga-waknan'', Old Norse ''vakna''; and the absence of gemination before ''j'', or (in the case of old Norse) only ''g'' geminated before ''j'', e.g. Proto-Germanic *''kunją'' &gt; Gothic ''kuni'' (kin), Old Norse ''kyn'', but Old English ''cynn'', Old High German ''kunni''). However, for the most part these represent [[Comparative method#Terminology|shared retentions]], which are not valid means of grouping languages. That is, if a parent language splits into three daughters A, B and C, and C innovates in a particular area but A and B do not change, A and B will appear to agree against C. That shared retention in A and B is not necessarily indicative of any special relationship between the two.

Similar claims of similarities between [[Old Gutnish]] (''Gutniska'') and [[Old Icelandic]] are also based on shared retentions rather than shared innovations.

Another commonly-given example involves Gothic and Old Norse verbs with the ending ''-t'' in the 2nd person singular preterite indicative, and the West Germanic languages have ''-i''.  The ending ''-t'' can regularly descend from the Proto-Indo-European perfect ending ''*-th₂e'', while the origin of the West Germanic ending ''-i'' (which, unlike the ''-t''-ending, unexpectedly combines with the zero-grade of the root as in the plural) is unclear, suggesting that it is an innovation of some kind, possibly an import from the optative. Another possibility is that this is an example of independent choices made from a doublet existing in the proto-language.  That is, Proto-Germanic may have allowed either ''-t'' or ''-i'' to be used as the ending, either in [[free variation]] or perhaps depending on dialects within Proto-Germanic or the particular verb in question. Each of the three daughters independently standardized on one of the two endings and, by chance, Gothic and Old Norse ended up with the same ending.

Other [[isogloss]]es have led scholars to propose an early split between East and [[Northwest Germanic]]. Furthermore, features shared by any two branches of Germanic do not necessarily require the postulation of a [[proto-language]] excluding the third, as the early [[Germanic languages]] were all part of a [[dialect continuum]] in the early stages of their development, and [[language contact|contact]] between the three branches of Germanic was extensive.

Polish linguist [[Witold Mańczak]] had argued that Gothic is closer to German (specifically [[Upper German]]) than to Scandinavian and suggests that their ancestral homeland was located southernmost part of the Germanic territories, close to present day Austria rather than in Scandinavia. [[Frederik Kortlandt]] has agreed with Mańczak's hypothesis, stating: "I think that his argument is correct and that it is time to abandon Iordanes' classic view that the Goths came from Scandinavia."&lt;ref name="Kortlandt"&gt;[http://kortlandt.nl/publications/art198e.pdf Kortlandt, "The origin of the Goths"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
The reconstructed [[Proto-Slavic]] language features several apparent [[Proto-Slavic borrowings|borrowed words]] from East Germanic (presumably Gothic), such as ''xlěbъ'', "bread", vs. Gothic ''hlaifs''.&lt;ref&gt;

== Use in Romanticism and the Modern Age ==

Several linguists have made use of Gothic as a creative language. The most famous example is ''Bagme Bloma'' ("Flower of the Trees") by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], part of ''[[Songs for the Philologists]]''. It was published privately in 1936 for Tolkien and his colleague E. V. Gordon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shippey|first1=Tom|title=The road to Middle-earth: Revised and Expanded edition|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|isbn=0-618-25760-8|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Tolkien's use of Gothic is also known from a letter from 1965 to Zillah Sherring. When she bought a copy of Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War in Salisbury, she found strange inscriptions in it; after she found his name in it, she wrote him a letter and asked him if the inscriptions were his, including the longest one on the back, which was in Gothic. In his reply to her he corrected some of the mistakes in the text; he wrote for example that ''hundai'' should be ''hunda'' and ''þizo boko'' (of those books), which he suggested should be ''þizos bokos'' (of this book). A semantic inaccuracy of the text which he mentioned himself is the use of ''lisan'' for read, while this was ''ussiggwan''. Tolkien also made a [[calque]] of his own name in Gothic in the letter, which according to him should be ''Ruginwaldus Dwalakoneis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bellet|first1=Bertrand|last2=Babut|first2=Benjamin|title=Apostil to Thucydides|url=http://www.jrrvf.com/~glaemscrafu/english/thucydide.html|website=Glæmscrafu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Thorvaldsen museum also has an alliterative poem, ''Thunravalds Sunau'', from 1841 by [[Hans Ferdinand Massmann|Massmann]], the first publisher of the Skeireins, written in the Gothic language. It was read at a great feast dedicated to Thorvaldsen in the Gesellschaft der Zwanglosen in [[Munich]] on July 15, 1841. This event is mentioned by [[Ludwig Schorn]] in the magazine Kunstblatt from the 19th of July, 1841.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Massmann|first1=Hans Ferdinand|title=Thunravalds Sunau|url=http://arkivet.thorvaldsensmuseum.dk/dokumenter/m32,nr.97|website=Thorvaldsen museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massmann also translated the academic commercium song ''[[Gaudeamus]]'' into Gothic in 1837.&lt;ref&gt;http://reader.digitale-sammlun{{abbr|gen.|genitive}}de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb10800718_00002.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, professor Bjarne Simmelkjær Hansen of the [[University of Copenhagen]] published a translation into Gothic of ''[[Adeste Fideles]]'' for [[Roots of Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simmelkjær Hansen|first1=Bjarne|title=qimandau triggwai|url=http://rootsofeurope.ku.dk/streaming/f2012/gotisk/Gotiske_sange.pdf|website=Roots of Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Fleurs du Mal'', an online magazine for art and literature, the poem ''Overvloed'' of Dutch poet Bert Bevers appeared in a Gothic translation.&lt;ref&gt;http://fleursdumal.nl/mag/bert-bevers-overvloed-translation-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Alice in Wonderland has been translated into Gothic (Balþos Gadedeis Aþalhaidais in Sildaleikalanda) by David Carlton in 2015 and is published by [[Michael Everson]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/mad-challenge-translating-alices-adventures-wonderland-180956017/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://evertype.com/books/alice-got.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Historical behaviour studies (Historische Verhaltensforschung)''' is a field of research in cultural history and cultural anthropology and a particular methodological approach to the study of human behaviour.

== Method and object of research ==

Historical behaviour studies are a type of [[cultural sociology]] under the particular aspect of historical change. Its focal points were:

* to describe [[patterns]] of human bodily practice as [[rites]] and ceremonies, music and dance, sports and exercises, play and game, beyond ideas and [[weltanschauung]] [[:de:Weltanschauung]];
* to identify analogies between [[patterns]] of bodily [[behaviour]], ([[gestures]] and body movement) and patterns of [[thinking]] (“Denkordnungen”);
* to compare forms of behaviour across different times and [[cultures]] by [[patterns]] and [[wikt:configuration|configurations]] rather than by meaning;
* to compare patterns of behaviour, of thinking and of mentalities (mindsets) in different fields of society, as in economic behaviour, military behaviour, concepts of [[natural sciences]], proceedings and atmospheres in literary works, and [[social movements]];
* to understand epochal changes of behaviour (→[[Periodization]]);
* to bridge the gap between history, [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]].

== Institute of Social Research – the Stuttgart school ==

The Historical Behaviour Studies (Historische Verhaltensforschung) were established in 1971 by August Nitschke [[:de:August Nitschke]] and [[Henning Eichberg]] as a department of the [[University of Stuttgart]]. The Department of Historical Behaviour Studies was part of the newly established Institute of Social Research, side by side with departments of [[social planning]] and [[social economy]]. Later on, historians like Johannes Burkhardt [[:de:Johannes Burkhardt]], [[Andreas Kalckhoff]], Harald Kleinschmidt, Volker Saftien and Michael Walter joined the department. Others like Wolfgang Christian Schneider, Andreas Gestrich [[:de:Andreas Gestrich]], Mathias Beer und Katja Erdmann-Rajski worked in connection with the department and used similar methods of research.

The research of this Stuttgart school of studies in [[human behaviour]] was to a certain extent parallel to the [[History of Mentalities]] from France, to the Cultural Sociology (Kultursoziologie [[:de:Kultursoziologie]]) from Germany and Denmark, and to the [[Historical Anthropology]] or ''[[Alltagsgeschichte]]'' from Germany which arose in the 1990s. Referring to [[Ruth Benedict]], [[Norbert Elias]] and [[Michel Foucault]], the patterns of human behaviour were called “[[wikt:configuration|configurations]]” (→[[Configurational analysis (Konfigurationsanalyse)]]).

== Analyzing historical change and cultural difference ==

The Stuttgart school of Historical Behaviour Studies directed special attention towards fundamental and abrupt changes of behavior and society, as they could be observed in the context of the [[Renaissance]] 1550–1650, of the [[Industrial Revolution]] around 1770–1820, and in cultural change around 1900–1930. Other changes were studied for the [[Middle Ages]]. These historical [[case studies]] could lead to questions concerning the significance and change of behaviour at present and in the future.

A particular characteristic of the Stuttgart studies of historical behaviour was the comparative turn towards non-Western societies like [[Indonesia]], [[Japan]], and [[China]].

While the Stuttgart school generally focused on “describing” (→[[description]]) and “[[understanding]]” different forms and changes of historical behaviour, the “[[explanation]]” of [[cultural difference]] and change was discussed diversely. Eichberg emphasized the irreducible [[Other (philosophy)|other]]ness ([[alterity]]) of foreign behavior; “extraneous” patterns withdraw from the explanations of the external observer and develop, also in modernity, on ways quite different from Western standard. Nitschke [[:de:August Nitschke]] tried to find explanations for the historical dynamics of different [[cultures]] by models of [[energy]] and [[time]] expectation; this met with observations of [[self-organization]] (→[[Synergetics (Haken)]]) as reported in [[physics]] and [[biology]]. Common for the Stuttgart school was a skeptical distance towards the traditional explanation of historical change by [[ideologies]], individual [[intention]]s, general [[social structures]] or one global process of [[sociocultural evolution]].

== Influence on international research ==

The Historical Behaviour Studies contributed among others to the history of [[popular culture]], and of [[peace]] and [[war]], to the study of [[paradigm]] changes in [[natural sciences]], to the [[history of art]] and of the [[public sphere]]. They had a special impact on the international study of body culture ([[physical culture]]). The Danish school of body culture studies developed the analysis of [[wikt:configuration|configurations]] – social space, social time, inter-human relations, atmospheres and emotions, and the objectifying of [[:wikt:movement|movement]] – towards the study of [[sport]] and other movement cultures (p. e. [[musical gesture]]) in diverse societies and social formations.

'''Hmong''' ([[Romanized Popular Alphabet|RPA]]: ''Hmoob'') or '''Mong''' ([[Romanized Popular Alphabet|RPA]]: ''Moob''), known as '''First Vernacular Chuanqiandian Miao''' in China ({{zh|c=川黔滇苗语第一土语|p=Chuānqiándiān miáo yǔ dì yī tǔyǔ}}), is a [[dialect continuum]] of the [[West Hmongic]] branch of the [[Hmongic languages]] spoken by the [[Hmong people|Hmong]] of [[Sichuan]], [[Yunnan]], [[Guizhou]], [[Guangxi]], northern [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], and [[Laos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ratliff |first=Martha |year=1992 |title=Meaningful Tone: A Study of Tonal Morphology in Compounds, Form Classes, and Expressive Phrases in White Hmong |location=Dekalb, Illinois |publisher=Center for Southeast Asian Studies, Northern Illinois University}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some 2.7 million speakers of varieties that are largely mutually intelligible, including over 280,000 [[Hmong Americans]] as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-11.pdf |title=The Asian Population: 2010 |author=Elizabeth M. Hoeffel |author2=Sonya Rastogi |author3=Myoung Ouk Kim |author4=Hasan Shahid |date=March 2012 |work=2010 Census Briefs |publisher=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over half of all Hmong speakers speak the various dialects in China, where the Dananshan (大南山) dialect forms the basis of the standard language.&lt;ref&gt;Not of Chinese Miao as a whole for which the standard language is based on [[Hmu language|Hmu]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hmong Daw (White Miao) and Mong Njua (Green Miao) are widely known only in Laos and the United States; Dananshan is more widely known in the native region of Hmong.

Hmong, in the narrow sense, is sometimes known ambiguously as the '''Chuanqiandian Cluster'''. That term is also used for Chuanqiandian Miao as a whole, or it may be restricted to the varieties of Hmong spoken in China.

==Varieties==
Mong Njua (Hmoob Ntsuab) and Hmong Daw (Hmoob Dawb) are part of a dialect cluster known in China as ''Chuanqiandian Miao'', that is, "Sichuan–Guizhou–Yunnan Miao", called the "Chuanqiandian cluster" in English, as West Hmongic is also called ''Chuanqiandian''. Mong Njua and Hmong Daw are just those varieties of the cluster that migrated to Laos; the Western names ''Mong Njua, Mong Leng, Hmong Dleu/Der,'' and ''Hmong Daw'' are also used in China for various dialects of the Chuanqiandian cluster.

Ethnologue once distinguished only the Laotian varieties (Hmong Daw, Mong Njua), Sinicized Miao (Hmong Shua), and the Vietnamese varieties (Hmong Do, Hmong Don). The Vietnamese varieties are very poorly known; population estimates are not even available. In 2007, Horned Miao, [[Small Flowery Miao]], and the Chuanqiandian cluster of China were split off from Mong Njua [blu].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/chg_detail.asp?id=2007-188|title=2007-188 - ISO 639-3|website=www.sil.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; These varieties are as follows, along with some alternate names ('Ch.' = Chinese name, 'auto.' = autonym [self name]):
* Hmong Daw (White Miao, Ch. ''Bai Miao'', auto. ''Hmoob Dawb''; Forest Miao, ''Hmong Rongd''; ''Hmong Dleu / Hmongb Dleub'' ;White Hmong)
* Mong Njua (Blue Miao, Green Miao, Ch. ''Qing Miao''; ''Hmoob Ntsuab / Hmongb Nzhuab''; in the US, also Mong Leng / Len, auto. ''Moob Leeg''; ''Hmongb Shib'')
* Hmong Shua (Sinicized Miao, auto. ''Hmongb Shuat'')
* Horned Miao (Ch. ''Jiao Miao'', auto. ''Hmo'' or ''A-Hmo'')
* Hmong Do
* Hmong Don (assumed)
* the part of the Chuanqiandian cluster located in China.

The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) stated that the White and Green dialects "are said to be mutually intelligible to a well-trained ear, with pronunciation and vocabulary differences analogous to the differences between [[British English|British]] and [[American English]]."&lt;ref name=Chap2Overview&gt;"[https://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/guidestoolkits/ethnographicguides/hmong/chapters/chapter2.pdf Chapter 2. Overview of Lao Hmong Culture]." ([https://www.webcitation.org/6GOsUnMa7?url=http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/guidestoolkits/ethnographicguides/hmong/chapters/chapter2.pdf Archive]) ''Promoting Cultural Sensitivity: Hmong Guide''. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]. p. 14. Retrieved on May 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the above names used outside (White Miao, Blue/Green Miao, Flowery Miao, Mong Leng, etc.) are also used in China. Several Chinese varieties may be more distinct than the varieties listed above:
* Dananshan Miao (Hmong Dou, auto. ''Hmong Drout Raol, Hmong Hout Lab''), the basis of the Chinese standard of the Chuanqiandian cluster
* Black Miao (Ch. ''Hei Miao'', auto. of subgroups: ''Hmong Dlob, Hmong Buak / Hmoob Puas'')&lt;ref&gt;Note however that "Black Miao" is more commonly used for [[Hmu language|Hmu]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Southern Hmong (auto. of subgroups: ''Hmongb Shib, Hmongb Nzhuab, Hmongb Lens, Hmongb Dlex Nchab, Hmongb Sad''; includes some of Mong Njua above)
* Northern Hmong (auto. of subgroups: ''Hmongb Soud, Hmong Be / Hmongb Bes, Hmongb Ndrous'')
* Western Sichuan Miao (Ch. ''Chuan Miao'')

In the 2007 request to establish an ISO code for the Chuanqiandian cluster, corresponding to the "first local dialect" (第一土語) of the Chuanqiandian cluster in Chinese, the proposer made the following statement on mutual intelligibility:
{{quote|A colleague has talked with speakers of a number of these {{sic|hide=y|closely|-}}related lects in the US, in Thailand and in China, and has had many discussions with Chinese linguists and foreign researchers or community development workers who have had extensive contact with speakers of these lects. As a result of these conversations this colleague believes that many of these lects are likely to have high inherent mutual intelligibility within the cluster. Culturally, while each sub-group prides itself on its own distinctives, they also recognize that other sub-groups within this category are culturally similar to themselves and accept the others as members of the same general ethnic group. However, this category of lects is internally varied and geographically scattered and mixed over a broad land area, and comprehensive intelligibility testing would be required to confirm reports of mutual intelligibility throughout the cluster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2007-188_cqd.pdf |title=ISO 639-3 New Code Request |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Varieties in Laos===
The CDC stated "although there is no official preference for one dialect over the other, White Hmong seems to be favored in many ways."&lt;ref name=Chap2Overview/&gt; The agency stated that the [[Romanized Popular Alphabet]] (RPA) is closest to that of White Hmong, most educated Hmong speak White Hmong, and that most Hmong dictionaries only include the White Hmong dialect. Younger generations of Hmong are more likely to speak White Hmong. Speakers of Green Hmong are more likely to learn White Hmong than speakers of White Hmong learning Green Hmong.&lt;ref name=Chap2Overview/&gt;

===Varieties in the United States===
Most Hmong in the United States speak the dialects White Hmong and Green Hmong with about 60% speaking White Hmong and about 40% speaking Green Hmong. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] stated that "though some Hmong report difficulty understanding speakers of a dialect not their own, for the most part, White and Green Hmong speakers seem to understand one another".&lt;ref name=Chap2Overview/&gt;

==Phonology==
The three dialects described here are known as Hmong Daw (also called White Miao or ''Hmong Der''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Golston |first=Chris |author2=Phong Yang |editor=C. Féry |editor2=A. D.

Although mutually intelligible, the dialects differ in both lexicon and certain aspects of phonology. For instance, Mong Njua lacks the voiceless/aspirated {{IPA|/m̥/}} of Hmong Daw (as exemplified by their names) and has a third nasalized vowel, {{IPA|/ã/}}; Dananshan has a couple of extra diphthongs in native words, numerous Chinese loans, and an eighth tone.

===Vowels===
The [[vowel]] systems of &lt;span style="background:#EEE8AA"&gt;Hmong Daw&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="background:#CAFF70"&gt;Mong Njua&lt;/span&gt; are as shown in the following charts. Phonemes particular to each dialect are color-coded respectively:

Dananshan {{IPA|[ɨ]}} occurs only after non-palatal affricates, and is written {{bracket|i}}, much like Mandarin Chinese.&lt;!-- not just in Chinese loans --&gt; {{IPA|/u/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[y]}} after palatal consonants. There is also a triphthong {{IPA|/jeβ/}} {{bracket|ieu}}, as well as other i- and u-initial sequences in Chinese borrowings, such as {{IPA|/je, waj, jaw, wen, waŋ/}}.

===Consonants===
Hmong makes a number of [[phoneme|phonemic]] contrasts unfamiliar to English speakers. All non-glottal [[Stop consonant|stops]] and [[Affricate consonant|affricates]] distinguish [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] and unaspirated forms, most also [[prenasalization]] independently of this. The [[consonant]] inventory of Hmong is shown in the chart below. (Consonants particular to &lt;span style="background:#EEE8AA"&gt;Hmong Daw&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="background:#CAFF70"&gt;Mong Njua&lt;/span&gt; are color-coded respectively.)

The Dananshan standard of China is similar. (Phonemic differences from Hmong Daw and Mong Njua are &lt;span style="background:#EECCE8"&gt;color-coded&lt;/span&gt;. Minor differences, such as the voicing of prenasalized stops, or whether {{IPA|/c/}} is an affricate or {{IPA|/h/}} is velar, may be a matter of transcription.) Aspirates, voiceless fricatives, voiceless nasals, and glottal stop only occur with ''yin'' tones (1, 3, 5, 7). Standard orthography is added in {{bracket|brackets}}. Glottal stop is not written; it is not distinct from a zero initial. There is also a {{IPA|/w/}}, which occurs only in foreign words.

{{note|l|*}} The status of the consonants described here as single phonemes with [[Lateral release (phonetics)|lateral release]] is controversial.  A number of scholars instead analyze them as biphonemic clusters with {{IPA|/l/}} as the second element.  The difference in analysis (e.g. between {{IPA|/pˡ/}} and {{IPA|/pl/}}) is not based on any disagreement in the sound or pronunciation of the consonants in question, but on differing theoretical grounds.  Those in favor of a unit-phoneme analysis generally argue for this based on distributional evidence (i.e. if clusters, these would be the only clusters in the language, although see below) and dialect evidence (the laterally released dentals in Green Mong, e.g. {{IPA|/tl/}}, correspond to the voiced dentals of White Hmong), whereas those in favor of a cluster analysis tend to argue on the basis of general phonetic principles (other examples of labial phonemes with lateral release appear extremely rare or nonexistent&lt;ref&gt;Even the landmark book [[The Sounds of the World's Languages]] specifically describes lateral release as involving a [[homorganic]] consonant.&lt;/ref&gt;).

{{note|nd|**}} Some linguists prefer to analyze the prenasalized consonants as clusters whose first element is {{IPA|/n/}}.  However, this cluster analysis is not as common as the above one involving {{IPA|/l/}}.

===Syllable structure===
Hmong [[syllable]]s have a very simple structure: [[syllable onset|onsets]] are obligatory (except in a few particles), [[syllable nucleus|nuclei]] may consist of a monophthong or diphthong, and [[syllable coda|coda]] consonants apart from nasals are prohibited. In Hmong Daw and Mong Njua, nasal codas have become nasal vowels, though they may be accompanied by a weak coda {{IPA|[ŋ]}}. Similarly, a weak coda {{IPA|[ʔ]}} may accompany the low-falling [[creaky voice|creaky]] tone.

Dananshan has a syllabic {{IPA|/l̩/}} (written {{angle bracket|l}}) in Chinese loans, such as ''lf'' 'two' and ''lx'' 'child'.

===Tones===
Hmong is a [[tone language]] and makes use of seven (Hmong Daw and Mong Njua) or eight (Dananshan) distinct [[tone (linguistics)|tones]].

The Dananshan tones are transcribed as pure tone. However, given how similar several of them are, it is likely that there are also phonational differences as in Hmong Daw and Mong Njua. Tones 4 and 6, for example, are said to make [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]] plosives [[breathy voiced]] (浊送气), suggesting they may be breathy/murmured like the Hmong ''g''-tone. Tones 7 and 8 are used in early Chinese loans with [[entering tone]], suggesting they may once have marked checked syllables.

Because voiceless consonants apart from tenuis plosives are restricted to appearing before certain tones (1, 3, 5, 7), those are placed first in the table:

So much information is conveyed by the tones that it is possible to speak intelligibly using musical tunes only; there is a tradition of young lovers communicating covertly this way by playing on a [[jew's harp]] (though this method may also convey vowel sounds).{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Orthography==
{{main article|Hmong writing}}
Robert Cooper, an anthropologist, collected a Hmong folktale saying that the Hmong used to have a written language, and important information was written down in a treasured book. The folktale explains that cows and rats ate the book, so, in the words of [[Anne Fadiman]], author of ''[[The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down]]'', "no text was equal to the task of representing a culture as rich as that of the Hmong." Therefore, the folktale states that the Hmong language was exclusively oral from that point onwards.&lt;ref name="Fadiman291"&gt;[[Anne Fadiman|Fadiman, Anne]]. "Note on Hmong Orthography, Pronunciation, and Quotations." ''The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux. 1997. [https://books.google.com/books?id=DUHAXXvSUeYC&amp;pg=PA291 291].&lt;/ref&gt;

Natalie Jill Smith, author of "Ethnicity, Reciprocity, Reputation and Punishment: An Ethnoexperimental Study of Cooperation among the Chaldeans and Hmong of Detroit (Michigan)", wrote that the [[Qing Dynasty]] had caused a previous Hmong writing system to die out when it stated that the death penalty would be imposed on those who wrote it down.&lt;ref name=SmithNJp44&gt;Smith, Natalie Jill. "Ethnicity, Reciprocity, Reputation and Punishment: An Ethnoexperimental Study of Cooperation among the Chaldeans and Hmong of Detroit (Michigan)" (PhD dissertation). [[University of California, Los Angeles]], 2001. p. 225. UMI Number: 3024065. Cites: Hamilton-Merritt, 1993 and Faderman{{sic}}, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the end of the 19th century, linguists created over two dozen Hmong writing systems, including systems using [[Chinese characters]], the [[Lao alphabet]], the [[Russian alphabet]], the [[Thai alphabet]], and the [[Vietnamese alphabet]]. In addition, in 1959 [[Shong Lue Yang]], a Hmong spiritual leader from Laos, created an 81 symbol writing system called [[Pahawh Hmong|Pahawh]]. Yang was not previously literate in any language. [[Chao Fang]], an anti-Laotian government Hmong group, uses this writing system.&lt;ref name="Fadiman291"/&gt;

In the 1980s, [[Nyiakeng Puachue Hmong]] script was created by a Hmong Minister, Reverend Chervang Kong Vang, to be able to capture Hmong vocabulary clearly and also to remedy redundancies in the language as well as address semantic confusions that was lacking in other scripts. Nyiakeng Puachue Hmong script was mainly used by [[United Christians Liberty Evangelical]] Church, a church also founded by Vang, although the script have been found to be in use in Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, France, and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quote=This excellent script has been used by members of the United Christians Liberty Evangelical church in America for more than 25 years, in printed material and videos.|author=Ian James &amp; Mattias Persson|url=http://skyknowledge.com/mong-ntaub3.htm|title=New Hmong Script|access-date=April 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The script bears strong resemblance to the Lao alphabet in structure and form and characters inspired from the Hebrew alphabets, although the characters themselves are different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2017/17002r3-n4780r3-nyiakeng-puachue-hmong.pdf|title=L2/17-002R3: Proposal to encode the Nyiakeng Puachue Hmong script in the UCS|last=Everson|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Everson|date=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other experiments by Hmong and non-Hmong orthographers have been undertaken using invented letters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hmonglanguage.net Hmong Language online encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Romanized Popular Alphabet]] (RPA), the most widely used script for Hmong Daw and Mong Njua, was developed in Laos between 1951 and 1953 by three Western missionaries.&lt;ref name="Fadiman291"/&gt; In the United States Hmong do not use RPA for spelling of proper nouns, because they want their names to be easily pronounced by people unfamiliar with RPA. For instance Hmong in the U.S. spell ''Hmoob'' as "Hmong," and ''Liab Lis'' is spelled as [[Lia Lee]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Anne Fadiman|Fadiman, Anne]]. "Note on Hmong Orthography, Pronunciation, and Quotations." ''The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux. 1997. [https://books.google.com/books?id=DUHAXXvSUeYC&amp;pg=PA292 292].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dananshan standard in China is written in a pinyin-based alphabet, with tone letters similar to those used in RPA.

;Correspondence between orthographies
The following is a list of pairs of RPA and Dananshan segments having the same sound (or very similar sounds). Note however that RPA and the standard in China not only differ in orthographic rules, but are also used to write different languages. The list is ordered alphabetically by the RPA, apart from prenasalized stops and voiceless sonorants, which come after their oral and voiced homologues. There are three overriding patterns to the correspondences: RPA doubles a vowel for nasalization, whereas pinyin uses {{angle bracket|ng}}; RPA uses {{angle bracket|h}} for aspiration, whereas pinyin uses the voicing distinction of the Latin script; pinyin uses {{angle bracket|h}} (and {{angle bracket|r}}) to derive the retroflex and uvular series from the dental and velar, whereas RPA uses sequences based on {{angle bracket|t, x, k}} vs. {{angle bracket|r, s, q}} for the same.

There is no simple correspondence between the tone letters. The historical connection between the tones is as follows. The Chinese names reflect the tones given to early Chinese loan words with those tones in Chinese.

Tones 4 and 7 merged in Hmoob Dawb, whereas tones 4 and 6 merged in Mong Njua.&lt;ref&gt;Mortensen (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
Hmong is an [[Analytic language|analytic]] [[Subject–verb–object|SVO]] language in which [[adjectives]] and [[demonstrative]]s follow the [[noun]]. Noun phrases can contain the following elements (parentheses indicate optional elements):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Hmong–Mien demonstratives and pattern persistence |journal=Mon–Khmer Studies Journal |year=1997 |first=Martha |last=Ratliff |volume=27 |issue= |pages=317–328 |id= |url=http://www.sealang.net/archives/mks/pdf/27%3A317-328.pdf |accessdate=2007-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6JqHYC0mG?url=http://www.sealang.net/archives/mks/pdf/27:317-328.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-23 |df= }} ()&lt;/ref&gt;

(possessive) + (quantifier) + (classifier) + noun + (adjective) + (demonstrative)

The Hmong pronominal system distinguishes between three [[grammatical person]]s and three numbers – singular, dual, and plural. They are not marked for case, that is, the same word is used to translate both "I" and "me", "she" and "her", and so forth. These are the [[personal pronoun]]s of Hmong Daw and Mong Njua:

===Verbs===
Hmong is an [[isolating language]] in which most morphemes are monosyllables. As a result, verbs are not overtly [[inflection|inflected]]. [[Grammatical tense|Tense]], [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[grammatical mood|mood]], [[grammatical person|person]], [[grammatical number|number]], [[grammatical gender|gender]], and [[grammatical case|case]] are indicated lexically.&lt;ref&gt;Strecker, David and Lopao Vang. White Hmong Grammar. 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Serial verb construction====
Hmong verbs can be [[serial verb|serialized]], with two or more verbs combined in one clause. It is common for as many as five verbs to be strung together, sharing the same subject.

Here is an example from White Hmong:&lt;br/&gt;
''Yam zoo tshaj plaws, nej yuav tsum '''mus nrhiav nug xyuas saib''' luag muaj kev pab hom dab tsi nyob ncig ib cheeb tsam ntawm nej.''&lt;br/&gt;
Thing best, you (plural) must '''go seek, ask, examine, look''' others have services variations what on tour the area at you (plural)&lt;br/&gt;
'The best thing you can do is to explore your neighborhood and find out what services are available.'

====Tense====
Because the verb form in Hmong does not change to indicate tense, the simplest way to indicate the time of an event is to use temporal adverb phrases like "last year," "today," or "next week."

Here is an example from White Hmong:
:{{interlinear
|{Nag hmo} kuv mus tom khw.
|yesterday I go LOC market
|'I went to the market yesterday.'}}

====Aspect====
Aspectual differences are indicated by a number of verbal modifiers. Here are the most common ones:

'''Progressive''': (Mong Njua) ''taab tom'' + verb, (White Hmong) ''tab tom'' + verb = situation in progress
:{{interlinear|c1=(Mong Njua)
|Puab {taab tom} haus dlej.
|they PROG drink water
|'They are drinking water.'}}

''Taab/tab tom'' + verb can also be used to indicate a situation that is about to start. That is clearest when ''taab/tab'' tom occurs in conjunction with the irrealis marker ''yuav''. Note that the ''taab tom'' construction is not used if it is clear from the context that a situation is ongoing or about to begin.

'''Perfective''': sentence/clause + ''lawm'' = completed situation
:{{interlinear|c1=(Green and White Hmong)
|Kuv noj mov lawm.
|I eat rice PERF
|'I am finished/I am done eating rice.' / 'I have already eaten "rice".'}}

''Lawm'' at the end of a sentence can also indicate that an action is underway:
:{{interlinear|c1=(White Hmong)
|Tus tub tau rab hneev, nws thiaj mus {ua si} lawm.
|CLF boy get CLF crossbow he then go play PFV
|'The boy got the crossbow and went off to play.' / 
'The boy went off to play because he got the bow.'}}

Another common way to indicate the accomplishment of an action or attainment is by using ''tau'', which, as a main verb, means 'to get/obtain.' It takes on different connotations when it is combined with other verbs. When it occurs before the main verb (i.e. ''tau'' + verb), it conveys the attainment or fulfillment of a situation. Whether the situation took place in the past, the present, or the future is indicated at the discourse level rather than the sentence level. If the event took place in the past, ''tau'' + verb translates to the past tense in English.
:{{interlinear|c1=White Hmong)
|Lawv tau noj nqaij nyug.
|they attain eat meat beef
|'They ate beef.'}}

''Tau'' is optional if an explicit past time marker is present (e.g. ''nag hmo'', last night). ''Tau'' can also mark the fulfillment of a situation in the future:
:{{interlinear|c1=(White Hmong)
|Thaum txog peb caug lawm {sawv daws} thiaj tau hnav {khaub ncaws} tshiab.
|when arrive New Year PFV everybody then attain wear clothes new
|'So when the New Year arrives, everybody gets to wear new clothes.'}}

When ''tau'' follows the main verb (i.e. verb + ''tau''), it indicates the accomplishment of the purpose of an action.
:{{interlinear|c1=(Mong Njua)
|Kuv xaav xaav {ib plag}, kuv xaav tau {tswv yim}.
|I think think awhile, I think get idea
|'I thought it over and got an idea.'}}

''Tau'' is also common in serial verb constructions that are made up of a verb, followed by an accomplishment: (White Hmong) ''nrhiav tau'', to look for; ''caum tau'', to chase; ''yug tau'', to give birth.

====Mood====
'''Future''': '''yuav''' + verb:
:{{interlinear|c1=(Mong Njua)
|Kuv yuav moog.
|I will be going.'}}

'''Indians in Japan''' consist of migrants from [[India]] to [[Japan]] and their descendants. {{asof|2014}}, there were 28,047 [[Indian people|Indian]] nationals living in Japan.&lt;ref name="MOFA"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/area/india/data.html|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs|publication-place=Tokyo, Japan|date=July 2009|chapter=インド基礎データ|title={{asiantitle|各国・地域情勢|||j}}|accessdate=25 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly 60% consist of expatriate IT professionals and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=Asahi Shimbun|title=対インド関係　「頭脳大国」との視点を|last=Kondõ|first=Masanori|date=10 March 2008|accessdate=25 September 2009|url=http://www.asahi.com/international/aan/hatsu/hatsu080315.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration history==
According to the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'', in 654 two men and two women of the [[Tushara Kingdom]], along with one woman from [[Shravasti]], were driven by a storm to take refuge at the former [[Hyūga Province]] in southern [[Kyushu]]. They remained for several years before setting off for home.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waterhouse|1991|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of modern Indian settlement in Japan goes back more than a century. As early as 1873, a few Indian businessmen and their families, primarily [[Parsi]]s and [[Sindhi people|Sindhis]], had settled [[Yokohama]] as well as [[Okinawa]].&lt;ref name="Singhvi"&gt;{{harvnb|Singhvi|2000|p=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891, [[Tata Group|Tata]], then a small trading firm, established a branch in [[Kobe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Minamino|Sawa|2005|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1901, Japanese government statistics recorded 30 people from [[British India]] living in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Minamino|Sawa|2005|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local statistics of the [[Hyōgo Prefecture]] government showed 59 Indians living in the prefecture in 1905, among whom all but one were men.&lt;ref name="Minamino"&gt;{{harvnb|Minamino|Sawa|2005|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the destruction wreaked on Yokohama in the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]], the Indian traders there also migrated to Kobe; from then on, Kobe became the centre of gravity of Japan's Indian community.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sawa|Minamino|2007|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1939, on the eve of [[World War II]], the number of Indians in Hyōgo Prefecture had reached 632. However, due to British sanctions against Japan and the 1941 halt of shipping between Japan and their homeland, many closed their shops and left; by 1942, there were only 114 remaining. Three years after the [[Partition of India]], their numbers had recovered somewhat to 255.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Minamino|Sawa|2005|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 1990, the Indian community in Japan remained centred on the [[Kobe]] area. However, after 1990, the numbers in Tokyo began to show a sharp increase.&lt;ref name="Azuma" /&gt; Migrants who arrived in the 1990s included industrial trainees sent by [[Automotive industry in Japan|Japanese car manufacturers]] which had set up factories in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Azuma|2008|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; IT professionals and their families also came to Tokyo, settling primarily in [[Setagaya, Tokyo|Setagaya]] and [[Minato, Tokyo|Minato]] wards.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sawa|Minamino|2007|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business and employment==
[[File:Mumbaipalaceindianresttokyo.jpg|thumb|An Indian restaurant in Tokyo]]
{{As of|2000}}, there were also around 800 Indians working in the IT industry in Japan, up from 120 in 1993.&lt;ref name="Singhvi_a"&gt;{{harvnb|Singhvi|2000|p=284}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenichi Yoshida, a director of the Softbridge Solutions Japan Co., stated in late 2009 that the Indian engineers are becoming the backbone of Japan's IT industry and that "it is important for Japanese industry to work together with the India."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FOCUS: Indian engineers becoming backbone of Japan's IT|url=http://home.kyodo.co.jp/modules/fstStory/index.php?storyid=469103|newspaper=[[Kyodo News]]|location=[[Minato, Tokyo]]|date=9 November 2009|accessdate=6 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Backbone of Japan's IT industry? Indian engineers!|url=http://business.rediff.com/report/2009/nov/06/indian-engineers-becoming-backbone-of-japan-it-industry.htm|newspaper=[[Rediff.com]]|location=[[Mumbai]]|date=6 November 2009|accessdate=6 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 870 Indians were employed as [[Indian cuisine|cook]]s.&lt;ref name="Singhvi_a"/&gt; Others are engaged in trading, importing the Indian handicrafts, garments, precious stones, and marine products, and exporting Japanese electronic goods, textiles, automotive parts, and jewellery.&lt;ref name="Singhvi" /&gt;

==Religion==
Indians in Japan speak a number of different languages and follow various religions; there is little correlation between religion or language and profession, except in the case of the Jains, many of whom work in the jewellery industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Azuma|2008|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jains are generally concentrated around Okachi-machi in [[Taitō, Tokyo]].&lt;ref name="Azuma_a"&gt;{{harvnb|Azuma|2008|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the whole, Tokyo has fewer religious facilities for Indians than does Kobe.&lt;ref name="Sawa"&gt;{{harvnb|Sawa|Minamino|2007|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are Sikh [[gurudwara]] in both Kobe and Tokyo; the latter is of more recent provenance, having been founded in 1999 in the basement of an office building.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Azuma|2008|p=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Sikhs employed as unskilled labourers in small and medium enterprises had to [[Sehajdhari|cut their hair short]] and remove [[dastar|their turbans]] in violation of the principle of ''[[Kesh (Sikhism)|kesh]]'', because their employers are unfamiliar with their customs and [[religious discrimination|do not give them any latitude]] in their style of dress. They consider this just a temporary adaptation to Japanese society. However, this practise is not common among Sikhs in skilled professions such as IT.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Azuma|2008|pp=263–264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a recent migration of [[Marathi Buddhist]] community in Japan. These community came to Japan in search of jobs is now also emerging as a business community. These people speak [[Marathi language|Marathi]] at home and [[Japanese language| Japanese]] at work. These people are originally followers of  [[Navayana Buddhism]] have now started syncretising with [[Japanese Buddhism]].

==Education==
[[File:India International School in Japan, Tokyo.JPG|thumb|[[India International School in Japan, Tokyo]]]]
Indians who send their children to school in Japan generally select English-medium schools. The first Indian-specific school was established in 2004 in Tokyo's [[Koto, Tokyo|Koto]] ward at the initiative of some of the old trading families based in Tokyo and Yokohama. The school's name is IISJ which stands for [[India International School in Japan]].&lt;ref name="Sawa_a"&gt;{{harvnb|Sawa|Minamino|2007|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Global Indian International School]], a Singapore-based school, has operated [[Global Indian International School, Tokyo Campus|a branch in Tokyo]] since 2006, and plans to open another in [[Yokohama]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="Sawa" /&gt; They follow the Indian [[Central Board of Secondary Education]] curriculum. The schools are popular not just among Indian expatriates, but among some Japanese as well, due to a reputation for rigour in [[mathematics education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20070422x2.html|periodical=Japan Times|date=11 April 2007|title=Indian schools make a mark|accessdate=25 September 2009|last=Hani|first=Yoko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other migrants leave their children behind in their native states, either with grandparents or at the boarding schools, in order to avoid interrupting their education.&lt;ref name="Sawa_a" /&gt;

==Community organizations==
One of the earliest Indian community organisations, the Oriental Club, was established in 1904 in Kobe; it changed its name to The India Club in 1913, and continued operating up to the present day. More were founded in the 1930s, including the Indian-dominated Silk Merchants' Association, the Indian Social Society, and the Indian Chamber of Commerce.&lt;ref name="Minamino" /&gt; In 2000, Indian expatriates living in [[Edogawa, Tokyo]], an area with a high concentration of Indian IT engineers founded the Indian Community of Edogawa.&lt;ref name="Azuma_a" /&gt; Others include the Indian Community Activities Tokyo, whose [[Diwali]] celebration draws 2,500 participants, as well as the Indian Merchants Association of Yokohama.&lt;ref name="Singhvi_a" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13353">[[Image:Kingsley Hall frontage.jpg|right|thumb|Kingsley Hall (front view)]]

'''Kingsley Hall''' is a community centre, at [[Bromley-by-Bow]] in the [[East End of London]]. It dates back to the work of [[Doris Lester]] and [[Muriel Lester]], who had a nursery school in nearby Bruce Road. Their brother, Kingsley Lester, died aged 26 in 1914, leaving money for work in the local area for "educational, social and recreational" purposes, with which the Lesters bought and converted a disused chapel. The current Hall was built on Powis Road, with a stone-laying ceremony taking place on July 14, 1927. An additional Church and community centre has also been built on Parslows Ave. Dagenham. This also holds the Kingsley Hall name and is undergoing redevelopment.

During the [[General Strike]] of 1926, Kingsley Hall became a shelter and soup kitchen for workers. [[Mohandas Gandhi]] stayed in Kingsley Hall in 1931 and the building now houses the [[Gandhi Foundation]]. The room where he stayed has been preserved. In 1935, hunger marchers on the [[Jarrow March]] stayed at the Hall.

In 1965 [[R. D. Laing]] and his associates asked the Lesters for permission to use the Hall as an alternative community for treating people affected by mental health crisis. Kingsley Hall became home to one of the most radical experiments in psychology of the time. The aim of the experiment by the [[Philadelphia Association]] was to create a model for non-restraining, non-drug therapies for those people seriously affected by [[schizophrenia]].
The idea of starting this type of community was an initiative suggested by [[Mary Barnes]] a former nurse and first resident as patient.

The hall was designated a [[listed building|Grade II listed building]] in September 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{IoE|206183 |accessdate= 9 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the Hall ==
===Origins===
In 1912, Doris and Muriel Lester started a Nursery School at numbers 58 and 60 Bruce Road. Children were fed, clothed and cared for at a charge of one [[shilling]] (five pence a day). When mothers could not afford fees, children were sponsored by a network of wealthier supporters. The service was soon expanded to include activities for older groups with the aim to provide for the development of the whole person – the mind, body and spirit – in an environment which brought people together regardless of class, race and religion.

Kingsley Lester died in 1914, leaving what money he had for work in Bow towards "educational, social and recreational" purposes. Doris and [[Muriel Lester]] bought an old chapel on the corner of Eagling Road in 1915, which was then re-decorated and fitted out by local volunteers. It was a "people's house", where friends and neighbours, workmen, factory girls and children of Bow came together for "worship, study, fun and friendship". The premises became known as Kingsley Hall, and operated a Nursery, as well as social events, concerts and adult school. Football, Sunday services and summer holiday schemes were also begun.

During [[World War I]], in the face of criticism, Doris and Muriel remained pacifists. Kingsley Hall ran a soup kitchen and stayed open at night for [[Air Raid Warden]]s. At the end of the war, Doris and Muriel joined a march to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] demanding that milk be sent to [[Germany]], where people were starving. A German child was adopted by the members of Kingsley Hall who paid for her to stay with a local family for two years.

After the War, Kingsley Hall maintained strong links with the [[Suffragettes]] in east London. Activists campaigned for votes for women in the face of threats. Muriel Lester spoke on street corners and on Sunday mornings in [[Victoria Park, East London|Victoria Park]]. After her talks local people contributed towards maintaining services at Kingsley Hall. Muriel became an [[Alderman]] on the [[Metropolitan Borough of Poplar]] and fought for basic provisions such as milk for children under five.

The Lester's father, Henry Lester, was a shipbuilder. He bought a cottage in [[Loughton]], (then a countryside district of [[Essex]]), to be used as a holiday place by families from Bow. Named after his deceased wife, ''Rachel Cottage'' also served to provide holidays for nursery children.

Enough money was saved to build the Children's House on Bruce Road which was opened by [[H.G. Wells]] in 1923. The foundation stones represent: Vision, Nature, Rhythm and Music; Beauty, Health, Education, Motherhood, Internationalism and Fellowship. The ''Children's House'' continues to be run as a Nursery School.

==Powis Road==
During the [[UK General Strike of 1926|1926 General Strike]], the hall became a shelter and soup kitchen for workers. Larger accommodations were needed as the popularity of Kingsley Hall grew, and a new Kingsley Hall was built on Powis Road, with funds from people in the neighbourhood and donations from wealthy patrons. The architect was [[Charles Cowles Voysey]].

A Stone-laying ceremony took place on July 14, 1927. The following people laid stones representing different aspects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kingsleyhall.freeuk.com/kingsleyhall.htm The History of Kingsley Hall] URL unavailable 31 July 2018 &lt;/ref&gt;

Kingsley Hall (on Powis Road) was opened on September 15, 1928. The building included residential units or cells, and also had a clubroom and dining room, kitchen, office and a space of worship. 

===Gandhi===
The new building would receive its most famous visitor just a few years after it opened. In 1931 [[Mahatma Gandhi]] accepted an invitation to stay there while on his visit to England. 
[[File:Gandhi planting a tree.jpg|thumb|Gandhi planting a tree outside Kingsley Hall on December 3, 1931. The tree was destroyed in World War II by a flash and was replanted by Lady Attenborough in 1984.]] In 1931, Lylie Valentine was a participant in activities at the hall before she became a worker at the nursery. In her pamphlet: ''Two Sisters and the Cockney Kids'', she recounts the excitement surrounding Gandhi’s stay in the East End:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The same year (1931), Muriel told us that Mahatma Gandhi (at whose ashram she had stayed in India) was coming over for the Round Table Conference. He had refused to stay at a hotel, but would come if he could live with the working class, so he was to stay at Kingsley Hall....when he arrived, I think all the people in East London waited outside to see him.''
''...besides doing his work with the Government, he spent a lot of time with us. He visited the Nursery School and all the children called him Uncle Gandhi. At six o'clock each morning, after his prayers, he took his walk along the canal, talking to workmen on the way.... There was something about him that always lives with the people.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gandhi lived at Kingsley Hall for 12 weeks. Stories that he was accompanied by a goat however, were pure press invention. Among Gandhi's visitors were [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], the [[Pearly King|Pearly King and Queen]] of east London, many politicians including [[David Lloyd George]] and the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Cosmo Gordon Lang]]. Muriel Lester later accompanied Mahatma Gandhi on his tour of earthquake-shaken regions in Bihar on his anti-untouchability tour during 1934.

===Jarrow March===
In 1935 [[Ellen Wilkinson]] led the [[Jarrow March]] to London, and some of the men were put up at Kingsley Hall. It was the poor helping the poor. They collected their pennies and opened the jumble store for them. Muriel Lester visited the Far East, USA, China, Japan and India to report to the League of Nations on drug investigations in the regions. Muriel Lester retired from full-time work in 1958 and in 1963 she became a ''Freeman of the Borough of Poplar'' on her eightieth birthday. Muriel Lester died in 1967.

===R.D. Laing and Kingsley Hall===

Following World War II, with the welfare state having undertaken much of the work advocated by the Lester sisters, Kingsley Hall continued on a quieter note as a youth hostel and community activity centre.

In 1965 [[R. D. Laing]] and his colleagues asked the Lesters for use of the Hall as a community for themselves and people in a state of psychosis. As a result Kingsley Hall became home to the [[Philadelphia Association]] and one of the most radical experiments in psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philadelphia-association.co.uk/Kingsley-Hall.html The Philadelphia Association: Kingsley Hall] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509060104/http://www.philadelphia-association.co.uk/Kingsley-Hall.html |date=2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the notion that psychosis, a state of reality akin to living in a waking dream, is not an illness simply to be eliminated through the electric shocks favoured in the Western tradition of the time but, as in other cultures, a state of trance which could even be valued as mystical or Shamanistic, it sought to allow schizophrenic people the space to explore their madness and internal chaos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laingsociety.org/colloquia/inperson/fhuxley.htm The Liberating Shaman of Kingsley Hall]&lt;/ref&gt; Residents (in the grip of psychosis) were often treated with kindness and respect with sincere efforts to alleviate their suffering.

One notable resident of this experiment was [[Mary Barnes]]. Along with resident psychiatrist [[Joseph Berke]], Mary later went on to write ''Two Accounts of a Journey Through Madness'', describing her stay at Kingsley Hall and use of her mental condition as a vehicle for painting and creative expression. Her account became famous in the 1970s when it was used as the basis for the play ''Mary Barnes'' by [[David_Edgar_(playwright)|David Edgar]]. Another notable resident was the renowned Norwegian author [[Axel Jensen]].

The activities of residents in the "no-holds barred" experiment made the local community largely hostile to the project, and there were regular reports of harassment. After five years (from 1965 to 1970) the project was wound up and Kingsley Hall was boarded up. During the seventies it was severely damaged.

==Recent history==

[[Image:Kingsley Hall London E3.jpg|right|thumb|Kingsley Hall]]

In the 1980s Kingsley Hall was one of the sets used in the film ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]''. During the filming [[Richard Attenborough]] united with the Kingsley Hall Action Group to raise enough funds to carry out an extensive refurbishing. Many of the local community contributed their skills and commitment to bring Kingsley Hall back into a usable community centre.

Kingsley Hall was reopened 2 March  1985 with events in the week preceding, and has since gone on to be used for activities ranging from youth groups, holiday outings or arts and photography workshops, for advice surgeries, wedding functions and educational projects. It also houses the office of the Gandhi Foundation, which pursues interests of peace internationally, in the tradition of its namesake.

In 1995, The Hall suffered two major burglaries when vandals broke in and burnt down the offices. The committed staff and volunteers were devastated by this destruction, but continued to run youth groups, advice sessions, clubs and meetings. The management interprets its remit as serving the local community and the cause of international peace and to do so in exciting and innovatory ways.

The Kongo people were among the earliest sub-Saharan Africans to welcome Portuguese traders in 1483 CE, and began converting to Catholicism in the late 15th century.&lt;ref name="Gates2010p14"/&gt; They were among the first to protest slavery in letters to the King of Portugal in the 1510s and 1520s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Melvin Page |title=Colonialism: An International Social, Cultural, and Political Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFTHBoRvQbsC |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-57607-335-3 |page=773 |year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shillington2013p1379"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kevin Shillington |title=Encyclopedia of African History (3-Volume Set) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=umyHqvAErOAC&amp;pg=PA1379 |year=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-135-45670-2 |page=1379 }}&lt;/ref&gt; then succumbed to the demands for slaves from the Portuguese through the 16th century. The Kongo people were a part of the major slave raiding, capture and export trade of African slaves to the European colonial interests in 17th and 18th century.&lt;ref name="Gates2010p14"/&gt; The slave raids, colonial wars and the 19th-century [[Scramble for Africa]] split the Kongo people into Portuguese, Belgian and French parts. In the early 20th century, they became one of the most active ethnic groups in the efforts to decolonize Africa, helping liberate the three nations to self governance. They now occupy influential positions in the politics, administration and business operations in the three countries they are most found in.&lt;ref name="Gates2010p14"/&gt;

==Name==
The origin of the name Kongo is unclear, and several theories have been proposed.&lt;ref name=fp273&gt;{{cite book|author1=Filippo Pigafetta|author2=Duarte Lopes|title=Le Royaume de Congo &amp; les contrées environnantes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dp9r6tlC5iAC&amp;pg=PA273|year=2002|publisher=Chandeigne|isbn=978-2-906462-82-3|pages=273 note Page82.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the colonial era scholar Samuel Nelson, the term ''Kongo'' is possibly derived from a local verb for gathering or assembly.&lt;ref&gt;"It is probable that the word 'Kongo' itself implies a public gathering and that it is based on the root ''konga'', 'to gather' (trans[itive])." Nelson, Samuel Henry. Colonialism In The Congo Basin, 1880–1940. Athens, Ohio: Ohio University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Alisa LaGamma]], the root may be from the regional word ''N'kongo'' which means "hunter" in the context of someone adventurous and heroic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alisa LaGamma|title=Kongo: Power and Majesty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ylRVCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18|year=2015|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=978-1-58839-575-7|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas Harper states that the term means "mountains" in the Bantu language, which is the root of the name of the countries and river that flows through the mountains of Congo region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Congo Congo], Douglas Harper, Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kongo people have been referred to by various names in the colonial French, Belgian and Portuguese literature, names such as ''Esikongo'' (singular ''Mwisikongo''), ''Mucicongo'', ''Mesikongo'', ''Madcongo'' and ''Moxicongo''.&lt;ref name=fp273/&gt; Christian missionaries, particularly in the [[Caribbean]], originally applied the term ''Bafiote'' (singular ''M(a)fiote'') to the slaves from the Vili or Fiote coastal Kongo people, but later this term was used to refer to any "black man" in Cuba, St Lucia and other colonial era Islands ruled by one of the European colonial interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Maureen Warner Lewis|title=Central Africa in the Caribbean: Transcending Time, Transforming Cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cMARCr6HoB4C&amp;pg=PA320 |year=2003| publisher=University of West Indies Press|isbn=978-976-640-118-4|pages=320–321}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group is identified largely by speaking a cluster of mutually intelligible dialects rather than by large continuities in their history or even in culture. The term “Congo” was more widely deployed to identify Kikongo-speaking people enslaved in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;John Thornton, ''Les anneaux de la Memoire'', 2 (2000) 235-49. [http://www.anneauxdelamemoire.org/fr/component/k2/item/download/142.html "La nation angolaise en Amérique, son identité en Afrique et en Amérique,"]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early twentieth century, ''Bakongo'' (singular ''M’Kongo'' or ''Mukongo'') has been increasingly used, especially in areas north of the [[Congo river]], to refer to the Kikongo-speaking community, or more broadly to speakers of the closely related [[Kongo languages]].&lt;ref name=Thornton2000/&gt; This convention is based on the Bantu languages, to which Kongo language belongs. The prefix "mu-" and "ba-" refer to "people", singular and plural respectively.&lt;ref name="Vansina1990pxix"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jan M.

== History ==
[[File:Kongo people in Africa.png|thumb|left|200px|Distribution of the Kongo people in Africa (approx)]]
The ancient history of the Kongo people has been difficult to ascertain. The region is close to East Africa, considered to be a key to the prehistoric human migrations. This geographical proximity, states Vansina, suggests that the Congo river region, home of the Kongo people, was populated thousands of years ago.&lt;ref name="Vansina1990p52"/&gt; Ancient archeological evidence linked to Kongo people has not been found, and [[glottochronology]] – or the estimation of ethnic group chronologies based on language evolution – has been applied to the Kongo. Based on this, it is likely the Kongo language and Gabon-Congo language split about 950 BCE.&lt;ref name="Vansina1990p52"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jan M. Vansina|title=Paths in the Rainforests: Toward a History of Political Tradition in Equatorial Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6M8Wv0Tp8VwC |year=1990|publisher=University of Wisconsin Pres|isbn=978-0-299-12573-8|pages=52, 47–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest archeological evidence related to this region, where the Kongo people are concentrated, is from [[Tchissanga]], a site dated to about 600 BCE. However, the site does not prove which ethnic group was resident at that time.&lt;ref name="Vansina1990p52"/&gt; The Kongo people had settled into the area well before the fifth century CE, begun a society that utilized the diverse and rich resources of region and developed farming methods.&lt;ref name="Vansina1990p146"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jan M. Vansina|title=Paths in the Rainforests: Toward a History of Political Tradition in Equatorial Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6M8Wv0Tp8VwC |year=1990|publisher=University of Wisconsin Pres|isbn=978-0-299-12573-8|pages=146–148}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to James Denbow, social complexity had probably been achieved by the second century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Denbow | first1 = James | year = 1990 | title = Congo to Kalahari:  Data and Hypotheses about the Political Economy of the Early Western Stream of the Bantu Expansion | url = | journal = African Archaeology Review | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 139–75 | doi=10.1007/bf01116874}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small kingdoms and Kongo principalities appeared in the current region by the 1200 CE, but documented history of this period of Kongo people if it existed has not survived into the modern era. Detailed and copious description about the Kongo people who lived next to the Atlantic ports of the region, as a sophisticated culture, language and infrastructure, appear in the 15th century, written by the Portuguese explorers.&lt;ref name=vansina152&gt;{{cite book|author=Jan M. Vansina|title=Paths in the Rainforests: Toward a History of Political Tradition in Equatorial Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6M8Wv0Tp8VwC |year=1990|publisher=University of Wisconsin Pres|isbn=978-0-299-12573-8|pages=152–158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later anthropological work on the Kongo of the region come from the colonial era writers, particularly the French and Belgians (Loango, Vungu, and the Niari Valley), but this too is limited and does not exhaustively cover all of the Kongo people. The evidence suggests, states Vansina, that the Kongo people were advanced in their culture and socio-political systems with multiple kingdoms well before the arrival of first Portuguese ships in the late 15th century.&lt;ref name=vansina152/&gt;

===The Kingdom of Kongo===
{{Main article|Kingdom of Kongo}}
[[File:Angola tribes 1970.jpg|thumb|200px|A map of Angola showing majority ethnic groups (Bakongo area is north, dark green).]]
Archaeological evidence, Portuguese documents and Kongo [[oral tradition]] suggest that the Kingdom of Kongo was founded in the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Fromont2014p2"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Cécile Fromont]]|title=The Art of Conversion: Christian Visual Culture in the Kingdom of Kongo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ax8VBQAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-1-4696-1871-5|pages=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kingdom was modeled not on hereditary succession as was common in Europe, but based on an election by the court nobles from the Kongo people. This required the king to win his legitimacy by a process of recognizing his peers, consensus building as well as regalia and religious ritualism.&lt;ref name="Fromont2014p2"/&gt; The kingdom had many trading centers both near rivers and inland, distributed across hundreds of kilometers and [[Mbanza Kongo]] – its capital that was about 200 kilometers inland from the Atlantic coast.&lt;ref name="Fromont2014p2"/&gt;

The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] arrived on the Central African coast north of the Congo river, several times between 1472 and 1483 searching for a sea route to [[India]],&lt;ref name="Fromont2014p2"/&gt; but they failed to find any ports or trading opportunities. In 1483, south of the Congo river they found the Kongo people and the Kingdom of Kongo, which had a centralized government, a currency called ''nzimbu'', and markets, ready for trading relations.&lt;ref name=vansina200&gt;{{cite book|author=Jan M. Vansina|title=Paths in the Rainforests: Toward a History of Political Tradition in Equatorial Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6M8Wv0Tp8VwC |year=1990|publisher=University of Wisconsin Pres|isbn=978-0-299-12573-8|pages=200–202}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese found well developed transport infrastructure inlands from the Kongo people's Atlantic port settlement. They also found exchange of goods easy and the Kongo people open to ideas. The Kongo king at that time, named Nzinga a Nkuwu allegedly willingly accepted Christianity, and at his baptism in 1491 changed his name to João I, a Portuguese name.&lt;ref name="Fromont2014p2"/&gt;

The trade between Kongo people and Portuguese people thereafter accelerated through 1500. The kingdom of Kongo appeared to become receptive of the new traders, allowed them to settle an uninhabited nearby island called [[São Tomé]], and sent Bakongo nobles to visit the royal court in Portugal.&lt;ref name=vansina200/&gt; Other than the king himself, much of the Kongo people's nobility welcomed the cultural exchange, the Christian missionaries converted them to the Catholic faith, they assumed Portuguese court manners, and by early 16th-century Kongo became a Portugal-affiliated Christian kingdom.&lt;ref name="Gates2010p14"/&gt;

====Start of slavery====
Initially, the Kongo people exchanged ivory and copper objects they made with luxury goods of Portuguese.&lt;ref name=vansina200/&gt; But, after 1500, the Portuguese had little demand for ivory and copper, they instead demanded slaves in exchange. The settled Portuguese in São Tomé needed slave labor for their sugarcane plantations, and they first purchased labor. Soon thereafter they began kidnapping people from the Kongo society and after 1514, they provoked military campaigns in nearby African regions to get slave labor.&lt;ref name=vansina200/&gt; Along with this change in Portuguese-Kongo people relationship, the succession system within Kongo kingdom changed under Portuguese influence,&lt;ref name="ks2013p773"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin Shillington|title=Encyclopedia of African History 3-Volume Set|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=umyHqvAErOAC|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-45670-2|pages=773–775}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1509, instead of the usual election among the nobles, a hereditary European-style succession led to the African king Afonso I succeeding his father, now named João I.&lt;ref name=vansina200/&gt; The slave capture and the export of slaves caused major social disorder among the Kongo people, and the Kongo king Afonso I wrote letters to the king of Portugal protesting this practice. Finally, he succumbed to the demand and accepted an export of those who willing accepted slavery, and for a fee per slave. The Portuguese procured 2,000 to 3,000 slaves per year for a few years, from 1520, a practice that started the slave export history of the Kongo people. However, this supply was far short of the demand for slaves and the money slave owners were willing to pay.&lt;ref name=vansina200/&gt;

The Portuguese operators approached the traders at the borders of the Kongo kingdom, such as the [[Malebo Pool]] and offered luxury goods in exchange for captured slaves. This created, states Jan Vansina, an incentive for border conflicts and slave caravan routes, from other ethnic groups and different parts of Africa, in which the Kongo people and traders participated.&lt;ref name=vansina200/&gt; The slave raids and volume of trade in enslaved human beings increased thereafter, and by the 1560s, over 7,000 slaves per year were being captured and exported by Portuguese traders to the Americas.&lt;ref name=vansina200/&gt; The Kongo people and the neighboring ethnic groups retaliated, with violence and attacks, such as the [[Jaga (Kongo)|Jaga invasion]] of 1568 which swept across the Kongo lands, burnt the Portuguese churches, and attacked its capital, nearly ending the Kingdom of Kongo.&lt;ref name=vansina200/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stapleton2016p377"&gt;{{cite book|author=Estevam Thompson|editor = Timothy J.

This war unexpectedly led to a flood of captives who had challenged the Kongo nobility and traders, and the coastal ports were flooded with "war captives turned slaves".&lt;ref name=vansina200/&gt; The other effect of this violence over many years was making the Kongo king heavily dependent on the Portuguese protection,&lt;ref name="ks2013p773"/&gt; along with the dehumanization of the African people, including the rebelling Kongo people, as cannibalistic pagan barbarians from "Jaga kingdom". This caricature of the African people and their dehumanization was vociferous and well published by the slave traders, the missionaries and the colonial era Portuguese historians, which helped morally justify mass trading of slaves.&lt;ref name=vansina200/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stapleton2016p377"/&gt;

Modern scholars such as Estevam Thompson suggest that the war was a response of the Kongo people and other ethnic groups to the stolen children and broken families from the rising slavery, because there is no evidence that any "Jaga kingdom" ever existed, and there is no evidence to support other related claims alleged in the records of that era.&lt;ref name="Stapleton2016p377"/&gt;&lt;ref name=miller121&gt;Joseph C.

From the 1570s, the European traders arrived in large numbers and the slave trading through the Kongo people territory dramatically increased. The weakened Kingdom of Kongo continued to face internal revolts and violence that resulted from the raids and capture of slaves, and the Portuguese in 1575 established the port city of [[Luanda]] (now in Angola) in cooperation with a Kongo noble family to facilitate their military presence, African operations and the slave trade thereof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cécile Fromont|title=The Art of Conversion: Christian Visual Culture in the Kingdom of Kongo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ax8VBQAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-1-4696-1871-5|pages=6–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jan Vansina|title=Being Colonized: The Kuba Experience in Rural Congo, 1880–1960|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mYRwo8SqqRwC|year=2010|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-23643-4|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kingdom of Kongo and its people ended their cooperation in the 1660s.

===Smaller kingdoms ===
{{Main article|Kingdom of Loango}}

The 1665 Kongo-Portuguese war and the killing of the hereditary king by the Portuguese soldiers led to a political vacuum. Kongo kingdom disintegrated into smaller kingdoms, each controlled by nobles considered friendly by the Portuguese.&lt;ref name="Gates2010p14"/&gt; One of these kingdoms was the kingdom of Loango. The Loango was in the northern part, above the Congo river, a region which long before the war was already an established community of the Kongo people.&lt;ref name=vansina200/&gt; New kingdoms came into existence in this period, from the disintegrated parts in the southeast and the northeast of the old Kongo kingdom. The old capital of Kongo people called Sao Salvador was burnt down, in ruins and abandoned in 1678.&lt;ref name=lagamma104/&gt; The fragmented new kingdoms of Kongo people disputed each other's boundaries and rights, as well as of other non-Kongo ethnic groups bordering them, leading to steady wars and mutual raids.&lt;ref name="Gates2010p14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Thornton, ''The Kingdom of Kongo:  Civil War and Transition, 1641–1718'' (Madison:  University of Wisconsin Press, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial era===
After the death of Dona Beatriz in 1706 and another three years of wars with the help of the Portuguese, Pedro IV was able to get back much of the old Kongo kingdom.&lt;ref name="Gates2010p14"/&gt; The conflicts continued through the 18th century, however, and the demand for and the caravan of Kongo and non-Kongo people as captured slaves kept rising, headed to the Atlantic ports.&lt;ref name=lagamma104&gt;{{cite book|author=Alisa LaGamma|title=Kongo: Power and Majesty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ylRVCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18|year=2015|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=978-1-58839-575-7|pages=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, in Portuguese documents, all of Kongo people were technically under one ruler, they were no longer governed that way by the mid 18th century. The Kongo people were now divided into regions, each headed by a noble family. Christianity was growing again with new chapels built, services regularly held, missions of different Christian sects expanding, and church rituals a part of the royal succession. There were succession crises, ensuing conflicts when a local royal Kongo ruler died and occasional coups such as that of Andre II by Henrique III, typically settled with Portuguese intervention, and these continued through the mid 19th-century.&lt;ref name=lagamma104/&gt; After Henrique III died in 1857, competitive claims to the throne were raised by his relatives. One of them, Pedro Elelo, gained the trust of Portuguese military against Alvero XIII, by agreeing to be vassal of the colonial Portugal. This effectively ended whatever sovereignty had previously been recognized and the Kongo people became a part of colonial Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alisa LaGamma|title=Kongo: Power and Majesty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ylRVCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18|year=2015|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=978-1-58839-575-7|pages=104–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In concert with the growing import of Christian missionaries and luxury goods, the slave capture and exports through the Kongo lands grew. With over 5.6 million human beings kidnapped in Central Africa, then sold and shipped as slaves through the lands of the Kongo people, they witnessed the largest exports of slaves from Africa into the Americas by 1867.&lt;ref name=eltis2015&gt;David Eltis and David Richardson (2015), Atlas of the Transatlantic Slave Trade, 2nd Edition, Yale University Press, {{ISBN|978-0300212549}}; Archive: [http://www.slavevoyages.org/assessment/intro-maps Slave Route Maps], see Map 9; The transatlantic slave trade volume over the 350+ years involved an estimated 12.5 million Africans, almost every country that bordered the Atlantic ocean, as well as Mozambique and the Swahili coast.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jan Vansina, the "whole of Angola's economy and its institutions of governance were based on the slave trade" in 18th and 19th century, until the slave trade was forcibly brought to an end in the 1840s. This ban on lucrative trade of slaves through the lands of Kongo people was bitterly opposed by both the Portuguese and Luso-Africans (part Portuguese, part African), states Vansina.&lt;ref name=vansina11&gt;{{cite book|author=Jan Vansina|title=Being Colonized: The Kuba Experience in Rural Congo, 1880–1960|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mYRwo8SqqRwC|year=2010|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-23643-4|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slave trade was replaced with ivory trade in the 1850s, where the old caravan owners and routes replaced hunting human beings with hunting elephants for their tusks with the help of non-Kongo ethnic groups such as the [[Chokwe people]], which were then exported with the labor of Kongo people.&lt;ref name=vansina11/&gt;

Swedish missionaries entered the area in the 1880s and 1890, converting the northeast section of Kongo to Protestantism in the early twentieth century.  The Swedish missionaries, notably Karl Laman, encouraged the local people to write their history and customs in notebooks, which then became the source for Laman's famous and widely cited ethnography and their dialect became well established thanks to Laman's dictionary of Kikongo.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Laman, ''The Kongo'' (4 volumes, Stockholm, Uppsala, and Lund, 1953–1968).&lt;/ref&gt;

The fragmented Kongo people in the 19th century were annexed by three European colonial empires, during the Scramble for Africa and Berlin Conference, the northern most parts went to France (now the Republic of Congo), the middle part along river Congo along with the large inland region of Africa went to Belgium (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) and the southern parts remained with Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Didier Gondola|title=The History of Congo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QY82GNGpcDgC |year=2002|publisher= Greenwood |isbn=978-0-313-31696-8| pages=50–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kongo people in all three colonies became one of the most active ethnic groups in the efforts to decolonize Africa, and worked with other ethnic groups in Central Africa to help liberate the three nations to self governance.&lt;ref name="Gates2010p14"/&gt; The French and Belgium regions became independent in 1960.

== Language and demographics ==
{{Main article|Kongo language}}
[[Image:Bowl by the Kongo peoples.jpg|thumb|200px|Kongo bowl in the [[National Museum of African Art]], Washington, DC]]

The language of the Kongo people is called Kikongo (Guthrie: Bantu [[Guthrie classification of Bantu languages#Zone H|Zone H]].10). It is a macrolanguage and consists of Beembe, Doondo, Koongo, Laari, Kongo-San-Salvador, Kunyi, Vili and Yombe sub-languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=kon Documentation for ISO 639 identifier: kon] SIL, [http://www.language-archives.org/language/kon OLAC resources in and about the Kongo language] Open Language Archives&lt;/ref&gt; It belongs to the Niger-Congo family of languages, more specifically the southern Bantu branch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.ethnologue.com/14/show_family.asp?subid=2833 Niger-Congo, Atlantic-Congo, Volta-Congo, Benue-Congo, Bantoid, Southern, Narrow Bantu, Central, H, Kongo (H.10)], Ethnologue&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kongo language is divided into many dialects which are sufficiently diverse that people from distant dialects, such as speakers of Kivili dialect (on the northern coast) and speakers of Kisansolo (the central dialect) would have trouble understanding each other.  Many Bakongo also speak other African languages and European languages. The [[Vili language]], spoken in the northern parts of Kongo people region, was originally grouped as one of the [[Kongo languages]] (H.10) by Guthrie, but it is now considered part of the [[Sira languages|Sira]] clade of Zone B languages.&lt;ref&gt;Nurse &amp; Philippson (2003), ''The Bantu Languages.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In Angola, there are a few who did not learn to speak Kikongo because Portuguese rules of assimilation during the colonial period was directed against learning native languages, though most Bakongo held on to the language.  Most Angolan Kongo also speak [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and those near the border of the Democratic Republic of Congo also speak [[French language|French]].  In the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] most also speak French and others speak either [[Lingala]], a common [[lingua franca]] in Western Congo, or Kikongo ya Leta (generally known as [[Kituba]] particularly in DR Congo), a creole form of Kikongo spoken widely in the Republic of the Congo, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Angola.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

[[File:Masques BaKongo.JPG|thumb|180px|BaKongo masks from the [[Bas-Congo|Kongo Central region]]]]
The religious history of the Kongo is complex, particularly after the ruling class of the Kingdom of Kongo accepted Christianity at the start of the 16th century. According to historian [[John K. Thornton]] "Central Africans have probably never agreed among themselves as to what their cosmology is in detail, a product of what I called the process of continuous revelation and precarious priesthood."&lt;ref name=thornton73&gt;John Thornton, "Religious and Ceremonial Life in the Kongo and Mbundu Areas," in Linda M. Heywood (ed) ''Central Africans and Cultural Transformations in the American Disapora'' (London and New York:  Cambridge University Press, 2002), {{ISBN|978-0-521-00278-3}}, pp. 73-74.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kongo people had diverse views, with traditional religious ideas best developed in the small northern Kikongo-speaking area, and this region neither converted to Christianity nor participated in slave trade until the 19th century.&lt;ref name=thornton73/&gt;

There is abundant description about Kongo people's religious ideas in the Christian missionary and colonial era records, but states Thornton, these are written with a hostile bias and their reliability is problematic.&lt;ref&gt;John Thornton (2002), "Religious and Ceremonial Life," Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-521-00278-3}}, pp. 72-73.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kongo people's beliefs included ''Kilundu'' as ''Nzambi'' (god) or ''Jinzambi'' (gods, deities), all of which had limited powers. They believed in a creator absolute god, which the 16th-century Christian missionaries to Kongo stressed is same as the Christian God, to help spread their ideas by embracing the old Kongo people's ideas.&lt;ref name=thornton74&gt;John Thornton (2002), "Religious and Ceremonial Life," Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-521-00278-3}}, pp. 74-77&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the early missionaries used Kongo language words to integrate Christian ideas, such as using the words ''"nkisi"'' to mean "holy". Thus, states Thornton, church to Kongo people was "nzo a nkisi" or another shrine, and the Bible was "mukanda nkisi" or a charm.&lt;ref name=thornton84/&gt; Kongo people maintained both churches and shrines, which they called ''Kiteki''. Their smaller shrines were dedicated to the smaller deities, even after they had converted to Christianity.&lt;ref name=thornton74/&gt; These deities were guardians of water bodies, crop lands and high places to the Kongo people, and they were very prevalent both in capital towns of the Christian ruling classes, as well as in the villages.&lt;ref name=thornton74/&gt;

[[File:Statuette protectrice nkisi, 71.1892.52.2, Musée du quai Branly.jpg|thumb|180px|Nkisi nkondi of the Kongo people; Nkisi means holy.&lt;ref name=thornton84&gt;John Thornton (2002), "Religious and Ceremonial Life," Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-521-00278-3}}, pp. 84-86&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The later Portuguese missionaries and [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin monks]] upon their arrival in Kongo were baffled by these practices in the late 17th century (nearly 150 years after the acceptance of Christianity as the state religion in the Kingdom of Kongo). Some threatened to burn or destroy the shrines down. However, the Kongo people credited these shrines for abundance and defended them.&lt;ref name=thornton74/&gt; The Kongo people's conversion was based on different assumptions and premises about what Christianity was, and syncretic ideas continued for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John |last=Thornton |title=The Development of an African Catholic Church in the Kingdom of Kongo, 1491–1750 |journal=Journal of African History |volume=25 |year=1984 |issue=2 |pages=147–167 |doi= 10.1017/s0021853700022830|jstor=181386 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kongo people, state the colonial era accounts, included a reverence for their ancestors and spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Wyatt MacGaffey, ''Religion and Society in Central Africa:  The Bakongo of Lower Zaire'' (Chicago:  University of Chicago Press, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; Only [[Nzambi a Mpungu]], the name for the high god, is usually held to have existed outside the world and to have created it.  Other categories of the dead include [[bakulu]] or ancestors (the souls of the recently departed). In addition, the traditional Kongo belief considered fierce looking ''Nkisi'' as guardians of particular places, such as mountains, river courses, springs and districts, called ''simbi'' (pl. ''bisimbi'').

However, some anthropologists report regional differences. According to Dunja Hersak, for example, the Vili and Yombe do not believe in the power of ancestors in the same degree as to those living farther south.  Furthermore, she and John Janzen state that religious ideas and emphasis have changed over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Dunja |last=Hersak |title=There Are Many Kongo Worlds: Particularities of Magico-Religious Beliefs among the Vili and Yombe People of Congo-Brazzaville |journal=Africa: Journal of the International African Institute |volume=71 |year=2001 |issue=2 |pages=614–640 |doi= 10.3366/afr.2001.71.4.614|jstor=1161582 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Janzen, ''Lemba, 1650–1930 : a drum of affliction in Africa and the New World'' (New York, Garland, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

The slaves brought over by the European ships into the Americas carried with them their traditional ideas. Vanhee suggests that the Afro-Brazilian [[Quimbanda]] religion is a new world manifestation of Bantu religion and spirituality, and Kongo Christianity played a role in the formation of Voudou in Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;Hein Vanhee, "Central African Popular Christianity and the Development of Voudou Religion in Haiti," in Heywood, Central Africans, pp. 243-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Society and culture ==
[[File:Raccolte Extraeuropee - Passaré 00139 - Statua Bakongo - Rep.Dem.Congo.jpg|170px|thumb|A Kongo artwork]]
The large Bakongo society features a diversity of occupations. Some are farmers who grow staples and cash crops. Among the staples are [[cassava]], [[banana]]s, [[maize]], [[taro]] and [[sweet potato]]es.

Palm oil is another export commodity, while the traditional [[urena]] is a famine food.  Some Kongo people fish and hunt, but most work in factories and trade in towns.&lt;ref name=britkongo/&gt;

There is a strong undercurrent of messianic tradition among the Bakongo, which has led to several politico-religious movements in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=britkongo/&gt; This may be linked to the premises of dualistic cosmology in Bakongo tradition, where two world exist, one visible and lived, another invisible and full of powerful spirits. The belief that there is an interaction and reciprocal exchange between these, to Bakongo, means the world of spirits can possess the world of flesh.&lt;ref name="Morris2006p153"/&gt;

==Nationalism==
The idea of a Bakongo unity, actually developed in the early twentieth century, primarily through the publication of newspapers in various dialects of the language.  In 1910 Kavuna Kafwandani (Kavuna Simon) published an article in the Swedish mission society's Kikongo language newspaper ''Misanü Miayenge'' (Words of Peace) calling for all speakers of the Kikongo language to recognize their identity.&lt;ref&gt;Wyatt MacGaffey, "The Eyes of Understanding:  Kongo Minkisi," in Michael Harris, eds. ''Astonishment and Power'' (Washington DC: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1993), pp. 22-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bakongo people have championed ethnic rivalry and nationalism through sports such as football. The game is organized around ethnic teams, and fans cheer their teams along ethnic lines, such as during matches between the Poto-Poto people and the Kongo people. Further, during international competitions, they join across ethnic lines, states Phyllis Martin, to "assert their independence against church and state".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Leisure and Society in Colonial Brazzaville|last = Martin|first = Phyllis|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1995|isbn = |location = |pages = 124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kuaiban''''' is a form of oral storytelling performance that is popular in northern [[China]]. It is a type of ''[[shuochang]]'', somewhat similar to [[rapping]].

==Background==
Kuaiban ([[wikt:快板|快板]]) literally means ''fast boards''. It is also known as ''kuai shu'', literally meaning ''fast books''. In [[Beijing]], the art form is known as ''kuaibanr''. 

The name refers to [[bamboo clapper]]s, a set of small bamboo boards or bones, which the performer rattles to produce an accompanying beat (similar to [[rapping]]). 

The free rhyming style is called "flower point". The line should have seven words. This rule, however, is not strictly followed if the rhythmic beat and rhyme coincide to allow more words or fewer words.

==History==
While bones have been used as musical instruments in China for thousands of years, kuaiban in its modern form was pioneered by [[Li Runjie]] of [[Tianjin]] in the 1940s.

==Performance==
During weekend evenings, groups of middle-aged and elderly people perform kuaiban on the south side of the hill in [[Jingshan Park]] in [[Beijing]].

'''La Noche Triste''' ("The Night of Sorrows", literally "The Sad Night") on June 30, 1520, was an important event during the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico]], wherein [[Hernán Cortés]] and his invading army of Spanish [[conquistador]]s and native allies were driven out of the [[Aztec Empire|Mexican]] capital at [[Tenochtitlan]] following the death of the [[Aztec]] king [[Moctezuma II]], who had been held hostage by the Spaniards.

==Prologue==
Cortés' expedition arrived at [[Tenochtitlan]], the [[Mexica]] capital, on November 8, 1519, taking up residence in a specially designated compound in the city.  Soon thereafter, suspecting treachery on the part of their hosts, the Spaniards took [[Moctezuma II]], the king or [[Hueyi Tlatoani]] of the [[Mexica]], hostage. Though Moctezuma followed Cortés' instructions in continually assuring his subjects that he had been ordered by the gods to move in with the Spaniards and that he had done so willingly, the Aztecs suspected otherwise.  During the following 98 days, Cortés and his native allies, the [[Tlaxcaltecas]], were increasingly unwelcome guests in the capital.

=== Cortés heads off Spanish punitive expedition ===
In June 1520, news from the [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf coast]] reached Cortés that a much larger party of Spaniards had been sent by [[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar|Governor Velázquez]] of Cuba to arrest Cortés for insubordination. Leaving Tenochtitlan in the care of his trusted lieutenant, [[Pedro de Alvarado]], Cortés marched to the coast, where he defeated the Cuban expedition led by [[Pánfilo de Narváez]] sent to capture him. When Cortés told the defeated soldiers about the riches of Tenochtitlan, they agreed to join him.  Reinforced by Narvaez's men, Cortés headed back to Tenochtitlan.

=== Loss of control in Tenochtitlan ===
During Cortés' absence, Pedro de Alvarado in Tenochtitlan obtained information that the Aztecs were planning to attack him. In response, de Alvarado ordered a [[Massacre in the Great Temple|preemptive slaughter of Aztec nobles and priests celebrating a festival in the city's main temple]].  In retaliation, the Aztecs laid siege to the Spanish compound, in which Moctezuma was still being held captive.  By the time Cortés returned to Tenochtitlan in late June, the Aztecs had elected a new Hueyi Tlatoani named [[Cuitláhuac]].

Cortés ordered Moctezuma to address his people from a terrace in order to persuade them to stop fighting and to allow the Spaniards to leave the city in peace. The Aztecs, however, jeered at Moctezuma, and pelted him with stones and darts. By Spanish accounts, he was killed in this assault by the Mexica people, though they claim he had been killed instead by the Spanish.&lt;ref name=Diaz&gt;Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0140441239}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|294}}&lt;ref name=Miguel/&gt;{{rp|90}}

[[File:Tenochtitlan.jpg|thumb|250px|A map of [[Tenochtitlan]] and its causeways leading out of the capital.]]
{{Aztecbox}}

With Moctezuma dead, Cortés and Alvarado knew they were in a precarious position. Under constant attack, with gunpowder and food and water in short supply, Cortés decided to break out of the city by night. In order to put the Aztecs off their guard, he sent messengers asking for a one-week ceasefire, at the end of which the Spaniards would return any treasure of which they were in possession and would be permitted to leave the city peacefully.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|296}}

Since the Aztecs had damaged bridges on four of the eight causeways into the island city, the Spaniards devised a portable bridge they could use in order to cross any unspanned sections of water. Cortés ordered that as much of the accumulated gold and other booty as was feasible be packed and carried away, and invited the Spanish soldiers to take and carry away as much as they wished of the remainder.  This invitation would lead to the demise of many soldiers who, overburdened with treasure, found it impossible to navigate the causeways and other obstacles encountered on the way out of the city.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|297,306}}

=== The Spanish head for the causeway out ===
On the night of July 1st, 1520,&lt;ref name = "calendar"&gt;Various sources give dates ranging from June 30 to July 4, a problem further confounded by the use of the [[Julian calendar]] in Europe at this time, which had diverged from the true (solar) date by almost 12 days.&lt;/ref&gt; his large army left their compound and headed west, toward the [[Tlacopan]] causeway. The causeway was apparently unguarded, and the Spaniards made their way out of their complex unnoticed, winding their way through the sleeping city under the cover of a rainstorm. Before reaching the causeway, they were noticed by Aztec warriors known as the [[Eagle Warriors]], who sounded the alarm.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|298,305}} First by a woman drawing water, and then by the priest of [[Huitzilopochtli]] from atop [[Templo Mayor]].&lt;ref name=Miguel&gt;León-Portilla, M. 1992, 'The [[Broken Spears]]: The Aztec Accounts of the Conquest of Mexico.'' Boston: Beacon Press, {{ISBN|978-0807055014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|85}}

The fighting was ferocious. As the Spaniards and their native allies reached the causeway, hundreds of canoes appeared in the waters alongside to harry them. The Spaniards fought their way across the causeway in the rain.  Weighed down by gold and equipment, some of the soldiers lost their footing, fell into the lake, and drowned. Amid a vanguard of horsemen, Cortés pressed ahead and reached dry land at [[Tacuba, Mexico City|Tacuba]], leaving the rest of the expedition to fend for itself in the treacherous crossing.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|299–300}}

Seeing the wounded survivors straggle into the village, Cortés and his horsemen turned back to the causeway, where they encountered [[Pedro de Alvarado]], unhorsed and badly wounded, in the company of a handful of Spaniards and [[Tlaxcaltecas]].  According to [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]], it was at this point that tears came to Cortés' eyes, as he realized the extent of the debacle.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|300}}

Cortés, Alvarado and the strongest and most skilled of the men had managed to fight their way out of Tenochtitlan, although they were all bloodied and exhausted. Cortés himself had been injured in the fighting.  All of the artillery had been lost, as had most of the horses.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|302}}

The sources are not in agreement as to the total number of casualties suffered by the expedition.  Cortés himself claimed that 154 Spaniards were lost along with over 2,000 native allies. Thoan Cano, another eyewitness to the event, said that 1170 Spaniards died, but this number probably exceeds the total number of Spaniards who took part in the expedition.&lt;ref name = "Prescott"&gt;Prescott, Appendix.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Francisco López de Gómara]], who was not himself an eyewitness, estimated that 450 Spaniards and 4,000 allies died.&lt;ref&gt;Prescott, Book 5, Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Montezuma's son, [[Chimalpopoca (Moctezuma)]] was killed and the [[Tepanec]] prince [[Tlaltecatzin]].&lt;ref name=Miguel/&gt;{{rp|87}}  King [[Cacamatzin]], his three sisters and two brothers were also killed.&lt;ref name=Miguel/&gt;{{rp|90}}

Diaz states the Spaniards suffered 860 soldiers killed, which included those from the later [[Battle of Otumba]].  The Tlaxcaltecas lost a thousand.  The noncombatants attached to the expedition suffered terribly, 72 casualties, including five Spanish women.  The few women who survived included [[La Malinche]] the interpreter, Dona Luisa, and [[María Estrada]].&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|302,305–306}} The event was named La Noche Triste ("The Night of Sorrows") on account of the sorrow that Cortés and his surviving followers felt and expressed at the loss of life and treasure incurred in the escape from Tenochtitlan.

==Aftermath==
Further battles awaited the Spaniards and their allies as they fought their way around the north end of [[Lake Zumpango]]. Two weeks later, at the [[Battle of Otumba]], not far from [[Teotihuacan]], they turned to fight the pursuing Aztec, decisively defeating them — according to Cortés, because he slew the Aztec commander — and giving the Spaniards a small respite that allowed them to reach [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]].&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|303–305}}

It was there in Tlaxcala that Cortés plotted the [[siege of Tenochtitlan]] and the eventual destruction of the Aztec Empire.

The '''Leghari tribe''' (or Lighari, Laghari) is a [[Baloch tribe]]. The Leghari tribe mainly resides in [[Pakistan]], followed by [[Iran]]. Descendants of the Laghari family mainly speak the languages of [[Balochi language|Balochi]], and/or [[Saraiki language|Saraiki]], based on locality. Legharis living in [[Sindh]] mostly speak Siraiki but they speak [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] too. Over two centuries, the Leghari tribe conquered a large part of what is today [[Dera Ghazi Khan District]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/57004|title=Khosas, Legharis have a common interest|date=2002-09-13|work=DAWN.COM|access-date=2018-08-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and established themselves at [[Choti Zareen]] (Lower Choti). The Leghari Tumandars (or Sardars i.e Tribal leaders) ruled a vast territory and collected tax from as far off as [[Barkhan]] in Balochistan. The Leghari people dwell in all four provinces of Pakistan and other parts of the world as well. The current Sardar of Laghari Tribe is [[Jamal Leghari]] , the eldest son of [[Farooq Leghari]] [https://tribune.com.pk/story/66746/leghari-tribe-crowns-its-27th-chief/].

A '''Maid of the Bedchamber''' (Danish: ''Kammerfrøken''; German: ''Kammerfräulein''; Russian: ''Kammer-devitsa''; Swedish: ''Kammarfröken'') was a court office for a [[lady-in-waiting]] in several European courts. 

The office was that of [[maid of honour]] of higher rank, or a senior maid of honour. While there was normally several maids of honour (Danish: ''Hoffrøken''; German: ''Hoffräulein''; Swedish: ''Hovfröken''), there was normally only one Maid of the Bedchamber. She was in rank between the maids of honour and the married ladies-in-waiting. As the German court model originally included only a [[Chief Court Mistress]] and a group of maids of honours, she was often second in rank of the ladies-in-waiting between them. The Maid of the Bedchamber was an office of high status selected from nobility. She had often been a maid of honour before she was promoted, because of birth or royal favor. Her tasks were essentially the same as the tasks of the maids of honour, though they were of higher status. In Sweden, the ''kammarfröken'' was the deputy of the ''[[överhovmästarinna]]'' whenever she was absent until the introduction of the office ''[[statsfru]]'' in 1774.&lt;ref&gt;Till Sveriges historia utgifna af D:r E.

MONTAN&lt;/ref&gt; As the maids of honour, a Maid of the Bedchamber retired from her office upon marriage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15911">The '''marriage gap''' describes observed economic and political disparities in the [[United States]] between those who are [[Marriage|married]] and those who are [[Single person|single]]. The marriage gap can be compared to, but should not be confused with, the [[gender pay gap|gender gap]].&lt;ref name="NAES"&gt;National Annenberg Election Survey (NAES).&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by [[W. Bradford Wilcox|Dr. W. Bradford Wilcox]], American sociologist and director of the [[The National Marriage Project|National Marriage Project]] at the [[University of Virginia]], and [[Wendy Wang]], director of research at the [[Institute for Family Studies]], "College-educated and more affluent Americans enjoy relatively strong and stable marriages and the economic and social benefits that flow from such marriages. By contrast, not just poor but also working-class Americans face rising rates of family instability, single parenthood, and lifelong singleness."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Politics and marriage==
As part of the marriage gap, unmarried people are "considerably more liberal" than married people.&lt;ref name="NAES"/&gt;  With little variation between professed [[moderates]], married people respond to be [[Conservatism|conservative]] 9 percent more, and single people respond to be [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] 10 percent more.&lt;ref name="NAES"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Definitions of ''moderate'', ''conservative'', and ''liberal'' were not given.&lt;/ref&gt;
Married people tend to hold political opinions that differ from those of people who have never married.

===Party affiliation in the United States===
In the U.S., being a married woman is correlated with a higher level of support for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and being single with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. Marriage does not seem to have a strong affect on party affiliation: 32 percent of married people call themselves Republicans and 31 percent say they are Democrats&lt;!-- I think this is not a difference --&gt;, while among single people, 19 percent are Republicans and 38 percent Democrats&lt;!-- This is a difference --&gt;.&lt;ref name="NAES"/&gt; The difference is most striking between married and single women.  Married women respond as being Republicans 15 percent more; single women respond as being Democrats 11 percent more.&lt;ref name="NAES"/&gt;

===Political issues===
The marriage gap is evident on a range of political issues in the [[United States]]:
*[[same-sex marriage]], 11% more married people favour Constitutional amendments disallowing it&lt;ref name="NAES"/&gt;
*[[abortion]], 14% more married people favour completely banning it&lt;ref name="NAES"/&gt;
*[[school vouchers]], 3% more married people favour them&lt;ref name="NAES"/&gt;

==Marriage and cohabitation==
It is not clear that legally or religiously formalized marriages are associated with better outcomes than long-term [[cohabitation]]. Part of the issue is that in many western countries, married couples will have cohabited before marrying, so that the stability of the resulting marriage might be attributable to the cohabitation having worked.

A chief executive of an organisation that studies relationships is quoted for having said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Because we now have the acceptance of long-term cohabitation, people who go into marriage and stay in marriage are a more homogenous group. They are people who believe in certain things that contribute to stability. So the selection effect is really important. Yes, it's true that married couples on average stay together longer than cohabiting couples. But cohabitation is such an unhelpful word, because it covers a whole ragbag of relationships, so it's not really comparable. We're better off talking about formal and informal marriages: those that have legal certificates, and those that don't. Is there any difference between a formal and informal marriage? If we really compare like with like, I'm not sure you'd see much difference." – Penny Mansfield&lt;ref name="Guardian of 17-7-2007"&gt;Penny Mansfield quoted in the [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/jul/14/comment.uknews Guardian of  17-7-2007]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Interpreting the data==

American marriage and family life is divided more today than it ever has been. "Less than half of poor Americans age 18 to 55 ( just 26 percent) and 39 percent of working-class Americans are currently married, compared to more than half (56 percent) of middle- and upper-class Americans." (cite) And when it comes to coupling, poor and working-class Americans are more likely to substitute cohabitation for marriage: poor Americans are almost three times more likely to cohabit (13%), and working-class Americans are twice as likely to cohabit (10%), compared with their middle- and upper-class peers age 18–55 (5%).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aei.org/publication/the-marriage-divide-how-and-why-working-class-families-are-more-fragile-today/|title=The Marriage Divide: How and Why Working-Class Families Are More Fragile Today - AEI|last=Wilcox|first=W. Bradford|date=September 2017|work=AEI|access-date=2018-03-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last2=Wang|first2=Wendy|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings suggest that lower income and less-educated Americans are more likely to be living outside of a partnership. Specifically, about six in 10 poor Americans are single, about five in 10 working-class Americans are single, and about four in 10 middle- and upper-class Americans are single.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

And when it comes to childbearing, working-class and especially poor women are more likely to have children than their middle- and upper-class peers, and these children of poor women have a significant higher chance of being born out of wedlock.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Estimates derived from the 2013–15 National Survey of Family Growth indicate that poor women currently have about 2.4 children, compared with 1.8 children for working-class women and 1.7 children for middle- and upper-class women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/index.htm|title=National Survey of Family Growth, 2013–15|last=|first=|date=2018-01-24|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2015 American Community Survey, 64 percent of children born to poor women are born out of wedlock, compared with 36 percent of children born to working class women, and 13 percent of children born to middle- and upper-class children.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/|title=2015 American Community Survey|last=US Census Bureau|first=|date=|website=www.census.gov|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With respect to divorce, working-class and poor adults age 18-55 are more likely to divorce than are their middle- and upper-class counterparts. 46 percent of poor Americans aged 18-55 are divorced, compared with 41% of working-class adults and 30 percent of middle- and upper-class adults.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The marriage gap is susceptible to multiple interpretations because it is not clear to what extent it is attributable to [[Correlation does not imply causation|causation]] and what to [[correlation]]. It may be that people who already have a number of positive indicators of future wellbeing in terms of wealth and education are more likely to get married. "The distinction between correlation and causation cuts to the heart of the debate about marriage. The evidence is unequivocal; children raised by married couples are healthier, do better at school, commit fewer crimes, go further in education, report higher levels of wellbeing. It is easy for politicians to deduce - and assert - that married couples therefore produce superior children. But the children do not necessarily do better because their parents are married and there is actually very little evidence that marriage alone, in the absence of anything else, benefits children." – Penny Mansfield&lt;ref name="Guardian of 17-7-2007" /&gt;

== Why the marriage divide? ==
As noted by [[W. Bradford Wilcox]] and [[Wendy Wang]],&lt;blockquote&gt;A series of interlocking economic, policy, civic, and cultural changes since the 1960s in America combined to create a perfect family storm for poor and working-class Americans.12 On the economic front, the move to a postindustrial economy in the 1970s made it more difficult for poor and working-class men to find and hold stable, decent-paying jobs.13 See, for example, the increase in unemployment for less-educated but not college-educated men depicted in Figure 9.14 The losses that less-educated men have experienced since the 1970s in job stability and real income have rendered them less “marriageable,” that is, less attractive as husbands—and more vulnerable to divorce.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Wilcox and Wang continue, however, and contend that it is not only economics. Citing Cornell sociologist Daniel Lichter and colleagues, they note that "shifts in state-level employment trends and macroeconomic performance do not explain the majority of the decline of marriage in this period; indeed, the retreat from marriage continued in the 1990s even as the economy boomed across much of the country in this decade."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the words of Lichter in colleagues, "“Our results call into question the appropriateness of monocausal economic explanations of declining marriage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/ssre.2001.0728 |title=Economic Restructuring and the Retreat from Marriage |journal=Social Science Research |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=230–56 |year=2002 |last1=Lichter |first1=Daniel T |last2=McLaughlin |first2=Diane K |last3=Ribar |first3=David C }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, "The decline of marriage and rise of single parenthood in the late 1960s preceded the economic changes that undercut men’s wages and job stability in the 1970s."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew J. Cherlin, Labor’s Love Lost: The Rise and Fall of Working-Class Family in America (New York: Russell Sage Foundation, 2014).{{pn|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There exist several possible reasons for the emergence of the Marriage Divide. First, as posited by [[W. Bradford Wilcox]], [[Wendy Wang]], and [[Nicholas Wolfinger]], "because working-class and poor Americans have less of a social and economic stake in stable marriage, they depend more on cultural supports for marriage than do their middle- and upper-class peers."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1353/foc.2015.0015 |title=One Nation, Divided: Culture, Civic Institutions, and the Marriage Divide |journal=The Future of Children |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=111–27 |year=2015 |last1=Wilcox |first1=W. Bradford |last2=Wolfinger |first2=Nicholas H |last3=Stokes |first3=Charles E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, "Working-class and poor Americans have fewer cultural and educational resources to successfully navigate the increasingly deinstitutionalized character of dating, childbearing, and marriage. The legal scholar Amy Wax argues that the “moral deregulation” of matters related to sex, parenthood, marriage, and divorce proved more difficult for poor and working-class Americans to navigate than for more educated and affluent Americans because the latter group was and remains more likely to approach these matters with a disciplined, long-term perspective."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2095590 |jstor=2095590 |title=Determinants of Divorce over the Marital Life Course |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=583–90 |year=1986 |last1=South |first1=Scott J |last2=Spitze |first2=Glenna }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Today’s ethos of freedom and choice when it comes to dating, childbearing, and marriage is more difficult for working-class and poor Americans to navigate."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Third, "in recent years, middle- and upper-class Americans have rejected the most permissive dimensions of the counterculture for themselves and their children, even as poor and working-class Americans have adapted a more permissive orientation toward matters such as divorce and premarital sex.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;W. Bradford Wilcox, “State of Our Unions 2010.”&lt;/ref&gt; The end result has been that key norms, values, and virtues— from fidelity to attitudes about teen pregnancy—that sustain a strong marriage culture are now generally weaker in poor and working-class communities."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22310">'''[[Multiculturalism]] in [[the Netherlands]]''' began with a major increases in [[Demographics_of_the_Netherlands#Migration_and_ethnicity|immigration]] during the 1950s and 1960s. As a consequence, an official national policy of multiculturalism was adopted in the early 1980s. This policy subsequently gave way to more [[assimilationist]] policies in the 1990s. Following the murders of [[Pim Fortuyn]] (in 2002) and [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]] (in 2004) the political debate on the role of multiculturalism in the Netherlands reached new heights.

[[Lord Sacks]], Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth, distinguishes between tolerance and multiculturalism, and says that the Netherlands is a tolerant, rather than multicultural, society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-12381027 |date=7 February 2011 |title=Multiculturalism: What does it mean? |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government policy ==
After the Second World War, immigration consisted of guest workers and migrants from the former colonies. There was low pressure to [[Cultural assimilation|culturally assimilate]], it was easy to gain [[Dutch nationality law|citizenship]] and government agencies translated documents and services for immigrants who lacked [[Dutch language]] skills. Until the 1970s it was generally assumed that immigrants, especially guest workers, would eventually return to their countries of origin.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://focus-migration.hwwi.de/The-Netherlands.2644.0.html?L=1|title=Focus migration - country profile - Netherlands|last=|first=|date=November 2007|website=focus-migration.hwwi.de|publisher=Hamburgisches WeltWirtschaftsinstitut (HWWI)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 April 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiculturalism was adopted as a government policy by the Netherlands in the early 1980s,&lt;ref name="SSVH" /&gt; largely from a conviction that a quick assimilation of Muslim immigrants was impossible, and to stimulate remigration. In 1983 an "Ethnic Minorities Policy" was adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ellie Vasta|year=2007|title=From ethnic minorities to ethnic majority policy: Multiculturalism and the shift to assimilationism in the Netherlands|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|volume=30|issue=5|pages=713–740|doi=10.1080/01419870701491770}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1979 oil crisis|Second Oil Crisis]] led to a collapse of Dutch industrial labour and caused massive unemployment for the former "guest workers", who were not easily integrated into the newly developing [[postindustrial society]]. Dutch low-skilled labour as a fraction of the total workforce declined from 18% to 2% between 1979 and 1985, disproportionally affecting immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;Niesing, W. 1993, ''The labor market position of ethnic minorities in the Netherlands'', Dissertation Erasmus University Rotterdam, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; State programs to rectify the situation were ineffective during the 1980s. The economic boom of the 1990s improved the situation. The unemployment rate of Moroccans, the most disadvantaged large immigrant group, declined from 50% to 10% between 1989 and 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Jonkers, A.P, 2003, ''Diskwalificatie van wetgeving: de totstandkoming en uitvoering van de Wet bevordering evenredige arbeidsdeelname allochtonen (Wbeaa)''. Dissertation Radboud Universiteit, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;  In the post-1998 period government policies have become stricter and while previous [[Social integration|integration]] policies furthered diversity, diversity now was perceived to obstruct integration into Dutch society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Netherlands has attracted international attention{{When|date=November 2018}} for the extent to which it reversed its previous multiculturalist policies, and its policies on cultural assimilation have been described as the toughest in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Economist: ''[http://www.economist.com/agenda/displayStory.cfm?story_id=8325991&amp;fsrc=RSS Islam in Europe: Hostility at home]''; IHT: ''[http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/10/16/news/islam1.php Dutch virtue of tolerance under strain]''; IHT: ''[http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/09/08/opinion/idlede9.php The Dutch redefine tolerance]''; Al-Ahram: [http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/717/in1.htm How Holland lost its innocence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810114430/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/717/in1.htm|date=2009-08-10}}; PBS: [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/religion/july-dec04/dutchmuslims_11-4.htm A test of tolerance: Muslim immigrants in the Netherlands]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immigration and opposition to it==
After the Second World War there were three successive waves of major immigration into the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="SSVH"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Attitudes toward multiculturalism of immigrants and majority members in the Netherlands |author=Saskia R.G. Schalk-Soekar, [[Fons J.R. van de Vijver]] and Mariëtte Hoogsteder |journal=International Journal of Intercultural Relations |volume=28 |issue=6 |date=November 2004 |pages=533–550 |doi=10.1016/j.ijintrel.2005.01.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first originated in the former Dutch colony of the [[Dutch East Indies]] ([[Indonesia]]) in the 1940s and 1950s. The second wave originated in Southern Europe (Greece, Italy, Spain, and Portugal) and from Turkey and Morocco during the 1960s and 1970s, coinciding with a wave from the Dutch colony of [[Suriname]]. The second wave was largely in the form of labour migration of workers recruited by the Dutch state, a policy ended in 1974. The third wave consisted of [[asylum seeker]]s from different countries such as Iran, Iraq, and former Yugoslavia since the mid-1990s. The waves should be discerned from a general high and rising 'background' level of labour immigration from European countries, that accounts for the majority of people settling in the Netherlands.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The anti-immigration [[Centre Party (Netherlands)|Centrumpartij]] had a limited electoral success since 1982, but its leader [[Hans Janmaat]] was [[ostracism|ostracized]], and fined for his discriminatory statements and promotion of [[ethnic cleansing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://geschiedenis.vpro.nl/programmas/2899536/afleveringen/41837283/items/41872643/ ''Weg met de Centrumpartij'' - Epiloog]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2007, nearly 20% of the country's population were either (western and non-western) immigrants or children of immigrant parents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Demand for unskilled labour==
The multicultural policy consensus down-played negative aspects of the presence of immigrant cultural communities, and stressed beneficial effects. Immigration was not subject to limits on cultural grounds: in practice, the immigration rate was determined by demand for unskilled labour, and later by migration of family members. The total Western and non-Western immigration and re-migration resulted in an immigrant population of about 3.5 million.&lt;ref name=bevolking&gt;[http://statline.cbs.nl/StatWeb/publication/?VW=T&amp;DM=SLNL&amp;PA=37296ned&amp;D1=25,27-30&amp;D2=l&amp;HD=081103-1409 CBS StatLine - Bevolking; kerncijfers naar diverse kenmerken&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, about two million inhabitants were non-Western immigrants (1,095,731) or the direct descendants of these. Net immigration and the initially higher birth rate of the immigrant communities, have transformed the Dutch population structure since the 1950s. In 2006 one fifth of the population was of non-Dutch ethnicity, about half of which were of non-Western origin.&lt;ref name=bevolking/&gt; Immigration transformed Dutch cities especially: in Amsterdam, 55% of young people are of non-Western origin (mainly Moroccan, Surinamese and Turkish).{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Intellectual critique==
In 1999, the [[philosophy of law|legal philosopher]] [[Paul Cliteur]] attacked multiculturalism in his book ''The Philosophy of Human Rights''.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Cliteur. De filosofie van mensenrechten. Nijmegen 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Cliteur rejects all [[political correctness]] on the issue: Western culture, the ''[[Rechtsstaat]]'' (rule of law), and [[human rights]] are superior to non-Western culture and values. They are the product of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Cliteur sees non-Western cultures not as merely different but as anachronistic. He sees multiculturalism primarily as an unacceptable ideology of [[cultural relativism]], which would lead to acceptance of barbaric practices, including those brought to the Western World by immigrants. Cliteur lists [[infanticide]], [[torture]], [[slavery]], oppression of women, [[homophobia]], racism, anti-Semitism, [[gangs]], [[female genital cutting]], discrimination ''by'' immigrants, [[suttee]], and the [[death penalty]]. Cliteur compares multiculturalism to the moral acceptance of [[Auschwitz]], [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Pol Pot]] and the [[Ku Klux Klan]].

Cliteur's 1999 work is indicative of the [[polemic]] tone of the debate in the following years. Most of the "immigrant barbarities" which he names are regularly cited by opponents of multiculturalism, sometimes as a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'', but also as supposed factual practices of immigrants in the Netherlands.{{Citation needed|reason=Sources needed for verification of such claims being made|date=September 2018}}

In 2000, [[Paul Scheffer]] — a member of the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] and subsequently a professor of [[urban studies]] — published his essay "The multicultural tragedy",&lt;ref&gt;Online at NRC, see [http://www.nrc.nl/W2/Lab/Multicultureel/scheffer.html]. An English translation is available at [http://themulticulturaltragedy.blogspot.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; an essay critical of both [[immigration]] and multiculturalism. Scheffer is a committed supporter of the [[nation-state]], assuming that homogeneity and integration are necessary for a society: the presence of immigrants undermines this. A society does have a finite "absorptive capacity" for those from other cultures, he says, but this has been exceeded in the Netherlands. His position more specifically included the following points:
*a huge influx of people from diverse cultural backgrounds, in combination with multiculturalism, resulted in spontaneous ethnic segregation.
*the Netherlands must take its ''own'' language, culture, and history seriously, and immigrants must learn this language, culture, and history.
*multiculturalism and immigration led to adaptation problems such as school drop-out, unemployment, and high crime rates.
*a society which does not respect itself (its Dutch national identity) also has no value for immigrants
*multicultural policy ignored [[Dutch language]] acquisition, which should be a priority in education.
*Islam has not yet [[Age of Enlightenment|reform]]ed itself, and does not accept the [[separation of church and state]].
*immigrants must always lose their own culture - that is the price of immigration, a "brutal bargain" (quote from [[Norman Podhoretz]]).

Scheffer approvingly quoted the Dutch sociologist J.A.A. van Doorn as saying that the presence of immigrants in the Netherlands had "put the evolutionary clock back" by fifty years or more. The high immigration rate and the lack of integration threatened society, and must be stopped. His essay had a great impact, and led to what became known as the "integration debate". As in the essay, this was not simply about multiculturalism, but about immigration, Islam, the national identity, and national unity.&lt;ref&gt;Scheffer P., ''Immigrant Nations'' (Polity, 2011) {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4961-0}}; English-language version of his 2007 book&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the legal scholar [[Afshin Ellian]],  a refugee from Iran, advocated a monocultural ''[[Rechtsstaat]]'' in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Afshin Ellian. 'Leve de monoculturele Rechtsstaat' in NRC, 30 November 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; A liberal democracy cannot be multicultural, he argued, because multiculturalism is an [[ideology]] and a democracy has no official ideology. What is more, according to Ellian, a [[democracy]] must be [[monolingualism|monolingual]]. The [[Dutch language]] is the language of the [[constitution]], and therefore it must be the only public language — all others must be limited to the private sphere. The Netherlands, he wrote, had been taken hostage by the left-wing multiculturalists, and their policy was in turn determined by the Islamic conservatives. Ellian stated that there were 800 000 Muslims in the country, with 450 mosques, and that the Netherlands had legalised the "feudal system of the Islamic Empire". Democracy and the rule of law could only be restored by abolishing multiculturalism.

==Political reaction==
{{Main|Multiculturalism and Islam}}
Overturning the political stability of the 1990s, Fortuyn in early 2002 swiftly gained popularity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.planet.nl/news/verkiezingen/2dekamer2002/nieuws/intomartfortuyn.shtml Opinion poll prediction] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611104107/http://web.planet.nl/news/verkiezingen/2dekamer2002/nieuws/intomartfortuyn.shtml |date=June 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was assassinated during the [[Dutch general election, 2002|2002 Dutch national election campaign]] by a militant animal rights activist [[Volkert van der Graaf]], who claimed in court to murdering Fortuyn to stop him exploiting Muslims as "scapegoats" and targeting "the weak parts of society to score points" in seeking political power.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/netherlands/1425944/Fortuyn-killed-to-protect-Muslims.html   Fortuyn killed 'to protect Muslims'] (The Telegraph)&lt;/ref&gt; His supporters saw Fortuyn as a national [[martyr]] in the struggle against islamisation.

Following Fortuyn's death, open rejection of multiculturalism and immigration ceased to be [[taboo]]. The new cabinet, under premier [[Jan-Peter Balkenende]] instituted a hard-line assimilation policy, enforced by fines and [[deportation]], accompanied by far tighter controls on immigration and [[Right of asylum|asylum]]. Many former supporters of multiculturalism shifted their position. In a 2006 manifesto "one country, one society",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eenlandeensamenleving.nl/ Een land, een samenleving]&lt;/ref&gt; several of them launched an appeal for a more cohesive society by "unity in diversity", while deploring what they saw as increasing intolerance. [[Piet Hein Donner]], the [[Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations (Netherlands)|Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations]] in the [[First Rutte cabinet|Rutte cabinet]], said that "Dutch culture, norms and values must be dominant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elsevier.nl/web/Nieuws/Politiek/300160/Donner-Afscheid-van-multiculturele-samenleving-Nederland.htm |date=16 June 2011 |title=Donner: Afscheid van multiculturele samenleving Nederland |newspaper=[[Elsevier]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129202053/http://www.elsevier.nl/web/Nieuws/Politiek/300160/Donner-Afscheid-van-multiculturele-samenleving-Nederland.htm |archivedate=29 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminist opposition==
The most prominent figure in the post-Fortuyn debate of the issue was [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]]. Her first criticisms of multiculturalism paralleled those of the early [[liberal feminism|liberal-feminist]] critics in the United States — the emphasis on group identity and [[group rights]] diminished individual liberty for those within the minorities, and especially for women. As time went on, her criticism was increasingly directed at Islam itself, and its incompatibility with democracy and Western culture. By 2004 she was the most prominent critic of [[Islam in Europe]]. She scripted a short film on Islamic oppression of women, featuring texts from the [[Quran]] on the naked bodies of women; its director [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]] was later assassinated by [[Mohammed Bouyeri]]. Threatened with death and heavily guarded, she spent most of her time in the United States, and moved to Washington in 2006 to work for the [[American Enterprise Institute]]. In 2006, she also expressed support for the [[Eurabia]] thesis — that mainstream politicians are conspiring to fully [[Islamisation|Islamise]] Europe —, and that its non-Muslim inhabitants will be reduced to [[dhimmitude]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://ayaanhirsiali.web-log.nl/ayaanhirsiali/2006/04/ayaan_confronta.html Confrontatie, geen verzoening]'' in De Volkskrant, 8 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech for [[Congress of Racial Equality|CORE]] in January 2007, she declared that Western culture was overwhelmingly superior:

&lt;blockquote&gt; ... my dream is that those lucky enough to be born into a culture of "ladies first" will let go of the myth that all cultures are equal. Human beings are equal; cultures are not.&lt;ref&gt;[[American Enterprise Institute]] ''[http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.25476,filter.all/pub_detail.asp Ladies First]', speech by Ayaan Hirsi Ali to the Congress of Racial Equality.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Patriotic measures==
Some of the measures, especially those seeking to promote patriotic identification, include: In the Netherlands, the naturalisation ceremony includes a gift symbolising national unity. In [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]] it is a candle in the [[national colours]] red-white-blue, in [[Amsterdam]] a [[Delftware]] potato with floral motifs.&lt;ref&gt;''Nieuwe Amsterdammer krijgt Delfts blauw bij naturalisatie'', De Volkskrant, 24 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are proposed measures which go much further than these. They typically, but not always, come from firmly [[right-wing]] parties and their supporters. The proposals illustrate the "post-multicultural" climate: a loyalty oath for all citizens, legal prohibition of public use of a foreign language, cessation of all immigration, expulsion of criminal, unemployed or not integrated immigrants, [[European Union withdrawal|withdrawal from the European Union]], a compulsory (non-military) [[national service]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Pim Fortuyn]] in '[[De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars]]', see '[http://archive.li/Dm7Pf Politiek worstelt al jaren met lastige jongeren]'&lt;/ref&gt; a ban on the construction of mosques,&lt;ref&gt;[[Geert Wilders]], parliamentary question, in Dutch: [http://www.geertwilders.nl/joomla/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=281#search=%22moskeeen%20verbod%22]{{Dead link|date=November 2008}}. Also policy of the [[Party for the Netherlands]] of [[Hilbrand Nawijn]] {{cite web |url=http://www.hilbrand-nawijn.nl/c_news.asp?nummer=557 |title=De 25 kernpunten uit het programma van Partij voor Nederland }}&lt;/ref&gt; closure of all Islamic schools,&lt;ref&gt;Policy of the [[Party for the Netherlands]] of [[Hilbrand Nawijn]] {{cite web |url=http://www.hilbrand-nawijn.nl/c_news.asp?nummer=557 |title=De 25 kernpunten uit het programma van Partij voor Nederland }}&lt;/ref&gt; a closure of all mosques, or a complete ban on Islam.

The [[Party for Freedom]] of anti-immigration politician [[Geert Wilders]] opposed the nomination of two ministers because they had [[dual nationality]]. The party subsequently proposed a [[motion of no confidence]] in both ministers. The party doubts their loyalty to the Netherlands, in cases of conflict with their countries of origin ([[Turkey]] and [[Morocco]]).&lt;ref&gt;Expatica: "[http://www.expatica.com/nl/articles/news/dual-nationality-fuss-unnecessary-36868.html Dual nationality fuss unnecessary]", 23 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to an opinion poll more than half the population agrees with the party.&lt;ref&gt;Trouw: "[http://www.trouw.nl/nieuws/laatstenieuws/article1458100.ece Helft Nederlanders oneens met dubbele nationaliteit]."&lt;/ref&gt; Opinion is sharply divided by political party: 96% of Wilders' voters agree with him, and 93% of [[GreenLeft]] voters disagree.

==Likelihood of polarization==
Although such policies often have the stated aim of reviving national unity, one result has been an increased [[polarization (politics)|polarization]].&lt;ref&gt;"All the recent evidence shows that we are, as a society, becoming more socially polarized by race and faith." (Trevor Phillips). Guardian, October 23, 2006: ''[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/oct/23/schools.race Muslim veil debate could start riots, warns Phillips]''&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims in Britain or the Netherlands hear that their culture is backward, that Western culture is superior, and that they are obliged to adopt it. In turn, defensive reactions&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Policy Centre.[http://fpc.org.uk/fsblob/792.pdf Born in the UK: Young Muslims in Britain]'. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822094816/http://fpc.org.uk/fsblob/792.pdf |date=August 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; include an increased self-identification as "Muslims", and adoption of [[hijab|Islamic dress]] by women and "Islamic" beards by men. Part of the Muslim minority is now hostile to the society they live in, and sympathetic to [[terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4744865.stm Bin Laden is seen as a hero],'' BBC&lt;/ref&gt;
In Amsterdam's secondary schools, about half of the Moroccan minority does not identify with the Netherlands: they see their identity as "Muslim", and regularly express [[Anti-Western sentiment|anti-Western]] views.&lt;ref&gt;City of Amsterdam policy document, February 2006. ''Wij Amsterdammers II: investeren in mensen en grenzen.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==New terms for minorities==
New terms for minorities of immigrant descent have come into use: the term [[allochtoon]] in Flanders (Dutch speaking part of Belgium) and the Netherlands. Both are applied regardless of [[citizenship]]. The renewed emphasis on historical culture places higher demands on cultural assimilation; immigrants may be encouraged to learn, for example, to identify and describe [[culture hero|cultural heroes]] and historical figures such as [[Thorbecke]] and
[[William the Silent|William of Orange]].&lt;ref&gt;Both came second, in polls to find the Greatest Briton and the Greatest Netherlander. Winston Churchill beat Brunel, and Pim Fortuyn beat William of Orange. BBC reports [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2509465.stm] and [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4015173.stm].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mujeres californias.jpg|thumb|California women, probably Pericúes, 1726]]
The '''Pericú''' (also known as Pericues, Cora, Edues) were the aboriginal inhabitants of the Cape Region, the southernmost portion of [[Baja California Sur]], Mexico. They have been linguistically and culturally extinct since the late 18th century.

==Territory==
[[File:Pericu map.png|right]]
[[File:Pericúes.png|thumb|Missions among the Pericúes.]]
The southern edge of the [[Baja California Peninsula]], from [[Cabo San Lucas]] east to [[Cabo Pulmo]], together with the large Gulf of California Islands of Cerralvo, Espíritu Santo, La Partida, and San José, have been recognized as aboriginal Pericú territory. [[William Clifford Massey|William C. Massey]] (1949) thought that the eastern portion of the Cape Region, including [[Bahía las Palmas]] and [[Bahía Ventana]], was occupied by a [[Guaycura]] group known as the Cora. Subsequent reexamination of the ethnohistoric evidence suggests that Cora was synonymous with Pericú (Laylander 1997).

The status of the [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz]] area is uncertain. Massey assigned it to two Guaycura groups, the Cora and the Aripe. [[W. Michael Mathes]] (1975) argued that it had belonged to the Pericú in the 16th and 17th centuries but was taken over by the Guaycura some time between 1668 and 1720. An alternative interpretation is that it was disputed ground between the Pericú and Guaycura throughout the early historic period.

==Language==
Evidence concerning the [[Pericú language|language spoken by the Pericú]] is limited to a handful of words plus fewer than a dozen place names (León-Portilla 1976). [[Jesuit]] missionaries recognized Pericú as a language distinct from [[Guaycura language|Guaycura]]. Massey (1949) suggested that Pericú and Guaycura had together constituted a Guaycuran language family, but this seems to have been based purely on their geographic proximity.

==Prehistory==
The archaeological record for Pericú territory extends at least as far back as the early [[Holocene]], about 10,000 years ago, and perhaps into the late [[Pleistocene]] (Fujita 2006). The distinctive [[cephalic index|hyperdolichocephalic]] (long-headed) skulls found in Cape Region burials have suggested to some scholars that the ancestors of the Pericú were either trans-Pacific immigrants or remnants of some of the New World's earliest colonizers (González-José et al. 2003; Rivet 1909). The distinctive [[Las Palmas Complex|Las Palmas burial complex]], involving secondary burials painted with red ochre and deposited in caves or rockshelters, was particularly noted (Massey 1955). The continued use of the atlatl and dart alongside the bow and arrow as late as the 17th century, long after their replacement in most of North America, has been used to argue for an exceptional degree of isolation in southern Baja California (Massey 1961).

Harumi Fujita (2006) has traced the changing patterns in the exploitation of marine resources and in settlement within the prehistoric Cape Region. According to Fujita, after about AD 1000, four major centers of socioeconomic and ceremonial importance emerged in the Cape Region: near Cabo San Lucas, at Cabo Pulmo, at La Paz, and on Isla Espíritu Santo.

==History==
European contacts with the Pericú began in the 1530s, first when [[Fortún Ximénez]] and mutineers from an expedition sent out by [[Hernán Cortés]], the conqueror of central Mexico, reached La Paz, followed shortly afterwards by an expedition under Cortés himself (Mathes 1973). Sporadic encounters, sometimes friendly and sometimes hostile, linked the Pericú with a succession of European explorers, privateers, missionaries, [[Manila galleon]]s, and pearl hunters throughout the 16th, 17th, and early 18th centuries. 

[[File:Martirio de Lorenzo Carranco.jpg|thumb|Martyrdom of [[Lorenzo Carranco]], at the beginning of the Pericú Revolt in Santiago de los Coras de Añiñí, 1st October 1734.]]
The [[Jesuits]] established their first permanent mission in Baja California at [[Loreto (Baja California)|Loreto]] in 1697, but it was more than two decades later that they felt prepared to move into the Cape Region. Missions serving the Pericú, at least in part, were established at [[Misión de Nuestra Señora del Pilar de La Paz Airapí|La Paz]] (1720), [[Misión Santiago de Los Coras|Santiago]] (1724), and [[Misión Estero de las Palmas de San José del Cabo Añuití|San José del Cabo]] (1730). A dramatic reversal came in 1734 when the Pericú Revolt began, resulting in the most serious challenge the Jesuits experienced in Baja California. Two missionaries were killed, and for two years Jesuit control over the Cape Region was interrupted (Taraval 1931). The Pericú themselves suffered most, however, with combat deaths added to the already devastating effects of Old World diseases. By the time the Spanish crown expelled the Jesuits from Baja California in 1768, the Pericú seem to have been culturally extinct, although some of their genes may survive in local populations of mixed descent.

==Traditional culture==
The Pericú are known primarily through the accounts of early European visitors (Laylander 2000; Mathes 2006). The most detailed of these were left by English privateers who spent time at Cabo San Lucas in 1709-1710 and 1721 (Andrews 1979).

===Subsistence and material culture===
The Pericú are best known for their maritime orientation, harvesting fish, shellfish, and marine mammals from the waters of the southern Gulf of California. Terrestrial resources such as agave, the fruit of cacti, small game, and deer were also important. Agriculture was not practiced.

The Pericú were one of the few aboriginal groups on the California coasts to possess watercraft other than tule balsas, making use of wooden rafts and double-bladed paddles. Nets, spears or harpoons, darts, and bows and arrows were tools for procuring fish and meat. Bags, baskets, and gourds were used for carrying, since pottery was not made. The requirements for shelter and clothing were minimal, although the women wore skirts of fiber or animal skins and both sexes adopted various forms of adornment.

===Social organization===
The division of labor among the Pericú was evidently based primarily or exclusively on sex and age. They were variously reported as being either monogamous or polygamous. Communities seem to have been politically independent. Leadership positions were hereditary and were sometimes held by women. Inter-community and inter-ethnic warfare seems to have been frequent, and conflicts with the Guaycura were chronic.

===Religion===
Fragments of Pericú mythology were recorded in the early 1730s (Venegas 1979(4):524-525). [[Shamanism|Shamans]] claimed to be able to effect supernatural cures of the sick. Mortuary and mourning observances were particularly elaborate.

The people believed in an all-powerful master named Niparaya, creator of heaven and earth. His wife is Amayicoyondi and they had three sons. One is called Quaayayp, who created the race of men. He was later killed by them. The second was Acaragui. The third was called Wac or Tuparan, depending on the sect. &lt;ref&gt;Native American Myths By Lewis Spence p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Political Economy Club''' was founded by [[James Mill]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/profiles/jamesmill.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403090755/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/profiles/jamesmill.htm |archivedate=2008-04-03 |df= }} James Mill, 1773-1836&lt;/ref&gt; and a circle of friends in 1821 in [[London]], for the purpose of coming to an agreement on the fundamental principles of [[political economy]].  [[David Ricardo]], [[James Mill]], [[Thomas Malthus]] (the only one holding an academic post at the time), and [[Robert Torrens (economist)|Robert Torrens]] were among the original luminaries.&lt;ref&gt;Elie Halévy, ''The Growth of Philosophic Radicalism,'' tr. Mary Morris. Boston, Beacon Press, 1955, p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century there were no academic societies or professional associations for [[economists]].  The Political Economy Club was a way to establish a scientific community, test ideas, and provide peer review for their  work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s7829.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829010046/http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s7829.html |archivedate=2008-08-29 |df= }}   D. P. O'Brien, ''The Classical Economists Revisited.''  Princeton University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The club was founded in 1821 and supported [[free trade]]. On 18 April 1821, Swinton Holand held the first meeting at his house. A second larger meeting was held at [[Freemasons' Tavern]], London on the 30th April.&lt;ref&gt;http://archives.lse.ac.uk/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&amp;id=PEC&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently members of the society are [[David Willetts]], [[Peter Jay (diplomat)|Peter Jay]], Charles Dumas, [[Adam Ridley]], Diana Choyleva, [[Tim Congdon]] and Gabriel Stein.  The Club now meets on a monthly basis in [[Brooks's]] to hear papers presented by members of the club and a discussion over dinner.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

== Discussions ==

The participants soon found substantial difficulties in formulating and reaching agreement on their fundamental propositions.  Ricardo felt that none of their views was safe from criticism.  Reflecting on their theoretical discussions in 1823, Ricardo privately expressed his famous opinion about the "non-existence of any measure of absolute value."&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo to Malthus, August 15, 1823. Quoted by Halevy, ''Ibid.,'' p. 352.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==

===Extent of prostitution===
As with other countries, estimates regarding the total number of prostitutes vary. Most sources place this number between 15,000 and 30,000.

An article published in 1997 in the [[International Encyclopedia of Sexuality]] claimed that the total number of prostitutes in the Netherlands was about 15,000 to 20,000.
&lt;ref name=encyclo&gt;[http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/netherlands.html Netherlands and the Autonomous Dutch Antilles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516190022/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/netherlands.html |date=16 May 2007 }}, ''The International Encyclopedia of Sexuality'', 1997–2001&lt;/ref&gt; [[CATW]] has stated that there were  30,000 prostitutes in the Netherlands, citing "''Sex tax Ticks off Dutch," Associated Press, 14 October 1997''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catwinternational.org/factbook/Netherlands.php |title=Netherlands- Coalition Against Trafficking of Women |publisher=Catwinternational.org |accessdate=3 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426194140/http://www.catwinternational.org/factbook/Netherlands.php |archivedate=26 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Radio Netherlands]], in 1999, there were estimated to be 25,000 prostitutes in the Netherlands, with 12,500 working at any one time at a total of 6,000 locations.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/faq-prostitution-netherlands |title=FAQ – Prostitution in the Netherlands &amp;#124; Radio Netherlands Worldwide |publisher=Rnw.nl |accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A later study by the [[Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] in 2000 estimated that there were a total of between 20,000 and 25,000 prostitutes in the Netherlands.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} [[UNAIDS]] estimated to number to be 25,000 in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sex workers: Population size estimate - Number, 2016 |url=http://www.aidsinfoonline.org/gam/stock/shared/dv/PivotData_2018_7_22_636678151733621264.htm |website=www.aidsinfoonline.org |publisher=UNAIDS |accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 90% of sex workers are estimated to be female, 5% male and 5% transgender.

===Foreign prostitutes===
In the 1970s, the majority of foreign prostitutes were from Thailand, in the 1980s from [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]]. After the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], many prostitutes came from [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]]. No more than one third were Dutch nationals, the remainder representing 44 nationalities. The majority were from the Dominican Republic, Colombia, the Czech Republic and Poland.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

An article written by Marie-Victoire Louis in ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'' in 1997, claimed that 80% of prostitutes in Amsterdam were foreigners and 70% had no immigration papers (but did not quote the source).

In 2008, Karina Schaapman, a former prostitute and former member of the [[Amsterdam city council]], produced a report about the Amsterdam sex trade. She offered the police a Facebook with 80 "violent pimps", of whom only three were Dutch-born. She said that more than 75% of Amsterdam's 8,000 to 11,000 prostitutes were from Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia.&lt;ref name=nyt8/&gt;&lt;ref name="timesonline.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5400641.ece |work=The Times  | location=London | title=Half of Amsterdams redlight windows close | first=David | last=Charter | date=27 December 2008 | accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study released by [[TAMPEP]] in 2009 put the number of migrant prostitutes at 60% (a decrease from 70% in 2006), originating from: Central Europe (EU) 40%, Latin America 20%, Western Europe 12%, Eastern Europe (non-EU) 8%, Africa 8%, Balkans 4%, Asia 4%, Baltic states 3% (estimates for 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tampep.eu/documents/TAMPEP%202009%20European%20Mapping%20Report.pdf |title=Sex work in Europe: A mapping of the prostitution scene in 25 European countries |publisher=TAMPEP international Foundation |date=2009 |accessdate=9 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714160224/http://tampep.eu/documents/TAMPEP%202009%20European%20Mapping%20Report.pdf |archivedate=14 July 2015 |df= }}  &lt;/ref&gt;

==Prostitution in practice==
According to the [[International Encyclopedia of Sexuality]], during the 1990s, some 10% of prostitutes worked on the streets, 30% in window prostitution, 30% in sex clubs, 15% in an escort service, and 15% in their private residence. Drug addicts, including drug tourists, were said to be numerous in the street prostitution group. Window and club prostitution were dominated by [[Caribbean]], [[South-American]], [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]], and [[Asia]]n women.&lt;ref name="hu-berlin1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/netherlands.html#8 |title=The International Encyclopedia of Sexuality: Netherlands and the Autonomous Dutch Antilles |publisher=.hu-berlin.de |accessdate=3 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424174559/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/netherlands.html |archivedate=24 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update inline|date=October 2018}}

According to [[Radio Netherlands]], prostitution  is concentrated in and around the big cities and in the border towns in the regions of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], [[Twente]], [[North Brabant|West Brabant]] and [[Zeeland]]. Prostitution occurs in various forms: window and street prostitution, clubs, escort agencies and home-based prostitution. Window prostitution occurs in 12 cities in the Netherlands. It is estimated that on average some 2,000 prostitutes are engaged daily in this form of prostitution. Street prostitution exists in 10 Dutch cities and involves on average some 320 prostitutes daily. Between 3,500 and 4,000 prostitutes are employed daily in 600–700 clubs and private brothels. The extent of other forms of prostitution such as escort agencies and home-based prostitution is much more difficult to estimate. Home-based prostitution occurs in at least 17 municipalities and escort agencies exist in at least 28 municipalities.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

In 2008, city statistic showed 142 licensed brothels in Amsterdam, with about 500 window displays, and officials estimated that sexual transactions in Amsterdam account for about 100 million US dollars per year.&lt;ref name=nyt8/&gt;

Ten percent of all prostitutes were estimated to be drug addicts (in the late 90s){{update inline|date=October 2018}} the majority of these prostitutes being Dutch nationals or former Dutch nationals.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Most prostitution consists in females selling sex to males. About 5% of prostitutes were estimated to be males and 5% were transgender.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

In 2011 Dutch authorities started asking sex workers to pay taxes on their earnings.

Some Dutch cities provide facilities called "afwerkplek", a [[sex drive-in]] enclosure for cars for street prostitution.&lt;ref name="German1"&gt;(25 February 2005).

In a 1989 study 13.5% of men reported having paid for sex at least once in their life and 2.6% had done so during the past year.&lt;ref name="hu-berlin1"/&gt;

During the [[Middle Ages]], prostitution was tolerated.&lt;ref name="sekswerkerfgoed"&gt;{{cite web|title=A very short history of prostitution in the Netherlands {{!}} Sekswerkerfgoed|url=https://sekswerkerfgoed.nl/a-very-short-history-of-prostitution-in-the-netherlands/|website=sekswerkerfgoed.nl|accessdate=14 April 2018|language=nl|date=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attitude of worldly and religious authorities towards prostitution was pragmatic. Many cities tolerated prostitution to protect chaste female citizens from rape and defilement. There were, however, a number of conditions imposed on prostitutes and their clients. Prostitutes were not allowed to be married.

Still, prostitution was considered a dishonorable profession. Prostitutes were not expected to conform to [[sexual morality|sexual rules]], and were not protected by the law. The concept of "honor" was very important in early modern Dutch society. Honor had social significance, but it also had legal ramifications. "Honorable" people had more rights. Until the late sixteenth century honor, aside from citizenship, was the most important criterion for the [[social stratification|stratification]] of society.

Despite the fact that prostitution was seen as indispensable, city governments tried to separate "dishonorable" prostitution from the honorable world.&lt;ref name="sekswerkerfgoed" /&gt; Until the fifteenth century, Dutch cities tried to keep prostitution outside of the [[city wall]]s. Later, city governments tried to reserve certain areas of the city for prostitution. Prostitution businesses were driven to the streets and alleys near the city walls.

Typical is the following decree from the city of Amsterdam in 1413:
:''Because whores are necessary in big cities and especially in cities of commerce such as ours – indeed it is far better to have these women than not to have them – and also because the holy church tolerates whores on good grounds, for these reasons the court and sheriff of Amsterdam shall not entirely forbid the keeping of brothels.''&lt;ref name=brants&gt;Chrisje Brants: The Fine Art of Regulated Tolerance: Prostitution in Amsterdam. ''Journal of Law and Society'', 25, number 4, pp. 621–635. December 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation and suppression starting in the 16th century===
During the sixteenth century, attitudes about sexuality changed under the influence of the [[Southern Netherlands|Spanish occupation]] and rising [[Protestantism]]. [[Human sexual activity|Sexual activities]] were only tolerated within marriage. Church and state were not separated, and what was defined by the church as a [[sin]] was defined as a crime by the government. Prostitution and [[procurement]] were viewed as a sin and therefore prohibited. However, during this century the city of [[Amsterdam]] started to regulate prostitution. Only the police and the [[bailiff]] and his servants could keep a brothel in the Pijl and Halsteeg (currently the [[Damstraat (Amsterdam)|Damstraat]]). Prostitutes who practiced their trade in other parts of the city were arrested and their clients fined. Prostitution was a lucrative trade for the bailiff's servants as well as for the city treasury. In 1578, the city of Amsterdam left the Spanish side during the Netherlands uprising and converted from Catholicism to [[Calvinism]]. The city then stopped regulating prostitution.

===17th century: ''laissez-faire''===
[[Calvinistic]] morals were mirrored in the government policies of the seventeenth century. Titillating activities like dancing, fairs and prostitution were sometimes outlawed. This morality did not, however, always correspond with the views and customs of the people. During the Golden seventeenth century sexuality was openly displayed in paintings and in literature. The image of the prostitute in literature was very negative. Prostitutes were portrayed as unreliable, impudent, lazy, and often ugly and dirty. In paintings, the image of the prostitute was more positive. Brothel-scenes were an important subject and prostitutes were painted as beautiful young women. The clients, however, were portrayed as fools who allowed themselves to be deceived. In both literature and paintings the [[madam]]s were portrayed as evil profiteers. The authorities could not uphold the laws against prostitution and tended to leave brothels alone if they did not cause trouble.

===18th century: middle class adopts stringent morals===
During the eighteenth century the morals preached by the church and government became more in line with certain developments within Dutch society. There was a growing middle class which tried to distinguish itself by a strong [[work ethic]] and [[self-control]]. By restrained sexual behavior, the middle class could separate itself from the 'loose' [[Working class|lower class]] as well as the indecent [[nobility]]. Rich and poor also began to separate geographically. Prior to this period different social classes lived side by side, but they now lived in separate neighborhoods. The image of women also changed. Bourgeois women were seen by men of their class as faithful and chaste, but working-class women were viewed by middle class men as potential prostitutes.

The [[working condition]]s of prostitutes were very poor. There was no proper [[birth control]], [[condom]]s were not widely available and there were no effective cures against [[venereal diseases]]. Prostitutes often became pregnant and, because of venereal diseases they eventually became [[infertile]]. This situation would not improve before the twentieth century.

Prostitutes allowed very little sexual variation. The only sexual positions which were tolerated were the missionary position and standing upright, face to face.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} [[Anal sex]], [[kiss]]ing, and [[oral sex]] were strictly [[taboo]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

===Napoleonic mandatory registration and medical examination===
In the beginning of the nineteenth century the armies of [[Napoleon]] started to regulate prostitution in the Netherlands (in 1810) to protect soldiers against venereal diseases. Prostitutes were forced to register and were subjected to mandatory medical examinations. Registered prostitutes were handed a red card which was a sort of [[work permit]]. If they were found to be infected, their red card was taken and they were given a white card instead while they were prohibited from working and were only allowed to work when declared fit. After the French occupation the Dutch government stopped regulating prostitution, but during several decades slowly began to regulate prostitutes again in the same style as under the French occupation. Many scientists during the nineteenth century believed that sexual [[abstinence]] for men was unhealthy. In their eyes it was unavoidable that a number of women had to sacrifice themselves to protect the rest of the women from destruction of an even more revolting kind. The women who had to sacrifice themselves were supposed to be lower class. Prostitutes themselves, however, were still despised and portrayed as disgusting creatures. Lower-class people themselves detested prostitutes. Prostitutes stood outside society.{{citation needed |date=August 2018}}

===Abolitionists outlaw the owning of brothels===
During the 19th century, sexual morals became stricter, and a [[counter movement]] arose against regulated prostitution. In the beginning, this movement consisted of wealthy orthodox-Protestant Christians, but it later got support from other movements like Catholics, socialists, feminists and [[progressive liberals]]. They attacked the idea that men could not abstain from sex. Clients were viewed as low, dirty [[lechery|lechers]], and the clients were not the young unmarried men prostitution was meant for, but were often well-off middle-aged married men. They also attacked the mandatory medical examinations, which were deemed degrading and ineffective to stop the spread of venereal diseases. Many prostitutes lived in the brothels and were bound to the madams by debts to pay off expensive working clothes. Prostitutes were often sold among madams, were subjected to fines, and could only leave the brothel under supervision. Medical expenses were added to their debt. Brothel keepers throughout Europe sold women among each other. The [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement in the Netherlands was largely connected to the international abolitionist movement. The movement slowly gained more influence, and during the last decades of the nineteenth century city governments slowly started to abolish regulated prostitution. At first, the abolitionist movement mainly targeted mandatory health checks for prostitutes, but when the movement became more successful the focus shifted towards the people who profited from prostitution. In 1911 living on the avails of prostitution and owning a brothel were prohibited by law. Prostitution itself was not prohibited.

=== 20th century: toleration and eventual legalization ===

Until the 1970s, prostitutes in the Netherlands were predominantly white lower-class women from the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Northern Germany. During the 1970s, in the wake of the [[sex tourism|sex trips]] to South-East Asia by Dutch men, the sex operators brought in women from Thailand and the Philippines. In the 1980s there was a second wave from Latin America and Africa. In the 1990s, after the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], women came from Eastern Europe. Foreign prostitutes are economically motivated to come to the Netherlands, and they tend to travel to engage in sex work between the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, and other European societies.

During the second half of the twentieth century, prostitution and brothels were condoned and tolerated by many local governments. The police only interfered when public order was at stake or in cases of human trafficking. The reasoning behind this ''gedoogbeleid'' (policy of tolerance) was [[harm reduction]], and the belief that the enforcement of the anti-prostitution laws would be counterproductive, and that the best way to protect the women was to tolerate prostitution. This genuine Dutch policy of tolerating formally illegal activities for harm reduction purposes has been and still is also applied towards illegal drugs in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=brants/&gt; (See [[drug policy of the Netherlands]].)

[[The Red Thread (De Rode Draad)|The Red Thread]] (''de Rode Draad'') is a support and advocacy association for prostitutes that was founded in 1985 and works for the legitimization and against the stigmatization of prostitutes.

Prostitution was defined as a legal profession in January 1988.

Brothel prohibition made it difficult to set rules for the sex industry. During the eighties many municipalities urged the national government to lift the ban on brothels. In 1983 minister Korthals Altes had presented an amendment to the law on prostitution. It took until 1 October 2000 for brothels to leave the half-legal status of being tolerated and to become fully legal and licensed businesses. Prostitutes may work as regular employees, though the vast majority work as independent contractors. The Dutch union [[Federatie Nederlandse Vakbeweging|FNV]] has accepted prostitutes as members since that time.

In the 1990s, Dutch attitudes supported the legalization of prostitution: in a 1997 survey, 73 percent of Dutch citizens favored legalization of brothels, 74 percent said that prostitution was an "acceptable job", and in a 1999 poll 78 percent felt that prostitution is a job like any other job (polls cited in [[Ronald Weitzer|Weitzer]] 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;178).

===21st century: reducing the size of the Red-light district===
When the Dutch government legalized prostitution in 2000, it was to protect the women by giving them work permits, but authorities now fear that this business is out of control: "We've realized this is no longer about small-scale entrepreneurs, but that big crime organizations are involved here in trafficking women, drugs, killings and other criminal activities", said [[Job Cohen]], the former mayor of Amsterdam.&lt;ref name=nyt8&gt;{{cite news | title = Amsterdam tries upscale fix for red light district crime | first = Marlise | last = Simons | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/world/europe/24amsterdam.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all | newspaper = New York Times | date = 24 February 2008 | accessdate =9 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, officials have noticed an increase in violence centered on this irregular industry, and have blamed this increase on the illegal immigration of individuals into Amsterdam to participate in the sex industry: "The guys from Eastern Europe bring in young and frightened women; they threaten them and beat them", said a resident of [[De Wallen]].&lt;ref name=nyt8/&gt; Prostitution has remained connected to criminal activities, which has led the authorities to take several measures, including detailed plans to help the prostitutes quit the sex trade and find other professions.

In 2005 Amma Asante and [[Karina Content|Karina Schaapman]], two councilors for the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)]], wrote a report, "Het onzichtbare zichtbaar gemaakt" (Making the Invisible Visible). Schaapman had once been a prostitute and was getting information about the influx of organized crime and violence into the business. Other reports came out around the same time. They concluded that a large number of prostitutes in Amsterdam were being forced to work and were being abused by pimps and criminal gangs, and that the goals of legalization were failing.&lt;ref&gt;Abuses in Prostitution, Trouw, 12 December 2005, by Dorien Pels, reprinted at [http://fleshtrade.blogspot.com/2006/02/abuses-in-prostitution.html fleshtrade] blog retr dec 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Placing Prostitution: Formalizing the Spatial-Sexual Order of Amsterdamby Michaël Deinema Co-authored with Manuel Aalbers, Paper presented at the Conference "Imagining Amsterdam: Visions and Revisions", Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 21 November 2009, [https://uva.academia.edu/MichaëlDeinema/Papers/575631/Placing_Prostitution_Formalizing_the_Spatial-Sexual_Order_of_Amsterdam at academia.edu] Retrieved December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the problems associated with the involvement of  [[organized crime]] into the sex trade, the Dutch government has decided to close numerous prostitution businesses. Concerned about organized crime, money laundering and human trafficking, Amsterdam officials under Mayor Cohen denied the license renewals of about 30 brothels in the Amsterdam Red-light district De Wallen in 2006; the brothel owners appealed. To counter negative news reports, the district organized an open house day in 2007 and a statue to an unknown sex worker was unveiled, "intended to honor those employed in the industry world-wide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Visitors flood Amsterdam's red-light district | first1 = Alexandra | last1 = Hudson | first2 = Anna | last2 = Mudeva | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL2932075720070331 | agency = Reuters | date = 31 March 2007 | accessdate =9 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2007 it was announced that the city of Amsterdam was buying several buildings in the Red-light district from [[Charles Geerts (businessman)|Charles Geerts]] in order to close about a third of the windows.&lt;ref name=obs0709&gt;{{cite news | title = Amsterdam closes a window on its red-light tourist trade | first = Anushka | last = Asthana | url = https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/sep/23/travelnews.amsterdam | newspaper = [[The Observer]] | publisher = [[Guardian Media Group]] | date = 23 September 2007 | accessdate =9 June 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2008, Mayor Cohen announced plans to close half of the city's 400 prostitution windows because of suspected criminal gang activity. The mayor is also closing some of the city's 70 marijuana cafes and sex clubs.&lt;ref name="timesonline.co.uk"/&gt; This comes at the same time as the Government's decision to ban the sale of "[[magic mushrooms]]" and the closure of all coffee shops situated near schools.&lt;ref name="timesonline.co.uk"/&gt; Nevertheless, Mayor Cohen has noted, "It is not that we want to get rid of our Red-light district. We want to reduce it. Things have become unbalanced and if we do not act we will never regain control."&lt;ref name="timesonline.co.uk"/&gt;

In 2009 the [[Ministry of Justice (Netherlands)|Dutch justice ministry]] announced the appointment of a special public prosecutor charged with closing down prostitution windows and coffee shops connected to organized crime syndicates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Amsterdam courts ready to clean up red light district | first = Adriana | last = Stuijt | url = http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/265520 | newspaper = DigitalJournal.com | date = 19 January 2009 | accessdate =9 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A law proposal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/zoeken/resultaat/?zkt=Uitgebreid&amp;pst=ParlementaireDocumenten&amp;dpr=Alle&amp;dosnr=32211&amp;kmr=EersteKamerderStatenGeneraal%7cTweedeKamerderStatenGeneraal%7CVerenigdeVergaderingderStatenGeneraal&amp;sdt=KenmerkendeDatum&amp;par=Agenda%7CHandeling%7cKamerstuk%7cAanhangselvandeHandelingen%7cKamervragenzonderantwoord%7cNietdossierstuk%7cBijlage&amp;dst=Onopgemaakt%7cOpgemaakt%7cOpgemaakt+na+onopgemaakt&amp;isp=true&amp;pnr=1&amp;rpp=10|title=Parliamentary documentation on proposal 32211| publisher=Zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced in the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands]] in 2009 and amended in 2010 which would ban prostitution by people younger than 21. Prostitutes are required to register; they receive a registration pass with a photograph and a registration number, but no name or other personal data. Clients are required to check this pass. In addition to municipal rules a national rule is introduced requiring [[Sex industry|sex companies]] to have a license, including prostitution companies such as [[brothel]]s and [[escort agency|escort agencies]], but also, for example, [[Adult movie theater#Netherlands|adult movie theaters]]. Under the proposed amendments, an advertisement of an individual prostitute should contain his or her registration number, an advertisement of a sex company should contain its license number. The premises for public access of a sex company (if any) should have on the outside a sign showing that the company is licensed, while inside a copy of the license has to be displayed.
A vote on the law has been deferred to allow both sides to examine the matter more closely.

The 70-year-old twin sisters Louise and Martine Fokkens, who have worked for decades as prostitutes in the Red-light districts of Amsterdam, were the subject of a 2011 film and a 2012 book. In a 2012 interview they complained that the legalisation of 2000 had led to more criminality and to taxation of the trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Meet the oldest prostitutes in Amsterdam – they're 70-year-old twins|author=|date=17 September 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/17/oldest-prostitutes-amsterdam-70-twins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in the Netherlands}}
Countries that are major sources of trafficked persons include Thailand, India, The Netherlands, Mexico, China, Nigeria, Albania, Bulgaria, Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine, Sierra Leone, and Romania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/category,COI,,,ABW,484f9a2f3c,0.html |title=Refworld &amp;#124; Trafficking in Persons Report 2008 – The Netherlands |publisher=UNHCR |date=4 June 2008 |accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to figures obtained from the National Centre against Human Trafficking, there were 1,711 registered presumed victims of human trafficking in 2012, of whom 1,177 were women forced to work in the [[sex industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lastradainternational.org/news-publications/comensha-figures-2012 |title=CoMensha figures 2012 La Strada International |publisher=lastradainternational.org |accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an increase in identified presumed victims does not necessarily mean an increase in trafficking but can be caused by, for instance, better awareness and cooperation among the different agencies which come into contact with potential victims.

Within the Netherlands, victims are often recruited by so-called "loverboys" – men who seduce young Dutch women and girls and later coerce them into prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=San|first1=Marion van|last2=Bovenkerk|first2=Frank|title=Secret seducers|journal=Crime, Law and Social Change|volume=60|pages=67–80|language=en|doi=10.1007/s10611-013-9436-z|date=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon was highlighted in 2008 by [[:NL:Maria Mosterd|Maria Mosterd]], who published a book about her ordeal as the 12-year-old victim of a loverboy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/18/loverboy-child-prostitution-netherlands|title='Loverboys' child prostitution scandal back in Dutch spotlight|date=18 August 2009|newspaper=The Guardian | first=Angelique | last=Chrisafis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The truthfulness of this book is disputed, and was the subject of an investigative journalism report.

Many victims of human trafficking are led to believe by organized criminals that they are being offered work in hotels or restaurants or in child care and are forced into prostitution with the threat or actual use of violence. Estimates of the number of victims vary from 1,000 to 7,000 on a yearly basis. Most police investigations on human trafficking concern legal sex businesses. All sectors of prostitution are well represented in these investigations, but particularly the window brothels are overrepresented.

At the end of 2008, a gang of six people was sentenced to prison terms of eight months to 7½ years in what prosecutors said was the worst case of [[human trafficking]] ever brought to trial in the Netherlands. The case involved more than 100 female victims, violently forced to work in prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-07-11-Dutch-human-trafficking_N.htm|newspaper=USA Today|date=11 July 2008|title=Six get heavy sentences in Dutch human trafficking trial}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2009, two Nigerian men were sentenced to 4 and 4½ years in prison for having smuggled 140 Nigerian women aged 16–23 into the Netherlands. The women were made to apply for asylum and then disappeared from asylum centers, to work as prostitutes in surrounding countries. The men were said to have used "[[West African Vodun|voodoo]]" curses on the women to prevent escape and enforce payment of debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|date=4 December 2009|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/World/Story/A1Story20091204-183926.html|title=Nigerians jailed in Dutch 'voodoo curse' prostitution trial|work=Asia One}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Redevelopment''' is any new construction on a site that has pre-existing uses.

==Description==
Variations on redevelopment include:

* Urban [[infill]] on vacant parcels that have no existing activity but were previously developed, especially on [[Brownfield land]], such as the redevelopment of an industrial site into a [[mixed-use development]].
* Constructing with a denser land usage, such as the redevelopment of a block of townhouses into a large apartment building.
* [[Adaptive reuse]], where older structures are converted for improved current market use, such as an industrial mill into housing lofts.

Redevelopment projects can be small or large ranging from a single building to entire new neighborhoods or "new town in town" projects.

Redevelopment also refers to state and federal statutes which give cities and counties the authority to establish redevelopment agencies and give the agencies the authority to attack problems of urban decay.  The  fundamental tools of a redevelopment agency include the authority to acquire real property,  the power of eminent domain, to develop and sell property without bidding and  the authority and responsibility of relocating persons who have interests in the property acquired by the agency. The financing/funding of such operations might come from government grants, borrowing from federal or state governments and selling bonds and from [[Tax Increment Financing]].

Other terms sometimes used to describe redevelopment include [[urban renewal]] (urban revitalization).  While efforts described as urban revitalization often involve redevelopment, they do not always involve redevelopment as they do not always involve the demolition of any existing structures but may instead describe the rehabilitation of existing buildings or other neighborhood improvement initiatives.

A new example of other neighborhood improvement initiatives is the funding mechanism associated with high [[carbon footprint]] [[air quality]] [[urban blight]]. Assembly Bill [[AB811]] is the [[State of California]]'s answer to funding [[renewable energy]] and allows cities to craft their own sustainability action plans. These cutting edge action plans needs the funding structure; which can easily come forward through redevelopment funding.

==Urban renewal==
{{main|Urban renewal}}
Some redevelopment projects and programs have been incredibly controversial including the [[Urban Renewal]] program in the United States in the mid-twentieth century or the [[urban regeneration]] program in Great Britain. Controversy usually results either from the use of [[eminent domain]], from objections to the change in use or increases in density and intensity on the site or from disagreement on the appropriate use of tax-payer funds to pay for some element of the project.
Urban redevelopment in the United States has been controversial because it forcibly displaces poor and lower middle class populations and turns over their land to wealthy redevelopers for free or for a below-market-value price. They  then use that land to construct private shopping malls, office buildings, automobile factories and dealerships, and even gambling casinos. This is done and permitted by American courts in spite of the fact that the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] allows the use of eminent domain only for "public use."{{Source needed|date=July 2013}}

The residents displaced by redevelopment are routinely undercompensated,{{Source needed|date=July 2013}} and some (notably month-to-month tenants and business owners) are not compensated at all. Historically, redevelopment agencies have been buying many properties in redevelopment areas for prices below their fair market value, or even below the agencies' own appraisal figures because the displaced people are often unaware of their legal rights and lack the will and the funds to mount a proper legal defense in a valuation trial. Those who do so usually recover more in compensation than what is offered by the redevelopment agencies.

The controversy over misuse of eminent domain for redevelopment reached a climax in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2005 5 to 4 decision in ''Kelo v. City of New London,'' allowing redevelopment takings of sound, unblighted homes, solely to allow redevelopers to put the taken land to more profitable uses and thus increase the revenue flow to the local municipality. The ''Kelo'' decision was widely denounced and remains the subject of severe criticism. Remedial legislation has been introduced and in some cases passed, in a number of states.

==Golf course redevelopment==
'''Golf course redevelopment''', also known as golf course conversion is a [[real estate]] niche, in which investors purchase failing golf courses. Investors then subdivide the golf course into individual plots of lands. They then resell the plots of land for builders, or build on the plots then resell it to residential home buyers. This process is usually done with the assistance of a [[real estate broker]].

The main challenge of this niche is the difficulties that investors face in requesting a [[Variance (land use)|variance]] from cities.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Sawi''' or '''Sawuy''' are a tribal people of [[Western New Guinea]], [[Indonesia]]. They were known to be [[cannibal]]istic&lt;ref&gt;Tucker (1983), p. 476&lt;/ref&gt; [[Headhunting|headhunters]] as recently as the 1950s.

Since then, many of the tribe have converted to [[Christianity]] and the world's largest circular building made strictly from un-milled poles was constructed in 1972 as a Christian meeting place by the Sawi.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker (1983), p. 478&lt;/ref&gt; Christian missionary [[Don Richardson (missionary)|Don Richardson]] who lived among the Sawi wrote a book about the experience called ''Peace Child''.

'''People with intellectual disabilities''' can be both the [[Sexual violence#Victims|victims]] and [[Sexual violence#Causes and factors|perpetrators]] of [[sexual violence]] (often termed '''sexual abuse'''), including [[child sexual abuse]].  Prevalence rates of sexual violence against people with [[Intellectual disability|intellectual disabilities]] are high when compared with the experience of the general population.&lt;ref name=Sullivan /&gt;{{rp|61}}  Whilst people with intellectual disabilities experience sexual violence in many of the same ways as the general population,&lt;ref name=Brown /&gt;&lt;ref name=Thompson /&gt;{{rp|73}} they may encounter additional issues relating to their impairments and the social environments in which they live.  These can include increased vulnerability, questions around ability to consent to sexual activities, differential treatment before the law, social attitudes about intellectual disability and sexuality, and restricted access to suitable support and recovery services.

==Prevalence and incidence==
There are large differences between the [[prevalence]] and [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] estimates from different pieces of research: results are affected by a number of factors:
* Differences in how sexual abuse is defined, and which experiences are counted as abuse for research purposes.
* Who is asked about the abuse: reported prevalence and incidence are lower if service managers, staff or case notes are consulted, and higher when people with intellectual disabilities are asked directly.
* Whether abuse rates for men and women are combined or calculated separately.
* Differences between the groups of people selected to take part in the research.&lt;ref name="McCarthy"&gt;Michelle McCarthy, Sexuality and Women with Learning Disabilities, Second Edition, Jessica Kingsley Publishers, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|72}}

Morris showed, in a British study in 1999, that incidence data on sexual abuse of disabled children can be difficult to compile because:
* A common definition of impairment may not have been agreed between the parties making records.
* Information may not be recorded consistently.
* Some children with mild or moderate intellectual disabilities may not be registered with the services that usually record abuse incidents.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, J. (1999) 'Disabled children, child protection systems and the Children Act.' Child Abuse Review 8, 91-108, cited in Michelle McCarthy, Sexuality and Women with Learning Disabilities, Second Edition, Jessica Kingsley Publishers, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|62–63}}

The highest rate of occurrence of abuse happens within the place of residence of the persons with intellectual disabilities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCarthy|first=Michelle|last2=Thompson|first2=David|date=1997-06|title=A Prevalence Study of Sexual Abuse of Adults with Intellectual Disabilities Referred for Sex Education|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-3148.1997.tb00012.x|journal=Journal of Applied Research in Intellectual Disabilities|language=en|volume=10|issue=2|pages=105–124|doi=10.1111/j.1468-3148.1997.tb00012.x|issn=1360-2322}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other areas of frequency where abuse occurs were at the perpetrator's home and in other public places, such as public toilets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===United States of America===
Studies indicate that people with intellectual disabilities are four to ten times more likely to have acts of violence committed against them.&lt;ref name=sorensen&gt;{{cite web|last=Sorensen|first=David D|title=The Invisible Victims: an update of an article originally published in Prosecutor’s  Brief: the California District Attorneys Associations Quarterly Journal|url=http://aspires-relationships.com/the_invisible_victims.pdf|date=9 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dick Sobsey, Associate Director of the [http://dascentre.educ.ualberta.ca/ JP Das Developmental Disabilities Centre] and Director of the [https://www.ualberta.ca/~bioethic/ John Dossetor Health Ethics Centre], found that 80% out of 162 people with developmental and substantial disabilities who had been sexually assaulted had been sexually assaulted more than once.&lt;ref name=sobsey&gt;{{cite news|last=Sobsey|first=D|title=Relative victimization risk rates: people with intellectual disabilities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sobsey estimates that between 15,000 and 19,000 individuals with intellectual disabilities experience [[rape]] each year.&lt;ref name=sobsey /&gt;

It is believed by some that 20% of females and 10% of males are sexually abused in the US every year. The percentage is even higher among people with disabilities. According to research, more than 90% of people with intellectual disabilities will experience some form of sexual abuse at some time in their lives. 49% will experience 10 or more abusive incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Valenti-Heim|first=D.|author2=Schwartz, L. |title=The Sexual Abuse Interview for Those with Developmental Disabilities|date=1995|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=153917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies suggest 68% of girls with intellectual disabilities and 30% of boys with intellectual disabilities will be sexually abused before their 18th birthday. According to research 15,000 to 19,000 people with intellectual disabilities are [[rape]]d each year in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sobsey|first=Dick|title=Violence and abuse in the lives of people with disabilities : the end of silent acceptance?|year=1994|publisher=Brookes|location=Baltimore u.a.|isbn=1557661480}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sullivan and Knutson found, in 2000, that children with intellectual disabilities were at slightly greater risk of sexual abuse than disabled children in general, who in turn were at 3.14 times greater risk of experiencing sexual abuse than non-disabled children.&lt;ref name=Sullivan&gt;Sullivan, P. and Knutson, J. (2000) 'Maltreatment and disabilities: a population based epidemiological study.' Child abuse and Neglect 22, 4, 271 - 288, cited in Higgins, M. and Swain, J. (2010), Disability and Child Sexual Abuse, Jessica Kingsley Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61}}

===Britain===
A study by McCarthy and Thompson in 1997 found a prevalence rate of 25% for men and 61% for women.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;McCarthy, M. and Thompson, D. (1997) 'A prevalence study of sexual abuse of adults with intellectual disabilities referred for sex education.' Journal of Applied Research in Intellectual Disability 10, 2, 105-124, cited in Michelle McCarthy, Sexuality and Women with Learning Disabilities, Second Edition, Jessica Kingsley Publishers, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|71}}  A survey by Brown et al. of senior managers in 1992 found an incidence rate of 0.5 per thousand people with intellectual disabilities each year.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;Brown, H., Stein, J. and Turk, V. (1995) 'The sexual abuse of adults with learning disabilities: Report of a second two-year incidence survey.'  Mental Handicap Research 8, 1, 3-24, cited in Michelle McCarthy, Sexuality and Women with Learning Disabilities, Second Edition, Jessica Kingsley Publishers, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|71}}

===The Republic of Ireland===
A study by Dunne and Power in 1990 found an incidence rate of 2.88 per thousand people with intellectual disabilities per year.&lt;ref&gt;Dunne, T. and Power, A. (1990) 'Sexual abuse and mental handicap: Preliminary findings from a community based study,' Mental Handicap Research 3, 111-125, cited in Michelle McCarthy, Sexuality and Women with Learning Disabilities, Second Edition, Jessica Kingsley Publishers, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|71}}

===Spain===
A study by Gil-Llario, Morell-Mengual, Ballester-Arnal and Díaz-Rodríguez in 2017 found a prevalence rate of 2.8% for men and 9.4% for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{citejournal|last1=Gil-Llario|first1=Mª Dolores|last2=Morell-Mengual|first2=Vicente|last3=Ballester-Arnal|first3=Rafael|last4=Díaz-Rodríguez|first4=Irene |title=The experience of sexuality in adults with intellectual disability|journal=Journal of Intellectual Disability Research|date=2017|doi=10.1111/jir.12455}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the women who were abused, only 52.9% trusted someone enough to tell them about what had happened. Of these, 28.6% preferred to tell a close relative, 57.1% told an educator and 14.3% talked to a friend about it. Of the men, 80% decided to talk about their experience of abuse. Half of them (50%) told their father or mother, 25% talked to an educator and 25% discussed the matter with a close relative.

Another Spanish study indicates that the prevalence of sexual abuse is 6.10% when it is self‐reported (9.4% in women and 2.8% in men) and 28.6% when it is reported by professionals (27.8% in women and 29.4% in men).&lt;ref&gt;{{citejournal|last1=Gil-Llario|first1=Mª Dolores|last2=Morell-Mengual|first2=Vicente|last3=Díaz-Rodríguez|first3=Irene|last4=Ballester-Arnal|first4=Rafael|title=Prevalence and sequelae of self‐reported and other‐reported sexual abuse in adults with intellectual disability|journal=Journal of Intellectual Disability Research|date=2018|doi=10.1111/jir.12555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk factors==
A number of factors put people with intellectual disabilities at an increased risk of sexual violence.  [[Medical model of disability|Medical models of disability]] emphasise risks connected with the person's disability, while [[Social model of disability|social models of disability]] focus on risks caused by the socially-created environment of the intellectually disabled person.&lt;ref name=hollomotz&gt;Hollomotz, Andrea, 2011, Learning Difficulties and Sexual Vulnerability, Jessica Kingsley Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16}}  Not all factors will apply to all people with intellectual disabilities, and some are not exclusive to people with intellectual disabilities.

* Lack of understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sobsey|first=D|title=Special Education Across Canada|year=1989|publisher=Vancouver Centre for Human  Developmental and Research|location=Vancouver|author2=Varnhagen, C. |editor=Csapo M., Gougen L|pages=199–218|chapter=Sexual abuse and exploitation of people with disabilities: Toward prevention and treatment}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lack of social awareness and training that would help identify and anticipate abusive situations.&lt;ref name=mencap /&gt;{{rp|4}}
* Ingrained reliance on the caregiver authority figure.&lt;ref name=sobsey /&gt;
* Long-term dependence on services and personal care.&lt;ref name=mencap /&gt;{{rp|4}}
* Emotional and social insecurities.&lt;ref name=sobsey /&gt;

* Communication difficulties that hinder reporting abuse.&lt;ref name=mencap /&gt;{{rp|4}}
* Fear of not being believed, leading to non-reporting of abuse.&lt;ref name=mencap /&gt;{{rp|4}}
* Feelings of guilt or shame that prevent reporting of abuse.&lt;ref name=mencap /&gt;{{rp|4}}
* Difficulty identifying an appropriate person to report the abuse to.&lt;ref name=mencap /&gt;{{rp|4}}
* Low risk of prosecution for perpetrators.&lt;ref name=mencap /&gt;{{rp|5}}
* Routine prescription of contraceptives to women with intellectual disabilities, leading to reduced risk of detection for perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, M. and Carlson, G. (1993) "The legal trends: Implications for menstruation / fertility management for young women who have an intellectual disability.' International Journal of Disability, Development and Education 40, 2, 133-157, cited in Michelle McCarthy, Sexuality and Women with Learning Disabilities, Second Edition, Jessica Kingsley Publishers, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|225}}

People with moderate to severe intellectual disabilities, and those with additional physical disabilities, form the majority of learning disabled people experiencing sexual violence.&lt;ref name=mencap /&gt;{{rp|5}}

==Perpetrator profile==
Research suggests that 97% to 99% of abusers are known and trusted by the victim who has the intellectual disability.&lt;ref name=balderian&gt;{{cite journal|last=Balderian|first=N|title=Sexual abuse of people with developmental disabilities|journal=Sexuality and Disability|year=1991|volume=9|issue=4|pages=323–335|doi=10.1007/BF01102020}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Sobsey and Doe's 1991 analysis of 162 reports of sexual abuse against people with intellectual disabilities, the largest percentage of offenders (28%) were service providers (direct care staff members, personal care attendants, psychiatrists). In addition, 19% of sexual offenders were natural or stepfamily members, 15.2% were acquaintances (neighbors, family friends), 9.8% were informal paid service providers (babysitters), and 3.8% were dates. Further, 81.7% of the victims were women, and 90.8% of the offenders were men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sobsey|first=D.|author2=Doe, T |title=Patterns of sexual abuse and assault. Sexuality and Disability|journal=Sexuality and Disability|year=1991|volume=9|issue=3|pages=243–259.|doi=10.1007/bf01102395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCarthy identifies people with intellectual disabilities who are current or past users of services as another significant group of perpetrators.&lt;ref name="McCarthy"/&gt;{{rp|73}}

==Law==

===United States of America===
Cases of sexual abuse are considered in many states to qualify as “sexual assault” under the law; sexual assault is often arbitrated through rape or [[sexual battery]] statutes. Cases of sexual assault are arbitrated differently according to individual state laws and statutes.

States often have statutes for the intellectually disabled person separate from the general sex offense statutes. Such separate statutes often hold the intellectually disabled person at a “higher standard” than the non-intellectually-disabled person; that is, the legal standards used to prove sexual consent will be stricter for the intellectually disabled individual.&lt;ref name=morano&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morano|first=JP|title=Sexual Abuse of the Mentally Retarded Patient: Medical and Legal Analysis for the Primary Care Physician.|journal=Primary care companion to the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|date=June 2001|volume=3|issue=3|pages=126–135|pmid=15014610|pmc=181173|doi=10.4088/pcc.v03n0304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Deborah Denno|Deborah W. Denno]], Ph.D., J.D., of the [[Fordham University School of Law]] explains, &lt;blockquote&gt;“courts have applied vague, unworkable tests in determining a mentally retarded victim's capacity to consent; it would be unrealistic to suggest that a rigid, precisely defined standard could ever be effective in so amorphous an area as sexual relations.”&lt;ref name=morano /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Capacity to consent====
Six tests are used as such a standard to assess the [[legal capacity]] of the intellectually disabled individual to consent to sexual conduct. These are the tests of “nature and consequences”, “morality”, “nature of the conduct”, “totality of the circumstances”, “evidence of mental disability”, and “judgment”. 49 American states use one of these six tests in reviewing cases of sexual abuse, with the exception of [[Illinois]] (which uses two tests).&lt;ref name=morano /&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Test name !! Description !! States using this test
|-
| Nature of the conduct || The individual must understand the sexual nature of any sexual conduct and the voluntary aspect of such activity, but does not have to understand the nature and consequences of such sexual activity, or the morality of the conduct.&lt;ref name=morano /&gt;
 || [[California]], [[Delaware]], [[Florida]], [[Kentucky]], [[Louisiana]], [[Maine]], [[Montana]], [[Nebraska]], [[Nevada]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New Jersey]], [[North Carolina]], [[North Dakota]], [[Ohio]], [[Oregon]], [[Rhode Island]], [[South Carolina]], [[Texas]], [[Utah]]: 38% of the USA.

|-
| Judgment || Ascertains whether the individual can exercise judgment regarding consent to sexual activity.&lt;ref name=morano /&gt; || [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Minnesota]]
|}

====Special protection====
Intellectually disabled people do get special protection under Australian law. In the penal code, a person is defined as mentally defective if they suffer from "a mental disease or defect which renders him or her incapable of appraising the nature of his or her conduct." The special protection granted to those with intellectual disabilities in these cases is akin to the statutory protection given to children. In cases of sexual abuse, actual consent is irrelevant, because the person is incapable of giving legal consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lombardi|first=Kate Stone|title=Rape and the Mentally Retarded|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/25/nyregion/rape-and-the-mentally-retarded.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|newspaper=The New York Times|date=25 July 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===England and Wales===
The [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]] defines sexual offences in general, including those perpetrated against or by adults or children.  The Act includes specific crimes against adults with intellectual disabilities or mental health conditions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;sexual abuse of vulnerable persons with a mental disorder. These include situations where:
* they are unable to refuse because of a lack of understanding,
* they are offered inducements, threatened or deceived, and
* there is a breach of a relationship of care, by a care worker;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cps.gov.uk/news/fact_sheets/sexual_offences/, The Crown Prosecution Service, "Sexual Offences Factsheet", accessed 12/11/14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reported crimes==
Daniel D. Sorensen, Chair of the Victims of Crime Committee, Criminal Justice Task Force for People with Developmental Disabilities estimates that less than 4.5% of crimes against people with intellectual disabilities in California are reported compared to the 44% of the general public who experience crimes.&lt;ref name=sorensen /&gt; The [[Seattle]] Rape Relief Project program for victims of sexual assault with intellectual disabilities conclude that there is underreporting of sexual assaults of victims with intellectual disabilities that exceed underreporting with other populations.&lt;ref name=sorensen /&gt; Several studies suggest 80-85% of criminal abuse of residents of institutions never reach the proper authorities.  The studies have found that 40% of those criminally abused and 40% of non-abusing staff of care facilities studied are reluctant to come forward with criminal abuse issues for fear of reprisals or retribution from administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Helm|first=R|title=Study finds abusers of disabled often their helpers|journal=The Edmonton Journal|year=1990|pages=C3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of sexual violence==
People with intellectual disabilities can be harmed by sexual violence.  The harm is often worse when the violence takes place over a long period and the perpetrator is known to the survivor.&lt;ref name=mencap /&gt;{{rp|6}}  The following effects have been reported, but may not be experienced by all learning disabled survivors of sexual violence:

* Psychological and emotional damage, such as depression, guilt, self-blame and low self-esteem.&lt;ref name=mencap /&gt;{{rp|5}}
* Physical injury.&lt;ref name=mencap /&gt;{{rp|5}}
* Pregnancy.&lt;ref name=mencap /&gt;{{rp|25}}
* Sexually transmitted disease.&lt;ref name=mencap /&gt;{{rp|25}}
* Damage (possibly permanent) to relationships of trust with caregivers, friends and family.&lt;ref name=mencap /&gt;{{rp|5}}
* Disturbed or otherwise changed behaviour, particularly for those who cannot communicate.&lt;ref name=mencap /&gt;{{rp|5}}

Individuals with intellectual disabilities can find it difficult to communicate when sexual abuse is occurring due to communication barriers. It is important for family members and caregivers to recognize some of the behavioral changes that could indicate when sexual abuse is occurring. Some of the following are behavioral changes that have been seen in some but not all victims of sexual abuse:

* Sleep disturbances including nightmares &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of child sexual abuse: Identification, assessment, and treatment|last=Goodyear-Brown|first=Paris|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc|year=2012|isbn=978-1-118-08292-8|location=New Jersey|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Decreased school performance &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Poor concentration &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Enuresis and encopresis&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Aggression&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Social withdraw&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Suicidal ideation&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Eating disturbances&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

{{Generations Sidebar}}
The '''Silent Generation''' is the demographic [[Cohort (statistics)|cohort]] following the cohort known in the United States as the [[G.I. Generation]]. There are no precise dates for when The Silent Generation starts or ends. Demographers and researchers typically use mid-to-late 1920s as starting birth years and early-to-mid 1940s as ending birth years for this cohort.

==Terminology==
It is unclear where the term originated, although it is widely accepted that the term "Silent Generation" comes from the focus on careers over activism. As young adults during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy Era]], many members of the Silent Generation felt it was dangerous to speak out.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook to Life in America, Volume 8 Rodney P. Carlisle Infobase Publishing, 2009, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine first used the term "Silent Generation" in a November 5, 1951 article titled "The Younger Generation", although the term appears to precede the publication.&lt;ref name="time.com"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,856950,00.html "The Younger Generation", ''Time'', November 5, 1951]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="forbes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education-portal.com/academy/lesson/the-silent-generation-definition-characteristics-facts.html|title=The Silent Generation: Definition, Characteristics &amp; Facts|access-date=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was originally applied to people in the United States and Canada but has been applied as well to those in [[Western Europe]], [[Australia]] and [[South America]]. It includes most of those who fought during the [[Korean War]]. In the United States, the generation was comparatively small because the financial insecurity of the 1930s and the war in the early 1940s caused people to have fewer children.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilhowe/2014/08/13/the-silent-generation-the-lucky-few-part-3-of-7/|title=The Silent Generation, "The Lucky Few" (Part 3 of 7)|date=30 July 2014|work=[[Forbes]]|access-date=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are noted as forming the leadership of the [[civil rights movement]] as well as comprising the “[[silent majority]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McLaughlin|first=Dan|title=Closing The Book On The Silent Generation|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/silent-generation-it-over/|publisher=[[National Review]]|date=16 February 2016|access-date=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have also been named the "Lucky Few" in the 2008 book ''The Lucky Few: Between the Greatest Generation and the Baby Boom'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carlson|first1=Elwood|title=The Lucky Few: Between the Greatest Generation and the Baby Boom|date=2008|publisher=Springer Science + Business Media B.V.|isbn=978-1-4020-8540-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="springer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Elwood|title=The Lucky Few: Between the Greatest Generation and the Baby Boom|year=2008|publisher=Springer Science and Business Media|location=Berlin|isbn=978-1-4020-8540-6|pages=1|url=https://www.springer.com/social+sciences/population+studies/book/978-1-4020-8540-6?otherVersion=978-1-4020-8850-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Elwood D. Carlson PhD, the Charles B.

He calls the people of this generation "The Lucky Few", because even though they were born during the Great Depression and World War II, they moved into adulthood during the relatively prosperous 1950s and early 1960s. For men who served in the Korean War, their military service was not marked by high casualties as much as the previous generation. The Lucky Few also had higher employment rates than the generations before and after them, as well as better health and earlier retirement. African Americans in this generation also did better than earlier generations in education and employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2008/luckyfew.aspx|title=The ‘Lucky Few’ Reveal the Lifelong Impact of Generation – Population Reference Bureau|website=www.prb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia's McCrindle Research uses the name ''Builders'' to describe the Australian members of this generation, born between 1925 and 1945, and coming of age to become the generation "who literally and metaphorically built [the] nation after the austerity years post-Depression and World War II".&lt;ref&gt;[http://mccrindle.com.au/resources/whitepapers/McCrindle-Research_ABC-01_Generations-Defined_Mark-McCrindle.pdf Generations Defined].

==Date and age range definitions==
[[Pew Research]] uses 1928 to 1945 as birth years for this cohort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Generations and Age|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/topics/generations-and-age/|accessdate=26 May 2018|publisher=Pew Research|date=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/methodology/demographic-research/definitions/|title=Definitions - Pew Research Center|website=www.pewresearch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Resolution Foundation]], in a report titled ''Cross Countries: International comparisons of international trends'', uses 1926 to 1945 as birth dates for the Silent Generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rahman|first1=Fahmida|title=Cross Countries: International comparisons of intergenerational trends|url=https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/app/uploads/2018/02/IC-international.pdf|accessdate=26 May 2018|publisher=Resolution Foundation|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demographers [[Strauss–Howe generational theory|William Strauss and Neil Howe]] use 1925–42 as birth years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strauss|first1=William|title=The Fourth Turning|date=2009|publisher=Three Rivers Press|asin=B001RKFU4I}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="forbes" /&gt;

If the Silent Generation is deemed to include persons born between 1925 and 1942, the generation produced no U.S. presidents.  The U.S. essentially "jumped from George Bush Sr., the World War II veteran, to [[Baby Boomer]] Bill Clinton".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howe|first1=Neil|title=The Silent Generation, "The Lucky Few" (Part 3 of 7)|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilhowe/2014/08/13/the-silent-generation-the-lucky-few-part-3-of-7/#526655872c63|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it did produce Vice Presidents [[Joe Biden]] (born 1942),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Page|first1=Susan|title=Analysis: Contrasts, common ground define Biden, Ryan|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2012/10/11/analysis-big-contrasts-common-ground-for-biden-and-ryan/1627969/|publisher=USA Today|date=October 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mclaughlin|first1=Dan|title=The Silent Generation: Is it Over?|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/431388/silent-generation-it-over|publisher=National Review|date=February 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dick Cheney]] (born 1941) and [[Walter Mondale]] (born 1928) and First Ladies [[Barbara Bush]] (born 1925), [[Rosalynn Carter]] (born 1927), and [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]] (born 1929).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2585">The '''Tenth [[Council of Toledo]]''' was summoned to meet on 1 December 656 by King [[Reccesuinth]]. In November 655, the bishops of [[Carthaginiensis]] held a provincial synod in Toledo, the [[Ninth Council of Toledo]]. They scheduled a second council for 1 November the next year, but a general council was called by the king.  

The tenth council was attended by only seventeen bishops and five deputies from Carthaginiensis and [[Gallaecia]].  The [[metropolitan of Toledo]], [[Eugenius IIIof Toledo|Eugenius II]], joined by his fellow metropolitans, [[Fugitivus of Seville]] and [[Potamius of Braga]], attended from [[Baetica]], but no bishops came from [[Tarraconensis]] or [[Gallia Narbonensis]]. This made it the most poorly attended of the great general councils of the ''Siglo de Concilios'' (7th century). 

The council declared that all clerical oathbreakers were to be defrocked and/or exiled, leaving it up to the king to decide whether both punishments were necessary. The council also expelled, from the family of the church, all clerics of all ranks who, in the future, were caught trading Christian slaves with Jews. The bishops further worked to ameliorate conflicts within the church and enforce ecclesiastic discipline. Potamius of Braga admitted to carnal sins and was retired to a monastery, replaced by [[Fructuosus of Braga|Fructuosus]], whose old see of [[Dumio]] had its own conflict. The last will and testament of the recently deceased bishop of Dumium, Riccimer, was disputed over those who saw his freeing of slaves and distribution of monies to the poor without compensation as responsible for the subsequent impoverishment of that see. It was given to his successor (Fructuosus) to decide exactly what to do, but his actions without compensation were considered unlawful. The council closed and Reccesuinth did not call another for the rest of his reign (672), which is thus an obscure era in Spanish history. 

As an aside, it is possible that the later [[King Wamba]] was summoned to produce the will of [[St Martin of Braga]] by Reccesuinth.

The '''Venona project''' was a [[counterintelligence]] program initiated by the United States Army's [[Signal Intelligence Service]] (later the [[National Security Agency]]) that ran from February 1, 1943 until October 1, 1980.{{sfn|Benson|2001|pp=7-8}} The purpose of the Venona project was the decryption of messages transmitted by the [[intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]] of the [[Soviet Union]] (e.g. the [[NKVD]], the [[KGB]], and the [[Main Intelligence Directorate (Soviet Union)|GRU]]).{{sfn|Benson|2001|p=5}} During the 37-year duration of the Venona project, the Signal Intelligence Service obtained approximately 3,000 Soviet messages (only a small fraction of which were ever decrypted);&lt;ref&gt;David Horner, Official History of ASIO, vol. 1, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[signals intelligence]] yield included discovery of the [[Cambridge Five]] espionage ring in the UK{{sfn|Benson|2001|p=34}} and Soviet espionage of the [[Manhattan Project]] in the U.S.{{sfn|Benson|2001|pp=20-22}} (project ENORMOS / операции энормоз) for the [[Soviet atomic bomb project]]. The Venona project remained secret for more than 15 years after it concluded, and some of the decoded Soviet messages were not declassified and published until 1995.

==Background==
[[File:GeneGrabeel.jpg|thumb|[[Gene Grabeel]], the first [[cryptoanalyst]] of the Venona project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/declass/venona/remembrances.shtml|title=Remembrances of Venona|first=Mr. William P.|last=Crowell|publisher=nsa.gov|date=11 July 1995|access-date=7 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305204040/https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/declass/venona/remembrances.shtml|archive-date=5 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

During the initial years of the [[Cold War]], the Venona project was a source of information on Soviet intelligence-gathering directed at the Western military powers. Although unknown to the public, and even to [[President of the United States|Presidents]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Harry S. Truman]], these programs were of importance concerning crucial events of the early Cold War. These included the [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]] spying case and the defections of [[Donald Duart Maclean|Donald Maclean]] and [[Guy Burgess]] to the [[Soviet Union]].

Most decipherable messages were transmitted and intercepted between 1942 and 1945. Sometime in 1945, the existence of the Venona program was revealed to the Soviet Union by [[cryptology|cryptologist]]-analyst [[Bill Weisband]], an [[NKVD]] agent in the U.S. Army’s [[SIGINT]].&lt;ref&gt;

To what extent the various individuals were involved with [[Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies|Soviet intelligence]] is a topic of [[Venona project#Critical views|dispute]]. While a number of academics and historians assert that most of the individuals mentioned in the Venona decrypts were most likely either clandestine assets and/or contacts of Soviet intelligence agents,&lt;ref&gt;''"How VENONA was Declassified"'', Robert Louis Benson, Symposium of Cryptologic History; October 27, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Tangled Treason", [[Sam Tanenhaus]], ''[[The New Republic]]'', 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; others argue that many of those people probably had no malicious intentions and committed no crimes.&lt;ref name="ghosts"/&gt;&lt;ref name=decrypts&gt;Tales from decrypts.

===Commencement===
The Venona Project was initiated on February 1, 1943 by [[Gene Grabeel]],{{sfn|Benson|2001|p=1}} an American mathematician and [[Cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst]], under orders from Colonel [[Carter W. Clarke]], Chief of Special Branch of the [[Military Intelligence Service (United States)|Military Intelligence Service]] at that time.&lt;ref name=Gilbert1993&gt;{{cite book|title=U.S. Army Signals Intelligence in World War II: a documentary history|chapter=Accepting the challenge|pages=48|publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]]|location=Washington, DC|year=1993|isbn=0-16-037816-8|editor-last=Gilbert|editor-first=James Leslie|editor2-last=Finnegan|editor2-first=John Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke distrusted [[Joseph Stalin]], and feared that the Soviet Union would sign a separate peace with [[Nazi Germany]], allowing Germany to focus its military forces against the United Kingdom and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/haynes-venona.html |title=Haynes &amp; Klehr '&amp;#39;New York Times'&amp;#39; 1999 |publisher=Nytimes.com |accessdate=2014-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cryptanalysts of the U.S. Army's Signal Intelligence Service at [[Arlington Hall]] analyzed encrypted high-level Soviet diplomatic intelligence messages intercepted in large volumes during and immediately after World War II by American, British, and Australian listening posts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yuri Modin]], ''My Five Cambridge Friends'', 1994, [[Ballantine Books]], {{ISBN|0-374-21698-3}}, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decryption==

This message traffic, which was encrypted with a [[one-time pad]] system, was stored and analyzed in relative secrecy by hundreds of cryptanalysts over a 40-year period starting in the early 1940s.  When used correctly, the one-time pad encryption system, which has been used  for all the most secret military and diplomatic communication since the 1930s, is unbreakable.  However, due to a serious blunder on the part of the Soviets, some of this traffic was vulnerable to cryptanalysis. The Soviet company that manufactured the one-time pads produced around 35,000 pages of duplicate key numbers, as a result of pressures brought about by the German advance on Moscow during World War II. The duplication—which undermines the security of a one-time system—was discovered and attempts to lessen its impact were made by sending the duplicates to widely separated users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/crypto_almanac_50th/venona_an_overview.pdf Cryptologic Almanac 50th Anniversary Series -- VENONA: An Overview (DOCID: 3575728)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304100650/https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/crypto_almanac_50th/VENONA_An_Overview.pdf |date=2016-03-04}}. Released by NSA on 06-12-2009, FOIA Case # 52567.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the reuse was detected by cryptanalysts in the US.

===Breakthrough===
[[File:Genevieve Grotjan Feinstein.jpg|thumb|[[Genevieve Feinstein]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic_heritage/women/honorees/feinstein.shtml |title=Women in Cryptologic History - Genevieve Feinstein - NSA/CSS |publisher=Nsa.gov |date=2009-01-15 |accessdate=2014-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Soviet systems in general used a [[code]] to convert words and letters into numbers, to which additive [[key (cryptography)|key]]s (from [[one-time pad]]s) were added, encrypting the content. When used correctly so that the plain text is of a length equal to or less than that of a random key, one-time pad encryption is unbreakable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world.std.com/~franl/crypto/one-time-pad.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516225512/http://www.world.std.com/~franl/crypto/one-time-pad.html |archivedate=2008-05-16 |title=Why Are One-Time Pads Perfectly Secure? |author=Francis Litterio}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, cryptanalysis by American and British code-breakers revealed that some of the one-time pad material had incorrectly been reused by the Soviets (specifically, entire pages, although not complete books), which allowed decryption (sometimes only partial) of a small part of the traffic.

Generating the one-time pads was a slow and labor-intensive process, and the outbreak of war with Germany in June 1941 caused a sudden increase in the need for coded messages. It is probable that the Soviet code generators started duplicating cipher pages in order to keep up with demand.

It was Arlington Hall's Lieutenant [[Richard Hallock (Venona Project)|Richard Hallock]], working on Soviet "Trade" traffic (so called because these messages dealt with Soviet trade issues), who first discovered that the Soviets were reusing pages. Hallock and his colleagues, amongst whom were [[Genevieve Feinstein]], [[Cecil Phillips]], [[Frank W. Lewis|Frank Lewis]], [[Frank Wanat]], and [[Lucille Campbell]], went on to break into a significant amount of Trade traffic, recovering many one-time pad additive key tables in the process.
[[File:Meredith Gardner, at far left, working with cryptanalysts.jpg|thumb|[[Meredith Gardner]] (far left); most of the other code breakers were young women.]] &lt;!-- yes, Meredith's a man --&gt;
A young [[Meredith Gardner]] then used this material to break into what turned out to be [[NKVD]] (and later [[Main Intelligence Directorate|GRU]]) traffic by reconstructing the code used to convert text to numbers. [[Samuel P. Chew|Samuel Chew]] and [[Cecil Phillips]] also made valuable contributions. On 20 December 1946, Gardner made the first break into the code, revealing the existence of Soviet espionage in the [[Manhattan Project]].&lt;ref&gt;

Venona messages also indicated that Soviet spies worked in Washington in the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]], [[Office of Strategic Services]], and even the [[White House]]. Very slowly, using assorted techniques ranging from traffic analysis to [[defector]] information, more of the messages were decrypted.

Claims have been made that information from the physical recovery of code books (a partially burned one was obtained by the Finns) to bugging embassy rooms in which text was entered into encrypting devices (analyzing the keystrokes by listening to them being punched in) contributed to recovering much of the plaintext. These latter claims are less than fully supported in the open literature.

One significant aid (mentioned by the NSA) in the early stages may have been work done in cooperation between the [[Japan]]ese and [[Finland|Finnish]] cryptanalysis organizations; when the Americans broke into Japanese codes during World War II, they gained access to this information. There are also reports that copies of signals purloined from Soviet offices by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) were helpful in the cryptanalysis. The Finnish radio intelligence sold much of its material concerning Soviet codes to [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] in 1944 during [[Operation Stella Polaris]], including the partially burned code book.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book

===Results===
NSA reported that (according to the serial numbers of the Venona cables) thousands of cables were sent, but only a fraction were available to the cryptanalysts. Approximately 2,200 messages were decrypted and translated; about half of the 1943 GRU-Naval Washington to Moscow messages were broken, but none for any other year, although several thousand were sent between 1941 and 1945. The decryption rate of the NKVD cables was as follows:
* 1942 1.8%
* 1943 15.0%
* 1944 49.0%
* 1945 1.5%

Out of some hundreds of thousands of intercepted encrypted texts, it is claimed under 3,000 have been partially or wholly decrypted. All the duplicate one-time pad pages were produced in 1942, and almost all of them had been used by the end of 1945, with a few being used as late as 1948. After this, Soviet message traffic reverted to being completely unreadable.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of Venona decryption became known to the Soviets within a few years of the first breaks.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;!--Weisbord was Army SIS &amp; oversaw the decryption, so they knew almost from day one...--&gt; It is not clear whether the Soviets knew how much of the message traffic or which messages had been successfully decrypted. At least one Soviet penetration agent, British [[Secret Intelligence Service]] representative to the U.S. [[Kim Philby]], was told about the project in 1949, as part of his job as liaison between British and U.S. intelligence. Since all of the duplicate one-time pad pages had been used by this time, the Soviets apparently did not make any changes to their cryptographic procedures after they learned of Venona. However, this information allowed them to alert those of their agents who might be at risk of exposure due to the decryption.

===Significance===
The decrypted messages gave important insights into Soviet behavior in the period during which duplicate one-time pads were used. With the first break into the code, Venona revealed the existence of Soviet espionage&lt;ref&gt;

The messages show that the U.S. and other nations were targeted in major espionage campaigns by the Soviet Union as early as 1942.

The identification of individuals mentioned in Venona transcripts is sometimes problematic, since people with a "covert relationship" with Soviet intelligence are referenced by cryptonyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Further complicating matters is the fact the same person sometimes had different cryptonyms at different times, and the same cryptonym was sometimes reused for different individuals. In some cases, notably Hiss, the matching of a Venona cryptonym to an individual is disputed. In many other cases, a Venona cryptonym has not yet been linked to any person. According to authors [[John Earl Haynes]] and [[Harvey Klehr]], the Venona transcripts identify approximately 349 Americans who they claim had a covert relationship with Soviet intelligence, though fewer than half of these have been matched to real-name identities.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[War Production Board]], the [[Board of Economic Warfare]], the [[Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs]] and the [[Office of War Information]], included at least half a dozen Soviet sources each among their employees.

==Bearing of Venona on particular cases==
Venona has added information—some unequivocal, some ambiguous—to several espionage cases. Some known spies, including [[Theodore Hall]], were neither prosecuted nor publicly implicated, because the Venona evidence against them was withheld.

The identity of Soviet source cryptonymed "19" remains unclear. According to British writer Nigel West, "19" was president of [[Czechoslovak government-in-exile]] [[Edvard Beneš]].&lt;ref&gt;Nigel West, Venona, największa tajemnica zimnej wojny, Warszawa 2006, p.138.&lt;/ref&gt; Military historian Eduard Mark&lt;ref&gt;

However, [[Vasili Mitrokhin|Vasily Mitrokhin]] was a KGB archivist who defected to the United Kingdom in 1992 with copies of large numbers of KGB files. He claimed Harry Hopkins was a secret Russian agent.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sword and the Shield: The Mitrokhin Archive and the Secret History of the KGB'', by Vasily Mitrokhin and Christopher Andrew.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, [[Oleg Gordievsky]], a high-level KGB officer who also defected from the Soviet Union, reported that [[Iskhak Akhmerov]], the KGB officer who controlled the clandestine Soviet agents in the U.S. during the war, had said Hopkins was "the most important of all Soviet wartime agents in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;''KGB: The Inside Story of Its Foreign Operations from Lenin to Gorbachev'', by Oleg Gordievsky and Christopher Andrew.&lt;/ref&gt;

Venona has added significant information to the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, making it clear Julius was guilty of espionage, and also showing that Ethel, while not acting as a principal, still acted as an accessory, had full knowledge of Julius's espionage activity and played the main role in the recruitment of her brother for atomic espionage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Haynes |first= John |title= Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America |publisher= [[Yale University Press]] |location= [[New Haven, Connecticut]] |year= 2000 |isbn= 0300077718 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/haynes-venona.html |accessdate=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Venona and other recent information has shown, while the content of Julius' atomic espionage was not as vital to the Soviets as alleged at the time of his espionage activities, in other fields it was extensive. The information Rosenberg passed to the Soviets concerned the [[proximity fuze]], design and production information on the [[P-80 Shooting Star|Lockheed P-80]] jet fighter, and thousands of classified reports from [[Emerson Radio]].

The Venona evidence indicates unidentified sources code-named "Quantum" and "Pers" who facilitated transfer of nuclear weapons technology to the Soviet Union from positions within the Manhattan Project. According to [[Alexander Vassiliev]]'s notes from KGB archive, "Quantum" was [[Boris Podolsky]] and "Pers" was Russell W. McNutt, an engineer from the uranium processing plant in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Klaus Fuchs===
{{Main|Klaus Fuchs}}

The Venona decryptions were also important in the exposure of the atomic spy Klaus Fuchs. Some of the earliest messages decrypted concerned information from a scientist at the [[Manhattan Project]], who was referred to by the code names of CHARLES and REST.{{sfn|Benson|2001|p=16}} One such message from Moscow to New York, dated April 10, 1945, called information provided by CHARLES "of great value." Noting that the information included "data on the atomic mass of the nuclear explosive" and "details on the explosive method of actuating" the atomic bomb, the message requested further technical details from CHARLES. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsa.gov/news-features/declassified-documents/venona/dated/1945/assets/files/10apr_atomic_bomb_info.pdf NSA, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Investigations based on the VENONA decryptions eventually identified CHARLES and REST as Fuchs in 1949.{{sfn|Benson|2001|p=16}}

===Alger Hiss and Harry Dexter White===
{{Main|Alger Hiss|Harry Dexter White}}

According to the Moynihan [[Commission on Government Secrecy]], the complicity of both [[Alger Hiss]] and [[Harry Dexter White]] is conclusively proven by Venona,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Appendix A; SECRECY; A Brief Account of the American Experience |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |year=1997 |url=http://origin.www.gpo.gov/congress/commissions/secrecy/pdf/12hist1.pdf |pages=A-37 |format=PDF |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629055716/http://origin.www.gpo.gov/congress/commissions/secrecy/pdf/12hist1.pdf |archivedate=June 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://origin.www.gpo.gov/congress/commissions/secrecy/ "Report Of The Commission On Protecting And Reducing Government Secrecy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721041016/http://origin.www.gpo.gov/congress/commissions/secrecy/ |date=2011-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating "The complicity of Alger Hiss of the State Department seems settled.

In his 1998 book, Senator [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan|Moynihan]] expressed certainty about Hiss's identification by Venona as a Soviet spy, writing "Hiss was indeed a Soviet agent and appears to have been regarded by Moscow as its most important."&lt;ref&gt;

===Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess===
[[Kim Philby]] had access to CIA and FBI files, and more damaging, access to Venona Project briefings. When Philby learned of Venona in 1949, he obtained advance warning that his fellow Soviet spy [[Donald Maclean (spy)|Donald Maclean]] was in danger of being exposed. The FBI told Philby about an agent cryptonymed "Homer", whose 1945 message to Moscow had been decoded. As it had been sent from New York and had its origins in the British Embassy in Washington, Philby, who would not have known Maclean's cryptonym, deduced the sender's identity. By early 1951, Philby knew U.S. intelligence would soon also conclude Maclean was the sender, and advised Moscow to extract Maclean. This led to Maclean and Guy Burgess' flight in May 1951 to Moscow, where they lived the remainder of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Yuri Modin, ''My Five Cambridge Friends'', 1994, Ballantine, p. 190–199&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet espionage in Australia===
In addition to British and American operatives, Australians collected Venona intercepts at a remote base in the [[Outback]]. The Soviets remained unaware of this base as late as 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Yuri Modin, ''My Five Cambridge Friends'', 1994, Ballantine, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

The founding of the [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation]] (ASIO) by [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] [[Prime Minister]] [[Ben Chifley]] in 1949 was considered highly controversial within Chifley's own party.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Until then, the [[political left|left]]-leaning Australian Labor Party had been hostile to domestic intelligence agencies on [[civil liberties|civil-liberties]] grounds and a Labor government founding one seemed a surprising about-face.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} But the presentation of Venona material to Chifley, revealing evidence of Soviet agents operating in Australia, brought this about. As well as Australian diplomat suspects abroad, Venona had revealed [[Walter Seddon Clayton]] (cryptonym "KLOD"), a leading official within the [[Communist Party of Australia]] (CPA), as the chief organiser of Soviet intelligence gathering in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew, Christopher. "The Defence of the Realm. The Authorised History of MI5", 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-14-102330-4}}, p. 371&lt;/ref&gt; Investigation revealed that Clayton formed an underground network within the CPA so that the party could continue to operate if it were banned.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} In 1950, [[George Ronald Richards]] was appointed ASIO's deputy-director of operations for Venona, based in Sydney, charged with investigating intelligence uncovered the eleven Australians identified in the cables that were decoded. He continued Venona-related work in London with MI5 from November 1952 and went on to lead Operation Cabin 12, the high-profile [[Petrov Affair|1953–4 defection]] to Australia of Soviet spy [[Vladimir Mikhaylovich Petrov (diplomat)|Vladimir Petrov]].&lt;ref name="ADB"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cain|first1=Frank|title=Richards, George Ronald (Ron) (1905–1985)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/richards-george-ronald-ron-14450|website=Australian Dictionary of Biography|accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public disclosure==
For much of its history, knowledge of Venona was restricted even from the highest levels of government. Senior army officers, in consultation with the FBI and CIA, made the decision to restrict knowledge of Venona within the government (even the CIA was not made an active partner until 1952). Army Chief of Staff [[Omar Bradley]], concerned about the White House's history of leaking sensitive information, decided to deny President Truman direct knowledge of the project. The president received the substance of the material only through FBI, Justice Department, and CIA reports on counterintelligence and intelligence matters. He was not told the material came from decoded Soviet ciphers. To some degree this secrecy was counter-productive; Truman was distrustful of FBI head [[J. Edgar Hoover]] and suspected the reports were exaggerated for political purposes.

Some of the earliest detailed public knowledge that Soviet code messages from World War II had been broken came with the release of Chapman Pincher’s book, ''Too Secret Too Long'', in 1984. Robert Lamphere's book, ''The FBI-KGB War'', was released in 1986. Lamphere had been the FBI liaison to the code-breaking activity, had considerable knowledge of Venona and the [[counter-intelligence]] work that resulted from it. However, the first detailed account of the Venona project, identifying it by name and making clear its long-term implications in post-war espionage, was contained in MI5 assistant director [[Peter Wright]]'s 1987 memoir, ''[[Spycatcher]]''.

Many inside the NSA had argued internally that the time had come to publicly release the details of the Venona project, but it was not until 1995 that the [[bipartisan]] [[Commission on Government Secrecy]], with Senator [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan|Moynihan]] as chairman, released Venona project materials. Moynihan wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[The] secrecy system has systematically denied American historians access to the records of American history. Of late we find ourselves relying on archives of the former Soviet Union in [[Moscow]] to resolve questions of what was going on in Washington at mid-century. [...] the Venona intercepts contained overwhelming proof of the activities of Soviet spy networks in America, complete with names, dates, places, and deeds."&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
One of the considerations in releasing Venona translations was the privacy interests of the individuals mentioned, referenced, or identified in the translations. Some names were not released because to do so would constitute an invasion of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;

However, in at least one case, independent researchers identified one of the subjects whose name had been obscured by the NSA.

The dearth of reliable information available to the public—or even to the President and Congress—may have helped to polarize debates of the 1950s over the extent and danger of Soviet espionage in the United States. [[Anti-communism|Anti-Communists]] suspected many spies remained at large, perhaps including some known to the government. Those who criticized the governmental and non-governmental efforts to root out and expose [[Communism|communists]] felt these efforts were an overreaction (in addition to other reservations about [[McCarthyism]]). Public access—or broader governmental access—to the Venona evidence would certainly have affected this debate, as it is affecting the retrospective debate among historians and others now. As the Moynihan Commission wrote in its final report:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A balanced history of this period is now beginning to appear; the Venona messages will surely supply a great cache of facts to bring the matter to some closure. But at the time, the American Government, much less the American public, was confronted with possibilities and charges, at once baffling and terrifying."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[National Cryptologic Museum]] features an exhibit on the Venona project in its "Cold War/Information Age" gallery.

==Texas textbook controversy==
Controversy arose in 2009 over the Texas State Board of Education's revision of their high school history class curricula to suggest Venona shows Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] to have been justified in his zeal in exposing those whom he believed to be Soviet spies or communist sympathizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialstudies.org/historians_speak_out_against_proposed_texas_textbook_changes |title=Historians speak out against proposed Texas textbook changes &amp;#124; National Council for the Social Studies |publisher=Socialstudies.org |date=2010-03-18 |accessdate=2014-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics assert most people and organizations identified by McCarthy were not mentioned in the Venona content and that his accusations remain largely unsupported by evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tfn.org/rehabilitating-joseph-mccarthy/|title=Rehabilitating Joseph McCarthy? |publisher=TFN Insider |date=2009-10-29 |accessdate=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical views==
The majority of historians are convinced of the historical value of the Venona material. Intelligence historian [[Rupert Allason|Nigel West]] believes that "Venona remain[s] an irrefutable resource, far more reliable than the mercurial recollections of KGB defectors and the dubious conclusions drawn by paranoid analysts mesmerized by Machiavellian plots."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a number of writers and scholars have taken a critical view of the translations. They question the accuracy of the translations and the identifications of covernames that the NSA translations give. Writers Walter and Miriam Schneir, in a lengthy 1999 review of one of the first book-length studies of the messages, object to what they see as the book’s overconfidence in the translations' accuracy, noting that the undecrypted gaps in the texts can make interpretation difficult, and emphasizing the problem of identifying the individuals mentioned under covernames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Wikisource|Explanation and History of Venona Project Information|The Belmont memo}} In the memo, Belmont discusses the possibility of using the Venona translations in court to prosecute Soviet agents, and comes out strongly opposed to their use. His reasons include legal uncertainties about the admissibility of the translations as evidence, and the difficulties that prosecution would face in supporting the validity of the translations. Belmont highlights the uncertainties in the translation process, noting that the cryptographers have indicated that "almost anything included in a translation of one of these deciphered messages may in the future be radically revised." He also notes the complexities of identifying people with covernames, describing how the personal details mentioned for covername "Antenna" fit more than one person, and the investigative process required to finally connect "Antenna" to Julius Rosenberg. The Schneirs conclude that "A reader faced with Venona's incomplete, disjointed messages can easily arrive at a badly skewed impression."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Many of the critiques of the Venona translations have been based on specific cases. The Schneirs' critique of the Venona documents was based on their decades of work on the case of [[Ethel and Julius Rosenberg]]. Another critique of the Venona translations came from the late Rutgers University law professor John Lowenthal, who as a law student worked as a volunteer for Alger Hiss's defense team, and later wrote extensively on the [[Alger Hiss|Hiss case]].&lt;ref&gt;For Lowenthal's work on the Hiss case see the [https://files.nyu.edu/th15/public/lowenthal.html Alger Hiss Story] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603211223/https://files.nyu.edu/th15/public/lowenthal.html |date=2013-06-03}} website, hosted at NYU.&lt;/ref&gt; Lowenthal's critique focused on one message (Venona 1822 KGB Washington-Moscow 30 March 1945),&lt;ref&gt;Available at the NSA's [https://www.nsa.gov/news-features/declassified-documents/venona/dated/1945/assets/files/30mar_kgb_interviews_gru_agent.pdf Venona website].&lt;/ref&gt; in which the comments identified the covername 'Ales' as "probably Alger Hiss." Lowenthal raised a number of objections to this identification, rejecting it as "a conclusion psychologically motivated and politically correct but factually wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[Victor Navasky]], editor and publisher of ''[[The Nation]]'', has also written several editorials highly critical of [[John Earl Haynes]]' and [[Harvey Klehr]]'s interpretation of recent work on the subject of Soviet espionage. Navasky claims the Venona material is being used to "distort … our understanding of the cold war" and that the files are potential "time bombs of misinformation."&lt;ref name=ghosts&gt;{{cite news

| newspaper = The Nation
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on the list of 349 Americans identified by Venona, published in an appendix to ''Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America'', Navasky wrote, "The reader is left with the implication—unfair and unproven—that every name on the list was involved in espionage, and as a result, otherwise careful historians and mainstream journalists now routinely refer to Venona as proof that many hundreds of Americans were part of the red spy network."&lt;ref name=ghosts/&gt; Navasky goes further in his defense of the listed people and has claimed a great deal of the so-called espionage that went on was nothing more than "exchanges of information among people of good will" and that "most of these exchanges were innocent and were within the law."&lt;ref name="decrypts"/&gt;

According to historian [[Ellen Schrecker]], "Because they offer insights into the world of the secret police on both sides of the [[Iron Curtain]], it is tempting to treat the FBI and Venona materials less critically than documents from more accessible sources. But there are too many gaps in the record to use these materials with complete confidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Schrecker believes the documents established the guilt of many prominent figures, but is still critical of the views of scholars such as [[John Earl Haynes]], arguing, "complexity, nuance, and a willingness to see the world in other than black and white seem alien to Haynes' view of history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The term '''victory''' (from [[Latin]] ''victoria'') originally applied to [[warfare]], and denotes success achieved in personal [[Duel|combat]], after [[military operation]]s in general or, by extension, in any [[competition]]. Success in a [[military campaign]] is considered{{by whom|date=October 2017}} a [[strategic victory]], while the success in a [[Engagement (military)|military engagement]] is a [[tactical victory]].

[[File:Hemp for Victory 1942.webm|thumb|right|300px|thumbtime=00:07|''Hemp for Victory'', a short documentary produced by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] during [[World War II]]]]

In terms of [[human emotion]], victory accompanies strong feelings of elation, and in [[human behaviour]] often exhibits movements and [[pose]]s paralleling [[threat display]] preceding the combat, which are associated{{by whom|date=October 2017}} with the excess [[endorphin]] built up preceding and during combat.
Victory dances and victory cries similarly parallel [[war dance]]s and [[battle cry|war cries]] performed before the outbreak of physical violence.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:Wladimir Klitschko Wins.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Boxer [[Michael Jordan]] smiles after his victory of winning a fight.]] --&gt;
Examples of victory behaviour reported in Roman antiquity, where the term ''victoria'' originated, include: the victory songs of the [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]] mercenaries serving under [[Gaius Julius Civilis]] after the victory over [[Quintus Petillius Cerialis]] in the [[Batavian rebellion]] of 69 AD (according to [[Tacitus]]); and also the "abominable song" to [[Wodan]], sung by the [[Lombards]] at their victory celebration in 579.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The sacrificial animal was a goat, around whose head the Langobards danced in a circle while singing their victory hymn.
The [[Roman Republic]] and [[Roman Empire|Empire]] celebrated victories with [[Roman triumph|triumph]] ceremonies and with monuments such as [[victory column]]s (e.g. [[Trajan's Column]]) and arches. A [[trophy]] is a token of victory taken from the defeated party, such as the enemy's weapons (''[[spolia]]''), or body parts (as in the case of [[Headhunting|head hunter]]s).

[[Mythology]] often deifies victory, as in the cases of the Greek [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] or the Roman [[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]]. The victorious agent is a [[hero]], often portrayed as engaging in hand-to-hand combat with a [[monster]] (as [[Saint George]] slaying the dragon, [[Indra]] slaying Ahi, [[Thor]] slaying the Midgard Serpent etc.). [[Sol Invictus]] ("the Invincible Sun") of Roman mythology became an epithet of [[Christ]] in [[Christianity]]. [[Paul of Tarsus]] presents the [[resurrection of Christ]] as a victory over Death and [[Christian views on sin|Sin]] ([[1 Corinthians]] 15:55.

The Latinate English-language word ''victory'' (from the 14th century) replaced the [[Old English]] equivalent term ''sige'' (cognate with Gothic ''sigis'', Old High German ''sigu'' and ''Sieg'' in modern German), a frequent element in [[Germanic names]] (as in [[Sigibert]], [[Sigurd]] etc.), cognate to Celtic ''sego-'' and Sanskrit ''sahas''.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

'''Wazirzada''' (meaning son of [[Vizier|Wazir]]) are descendants of the Grand Wazirs of the [[Sadduzai]] Dynasty in [[Afghanistan]]. Wazirzadas are Sadozai [[Durranis]]; also a sub tribe of [[Popalzai]]s and therefore belong to the Abdali or [[Durrani]] group of [[Pashtun tribes]].
