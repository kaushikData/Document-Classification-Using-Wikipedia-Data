The '''27 Kinder European Challenge''', in which Nathan Farrugia and volunteers ran a full [[marathon]], every day, across 27 different EU states, began on 11 September 2011. The Challenge was concluded successfully in Cyprus on 7 October, 27 days later.&lt;ref name="Mission accomplished"&gt;{{cite web|title=27 Challenge - Mission Accomplished|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20111007/athletics/27-challenge-mission-accomplished.388142|accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was funded by [[Michele Ferrero|Ferrero]], the chocolate maker. The Challenge was timed to coincide with the [[International_Year_of_Volunteers#European_Year_of_Volunteering|European Year of Volunteering]] and to raise funds for charity.&lt;ref name="EYV 2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=First 27 challenge Happens in Malta, Nathan's home country |url=http://europa.eu/volunteering/en/content/kinder-european-challenge-first-27-challenge-fun-run-happens-malta|accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first aim of the challenge was to break the world record of consecutive full marathons (42.2&amp;nbsp;km) in different countries back to back. This was accomplished using a wide range of transport including and primarily a 4-bed camper van that was driven by professional driver Lawrence Cachia from Malta. Nathan was supported by Clifford Sultana who cycled adjacent to provide food and hydration on the run. A number of journalists joined the camper van for days or short stretches to record the event. Each run started at a designated time in various European cities and the official marathon or equivalent recognised distance was measured and covered.

The second aim of the challenge was to raise funds for children's charities in the countries visited. Over €100,000 was raised (including [[Ferrero SpA|Ferrero]] sponsorship) for charities chosen by the Ferrero representative in each country. The largest fundraising effort came from Malta, and was shared between Inspire Foundation and the Daniel Delicata Memorial Association for the construction of a children's outdoor play area at the new national Mater Dei Hospital. Other charities benefitted across the EU including the [[Children's Society]] in England.

Medical Interest - due to the extreme nature of the event a number of medical professionals monitored Nathan's health. Nathan is not a professional athlete and therefore there was worry about the ability of his body to tolerate the 300&amp;nbsp;km or so a week of running, for 4 whole weeks. Surprisingly, Nathan suffered no major ill effects except for a [[muscle tear]] in Marathon 10. Subsequently, his finishing times improved as the days past with the majority of the runs finishing under 4hrs. His fastest was 3hr34min (number 26 in Greece) and his slowest was Rotterdam where he was injured (in 4hr 40min).

Veracity of success - Nathan was tracked by live GPS spotter to confirm distance covered, as well as being followed by eyewitnesses and the media in most countries.

'''ARB''' ({{lang-rus|'''А'''рмейский '''Р'''укопашный '''Б'''ой}}; {{lang|ru-Latn|'''Armeyskiy Rukopashniy Boy'''}}; 'Army Hand-to-Hand Combat') is a [[Russia|Russian]] martial art of training for protection and attack receptions that incorporated many functional elements from an arsenal of individual [[hand-to-hand combat]] and [[martial arts]] styles from around the world, and has been used in real fighting activities. The modern and quickly developing form of the martial art is single combat which have received popularity for full contact duels while offering minimum risk of [[Injury|trauma]] to sportsmen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mosrb.ru/novoe/armeyskiy-rukopashnyiy-boy.html the Site of Army Hand-to-Hand Combat] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501144307/http://mosrb.ru/novoe/armeyskiy-rukopashnyiy-boy.html |date=May 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

ARB's origin as a [[Army|military]]-applied martial art dates back to 1979 when the city of [[Kaunas]] (the settlement Gajzhjunaj, military unit n.o. 42235) held the first [[championship]] for Airborne troops on the sports base of the 7th division of guards of Airborne troops. Since then, the Airborne troops' ARB championships have been held annually. ARB was created by experts and enthusiasts of physical preparation and was played as a sport of the [[Soviet Army]]. It was also successfully introduced into the Soviet army to train soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120906053458/http://www.farbros.ru/ an Information from official site Federation of ARB of Russia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Carrying out of the first championship on ARB would not have been possible without long-term practice and experiments with various kinds of single combat. [[Black belt (martial arts)|Black belt]]-rated sportsmen and prize-winners of competitions in [[boxing]], [[wrestling]], [[judo]] and other fighting sports were carefully selected to participate in a game of ARB. Methodical work of fighters and commanders, has also impulsed to the origin of the martial art which is nowadays widely known under the name "Army Hand-to-Hand Combat". At that point in time (the beginning of 1970's) actual training of regular soldiers for hand-to-hand combat was named "as the Program of preparation of instructors in sports and special receptions of a landing".&lt;ref&gt;[http://desantura.ru/bitrix/components/bitrix/forum.interface/show_file.php?fid=20317 the Certificate from the October, 26th, 1976, given out to sergeant Duduevu S. K that it has studied a complete course of instructors in sports and special receptions of a landing and has received corresponding qualification]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rules ==

A distinctive part of ARB that sets it apart from other full contact single combat martial arts is the possibility of finishing with the opponent on hands and feet from a standing position. The opponent may call "Stop", as some kicks on the head of the opponent may not be protected by a helmet, and can lead to heavy damages that interrupt the sport immediately. Blows of the opponent by a foot in a head is a knock-down to the fighter who has performed such a blow. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VM7oGRTVTMw&amp;feature=player_embedded the Videoclip with cuttings of beautiful fights by rules of Army Hand-to-Hand Combat]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== General rules ===
* Fights are played on a square carpet that is no smaller than 14×14 meters. Fights occur on the square with the border of the fight zone at 8×8 m or 10×10 m. The "external zone" of the carpet serves for the safety of sportsmen and is no less than 3 meters in size. On a knockout of a fighter the carpet fight stops and a command "Stop" is issued. The judge will then issue a "Fighters to the middle" command, which directs sportsmen to go to the center (middle) of the carpet. Thus, if a knockout of one or more fighters has happened on the carpet (including on the safety zone), and the combat's termination has occurred outside of the fighting square, such reception is estimated, and the combat stops by the general rules.
* Fighters break on age (concerning fighters till 18 years and division into age categories depends on Position about competitions) and weight categories beginning from weight to 60 kg and to weight over 90 kg with step of 5 kg. Sometimes, under the preliminary coordination, can be only two weight categories — to 75 kg and over 75 kg (only at adults on local tournaments).
* Fighters are divided into the fighter with a red and dark blue belt, and in certain cases — the fighter in black or white [[Keikogi|gi]]. The fighter whose [[surname]] is specified the first in the summary table — dresses a red belt (black kimono).
* the Fighter needs a second who is responsible for ammunition of the sportsman during a duel ("to tie up a helmet, to fix overlays, a protector, to tie up a belt kimono and another)" as fighter not in condition independently to solve these problems in taken away on the amendment of ammunition time. During a duel the second settles down on a chair behind a place of the fighter. Thus during a duel it is forbidden to second to give to the fighter any commands or councils. For conversations with the second to the fighter the remark can be made, and at repeated infringement — prevention.{{clarification|date=November 2016}}
* At competitions the following equipment is used: a kimono, foot protection of a heel and lifting of foot, an overlay on the [[Tibia|shin]]s, a cup on the [[groin]], a protective waistcoat (protector), gloves, knee protection, forearm and elbow protection, a helmet with a metal lattice ". The protective regimentals (except gloves and a helmet) put on under the kimono.
* Fight consists of one round and lasts: at teenagers, young men and juniors — 2 minutes of pure time, at men (and all final fights) — 3 minutes of pure time. At girls, girls and women duration of duels can decrease at pre-tournament meeting of representatives of commands.
* such technical actions, as Are estimated: blows by hands, blows by feet, throws and painful receptions. Blows and struggle in "orchestra" it is not estimated, but it is privately considered at equality of points (as activity in [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]]-[[wrestling]]).

** behind a clear advantage "(when the opponent ceases to resist to attack or during attack has turned to the opponent a back)";
** in connection with refusal of the opponent to continue a duel "(reception of the trauma which have been not connected with infringement corrected the opponent, weariness and so forth)";

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4947">An unofficial [[Australia national cricket team|Australian cricket team]] toured South Africa in the 1985-86 season to play a series of test and one day matches. The series was highly controversial in Australia and its Australian participants were banned from first-class cricket for two seasons and test cricket for three seasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/cricket/rebels--the-85-south-africa-tour/2005/12/09/1134086816276.html "Rebels - the '85 South Africa tour", ''The Age'', 9 December 2005] accessed 9 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australian squad==
The tour was organised by former Australian test batsman [[Bruce Francis]] at the behest of the South African cricket board, then led by [[Ali Bacher]].

Original players signed for the tour included:
*Batsmen - [[Graham Yallop]], [[Steve Smith (cricketer born 1961)|Steve Smith]], [[Graeme Wood (cricketer)|Graeme Wood]], [[Wayne B. Phillips]], [[Andrew Hilditch]], [[Dirk Wellham]], [[John Dyson (cricketer)|John Dyson]]
*Fastbowlers - [[Terry Alderman]], [[Carl Rackemann]], [[John Maguire (cricketer)|John Maguire]], [[Rod McCurdy]], [[Rodney Hogg]]
*Spinners - [[Tom Hogan]], [[Murray Bennett]] 
*Allrounder - [[Peter Faulkner]]
*Wicketkeepers - [[Steve Rixon]]

Several players seriously considered going such as [[David Hookes]] and [[Jeff Thomson]] but required too much money. Other players were never considered, such as [[Geoff Lawson (cricketer)|Geoff Lawson]], Kim Hughes and [[Allan Border]].

Out of the players who signed, only Peter Faulkner had not represented Australia in test matches. Several were in the Australian team when they signed to go to Australia and a number of these players were selected on the 1985 trip to England, including Wood, Phillips, Hilditch, Wellham, Alderman, Rixon, Bennett, and Rackemann. News of the rebel tour broke before this squad left for England.

===Withdrawals===
Murray Bennett pulled out of the tour after having second thoughts and being selected for Australia over the 1984-85 summer. Phillips, Wood and Wellham pulled out after a financial inducement from [[Kerry Packer]]; Packer also tried to get Steve Smith to change his mind but Smith refused. Hilditch also pulled out after being selected for the Australian team over the 84-85 summer.

Francis signed up several new players including [[Trevor Hohns]], [[Greg Shipperd]], [[Mick Taylor (cricketer)|Mick Taylor]] and [[Mike Haysman]]. The tour received its biggest boost in early 1985 when Kim Hughes, who had been dropped from the Australian team, met with Bacher and Francis, agreed to tour and captain the side.

Alderman, Rixon, Rackemann, Maguire and McCurdy lost a chance to tour England in 1985 by sticking to their agreement to tour South Africa.

==The Tour==
South Africa had a very strong line up, including [[Clive Rice]] (captain), [[Graeme Pollock]] and [[Garth le Roux]].

South Africa won the unofficial test series 1-0.

===South Africa XI v Australian XI at Durban, 1st unofficial Test, Dec 26-29, 1985===
The first test ended in a draw. Highlights included centuries from Mick Taylor and [[Graeme Pollock]] as well as an eight wicket haul from [[Carl Rackemann]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/389270.html 1st test scorecard] at [[Cricinfo]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa XI v Australian XI at Cape Town, 2nd unofficial Test, Jan 1-4, 1986===
The second test also ended in a draw, with Rackemann taking another eight wicket haul and Kim Hughes scoring 97 not out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/389272.html 2nd test scorecard] at [[Cricinfo]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa XI v Australian XI at Johannesburg, 3rd unofficial Test, Jan 16-21, 1986===
The third test was closely fought. Australia had to score 250 runs in their second innings to win, thanks to a century from Steve Smith and a 12-wicket haul from Carl Rackemann. However they collapsed to be all out for 61 and South Africa won by 188 runs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/389318.html 3rd test scorecard] at [[Cricinfo]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Club Silvio Pettirossi''', is a [[Paraguay]]an [[football (soccer)|football]] club based in the [[barrio]] of [[Republicano]], in [[Asunción]]. The club was founded March 11, 1926 and plays in the [[Paraguayan Cuarta División|fourth division]] of the Paraguayan league. Their home games are played at the Bernabé Pedrozo stadium. The club's name was chosen in honor of [[Silvio Pettirossi]], a famous Paraguayan airplane pilot and [[aviation]] pioneer.

In 2007 they won the [[Liga Paraguaya: Segunda División|Intermedia]] (Paraguayan second division tournament) and will thus be in the top flight of Paraguayan football in 2008. They have named former Paraguayan star [[Miguel Angel Benitez]] as head coach for the 2008 season.

[[Image:Apex Dart Golf.jpg|thumb|Apex dart golf board.]]

'''Dart golf''' games are games in which [[darts]] are thrown at traditional dart boards or dart boards that resemble [[golf courses]] with colored areas that represent a golf course. Dart golf games use [[golf]]-like rules and scoring. Rules and board configurations of the game vary from league to league, but are generally played single, head-to-head or with teams.

==History==
Dart golf games have been known since as early as 1932 based on Harrison Johnston UK Patent submission.&lt;ref&gt;"Harrison Requa Johnston Dart Golf.", UK Patent 364932, January 1, 1932.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, NODOR produced an 18-hole golf dartboard and another dartboard called PAR DARTS.&lt;ref name=Patrick&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.calameo.com/read/00030546011108229a8b8 |title=Dr. Darts Newsletter Issue Thirteen |date=April 1, 2011 |publisher=Calameo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:PAR DARTS.jpg|thumb|PAR DARTS dartboard.]] Further, there was a patent filed in 1997 by Howard Hanson for a dartboard where the numbers are in a different order than the standard dartboard to make playing golf on the board more like playing a golf course.&lt;ref&gt;"Method of Playing a Simulated Golf Game.", US Patent 5,642,886, July 9, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Dolf was developed on September 1, 1999 in [[Winnipeg|Winnipeg, Manitoba]], Canada by Keith Meyer and Michael Meyer where a golf like game is played on a standard dart board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Dolf |url=http://www.dolfdarts.com/history-of-dolf |publisher=Dolfdarts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolf is regulated by the World Dolf Federation (WDFF) with representation in Canada and [[Pakistan]].

==Darts and Dartboards==
The dartboards used to play dart golf games consist of 3 major categories. First are dartboards that are representations of golf courses. Second are dartboards that are very similar to traditional dartboards but are arranged differently in order to make playing golf on the board more representative of playing golf. The final category is playing dart golf games on traditional dartboards.

The rules of the dart golf games vary. Typically for the dartboards that are representation of golf courses, the player's score is determined by where in the area defining the hole the dart lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.familygamesamerica.com/mainsite/consumers/productview.php?pro_id=12 |title=Magnetic Darts - Golf |publisher=Familygamesamerica.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714084251/http://www.familygamesamerica.com/mainsite/consumers/productview.php?pro_id=12 |archivedate=2011-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Electronic dart golf game." Patent 6974133, December 13, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, if the player lands closer to the hole they will have a better score. For dart golf games that are played on either traditional dartboards or dartboards that are derivatives of traditional dartboards, the scoring is derived from landing the darts in the number related to the hole the player is on, the double, the treble, the 25 and the bull's eye such as Halex's Golf, A1Darts' Golf,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dart Rules - Golf |url= http://www.a1darts.com/dart_rules/golf.html|publisher=A1darts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolf&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WDFF Playing &amp; Tournament Rules |url=http://www.dolfdarts.com/the-rules-of-dolf |publisher=Dolfdarts.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Apex Golf[[File:A Dolf Combination of Darts and Golf Game Scoring.ogv|thumb|Scoring example in the dart golf game of Dolf]].

The '''Moser Medical Graz 99ers''' are an [[Austria]]n ice hockey team from [[Graz]], [[Styria]]. The club was founded in 1999 after previous club, EHC Graz, folded prior to the [[1998-99 Austrian Hockey League season|1998–99]] season due to financial difficulties. The Graz 99ers started in the 1999–00 season in the [[Austrian National League]], Austria's second division, where they were crowned instant champions. Since the [[2000-01 Austrian Hockey League season|2000–01]] season they have been playing in the [[Erste Bank Eishockey Liga]] .

==History==
Hockey was played at Premier League level in Graz mainly from two predecessor clubs. The Hockey department of the [[ATSE Graz]] (Workers' Gymnastics and Sports Association [[Eggenberg (Graz)|Eggenberg]]) was founded in 1947 and won to date the only Graz Hockey club title at the top Austrian League level in the 1974-75 and 1977-78 season. The club was merged early nineties with the UEC Graz, shortly after the EC Graz emerged. In 2008, the Hockey section of was ATSE Graz reactivated on league level.

The [[EC Graz]] (also called "the elephant") experienced under President Hannes Kartnig its heyday, finishing three times the runner-up title in the seasons 1991-92, 1992-93 and 1993-94 despite running at a high financial cost.  After the departure of Hannes Kartnig, the football club SK Sturm Graz changed, they tried to rescue the EC Graz. When this plan failed, the EHC Graz was established in 1998, just to become bankrupt the same year.

;Establishment and promotion to the Bundesliga
In 1999 Jochen Pildner-Steinburg founded the Graz 99ers as the successor club of the EC Graz to offer Hockey League back in the Styrian capital. The team premiered in the second division, the [[Austrian National League]], finishing after 28 rounds played, in first place in the table. In the semifinals, the team continued after opening game defeat to persevere to a 3: 1 series win against the [[EHC Lustenau]] to met [[EK Zell am See]] in the final. The series was decided in four games with Graz taking advantage of the opportunity for promotion to the Austrian Hockey League.

'''Kbach kun dambong veng''' ({{lang-km|ក្បាច់គុណដំបងវែង}}) is the term for a [[Cambodia]]n martial art based on the long staff.  The term "dambong" means "staff" in the [[Khmer language]] and the term "veng" means "long".  Translated literally it means "the art/martial skill of the long staff." The term is also used in the phrase "land of the lost staff", [[Battambang]].  In the town of Battambang there is a big statue of 'Grandfather Dambong' holding the lost staff. It is based on different mae(s) which can be imagined as a Khmer version of [[kata]](s).[[File:Knee and staff.png|thumb|Knee and staff]][[File:Naktadambangkragnoung.jpg|thumb|right|200px| A statue of Grandfather Dambong carrying a long staff.]]

The '''Kenwyn Ground''' was a temporary rugby ground,&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|title=Club plays at new temporary site|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/4257556.stm|accessdate=9 June 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=18 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Cornwall]], [[United Kingdom|UK]], built in an attempt to increase the fan base of the newly named [[Cornish Pirates]]. The move was controversial and caused resentment from some members and followers of Penzance and Newlyn RFC, as a "proud local name" was lost to the rugby world. The Pirates stayed for just one season (2005–06), playing twelve matches, moving to the [[Camborne Recreation Ground]] for the 2006–07 season. The move to [[Kenwyn]] was considered to be justified as the average attendance increased by 40% on the previous season.&lt;ref name="Tomlin"&gt;Tomlin, S. and Straughan, D. (2009). Pirates! Pirates! The Rise and Rise of a Cornish Rugby Club. Penzance: Cornish Pirates.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Kenwyn Ground was previously used by Truro Rugby Club in the early part of the 20th century and was the playing field for [[Truro Cathedral]] School for many years.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pirates Ahoy! Western Morning News Special Souvenir Supplement, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kim Il-sung Stadium''' is the name of a large [[multi-purpose stadium]] located in [[Pyongyang]], the capital city of the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]].

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2017}}
Kim Il-sung Stadium was originally built as the '''Girimri Stadium''' (기림리공설운동장) in 1926. This stadium held the annual '''[[Kyungsung FC–Pyongyang FC rivalry|Kyung-Pyong Football Match]]''' between [[Kyungsung FC]] and [[Pyongyang FC]] during the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s.

On 14 October 1945,&lt;ref name="Suh1981"/&gt; it was the site of [[Kim Il-sung]]'s victory speech after the liberation of Pyongyang,&lt;ref name="Mintjens2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mintjens|first=Ronny|title=A Journey through North Korea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4RiFAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA55|year=2013|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=978-1-4907-0176-9|page=55}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Suh1981"/&gt; called "[[Every Effort for the Building of a New Democratic Korea]]".&lt;ref name="Suh1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dae-Sook Suh|title=Korean communism, 1945–1980: a reference guide to the political system|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=In-OAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=7 July 2015|year=1981|publisher=University Press of Hawaii|isbn=978-0-8248-0740-5|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[division of Korea]], it was used as a venue for speeches by politicians, and it was the site of [[Kim Il-sung]]'s first speech after returning from exile on 14 October 1945. Most of the stadium was destroyed during the 1950-1953 Korean War, mostly by U.S. aerial bombing of the capital city during those years. Rebuilt in 1969, it was then called '''Moranbong Stadium''', but in April 1982 it was renovated and renamed in honour of Kim Il-sung. It is used mainly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches, and hosted the [[mass games]] until the 1990s (now held in [[Rungnado May Day Stadium]]).

==Present day==
Today, the Kim Il-sung stadium is used as the home ground for the [[North Korea national football team]], the [[North Korea women's national football team]] and the [[Pyongyang City Sports Club]] and [[Kigwancha Sports Club]].

In 2008, on two occasions, a [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification - AFC Fourth Round#Korea DPR v Korea Republic|2010 World Cup qualifying match between North and South Korea]], due to be played in [[Pyongyang]], had to be moved to [[Shanghai]] when authorities in the North refused to allow the [[Aegukga|South Korean national anthem]] to be played in Kim Il-sung Stadium, or the [[flag of South Korea]] to be flown, as North and South Korea have never granted each other formal diplomatic recognition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/2779037/Clash-of-the-Koreas-ends-all-square-Football.html "Clash of North and South Koreas ends all square"], ''The Telegraph'', 10 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The start and finish of the annual [[Pyongyang Marathon]] occurs at Kim Il-sung Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Willoughby: [https://books.google.com/books?id=-bHkI4cEc1QC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;dq=%22Pyongyang+Marathon%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rBtnQHIWDb&amp;sig=PiGcSK-ENJBceyAxoRQCRO2Dhfk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=f3PpSYzANIiQjAfwt6mfCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7 North Korea] 2nd ed.

'''New Meadow''', also known as '''Montgomery Waters Meadow''' for sponsorship purposes, is the home ground of [[England|English]] [[Association football|football club]] [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]].

The stadium is situated on the southern outskirts of [[Shrewsbury]], [[Shropshire]], between the districts of [[Meole Brace]] and Sutton Farm, and close to the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]]. It was completed in the summer of 2007, in time for the [[2007-08 in English football|2007–08 English football season]], and was built to replace the [[Gay Meadow]] stadium, home of Shrewsbury Town since 1910. It is also a [[UEFA stadium categories|UEFA Category 4 stadium]].

==Stadium==

===Naming===
The stadium had no official name during the club's first season at their new home, before being christened the "Prostar Stadium" in a four-year deal with the sports kit manufacturer of the same name in July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Shrewsbury announce stadium name | work=BBC Sport | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/shrewsbury/7518490.stm | accessdate=10 July 2016 | date=22 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club had initially distanced themselves from the unofficial name of "New Meadow", preferring to sever links with the old Gay Meadow ground,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/shrewsbury/7193685.stm|title=Shrews stadium close to new name|publisher=BBC Sport|date=17 January 2008|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; however when the naming deal with Prostar ended two years earlier than scheduled, new sponsors Greenhous gave supporters the opportunity to vote for a new stadium name, with "Meadow" added to the shortlist after feedback from fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/shrewsbury/8660638.stm|title=Shrewsbury Town fans could resurrect Meadow memories|publisher=BBC Sport|date=5 May 2010|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From May 2010, the stadium was officially known as "Greenhous Meadow",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/shrewsbury/8700413.stm|title=Shrews bring back "Meadow" name for current ground|publisher=BBC Sport|date=24 May 2010|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; until Greenhous announced they would be ending their sponsorship of the club and stadium in November 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shropshirestar.com/sport/shrewsbury-town-fc/2016/11/07/greenhous-ends-sponsorship-of-shrewsbury-town/|title=Greenhous ends sponsorship of Shrewsbury Town|publisher=Shropshire Star|date=10 November 2016|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with local firm Montgomery Waters taking on the naming rights from July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.shropshirestar.com/sport/football/shrewsbury-town-fc/2017/07/12/shrewsbury-town-confirm-montgomery-waters-as-new-stadium-sponsor/|title=Montgomery Waters Meadow: Shrewsbury Town confirm new stadium sponsor|publisher=Shropshire Star|date=12 July 2017|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals to move to a new stadium site at Oteley Road were first drawn up in the late 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/shropshire/3132735.stm|title=Spring date for town's new stadium|publisher=BBC News|date=7 August 2003|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with planning permission granted in September 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pa.shropshire.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&amp;keyVal=ZZZZUVOBSB382|title=SA/02/0278/F: Planning – Application Summary|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A covenant protecting the Gay Meadow site for sports use was transferred to Oteley Road in 2004, clearing the way for the sale of the old ground to property developers to finance the building of New Meadow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/shropshire/4015825.stm|title=New soccer stadium a step closer|publisher=BBC News|date=16 November 2004|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:STFC - New Meadow (Aerial).jpg|thumb|New Meadow]]
[[File:Greenhous Meadow Cold.jpg|thumb|North Stand.]]

The stadium was designed by WDW Partnership architects, with the project awarded to Hall Construction, at a cost of £11.2 million, with a brief to build a 10,000 capacity all-seater stadium, with banqueting facilities for up to 300 people. The project consisted of erecting four stands, including hospitality boxes, function rooms, kitchen, bars, offices and a club shop as well as adjoining community and training pitches, a 670 space car park and access roads. Work was completed for the new stadium to open in time for the beginning of the [[2007–08 Football League Two]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hallconstruction.uk.com/PDF%20downloads/Sports%20Stadia/Shrewsbury%20Town%20FC%20-%20~0018.pdf|title=Shrewsbury Town FC|publisher=Hall Construction|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stands===
[[File:GreenhousMeadowWestStandFebruary2015.jpg|thumb|West Stand]]

The East and West stands run the length of the pitch; the South and North stands face onto the ends of the pitch. All stands are fully seated and covered; each stand also has its own catering ([[alcohol|licensed]]) and toilets. At present the stands are detached from one another.

*"Roland Wycherley Stand" - East stand, named after the present chairman; includes the club's hospitality facilities, the changing rooms, club offices and club shop. Blocks 1−7. Capacity 2,741.&lt;ref name="Greenhous Meadow"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shrewsburytown.com/club/greenhousmeadow/|title=Greenhous Meadow|publisher=Shrewsweb|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Salop Leisure Stand" - South stand, named after a local business sponsor. Houses the new safe-standing section of the ground. Blocks 8−12. Capacity 1,955.&lt;ref name="Greenhous Meadow" /&gt;
*"DM Recruitment Stand" - North stand - the away supporters' stand; also has stadium control room and scoreboard, resulting in fewer seats than the South stand. Blocks 20−24. Capacity 1,796.&lt;ref name="Greenhous Meadow" /&gt;
*"Bandera Stand" - West stand, named after a local company. Blocks 13−19. Capacity 3,317.&lt;ref name="Greenhous Meadow" /&gt;

===Expansion and developments===

After the first nine seasons hosted at New Meadow, the average attendance for first-team league matches stood at 5,612, approximately 57% of capacity (see table below), with no confirmed prospect of stadium expansion in the foreseeable future as of July 2016.

[[File:New_Meadow,_Shrewsbury,_25_October_2014.jpg|thumbnail|right|New Meadow with temporary seating, October 2014]]

In September 2014, Shrewsbury drew [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] at home in the fourth round of the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]]. With the club anticipating a high demand for tickets, [[C.E.O.]] Matt Williams proposed that temporary seating could be erected in the corners between the existing stands. In order to maintain segregation between home and away supporters, and to allow access for emergency vehicles, the proposals were later reduced to two temporary stands at the South (home) end of the ground,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.shropshirestar.com/sport/shrewsbury-town-fc/2014/10/04/town-could-go-up-by-500-for-chelsea-clash/|title=Town could go up by 500 for Chelsea clash|publisher=Shropshire Star|date=4 October 2014|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With match tickets selling out on their first day of general sale, the club confirmed the plans on 13 October 2014, which temporarily raised the capacity of New Meadow to 10,361.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.shrewsburytown.com/news/article/13oct14-extra-seating-for-chelsea-game-2014585.aspx|title=Extra Seating for Chelsea Game|publisher=Shrewsweb|date=13 October 2014|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent developments on the stadium site include 5G 5-a-side and 7-a-side pitches currently operated by [[Powerleague]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.powerleague.co.uk/5-a-side/midlands/shrewsbury|title=Welcome to Lucozade Powerleague Shrewsbury|publisher=Powerleague|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a community centre run by "Shrewsbury Town in the Community" which opened on land behind the South stand in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shrewsburytown.com/news/article/shrewsbury-town-in-the-community-greenhous-meadow-2889791.aspx|title=Work Begins On Community Hub|publisher=Shrewsweb|date=8 January 2016|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A memorial garden area to remember fans, staff and players who have died was also relocated near the entrance to the stadium in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shrewsburytown.com/news/article/memorial-garden-3125107.aspx|title=Memorial Garden|publisher=Shrewsweb|date=25 May 2016|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shropshire Football Association are also based at New Meadow, with their county office located in a building at the rear of the South stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shropshirefa.com/resource-section/find-us|title=Find us Shropshire FA|publisher=Shropshire FA|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The food retailer [[Lidl]] submitted plans to build a supermarket at the stadium site in May 2016, however this was partly reliant on the local council agreeing to move land earmarked for community use at the North end of the ground to another part of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shrewsburytown.com/news/article/town-hoping-to-improve-community-facilities-3098677.aspx|title=Town hoping to improve community facilities|publisher=Shrewsweb|date=5 May 2016|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Planning permission for the Lidl development and a new community pitch was approved in April 2017, with building work due to begin the following month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shrewsburytown.com/news/article/2016-17/-community-development-passed-3673390.aspx|title=Community development passed|publisher=Shrewsweb|date=13 April 2017|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Safe Standing====
In June 2017, Shrewsbury Town applied to the [[Sports Grounds Safety Authority]] to convert an existing section of the all-seater New Meadow stadium to a [[safe standing]] area, making them the first club in the [[English Football League]] to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40413087|title=Safe standing: League One side Shrewsbury Town first in England to apply for rail seats|publisher=BBC Sport|date=27 June 2017|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Permission was granted the following month, with £75,000 to be raised via a [[crowdfunding]] initiative to install rail seating to the back of the South Stand, with a planned capacity of 550.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.shrewsburytown.com/news/2017/july/safe-standing-a-step-closer/|title=Safe Standing a step closer|publisher=Shrewsweb|date=26 July 2017|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tifosy.com/en/campaigns/support-the-campaign-to-install-england-s-first-safe-standing-area|title=Tifosy: Support the campaign to install England's first safe standing area|publisher=Tifosy|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transport systems===
With the ground not being centrally located and with only limited car parking on-site, the club operates a [http://www.shrewsburytown.com/tickets/travelplan/ matchday travel plan], to encourage spectators to walk, cycle or use organised transport where possible. [[Shrewsbury railway station]] is approximately two miles from the stadium.

==Notable fixtures==
The first match at the new ground was an All Stars' friendly game as part of Shrewsbury Town's new sponsorship deal with Italian sportswear manufacturer A-Line, who made Shrewsbury's kit for the [[2007-08 in English football|2007-08]] season. Heading the list of All-Stars players was [[Gianfranco Zola]], with the team being managed by [[Ron Atkinson]]. The match took place on Saturday 14 July 2007, and Shrewsbury Town ran out 4−0 winners, Shrewsbury striker [[David Hibbert|Dave Hibbert]] taking the honour of being the first ever goalscorer at the new ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/shrewsbury/6900768.stm|title=Shrewsbury 4-0 A-Line All-Stars|publisher=BBC Sport|date=16 July 2007|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first competitive match at New Meadow was a [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] match against [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]], of the [[Football League Championship|Championship]], then two divisions above Shrewsbury. It took place on Tuesday 14 August 2007, Shrewsbury winning 1−0 thanks to a header from [[Darran Kempson]] in extra time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/6941898.stm|title=Shrewsbury 1-0 Colchester (aet)|publisher=BBC Sport|date=7 August 2007|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first league fixture, in [[Football League Two|League Two]], was against [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] on Saturday 18 August, with Shrewsbury winning 1−0 from a first half penalty scored by [[David Hibbert|Dave Hibbert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/6941946.stm|title=Shrewsbury Town 1-0 Bradford City|publisher=BBC Sport|date=18 August 2007|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007 the [[England women's national football team]] played [[Spain women's national football team|Spain]] at New Meadow. England won 1–0 with a [[Karen Carney]] goal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/nov/26/womensfootball.sport Carney angles in for narrow win]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 October 2010 it was announced that New Meadow has been selected as part of England's bid to host the [[UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/shrewsbury/9101421.stm.htm Shrewsbury stadium selected in England's bid for Euro Under-21 finals]&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 January 2011, however, it was ruled Israel will host the Under 21s Finals.

On 27 March 2012, the generator room in the East Stand caught fire which caused the League Two match against [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] to be abandoned in the second half with the score 1–0 to Shrewsbury Town.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17441576 Shrewsbury A-A Port Vale: Stadium Fire in East Stand]&lt;/ref&gt; Shrewsbury then won the replayed match 1–0.

Shrewsbury Town went 34 matches unbeaten in all competitions at New Meadow over an 18-month period between 2011 and 2012, under manager [[Graham Turner]]. The run was ended by a 1−0 defeat to [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19528074|title=Shrewsbury 0-1 Scunthorpe|publisher=BBC Sport|date=15 September 2012|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium's record attendance was recorded in 1997 when 131,781 spectators watched the [[1997 Federation Cup Semifinal: East Bengal F.C. v Mohun Bagan A.C.|Federation Cup Semifinal]] between East Bengal and Mohun Bagan.&lt;ref name="rediff"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhaskaran|first1=K.|title=Beneath the box office lurks hidden danger|url=http://m.rediff.com/sports/jul/19b.htm|publisher=rediff.com|accessdate=5 March 2017|date=19 July 1997|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305025833/http://m.rediff.com/sports/jul/19b.htm|archivedate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium recently switched back to natural grass from artificial turf as part of the preparations for hosting the U-17 World Cup in 2017. The new turf was unveiled in a [[Kolkata Derby]] match between East Bengal and Mohun Bagan during the [[2015–16 Calcutta Premier Division]] match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-india/news/136/india/2014/09/08/5090851/das-salt-lake-stadium-to-get-natural-turf-next-year|title=Salt lake stadium to get natural turf|website=goal.com|accessdate=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==About==
The stadium was established in 1984 because the club grounds in the [[Maidan (Kolkata)|Maidan]] area, each with capacity around 20,000, were proving too small for the huge crowd that occupied the grounds on matchdays. And while the [[Eden Gardens]] was there to handle some of the bigger games, like the [[Kolkata Derby]], the pressure of handling both cricket and football was proving to be a bit too much for the stadium.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefangarage.com/articles/1283-stadium-stories-for-atk-go-for-the-e-or-g-stands-in-the-ybk|title=Stadium stories for the VYBK|website=thefangarage.com|accessdate=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium is situated approximately 10 kilometres to the east of the [[Kolkata]] downtown. The roof is made of metal tubes and [[aluminum]] sheets and [[concrete]]. The stadium was inaugurated in January 1984. There are two electronic scoreboards and control rooms. There is illumination at night . There are special arrangements for TV broadcasting.&lt;ref name=about1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbsports.in/home/stadia/yuvo_bharati|title=Yuva Bharati Krirangan: West Bengal Sports Department|website=wbsports.in|accessdate=8 May 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314125221/http://wbsports.in/home/stadia/yuvo_bharati|archivedate=14 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gigantic stadium features three tiers of concrete galleries. The stadium has 9 entry gates and 30 ramps for the spectators to reach the viewing blocks. The nine gates include the VIP gate. The gates 1 and 2 are on kadapara road, gate no.3, 3A, 4, 4A and 4B are on the side of Broadway; gate no 5 and the VIP gate are on the side of EM By pass. The ramps are inside the stadium and link the inner ring road to the different levels of the stadium complex.&lt;ref name="bidhannagarcitypolice.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://bidhannagarcitypolice.com/fifa/about-stadium.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015150046/http://bidhannagarcitypolice.com/fifa/about-stadium.html |archive-date=15 October 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium covers an area of {{convert|76.40|acre|m2}}. The stadium has a unique{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} synthetic track for athletic meets. It has a main football arena measuring {{convert|105x70|m|ft}}. It also houses electronics scoreboards, elevators, VIP enclosures, peripheral floodlighting arrangement from the roof-top, air-conditioned VIP rest room, conference hall and much more. The stadium has its own water arrangements and standby diesel generation sets.&lt;ref name=about1 /&gt;

==Renovation==
The {{INRConvert|1|b}} renovation project started in February 2015. The artificial turf at the stadium has been replaced by an all-natural grass pitch. The new grass is from Reivera Bermuda seeds procured from the USA and below it there are two layers of sand and gravel. The next layer is fitted with perforated pipes so that water-logging won’t be an issue.

German company Porplastic provided the elastic coating for the running track around the pitch which was replaced for the first time since the stadium was built in 1984. The old track has been scooped out and the new surface was laid.

The lobby of the VIP entrance that leads to the player's arena, was air-conditioned. The broadcast rooms and stadium offices were renovated.

Bucket seats replaced the concrete benches in the galleries, which brought down the stadium's capacity from 120,000 to 85,000.

The VIP and press boxes, both in the middle tier, were pulled down and a new press box with a capacity of 240 seats is now on the third tier. The VIP box remained on the second tier, with an added 240 seats. The press conference room that used to be cramped during derbies and matches featuring international teams has been shifted to a 19 x 8.5-metre space under a gallery. A spacious broadcast room of similar dimensions has been 
built as well. 

Two full-sized practice grounds with perforations on the surface for underground drainage and eight floodlight towers have come up at the Hyatt end of the stadium, as recommended by FIFA. The same imported Reveria Bermuda grass used on the main turf will cover the practice grounds. The drainage network has been designed to ensure that the surface never becomes slushy. The referees rooms have been built alongside the practice grounds. 

The number of gates to the stadium has been increased from seven to nine. Some of the existing gates has been widened too, as are the approaches that connect the entrances and exits to the ring road. Each link road is 21 meters wide. The surroundings has been beautified by the forest department.

To the left of the lobby, rooms have been constructed for referees and ball boys.&lt;ref name="telegraphindia.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newindianexpress.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/football/refurbished-at-over-rs-100-crore-salt-lake-stadium-handed-over-to-fifa-on-sunday/story-QIFWmtRlc1s1vS254sYm6M.html|title=Refurbished at over Rs 100 crore, Salt Lake stadium handed over to Fifa on Sunday|date=10 September 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bidhannagarcitypolice.com"/&gt;

==Location==
The stadium is located in the satellite township of [[Bidhannagar, Kolkata|Salt Lake]] and it also lies on the [[E.M. Bypass|Eastern Metropolitan Bypass]] which makes it easily accessible by road.

'''Stade Grimonprez-Jooris''' was a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Lille]], [[France]] built in 1974. It was used mainly for [[Association football|football]] matches as it was home to the [[Lille OSC]] football club from 1975 until 2004, when the stadium was closed.

The club originally planned to have Grimonprez-Jooris redeveloped into a 33,000-seat stadium, but this proposal was rejected, and the [[Grand Stade Lille Métropole]] was constructed instead.

The stadium was officially opened on 28 October 1975,&lt;ref name="stadiumguide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stadiumguide.com/grimonprez.htm|title=Stade Grimonprez-Jooris|work=The Stadium Guide|accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Lille played a friendly against Dutch side [[Feyenoord]] (which ended in a 1–1 draw) and the last match at the stadium was played on 15 May 2004, Lille's last home game in the [[2003–04 Ligue 1|2003–04 Ligue 1 season]] against [[SC Bastia]].&lt;ref name="uefa05"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www1.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=346304.html|title=Long journey home for Lille|last=Châtelet|first=Christian|date=28 September 2005|work=[[UEFA]]|accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lille won the game 2–0 with [[Matt Moussilou]] scoring the last goal in the history of Grimonprez-Jooris.&lt;ref name="bastiareport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ligue1.com/ligue1/feuilleMatch.asp?saison=2003/2004&amp;code_evt=D1&amp;num_ordre=4&amp;code_jr_tr=J37&amp;no_groupe=0|title=Ligue 1  : LOSC Lille Métropole / SC Bastia - Week 37 - Match Stats|work=[[Ligue 1]]|accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The club's original stadium [[Stade Henri-Jooris]] had been demolished in 1975 in order to allow the enlargement of the [[Canal de la Deûle]], a navigable waterway which passes through the city of Lille, and the design for a new stadium was made by Lille architect Pierre-François Delannoyla.  Although the club wanted the new stadium to retain the old name ''Stade Henri Jooris'' (named after Henri Jooris, former Lille OSC manager), the mayor proposed it to be called ''Stade Félix Grimonprez'' after [[Félix Grimonprez]], a former [[field hockey]] player who competed in the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] and the [[1936 Summer Olympics]]. This resulted in a compromise solution in which the stadium was hence named ''Stade Grimonprez-Jooris''.

The stadium's original capacity was 25,000 at the time it was opened, but this was reduced to around 17,000 by 2000 due to the evolution of safety standards. In 2000 the stadium was renovated and the capacity was increased to 21,128 (14,534 seated). However, the stadium still failed to meet FIFA licensing regulations and Lille had to play their [[2001–02 UEFA Champions League]] matches at the [[Stade Félix-Bollaert]].&lt;ref name="uefa02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=22261,print.htmx|title=Halilhodzic to leave LOSC|date=24 April 2002|work=[[UEFA]]|accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Redevelopment plans and demolition==
Plans to build a new stadium compliant with UEFA's standards were made in 2002, when the club was privatised. City authorities tried to persuade the club's new owners to redevelop the existing stadium, but they refused and instead opted for a plan to build a new 60,000-seat stadium outside the city, financed as a [[public-private partnership]]. However, their search for investors willing to finance the ambitious project was met with little success.

In June 2003 the club's board agreed to a new proposal put forward by the city mayor to build a new 33,000-seat stadium on the site of the Grimonprez-Jooris. Preliminary works which included dismantling of training grounds were undertaken, and the delivery was scheduled for 31 December 2004 but was postponed. In the meantime the funding of the project moved from the City Council to the [[Urban Community of Lille Métropole]] and became 100 percent public. Construction work was then planned to begin in early 2005, but the project faced opposition from [[preservationist]]s who successfully prevented the project to obtain necessary permits as the site of the stadium was close to the 17th-century [[Citadel of Lille]]. The delays forced Lille OSC to play their league matches at [[Stadium Nord Lille Métropole]] and their [[2005–06 UEFA Champions League]] games at [[Stade de France]] in the [[Paris]] suburb of [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]].&lt;ref name="uefa05"/&gt;

After two years of court battles, local courts had declared issued building permits void in July and December 2005, which meant that Grimonprez-Jooris II would never come into existence. Once the dismantling of training grounds was completed, the club moved their facilities to [[Camphin-en-Pévèle]]. The failed project cost the city of Lille 6 million euros, including 3 million paid to the architecture bureau, 2 million in damages to businesses which invested in the project and 1 million for court fees. The future of the stadium was unclear until January 2007 when the Urban Community of Lille Métropole decided to fund the demolition of the stadium. The demolition works finally began in March 2010.

The '''Stade de Gerland''' (known for sponsorship reasons as '''Matmut Stadium de Gerland''' and otherwise known as '''Municipal de Gerland''' or '''Stade Gerland''' {{IPA-fr|stad ʒɛʁlɑ̃|}}) is a stadium in the city of [[Lyon]], [[France]]  which serves as home to [[Top 14]] rugby club [[Lyon OU]]. It has a seating capacity of 25,000.

Situated in the [[Gerland, Lyon|Gerland]] quarter, it was used by French professional [[Association football|football]] club [[Olympique Lyonnais]], who moved to the newly constructed [[Parc Olympique Lyonnais]] in 2016. Local rugby union club [[Lyon OU]] moved in beginning of 2017, replacing their much smaller stadium [[Matmut Stadium]]. The stadium's capacity was also reduced from 43,000 to a more reasonable 25,000.

The Stade de Gerland is listed as a [[UEFA stadium categories|Category three]] stadium by [[UEFA]]'s standards and has hosted matches for the [[1972 Rugby League World Cup]], [[UEFA Euro 1984]], the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], and the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]].

The stadium has hosted concerts by many famous artists, including [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[David Bowie]], [[Pink Floyd]] and [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]]. Former president Nicholas Sarkozy played at this arena with his rock band when he was a teenager, before getting involved in politics.

==History==
In 1910, the mayor of [[Lyon]], [[Édouard Herriot]], came up with the idea to develop and build a sports stadium with an [[Track and field athletics|athletics]] track and a [[velodrome]] in the city. In 1912, the stadium was officially mandated and local [[architect]] [[Tony Garnier (architect)|Tony Garnier]] was given the reins to designing and constructing it. Construction began in 1914 with hopes that the stadium would be completed before the [[World's fair|International Exhibition of 1914]]. However, due to World War I, construction was temporarily halted, but resumed following the wars conclusion in 1919 with the assistance of a large number of German [[prisoner of war|POWs]]. By 1920, the stadium was completely functional. In 1926, the Stade de Gerland was inaugurated by Herriot.

The stadium originally had a [[cycling]] track, but it was removed in order to increase the seating capacity to 50,000. In 1984, minor renovations were made to the stadium by architect Rene Gagis in order to bring the stadium up to standards for [[UEFA Euro 1984]]. This included construction of the [[Jean Bouin]] and [[Jean Jaurès]] stands. Further renovations were needed to prepare the stadium for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], as by that time [[FIFA]] had mandated that all stadiums used for international matches, including the [[Football World Cup|World Cup]], had to be [[all-seater|all-seated]]. The north and south stands were completely dismantled and rebuilt, the [[Jean Jaurès]] and [[Jean Bouin]] side stands were untouched and the [[athletics (track and field)|athletics]] track that had remained, even after the cycling track had been removed, was taken out. The renovations were done by architect Albert Constantin. The new incarnation of Gerland had a maximum capacity of 40,500.

Since 1950 the stadium has been home to French professional [[Association football|football]] club [[Olympique Lyonnais]] who play in [[Ligue 1]], France's highest football division. Lyon moved into the stadium as a result of splitting from the [[Lyon OU|Lyon Olympique Universitaire]] sport club, which played at the Stade des Iris. The record attendance for a [[Ligue 1]] match is 48,552 for a derby match between Olympique Lyonnais and [[AS Saint-Étienne]] in 1982.

During the [[2003 FIFA Confederations Cup]] semi-final at the stadium between [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] and [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]], Cameroon midfielder [[Marc-Vivien Foé]] collapsed on the pitch and died shortly afterwards in hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/3024360.stm | title = Cameroon star Foe dies | publisher = BBC Sport| accessdate = 5 January 2008 | date=26 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerland is also used for events of mass such as The [[Rolling Stones]]'s concerts, [[Michael Jackson]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Johnny Hallyday]], [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]].

==Rugby League==
Stade de Gerland played host to the [[1972 Rugby League World Cup]] Final between [[Great Britain Lions|Great Britain]] and [[Australian Kangaroos|Australia]]. The French public seemed uninterested in a final that did not involve the [[France national rugby league team|French]] team, as only 4,231 spectators turned up. The game will always be remembered by the British for their captain [[Clive Sullivan]]'s wonderful long distance try, and by the Australians for perhaps "The greatest try never scored", later shown on TV to be legitimately scored by Australian fullback [[Graeme Langlands]], but disallowed by French referee Georges Jameau who believed him to be offside (TV footage indicated Langlands had been approximately one metre behind halfback [[Dennis Ward (rugby league)|Dennis Ward]] as he put up his kick). Lions hooker [[Mike Stephenson]] scored the 73rd-minute try that helped Great Britain level the scores and secure the World Cup. Had Aussie winger [[Ray Branighan]] succeeded with a 79th-minute penalty, or [[Bob Fulton]] landed one of three drop goal attempts in the last five minutes, the cup could easily have gone to Australia. But for the first time in the competition's history the scores were level at full time. An additional twenty minutes extra time was played, but no further score resulted, and Great Britain were awarded the cup by virtue of a better W-L record and due to having defeated Australia earlier in the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6QneX1iBrI 1972 Rugby League World Cup Final highlights]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stebonheath Park''' (''[[Welsh language|Welsh]]: Parc Stebonheath'') is a multi-use [[stadium]] in [[Llanelli]], [[West Wales]] with a capacity of 3,700. It is primarily used as a [[Association football|football]] ground and is the home of [[Llanelli Town A.F.C.]]. It was also used for athletics and Llanelli Amateur Athletic Club (Llanelli AAC) were based at the stadium. It is owned by [[Llanelli Town Council]]. From 2015 [[Raiders RL]] club used the stadium for their debut season in the [[Conference League South]] but are now based at the park on a permanent basis as they compete in the RFL professional tier as the only professional Rugby League team in South Wales.

==History==
Stebonheath Park has been used as a football ground since 1920.&lt;ref name="ltc-football"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.llanellitowncouncil.gov.uk/football.htm|title=Football &amp; Athletics - Stebonheath Park|publisher=[[Llanelli Town Council]]|accessdate=31 October 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105215838/http://www.llanellitowncouncil.gov.uk/football.htm|archivedate=5 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It almost hosted League football in the 1930s but the club lost out coming second in the vote. At the time the ground had a large wooden grandstand, a covered end terrace and a large bank on the south side, and it could easily have been developed into a Third Division ground.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} The stand was subsequently demolished and the ground re-shaped to allow the building of an adjacent by-pass road.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Stebonheath Park was home to the [[Wales national rugby league team]] in the 1930s. Here Wales were crowned European Champions, after defeating England 17–9, on 10 November 1938. [[Frank Whitcombe]] made his debut for Wales in this game.

The stadium has been owned by Llanelli Town Council since 1977. The council undertook major redevelopmemts of the stadium which included [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlighting]], a new 700 seater main stand, new terracing, a function room social club as well as all-weather training facilities for the athletics club.&lt;ref name="ltc-football"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wp-stebonheathreport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.welshpremier.com/stebonheath.ink|title=Stebonheath Report|date=23 January 2007|publisher=Welsh Premier Football|accessdate=31 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2008, a new open seated stand was built on existing terracing along one side of the ground with about 300 seats.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Around the pitch is a narrow 400 metre running track with four lanes on each straight.

==Raiders RL==
West Wales Raiders RL relocated to Llanelli in 2014 and struck up a deal to play at the stadium with the local council in preparation for the debut season in the Conference league south where they finished 3rd. The West Wales Raiders Rugby League Club previously known as Raiders RL are the most established Rugby league club[1] in West Wales formed in January 2015.[2] Formerly called Gwendreath Valley Raiders they moved to Llanelli when the club gained entry into the Conference League South which is level 4 of the Rugby League system. In 2017, Andrew Thorne purchased the semi professional League 1 club South Wales Ironmen, relocating the club immediately to Llanelli. The Ironmen will rebrand as West Wales Raiders from 2018 onwards.

They also have links with one of the oldest university rugby league teams in Wales the Warpigs from Swansea University. The raiders have taken over the running and coaching of the university rugby league team since 2017.

The Raiders first ever match was an away friendly against Aberystwyth University in February which they won 72-6. Their first league match was a home derby win against the defending champions Valley Cougars 34-6, captain Alan Pope scoring the clubs first try. The game was watched by over 370 spectators.[citation needed]

==History==
[[Image:USM Oran (1939).jpg|left|250px|thumb|USM Oran in 1939]]
The club was founded on March 1, 1926 under the name of Union Sportive Musulmane d'Oran in Medina Jedida, a famous popular quarter of [[Oran]], by the Algerian nationalist Sadek Boumaza with Bendouba "El Fellous", Benkoula, Boumefraa and others. They decided to create a team which became a multi-sports club some days after its creation. The club is the first one of North Africa to put the word ''Musulmane'' ({{lang-en|Muslim}}) in its name to differentiate from other European colonial teams&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.djazairess.com/fr/lexpression/34421 |title=USM Oran : Les " Noir et Blanc " en couleur |work=L'Expression Magazine |publisher=A. Salim |date=May 3, 2006 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The club was also named NADIT Oran between 1977 and 1989
