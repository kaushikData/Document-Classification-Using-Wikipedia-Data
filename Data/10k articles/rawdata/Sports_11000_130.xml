McKivat lead the way for Australia dominating the rucks and scoring a vital try. Renowned Australian journalist Claude Corbett was acting as one of the touch judges and referee Renton, over-ruled his goal decision on one of the Australian conversion attempts.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Whiticker, ''Captaining the Kangaroos'' (2004) New Holland p44&lt;/ref&gt;

Great Britain only needed to win the third Test to tie the series and keep the Ashes but were reduced to 12 men early in the encounter after an injury to Dick Ramsdale. Great Britain led 8–0 early but had no answer to the Australian attack as they ran in nine tries.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Whiticker, ''Captaining the Kangaroos'' (2004) New Holland p44&lt;/ref&gt;

This would be the first (and final) time the Kangaroos would win The Ashes on British soil until the [[1963-64 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France|1963–64 Kangaroo tour]].

'''Axe throwing''' is a sport in which the competitor throws an [[axe]] at a target, attempting to hit the bulls eye as near as possible. Axe throwing is an event in most [[lumberjack]] competitions. Today there are commercial locations in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom where participants can compete, similar to [[Darts|dart throwing]], as well as opportunities at festivals and some theme parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/competitive-ax-throwing-is-an-actual-thing-and-apparently-its-best-done-with-beer/2016/09/30/0015175a-7c1f-11e6-beac-57a4a412e93a_story.html|title=Competitive axe-throwing is an actual thing, and apparently it’s best done with beer|last=Heller|first=Karen|date=September 30, 2016|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=December 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://montrealgazette.com/business/axe-throwing-is-suddenly-all-the-rage-in-montreal|title=Axe-throwing is suddenly all the rage in Montreal|last=Delean|first=Paul|date=November 7, 2016|work=The Gazette|accessdate=December 22, 2016|location=Montreal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/09/canada/492749/|title=Big in Canada: Throwing Axes for Fun|last=Bosker|first=Bianca|date=September 2016|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=December 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/ct-axe-throwing-parties-0823-20160823-story.html|title=Ax throwing — the 'modern-day bowling' — coming to Chicago|last=Lindner|first=Matt|newspaper=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Rules==
[[File:Ming Culture Village - axe throwing - P1060946.JPG|left|thumb|Axe throwing at the Ming Culture Village, a theme park near the [[Yangshan Quarry]], China]]The target is thirty-six inches wide, consisting of five rings that are each four inches wide. The outside ring is worth one point, the next one in is worth two, then three, then four and finally the bulls eye is worth five points. The distance of the throwing line to the target should be 6.1 meters or 21 feet,  but at least one association conducts competitions from 15 and 30 foot distances.&lt;ref name="gransforsbruk"&gt;{{cite web|title=The rules of Axe Throwing |url=https://theaxethrowing.com |publisher=gransforsbruk.com |accessdate=8 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140131064019/http://www.gransforsbruk.com/en/using-an-axe/axe-throwing/the-rules-of-axe-throwing/ |archivedate=31 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="starinfo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lumberjack Events and Rules|url=http://www.starinfo.com/ljguide/events/rules.shtml|publisher=starinfo.com|accessdate=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lumberjackworldchampionships"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lumberjack World Championships|url=http://www.lumberjackworldchampionships.com/|publisher=lumberjackworldchampionships.com|accessdate=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[axe]] is scored for the value of the outer most ring that it is touching. Each player gets five throws in a game for a maximum score of 25. The thrower must not step over the throwing line before the axe hits or misses the target; a thrower who steps over the line gets 0 points. Before the competition, a special target for practice throws must be made available. Throwers practicing on the competition target will be disqualified from the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gransforsbruk.com/en/using-an-axe/axe-throwing/the-rules-of-axe-throwing/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140131064019/http://www.gransforsbruk.com/en/using-an-axe/axe-throwing/the-rules-of-axe-throwing/ |archivedate=2014-01-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cautions ==
[[File:Lexington Barbecue Festival - lumberjack 1.jpg|thumb|Axe throwing ([[Lexington Barbecue Festival]])]]
The sport of axe throwing deals with a potentially dangerous weapon, so the throwing area must be kept safe at all times. If there is an open area behind the target, then spectators and others should be plainly prevented from walking into said area. The target area should be taped off using flags or light fencing materials. A first aid kit and a person trained in first aid and CPR should be at hand in the event of an emergency. For competition in rural and remote areas, the GPS location for the event should be reported in the case of First-Responders being needed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hawkthrowing.com/tomahawk-throwing-competitions.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== World Axe Throwing League ==

The '''[https://worldaxethrowingleague.com World Axe Throwing League]''' (WATL) is the largest professional association for axe throwing in the world&lt;ref&gt;[[World Axe Throwing League]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=January 2018}}, and the global governing body &amp; league for the sport of axe throwing. With 41 members in 9 countries, WATL is responsible for the organization of axe throwing’s major international tournaments, notably the World Axe Throwing Championship.

== National Axe Throwing Federation ==
[[File:The Wilson Cup.jpg|thumb|The Wilson Cup (center) - awarded to the annual winner of the National Axe Throwing Championship.]]
The '''[http://www.nationalaxe.com/ National Axe Throwing Federation]''' (NATF) is an organization with global membership that seeks to establish standardized rules for the sport of axe throwing.  Throwers in NATF sanctioned leagues compete in the National Axe Throwing Championship to award an annual winner of the Wilson Cup.

'''Chiayi City Municipal Baseball Stadium''' ({{zh|t=嘉義市立棒球場|p=Jiāyì Shìlì Bàngqiúchǎng}}) is a multi-use [[stadium]] in [[Chiayi City]], [[Taiwan]]. It is currently mostly used for [[baseball]] games and was ever the home stadium of [[Chinatrust Whales]] from 1998 to 2003. The stadium was originally built in 1918 during the [[Taiwan under Japanese rule]] era and has been repeatedly refurbished. After the last 1998 refurbishment this stadium can hold 10,000 people, and regularly holds [[Chinese Professional Baseball League]] (CPBL) games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Chiayi_Baseball_Field |title=Chiayi Baseball Field - BR Bullpen |publisher=Baseball-reference.com |date=2011-01-04 |accessdate=2014-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trivia==
This stadium is not the [[Chiayi County Baseball Stadium]] located in [[Taibao City]], [[Chiayi County]]. The Chiayi County Baseball Stadium was built in 1996 and had been substantially invested and maintained by the [[Taiwan Major League]] (TML) as the home stadium of the [[Chiayi-Tainan Luka]]. On the contrary, Chiayi Baseball Field has been mainly for the use of [[CPBL]]. Chiayi County Baseball Stadium has a smaller capacity and is currently derelict after TML's collapse in 2003.

The '''Claret Stakes''' was a [[Flat racing|flat]] [[Horse racing|horse race]] in [[Great Britain]] open to four-year-olds. It was run on the Ditch-In course at [[Newmarket Racecourse|Newmarket]] over a distance of 2 [[mile]]s (3,218 metres), and was scheduled to take place each year in early or mid April at the Craven meeting. The Ditch-In course had a six [[furlong]] uphill finish and was considered more testing then the Two Middle Miles course, over which the similar [[Port Stakes]] was run.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhrm.co.uk/Some_Museum_Treasures/The_Beacon_Post.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cross-country skiing trail''' or '''''loipe'''''&lt;ref group=note&gt;From {{lang-de|Loipe}} or ''Langlaufloipe'', pl. –''n'', ''loipe'' is a loanword in English-language travel guides, referring to cross-country ski trails in Europe. It is a Germanization of the [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] word, ''løype,'' which originally meant a steep channel used to slide logs downhill into the valleys and which in turn came from the verb ''laupe'' ("run") whose [[causative]] ''løype,'' can translate as "to get running".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Trails may extend point-to-point, but are more typically loops for recreational use or for [[Cross-country skiing (sport)|competition]]. Until the mid-20th Century, trails were tracked by the passage of skiers. More recently, [[snow groomer]]s set tracks for [[Cross-country skiing#Classic|classic skiing]] and smooth lanes for [[skate skiing]].

{{Main|Cross-country skiing}}

Cross-country ski venues often comprise a system of trails or ''loipes'' of varying length and difficulty that loop back to a starting point. Often trails branch out from a common segment; the more challenging ones then branch off on longer legs. The length of each loop, including segments that coincide with other loops, is typically counted separately. Consequently, the total length of loops is greater than the total length of trail structure.
In some regions, skiers may travel between cross-country ski resorts, which are linked by point-to-point trails;&lt;ref group=note&gt;In German, ''Skifernwanderweg'', pl. –''e''.&lt;/ref&gt; these include:
* ''Grande Traversée du Jura''&lt;ref&gt;

Trail use fees are common at commercial ski venues and may also be found in jurisdictions where skiing occurs on public land; usually there are day, week and annual passes. Venues charging fees may also offer use of heated facilities with a lounge, waxing room, and toilets.&lt;ref&gt;

In jurisdictions where trail maintenance and grooming has traditionally been funded through taxes, transitions to a user-fee-based system, initiated by increasingly budget-constrained governments, have been met with opposition from those who advocate for the users of ''loipes'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Layout and construction===
An example of guidance for cross-country ski trail construction comes from Northern Arizona University, which cites the manual, "Recreational Trail Design and Construction," developed by the Minnesota Extension Service of the University of Minnesota&lt;ref name=Arizona&gt;
{{cite web
 | last = Editors
 | first =
 | title = Cross Country Ski Trail Considerations
 | work =
 | publisher = Northern Arizona University
 | date = 2001
 | url = http://www.prm.nau.edu/prm423/xc_ski_trail_design.htm
 | accessdate = 2014-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasizes the following aspects of recreational cross-country trail layout and construction: 
*'''Trail layout and length''' – The trail system should comprise loops with internal connectors and cutoffs that allow the skier discretion in how long to ski. Loop lengths should range from 5 to 15&amp;nbsp;km with a beginners loop of about 1&amp;nbsp;km. Minimum clearing widths should range between 3 and 5 meters, depending on what type of skiing is accommodated and whether a steep section would require herringbone technique uphill or turns downhill. [[Grade (slope)|Grades]] should usually be less than 5% rise over run for general skiing with occasional sustained pitches of 10% and short (less-than-50-m) pitches of up to 25%.&lt;ref name=Arizona/&gt;
*'''Trail construction''' – Trails should be smooth enough and free from protrusions to accommodate grooming when snow depth reaches 0.3 m. A sod surface with mowable vegetation reduces erosion and retains snow. Trails should have gentle curves, especially avoiding sharp turns at the bottom of downhills. Bridges should accommodate 5-tonne maintenance equipment.&lt;ref name=Arizona/&gt;
*'''Other considerations''' – Cross-country ski trails are considered compatible with winter snowshoeing and summer hiking and bicycling. They are considered to be incompatible with snowmobiling and wheeled traffic. Cross-country skiing venues should have adequate parking areas, rest areas for skiers, shelters every 15 to 20&amp;nbsp;km, and appropriate signage.&lt;ref name=Arizona/&gt;

=== Signage ===
The signage for trails or ''loipes'' may be governed by standards or practices. In North America, they follow the practice of the Cross-Country Ski Areas Association.&lt;ref&gt;

{{Main|Cross-country skiing (sport)}}
In its "Cross-country homologation manual," the FIS recognizes that fans of the sport wish to follow it on television. With this in mind, the manual addresses how to design the race course in a manner that not only enhances the experience of spectators, but of viewers, as well—not just to show the athletes in action, but to show the ways in which fans enjoy the action. The manual describes considerations regarding race courses, including:&lt;ref name=FIShomologation&gt;

 | accessdate = 2014-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Course design criteria
*Requirements for different race formats
*Course layouts
*Courses for skiers with disabilities

===Course design criteria===
In its manual, the FIS requires that courses be designed for the following race formats; Interval start, mass start, sprint and team sprint, relay and skiathlon; each has distance requirements and width requirements, which pertain primarily to up hills; each also has requirements for the number and types of climbs. The FIS requires that competition venues consist of two separate courses to accommodate the classic and skating components of the skiathlon competition, each 5&amp;nbsp;km long with cut-offs that create finer course length adjustment. The two combine to be a single 10&amp;nbsp;km course.&lt;ref name=FIShomologation/&gt;

A course is expected to test the skier's technical and physical abilities, to be laid out in a manner that takes advantage of the natural terrain, and to provide smooth transitions among uphills, downhills and "undulating" terrain (distributed approximately evenly among the three). The manual advocates that courses present a variety of uphills, varying in lengths and gradients between 6% and 12%, and which are arrayed efficiently within the venue. Terms include: definitions of climbs—major (9-18% for more than 30 m), short (9-18% for 10 to 29 m) and steep (greater than 18% for less than 10 m)—and definitions for maximum climb, total climb and for various differences in height, along the way. Course widths vary among 3, 6, 9 and 12 m, depending on the event.&lt;ref name=FIShomologation/&gt;

== Grooming ==
Until well into the 20th century and the advent of mechanized trail grooming, cross-country tracks were always made by the first skiers to pass through undisturbed, fresh snow and leave a parallel set of ski tracks behind them.&lt;ref name="Remembers"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Certain local and regional trails are available where the passage of skiers is the sole source of tracks.&lt;ref&gt;

===Grooming guidance===
The "USSA Cross-Country Technical Handbook" provides guidance on equipment and techniques used in modern mechanized snow grooming operations.&lt;ref name=USSAHandbook&gt;
{{cite web
 | last =USSA
 | first =
 | title = USSA Cross-Country Technical Handbook

 | publisher = U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association
 | date = 2004
 | url = https://www.nensa.net/organizers/resources/USSA/USSATechnicalManual.pdf
 | accessdate = 2014-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[snowmobile]] or a [[snow groomer]] may be equipped with attachments to groom smooth lanes for skate skiing and for setting classic tracks. Techniques and tools used depend on the condition of the snow, which may range between freshly fallen to congealed and icy.
*'''Groomers''' – Whereas small cross-country venues may use snow machines, race venues typically use large grooming machines, which are between 2.5 and 5.5 m wide and can groom a large area. Snowmobiles are better for setting of classic tracks in an ideal line.&lt;ref name=USSAHandbook/&gt;
*'''Grooming attachments''' – Attachments for large groomers include: a front blade, a tiller, a renovator and track setter. The leading front blade repositions snow in front of the machine for trailing equipment to recondition. The renovator digs into the snow pack to aerate and mix the old and new snow up to 30&amp;nbsp;cm deep, as needed. The tiller attached behind the machine conditions the snow into aa soft, granular consistency, ready for its comb, which packs the snow into a finished surface. For setting classic tracks, the groomer trails special pans, which mould the tracks. Attachments for snowmobiles perform the same functions at a smaller scale and include a roller to compact the snow over a wide swath and a drag to level the snow behind the roller.&lt;ref name=USSAHandbook/&gt;
*'''Grooming procedures''' – Grooming is best done with a falling temperature—typically after nightfall—to prevent excessive hardening. Once groomed, the tilled surface needs 1–2 hours to coalesce. Too-frequent grooming can destroy snow crystals and contaminate snow with oil and dirt.&lt;ref name=USSAHandbook/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Snow conditions===
Snow conditions define the tools and techniques needed for grooming. The "[[Cross Country Canada]] officials manual" explains snow conditions, starting with fundamentals of heat gain and loss In the snow layer, which include:&lt;ref name=CCCOfficialsManual&gt;
{{cite web
 | last = Thomson

 | accessdate = 2014-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[temperature gradient]] within the snow pack from the surface to the ground.
*Incoming [[ultra-violet radiation]] from sunlight, which heats the snow surface and can cause melting within the top few centimeters of the snowpack.
*Outgoing [[infra-red radiation]], which in clear conditions may cool the snow surface.
*Rain, which transfers heat directly to the snow and may remain as liquid water in the snowpack.
*Wind, whose dominant effect is cooling through evaporation and consequently creates loss of mass in the snow pack
These factors contribute to the metamorphism of snow, i.e. the process of reshaping snow crystals into smaller, more rounded ice grains, which in turn consolidates and settles the snow pack. Increased density increases strength by joining of grains though [[sintering]] and freezing of melted water. New-fallen snow may have a density of 150 - 200&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Whereas a snowmobile can pack snow to a density of 300 - 350&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, the densities required for recreational trails are 450&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and for racing, 500&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or higher.&lt;ref name=CCCOfficialsManual/&gt;

===Grooming basics===
As described in the "Cross Country Canada officials manual," basic grooming involves six processes, as follows:&lt;ref name=CCCOfficialsManual/&gt;
*Packing with rollers or other compaction devices achieves an increase in snow density.
*Surface shaping restores trails to a flat surface, using blades or drag graders.
*Conditioning to accelerate the aging processes and increase bonding of snow crystals within the snow pack; this may be done with a tiller.
*Mixing of new snow with older lower snow, using deep cutting implements allows the snow pack to set up better.
*Renovation creates a reduction in snow density and may include surface scarification or deep renovation with tools that cut to the desired depth.
*Power tilling to bring up and mix fresher snow from lower layers.

===Course preparation for classic and skating techniques===
According to the  "Cross Country Canada officials manual," FIS Rule 315.3.2 (ICR 2004) requires the following: “The ski tracks must be prepared so that ski control and gliding are possible without a lateral braking effect by any parts of the bindings. The two tracks should be set 17-30 cm. apart, measured from the middle of each track. The depth of the track should be 2-5 cm, even in hard or frozen snow.” FIS Rule 315.3.1 (ICR 2004) requires that for classic technique events a single track should "be set along the ideal skiing line of the competition course," which is normally through the middle of the trail, except for those curves that are too sharp, where the track should disappear.&lt;ref name=CCCOfficialsManual/&gt;

According to the same manual, FIS rule 315.4.1 (ICR 2004) reads: "For interval start competitions in free technique the course must be well-packed for a width of at least 4
meters." Tracks are no longer current practice for free-style races, where the skating technique prevails.&lt;ref name=CCCOfficialsManual/&gt;

The '''Czechoslovakia national rugby union team''' was the national rugby team of Czechoslovakia, before the country was split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia. They participated in qualifiers for the [[1991 Rugby World Cup - European qualification|1991 Rugby World Cup]], but did not qualify.

==History==
A Czechoslovak international team including players from an Austrian club called Wiener Amateure as well as players from the Slavia Bratislava club first played against Romania in 1927,&lt;ref&gt;{{cs icon}} [http://www.rugbyunion.cz/vyznamne-udalosti-ceskeho-ragby-v-bodech Významné události českého ragby v bodech]&lt;/ref&gt; but the match is seen as unofficial, since the Czechoslovak Rugby Union was only formed in 1928. They were captained by one František Ruber,&lt;ref&gt;{{cs icon}} [http://www.rugbyclubvyskov.cz/test.asp?sw=2]&lt;/ref&gt; who incidentally was a very good friend of Ondřej Sekora. Their first official match was against Germany in Leipzig in 1931.

In 1934 they were among the founding members of [[FIRA - Association of European Rugby|FIRA]] (as it was then known) along with [[France national rugby union team|France]], [[Italy national rugby union team|Italy]], [[Spain national rugby union team|Spain]], [[Catalonia national rugby union team|Catalonia]], [[Romania national rugby union team|Romania]] and [[Germany national rugby union team|Germany]].

In 1956 they took on European giants France in [[Toulouse]], losing by a respectable 3–28,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rugbyinternational.net/countries/czech-republic.htm Statistics]&lt;/ref&gt; which is rather remarkable, as rugby in Czechoslovakia was considerably ravaged by [[World War II]]. 

Some of their most notable players were Zdeněk Barchánek, Eduard Krützner, who was president of the [[Czech Rugby Union]] later on and Bruno Kudrna, [[Czech Rugby Player of the Year]] a record six times.

'''Firs Park''' was a [[association football|football]] stadium in [[Falkirk]], Scotland, which was the home of [[East Stirlingshire F.C.]] between 1921 and 2008. It was located on Firs Street, 0.3 miles north-east of the town centre. At the time of closing the ground had a capacity of 1,800 with 200 seated.

==History==

===Early years===
[[East Stirlingshire F.C.]] was formed in 1880 when a group of friends from a cricket team called ''Bainsford Blue Bonnets'' formed a football team under the name ''Britannia''.&lt;ref name="History_1880-1900"&gt;[http://www.eaststirlingshirefc.com/the-club/club-history/1880-1900/ Club History - 1880-1900], [[East Stirlingshire F.C.]]. Retrieved 6 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the club's first year of existence it found a home at Randyford Park in the east of Falkirk. At the time, the ground's previous tenant was a cricket team called ''East Stirlingshire Cricket Club'' and in 1881, Britannia also adopted the East Stirlingshire name, which stands to this day.&lt;ref name="History_1880-1900" /&gt; By the time the club was admitted to the [[Scottish Football League]] in 1900, the club was playing some home games at [[Merchiston Park]] in [[Bainsford]] and from 1907 onwards it became permanent.&lt;ref name="History_1900-1940"&gt;[http://www.eaststirlingshirefc.com/the-club/club-history/1900-1940/ Club History - 1900-1940], [[East Stirlingshire F.C.]]. Retrieved 10 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The club's first ever league game at Merchiston Park was a 3–2 defeat to [[Airdrieonians F.C. (1878)|Airdrieonians]] in August 1900 in front of a crowd of 2,500.&lt;ref name="History_1900-1940" /&gt;&lt;ref name="London_Hearts_1900"&gt;[http://www.londonhearts.com/scores/a1900/eaststirlingshire1901.htm Results for East Stirlingshire for 1900-01], ''londonhearts.com''. Retrieved 6 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, the club was forced to move from Bainsford when a railway line was built across Merchiston Park.&lt;ref name="History_1900-1940" /&gt; The club set about looking for a new site to play its home games and a derelict factory site on Firs Street in [[Falkirk]] was chosen. The site was named ''Firs Park'' after the street in which it was located and was officially opened in 1921 and would be the club's home for the next 87 years.&lt;ref name="History_1900-1940" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "inglis 443"&gt;{{harvnb|Inglis|1996|p=443}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first ever opposition at Firs Park was [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.]].&lt;ref name="History_1900-1940" /&gt;

Shortly after opening, the club's [[Scottish football attendance records|record attendance]] was set on 21 February 1921 in a [[Scottish Cup]] third round tie against eventual champions [[Partick Thistle F.C.]], when 12,000 people watched the match.&lt;ref name="Attendance"&gt;[http://www.footballgroundguide.com/leagues/scottish-spl-premier-and-football-league-clubs/scottish-league-two/east-stirlingshire-fc.html?expand=all East Stirlingshire F.C. | Ochilview Park | Football Ground Guide], ''scottishgrounds.co.uk''. Retrieved 29 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This remained the record attendance for the club during its entire tenure at Firs Park as crowds became smaller due to crowd regulation. In 2007, a limit of 750 was set by police during a [[2007–08 Scottish Challenge Cup#Quarter-finals|Challenge Cup]] tie with [[Greenock Morton F.C.]]. This was due to the small number of [[turnstile]]s and there only being one main exit gate.

===Merger with Clydebank Juniors F.C.===
In 1964, the board of directors at the club controversially merged East Stirlingshire and junior club [[Clydebank Juniors F.C.]] to create ''East Stirlingshire Clydebank''.&lt;ref name = "inglis 443"/&gt;&lt;ref name="History_1940-1970"&gt;[http://www.eaststirlingshirefc.com/the-club/club-history/1940-1970/ Club History - 1940-1970] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325012812/http://www.eaststirlingshirefc.com/the-club/club-history/1940-1970/ |date=25 March 2013 }}, [[East Stirlingshire F.C.]]. Retrieved 6 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the new club relocated to [[Kilbowie Park]] in [[Clydebank]] and Firs Park was closed.&lt;ref name = "inglis 443"/&gt;&lt;ref name="History_1940-1970" /&gt; However, the fans won a legal challenge against the move and the club returned to Firs Park and E.S. Clydebank was disbanded. East Stirlingshire F.C. was reformed in 1965.&lt;ref name = "inglis 443"/&gt;&lt;ref name="History_1940-1970" /&gt; In the meantime, however, the merged club had taken the enclosure roof and floodlights from Firs Park.&lt;ref name = "inglis 443"/&gt;

Apart from replacing the roof and floodlights, there were few changes to Firs Park until it closed.&lt;ref name = "inglis 443"/&gt; The Main Stand was replaced in 1992, with the club opting for a near replica of the previous stand.&lt;ref name = "inglis 443"/&gt; At closure, the stadium had a seating capacity of 200 with room for a further 1,600 standees.&lt;ref name="Standing"&gt;[http://www.footballgroundmap.com/ground/firs-park/east-stirlingshire Firs Park - Football Ground Map], ''footballgroundmap.com''. Retrieved 10 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Firs Park.JPG|thumb|The final game played at Firs Park|200px|left|alt=A football game with players and a referee. A stand full of people in the background]]

===Final match and closure===
Due to the prohibitive costs of improving facilities to meet regulations set by the [[Scottish Football Association]],&lt;ref name="BBC_departure"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/e/east_stirlingshire/7376220.stm Shire explain Firs Park Departure], [[BBC Sport]]. 30 April 2008. Retrieved 11 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; the club decided to leave Firs Park at the end of the [[2007–08 Scottish Third Division|2007–08 season]]. The last ever league game to be played at Firs Park was a 3–1 victory for the Shire against [[Montrose F.C.]], which meant the club avoided finishing bottom of the [[Scottish Football League]] for a sixth consecutive season.&lt;ref name="BBC_McInally"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/e/east_stirlingshire/7374559.stm McInally looks forward for Shire], [[BBC Sport]]. 29 April 2008. Retrieved 7 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

East Stirlingshire did subsequently play one last game at Firs Park, a "closed doors" pre-season friendly vs St Johnstone on Tuesday 15 July 2008, losing 1-3.&lt;ref name="Last ever game"&gt;[http://www.perthstjohnstonefc.co.uk/newsitemsdetail.php?param=69, [[St Johnstone F.C.]]. 18 July 2008. Retrieved 6 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relocation===
The club groundshared with neighbours [[Stenhousemuir F.C.|Stenhousemuir]] at their [[Ochilview Park]] home. The move was originally intended be for a period of five years during which the club planned to develop a new venue in Falkirk.&lt;ref name="BBC_departure" /&gt; After lying unused and derelict for almost four years, Firs Park was demolished in January 2012.
In March 2018, it was announced The Shire had secured a groundshare at [[Falkirk Stadium]]. The first game in their new home was on 5th July 2018; a 3-1 pre-season friendly win over [[Frickley Athletic]].

[[File:Paavo Nurmi (Paris 1924).jpg|thumb|[[Paavo Nurmi]] at the 1924 Olympics]]
"The '''Flying Finn'''" ({{lang-fi|Lentävä suomalainen}}) is a nickname given to several [[Finland|Finnish]] athletes who were noted for their speed. Originally, it was given to several [[Finland|Finnish]] [[Middle-distance running|middle]] and [[Long-distance running|long-distance]] runners. The term was later extended to notable Finnish racing sportsmen.

==Running==
The nickname was first used of [[Hannes Kolehmainen]], also known as ''"Smiling Hannes"'', as he took home three gold medals and broke two world records during the [[1912 Summer Olympics]] in [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=1912 Stockholm |work=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |url=http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/2004/1912.html |accessdate=2006-12-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005001540/http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/2004/1912.html |archivedate=2006-10-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Finnish runners started to dominate long-distance running, the nickname was passed on to all successful Finns in the sport, including multi-[[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medalists [[Paavo Nurmi]] and [[Ville Ritola]]. Nurmi won three gold medals at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] in [[Belgium]] and five at the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]], where he was partnered with Ritola, who ran to four gold medals. [[Volmari Iso-Hollo]], the winner of 3000 m [[Steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]] at the [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932]] and [[1936 Summer Olympics]], was one of the best-known Finnish runners in the 1930s and also nicknamed the Flying Finn. During his tour of the [[United States]] in 1940, [[Taisto Mäki]]—who held five world records—was regularly referred to as a Flying Finn.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite news|title=Pony Express| work=Time|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,763816,00.html|accessdate=2008-08-25 | date=1940-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last Flying Finn in running was [[Lasse Virén]], who won the 5000 m and 10,000 m events at the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics]].

==Motorsport==
===Rallying===
[[File:Mäkinen and Aaltonen - 1965 Rally Finland.jpg|thumb|[[Timo Mäkinen]] and [[Rauno Aaltonen]] at the 1965 [[Rally Finland|1000 Lakes Rally]]]]
The nickname was next used to describe the efforts of Finnish [[rallying|rally]] drivers in the 1960s. [[Timo Mäkinen]], [[Rauno Aaltonen]] and [[Simo Lampinen]] were among the first drivers referenced as the Flying Finn. In 1968, [[Castrol]] released a film called "The Flying Finns", it featured the 1968 [[Rally Finland|1000 Lakes Rally]] and concentrated on documenting the duel between Mäkinen and [[Hannu Mikkola]]. The term then moved on to the next generations of Finnish rally drivers, and among others, the four-time World Rally Champions [[Juha Kankkunen]] and [[Tommi Mäkinen]] were often referred to as Flying Finns.

===Formula 1===
[[File:Hakkinen.jpg|thumb|right|Mika Häkkinen at the [[2000 United States Grand Prix]].]]

The first driver to carry the nickname in [[Formula One]] was [[Leo Kinnunen]]. Kinnunen had the title written on his helmet in 1970, when he won the [[World Sportscar Championship]] for [[Porsche]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Nieminen, Jamie |title=Flying Finns - 50 vuotta autourheilun historiaa |work=[[Turun Sanomat]] |url=http://www.turunsanomat.fi/ajassa/?ts=1,3:1007:0:0,4:7:0:1:2001-04-28,104:7:70829,1:0:0:0:0:0: |accessdate=2006-12-29 |language=Finnish |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930194011/http://www.turunsanomat.fi/ajassa/?ts=1%2C3%3A1007%3A0%3A0%2C4%3A7%3A0%3A1%3A2001-04-28%2C104%3A7%3A70829%2C1%3A0%3A0%3A0%3A0%3A0%3A |archivedate=2007-09-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he wasn't able to turn his success in [[sports car racing]] into a successful F1 career in his underpowered [[Surtees]]. In the 1980s the moniker was given to [[Keke Rosberg]], who became the first well-known Finn in the sport, winning the [[1982 Formula One season|1982 world championship]]. Following the success of later Finnish drivers, Rosberg has been described as the "original Flying Finn".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/teams_and_drivers/hall_of_fame/204/|title=Keke Rosberg|work=Official Formula 1 website|accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Rosberg, many Finnish Formula 1 drivers have also been called the "Flying Finn", including [[Mika Häkkinen]], who won the drivers' championship in [[1998 Formula One season|1998]] and [[1999 Formula One season|1999]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/1544073.stm|title=Flying Finn waits for an answer|publisher=BBC Sport|date=14 September 2001|accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mika Salo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/motor-racing-signs-of-hope-for-the-forgotten-mika-1156288.html|title=Motor racing: Signs of hope for the forgotten Mika|work=The Independent|location=London|first=David|last=Tremayne|date=31 May 1998|accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kimi Räikkönen]], who was drivers' champion in [[2007 Formula One season|2007]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/motor-racing/ferrari-president-luca-di-montezemolo-confirms-decision-over-kimi-raikkonen-return-will-be-made-in-the-next-few-days-8806751.html|title=Ferrari president Luca Di Montezemolo confirms decision over Kimi Raikkonen return will be made in 'the next few days'|work=The Independent|location=London|first=Jack|last=de Menezes|date=10 September 2013|accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heikki Kovalainen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/motor-sport/flying-finn-crashes-renault/story-e6frfgb6-1111113077039|title=Flying Finn crashes Renault|work=Herald Sun|location=Melbourne|first=Paul|last=Glover|date=1 March 2007|accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Valtteri Bottas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/mar/11/valtteri-bottas-formula-one|title=Valtteri Bottas roars into Formula One with iron will to succeed|work=The Guardian|location=London|first=Paul|last=Weaver|date=11 March 2013|accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motorcycles===
On two wheels, the most famous Flying Finn was [[Jarno Saarinen]], also known as ''The Baron'', who won the 250cc [[road racing]] [[List of Grand Prix motorcycle racing World Champions|World Championship]] as [[Privateer (motorsport)|privateer]] in 1972, and finished a close second to [[Giacomo Agostini]] in the 350cc class. Saarinen died the following year, while leading both the 250cc and 500cc championships and after competing for only three years. He remains in [[motorcycle sport]] history books for developing a new riding style, which is still predominantly in use today; body hanging off the bike with knee near the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=McComisky, John | title=The Flying Finn | work=BikeSportNews | url=http://www.bikesportnews.com/bsn.nsf/News/EAC5A9B5C154F8B080256B9C00473E43?OpenDocument | accessdate=2006-12-29}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s, Finnish rider [[Heikki Mikkola]] won four [[motocross]] world championships and also became known as the ''Flying Finn''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motorcyclemuseum.org/halloffame/detail.aspx?RacerID=383&amp;lpos=-1025px&amp;letter=M&amp;txtFname=&amp;rblFname=S&amp;txtLname=&amp;rblLname=S&amp;discipline=0 |title=Heikki Mikkola |publisher=motorcyclemuseum.org |accessdate=8 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mika Kallio]], who finished second in the 125cc championship in 2005 and 2006, has also been nicknamed the Flying Finn. Mauno Hermunen, who has finished third in 2010 and fourth in 2011 in the world supermoto series, has also been nicknamed the Flying Finn.

==Football==
[[Shefki Kuqi]], who played for Scottish side [[Hibernian F.C.]] has also been nicknamed the "Flying Finn", owing to a strange but popular celebration when he scores a goal. His habit of throwing himself onto the ground, with his arms outstretched and landing on his chest, has drawn notice from many fans and media pundits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Wathan, Chris | title=Kuqi: The Flying Finn | work=WalesOnline | url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/footballnation/football-news/2009/03/22/dangerman-kuqi-aiming-for-finns-to-get-better-in-wales-91466-23201783/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lesotho national cricket team''' is the team that represents the [[Kingdom of Lesotho]] in [[international cricket]]. They became an affiliate member of the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) in 2001&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Countries/110.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[ICC members|associate member]] in 2017.&lt;ref name="Assoc"/&gt; They made their official international debut at Division Three of the Africa Region of the [[ICC World Cricket League]] in April 2006, where they came last in the eight team tournament. 

In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full [[Twenty20 International]] (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all [[Twenty20]] matches played between Lesotho and other [[List of International Cricket Council members|ICC members]] after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/media-releases/672322|title=All T20 matches between ICC members to get international status|work=[[International Cricket Council]]|date=26 April 2018|accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MacCAM''' (often written as '''MacCam''', '''Mac-Cam''' or '''Mac Cam''') is a system of [[slow-motion]] cameras developed by [[FastCAM Replay LLC]] and [[DEL Imaging Systems LLC]] used during [[tennis]] matches to replay close or controversial line calls. The system is named after [[John McEnroe]], who was infamous for contesting [[umpire]] calls. [[CBS]] was the first network to use the MacCam widely, as John McEnroe was one of their tennis analysts.

==History==
The MacCam was used at the [[2004 US Open (tennis)|2004 U.S. Open]] to demonstrate several poor calls by [[Tennis#Officials|chair umpires]]. In [[Serena Williams]]' controversial quarterfinal loss to [[Jennifer Capriati]], several poor calls were contested by Williams. Television replays demonstrated that there were actually several crucial calls that were obviously erroneous. Following this match, the chair umpire [[Mariana Alves]] did not officiate for the remainder of the tournament; this however was not punitive, as commonly thought, as she was not scheduled to officiate.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/09/sports/tennis/williams-receives-apology-and-umpires-open-is-over.html&lt;/ref&gt; A major limitation of the MacCAM was that it could only evaluate the baseline—not sidelines or service line calls.  It was ultimately supplanted by [[Hawk-Eye]] and similar technologies.

==Details==
The MacCAM system has since been replaced at the US Open as well as other supporting tournaments with the ShotSpot system. In the US Open it was available only where the venue has necessary equipment (Arthur Ashe stadium).

==Trivia==
* Though [[trademark]]ed by FastCAM Replay, the phrase "Mac Cam" is sometimes used [[genericized trademark|generically]] by American media to refer to any manual or automated line monitoring, ball tracking or replay system, including [[Hawk-Eye]], [[Cyclops (computer system)|Cyclops]], [[PointTracker]] and [[Auto-Ref]].

'''''Max Schmeling''''' is a 2010 German biographical film directed by [[Uwe Boll]]. The film tells the story of German [[boxing]] [[icon]] [[Max Schmeling]]. It was released abroad under the title ''Max Schmeling: Fist of the Reich.''

==Plot==

A [[Fallschirmjäger (World War II)|German paratrooper]] is seen being injured and receiving treatment in [[Crete]] during the 1941 German [[Battle of Crete|invasion of the island]] during [[World War II]]. He is then detailed to escort a British prisoner of war who recognises him as the famous heavyweight boxer Max Schmeling and asks him to tell his story.

Schmeling's boxing matches in the 1930s are then portrayed along with his marriage to the Czech actress [[Anny Ondra]] ([[Susanne Wuest]]) who dislikes boxing, against a backdrop of the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] taking control in Germany. Schmeling has no sympathy for the Nazi ideology and is seen to be protective of his Jewish manager Joe Jacobs ([[Vladimir Weigl]]). In 1936, a [[Joe Louis vs. Max Schmeling|fight]] in New York City with the formidable [[Joe Louis]] ([[Yoan Pablo Hernández]]) is arranged despite the opposition of the Nazi head of sport who fears he might lose, because [[Adolf Hitler]] wants it to go ahead. Schmeling trains hard and studies film of Louis in preparation for the fight which he wins following a knockout in the 12th round. He returns home a hero but when he takes on Louis again in 1938, he is knocked out after 124 seconds. He returns home and helps some victims of [[Kristallnacht]] and when war breaks out in 1939, he obeys an instruction to enlist in the paratroops rather than fleeing abroad.

The story returns to Crete where Schmeling allows the British prisoner to escape. Back in Germany in 1945, with the German Army on the brink of defeat, he returns to his wife. They abandon their country estate to the advancing Soviets and settle in Hamburg, [[West Germany]]. In 1947, Schmeling briefly returns to boxing after failing to find other work before retiring from the sport for good in 1948.

==Critical reception==
There was criticism of the acting performance of [[Henry Maske]] as the title character, director Boll having selected a real life boxer rather than an actor to play the lead. The plot was also criticized for being "cliche-laden."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Max Schmeling -- Film Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/max-schmeling-film-review-30162|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''North Road''' is a [[cricket]] and former [[association football|football]] ground in [[Glossop]] in [[England]]. It was the home ground of [[Glossop North End A.F.C.|Glossop North End]] during their time in [[the Football League]], and was also used by [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire CCC]] between 1899 and 1910.

==History==
The ground was originally used for cricket, but also became home to [[Glossop North End A.F.C.|Glossop North End]] football club in 1898 when the club were elected to the Second Division of the Football League. The football ground was located in the south-east corner of the site, with a seated stand was constructed on the northern side of the pitch and embankments built on the south and eastern sides. During the football season a temporary wooden seated stand was erected behind the western goal, but removed for the cricket season.&lt;ref name=UD&gt;Paul Smith &amp; Shirley Smith (2005) ''The Ultimate Directory of English &amp; Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888–2005'', Yore Publications, p93, {{ISBN|0954783042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first League match played at North Road was on 3 September 1898, with Glossop defeating [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] 4–1 in front of 4,000 spectators. The following summer Derbyshire began using the ground, playing one or two matches there each season until 1910. In total the ground hosted fifteen [[first-class cricket|first-class]] [[County Championship]] matches.

The ground's record attendance of 10,736 was set on 31 January 1914 for an [[FA Cup]] match between Glossop and [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]]. At the end of the [[1914–15 Football League|following season]] Glossop were voted out of the Football League.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Twydell (2001) ''Denied F.C.: The Football League Election Struggles'', p14&lt;/ref&gt; The last Football League match at North Road was played on 17 April 1915, with just 500 spectators watching a 1–1 draw with [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]].&lt;ref name=UD/&gt;

The football club eventually left the ground in 1955, but it continues to be used as a cricket ground, with Derbyshire playing a Second XI Trophy match at the ground annually since 1997.

A '''race track''' (or "racetrack", "racing track" or "racing circuit") is a facility built for [[racing]] of [[vehicles]], [[sportsperson|athletes]], or animals (e.g. [[horse racing]] or [[greyhound racing]]). A race track also may feature [[grandstand]]s or concourses. Racetracks are also used in the study of [[animal locomotion]].  Some motorsport tracks are called '''speedways'''.

A '''racetrack''' is a permanent facility or building. '''Racecourse''' is an alternate term for a [[horse racing]] track, found in countries such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[India]], [[Australia]], [[Hong Kong]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]]. Race tracks built for bicycles are known as '''[[velodrome]]s'''. '''Circuit''' is a common alternate term for racetrack, given the circuit configuration of most race tracks, allowing races to occur over several laps.

A '''race course''', as opposed to a ''racecourse'', is a non-permanent track for sports, particularly [[road running]], [[water sports]], [[road racing]], or [[rallying]]. Many sports usually held on racetracks also can occur on temporary tracks, such as the [[Monaco Grand Prix]] in [[Formula One]].

[[File:Racecourse In Chester3.jpg|thumb|A typical racecourse]]

==History==
There is some evidence of racetracks being developed in several ancient civilizations. The most developed ancient racetracks were the [[hippodrome]]s of the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] and the circuses of the [[Roman Empire]]. Both of these structures were designed for horse and [[chariot]] racing. The stadium of the [[Circus Maximus]] in [[Ancient Rome]] could hold 200,000 spectators.

Racing facilities existed during the [[Middle Ages]], and there are records of a public racecourse being opened at [[Newmarket Racecourse|Newmarket]] in London in 1174. In 1780 the [[Earl of Derby]] created a horse-racing course on his estate at Epsom; the [[Epsom Derby|English Derby]] continues to be held there today. Racecourses in the [[British Isles]] are based on grass, known as turf tracks. In the United States, the race tracks are dirt.

[[File:1911boardtrackracing.jpg|thumb|right|Motorcycles racing on a highly banked board track in 1911]]
With the advent of the automobile in the late nineteenth/early twentieth century, racetracks were designed to suit the nature of powered machines. The earliest tracks were modified horse racing courses. Racing automobiles in such facilities began in September 1896, at Narragansett Park in [[Cranston, Rhode Island]]. The [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] was opened in August 1909.

Beginning in the early 1900s, motorcycle races were run on high, banked, wooden race tracks called [[board track racing|board tracks]]. During the 1920s, many of the races on the [[American Automobile Association|AAA]] Championship circuit were run on such board tracks.
Modern racetracks are designed with spectator safety being paramount, following incidents of spectator and [[track marshal]]s fatalities. These often involve run off areas, barriers, and high fencing.

==Configurations==
[[File:Hongkongjockeyclub.jpg|thumb|Horseracing track, [[Happy Valley Racecourse]] in Hong Kong, showing grandstands]]

Some racetracks offer little in the way of permanent infrastructure other than the track; others incorporate spectator facilities such as grandstands, [[hospitality]] or facilities for competitors, such as pit lanes and garages, paddocks and stables. Several racetracks are incorporated into larger venues or complexes, incorporating [[golf courses]], [[museums]], [[hotels]], and [[conference centre]]s. Some racetracks are small enough to be contained indoors, for sports such as [[motocross]], [[cycling]], and [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]].

Many racetracks are multi-use, allowing different types of sport on the same track, or incorporating many tracks in one venue. Commonly [[running track]]s are incorporated within general use or [[soccer]] stadiums, either permanently visible or covered by stands or pitches.

Many horse and motorsport tracks are configurable, allowing different routes or sections. Some venues contain smaller tracks inside larger ones, with access tunnels and bridges for spectators. Some racetracks incorporate a short course and a longer course which uses part of the shorter one, usually the main straight, such as [[Brands Hatch]]. The [[Le Mans]] road race venue is centred on a smaller permanent circuit within its complex.

[[File:vallelunga.race.circuit.in.italy.arp.jpg|left|thumb|The [[ACI Vallelunga Circuit|ACI Vallelunga]] car racing track near [[Rome]], [[Italy]], a typical meandering layout with run-off areas]]

==Motorsport==
Race tracks are primarily designed for [[road racing]] competition through speed, featuring defined start-finish lines or posts, and sometimes even a series of defined timing points that divide the track into time sectors. Some sports merely measure endurance, or how long a competitor can race. Race tracks can host individual or team sports. Racetracks can feature [[rolling start]]s, or fixed starts, with associated equipment (starting blocks, cages, wheel traps etc.) They invariably feature a [[pit lane]], and usually timing equipment.

===Track layout===
Some race tracks are of an [[oval]] shape, often banked{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}, which allows almost universal spectator views or high speed racing (cycling, stock cars), but are often criticised for lack of excitement; these predominate in North America. A famous one is [[Nardò Ring|Nardò]] where high-speed manufacturer testing often takes place, and the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]]. Some oval tracks are variations on an oval shape, for practical reasons or to introduce varying difficulties such as [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]] (a tri-oval). Most race tracks have meandering circuits with many curves, [[chicane]]s and changes in height, to allow for a challenge in skill to the competitors, notably [[motocross]] and [[touring car racing]] - these tend to predominate throughout most of the world, but especially in Europe.[[Image:Nardò ring.jpg|thumb|right|Photograph from space of [[Nardò Ring]] in Italy, it is {{convert|12.5|km|mi}} long and is perfectly round&amp;nbsp;– the image was taken at an angle making it appear elliptical.]]

===Road circuits===
{{main|Street circuit}}
Flatter meandering motorsport courses are sometimes called 'road circuits', originating in the fact that the earliest road racing circuits were simply closed-off public roads. True road circuits are still in use, e.g. the [[Australian Grand Prix|Australian GP]] has been run in [[Adelaide Street Circuit|Adelaide]] and continues to be in [[Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit|Melbourne]] on regular city streets. The most famous of these are the [[Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco GP]], and the [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps|Spa-Francorchamps]] circuit in Belgium. Some racetracks are specifically configured in a long straight, namely [[drag racing]]. Some races will be held only over the straight portion of a track (some horse racing and sprint athletics).

===Converted airfields===
The boom in motorsport flared after WW2, when many airfields particularly in [[Great Britain]] were left without further use. The most famous British track - [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] - is one after being a WW2 [[Class a airfield|Class A Airfield]], as are [[Castle Combe Circuit|Castle Combe]] and [[Goodwood Circuit]]'s. The long runways were perfect for drag strips such as at [[Santa Pod Raceway]], and circuit layout usually creatively combined parts of the runways and the surrounding perimeter taxiway. This type of track also appears on the popular motoring show ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', which is filmed at [[Dunsfold Aerodrome]], in Surrey, England.

==Books ==
In 2015, Maurice Hamilton published "Grand Prix Circuits: Maps and statistics from every Formula One track", which covered over 70 Grand Prix racing circuits. It provided maps, pictures and a brief history of each track. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/951146691|title=Grand prix circuits : history and course map for every formula one circuit|last=Maurice,|first=Hamilton,|isbn=9780008136604|location=London|oclc=951146691}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each course map is accompanied statistics including circuit lengths, lap records and even the names of corners and straights.

[[File:LeosRollerRink.jpg|thumb|Leo's Roller Rink, a typical American roller rink of the 1950s and 1960s located in [[Kirksville, Missouri]]]]

A '''roller rink''' is a hard surface usually consisting of [[Hardwood]], Rollerboard or [[Concrete]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.roller-rink.com/eq_floor_skate.htm&lt;/ref&gt; used for [[roller skating]] or [[inline skating]]. This includes [[roller hockey]], [[speed skating]], [[roller derby]], and individual recreational skating. Roller rinks can be located in an indoor or outdoor facility. Most skating center facilities range anywhere from under 14,000 square feet to more than 
21,000 square feet.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rollerskating.org/assets/future%20operator%20benefits%20email.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Massachusetts businessman [[James Plimpton]]'s 1863 invention of an improved [[roller skate]] led to a boom in popularity in the late 19th century, particularly in cities of the American East Coast. At first, people roller skated at home, but within twenty years businesses dedicated to the activity began to spring up. Plimpton himself is credited with opening the first roller skating rink in [[New York City]]. Patrons who enjoyed ice skating during the winter months participated in the similar activity, now year-round. Early roller rinks varied greatly in size and type, both indoor and outdoor. Many consisted of simple wooden platforms that sometimes doubled as dance floors or ballrooms. While primarily an activity of eastern cities, a few enterprising individuals toured the rural areas of the Midwest and South with wagon-loads of roller skates. These entrepreneurs went from town-to-town, often in conjunction with circuses or carnivals, renting out skates and using whatever locally-available surface as an impromptu rink. The [[post–World War II baby boom]] also saw a boom in roller rinks across the United States. Having a roller skating birthday party became something of a rite of passage for American children in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Roller rinks in the United States underwent significant changes in the 1970s. New plastics led to improved skate wheels—ones providing a smoother, quieter ride—and easier-to-maintain skate floors.

The [[Disco]] craze from popular 1970s culture led to another increase in the popularity of roller rinks—or [[roller disco]]s, as some became. Gone were the staid lighting and old-fashioned organ music as a generally older clientele were replaced by adolescents and [[twentysomething (term)|twenty-something]]s skating under mirror balls and special lights to disco beats. The end of the Disco Era and the advent of inline roller skates hit the roller rink industry hard, with many rinks closing. However, as had happened throughout history, most rink owners adapted and survived the economic storm. [[Roller derby]], a professional sport of the 1950s and 1960s once considered virtually dead, has seen a [[DIY]], [[grassroots]] rebirth in popularity in the early 21st century with amateur and semi-pro teams forming leagues nationwide. Many rink owners support this activity, along with roller hockey, speed skating, and roller figure skating contests.

==Business model==
According to data collected in 2004 a Roller Skating Rink owner can expect a 5% growth rate in their first year of business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bplans.com/roller_skate_rink_business_plan/financial_plan_fc.php#.T_41UGi2CzY B Plans]&lt;/ref&gt; Owners must have appropriate permits and licenses from the city in order to open the rink.&lt;ref&gt;[http://smallbusiness.chron.com/start-roller-skating-rink-12726.html Chron]&lt;/ref&gt; Owners must also obtain appropriate insurance in order to protect themselves in case of injury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rollerskatingrinkinsurance.com Roller Skating Rink Insurance]&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://www.rollerskating.org National Roller Skating Association] suggests that a rink be placed in a densely populated commercial area. The cost of opening a rink can vary but the average price to start a rink is usually around $1,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rsa.web-pros.com/assets/files/faq.pdf Roller Skating Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

The RSA International suggest that the breakdown of income&lt;ref&gt;http://rsa.web-pros.com/assets/files/faq.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; is as follows:
*Admission 45% 
*Skate Rental 20% 
*Snack Bar 14% 
*Pro Shop 10% 
*Games/Redemption 6% 
*Miscellaneous 5%

'''Santa Ana Star Center''' is a 7,000-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Rio Rancho, New Mexico|Rio Rancho]], [[New Mexico]], a suburb of [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]]. The arena is located near the intersection of Unser Boulevard and Paseo del Volcan. It is part of a larger "City Centre" project, which also includes a new [[City and town halls|city hall]].

[[Santa Ana Star Casino]] purchased the naming rights to the arena in a five-year, $2.5 million deal signed in July 2006.{{ref|naming}} The arena was previously known as '''Rio Rancho Events Center'''.

The arena was completed at a cost of $47 million [[USD]] and opened on October 21, 2006.{{ref|star}} The first sports event in the arena was a hockey game on October 27, 2006, with the [[New Mexico Scorpions]] falling to the [[Arizona Sundogs]] 3-1 in front of a sellout crowd.{{ref|scorpions}}

In April 2009, the city of Rio Rancho awarded Global Spectrum as the management company for the Santa Ana Star Center.

The arena was formerly home to the [[New Mexico Mustangs]] of the [[North American Hockey League]], the [[New Mexico Scorpions]] of the [[Central Hockey League]], the [[New Mexico Stars]] of the [[Indoor Football League]]/[[Lone Star Football League]], the [[New Mexico Wildcats]] of the [[American Indoor Football Association]], [[New Mexico Thunderbirds]], of the [[NBA Development League]], and a venue for [[World Wrestling Entertainment]].

The arena has been controversial since its construction, given its light attendance and its failure to turn a profit, despite the claims of Global Entertainment, the company hired to build and manage the arena, prior to the arena's development.  As of 2011, the City of Rio Rancho expected to pay $3.6 million in 2011 to keep the arena running and to pay for its bonds, nearly 7% of the city’s $53.8 million budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/17/sports/a-companys-small-town-arenas-leave-cities-with-big-problems.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Company’s Arenas Leave Cities With Big Problems |publisher=The New York Times |date=2011-05-16 |accessdate=2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sam Bregman, owner of the former New Mexico Thunderbirds, stated that he believed the venue was not a good fit for his team, saying "The Rio Rancho arena is beautiful, but it’s a long way out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.koat.com/news/28478948/detail.html |title=Thunderbirds To Leave NM After Being Sold |publisher=KOAT-TV |date=2011-07-07 |accessdate=2011-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''ski binding''' is a device that connects a [[ski boot]] to the [[ski]]. Generally, it holds the boot firmly to allow the skier to maneuver the ski.  However, if certain force limits are exceeded, it releases the boot to minimize skier injury, such as in the case of a fall or impact.  There are different types of bindings for different types of [[skiing]].

== Alpine ==
[[Image:Alpine ski bindings 01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Alpine ski bindings: for inbounds resort skiing, alpine touring and for toolfree length adjustment (from top to bottom)]]
[[Image:Skistopperopen.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Snow brake in open position]]
Modern [[alpine skiing]] bindings fix the boot at the toe and heel.

In some bindings, to reduce injury the boot can release in case of a fall. The boot is released by the binding if a certain amount of [[torque]] is applied, usually created by the weight of a falling skier. The torque required is adjustable, according to the weight, foot size, and skiing style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dinsetting.com |title=DIN Setting Calculator |publisher=DINSetting.com |accessdate=20 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A snow brake prevents the ski from moving while it is not attached to a boot.

Also known as randonee, an [[alpine touring binding]] allows the heel to be clipped down to the ski when skiing downhill, but allows it to be released when climbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ki Bindings - Components and Functions|url=http://www.abc-of-skiing.com/whatareskibindings.asp|website=ABC of skiing|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alpine touring===
An alpine touring binding allows the skier to have the heel of the ski boot free and the toe of the ski boot in the binding when using Nordic skiing techniques for [[ski touring]], and to have both the heel and the toe of the ski boot in the binding when using [[alpine skiing]] techniques to descend the mountain. Most touring bindings are designed for ski boots falling under one of two ISO specifications:  
* [http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=38623 ISO 5355:2005], for traditional [[Ski boots#Alpine|alpine boots]]. In this variation the pivot is located in the front of the binding. 
* [http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=45842 ISO 9523:2008], for boots in which the pivot is formed at the boot / binding interface. 
The two setups are mutually incompatible: in the former, the boot lacks sockets to engage ISO 9523 compatible bindings, while the later boot toe and heel-piece dimensions are incompatible with ISO 5355 bindings.

==Nordic==

===Cable binding===
{{main|Cable binding}}
The cable binding was widely used through the middle of the 20th century. It has the toe section of the boot anchored, and an adjustable cable around the heel secures the boot. While binding designs vary, before 2007 almost all dedicated Telemark models had been designed to fit boots with 75mm ''Nordic Norm'' "duckbill" toes.

===Rottefella (NN, Nordic Norm) ===
[[Image:NN-type Rottefella binding.jpg|thumb|Rottefella 75 mm Nordic Norm (NN)]]
The Rottefella binding was developed in 1927 by [[Bror With]]. The name means "rat trap" in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]. It is also known as the 75&amp;nbsp;mm, Nordic Norm, or 3-pin. After victories at the [[1928 Winter Olympics]] in [[St. Moritz]], the binding remained the standard for [[cross-country skiing (sport)|cross-country skiing]] for the next 60 years. They are no longer as popular as they were but are still for sale. The binding has three small pins that stick up from the binding. The toe of the boot has three holes into which the pins are inserted. The boot is then clamped down by a bail. The binding is asymmetrical, having left and right foot orientations. Prior to the Nordic Norm, cross-country ski bindings had as many as four pins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KicPH9IN4rAC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=four-pin+ski+binding&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiz0dPbsNXZAhUEH6wKHc-yB88Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=four-pin%20ski%20binding&amp;f=false|title=Skiing|last=Grout|first=William|date=October 1974|publisher=Ziff-Davis|year=|isbn=|volume=27|location=New York|pages=36|language=en|issn=0037-6264|number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NNN (New Nordic Norm) ===
[[File:NNN-Binding.JPG|thumb|The NNN binding has two ridges extending backwards from the toe latch, matching corresponding channels in the boot.]]
[[Rottefella]]'s NNN (New Nordic Norm) has a bar in the toe of the boot hooked into a corresponding latch in the binding. There have been several versions of NNN, and the first NNN version is not compatible with current designs. A stronger BC (Back Country) version also exists.

=== NIS (Nordic Integrated System)===
NIS (Nordic Integrated System), introduced in 2005 by [[Skis Rossignol|Rossignol]], [[Madshus]], [[Rottefella]], and [[Alpina Žiri|Alpina]],&lt;ref&gt;Mike Muha, [http://www.nordicskiracer.com/Equipment/2005/NIS/NIS.asp "Nordic Integrated System "], Nordic Ski Racer, 26 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt; is fully compatible with NNN boots and bindings, but is a different way of attaching the bindings to the ski.&lt;ref name=rei&gt;{{cite web|title=Cross-Country Ski Gear: How to Choose|url=http://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/crosscountry-ski-touring-gear.html|publisher=REI|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features an integrated binding plate on the top of the ski to which the bindings attach, allowing adjustment in the field with a metallic NIS key. The initial design of the plate used a movable insert for position adjustment. NIS skis allow installation of non-NIS bindings. In 2007, [[Fischer Skis|Fischer]] abandoned SNS and entirely switched to NIS. 

Rottefella Xcelerator bindings provide an increased power transfer from ski boots with a matching Xcelerator pattern sole. Xcelerator SSR bindings include QuickLock mechanism for tool-less position adjustment.

===SNS (Salomon Nordic System) ===
[[File:SNS Profil-Bindung.JPG|thumb|The SNS Profil binding has one large, central ridge, extending backwards from the toe latch, and one metal bar on the boot.]]
[[File:SNS Pilot-Binding.JPG|thumb|The SNS Pilot binding has same central ridge as the SNS Profil, but has two bars on the boot for better stabilization.]]
SNS ([[Salomon Group|Salomon]] Nordic System) looks very similar to NNN, except it has one large ridge and the bar is narrower. Three variants exist:
* SNS Profil: One metal bar in the toe of the boot.
* SNS Pilot: Two metal bars on the boot.
* SNS X-Adventure: Stronger design used for back-country skiing (also referred to as SNS-BC).
Pilot boots cannot be used with a Profil binding but Profil boots can be used with Pilot bindings.  The original Pilot boots had the front pin 10 mm from the front of the boot (RS10), while the newer Pilot boots have the front pin 17 mm from the front of the boot (RS17).  SNS is marketed by [[Amer Sports]] under their Salomon and [[Atomic Skis|Atomic]] brands.

The predecessor was simply called Salomon Nordic System (SNS): 
* SNS: "U-shaped" metal bar protruding from the front of the boot

===Prolink (Salomon NNN-compatible system) ===
The Rotefella NNN system was adopted by Fischer and their various brands, making SNS decline in use in North America. In response to the need for NNN compatibility, in 2016 Salomon introduced the Prolink system, although Salomon claims that SNS will still be produced and available. The Prolink binding is somewhat lighter than NNN and mounts directly to the ski using pre-drilled holes, as opposed to a built-in ski-mounted NIS or IFP plate used by NNN . Salomon claims their new system delivers a superior “snow feel” as compared to NNN or even their own SNS system which pairs with thicker soled boots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fasterskier.com/fsarticle/salomon-to-join-nnn-club-slated-to-reveal-new-boots-and-bindings-option-on-jan-1/|title=Salomon to Join NNN Club, Slated to Reveal New Boots-and-Bindings Option on Jan. 1|last=Albert|first=Jason|date=December 31, 2015|website=Faster Skier|access-date=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NTN (New Telemark Norm)===
In 2007, Rottefella introduced the New Telemark Norm binding. The system's objective is to provide a freeheel telemark ski binding featuring lateral release, increased lateral rigidity, tunable performance, and free-pivot touring functionality.  The boots are unlike other tele boots in that they do not have a 75&amp;nbsp;mm square toe and require a lip underneath the arch of the boot for the binding to attach.  Scarpa sells a version of the boot which is compatible with NTN Tele and Dynafit bindings. Rottefella currently (2015) offers two models of the binding, the Freeride for the lift assisted skier and the Freedom for the tourer.  Both models feature a free pivot and one boot standard, NTN.  Different spring cartridges can be used to match the binding to the skier's weight and skiing style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Telemark Norm (NTN)|url=http://www.newtelemarkguide.com/wiki/New_Telemark_Norm|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IFP (Turnamic) ===
In 2016, Fischer and Rossignol introduced a new IFP binding plate which allows tool-less adjustment of binding position. The Turnamic binding uses step-in locking for the boot, and the lock closes or opens by turning the lever to the side. 

The IFP Turnamic bindings can be used with all NNN/Prolink boots, but the IFP plate will not accept NIS 1.0 bindings because of the new lock mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;https://skihaussteamboat.com/turnamic-xcelerator-prolink-nnn-what-a-nordic-guide-to-xc-boots-and-bindings/&lt;/ref&gt;

Rottefella subsequently introduced continuously adjustable MOVE Switch bindings which can be installed in the IFP (and NIS) plates.&lt;ref name=Rottefella-MOVE/&gt;

=== NIS 2.0 (MOVE)===
In 2018, Rottefella and [[Madshus]] announced the NIS 2.0 plate with the MOVE bindings which allow continuous on-the-fly adjustment of binding position with the boot locked-in. The NIS 2.0 plate and the MOVE Switch turnable wheel are designed to accept any existing NIS/NNN binding, using either fixed inserts or adjustable sliding inserts. MOVE Electric remote adjustment is being developed for 2019-2020 season.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.ultratune.net/2018/01/skiing-201819-madshus-redline.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=Madshus-Redline-IGC&gt;https://news.madshus.com/2017/10/11/optimizing-the-skin-ski/&lt;/ref&gt; Rottefella also provides MOVE Switch conversion kits for NIS 1.0, IFP, and Prolink skis. &lt;ref name=Rottefella-MOVE&gt;https://www.bouldernordic.com/news/1084&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=MOVE-Switch&gt;https://www.rottefella.com/move-system&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of continuously adjustable bindings has been approved by the [[International Ski Federation|FIS]]; such adjustment allows the skier to fine-tune ski grip and glide, which is important for classic style racing on skis with waxless "mohair" grip-zones.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.madshus.com/2018/02/19/inside-the-factory-skin-skis-are-coming-to-the-world-cup/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Madshus-Redline-IGC/&gt; Previous Rottefella NNN bindings required the skier to dismount then apply significant force to a small metal NIS key to unlatch the binding.

==History==
[[File:Old ski binding.jpg|thumb|Old ski binding]]
In the early days of skiing, the binding was similar to those used on snowshoes: a leather strap fastened over the toe of the boot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lert|first1=Wolfgang|title=A Binding Revolution|journal=Skiing Heritage Journal|date=March 2002|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Timeline'''
* 1840s: [[Sondre Norheim]] demonstrated [[Telemark skiing]] before 1866, and the Open Christiania in 1868, both made possible with a binding design (which dated back to the late 1840s). This added a loop of twisted birch roots that ran from the existing birch root toe loops around the boot heels and back. This allowed the heel to lift as before, for walking and gliding, but better held the boots to the skis allowing greater control. This enabled Norheim to control the skis with his feet and legs, replacing the former technique of dragging a large pole in the snow on one side or the other to drag the skier in that direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lert|first=Wolfgang|title=A Binding Revolution|journal=Skiing Heritage Journal|date=March 2002|pages=25–26|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=wlgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These new techniques spread throughout [[Telemark]] and would later be named for the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lund|first=Morten|title=Norway: How It All Started|journal=Skiing Heritage Journal|date=September 2007|pages=8–13|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=SlgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1894: [[Fritz R. Huitfeldt]] invented a binding with a secure toe iron which allowed the heel to move freely. This became the standard industry binding through the 1930s. Huitfeldt drove the evolution of the ski binding over the next 20 years. In 1894, he introduced the use of semi-circular metal hooks at the toe to attach the straps. The hooks were positioned to tightly fit to the sides of the boot, keeping the ski centred and eliminating any "flop" that the formerly loose straps allowed. The heel strap was also attached to the same hooks, but because of their rounded shape, the required range of motion was provided by the straps sliding up and down on the hooks. This allowed the heel strap to be replaced by a less flexible leather strap. Together, these changes dramatically tightened the binding, greatly increasing control.&lt;ref name=lert25&gt;Lert, pg. 25&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1897: Huitfeldt further improved the design by changing the toe piece. Instead of hooks, he drilled a rectangular hole through the ski from side to side, and passed an iron bar through it. The bar was then bent up on either side, locking it in place, and then formed to fit the toe of the boot. This improvement once again dramatically improved the firmness of the fit. Finally, in 1904 he adopted the Hoyer-Ellefsen toggle, a lever that replaced the buckles.&lt;ref name=lert26&gt;Lert, pg. 26&lt;/ref&gt; This not only greatly improved mechanical advantage, further improving the strength of the binding, but also made the system much easier to put on and remove. Better yet, the geometry of the attachment points meant the heel strap was mechanically attached below that of the toe strap, which provided a constant "diagonal downpull" that naturally returned the heel to the ski.
* 1920: Huitfeldt style bindings were by far the most popular system for decades, with the only major change being Marius Eriksen's 1920 introduction of pre-formed plates that were screwed on top of the ski.&lt;ref name=lert26/&gt; Other binding systems did exist, in particular a class of bindings originally introduced by [[Mathias Zdarsky]] that replaced the heel strap with a long metal plate under the sole of the boot, hinged at the front to allow the heel to rise. The heel was held to the plate by a short strap attaching at the back.&lt;ref&gt;John Allen,  [https://books.google.ca/books?id=VVgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA12 "Mathias Zdarsky: The Father of Alpine Skiing"], ''Ski Heritage'', March 2008, pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt; These gave even better control than the Huitfeldt design, but so firmly attached the leg that injury was a real problem.
* 1927: Change eventually came though the evolution of the [[Rottefella]] binding, first introduced in 1927. The original Rottefella eliminated the heel strap, which held the boot forward in the binding, by drilling small holes in the sole of the boot which fit into pins in the toe piece. This would only work if the sole was held very firmly down on the pins, so the binding also introduced a metal clip that was forced down onto the top of the sole of the boot, forcing it onto the pins. When the inventor, Bror With, won a race on the new design, Norwegian Crown Prince Olav ask him what they were, and he responded "Oh, they're just a couple of rat traps I picked up at the hardware store".&lt;ref name=rot&gt;[http://www.rottefella.no/en/Our-history/ "About Us"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906104003/http://www.rottefella.no/en/Our-history/ |date=2015-09-06 }}, Rottefella&lt;/ref&gt; "Rottefella" is Norwegian for "rat trap".
* 1929: The introduction of the cable binding allowed the [[Stem Christie|Christie turn]] to become a standard on downhill runs, and to further support this style of skiing the Swiss racer Guido Reuge in 1929 invented a cable binding with steel clips below the boot heel to enable clamping the heel down for downhill portions. He named the product "Kandahar" for the international Kandahar Cup ski races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huntsford|first=Roland|title=Two Planks and a Passion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IY7hYFesJe0C&amp;pg=PA286&amp;lpg=PA286&amp;dq=kandahar+binding+reuge&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sCTF3xB-G9&amp;sig=dTKNZr6PTwawR9MOatm2NXj31sI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3PSbUtbzO8WdyQHIpYGgCA&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=kandahar%20binding%20reuge&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In use in alpine races, the Kandahar binding led to serious leg injuries, and by 1939 experimentation began in earnest on bindings that would release the boot in a fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Masia|first=Seth|title=Release! History of Safety Bindings|url=http://skiinghistory.org/history/release-history-safety-bindings|publisher=Skiing History magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1932: a major advance on the Huitfeldt concept was introduced to the market by Guido Reuge in 1932. Reuge replaced the heel strap with a metal cable connected to a spring at the front of the toe. The spring provided even tension as the boot moved. Previously, the strap was adjusted so it had enough slack to allow the boot to rotate as high as the skier wished, but as the boot rotated back down to the ski it became increasingly slack again. The cable removed this limitation, and held the boot firmly through its entire motion, greatly increasing the solidity of the fit. A later advance added two small metal clips near the rear of the foot that the cable could be clipped under. These held the boot firmly to the ski during downhill portions of the runs. Cable bindings remained in use for some time for cross-country, and are today popular for telemark skiing. However, the [[Rottefella]] design from the 1930s became more popular for Nordic skiing through the 1950s and into the 1970s until the [[Salomon Nordic System]] (SNS) binding entirely re-invented bindings used for Nordic skiing.
* 1937: [[Hjalmar Hvam]] broke his leg skiing, and while recuperating from surgery, invented the Saf-Ski toe binding. This was a metal clip with a pyramidal top that fit into a slot cut into the sole of the ski boot. When the boot was rotated forward, the slot on the toe eventually rose above the metal pyramid, allowing the toe to release from the ski. The system was considered with suspicion by professional skiers, especially when Olaf Rodegaard released during a race. However, Rodegaard credits the release with saving him from a broken leg.&lt;ref name=m27&gt;Masia, pg. 27&lt;/ref&gt; In the post-war era, Hvam sold several thousand pairs of Saf-Ski's, in an era when alpine skiing was in its infancy. Hvam continued to sell the Saf-Ski into the 1960s, but in 1966 his insurance rates increased so dramatically that he was forced from the market.&lt;ref name=m30&gt;Masia, pg. 30&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1950: A dramatic advance in alpine ski bindings was introduced as the [[Look Nevada]] in 1950. The Nevada held the toe centred over the ski using two metal fingers shaped into an upside-down V. The fingers were pivoted to allow motion to the sides, and centred with a spring. During a fall, sideways torsion could overcome the force of the spring and allow the boot to release directly to the side. This design was quickly copied by other vendors, notably Marker, and had the first real impact on the dominance of the fixed-toe bindings. By the late 1950s, there were about 35 different release toe bindings on the US market,&lt;ref name=m29&gt;Masia, pg. 29&lt;/ref&gt; most of which used a normal Kandahar-style heel cable.
[[File:NN-type Rottefella binding.jpg|thumb|right|A typical Rottefella cross-country binding. The ski boot has small holes that fit over the pins seen on the bottom of the plate, keeping the boot from sliding rearward. The metal bar clamps the toe down onto the pins, and can be released by pressing down on the plastic clip with a ski pole.]]
* 1960: The first modern heel-and-toe binding for alpine skiing was the Cubco binding, first introduced in 1950 but not popular until about 1960. A heel-release binding faced the problem that there was no obvious place to attach to on the heel, so the Cubco solved this by screwing small metal clips into the sole of the boot. This also eliminated the changes in performance as the sole of the boot wore down, or the geometry of the sole changed as the boot wore into the skiers foot.&lt;ref name=m29/&gt; Marker introduced the Rotomat, which gripped onto the sole where it extended past the heel, and Look quickly followed suit with their Grand Prix design. By the mid-1960s, release bindings that worked on both the heel and the toe were common, and by the late 1960s, the cable binding had disappeared from alpine skiing.
* 1966: The introduction of plastic ski boots permitted the development of industrial standards for the function of alpine skiing bindings. 
* 1972: Injury rates from alpine skiing began to fall with the gradual introduction of the Teflon anti-friction pad around 1972.
[[File:Huitfeldt-bindingen.JPG|thumb|right|A late model Huitfeldt-style binding. The toe clip runs through the core of the ski to bend up on either side. This model uses a metal heel strap with a lever buckle instead of an all-leather design.]]
* 1970s:
**Alpine: One problem with 1960s release bindings was that the boots were not standardized, and a binding that worked well on one boot might be dangerous on another, or might become dangerous over time as the boot shifted about. This led to the introduction of plate bindings, which used a metal plate firmly clipped to the sole of the boot, and bindings that clamped onto the plate. The plate could be easily removed for walking about. Plate bindings were popular in the US in the 1970s, notably the [[BURT Retractable Bindings]] and [[Spademan binding]], but never caught on in any major way in Europe. As more and more of the alpine skiing market came under control of European companies, the plate bindings disappeared, in spite of their excellent safety records.&lt;ref&gt;Seth Masia, [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1gEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA39 "The Better Mousetrap"], ''Ski Heritage'', March 2003, pg 39-41&lt;/ref&gt; The disappearance of the plate and alternate systems was due to a combination of factors, notably the introduction of standardized hard plastic boots. Plastic was first introduced by [[Lange (ski boots)|Lange]] as a way of improving existing leather designs. As the new material spread through the industry, the sole piece was standardized to allow toe-and-heel bindings to clip on. Plastic had the advantages of being much firmer than leather, not changing shape over time, and having predictable friction characteristics wet or dry. Although plate bindings of the era had much better safety records, notably the Spademan design, the new boots and bindings could be easily adapted to any ski for any skier.
** Nordic: Problems with the geometry of the boot sole, which meant only certain boots would work, meant the Rottafella was not widely used. This problem was eventually solved through the same evolution of plastic components that changed the alpine skiing market. The use of highly flexible plastics allowed for a sole that was very strong torsionally and side-to-side, but still had excellent flexibility lengthwise, allowing the heel to rise as with a cable binding. This was standardized as the 3-pin system, which was widespread by the 1970s.&lt;ref name=rot/&gt; A similar system with a 50&amp;nbsp;mm "duckbill" once existed for lighter setups, but is obsolete and no longer available. Unlike the 75&amp;nbsp;mm it was symmetric. It was the binding of choice for racing, before the adoption of skate ski racing, in the early 1970s. The 50&amp;nbsp;mm was also designated according to the thickness of the "duckbill" having either 7&amp;nbsp;mm or 11–13&amp;nbsp;mm thick soles hence these bindings often had two notches in the bail to clamp boots with different sole thicknesses.

'''South Yorkshire Sports Stadium''' was a [[Greyhound racing in the United Kingdom|greyhound racing]] and [[Motorcycle speedway|speedway]] stadium on Station Road in [[Wombwell]], near [[Barnsley]], [[South Yorkshire]]. It was one of two greyhound tracks in the town; the other was called the [[Wombwell Greyhound Stadium]].

==Origins==
The South Yorkshire Sports Stadium was constructed north of Station Road, south of Bulling Dike and accessed on a small road called Kent Row at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.old-maps.co.uk/#/Map/440374/403516/12/101162|title=OS County Series Yorkshire 1931|publisher=old-maps.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Opening==
It opened unofficially on Saturday 17 April 1928 with 3,000 spectators raising £15 (the nights entrance fees) for local charities. One week later on Saturday 21 April 1928 the stadium officially opened charging 1/-, 2/- or 3/- for the relevant enclosures.&lt;ref name=DM&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Julia|title=Daily Mirror Greyhound Fact File|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-15-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speedway followed in 1929.

==History==
The greyhound racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the [[National Greyhound Racing Club]]) and was known as a flapping track which was the nickname given to independent tracks. The track was a popular venue with [[Tote board|totalisator turnover]] peaking in 1946 at £64,255.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Particulars of Licensed tracks, table 1 Licensed Dog Racecourses|year=1946|publisher=Licensing Authorities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The greyhound racing finished during May 1956.&lt;ref name=DM/&gt;

==Speedway==
Speedway was held sporadically from 1929-1965; the team were known as the [[Wombwell Colliers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defunctspeedway.co.uk/wombwell.htm|title=Wombwell Speedway|publisher=Defunct Speedway Tracks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium was demolished and later became the Valley Road industrial area.

[[File:Torneos y Competencias TyC sede Monserrat.jpg|thumb|Head office]]
'''Torneos y Competencias S.A.''' ('''TyC''', also referred as '''Torneos''') is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] sports communications firm created by businessman Carlos Ávila, who has left the company. It is an important force in the world of Argentine sports, with interests in publications and radio and TV broadcasting. Its headquarters are in [[Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tyc.com.ar/corp/contacto.asp|title=Nuestras Oficinas se encuentran ubicadas en Balcarce 510, Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentina|publisher=Tyc.com|accessdate=25 November 2014|language=es|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101002847/http://www.tyc.com.ar/corp/contacto.asp|archivedate=1 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Torneos started its activities in the Argentine media in 1982, with a [[golf]] program. Since then it produced and aired successful programs in network television such as ''El deporte y el hombre'', ''Tenis de Primera'', ''[[Football (soccer)|Fútbol]] de Primera'' and ''La Magia de la [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]''; the most successful of them being the weekly ''Fútbol de Primera'', which summarizes each day of competition in the [[Primera División Argentina|Argentine first division]]. &lt;!-- [[Fox Soccer Channel]] in the [[United States]] airs ''Fútbol de Primera'' with [[English language|English]] voiceovers by its own announcers. --&gt;

In 1994, Torneos launched the channel [[TyC Sports]] to broadcast the [[Argentine Primera Division]].

===Removal of first division television rights===
In 1992, the company Televisión Satelital Codificada (TSC, a [[joint venture]] between TyC and the [[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]] group) signed an agreement with the [[Argentine Football Association]] (AFA) for the broadcasters exclusive live of Argentine [[Association football|football]] matches. All the official matches were available on the '''TyC Sports''' and '''TyC Max''' cable &amp; satellite channels. This agreement will expire in 2014.

In July 2009, due to an economic crisis that affected several [[Primera División Argentina|Primera División]] clubs, the AFA tried new ways of financing. The President of the AFA, [[Julio Grondona]], requested TSC authorities to modify the contract for television rights in order for the AFA to receive 720 million [[Argentine peso]]s. However, in the last season, TSC paid the AFA 230 million pesos, and the request was rejected by TSC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ole.clarin.com/notas/2009/08/04/futbollocal/01971526.html|title=Mirando otro canal|publisher=Ole.clarin.com|accessdate=25 November 2014|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Grondona received an offer from the Argentine government in order for the National System of Public Media &amp;ndash; the state-owned [[Channel 7 (Argentina)|Channel 7]] &amp;ndash; to replace TSC for broadcasting the games on TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.losandes.com.ar/notas/2009/8/9/un-439587.asp|title=TyC denunci que hay un acuerdo para estatizar la televisacin del ftbol|author=Diario Los Andes|publisher=Losandes.com.ar|accessdate=25 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219191928/http://www.losandes.com.ar/notas/2009/8/9/un-439587.asp|archivedate=19 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]]'s government has a public confrontation against the Clarín group, a member of TSC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/cultura_sociedad/2009/08/090811_argentina_futbol_grondona_rompe_gm.shtml|title=BBC Mundo - Cultura y Sociedad - El fútbol argentino cambia de canal|publisher=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=25 November 2014|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 11, 2009, the AFA broke the contract with TSC, accusing it of not fulfilling the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elargentino.com/nota-53419-La-AFA-rompio-el-contrato-con-TSC-y-reabre-el-juego-de-la-TV.html|title=INFOnews - El Argentino CABA - Un mundo, muchas voces|publisher=Elargentino.com|accessdate=25 November 2014|language=es|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002727/http://www.elargentino.com/nota-53419-La-AFA-rompio-el-contrato-con-TSC-y-reabre-el-juego-de-la-TV.html|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the AFA sued TSC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perfil.com/contenidos/2009/08/14/noticia_0011.html|title=La AFA "entablará una demanda millonaria" contra TSC|work=Perfil.com|accessdate=25 November 2014|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; but TyC also tried an unsuccessful lawsuit against the AFA for cancelling the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educacion.terra.com.ar/canales/politica/205/205014.html|title=Terra - La Justicia rechaz presentacin de TSC contra la AFA y habr ftbol&gt; 14-8-2009 - Actualidad|publisher=Educacion.terra.com.ar|accessdate=25 November 2014|language=es|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303212301/http://www.educacion.terra.com.ar/canales/politica/205/205014.html|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
