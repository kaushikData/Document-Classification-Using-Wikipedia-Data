The '''Academy of Persian Language and Literature''' (acronym: APLL) ({{lang-fa|فرهنگستان زبان و ادب فارسی}}) is the official [[List of language regulators|regulatory body]] of the [[Persian language]], headquartered in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]]. Formerly known as the '''Academy of Iran''' ({{lang|fa|فرهنگستان ایران}}), it was founded on May 20, 1935 by the initiative of [[Reza Shah Pahlavi]], a former monarch of the country.

The academy acts as the official authority on the language, and contributes to linguistic research on Persian and other [[languages of Iran]].

==History==
===Early efforts===
The first official attentions to the necessity of protecting the Persian language against foreign words, and to the standardization of [[Persian alphabet|Persian orthography]], were under the reign of [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar|Naser ed Din Shah]] of the [[Qajar dynasty]] in 1871.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} After Naser ed Din Shah, [[Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar|Mozaffar ed Din Shah]] ordered the establishment of the first Persian association in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Farhangestan|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/farhangestan|website=Encyclopaedia Iranica|publisher=Encyclopaedia Iranica|accessdate=3 October 2014|ref=Farghanestan}}&lt;/ref&gt; This association officially declared that it used Persian and [[Arabic]] as acceptable sources for coining words. The ultimate goal was to prevent books from being printed with wrong use of words. According to the executive guarantee of this association, the government was responsible for wrongfully-printed books. Words coined by this association, such as ''rāh-āhan'' ({{lang|fa|راه‌آهن}}) for "railway", were printed in ''Soltani Newspaper''; but the association was eventually closed due to inattention.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

A scientific association was founded in 1911, resulting in a dictionary called ''Words of Scientific Association'' ({{lang|fa|لغت انجمن علمی}}), which was completed in the future and renamed ''Katouzian Dictionary'' ({{lang|fa|فرهنگ کاتوزیان}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=برنامه‌ریزی زبان فارسی|publisher=روایت فتح|ISBN=978-600-6128-05-4|author=نگار داوری اردکانی|page=33|year=1389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Establishment of the academy===
The first academy for the Persian language was founded in May 20, 1935, under the name ''Academy of Iran''. It was established by the initiative of [[Reza Shah]], and mainly by [[Hekmat E Shirazi|Hekmat e Shirazi]] and [[Mohammad Ali Foroughi]], all prominent names in the nationalist movement of the time.

[[Ferdowsi]], in fact, was a motivation behind Reza Shah's decision to remove the foreign loanwords from Persian, replacing them with Persian equivalents. In 1934, Reza Shah ordered to rebuild [[Tomb of Ferdowsi|Ferdowsi's tomb]] and set up a country-wide ceremony in honor of a thousand years of [[Persian literature]] since the time of Ferdowsi, titled ''[[Ferdowsi Millenary Celebration]]'', inviting notable Iranian and foreign scholars.

The members of the academy included a number of notable literary figures and highly-celebrated scholars upon its foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/arts/story/2006/05/060517_jb_culture-academy.shtml |title=71st anniversary of the Academy of Persian Language and Literature |publisher=BBC Persian}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Abbas Eqbal Ashtiani]], [[Mohammad-Taqi Bahar]], [[Ali-Akbar Dehkhoda]], [[Mohammad Ali Foroughi]], [[Badiozzaman Forouzanfar]], Homayun Forouzanfar, Qasem Ghani, Abdolazim Gharib, [[Mohammad Ghazvini]], [[Mohammad Hejazi (author)|Mohammad Hejazi]], [[Hekmat E Shirazi|Ali-Asghar Hekmat]], [[Mahmoud Hessabi]], [[Mohammad-Ali Jamalzadeh]], [[Ahmad Matin-Daftari]], [[Saeed Nafisi]], [[Ebrahim Pourdavoud]], Isa Sadiq, [[Zabihollah Safa]], [[Ali Akbar Siassi]], and [[Gholamreza Rashid-Yasemi|Rashid Yasemi]].

Some foreign scholars were also involved, such as Arthur Christensen (from [[Denmark]]), [[Muhammad Husayn Haykal]] (from [[Egypt]]), Abduqodir Maniyozov (from [[Tajikistan]]), Henry Masset (from [[France]]), Raf'at Pasha (from Egypt), [[Jan Rypka]] (from [[Czechoslovakia]]), Dodikhudo Saymiddinov (from Tajikistan), and [[Muhammadjon Shakuri]] (from Tajikistan).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The academy was a key institution in the struggle to re-build Iran as a nation-state after the collapse of the Qajar dynasty. During the 1930s and 1940s, the academy led massive campaigns to replace the many [[Arabic]], [[French language|French]], and [[Greek language|Greek]] loanwords whose immense use in Persian during the centuries preceding the foundation of the Pahlavi dynasty had created a literary language considerably different from the spoken Persian of the time.

==Functions==
The academy strives to protect the integrity of the Persian language. It heads the academic efforts for linguistic research on the Persian language and its sister Iranian languages. It has also created an official orthography of Persian.

The attention of the academy has also been towards the persistent infiltration of Persian, like many other languages, with foreign words, as a result of the globalization process. The academy constantly campaigns for the use of Persian equivalents of new loanwords. If no equivalents exist, it has the task of linguistically deriving such words from existing Persian roots, and actively promoting the adoption of these new coinages in the daily lives. The Iranian law requires those equivalents to be used in the official media, governmental affairs, and product management of all companies.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==Membership==
The academy members are selected from masters of [[Persian literature]] and [[linguistics]]. Since the 1979 Revolution, the academy's presidents have been [[Hassan Habibi]], who died due to heart failure in January 2013, and the current president, [[Gholam Ali Haddad-Adel]].

The following is a list of both living and deceased permanent members of the academy since the 1979 Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.persianacademy.ir/fa/association.aspx|title=فرهنگستان زبان و ادب فارسی|publisher=Persian Academy|accessdate=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Announcement of the Academy about the name of the Persian language in foreign languages==
On November 19, 2005, the Academy of the Persian Language and Literature delivered a pronouncement on the name of the Persian language, rejecting any use of the word ''Farsi'' (instead of English ''Persian'', German ''Persisch'', Spanish ''persa'', French ''persan'', etc.) in foreign languages.

The announcement reads:
# ''Persian'' has been used in a variety of publications including cultural, scientific, and diplomatic documents for centuries and, therefore, it carries a very significant historical and cultural meaning. Hence, changing ''Persian'' to ''Farsi'' would negate this established important precedent.
# Changing the usage from ''Persian'' to ''Farsi'' may give the impression that "Farsi" is a new language, although this may well be the intention of some users of ''Farsi''.
# Changing the usage may also give the impression that "Farsi" is a dialect used in some parts of Iran rather than the predominant (and official) language of the country.
# The word ''Farsi'' has never been used in any research paper or university document in any Western language, and the proposal to begin using it would create doubt and ambiguity about the name of the official language of Iran.

Supporting this announcement, gradually other institutions and literary figures separately took similar actions throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranian.com/Features/Dec97/Persian/ |title=Persian or Farsi? |publisher=Iranian|date=16 December 1997|accessdate=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.persiandirect.com/articles/2004/july/id_00003.htm |title=Fársi: 'Recently appeared language!'|publisher=Persiandirect|accessdate=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.persiandirect.com/articles/2004/july/id_00001.htm|title=Persian or Fársi?|publisher=Persiandirect|accessdate=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=متنِ اعلامِ نظرِ شورای فرهنگستانِ زبان و ادبِ فارسی درباره‌ی کاربردِ Farsi به جای Persian در مکاتباتِ وزارتِ امورِ خارجه|journal=The Quarterly Journal of the Academy of Persian Language and Literature|date=Spring 1995|volume=1|issue=1|page=152|url=http://www.persianacademy.ir/UserFiles/image/naame01.pdf|editor1-first=Aḥmad|editor1-last=Samī‘ī Gīlānī|location=Tehran|language=Persian|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, she received her doctorate in Education from [[Claremont Graduate University]].

==Early life==
At age three, her mother brought Darder to the mainland during the [[Operation Bootstrap]] post-war migration when more than 500,000 Puerto Ricans emigrated
&lt;ref&gt;''Puerto Rican Emigration: Why the 1950s?'' http://lcw.lehman.edu/lehman/depts/latinampuertorican/latinoweb/PuertoRico/1950s.htm&lt;/ref&gt; to the United States between 1949-1959.

Raised in poverty in East [[Los Angeles]], she was a young mother with three children, when she began her studies at [[Pasadena City College]] in 1972. While at PCC, Darder began exploring the realm of cultural differences in U.S. society, as a bilingual peer counselor. Upon completing nursing school, she worked as a pediatric nurse in a hospital and then for the [[Head Start Program]]. Her work included developing programs for parents, and providing health education for children and their families. She attended [[California State University Los Angeles]] and then [[Pacific Oaks College]], where she earned a master's degree in [[Human development (biology)|Human Development]] with a specialization in Marriage, Family and Child Counseling.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wiu.edu/ISCDA/speakers.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

While earning her degree, Darder worked in a variety of settings as a therapist and clinical supervisor for child abuse and domestic violence programs. During this time, she was active working with the [[Chicano Movement|Chicano/Latino movement]], focusing on issues of mental health and education in Spanish speaking communities.

From 1982 - 1986, Darder began teaching college seminars that focused on sociopolitical issues and questions of culture, human development, and parenting. In 1986, she joined the faculty at Pacific Oaks where she developed a graduate program in Bicultural Development that was discussed in her first book, ''Culture and Power in the Classroom''.
&lt;ref&gt;Darder, Antonia ''Culture and Power in the Classroom'' {{ISBN|0-89789-239-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the late 80's and early 90’s, Darder studied and worked with renowned Brazilian educator, [[Paulo Freire]], whose ideas profoundly influenced the direction of her life's work.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, Peter ''Critical Pedagogy Primer'' {{ISBN|0-8204-7262-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her book ''Reinventing Paulo Freire: A Pedagogy of Love''
&lt;ref&gt;Darder, Antonia ''Reinventing Paulo Freire: A Pedagogy of Love'' {{ISBN|0-8133-3968-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
focused on Freire’s important contributions to education, particularly from the standpoint of oppressed communities.

From 1993-1996, as a recipient of a [[W. K. Kellogg Foundation|Kellogg Foundation]] fellowship and participant in the Kellogg International Leadership Program,&lt;ref&gt;Kellogg Foundation (KILP) http://www.kfla.org/about/?p=ak&amp;c=29&lt;/ref&gt; her research took her to [[Peru]] where she studied the education and culture of indigenous children in the [[Andes]].

==Recent work==
Darder has taught at [[California Polytechnic State University|California Polytechnic University]], the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], and was recognized as a Distinguished Professor at [[New Mexico State University|New Mexico State University, Las Cruces]]. In 2005, working with graduate students and community members, she established the ''Liberacion! Radio Collective''&lt;ref&gt;Liberacion! Radio Collective, http://www.radioliberacion.org&lt;/ref&gt; a public affairs radio program, on [[WEFT|WEFT 90.1 Champaign]] that examines politics, art, and struggle through the nexus of local/global connections.&lt;ref&gt;WEFT Program Partners http://new.weft.org/partners&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Darder was recognized as Professor Emerita at the [[University of Illinois]], where she taught in the Department of Educational Policy Studies from 2003-2011.&lt;ref&gt;Dept of Educational Policy Studies http://education.illinois.edu/epol&lt;/ref&gt; Today she serves as Presidential Endowed Chair in Ethics and Moral Leadership in the School of Education at Loyola Marymount University.&lt;ref&gt;Dept of Education at Loyola Marymount University http://soe.lmu.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

Darder's work focuses on comparative studies of racism, political economy, education, and society. Her teaching and research examine issues of inequalities and the politics of social exclusions, as these relate to racism, class inequalities, and gendered relations of power. Her work also explores popular culture and the politics of public pedagogy with respect to critical democratic participation. Her most recent research examines the pervasiveness of oppression within the university, as well as issues directly tied to the body, pedagogy, and inequality.

==Honors and awards==

In addition to her recognition as a distinguished professor and endowed chair of ethics and moral leadership at Loyola Marymount, Darder has received numerous awards and honors for both her scholarly and community contributions. In 2016, she was awarded the [[Alpha Sigma Nu]] Outstanding Book of the Year award for the ''International Critical Pedagogy Reader'' co-edited with Peter Mayo &amp; João Paraskeva. In 2016, she was honored for her scholarship and community activism by CADRE, a parent community organization working with families in South Central Los Angeles.

Other honors have included the Eminent Scholar Award from Southern Queensland University, Toowoomba, Australia; a Thinker in Residence Distinguished Faculty Fellowship from Victoria University, Melbourne, Australia; and a Rains Award for Excellence in Research, Scholarship, and Creative Work. She has also been the recipient of a Distinguished International Research Fellow Award from New Castle University, Callaghan, Australia; and a Heroes Award from the Sisters of Saint Joseph for Reconciliation and Justice awarded to individuals who exemplify justice and reconciliation in their lives. Along with a national [[W. K. Kellogg Foundation|Kellogg Foundation]] Fellowship, she has also received the Social Justice in Education Award from the [[University of New Mexico]], an Outstanding Book of the Year honor from the [[American Educational Research Association]] for her book ''Reinventing Paulo Freire: A Pedagogy of Love'', and recognition for her Outstanding Service to the Latino Community from El Centro de Acción Social, among others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2983">In [[music]] of the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and early [[Baroque music|Baroque]] eras, a '''bicinium''' (pl. '''bicinia''') was a composition for only two parts, especially one for the purpose of teaching [[counterpoint]] or singing.

The term has had two usages in music history:

# Recently, the term has come to mean any composition at all from the Renaissance or early Baroque period for two vocal or instrumental parts.
# Historically, a bicinium referred specifically to a two-part composition used as a teaching tool, most often in [[Protestant]], [[German language|German]]-speaking areas.

The term was first used in [[Poland]], by [[Jan z Lublina]] in a treatise of 1540.  Volumes of bicinia were published in the next several decades in [[Germany]], the [[Low Countries]], and even in [[Italy]], as the usefulness of bicinia as teaching aids became apparent.  In addition, [[Martin Luther]] had strongly expressed that children should learn both music, and the [[psalm]]s: bicinia with German texts from the Psalms fulfilled his purpose.

Students could be expected to master singing a single part in a [[duet (music)|duet]] more easily than a part in a larger ensemble.  Usually a bicinium was designed to be sung or played by students of the same age and ability, rather than for a single student and a teacher.

This model of moving from two-part study, writing, and singing to three parts and then more was adopted by [[Heinrich Glarean]] in his ''Dodecachordon'' (1547), one of the most influential [[music theory]] and pedagogy treatises of the Renaissance.

In a similar manner, present-day music students typically learn [[counterpoint]] first by writing in two parts, and then later in three, only moving to four or more parts after mastering the earlier stages.

A similar pedagogical composition for three voices is known as a '''tricinium''' (pl. '''tricinia''').

[[file:Burston Strike School - geograph.org.uk - 346587.jpg|thumb|Burston Strike School]]
The '''Burston Strike School''' was founded as a consequence of a school strike and became the centre of the longest running strike in British history, that lasted from 1914 to 1939 in the village of [[Burston, Norfolk|Burston]] in Norfolk, England. Today, the building stands as a museum to the strike. Every year hundreds of people turn up for a rally to commemorate the 25-year strike over the jobs of [[Annie Higdon]] and her husband.

==History==
The strike began when teachers at the village's [[Church of England]] school, [[Annie Higdon]] and her husband, Tom Higdon, were [[Dismissal (employment)|sacked]] after a dispute with the area's school management committee. The schoolchildren – led by Violet Potter – went on strike in their support. Encouraged by the community, the Higdons went on to set up an alternative school which was initially attended by 66 of their 72 former pupils. Beginning in a marquee on the [[village green]], the school moved to a local carpenter's premises and later to a purpose-built school financed by donations from the labour movement. Burston Strike School carried on teaching local children until shortly after Tom's death in 1939.

==Background to the strike==
[[Annie Higdon|Annie Katherine Schollick (Kitty)]] married in 1896 Tom Higdon, the son of a farm labourer. They lived first in London before moving to [[Wood Dalling]] in Norfolk in 1902.&lt;ref name=annie&gt;Pamela Horn, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/48512 "Higdon , Annie Catharine [Kitty] (1864–1946)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, January 2008. Retrieved 27 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; This coincided with publication of an [[Education Act 1902|Education Bill]] in Parliament which offered education to working class children.

Kitty was appointed headmistress at [[Wood Dalling]] School with Tom an assistant teacher.&lt;ref name=annie/&gt; Identifying themselves with the local farm labourers, the Higdons ran up against almost immediate resentment from the school managers, who were mostly farmers. They objected to the cold, insanitary conditions of the school and especially protested at the farmers taking children away to work on the land whenever they were needed. Eventually, after a complete breakdown of relationships, the Norfolk Education Committee gave the Higdons a choice: accept dismissal or transfer to another school. They took up the latter offer and moved to the Burston School in 1911.&lt;ref name=annie/&gt;

Arriving at Burston, the Higdons found conditions were no different. The newly arrived [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]], the Reverend Charles Tucker Eland, was appointed chairman of the School Managing Body. Eland intended to recover the powers the Church had lost to the parish councils. He demanded deference and recognition of his right to lead the community. His situation, with an annual salary of £581 and a large comfortable rectory, contrasted starkly with the farm labourers and their families, living on average wages of £35 a year in squalid cottages. Their employers, themselves mostly tenants of brewery-owned land, naturally allied with the rector.

In 1913, after organising among the local agricultural labourers, Tom Higdon successfully stood for election to the parish council, topping the poll&lt;ref name=annie/&gt; with Eland failing to be elected, against his expectation. However, although the rector and the farm owners had been defeated in the parish council election, they still had control of the school's managing body and were determined to use this power to victimise the Higdons. Since their arrival in Burston, the Higdons had complained about conditions in the school, particularly the dampness, inadequate heating and lighting, lack of ventilation and general unhygienic conditions. Looking for a pretext for action, the managers accused Kitty of lighting a fire without their permission – to dry the clothes of children who had walked three miles to school in the rain. She was also accused of gross discourtesy when reprimanded for this act. In addition, Kitty was accused of beating two [[Barnardo]] girls. Despite her pacifist principles, the school managers found there was "good ground for the complaints of the Barnardo foster mother" and they demanded the Higdons be transferred.

Tom and Kitty demanded an inquiry be undertaken by the local Norfolk Education Authority Committee. Due to illness, Annie was unable to attend, and the National Union of Teachers-appointed legal representative failed to call any witnesses in her defence as they were being held back for a possible slander case. Despite that, the beating accusation was declared to be not proven. Only the final accusation of discourtesy to the managers was accepted and that was deemed sufficient to give the Higdon's three months' notice.

==The Strike School==
The Higdons' dismissal took effect on 1 April 1914. As the authorities were taking over, the sound of children marching and singing could be heard. Of the school's 72 pupils, 66 had gone on strike, marching around the village waving flags. None of them returned to the school, but instead had lessons on the village green. This alternative "school" was well equipped, maintained a full timetable and observed registrations with the full support of parents. The authorities were in no mood to tolerate this defiance and 18 parents were summonsed to court and fined for failing to ensure their children's attendance at school. Collections outside the court paid the fines, and since the parents were sending their children to the school of their choice, the authorities were soon forced to back down.

Word of the strike quickly spread and it became a central issue for trade unionists and school reformers throughout the country. There were regular visits of supporters and speakers. With the onset of winter, the school moved into empty workshops. The authorities kept up their intimidation with farmers sacking farm labourers (which also meant eviction from their [[tied cottage]]s). This could not be maintained, because a shortage of labour during the [[First World War]] meant that they had to be re-employed. Striking families who rented land from the rector for growing food were evicted and their crops and property destroyed. The village's [[Methodist]] preacher, who held services on the village green on Sundays for families of the Strike School children, was censured by his church.

At the end of the first year of the strike, with the lease on the old workshops due to expire, an appeal was made for funds to build a new school. By 1917, a National Appeal had reached £1,250 with donations from miners' and railway workers' unions, [[Trades council]]s, [[Independent Labour Party]] branches and [[History of the Co-operative Movement|Co-operative Societies]]. The new school was officially declared open on 13 May 1917, with the leader of the 1914 demonstration, Violet Potter, declaring, "With joy and thankfulness I declare this school open to be forever a School of Freedom."

The Burston Strike School continued until 1939. Tom Higdon died on 17 August 1939. By that time Kitty, then in her seventies, was unable to carry on alone, and the last eleven pupils transferred to the Council's school. Kitty moved to a nursing home at [[Swainsthorpe]], Norfolk and she died on 24 April 1946. Both are buried in Burston churchyard alongside each other.&lt;ref name=annie/&gt;

In 1949, the National Union of Agricultural Workers (NUAW) initiated the establishment of The Burston Strike School as a registered educational charity. Along with "Sol Sandy", the surviving trustee of the strike school and a member of the NUAW, three additional trustees were appointed from the union. The self-perpetuating trustees have the legal responsibility to manage the school and try to develop it as a museum, visitor centre, educational archive and village amenity.

In the early 1980s, the NUAW merged into the [[Transport and General Workers' Union]] (TGWU) to form the National Agriculture and Allied Workers' sector. It was at that time that the Strike School was turned into a museum and a rally to commemorate the school and the longest strike in UK history was re-established. The annual rally has been held on the first Sunday in September since 1984. It is organised by the trustees, members of TGWU (now [[Unite the Union]]) with support from other trade union organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unitetheunion.org/campaigning/events/burston-strike-school-rally-2016/|title=Burston strike school rally 2016|website=''unitetheunion.org''|access-date=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dramatisations==
===Television===
The story of the strike was dramatised in 1985 by the [[BBC]]. ''[[Screen Two]]: The Burston Rebellion'' starred [[Eileen Atkins]] as Kitty Higdon, [[Bernard Hill]] as Tom Higdon, [[John Shrapnel]] as the Reverend Charles Tucker Eland and [[Nicola Cowper]] as Violet Potter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/fd504f0f393e44b5ac49ded3923e2cfe Burston Rebellion], Genome BBC. Retrieved 27 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; It was shown on 24 February 1985, following a documentary about the strike the previous day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/2bcedff1139a49ec807c97e450168b69 Burston Strike], Genome BBC. Retrieved 27 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
In 2015, it was announced that a film adaptation of the strike would be produced for general release in 2017. Titled ''Burston'', the producers now aim to film in summer 2017 with a release in 2018. The film is to be directed by the Norfolk-raised director George Moore with a screenplay written by Alice Instone-Brewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/burston-school-strike-to-be-told-on-the-big-screen-1-4375077|title=Burston School Strike to be told on the big screen|last=Murphy|first=Rebecca|work=Eastern Daily Press|access-date=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cast includes Jasmine Fretwell as Violet Potter, Niklass van Poorvleit as Tom Higdon and Robert Clement-Evans as Rev. Eland. The filmmakers are reportedly working closely with the Burston Strike School Museum to ensure that the film represents the strike accurately, and have hired a largely Norfolk-based cast and crew to reflect the regional origins of the story.

The '''Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development''' ('''CIPD''') is a professional association for [[human resource management]] professionals. It is headquartered in [[Wimbledon, London]], England. The organisation was founded in 1913 - it is the world's oldest association in its field and has over 145,000 members internationally working across private, public and voluntary sectors. Peter Cheese was announced in June 2012 as CIPD's new [[CEO]] from July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.personneltoday.com/articles/16/05/2012/58539/cipd-appoints-peter-cheese-as-new-chief-executive.htm/ Personnel Today] "CIPD Appoints Peter Cheese as new chief executive" 16 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cipd.co.uk/cipd-hr-profession/whats-new/] CIPD What's New&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
In the United Kingdom, factory inspectors were appointed for the first time in 1893. In 1896 to look after its women and child workers [[Rowntree's]] appointed their first inspector - a Mrs E M Wood.  [[Edward Cadbury]] of [[Cadbury Brothers]] in 1909 called together employers to discuss industrial welfare work and as a result 25 employers formed an association with Mrs Wood of Rowntree's as Secretary. The work of 'welfare  workers' came to public attention during a trade show in 1912 at [[Olympia (London)|Olympia]] in London.&lt;ref name="Millerson" /&gt;

The forerunner of the CIPD, the '''Welfare Workers' Association''' (WWA) was formed at an employers' conference in York on 6 June 1913. The meeting was chaired by [[Seebohm Rowntree]]. Alongside his company, Rowntree's around fifty other companies were present including; [[Boots UK|Boots]], Cadbury and [[Chivers and Sons]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehrdirector.com/business-news/hr_in_business/duplicate-of-alarming-bad-data-habits/ HRD Happy 100th anniversary CIPD], Accessed 09 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-four of the employers present&lt;ref name="HRinOrgs"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk/educator/product/Human-Resources-in-Organisations/9780273643999.page | title=Human Resources in Organisations | publisher=[[Pearson Education]] / [[Financial Times Press]] | author=John Leopold | year=2002 | isbn=0-273-64399-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; decided that the WWA be founded as...''an association of  employers interested in industrial betterment and of welfare workers engaged by them''. The outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 led to many women and children taking up the work of men, particularly in the larger munition factories where the appointment of welfare officers was made compulsory by legislation and was monitored by the '''Health of Munition Workers Committee'''. This led to the rapid expansion of female welfare workers. There were concerns about the training of welfare staff, and in 1917, at a gathering in Leeds of the seven welfare associations formed during the period it was agreed that they merge by forming the '''Central Association of Welfare Workers''' which to accommodate the regional associations established the beginnings of a local branch structure. The Association's position was also enhanced during the war years by nationally driven encouragement of workers to join [[trade union]]s to reduce the occurrence of industrial strife. Another development which increased the numbers of company staff dealing with labour and welfare matters occurred with the inclusion of managers, mainly men, from the '''North-western Area Industrial Association''' to assist with discipline, dismissal and industrial relations in increasingly unionised organisations.&lt;ref name="HRinOrgs" /&gt; In 1918, to avoid confusion as to its purpose the Association changed its name to the '''Central Association of Welfare Workers (Industrial)''' ('''CAWWI''').&lt;ref name="Millerson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CIPDhistory" /&gt;

Another important event which had a recurring impact on the activities of the CAWWI occurred in 1918 when the Rev. [[Robert Hyde (social reformer)|Robert Hyde]] founded the Boys’ Welfare Association soon after renamed the [[Industrial Welfare Society]] (IWS) with six employers who were concerned with the welfare of boys employed or apprenticed in the shipbuilding industry. From the outset there was a strained relationship between the two bodies which continued right through the inter-war period until resolved in 1946. Though both organisations were concerned with 'welfare at work' the CAWWI developed as an institution for practitioners and the IWS was established as a membership body for employers and there was strong disagreement on how best to bring about improvements in workplace conditions and workers' welfare. The IWS later became the [[Industrial Society]] and is now known as the [[Work Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;[http://vistas.uwl.ac.uk/379/1/Alastair_Evans_-_PhD.pdf Labour Management vs Welfare Work Alistair Evans PHd Thesis], [[University of West London]], 2003, Retrieved 10 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===The post-World War I period===
In November 1919, following merger with welfare associations for men the Central Association of Welfare Workers (Industrial) was renamed the '''Welfare Workers' Institute''' and now had a membership of 700.&lt;ref name="HRinOrgs" /&gt; However, the next five years saw a reduction in membership to 250 coinciding with the rapid collapse in industrial output as the government sought to reduce the [[national debt]]. Again in 1924 on incorporation the organisation changed its name to the '''Institute of Industrial Welfare Workers''' ('''IIWW'''). [[Minnie Louise Haskins]], the author of the famous poem ''[[The Gate of the Year]]'' and a lecturer at [[London School of Economics|LSE]], was closely involved with the IIWW and edited its monthly bulletin.  As a consequence of the activities of welfare workers during the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|General Strike of 1926]] distrust in the welfare movement grew amongst trade unions which saw a new breed of 'labour managers' part of 'management' which was reflected in 1931 when the IIWW became the '''Institute of Labour Management''' and its magazine, rebranded ''Labour Management''. Members of the institute experienced new demands during the 1930s. Firstly, economic growth resulted in a shortfall in skilled labour as companies competed to recruit workers. Secondly, this was followed by lay-offs and industrial action as a worldwide depression took hold, particularly in the industrially-focussed north of England. This influence also had the effect of increasing the number of male members of the institute which significantly shifted the gender balance of the membership.&lt;ref name="HRinOrgs" /&gt; Thirdly, new human relations practices developed in the US were finding their way into more enlightened business which invested in their employees through training and provision of such things as salary benefits, pensions and paid holidays. In 1938 the first of the institute branches opened in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. In 1939 membership stood at 760.&lt;ref name="HRinOrgs" /&gt; Mirroring the First World War during [[World War II]], the government insisted on [[personnel manager|personnel officer]]s to be deployed in factories engaged in war-related production.&lt;ref name="Millerson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CIPDhistory" /&gt;

===The latter part of 20th century===
Directly after the Second World War the incoming [[Attlee ministry|Labour government]] instigated a policy of industry nationalization and launched the [[National Health Service]], further increasing the role of personnel professions in handling public sector recruitment, retention, payroll, training, and industrial relations issues. The enlightened practices of large American corporations, some of which had adopted the ideas of human relations thinkers, such as [[Elton Mayo]], and the [[Civil Service]] in the field of [[personnel management]] were being taken up by the larger UK companies. Both influences were reflected in a further change of name in 1946 to the '''Institute of Personnel Management''' (IPM).&lt;ref name="Millerson"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VcGAAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=welfare+workers+association+1913&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Fc3YVNS0O5H3atD_gJgK&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=welfare%20workers%20association%201913&amp;f=false Qualifying Associations IIs by Geoffrey Millerson], Accessed 09 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1950s were marked by government efforts to improve productivity both through introducing more modern management practices and increase labor supply through encouraging migration of people from the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] also known as the [[Windrush generation]]. In 1955, responding to these changes, the IPM sought to increase the professional standards and standing of its members by introducing an externally moderated examination scheme, and restricting entry to full membership to fully qualified or practising personnel officers over age 35 with several years' experience. Membership in 1956 stood at 3,979.&lt;ref name="HRinOrgs" /&gt;

During the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s influences on the UK workplace ranged from a series of technological revolutions, economic pressures from entry into the [[Common Market]] and impact of globalization, deregulation of the financial services industry (the Big Bang). Government intervention in industrial relations and the growth of health and safety, equality, collective and recruitment and employment legislation encouraged new specialisms to develop in the function.&lt;ref name="HRinOrgs" /&gt; In some companies a shift was seen from reactive personnel management processes towards what became known as strategic human resource management practices, or in shorthand HRM. All these factors also influenced a steady increase in membership, which in 1987 was 31,400.&lt;ref name="HRinOrgs" /&gt; The IPM underwent a period of contemplation during which it considered whether; to shift towards an HRM approach as its counterpart in the US the [[Society for Human Resource Management]] had already done, or to maintain its focus on the more traditional personnel management practices where the majority of its members still operated, or find a third way reflecting a more UK-focused approach. In 1994, a merger took place between the IPM and the Institute of Training and Development (ITD). The new organisation which had 70,000 members&lt;ref name="HRinOrgs" /&gt; was named the Institute of Personnel and Development (IPD), sought to represent the range of professionals engaged in one or more elements of people management.&lt;ref name="CIPDhistory"&gt;[http://www.cipd.co.uk/cipd-hr-profession/centenary/timeline.aspx A potted history of work-related ideas and events CIPD June 1913], Accessed 09 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Consensus decision-making''' is a [[group decision-making]] process in which group members develop, and agree to support a decision in the best interest of the whole. Consensus may be defined professionally as an acceptable resolution, one that can be supported, even if not the "favourite" of each individual. It has its origin in the [[Latin]] word ''cōnsēnsus'' (agreement), which is from ''cōnsentiō'' meaning literally ''feel together''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/consensus |title=Consensus - Definition |publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary  |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to describe both the decision and the process of reaching a decision. Consensus decision-making is thus concerned with the process of deliberating and finalizing a decision, and the social, economic, legal, environmental and political effects of applying this process.

==Alternative to common decision-making practices==
Consensus decision-making is an alternative to commonly practiced [[group decision-making]] processes.&lt;ref name="Basics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groupfacilitation.net/Articles%20on%20Meeting%20Facilitation.html |title=Articles on Meeting Facilitation, Consensus, Santa Cruz California |publisher=Groupfacilitation.net |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Robert's Rules of Order]]'', for instance, is a guide book used by many organizations. This book allows the structuring of debate and passage of proposals that can be approved through [[majority]] vote. It does not emphasize the goal of full agreement. Critics of such a process believe that it can involve adversarial debate and the formation of competing factions. These dynamics may harm group member relationships and undermine the ability of a group to cooperatively implement a contentious decision. Consensus decision-making attempts to address the beliefs of such problems. Proponents claim that outcomes of the consensus process include:&lt;ref name="CODM book" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tree Bressen (2006), [http://treegroup.info/topics/Consensus_Decison_Making-CH.pdf Consensus Decision Making]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Better decisions: Through including the input of all stakeholders the resulting proposals may better address all potential concerns.
*Better implementation: A process that includes and respects all parties, and generates as much agreement as possible sets the stage for greater cooperation in implementing the resulting decisions.
*Better group relationships: A cooperative, collaborative group atmosphere can foster greater group cohesion and interpersonal connection.

==Decision rules==
Consensus is not synonymous with "unanimity"&amp;ndash; though that may be a rule agreed to in a decision making process.  The level of agreement necessary to finalize a decision is known as a "decision rule".&lt;ref name="CODM book" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaner, S. (2011). Facilitator's Guide to Participatory Decision-making. San Francisco, CA:Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; Possible decision rules for consensus include:

#Person-in-charge decides
#Executive committee decides
#Simple majority
#[[Super majority]] thresholds (90%, 80%, 75%, two-thirds, and 60% are common).
#Consensus voting
#Condorcet consensus
#[[Unanimity|Unanimous]] agreement
#[[Unanimous consent]] (See Arriving at consensus below)
#Unanimous agreement minus one vote or two votes
#Unanimous consent minus one vote or two votes

Some groups use a consensus process to generate as much agreement as possible, but allow participants to finalize decisions with a decision rule that does not require unanimity. In such cases dissenters still must live with the decision.  Groups that require unanimous agreement or consent (unanimity) may have their decisions blocked by objection by any participant. These groups use the term consensus to denote both the discussion process and the decision rule. It is by definition the most difficult to achieve, but also the most durable, since everyone involved has given their consent.

===Arriving at consensus===
[[Consent]] must be 'genuine and cannot be obtained by force, duress or fraud.'&lt;ref&gt;Norberg v. Wynrib, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 226 (Supreme Court of Canada)&lt;/ref&gt; Giving consent does not necessarily mean that the proposal being considered is one’s first choice. Group members can vote their consent because they choose to cooperate with the direction of the group, rather than insist on their personal preference. Sometimes the vote on a proposal is framed, “Is this proposal something you can live with?”  This relaxed threshold for a yes vote can achieve full consent. However, the values of consensus are not realized if consent is given merely because dissenting participants are frustrated with the process and wanting to move on.

The process of achieving consent deliberately seeks objections, which reveal wisdom that can be used to improve proposals and agreements. An objection is a reason why doing what is proposed stands in the way of satisfying needs or goals, which the proposal aims to satisfy. Consent implies the absence of reasonable objections, that is, objections strong enough to deny giving it.

===Consensus in majority or super-majority decision rules===
A consensus process can also be concluded with a majority or super-majority vote. This is especially common or useful in large and diverse groups that share the values underlying consensus. Consensus process, by definition, seeks the maximum possible levels of agreement or consent. Thus, if a group using a majority vote decision rule is dominated by a majority faction that does not seek the agreement of all participants, the process would not be considered "consensus." Regardless of the decision rule, the process is only "consensus" if it has embodied the value of striving for full agreement or consent. Sometimes the outcomes of consensus can be contrary to majority.

=== Condorcet consensus ===
Condorcet consensus is defined as a decision achieved by the [[Condorcet method]], in which a winner (winning proposal, etc.) is that which can win a head-to-head contest with any other under consideration.  It does not require unanimous or near-unanimous consensus - which cannot be realistically reached in large group sizes - but maximizes satisfaction rate. It can also be argued that when a Condorcet consensus is reached, further deliberation will only strengthen and further specify this consensus.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

=== Consensus voting ===
The outcome of a multi-option ballot, if measured according to the Condorcet rule, will often be the same as the outcome of another preferential form of multi-option voting, the [[Modified Borda Count]], MBC. If the outcome applying the latter meets any predetermined decision rule, it may be regarded as the consensus.

===Near-unanimous consensus===
Healthy consensus decision-making processes usually encourage expression of [[dissent]] early, maximizing the chance of accommodating the views of all minorities. Since unanimity may be difficult to achieve, especially in large groups, or consent may be the result of [[coercion]], fear, undue persuasive power or eloquence, inability to comprehend alternatives, or plain impatience with the process of debate, consensus decision-making bodies may use an alternative decision rule, such as '''Unanimity Minus One''' (or U−1), or '''Unanimity Minus Two''' (or U−2).

==Blocking and other forms of dissent==
To ensure the agreement or consent of all participants is valued, many groups choose unanimity or near-unanimity as their decision rule. Groups that require unanimity allow individual participants the option of blocking a group decision. This provision motivates a group to make sure that all group members consent to any new proposal before it is adopted. Proper guidelines for the use of this option, however, are important. The ethics of consensus decision-making encourage participants to place the good of the whole group above their own individual preferences. When there is potential for a block to a group decision, both the group and dissenters in the group are encouraged to collaborate until agreement can be reached. Simply [[vetoing]] a decision is not considered a responsible use of consensus blocking. Some common guidelines for the use of consensus blocking include:&lt;ref name="CODM book" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christian, D. [https://books.google.com/books?id=xYjrCkmCOagC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=consensus&amp;f=false Creating a Life Together: Practical Tools to Grow Ecovillages and Intentional Communities]. (2003). Gabriola Island, BC, Canada:New Society Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Providing an option for those who do not support a proposal to “stand aside” rather than block.
*Requiring a block from two or more people to put a proposal aside.
*Requiring the blocking party to supply an alternative proposal or a process for generating one.&lt;ref name="Canadian Cohousing Network"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cohousing.ca/consensus.htm |title=The Consensus Decision Process in Cohousing |accessdate=2007-01-28 |author= |work= |publisher=Canadian Cohousing Network |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226135255/http://www.cohousing.ca/consensus.htm |archivedate=February 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Limiting each person’s option to block consensus to a handful of times in one’s life.
*Limiting the option of blocking to decisions that are substantial to the mission or operation of the group and not allowing blocking on routine decisions.
*Limiting the allowable rationale for blocking to issues that are fundamental to the group’s mission or potentially disastrous to the group.

===Dissent options===
A participant who does not support a proposal may have alternatives to simply blocking it. Some common options may include the ability to:
*'''Declare reservations:''' Group members who are willing to let a motion pass but desire to register their concerns with the group may choose "declare reservations." If there are significant reservations about a motion, the decision-making body may choose to modify or re-word the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.augustana.ca/rdx/bruneau/documents/PDM%20in%20an%20Intercultural%20context.doc |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927025409/http://www.augustana.ca/rdx/bruneau/documents/PDM%20in%20an%20Intercultural%20context.doc |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-09-27 |title=If Agreement Cannot Be Reached |accessdate=2007-01-17 |author=Richard Bruneau |year=2003 |format=DOC |page=37 |work=Participatory Decision-Making in a Cross-Cultural Context |publisher=Canada World Youth |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Stand aside:''' A "stand aside" may be registered by a group member who has a "serious personal disagreement" with a proposal, but is willing to let the motion pass. Although stand asides do not halt a motion, it is often regarded as a strong "nay vote" and the concerns of group members standing aside are usually addressed by modifications to the proposal. Stand asides may also be registered by users who feel they are incapable of adequately understanding or participating in the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontierus.org/documents/consensus.htm |title=FRONTIER: A New Definition |accessdate=2007-01-17 |author=Consensus Development Project |year=1998 |work= |publisher=Frontier Education Center |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212140902/http://www.frontierus.org/documents/consensus.htm |archivedate=December 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwcdc.coop/Resources/CSS/CSS08Intro2Consensus.pdf |title=Consensus Decision-Making |accessdate=2012-12-09 |author=Rachel Williams |author2=Andrew McLeod |year=2008 |format=PDF |work=Cooperative Starter Series |publisher=Northwest Cooperative Development Center |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314211654/http://www.nwcdc.coop/Resources/CSS/CSS08Intro2Consensus.pdf |archivedate=March 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.webofoz.org/consensus.shtml | title = Amazing Graces' Guide to Consensus Process | accessdate = 2007-01-17 | author = Dorcas |author2=Ellyntari | year = 2004 | work = | publisher =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Object:''' Any group member may "object" to a proposal. In groups with a unanimity decision rule, a single block is sufficient to stop a proposal. Other decision rules may require more than one objection for a proposal to be blocked or not pass (see previous section, ''[[Consensus decision-making#Decision rules|Decision rules]]'').

==Process models==
The basic model for achieving consensus as defined by any decision rule involves:
*Collaboratively generating a proposal
*Identifying unsatisfied concerns
*Modifying the proposal to generate as much agreement as possible

All attempts at achieving consensus begin with a good faith attempt at generating full-agreement, regardless of decision rule threshold.

===Specific models===
In the '''{{vanchor|spokescouncil|Spokescouncil}}''' model, [[affinity groups]] make joint decisions by each designating a speaker and sitting behind that circle of spokespeople, akin to the [[spoke]]s of a wheel. While speaking rights might be limited to each group's designee, the meeting may allot breakout time for the constituent groups to discuss an issue and return to the circle via their spokesperson. In the case of an activist spokescouncil preparing for the [[Washington A16, 2000|A16 Washington D.C. protests in 2000]], affinity groups disputed their spokescouncil's imposition of nonviolence in their action guidelines. They received the reprieve of letting groups self-organize their protests, and as the city's protest was subsequently divided into pie slices, each blockaded by an affinity group's choice of protest. Many of the participants learned about the spokescouncil model on the fly by participating in it directly, and came to better understand their planned action by hearing others' concerns and voicing their own.&lt;ref name="HaworthElmore2017"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeppesen|first1=Sandra|last2=Adamiak|first2=Joanna|chapter=Street Theory: Grassroots Activist Interventions in Regimes of Knowledge |editor-last1=Haworth|editor-first1=Robert H.|editor-last2=Elmore|editor-first2=John M.|title=Out of the Ruins: The Emergence of Radical Informal Learning Spaces|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1UIkDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT291|year=2017|publisher=PM Press|isbn=978-1-62963-319-0|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Consensus Voting====
The group first elects, say, three referees or consensors.
The debate on the chosen problem is initiated by the facilitator calling for proposals.
Every proposed option is accepted if the referees decide it is relevant and conforms with the UN Charter on Human Rights.
The referees produce and display a list of these options.
The debate proceeds, with queries, comments, criticisms and/or even new options.
If the debate fails to come to a verbal consensus, the referees draw up a final list of options - usually between 4 and 6 - to represent the debate.
When all agree, the chair calls for a preferential vote, as per the rules for a Modified Borda Count, MBC.
The referees decide which option, or which composite of the two leading options, is the outcome. If its level of support surpasses a minimum consensus coefficient, it may be adopted.

====Blocking====
[[File:Consensus-flowchart.png|thumb|250px|right|Flowchart of basic consensus decision-making process.]]

Groups that require unanimity commonly use a core set of procedures depicted in this flow chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =  http://www.consensusdecisionmaking.org/ | title = The Basics of Consensus Decision Making | accessdate = 2015-02-17 | author = | date = 2015-02-17 | work = Consensus Decision Making | publisher =  ConsensusDecisionMaking.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/c-t-butler-and-amy-rothstein-on-conflict-and-consensus-a-handbook-on-formal-consensus-decisionm |title=What is Consensus? |accessdate=2007-01-17 |author= |year=2005 |work= |publisher=The Common Place |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015105352/http://www.thecommonplace.org.uk/information.php?page=articles&amp;iID=4 |archivedate=October 15, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =  http://seedsforchange.org.uk/free/consens#proc | title = The Process | accessdate = 2007-01-17 | author = | date = 2005-12-01 | work = Consensus Decision Making | publisher =  Seeds for Change }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once an agenda for discussion has been set and, optionally, the ground rules for the meeting have been agreed upon, each item of the agenda is addressed in turn. Typically, each decision arising from an agenda item follows through a simple structure:
*'''Discussion of the item:''' The item is discussed with the goal of identifying opinions and information on the topic at hand. The general direction of the group and potential proposals for action are often identified during the discussion.
*'''Formation of a proposal:''' Based on the discussion a formal decision proposal on the issue is presented to the group.
*'''Call for consensus:''' The facilitator of the decision-making body calls for consensus on the proposal. Each member of the group usually must actively state whether they agree or consent, stand aside, or object, often by using a hand gesture or raising a colored card, to avoid the group [[Warnock's dilemma|interpreting silence or inaction as agreement]].  The number of objections is counted to determine if this step's consent threshold is satisfied.  If it is, dissenters are asked to share their concerns with proceeding with the agreement, so that any potential harms can be addressed/minimized.  ''This can happen even if the consent threshold is unanimity, especially if many voters stand aside.''
*'''Identification and addressing of concerns:''' If consensus is not achieved, each dissenter presents his or her concerns on the proposal, potentially starting another round of discussion to address or clarify the concern.
*'''Modification of the proposal:''' The proposal is amended, re-phrased or [[Rider (legislation)|ridered]] in an attempt to address the concerns of the decision-makers. The process then returns to the call for consensus and the cycle is repeated until a satisfactory decision passes the consent threshold for the group.

====Quaker-based model====
[[Quaker]]-based consensus&lt;ref name = Quaker&gt;Quaker Foundations of Leadership (1999). [http://www.earlham.edu/%7Econsense/rrocomp.shtml  ''A Comparison of Quaker-based Consensus and Robert's Rules of Order.''] Richmond, Indiana: Earlham College. Retrieved on 2009-03-01.&lt;/ref&gt; is said to be effective because it puts in place a simple, time-tested structure that moves a group towards unity.  The Quaker model is intended to allow hearing individual voices while providing a mechanism for dealing with disagreements.&lt;ref&gt;Woodrow, P. (1999). [http://www.earlham.edu/~consense/peterw.shtml "Building Consensus Among Multiple Parties: The Experience of the Grand Canyon Visibility Transport Commission."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828213829/http://www.earlham.edu/~consense/peterw.shtml |date=2008-08-28 }} Kellogg-Earlham Program in Quaker Foundations of Leadership.

The Quaker model has been adapted by [[Earlham College]] for application to secular settings, and can be effectively applied in any consensus decision-making process.

Its process includes:
&lt;!--NOTE: THIS IS NOT THE FORM USED BY THE RELIGIOUS SOCIETY OF FRIENDS, but rather an ADAPTATION by Earlham College that has been widely used in secular settings. The text is a paraphrase of SOURCED material, so please do not modify it beyond its original intent. --&gt;
*Multiple concerns and information are shared until the sense of the group is clear.
*Discussion involves [[active listening]] and sharing information.
*Norms limit number of times one asks to speak to ensure that each speaker is fully heard.
*Ideas and solutions belong to the group; no names are recorded.
*Ideally, differences are resolved by discussion. The [[facilitator]] ("clerk" or "convenor" in the Quaker model) identifies areas of agreement and names disagreements to push discussion deeper.
*The facilitator articulates the sense of the discussion, asks if there are other concerns, and proposes a "[[Minutes|minute]]" of the decision.
*The group as a whole is responsible for the decision and the decision belongs to the group.
*The facilitator can discern if one who is not uniting with the decision is acting without concern for the group or in selfish interest.
*Ideally, all dissenters' perspectives are synthesized into the final outcome for a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.&lt;ref name = Quaker/&gt;
*Should some dissenter's perspective not harmonize with the others, that dissenter may "stand aside" to allow the group to proceed, or may opt to "block".  "Standing aside" implies a certain form of silent consent.  Some groups allow "blocking" by even a single individual to halt or postpone the entire process.&lt;ref name="Quaker group facilitator"/&gt;

Key components of Quaker-based consensus include a belief in a common [[Human condition|humanity]] and the ability to decide together. The goal is "unity, not unanimity."  Ensuring that group members speak only once until others are heard encourages a diversity of thought. The facilitator is understood as serving the group rather than acting as person-in-charge.&lt;ref&gt;Quaker Foundations of Leadership (1999).

Retrieved on 2009-03-01.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Quaker model, as with other consensus decision-making processes, articulating the emerging consensus allows members to be clear on the decision in front of them.  As members' views are taken into account they are likely to support it.&lt;ref&gt;Maine.gov.

====CODM model====
The consensus-oriented decision-making&lt;ref&gt;http://www.consensusbook.com/ "Consensus-Oriented Decision-Making: The CODM Model for Facilitating Groups to Widespread Agreement"&lt;/ref&gt; (CODM) model offers a detailed step-wise description of consensus process. It can be used with any type of decision rule. It outlines the process of how proposals can be collaboratively built with full participation of all stakeholders. This model lets groups be flexible enough to make decisions when they need to, while still following a format based on the primary values of consensus decision-making. The CODM steps include:
# Framing the topic
# Open discussion
# Identifying underlying concerns
# Collaborative proposal building
# Choosing a direction
# Synthesizing a final proposal
# Closure
Some of the specific contributions of the CODM model include: 1) Starting important topics with open discussion rather than by presenting a pre-formulated proposal, so that a truly collaborative process can ensue. 2) Gathering a list of all needs and concerns expressed by the group to form criteria for all potential proposals to address. 3) taking turns in a unified attempt to build each proposal idea into the best possible proposal before choosing between them. And 4) using empathy in the closure stage to address any unresolved feelings from the process.

====Overlaps with deliberative methods====
Consensus decision-making models overlap significantly with [[Deliberation|deliberative methods]], which are processes for structuring discussion that may or may not be a lead-in to a decision.

==Roles==
The consensus decision-making process often has several roles designed to make the process run more effectively. Although the name and nature of these roles varies from group to group, the most common are the [[facilitator]], [[consensor]], a timekeeper, an empath and a secretary or notes taker. Not all decision-making bodies use all of these roles, although the facilitator position is almost always filled, and some groups use supplementary roles, such as a [[Devil's advocate]] or greeter. Some decision-making bodies rotate these roles through the group members in order to build the experience and skills of the participants, and prevent any perceived concentration of power.&lt;ref name="FNB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic.org/pnp/ocac/ |title=On Conflict and Consensus |accessdate=2011-10-31 |author=C.T.

The common roles in a consensus meeting are:
*'''Facilitator:''' As the name implies, the role of the facilitator is to help make the process of reaching a consensus decision easier. Facilitators accept responsibility for moving through the agenda on time; ensuring the group adheres to the mutually agreed-upon mechanics of the consensus process; and, if necessary, suggesting alternate or additional discussion or decision-making techniques, such as go-arounds, break-out groups or role-playing.&lt;ref name="Kerrigan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communityarts.net/readingroom/archivefiles/2004/09/how_to_use_a_co.php |title=How To Use a Consensus Process To Make Decisions |accessdate=2007-01-17 |author=Sheila Kerrigan |year=2004 |work= |publisher=Community Arts Network |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619051520/http://www.communityarts.net/readingroom/archivefiles/2004/09/how_to_use_a_co.php |archivedate=June 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guides"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.otesha.ca/bike+tours/bike+tour+resources/meeting+facilitation.en.html#toc_taking_comments |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312023053/http://www.otesha.ca/bike%2Btours/bike%2Btour%2Bresources/meeting%2Bfacilitation.en.html#toc_taking_comments |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2017-03-12 |title=Guides: Meeting Facilitation |accessdate=2007-01-17 |author=Lori Waller |work= |publisher=[[The Otesha Project]] |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some consensus groups use two co-facilitators. Shared [[Facilitation (business)|facilitation]] is often adopted to diffuse the perceived power of the facilitator and create a system whereby a co-facilitator can pass off facilitation duties if he or she becomes more personally engaged in a debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.reclaiming.org/resources/consensus/blakey.html | title = Meeting Facilitation – The No-Magic Method | accessdate = 2007-01-17 | author = Berit Lakey | year = 1975 | work = | publisher =  Network Service Collaboration }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Consensor:''' The team of consensors is responsible for accepting those relevant proposals which conform with the UN Charter on Human Rights; for displaying an initial list of these options; for drawing up a balanced list of options to represent the entire debate; to analyse the preferences cast in any subsequent MBC ballot; and, if need be, to determine the composite decision from the two most popular options.
*'''Timekeeper:''' The purpose of the timekeeper is to ensure the decision-making body keeps to the schedule set in the agenda. Effective timekeepers use a variety of techniques to ensure the meeting runs on time including: giving frequent time updates, ample warning of short time, and keeping individual speakers from taking an excessive amount of time.&lt;ref name = "FNB" /&gt;
*'''Empath or 'Vibe Watch':''' The empath, or 'vibe watch' as the position is sometimes called, is charged with monitoring the 'emotional climate' of the meeting, taking note of the body language and other [[Nonverbal communication|non-verbal cues]] of the participants. Defusing potential emotional conflicts, maintaining a climate free of intimidation and being aware of potentially destructive power dynamics, such as sexism or racism within the decision-making body, are the primary responsibilities of the empath.&lt;ref name = "Kerrigan"/&gt;
*'''Note taker:''' The role of the notes taker or secretary is to document the decisions, discussion and action points of the decision-making body.

==Tools and methods==
{{repetition|section|date=November 2015}}

===Non-verbal techniques===
Non-verbal means of expression can also reduce contention or keep issues from spreading out in time across an entire meeting.  Various methods of agenda control exist, mostly relying on an explicit chairperson with the power to interrupt off-topic or rambling discourse. This gets more difficult if there is no such chair and accordingly the attitude of the entire group must be assessed by each speaker. Verbal interruptions inevitably become common, possibly in the form of grumbling, muttering, and eventually sharp words, if there is no effective means of cutting off persons making false factual statements or rambling off a topic.

The [[Levi Hand Signal Technique]] (LHST) employed by [[Otesha]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://otesha.ca/content/meeting-facilitation|title=Meeting Facilitation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "allows meeting participants to register their intent to make two distinct kinds of comments: those that are directly in response to someone else's comment ('reactive comments') and those that are separate thoughts ('unique comments'). Intent to register a reactive comment is signaled by a different hand signal than is intent to register a unique comment. We used an index finger for the former and a full hand for the latter."  This clears direct responses to a contentious comment faster—and makes it harder to insert it in a long speakers' list and count on a long delay between the utterance and the challenge to create the appearance of agreement.

"Twinkling fingers", similarly, is a nonverbal way of expressing strong agreement, similar to applause but without the interruption and possibly less intimidation of disagreement than applause or cheers can create. The [[Occupy movement]] has used these methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.otesha.org.uk/blog/1107/random/twinkle-twinkle-little-fingers-consensus-in-action.html|title=Otesha UK : Twinkle twinkle little fingers – consensus in action|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colored cards===
[[File:Consensus Cards.svg|200px|thumb|Front face, back face and embossing mask for colored consensus cards]]
Some consensus decision-making bodies use a system of colored cards to speed up and ease the consensus process. Most often, each member is given a set of three colored cards: red, yellow and green. The cards can be raised during the process to indicate the member's input. Cards can be used during the discussion phase as well as during a call for consensus. The cards have different meanings, depending on the phase in which they are used.&lt;ref name="Canadian Cohousing Network"/&gt; The meaning of the colors are:
*'''Red:''' During discussion, a red card is used to indicate a point of process or a breach of the agreed upon procedures. Identifying offtopic discussions, speakers going over allowed time limits or other breaks in the process are uses for the red card. During a call for consensus, the red card indicates the member's opposition (usually a "principled objection") to the proposal at hand. When a member, or members, use a red card, it becomes their responsibility to work with the proposing committee to come up with a solution that works for everyone.
*'''Yellow:''' In the discussion phase, the yellow card is used to indicate a member's ability to clarify a point being discussed or answer a question being posed. Yellow is used during a call for consensus to register a stand aside to the proposal or to formally state any reservations.
*'''Green:''' A group member can use a green card during discussion to add to the speakers list. During a call for consensus, the green card indicates consent.
Some decision-making bodies use a modified version of the colored card system with additional colors, such as orange to indicate a non-blocking reservation stronger than a stand-aside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.mosaic-commons.org/colorcards | title = Color Cards | accessdate = 2007-01-17 | work = | publisher =  Mosaic Commons }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{vanchor|Hand signals}}===
[[Hand gestures|Hand signals]] are often used by consensus decision-making bodies as a way for group members to nonverbally indicate their opinions or positions. They have been found useful in facilitating groups of 6 to 250 people.  They are particularly useful when the group is multi-lingual.&lt;ref&gt;[Jan Havercamp, "Non-verbal communication – a solution for complex group settings", Zhaba facilitators collective, 1999.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature and meaning of individual gestures varies from group to group.  Nonetheless, there is a widely adopted core set of hand signals. These include: wiggling of the fingers on both hands, a gesture sometimes referred to as "twinkling", to indicate agreement; raising a fist or crossing both forearms with hands in fists to indicate a block or strong disagreement; and making a "T" shape with both hands, the "time out" gesture, to call attention to a point of process or order.&lt;ref name="Guides" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zhaba.cz/uploads/media/Shared_Path.pdf |title=A Handbook for Direct Democracy and the Consensus Decision Process |accessdate=2007-01-18 |format=PDF |publisher=Zhaba Facilitators Collective |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714080721/http://www.zhaba.cz/uploads/media/Shared_Path.pdf |archivedate=July 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seedsforchange.org.uk/free/handsig.pdf |title=Hand Signals |accessdate=2007-01-18 |format=PDF |publisher=Seeds for Change |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225024/http://seedsforchange.org.uk/free/handsig.pdf |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One common set of hand signals is called the "Fist-to-Five" or "Fist-of-Five". In this method each member of the group can hold up a fist to indicate blocking consensus, one finger to suggest changes, two fingers to discuss minor issues, three fingers to indicate willingness to let issue pass without further discussion, four fingers to affirm the decision as a good idea, and five fingers to volunteer to take a lead in implementing the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freechild.org/Firestarter/Fist2Five.htm |title=Guide for Facilitators: Fist-to-Five Consensus-Building |accessdate=2008-02-04 |publisher=Freechild.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Occupy hand signals|A similar set of hand signals]] are used by the [[Occupy Wall Street]] protesters in their group negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/52799991-75/park-pioneer-homeless-occupy.html.csp|title=Utah Local News - Salt Lake City News, Sports, Archive - The Salt Lake Tribune|author=The Salt Lake Tribune|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common set of hand signals used is the "Thumbs" method, where Thumbs Up=agreement; Thumbs Sideways=have concerns but won't block consensus; and Thumbs Down=I don't agree and I won't accept this proposal. This method is also useful for "straw polls" to take a quick reading of the group's overall sentiment for the active proposal.

A slightly more detailed variation on the thumbs proposal can be used to indicate a 5-point range: (1) Thumb-up=strongly agree, (2) Palm-up=mostly agree, (3) Thumb Sideways="on the fence" or divided feelings, (4) Palm down=mostly disagree, and (5) Thumb down=strongly disagree.

'''Other useful hand signs include:'''
* Clarifying Question – using your hand to form a "C" shape to indicate that you have a clarifying question, often this hand sign means that a person is invited to ask their question before a vote is taken.
* Point of Information – pointing your index finger upwards to indicate that you have some important factual information that relates to the discussion or decision at hand.
* Process Point – forming a triangle with your hands or hands and arms to indicate that you have an important concern with the meeting or decision-making process.

===Dotmocracy sheets===
[[File:BikeCamp09-Dotmocracy-37.JPG|thumb|Completed Dotmocracy sheet]]
[[Dotmocracy]] sheets provide a way to visibly document levels of agreement among participants on a large variety of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;http://dotmocracy.org Dotmocracy facilitator's resource website&lt;/ref&gt; Participants write down ideas on paper forms called ''Dotmocracy sheets'' and fill in one dot per sheet to record their opinion of each idea on a scale of "strong agreement", "agreement", "neutral", "disagreement", "strong disagreement" or "confusion". Participants sign each sheet they dot and may add brief comments. The result is a graph-like visual representation of the group's collective opinions on each idea.

===Fall-back methods===
Sometimes some common form of voting such as [[First-past-the-post]] is used as a ''fall-back method'' when consensus cannot be reached within a given time frame.&lt;ref&gt;Saint S, Lawson JR (1994) ''Rules for reaching consensus: a modern approach to decision making.'' Pfeiffer, San Diego&lt;/ref&gt;
However, if the potential outcome of the fall-back method can be anticipated, then those who support that outcome have incentives to block consensus so that the fall-back method gets applied. Special fall-back methods have been developed that reduce this incentive.&lt;ref name = "SCFC"&gt;Heitzig J, Simmons FW (2010). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00355-010-0517-y Some Chance For Consensus] ''Soc Choice Welf'' 35.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some specific fall-back methods include:
*"Seasoning" the topic by allowing time to pass before continuing the discussion, with the hope that time will bring resolution to unresolved differences.
* In consensus voting, if the outcome of any ballot fails to pass the predetermined threshold consensus coefficient - in other words, if there is no consensus - no decision is taken, and the debate is resumed in a search for more options.
* Delegating the unresolved topic to a committee that includes representatives of the differing viewpoints so that the differences can be resolved without absorbing too much time in a whole group meeting.
* Using a super-majority decision-rule when an issue is brought back to the whole group after seasoning or discussion in a committee.
* Assigning a committee to rule on whether a "blocking" vote satisfies the criteria for a legitimate block (i.e. Is the block based on a core value? or Is this the type of decision that can be "blocked?")

==Criticism==

===Criticism of blocking===
Critics of consensus blocking often observe that the option, while potentially effective for small groups of motivated or trained individuals with a sufficiently high degree of [[Affinity (sociology)|affinity]], has a number of possible shortcomings, notably
*'''Preservation of the status quo:''' In decision-making bodies that use formal consensus, the ability of individuals or small minorities to block agreement gives an enormous advantage to anyone who supports the existing state of affairs. This can mean that a specific state of affairs can continue to exist in an organization long after a majority of members would like it to change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/collectivebook/introductiontoconsensus.html |title=Introduction to Consensus |accessdate=2007-01-17 |author=The Common Wheel Collective |year=2002 |work=The Collective Book on Collective Process |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630154451/http://geocities.com/collectivebook/introductiontoconsensus.html |archivedate=2006-06-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The incentive to block can however be removed by using a special kind of voting process.&lt;ref name = "SCFC"/&gt;
*'''Susceptibility to widespread disagreement:''' Giving the right to block proposals to all group members may result in the group becoming hostage to an inflexible minority or individual. When a popular proposal is blocked the group actually experiences widespread disagreement, the opposite of the consensus process's goal. Furthermore, "opposing such obstructive behavior [can be] construed as an attack on freedom of speech and in turn [harden] resolve on the part of the individual to defend his or her position."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.connected.org/govern/consensus.html | title = Consensus building and verbal desperados | accessdate = 2007-01-17 | author = Alan McCluskey | year = 1999 | work = | publisher =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, consensus decision-making has the potential to reward the least accommodating group members while punishing the most accommodating.
*'''Stagnation and group dysfunction:''' When groups cannot make the decisions necessary to function (because they cannot resolve blocks), they may lose effectiveness in accomplishing their mission.
*'''Susceptibility to splitting and excluding members:''' When high levels of group member frustration result from blocked decisions or inordinately long meetings, members may leave the group, try to get to others to leave, or limit who has entry to the group.
*'''Channeling decisions away from an inclusive group process:''' When group members view the status quo as unjustly difficult to change through a whole group process, they may begin to delegate decision-making to smaller committees or to an executive committee. In some cases members begin to act unilaterally because they are frustrated with a stagnated group process.

===Groupthink===
Consensus seeks to improve [[solidarity]] in the long run.  Accordingly, it should not be confused with [[unanimity]] in the immediate situation, which is often a symptom of [[groupthink]].  Studies of effective consensus process usually indicate a shunning of unanimity or "illusion of unanimity"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Welch Cline | first1 = Rebecca J | year = 1990 | title = Detecting groupthink: Methods for observing the illusion of unanimity | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01463379009369748| journal = Communication Quarterly | volume = 38 | issue = 2| pages = 112–126| doi=10.1080/01463379009369748}}&lt;/ref&gt; that does not hold up as a group comes under real-world pressure (when dissent reappears). [[Cory Doctorow]], [[Ralph Nader]] and other proponents of [[deliberative democracy]] or judicial-like methods view the explicit dissent as a symbol of strength.

In his book about Wikipedia, [[Joseph Reagle]] considers the merits and challenges of consensus in open and online communities.&lt;ref name="Reagle2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Joseph M. Reagle Jr.]]|chapter=The challenges of consensus|chapterurl=http://reagle.org/joseph/2010/gfc/chapter-5.html|title=[[Good Faith Collaboration|Good Faith Collaboration: The Culture of Wikipedia]]|accessdate=10 June 2011|date=30 September 2010|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-01447-2|page=100}} Available for free download in multiple formats at: {{Internet Archive|id=GoodFaithColaboration|name=Good Faith Collaboration: The Culture of Wikipedia}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Randy Schutt,&lt;ref&gt;Schutt, Randy (August 31, 2010).

Papers on Nonviolent Action and Cooperative Decision-Making.&lt;/ref&gt; Starhawk&lt;ref&gt;Starhawk [http://www.consensusdecisionmaking.org/articles/#NotUnanimity Consensus is not unanimity] - a practitioner's interpretation of Schutt. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213035359/http://www.starhawk.org/activism/trainer-resources/consensus-nu.html|date=February 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other practitioners of [[direct action]] focus on the hazards of apparent agreement followed by action in which group splits become dangerously obvious.

Unanimous, or apparently unanimous, decisions can have drawbacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Institutional Law|page=547
|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=9004187987|isbn=9004187987
|first1=Henry G. |last1=Schermers|first2=Niels M. |last2=Blokker|year=2011|accessdate=2016-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They may be symptoms of a [[systemic bias]], a rigged process (where an [[agenda (meeting)|agenda]] is not published in advance or changed when it becomes clear who is present to consent), fear of speaking one's mind, a lack of creativity (to suggest alternatives) or even a lack of courage (to go further along the same road to a more extreme solution that would not achieve unanimous consent).

Unanimity is achieved when the full group apparently consents to a decision.  It has disadvantages insofar as further disagreement, improvements or better ideas then remain hidden, but effectively ends the debate moving it to an implementation phase.  Some consider all unanimity a form of groupthink, and some experts propose "coding systems...for detecting the illusion of unanimity symptom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01463379009369748 |title=Detecting groupthink: Methods for observing the illusion of unanimity |journal=Communication Quarterly |volume=38 |number=2 |first=Rebecca J. Welch |last=Cline |year=2009 |doi=10.1080/01463379009369748 |pages=112–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Consensus is not Unanimity'', consensus practitioner and activist leader [[Starhawk]] wrote:

:''Many people think of consensus as simply an extended voting method in which every one must cast their votes the same way. Since unanimity of this kind only rarely occurs in groups with more than one member, groups that try to use this kind of process usually end up being either extremely frustrated or coercive. Either decisions are never made (leading to the demise of the group, its conversion into a social group that does not accomplish any tasks), they are made covertly, or some group or individual dominates the rest. Sometimes a majority dominates, sometimes a minority, sometimes an individual who employs "the block". But no matter how it is done, it is NOT consensus.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starhawk.org/activism/trainer-resources/consensus-nu.html Consensus is not Unanimity]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221133434/http://www.starhawk.org/activism/trainer-resources/consensus-nu.html |date=February 21, 2014 }}, Starhawk. &lt;/ref&gt;

Confusion between unanimity and consensus, in other words, usually causes consensus decision-making to fail, and the group then either reverts to majority or supermajority rule or disbands.

Most robust models of consensus exclude uniformly unanimous decisions and require at least documentation of minority concerns.  Some state clearly that unanimity is not consensus but rather evidence of intimidation, lack of imagination, lack of courage, failure to include all voices, or deliberate exclusion of the contrary views.

===Criticism of majority voting processes===
Some proponents of consensus decision-making view procedures that use [[majority rule]] as undesirable for several reasons. Majority [[voting]] is regarded as [[Competition|competitive]], rather than [[cooperation|cooperative]], framing decision-making in a win/lose dichotomy that ignores the possibility of [[compromise]] or other mutually beneficial solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/en/news/news-management/all-news-english/display-single-english-news/browse/4/article/1634/consensus-a-colourful-fa-1.html |title=Consensus: a colourful farewell to majority rule |accessdate=2007-01-17 |author=Friedrich Degenhardt |year=2006 |work= |publisher=World Council of Churches |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206132304/http://www.oikoumene.org/en/news/news-management/all-news-english/display-single-english-news/browse/4/article/1634/consensus-a-colourful-fa-1.html |archivedate=2006-12-06 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlos Santiago Nino, on the other hand, has argued that majority rule leads to better deliberation practice than the alternatives, because it requires each member of the group to make arguments that appeal to at least half the participants.&lt;ref&gt;McGann, Anthony J.  The Logic of Democracy: Reconciling, Equality, Deliberation, and Minority Protection. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press. 2006. {{ISBN|0-472-06949-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A. Lijphart reaches the same conclusion about majority rule, noting that majority rule encourages coalition-building.&lt;ref name="tyranny"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://repositories.cdlib.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=csd | title = The Tyranny of the Supermajority: How Majority Rule Protects Majorities | accessdate = 2008-06-09 | author = Anthony J. McGann | year = 2002 | format = PDF | work = | publisher = Center for the Study of Democracy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, opponents of majority rule claim that it can lead to a '[[tyranny of the majority]]', a scenario in which a majority places its interests so far above those of an individual or minority group as to constitute active oppression.  Some voting theorists, however, argue that majority rule may actually prevent tyranny of the majority, in part because it maximizes the potential for a minority to form a coalition that can overturn an unsatisfactory decision.&lt;ref name="tyranny" /&gt;

Some advocates of consensus would assert that a majority decision reduces the commitment of each individual decision-maker to the decision. Members of a minority position may feel less commitment to a majority decision, and even majority voters who may have taken their positions along party or bloc lines may have a sense of reduced responsibility for the ultimate decision. The result of this reduced commitment, according to many consensus proponents, is potentially less willingness to defend or act upon the decision.

Majority voting cannot measure consensus. Indeed - so many 'for' and so many 'against' - it measures the very opposite, the degree of dissent. Consensus voting, in contrast, the Modified Borda Count, MBC, can identify the consensus of any electorate, whenever such a consensus exists. Furthermore, the rules laid down for this procedure can be the very catalyst of consensus.

== Examples ==

Outside of Western culture, multiple other cultures have used consensus decision-making. Perhaps the oldest example is the [[Grand Council of the Six Nations|Iroquois Confederacy Grand Council]], or [[Iroquois#The Haudenosaunee|Haudenosaunee]], which has used consensus in decision-making using a 75% super majority to finalize decisions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.paulkeeslerbooks.com/Chap5Iroquois.html |chapter=League of the Iroquois |author=M.

The most notable of early Western consensus practitioners are the [[Religious Society of Friends]], or Quakers, who adopted the technique as early as the 17th century.

Consensus voting was first advocated by (a) Ramón Llull in 1199. Next by (b) Nicholas Cusanus in 1435. Then by (c) Jean-Charles de Borda in 1784. Later by (d) Hother Hage in 1860 and (e) Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) in 1884. And finally by (f) Peter Emerson in 1986. With the possible exception of (e), none of these 'inventors' knew anything about the inventions of any of their predecessors.

"IETF Working Group Guidelines and Procedures."&lt;/ref&gt; The IETF has studiously refrained from defining a mechanical method for verifying such consensus, apparently in the belief that any such codification leads to attempts to "[[game the system]]." Instead, a [[IETF Working Group|working group]] (WG) chair or [[Birds of a Feather (computing)|BoF]] chair is supposed to articulate the "sense of the group."

One tradition in support of rough consensus is the tradition of humming rather than (countable) hand-raising; this allows a group to quickly tell the difference between "one or two objectors" or a "sharply divided community", without making it easy to slip into "[[majority rule]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =  http://www.ietf.org/tao.html | title = The Tao of IETF: A Novice's Guide to the Internet Engineering Task Force | accessdate = 2007-01-17 | year = 2006 | work = | publisher =  The Internet Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the business of the IETF is carried out on [[mailing list]]s, where all parties can speak their view at all times.

===Social constructivism model===
In 2001, [[Robert Rocco Cottone]] published a consensus-based model of professional decision-making for counselors and psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;Cottone, R. R. (2001). The social constructivism model of ethical decision making. "Journal of Counseling and Development," vol. 79, pp. 39-45.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on [[social constructivist]] philosophy, the model operates as a consensus-building model, as the clinician addresses ethical conflicts through a process of negotiating to consensus. Conflicts are resolved by consensually agreed on arbitrators who are defined early in the negotiation process.

===US Bureau of Land Management collaborative stakeholder engagement===
The United States [[Bureau of Land Management]]'s policy is to seek to use collaborative stakeholder engagement as standard operating practice for natural resources projects, plans, and decision-making except under unusual conditions such as when constrained by law, regulation, or other mandates or when conventional processes are important for establishing new, or reaffirming existing, precedent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/wo/Planning_and_Renewable_Resources/adr_conflict_prevention.Par.44228.File.dat/ADR.pdf |title=Bureau of Land Management National Natural Resources Policy for Collaborative Stakeholder Engagement and Appropriate Dispute Resolution |year=2009 |work= |publisher=Bureau of Land Management |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114185803/http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/wo/Planning_and_Renewable_Resources/adr_conflict_prevention.Par.44228.File.dat/ADR.pdf |archivedate=January 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern large-group [[Quakers|Quaker]] processes===
{{anchor|Quaker}}
FUM/FGC Friends conduct business in yearly meetings of perhaps 100 to 500 participants. Over the last three centuries they have evolved a number of practices peculiar to their aims. The following practices are traditional in both New York Yearly Meeting and in New England Yearly Meeting:
* A typical yearly meeting session has a presiding clerk, one or two recording clerks and a reading clerk on stage. Partitioning the work load with extra clerks lowers the stress level on the presiding clerk.
* Business sessions start with a period of corporate silent worship.
* A period of silent worship, perhaps thirty seconds, is allotted by the presiding clerk after each person speaks. This slows the pace of the business meeting down and allows people to contemplate people's messages.
* The use of wireless microphones helps to slow down the pace of the meeting. Volunteer microphone runners are instructed to walk at a reasonably slow pace toward someone standing and waiting to be recognized.
* The clerk often recognizes who speaks first, then second, then third.
* A pastoral care team upholds the presiding clerk, or simply the clerk, in prayer.
* Attempts are made to take minor editing functions off of the floor of the meeting. Minutes are polished by a committee before presenting them on the meeting floor. All suggested small corrections are incorporated either on the spot by the caucusing clerks, or at a special impromptu meeting after the current business session ends. Corrected minutes are then brought back onto the floor of the meeting at a later date.
* Major, complex concerns result in a called threshing session, a meeting of people most concerned about the issue.
* New England Yearly Meeting has discovered the benefits of anchor groups, groups of about ten participants who meet every day during a multi-day yearly meeting. People sometimes need to vocalize their personal opinions on issues to a few other people, in part because people think aloud.

Every 20 or 30 years, each yearly meeting's consensus practices are re-codified in a new edition of that yearly meeting's Faith and Practice book.

==Additional criticism from biblical and philosophical perspectives==
As a notable example of the failure of unanimity in the [[Western canon]], New Testament historian [[Elaine Pagels]] cites the [[Sanhedrin]]'s unanimous vote to convict [[Jesus of Nazareth]].&lt;ref name="Pagels1996" /&gt; To a Jewish audience familiar with that court's requirement to set free any person unanimously convicted as not having a proper defense, Pagels proposes that the story is intended to signal the injustice of unanimous rush to agreement and Jesus' lack of a defender.&lt;ref name="Pagels1996" /&gt; She cites the shift away from this view and towards preference for visible unanimity as a factor in later "demonization" of Jews, pagans, heretics (notably [[Gnostic]]s) and others who disagreed with orthodox views in later Christianity. Unanimity, in other words, became a priority where it had been an [[anathema]].

Some formal models based on [[graph theory]] attempt to explore the implications of suppressed [[dissent]] and subsequent sabotage of the group as it takes action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5641917&amp;punumber=5629466&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F5629466%2F5641665%2F05641917.pdf%3Ftp%3D%26arnumber%3D5641917%26punumber%3D5629466 |title=Error: |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511040906/http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5641917&amp;punumber=5629466&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F5629466%2F5641665%2F05641917.pdf%3Ftp%3D&amp;arnumber=5641917&amp;punumber=5629466 |archivedate=May 11, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

High-stakes decision-making, such as judicial decisions of appeals courts, always require some such explicit documentation. Consent however is still observed that defies factional explanations. Nearly 40% of Supreme Court of US decisions, for example, are unanimous, though often for widely varying reasons. "Consensus in Supreme Court voting, particularly the extreme consensus of unanimity, has often puzzled Court observers who adhere to ideological accounts of judicial decision making."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2669346?uid=3739432&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3737720&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=47698918057047|title=The Norm of Consensus on the U.S. Supreme Court|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historical evidence is mixed on whether particular Justices' views were suppressed in favour of public unity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2011.01249.x/full|title=Consensus, Disorder, and Ideology on the Supreme Court | doi=10.1111/j.1740-1461.2011.01249.x | volume=9|issue=1|journal=Journal of Empirical Legal Studies|pages=129–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method to achieve more agreement to satisfy a strict threshold a voting process under which all members of the group have a strategic incentive to agree rather than block.&lt;ref name="SCFC" /&gt; However, this makes it very difficult to tell the difference between those who support the decision and those who merely tactically tolerate it for the incentive. Once they receive that incentive, they may undermine or refuse to implement the agreement in various and non-obvious ways. In general [[voting system]]s avoid allowing offering incentives (or "bribes") to change a heartfelt vote.

*[[Abilene paradox]]: Consensus decision-making is susceptible to all forms of [[groupthink]], the most dramatic being the [[Abilene paradox]]. In the Abilene paradox, a group can unanimously agree on a course of action that no individual member of the group desires because no one individual is willing to go against the perceived will of the decision-making body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Jerry B.|last= Harvey|journal=Organizational Dynamics|date=Summer 1974|volume= 3|issue=1|title=The Abilene Paradox and other Meditations on Management|doi=10.1016/0090-2616(74)90005-9|pages=63–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Time Consuming: Since consensus decision-making focuses on discussion and seeks the input of all participants, it can be a time-consuming process. This is a potential liability in situations where decisions must be made speedily, or where it is not possible to canvass opinions of all delegates in a reasonable time. Additionally, the time commitment required to engage in the consensus decision-making process can sometimes act as a barrier to participation for individuals unable or unwilling to make the commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/ndu/strat-ldr-dm/pt3ch11.html |title=Consensus Team Decision Making |accessdate=2007-01-17 |author=|work=Strategic Leadership and Decision Making |publisher=National Defense University }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, once a decision has been reached it can be acted on more quickly than a decision handed down. American businessmen complained that in negotiations with a Japanese company, they had to discuss the idea with everyone even the janitor, yet once a decision was made the Americans found the Japanese were able to act much quicker because everyone was on board, while the Americans had to struggle with internal opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tomalin |first1=Barry |last2=Knicks |first2=Mike |title=The World's Business Cultures and How to Unlock Them |chapter=Consensus or individually driven decision- |publisher=Thorogood Publishing, |year=2008 |page=109 |isbn=978-1-85418-369-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crown College''' was a small, [[for-profit school|for-profit]], predominantly online college located in [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].

Crown College offered most of its classes through [[distance education]].  It employs an online technology called the Cloudroom which is a "live interactive classroom environment".&lt;ref name=web/&gt; It also features an accelerated program where students can complete an Associate of Science in approximately 14 months and a Bachelor of Science in approximately 28 months.&lt;ref name="web"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crowncollege.edu/ |title=Crown College website |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=September 11, 2006 |accessdate=December 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911224410/http://www.crowncollege.edu/ |archivedate=September 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accreditation ==

Until July 31, 2007, Crown College was [[school accreditation|accredited]] by the [[Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges of Technology]] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20070630111244/http://www.accsct.org/ ACCSCT]), which superseded the NATTS in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/accrediting-commission-of-career-schools-and-colleges-of-technology |title='&amp;#39;Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges of Technology'&amp;#39; Answers.com website |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=December 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Crown College had been on probation with ACCSCT intermittently since 2005.&lt;ref name="prob"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215556/http://www.accsct.org/Content/CommissionActions/031207Probation%20Notice.pdf ''ACCSCT Schools on Probation as of March 12, 2007'']&lt;/ref&gt;  The ACCSCT is a [[Nationally recognized accrediting agencies in the United States|national accrediting agency]] which accredits 800 post-secondary schools and colleges serving over 240,000 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexdon.com/article/Accrediting_Commission_of_Career_Schools/11940.html |title='&amp;#39;ACCSCT selects eCollege to Power Online Training Program'&amp;#39;, Lexdon Business Library website, October 5, 2006 |publisher=Lexdon.com |accessdate=December 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These schools teach a wide range of vocational, career and technical subjects which include [[massage]], [[acupuncture]], beauty, pet grooming, cooking, art, [[locksmith]]ing, [[gemology]], detective investigation, [[refrigeration]], [[helicopter]] [[flight training]], mechanical and aviation [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]] to name a few.&lt;ref name=accsct&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accsct.org/ |title=ACCSCT website |publisher=Accsct.org |accessdate=December 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223000740/http://www.accsct.org/ |archivedate=December 23, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Closure ==

On July 31, 2007, the ACCSCT stripped the school of its accreditation, resulting in the school having to close, until such time it can regain accreditation.&lt;ref name=bizclose/&gt;&lt;ref name=seaclose/&gt;&lt;ref name=tntclose/&gt;&lt;ref name=revoke/&gt;  According to the Associate Director of the ACCSCT, Crown was stripped of its accreditation because it failed to place 70% of its graduates in the field they had studied for.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/education/story/134157.html Shuttered College Says It Wants to Help Students Left in the Lurch, ''[[The Tacoma News Tribune]]'', Karen Hucks, August 16, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930153954/http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/education/story/134157.html |date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrangements were made for current students to complete their studies through [[Herzing College]] Online.&lt;ref name="HECB WA" /&gt; In order to offer degrees in Washington State again, Crown will need to seek approval from the Higher Education Coordinating Board since the loss of ACCSCT accreditation means Crown would no longer be exempt from HECB oversight.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

== Federal criminal indictment ==

On August 14, 2007 the Department of Education, Office of Inspector General, served a search warrant on Crown College and seized documents and computer files connected with an alleged case of financial aid fraud, conspiracy to defraud and bank fraud by senior employees of Crown College.  These employees and some of their "significant" others, were under the impression that Crown College would close and allegedly falsified loan applications and received financial aid though they did not attend Crown.

On May 13, 2010, four former officers of the defunct school were indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of mail and financial aid fraud.  The charges stem from the August 14, 2007 investigation.  The indictment named four former officers of the school: Sheila Mullineaux, Vice President; Jesica McMullin, Admissions Director and Registrar; Misty Lee, Financial Aid Director; and Jennifer Byers, Fiscal Manager and Bookkeeper.&lt;ref name="indictment"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pulkkinen |first=Levi|title=Ex-Crown College executives charged with student aid fraud|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/419990_crown13.html|publisher=Seattle PI|accessdate=May 15, 2010|date=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indictment |url=http://www.crowncollegelawsuits.com/indictment.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708211910/http://www.crowncollegelawsuits.com/indictment.pdf |archivedate=July 8, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Degrees offered==

Crown College offered Associate of Science degrees in Paralegal Studies, Criminal Justice and Business Administration and Bachelor of Science degrees in Business and Public Administration.  These degrees were conveyed under the authority and auspices of the ACCSCT since Crown College is exempt from oversight by the [http://www.hecb.wa.gov/ Washington State Higher Education Coordinating Board (HECB).]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hecb.wa.gov/autheval/daa/listofcolleges.asp HECB website showing list of "continuously exempt institutions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205031647/http://www.hecb.wa.gov/autheval/daa/listofcolleges.asp |date=February 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sea/&gt; which oversees most degree granting colleges and universities in the state.  However, since the ACCSCT no longer accredits Crown College, it is no longer authorized to offer degrees in Washington state.

'''Education and Science Workers' Union''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Eğitim ve Bilim Emekçileri Sendikası''), better known with its abbreviation '''Eğitim-Sen''', is a [[left-wing]] [[trade union]] of [[teacher]]s and other education workers in [[Turkey]]. In 2005 it had around 200,000 members and was Turkey's largest trade union.&lt;ref name=turkey20050122/&gt;

It was founded on January 23, 1995 as a merger of Eğit-Sen and Eğitim-İş both founded in 1990.  It is a member of [[Confederation of Public Workers' Unions|KESK]] ([[Confederation of Public Workers' Unions|Confederation of Public Employees Trade Unions]], [[Education International]] the [[International Trade Union Confederation]].&lt;ref name=turkey20050122/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egitimsen.org.tr/ Eğitim Sen website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ban attempts==

===2004===
In 2004  an attempt was initiated to shut down the organization by [[Attorney General]] of [[Ankara]] on the grounds that its statute contained the statement  "...the defence [of the right] of individuals to receive education in their mother tongue", which was claimed to be against the Article 42 of the [[Constitution of Turkey]] which says that "No other language than Turkish may be taught in educational and teaching facilities to Turkish citizens as their mother tongue". The closure was demanded because Eğitim Sen refused to remove the phrase in question from its statute during the series of reforms associated with the [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|aspiration of Turkey towards joining]] the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name=turkey20050122&gt;[[Network for Education and Academic Rights]], 22 January 2005, [http://www.nearinternational.org/alert-detail.asp?alertid=435 "Teachers Union Threatened With Closure Because of Controversial Laws"]&lt;/ref&gt;

After a long and controversial litigation Eğitim Sen was closed by the General Assembly of the Supreme Court of Appeal on May 25, 2005. To avoid the closure, Eğitim Sen later revoked the clause in question from its statute.

===2008===
In 2008 however, a complaint by [[Adnan Oktar]] did lead to the banning of the organisation's website. This was a reaction to a press-release about Adnan Oktar’s ''[[Atlas of Creation]]'', which was sent to schools free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bianet.org/english/kategori/english/109951/creationist-adnan-oktar-manages-to-shut-down-another-internet-site |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212152131/http://www.bianet.org/english/kategori/english/109951/creationist-adnan-oktar-manages-to-shut-down-another-internet-site |archivedate=2009-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decisions of the European Court of Human Rights===
In September 2009 the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) ordered adjudged Turkey to pay 2,340 Euro (around 5,150 Turkish Lira) in compensation for restricting trade union activities of Güldeniz Kaya, Ahmet Seyhan and Saime Özcan, members of the Education and Science Workers Trade Union (Eğitim-Sen). Their complaint not only applied to a disregard of Article 11 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] which guarantees "freedom of assembly and association". Furthermore, the complaint also applied to Article 13 which defines the "right to an effective remedy".&lt;ref&gt;Report of the independent communication network BIA on 17 September 2009 [http://bianet.org/bianet/freedom-of-expression/117119-echr-turkey-guilty-of-disregarding-unions-rights ECHR: Turkey Guilty of Disregarding Union's Rights]; accessed on 29 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 September 2012 the ECHR ruled on the demand to close Eğitim-Sen.&lt;ref name=echr&gt;ECHR, 25 September 2012, [http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-113408 AFFAIRE EĞİTİM VE BİLİM EMEKÇİLERİ SENDİKASI c. TURQUIE (Requête no 20641/05)], accessed on 29 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It was stated that "''Eğitim-Sen was founded in Ankara on 13 January 1995. According to information provided by the union it has 167,000 members, is divided into 90 sections and is present in 430 cities. It is attached to KESK (''Kamu Emekçileri Sendikaları Konfederasyonu'', the Confederation of Unions for public employees), which is a member of EI (Education International)...''" As far as the demand for closure was concerned the ECHR argued that "''the impugned action brought against the complainant amounted to an interference by national authorities in the exercise of his right to freedom of association''." The Court held unanimously that there had been a violation of Article 11 and of Article 10 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights|Convention]] and ordered Turkey to 7,500 EURO for non-pecuniary damage.&lt;ref name=echr/&gt;

==Imprisonment==
"On 28 October [2012], the Izmir Criminal Court sentenced 25 members of the teachers’ union Egitim Sen, affiliated to the public sector confederation KESK and Education International (EI) to 6 years and 5 months in prison under the country’s anti-terrorism legislation. Prominent figures among those sentenced included KESK President Lami Özgen, the former Women’s Secretary of KESK, Ms. Songul Morsumbul, Egitim Sen Women’s Secretary Ms. Sakine Esen Yilmaz, and former Women’s Secretaries Ms. Gulcin Isbert and Ms. Elif Akgul Ates. The “evidence” against them included possession of books that can be found in any bookstore in Turkey and the holding of union meetings. Owing to the lack of evidence it had appeared that the defendants were going to be acquitted, until two of the judges were summarily removed from the trial just before the final hearing. Even the Chief Justice was in favour of an acquittal. KESK lodged an appeal against the Criminal Court decision."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Turkey – Education trade unionists sentenced as terrorists (2012) |url=http://survey.ituc-csi.org/Education-trade-unionists.html |publisher=[[ITUC]] |date=2012 |accessdate=December 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education is compulsory up to the age of 16 in every province in Canada, except for Manitoba, Ontario, and New Brunswick, where the compulsory age is 18, or as soon as a high school diploma has been achieved. In some provinces early leaving exemptions can be granted under certain circumstances at 14. Canada generally has 190 (180 in Quebec) school days in the year, officially starting from September (after [[Labour Day#Canada|Labour Day]]) to the end of June (usually the last Friday of the month, except in Quebec when it is just before June 24&amp;nbsp;– the provincial holiday). In British Columbia secondary schools, there are 172 school days during a school year. (2013-2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.rolia.net/lf/post.php?p=346|title = How many school days the students have in a BC high school?|work = www.rolia.net|author = |publisher = |year =2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Alberta, high school students get an additional four weeks off to accommodate for exam break; two weeks in January, and two in June. Classes typically end on the 15th of those two months.

==Canada-wide==
Elementary, intermediate, secondary, and post-secondary education in Canada is a  provincial responsibility and there are many variations between the provinces.  The federal government's responsibilities in education are limited to the [[Royal Military College of Canada]], and funding the education of [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|indigenous peoples]].

About one out of ten Canadians does not have a high school diploma&amp;nbsp;– three in seven has a university degree&amp;nbsp;– the adult population that is without a high school diploma is a combination of both immigrant and Canadian-born. In many places, publicly funded high school courses are offered to the adult population. The ratio of high school graduates versus non diploma-holders is changing rapidly, partly due to changes in the labour market&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mygradebooster.com/2017/10/seven-survival-skills/|title=Building a Better Student: Teach These Seven Survival Skills for a Brighter Future|date=2017-10-16|work=Vancouver Tutoring Services {{!}} MyGradeBooster Tutors|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; that require people to have a high school diploma and, in many cases, a university degree. Nonetheless, more than 51% of Canadians have a college degree, the highest rate in the world by far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/09/27/and-the-worlds-most-educated-country-is/|title=And the World's Most Educated Country Is...|author=Grossman, Samantha|date=September 27, 2012|work=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of schools, at 67%, are co-educational.

Canada spends about 5.4% of its [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] on education.&lt;ref name="WorldBank"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.XPD.TOTL.GD.ZS | title=Public spending on Education | publisher=The world Bank | date=2011 | accessdate=July 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country invests heavily in tertiary education (more than US$20,000 per student).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oecd.org/education/skills-beyond-school/48630868.pdf | title=Financial and human resources invested in Education | publisher=OECD | date=2011 | accessdate=July 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent reports suggest that from 2006 the tuition fees of Canadian universities have increased by 40 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oneclass.com/blog/insight/10087-canadian-university-tuition-fees-rise-40-percent-in-the-last-10-years |title=Canadian University tuition fees rise 40 percent in the last 10 years|publisher=OneClass|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the adoption of [[Section Twenty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 23]] of the [[Constitution Act, 1982]], education in both [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] has been available in most places across Canada (if the population of children speaking the minority language justifies it), although French Second Language education/French Immersion is available to anglophone students across Canada.

According to an announcement of Canadian Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Canada is introducing a new, fast-track system to let foreign students and graduates with Canadian work experience become permanent eligible residents in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education-blog.net/2008/08/19/canada-is-opening-doors-to-students/|title=Canada Is Opening Doors To Students|work=The Education Blog|date=August 19, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426221210/http://www.education-blog.net/2008/08/19/canada-is-opening-doors-to-students/|archivedate=April 26, 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most schools have introduced one or more initiatives such as programs in Native studies, antiracism, Aboriginal cultures and crafts; visits by elders and other community members; and content in areas like indigenous languages, Aboriginal spirituality, indigenous knowledge of nature, and tours to indigenous heritage sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wotherspoon | first1 = R. | year = 2006 | title = Teachers' work in Canadian aboriginal communities | url = | journal = Comparative Education Review | volume = 50 | issue = 4| pages = 672–694 | doi=10.1086/507060}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although these classes are offered, most appear to be limited by the area or region in which students reside.

Subjects that typically get assessed (i.e., language arts, mathematics, and science) assume greater importance than non-assessed subjects (i.e., music, visual arts, and physical education) or facets of the curriculum (i.e., reading and writing versus speaking and listening).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Volante | first1 = L | year = 2007 | title = Educational quality and accountability in Ontario: Past, present, future | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Educational Administration and Policy | volume = 58 | issue = | pages = 2–21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars view academics as a form of "soft power" helping to educate and to create positive attitudes,&lt;ref&gt;Nelles, W. (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; although there is criticism that educators are merely [[Indoctrination|telling students what to think]], instead of how to [[Critical thinking|think for themselves]], and using up a large proportion of classroom time in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Zwaagstra| first =Michael| last2 =Clifton| first2 =Rodney| last3 =Long| first3 =John| title =What's Wrong with Our Schools: and How We Can Fix Them| place =Toronto| publisher =Rowman &amp; Littlefield| year =2010| pages =190| isbn =1607091577}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Reynolds| first =Cynthia| title =Why are schools brainwashing our children?| newspaper =Maclean's| publisher =Rogers| date =October 31, 2012| url =http://www2.macleans.ca/2012/10/31/why-are-schools-brainwashing-our-children/#more-306842| accessdate =December 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to keep students happy and socially correct often come at the expense of [[academic achievement]].

===Divisions by religion and language===
The Constitution of Canada provides constitutional protections for some types of publicly funded religious-based and language-based school systems.

The ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'' contains a guarantee for publicly funded religious-based [[separate schools]], provided the separate schools were established by law prior to the province joining Confederation.  Court cases have established that this provision did not apply to [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]], [[Manitoba]], [[British Columbia]], and [[Prince Edward Island]], since those provinces did not provide a legal guarantee for separate schools prior to Confederation.  The provision did originally apply to [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Alberta]], and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], since these provinces did have pre-existing separate schools.  This constitutional provision was repealed in Quebec by a constitutional amendment in 1997, and for Newfoundland and Labrador in 1998.  The constitutional provision continues to apply to Ontario, Saskatchewan and Alberta.  There is a similar federal statutory provision which applies to the [[Northwest Territories]].

Section 23 of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'' guarantees the right of citizens who were educated in the minority language in a particular province to have their children educated in the minority language in publicly funded schools.  In practice, this guarantee means that there are publicly funded English schools in Quebec, and publicly funded French schools in the other provinces and the territories.

Quebec students must attend a French school up until the end of high school unless one of their parents qualifies as a rights-holder under s.23 of the Charter.  In Ontario, French language schools automatically admit students recognized under section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and may admit non-francophone students through the board's admissions committee consisting of the school principal, a school superintendent and a teacher.

===Length of study===
Most education programs in Canada begin in  kindergarten (which is age five) or grade one (age six) and go to grade twelve (age 17 or 18), except in Quebec, where students finish a year earlier. After completion of a secondary school diploma, students may go on to post-secondary studies.

===Authorities===
Normally, for each type of publicly funded school (such as Public English or Public French), the province is divided into districts (or divisions).  For each district, board members (trustees) are elected only by its supporters within the district (voters receive a ballot for just one of the boards in their area).  Normally, all publicly funded schools are under the authority of their local district school board. These school boards would follow a common curriculum set up by the province the board resides in. Only [[Alberta]] allows public [[Alberta charter schools|charter schools]], which are independent of any district board.  Instead, they each have their own board, which reports directly to the province.

==Pre-university==
[[Primary education]], [[Intermediate education]], and [[secondary education]] combined are sometimes referred to as K-12 (Kindergarten through Grade 12).  [[Secondary schooling]], known as high school, [[collegiate institute]], ''école secondaire'' or secondary school, consists of different grades depending on the province in which one resides. Furthermore, grade structure may vary within a province or even within a school division and may or may not include middle school or junior high school.

Kindergarten (or its equivalent) is available for children in all provinces in the year they turn five (except Ontario and Quebec, where it begins a year earlier), but the names of these programs, provincial funding, and the number of hours provided varies widely.  For example, the Department of Education in Nova Scotia refers to Kindergarten as Grade Primary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ednet.ns.ca/index.php?t=sub_pages&amp;cat=382|title = Learning Outcomes by GRADE|work = Learning Outcomes Framework documents|author = |publisher = Province of Nova Scotia|year =2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ontario offers two years of optional kindergarten (junior kindergarten for four-year-olds and senior kindergarten for five-year-olds). At French schools in Ontario, these programs are called ''Maternelle'' and ''Jardin''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/fre/educationFacts.html Education Facts]. Retrieved November 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;'' ''In 2010, Ontario increased both years to full-day programs, while BC's single year of kindergarten became full-day in 2012. Quebec offers heavily subsidized preschool programs and introduced an early kindergarten program for children from low-income families in 2013. Students in the Prairie provinces are not required by statute to attend kindergarten. As a result, kindergarten often is not available in smaller towns.

Dependent on the province the age of mandatory entry to the education system is at 4–7 years. Starting at grade one, at age six or seven, there is universal publicly funded access up to grade twelve (age seventeen to eighteen), except in Quebec, where secondary school ends one year earlier.  Children are required to attend school until the age of sixteen (eighteen in Manitoba, Ontario, and New Brunswick).  In [[Quebec]], the typical high school term ends after Secondary V/Grade eleven (age sixteen to seventeen); following this, students who wish to pursue their studies to the [[university]] level have to attend [[College education in Quebec|college]] (see [[Education in Quebec]]). Quebec is currently the only province where Grade 12 is part of postsecondary, though Grade 11 was also the end of secondary education in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] prior to the introduction of grade 12 in 1983.

Ontario had a Grade 13, subsequently, known as [[Ontario Academic Credit]] (OAC) year, but this was abolished in 2003 by the provincial government to cut costs. As a result, the curriculum has been compacted, and the more difficult subjects, such as mathematics, are comparatively harder than before. However, the system is now approximately equivalent to what has been the case outside of Quebec and Ontario for many years.

Students may continue to attend high school until the ages of 19 to 21 (the cut-off age for high school varies between provinces). Those 19 and over may attend adult school. Students of high school age who have received long-term suspensions or have been expelled, or are otherwise unable or unwilling to attend conventional schools may be offered alternative learning options to complete their secondary education, such as drop-in programs, night school, or distance/online classes.

An increasing number of international students are attending pre-university courses at Canadian high schools.

Post-secondary education in Canada is also the responsibility of the individual provinces and territories.  Those governments provide the majority of funding to their public post-secondary institutions, with the remainder of funding coming from tuition fees, the federal government, and research grants. Compared to other countries in the past, Canada has had the highest tertiary school enrollment as a percentage of their graduating population.&lt;ref&gt;Glen A. Jones, ed., ''Higher education in Canada: Different systems, different perspectives.'' (Routledge, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly all post-secondary institutions in Canada have the authority to grant academic credentials (i.e., diplomas or degrees).  Generally speaking, universities grant degrees (e.g., bachelor's, master's or doctorate degrees) while colleges, which typically offer vocationally oriented programs, grant diplomas and certificates.   However, some colleges offer applied arts degrees that lead to or are equivalent to degrees from a university. Private career colleges are overseen by legislative acts for each province. For example, in British Columbia training providers will be registered and accredited with the (PCTIA) Private Career Training Institutions Agency regulated under the Private Career Training Institutions Act (SBC 2003) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pctia.bc.ca/contact.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 29, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706165312/http://pctia.bc.ca/contact.htm |archivedate=July 6, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each province with their own correlating agency.  Unlike the United States, there is no "accreditation body" that oversees the universities in Canada.  Universities in Canada have degree-granting authority via an Act or Ministerial Consent from the Ministry of Education of the particular province.

Post-secondary education in Quebec  begins with college following graduation from Grade 11 (or Secondary V).  Students complete a two- or three-year general program leading to admission to a university, or a professional program leading directly into the labour force.  In most cases, bachelor's degree programs in Quebec are three years instead of the usual four; however, in many cases, students attending a university in Quebec that did not graduate from college must complete an additional year of coursework.  When Ontario had five years of high school, a three-year [[bachelor's degree]] was common, but these degrees are being phased out in favour of the four-year degree.

The main variation between the provinces, with respect to the universities, is the amount of funding they receive and the amount of tuition and other fees they charge.

The [[Royal Military College of Canada]] (RMC), is the [[military academy]] of the [[Canadian Forces]] and is a full degree-granting university. RMC is the only federal institution with degree-granting powers.

==Private schools==
About 6% of Canadian tenth-graders are in [[private school]]s, most of which are in Quebec. A Statistics Canada study from 2015 found that these students tend to have higher test scores and future educational attainment than their public school counterparts. Rather than enjoying superior resources and educational practices, the most likely explanation for this discrepancy is the higher expectation of success that students experience from their parents, teachers, and fellow students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Private universities===

In the past, private universities in Canada maintained a religious history or foundation.  However, since 1999, the Province of New Brunswick passed the Degree Granting Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Degree Granting Act|work=New Brunswick Department of Justice|url=http://www.gnb.ca/0062/acts/acts/d-05-3.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030402151557/http://www.gnb.ca/0062/acts/acts/d-05-3.htm|archivedate=April 2, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing private universities to operate in the Province.&lt;ref&gt;"The Degree Granting Act establishes a framework for evaluating the quality of programs leading to a degree offered by all public and private institutions, except those created by an Act of the New Brunswick Legislature prior to the Act coming in force, that is before March 1, 2002."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Degree Granting Act|work=New Brunswick Department of Post-Secondary Education, Training and Labour|url=http://www.gnb.ca/0105/ps/dga-e.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104010927/http://www.gnb.ca/0105/ps/dga-e.asp|archivedate=January 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [http://www.UniversityFredericton.ca University of Fredericton] is the newest university to receive designation in New Brunswick.

[[Trinity Western University]], in Langley British Columbia, was founded in 1962 as a junior college and received full accreditation in 1985. In 2002, [[British Columbia]]'s [[Quest University]] became the first privately funded [[liberal arts]] university without a denominational affiliation (although it is not the first private liberal arts university). Many provinces, including Ontario and Alberta, have passed legislation allowing private degree-granting institutions (not necessarily universities) to operate there.

Many Canadians remain polarized on the issue of permitting private universities into the Canadian market. On the one hand, Canada's top universities find it difficult to compete with the private American powerhouses because of funding, but on the other hand, the fact that the price of private universities tends to exclude those who cannot pay that much for their education could prevent a significant portion of Canada's population from being able to attend these schools.

In addition to the issue of access, some Canadians find issue with protections instituted within the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] as ruled by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2001 and consistent with federal and provincial law that (private) faith-based universities in Canada based on the long established principles of freedom of conscience and religion can exempt itself from more recent human rights legislation when they insist in their "community covenant" code signed by staff, faculty and students that they act in accordance with the faith of the school. The covenant may require restraint from those acts considered in contradiction with the tenets of their faith such as homosexual relationships, sex outside marriage or more broadly abstain from consuming alcohol on campus or viewing pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Proposed Christian law school at Trinity Western under fire because of university’s anti-gay rules|last=Todd|newspaper=Vancouver Sun|first=Douglas|date=January 16, 2013|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/life/Proposed+Christian+school+Trinity+Western+under+fire+because+university+anti+rules/7830354/story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, private-Christian based schools do not preclude homosexual or lesbian students from attending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trinity Western University law school proponents fire back at critics|last=Tamminga|first=Monique|date= March 27, 2013|newspaper=Langley Times|url=http://www.langleytimes.com/news/200277801.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some faith-based universities have been known to fire staff and faculty which refused to adhere or whose actions were in opposition with the tenets of the faith, although in some provinces, their dismissals have been successfully challenged in court based on the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline - Same Sex Rights in Canada (See 1991)|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2012/01/12/f-same-sex-rights.html|publisher=CBC|accessdate=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious schools==
Each province deals differently with private religious schools. In Ontario the Catholic system continues to be fully publicly funded while other faiths are not. Ontario has several private Jewish, Islamic, and Christian schools all funded through tuition fees. Since the Catholic schools system is entrenched in the constitution, the Supreme Court has ruled that this system is constitutional. However, the United Nations [[Human Rights Committee]] has ruled that Ontario's system is discriminatory, suggesting that Ontario either fund no faith-based schools, or all of them.&lt;ref&gt;[{{Cite web

  | postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 the government of [[Mike Harris]] introduced a controversial program to partially fund all private schools, but this was criticized for undermining the public education system and the program was eliminated after the Liberals won the 2003 provincial election.

In other provinces privately operated religious schools are funded. In British Columbia the government pays independent schools that meet rigorous provincial standards up to 50% of the per-student operating cost of public schools. The province has a number of Sikh, Hindu, Christian, and Islamic schools. Alberta also has a network of [[Alberta charter schools|charter schools]], which are fully funded schools offering distinct approaches to education within the public school system.  Alberta charter schools are not private and the province does not grant charters to religious schools.  These schools have to follow the provincial curriculum and meet all standards, but are given considerable freedom in other areas. In all other provinces private religious schools receive some funding, but not as much as the public system.

An example of how schools can be divided by religion, [[Toronto]] has two English boards; [[Toronto Catholic District School Board]] and [[Toronto District School Board]], and two French boards; [[Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud]] and [[Conseil scolaire Viamonde]].

==Levels in education==

===Canada outside Quebec===
As the education system in Canada is managed by the varying provincial governments in Canada, the way the educational stages are grouped and named may differ from each region, or even between districts and individual schools. The ages are the age of the students when they end the school year in June.

English schools in Quebec have the same grade system as French schools, but with English names. For example, "elementary school" is not called "école primaire" in an English school, but has the same grading system.

===Grade structure by province===

Notes:
*In British Columbia some schools may group together the higher Elementary and lower Secondary Grades. These schools are referred to as Middle Schools or Jr. Secondary Schools. Some Elementary Schools consist solely of grades K-5. Likewise, some Secondary Schools may only have grades 11 and 12. In addition, some school districts may use just elementary (K-7) and secondary (8-12) schools. British Columbia informally subcategorizes the Elementary level into "Primary" (K-3) and "Intermediate" (4-6 or 7).
*In Ontario, the terms used in French schooling consist of Maternelle in regards to Junior Kindergarten, Kindergarten is then referred to as Jardin. This differs from Quebec's Maternelle which is the equivalent of Ontario's Kindergarten.
*In Manitoba, grade-9 - grade 12 was for a short time referred to as Senior 1-Senior 4; In Newfoundland, Level IV is used to collect missed grades that prevented a student from getting their graduation.
*In Nova Scotia the terms for groups, and grades they apply to varies significantly throughout the province.  A common, but not universal, organization is shown.
*In Quebec college is two or three years, depending on what a student selects, based usually on what their post-secondary plans are.  College in Quebec overlaps what other provinces consider the boundary between secondary education (high school) and post-secondary education (college and university).   "Sec I" = "Secondary Year One" = "Grade 7"
*In Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, schools are now set up as elementary schools with grades K-5, middle schools with grades 6-8, and high schools with grades 9-12. However, high school graduation requirements only include courses taken in grades 10-12.
*In Saskatchewan Elementary school is most often from K-8 and high school from 9-12. High school graduation requirements only taken grades 10-12 and require 24 credits to graduate.

Retrieved November 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Many see this as a result of the phasing out of the [[Ontario Academic Credit|OAC year]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thespec.com/article/173675 'Victory lap' year carries no stigma]. Retrieved November 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{note|QS|grade names}} – In most English high schools, the different terms are used interchangeably. In some English high schools, as well as in most French schools, high school students will refer to secondary 1–5 as year one through five.  So if someone in Secondary three is asked "what grade/year are you in?" they will reply "three" or "sec 3", or "grade 9".  It is presumed that the person asking the question knows that they are referring not to "Grade 3" but "Secondary 3".  However, this can be confusing for those who are asking the question from outside of Quebec.

He also wrote and illustrated books about [[cartooning]] and comic art.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
McLaughlin was raised in [[Stratford, Connecticut]],&lt;ref name=cba87&gt;{{cite journal|title= Frank McLaughln interview|journal= [[Comic Book Artist]]|issue=9|page=87|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|location= Raleigh, North Carolina|date=August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up inspired by the work of such magazine illustrators as [[Coby Whitmore]], [[Joseph Bowler|Joe Bowler]] and [[Howard Terpning]], as well as such earlier illustrators as [[Gustav Klimt]] and [[Alfons Mucha]], and such comic-strip artists such as [[Alex Raymond]] and [[Milton Caniff]].&lt;ref name=cba84&gt;''Comic Book Artist'', p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied art at the [[University of Bridgeport]] and the [[Southern Connecticut State University|New Haven State Teachers College]], both in Connecticut.&lt;ref name=cba84 /&gt; McLaughlin's first professional art job, at "about 17," was drawing belt buckles for a [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]] manufacturer's catalog.&lt;ref name=cba85/&gt;

After college, McLaughlin, an avid baseball player, went to work for the brake manufacturer [[Raybestos]], where he played for its internationally ranked fast-pitch softball team.&lt;ref name=cba85/&gt; After a year there, he was [[military conscription|drafted]] into the [[United States Army|U. S. Army]], then returned to civilian life as a technical illustrator for [[Sikorsky Aircraft]].&lt;ref name=cba85/&gt;

McLaughlin entered the comic book industry in the early 1960s. A college friend recommended him to editor [[Pat Masulli]] at [[Charlton Comics]] in [[Derby, Connecticut]], who hired McLaughlin as his assistant. "There were no art directors or assistant editors or any other job titles", McLaughlin said in a 2000 interview.&lt;ref name=cba85/&gt; "[I did] everything from [[proofreading]] to art corrections, lettering titles for [editor] [[Ernie Hart]]'s books, traffic managing, liaison with the [[Comics Code]], and anything else, including cleaning the storeroom".&lt;ref name=cba85&gt;''Comic Book Artist'', p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; He did occasional, uncredited inking on late comic books, including on "a couple" of stories by [[Steve Ditko]].&lt;ref name=cba86&gt;''Comic Book Artist'', p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

Creator credits were not routinely given in comics during this era, and McLaughlin's earliest known probable credit is [[inker|inking]] [[penciler]] [[Dick Giordano]] on the cover of, and a seven-page story in, Charlton's ''Battlefield Action'' #39 (Dec. 1961).&lt;ref name=gcd/&gt; McLaughlin's first confirmed credit is full pencil and ink art on the five-page story "And the Light Shall Come" in the same publisher's ''Reptisaurus'' #8 (Dec. 1962).&lt;ref name=gcd/&gt;

Giordano later became Charlton's editor after, McLaughlin said, he himself had turned down the job: "[Giordano] was a freelancer at the time, and then he hired me to work with him after I got through working at Charlton 9 to 5, and I'd go over to his studio, and then later on, we kind of swapped jobs, because there was a change at Charlton, and I think Pat [Masulli] was moving up, and they offered me his job. I opted to stay freelance and suggested Dick for the job. He became editor and I took over the studio," which artist [[Jon D'Agostino]] and writer [[Joe Gill]] would soon join.&lt;ref name=cba85/&gt;

===Judomaster===
McLaughlin, who became Charlton's [[art director]] by 1962,&lt;ref name=gcd&gt;[http://www.comics.org/credit/name/Frank%20McLaughlin/sort/chrono/ Frank McLaughlin] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]&lt;/ref&gt; worked throughout the Charlton line, including on the [[superhero]] titles ''[[Blue Beetle]]'', ''[[Captain Atom]]'', and ''[[Son of Vulcan]]'', the adventure comic ''[[The Fightin' 5]]'', the supernatural/science-fiction anthologies ''[[Strange Suspense Stories]]'' and ''Mysteries of Unexplored Worlds'', and the [[spy fiction|espionage]] comic ''[[Sarge Steel]]'', where [[martial artist]] McLaughlin's backup features, "The Sport of [[Judo]]" and "What is [[Karate]]?," presaged the original character he would create with writer Joe Gill.&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;
[[Image:SpecialWarSeries4.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Judomaster's debut: ''Special War Series'' #4 (Nov. 1965). The series title is visible diagonally within the red logo box. Cover art by McLaughlin&lt;!--confirmed both pencils &amp; inks per GCD--&gt;]]

That character, [[Judomaster]], debuted in ''Special War Series'' #4 (Nov. 1965), the final issue of that series, and continued in his own series, beginning with ''Judomaster'' #89 (June 1966), taking over the numbering of the defunct [[Western comics|Western]] series ''Gunmaster''. The series, which McLaughlin almost immediately began scripting as well, starred an American soldier in the [[Pacific Ocean Theater of World War II|South Pacific]] during [[World War II]], who, after saving a native island girl from a [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] sniper, was taught martial arts by her grateful grandfather. He acquired a costume based on the [[Rising Sun Flag|Japanese military flag]], and, in issue #93 (Feb. 1967), a sidekick, [[Avatar (comics)|Tiger]]. The series ended at #98 (Dec. 1967), and the character was later purchased by [[DC Comics]] in 1983, during Charlton's final years.&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toonopedia.com/judomstr.htm Judomaster] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]. [https://www.webcitation.org/62hbzoSx6?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/judomstr.htm Archived] from the original on October 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marvel and DC===
Following McLaughlin's final Charlton work, penciling the cover and both penciling and inking the seven-page story "The Living Legend" in the [[comic strip]] spin-off comic book ''[[The Phantom]]'' #30 (Feb. 1969), McLaughlin began to freelance. After a smattering of work that including inking an eight-page teen humor story in [[DC Comics]]' ''Debbi's Dates'' #10 (Nov. 1970) and a seven-page story in [[Warren Publishing]]'s black-and-white horror-comics magazine ''[[Eerie]]'' #34 (July 1971), McLaughlin circa 1971 began assisting comic-strip artist [[Stan Drake]] on the [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalistic]] [[soap-opera]] strip ''[[The Heart of Juliet Jones]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Leiffer; Ware, [http://www.bpib.com/comicsproj/biogM1.html McLaughlin, Frank], "Who's Who of American Comic Strip Producers: Who's Who Update". Retrieved December 20, 2010. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609013425/http://www.bpib.com/comicsproj/biogM1.html |date=June 9, 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; McLaughlin, at Giordano's suggestion, had shown samples of his work to the [[Westport, Connecticut]]-based Drake, who hired him to succeed assistant [[Tex Blaisdell]], who had left to draw ''[[Little Orphan Annie]]''. "I would pencil and ink just about everything that wasn't a main figure," McLaughlin said.&lt;ref name=cba84 /&gt;

The following year, McLaughlin began to work steadily for industry leaders [[DC Comics]] and [[Marvel Comics]]. His first work for the former was inking  [[Win Mortimer]] on a [[Zatanna]] story in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #421 (July 1972), and his first for the latter was inking [[Jim Mooney]] on a [[romance comics]] story in ''Our Love Story'' #18 (Aug. 1972).&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;

Settling into his career as an inker, McLaughlin became ensconced at Marvel, inking the likes of [[Wayne Boring]] on ''[[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]]'' and [[Sal Buscema]] on both ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' and ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'' before becoming primarily a DC inker. Throughout the 1970s, McLaughlin inked backup stories featuring the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]], [[Black Lightning]], Zatanna, and "The Fabulous World of [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]", among others. He became the regular series inker for penciler [[Dick Dillin]]'s ''[[Justice League of America]]'', and for some issues of penciler [[Ernie Chan]]'s [[Batman]] stories in ''[[Detective Comics]]'', and [[Joe Staton]]'s ''[[Green Lantern (comic book)|Green Lantern]]''. Concurrently, he wrote martial-arts articles for Marvel's black-and-white comics magazine ''[[The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu]]''.&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;

In the 1980s McLaughlin was regular inker on penciler [[Carmine Infantino]]'s ''[[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]'', [[Gene Colan]]'s ''[[Wonder Woman]]'', and [[Dan Jurgens]]' ''[[Green Arrow]]'', among other assignments. He also inked [[Steve Ditko]] on the first two issues of [[A.C.E. Comics]]' short-lived series ''What Is...The Face?'' (Dec. 1986 and April 1987), and for the same company wrote, co-penciled and co-inked the single issue of ''Big Edsel Band'' (Sept. 1987), starring the modern-day retro-1950s band.&lt;ref name= gcd /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.philly.com/1987-08-10/news/26170070_1_comic-book-comic-superheroes-band-members |title=Big Edsel Band's on Stage and on Comic-Book Page |date=August 10, 1987 |first=Ann |last=Kolson |work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |accessdate=August 16, 2012 |archivedate=August 16, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69xkK9QZN?url=http://articles.philly.com/1987-08-10/news/26170070_1_comic-book-comic-superheroes-band-members |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the following decade, while continuing to draw for DC, McLaughlin expanded to [[Acclaim Comics]] and [[Broadway Comics]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2797">'''Gregory Ivy''' (1904–1985) was chairman of the art department at Woman's College, now the [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro]], from 1935 to 1961. He was born on May 7, 1904, in Clarksburg Missouri, to Bennet Monroe Ivy and Fanni B. Dowler.

== Education ==
He attended Tipton High School in Tipton, Missouri, where he graduated in 1922. In 1926, Ivy received a general diploma from the State Teachers College (now Central Missouri State University) in Warrensville, Missouri where he completed his bachelor of science degree from the same college, with majors in art and history and a minor in economics. After graduating in 1928, Ivy taught junior and senior high school art classes in St. Louis, beginning a long career as an artist and a teacher.

In 1931 Ivy received his M.A. from Teachers College at Columbia University in New York. He majored in painting and minored in design. From 1932 to 1935, he taught at the States Teachers College in Indiana, PA (now Indiana University of Pennsylvania) before accepting a position as head of the art department at Woman’s College in Greensboro, NC in 1935, where he was instrumental in founding and developing the art department and establishing The Weatherspoon Art Gallery.

While at Woman’s College, Gregory Ivy helped start the MFA program, which until 1950, was the only art department in North Carolina to have both MFA and BFA degrees. Ivy also introduced the first industrial design class in the United States for college women. He was president of the Southeastern College Art Conference of college art teachers, and appointed director of the Burnsville School of Fine Arts in 1952.

Ivy resigned from Woman’s College in 1961 and he and his wife moved to California in 1965 where he had accepted a position as an art professor and chairman of the art department at [[California State University, Fullerton|California State College at Fullerton]]. He retired in 1971 and moved to Springfield, Missouri where he died in 1985.

Gregory Ivy's work has been exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum, State Art Gallery in Raleigh, the Mint Museum, Art Institute of Chicago, and the Weatherspoon Art Museum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9533">'''Human performance technology''' ('''HPT'''), also known as '''human performance improvement''' ('''HPI'''), or '''human performance assessment''' ('''HPA'''), is a field of study related to process improvement methodologies such as [[lean management]], [[Six Sigma]], [[lean Six Sigma]], [[organization development]], [[motivation]], [[instructional technology]], [[human factors]], [[learning]], performance support systems, [[knowledge management]], and [[training]].  It is focused on improving performance at the societal, organizational, process, and individual performer levels. 

HPT "uses a wide range of interventions that are drawn from many other disciplines, including total quality management, process improvement, behavioral psychology, instructional systems design, organizational development, and human resources management" (ISPI, 2007). It stresses a rigorous analysis of requirements at the societal, organizational process and individual levels as appropriate to identify the causes for performance gaps, provide appropriate interventions to improve and sustain performance, and finally to evaluate the results against the requirements.

==History of HPT==
The field of HPT, also referred to as Performance Improvement, emerged from the fields of [[educational technology]] and [[instructional technology]] in the 1950s and 1960s. In the post war period, application of the Instructional Systems Design (ISD) model was not consistently returning the desired improvements to organizational performance. This led the emergence of HPT as a separate field from ISD in the late 1960s to early 1970s when the National Society for Programmed Instruction was renamed the National Society for Performance and Instruction (NSPI) and then again to the International Society for Performance Improvement (ISPI) in 1995. (Chyung, 2008) HPT evolved as a systemic and systematic approach to address complex types of performance issues and to assist in the proper diagnosis and implementation of solutions to close performance gaps among individuals.

The origins of HPT can be primarily traced back to the work of [[Thomas Gilbert (engineer)|Thomas Gilbert]], Geary Rummler, Karen Brethower, [[Roger Kaufman]], Bob Mager, Donald Tosti, Lloyd Homme and Joe Harless.  They (Gilbert and Rummler in particular) were the pioneers of the field. Any serious investigation of early and later citations of Gilbert and Rummler's work will reveal subsequent academic and professional leaders in the field.

A major factor in the rise to prominence of what would become HPT was the publication of ''Analyzing Performance Problems'' in 1970 by [[Robert F. Mager]] and Peter Pipe.  The success of their book, subtitled "You Really Oughta Wanna," served to draw attention to and expand awareness of the many factors affecting human performance in addition to the knowledge and skills of the performer.  The Further Reading section of the 1970 edition of their book also cites a seminal paper by Karen S. Brethower: "Maintenance Systems: The Neglected Half of Behavior Change," which contains an early version of a performance deficiency analysis algorithm developed by Geary Rummler, then at the University of Michigan.  Rummler, along with Tom Gilbert, would go on to found Praxis Corporation, a firm focused on improving performance.  Later, Rummler would join forces with Alan Brache and the two of them would author ''Improving Performance'', with a clear and expanded focus on process and organizational performance. In a related vein, Joe Harless was at work developing and refining his own approach to expanding and refining the way problems of human performance were being approached.  In 1970, the same year Mager &amp; Pipe published their landmark book, Harless, with the assistance of his associate and another notable in the field, Claude Lineberry, published ''An Ounce of Analysis'' (Is Worth A Pound of Objectives).  This was the beginning of what became known as "Front-End Analysis (FEA)."

HPT professionals work in many different performance settings such as corporate, educational institutions, and the military (Bolin, 2007).

==Definitions of the field==
The International Society for Performance Improvement defines HPT as:

"a systematic approach to improving productivity and competence, uses a set of methods and procedures -- and a strategy for solving problems -- for realizing opportunities related to the performance of people. More specific, it is a process of selection, analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation of programs to most cost-effectively influence human behavior and accomplishment. It is a systematic combination of three fundamental processes: performance analysis, cause analysis, and intervention selection, and can be applied to individuals, small groups, and large organizations."(ISPI, 2012)

A simpler definition of HPT is a systematic approach to improving individual and organizational performance (Pershing, 2006).

A common misunderstanding of the word technology with regards to HPT is that it relates to information technologies. In HPT, technology refers to the specialized aspects of the field of Human Performance. Technology: the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, esp. in industry. A branch of knowledge dealing with engineering or applied science. 

The International Society for Performance Improvement has developed a [http://community.ispi.org/WGAlphabeticalTab/ glossary] of HPT related terms.

== Characteristics of HPT ==

* HPT is based on the assumption that human performance is lawful, drawing principles from numerous fields including psychology, systems theory, engineering and business management (Chyung, 2008).
* HPT is empirical, using observations and experiments to inform decision making (Chyung, 2008).
* HPT is results oriented, producing measureable and cost effective changes in performance (Chyung, 2008).
* HPT is reactive and proactive in situations involving human performance to:
::* reduce or eliminate barriers to desired performance (reactive);
::* prevent the conditions allowing barriers to performance (proactive); and
::* improve the quality of current performance  (reactive and proactive)(Chyung, 2008).
* HPT uses both systematic and systemic approaches to solving performance problems (Chyung, 2008).
* HPT considers various interventions (such as [[Lean manufacturing|lean]] and [[six sigma]] mentioned above) that will assist in achieving desired goals (Stolovitch and Keeps, 1999).

==HPT Model==
An HPT Model is available for viewing at the ispi.org [http://www.ispi.org/images/HPT-Model/HPT-Model-2012.jpg] website.

==Standards of Practice==
The International Society for Performance Improvement (ISPI) codified a series of [http://www.ispi.org/uploadedFiles/ISPI_Site/About_ISPI/About/Standards.pdf Standards] in an effort to raise the quality of HPT practice:

* Focus on Results
* Take a Systems View
* Add Value
* Utilize Partnerships
* Systematic Assessment of Need or Opportunity
* Systematic Cause Analysis
* Systematic Design
* Systematic Development
* Systematic Implementation
* Systematic Evaluation

'''Ian D'Sa''' (born October 30, 1975&lt;ref&gt;http://www.discogs.com/artist/859989-Ian-DSa&lt;/ref&gt;) is an English-born Canadian guitarist for the band [[Billy Talent]]. He is of [[Goan]] background.

==Early life and career==
Ian was born in the suburb of [[Southall]], [[London]] UK. His family moved to Canada when he was 3 years old. He grew up in [[Mississauga]], Ontario learning guitar at the age of 13. He attended [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel Secondary School]]. In 1991 he formed a band named Dragonflower with some fellow schoolmates. After Dragonflower broke up he formed another band named Soluble Fish and recorded a five song demo entitled Nugget Sauces.  He eventually met [[Benjamin Kowalewicz]], [[Jonathan Gallant]] and [[Aaron Solowoniuk]] in 1993 at a high school talent show.  He started a new band with them named Pezz (later to become "[[Billy Talent]]") while also playing in Soluble Fish. Both bands played shows together until Soluble Fish broke up in 1996. Still playing with Pezz, D'Sa went to [[Sheridan College]] where he got his degree in classical animation and has worked on the TV shows ''[[Angela Anaconda]]'', ''[[Birdz]]'', and the film ''Adventures in 3-D IMAX'' as a character animator. Pezz changed their name to Billy Talent a few years later in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061020025841/http://www.fm96.com/station/ongoing_history_of_new_music.cfm?recID=151&amp;ell=8943&amp;pge=1 The Ongoing History of New Music]. "Before They Were Famous" ''Original Broadcast date: 13-11-05 on '''[[CFNY]]'''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Billy Talent==
In 1998 Pezz changed their name to Billy Talent after the fictional character in Micheal Turner's Hard Core Logo book (later adapted to film by Bruce McDonald). D'Sa co-produced [[Billy Talent II]] with [[Gavin Brown (musician)|Gavin Brown]]. He also did art direction and package design on the album. He received co-direction credit for the video "Fallen Leaves", for which the band was awarded Best Video and Best Rock Video at the [[2007 MuchMusic Video Awards]]. Released in September 2012, the fourth album of the band, ''[[Dead Silence (album)|Dead Silence]]'', was produced entirely by D'Sa. He was nominated for [[Jack Richardson Producer of the Year Award|Producer of the Year]] at the [[Juno Awards of 2017|2017 Juno Awards]] for his work on the band's fifth album, ''[[Afraid of Heights (Billy Talent album)|Afraid of Heights]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

D'Sa produced his first two singles on [[Die Mannequin]]'s EP [[Slaughter Daughter]], the songs being "Do it or Die" and "Saved By Strangers". He played guitar on [[Sarah Slean]]'s song "Lucky Me". He makes a cameo in [[The Operation M.D.]]'s single "Sayonara" as a doctor pushing [[Steve Jocz|Stevo]] in a wheelchair. He also makes a brief cameo as a year book photo in the [[K-OS]] video for ELEctrik HeaT – The Seekwill. He also sang guest vocals with [[Alexisonfire]] during a few live shows. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

D'Sa is known for making unexpected appearances at other bands' live shows and to guest as vocalist sometimes with [[Alexisonfire]]. He joined [[Sum 41]] as a guest guitarist for a one-off performance of their popular encore song "Pain for Pleasure", and also performed as a guest in one show with UK band [[Reuben (band)|Reuben]] in 2006, while the band supported [[Billy Talent]]. He produced the first single "Buried at Sea" from [[The Operation M.D.]]'s second studio album ''[[Birds + Bee Stings]]'', which was released on June 29, 2010. D'Sa has been involved with [[Song for Africa]] since 2007, a project to connect Canada's youth to the AIDS pandemic, playing guitar on the song and in the video and single. In July 2007 he traveled to Kenya, Africa for 10 days to be part of the [[Song for Africa]] Documentary film. Ian also wrote and recorded the song "Land of a Thousand Hills" for the benefit album ''[[Song for Africa - Rwanda: Rises Up!]]'', in which he sings lead vocals and plays guitar with Canadian [[punk rock]] band Noble Blood. In November 2012, he contributed a guitar solo to the song "Toast to Freedom" recorded by Anti-Flag for Amnesty International as a benefit single. He played solo in the video for the song. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}} He and fellow Billy Talent bandmate [[Ben Kowalewicz]] also appeared in the music video for [[Emigrate (band)|Emigrate's]] "1234", whom Ben provided co-lead vocals for.

==Musical equipment==
When playing live shows, D'Sa plays an Olympic White [[Fender Stratocaster|Fender Stratocaster Fat Strat Deluxe]] with a black pickguard loaded with Seymour Duncan JB Trembucker pickups. He also plays a Montego Black Stratocaster Fat Strat Deluxe with a red [[pickguard]] loaded with Seymour Duncan JB Trembucker pickups. When recording in the studio, his favourite guitars are a '52 [[Fender Telecaster]] Reissue (nicknamed "Crispy Chicken"), a '72 [[Fender Telecaster Deluxe]] (nicknamed "Rooster"), a '57 [[Gibson Les Paul Junior]] and several other vintage guitars. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

D'Sa has said that "Crispy Chicken" is one of his main recording guitars, and has been used on all five Billy Talent albums along with other guitars such as his '57 Junior, for overdubs. He also owns a three colour sunburst stratocaster with a white pick guard, which is shown in the "[[Devil in a Midnight Mass]]" music video. His main live amp setup consists of a 60 watt head custom made by Mark Stephenson of Stephenson Amplification in 2002, along with a [[Diezel]] VH4.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuiMWUaU4MA YouTube]; accessed September 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ignition''' is a transition and mentorship program that is implemented in [[high school]]s across the United States.  The program was developed and [[trademark]]ed by Focus Training, a [[leadership]] development company in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]].  The goal of Ignition is to build student relationships and make transition from [[middle school]] to [[high school]] a positive experience for [[student]]s, [[Academic administration|administrators]], and [[teachers]].&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://transition.focustraining.com/about-us/purpose/ Purpose].&lt;/ref&gt;  The program utilizes upperclassmen to act as [[mentor]]s to incoming [[freshmen]] for the entire 9th grade school year.  Mentors help freshmen acclimate to the high school environment, deal with the challenges of the new school, and learn successful behaviors.  As of 2010 the Ignition program is implemented at over 220 schools nationwide and serves over 100,000 students and educators.
''

==Ignition Stages==

Step 1 Consult - Professional Development, Training and Consulting for Staff.&lt;ref name="best"&gt;[http://transition.focustraining.com/ignition/what-is-ignition/ Ignition Steps].&lt;/ref&gt;

FOCUS Training works with a team of educators to build a program that fits each school’s needs by considering mentor recruitment, time, space, budget, class size, related program and learning objectives. This stage teaches Ignition advisors how to run each aspect of the program.

Step 2 Synergize – Professional Development and Organizational Structure for Mentors.

At this phase recruited Ignition mentors learn how to do their job by developing leadership skills, understanding how to manage the organization, and planning for a full year of mentorship and activities. At the conclusion of this day committees have formed, and each committee has several well developed goals to guide their efforts in preparation the first day.

Step 3 Train – Facilitation Training for Mentors and Preparation for Orientation.

Mentors learn how to facilitate the low [[ropes course]] activities and manage all aspects of the Ignite and Fuel activities. Mentors learn how to provide safe, interactive, and educational training for their team of new students.

Step 4 Ignite – Orientation Day.

The first day of school which presents new freshmen with an exciting introduction to high school.  Students undergo various [[team building]] activities including: an adventure course, large group activities, a mock schedule, and an assembly.

Step 5 Fuel – Comprehensive Social and Academic Skill Curriculum.

This year-long curriculum includes 60 teaching guides and supporting documentation that help mentors facilitate small group activities and discussions about topics that affect new students. These include: study habits, involvement, respect, exams, career exploration, healthy choices, test taking, tolerance and [[bullying]], body image, and more. Mentors meet with new students two to four times per month.

Step 6 Refresh – Ongoing training for mentors and preparation for next year.

In this stage Ignition Advisors and mentors work out any first semester challenges and continue to improve the program overall. It is a time for mentors to sharpen their facilitation skills and prepare for successful Fuel activities for the second semester. All preparations for next year will also be organized.

The '''International Student Identity Card''' ('''ISIC''') is an [[identity card]] and [[discount card]] issued by the ISIC Association to students, and offers discounts for travel, insurance, and various goods. The ISIC Association also issues International Youth Travel Card (IYTC) for non-students, and International Teacher Identity Card (ITIC) for teachers and professors. The membership fee varies by countries. In the [[United Kingdom]] it costs £12.00 a year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.statravel.co.uk/discount-cards.htm?wt.srch=1&amp;wt.mc_id=PPC&amp;gclid=CjwKEAjwmf6-BRDi9fSN7Ijt1wUSJAASawcjZcwlSh0xe8Rww2jVrUEtJBqJCovKren3QN5xzc35fRoCnLjw_wcB&lt;/ref&gt;

The card is recognized internationally. An ISIC card can only be issued to genuine bona fide students. ISIC cardholders can use the card to identify themselves as a student around the world.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The ISIC card is managed and administered by the ISIC Association. The objective of the ISIC Association is to help improve intercultural understanding and increase education opportunities. The ISIC card is issued in 133 countries.

==ISIC Association==
The ISIC Association is one of eight sector associations of the [https://www.wysetc.org/sector-associations/ WYSE Travel Confederation]. It manages and administers the International Student Identity Card (ISIC).  The ISIC Association is a non-profit membership organisation legally registered in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;[[ISIC Association]] (2011), “2011 Annual Report of the ISIC Association”, p1 {{cite web |url=https://extranet.isic.org/annual-report-2011 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021033509/https://extranet.isic.org/annual-report-2011 |archivedate=2013-10-21 |df= }} rel="nofollow"&lt;/ref&gt; The members are the organisations that hold the exclusive rights to distribute, promote and develop the ISIC card within their territory or country.&lt;ref&gt;[[ISIC Association]] (2011), “2011 Annual Report of the ISIC Association”, p8 {{cite web |url=https://extranet.isic.org/annual-report-2011 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021033509/https://extranet.isic.org/annual-report-2011 |archivedate=2013-10-21 |df= }} rel="nofollow"&lt;/ref&gt; These organisations are referred to as ‘ISIC Exclusive Representatives’. Exclusive Representatives include student travel organisations, national student unions and dedicated ISIC card development organisations.

The ISIC card is administered and managed at a global level by the ISIC Global Office B.V.. The ISIC Global Office B.V. is a company seated in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The ISIC Global Office B.V. is wholly owned by the ISIC Association.&lt;ref&gt;[[ISIC Association]] (2011), “2011 Annual Report of the ISIC Association”, p1 {{cite web |url=https://extranet.isic.org/annual-report-2011 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021033509/https://extranet.isic.org/annual-report-2011 |archivedate=2013-10-21 |df= }} rel="nofollow"&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the ISIC card==
[[File:ISIC 1981.jpg|thumb|200px|ISIC (1981)]]

===Formation of the ISIC card===
Following World War II and the Cold War, the Western world was focused on mutual cooperation and understanding in order to prevent a resurgence of fascism.  This atmosphere gave impetus for student organisations to form, with the aim of working together for peace and cooperation throughout the world.  
One such student organisation, the International Student Conference (ISC) held their 3rd ISC at the Studenterforeningen’s Hus in Copenhagen. It was attended by National Unions of Students and Coordinating Secretariat of National Unions of Students (COSEC), Denmark, amongst others. The attending student organisations made the decision to establish a single international identity document valid for the perceived need of travel concessions. This is the first documented mention of the International Student Identity Card (ISIC).&lt;ref&gt;[[Swiss National Union of Students, Foreign Office]] (1954), “Report on International Student Travel Conference 1954, Zurich – Switzerland October 20th – 23rd, 1954”, p55 rel="nofollow"&lt;/ref&gt;
Representatives of the ISC were also representatives of the International Student Travel Conference (ISTC). At the 4th International Student Travel Conference (ISTC), and following the decision made at the 3rd International Student Conference (ISC), the Norwegian and Netherlands Union of Students, in co-operation with COSEC, presented a document based on a Survey of the Council of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Swiss National Union of Students, Foreign Office]] (1954), “Report on International Student Travel Conference 1954, Zurich – Switzerland October 20th – 23rd, 1954”, p56 rel="nofollow"&lt;/ref&gt; The document concluded that the formation of an international student card would be of benefit to students while travelling. The Norwegian and Netherlands Union of Students, in co-operation with COSEC accepted responsibility to form a Travel Aids Commission and “take the necessary steps to ensure that an International Student Identity Card be made available as soon as possible in as large a part of the world as possible”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Swiss National Union of Students, Foreign Office]] (1954), “Report on International Student Travel Conference 1954, Zurich – Switzerland October 20th – 23rd, 1954”, p179&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the International Student Identity Card was founded with the aim to provide students worldwide with access to student facilities, wherever they travelled.  It was agreed that the real value of the card would prove that the holder was a “bona fide” student.&lt;ref&gt;[[Swiss National Union of Students, Foreign Office]] (1954), “Report on International Student Travel Conference 1954, Zurich – Switzerland October 20th – 23rd, 1954”, p57&lt;/ref&gt;  The first ISIC cards were produced by the Travel Aids Commission managed by the ISTC. 56,000 cards were issued amongst 31 countries in the first year.&lt;ref&gt;[[Swiss National Union of Students, Foreign Office]] (1954), “Report on International Student Travel Conference 1954, Zurich – Switzerland October 20th – 23rd, 1954”, p146&lt;/ref&gt;

===UNESCO Endorsement 1968===
From 1955 UNESCO joined the International Student Travel Conference and supported the ISIC card.  In 1968 UNESCO issued an official endorsement in full support of the ISIC card.  UNESCO recognised the ISIC card as the only internationally accepted proof of full-time student status and a unique document encouraging cultural exchange and international understanding. A renewed Memorandum of Understanding was signed in 1993. The UNESCO logo has appeared on the ISIC card since 1993.

===UN World Tourism Organization===
In October 2013 the ISIC Association was officially appointed as an Affiliate Member of the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO).

===ISIC – travel to lifestyle===
In the new millennium the need for a student card orientated to travel concessions was becoming less relevant than before due to societal changes such as worldwide economic decline, introduction of budget airlines, online flight booking and direct airline sales. Due to this decline, it was identified that the ISIC card and focus must be repositioned. Up until 2001, the ISIC card existed as a travel card and a student identity card but it was agreed that the discount aspect must be utilised and the card refocused as an everyday student lifestyle card.

==ISIC card distribution==
ISIC Exclusive Representatives, who have the exclusive rights to issue ISIC cards in their respective countries, make up a global distribution network for ISIC cards. The ISIC card is available in 130 countries.  In each country, the ISIC Exclusive Representative is exclusively responsible for ISIC card distribution, promotion and development, including the development and managing a portfolio of local and national discounts and services available to the ISIC holders.&lt;ref&gt;[[ISIC Association]] (2011), “2011 Annual Report of the ISIC Association”, p10 {{cite web |url=https://extranet.isic.org/annual-report-2011 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021033509/https://extranet.isic.org/annual-report-2011 |archivedate=2013-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ISIC card today==
Eligibility for an ISIC card is restricted to bona fide students engaged in higher or tertiary education and students in full-time secondary education. Students must be a minimum of 12 years old to be eligible. There is no upper age limit for an ISIC card.&lt;ref&gt;[[ISIC Association]] (1954) “Constitution of the ISIC Association”&lt;/ref&gt;
An ISIC card is valid for 16 months. The validity period of an ISIC card corresponds to  the academic year in the country of purchase.  For example, in countries where the academic year starts in September (e.g. countries in the Northern Hemisphere), the ISIC card is valid from 1 September to 31 December the following year.  In countries with the academic year begins in December (e.g. countries in the Southern Hemisphere), the ISIC card is valid from 1 December to 31 March, 16 months later.&lt;ref&gt;[[ISIC Association]] (1954) “Constitution of the ISIC Association”&lt;/ref&gt;
There is an advised national retail selling price for the ISIC card in each country where the card is issued. The card price in each country is determined by the value of the ISIC in the local market and the countries economic development level.

==ISIC Cards “combined‘’ with bank or college cards==
An ISIC card can be combined with a bank or university card. This creates a unique combined card with the aim to reach and provide services to a common or overlapping market.  Currently 102 banks and more than 839 universities worldwide have merged their cards with the ISIC card.&lt;ref&gt;[[ISIC Association]] (2011), “2011 Annual Report of the ISIC Association”, p8 {{cite web |url=https://extranet.isic.org/annual-report-2011 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021033509/https://extranet.isic.org/annual-report-2011 |archivedate=2013-10-21 |df= }} rel="nofollow"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endorsement of the ISIC==
The ISIC card is endorsed and supported as an official proof of student status by various organisations and institutions locally, regionally, nationally and internationally. Organisations that endorse the ISIC card include national governments, ministries of education and tourism, universities, other academic institutions and student organisations internationally.

==ISIC Award==
The ISIC Award was introduced by the ISIC Association in 2011. The ISIC Award recognises and rewards organisations working on a global scale to reduce social, economic and cultural barriers and increase access to education. The ISIC Award is awarded annually.
Through the ISIC card the ISIC Association aims to ensure individuals who aspire to participate in higher education have the help and resources to enable them to do so. The intention of the ISIC Award is to support existing education accessibility initiatives.
The ISIC Award winner is nominated and selected by the ISIC card distributors worldwide. Nominees for the ISIC Award can be a non-government organisation, institution, association, or similar organisation that are able to clearly demonstrate a commitment to making education more accessible. 
The ISIC Award winner receives a financial contribution to support the continuation of their work to increase access to education. Previous award winners include AIESEC International (2011), the International Association of Universities (IAU) (2012), the [[University of the People]] (2013), and the Institute of International Education (2014).

==History==
Her keel was laid by [[Sumitomo Heavy Industries]] on July 8, 1988 at the [[Uraga, Kanagawa|Uraga]] shipyard, near [[Yokohama]], Japan. She was launched on March 7, 1989. ''Kaiwo Maru'' was commissioned on September 12, 1989.&lt;ref name="kaiwo-outline"/&gt; She is a four masted barque, over 110 meters in length, with a complement of 199.&lt;ref name="kaiwo-spec"&gt;[http://www.kohkun.go.jp/kaiwomaru_e/specification.html "Specification of Kaiwo Maru," National Institute for Sea Training]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128211059/http://www.kohkun.go.jp/kaiwomaru_e/specification.html |date=January 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She is a sister ship of [[Nippon Maru (1984)|''Nippon Maru'']].

On 20 Oct. 2004, ''Kaiwo Maru'' was nearly lost in [[2004 Pacific typhoon season#Typhoon Tokage .28Siony.29|Typhoon Tokage]], while sheltering outside the port of Fushiki in the Bay of [[Toyama Prefecture|Toyama]], Japan. She dragged her anchor and grounded on a breakwater, receiving severe damage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.toyama-cmt.ac.jp/~mkawai/toyamabay/s2006_05/kaiwo/kaiworeport.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asahi.com/english/nation/TKY200410220144.html&lt;/ref&gt; Her crew of 167, mostly young cadets, was evacuated.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifrc.org/fr/news-and-media/news-stories/asia-pacific/japan/daring-red-cross-rescue-as-typhoon-battered-japan/&lt;/ref&gt; Helicopters responded, but were unable to drop lines. So rescuers fixed ropes to the breakwater and crewmembers climbed along them. Thirty were injured, including some with broken bones.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mlit.go.jp/jtsb/kai/maiadigest/digest-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Her captain later accepted responsibility. A month later she was lifted by a floating crane and returned to [[Uraga, Kanagawa|Uraga]] shipyard. The ship sailed again in January 2006 after major repairs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kohkun.go.jp/en/aboutus/history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kaiwo Maru'' is a regular participant in international tall ship gatherings such as [[Operation Sail]] and is a multiple winner of the [[Boston Teapot Trophy]].&lt;ref name="kaiwo-teapot"&gt;[http://www.kohkun.go.jp/tallship_e/bostonteapot.html "Boston Teapot Trophy," National Institute for Sea Training]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127162252/http://www.kohkun.go.jp/tallship_e/bostonteapot.html |date=January 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, ''Kaiwo Maru'' visited [[San Francisco]], [[California]] to commemorate the 1860 voyage of the ''[[Kanrin Maru]]'', the first Japanese ship to officially visit the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="sfgate"&gt;{{cite news | author=Carl Nolte | title=Japanese ship docks in wake of momentous voyage | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/05/08/BA861DA7PA.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | date=May 8, 2010 | accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 90 percent of the journey was made under sail, and they brought one passenger, a retired businessman who is descended from one of the original ''Kanrin Maru'' crew members.

In March 2011, ''Kaiwo Maru'' was on a voyage from Japan to [[Honolulu, Hawaii]] when an [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|earthquake and tsunami]] struck Japan. She was subsequently diverted to [[Ōkuma, Fukushima]] where she served as accommodation for workers tackling the [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents|nuclear crisis]] at the [[Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant]].&lt;ref name=Telegraph8408863&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/8408863/Japan-tsunami-Fukushima-Fifty-the-first-interview.html |title=Japan tsunami: Fukushima Fifty, the first interview | work=The Telegraph |first1=Andrew |last1=Gilligan |first2=Robert |last2=Mendick |date=27 March 2011 |accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kenneth Merchant''' holds the [[Deloitte and Touche]] LLP Chair of [[Accountancy]] at the [[Leventhal School of Accounting]], part of the [[Marshall School of Business]] at the [[University of Southern California]].  He is the former dean of the Leventhal School.

==Career==


Dr. Merchant is the author of many articles and books on accounting, including the standard textbooks:

*''Accounting: Text and Cases'', 12th ed. (with Robert N. Anthony, and David F. Hawkins). Chicago: Irwin/McGraw-Hill (2004). {{ISBN|0-07-281950-2}}
*''Management Control Systems: Performance Measurement, Evaluation and Incentives'', 2nd ed.(with Wim A. Van der Stede). Pearson/Prentice Hall, London (2007) {{ISBN|0-273-70801-5}}
 
In this book Merchant describes three forms of control: control of specific actions, control of results and control of personnel. When knowledge of which specific actions are desirable is excellent, it is always a good thing to control specific actions. When the ability to measure results on important performance dimensions is high, it is always a good thing to control results. When it is difficult to know which specific actions are desirable and when it is difficult as well to measure the results, the optimal control is the personnel control.


Dr. Merchant previously taught at [[Harvard Business School]], currently serves on eight editorial boards, and served on the Board of Directors of [[Entropic Communications]], a publicly-listed company that was acquired.

==Education==
His [[Ph.D.]] is from the [[University of California at Berkeley]].  His [[M.B.A.]] is from [[Columbia Business School]].  His [[B.S.]] is from [[Union College]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32333">'''Friends schools''' are institutions that provide an education based on the [[Religious Society of Friends#Beliefs and testimonies|beliefs and testimonies]] of the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers). This article is a list of schools currently or historically associated with the Society of Friends, regardless of their current degree of affiliation.

Friends schools vary greatly, both in their interpretation of Quaker principles and in how they relate to formal organizations that make up the Society of Friends.  Most Friends schools are similar in their mission however: to provide an academically sound education while also instilling values of community, spirituality, responsibility and stewardship in their students.&lt;ref name="Quaker Education: What’s Different about a Friends School?"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boardingschoolreview.com/articles/10|title=Quaker Education:  What’s Different about a Friends School? - BoardingSchoolReview.com|website=BoardingSchoolReview.com|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some institutions founded by Friends were never formally "Quaker schools." Some historically Friends institutions are no longer formally associated with the Society of Friends. Those that continue to call themselves "Quaker schools" may have formal oversight from a Friends [[yearly meeting|yearly]] or [[monthly meeting]]s (often called coming "under care of" a meeting), and others are governed by members of the Society of Friends and/or adhere to aspects of Quaker practice.

Because of the wide range of Friends, the branch (or branches) of Quakerism with which the school affiliates are included, and where applicable the [[Yearly Meeting|Yearly]], Quarterly or [[Monthly meeting|Monthly]] Meeting under whose care or governance the school is held is shown.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14492">The following is a '''list of institutions offering type design education'''.

[[Type design]] (also: typeface design, ''pop.'' font design), the art of creating typefaces, is taught at art and design colleges around the world. A small number of institutions offer a degree in type design; many others offer type design courses as part of their BA or MA curriculum in Graphic Design or Visual Communication. When no full type design course is offered, schools may invite type designers to give workshops; these one-off events are not listed in the overview below.{{efn|This list is meant to reflect the current situation and relies on direct input from the institutions involved. Little written documentation is available, and the institutions' websites are not always up to date.}}

'''Los Angeles Science Teachers Network''' is a professional development network for [[science education]] by science teachers for science teachers committed to creating the most engaging hands-on curriculum possible through [[inquiry-based learning]] and [[scientific literacy]].

==History==
The first meeting was held in [[Lisa Ellen Niver]]'s home in September 2009. In October 2013, the professional development network had its fifteenth session. Over seventy teachers and forty schools have been involved to date. In ''[[Westside Today]]'', information about teaching, science and LASTN was presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |url        =http://www.pack6.us/los-angeles-science-teachers-network-28778l |title      = Pac6news |work    =Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] ''Impatient Optimists'' article, "Teachers Need A Village," the importance of teachers needing support from groups like LASTN is explored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Advisory Council==
Several teachers formed the core group and served as advisors to Niver over the first three years: Susan Bagdasarian, Sasha Moore, Joseph Rose and Judy Weiskopf. Niver was frequently asked about teaching science, she has been quoted in Parenting.com,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  http://www.parenting.com/gallery/everyday-ways-sneak-learning |title      =Everyday Ways to Sneak in Learning |work     =Parenting.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PBS]].org,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  https://www.pbs.org/parents/education/science/tips/weather-science-lessons/ |title      =Weather Science Lessons |work      = PBS.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Green Living Arizona'' (in print),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  http://www.greenlivingaz.com/2012/05/08/5528/ |title      =Science vs. Nutrition the GMO debate |work      =Green Living Magazine Arizona}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Huffington Post''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |url        =  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/14/back-to-school-divorce-teachers_n_1761147.html?ir=Divorce#slide=1376638 |title      =Back to School 2012: Teachers Reveal Divorced Parents Biggest Mistakes |work     =  Huffington Post | date=August 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on National television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqZqdq7Al24 |title      =Career Day |work     =National Television}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        = http://www.sciencebuddies.org/blog/2012/08/success-story-science-fair-projects-with-real-world-impact.php |title      =  Success Story: Science Fair Projects with Real-World Impact |work      =Science Buddies}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Niver is on sabbatical with [[We Said Go Travel]], Susan Bagdasarian has been the director of the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  http://www.linkedin.com/pub/lisa-niver-rajna/0/871/6a3f |title      =LASTN |work     =LinkedIn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  http://www.linkedin.com/company/3148346?trk=tyah |title      =LASTN company |work     =LinkedIn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marcella Sembrich''' (February 15, 1858 – January 11, 1935) was the stage name of the Polish [[coloratura]] [[soprano]], '''Prakseda Marcelina Kochańska'''.  She had an important international singing career, chiefly at the [[New York City|New York]] [[Metropolitan Opera]] and the [[Royal Opera House]], [[Covent Garden]], [[London]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert McHenry|McHenry, Robert]] (1983).  ''Famous American Women: A Biographical Dictionary from Colonial Times to the Present''.  Courier Dover Publications.  {{ISBN|0-486-24523-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Sembrich was born at [[Vyshnivchyk|Wisniewczyk]], in [[Austrian Galicia]], now part of [[Ukraine]]. She first studied violin and piano with her father. Later, she entered the [[Lemberg]] [[Lviv Conservatory|Conservatory]] and studied piano with her future husband [[Wilhelm Stengel]] and violin with [[Sigismond Bruckmann]].  She entered the [[University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna|Vienna Conservatory]] in Autumn 1875.  It was only then that her remarkable voice was discovered.  She studied violin with [[Joseph Hellmesberger Sr.]], piano with [[Julius Epstein (pianist)|Julius Epstein]], and voice with [[Viktor Rokitansky]]. After a year it was decided to give up study of the violin and piano and fully devote the young student to voice lessons.  She arrived in [[Milan]] in September 1876 to study with one of the best vocal teachers on the continent, namely [[Giovanni Battista Lamperti]], son of the eminent teacher [[Francesco Lamperti]], with whom she would later study in 1885.

After less than a year of study with the younger of the two Lampertis, Sembrich made her debut in opera at [[Athens]] as [[Elvira]] in [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]]'s ''[[I puritani]]'' on June 3, 1877. She sang not only ''Puritani'', but also ''[[Dinorah]]'', ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'', ''[[Robert le diable]]'' and ''[[La sonnambula]]''!  It is a testament to her proper early training and intelligence that a 19-year-old soprano could learn so many roles in a foreign language so quickly. While her success was solid, she still had much to learn.  After Athens she was to appear with the [[Vienna Opera]], but due to pregnancy she broke the contract. During her pregnancy and after the birth of her first son, Wilhelm Marcel, she continued her vocal studies, this time with [[Marie Seebach]] and Richard Lewey in Vienna.

After a long and frustrating search for an opera engagement, she was hired as a guest at the [[Dresden Royal Opera House]] in September 1878, debuting as Lucia. Her success was immediate and she was dubbed the "Polish [[Adelina Patti|Patti]]." She was immediately made a member of the company and remained in Dresden battling opera house politics, until 1880. She broke her contract at Dresden and sang a number of concerts to raise money to go to London. She had an auspicious audition with the impresario Ernest Gye at [[Covent Garden]] and signed a contract there for five seasons. In June 1880 she created a sensation in her debut at [[Covent Garden]] as Lucia in Donizetti's ''Lucia di Lammermoor''. She became a great favorite in the characters of Zerlina, ''[[Don Giovanni]]''; Susanna, ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''; Konstanze, ''[[The Abduction from the Seraglio]]''; Lady Harriet/Martha, ''[[Martha (opera)|Martha]]''; and, of course, Lucia. 

In 1883, Marcella Sembrich went to the [[United States]] to sing in the newly founded Metropolitan Opera company. She made her Met debut as Lucia in the company premiere of ''Lucia di Lammermoor'' on October 24, 1883. She was also the Met's first [[Elvira]] in ''I Puritani'', [[La traviata#Roles|Violetta]] in ''La Traviata'', [[Amina]] in ''La Sonnambula'', [[Gilda]] in ''[[Rigoletto]]'', [[Margaret of Valois|Marguerite]] in ''[[Les Huguenots]]'' and [[The Barber of Seville#Roles|Rosina]] in ''Il Barbiere di Siviglia''.  Due to the terrific financial loss of the company that year, Italian opera was abandoned and German opera reigned supreme at the Met for the next dozen years or so.  While away from New York, Sembrich was a tremendous favorite at the Italian Opera in [[St. Petersburg]], [[Russia]], from 1890 to 1897.

Sembrich returned to the Met in 1898. In total, she sang more than 450 Met performances in her 11 seasons there, and remained associated with the company until 1909, when the silver jubilee of her Met debut was celebrated with a farewell gala.  She gave recitals until 1917. After this date, she taught students from the [[Curtis Institute]] in Philadelphia and at the [[Juilliard School of Music]]. Her students included [[Alma Gluck]], [[Hulda Lashanska]], [[Queena Mario]], [[Edna de Lima]], [[Dusolina Giannini]], [[Josephine Antoine]], [[Natalie Bodanya]], [[Polyna Stoska]], [[Jane Pickens]].  Additionally, some of her students in turn became important vocal teachers around the country. Among them were  [[Anna Hamlin]] (teacher of [[Judith Raskin]]) at [[Smith College]], [[Edith Piper]] and [[Florence Page Kimball]] (teacher of [[Leontyne Price]]) at [[Juilliard]], [[Eufemia Gregory]] (teacher of [[Anna Moffo]], [[Judith Blegen]] and [[Frank Guarrera]]) at the [[Curtis Institute]].

The outbreak of [[World War I]] had made it impossible for the diva to return to her beloved Alps during the summers. Sembrich turned instead to the [[Adirondack Mountains]] area and spent summers at [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]] from 1915 to 1921, and then at a home on [[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]] from 1922 to 1934. The [[Marcella Sembrich Opera Museum]] can be found at [[Bolton Landing, New York|Bolton Landing]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. The museum contains many mementos from the diva's career. 

She died on January 11, 1935 at her home, 151 [[Central Park West]] in [[Manhattan, New York City]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Mme. Sembrich, 76, Dies at Home Here.

==Legacy==
*The [[Marcella Sembrich Opera Museum]] can be found at [[Bolton Landing, New York|Bolton Landing]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. The museum contains many mementos from the diva's career. 
*She was a great Polish patriot throughout her life.  During World War One she was President of the [[American-Polish Relief Committee]] of New York.  She was wholly devoted to raising money, food stuffs and clothes for her suffering countrymen. The [[Kosciuszko Foundation|Kosciuszko Foundation, Inc.]], an American center for [[Polish culture]] in [[New York City]], annually holds the "Marcella Sembrich Voice Competition".  The American Council for Polish Culture [ACPC] also honors Sembrich with an annual vocal competition for singers of Polish descent, the "ACPC Marcella Kochańska Sembrich Vocal Competition".
*Two portraits of Sembrich, one in costume, were painted in 1899 by the Swiss-born American artist [[Adolfo Müller-Ury]] (1862–1947) but are now lost. Her 1936 portrait by [[Alice Ruggles Sohier]] (1880–1969) now hangs in the Metropolitan Opera House (and can be found near the coat room). She also made a number of acoustic recordings prior to World War 1 for both Columbia Records (1903) and the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]]. Although these fail to do justice to her voice and undoubted artistry, they have been reissued on CD and repay careful listening.

The '''Museum of Domestic Design and Architecture (MoDA)''' is a [[museum]] in North [[London]], [[England]], housing one of the most comprehensive collections of 19th- and 20th-century [[decorative arts]] for the home. The collection is designated as being of outstanding international value by [[Arts Council England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/se000059|title=Museum of Domestic Design and Architecture - MoDA {{!}} Culture24|website=www.culture24.org.uk|access-date=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collections include the [[Silver Studio]] collection of designs for [[wallpaper]]s and [[textiles]], the Charles Hasler collection, and the [[Crown Wallpaper]] Archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A London Design Studio 1880-1963|last=Turner|first=Mark|publisher=Lund Humphries|year=1980|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum is part of [[Middlesex University]]. The MoDA Collections Centre is based at Beaufort Park in [[Colindale]], close to Middlesex University's Hendon campus in the [[London Borough of Barnet]].

== The Silver Studio Collection ==
The [[Silver Studio]] (run by the Silver family) was a commercial design practice, based in West London, which between 1880 and 1963 completed more than 20,000 schemes for items such as furnishing fabrics, wallpapers, tablecloths, rugs and carpets. The Studio employed a number of designers, some of whom were well known in their own right, and others whose work remained anonymous.

The Silver Studio’s customers were retailers and manufacturers of wallpapers and textiles at all levels of the market, both in Britain and abroad. Designs for wallpapers were sold both to manufacturers producing cheap papers for the mass market such as [[Lightbown Aspinall]] and Potters of Darwen, as well as those selling high quality products for the top end of the market such as Essex &amp; Co, John Line and Sandersons. Silver Studio designs were bought by all the leading British textile manufacturers, including Stead McAlpin, Alexander Morton and AH Lee, to name just a few. Clients included well known producers of high quality fabrics such as Turnbull &amp; Stockdale and the famous department store, [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty]].

Because the majority of the Silver Studio’s clients were mass producers, Silver Studio designs found their way into numerous British homes. The Studio’s influence on British interiors over a remarkable length of time can be seen in the huge number of their designs that went into production.

After it closed in the early 1960s the contents of the Silver Studio were given to the Hornsey College of Art, which subsequently became part of what is now [[Middlesex University]].

The significance of the Collection lies both in its completeness and coherence as a whole and in the importance and uniqueness of its component parts. It spans the period 1880-1960, an important period in the development of mass market furnishings and one less well represented in other collections.

Silver Studio designs found their way into many British homes over a long period, because most of its clients were mass producers. The significance of the Silver Studio as a design practice was acknowledged in 1981 with the awarding of an English Heritage blue plaque to 84 Brook Green, Hammersmith, the building that was both the Studio and the Silver family home.

== Charles Hasler Collection ==
This material was the working collection of designer and typographer, Charles Hasler (1908-1992). Hasler played a significant role in many high-profile exhibitions, displays, poster campaigns and book publishing in Britain from the mid-1930s to the mid-1980s.

Between 1942 and 1951 Hasler was an exhibition designer for the Ministry of Information and the Central Office of Information.  He worked on displays such as ‘[[Dig for victory|Dig For Victory]]’, ‘[[Make Do and Mend]]’ and ‘Nation and the Child’. After the war he became a senior designer and chairman of the Typographic Panel for the [[Festival of Britain]] of 1951.

Hasler designed and produced the influential Specimen of Display Letters for use by Festival architects and designers.  Throughout his career Hasler lectured in typographic design and history and was involved with the education and professional development of print and graphic designers

Hasler was interested in the newly emerging field of packaging and branding and in the role of typographical design.  His collection reflects his keen interest in all kinds of printed material and includes postcards, playbills, sheet music, packaging and posters dating from the nineteenth century onwards.

== Sir James Richards Library ==
MoDA holds the [[James Maude Richards|Sir James Maude Richards]] Library on long term loan.  This is a collection of architectural books and journals collected by Sir JM Richards (1907-1992), a leading spokesman and theorist of the Modern Movement in architecture in Britain.

Richards was the editor of ''The Architectural Review ''between 1937 and 1971, serving as critical spokesman on behalf of both architect and public alike.

''The Architectural Review'' was launched in 1896. During the 1930s it was central to the debate concerning the Modern movement in Britain. It was international in its scope and became a forum for the best examples of Modern movement architecture. As editor of the magazine Richards met all of the leading architectural practitioners and theoreticians of the day, and this is reflected in the contents of his library.

His best-known book, ''Castles on the Ground'' (1946), represents his argument in favour of suburbia, and his appreciation of the 'everyday' built environment.

Sir JM Richards' Library consists of over 1500 volumes and contains all his own published work, plus books by leading artists and architectural writers including John Betjeman, John Piper, Osbert Lancaster, Nikolaus Pevsner, John Nash, Herbert Read and John Summerson.

== Crown Wallpaper Archive ==
MoDA’s Crown Wallpaper Collection consists of around 5,000 wallpaper albums and samples dating from the early 1950s to the late 1960s, donated to the museum by Crown Wallpapers in 1989.

Along with the wallpapers of MoDA’s Silver Studio Collection, this collection represents one of the country’s finest bodies of non-elite wallpapers of the late nineteenth to the mid twentieth centuries.  The majority of the wallpapers held here were intended for the mass market, not for ‘high-end’ consumers, and can therefore be seen as a barometer of British taste over a long period.

The Crown Wallpaper complements our other collections, locating the product in its domestic setting and placing it in the context of histories of consumption, in particular in relation to suburbia.

MoDA also has a good selection of hand-printed wallpapers from the 1930s, by artists such as [[Edward Bawden]], John Aldridge and Lawrence Scarfe.

== The Domestic Design Collection 1870-1960 ==
This collection consists of over 4,000 books, journals, magazines and trade and retail catalogues relating to all aspects of home furnishing, household management, cookery, house building, DIY, home crafts and gardening.  This is a fantastic resource for anyone interested in domestic furnishings, homecraft or other aspects of domestic life; it is also useful as visual reference for those interested in typography, graphic design, book design and so on.

A particularly important element is the material relating to the growth of North London suburbia between around 1900 and 1939.  It consists of posters, brochures and other publicity material produced by property developers, builders and estate agents.  This material complements the other items relating to domestic decoration and furnishing from the same period.

Around 2,000 books and catalogues were originally part of the Silver Studio Collection, accumulated and used by the designers as sources of visual reference.

{{Hindu philosophy}} 
'''Paramahansa Yogananda''' ({{lang-bn|পরমহংস যোগানন্দ}}) (5 January 1893{{spaced ndash}}7 March 1952), born '''Mukunda Lal Ghosh''' ({{lang-bn| মুকুন্দলাল ঘোষ}}), was an Indian [[yoga|yogi]] and [[guru]] who introduced millions of  Indians and westerners to the teachings of [[meditation]] and [[Kriya Yoga]] through his organization [[Yogoda Satsanga Society of India]] and [[Self-Realization Fellowship]]. In 1946, he published his autobiography, titled ''[[Autobiography of a Yogi]]'' which is on the list of the "100 best spiritual books of the 20th Century" created by HarperSan Francisco, a division of HarperCollins Publishers.&lt;ref name="AbeBooks.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.abebooks.com/docs/ReligiousSpiritual/spiritual-books.shtml |title=HarperCollins 100 Best Spiritual Books of the Century |accessdate= |format= |website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spirituality &amp; Practice"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiritualityandpractice.com/books/features/view/10915/100-best-spiritual-books-of-the-twentieth-century |title=HarperSanFrancisco, edited by Philip Zaleski ''100 Best Spiritual Books of the 20th Century'' |accessdate= |format= |website=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been regularly reprinted ever since and is known as "the book that changed the lives of millions."&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Philip (2018).

==Biography==

===Youth===
[[File:Yogananda menino.jpg|thumb|right|Yogananda at age six]]
Yogananda was born in [[Gorakhpur]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]], to a devout family.&lt;ref name=mejda&gt;Sananda Lal Ghosh,(1980), Mejda, Self-Realization Fellowship, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; According to his younger brother, Sananda, from his earliest years young Mukunda's awareness and experience of the spiritual was far beyond the ordinary.&lt;ref name="mejda"/&gt; In his youth he sought out many of India's [[Hindu]] sages and saints, hoping to find an illuminated teacher to guide him in his spiritual quest.&lt;ref name="autob"&gt;''Autobiography of a Yogi'', 1997 Anniversary Edition. Self-Realization Fellowship (Founded by Yogananda) www.yogananda-srf.org&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910 Yogananda's seeking after various saints mostly ended when, at the age of 17, he met his [[guru]], [[Swami]] [[Yukteswar Giri]]. He describes his first meeting with Yukteswar as a rekindling of a relationship that had lasted for many lifetimes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We entered a oneness of silence; words seemed the rankest superfluities. Eloquence flowed in soundless chant from heart of master to disciple. With an antenna of irrefragable insight I sensed that my guru knew God, and would lead me to Him. The obscuration of this life disappeared in a fragile dawn of prenatal memories. Dramatic time! Past, present, and future are its cycling scenes. This was not the first sun to find me at these holy feet!&lt;ref name="autob"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later on Yukteswar informed Yogananda that he had been sent to him by [[Mahavatar Babaji]] for a special purpose.&lt;ref name="autob"/&gt;

After passing his Intermediate Examination in Arts from the [[Scottish Church College, Calcutta]], in June 1915, he graduated with a degree similar to a current day Bachelor of Arts or B.A. (which at the time was referred to as an A.B.), from [[Serampore College]], the college having two entities, one as a constituent college of the [[Senate of Serampore College (University)]] and the other as an affiliated college of the [[University of Calcutta]]. This allowed him to spend time at Yukteswar's [[ashram]] in Serampore. In 1915, he took formal vows into the [[monastic]] [[Swami]] order and became Swami Yogananda Giri.&lt;ref name="autob"/&gt; In 1917, Yogananda founded a school for boys in [[Dihika]], [[West Bengal]], that combined modern educational techniques with [[yoga]] training and spiritual ideals. A year later, the school relocated to [[Ranchi]].&lt;ref name="autob"/&gt; This school would later become the [[Yogoda Satsanga Society of India]], the Indian branch of Yogananda's American organization, [[Self-Realization Fellowship]].

===Move to America===
In 1920, Yogananda went to the United States aboard the ship City of Sparta, as India's delegate to an International Congress of Religious Liberals convening in [[Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Swami yogananda giri speaks on "the inner life| location =Boston, MA | agency= | newspaper=ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The Boston Globe p.9 | date= 5 March 1921 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Melton&gt;{{cite book |last=Melton, J. Gordon|first=Martin Baumann|title=Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices |year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781598842043 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year he founded the [[Self-Realization Fellowship]] (SRF) to disseminate worldwide his teachings on India's ancient practices and philosophy of [[Yoga]] and its tradition of meditation.&lt;ref name="DENNIS HEVESI"&gt;{{cite news |author=DENNIS HEVESI| title=Sri Daya Mata, Guiding Light for U.S. Hindus, Dies at 96 | location=New York, NY | agency= | newspaper=New York Times| date= December 3, 2010 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/03/us/03mata.html?_r=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the next several years, he lectured and taught on the East Coast&lt;ref&gt;Boston Meditation Group Historical Committee. ''In The Footsteps of Paramahansa Yogananda: A guidebook to the places in and around Boston associated with Yoganandaji''&lt;/ref&gt;  and in 1924 embarked on a cross-continental speaking tour.&lt;ref&gt;Sister Gyanamata "God Alone: The Life and Letters of a Saint" p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands came to his lectures.&lt;ref name="autob"/&gt; During this time he attracted a number of celebrity followers, including soprano [[Amelita Galli-Curci]], tenor [[Vladimir Rosing]] and [[Clara Clemens|Clara Clemens Gabrilowitsch]], the daughter of [[Mark Twain]]. The following year, he established an international center for Self-Realization Fellowship in Los Angeles, California, which became the spiritual and administrative heart of his growing work.&lt;ref name=Melton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis Rosser |first=Brenda |title= Treasures Against Time|year=1991 |publisher=Borrego Publications |isbn=978-0962901607|page=Foreword p. xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yogananda was the first Hindu teacher of yoga to spend a major portion of his life in America. He lived in the United States from 1920—1952, interrupted by an extended trip abroad in 1935–1936 which was mainly to visit his guru in India though he undertook visits to other living western saints like [[Therese Neumann]], the Catholic [[Stigmatist]] of [[Konnersreuth]], and places of spiritual significance en route.&lt;ref name="autob"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yogananda |first=Paramahansa |authorlink= |title=The Second Coming of Christ / Volume I / Jesus Temptation in the wilderness / Discourse 8 / Mattew 4:1-4 |year=2004 |publisher=Self-Realization Fellowship |isbn=9780876125557 |page=166–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visit to India, 1935–1936===
In 1935, he returned to India to visit his guru Yukteswar Giri and to help establish his [[Yogoda Satsanga Society of India|Yogoda Satsanga]] work in India. During this visit, as told in his autobiography, he met with [[Mahatma Gandhi]], and initiated him into the liberating technique of Kriya Yoga as Gandhi expressed his interest to receive the Kriya Yoga of Lahiri Mahasaya; [[Sri Anandamoyi Ma|Anandamoyi Ma]]; renowned physicist [[Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman]]; and several disciples of Yukteswar's guru [[Lahiri Mahasaya]].&lt;ref name="autob"/&gt; While in India, Yukteswar gave Yogananda the monastic title of ''[[Paramahansa]]''. Paramahansa means "supreme swan" and is a title indicating the highest spiritual attainment.&lt;ref&gt;"Paramahansa means "supreme swan" and is a title indicating the highest spiritual attainment." Miller, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, while Yogananda was visiting Calcutta, Yukteswar attained mahasamadhi (final soul liberation)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Melton |first=J. Gordon |title= Religious Celebrations|year=2011|publisher= ABC-CLIO |isbn= 978-1598842050|page=512}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the town of [[Puri]].

===Return to America, 1936===
After returning to America, Yogananda continued to lecture, write, and establish churches in southern California. He took up residence at the SRF hermitage in [[Encinitas, California]] which was a surprise gift from his disciple [[Rajarsi Janakananda]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yogananda-srf.org/locations/usa/Encinitas_Retreat_and_Hermitage.aspx#.UbUUFJxN8yM Self-Realization Fellowship: Encinitas Retreat and Hermitage]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encinitastemple.org/ Self-Realization Fellowship: Encinitas Temple]&lt;/ref&gt; It was while at this hermitage that Yogananda wrote his famous ''[[Autobiography of a Yogi]]'' and other writings.  Also at this time he created an "enduring foundation for the spiritual and humanitarian work of Self‑Realization Fellowship/Yogoda Satsanga Society of India."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yogananda-srf.org/pybio/A_Spiritual_Foundation.aspx#.UbUO85xN8yM Creating Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons, Temples, Retreats and writing his ''Autobiography of a Yogi'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The last four years of his life were spent primarily in seclusion with some of his inner circle of disciples at his desert [[ashram]] in [[Twentynine Palms, California]] to finish his writings and to finish revising books, articles and lessons written previously over the years.&lt;ref name=Gita&gt;{{cite book |last=Yogananda |first=Paramahansa |title=God Talks With Arjuna - The Bhagavad Gita p.xii/1130 |year=1995 |publisher=Self-Realization Fellowship |location= Los Angeles, CA|isbn=978-0-87612-030-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period he gave few interviews and public lectures. He told his close disciples, "I can do much more now to reach others with my pen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|last=Mata |first=Mrinalini |title=In His Presence: Remembrances of Life With Paramahansa Yogananda |type=DVD |publisher= Self-Realization Fellowship|location= |year= |isbn=978-0-87612-517-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
In the days leading up to his death, Yogananda began hinting that it was time for him to leave the world.&lt;ref name= Mata&gt;Mata, Daya (1990). ''Finding the Joy Within'', 1st ed. Los Angeles, CA: Self-Realization Fellowship, p 256&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 March 1952, he attended a dinner for the visiting Indian Ambassador to the US, [[Binay Ranjan Sen]], and his wife at the [[Millennium Biltmore Hotel|Biltmore Hotel]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;How Not To Be A Diplomat: Adventures in the Indian Foreign Service Post-Independence – P.L. Bhandari (2013). Eyewitness account from Ambassador Sen's aid.&lt;/ref&gt; At the conclusion of the banquet, Yogananda spoke of India and America, their contributions to world peace and human progress, and their future cooperation,&lt;ref name="Kriyananda"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kriyananda |first=Swami (Donald Walters)|title=The Path: Autobiography of a Western Yogi|year=1977 |publisher=Ananda Publications |isbn=978-0916124120 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; expressing his hope for a "United World" that would combine the best qualities of "efficient America" and "spiritual India."&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; According to an eyewitness – [[Daya Mata]], a direct disciple of Yogananda, who was head of the Self-Realization Fellowship from 1955–2010&lt;ref&gt;About SRF: Lineage and Leadership: Daya Mata.

His funeral service, with hundreds attending, was held at the SRF headquarters atop Mt. Washington in Los Angeles. [[Rajarsi Janakananda]], the new president of the Self-Realization Fellowship, "performed a sacred ritual releasing the body to God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Hundreds Pay Tribute at Rites for Yogananda | location = Los Angeles, CA | agency= | newspaper= ProQuest Historical Newspapers: Los Angeles Times | date= 12 March 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yogananda's remains are interred at the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] in the Great Mausoleum (normally closed off to visitors but Yogananda's tomb is accessible) in [[Glendale, California]].&lt;ref name="PYmem"/&gt;

==Teachings==
[[File:Yoganandawashingtondc.jpg|thumb|right|Paramahansa Yogananda giving a class in Washington, D.C.]]
In 1917 in India Paramahansa Yogananda "began his life's work with the founding of a 'how-to-live' school for boys, where modern educational methods were combined with yoga training and instruction in spiritual ideals." In 1920 "he was invited to serve as India's delegate to an International Congress of Religious Liberals convening in Boston. His address to the Congress, on 'The Science of Religion,' was enthusiastically received."  For the next several years he lectured and taught across the United States. His discourses taught of the "unity of 'the original teachings of Jesus Christ and the original Yoga taught by Bhagavan Krishna.'"

In 1920 he founded the Self-Realization Fellowship and in 1925 established in Los Angeles, California, USA, the international headquarters for SRF.&lt;ref name=Melton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yogananda |first=Paramahansa |title=The Second Coming of Christ: The Resurrection of the Christ Within You p.1566 |year=2004 |publisher=Self-Realization Fellowship |location= Los Angeles, CA|isbn=978-0-87612-555-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kress |first=Michael |title=Publishers Weekly: Meditation is the message |year=2001 |publisher=Cahners Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier, Inc.|location= New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Yogananda wrote the ''[[The Second Coming of Christ (Yogananda)|Second Coming of Christ: The Resurrection of the Christ Within You]]'' and ''[[Bhagavad Gita (Yogananda)|God Talks With Arjuna — The Bhagavad Gita]]'' to reveal what he claimed was the complete harmony and basic oneness of original Christianity as taught by Jesus Christ and original Yoga as taught by Bhagavan Krishna; and to present that these principles of truth are the common scientific foundation of all true religions.&lt;ref name=Watanabe&gt;{{cite news | author =Teresa Watanabe | title=A Hindu's Perspective on Christ and Christianity | location =Los Angeles, CA | agency= | newspaper=Los Angeles Times | date=12 November 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yogananda wrote down his Aims and Ideals for Self-Realization Fellowship/Yogoda Satsanga Society:&lt;ref name="autob"&gt;''Autobiography of a Yogi'', 1997 Anniversary Edition. Self-Realization Fellowship (Founded by Yogananda) www.yogananda-srf.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aims &amp; Ideals of Self-Realization Fellowship, www.yogananda-srf.org/Aims_and_Ideals.aspx, accessdate=2008-02-09&lt;/ref&gt;
	
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 
*To disseminate among the nations a knowledge of definite scientific techniques for attaining direct personal experience of God.
 
*To teach that the purpose of life is the evolution, through self-effort, of man’s limited mortal consciousness into God Consciousness; and to this end to establish Self-Realization Fellowship temples for God-communion throughout the world, and to encourage the establishment of individual temples of God in the homes and in the hearts of men.
 
*To reveal the complete harmony and basic oneness of original Christianity as taught by Jesus Christ and original Yoga as taught by Bhagavan Krishna; and to show that these principles of truth are the common scientific foundation of all true religions.
 
*To point out the one divine highway to which all paths of true religious beliefs eventually lead: the highway of daily, scientific, devotional meditation on God.
 	
*To liberate man from his threefold suffering: physical disease, mental inharmonies, and spiritual ignorance.
 	
*To encourage “plain living and high thinking”; and to spread a spirit of brotherhood among all peoples by teaching the eternal basis of their unity: kinship with God.
 
*To demonstrate the superiority of mind over body, of soul over mind.
 
*To overcome evil by good, sorrow by joy, cruelty by kindness, ignorance by wisdom.
 
*To unite science and religion through realization of the unity of their underlying principles.
 	
*To advocate cultural and spiritual understanding between East and West, and the exchange of their finest distinctive features.
 	
*To serve mankind as one’s larger Self.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his published work, ''The Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons'', Yogananda gives "his in-depth instruction in the practice of the highest yoga science of God-realization. That ancient science is embodied in the specific principles and meditation techniques of ''Kriya Yoga''."&lt;ref name=Gita/&gt; Yogananda taught his students the need for direct experience of truth, as opposed to blind belief. He said that "The true basis of religion is not belief, but intuitive experience. [[Intuition (knowledge)#Intuition and spirituality|Intuition]] is the soul's power of knowing God. To know what religion is really all about, one must know God."&lt;ref name="autob"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Watanabe"/&gt;

Echoing traditional [[Hindu]] teachings, he taught that the entire universe is God's cosmic motion picture, and that individuals are merely actors in the divine play who change roles through [[reincarnation]]. He taught that mankind's deep suffering is rooted in identifying too closely with one's current role, rather than with the movie's director, or God.&lt;ref name="autob"/&gt;

He taught [[Kriya Yoga]] and other meditation practices to help people achieve that understanding, which he called [[Self-realization]]:&lt;ref name=Melton/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Self-realization is the knowing – in body, mind, and soul – that we are one with the omnipresence of God; that we do not have to pray that it come to us, that we are not merely near it at all times, but that God's omnipresence is our omnipresence; and that we are just as much a part of Him now as we ever will be.  All we have to do is improve our knowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yogananda |first=Paramahansa |title=The Second Coming of Christ: The Resurrection of the Christ Within You p. xxi|year=2004 |publisher=Self-Realization Fellowship |location= Los Angeles, CA|isbn=978-0-87612-555-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Kriya Yoga==
{{main article|Kriya Yoga}}
The "science" of Kriya Yoga is the foundation of Yogananda's teachings.  ''Kriya Yoga'' is "union (yoga) with the Infinite through a certain action or rite (kriya). The Sanskrit root of ''kriya'' is ''kri'', to do, to act and react." ''Kriya Yoga'' was passed down through Yogananda's guru lineage – [[Mahavatar Babaji]] taught ''Kriya Yoga'' to [[Lahiri Mahasaya]], who taught it to his disciple, [[Yukteswar Giri]], Yogananda's Guru.&lt;ref name="autob"/&gt;

Yogananda gave a general description of ''Kriya Yoga'' in his ''Autobiography'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Kriya Yogi mentally directs his life energy to revolve, upward and downward, around the six spinal centers (medullary, cervical, dorsal, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal plexuses) which correspond to the twelve astral signs of the zodiac, the symbolic Cosmic Man. One-half minute of revolution of energy around the sensitive spinal cord of man effects subtle progress in his evolution; that half-minute of Kriya equals one year of natural spiritual unfoldment.&lt;ref name="autob"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sri Mrinalini Mata, the former president of SRF/YSS, said, "''Kriya Yoga'' is so effective, so complete, because it brings God's love – the universal power through which God draws all souls back to reunion with Him – into operation in the devotee's life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mrinalini Mata|title=Self-Realiztion Magazine: The Blessings of Kriya Yoga in Everyday Life|year=2011 |publisher=Self-Realization Fellowship |location= Los Angeles, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yogananda wrote in ''Autobiography of a Yogi'' that the "actual technique should be learned from an authorized Kriyaban (Kriya Yogi) of Self-Realization Fellowship (Yogoda Satsanga Society of India.)"&lt;ref name="autob"/&gt;

It has sold more than four million copies and counting".&lt;ref name="Goldberg 2012"&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldberg|first=Philip |title=American Veda |year=2012 |publisher=Harmony; 1 edition (2 November 2010): 109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the publisher, Self-Realization Fellowship, honored the 60th anniversary of ''Autobiography of a Yogi'' "with a series of projects designed to promote the legacy of the man thousands of disciples still refer to as 'master'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/aug/06/local/me-swami6 |last= Sahagun |first=Louis |title=Guru's Followers Mark Legacy of a Star's Teachings

''Autobiography of a Yogi'' describes Yogananda's spiritual search for enlightenment, in addition to encounters with notable spiritual figures such as [[Therese Neumann]], [[Sri Anandamoyi Ma|Anandamayi Ma]], [[Vishuddhananda Paramahansa]], [[Mohandas Gandhi]], Nobel laureate in literature [[Rabindranath Tagore]], noted plant scientist [[Luther Burbank]] (the book is 'Dedicated to the Memory of Luther Burbank, An American Saint'), famous Indian scientist Sir [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]] and Nobel laureate in physics Sir [[C. V. Raman]]. One notable chapter of this book is "The Law of Miracles", where he gives scientific explanations for seemingly miraculous feats. He writes: "the word 'impossible' is becoming less prominent in man's vocabulary."&lt;ref name="autob"/&gt;

The ''Autobiography'' has been an inspiration for many people including [[George Harrison]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wright|first=Gary |title=Dream Weaver: A Memoir; Music, Meditation, and My Friendship with George Harrison  |year=2014 |publisher= TarcherPerigee|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ravi Shankar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Mahony |first=John|title=A Hodgepodge of Hash, Yoga and LSD&amp;nbsp;– Interview with Sitar giant Ravi Shankar |date=June 3, 2008 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jun/04/worldmusic.india |accessdate=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Steve Jobs]]. In the book ''[[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs: A Biography]]'' the author writes that Mr. Jobs first read the ''Autobiography'' as a teenager.  He re-read it in India and later while preparing for a trip, he downloaded it onto his iPad2 and then re-read it once a year ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Isaacson |first=Walter |title=Steve Jobs: A Biography |year=2011 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=978-1-4516-4853-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims of bodily incorruptibility==
As reported in ''[[Time Magazine]]'' on August 4, 1952, Harry T. Rowe, Los Angeles Mortuary Director of the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale) |Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] in [[Glendale, California]], where Yogananda's body was received, [[embalmed]] and interred,&lt;ref name="Guru's Exit"&gt;{{cite news |title=Guru's Exit |publisher=''Time'' |date=4 August 1952 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,822420,00.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5t3pauJ8q?url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,822420,00.html |archivedate=27 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote in a notarized letter&lt;ref name="autob"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The absence of any visual signs of decay in the dead body of Paramahansa Yogananda offers the most extraordinary case in our experience... No physical disintegration was visible in his body even twenty days after death... No indication of mold was visible on his skin, and no visible drying up took place in the bodily tissues. This state of perfect preservation of a body is, so far as we know from mortuary annals, an unparalleled one... No odor of decay emanated from his body at any time...&lt;ref name=Mortuary&gt;{{cite book |author1=Forest Lawn Memorial-Park |author2=Harry T. Rowe |author3=Mortuary Director | title=Paramahansa Yogananda's Mortuary Report | location = Los Angeles, CA | date= 16 May 1952 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rowe&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rowe|first1=Harry T.|title=  Paramahansa Yogananda's Mortuary Report|url=http://oaks.nvg.org/yogananda_mortuary_report.pdf|publisher=Forest Lawn Memorial Park}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because of two statements in Rowe's letter, some have questioned whether the term "incorruptibility" is appropriate. First, in his fourth paragraph he wrote: "For protection of the public health, embalming is desirable if a dead body is to be exposed for several days to public view. Embalming of the body of Paramhansa Yogananda took place twenty-four hours after his demise." In the eleventh paragraph he wrote: "On the late morning of March 26th, we observed a very slight, a barely noticeable, change -- the appearance on the tip of the nose of a brown spot, about one-fourth inch in diameter. This small faint spot indicated that the process of desiccation (drying up) might finally be starting. No visible mold appeared however."&lt;ref name=Rowe/&gt;

As Forest Lawn’s Mortuary Director, Rowe was professionally well qualified to distinguish the exceptional from the ordinary. He continued in paragraphs fourteen and fifteen: "The physical appearance of Paramhansa Yogananda on March 27th just before the bronze cover for the casket was put into position, was the same as it was on March 7th. He looked on March 27th as fresh and unravaged by decay as he had looked on the night of his death. On March 27th there was no reason to say that his body had suffered any physical disintegration at all. For these reason we state again that the case of Paramhansa Yogananda is unique in our experience. On May 11, 1952, during a telephone conversation between an officer of Forest Lawn and an officer of Self-Realization Fellowship, the amazing story was brought out for the first time."&lt;ref name=Mortuary/&gt;

Self-Realization Fellowship published Rowe’s four-page notarized letter in its entirety in the May-June 1952 issue of its magazine ''Self-Realization''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Self-Realization Magazine|year=1952|location=Los Angeles |publisher= Self-Realization Fellowship |issn= 0037-1564 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1958 to the present it has been included in that organization's booklet ''Paramahansa Yogananda: In Memoriam''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Paramahansa Yogananda: In Memoriam|year=1998 |publisher=Self-Realization Fellowship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

===Self-Realization Fellowship / Yogoda Satsanga Society of India===
Yogoda Satsanga Society of India (YSS) is a non-profit religious organization founded by Paramahansa Yogananda in 1917, 100 years ago.[5][6] In countries outside the Indian subcontinent it is known as the Self-Realization Fellowship. Paramahansa Yogananda's dissemination of his teachings is continued through this organization – the [[Self-Realization Fellowship]] (SRF)/[[Yogoda Satsanga Society of India]] (YSS).&lt;ref name="Goldberg 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SRF&gt;About SRF: Lineage and Leadership: Organizational Leadership on the SRF website – www.yogananda-srf.org&lt;/ref&gt; Yogananda founded Yogoda Satsanga Society of India in 1917 and then expanded it in 1920 to the United States naming it the Self-Realization Fellowship. In 1935 he legally incorporated it in the U.S. to serve as his instrument for the preservation and worldwide dissemination of his teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{wikisource-inline|SRF Articles of Incorporation 1935}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yogananda expressed this intention again in 1939 in his magazine ''Inner Culture for Self-Realization'' that he published through his organization:
&lt;blockquote&gt; Paramahansa Swami Yogananda renounced all his ownership rights in the Self-Realization Fellowship when it was incorporated as a nonprofit religious organization under the laws of California, March 29, 1935. At that time he turned over to the Fellowship all of his rights to and income from sale of his books, writings, magazine, lectures, classes, property, automobiles and all other possessions...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Self-Realization Fellowship|title=Inner Culture for Self-Realization|date=1939 |volume=12 |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Visit by Ram Nath Kovind, President of India===


On November 15, 2017 the President of India, [[Ram Nath Kovind]], accompanied by the Governor of Jharkhand, [[Draupadi Murmu]] and Chief Minister of Jharkhand, [[Raghubar Das]], visited the Yogoda Satsanga Society of India's Ranchi Ashram in honor of the official release of the Hindi translation of Paramahansa Yogananda's book ''God Talks with Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita''. Brother Chidananda, president of Self-Realization Fellowship/Yogoda Satsanga Society of India, along with a contingent of YSS and SRF monastics greeted and hosted them. This meeting took place during the 2017 YSS Sharad Sangam which was honoring YSS's centennial anniversary (1917-2017).&lt;ref name&gt;{{cite news |author=| title=President of India Ram Nath Kovind visited  Ranchi  | location=India| date= November 15, 2017 | url=http://jharkhandstatenews.com/section/photo-story/1176 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Sudhir Kumar Mishra| title=Ashram charms First Citizen | location=India| agency= | newspaper=Telegraph India| date=Nov 16, 2017  | url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/jharkhand/ashram-charms-first-citizen-186232 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Kovind said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Paramahansa Yogananda’s message is a message of spirituality. Going beyond the confines of religion, his is a message of respecting all religions; his perspective is of world brotherhood.”
“Through the publication of this Hindi translation, the wisdom-imparting teachings implicit in this book, which are of much assistance in everyday life, are now made available to a very large readership.”  He expressed hope that “millions of people will be able to know themselves better, and recognize the way to make their lives better, through Paramahansa Yogananda’s Gita commentary, now that it is available in Hindi.”
“Paramahansa Yogananda has also deeply impressed today’s young generation, which is surrounded by materialism and competition. Achieving prosperity and success on an international level amidst fierce struggle, many young people credit their accomplishments to Paramahansaji’s ''Autobiography of a Yogi''. This is a very renowned book, and I think most of you have read it; I too have had that opportunity. This book illumines the right course for all to follow in life.”&lt;ref&gt;yogananda-srf.org {{cite web|title=President of India Visits YSS Ranchi Ashram - God Talks With Arjuna in Hindi Is Released|url=http://www.yogananda-srf.org/NewsArchive/2017/President_of_India_Visits_YSS_Ranchi_Ashram.aspx#.Wq0_hWrwaUl|date=Nov 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=| title=President, Ram Nath Kovind addresses at Yogoda Satsanga Society of India in Ranchi| location=India| agency=Newspoint Tv | newspaper=Amirapress.com| date=Nov 16, 2017  | url=http://www.amirapress.com/video/t_EYRTiB_QnwQ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

First Polish teachers trade unions date to 1905, the year that marks the period of unrest known as the [[Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland (1905–1907)]].&lt;ref name="Lerski1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name=WIEM&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://portalwiedzy.onet.pl/43785,,,,zwiazek_nauczycielstwa_polskiego,haslo.html wiązek Nauczycielstwa Polskiego], [[WIEM Encyklopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish Teachers' Union has been created in 1930 from the merger of the Union of Polish Teachers of Elementary Schools and the Trade Union of Teachers of Polish High Schools, both dating to 1919.&lt;ref name="Lerski1996"/&gt;
In the 1930s, ZNP, numbering over 50,000 members before [[World War II]], and being the largest Polish association and trade union for educators, became increasingly influenced by [[socialist]]s, which caused it to be eventually suspended by the conservative and right-leaning Polish government.&lt;ref name="Lerski1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name=WIEM/&gt; In response, the socialist wing of ZNP organized the large [[Polish teachers strike (1937)]], which succeeded in having the government back down and reinstate the organization.&lt;ref name=WIEM/&gt; ZNP at that time maintained also auxiliary institutions, such as the Pedegogical Institute, and run summer vocational courses.&lt;ref name="Lerski1996"/&gt;

During the war, ZNP continued to exist as part of the [[underground education in Poland during World War II]], in the form of the [[Secret Teaching Organization]].&lt;ref name="Lerski1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name=wiem&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://portalwiedzy.onet.pl/68338,,,,tajna_organizacja_nauczycielska,haslo.html Tajna Organizacja Nauczycielska], [[WIEM Encyklopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Organization was created towards the end of October 1939 in [[Warsaw]] response to German [[Polish culture during World War II|closure of most Polish educational institutions and repressions against teachers]].&lt;ref name=Lowe&gt;Josef Krauski, ''Education as Resistance: The Polish Experience of Schooling During the War'', in Roy Lowe, ''Education and the Second World War : studies in schooling and social change'', Falmer Press, 1992, {{ISBN|0-7507-0054-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vf7A7yiSqe8C&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=schools+%22occupied+Poland%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=T8NrSdLVA6eGzgTZtf32CA#PPA130], M1 Google Print, p.128-138&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=buk&gt;Ewa Bukowska, [http://www.polishresistance-ak.org/15%20Article.htm '' Secret Teaching in Poland in the Years 1939 to 1945''], London Branch of the Polish Home Army Ex-Servicemen Association&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Critical pedagogy}}
'''Popular education''' is a concept grounded in notions of class, political struggle, and [[social transformation]]. The term is a translation from the Spanish [[:es:Educación popular|educación popular]] or the Portuguese [[:pt:Educação popular|educação popular]] and rather than the English usage as when describing a 'popular television program', popular here means 'of the people'. More specifically 'popular' refers to the 'popular classes', which include [[peasant]]s, the unemployed, the working class and sometimes the lower middle class. The designation of 'popular' is meant most of all to exclude the upper class and upper middle class.

Popular education is used to classify a wide array of educational endeavors and has been a strong tradition in Latin America since the end of the first half of the 20th century. These endeavors are either composed of or carried out in the interests of the popular classes. The diversity of projects and endeavors claiming or receiving the label of popular education makes the term difficult to precisely define. Generally, one can say that popular education is class-based in nature and rejects the notion of education as transmission or 'banking education'. It stresses a [[dialectic]] or [[dialogic]]al model between educator and educand. This model is explored in great detail in the works of one of the foremost popular educators [[Paulo Freire]].

Though sharing many similarities with other forms of [[alternative education]], popular education is a distinct form in its own right. In the words of Liam Kane:
"What distinguishes popular education from '[[adult education|adult]]', '[[Non-formal education|non-formal]]', '[[distance education|distance]]', or 'permanent education', for example, is that in the context of social injustice, education can never be politically neutral: if it does not side with the poorest and marginalised sectors- the 'oppressed' – in an attempt to transform society, then it necessarily sides with the 'oppressors' in maintaining the existing structures of oppression, even if by default."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kane|first=Liam|title=Popular Education and Social Change in Latin America|year=2001|publisher=Russell Press|location=Nottingham, UK|isbn=1-899365-52-4|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Europe ==
Popular education began at the crossroads between politics and [[pedagogy]], and strongly relies on the democratic ideal of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], which considered [[public education]] as a main tool of individual and collective [[emancipation]], and thus the necessary conditions of [[autonomy]], in accordance to [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Was Ist Aufklärung?]]'' (What is Enlightenment?), published five years before the 1789 [[French Revolution]], during which the [[Marquis de Condorcet|Condorcet report]] established public instruction in France.

[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s ''[[L'Emile: Or, On Education]]'' (1762) was another obvious theoretical influence, as well as the works of [[N. F. S. Grundtvig]] (1783–1872), at the origins of the Nordic movement of [[folk high school]]s. During the 19th century, popular education movements were involved, in particular in [[History of France|France]], in the [[Republicanism|Republican]] and Socialist movement. A main component of the [[workers' movement]], popular education was also strongly influenced by [[positivism|positivist]], [[materialism|materialist]] and [[laïcité]], if not [[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]], ideas.

Popular education may be defined as an educational technique designed to raise the [[consciousness]] of its participants and allow them to become more aware of how an individual's personal experiences are connected to larger societal problems.  Participants are empowered to act to effect change on the problems that affect them.

===19th century===

One of the roots of popular education was the [[Marquis de Condorcet|Condorcet report]] during the 1789 [[French Revolution]]. These ideas became an important component of the [[Republicanism (historical)|Republican]] and Socialist movement.  Following the split of the [[First International]] at the 1872 [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress]] between the "anti-authoritarian socialists" (anarchists) and the [[Marxist]]s, popular education remained an important part of the [[workers' movement]], in particular in the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] movement, strong in [[Anarchism in France|France]], [[Anarchism in Spain|Spain]] and [[Anarchism in Italy|Italy]]. It was one of the important theme treated during the 1907 [[International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam]].

==== France ====

During the [[French Second Empire|Second Empire]], [[Jean Macé]] founded the ''[[Ligue de l'enseignement]]'' (Teaching League) in 1866; during the Lille Congress in 1885, Macé reaffirmed the [[Freemason|masonic]] inspiration of this league devoted to popular instruction. Following the 1872 [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress]] and the split between Marxists and anarchists, [[Fernand Pelloutier]] set up in France various ''[[Bourses du travail]]'' centres, where workers gathered and discussed politics and sciences.

The [[Jules Ferry laws]] in the 1880s, establishing free, laic (non-religious), mandatory and public education, were one of the founding stones of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] (1871–1940), set up in the aftermaths of the 1870 [[Franco-Prussian War]] and the [[Paris Commune]].

Furthermore, most of the teachers, who were throughout one of the main support of the Third Republic, so much that it has been called the ''République des instituteurs'' ("Republic of Teachers"), while the teachers themselves were called, because of their [[Religion in France|Republican anti-clericalism]], the ''hussards noirs de la République'', supported [[Alfred Dreyfus]] against the conservatives during the [[Dreyfus Affair]]. One of its consequences was for them to set up free educational lectures of [[Humanism|humanist]] topics for adults in order to struggle against the spread of [[anti-semitism]], which was not limited to the far-right but also affected the workers' movement.

[[Paul Robin]]'s work at the [[Prévost orphanage]] of [[Cempuis]] was the model for [[Francisco Ferrer]]'s [[Escuela Moderna]] in Spain.  Robin taught atheism and internationalism, and broke new ground with co-ed schooling, and teaching orphans with the same respect given to  other children.  He taught that the individual should develop in harmony with the world, on the physical, moral, and intellectual planes.

==== Scandinavia ====
In Denmark, the concept of ''[[folk high school]]'' was pioneered in 1844 by [[N. F. S. Grundtvig]]. By 1870, Denmark had 50 of these institutions. The first in Sweden, ''Folkhögskolan Hvilan,'' was established in 1868 outside of Lund.

In 1882, liberal and socialist students at [[Uppsala University]] in Sweden founded the association ''Verdandi'' for popular education. Between 1888 and 1954 it published 531 educational booklets on various topics (''Verdandis småskrifter'').

Some Swedish proponents of ''folkbildning'' have adopted an anglicisation of ''folkbuilding''&lt;ref&gt;Hektor, S (2005) [http://www.icti.org.uk/journal/vol4_2005/hektor.pdf "A 'Folkbildning' Approach in Media Training"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323233516/http://www.icti.org.uk/journal/vol4_2005/hektor.pdf |date=March 23, 2012 }} in ''Journal of the International Communication Training Institute''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Swedish bibliography on popular education with 25,000 references to books and articles between 1850 and 1950 is integrated in the Libris catalog of the Royal Library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libris.kb.se/form_extended.jsp?q=db%3asfbb&amp;f=sfbb SFbB], Svensk folkbildningsbibliografi (1850–1950).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th century ===

Popular education continued to be an important field of socialist politics, reemerging in particular during the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] in 1936–38, while ''[[Socialism#Self-managed economy|autogestion]]'' (self-management), a main tenet of the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] movement, became a popular slogan following the [[May '68]] revolt.

====Austria====
During the [[Red Vienna]] period (1919–34) the Viennese [[Volkshochschule]] played an important role in providing popular education attracting significant levels of participation from both factory and office workers. They also attracted significant participation from prominent people associated with the [[Vienna Circle]]: [[Otto Neurath]], [[Edgar Zilsel]], [[Friedrich Waismann]] and [[Viktor Kraft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dvorak|first1=Johann|editor1-last=Uebel|editor1-first=Thomas|contribution=Otto Neurath and Adult Education: Unity of Science, Materialism and Comprehensive Enlightenment|date=1991|publisher=Kulwer Academic Publishers|title=Rediscovering the Forgotten Vienna Circle: Austrian Studies on Otto Neurath and the Vienna Circle|location=Dordrecht|pages=265–274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The ''Escuela Moderna'' (1901–1907) ====

The ''[[Escuela Moderna]]'' (Modern School) was founded in 1901 in [[Barcelona]] by free-thinker [[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]], and became a leading inspiration of many various movements.&lt;ref name="Fidler"&gt;Geoffrey C. Fidler, ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/368893 The Escuela Moderna Movement of Francisco Ferrer: "Por la Verdad y la Justicia"]'' in ''[[History of Education Quarterly]]'', vol.25, issue 1/2, Spring-Summer 1985, pages 103–132 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposed to the "dogmas of conventional education Ferrer set a system based on reason, science, and observation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Avrich|first=Paul|title=The Modern School Movement: Anarchism and Education in the United States|year=2006|publisher=AK Press|location=Edinburgh, UK|isbn=1-904859-09-7|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;" The school's stated goal was to "educate the working class in a rational, secular and non-coercive setting".  In practice, high tuition fees restricted attendance at the school to wealthier middle class students. It was privately hoped that when the time was ripe for revolutionary action, these students would be motivated to lead the working classes. It closed in 1906. The ''Escuela Moderna'', and Ferrer's ideas generally, formed the inspiration for a series of ''[[Modern School (United States)|Modern Schools]]'' in the United States,&lt;ref name="Fidler"/&gt; [[Cuba]], South America and London.  The first of these was started in New York City in 1911. It also inspired the Italian newspaper ''[[Università popolare (Italian newspaper)|Università popolare]]'', founded in 1901.

==== France ====
[[Image:Pdc université populaire amlr.png|right|300px|thumb|List of lectures, Université populaire – town of [[Villeurbanne]] – 1936.]]
Following the [[French presidential election, 1981|1981 presidential election]] which brought to power the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] (PS)'s candidate, [[François Mitterrand]], his Minister of Education, [[Alain Savary]], supported Jean Lévi's initiative to create a public high school, delivering the baccalauréat, but organized on the principles of ''[[Socialism#Self-managed economy|autogestion]]'' (or self-management): this high school took the name of ''[[:fr:Lycée autogéré de Paris|Lycée autogéré de Paris]]'' (LAP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.l-a-p.org//|title=Lycée Autogéré de Paris - L'autogestion comme solution.|author=|date=|website=www.l-a-p.org|accessdate=March 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325113026/http://www.l-a-p.org/#|archive-date=March 25, 2018|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LAP explicitly modelled itself after the Oslo Experimental High School, opened in 1967 in Norway, as well as the [[Saint-Nazaire]] Experimental High School, opened six months before the LAP, and the secondary school Vitruve (opened in 1962 in the [[20th arrondissement]] of Paris, still active).{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Theoretical references include [[Célestin Freinet]] and his comrades from the I.C.E.M., as well as [[:fr:Raymond Fonvieille|Raymond Fonvieille]], [[Fernand Oury]], and others theoreticians of "[[institutional pedagogy]]", as well as those coming from the [[institutional analysis]] movement, in particular [[René Lourau]], as well as members of the institutional psychotherapeutic movement, which were a main component in the 1970s of the [[anti-psychiatric movement]] (of which Félix Guattari was an important member). Since 2005, the LAP has maintained contact with self-managed firms, in the REPAS network (''[[:fr:Réseau d'échanges de pratiques alternatives et solidaires|Réseau d'échanges de pratiques alternatives et solidaires]]'', Network of Exchange of Solidarity and Alternative Practices")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reseaurepas.free.fr/dotclear/index.php?post/2013/01/30/Pr%C3%A9sentation-du-R%C3%A9seau-REPAS|title=Présentation du Réseau REPAS|first=|last=repas|date=January 30, 2013|website=www.reseaurepas.free.fr|accessdate=March 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''second generation'' for such ''folk high school'' meant to educate the people and the masses spread in the society (mainly for workers) just before the ''[[Popular Front (France)|French Front populaire]]'' experience, as a reaction among teachers and intellectuals following the [[February 6, 1934 riots]] organized by [[far-right leagues]]. Issues devoted to ''[[free-thinking]]'' such as [[workers' self-management]] were thought and taught during that time, since the majority of attendants were [[proletarian]]s interested in politics. Hence, some received the name of ''Université prolétarienne'' (Proletarian University) instead of ''Université populaire'' (Popular University)&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Éducation populaire|Fr: Education populaire]]&lt;/ref&gt; in some cities around the country. The [[reactionary]] [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] put an end to such projects during World War II. The second generation continued in the post-war period, yet topical lectures turned to be more practical and focused on daily life matters. Nowadays, the largest remnant is located in the [[Bas-Rhin]] and [[Haut-Rhin]] ''départements''.&lt;ref&gt;Von Treitschke, H. (1915). Germany, France, Russia, &amp; Islam. London, Jarrold.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[Vichy France|World War II]], popular teaching attempts were initiated mainly by the [[Anarchism in France|anarchist movement]]. Already in 1943, [[:fr:Joffre Dumazedier|Joffre Dumazedier]], [[:fr:Benigno Cacérès|Benigno Cacérès]], Paul Lengrand, [[Joseph Rovan]] and others founded the ''Peuple et Culture'' (People and Culture) network, aimed at democratization of culture. Joffre Dumazedier conceptualized, at the Liberation, the concept of "cultural development" to oppose the concept of "[[economic development]]", thus foreshadowing the current [[Human Development Index]]. Historian [[Jean Maitron]], for example, was director of the Apremont school in [[Vendée]] from 1950 to 1955.

Such popular educations were also a major feature of [[May '68]] and of the following ''decenie'', leading in particular to the establishment of the [[University of Paris VIII: Vincennes—Saint-Denis]] in Paris, in 1969. The Vincennes University (now located in Saint-Denis) was first a "Experimental University Center," with an interest in reshaping relations between students and teachers (so-called "''[[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarins]]''", in reference to the [[Imperial era of Chinese history|bureaucrats of Imperial China]], for their authority and classic, [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] [[pedagogy]]) as well as between the university itself and society. Thus, Vincennes was largely opened to those who did not have their ''[[baccalauréat]]'' diploma, as well as to foreigners. Its courses were focused on [[Freudo-Marxism]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[Marxist theory]], cinema, theater, [[urbanism]] or [[artificial intelligence]]. Famous intellectuals such as [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Jacques Lacan]] and others held seminars there, in full classrooms where no seats could be found. The assistance was very heterogeneous. For instance, musicians such as [[Richard Pinhas]] assisted at Deleuze's courses, and after having written ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972) with [[Félix Guattari]], Deleuze used to say that non-specialists had best understood their work. Furthermore, Vincennes had no [[amphitheatre]]s, representatives of the ''mandarin'' teacher facing and dominating several hundred students silently taking notes. It also enforced a strict [[Egalitarianism|equality]] between professors and teaching assistants. The student revolt continued throughout the 1970s in both Vincennes and the [[University of Paris X: Nanterre]], created in 1964. In 1980, the [[Minister of Education (France)|Minister of Education]] [[:fr:Alice Saunier-Seïté|Alice Saunier-Seité]] imposed the transfer of Vincennes' University to Saint-Denis. Although education was normalized in the 1980s, during the [[François Mitterrand|Mitterrand]] era, in both Saint-Denis and Vincennes, these universities have retained a less traditional outlook than the classic [[University of Paris I: Panthéon-Sorbonne|Sorbonne]], where courses tend to be more conservative and sociological composition more middle-upper class.

Another attempt in popular education, specifically targeted towards the question of philosophy (France being one of the rare country where this discipline is taught in ''terminale'', the last year of high school which culminate in the ''baccalauréat'' degree) was the creation, in 1983, of the open university named ''[[Collège international de philosophie]]'' (International Philosophy College, or Ciph), by [[Jacques Derrida]], [[François Châtelet]], [[Jean-Pierre Faye]] and [[Dominique Lecourt]], in an attempt to re-think the teaching of philosophy in France, and to liberate it from any institutional authority (most of all from the university). As the ancient ''[[Collège de France]]'', created by [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], it is free and open to everyone. The Ciph was first directed by Derrida, then by [[Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe]], and has had as teaching members [[Giorgio Agamben]], [[Alain Badiou]], [[Sidi Mohamed Barkat]], [[Geoffrey Bennington]], François Châtelet, [[José Gil]], [[Olivier LeCour Grandmaison]], [[Antonio Negri]], and others. The Ciph is still active.

In 2002 philosopher [[Michel Onfray]] initiated [[Université populaire de Caen]]&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Université populaire de Caen|French WP article: Université populaire de Caen]]&lt;/ref&gt; in his hometown and starting a long seminar dealing with ''hedonistic philosophy'' from ancient times to [[May 1968 protests in France|May'68 events in French society]], for at least ten years.&lt;ref&gt;A recorded compilation of his lectures on CD became a hit in France, about 200 000 copies sold: ''Contre-histoire de la philosophie''. [http://pagesperso-orange.fr/michel.onfray/programme_up_Michel_Onfray.htm  Synopsis]&lt;/ref&gt; His very topical subject in this seminar keeps going with a ''free-thinking'' spirit, since people are invited on the whole to rethink the [[history of ideas]] to eliminate any Christian influence. Despite the same name of ''Université populaire'', it is not linked to the European federation of associations inherited from the second generation. In 2004, Onfray expanded the experience&lt;ref&gt;He also published [a book]{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} as a [[manifesto]] to describe his hopes about it: ''La communauté philosophique''.&lt;/ref&gt; to other cities such as Arras, Lyon, Narbonne, Avignon, and Mons (in [[Belgium]]) ; each with various lectures and teachers joining his idea. The ''Universités populaires'' in [[Argentan]] is meant to deliver a culture of culinary [[taste]]s to nonworking people, through lectures and practises of famous chefs.&lt;ref&gt;The first lecture at Argentan was delivered by the main chef of Crillon motel; Onfray commented on radio he liked to enable such extravagant encounters.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latin America==
Popular education is most commonly understood as an approach to education that emerged in Latin America during the 1930s. Closely linked with [[Marxism]] and particularly [[liberation theology]]. Best known amongst popular educators is the Brazilian [[Paulo Freire]]. Freire, and consequently the popular education movement in Latin America, draws heavily upon the work of [[John Dewey]] and [[Antonio Gramsci]]. One of the features of popular education in Latin America has been [[participatory action research]] (PAR).

In the United States and Canada popular education influenced [[social justice]] education and [[critical pedagogy]], though there are differences. At the same time, however, there are examples of popular education in the U.S. and Canada that grew up alongside and independently of popular education in Latin America.

===United States===
Scholar and community-worker [[Myles Horton]] and his [[Highlander Folk School]] (now [[Highlander Research and Education Center]]) and his work in Tennessee can be classified as popular education. Horton's studies at [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]] in New York under [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] in the 1920s parallels the emergence of liberation theology in Latin America and both are heavily influenced by socialism and a focus on the practical relationships between Christianity and everyday life. Niebuhr, however, was a staunch anti-communist while liberation theology has a much closer relationship to the work of [[Karl Marx]]. Additionally, popular education has been linked to [[populism]] and [[land-grant universities]] with their [[cooperative extension service|cooperative extension programs]].

[[McCarthyism]] and the [[red scare]] were used to challenge and in some cases close labor schools and other institutions during the early part of the [[Cold War]], as anticommunists attacked such schools for including communists. Nevertheless, [[Highlander Folk School]], for example, played a significant role in the [[civil rights movement]] providing a space for leaders to consult and plan. And the methods of popular education continue to live on in radical education and community organizing circles, even though U.S. labor unions have largely abandoned the kind of labor education that more directly tied workplace organizing and collective bargaining to class struggle.

The '''Primary Mathematics World Contest''' or '''PMWC''' takes place every year in [[Hong Kong]]. It was first held in 1997, and is sponsored by the [[Po Leung Kuk]] organization. The competition has attracted teams from around the world. Each team consists of 4 members, all of whom must be 13 or younger as of September 1, and must not be enrolled in a secondary institution (or the equivalent).{{Fact|date=August 2007}}
However, the 13th '''Primary Mathematics World Contest''' (2009) was canceled due to the [[WHO]] declaring the [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1]] a pandemic. A similar event occurred in the 7th '''Primary Mathematics World Contest''' (2003) where the committee postponed the contest to November 2003 due to [[SARS]]. The PMWC committee provides room and board at the Panda Hotel in [[Tsuen Wan]].

[[Image:'rear-window' captioning system-fr.svg|thumb|right|250px|The Rear Window Captioning System]]
The '''Rear Window captioning system''' (RWC) is a method for presenting, through [[Closed captioning|captions]], a transcript of the audio portion of a [[film]] in [[theatre]]s for [[deaf]] and [[hearing impairment|hard-of-hearing]] people. The system was co-developed by [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] and Rufus Butler Seder.

On the way into the theatre, viewers pick up a reflective plastic panel mounted on a flexible stalk. The panel sits in a seat [[cupholder]] or on the floor adjacent to the seat. A large [[LED]] display is mounted on a rear [[wall]] that displays caption characters in [[mirror image]]. Viewers move the panels into position (usually below the movie screen) so they can read the reflected captions and watch the movie. It is sometimes necessary to sit in a certain area of the theater to obtain the best angle for reflecting the backward text emitted from the back of the theater on the panel while also being able to view the movie at the same time.

Through this method, all screenings of a film can be accessible to caption viewers. Others seated alongside do not watch, or usually even see, the captions.

Rear Window captioning is an alternative to [[open captions|open captioning]], in which text is permanently visible. Open captioning has been little-used due to the fear that it was too intrusive and noticeable to hearing viewers. However, no studies have been conducted to elicit hearing people's opinions on how they will adapt to reading captions on screen. Rear Window captioning is a form of [[closed captioning]] because the viewer must choose to view the captions.

[[Image:Rearwindow.jpg|thumb|left|Illustrated Example of a Rear Window Captioning System]]
Few movie exhibitors or theater chains choose to provide Rear Window captioning. One of the reasons often stated for not providing Rear Window captioning is the cost of the hardware (as of 2011, approximately US $4,500 per screen for a single installation, less for multiple installations in a multiplex). The cost of captioning a film is on the order of US$4,000 (about $40 per minute).

For blind viewers, [[audio description]] ([[Descriptive Video Service]], '''DVS''') can be and usually is transmitted along with captions. Viewers listen to the descriptions via [[wireless]] [[Headphones|headsets]].

In the Rear Window system, the film print is unaffected. With the transition to Digital Cinema, closed captions are included in many digital cinema packages.

In many movie advertisements by a specific cinema, the "RWC" acronym is often used, much like the [[closed captions|CC]] acronym is used to indicate the availability of [[closed captions]] on television shows.  Often, "RWC/DVS" notation is used, indicating the availability of both Rear Window Captioning and Descriptive Video Service.

'''R. V. Cassill''', full name '''Ronald Verlin Cassill,''' (May 17, 1919 &amp;ndash; March 25, 2002) was a prolific writer, reviewer,  [[editing|editor]], [[Painting|painter]], and [[lithography|lithographer]]. He is most notable for his [[novels]] and [[short stories]], through which he won several awards and grants.

==Life and work==
===Early years and military service===
Cassill was born on May 17, 1919 in [[Cedar Falls, Iowa]] to Howard Cassill, a school superintendent, and Mary Glosser, a teacher; he had two brothers, Donald Cassill and H. Carroll Cassill, and a sister, LaJean. After graduating from Blakesburg High School, he earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[art]] at The [[University of Iowa]] in 1939, where he was a member of the [[Phi Beta Kappa]] Society. From 1942 to 1946, Cassill served the [[United States Army]] in the Medical Administration Core as a first [[lieutenant]], stationed in the South [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific]].

===Studies, early writings, and art work===
Cassill's wartime experiences culminated in his short story "The Conditions of Justice," published in 1947, and won him his first Atlantic Monthly.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Onofrio, Jan. "Iowa Biographical Dictionary", Second Edition. Vol. 1. St. Claire Shores: Somerset, 2000, p. 145-146.&lt;/ref&gt;

For less than a year after having returned from the war, Cassill studied art at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1946,&lt;ref name="nytimesobit"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/01/arts/rv-cassill-novelist-and-writing-teacher-dies-at-82.html | title=R.V. Cassill, Novelist and Writing Teacher, Dies at 82 | publisher=The New York Times Company | work=The New York Times | date=April 1, 2002 | accessdate=9 October 2016 | author=Lehmann-Haupt, Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt; where his artistic skills flourished. He mounted exhibits in Chicago in 1946 and 1948.

After studying in Chicago, he returned to the University of Iowa, earning his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in 1947. In 1949 he briefly served as an instructor at the University's Writer's Workshop before attending the [[Sorbonne]] in 1952 for a year as a [[Fulbright Fellow]], studying comparative literature. Cassill worked as an editor for the Western Review of Iowa City from 1951 to 1952, [[Collier's Encyclopedia]] from 1953 to 1954, and Dude and Gent in 1958.

Cassill wrote about 15 "[[paperback originals]]" in the 1950s and early 1960s. Assessing these early writings, ''The New York Times''' remarked that "Cassill shows that he can combine paperback storytelling at its strongest with subtle literary quality."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blurb.com/b/6596710-nurses-quarters&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching career===
Cassill took a lecturing position at the University of Washington in Seattle in 1955; in 1957 he taught in New York, where he became a lecturer at both [[Columbia University]] and the [[New School for Social Research]]. Between the shift of moving from the west coast to the east coast, Cassill fell in love and married Karilyn Kay Adams on November 23, 1956. Together they had three children, Orin, Jesse, and Erica Cassill. Cassill returned to the University of Iowa in the same capacity in 1960 where he would teach for a few years at the [[Iowa Writer's Workshop]]. Among some of the students who took classes with Cassill at the [[Iowa Writer's Workshop]] during this time, and would later go on to achieve some measure of acclaim, included [[Clark Blaise]], [[Raymond Carver]], and [[Joy Williams (American writer)|Joy Williams]].

His next position was as writer-in-residence at [[Purdue University]] from 1965 to 1966. Soon after beginning teaching at Brown University, Cassill founded the Associated Writing Programs (now known as the [[Association of Writers &amp; Writing Programs]]) in 1967. 
Cassill was appointed Associate Professor at [[Brown University]] in 1966 and then to Professor of English in 1972 where he remained until his retired from teaching as Professor [[emeritus]] in 1983. In addition to his teaching, Cassill served as U.S. Information Service lecturer in Europe from 1975 to 1976. During this time, he mounted another art exhibit in 1970. After retiring from Brown University, Cassill became the editor of ''The Norton Anthology of Short Fiction'', retaining this position for nearly a quarter century, until his death.&lt;ref name="openroadmedia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openroadmedia.com/contributor/r-v-cassill/#bio-tab|title=R. V.  Cassill - Open Road Media|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Cassill died in the Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, Rhode Island, March 2002. At the time of his death, he was survived by his wife, two sons (Orin E., of [[New York, New York|New York City]], and Jesse B., of [[San Diego, California|San Diego]]), and a daughter, Erica Cassill Wood of [[Saline, Michigan]]; a brother, H. Carroll, of [[Cleveland, Ohio]]; a sister, LaJean Holstein of [[Ellsworth, Maine]]; and seven grandchildren.&lt;ref name="nytimesobit"/&gt;

==Awards==
In 1995 the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] awarded Cassill the Academy Award for Literature.
Cassill received the [[Atlantic Monthly]]'s "Firsts" prize for a short story in 1947. He won the O. Henry short-story award for "The Prize" in 1956.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; He was given a [[Rockefeller Foundation|Rockefeller]] grant in 1954 and a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1968.

==Literary work and legacy==
Cassill's prolific career writing and publishing, along with a wide array of interests beyond fiction, make it difficult to summarize the thematic nature and concerns of his work. His stories and novels concern bucolic life in the midwest, the life of the artist or academic, and at times extend into [[autobiography]]. A preoccupation with the fates of couples, in alienation and union, is exhibited in much of his fiction, as is the warring of emotional and rational impulses in individuals and pairs. A strong visual identification is intrinsic in his prose, likely due to his training as a visual artist. His most famous novels were probably ''Doctor Cobb's Game'' and ''Clem Anderson'',&lt;ref name="openroadmedia.com"/&gt; but both the sheer breadth of his writing, and his pervasive influence as a writing teacher, have secured Cassill's legacy in modern fiction.

Cassill's papers are archived at the Mugar Memorial Library at [[Boston University]].

A '''Sudbury school''' is a type of school, usually for the [[K-12 (education)|K-12]] age range, where students have complete responsibility for their own education, and the school is run by [[direct democracy]] in which students and staff are almost equals.&lt;ref name=Ellis&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Arthur K.|title=Exemplars of curriculum theory|publisher=Eye on Education|year=2004|isbn=1-930556-70-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students independently decide what to do with their time, and tend to learn as a by-product of ordinary experience rather than through coursework. There is no predetermined educational [[syllabus]], prescriptive [[curriculum]] or standardized instruction. This is a form of [[democratic education]].  [[Daniel Greenberg (educator)|Daniel Greenberg]], one of the founders of the original Sudbury Model school, writes that the two things that distinguish a Sudbury Model school are that everyone - adults and children - are treated equally and that there is no authority other than that granted by the [[consent of the governed]].&lt;ref name=Greenberg&gt;{{cite book|last=Greenberg|first=Daniel|title=A Place to Grow|publisher=Sudbury Valley School Press|year=2016|isbn=1-888947-26-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While each Sudbury Model school operates independently and determines their own policies and procedures, they share a common culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bookstore.sudburyvalley.org/product/cyberspace-collection The 2002 Collection], Sudbury Valley School Press, pp5-14&lt;/ref&gt; The intended culture within a Sudbury school has been described with such words as freedom, trust, respect, responsibility and democracy.

The name 'Sudbury' originates from the [[Sudbury Valley School]], founded in 1968 in [[Framingham, Massachusetts]], near [[Sudbury, Massachusetts]]. Though there is no formal or regulated definition of a Sudbury Model school, there are now [[List of Sudbury schools|more than 60 schools that identify themselves with Sudbury]] around the world. Some, though not all, include "Sudbury" in their name. These schools operate as independent entities and are not formally associated in any way.&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt;

==Underlying beliefs==

Sudbury schools are based on:&lt;ref&gt;[https://sudburyvalley.org/node/311 The Birth of a New Paradigm for Education] by Dan Greenberg in The Sudbury Valley School Experience, 3rd ed. (Sudbury Valley School Press; Framingham, 1992), p. 81ff&lt;/ref&gt;

# The educational belief that children are extremely good at (and therefore do not need to be taught) the main behaviors they will need as adults, such as creativity, imagination, alertness, curiosity, thoughtfulness, responsibility, and judgement. What children lack is experience, which can be gained if adults guide students in open ways.
# The [[Political sociology|sociopolitical]] belief that having full democratic rights in childhood is the best way to become an adult who is comfortable functioning within a democracy.

"The fundamental premises of the school are simple: that all people are curious by nature; that the most efficient, long-lasting, and profound learning takes place when started and pursued by the learner; that all people are creative if they are allowed to develop their unique talents; that age-mixing among students promotes growth in all members of the group; and that freedom is essential to the development of personal responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mimsy Sadofsky|author2=Daniel Greenberg|title=The Kingdom of Childhood: Growing Up at Sudbury Valley School|url=https://bookstore.sudburyvalley.org/product/kingdom-childhood|accessdate=1 May 2013|year=1994|publisher=The Sudbury Valley School Press|isbn=978-1-888947-02-1}}, p. xv&lt;/ref&gt;

==School democracy==
All aspects of governing a Sudbury School are determined by the weekly School Meeting, modeled after the traditional [[New England]] [[town meeting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Students revel in free-for-all|date=1992-04-19|work=Telegram &amp; Gazette|location=Worcester, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt; School Meeting passes, amends and repeals school rules, manages the school's budget, and decides on hiring and firing of staff. Each individual present — including students and staff — has an equal vote, and most decisions are made by simple majority&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In Woodstock, a nonschool with nonteachers.(Hudson Valley Sudbury School, Woodstock, New York)|last=Rowe|first=Claudia|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2002-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

School rules are normally compiled in a law book, updated repeatedly over time, which forms the school's [[code (law)|code of law]]. Usually, there is a set procedure to handle complaints, and most of the schools follow guidelines that respect the idea of [[due process]] of law. There are usually rules requiring an investigation, a [[hearing (law)|hearing]], a [[trial (law)|trial]], a [[sentence (law)|sentence]], and allowing for an [[appeal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Feldman|first=Jay|title=The Moral Behavior of Children and Adolescents at a Democratic School|series=Paper presented at 82nd [[American Educational Research Association]] Meeting|location=[[Seattle]]|year=2001|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED453128}}&lt;/ref&gt; generally following the philosophy that students face the consequences of their own behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Nation of Wimps: The High Cost of Invasive Parenting|last=Marano|first=Hara Estroff|year=2008|publisher=[[Random House]]|isbn=0-7679-2403-7|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Learning==
The Sudbury pedagogical philosophy may be summarized as the following:
Learning is a natural by-product of all human activity.&lt;ref name="Holzman"&gt;{{cite book|title= Schools for Growth: Radical Alternatives To Current Education Models|last= Holzman|first= Lois|authorlink= Lois Holzman|year= 1997|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |location= United Kingdom|isbn= 0-8058-2357-3|pages= 97–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Learning is self-initiated and self-motivated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Self-governed, Sudbury Valley School begins in Massachusetts in History of Education: Selected Moments of the 20th Century|url=http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/research/edu20/moments/1968sudbury.html|first=Daniel|last=Schugurensky|work=[[Ontario Institute for Studies in Education]], [[University of Toronto]]|year=2003|accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The educational model states that there are many ways to learn and that learning is a process someone does, not a process that is done to him or her;&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D. (1987) The Sudbury Valley School Experience [http://bookstore.sudburyvalley.org/product/sudbury-valley-school-experience ''Back to Basics'']. Retrieved, December 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the model the presence and guidance of a teacher is not necessary.

The free exchange of ideas and free conversation and interplay between people provides broad exposure to areas that may prove relevant and interesting to students. Students are of all mixed ages. The older students learn from younger students and vice versa. The presence of older students provides role models, both positive and negative, for younger students.  The pervasiveness of play has led to a recurring observation by first-time visitors to a Sudbury school that the students appear to be in perpetual "[[recess (break)|recess]]".&lt;ref name="Holzman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/200809/why-we-should-stop-segregating-children-age-part-i-the-value-play-in-the-z|title=Why We Should Stop Segregating Children by Age: Part I--The Value of Play in the Zone of Proximal Development |date=2008-09-09|accessdate=2009-10-25 |last=Gray |first=Peter |publisher=Psychology Today |authorlink=Peter Gray (psychologist)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Implicitly and explicitly, students are given responsibility for their own education:  The only person designing what a student will learn is the student. Exceptions are when a student asks for a particular class or arranges an [[apprenticeship]]. Sudbury schools do not compare or rank students — the school requires no tests, evaluations, or transcripts.

Reading is treated the same as any other subject: Students learn to read when they choose, or simply by going about their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Harnish (2015). [https://sudburyvalley.org/blog/will-they-ever-learn-read "Will they ever learn to read?"] Sudbury Valley School Blog.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Only a few kids seek any help at all when they decide to learn. Each child seems to have their own method. Some learn from being read to, memorizing the stories and then ultimately reading them. Some learn from cereal boxes, others from game instructions, others from street signs. Some teach themselves letter sounds, others syllables, others whole words. To be honest, we rarely know how they do it, and they rarely tell us."&lt;ref name="Greenberg1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Greenberg|title=Free at Last: The Sudbury Valley School Press|url=https://bookstore.sudburyvalley.org/product/free-last|accessdate=1 May 2013|date=1 June 1995|publisher=The Sudbury Valley School Press|isbn=978-1-888947-00-7}}, p34 &lt;/ref&gt;

Sudbury Valley School claims that all of their students have learned to read. While students learn to read at a wide variety of ages, there appears to be no drawback to learning to read later: No one who meets their older students could guess the age at which they first learned to read.&lt;ref name="Greenberg1995" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Taylor Gatto (2000-2003) The Underground History of American Education - A Schoolteacher's Intimate Investigation Into The Problem Of Modern Schooling, Chapter Three - Eyeless In Gaza, [http://johntaylorgatto.com/chapters/3d.htm ''The Sudbury Valley School''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102154119/http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/chapters/3d.htm |date=2010-01-02 }}. Retrieved, December 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with related models==

The model differs in some ways from other types of democratic schools and [[anarchistic free school|free schools]], but there are many similarities:
* '''De-emphasis of [[class (education)|classes]]:''' There is no curriculum or set of required courses. Instead learner interest guides things, with students studying what they want to study.&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt; There are generally no classrooms, just rooms where people choose to congregate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peramas|first=Mary|title=The Sudbury School and Influences of Psychoanalytic Theory on Student-Controlled Education|journal=Essays in Education|volume=19|pages=119(15)|date=Winter 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Age mixing:''' students are not separated into age-groups of any kind and are allowed to mix freely, interacting with those younger and older than themselves; free age-mixing is emphasized as a powerful tool for learning and development in all ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psichi.org/Pubs/Articles/Article_645.aspx |title=Nature's Powerful Tutors; The Educative Functions of Free Play |accessdate=2009-07-25 |publisher=The National Honor Society in Psychology |last=Gray |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Gray (psychologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Autonomous democracy:''' parents have limited involvement or no involvement in the school administration; Sudbury schools are run by a democratic school meeting where the students and staff participate exclusively and equally. Such meetings are also the sole authority on hiring and firing of staff, unlike most other schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Promises Kept|last= Gross|first= Steven J.|year= 2004|publisher=[[Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development]]|location= United States|isbn= 0-87120-973-X|page= 140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Test of Basic Aviation Skills''' (TBAS) is a computerized psychomotor test battery used as a tool for the selection of [[United States Air Force]] pilot candidates. It was created as a replacement for the Basic Attributes Test (BAT) which was in use from 1993 to 2006.  TBAS scores are combined with the candidate's Air Force Officer Qualifying Test (AFOQT) scores, and flying hours to produce a [[Pilot Candidate Selection Method]] (PCSM) score.&lt;ref name="official"&gt;[https://pcsm.aetc.af.mil/BatInfoPage/BatInfo.htm Official TBAS Page]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved March 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The PCSM score provides a measure of a candidate's aptitude for pilot training and is a significant part of the selection process. As of August 14, 2006 the TBAS is operational at all testing sites and the BAT has been retired.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?storyID=123021346 AETC deploys new pilot screening for fiscal '07] by 2nd Lt. Kirk Reimer. Retrieved March 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and Field Testing==
In 1999, the Air Education and Training Command directed the Studies and Analysis Squadron to develop a new skills battery to incorporate the latest advances in psychomotor and cognitive research.  The Studies and Analysis Squadron partnered with the Naval Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory and the US Air Force Academy to develop the TBAS as a possible BAT replacement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://google.com/search?q=cache:http://hfetag.dtic.mil/briefs/55-personnel-Olde.pps Psychomotor Testing in Naval Aviation Selection and Demo] by LT Brent Olde. Retrieved March 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Air Force Research Laboratory]], released a report on the "Development and Validation of the
Test of Basic Aviation Skills (TBAS) " in November 2005. According to the report, the TBAS was fielded to 994 Air Force pilot trainees.  The testing showed strong correlations between TBAS scores and potential success at pilot training.
TBAS equipment was shipped to testing locations by July 2006 and was operational at all sites on August 14, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wantscheck.com/PilotSlotResources/TheTBAS/tabid/67/Default.aspx#A1 TBAS Implementation Information WantsChecks Forum TBAS Implementation Information] Retrieved March 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The test equipment consists of a computer, keyboard, mouse, joystick, rudder pedals, and headphones. During the validation of the TBAS the test apparatus was:

|-
|''a 2.80 GHz CPU computer with 512 MB RAM and a 40 GB hard drive, CD ROM and USD port removable media storage devices, and a Microsoft Windows XP operating system. The monitor was a 17-inch flat panel with 0.264 pixel pitch, 1280 by 1024 pixel resolution, and a sync rate of 56 Hz by 75 Hz (vertical by horizontal). The control stick was a ThrustmasterTM Model Hotas Cougar and the rudder pedals were CH ProductsTM Pro Pedals. The computer hardware was housed in a wooden carrel to provide a standardized test environment and reduce distractions.&lt;ref&gt;[Development and Validation of the Test of Basic Aviation Skills (TBAS)] by Thomas R. Carretta.&lt;/ref&gt;''
|}

Whether the same equipment has been deployed at all testing sites remains unclear.

==Test Structure==
The TBAS is composed of 9 subtests each of which either introduces a new skill area or tests a combination of the previous skill areas. Total time to administer the test is less than one hour.

===Directional Orientation Test===
"Measures spatial orientation abilities: The participant must determine a [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]]’s position relative to a target.  The test simultaneously presents a "tracker map” which shows the location and heading of the UAV; and a forward field of view, as seen through a fixed, forward pointing camera of a UAV, which shows a single building surrounded by four parking lots. The task is to click on the parking lot that a computer generated voice instructs.  There are 48 questions." &lt;ref name="official"/&gt;

===3-Digit and 5-Digit Listening Tests===
"Participants are presented with auditory letters and numbers.  They must squeeze the trigger when they hear any of the three or five specified numbers. The test lasts approximately three minutes." &lt;ref name="official"/&gt;

===Horizontal Tracking Test (HTT)===
"Participants use rudder pedals to keep a box over an airplane as it moves horizontally along the bottom of the screen.  The airplane moves at a constant speed and changes direction when it “hits” the side of the screen or if a participant successfully targets it for multiple seconds. The task lasts three minutes and the level of difficulty (speed of the airplane) increases as the task progresses." &lt;ref name="official"/&gt;

===Airplane Tracking Test (ATT)===
"Participants use the joystick to keep the gun sight on the airplane as it moves at a constant rate. The airplane randomly changes direction when it hits the side of the screen or if a participant successfully targets it for multiple seconds." &lt;ref name="official"/&gt;

===Airplane and Horizontal Tracking Test===
"This test requires you to perform two previously tested tasks simultaneously.  First, you track an airplane moving along a horizontal axis as you did in the Horizontal Tracking Test.  Second, you track an airplane moving in two dimensions as you did in the Airplane Tracking Test."&lt;ref name="official"/&gt;

===ATT, HTT, and Listening Tests===
"This test requires you to perform three previously tested tasks simultaneously.  First, you will track an airplane moving along a horizontal axis as you did in the Horizontal Tracking Test.  Second, you will track an airplane moving in two dimensions as you did in the Airplane Tracking Test.  Third, you will respond when you hear any of the three or five specified target numbers." &lt;ref name="official"/&gt;

===Emergency Scenario Test===
"Participants simultaneously perform the horizontal tracking task and the airplane tracking task, they are presented with three emergency scenarios (one at a time) which they must cancel out by typing a code with the keyboard." &lt;ref name="official"/&gt;

==Scoring the TBAS==
The scoring of the test is kept secret, and TBAS scores are never explicitly reported, but as the score is a component of the PCSM score, a general idea of one's performance can be gleaned from the PCSM score.&lt;ref name="official"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060517002920/http://www.datavise.net/PCSMINFO/TbasOverview.html Datavise] Retrieved December 31, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tile has partnered with Blunt Umbrellas to create a "smart" umbrella that can be located through Tile when it gets lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pelletiere|first1=Nicole|title='Smart' Umbrellas You Can't Lose|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/smart-umbrellas-lose/story?id=26487930|accessdate=12 March 2016|work=ABC News|date=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==
Tile's developers used Selfstarter, an [[open source]] website platform, to [[crowdfunding|crowdfund]] the project through pre-orders.

As of July 7, 2013, Tile had raised over {{US$|2.6{{nbsp}}million|link=yes}} by selling preordered Tiles directly to 50,000 backers through their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tile Grabs $2.6M Via Selfstarter For Its Lost Property-Finding Bluetooth Tags Plus App|author=Natasha Lomas|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/24/tile-grabs-2-6m-via-selfstarter-for-its-lost-property-finding-bluetooth-tags-plus-app/|publisher=TechCrunch|accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Tile raised additional Series A funding of US$13 million led by [[GGV Capital]] and a further US$3 million from [[Khosla Ventures]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/10/01/embargo-101-9am-tile/|title=Tile has $13M and dreams of helping Android users find their keys, too|date=2014-10-01|work=VentureBeat|access-date=2018-04-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Tile snags $3 million from Khosla Ventures to build a crowdsourced lost-and-found network|url = http://fortune.com/2015/06/09/tile-khosla/|website = Fortune|accessdate = September 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lawsuit ==
Tile's founder Nick Evans was sued, along with his company [[Reveal Labs]], on November 7, 2013, for allegedly stealing the Tile idea while Nick was under employment by [[Jonathan C. Coon]].

The case was eventually settled out of court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dockets.justia.com/docket/california/candce/3:2013cv05191/271758 Coon vs. Nick Evans]. Justia. Retrieved August 4, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often referred to as "the father of modern yoga,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yoga.about.com/od/typesofyoga/p/Krishnamacharya.htm|title=Krishnamacharya – Father of Modern Yoga|date=July 15, 2011|work=[[About.com]]|accessdate=October 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yogajournal.com/wisdom/2590|title=Memories of a Master|work=YogaJournal.com|accessdate=October 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yogajournal.com/wisdom/2605|title=The YJ Interview: Partners in Peace|work=YogaJournal.com|accessdate=October 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krishnamacharya is widely regarded as one of the most influential yoga teachers of the 20th century and is credited with the revival of [[hatha yoga]].&lt;ref name="Ruiz" /&gt;

Krishnamacharya held degrees in all the six Vedic ''[[darśana]]s'', or Indian philosophies.  While under the patronage of the King of Mysore, [[Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV]], Krishnamacharya traveled around India giving lectures and demonstrations to promote yoga, including such feats as stopping his heartbeat.&lt;ref&gt;Mohan, ''[[Krishnamacharya: His Life and Teachings]],'' p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  He is widely considered as the architect of ''[[vinyāsa]]'',&lt;ref name="Ruiz" /&gt; in the sense of combining breathing with movement.  Underlying all of Krishnamacharya’s teachings was the principle “Teach what is appropriate for an individual.”&lt;ref&gt;Mohan, ''[[Krishnamacharya: His Life and Teachings]],'' p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; While he is revered in other parts of the world as a yogi, in India Krishnamacharya is mainly known as a healer who drew from both ayurvedic and yogic traditions to restore health and well-being to those he treated.&lt;ref name="Ruiz"&gt;Ruiz 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; He authored four books on yoga—''Yoga Makaranda'' (1934), ''Yogaasanagalu'' (c. 1941),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Singleton |first= Mark |title= Yoga Body: The Origins of Modern Posture Practice |year= 2010 |publisher= Oxford University Press | edition = Kindle | location= USA |isbn= 978-0-19-539534-1 |page= Kindle Locations 3162–3163}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Yoga Rahasya'', and ''Yogavalli'' (Chapter 1 – 1988)—as well as several essays and poetic compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Mohan, ''[[Krishnamacharya: His Life and Teachings]],'' pp. 128–130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Krishnamacharya's students include many of yoga’s most renowned teachers: [[Indra Devi]] (1899–2002), [[Pattabhi Jois|K. Pattabhi Jois]] (1915–2009), [[B.K.S. Iyengar]] (1918-2014), [[T.K.V. Desikachar]] (1938-2016), Srivatsa Ramaswami (born 1939), and [[A. G. Mohan]] (born 1945). Krishnamacharya was the brother-in-law of B.K.S. Iyengar, the founder of the style of yoga known as "[[Iyengar Yoga]]," who credits Krishnamacharya with encouraging him to learn yoga as a young person in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Iyengar, B.K.S. (2006).

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Krishnamacharya was born on November 18, 1888 in Muchukundapura, situated in the [[Chitradurga district]] of present-day [[Karnataka]], in South [[India]], to an orthodox [[Iyengar]] family. His parents were Sri Tirumalai Srinivasa Tatacharya, a well-known teacher of the [[Vedas]], and Shrimati Ranganayakiamma.&lt;ref&gt;Mohan, ''[[Krishnamacharya: His Life and Teachings]],'' p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Krishnamacharya was the eldest of six children. He had two brothers and three sisters.  At the age of six, he underwent [[upanayana]].&lt;ref name="aysnyc.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aysnyc.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=41&amp;Itemid=37|title=Ashtanga Yoga Shala NYC – Krishnamacharya – The King and the Young Man|author=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then began learning to speak and write [[Sanskrit]], from texts such as the [[Amarakosha]] and to chant the Vedas under the strict tutelage of his father.&lt;ref name="kym.org" /&gt;  Krishnamacharya's father also taught him asanas and pranayama.

When Krishnamacharya was ten, his father died,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pierce |first=Martin |title=A Lion in Winter |journal=Yoga Journal |volume= |date=January–February 1988 |pages=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the family had to move to [[Mysore]], the second largest city in [[Karnataka]], where Krishnamcharya's great-grandfather H.H. Sri Srinivasa Brahmatantra Parakala Swami, was the head of the [[Parakala Mutt|Parakala Math]] (there were two by that name between 1835–1873 CE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parakalamatham.org/taxonomy/term/11 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630084518/http://www.parakalamatham.org/taxonomy/term/11 |archivedate=30 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;). In Mysore, Krishnamacharya began a more formal schooling at the Chamaraj Sanskrit College and in the Math. He made a practice of debating on the subjects of the ''[[Shastra]]s'' with the professors and visiting ''[[Pandit]]s''.&lt;ref name="aysnyc.org" /&gt; Krishnamacharya passed his [[Vidwan|Vidvan]] examination in Mysore, where he had studied ''[[Vyakarana]]'', ''[[vedanta]]'', and ''[[Indian logic|tarka]]''.

At the age of sixteen, Krishnamacharya had a strange dream in which his ancestor, the legendary yogi and [[Sri Sampradaya|Sri Vaishnava]] saint [[Nathamuni]] directed him to go to the town of [[Alwarthirunagiri|Alvar Tirunagari]], in the neighboring state of [[Tamil Nadu]]. Krishnamacharya obeyed the dream and traveled there. As Krishnamacharya later told, when he arrived at his destination, he fell into a trance and found himself in the presence of three sages. He requested the sages to instruct him in the ''Yoga Rahasya'', a long-lost yogic treatise by Nathamuni. One of the sages, whom he later identified as Nathamuni himself, began reciting the text. When Krishnamacharya later awoke from the trance, he could recall all the verses of this legendary treatise.

=== Scholastic education ===
Krishnamacharya spent much of his youth traveling through India studying the six ''[[Hindu philosophy|darśana]]'' or Indian philosophies: ''[[Vaisheshika|vaiśeṣika]]'', ''[[Nyaya|nyāya]]'', ''[[Samkhya|sāṃkhya]]'', ''[[yoga]]'', ''[[Mimamsa|mīmāṃsā]]'' and ''[[Vedanta|vedānta]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kheper.net/topics/eastern/6darshanas.htm{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, at the age of eighteen, Krishnamacharya left Mysore to attend the university at [[Varanasi|Benares]], also known as Vārānasī, a city of hundreds of temples and a highly regarded North Indian center of traditional learning.&lt;ref&gt;Mohan, ''[[Krishnamacharya: His Life and Teachings]],'' p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; While at the university, he focused his studies on logic and Sanskrit, working with Brahmashri Shivakumar Shastry, "one of the greatest grammarians of the age".&lt;ref&gt;Desikachar, T.K.V., ''Health, Healing, &amp; Beyond'', p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; He also learned the Mimamsa from Brahmasri Trilinga Rama Shastri.&lt;ref name="kym.org" /&gt; Krishnamacharya learned ''tarka'' from Vamacarana Bhattacharya. He also forged a strong friendship with the head of [[Varanasi|Kāśi]] [[Government Sanskrit College, Varanasi|Sanskrit Vidyā Pīṭha]], [[Ganganath Jha|Mahāmahopādhyāya Gaṅgānāth Jhā]].

After leaving Benares, in 1909, Krishnamacharya returned to Mysore and studied ''vedānta'' with the new pontiff of Parakāla Math, H. H. Sri Krishna Brahmatantra. During this period Krishnamacharya learned to play the ''[[Veena|vīṇā]]'', one of the most ancient stringed instruments in India. Besides Math, Krishnamacharya also studied at the University of Mysore.

In 1914, Krishnamacharya once again left for Benares to attend classes at Queens College, where he eventually earned a number of teaching certificates. During the first year he had little or no financial support from his family. In order to eat, he followed the rules that were laid down for religious beggars: he was to approach only seven households each day and was to offer a prayer "in return for wheat flour to mix with water for cakes".&lt;ref&gt;Desikachar, T.K.V., ''Health, Healing, &amp; Beyond'', p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Krishnamacharya eventually left Queens College to study the ''ṣaḍdarśana'' (six darshanas) in Vedic philosophy at [[Patna University]], in Bihar, a state in eastern India. He also received a scholarship to study Ayurveda under Vaidya Krishnakumar of Bengal.&lt;ref name="kym.org" /&gt;

Krishnamacharya was invited to the coronation of the Rajah of Dikkanghat (a principality within [[Darbhanga]]), at which he defeated a scholar called Bihari Lal in a debate, and received rewards and honors from the Raja.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aysnyc.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=41&amp;Itemid=184|title=Ashtanga Yoga Shala NYC – Krishnamacharya – The King and the Young Man|author=guy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His stay in [[Varanasi|Benares]] lasted 11 years.

=== Education in yoga ===
During all this time Krishnamacharya continued to practice the yoga that his father had taught him as a young boy. Krishnamacharya also studied with the yoga master Sri Babu Bhagavan Das and passed the Samkhya Yoga Examination of Patna.&lt;ref name="kym.org" /&gt; Many of Krishnamacharya's instructors recognized his outstanding abilities in the study and practice of yoga and supported his progress. Some asked that he teach their children.&lt;ref name="Mohan, p. 3"&gt;Mohan, ''[[Krishnamacharya: His Life and Teachings]],'' p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his vacations, which would last about three months, Krishnamacharya made pilgrimages into the [[Himalayas]].&lt;ref name="Mohan, p. 3" /&gt;  At the suggestion of Gaṅgānāth Jhā, Krishnamacharya sought to further his yoga studies by seeking a master named Yogeshwara Ramamohana Brahmachari, who was rumored to live in the mountains beyond Nepal. For this venture, Krishnamacharya had to obtain the permission of the Viceroy in Simla, Lord Irwin, who was then suffering from diabetes.&lt;ref name="Mohan, p. 3" /&gt;   At the request of the Viceroy, Krishnamacharya travelled to Simla and taught him yogic practices for six months. The viceroy’s health improved and he developed respect and affection for Krishnamacharya.&lt;ref&gt;Mohan, ''[[Krishnamacharya: His Life and Teachings]],'' pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1919, the Viceroy made arrangements for Krishnamacharya’s travel to Tibet, supplying three aides and taking care of the expenses.

After two and a half months of walking, Krishnamacharya arrived at Sri Brahmachari’s school, a remote cave at the foot of [[Mount Kailash]], where the master lived with his wife and three children.&lt;ref name="Ruiz" /&gt;  Under Brahmachari’s tutelage, Krishnamacharya spent seven and a half years&lt;ref&gt;Mohan, ''[[Krishnamacharya: His Life and Teachings]],'' p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  studying the ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga Sūtras]]'' of [[Patañjali]], learning ''[[asana|āsanas]]'' and ''[[pranayama|prāṇāyāma]]'', and studying the therapeutic aspects of yoga”.&lt;ref name="Ruiz"/&gt; He was made to memorize the whole of the ''Yoga Kuruntha'' in the Gurkha language. As tradition holds, at the end of his studies with the guru, Krishnamacharya asked what his payment would be. The master responded that Krishnamacharya was to "take a wife, raise children and be a teacher of Yoga".&lt;ref&gt;Desikachar, T.K.V., ''Health, Healing, &amp; Beyond'', p.44&lt;/ref&gt;

Krishnamacharya then returned to [[Varanasi|Vārāṇasī]]. The Mahārāja of Jaipur called him to serve as principal of the Vidyā Śālā in Jaipur; but as he did not like being answerable to many people, Krishnamacharya shortly returned to Vārāṇasī. In accordance with his guru's wish that he live the life of a householder, Krishnamacharya married Namagiriamma in 1925. After his marriage, Krishnamacharya was forced by circumstance to work in a coffee plantation in the Hasan district. It was after a lecture on the Upaniṣads in Mysore town hall in 1931 that he attracted the attention as a learned scholar that eventually led to his employment at the palace.&lt;ref name="body"&gt;{{cite book | title=Yoga Body: The Origins of Modern Posture Practice | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Singleton, Mark | year=2010 | location=Oxford | pages=273 | isbn=978-0-19-539535-8}} p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Impressed with Krishnamacharya’s knowledge as a scholar and his mastery of yoga, Amarnātha Jhā, the son of Gaṅgānāth Jhā, introduced Krishnamacharya to various monarchs, and he was widely honoured by them.

=== Mysore years ===

[[File:Krishnamacharya mysoreSchool.jpg|thumb|Krishnamacharya in a yoga demonstration]]

In 1926, the [[Maharaja of Mysore]], [[Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV]] (1884–1940) was in [[Varanasi]] to celebrate the 60th birthday of his mother and heard about Krishnamacharya's learning and skill as a yoga therapist.&lt;ref name="Desikachar, T.K.V. p. 87"&gt;Desikachar, T.K.V., ''Health, Healing, &amp; Beyond'', p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;  The Maharaja met Krishnamacharya and was so impressed by the young man's demeanor, authority, and scholarship that he engaged Krishnamacharya to teach him and his family.&lt;ref name="Desikachar, T.K.V. p. 87" /&gt;  Initially, Krishnamacharya was installed to teach yoga at the [[Mysore Palace]].&lt;ref name="Sjoman 1999 52"&gt;{{cite book |last= Sjoman |first= N.E. |title= The Yoga Tradition of the Mysore Palace | edition = 2nd | year= 1999|publisher= Abhinav Publications |location= New Delhi, India|isbn= 81-7017-389-2 |page= 52}}&lt;/ref&gt; He soon became a trusted advisor of the Maharajah, and was given the recognition of Asthana Vidwan&amp;nbsp;— the intelligentsia of the palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Iyengar|first= B.K.S. |authorlink= B.K.S. Iyengar |title= Astadala Yogamala |year= 2000 |publisher= Allied Publishers |location= New Delhi, India |isbn= 978-8177640465
|page= 53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s, Krishnamacharya held many demonstrations to stimulate popular interest in yoga. These included suspending his pulse, stopping cars with his bare hands, performing difficult asanas, and lifting heavy objects with his teeth.&lt;ref name="Ruiz" /&gt;  The Palace archive records show that the Maharaja was interested in the promotion of yoga and continually sent Krishnamacharya around the country to give lectures and demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Sjoman |first= N.E. |title= The Yoga Tradition of the Mysore Palace | edition = 2nd | year= 1999|publisher= Abhinav Publications |location= New Delhi, India|isbn= 81-7017-389-2 |page= 53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, Krishnamacharya was invited to teach at the Sanskrit College in Mysore.  The Maharaja, who felt that yoga had helped cure his many ailments, asked Krishnamacharya to open a yoga school under his patronage&lt;ref name="Ruiz" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mohan, ''[[Krishnamacharya: His Life and Teachings]],'' p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; and was subsequently given the wing of a nearby palace, the [[Jaganmohan Palace]], to start the Yogashala, an independent yoga institution,&lt;ref name="Sjoman 1999 52" /&gt; which opened on August 11, 1933.&lt;ref name="Desikachar, T.K.V. p. 87" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Singleton |first= Mark |title= Yoga Body: The Origins of Modern Posture Practice |year= 2010 |publisher= Oxford University Press | edition = Kindle | location= USA |isbn= 978-0-19-539534-1 |page= Kindle Locations 3481–3482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, Krishnamacharya authored the book titled ''Yoga Makaranda'', which was published by Mysore University.  In the introduction to ''Yoga Makaranda'', Krishnamacharya lists [[Sritattvanidhi]], a 19th-century treatise containing a yoga section by [[Kingdom of Mysore|Maharaja of Mysore]], [[Krishnaraja Wodeyar III]]  (1794–1868) as one of the sources for his book.  In ''The Yoga Tradition of the Mysore Palace'', [[Norman Sjoman]] asserts that Krishnamacharya was influenced by the [[Sritattvanidhi]] and also the ''Vyayama Dipika'', a Western-based gymnastics manual written by the Mysore Palace gymnasts.&lt;ref name="cushman"&gt;{{cite web|title=Yoga Through Time|url=http://www.yogajournal.com/wisdom/466|last1=Cushman|first1 =Anne | publisher = Yoga Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV died and his nephew and successor, [[Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar]] (1919–1974), showed less interest in yoga and no longer provided support for publishing texts and sending teams of teachers to surrounding areas.&lt;ref&gt;Desikachar, T.K.V., ''Health, Healing, &amp; Beyond'', p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;  Following political changes in 1946, around the time that India gained independence, the powers of the maharajas were curtailed, a new government came into being.  Funding for the yoga school was cut off&lt;ref name="Desikachar, T.K.V. p. 96"&gt;Desikachar, T.K.V., ''Health, Healing, &amp; Beyond'', p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; and Krishnamacharya struggled to maintain the school.    At the age of 60 (1948), Krishnamacharya was forced to travel extensively to find students and provide for his family.&lt;ref name="Desikachar, T.K.V. p. 96" /&gt;  The yogashala in Mysore was ordered to be closed by [[K.C. Reddy]], the first Chief Minister of Mysore State, and the school eventually closed in 1950.&lt;ref name="Ruiz" /&gt;

=== Madras years ===
After leaving Mysore, Krishnamacharya moved to [[Bangalore]] for a couple of years&lt;ref&gt;Desikachar, T.K.V., ''Health, Healing, &amp; Beyond'', p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; and then was invited in 1952 to relocate to [[Madras]], by a well-known lawyer who sought Krishnamacharya’s help in healing from a stroke. By now, Krishnamacharya was in his sixties, and his reputation for being a strict and intimidating teacher had mellowed somewhat.

[[File:Krishnamacharya teaching.jpg|thumb|Krishnamacharya teaching a child]]

In Madras, Krishnamacharya accepted a job as a lecturer at Vivekananda College. He also began to acquire yoga students from diverse backgrounds and in various physical conditions, which required him to adapt his teaching to each student’s abilities. For the remainder of his teaching life, Krishnamacharya continued to refine this individualized approach, which came to be known as [[Viniyoga]].&lt;ref name="Ruiz" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mohan, ''[[Krishnamacharya: His Life and Teachings]],'' pp. 38-43.&lt;/ref&gt; Many considered Krishnamacharya a yoga master, but he continued to call himself a student because he felt that he was always “studying, exploring and experimenting” with the practice.&lt;ref&gt;Desikachar, T.K.V., ''Health, Healing, &amp; Beyond'', p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his life, Krishnamacharya refused to take credit for his innovative teachings but instead attributed the knowledge to his guru or to ancient texts.&lt;ref name="Ruiz" /&gt;

At the age of 96, Krishnamacharya fractured his hip.  Refusing surgery, he treated himself and designed a course of practice that he could do in bed. Krishnamacharya lived and taught in Chennai until he slipped into a coma and died in 1989, at one hundred years of age. His cognitive faculties remained sharp until his death; and he continued to teach and heal whenever the situation arose.

Although his knowledge and teaching has influenced yoga throughout the world, Krishnamacharya never left his native India. ''Yoga Journal'' said that: {{quote|You may never have heard of him but Tirumalai Krishnamacharya influenced or perhaps even invented your yoga. Whether you practice the dynamic series of Pattabhi Jois, the refined alignments of B. K. S. Iyengar, the classical postures of Indra Devi, or the customized vinyasa of Viniyoga, your practice stems from one source: a five-foot, two-inch Brahmin born more than one hundred years ago in a small South Indian village.&lt;ref name="Ruiz" /&gt;}}

By developing and refining different approaches, Krishnamacharya made yoga accessible to millions around the world.&lt;ref name="Ruiz" /&gt;

== Approach to healing ==
Krishnamacharya was not only a yoga instructor but also a physician of Ayurvedic medicine. He “possessed enormous knowledge of nutrition, herbal medicine, the use of oils, and other remedies”.&lt;ref&gt;Desikachar, T.K.V., ''Health, Healing, &amp; Beyond'', p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;  Krishnamacharya’s custom as an Ayurvedic practitioner was to begin by conducting a detailed examination to determine the most efficient path to take for a patient. For example, he would take the patient’s pulse, examine the color of the skin, and listen to the quality of the breath. During the time of diagnosis, Krishnamacharya would look for what “upset or hindered the harmonious union of the body, mind, and spirit.”&lt;ref&gt;Desikachar, T.K.V., ''Health, Healing, &amp; Beyond'', p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; According to Krishnamacharya, even though the source or focus of a disease is in a particular area of the body, he assumed that many other systems in the body, both mental and physical, would also be affected. At some point during or after an initial examination, Krishnamacharya would ask if the patient was willing to follow his guidance. This question was important to a patient’s treatment, because Krishnamacharya felt that if the person could not trust him fully there was little chance of his or her being healed.&lt;ref&gt;Desikachar, T.K.V., ''Health, Healing, &amp; Beyond'', p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a person began seeing Krishnamacharya, he would work with him or her on a number of levels including adjusting their diet; creating herbal medicines; and setting up a series of yoga postures that would be most beneficial. When instructing a person on the practice of yoga, Krishnamacharya particularly stressed the importance of combining breath work ([[pranayama]]) with the postures ([[asanas]]) of yoga and [[meditation]] ([[Dhyana in Hinduism|dhyana]]) to reach the desired goal.&lt;ref&gt;Desikachar, T.K.V., ''Health, Healing, &amp; Beyond'', p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; He would continue to see the person approximately once a week to monitor the progress until he or she was healed.

== Approach to yoga ==
Krishnamacharya “believed Yoga to be India’s greatest gift to the world.”&lt;ref&gt;Desikachar, T.K.V., ''Health, Healing, &amp; Beyond'', p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; His yoga instruction reflected his conviction that yoga could be both a spiritual practice and a mode of physical healing.&lt;ref&gt;Desikachar, T.K.V., ''The Heart of Yoga'', p. xviii&lt;/ref&gt; Krishnamacharya based his teachings on the ''[[Yoga Sutras]]'' of [[Patanjali]] and the ''[[Yoga Yajnavalkya]]''.  Whereas Krishnamacharya was deeply devoted to [[Vaishnavism]], he also respected his students’ varying religious beliefs, or nonbeliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Mohan, ''[[Krishnamacharya: His Life and Teachings]],'' p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;  A former student recalls that while leading a meditation, Krishnamacharya instructed students to close their eyes and “think of God. If not God, the sun. If not the sun, your parents.”&lt;ref name="Ruiz" /&gt; As a result of the teachings he received from his father and other instructors, Krishnamacharya approached every student as “absolutely unique,”&lt;ref&gt;Desikachar, T.K.V., ''Health, Healing, &amp; Beyond'', p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; in the belief that the most important aspect of teaching yoga was that the student be “taught according to his or her individual capacity at any given time”.&lt;ref&gt;Desikachar, T.K.V., ''Health, Healing, &amp; Beyond'', p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; For Krishnamacharya, this meant that the path of yoga would mean different things for different people and that each person should be taught in a manner that he or she understand clearly.&lt;ref&gt;Desikachar, T.K.V., ''The Heart of Yoga'', p. xix&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accomplishment as a scholar ==
Krishnamacharya was highly regarded as a scholar. He earned degrees in philosophy, logic, divinity, philology, and music.&lt;ref name="Ruiz" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mohan, ''[[Krishnamacharya: His Life and Teachings]],'' pp. 3-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was twice offered the position of Acharya in the [[Srivaishnava sampradaya]], but he declined in order to stay with his family, in accordance with his guru’s wishes.&lt;ref name="Ruiz" /&gt;

He also had extensive knowledge of orthodox Hindu rituals. His scholarship in various [[darshanas]] of orthodox Indian philosophy earned him titles such as ''Sāṃkhya-yoga-śikhāmaṇi'', ''Mīmāṃsā-ratna'', ''Mīmāṃsā-thīrtha'', ''Nyāyācārya'', ''Vedāntavāgīśa'', ''Veda-kesari'' and ''Yogācārya''.&lt;ref name="archives.chennaionline.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.chennaionline.com/Personality/art012.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020054022/http://archives.chennaionline.com/Personality/art012.asp |archivedate=20 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''UNIQUe Certification''' is a quality label awarded to Higher Education Institutions, for quality use of ICT ([[Information and communications technology|Information and Communication Technologies]]). The label is managed by the [[EFQUEL]], and was co-developed by the MENON Network, [[EFMD]], and [[Europace]].

The quality of both products and programmes in the field of technology-enhanced learning varies widely. The UNIQUe quality label is a unique concept of quality improvement which is theoretically sound and at the same time is meeting the expectations of practice.

Many of the existing quality initiatives in this field focus heavily, if not solely, on online instructional design. The UNIQUe approach goes above and beyond this, focusing on the use of ICT to enhance educational provision and learning support, throughout the entire breadth of activity of the Higher Education Institution. This sophisticated approach demands an applicant to meet high-quality standards for programme objectives, programme structure, content, resources and learning processes.

==For Who==
The fundamental feature of the UNIQUe approach is to support institutions of higher education to measure how successful they are in technology-enhanced learning and to allow for continuous improvement. Thus,

- UNIQUe is an accelerator for quality improvement and innovation. 
- Providing industry-wide benchmarks, it will dramatically enhance the implementation speed of the Bologna reforms in the area of technology-enhanced learning.
- Compared to other quality initiatives in the area of technology-enhanced learning, UNIQUe has a broader institutional approach and is not only related to e Learning. The - Unique quality label builds on the broadest stakeholder involvement.
- The UNIQUe process is structured in six very distinct stages and offers a formalized approach in each of the steps.
- The UNIQUe quality label provides a certification as a result, next to continuous quality improvement mechanisms.
- The UNIQUe quality label focuses on innovation. UNIQUe ensures continuous quality improvement since it is a diagnostic tool for self-assessment of the institution.

==The process==

The UNIQUe Process is made up of six steps, namely:

1 – Application

2 – Eligibility: The Institution is checked for overall compliance with the UNIQUe scheme

3 – Self-Assessment: The institution embarks on a process of self-analysis and assessment, completing a questionnaire about its processes, and submitting back to a review team.

4 – Peer Review: A three-person review team visits the Institution, to check compliance with the [http://unique.efquel.org/unique-criteria UNIQUe Criteria].

5 – Awarding Body: An independent awarding body, recommends certification or rejection, based upon the recommendation of the reviewers.

6 – Continuous Quality Improvement: the institution's development of ICT policies is continuously monitored, in line with recommendations made by the review team.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21761">The '''United States Navy dog handler hazing scandal''' was a pattern of misconduct engaged in by members of the [[United States Navy]] at [[Naval Support Activity Bahrain]] between 2004 and 2006. Naval investigators documented nearly 100 incidents of abuse committed against several members of a [[Military Working Dog]] (MWD) unit stationed at the United States military base at [[Juffair]]. Documented incidents of abuse include racial intimidation, [[sexual harassment]], physical abuse and anti-gay harassment. One sailor, [[Master-at-arms|Master-At-Arms]] 3rd Class [[Joseph Rocha (United States Navy)|Joseph Rocha]], suffered [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] because of his abuse at the hands of fellow sailors, and he alleges that another sailor committed suicide because of her treatment. The Navy investigated the allegations in 2007 and documented the abuse, but took little substantive action. However, [[Pennsylvania]] Congressman [[Joe Sestak]], a former [[Vice admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]], demanded a new examination of the report's findings which led to the disciplining of Rocha's former superior, [[Chief Petty Officer#United States|Chief Petty Officer]] Michael Toussaint (later [[Senior Chief Petty Officer]]). The scandal came to widespread public attention as United States President [[Barack Obama]] faced increased pressure to repeal the military's gay-exclusionary policy known as "[[don't ask, don't tell]]" (DADT).

==Alleged abuse of Rocha==
[[File:RochaMWD.png|150px|thumb|right|Joseph Rocha handling a Military Working Dog during his assignment in Bahrain]]
Joseph Rocha joined the United States Navy at the age of 18. He arrived in Bahrain in February 2005 and was assigned to the Military Working Dog unit. Rocha, who is gay but states he adhered to the military's "don't ask, don't tell" (DADT) policy while assigned in Bahrain, became the target of [[hazing]].&lt;ref name = armytimes /&gt; Hazing, which the Navy defines as "any conduct whereby a military member or members, regardless of service or rank, without proper authority causes another military member or members, regardless of service or rank, to suffer or be exposed to any activity which is cruel, abusive, humiliating, oppressive, demeaning or harmful",&lt;ref name = gdn&gt;{{Cite news

When Rocha refused to patronize female prostitutes, unit commander then Master-At-Arms 2nd Class Michael Toussaint and others in the unit subjected him to anti-gay taunts and slurs. In another incident he was hogtied with duct tape and rope and locked in a dog kennel filled with feces. He was force-fed dog biscuits while his hands and feet were bound. In an incident Rocha describes as "dehumanizing", he was forced to simulate oral sex on another male sailor while being video taped, supposedly as part of a training exercise.&lt;ref name = armytimes&gt;{{Cite news

Rocha received an [[Military discharge#Honorable|honorable discharge]] under DADT in 2007.&lt;ref name = sdut /&gt;

In February 2011, the Navy Administrative Board determined that Rocha's accusations were exaggerated and that Toussaint was never questioned or given the chance to testify in his own defense. The three-man board reviewed two days of testimony and ruled that the case was based largely on uncorroborated hearsay. Some witnesses contradicted themselves and Rocha acknowledged getting some of the facts wrong in his ''Washington Post'' article and in his original testimony.&lt;ref name="military.com"&gt;Associated Press, "[http://www.military.com/news/article/senior-chief-in-hazing-case-to-retire-at-rank.html?ESRC=eb.nl/ Senior chief in hazing case to retire in grade]", ''[[Military.com]]'', 18 February 2011, retrieved 18 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==2006–2007 investigation==
In 2006 the [[Judge Advocate General's Corps, U.S. Navy|Judge Advocate General's]] office opened an investigation after a sailor new to the unit reported incidents of abuse.&lt;ref name = sdut&gt;{{Cite news

  | accessdate = 2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation, dated April 12, 2007,&lt;ref name = gdn /&gt; documented 93 instances of hazing and other improper conduct that took place within the unit between 2005 and 2006. In addition to Rocha's treatment, the report also documented among other incidents:

* Routine gambling, fraternization and association with prostitutes
* Falsifying paperwork in explosives accountability logs
* Naked female sailors handcuffed together and required to role play an angry lesbian couple as part of another supposed training exercise
* A female sailor was sexually assaulted by another sailor and the assault was not reported up the chain of command&lt;ref name = armytimes /&gt;

In October 2006, Toussaint was transferred out of the unit and Valdivia was placed in charge. On October 10, she was advised of the investigation and feared that she would be scapegoated for the abuse. In December she advised her chain of command of her intention to leave the Navy. On January 11, 2007, she was relieved of duty and placed on "administrative legal hold", meaning she could not transfer, go on leave or exit the Navy.&lt;ref name = pilot&gt;{{Cite news

Following the investigation, which was completed in June 2007, Toussaint not only was not punished for his role in the hazing, he was promoted to Chief Master-At-Arms and assigned to work with elite [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEALS]] at the [[United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group]] at [[Training Support Center Hampton Roads|Dam Neck]] in [[Virginia]]. Valdivia, a former Sailor of the Year who was second in command during the abuse and later the unit commander, was charged with failing to control her unit to stop the abuse. She committed suicide by [[carbon monoxide]] poisoning at her villa in Bahrain. Her body was found on January 16, 2007.&lt;ref name = armytimes /&gt; Another sailor, Petty Officer 3rd Class Jake Wilburn, was taken to an Article 15 hearing and dishonorably discharged after Rocha alleged that Wilburn harassed him; Wilburn, who acknowledges participating in some harassment, unsuccessfully appealed his discharge.&lt;ref name = pilot /&gt; Wilburn went on to run for, and lose, a seat in the [[Missouri General Assembly]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Follow up==

In September 2007, Master-at Arms 2nd Class Shaun Hogan, who had been assigned to the MWD unit, gave copies of the Navy report to [[Youth Radio]], a student internship program based in [[Oakland]], [[California]]. He had received it in response to a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request. Youth Radio posted the redacted report on its website. The case came to the attention of [[Joe Sestak]], then the Congressman from [[Pennsylvania's 7th congressional district]]. Sestak wrote to [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] [[Ray Mabus]] to request an explanation of why Toussaint was promoted after the hazing incidents and suggested that Valdivia's suicide was related to the incidents. In response, Mabus ordered [[Chief of Naval Operations]] Admiral [[Gary Roughead]] to re-examine the original investigation. Roughead "found that the incidents were not in keeping with Navy values and standards and violated the Navy's long-standing prohibition against hazing" according to a Navy spokeswoman.&lt;ref name = ap /&gt;

Based on these findings, Mabus considered a court-martial for Toussaint but ultimately decided against it, because of the amount of time that had passed between the incidents and the report, the previous review of the incidents and the short amount of time between Toussaint's return from an overseas deployment and the end of his enlistment.&lt;ref name=sldn&gt;{{Cite press release

}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 21, the Navy announced that Toussaint would be reassigned to [[Naval Special Warfare Group]] 2 in [[Norfolk, Virginia]] where he would have no command responsibilities. He received a letter of censure. His planned re-enlistment was denied and he was forced to retire in January 2010. Roughead has also ordered the [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]] to re-examine the case.&lt;ref name = ap /&gt; Sestak has called for Congressional hearings into the hazing allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Both Sestak and the Navy have indicated their belief that the conduct of the MWD unit is an isolated phenomenon and not indicative of any military-wide culture. Sestak characterized the MWD unit as an "aberration" and a "rogue unit".&lt;ref name = cnn&gt;{{Cite news

This was a unit that was improperly led, and apparently the leadership was allowing things to occur — and in some cases encouraging things to occur — that were absolutely unacceptable. [but] I would absolutely deny that there was a culture that promoted this sort of thing."&lt;ref name = armytimes /&gt;

In January 2010, [[Chief of Naval Operations]] Admiral [[Gary Roughead]] issued formal letters of counseling to Vice Admiral [[Robert Conway (admiral)|Robert Conway]] and Captain Gary Galloway for their actions related to the incidents and subsequent investigation.  Conway, former head of [[Commander, Navy Installations Command (United States)|Navy Installations Command]] and the highest-ranking officer to sign off on a June 2007 investigation into the abuse, was chastised for not doing more to ensure that officers in his chain of command were sufficiently addressing the hazing allegations.  Conway retired in April 2009.  Galloway, former commander of the Bahrain base at the time of the incidents in question, was scolded for not acting quickly and firmly to verify the nature of the alleged behavior and ensure that prohibitions against hazing were enforced. Galloway, as of January 2010, was assigned to [[Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center San Diego]]. The letters of counseling will not be included in either officers' permanent personnel files.&lt;ref name="Wiltrout, Kate 2010"/&gt;

The Navy held a retirement pay hearing for Touissant at [[Naval Station Norfolk|Norfolk Naval Station]] in February 2010. The government argued for him to be retired as a petty officer first class. After two days of testimony and 30 minutes of deliberation, the panel unanimously recommended that Touissant be retired as a senior chief petty officer. An assistant secretary of the Navy has the final decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  | accessdate = 2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Servicemembers Legal Defense Network]], a legal support and advocacy group for current and former LGBT military personnel, contacted Secretary Mabus with its concerns over this outcome, stating that it sends the message that as long as LGBT people are subject to separation under "[[don't ask, don't tell]]" they can be abused by those above them in the chain of command with little regard for consequences. SLDN called upon Mabus to overrule the decision of the retirement panel and "retire Toussaint at the pay-grade at which he last served honorably and that Toussaint be given a discharge characterization that reflects his service record, which is clearly, less than honorable".&lt;ref name = sldn /&gt;

In February 2011, the Navy concluded that charges against Toussaint were exaggerated and that Rocha's allegations were either unsubstantiated or embellished. Naval officers involved in investigating the Toussaint case called the original decision to censure Toussaint a "reverse Tailhook" reaction, a reflexive and hasty attempt to prove that the Navy had learned its lesson from the 1991 [[Tailhook scandal|Tailhook convention sexual harassment scandal]]. Toussaint is nevertheless still barred re-enlistment.&lt;ref name="military.com"/&gt;

Juan Garcia, assistant secretary of the Navy for manpower and reserve affairs, decided to allow Touissant to retire at his current rank of senior chief petty officer.  Said Garcia, "Toussaint's conduct as the Leading Chief Petty Officer assigned to the Military Working Dog Division, Naval Security Forces, Bahrain, did not meet the standards expected of senior enlisted leadership in our Navy. The Secretary of the Navy concurred with the CNO's decision that Toussaint not be permitted to re-enlist in the United States Navy. However, when looking at his career in its entirety, I have determined that his conduct did not rise to a level sufficient to warrant retirement in a paygrade less than E-8."&lt;ref&gt;McMichael, William H., "[http://www.navytimes.com/news/2011/02/navy-toussaint-retire-harrassment-bahrain-021711w/ Senior chief in hazing case to retire in grade]", ''[[Military Times]]'', 17 February 2011, retrieved 17 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dozier, Kimberly, "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/17/AR2011021706761.html Senior chief must retire despite flawed hazing probe]", ''[[Washington Post]]'', 18 February 2011, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
Senior Chief Petty Officer Michael Toussaint, was awarded the Silver Star for "great battlefield courage" during a special operations raid in Afghanistan.

Receiving the nation's third-highest military honor marks the bittersweet end to a 22-year career marred by a hazing scandal that erupted long after he'd left his position as kennel master at the Navy's base in Bahrain in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://pilotonline.com/news/military/nation/afghanistan/article_30159dfe-9d2f-5377-b23f-d1f9fea7a737.amp.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Don't ask, don't tell==
The hazing scandal received widespread media attention at a time when President Barack Obama faced increasing pressure from [[LGBT]] rights advocates and members of his own party to end the exclusionary "don't ask, don't tell" policy that prevented gay people from serving openly in the military. Obama promised to repeal DADT during his 2008 presidential campaign and reiterated that promise in a speech to LGBT lobbying organization the [[Human Rights Campaign]] delivered on October 10, 2009. LGBT advocates had been dissatisfied with what they perceive as a lack of action within the Obama administration on a series of LGBT issues, including DADT repeal, passage of the [[Employment Non-discrimination Act]] which would make discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation illegal, repeal of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA) which prevented the federal government from legally recognizing [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriages]] and the administration's defense of DOMA in a case before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

'''Marcus Vitruvius Pollio''' ({{IPAc-en|v|ɪ|ˈ|t|r|uː|v|i|ə|s|_|ˈ|p|ɒ|l|i|oʊ}}; c. 80–70 BC – after c. 15&amp;nbsp;BC), commonly known as '''Vitruvius''', was a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] author, architect, [[civil engineer]] and [[military engineering|military engineer]] during the 1st century BC, known for his multi-volume work entitled ''[[De architectura]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Vitruvius}}&lt;/ref&gt; His discussion of perfect proportion in architecture and the human body led to the famous [[Renaissance]] drawing by Leonardo da Vinci of ''[[Vitruvian Man]]''.

By his own description&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;De Arch. Book 1, preface. section 2&lt;/ref&gt; Vitruvius served as an  artilleryman, the third class of arms in the military offices. He probably served as a senior officer of artillery in charge of ''doctores ballistarum'' (artillery experts) and ''libratores'' who actually operated the machines.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yann Le Bohec]] "The Imperial Roman Army" Routledge, pg 49 2000 {{ISBN|0-415-22295-8}} [https://books.google.com/books]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Little is known about Vitruvius' life. Most inferences about him are extracted from his only surviving work ''[[De Architectura]]''. Even his first name ''Marcus'' and his [[cognomen]] ''[[Pollio]]'' are uncertain. {{ill|Marcus Cetius Faventinus|de}} writes of "Vitruvius Polio aliique auctores"; this can be read as "Vitruvius Polio, and others" or, less likely, as "Vitruvius, Polio, and others". An inscription in Verona, which names a ''[[Lucius Vitruvius Cordo]]'', and an inscription from [[Numidia|Thilbilis]] in North Africa, which names a ''Marcus Vitruvius Mamurra'' have been suggested as evidence that Vitruvius and [[Mamurra]] (who was a military ''praefectus fabrum'' under [[Julius Caesar]]) were from the same family;&lt;ref&gt;Pais, E. ''[https://archive.org/details/ricerchesullasto02paisuoft Ricerche sulla storia e sul diritto publico di Roma]'' (Rome, 1916).&lt;/ref&gt; or were even the same individual.&lt;ref&gt;History of ancient North Africa: CONFLICTS AND BATTLES OF THE HUMANITY, Ancient North Africa until the Roman conquest, last assessed 10/09/2011. http://miltiae.pagesperso-orange.fr/GB/Ancient_North_Africa.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvius Pollio http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Vitruvius.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Neither association, however, is borne out by ''De Architectura'' (which Vitruvius dedicated to [[Augustus]]), nor by the little that is known of Mamurra.

Vitruvius was a military engineer (''[[Roman military engineering|praefectus fabrum]]''), or a ''[[praefect]] architectus armamentarius'' of the ''[[apparitor]]'' status group (a branch of the Roman civil service). He is mentioned in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s table of contents for ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' (Natural History), in the heading for [[mosaic]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Moore, Richard E. M. |title= A Newly Observed Stratum in Roman Floor Mosaics |publisher= Archaeological Institute of America  |volume= 72 |issue= 1 |date = January 1968|pages= 57–68 |jstor= 501823 |journal= American Journal of Archaeology }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frontinus]] refers to "Vitruvius the architect" in his late 1st-century work ''[[De aquaeductu]]''.

Likely born a free Roman citizen, by his own account, Vitruvius served in the [[Roman army]] under Caesar with the otherwise poorly identified Marcus Aurelius, Publius Minidius, and Gnaeus Cornelius. These names vary depending on the edition of ''De architectura''. Publius Minidius is also written as Publius Numidicus and Publius Numidius, speculated as the same Publius Numisius inscribed on the [[Heraclea Lyncestis#Roman Theater|Roman Theatre at Heraclea]].&lt;ref&gt;Niccolò Marcello Venuti ''Description of the First Discoveries of the Ancient City of Heraclea, Found Near Portici A Country Palace Belonging to the King of the Two Sicilies'' published by R. Baldwin, translated by Wickes Skurray, 1750. p62 [https://archive.org/stream/adescriptionfir00venugoog/adescriptionfir00venugoog_djvu.txt]&lt;/ref&gt;

As an [[army engineer]] he specialized in the construction of ''[[ballista]]'' and ''[[Scorpio (dart-thrower)|scorpio]]'' [[artillery]] [[Roman siege engines|war machines]] for [[siege]]s. It is speculated that Vitruvius served with Caesar's chief engineer [[Lucius Cornelius Balbus (major)|Lucius Cornelius Balbus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Trumbull |first=David |title=Classical Sources, Greek and Roman Esthetics Reading: The Grand Tour Reader; Vitruvius Background: Life of Marcus Vitruvius Pollio (c. 90–20 BC) |work=An Epitome of Book III of Vitruvius |year=2007 |url=http://medieval.ucdavis.edu/GRAND.TOUR/Lecture02.html |accessdate=2009-11-18 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The locations where he served can be reconstructed from, for example, descriptions of the building methods of various "foreign tribes". Although he describes places throughout ''De Architectura'', he does not say he was present. His service likely included [[Africa Province|north Africa]], [[Hispania]], [[Gaul]] (including [[Gallia Aquitania|Aquitaine]]) and [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]].

To place the role of Vitruvius the military engineer in context, a description of "The Prefect of the camp" or army engineer is quoted here as given by [[Flavius Vegetius Renatus]] in ''The Military Institutions of the Romans'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Prefect of the camp, though inferior in rank to the [Prefect], had a post of no small importance. The position of the camp, the direction of the entrenchments, the inspection of the tents or huts of the soldiers and the baggage were comprehended in his province. His authority extended over the sick, and the physicians who had the care of them; and he regulated the expenses relative thereto. He had the charge of providing carriages, bathhouses and the proper tools for sawing and cutting wood, digging trenches, raising parapets, sinking wells and bringing water into the camp. He likewise had the care of furnishing the troops with wood and straw, as well as the rams, ''[[Onager (siege weapon)|onagri]],'' ''balistae'' and all the other engines of war under his direction. This post was always conferred on an officer of great skill, experience and long service, and who consequently was capable of instructing others in those branches of the profession in which he had distinguished himself.&lt;ref&gt;Flavius Vegetius Renatus ''The Military Institutions of the Romans'' Translated from the Latin by Lieutenant John Clarke, Text written in 390 BC.

Mainly known for his writings, Vitruvius was himself an architect. In Roman times architecture was a broader subject than at present including the modern fields of architecture, [[construction management]], [[construction engineering]], [[chemical engineering]], [[civil engineering]], [[materials engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[military engineering]] and [[urban planning]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~Vit/vitruvius.html The "Vitruvius Project" at Carnegie Mellon University, Computer Science Department] This software engineering project sees itself in the Vitruvian tradition.

In later years the emperor Augustus, through his sister [[Octavia Minor]], sponsored Vitruvius, entitling him with what may have been a pension to guarantee financial independence.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Whether ''De architectura'' was written by one author or is a compilation completed by subsequent librarians and copyists, remains an open question.

{{further|Mathematics and architecture}}

Vitruvius is the author of ''[[De architectura]]'', known today as ''The Ten Books on Architecture'',&lt;ref name="Vitruvius, Pollio 1960"&gt;Vitruvius, Pollio (transl. Morris Hicky Morgan, 1960), ''The Ten Books on Architecture''. Courier Dover Publications. {{ISBN|0-486-20645-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a treatise written in [[Latin]] on architecture, dedicated to the emperor Augustus. In the preface of Book I, Vitruvius dedicates his writings so as to give personal knowledge of the quality of buildings to the emperor. Likely Vitruvius is referring to [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa#Life in public service|Marcus Agrippa]]'s campaign of public repairs and improvements. This work is the only surviving major book on architecture from [[classical antiquity]]. According to Petri Liukkonen, this text "influenced deeply from the [[Early Renaissance]] onwards artists, thinkers, and architects, among them [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404–1472), [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519), and [[Michelangelo]] (1475–1564)."&lt;ref name="bandw"/&gt; The next major book on architecture, [[Leone Battista Alberti|Alberti's]] reformulation of ''Ten Books'', was not written until 1452.

Vitruvius is famous for asserting in his book ''De architectura'' that a structure must exhibit the three qualities of ''firmitatis, utilitatis, venustatis'' – that is, stability, utility, beauty. These are sometimes termed the '''Vitruvian virtues''' or the '''Vitruvian Triad'''. According to Vitruvius, architecture is an imitation of nature. As birds and bees built their nests, so humans constructed housing from natural materials, that gave them shelter against the elements. When perfecting this art of building, the Greeks invented the architectural orders: [[Doric order|Doric]], [[Ionic order|Ionic]] and [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]]. It gave them a sense of proportion, culminating in understanding the proportions of the greatest work of art: the human body. This led Vitruvius in defining his [[Vitruvian Man]], as drawn later by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]: the human body inscribed in the circle and the square (the fundamental geometric patterns of the cosmic order). In this book series, Vitruvius, also wrote about [[climate]] in relation to housing architecture and how to choose locations for cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/architecture|title=Philosophy of Architecture|year=2015|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20239/20239-h/20239-h.htm|title=Vitruvius The Ten Books On Architecture|work=The Project Gutenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scope===
Vitruvius is sometimes loosely referred to as the first architect, but it is more accurate to describe him as the first Roman architect to have written surviving records of his field. He himself cites older but less complete works. He was less an original thinker or creative intellect than a codifier of existing architectural practice. It should also be noted that Vitruvius had a much wider scope than modern architects. [[Roman architecture|Roman architects]] practised a wide variety of disciplines; in modern terms, they could be described as being engineers, architects, [[landscape architects]], surveyors, artists, and [[Artisan|craftsmen]] combined. Etymologically the word architect derives from Greek words meaning 'master' and 'builder'. The first of the ''Ten Books'' deals with many subjects which now come within the scope of [[landscape architecture]].

In Book I, Chapter 1, titled The Education of the Architect, Vitruvius instructs...

{{quote|1. Architecture is a science arising out of many other sciences, and adorned with much and varied learning; by the help of which a judgment is formed of those works which are the result of other arts. Practice and theory are its parents. Practice is the frequent and continued contemplation of the mode of executing any given work, or of the mere operation of the hands, for the conversion of the material in the best and readiest way. Theory is the result of that reasoning which demonstrates and explains that the material wrought has been so converted as to answer the end proposed.}}

{{quote|2. Wherefore the mere practical architect is not able to assign sufficient reasons for the forms he adopts; and the theoretic architect also fails, grasping the shadow instead of the substance. He who is theoretic as well as practical, is therefore doubly armed; able not only to prove the propriety of his design, but equally so to carry it into execution.&lt;ref name="penelope.uchicago.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/1*.html|title=LacusCurtius • Vitruvius on Architecture — Book I|website=penelope.uchicago.edu|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He goes on to say that the architect should be versed in drawing, geometry, optics (lighting), history, philosophy, music, theatre, medicine, and law.

In Book I, Chapter 3 (''The Departments of Architecture''), Vitruvius divides architecture into three branches, namely; building; the construction of [[sundial]]s and [[water clocks]];&lt;ref&gt;Turner, A. J., ''in'' Folkrets, M., and Lorch, R., (Editors), "Sic itur ad astra", ''Studien zur Geschichte der Mathematik und Naturwissenschaften - Festschrift für den Arabisten Paul Kunitzsch zum 70,'' Harrassowitz Verlag, 2000, p.563 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; and the design and use of machines in construction and warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Long, Pamela O., ''in'' Galison, Peter, and Thompson, Emily (Editors), ''The Architecture of Science'', The MIT Press, 1999, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borys, Ann Marie, ''Vincenzo Scamozzi and the Chorography of Early Modern Architecture'', Routledge, 2014, pp. 85, 179&lt;/ref&gt; He further divides building into public and private. Public building includes city planning, public security structures such as walls, gates and towers; the convenient placing of public facilities such as theatres, forums and markets, baths, roads and pavings; and the construction and position of shrines and temples for religious use.&lt;ref name="penelope.uchicago.edu"/&gt; Later books are devoted to the understanding, design and construction of each of these.

===Proportions of Man===
[[File:De Architectura030.jpg|thumb|left|"Vitruvian Man", illustration in the edition of ''De architectura'' by Vitruvius; illustrated edition by Cesare Cesariano (1521)]]
[[File:Da Vinci Vitruve Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Vitruvian Man]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], an illustration of the human body inscribed in the circle and the square derived from a passage about geometry and human proportions in Vitruvius' writings]]

In Book III, Chapter 1, Paragraph 3, Vitruvius writes about the proportions of man...
{{quote|3. Just so the parts of Temples should correspond with each other, and with the whole. The navel is naturally placed in the centre of the human body, and, if in a man lying with his face upward, and his hands and feet extended, from his navel as the centre, a circle be described, it will touch his fingers and toes. It is not alone by a circle, that the human body is thus circumscribed, as may be seen by placing it within a square. For measuring from the feet to the crown of the head, and then across the arms fully extended, we find the latter measure equal to the former; so that lines at right angles to each other, enclosing the figure, will form a square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/3*.html|title=LacusCurtius • Vitruvius on Architecture — Book III|website=penelope.uchicago.edu|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It was upon these writings that [[Leonardo da Vinci]] based his [[Vitruvian Man]].

Vitruvius described the human figure as being the principal source of proportion.

The drawing itself is often used as an implied symbol of the essential [[symmetry]] of the human body, and by extension, of the [[universe]] as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewholeuniversebook.com/2/page2.html |title=Bibliographic reference |publisher=The Whole Universe Book |date= |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lists of names given in Book VII Introduction===

In the introduction to book seven, Vitruvius goes to great lengths to present why he is qualified to write ''De Architectura''. This is the only location in the work where Vitruvius specifically addresses his personal breadth of knowledge. Similar to a modern reference section, the author's position as one who is knowledgeable and educated is established. The topics range across many fields of expertise reflecting that in Roman times as today construction is a diverse field. Vitruvius is clearly a well-read man.

In addition to providing his qualification, Vitruvius summarizes a recurring theme throughout the 10 books, a non-trivial and core contribution of his treatise beyond simply being a construction book. Vitruvius makes the point that the work of some of the most talented are unknown, while many of those of lesser talent but greater political position are famous.&lt;ref name="Vitruvius, Pollio 1960"/&gt; This theme runs through Vitruvius’s ten books repeatedly – echoing an implicit prediction that he and his works will also be forgotten.

Vitruvius illustrates this point by naming what he considers are the most talented individuals in history.&lt;ref name="Vitruvius, Pollio 1960"/&gt; Implicitly challenging the reader that they have never heard of some of these people, Vitruvius goes on and predicts that some of these individuals will be forgotten and their works [[lost works|lost]], while other, less deserving political characters of history will be forever remembered with pageantry.

&lt;!--Italicized names below, which show as red links as of July 29, 2015 (and perhaps others which were red links when this sentence was first written) do not have a Wikipedia page as of July 29, 2015 and, outside of inclusion on Vitruvius’s list under a categorization, nothing is known of them. Ironically, they may be unknown because the ancient [[Library of Alexandria]] was accidentally burned in 48 BC during a siege by Julius Caesar. Vitruvius does not mention the architecture of Egypt so was probably not involved in this siege.  Further, some of the non-italicized names which show as blue links as of July 29, 2015 have articles in Wikipedia that are Wikipedia "stubs" based on Vitruvius's list and short narratives.

Vitruvius' ''[[De architectura]]'' was rediscovered in 1414 by the Florentine humanist [[Poggio Bracciolini]] in the [[Abbey library of Saint Gall|library of Saint Gall Abbey]]. [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404–1472) publicised it in his seminal treatise on architecture, ''[[De re aedificatoria]]'' (c. 1450). The first known Latin printed edition was by Fra Giovanni Sulpitius in Rome, 1486.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palladiancenter.org/predecessors.html|title=CPSA Palladio's Literary Predecessors|website=www.palladiancenter.org|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofinformation.com/index.php?id=2840|title=Vitruvius, "De architectura", the First Printed Work on Classical Architecture (1486 – August 16, 1487) :  HistoryofInformation.com|website=www.historyofinformation.com|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Translations followed in Italian (Como, 1521), French (Jean Martin, 1547,&lt;ref&gt;[http://architectura.cesr.univ-tours.fr/Traite/Notice/ENSBA_LES1785.asp?param= Architectura – Les livres d'Architecture] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; English, German (Walter H. Ryff, 1543) and Spanish and several other languages. The original illustrations had been lost and the first illustrated edition was published in [[Venice]] in 1511 with [[woodcut]] illustrations, based on descriptions in the text, probably by [[Fra Giovanni Giocondo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://architectura.cesr.univ-tours.fr/Traite/Notice/CESR_2994.asp?param=|title=Architectura - Les livres d'Architecture|website=architectura.cesr.univ-tours.fr|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 16th-century [[Andrea Palladio]] provided illustrations for [[Daniele Barbaro]]'s commentary on Vitruvius, published in Italian and Latin versions. The most famous illustration is probably Da Vinci's ''[[Vitruvian Man]]''.

The surviving ruins of Roman antiquity, the [[Roman Forum]], temples, theatres, triumphal arches and their reliefs and statues offered visual examples of the descriptions in the Vitruvian text. Printed and illustrated editions of ''De Architectura'' inspired [[Renaissance]], [[Baroque]] and [[Neoclassical architecture]]. [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], for example, invented a new type of [[Hoist (device)|hoist]] to lift the large stones for the dome of the cathedral in [[Florence]] and was inspired by ''De Architectura'' as well as surviving Roman monuments such as the [[Pantheon (Rome)|Pantheon]] and the [[Baths of Diocletian]].

==Roman technology==
[[File:Archscrew2.jpg|thumb|200px|Drainage wheel from [[Rio Tinto (river)|Rio Tinto]] mines]]
Books VIII, IX and X form the basis of much of what we know about Roman technology, now augmented by archaeological studies of extant remains, such as the [[water mill]]s at [[Barbegal]] in France. The other major source of information is the ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' compiled by [[Pliny the Elder]] much later in c. 75 AD.

===Machines===
The work is important for its descriptions of the many different machines used for engineering structures such as [[Hoist (device)|hoists]], [[Crane (machine)|cranes]] and [[pulley]]s, as well as war machines such as [[catapult]]s, ''[[ballistae]],'' and [[siege engine]]s. As a practising engineer, Vitruvius must be speaking from personal experience rather than simply describing the works of others. He also describes the construction of [[sundials]] and [[water clocks]], and the use of an [[aeolipile]] (the first [[steam engine]]) as an experiment to demonstrate the nature of atmospheric air movements (wind).

===Aqueducts===
His description of [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]] construction includes the way they are surveyed, and the careful choice of materials needed, although [[Frontinus]] (a general who was appointed in the late 1st century AD to administer the many aqueducts of Rome), writing a century later, gives much more detail of the practical problems involved in their construction and maintenance. Surely Vitruvius' book would have been of great assistance in this. Vitruvius was writing in the 1st century BC when many of the finest [[Roman aqueducts]] were built, and survive to this day, such as those at [[Segovia]] and the [[Pont du Gard]]. The use of the [[inverted siphon]] is described in detail, together with the problems of high pressures developed in the pipe at the base of the siphon, a practical problem with which he seems to be acquainted.

===Materials===
He describes many different [[construction material]]s used for a wide variety of different structures, as well as such details as [[stucco]] painting. Concrete and [[Lime (material)|lime]] receive in-depth descriptions.

Vitruvius is cited as one of the earliest sources to connect lead mining and manufacture, its use in drinking water pipes, and its adverse effects on health. For this reason, he recommended the use of clay pipes and masonry channels in the provision of piped drinking-water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Hodge, Trevor, A. |title= Vitruvius, Lead Pipes and Lead Poisoning |publisher= Archaeological Institute of America |volume= 85 |issue= 4 |date = October 1981|pages= 486–491 |jstor= 504874 |journal= American Journal of Archaeology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vitruvius is the source for the anecdote that credits [[Archimedes]] with the discovery of the [[Archimedes' principle|mass-to-volume ratio]] while relaxing in his bath. Having been asked to investigate the suspected adulteration of the gold used to make a crown, Archimedes realised that the crown's volume could be measured exactly by its displacement of water, and ran into the street with the cry of'' [[Eureka (word)|Eureka!]]''

===Dewatering machines===
[[File:VitruviusTenBooksMHMorgan1914p295.gif|thumb|left|200px|Design for an Archimedean water-screw]]

He describes the construction of [[Archimedes' screw]] in Chapter X (without mentioning Archimedes by name). It was a device widely used for raising water to irrigate fields and drain mines. Other lifting machines he mentions include the endless chain of buckets and the [[reverse overshot water-wheel]]. Remains of the water wheels used for lifting water were discovered when old mines were re-opened at [[Rio Tinto (river)|Rio Tinto]] in Spain, [[Rosia Montana]] in Romania and [[Dolaucothi]] in west [[Wales]]. The Rio Tinto wheel is now shown in the [[British Museum]], and the Dolaucothi specimen in the [[National Museum of Wales]].

===Surveying instruments===
That he must have been well practised in surveying is shown by his descriptions of surveying instruments, especially the water level or ''[[chorobates]],'' which he compares favourably with the ''[[Groma surveying|groma]],'' a device using [[plumb line]]s. They were essential in all building operations, but especially in aqueduct construction, where a uniform gradient was important to the provision of a regular supply of water without damage to the walls of the channel. He also developed one of the first [[odometer]]s, consisting of a wheel of known circumference that dropped a pebble into a container on every rotation.

===Central heating===
[[File:Hypocaustum.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Ruins of the [[hypocaust]] under the floor of a Roman villa. The part under the [[exedra]] is covered.]]

He describes the many innovations made in building design to improve the living conditions of the inhabitants. Foremost among them is the development of the ''[[hypocaust]],'' a type of [[central heating]] where hot air developed by a fire was channelled under the floor and inside the walls of [[public bath]]s and [[villa]]s. He gives explicit instructions how to design such buildings so that [[fuel efficiency]] is maximised, so that for example, the ''[[caldarium]]'' is next to the ''[[tepidarium]]'' followed by the ''[[frigidarium]].'' He also advises on using a type of regulator to control the heat in the hot rooms, a [[bronze]] disc set into the roof under a circular aperture which could be raised or lowered by a [[pulley]] to adjust the ventilation. Although he does not suggest it himself, it is likely that his dewatering devices such as the [[reverse overshot water-wheel]] was used in the larger baths to lift water to header tanks at the top of the larger ''thermae'', such as the [[Baths of Diocletian]]. The one which was used in Bath of Caracalla for grinding flour.

YGLP (Young Global Leadership Program) is an international leadership program for [[university]] and [[high school]] students.

[[File:Merry olde england (6177158844).jpg|thumb|YGLP was launched in January 2016 at [[University of Oxford]].]]
It is founded and developed by Human Science Lab, [[London]], with support from several foundations and  transnational organisations. It uses outcomes from some of its core research on human [[cognition]], leadership and [[critical thinking]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.timeskuwait.com/Times_Two-Kuwait-cities-selected-to-host-YGLP-Asia-2017-18| title=Two Kuwait cities selected to host YGLP Asia 2017-18 |publisher=Kuwait Times | access-date=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

YGLP is run in five regional groupings – [[Asia]], [[Americas]], [[Europe]], [[Africa]] and the [[Oceania]]. The assignment of countries or territories to YGLP regional groupings is done in accordance with [[United Nations geoscheme]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://newsmantra.in/index.php/nse-2/564-yglp-application-opens-for-south-asian-students-from-april-10| title=YGLP application opens for South Asian students |publisher=News Mantra | access-date=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;



==Scientific Framework==
Various research programs on human [[cognition]], leadership, [[critical thinking]], physical spatiality and [[intelligence]] at Human Science Lab, London, provides the [[scientific]] framework for YGLP. 

YGLP is based on the Four Step Leadership Theory formulated at Human Science Lab. According to the theory  “the leadership achievement of an individual is proportional to the optimal use of four principal components that makes a leader – motivation, planning, energising and executing”. YGLP is designed to optimise this four key leadership component with each program module focusing on a single component. &lt;ref name="5African" &gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.dailypioneer.com/state-editions/bhubaneswar/global-laurel-for-kiit-intl-school.html| title=Global laurel for INT'L School |publisher=The Pioneer | access-date=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://humansciencelab.org.uk/outreach| title=YGLP Leadership Program |publisher=www.humansciencelab.org.uk | access-date=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==YGLP Fellow Program==
YGLP is executed through two fellow programs. The YGLP Senior fellow program is meant for [[university]] students in the age of 19 to 25 years and the Junior fellow program is for [[high school]] student in the age of 13 to 19 years. Eligible students for YGLP fellow program are selected through a [[leadership]] aptitude evaluation process. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://indiaeducationdiary.in/oxford-university-host-yglp-global-conference-2017/| title=Oxford University to host YGLP Global Conference 2017|publisher=Education Diary | access-date=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program Overview==
The YGLP fellow program is made of four core modules and one non-core module involving various instructional and resource materials, [[leadership]] workshops and leadership conferences. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.timeskuwait.com/upload/pdf/The_Times_12-18_Mar_2017.pdf| title=Two Kuwait cities selected to host YGLP Asia 2017-18 |publisher=Kuwait Times | access-date=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==YGLP Asia==

YGLP is run in 44 [[Asia]]n countries and 2 [[Special Administrative Region]]s as YGLP Asia. This is the list of countries where YGLP Asia is administered. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://myemail.constantcontact.com/Read--The-Times--latest-Issue----.html?soid=1116907563611&amp;aid=RvA4lJVjflc
