'''Agroforestry, Basic health, and Cooperative Nepal''' ('''ABC Nepal''') is a nonprofit, [[non governmental organisation]] working in [[Nepal]] that focuses on [[women's rights]] and [[human trafficking in Nepal]]. Created in 1987, ABC [[Nepal]] was one of the very first [[Non-governmental organisations in Nepal|Non Governmental Organisations]] established in [[Nepal]]. It was established before the multiparty democracy in [[Nepal]] in 1991 and officially registered then after. ABC Nepal is led by president [[Durga Ghimire]].

==History==
ABC Nepal was the first Nepalese organisation to raise the issue of human trafficking on a national level, and did so by organizing conferences about the [[Human trafficking in Nepal|trafficking of underage girls]] and [[Sexual slavery|sex slavery]] in Nepal in 1991.&lt;ref name="kobe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edu.kobe-u.ac.jp/gsics-kk-program/image/gsics/Barhir_IRE_Report.pdf |format=PDF |title=International Research Experience for Students and Young Researchers Program (IRE) |publisher=Edu.kobe-u.ac.jp |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="popcouncil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/horizons/trafficking1.pdf |title=Prevention of Trafficking and the Care and Support of Trafficked Persons |publisher=The Asia Foundation |location=Kathmandu, Nepal |year=2001 |accessdate=2013-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915161625/http://www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/horizons/trafficking1.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the leading&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.np/books/about/Understanding_Security_Practices_in_Sout.html?id=reEUckK1KUAC&amp;redir_esc=y |title=Understanding Security Practices in South Asia: Securitization Theory and ... - Monika Barthwal-Datta - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com.np |date=2012-05-04 |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; organisations working in this field. The combined effort of ABC Nepal along with other organisations has led to the creation and implementation of various laws regarding women rights and human trafficking.

ABC Nepal played a part in the rescue&lt;nowiki/&gt; of 35 girls from the Apollo circus in [[New Delhi]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="NHRC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nhrc.nic.in/Documents/ReportonTrafficking.pdf |title=A Report on Trafficking in Women and Children in India 2002–2003 |last1=Sen |first1=Sankar |last2=Nair |first2=P.M. |publisher=NHRC – UNIFEM – ISS Project |accessdate=2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001863/186394e.pdf |title=Inventory of Non-Formal Education Providers in Nepal |author=The Government of Nepal Ministry of Education Non-Formal Education Center |publisher=UNESCO |year=2009 |accessdate=2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also helped to rescue girls from [[brothels]] in [[India]] working as a [[sex slaves]] and later to rehabilitate them back into society.

They work to prevent trafficking in women and children by generating [[social awareness]] especially among rural people and conducting border monitoring and cross border programs.&lt;ref name="150.209.10.119" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childtrafficking.com/Docs/oxfam_2004_research_on_trafficking_gaps_analysis_nepal_2.pdf|title=Gaps Analysis on Intervention Strategies Against Trafficking in Women in Nepal|publisher=Childtrafficking.com|format=PDF|accessdate=2015-08-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923202745/http://www.childtrafficking.com/Docs/oxfam_2004_research_on_trafficking_gaps_analysis_nepal_2.pdf|archivedate=2015-09-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Focus area of work==
Girls from Nepal constitute the majority of [[Prostitutes|commercial sex workers]] in India. Most of them are minors and most are infected with [[HIV AIDS|HIV (AIDS)]]. They live in horrible conditions, such as red light zones where they are abused physically and sexually, bonded by the owner for years, tortured and imprisoned.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} On the other hands poor families living in rural parts of Nepal get easily attracted to the city, which offers good jobs and a better overall life. The illiterate girls are made to sell their body to re-earn the amount including the interest for which they were bought by the brothel and hence entrapped as bonded labour for years. Escape is virtually impossible under the direct surveillance, threat, and terror of owners. [[Corruption]] is prevalent in both the police and governments of India and Nepal, making both the trafficking easy and escape near impossible.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} The virgins, once worshiped as [[Kumari (children)|Goddess Kumari]], return home back with [[HIV]] and the stigma attached to it.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} This makes them unacceptable to society, making reintegration and repatriation difficult and sometimes impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1995/India.htm |title=India |publisher=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides sexual exploitation, girls have also been trafficked for various other reasons, including to have their kidneys sold, to be forced into marriage, or to work as domestic workers and cheap labourers in various parts of India.&lt;ref name="sancharika"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sancharika.org/files/ml_eng_feb02.pdf |format=PDF |title=Convention on Girl Trafficking |publisher=Sancharika.org |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the changing public perspective of migration, raising level of awareness among women, and the shift of trafficking pattern in Nepal,&lt;ref name="nhrc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhrcnepal.org/nhrc_new/doc/newsletter/National%20Report%20on%20Traffiking%20in%20Persons%20%20Especially%20%20on%20women%20and%20Children%20in%20Nepal%20-%202012.pdf |title=Trafficking in Persons Especially on Women and Children in Nepal |author=Office of the Special Rapporteur on Trafficking in Women and Children |year=2011 |publisher=National Human Rights Commission |location=Lalitpur, Nepal |accessdate=2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ABC Nepal has now been focusing on trafficking of girls beyond India, especially in [[Saudi Arabia]]. Lots of Nepali youth are moving to Arabian countries, [[Malaysia]], or elsewhere for newer and better employment opportunities, especially as housekeepers and factory workers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Many girls lured by dream of better world and job follow the path led by unauthorized dealers and traffickers and end up being sexually exploited and enslaved.&lt;ref name="nhrc" /&gt;

==Programs and activities==
ABC Nepal has provided income-generating training to rural women and victims of trafficking&lt;ref name="150.209.10.119"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fisher|first1=Alison|title=The Good, the Bad, and the Well-Intentioned: Governmental Responsibilities, Nongovernmental Efforts, and Human Trafficking in Nepal|url=https://www.hamilton.edu/documents/levitt-center/Fisher_article_2008.pdf|website=Hamilton University|accessdate=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help them alleviate their poverty and improve their living standard. They have formed more than 300 women cooperative groups.&lt;ref name="150.209.10.119"/&gt; ABC Nepal has also promoted self-reliance, self-confidence and leadership skill in women by [[economic empowerment]], [[vocational training]],&lt;ref name="150.209.10.119"/&gt; and  [[non formal education]]. The nonprofit focuses on reproductive health providing education to secondary school children's and operating health clinics and safe abortion campaigns. They have placed a special focus on [[HIV/AIDS]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iasociety.org/Abstracts/A200700756.aspx |accessdate=August 10, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008235949/http://www.iasociety.org/Abstracts/A200700756.aspx |archivedate=October 8, 2009 |title=ABC-Nepal interventions against girl-trafficking and HIV and AIDS in Morang district Eastern Nepal }}&lt;/ref&gt; prevention and awareness.&lt;ref name="150.209.10.119"/&gt; The group enhances leadership in women and increases the participation of affected women at the local, regional, and national level. They also provide legal protection and can represent the victims in legal processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://njanepal.org.np/index.php?option=com_rokdownloads&amp;view=file&amp;task=download&amp;id=52%3Ajudges-workshop-on-combating-trafficking-in-women-and-children&amp;Itemid=159 |format=PDF |title=JUDGES WORKSHOP ON COMBATING TRAFFICKING IN WOMEN AND CHILDREN |publisher=Njanepal.org.np |accessdate=2015-08-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204151225/http://njanepal.org.np/index.php?option=com_rokdownloads&amp;view=file&amp;task=download&amp;id=52%3Ajudges-workshop-on-combating-trafficking-in-women-and-children&amp;Itemid=159 |archive-date=2016-02-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ABC Nepal operates rehabilitation homes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.childtrafficking.com/Docs/sahara_jit_2004__best_pract.pdf |title=Best Practices on Rehabilitation and Reintegration of Trafficked Women and Girls |date=March 2004 |location=Kathmandu, Nepal |accessdate=2013-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124071744/http://www.childtrafficking.com/Docs/sahara_jit_2004__best_pract.pdf |archivedate=2013-01-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Kathmandu, [[Bhairahawa]], and [[Biratnagar]] to provide shelter to the victims of trafficking and [[violence against women]].

ABC Nepal is raising awareness for safe migration. For example, the group monitored the [[Tribhuwan International Airport]], establishing help desk in major border transit of Bhairahawa.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} The current rehabilitation and reintegration programs are producing positive results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vaw.sagepub.com/content/14/8/905.short |title=Sex Trafficking in Nepal |publisher=Vaw.sagepub.com |date=2008-08-01 |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2718">'''AIDS Drug Assistance Programs''' are a set of programs in all 50-states in the [[United States]] that provide [[Food and Drug Administration]]-approved [[HIV]] treatment drugs to low income patients in the U.S.

The programs are administered by each state with funds distributed by the United States government.

In June 2007 the program provided coverage for 102,000 or 30% of those infected with HIV in the United States.  Drug expenditures were $100.1 million in 2007 and $8.8 million in money spent on helping with insurance payments. This represented 344,600 prescriptions.&lt;ref name="kff.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kff.org/hivaids/upload/1584_09.pdf |title=AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAPs) - Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation Fact Sheet |access-date=2008-07-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029090632/http://www.kff.org/hivaids/upload/1584_09.pdf |archive-date=2008-10-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total program budget is $1.4 Billion with California receiving $288 Million, New York $241 Million, Texas $101 Million, and Florida $97 Million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statehealthfacts.org/comparemaptable.jsp?ind=544&amp;cat=11 Statehealtfacts.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The program first began in 1987 with appropriations to help pay for [[Zidovudine|AZT]].  The program was expanded in 1990 with the [[Ryan White]] Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act (commonly referred to as the [[Ryan White Care Act]].&lt;ref name="kff.org"/&gt; 

Most recipients are below 200% of the [[Federal Poverty Level]] (FPL) and 43 percent are below 100% the FPL.  63% are [[black]] or [[hispanic]]  and 77% are male.&lt;ref name="kff.org"/&gt;

In 2010, some states, citing budgetary reasons began cutbacks to the ADAP Formulary or instituted waiting lists for medication. A controversial dialogue began in states like [[Florida]] as to how these cutbacks would affect lower income persons with HIV and whether the lack of funds should be blamed on the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] or the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]]. &lt;ref&gt;Terrill, Jarrett: [http://www.southfloridagaynews.com/news/local-news/1680-health-officials-explain-adap-waiting-list.html "Health Officials Explain ADAP Waiting List"], ''SFGN - South Florida Gay News'', June 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10596">The legality of and public opinion toward '''abortion in Norway''' has changed dramatically in the last 100 years. Current [[Norway|Norwegian]] legislation and public health policy provides for [[abortion]] on demand in the first 12 weeks of gestation, by application up to the 18th week, and thereafter only under special circumstances until the fetus is viable, which is presumed at 21 weeks and 6 days.

==History==
In [[Christian V of Denmark|Christian V]]'s legislation of 1687, abortion was punishable by death. By law of 1842, it was no longer a capital offense, but could be punished by up to six years of imprisonment and hard labor. In 1902, new legislation allowed for abortion in cases where the mother's life was in danger or the child would be stillborn.

===Early activism===

An important milestone for the issue of abortion on demand came on January 15, 1915, when [[Katti Anker Møller]] gave a speech in [[Kristiania]] (now Oslo) calling for legalized abortion on demand. She said that "the basis for all freedom is the governance over one's own body and everything that is in it. The opposite is the condition of a slave." ("Grundlaget for al frihet er rådighet over egen krop og hvad i den er. Det motsatte er en slaves tilstand")

In the period between 1920 and 1929, about 100 individuals were sentenced for illegal abortion. In one of Oslo's largest hospitals, 82 women died as a result of illegal abortions, and 3791 women were treated for injuries sustained under these procedures.

In 1934, the ministry of Justice named a committee to start work on new legislation on abortion, headed by Katti Anker Møller's daughter [[Tove Mohr]]. The following year, a campaign opposing the committee's work gathered 207,000 signatures. The government tabled the committee's work.

The political debate continued on the issue, though [[World War II]] put other priorities in the public discourse. During the [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|German occupation]], the maternal hygiene offices pioneered by Katti Anker Møller were shut down and all their materials put to the fire.

When the maternal hygiene offices reopened in 1950, abortion counseling became one of their main services. An estimated 3,000 legal abortions and 7,000 - 10,000 illegal abortions were performed each year in the 1950s. In 1956, the prevalence of illegal abortions reached such levels that a council on penal law recommended stiffer penalties for illegal abortions.

In 1960, a new law allowed abortion by application approved by a commission of two physicians, and only on the basis of medical, eugenic, or criminal criteria; and with the consent of the husband if the applicant was married. This law went into effect in 1964.

The application was made by the woman's physician on her behalf, and she made her case alone before the commission. In 1964, 72% of the applications were approved. By 1974, 94% were approved, and the rate increased steadily through the 1970s. Still, practice varied considerably.

[[Image:Abortion time series Norway.PNG|thumb|left|300px|Induced abortions in Norway, 1979-2005]]

In 1969, the [[Norwegian Labour Party]] put abortion on demand on their platform, setting the stage for a mainstream debate on abortion within the broader framework of [[feminism]]. Proponents of abortion on demand improved their organizational strength, forming in 1974 [[Kvinneaksjonen for selvbestemt abort]] ("The Women's campaign for abortion on demand"). At the same time ''[[Folkeaksjonen mot selvbestemt abort]]'' (the Popular Movement Against Abortion on Demand) was formed and led by [[Anne Enger Lahnstein]], submitting 610,000 signatures for their cause. The debate intensified, with feminists on one side of the issue, mainstream Christians on the other, and the medical community split.

Abortion on demand was put to the vote in [[Stortinget]] but unexpectedly failed to pass by one vote when Socialist Left party representative [[Otto Hauglin]] voted against the bill. Although criteria for commission-approved abortions were somewhat relaxed, it became clear that abortion on demand would have to wait for the next session of parliament.

This period marked intensifying activism on both sides of the issue. The Christian newspaper [[Vårt Land (Norwegian newspaper)|Vårt Land]] became the platform for those opposed to the pending legislation, whereas the Socialist and feminist press advocated for it. The non-Socialist parties were unified in their opposition to abortion on demand, maintaining that the commission arrangement was appropriate.

===Abortion on demand===
[[Image:Abortion in Norway by age 1985 - 2005.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Abortion frequency, by age]]
In 1978, after much preparation and activism, by among others physicians [[Berthold Grünfeld]] and [[Axel Strøm]] of the [[Norwegian Labour Party]] and [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left Party]], respectively, passed with a one-vote majority the current law, which provides for abortion on demand in the first 12 weeks. Abortions after the end of the 12th week up to 18 weeks of  pregnancy may be granted, by application, under special circumstances, such as the mother’s health or her social situation; if the baby is in great danger of severe medical complications; or if the woman has become pregnant while under-age, or after sexual abuse. After the 18th week the reasons for terminating a pregnancy must be extremely weighty. An abortion will not be granted after viability.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/about-the-abortion-act/id419252/&lt;/ref&gt; Minor girls under 16 years of age need [[parental consent]], although in some circumstances this may be overridden.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/about-the-abortion-act/id419252/&lt;/ref&gt;
Soon after the laws was passed, bishop [[Per Lønning]] resigned from his office in the [[Church of Norway]] in protest against the new legislation.

==Current practices==
Although some argued that easier access to abortion would cause abortion rates to increase, the number of abortions has remained stable since the early 1970s, especially when adjusted for demographic changes related to fertility.

Between 1999 and 2003, 1740 applications for abortions between the [[Prenatal Development|12th and 16th week]] were considered by commissions in Norway. Of these, 1647, or 95.2% were approved.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ssb.no/vis/magasinet/slik_lever_vi/art-2005-02-18-01.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, midwives at Rikshospitalet alarmed authorities that some aborted fetuses had heartbeats for up to one hour before they died.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Svendsen (12 May 2012) [http://www.nrk.no/norge/aborterte-levde-i-over-en-time-1.8128542 Aborterte fostre levde i over en time før hjertet hadde sluttet å slå] NRK. Retrieved 3 January 2013 {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data from the [[Norwegian Institute of Public Health]] revealed that between 2001 and 2011 17 fetuses had been aborted at 22 or 23 weeks gestation. In September 2013, a committee appointed by the [[Ministry of Health and Care Services]] recommended that abortion should not be allowed after 21 weeks and 6 days gestation.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Svendsen (3 January 2013) [http://www.nrk.no/norge/absolutt-grense-for-abort-1.11445461 Endrer forskrift etter abortskandale] [[NRK]]. Retrieved 4 January 2013 {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 January 2015 the regulation on abortion was changed to say that a fetus is presumed viable at 21 weeks and 6 days, unless there is specific reasons to believe it is not.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lovdata.no/dokument/SF/forskrift/2001-06-15-635 Forskrift om svangerskapsavbrudd (abortforskriften)] § 18 ([https://web.archive.org/web/20160214192714/https://lovdata.no/dokument/SF/forskrift/2001-06-15-635 archive]) &lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2010}}, the abortion rate was 16.2 abortions per 1000 women aged 15–44 years.&lt;ref name="un2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = World Abortion Policies 2013 | publisher = United Nations | year = 2013 | url = https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/policy/world-abortion-policies-2013.shtml | accessdate = 3 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

And children are more likely to develop allergies if one or both parents have allergies.&lt;ref name = FDA1/&gt; Allergies differ between adults and children. Part of the reason for this that the respiratory system in children is smaller. The bronchi and bronchioles are narrower so even a slight decrease in diameter of these airways can have serious consequences. In addition, children often 'outgrow' their allergies.

The incidence of childhood allergies has increased in the past 50 years.&lt;ref name = oria2017&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK435937/ | title = Finding a Path to Safety in Food Allergy: Assessment of the Global Burden, Causes, Prevention, Management, and Public Policy|last1=Stallings|first1=Virginia A.|last2=Oria|first2=Maria P.|year=2017|doi=10.17226/23658| pmid = 28609025| isbn = 978-0-309-45031-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathophysiology==

A child's allergy is an immune system reaction. The child is reacting to a specific substance, or allergen. The immune system of a child responds to the invading allergen by releasing [[histamine]] and other chemicals that typically trigger symptoms in the nose, lungs, throat, sinuses, ears, eyes, skin, or stomach lining. In some children, allergies can also trigger symptoms of asthma—a disease that causes wheezing or difficulty breathing. If a child has allergies and asthma, controlling the allergies is important because the lack of treatment may make the allergies worse.&lt;ref name = FDA1/&gt; Compounds such as [[phthalates]]  are associated with asthma in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jaakkola |first1=J.J. |last2=Knight |first2=T.L. |title=The role of exposure to phthalates from polyvinyl chloride products in the development of asthma and allergies: a systematic review and meta-analysis|journal= Environ Health Perspect |volume=116 |issue=7 |pages=845–53 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18629304 |pmc=2453150 |doi=10.1289/ehp.10846 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20059582"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bornehag|first=CG|author2=Nanberg, E|title=Phthalate exposure and asthma in children|journal=International Journal of Andrology|date=April 2010|volume=33|issue=2|pages=333–45|pmid=20059582|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2605.2009.01023.x|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asthma in children is associated with exposure to indoor allergens.&lt;ref name="pmid21301330"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahluwalia|first=SK|author2=Matsui, EC|title=The indoor environment and its effects on childhood asthma|journal=Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology|date=April 2011|volume=11|issue=2|pages=137–43|pmid=21301330|doi=10.1097/ACI.0b013e3283445921|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; in early childhood may prevent the development of asthma, but exposure at an older age may provoke bronchoconstriction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rao|first=D|author2=Phipatanakul, W|title=Impact of environmental controls on childhood asthma|journal=Current Allergy and Asthma Reports|date=October 2011|volume=11|issue=5|pages=414–20|pmid=21710109|doi=10.1007/s11882-011-0206-7|pmc=3166452}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of [[antibiotic]]s in early life has been linked to the development of asthma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murk|first=W|author2=Risnes, KR|author3=Bracken, MB|title=Prenatal or early-life exposure to antibiotics and risk of childhood asthma: a systematic review|journal=Pediatrics|date=June 2011|volume=127|issue=6|pages=1125–38|pmid=21606151|doi=10.1542/peds.2010-2092}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure to indoor [[volatile organic compounds]] may be a trigger for asthma; [[formaldehyde]] exposure, for example, has a positive association.&lt;ref name="pmid20064771"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGwin|first=G|author2=Lienert, J |author3=Kennedy, JI|title=Formaldehyde exposure and asthma in children: a systematic review|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|date=March 2010|volume=118|issue=3|pages=313–7|pmid=20064771|doi=10.1289/ehp.0901143|pmc=2854756|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==

Testing is available to help identify any environmental or food allergies.&lt;ref name=aap.org/&gt; Caregivers and clinicians can assess the child for the development of an [[allergy]] by [[Health assessment|noting]] the presence of signs and symptoms and history of exposure.&lt;ref name=aap.org/&gt;

==Prevention==
[[File:Metered-Dose Inhaler (Child).png|thumb|Some older children can be taught to use their prescribed Metered-Dose Inhaler]]
[[File:Metered-Dose Inhaler Mask (Child).png|thumb|Metered-Dose Inhaler Mask (Child)]]
Avoiding allergens will help prevent symptoms. Allergies that a child has to the family pet can be controlled by removing the animal and finding it a new home. Exterminating cockroaches, mice and rats and a thorough cleaning can reduce symptoms of an allergy in children. [[Dust mites]] are attracted to moisture. They consume [[human skin]] that has come off and lodged in, furniture, rugs, mattresses, box springs, and pillows. The child's bedding can be covered with allergen-proof covers. Laundering of the child's clothing, bed linens and blankets will also reduce exposure.&lt;ref name=aap.org/&gt;

Exposure to allergens outside the home can be controlled with the use of air conditioners. Washing the hair, taking a bath or shower before bedtime can be done to remove allergens that have been picked up from outside the home. If grass or grass pollen is an allergen it is sometimes beneficial to remain indoors while grass is being cut or mowed. Children with allergies to grass can avoid playing in the grass to prevent allergic symptoms. Staying out of piled leaves in the fall can help. Pets returning into the home after being outdoors may track in allergens.&lt;ref name=aap.org/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Up to 5% of infants that are fed cow's milk-based formula will develop an allergy to cow's milk.{{sfn|Walker|page = 28}} Over half of cases in children in the United States occur in areas with air quality below EPA standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=American Lung|first1=Association|title=Urban air pollution and health inequities: a workshop report|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|date=June 2001|volume=109 Suppl 3|pages=357–74|pmid=11427385|doi=10.1289/ehp.01109s3357|pmc=1240553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The academy was founded in 1930 by 35 pediatricians to address pediatric healthcare standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www2.aap.org/pediatrichistorycenter/PHCHistory.htm| title=Pediatric History Center| publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics| accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has 64,000 members in [[primary care]] and sub-specialist areas.&lt;ref name="Membership"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-facts/Pages/AAP-Facts.aspx#Membership| title=AAP Facts: Membership| publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics| accessdate=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qualified pediatricians can become fellows (FAAP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www2.aap.org/visit/faap.htm|title=FAAP Certification|accessdate=2016-04-12|publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The academy runs [[continuing medical education]] (CME) programs for pediatricians and sub-specialists. The academy is divided into 14 departments and 26 divisions that assist with carrying out its mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/departments-and-divisions/Pages/Departments-and-Divisions.aspx| title=Departments &amp; Divisions| publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics| accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
It has the largest pediatric publishing program in the world, with more than 300 titles for consumers and over 500 titles for physicians and other health-care professionals. These publications include electronic products, professional references/textbooks, practice management publications, patient education materials and parenting books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=AAP Facts: Publications| url=http://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-facts/Pages/AAP-Facts.aspx#Publications| publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics| accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[AAP News (publication)|AAP News]]'' is the academy's official newsmagazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aapnews.aappublications.org/  |title=AAP News  |publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics |accessdate=2013-03-30  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727172535/http://aapnews.aappublications.org/  |archivedate=July 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]'' is its flagship journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nfaap.org/netforum/eweb/DynamicPage.aspx?site=nf.aap.org&amp;webcode=aapjou_results&amp;prd_code=PED| title=AAP Journals: Pediatrics - The Flagship Journal of the AAP| publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics| accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy positions==
The academy has published hundreds of policy statements ranging from advocacy issues to practice recommendations. The academy's policy website contains all current academy policies and clinical reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/Pages/Advocacy-and-Policy.aspx |title=Advocacy &amp; Policy |publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics |accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asthma===
In 2009, the national office and four of its State chapters provided training support to 49 pediatric practices to improve adherence to well-established asthma care guidelines. The percentage of patients at participating practices with well-controlled asthma (as defined by the [[National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute]]) rose from 58 to 72 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/national-academy-and-affiliated-state-chapters-support-pediatricians-improving-asthma-care |title=National Academy and Affiliated State Chapters Support Pediatricians in Improving Asthma Care, Leading to Better Guideline Adherence and Disease Control, Fewer Acute Episodes |date=2013-06-05 |accessdate=2013-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Car safety seats===
The AAP periodically issues guidance for child passenger safety, including policy recommendations for transitioning between rear-facing car seats, front-facing car seats, belt-positioning booster car seats, and vehicle safety belts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/Pages/AAP-Updates-Recommendations-on-Car-Seats-for-Children.aspx |title=AAP Updates Recommendations on Car Seats for Children |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=30 August 2018 |publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics |accessdate=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; These recommendations are typically published in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Pediatrics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Child Passenger Safety |journal=[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] |volume=127 |issue=4 |pages=788-793 |year=2011 |author=Committee on Injury, Violence, and Poison Prevention |doi=10.1542/peds.2011-0213 |access-date=2018-08-31 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/4/788}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Child Passenger Safety |journal=[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] |volume=142 |issue=4 |pages=e20182461 |year=2018 |author=Dennis R.

Previously, the AAP recommended that children remain rear-facing until they are 2 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Child Passenger Safety |journal=[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] |volume=127 |issue=4 |pages=788-793 |year=2011 |author=Committee on Injury, Violence, and Poison Prevention |doi=10.1542/peds.2011-0213 |access-date=2018-08-31 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/4/788}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to updated crash test, simulation, and field data, the AAP revised their guidance to exclude the age guideline entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/Pages/AAP-Updates-Recommendations-on-Car-Seats-for-Children.aspx |title=AAP Updates Recommendation on Car Seats for Children |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=30 August 2018 |publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics |accessdate=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current AAP Child Passenger Safety recommendations (as of August 30, 2018) state that children should remain in a rear-facing car seat for as long as possible, until they meet the maximum height or weight dictated by the car seat manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Child Passenger Safety |journal=[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] |volume=142 |issue=4 |pages=e20182461 |year=2018 |author=Dennis R. Durbin, MD |doi=10.1542/peds.2018-2461 |access-date=2018-08-31 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2018/08/28/peds.2018-2461.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full recommendations state that:

# Infants, toddlers and children should remain rear-facing as long as possible. Currently available car seats provide weight and height limits that allow children to be rear-facing beyond their second birthday.
# Once children are transitioned to forward-facing, they should use a car safety seat equipped with a 5-point harness for as long as the manufacturer recommends (i.e., until they reach the manufacturer's weight or height limit). Currently available convertible car seats and combination car seats support the use of a 5-point harness until a child is 65 pounds or more.
# Once children are transitioned to a belt-positioning booster car seat, they should continue to use the booster until the vehicle's lap and shoulder belt fit properly, which typically occurs when a child is over 4-feet 8-inches tall, and approximately 8-12 years of age.
# Once children are transitioned to the vehicle's lap and shoulder seat belt, they should always use the vehicle's seat belt to maximize protection in the event of an accident.
# Children under 13 years of age should be seated in the rear passenger seat (not the front seat) to maximize protection in the event of an accident.

===Elective infant circumcision===
In a 2012 position statement, the academy stated that a systematic evaluation of the medical literature shows that the "preventive health benefits of elective [[circumcision]] of male newborns outweigh the risks of the procedure" and that the health benefits "are sufficient to justify access to this procedure for families choosing it and to warrant third-party payment for circumcision of male newborns," but "are not great enough to recommend routine circumcision for all male newborns".  The academy takes the position that parents should make the final decision about circumcision, after appropriate information is gathered about the risks and benefits of the procedure.&lt;ref name=AAP2012&gt;{{cite journal |title=Circumcision Policy Statement |journal=[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] |date=2012-08-27 |volume=130 |issue=3 |pages=585–586 |doi=10.1542/peds.2012-1989 |pmid=22926180}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2012 statement is a shift in the academy's position from its 1999 statement in that the academy says the health benefits of the procedure outweigh the risks, and supports having the procedure covered by insurance.&lt;ref name=NYTimes_AAP2012&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/27/science/benefits-of-circumcision-outweigh-risks-pediatric-group-says.html |title=Benefits of Circumcision Are Said to Outweigh Risks |author=Rabin, Roni |date=2012-08-27 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimes_AAP2012&gt;{{cite news

After the release of the position statement, a debate appeared in the journal [[Pediatrics (journal)|''Pediatrics'']] and the ''[[Journal of Medical Ethics]]''. A group of 38 Northern European doctors, ethicists and lawyers co-authored a comment stating that they found the AAP's technical report and policy statement suffered from cultural bias, and reached recommendations and conclusions different from those of physicians in other parts of the world.&lt;ref name="peds"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2013/03/12/peds.2012-2896.abstract |title=Cultural Bias in the AAP’s 2012 Technical Report and Policy Statement on Male Circumcision |publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics |accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An opinion by two authors stated that, in their view, the AAP's analysis was inaccurate, improper and incomplete.&lt;ref name="medethics"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://jme.bmj.com/content/early/2013/03/18/medethics-2013-101346.abstract |title=Out of step: fatal flaws in the latest AAP policy report on neonatal circumcision |first1=J Steven |last1=Svoboda |first2=Robert S |last2=Van Howe |date=2013-03-18 |doi=10.1136/medethics-2013-101346 |journal=[[Journal of Medical Ethics]] |accessdate=2013-03-30 |volume=39 |pages=434–441 |pmid=23508208}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The AAP received further criticism from [[Circumcision controversies|activist groups that oppose circumcision]].&lt;ref name="cnn_2012"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/27/health/aap-circumcision-recommendation/ | title=AAP: Health benefits of circumcision outweigh the risks | publisher=CNN | date=2012-08-27 | accessdate=22 September 2014 | author=Emmons, Sasha}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time_2012"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://healthland.time.com/2012/08/27/circumcision-pediatricians-say-benefits-trump-risks/ | title=Circumcision: Pediatricians Say Benefits Trump Risks | publisher=Time | date=2012-08-27 | accessdate=22 September 2014 | author=Rochman, Bonnie}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The AAP responded to these criticisms in the ''[[Journal of Medical Ethics]]'', calling for respectful and evidence-based debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Female genital cutting===
In April 2010, the academy revised its policy statement on [[female genital cutting]], with one part of the new policy proving controversial. Although condemning female genital cutting overall, this statement suggested that current federal law banning the practice had the unintended consequence of driving families to perform the procedures in other countries, where these girls faced increased risk.  As a possible compromise, this policy statement suggested that physicians have the option to perform a ceremonial "nick" on girls as a last resort to prevent them from being sent overseas for full circumcision.  This particular position proved controversial to advocates for a full ban on female genital cutting under any circumstances&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/07/health/policy/07cuts.html |title=Group Backs Ritual ‘Nick’ as Female Circumcision Option |first=Pam |last=Belluck |date=2010-05-06 |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and concern from other medical groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

One month later, the academy retracted this policy statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.aap.org/advocacy/releases/fgc-may27-2010.htm |title=American Academy of Pediatrics withdraws policy statement on female genital cutting |date=2010-05-27 |publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics |accessdate=2013-03-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013012713/http://www2.aap.org/advocacy/releases/fgc-may27-2010.htm |archive-date=October 13, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/27/health/27brfs-DOCTORSREVER_BRF.html |title=Doctors Reverse Stand on Circumcision |first=Pam |last=Belluck |date=2010-05-26 |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gun violence prevention===
The American Academy of Pediatrics says that although U.S. firearms-related deaths have dropped since the 1990s, guns were responsible for over 80 percent of teen homicides in 2009 and were the most common [[suicide]] method among teens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pittman |first=Genevra |date=2012-10-18 |title=Pediatricians call for strict gun laws to protect kids |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/18/us-usa-health-firearms-idUSBRE89H1F420121018 |newspaper= |publisher= |agency=Reuters |accessdate=2013-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The AAP believes pediatricians should discuss guns and gun safety with parents before babies are born and at children's annual exams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rho |first=Helena |date=2013-02-01 |title=The Pediatricians vs. the NRA: How the gun lobby is trying to gag doctors from talking about kids and guns |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2013/02/pediatricians_and_nra_physician_gag_rules_and_the_cdc_aca_and_states.single.html |newspaper= |publisher=Slate |accessdate=2013-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also advocates for, among other things, more background checks, an assault weapons ban, and federal research on gun violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Viebeck |first= Elise |date=2013-04-29 |title=Pediatricians to push for gun control on Capitol Hill |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/healthwatch/public-global-health/296753-pediatricians-to-push-for-gun-control-on-capitol-hill |newspaper=The Hill |publisher= |accessdate=2013-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/federal-advocacy/Documents/AAPGunViolencePreventionPolicyRecommendations_Jan2013.pdf |title=American Academy of Pediatrics Gun Violence Policy Recommendations |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=January 2013 |website= |publisher= |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===School start times for adolescents===
Recognizing that insufficient sleep in adolescents is an important public health issue that significantly affects the health and safety, as well as academic success, the American Academy of Pediatrics strongly supports efforts of school districts to optimize sleep in students and urges high schools and middle schools to aim for start times no earlier than 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. to allow students the opportunity to achieve optimal levels of sleep (8.5–9.5 hours) and to improve physical and mental health, safety, academic performance, and quality of life. Although the AAP acknowledges that numerous factors may impair the amount and/or quality of sleep in adolescents - among them, biological changes in sleep associated with puberty, lifestyle choices, and academic demands - it considers school start times before 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. ("earlier school start times") to be a key modifiable contributor to insufficient sleep, together with [[circadian rhythm]] disruption. It also recognizes that a substantial body of research has demonstrated that [[Start School Later movement|delaying the start of the school day]] is an effective countermeasure to chronic sleep loss and has a wide range of potential benefits to the physical and mental health, safety, and academic achievement of students - including reduced obesity risk, rates of depression, and drowsy driving crashes as well as improved academic performance and quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=School Start Times for Adolescents |journal=Pediatrics |volume=134 |issue=3 |pages=642–9 |year=2014 |pmid=25156998 |doi=10.1542/peds.2014-1697 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marijuana===

The AAP opposes legalization of marijuana, citing potential harms to children and adolescents. The Academy also opposes medical marijuana "outside the regulatory process of the US Food and Drug Administration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Impact of Marijuana Policies on Youth: Clinical, Research, and Legal Update |journal=[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] |volume=135 |issue=3 |pages=584-7 |year=2015 |author=Committee on Substance Abuse, Committee on Adolescence |doi=10.1542/peds.2014-4146 |access-date=2018-04-25 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/135/3/584.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In states that have already legalized marijuana, the Academy recommends that pediatricians and regulators treat it as they would tobacco. The Academy does support "decriminalization" of marijuana -- reductions in the penalties for its use and possession -- in combination with an increased commitment to substance-abuse treatment. The Academy also recommends changing marijuana from a DEA Schedule 1 to a DEA Schedule 2 to facilitate research into pharmaceutical uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/pages/American-Academy-of-Pediatrics-Reaffirms-Opposition-to-Legalizing-Marijuana-for-Recreational-or-Medical-Use.aspx |title=American Academy of Pediatrics Reaffirms Opposition to Legalizing Marijuana for Recreational or Medical Use |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=26 January 2015 |publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics |accessdate=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule''' ('''ADOS''') is an instrument for diagnosing and assessing [[Autism spectrum|autism]]. The protocol consists of a series of structured and semi-structured tasks that involve social interaction between the examiner and the person under assessment. The examiner observes and identifies segments of the subject's behavior and assigns these to predetermined observational categories. Categorized observations are subsequently combined to produce quantitative scores for analysis. Research-determined cut-offs identify the potential diagnosis of [[autism|classic autistic disorder]] or related [[autism spectrum disorders]], allowing a standardized assessment of autistic symptoms. The [[Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised]] (ADI-R), a companion instrument, is a structured interview conducted with the parents of the referred individual and covers the subject's full developmental history.

== History ==

The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule was created by Catherine Lord, Ph.D., Michael Rutter, M.D., FRS, Pamela C. DiLavore, Ph.D., and Susan Risi, Ph.D. in 1989.&lt;ref name="Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule 2010"&gt;Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule." Western Psychological Services. Western Psychological Services. n.d. Web. 6 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It became commercially available in 2001 through WPS (Western Psychological Services).&lt;ref name="Akshoomoff, Natacha 2006"&gt;Akshoomoff, Natacha, Christina Corsello and Heather Schmidt. "The Role of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule in the Assessment of Autism Spectrum Disorders in School and Community Settings" The California School Psychologist 11 (2006): 7-19. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Method==

The ADOS consists of a series of structured and semi-structured tasks and generally takes from 30 to 60 minutes to administer. During this time the examiner provides a series of opportunities for the subject to show social and communication behaviors relevant to the diagnosis of autism.&lt;ref name="Akshoomoff, Natacha 2006"/&gt; 

Each subject is administered activities from just one of the four modules. The selection of an appropriate module is based on the developmental and language level of the referred individual. The only developmental level not served by the ADOS is that for adolescents and adults who are [[nonverbal autism|nonverbal]].&lt;ref name="Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule 2010"/&gt; The ADOS should not be used for formal diagnosis with individuals who are [[Blindness|blind]], [[Deafness|deaf]], or otherwise seriously impaired by sensory or motor disorders, such as [[cerebral palsy]] or [[muscular dystrophy]].

==Modules==

Module 1 is used with children who use little or no phrase speech. Subjects that do use phrase speech but do not speak fluently are administered Module 2. Since these modules both require the subject to move around the room, the ability to walk is generally taken as a minimum developmental requirement to use of the instrument as a whole. Module 3 is for younger subjects who are verbally fluent and Module 4 is used with adolescents and adults who are verbally fluent. Some examples of Modules 1 or 2 include response to name, social smile, and free or bubble play. Modules 3 or 4 can include reciprocal play and communication, exhibition of [[empathy]] or comments on others' emotions.&lt;ref name="Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule 2010"/&gt;

==Revision==

A revision, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS-2), was released by WPS in May 2012. It includes updated norms, improved algorithms for Modules 1 to 3 and a new Toddler Module that facilitates assessment in children ages 12 to 30 months.&lt;ref name="wpspublish.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpspublish.com/store/p/2648/autism-diagnostic-observation-schedule-second-edition-ados-2|title=(ADOS®-2) Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition  - WPS|website=www.wpspublish.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==
There are several organizations that offer training in the ADOS-2.

WPS offers an ADOS-2 Clinical Workshop for professionals unfamiliar with the ADOS-2. It provides attendees the opportunity to observe an instructor administering the ADOS-2 to a child with ASD. During the administration attendees practice scoring. The workshop focuses primarily on Modules 1 through 4, though attendees are given materials to study later in order to complete training in the Toddler Module.&lt;ref name="ADOS-2 Clinical Workshop"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpspublish.com/store/c/343|title=ADOS-2 Clinical Workshop|website=www.wpspublish.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The clinical workshop offered through WPS is a prerequisite to the more thorough research training offered by the ADOS-2 authors and their colleagues. Research training includes exercises to establish item coding accuracy to a specific criterion, and is designed to help individuals achieve the high cross-site interrater reliability that is required in published research. CADB also offers other training opportunities, such as one-day workshops focused solely on learning the Toddler Module (for researchers and clinicians who are already trained in Modules 1-4 of the ADOS or ADOS-2).&lt;ref name="ADOS-2 Clinical Workshop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Center for Autism and the Developing Brain"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cornellpsychiatry.org/education/autism.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-03-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603033242/http://www.cornellpsychiatry.org/education/autism.html |archive-date=2012-06-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The CAMPHOR questionnaire was developed by Galen Research in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKenna|first=S.P.|author2=Doughty, N.|author3= Meads, D.M.|author4= Doward, L.C.|author5= Pepke-Zaba, J.|title=The Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review (CAMPHOR): A measure of health-related quality of life and quality of life for patients with pulmonary hypertension|journal=Quality of Life Research|year=2006|volume=15|pages=103–115|doi=10.1007/s11136-005-3513-4|url=http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/909/art%253A10.1007%252Fs11136-005-3513-4.pdf?auth66=1380882215_541823d4f6f118218ba780db9d3a5f32&amp;ext=.pdf|accessdate=2 October 2013|pmid=16411035|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; to allow for cost-utility analyses for treatments of PH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meads|first=D.M.|author2=McKenna, S.P.|author3= Doughty, N.|author4= Das, C.|author5= Gin-Sing, W.|author6= Langley, J.|author7= Pepke-Zaba, J.|title=The responsiveness and validity of the CAMPHOR Utility Index.|journal=European Respiratory Journal|date=3 September 2008|volume=32|issue=6|pages=1513–1519|doi=10.1183/09031936.00069708|url=http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/32/6/1513.long|accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theoretical basis for the CAMPHOR is the needs-based model of quality of life, which states that quality of life is highest when an individual has the ability and capacity to satisfy their own needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Sonja M.|author2=McKenna, Stephen P.|title=The QLDS: A scale for the measurement of quality of life in depression|journal=Health Policy|date=October 1992|volume=22|issue=3|pages=307–319|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016885109290004U#|accessdate=2 October 2013|doi=10.1016/0168-8510(92)90004-U|pmid=10122730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==

The CAMPHOR is made up of 3 main dimensions which assess symptoms, functioning and quality of life (QoL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKenna|first=Stephen P.|author2=Ratcliffe, Julie|author3= Meads, David M|author4= Brazier, John E.|title=Development and validation of a preference based measure derived from the Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review (CAMPHOR) for use in cost utility analyses|journal=Health And Quality Of Life Outcomes|year=2008|volume=6|issue=65|pages=1–8|doi=10.1186/1477-7525-6-65|url=http://www.hqlo.com/content/6/1/65|accessdate=2 October 2013|pmid=18718016|pmc=2546377}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symptom dimension is made up of 25 symptoms and is broken up into 3 subscales: energy, breathlessness and mood.  The QoL scale has 25 items which focus on socialization, role, acceptance, self-esteem, independence, and security. The activity scale has 15 items. Response options include true and not true.  Scores for QoL and symptoms range from 0-25, with higher scores indicating worse quality of life. Activity scores range from 0-30, with higher scores indicating more physical limitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matura|first=Lee Ann|author2=McDonough, Annette|author3= Carroll, Diane L.|title=Health-Related Quality of Life and Psychological States in Patients With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension|journal=Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing|date=13 November 2012|pages=1–7|doi=10.1097/JCN.0b013e318275330d|url=http://journals.lww.com/jcnjournal/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=9000&amp;issue=00000&amp;article=99809&amp;type=abstract|accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language Adaptations and Validations ==

Since the development of the CAMPHOR, it has been translated and validated into fourteen different languages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Measures Database|url=http://www.galen-research.com/measures-database/|work=Galen-Research.com|publisher=Galen Research|accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; including  Australian and New Zealand English,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ganderton|first=Louise|author2=Jenkins, Sue|author3= McKenna, Stephen P.|author4= Gain, Kevin|author5= Fowler, Robin|author6= Twiss, James|author7= Gabbay, Eli|title=Validation of the Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review (CAMPHOR) for the Australian and New Zealand population|journal=Respirology|date=November 2011|volume=16|issue=8|pages=1235–1240|doi=10.1111/j.1440-1843.2011.02030.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1440-1843.2011.02030.x/abstract|accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; German&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cima|first=Katharina|author2=Twiss, James|author3= Speich, Rudolf,|author4=McKenna, Stephen P.|author5=Grunig, Ekkehard|author6= Kahler, Christian M.|author7= Ehlken, Nicola|author8= Treder, Ursula|author9= Crawford, Sigrid R.|author10= Huber, Lars C.|author11= Ulrich, Silvia|title=The German adaptation of the Cambridge pulmonary hypertension outcome review (CAMPHOR)|journal=Health and Quality of Life Outcomes|date=September 2012|volume=10|issue=110|pages=1–8|doi=10.1186/1477-7525-10-110|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186%2F1477-7525-10-110|accessdate=2 October 2013}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Swedish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Selimovic|first=Nedim|author2=Rundqvist, Bengt|author3= Kjork, Ewa|author4= Viriden, Johan|author5= Twiss, James|author6= McKenna, Stephen P.|title=Adaptation and validation of the Cambridge pulmonary hypertension outcome review for Sweden|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Public Health|date=December 2012|volume=40|issue=8|pages=777–783|doi=10.1177/1403494812464445|url=http://sjp.sagepub.com/content/40/8/777.long|accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in Clinical Trials ==

The Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review has been a useful tool in clinical trials as it allows researchers to assess whether new medication or therapy is effective. The CAMPHOR has been utilized in clinical trials which investigate the effects of [[treprostinil]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Channick|first=Richard N.|author2=Voswinckel, Robert|author3= Rubin, Lewis J.|title=Inhaled treprostinil: a therapeutic review|journal=Drug Design, Development and Therapy|date=24 January 2012|volume=6|pages=19–28|doi=10.2147/DDDT.S19281|pmc=3267519|pmid=22291467}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Hubert|author2=Rosenzweig, Erika B.|author3= Gotzkowsky, S Karl|author4= Arneson, Carl|author5= Nelsen, Andrew C.|author6= Bourge, Robert C.|title=Treatment satisfaction is associated with improved quality of life in patients treated with inhaled treprostinil for pulmonary arterial hypertension|journal=Health And Quality Of Life Outcomes|year=2013|volume=11|issue=31|pages=1–8|doi=10.1186/1477-7525-11-31|url=http://www.hqlo.com/content/11/1/31|accessdate=2 October 2013|pmid=23496856|pmc=3610124}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as trials which investigate [[sildenafil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tay|first=Edgar L.W.|author2=Papaphylactou, Maria|author3= Diller, Gerhard Paul|author4= Alonso-Gonzalez, Rafael|author5= Inuzuka, Ryo|author6= Giannakoulas, Georgios|author7= Harries, Carl|author8= Wort, Stephen John|author9= Swan, Lorna|author10= Dimopoulos, Konstantinos|author11= Gatzoulis, Michael A.|title=Quality of life and functional capacity can be improved in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome with oral sildenafil therapy|journal=International Journal of Cardiology|date=16 June 2011|volume=149|issue=3|pages=372–376|doi=10.1016/j.ijcard.2010.02.020|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167527310000872#|accessdate=2 October 2013|pmid=20304507}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suntharalingam|first=Jay|author2=Treacy, Carmen M.|author3= Doughty, Natalie J.|author4= Goldsmith, Kimberley|author5= Soon, Elaine|author6= Toshner, Mark R.|author7= Sheares, Karen K.|author8= Hughes, Rodney|author9= Morrell, Nicholas W.|author10= Pepke-Zaba, Joanna|title=Long-term Use of Sildenafil in Inoperable Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension|journal=Chest|year=2008|volume=134|issue=2|pages=229–236|doi=10.1378/chest.07-2681|url=http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/article.aspx?articleid=1085998|accessdate=2 October 2013|pmid=18263674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Captain Scarlet''' is the fictional main character in [[Gerry Anderson]]'s [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[Supermarionation]] science-fiction television series ''[[Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons]]'' and its computer-animated [[remake]], ''[[Gerry Anderson's New Captain Scarlet]]''.

==''Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons''==
[[File:NMM Captain Scarlet 2016.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Captain Scarlet puppet at the [[National Media Museum]]]]
Well-trusted by the [[commander-in-chief]] of Spectrum, [[Colonel White]], Captain Scarlet is the primary agent of the organisation and is assigned the most dangerous and crucial missions.
He is a close friend of [[Captain Blue (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Blue]], who is his "field partner" and thus with whom he undertakes the majority of his missions, although he is on friendly terms with all other Spectrum agents. A close relationship with [[Destiny Angel (Captain Scarlet)|Destiny Angel]] is also hinted at several times in the series.
===Death, Mysteronisation, and resurrection===
Captain Scarlet was killed in the first episode of the series, "[[The Mysterons (Captain Scarlet episode)|The Mysterons]]," in a [[car accident|car crash]] brought about by the [[Mysteron]]s, which also resulted in the death of fellow officer [[Captain Brown (Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons)|Captain Brown]]. Both men were reconstructed by the aliens, who assigned their exact likenesses of both men to assassinate the [[World government in science fiction|World President]]. The Captain Brown likeness was turned into a walking bomb for this purpose. When this attempt in New York failed, the Captain Scarlet likeness kidnapped the President from [[Cloudbase]] and flew him to England, taking him to the top of the [[London]] Car-Vu, a large [[Multi-storey car park|car park]] tower. Cornered while holding the President at [[Coercion#Physical|gunpoint]] over the city below, the Captain Scarlet likeness was shot by Captain Blue and fell 800 feet to his apparent destruction. However, at the end of the episode it was revealed that Captain Scarlet was returning to life and had become almost incapable of dying permanently due to the powers of the Mysterons, although the fall had broken the Mysteron programming and returned him to his original personality. This extraordinary ability heals Scarlet of physical injuries within hours, making him virtually indestructible.

Captain Scarlet's Mysteronised body, like those of all Mysteron likenesses, is still vulnerable to electricity and impervious to [[X-ray]]s. He also has a "sixth sense" when in the presence of a strong Mysteron influence – he becomes nauseated, sweats, and suffers a severe headache – but this sense sometimes does not indicate all Mysteron presences in an area. Though Captain Scarlet "dies" several times in the course of the series – usually quite violently – he always returns to life. In "[[Attack on Cloudbase]]," Captain Scarlet is declared finally and permanently dead during the course of the battle for Cloudbase; however, this is later revealed to be [[Symphony Angel|Symphony Angel's]] hallucination as she is stranded in a desert, waiting for Spectrum to rescue her following a plane crash.

===Personality===
Captain Scarlet, as the main protagonist, is one of the most developed characters in the series. His real name is Paul Metcalfe. He has black hair and blue eyes, speaks with a [[Mid-Atlantic English|Mid-Atlantic]] accent and is said to be from [[Winchester]] in [[Hampshire]], England. He was born on 17 December 2036. He is not unfamiliar with [[gambling]] and drinking, even though he has apparently lost his vulnerability to drunkenness; in the episode "[[Special Assignment (Captain Scarlet)|Special Assignment]]" plays, and loses heavily at, [[roulette]]. (This is under orders from Colonel White; Spectrum regulations prohibit gambling on grounds of its potentials both for inducing compulsions and for inflicting heavy debt that could lead to financial crimes.) In the episode "[[Flight 104]]," Captain Scarlet expresses a preference for steak "with all the trimmings."

Captain Scarlet is a competent [[Aviator|pilot]] and can drive almost any vehicle; but in this last, he is only moderately skilled, as he tends to crash [[Spectrum Pursuit Vehicle]]s (SPVs), the heavy-duty modified tanks that Spectrum employs (although this may be attributed to the fact that his indestructible nature 'permits' him to push the vehicles harder than others might as he knows he will survive whatever happens on the drive). He is also a qualified [[astronaut]]. He is a somewhat stereotypical hero in that he is dependable and always gets the job done although he is not always successful. He does, however, have a lighter side. He also has a rather dry wit and sarcastic sense of humour, often using this in dialogue with other Spectrum agents.

He can turn his hand to a variety of weapons from guns to electric cables. Captain Scarlet is not shown to have any love interests during the series although previous attractions are indicated at some points, and a popular speculation among the fan community of the series is that he has a soft spot for, if not a relationship with, compatriot [[Rhapsody Angel]].

Captain Scarlet has a close friendship with Captain Blue, who acts as Captain Scarlet's "field partner." Captain Blue cares about his friend and Captain Scarlet trusts him implicitly, although he is professional enough to use deadly force against him as necessary when Captain Scarlet was controlled by the Mysterons. In the episode "[[Special Assignment (Captain Scarlet)|Special Assignment]]," Captain Blue tries to stop Captain Scarlet's apparent spiral of self-destruction, showing the bond between them. (It was later revealed that this development was part of a plan to infiltrate a Mysteron attack, the plan being kept secret from Captain Blue so that his reaction to Captain Scarlet's dismissal would be natural.) In the episode "[[Renegade Rocket]]," both men are prepared to stay in a missile base targeted by the Mysterons and die in a last-ditch attempt to stop its destruction.

Captain Scarlet is also friends with [[Lieutenant Green]], as demonstrated when he accompanies Captain Scarlet and Captain Blue on certain missions. However, Captain Scarlet is friendly with all other Cloudbase personnel, and he has no particular enemies among those with whom he is closely associated.

==''Gerry Anderson's New Captain Scarlet''==

===Background===
Born in [[Winchester, England]], [[UK]], Scarlet's mother was Ann Brightman, a British [[astrophysicist]], while his father, Tom Metcalfe, was an American pilot who later joined the International Space Agency. As a boy of ten, Paul watched his father take humankind's first steps on [[Mars]] and vowed to follow in his historic footsteps. He studied astrophysics at [[MIT]] before joining the [[US Air Force]]. But the outbreak of global terrorist wars, which saw the deaths of both his parents, changed his focus.

He transferred to [[US Special Forces]] and commanded an elite unit that saw action across the world. His second-in-command was Lieutenant [[Conrad Lefkon]], who became his closest friend. With the end of the wars, a new security organisation was established: Spectrum. Paul was an obvious choice for the new organisation, and took on the codename "Captain Scarlet". His good friend Lefkon was also signed up as "[[Captain Black (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Black]]".

Scarlet later became Spectrum's special weapon in its "war of nerves" with the [[Mysteron]]s; a weapon created by the Mysterons themselves when they killed Scarlet during a mission on Mars along with Captain Black. After they had discovered the Mysterons' city, Black fired a destructive shot against it, believing they were under attack. The two men watched in astonishment as the city rebuilt itself, and tried to flee to escape their fate, only to be killed afterwards.

The Mysterons rebuilt Scarlet as an invincible human replica to infiltrate [[Earth]] and lead their war against the planet. While under the  control of the Mysterons, Scarlet tried to destroy Skybase, but was stopped in his efforts by [[Captain Blue (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Blue]]. Falling down through a plasma stream, Scarlet was killed, but recovered later on in Sickbay, under the astonished eyes of Doctor Gold and other onlookers, and revealed himself to be fully free of the Mysterons' control. Metcalfe's human psyche had survived and regained control of his physical body. Instead of being killed by the power surge, Scarlet was only harmed temporarily, and was restored to life by the genetic mutation of the Mysteron "retrometabolisation" process which makes him virtually "indestructible".

Scarlet is a dedicated Spectrum officer. First and foremost, he is a soldier on the frontline of Earth's defences. However, he is also tormented by what he has become  not fully human. Utterly fearless and dedicated to saving the human race, for all Scarlet's heroism there is one thing that makes him very uneasy – his growing feelings for [[Destiny Angel#Casting and characters|Destiny Angel]], the girlfriend of his late friend, Captain Black.

===Abilities===
Retrometabolism – so far, Captain Scarlet can survive, and heal from any injuries, even the more devastating ones, although the recovery is never instantaneous.

In a few episodes, it is stated that he can feel a Mysteron's presence, by feeling nauseated and unwell. In the pilot story ("Instrument of Destruction", Parts 1 and 2), it is also stated that Scarlet shared a kind of telepathic link with Captain Black – which is considered by [[Colonel White]] as an advantage in the war against the Mysterons that he cannot dismiss.

During the episode "Rat Trap", the Mysterons were able to contact Scarlet and to talk to him, while nobody else could hear them. It is not clear if this phenomenon was because he was on the Mysterons' home planet, or if he would hear them, wherever he might be, if they chose to contact him again.

In "Chiller", it was revealed that, when particularly badly wounded, Scarlet's body has the capability to separate his emotional and physical selves so that the latter can heal quicker, leaving the former as a ghostlike apparition, detectable only by its coldness.

==In music==
Captain Scarlet is referred to by [[The Kinks]] in the song "Daylight", on their album ''[[Preservation Act 1]]''.

==Adaptation==
In the [[BBC]] [[Past Doctor Adventures]] series – a series of novels based on ''[[Doctor Who]]'', featuring the first seven incarnations of the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]] in original adventures – the novel ''[[The Indestructible Man (novel)|The Indestructible Man]]'' by [[Simon Messingham]] draws heavily on Gerry Anderson's shows in general and ''Captain Scarlet'' in particular, with an organization known as 'PRISM' acting against the mysterious Myloki with the aid of Captain Grant Matthews, transformed into an indestructible state when he was killed and duplicated by the Myloki to such a degree that his original personality asserted itself. In keeping with the adult nature of this interpretation, Grant Matthews is presented as being tormented by his immortality, various sources noting that he is technically only a copy of Grant Matthews rather than being the original man in a new body, ideas that may have been suggested but never analysed regarding Captain Scarlet's nature in the original show.

==Reception==
The likeness of the original Captain Scarlet has variously been attributed to the actors [[Cary Grant]] and [[Roger Moore]]&lt;ref name="Likenesses"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Archer | first1 = Simon | title = Gerry Anderson's FAB Facts: Behind the Scenes of TV's Famous Adventures in the 21st Century | year = 2004 | origyear = 1993 | publisher = [[HarperCollins]] | location = London | isbn = 978-0-00-638247-8 | page = 86}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to the character's voice actor, [[Francis Matthews (actor)|Francis Matthews]].&lt;ref name="Likenesses"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wickes|first=Simon|title=FAQ – Voices and Likenesses|url=http://www.tvcentury21.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=117:captain-scarlets-voice-sounds-just-like-cary-grant-intentional&amp;catid=122:faqs&amp;Itemid=179|work=tvcentury21.com|date=2 January 2004|accessdate=1 October 2009|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5m00rQp77?url=http://www.tvcentury21.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=117:captain-scarlets-voice-sounds-just-like-cary-grant-intentional&amp;catid=122:faqs&amp;Itemid=179|archivedate=13 December 2009|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-27859814&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely acknowledged that the voice was an imitation by Matthews of the [[English-American]], [[Mid-Atlantic English|Mid-Atlantic]] inflections of Grant.&lt;ref name="O'Brien"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[Jeff Evans|Evans, Jeff]]|title=The Penguin TV Companion|year=2006|origyear=2003|edition=3rd|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|isbn=978-0-141024-24-0|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GuinnessBook"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Guinness Book of Classic British TV|author=[[Paul Cornell|Cornell, Paul]]; [[Martin Day|Day, Martin]]; [[Keith Topping|Topping, Keith]]|editor=Marshall, Anne|year=1996|origyear=1993|edition=2nd|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|location=[[Enfield Town|Enfield]], London|isbn=978-0-85112-628-9|page=331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Jim Sangster and Paul Condon, authors of ''Collins Telly Guide'' (2005), argue that Captain Scarlet's virtual indestructibility damages his credibility as a hero: "He'll survive no matter what they throw at him, which should mean that there's zero tension in anything he takes on."&lt;ref&gt;Sangster and Condon 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;166.&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel O'Brien offers a similar assessment, identifying the character's nearly-unkillable nature as a "possible miscalculation" on the part of the series creators. To support his argument, he makes reference to a line of dialogue spoken by the character of [[Lieutenant Green]] in the episode "[[Attack on Cloudbase]]," in which Lieutenant Green scoffs, "Anyone can be brave if they're indestructible."&lt;ref name="O'Brien"&gt;{{Cite book|title=SF:UK: How British Science Fiction Changed the World|author=O'Brien, Daniel|year=2000|publisher=Reynolds &amp; Hearn|location=London|isbn=978-1-903111-16-1|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science-fiction writer [[John Peel (writer)|John Peel]] considers Scarlet's power to be one of several major faults in the premise of ''Captain Scarlet.''&lt;ref name="Peel, 246"/&gt; He also suggests that the character, due to his fundamental near invulnerability, served as a poor [[role model]] to the "impressionable children" who made up the series' [[target audience]], explaining: "Parents didn't like their children watching a show that appeared to be encouraging them to hero-worship someone who was indestructible."&lt;ref name="Peel, 246"&gt;Peel 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;245.&lt;/ref&gt; Peel cites ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' as an example of a TV series aimed at younger viewers who "sometimes tried to copy their heroes, often with nasty or lethal results."&lt;ref name="Peel, 246"/&gt; He believes that the inducement to experiment with dangerous, imitable techniques is not lessened by the closing titles theme (with lyrics sung by pop group The Spectrum), which includes such lines as ''"They crash him, and his body may burn"'' and ''"They smash him, but they know he'll return&amp;nbsp;... to live again."''&lt;ref name="Peel, 246"/&gt; This led to the recording, by Colonel White's character-voice provider Donald Gray, of the disclaimer, "Captain Scarlet is indestructible. You are not. Remember this. Do not try to imitate him". This was played in the opening titles of several episodes{{Which|date=April 2015}} of the original series.

===Religious allegory===
Sangster and Condon explore the possibility of religious [[allegory]] embodied by the character, pointing out parallels between Captain Scarlet and [[Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;Sangster and Condon 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;164.&lt;/ref&gt; Actor [[Cy Grant]], who provided the voice of Lieutenant Green, made several observations concerning [[Christianity|Christian]] symbolism.&lt;ref name="Grant"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Grant|first=Cy|authorlink=Cy Grant|title=Lieutenant Green and De Anderson CODE – Spectrums, Subconscious Connections &amp; Synchronicities|url=http://nestene1.users.btopenworld.com/cygrant/green.html|year=2007|accessdate=16 January 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123195856/http://nestene1.users.btopenworld.com/cygrant/green.html|archivedate=23 January 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He interpreted the villainous [[Captain Black (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Black]], Captain Scarlet's arch-enemy, to be a representation of the [[Devil]]; meanwhile, Captain Scarlet, as Christ, is descended from [[God in Christianity|God]] in the form of [[Colonel White]], Spectrum's commander-in-chief.&lt;ref name="Grant"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2863">'''Child labour in Iraq''' has risen due to poverty, violence and force displacement. Based on a 2016 report by the [[United Nations Children’s Fund]] ([[UNICEF]]) more than half a million children are working due to decline of family incomes, violence and displacement. The report indicates that the number of children working at the time of the report had increased more than 575,000 since 1990. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20160711-unicef-child-labour-doubles-in-iraq-as-violence-and-displacement-hits-incomes/ UNICEF: Child labour doubles in Iraq as violence and displacement hits income]s&lt;/ref&gt;

==ISIS war==
Between 2014,when [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] took control of large areas in northern and western [[Iraq]], and 2016 almost 10 per cent of Iraqi children or more than 1.5 million have been forced to flee their homes because of violence. The report said. 
As a result 20 per cent of schools were shut down, and 3.5 million children were unable to go to school.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Displacement==
Another UNICEF report states that “As of mid-2016, 3.4 million Iraqis - almost 10% of the population - are now displaced, and millions more are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance. This massive [[Internal displacement|internal displacement]], as well as conflict-related economic decline, have put enormous strain on the host communities and strained social systems. Many parties to the conflict are engaged in gross human rights abuses and the number of grave violations against children has doubled over the past 12 months—girls who are captured face gender based violence and boys are recruited to fight or work on the front lines.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unicef.org/iraq/children.html The Situation of Children in Iraq]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Iraqi observatory for Human Rights (IOHR) has documented many cases of child labour, particularly displaced children. The report emphasis the displaced children were forced to work to fulfill the basic needs of their families, but at the same time the employers had exploited the children by paying them very little, and their urgent need for work.

==Iraq’s labour law==
Article 6, chapter 3 of Iraqi [[Labour law|Labour Law]], states that the minimum age for employment is 15 years old. According to 1989 [[Convention on the Rights of the Child|International Convention on the Rights of the Child]], everyone under the age of 18 is considered a child who must have special protection and care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rights-iq.org/%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B1/3324-displaced-children-in-iraq-face-child-labour-and-exploitation.html Displaced Children in Iraq face child labor and exploitation]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''College Health''' is a field of [[medicine]] that exclusively deals with the medical care of college age students (from age 18 through 28 years).  Many colleges and universities campuses offer some sort of student health service, but there is wide variability in the healthcare resources available from campus to campus, with models of student health ranging from [[first aid station]]s employing a single nurse to large multi-specialty clinics with hundreds of employees.  The vast majority of college health services are set up as service units rather than academic departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acha.org/ACHA/Resources/Topics/Health_Promotion.aspx|title=Health Education/Health Promotion|last=Inc.|first=Advanced Solutions International,|website=www.acha.org|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The educational aspect of college health is sometimes referred to [[Health Promotion in Higher Education]].

In 1988, it was estimated that there were approximately 27.3 college health staff per 10,000 students,&lt;ref name=Patrick_1988&gt;{{cite journal |last=Patrick |first=K |year=1988|title=Student health. Medical care within institutions of higher education |journal=JAMA |volume=260 |issue=22 |pages=3301–5 |pmid=3054192|doi=10.1001/jama.260.22.3301 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which if amortized to the 20.7 million students attending the more than 3,400 colleges and universities in the United States (in 2003) ),&lt;ref name=U.S._2003&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.census.gov/prod/2005pubs/p20-554.pdf |title=Current Population Survey, October 2003 |accessdate=2006-10-30|format=[[PDF]] |publisher= U.S. Census Bureau }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that there are approximately 56,500 college health professionals in the United States.  College health professionals include [[physicians]], [[physician assistants]], [[Administration (business)|administrators]], [[nurses]], [[nurse practitioners]], [[mental health professionals]], health educators, athletic trainers, dietitians and nutritionists, and [[pharmacists]].  Some college health services extend to include massage therapists and other holistic health professionals.
College health professionals are often members of a national body, such as the [[American College Health Association]].  Another national body among college health is the [[National Collegiate EMS Foundation]] (NCEMSF), which is dedicated to the promotion and support of [[emergency medical services]] on college and university campuses.

== Trends and Problems of Marijuana Use in College ==
[[File:Marijuana "after curing" ..jpg|thumb|Marijuana]]
[[Cannabis (drug)|Marijuana]] use is more prevalent among college students than the general population.  A 2015 study, for example, found the daily use of marijuana was more common than [[Cigarette|cigarettes]] among college students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kesling|first1=Ben|title=More College Students Use Marijuana Daily, Study Finds|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/more-college-students-use-marijuana-daily-study-finds-1441124840|accessdate=3 September 2015|work=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 39 % of college students reported using marijuana in the last year. Heavy marijuana use is linked to poor academic success and the non completion of college. Usage levels are on the rise due to the perception of risk and harm decreasing among the general population. Monitoring the Future is a research study at the University of Michigan that monitors substance abuse among college students. This research study has provided the conclusion that substance abuse is increasing among college students especially students in social organizations such as clubs and fraternities. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://record.umich.edu/articles/marijuana-use-among-college-students-highest-level-30-years|title=Marijuana use among college students at highest level in 30 years|work=The University Record|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Effects of Marijuana ====
Marijuana usage is reported to have the following short term negative effects: short term memory, [[anxiety]], [[paranoia]], panic, [[Hallucination|hallucinations]], slower reaction time, increased heart rate, sexual problems ( In males), increased risk of [[stroke]], and impaired coordination ( primarily in driving and sports). Long term effects of marijuana include: decline in [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]], poor school performance and higher chance of dropping out, impaired thinking and ability to learn and perform complex tasks, lower life satisfaction, [[addiction]], potential development of [[opiate]] abuse, relationship problems, antisocial behavior, financial difficulties, and greater chances of being unemployed. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.drugfreeworld.org/drugfacts/marijuana/short-and-long-term-effects.html|title=Short- &amp; Long-Term Effects of Marijuana - Negative Side Effects of Weed - Drug-Free World|website=Foundation for a Drug-Free World|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adderrall ==
{{Main|Adderall}}
[[File:Adderall.jpg|thumb|Adderall]]
Adderall is a stimulant drug used to treat [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] but are becoming more and more recreational to college students. Over 2.5 million Americans are prescribed Adderall , and roughly 50% of college students that were prescribed this drug have been asked by their peers if they can buy some. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.center4research.org/study-drug-abuse-college-students/|title=“Study Drug” Abuse by College Students: What You Need to Know {{!}} National Center for Health Research|date=2016-07-08|work=National Center for Health Research|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;This stimulant drug are being utilized by college students in order to increase studying focus. It is perceived by college students that the usage of these drugs is not a risk because the fact that it is prescribed to people but that is not the case.  Adderall is linked to aggression, restlessness, increased blood pressure and heart rate, paranoia, [[Psychosis|psychosis,]] [[Seizure|seizures]], [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]], and stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/prescription-stimulants|title=Prescription Stimulants|last=Abuse|first=National Institute on Drug|date=2018-06-06|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students within Fraternities and Sororities are the most susceptible to the usage of stimulant drugs such as these. College students have been disillusioned with the idea that using Adderall will increase cognitive function and improve studying and school performance . Adderall is known to only improve the cognitive processing in those who have conditions such as ADHD, for individuals with no cognitive condition, the drug should have no effect and taking this drug might even result in negative effects .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.consumerreports.org/drug-safety/skip-adderall-as-study-drug/|title=Why You Should Skip Adderall as a Study Drug|work=Consumer Reports|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alcohol ==
{{main|Alcohol use among college students}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
[[File:Finlandia vodka.jpg|thumb|Liquor]]
Alcohol or [[ethanol]] is a depressant used by people.  It is found in [[beer]], [[wine]], and
[[liquor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Abrams|first=David B.|title=Alcohol Consumption|date=2013|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4419-1005-9_626|work=Encyclopedia of Behavioral Medicine|pages=61–65|publisher=Springer New York|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-1005-9_626|isbn=9781441910042|access-date=2018-11-05|last2=Turner|first2=J.

Alcohol is made when microorganisms metabolize the carbohydrates when there is
no oxygen present.  This process is called [[fermentation]].  Beer, wine, and liquor contain
different amounts of alcohol and thus affect the drinker differently.  Liquor has the highest percentage of alcohol, while beer has the lowest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.drinkaware.co.uk/alcohol-facts/alcoholic-drinks-units/alcohols-ingredients-chemicals-and-manufacture/|title=Alcohol's ingredients, chemicals  and manufacture|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to The National Council on Alcoholism and Drug dependence, studies have also shown that drinking alcohol moderately can be helpful to the [[Coronary circulation|coronary]] system.  In general, for healthy people, one drink per day for women and no
more than two drinks per day for men would be considered the maximum amount of alcohol consumption to be considered moderate use. This shows that drinking can be beneficial in moderation.  Binge drinking and alcoholism, however, have proven to be harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/alcohol/art-20044551|title=Alcohol in moderation: How many drinks is that?|work=Mayo Clinic|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Effect of Drinking on education ====
Roughly 60 % of college students ages 18-22 drank alcohol within the last month, with 2 out of 3 of them engaging in binge drinking activities at that time. One in four college students report academics effects from drinking including lower grades, missed classes, and performing poorly on exams. [[Death]], [[Assault]], and [[Sexual assault]] also occur more often when alcohol is involved&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/CollegeFactSheet/Collegefactsheet.pdf|title=College Drinking|last=|first=|date=|website=National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Campuses have put drinking awareness programs in place in order to combat student drinking. These programs include but are not limited to education and awareness programs, cognitive behavioral skill based approaches, motivation and feedback related approaches, and behavioral interventions by health professionals.

Binge eating disorder is an eating disorder characterized by frequent and recurrent [[binge eating]] episodes with associated negative psychological and social problems, but without subsequent purging episodes (e.g. vomiting).&lt;ref name="Binge-eating Disorder 2016" /&gt; People who have this disorder can experience an uncontrollable urge to consume large amounts of food regardless of whether or not they are hungry and can feel like they have no control while they are eating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barker|first=Erin T.|last2=Williams|first2=Rebecca L.|last3=Galambos|first3=Nancy L.|date=2006-05-01|title=Daily Spillover to and from Binge Eating in First-Year University Females|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10640260600639079|journal=Eating Disorders|volume=14|issue=3|pages=229–242|doi=10.1080/10640260600639079|issn=1064-0266|pmid=16807216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====== Bulimia Nervosa ======
{{Main|Bulimia nervosa}}
Bulimia Nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by recurring episodes of binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors such as self induced vomiting in order to compensate for all the excess of food and calories eaten. Other compensatory methods include misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications to purge your body, and fasting and excessive exercise. People with this condition base their decisions mainly upon their body shape and weight. On average someone who is bulimic one goes through these recurring episodes at least once a week for three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/learn/by-eating-disorder/bulimia|title=Bulimia Nervosa|date=2017-02-26|work=National Eating Disorders Association|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Candy.jpg|100px|thumb|right|frame|Most college students prefer to snack on candy rather than having a decent meal.]]  --&gt;

The entrance of a new life means changing and adapting. Beginning freshmen enter a new phase that affects the way they eat. They are unaware of their nutrition and they only want something from what they see. High school is very different from what college is. Students transition from being in small classroom into big lecture rooms. The same goes for food, they transition from being served in cafeterias to buffet styles in college.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Beals, Katherine A. Human Kinetics. Illinois: Champaign, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Dining centers excite new students because this is a new experience, therefore they grab more than what they should. It’s something new and it’s what they’re paying for.

Around campus are many network of vending machines fill with varieties of junk food. When students don’t have the time to eat they rely on vending machines as a part of their meal.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Illinois: Champaign, 2004. Eating junk food lacks nutrition and proteins. Eventually those calories in the products will build up into fats.

Universities are not finding ways to reduce junk food around campus nor providing healthier meals in dining centers. Instead, university administrators give away specific amount of dining dollars to students who lives on campus.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Katy. “The Freshmen 15”. U.S. World News and World Report.135.4 (2003): 54&lt;/ref&gt; Although they would want to serve healthier food to their students, the price for them is just too expensive to spend.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Many experiments are being tested to see how much weight can gain in one year. So far studies have shown that women with high stress levels are more likely to gain weight than non-stressed women. Women with stress are more likely to consume alcohol and having the tendencies to go out more in order to eliminate their emotion. They also eat low in fiber and consume more caffeine. Nevertheless, non-stress women have more vegetable in their body and they are cautious enough to stay away from high cholesterol food.&lt;ref&gt;Adam, Troy, and Rini, Angela.” Predicting 1-year change in body mass index among college students.” Journal of American College Health. 55.6 (2007): 361-366&lt;/ref&gt;
Although students do gain weight in college, they can always burn it off by exercising and eating right. Overall meaning limiting how much they eat out and the junk food they pact into their body system. Students can prevent the ‘freshman 15’ if only they put effort and hard work for a healtheir body or image.

The '''cup-to-disc ratio''' (often notated '''CDR''') is a measurement used in [[ophthalmology]] and [[optometry]] to assess the progression of [[glaucoma]]. The [[optic disc]] is the anatomical location of the eye's "blind spot", the area where the optic nerve and blood vessels enter the retina. The optic disc can be flat or it can have a certain amount of normal [[Optic cup (anatomical)|cupping]]. But glaucoma, which is in most cases associated with an increase in [[intraocular pressure]], often produces additional pathological cupping of the optic disc. The pink rim of disc contains nerve fibers. The white cup is a pit with no nerve fibers. As glaucoma advances, the cup enlarges until it occupies most of the disc area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708075410/http://www.agingeye.net/glaucoma/glaucomainformation.php|url=http://www.agingeye.net/glaucoma/glaucomainformation.php|title=Glaucoma causes Optic Nerve Cupping (atrophy) and Vision Loss|author=|publisher=The Eye Digest. [[The University of Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary]]|archivedate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cup-to-disc ratio compares the diameter of the "[[Optic cup (ophthalmology)|cup]]" portion of the optic disc with the total diameter of the optic disc. A good analogy to better understand the cup-to-disc ratio is the ratio of a donut hole to a donut.  The hole represents the cup and the surrounding area the disc. If the cup fills 1/10 of the disc, the ratio will be 0.1.  If it fills 7/10 of the disc, the ratio is 0.7.  The normal cup-to-disc ratio is 0.3. A large cup-to-disc ratio may imply glaucoma or other pathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708073956/http://www.agingeye.net/glaucoma/glaucomaeyeexam.php|url=http://www.agingeye.net/glaucoma/glaucomaeyeexam.php|title=Eye Exam and tests for Glaucoma diagnosis|author=|publisher=The Eye Digest. The University of Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary|archivedate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, cupping by itself is not indicative of glaucoma. Rather, it is an increase in cupping as the patient ages that is an indicator for glaucoma. Deep but stable cupping can occur due to hereditary factors without glaucoma.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21319">'''Customized employment''' ('''CE''') is a way of personalizing the employment relationship between a candidate and an employer in order to meet the needs of both. It applies in particular to employees with [[disabilities]]. The individual employee's skills, interests and needs are identified in a process of "discovery", and job content and environment are tailored to these in a process of negotiation.

==Participation in community==
Customized employment aims to provide everyone with an [[equal opportunity]] to participate in community life. Community inclusion of individuals with disabilities requires support and advocacy from local businesses for concepts like customized employment. Molina, Leslie and Demchak, MaryAnn Demchak from ''Rural Special Education Quarterly'' says "If people with intellectual disability are to become truly self-determined, they must be allowed to express choice throughout their lives, including employment. Expectations for competitive employment tend to be low for this population, if considered at all" (Molina, Leslie, and MaryAnn Demchak. Rural Special Education Quarterly 35, no. 2: 24-32). Through the customized employment concept businesses can universally accept the practice that recognizes the power of community relationships with persons with disabilities who have been left out of the equation of community.

==Description== 
Katherine Inge from Virginia Commonwealth University Rehabilitation Research and Training Center says "The term, customized employment, is attributed to a speech that Secretary of Labor, Elaine Chao, made upon being conﬁrmed by the U.S. Senate in 2001. In that speech, Ms. Chao referred to customization as a trend in the labor market. Within 6 months of her speech, the Ofﬁce of Disability Employment Policy, a new ofﬁce within the U.S. Department of Labor, put forth in the Federal Register, a major initiative from the U.S. Department of Labor. They termed that initiative "customized employment" (Katherine Inge, Journal of Vocational Rehabilitation 28, no. 3: 133-134). The deﬁnition of customized employment that was published in the Federal Register is as follows: People with disabilities find customized employment to be successful way of gaining purposeful work with real wages. Todd Citron et al. says "A person with a disability who needs supports often begins with a negative label and stands at risk of rejection, segregation, isolation and limited adult opportunities. While in our culture the notion of freedom is strongly tied to personal power, control and inﬂuence, many individuals with disabilities have been historically denied access to the opportunities for choice and decision-making necessary to experience becoming successful in what they wish to do with their lives" (Citron et al., Journal Of Vocational Rehabilitation 28, no. 3: 169-179). Customized employment utilizes a process of ''discovery'' to uncover an individual's strengths, weaknesses, interests, task contributions, and conditions of employment to create meaningful work and a customized fit. Rather than looking at work opportunities driven by the market, customized employment practices create employment that fulfills both the applicant with disabilities and the employer's needs.

===Discovery===
Discovery is a key component of customized employment. this is a process of identifying individual's skills and interests through interviews, observations, and conversations. Karen L. Heath et al., from Center for Human Development says "The Discovery process is both open and formal; it is time-limited; and it is not concerned with predicting the future. Rather, it is focused on employment that matches who the individual is now: one potential match is [[self-employment]]. While self-employment is gaining credibility as a viable employment option for individuals with disabilities, self-employment is not for everyone" (Heath, Karen et al., Journal of Vocational Rehabilitation 39, no. 1: 23-27). Even though self-employment for individuals with disabilities is less common, it allows individuals to receive assistance in creating of independently owned small business that are typically under five employees. However, there has been some debate regarding CE and its relationship to supported employment. Katherine J. Inge from Virginia University says "Customized employment does not include group placements or sub-minimum wage positions that have unfortunately continued under supported employment services. However, since there are no formal regulations regarding customized employment implementation, the strategy faces the same pitfalls that have limited supported employment implementation. Hours worked, and wages earned will be issues as providers negotiate with employers to customize jobs for individuals with signiﬁcant disabilities" (Inge, Journal of Vocational Rehabilitation 24, no. 3 (June 2006): 191-193). There is talk amongst some authors that individuals with disabilities are being placed in jobs that are driven by the local labor market rather than negotiated positions based on individual's preferences and choice.

==Benefits==
Individuals, as well as companies, stand to benefit from customized employment. Customized employment concept provides the business with reliable and dependable employees, it reduces recruitment and hiring process, it matches job seekers with specific employment needs, increases employee retention, helps the business to attract broader customer base, enhance diversity, and increase tax benefits. Paulo dos Santos Rodrigues et al. from [[Brazilian Academy of Sciences]] say "One U.S. study reports that employers express a high level of satisfaction when they "customize" job tasks for speciﬁc individual job candidates. Employers who hired individuals with signiﬁcant disabilities through a customized employment process, when interviewed about their experience, identiﬁed distinct advantageous results such as increased sales revenue, improved operations, and higher customer satisfaction" (Dos Santos Rodrigues, Journal of Vocational Rehabilitation 38, no. 3: 185-194). Customized employment works in a way that it starts with the person and engages employers through based negotiation disclosing benefits that hiring a specific individual will have for both parties. Cary Griffin et al. from Griffin-Hammis Associates, LLC say "Most supermarkets include a Union butcher shop, a produce department, an Information Technology department, Clerical, shipping and receiving, and management departments. All these operations employ people, therefore bagging groceries should be only one possibly out of a hundred options explored through creative instruction, job carving, and interest-based job negotiations" (Griffin et al., Journal Of Vocational Rehabilitation 28, no. 3: 135-139). CE takes form in job carving, job sharing, and task reassignment which will be discussed below.

Tammy Jorgensen Smith et al. from Department of Rehabilitation and Mental Health Counseling, [[University of South Florida]] say "An example of a person who may benefit from discovery is an individual with autism. [[Autism spectrum disorder]] (ASD) is a range of complex [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]s, characterized by social impairments, communication difficulties, and restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior (NINDS, 2014). Persons with autism may be resistant to change and may not be comfortable in offices or other unfamiliar settings. Sensitivity to stimuli may further this discomfort. Additionally, many people who have autism have issues with communication and some have limited or no speech. These characteristics may contribute to difficulties with traditional employment strategies, but do not indicate that the person does not have talents that can be translated into a work setting. Discovery is able to uncover these talents" (Tammy Jorgensen Smith et al., Journal of Vocational Rehabilitation 42, no. 3: 201-208).

==Types==
Sometimes customized jobs do not exist in complete job descriptions, but are created through initiatives like job carving, job creation, the development of a business-within-a-business, resource ownership, or a self-employment opportunity. Job carving happens when individuals analyze duties performed in given jobs and identify specific tasks within those existing positions that individuals with disabilities can accomplish. Jobs carved for individuals may be formed either by editing one existing job or by mixing tasks from multiple jobs to create new positions. In whichever way the process is completed, job carving is a means of focusing on individuals' abilities, skills, and talents they bring to potential employers.

For example: Erick is looking to work in the fields of journalism and advertising. He is a great storywriter and a salesman. He uses one finger to type on a computer keyboard, and he types 20 words per minute. Journalists for a local newspaper are expected to write three stories per week, he would only be able to complete one story a week. The newspaper happens to also have an advertising sales need. Erick cannot communicate effectively on the telephone, but he shows talent in courting the business of advertisers through electronic mail. The local newspaper decides to hire Erick. They use his abilities as both a storywriter and a salesman. This happens by giving Erick the tasks of researching, developing, and composing one feature story a week and successfully soliciting advertisers.

Job creation happens when certain employers' needs are matched with the skills of job seekers. Developing new jobs can be through the process of job carving or by coming up with totally new job descriptions. In the latter case, individuals' unique assists are marketed to businesses. For example: Jane finds a local small business uses paper files to keep track of sales and inventory. The owner of the business has no employees and is solely running the daily operations of the establishment. Because their sales are increasing, keeping account of transactions and items on paper has proven extremely difficult. Through discussing her abilities and talents pertaining to computers and business management, Jane markets herself to the business owner. In turn, the owner decides to create a position for Jane. In this new position, Jane is responsible for developing, implementing, and maintaining a computerized system dedicated to recording sales and inventory.

Tim Riesen et al. from Department of Special Education and Rehabilitation say "Targett, Young, Revell, Williams, and Wehman (2007) described how youth in transition used One Stop Career Centers to support customized career development. The authors explained how students used the resources from centers to obtain employment. These resources included career club curricula, mentoring programs, and internships. In addition, they described how students had access to CE resource staff who provided individualized representation and negotiation with employers" (Riesen, Tim et al., Journal Of Vocational Rehabilitation 43, no. 3: 183-193). Individuals with disabilities realized early on that Customized Employment is real employment with real pay. CE encouraged students with disabilities to work and realize that employment is essential to successful adult transition. However, Christopher Rogers et al. from Institute on Community Integration, University of Minnesota say, "Current school-to-career transition practices are not leading to sufficient levels of competitive employment and post-secondary education outcomes for youth and young adults with significant disabilities despite progressive mandates and policy improvements in federal and state secondary and post-secondary education, vocational rehabilitation, and workforce development services" (Christopher Rogers et al., Journal Of Vocational Rehabilitation 28, no. 3: 191-207). When examined more closely, however, the studies showed that out of school youth had a similar rate of employment when compared to subgroup of students still attending high school. Pam Targett et al. say "James is a pleasant young man with a learning disability who attended special education and general education classes. During his freshman year, James learned about the local One Stop's summer youth program and was encouraged to participate by school personnel. Later that year, he enrolled in the summer work program. This program provides eligible youth with 3 weeks of employment training followed by 149 hours of paid work experience. Throughout his remaining years in high school. James attended workshops and training at the One Stop on various work-related topics and independent living issues. He also continued to participate in the summer youth program. One summer he was advised to participate in vocational courses at the local technical center to further develop his work skills. When James graduated from high school with a general diploma, he had employment experience from the summer youth programs, and certificates for completing courses in cabinetmaking. building maintenance, and occupational safety and health from the technical center. Now he was ready to pursue full-time work" (Christopher Rogers et al., Teaching Exceptional Children 40, no. 2: 6-11.)

==Implementation==
CE has proven to be a reliable employment option for individuals with disabilities; however, to implement customized employment solutions, service providers must expand capabilities that they may not have. Jennifer Harvey et al., from Deloitte Consulting, LLP says "CE consists of four process components: Discovery; Job Search Planning; Job Development and Negotiation; and Post-Employment Support. Typically, the employment specialist leads the individual and the CE support team through the ﬁrst component, Discovery, to determine the individual's interests, skills, and preferences related to potential employment. That information is used to develop a plan, determine a list of potential employers, and conduct an analysis of beneﬁts during the Job Search Planning component. Once a potential employer is identiﬁed, the individual and the employer, in the third component, negotiate 1) a customized job, 2) the provision of supports, and 3) the terms of employment that will meet the needs of the individual and the employer. In the case of self-employment, the individual and the agency providing CE services, construct a customized self-employment situation, such as a small business, negotiate the provision of supports to help make the business a success, and tailor the business operations to meet the need of the individual" (Harvey, Jennifer et al., Understanding the competencies needed to customize jobs: A competency model for customized employment." Journal of Vocational Rehabilitation 38, no. 2: 77-89.) Business that implement customized employment will be hiring individuals with skills outside of traditional employment and likely provide better service and broader opportunities to their clients. Michelle Ouimette, and Linda Rammler from ''Journal of Vocational Rehabilitation'' say "Successful opportunities and innovations include the "right kind" of social enterprise, entrepreneurship through self-employment and micro-enterprises and other entrepreneurial models" (Ouimette, Michelle, and Linda H. Rammler, Journal Of Vocational Rehabilitation 46, no. 3: 333-339). Leaders on all levels are treating employment as a priority since it has an impact in the long run on money and employment opportunities.

==Disclosure issues==
Disclosing one's disability may be a concern for people with disabilities and well as organizations who assist them when looking for a job. Katherine J. Inge and Pam Targett from Virginia Commonwealth University say "Access to an accommodation in the work place is often dependent on a person's disclosure of disability related needs. Individuals with visible or hidden disabilities, who know that they will need work-related accommodations including an individualized job description, should plan to disclose. If an accommodation is needed, the job seeker with his/her employment specialist must plan how and when to tell potential employers about the disability and be prepared to discuss support needs" (Inge Katherine and Pam Targett, Journal of Vocational Rehabilitation 28, no. 2: 129-132). Disclosure is also important because an individual with disability may need to leave work several times a week for medical appointments and if the employer is unaware of the employee's disability they may have a different attitude towards employee's performance.

An '''air diffuser''' or '''membrane diffuser''' is an [[aeration]] device typically in the shape of a disc, tube or plate, which is used to transfer air and with that oxygen into [[sewage]] or industrial [[wastewater]]. Oxygen is required by microorganisms/bacteria residents in the water to break down the pollutants. Diffusers use either rubber membranes or ceramic elements typically and produce either fine or coarse bubbles.

==Types==
Diffusers are generally referred to as either:

#[[fine bubble diffusers|Fine Bubble/Fine Pore]]
#[[coarse bubble diffusers|Coarse Bubble]]

Other diffused aeration devices include: [[jet aerators]], [[Aspirator (pump)|aspirators]], and U tubes.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, D.C.(2009). [http://water.epa.gov/scitech/wastetech/upload/2002_06_28_mtb_fine.pdf "Fine Bubble Aeration."] Wastewater Technology Fact Sheet. Document No. EPA-832-F-99-065.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design specifications==
{{primary sources|section|date=April 2013}}
Typical efficiency of a full floor coverage diffused aeration system in clean water is 2%/ft submergence or 6.6%/m submergence.  When converted to mass transfer into process or dirty water, it is typically closer to about half of those figures. Manufacturers of fine bubble systems have supported claims that the type, number and size of "pores" have a great effect on efficiency of a diffused aeration system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wastewater.com/pdf/142.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725095534/http://www.wastewater.com/pdf/142.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of diffused aeration systems==
Diffusers are typically connected to a piping system which is supplied with pressurized air by a blower. This system is commonly referred to as a '''diffused aeration system''' or '''aeration grid'''.

There are two main types of diffused aeration systems, retrievable and fixed grid, that are designed to serve different purposes.  In the case of a plant with a single tank, a retrievable system is desirable, in order to avoid stopping operation of the plant when maintenance is required on the aeration system. Fixed systems, on the other hand, are typically less costly, and often more efficient because it is easier to make full use of the floor.

Automated software is available on the web to assist with drafting of aeration systems in CAD, as well as calculation software to help determine diffuser requirements for a given wastewater.

==Developments in membrane coatings==
{{primary sources|section|date=April 2013}}
A developments in recent years has been surface coatings of [[PTFE]] on [[EPDM]] [[artificial membrane|membrane]]s.   This provides a buffer between the EPDM substrate and wastewater, hence reducing the likelihood of chemical attack and oxidation, and also providing better resistance to biological fouling and calcium scaling (manufacturers claim).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stamfordscientific.com/ptfemembranes.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110052647/http://www.stamfordscientific.com/ptfemembranes.html |archivedate=2010-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Doctor of Physiotherapy''' is an extended [[masters degree]] under the [[Australian Qualifications Framework]] Level 9 classification. The Doctor of Physiotherapy program at this time is only offered in [[Australia]]. The degree should not be confused with the American [[Doctor of Physical therapy]], which is a post baccalaureate degree.

The '''Drug Abuse Warning Network''' ('''DAWN''') was a public health surveillance system in the United States that monitored drug-related visits to hospital [[emergency department]]s and drug-related deaths.&lt;ref name="SAMHSA_DAWN"&gt;{{Citation |author=SAMHSA |authorlink=Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration |year=2016 |title=Emergency Department Data |url=http://www.samhsa.gov/data/emergency-department-data-dawn |accessdate=2016-09-08 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; DAWN was discontinued in 2011,&lt;ref name="SAMHSA_DAWN"/&gt; but its creator, the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA), continues to develop other sources of data on drug-related emergency visits.&lt;ref name="SAMHSA_DAWN"/&gt;

==Organization==
Hospitals participating in DAWN are non-federal, short-stay general hospitals that feature a 24-hour emergency department.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dea.gov/pubs/history/1970-1975.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201035407/http://www.dea.gov/pubs/history/1970-1975.html |date=December 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients are never interviewed. All data are collected through a retrospective review of patient medical records and decedent case files. DAWN collects detailed drug data, including illegal drugs of abuse, prescription and over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, and non-pharmaceutical inhalants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dawninfo.samhsa.gov/old_dawn/about/howdawn.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727012612/http://dawninfo.samhsa.gov/old_dawn/about/howdawn.asp |date=July 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the DAWN cases are defined broadly, DAWN captures many different types of drug-related cases.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dawninfo.samhsa.gov/tools/faqs.asp] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224172352/https://dawninfo.samhsa.gov/tools/faqs.asp |date=February 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The whole point of this organization is to find out how many people abuse most drugs.  They also seek short-stay hospitals, when a case is drug-related.

==History==
In 1974, DAWN was designed and developed by the scientific staff of the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]]'s Office of Science and Technology. It was jointly funded with the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dea.gov/pubs/history/1970-1975.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201035407/http://www.dea.gov/pubs/history/1970-1975.html |date=December 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DAWN then became a division of the [[United States Department of Justice]] before becoming part of NIDA in 1980.
On October 1, 1992, DAWN became part the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA), an agency of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/factsht/druguse/ |title=Office of National Drug Control Policy &amp;#124; The White House |publisher=Whitehousedrugpolicy.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAMHSA has contracted with [[Westat]], a private research corporation, to manage the New DAWN on the agency’s behalf.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dawninfo.samhsa.gov/about/whoweare.asp] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704063106/https://dawninfo.samhsa.gov/about/whoweare.asp |date=July 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Information collected by DAWN is widely cited by drug policy officials, who have sometimes confused drug-related episodes – [[emergency department]] visits induced by drugs – with drug mentions.  The [[Wisconsin]] Department of Justice claimed, "In Wisconsin, [[marijuana]] overdose visits in emergency rooms equal to [[heroin]] or [[morphine]], twice as common as Valium."  Common Sense for Drug Policy called this as a distortion, noting, "The federal DAWN report itself notes that reports of marijuana do not mean people are going to the hospital for a marijuana [[overdose]], it only means that people going to the hospital  mention marijuana as a drug they use".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drugwardistortions.org/distortion6.htm |title=Emergency Room Visits |publisher=Drugwardistortions.org |date=2009-07-15 |accessdate=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This criticism is also not correct.  DAWN has recently clarified their use of the term "drug mention" in methodology because of this erroneous claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dawninfo.samhsa.gov/collect/collect_qas.asp#2 |accessdate=February 22, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527141322/https://dawninfo.samhsa.gov/collect/collect_qas.asp |archivedate=May 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The data is collected by a systematic and confidential review of patients' medical records.  Thus, for example, a patient who broke an arm while high on marijuana would not be included in the data.  A report released by DAWN in 2002 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drugwatch.org/CEDARS/MarDeaths2002e.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523083917/http://www.drugwatch.org/CEDARS/MarDeaths2002e.pdf |date=May 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; claims that marijuana overdose alone resulted in documented deaths in Atlanta and Boston, respectively.  However, there is no known record or evidence to support the existence of a case of human fatality by result of marijuana overdose.

He held the position of Chair of the 1988 [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] Task Force on Circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/61692/both-sides-of-the-debate-two-jewish-doctors-offer-opinions-on-circumcision/|title=Both sides of the debate: Two Jewish doctors offer opinions on circumcision|first=Dan|last=Pine|publisher=Jewish news weekly of Northern California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Schoen held positions at [[Children's Hospital of the East Bay]] in Oakland, CA, and the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco, CA and was Board-certified in Pediatrics and Pediatric Endocrinology. He practiced Pediatrics and Pediatric Endocrinology in Oakland, CA for 46 years. Schoen was Chief of Pediatrics at Kaiser Permanente in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] for 24 years.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

==Circumcision==
Schoen maintained Medicirc.org, an online resource in which he discussed what he perceived as the benefits of [[circumcision]]. It went offline at the end of 2012. Interviewed in the ''Eastbay Express'' (2000), he stated, "Circumcision is one of the best health insurance policies you can give a son. A circumcised boy has a lifetime advantage over an uncircumcised one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.circumcisioninfo.com/slack_eastbayexpr.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050801082107/http://www.circumcisioninfo.com/slack_eastbayexpr.htm |archivedate=2005-08-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schoen has written about circumcision in the books ''Ed Schoen, MD on Circumcision'' ({{ISBN|1571431233}}) and ''Circumcision, Sex, God, and Science: Modern Health Benefits of an Ancient Ritual'' ({{ISBN|978-1-4392-1910-2}}) as well as poetry on the topic in the ''American Journal of Diseases in Children''.&lt;ref&gt;''American Journal of Diseases in Children'', Vol 141: 128. February 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''Boston Globe'' article, Schoen said, concerning the AAP's decision to not advocate circumcision, "It's highly biased". The 1989 report he oversaw stated that circumcision reduced the risks of urinary tract infections and sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8555643.html|title=Controversy over circumcision heightened in US after report|date=25 July 1999|publisher=Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fatal Vision''' [[goggles]] are a line of training tools for simulating the effects of [[Alcoholic Beverage|alcohol]] and [[psychoactive drug|drug]] intoxication without actually using these substances. Five of the models are intended to simulate five ranges of [[blood alcohol content]]: .06% or less, .07% to .10% or so, .12–.15% or so, .17–.20% or so, and .25% or so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fatalvision.com/fatal-vision-goggles.html Fatal Vision Impairment Goggles]&lt;/ref&gt; A sixth model is said to provide "extreme [[blurred vision|blurriness]] and [[double vision]]", and thereby simulate intoxication with drugs other than alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fatalvision.com/fatal-vision-blue-label.html Fatal Vision Blue Label Goggle]&lt;/ref&gt;

After shutting its doors in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalhealth.org/Home_Page.html&lt;/ref&gt; GHC re-opened with a newly elected board of directors on January 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.humanosphere.org/2013/02/the-sudden-death-and-rebirth-of-the-global-health-council/&lt;/ref&gt; In their new model, the Global Health Council works in three main areas: policy and advocacy, member engagement, and connections and coordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalhealth.org/what-we-do/|title=Global Health Council {{!}}   What We Do|website=globalhealth.org|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting this focus, GHC offers an online platform that includes guest blogs, member spotlights, policy briefs, advocacy updates, and global health job postings. Additionally, the GHC has since participated in significant global health events at the national and international level including the World Health Assembly, Global Health Week on the Hill, and the Consortium of Universities for Global Health Consortium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digimag.internationalinnovation.com//launch.aspx?eid=1cee8b62-2d6f-44de-8df5-23dacb356978&amp;pnum=28|title=International Innovation - Issue 127 digital edition|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council coordinates and participates in a number of working groups, coalitions, and roundtables in the global health advocacy community, including the GHC Budget Roundtable and Global Health Security Roundtable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalhealth.org/what-we-do/policy-advocacy/advocacy-community/|title=Global Health Council {{!}}   Global Health Advocacy Community|website=globalhealth.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council maintains a global health Advocacy Hub&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalhealth.org/what-we-do/policy-advocacy/advocacy-hub/|title=Global Health Council {{!}}   Advocacy Hub|website=globalhealth.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and coordinates the biennial publication of the Global Health Briefing Book.

==History==

Through almost five decades of work, the Global Health Council has continuously served as the leading membership organization focused on global health advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-health-council-taps-loyce-133000140.html|title=Global Health Council Taps Loyce Pace As New Executive Director – PR Newswire on Yahoo Finance|last=|first=|date=2016-10-20|website=www.csrwire.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In 1972, the ‘National Council for International Health’ was first established. In 1998, the organization became the Global Health Council to better represent its work in the 21st century. As the council evolved, its name had to evolve to correctly reflect the scope of the Council's work. The inclusion of global in its name reflected the Council's goal to include more international organizations and individuals in its membership and become the preeminent non-governmental source of information, practical experience, analysis and public advocacy for the most pressing global health issues.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/Pdaby237.pdf|title=EVALUATION OF THE GLOBAL HEALTH COUNCIL|last=Pielemeier|first=John|date=November 2002|website=USAID.gov|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

In 1998, the Council began organizing the Global Health Action Network in pursuit of its advocacy building goals.&lt;ref name="GHAC"&gt;[http://www.globalhealth.org/view_top.php3?id=16 Global Health Action Network]&lt;/ref&gt; The network was designed to establish groups of motivated citizens across the U.S. to educate local communities and their elected officials about the need for a more proactive approach to global health. With this network in place, the Council was able to implement nationwide advocacy campaigns dealing with vital global health issues. The Council continued to grow as the voice for global health by using its annual conference; its website to promote advocacy, education and information sharing; its media outreach through a diverse field of multi-disciplinary specialists;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0D91239F932A15755C0A9629C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2|title=U.S. Is Accused of Trying to Isolate U.N.

As part of the Council's work in advocacy and developing awareness of the [[AIDS]] crisis, the seventeen-year-old International AIDS Candlelight Memorial event came under their stewardship in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABY237.pdf Evaluation of the Global Health Council]&lt;/ref&gt; The International AIDS Candlelight Memorial grew to include 1,500 communities in more than 100 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080807130454/http://www.candlelightmemorial.org/images/pdf/al_special.pdf 25 Years of AIDS Candlelight Memorial Parallels History of AIDS Epidemic] "Global AIDSLink" www.globalhealth.org | November/December 2007 | #106.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the world's largest and oldest [[grassroots]] HIV/AIDS event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcsvg.com/news/article.php?index=3705 AIDS Candlelight Memorial] NBC Radio, 2008-12-23. {{Dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, the Global Health Council announced it would be closing its doors for the upcoming months. The Board of Directors released the announcement acknowledging that, “although the Global Health Council will no longer play the same role, we will continue to fight for the goals that first inspired us to action.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kff.org/news-summary/global-health-council-to-close-operations-this-year/|title=Global Health Council To Close Operations This Year|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With no unified voice for global health in the advocacy sphere, 40 international organizations came together at the end of 2012 to pledge almost $300,000 over three years to establish a new Global Health Council. The new Council included a newly elected Board of Directors and leaner business model.&lt;ref name="internationalinnovation.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.internationalinnovation.com/a-shared-voice-for-global-health/|title=Global Health Council - International Innovation|date=2014-07-02|newspaper=International Innovation|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2013, the Global Health Council reopened its doors to continue their mission bringing global health concerns to the forefront of policy work. The Council added Global Impact to serve as the organization Secretariat, in order to allow the Council to focus on advocacy through convening, communications, and coalition-building.&lt;ref name="internationalinnovation.com"/&gt; Dr. Christine Sow was selected as its new Executive Director, becoming the first woman to lead the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csrwire.com/press_releases/36322-Global-Health-Council-Taps-a-Passionate-Voice-for-the-Voiceless-as-Its-New-Executive-Director|title=Global Health Council Taps a "Passionate Voice for the Voiceless" as Its New Executive Director – Press Releases on CSRwire.com|website=www.csrwire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GHC has hundreds of individual and organizational members representing a number of sectors in the global health field. In 2014, GHC member organizations operated in more than 150 countries worldwide and had a combined annual revenue of over $40 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalhealth.org/about-us/member-directory/|title=Global Health Council {{!}}   Members|website=globalhealth.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Board of Directors is led by Dr. Jonathan Quick of Management Sciences for Health (MSH).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalhealth.org/about-us/board-of-directors-2/|title=Global Health Council {{!}}   Leadership|website=globalhealth.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Loyce Pace became President and Executive Director of the organization in December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msh.org/news-events/press-room/management-sciences-for-health-welcomes-appointment-of-loyce-pace-as-global|title=MANAGEMENT SCIENCES FOR HEALTH WELCOMES APPOINTMENT OF LOYCE PACE AS GLOBAL HEALTH COUNCIL’S NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
The Council has administered a number of prominent awards. Some of the recipients have been barred from traveling to receive them which has brought attention to their work.&lt;ref name="ACIAW"/&gt; In addition to the following honorific awards the organization has also conferred the "Best Practices in Global Health Award" and the "Excellence in Media Award for Global Health".

===Jonathan Mann Award for Health and Human Rights===
The Jonathan Mann Award for Health and Human Rights is named for former head of the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO)'s global [[AIDS]] program, [[Jonathan Mann (WHO official)|Jonathan Mann]], who resigned to protest the lack of response from the [[United Nations]] and WHO with regard to AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/aids/ "The age of AIDS"] [[PBS Frontline]] documentary.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the recipient was [[Gao Yaojie]], a retired Chinese gynecologist and one of China's foremost AIDS fighters who helped poor farmers in Henan Province that were infected with H.I.V. through selling their blood at for-profit and unsanitary collection stations.&lt;ref name="ACIAW"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9C0CE7DB113CF932A05756C0A9679C8B63 '' AIDS Crusader's International Award Wins Scowls in China''] by Elisabeth Rosenthal, New York Times, 31 May 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Yaojie was denied permission to attend an awards ceremony in Washington with Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] of the United Nations as her host.&lt;ref name="ACIAW"/&gt;

In 2008, the Mann award was to be given to [[Binayak Sen]], a prominent Indian doctor responsible for drawing up one of the most successful community-based health-care models in India — based on the traditional [[mitanin]], a health worker who advises the rural poor on preventive care — making health care available to many who had lacked access.&lt;ref name="NLUTWR"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/29/AR2008052903578.html ''Nobel Laureates Unable to Win Release of Doctor''] by Nora Boustany, Washington Post, 30 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He had been a vocal critic of the government's use of armed groups to push villagers out of mineral-rich forests to boost development and was jailed in April 2007 on sedition charges, including allegedly being linked to Maoist rebels and smuggling a letter for an accused Maoist prisoner he had visited.&lt;ref name="NLUTWR"/&gt; Sen denies the charges and his effort to get the award in person was bolstered by 22 [[Nobel laureate]]s; he is out of jail on bail.

===Gates Award===
Named for and funded by [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], the Microsoft Corp. founder and his wife, the Gates Award ($1 million) is administered by the Council.&lt;ref name="gagtb"/&gt; In 2004 the award went to Fazle Hasan Abed and his organization, [[Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee]] (BRAC), one of the "world's most successful development organizations, credited with improving the health and welfare of tens of millions of destitute people in Bangladesh".&lt;ref name="gagtb"/&gt; Past winners include the Rotary Foundation, which has raised millions for an ongoing global campaign to stamp out [[polio]].&lt;ref name="gagtb"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A11257-2004Jun2.html ''Gates Award Goes to Bangladeshi Aid Group: Rural Organization BRAC Is Credited With Improving the Lives of Millions''] by Justin Gillis, Washington Post — 3 June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The winner of the 2009 Gates Award was awarded to The [[London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine]].&lt;ref name="2009Gates"&gt;[http://www.gatesfoundation.org/press-releases/Pages/london-school-wins-global-health-gates-award.aspx "London School Wins Global Health Gates Award"] 18 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
From its inception through the 1990s, the Council was principally funded by grants (primarily from the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]] [USAID] and the [[Centers for Disease Control]] [CDC])."&lt;ref name="ABA HRM"&gt;[http://www.abanet.org/irr/hr/winter08/herowinter08.html Human Rights magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, [[Nils Daulaire]], formerly of USAID, became president of The Global Health Council and felt that the council should be an independent voice.&lt;ref name="ABA HRM"/&gt; The council diversified its funding as a matter of principle, even though at the time its policy agenda was consistent with that of the then administration.&lt;ref name="ABA HRM"/&gt; By 2003, only 20 percent of the council’s funding came from the U.S. government."&lt;ref name="ABA HRM"/&gt;

The Council has received grants of varying sizes from a variety of foundations, including the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|Gates]], [[David and Lucile Packard Foundation|Packard]], [[Hewlett Foundation|Hewlett MacArthur]], and [[Rockefeller Foundation|Rockefeller]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As part of the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]], US government support for AIDS prevention was contingent on [[Anti-prostitution pledge|opposing prostitution]] starting in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = [[Adam Liptak|Liptak, Adam]] |title = Justices Say U.S. Cannot Impose Antiprostitution Condition on AIDS Grants|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/21/us/court-finds-aids-programs-rules-violate-free-speech.html|accessdate = 25 June 2013|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|date = 20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council preferred to remain neutral so as not to alienate sex workers from their ant-HIV efforts so they sued in federal court with other non-profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mientka, Matthew |title=US Supreme Court Divides On Free Speech Rights Of Health Groups

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7716">'''Global Medical Device Nomenclature''' ('''GMDN''') is a system of internationally agreed generic descriptors used to identify all [[medical device]] products. This [[nomenclature]] is a naming system for products which include those used for the diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment or alleviation of disease or injury in humans.

The main purpose of the GMDN is to provide health authorities / regulators, health care providers, [[conformity assessment]] bodies and others with a single generic naming system.

Medical device experts from around the world (manufacturers, healthcare authorities and regulators) compiled the GMDN, based on the international standard [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 15225.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=50728|title=ISO 15225:2010 - Medical devices -- Quality management -- Medical device nomenclature data structure|website=www.iso.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was mandated by the European Commission in order to provide the necessary tool to carry out the implementation of the [[Medical Devices Directive]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/medical-devices/regulatory-framework/index_en.htm|title=Public Health - European Commission|website=Public Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the European databank for medical devices (Eudamed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/medical-devices/market-surveillance-vigilance/index_en.htm|title=Public Health - European Commission|website=Public Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the draft of the proposed Medical Device Regulation (from the European Commission)  it states “To facilitate the functioning of the European Databank on medical devices (Eudamed), a medical device nomenclature should be available free of charge to manufacturers and other natural or legal persons obliged to use that nomenclature under this Regulation. Furthermore this nomenclature should be provided, to the maximum possible extent free of charge, also to other stakeholders.”

The GMDN is the current nomenclature used by Members States in the National Competent Authority Reports as part of the current EUDAMED system to exchange information on device safety&lt;ref&gt;https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/medical-devices/market-surveillance_en&lt;/ref&gt;. The GMDN is not yet specified for the UDI database system proposed in new European Regulations&lt;ref&gt;https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/medical-devices/regulatory-framework_en#new_regulations&lt;/ref&gt; intended to be used by manufacturers of medical devices who have their own UDIs (unique device identifiers) and traceability. 

==Governance==
The GMDN meets the need to identify medical devices at the global level, as identified in the [[Global Harmonization Task Force]] (GHTF) that have since disbanded (2012) and replaced by the IMDRF&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdrf.org/about/about.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

GMDN is managed by the GMDN Agency, a [[non-profit organization]] and Registered Charity,&lt;ref&gt;[[Charitable organization#United Kingdom]]&lt;/ref&gt; which reports to its Board of Trustees, that represent medical device regulators and industry.

==Structure==
The GMDN term is in the form of a 5-digit numeric GMDN Code cross-referenced to a specific Term Name and Definition, with which all specific medical devices having substantially similar generic features, can be identified. The following is an example:

* GMDN Term Name - "Scalpel, single-use"
* GMDN Code - "47569"
* GMDN Definition - "A sterile, hand-held, manual surgical instrument constructed as a one-piece handle and scalpel blade (not an exchangeable component) used by the operator to manually cut or dissect tissue. The blade is typically made of high-grade stainless steel alloy or carbon steel and the handle is often made of plastic. This is a single-use device."

The GMDN term and other associated data is [[copyright]] protected and the GMDN is a [[Trademark]].

Uniquely each GMDN term has a set of attributes, known as Collective Terms, which help to navigate the GMDN Database and aid the selection of a GMDN term by medical condition or product feature.

The GMDN is used by regulators, healthcare providers and others for activities such as medical device recalls, adverse event reporting and postmarket surveillance and monitoring, as well as inventory control and other healthcare management functions.

The GMDN Agency updates the GMDN utilizing member change requests, to add a new generic device term or to change an existing Term Name or Definition. The decisions are made by an international expert team, according to ISO 15225. The GMDN Agency releases updates to the GMDN on a daily basis, on their interactive website, the GMDN Database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmdnagency.org/|title=GMDN Agency|website=www.gmdnagency.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only Members have access to the GMDN Database and membership is priced according to organization type and size. The GMDN is available in English and other languages.

==International use==
The GMDN is used in the European Databank on Medical Devices (Eudamed)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/medical-devices/market-surveillance-vigilance/eudamed/index_en.htm|title=Public Health - European Commission|website=Public Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been established by the European Commission to strengthen [[market surveillance]] and vigilance.

The GMDN has been identified as part of the 'minimum data set' for the proposed US FDA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/UniqueDeviceIdentification/default.htm|title=Unique Device Identification - UDI|first=Center for Devices and Radiological|last=Health|website=www.fda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Unique Device Identification]] regulation for the registration of new Medical Devices intended for use in the United States. This follows the international consensus&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdrf.org/docs/imdrf/final/technical/imdrf-tech-131209-udi-guidance-140901.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; established by the International Medical Device Regulatory Forum (IMDRF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdrf.org|title=International Medical Device Regulators Forum|website=www.imdrf.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GMDN Agency has recently finalised the business principles that will form the basis of a long term cooperation with the [[IHTSDO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihtsdo.org/|title=SNOMED International|website=www.ihtsdo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cooperation Agreement shall result in the use of the GMDN as the medical device component of [[SNOMED CT]]. This Agreement is consistent with the aims of both organisations to minimise duplication and to support harmonisation. The following objectives were agreed:

* A more comprehensive and harmonised clinical terminology
* Greater utility and access to both terminologies
* Opportunities to improve organisational efficiencies

The Agreement will benefit patients across the world and all users of [[SNOMED CT]] and the GMDN in promoting comprehensive terminology based medical records, covering the needs of regulators, the medical device industry and healthcare professionals. The arrangement will enhance the application of care to individual patients for medical device, patient risk and safety use cases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7060">{{about||tests performed on actual [[gold]]|Metallurgical assay|other uses|Gold standard (disambiguation)}}

In [[medicine]] and [[statistics]], '''gold standard test is''' usually [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic test]] or [[statistical test|benchmark]] that is the best available '''under reasonable conditions'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Versi|first=E|title="Gold standard" is an appropriate term.|journal=BMJ|date=July 1992|pmid=1515860|pmc=1883235|volume=305|issue=6846|pages=187|doi=10.1136/bmj.305.6846.187-b}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other times, gold standard is the most accurate test possible '''without restrictions'''.

Both meanings are different because for example, in medicine, dealing with conditions that would require an [[autopsy]] to have a perfect diagnosis, the gold standard test would be the best one that keeps the patient alive instead of the autopsy.

==In medicine==

"Gold standard" can refer to the criteria by which scientific evidence is evaluated. For example, in [[resuscitation]] research, the "gold standard" test of a medication or procedure is whether or not it leads to an increase in the number of neurologically intact survivors that walk out of the hospital.&lt;ref name=ACLS_2003_Outcomes&gt;''ACLS: Principles and Practice''. p. 62. Dallas: American Heart Association, 2003. {{ISBN|0-87493-341-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other types of medical research might regard a significant decrease in 30-day mortality as the gold standard.

The AMA Style Guide prefers the phrase ''Criterion Standard'' instead of "gold standard", and many medical journals now mandate this usage in their instructions for contributors.  For instance, ''Archives of biological Medicine and Rehabilitation'' specifies this usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.editors/623354/authorinstructions | title = ARCHIVES OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION: Guide for Authors | work = [[Elsevier]] |date=February 2007 | accessdate = 2007-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the criterion is a whole clinical testing procedure it is usually referred to as [[case definition|clinical case definition]].

A hypothetical ideal "gold standard" test has a [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] of 100% with respect to the presence of the disease (it identifies all individuals with a well defined disease process; it does not have any false-negative results) and a [[specificity (tests)|specificity]] of 100% (it does not falsely identify someone with a condition that does not have the condition; it does not have any false-positive results).  In practice, there are sometimes no true "gold standard" tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=LM Troy, KB Michels, DJ Hunter, D Spiegelman|title=Self-reported birthweight and history of having been breastfed among younger women: an assessment of validity|year=1996|journal=Int J Epidemiol|publisher=IEA|url=http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/1/122.full.pdf|pmid=8666479|doi=10.1093/ije/25.1.122|volume=25|issue=1|pages=122–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As new diagnostic methods become available, the "gold standard" test may change over time.  For instance, for the diagnosis of [[aortic dissection]], the "gold standard" test used to be the [[aortogram]], which had a sensitivity as low as 83% and a specificity as low as 87%.  Since the advancements of [[magnetic resonance imaging]], the [[magnetic resonance angiogram]] (MRA) has become the new "gold standard" test for aortic dissection, with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 92%.  Before widespread acceptance of any new test, the former test retains its status as the "gold standard".

==Test calibration==

Because tests can be incorrect (yielding a [[Type I and type II errors|false-negative or a false-positive]]), results should be interpreted in the context of the history, physical findings, and other test results in the individual being tested. It is within this context that the sensitivity and specificity of the "gold standard" test is determined.

When the gold standard is not a perfect one, its [[sensitivity and specificity]] must be [[calibrated]] against more accurate tests or against the definition of the condition.&lt;ref name=Alloy/&gt; This calibration is especially important when a perfect test is available only by autopsy.
It is important to emphasize that a test has to meet some interobserver agreement, to avoid some bias induced by the study itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Complications and Validity of Pulmonary Angiography in Acute Pulmonary Embolism Circulation|year=1992|volume=85|issue=2|pages=462–468|pmid=1735144|doi=10.1161/01.CIR.85.2.462|url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/85/2/462.long|journal=Circulation|vauthors=Stein PD, Athanasoulis C, Alavi A, Greenspan RH, Hales CA, Saltzman HA, Vreim CE, Terrin ML, Weg JG }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calibration errors can lead to [[Medical error|misdiagnosis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rti.org/pubs/Calibration_Error.pdf The Impact of Calibration Error in Medical Decision Making]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ambiguity==

Sometimes "gold standard test" refers to the best performing test available. In these cases, there is no other criterion against which it can be compared and it is equivalent to a definition. When referring to this meaning, gold standard tests are normally not performed at all. This is because the gold standard test may be difficult to perform or may be impossible to perform on a living person (i.e. the test is performed as part of an [[autopsy]] or may take too long for the results of the test to be available to be clinically useful).

Other times, "gold standard" does not refer to the best performing test available, but the best available under reasonable conditions. For example, in this sense, a MRI is the gold standard for brain tumour diagnosis, though it is not as good as a biopsy. In this case the sensitivity and specificity of the gold standard are not 100% and it is said to be an "imperfect gold standard" or "alloyed gold standard".&lt;ref name=Alloy&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Donna Spiegelman, Sebastian Schneeweiss and Aidan McDermott|title=Measurement Error Correction for Logistic Regression Models with an "Alloyed Gold Standard"|journal=American Journal of Epidemiology|volume=145|issue=2|pages=184–196|url=http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/145/2/184.full.pdf|pmid=9006315|year=1997|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a009089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[ground truth]] refers to the underlying absolute state of information; the gold standard strives to represent the ground truth as closely as possible.  While the gold standard is a best effort to obtain the truth, ground truth is typically collected by direct observations.  In [[machine learning]] and [[information retrieval]], {{cnspan|text="ground truth" is the preferred term even when classifications may be imperfect; the gold standard is assumed to be the ground truth|date=February 2016}}.

One of the greatest challenges facing the builders of the [[Panama Canal]] was dealing with the [[tropical disease]]s rife in the area. The health measures taken during the construction contributed greatly to the success of the canal's construction. These included general health care, the provision of an extensive health infrastructure, and a major program to eradicate disease-carrying  [[mosquito]]es from the area.

== Background ==

===US control===
[[Image:gorgas.jpg|frame|William Crawford Gorgas, Chief Sanitary Officer to the Isthmian Commission]]

By the time the [[United States]] took control of the [[Panama Canal]] project on May 4, 1904, the [[Isthmus of Panama]] was notorious for [[tropical disease]]s. An estimated 12,000 workers had died during the construction of the [[Panama Railway]] and over 22,000 during the French effort to build a canal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pancanal.com/eng/history/history/french.html | title=The French Canal Construction | accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these deaths were due to disease, particularly  [[yellow fever]] and [[malaria]]. At several times, construction on the Panama Railway had actually halted due to the lack of healthy workers.

The high rate of deaths among workers on the Panama Canal due to disease was the source of a great deal of controversy in the United States. Newspapers, such as [[The Independent (Boston)|''The Independent'']], frequently reported on the poor conditions workers in the Canal Zone experienced, including the rampant disease. [[Poultney Bigelow]] wrote an article in ''The Independent'' in 1906 critiquing the work on the Panama Canal, which was highly influential with the American public. Among other topics, Bigelow brought attention to the poor living conditions of the workers, including pools of standing water where [[mosquitoes]] could breed and spread disease from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=40574566 | title=Theodore Roosevelt and the Heroes of Panama | author=Hogan, J. Michael | journal=Presidential Studies Quarterly |date=Winter 1989  | volume=19 | issue=1 | pages=79–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was clear to organizers of the American effort that previous disease control efforts had been largely ineffective, as the causes of the two main diseases were unknown, but in 1897 it was proved by Britain's [[Ronald Ross]] in India that malaria was spread by mosquitoes.

== The Sanitation effort ==
The Canal Commission appointed Colonel [[William C. Gorgas|William Crawford Gorgas]] in March 1904 as head of hospitals and sanitation. Under his leadership, many new departments of sanitation were founded, covering different aspects of the sanitation problem. Commissions were also formed to look after the basic welfare of laborers.

The sanitation work included clearing land and establishing quarantine facilities. The most ambitious part of the sanitation program, though, was undoubtedly the effort to eradicate the mosquitoes ''[[Aedes aegypti]]'' and ''[[Anopheles]]'', the carriers of [[yellow fever]] and [[malaria]], respectively, from the canal zone. There was initially considerable resistance to this program, as the "mosquito theory" was still considered controversial and unproven. However, with the support of chief engineer  [[John Frank Stevens]], who took over the post on July 26, 1905, Gorgas was finally able to put his ideas into action.

Gorgas divided [[Panama]] into 11 districts, and [[Colón, Panama]], into four. In each district, inspectors searched houses and buildings for mosquito larvae. If larvae were found, carpenters were dispatched to the building, and work was done to eliminate objects or places where [[Water stagnation|stagnant water]] could collect.

Mosquitoes lay their eggs on the surface of standing water, and when the [[larva]]e hatch, they live just below the surface, breathing through a siphon in their tails. Therefore, by eliminating standing water where possible and by spreading oil on the surface of any remaining pools, the larvae could be destroyed.

Gorgas also had domestic [[water supply network|water systems]] installed in urban areas around the Canal Zone. These systems eliminated the need for [[rainwater collection]], which had been collected in barrels and was a place for mosquitoes to breed. The United States government also provided $20 million to give workers free medical care and burial services. Gorgas's sanitation department also provided about one ton of [[History of malaria#Quinine|prophylactic quinine]] each year to people in the Canal Zone to combat malaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/contagion/panamacanal.html | title=Tropical Diseases and the Construction of the Panama Canal, 1904–1914 | publisher=Harvard University Library | accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gorgas organized a major program to drain and fill [[swamp]]s and [[wetland]]s around the Canal Zone. Many miles of ditches were dug, and grass and brush were cut back over wide areas. Oiling was used in a variety of means: workers with spray tanks were sent to spray oil on standing pools, and smaller streams were tackled by placing a dripping oil can over the waterway, which created a film of oil over each still patch of water in the stream. About 700,000 gallons of oil and 124,000 gallons of larvicide were used on the project. &lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:YellowFeverMalariaGraph.jpg|frame|thumbnail|50px|As a result of Gorgas's actions, cases of malaria and yellow fever in the canal zone dropped dramatically in a short period of time.]] --&gt;Gorgas also took another step in his efforts to eradicate mosquitoes in Panama: [[fumigation]]. He fumigated the residences of Panamanians who had been confirmed to have contracted yellow fever. "''Pans of [[sulfur]] or [[pyrethrum]] were then placed in the rooms, the right quantity of powder was weighed out (two pounds per thousand cubic feet), and the pans were sprinkled with wood-alcohol and set alight''" (Cameron 132). When the effectiveness of this procedure was realized, fumigation was extended to all of Panama. Within a year of Stevens's appointment, every building in Panama had been fumigated, using up the entire US supply of sulfur and pyrethrum. In 1906, only one case of yellow fever was reported, and until the end of the Panama Canal's construction, there were zero.

Gorgas's final means of attack on disease was to quarantine individuals infected with yellow fever or malaria from the rest of the workforce. Those who were diagnosed with either disease were put into "Portable Fever Cages", easily transportable screened structures used to prevent mosquitoes from biting an infected person and carrying the disease to others. Gorgas also had the thousands of canal workers sleep in screened verandas, as the mosquitoes that spread malaria are nocturnal and would infect the most people at night.

== Outcome ==
The first two and a half years of the American canal effort were substantially dedicated to preparation, much of it making the area fit for large-scale human habitation. A significant part of this was the sanitation program put in place by Gorgas. Nearly $20 million was spent on health and sanitation during the ten years.

In the end, these efforts were a success: by 1906, yellow fever was virtually wiped out in the Canal Zone, and the number of deaths caused by the other top disease, malaria, was also reduced significantly. The hospitals maintained were by far the best to be found anywhere in the tropics; some 32,000 patients were treated per year.

While disease reduction dramatically improved the health of white workers, black workers—the majority of the canal workforce—continued to die in large numbers, at ten times the rate of white workers in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;McCullough, pp. 501-502&lt;/ref&gt; While medical care was provided to all, housing was not provided to black workers, many of whom had to live in tents and tenements outside the mosquito-controlled zone. In the end, 350 white workers had died compared to 4,500 black workers.&lt;ref&gt;McCullough, p. 610&lt;/ref&gt; While the loss was tragic, it was far less than during the French era.

Today, the Panama canal area is regarded as free of yellow fever and malaria.

'''Host factor''' is a [[medicine|medical]] term referring to the traits of an individual person or animal that affect susceptibility to [[disease]], especially in comparison to other individuals. The term arose in the context of [[infectious disease]] research, in contrast to "organism factors", such as the virulence and infectivity of a microbe. Host factors that may vary in a population and affect disease susceptibility can be innate or acquired.

Some examples:
*general health
*psychological characteristics and attitude
*[[nutrition]]al state
*social ties
*previous exposure to the organism or related [[antigen]]s
*[[haplotype]] or other specific genetic differences of immune function
*[[substance abuse]]
*[[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]


The term is now used in [[oncology]] and many other medical contexts related to individual differences of disease vulnerability.

Humphreys). In December/January 1970 – 1971 he returned to Cuba to gain information for his paper titled “Cuba's Ley Contra La Vagancia - The Law on Loafing”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kennedy | first=Ian McColl | title=Cuba's Ley Contra La Vagancia - The Law on Loafing | page=1177 | volume=20 | year=1973 | journal=UCLA Law Review  | publisher=[[UCLA School of Law]] | url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/uclalr20&amp;div=46 | accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy was Dean of the Law School at [[King's College London]], from 1986 to 1996. Kennedy is [[Emeritus Professor]] of Health Law, Ethics and Policy at [[University College London]]. He is an honorary [[Bencher]] of the [[Inner Temple]].

==Committees and inquiries==

Kennedy has been a member of numerous committees and inquiries.&lt;ref name="UKRIO"/&gt;

For nine years, he was a member of the [[General Medical Council]]. In 1978, he founded the Centre of Medical Laws and Ethics, of which he later became president. He also served as member of the [[Medicines Commission]], and the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] advisory group on [[AIDS]]. He is a member of the board of the [[UK Research Integrity Office]].&lt;ref name="UKRIO"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ukrio.org/about-us/board-members/ | title=Advisory Board Members | publisher=[[UK Research Integrity Office]] | accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, he took part in a [[UK Government]] inquiry that gave cautious approval to [[xenotransplantation]] (the use of animal-to-human transplants), and in 1998, was a member of the committee that recommended [[pet passport]]s.

Kennedy was a member of the [[Nuffield Council on Bioethics]] 1991-2002 and Chair during 1998-2002.

Kennedy is a trustee of homeless health charity Pathway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pathway - Our People|url=http://www.pathway.org.uk/about-us/our-people/|website=Pathway - Healthcare for Homeless People|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He chaired the public inquiry into children's heart surgery at the [[Bristol Royal Infirmary]] (1998–2001),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bristol-inquiry.org.uk/about/whos_who/index.htm | title=Who's who | publisher=The Bristol Royal Infirmary Inquiry | archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090811143745/http://www.bristol-inquiry.org.uk/about/whos_who/index.htm | archivedate=11 August 2009 | accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which concluded that paediatric cardiac surgery services at Bristol were "simply not up to the task", because of shortages of key surgeons and nurses, and a lack of leadership, accountability, and teamwork. This resulted in his becoming chair of the [[Healthcare Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.healthcarecommission.org.uk/aboutus/whoarewe/thecommissioners.cfm | title=About us - The Commissioners | archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080930073207/http://www.healthcarecommission.org.uk/aboutus/whoarewe/thecommissioners.cfm | publisher=[[Healthcare Commission]] | archivedate=30 September 2008 | accessdate = 9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; from its creation (in shadow form) in 2003, until it was merged with other regulatory bodies to form the [[Care Quality Commission]] in 2009. In October 2009, Kennedy became chair of the [[King's Fund]]’s inquiry into the quality of general practice in England, replacing [[Niall Dickson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Sir Ian Kennedy joins The King's Fund's inquiry into the quality of general practice | url=http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/press/press-releases/sir-ian-kennedy-joins-kings-funds-inquiry-quality-general-practice | publisher=[[King's Fund]] | date=21 October 2009 | accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He led an enquiry into the work of breast surgeon [[Ian Paterson]] in Birmingham in 2013.

==Involvement in medicine and alternative medicine==
In 2010, he was elected inaugural Vice-President of the ''[[College of Medicine (UK)|College of Medicine]],''&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title=Professor Sir Ian Kennedy | url=http://www.collegeofmedicine.org.uk/professor-sir-ian-kennedy | publisher=[[The College of Medicine]] | accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; an organisation set up to bring together patients and clincians on an equal footing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=About the College of Medicine | publisher=[[The College of Medicine]] | url=http://www.collegeofmedicine.org.uk/about-college-medicine | accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3534">An '''internalizing disorder''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#-ise.2C -ize .28-isation.2C -ization.29|or]] '''internalising disorder''') is one type of [[emotional and behavioral disorder]], along with [[Externalizing Disorders|externalizing disorders]], and low incidence disorders.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=D.D.|title=Emotional or Behavioral Disorders Defined|url=http://www.education.com/reference/article/emotional-behavioral-disorders-defined/|work=education.com|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One who has an internalizing disorder will keep their problems to themselves, or [[Internalization#Internalization as symptom|internalize]] the problems.

== Symptoms ==
Behaviors that are apparent in those with internalizing disorders include [[Depression (mood)|depression]], withdrawal, [[anxiety]], and loneliness.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; There are also behavioral characteristics involved with internalizing disorders. Some behavioral abnormalities include poor [[self-esteem]], [[suicide|suicidal behaviors]], decreased academic progress, and social withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Internalizing Symptoms and Affect of Children with Emotional and Behavioral Disorders|url=http://www.studymode.com/essays/Internalizing-Symptoms-And-Affect-Of-Children-866577.html|work=studymode.com|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Internalizing one's problems, like sadness, can cause the problems to grow into larger burdens such as social withdrawal, suicidal behaviors or thoughts, and other unexplained physical symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DiMaria|first=Lauren|title=Internalizing Behaviors and Depression|url=http://depression.about.com/od/depressionsymptoms/a/internalizing-behaviors.htm|work=about.com|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bolivia|Bolivia’s]] government considers [[irrigation|irrigated agriculture]] as a major contributor to "better quality of life, rural and national development." After a period of social unrest caused by the privatization of water supply in [[Cochabamba]] and [[La Paz]], the government of [[Evo Morales]] is undertaking a major institutional reform in the water resources management and particularly in the irrigation sector, aimed at: (i) including indigenous and rural communities in decision making, (ii) integrating technical and traditional knowledge on water resources management and irrigation, (iii) granting and registering water rights, (iv) increasing efficiency of irrigation infrastructure, (v) enhancing water quality, and (v) promoting necessary investment and financial sustainability in the sector. Bolivia is the first country in Latin America with a ministry dedicated exclusively to integrated water resources management: the Water Ministry.

==Impacts of irrigated agriculture on rural development==
Bolivia is one of the [[Poverty|poorest]] countries in [[Latin America]]. In 2006 the annual income per capita reached to 1,153 dollars and almost 40% of the population lived in extreme poverty. In addition, Bolivia is one of the most unequal countries in the continent with a [[Gini coefficient]] of about 0.6 and 10% of the population obtaining over 40% of the total income and indigenous and rural populations in particular suffering the effects of social and economic marginalization.

During the 2000-2004 period agriculture contributed an average of 14% to GDP and employed 40% of the population. However, in the rural area agriculture employs up to 80% of the population. In 2001, the agricultural sector generated US$432 million and 30% of national exports. According to the Irrigation Vice-Ministry, the agricultural sector in the eastern part of Bolivia generated US$2,160 million exporting soya, sunflower and sugarcane products. The agricultural sector of the western part of Bolivia is mostly focused on subsistence agriculture and local markets.&lt;ref name="Country Brief"/&gt;

In addition, frequent government changes over the last five years and social tensions have undermined progress in poverty reduction. The Government of President Morales—Bolivia’s first indigenous President—who came into power in January 2006, has prepared a Plan Nacional de Desarrollo: Bolivia Digna, Soberana, Productiva y Democrática para Vivir Bien (PND).

Irrigation is a major component of the PND since it "plays a fundamental role in increasing agricultural production and diversification, rural employment, and food security in Bolivia" .&lt;ref name="Plan Nacional de Riego"&gt;{{cite web|title=Plan Nacional de Riego |url=http://www.riegobolivia.org/documentos/PlanNacionaldeRiego/PlanNacionaldeRiego.pdf |format=PDF |author=Viceministerio de Riego |publisher=Ministerio del Agua |date=July 2007 |pages=1–3 |accessdate=2008-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828003707/http://www.riegobolivia.org/documentos/PlanNacionaldeRiego/PlanNacionaldeRiego.pdf |archivedate=August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly, and according to the Water Ministry, irrigation contributes to rural development since it (i) decreases climatic risks providing water for ensure production; (ii) increases food security and supply to local and national markets; (iii) increases productivity generating export capacity and agricultural revenue; (iv) intensifies land use; (v) generates income and reduces migration; (vi) allows diversification of crops including high value cops; and (vii) generates productive investment.&lt;ref name="Plan Nacional de Riego"/&gt;

==Irrigation development==

===Irrigation infrastructure===
Bolivia has approximately 226,500 irrigated hectares (ha) or about 11% of the total agricultural land 2,100,000 ha. There are about 5,000 irrigation systems in Bolivia, most of them located in the South and Southwestern areas (Valles and Altiplano). These irrigation systems consist of rudimentary web of canals supplied by rainfall with few regulatory schemes such as dams, which makes them very vulnerable to seasonality of rain.&lt;ref name="Plan Nacional de Riego"/&gt; Overall efficiency of irrigation systems varies from 18 to 30% in traditional systems to 35-50% in improved systems.&lt;ref name="Agua en la Economia Nacional"/&gt;

===Linkages with water resources===
[[Image:Bl-map.png|right|framed|Map of Bolivia from the [[CIA World Factbook]].]]

Irrigation accounts for 94% of water withdrawals or about 2,000 million cubic meters annually.&lt;ref name="Giundale"/&gt; Bolivia can be divided into three areas, which correspond to the eastern area (a tropical and subtropical region), the western area (the arid, semi arid and sub-humid dry region), and the [[Lake Titicaca|Titicaca]] basin.
The hydrographic system consists of three large basins: the [[Amazon Basin]] which measures approximately 724,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and covers 66% of Bolivia’s territory; the closed ([[endorheic basin|endorheic]]) basin, which measures 145,081&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 13% of the territory; and the [[Paraguay River|Rio Plata Basin]], which covers 229,500&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 21% of the nation’s territory.
The Amazon basin has a high flow of water and it is prone to floods. The quantity and quality of hydrological information is very poor.&lt;ref name="Giundale"&gt;{{cite web

===Environmental impacts of irrigation===
The main impacts of irrigated agriculture in Bolivia are soil [[erosion]] and pollution due to agricultural runoff. Nearly 41% of Bolivia’s national territory has lost its production capacity due to '''soil erosion'''. For example, in western regions of [[Oruro Department|Oruro]], [[Potosí Department|Potosí]] and [[Tarija Department|Tarija]], close to 45,000 square kilometers have low soil productivity on account of erosion. The highland minifundios accelerate [[soil retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]] processes. In the northern highlands, the production area of family agricultural production units is three to five hectares. Excess [[Overgrazing|grazing]] and other agricultural activities have contributed to [[Soil salinity|salinization]] and soil compression.&lt;ref name="Giundale"/&gt;

Agricultural runoff is one of the main contributors to [[water pollution]] in Bolivia, together with domestic municipal [[wastewater]] and dumping by industries and mines. The greatest percentage of the pollution load is due to diffuse dumping from agricultural and fishing activities and runoffs of urban areas. There are no regulations or controls over major dumping from non-specific sources, despite its volume and toxicity.&lt;ref name="Giundale"/&gt;

==History of the irrigation sector==

===Agricultural land past and present trends===
[[Image:Llama en la laguna Colorada Potosí Bolivia.jpg|thumb|The [[llama]] is one of the icons of the Bolivian altiplano.]]

The [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonists]], soon after their arrival in the central [[Andes]] in the 16th century, appropriated the best farmlands on the coasts and valleys and pushed the indigenous population to the more inhospitable highlands. The highlands had been grazing grounds for [[llama]]s and [[alpaca]]s, but had not been used for agriculture because of their low productivity and high climatic risks. Under the new circumstances, the highlands became the center of Bolivia’s subsistence agriculture.

Traditionally Bolivia has been dependent on the mining sector as a source of fiscal revenue and foreign exchange, and directed few resources towards the agricultural sector.&lt;ref name="World Bank"/&gt; Following the 1985 economic reform, the government of [[Víctor Paz Estenssoro|Paz Estenssoro]] aimed at moving towards a distortion-free market economy that would attract private investment to the agricultural sector.  The World Bank considers that some of the reforms undertaken at that time were ill-informed, especially “the lack of constructive governmental intervention to provide needed public goods such as [[land titling]], agricultural research and extension, and irrigation infrastructure.” As a result, the agricultural sector has lacked the underpinnings in both human and physical capital that facilitate development. The absence of new production and irrigation technologies left farmers with limited opportunities to raise their productivity and income discouraging investment.&lt;ref name="World Bank"&gt;{{cite web

In 1999 the total area equipped for irrigation added up to 128,240ha. The irrigated area has almost doubled since. More than 50% of the irrigated area is concentrated in the provinces of [[Cochabamba]] and [[La Paz]] in the center of the country.&lt;ref name="FAO"&gt;

===Institutional development===
During the 1990s, water management was characterized by a sectoral approach with multitude of actors and legal approaches and overlapping of responsibilities. The Ministry of Rural Affairs and Indigenous People, the National Water Authority at the time, together with the Inter-Institutional Committee, the National Office for Irrigation and Drainage, and the National Secretary for Rural Development contributed to the mosaic of institutions in charge of water resources management for irrigation at the national level.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;
 
In 1998, the government approved a Resolution establishing the Water Intendancy as the authority for granting water user rights. In 1999, two major concessions for water and sanitation were granted to the private sector in La Paz and Cochabamba. The increase of water tariffs and the consequent limitation of access to water were followed with [[Cochabamba protests of 2000|social upraising in 2000]]. After what is known as the "Water War," water user associations, national and municipal government, NGOs and international research organizations engaged on intense negotiations aimed at redefining public water policies. This process is known by the Project for Water Rights (Proyecto Derechos de Agua – PDA). Irrigation organizations worked with PDA in creating a national irrigation strategy combining both traditional irrigation practices with technical and scientific knowledge. This participatory process informed the 2004 Irrigation Law No.2878 among others.&lt;ref name="Derecho de Acceso"&gt;{{cite web

Evo Morales administration is currently reforming the water institutional framework attributing competences to the newly created [https://web.archive.org/web/20090511124151/http://www.minagua.gov.bo/index.html Environment and Water Resources Ministry] as well as to municipalities and departments accordingly to the Decentralization Law No. 1654, and water users associations. The National Irrigation Plan has included as a challenge the still overlapping responsibilities of different institutions at the national and local level. (See institutional framework below)

==Legal and institutional framework==

===Legal framework===
The 2004 Irrigation Law No. 2878 aims at managing irrigation water resources through a decentralized institutional framework as well as securing water user rights through registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url   = http://www.riegobolivia.org/LeydeRiego2.html

 |title = Ley 2878 de Promoción y Apoyo al Sector Riego para la Producción Agropecuaria y Forestal
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Irrigation Law 2878 also transfers operation and maintenance of irrigation infrastructure to local farmers and establish participatory mechanisms to promote investment on irrigation systems. The previous law dated from 1906 and was considered obsolete.  through

The Irrigation Law specifically prohibits the transferring of water rights, hence the creation of water markets, and gives priority to collective users rights over individual users.&lt;ref name="30 Preguntas"&gt;{{cite web

Users are granted water rights through registries or authorizations. Registries are granted to the indigenous and local families or communities and are aimed at securing water access for domestic or traditional agriculture use respectively. Authorizations are granted to other farmer organizations for agricultural or agro-forestry use for a maximum of 40 years.

The Irrigation Law recognizes the Water Ministry, previous Ministry for Agriculture and Campesino Issues, as the national water authority and created the National Irrigation Service (Servicio Nacional de Riego – SENARI) and the Local Irrigation Service (Servicio Departamental de Riego – SEDERI).

===Institutional framework===
The '''[https://web.archive.org/web/20090511124151/http://www.minagua.gov.bo/index.html Environment and Water Resources Ministry]''', created in 2009, is responsible for: (i) planning, implementing, monitoring, evaluating, and funding irrigation plans and policies in close collaboration with SENARI;(ii) managing national and international funds aimed at irrigation development;(iii) promote technical assistance, capacity building and applied research and development in irrigation; and (iv) promote participative decentralization in irrigation development at the departmental, prefectural, municipal, local and river basin level as established in Law 2878. The Ministry for Rural Development, Agriculture and Environment share the same responsibilities than the Water Ministry.

The '''Vice-Ministry for Irrigation''' aims at: (i) guaranteeing sustainable water use for irrigation through a comprehensive system for granting water rights and permits (ii) promoting national and local investments, and (iii) strengthening institutional capacity through technical and financial support.

The '''Ministry of Development Planning''', together with the Water Ministry and the Ministry for Rural Development, Agriculture and Environment aims at: (i) planning and supervising water management at the river basin level, (ii) designing and implementation of environmental standards for irrigation works, (iii) monitoring water quality and mitigating water pollution.

'''SENARI''', under the Water Ministry, is responsible for planning and implementing water policies, granting water rights, conflict resolution, and coordinate with other water stakeholders and well as supervise SEDERI. '''SEDERIs''', branches of SENARI at the level of departments, are responsible for proposing departmental irrigation strategies, supervising the Departmental Irrigation Service, promoting capacity building among water users, and updating the irrigation registry at the department level. There are currently seven SEDERIs in the departments of Chuquisaca, Cochabamba, La Paz, Oruro, Potosi, Santa Cruz and Tarija.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riegobolivia.org/documentos/PlanNacionaldeRiego/PlanNacionaldeRiego.pdf |format=PDF |title=Plan Nacional de Riego |author=Viceministerio de Riego |publisher=Ministerio del Agua |date=July 2007 |pages=5, 9–10 |accessdate=2008-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828003707/http://www.riegobolivia.org/documentos/PlanNacionaldeRiego/PlanNacionaldeRiego.pdf |archivedate=August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple irrigation and '''water users associations''' at the local, regional, river basing and departmental level, comprising associations, cooperatives, committees and communities more or less formal. The government through the new Water Law is aiming at promoting registration of informal associations in the process of receiving water user rights. Irrigation associations are organized at the national level through the National Association of Irrigators and Local Water System, and at the Departmental level through Departmental Irrigation Units (Unidades Departamentales de Riego - UDR) and Departmental Irrigators Associations (Asociaciones Departamentales de Regantes - ADR).&lt;ref name="New"&gt;

===Government strategy for the irrigation sector===
[[Image:Morales 20060113 02.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Current president [[Evo Morales]]]]

[[Evo Morales]]’ administration is aiming at transforming the irrigation sector focusing on participatory decision-making and integrated water resources management at the river basin level with a strong emphasis on public investment.

In July 2007, Bolivia’s government approved a new National Irrigation Plan, called the "new PRONAR".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

 |df= 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
to be implemented from 2007 to 2030. The preceding National Irrigation program, also called PRONAR, was approved in 1996 and was implemented until 2005. The new PRONAR consist of five major components: (i)support agricultural and forestry production, (ii) support water resources management, (iii) strengthen institutional framework capacities, (iv)increase investment on irrigation and drainage infrastructure, and (v)integral technical assistance, capacity building and research. PRONAR aims at building irrigation infrastructure on 275,000 ha, benefiting 200,000 farmers, with a total investment of US$1.2 billion by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riegobolivia.org/documentos/PlanNacionaldeRiego/PlanNacionaldeRiego.pdf |format=PDF |author=Viceministerio de Riego |publisher=Ministerio del Agua |date=July 2007 |pages=5, 9–10 |accessdate=2008-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828003707/http://www.riegobolivia.org/documentos/PlanNacionaldeRiego/PlanNacionaldeRiego.pdf |archivedate=August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Key Legal Issues that Arise in Irrigation PPPs===
There are a number of legal and commercial issues that will affect how these projects move forward and are structured.  Whilst some of the legal issues are not confined to irrigation PPPs they can take on a new dimension and complexity when applied to irrigation: Land ownership; water extraction; public sector counterpart. These will be key issues in a PPP as the private provider will want to ensure a steady revenue stream.&lt;ref name="PPPIRC"&gt;{{cite web|last=PPPIRC|title=PPPs in Irrigation|url=http://ppp.worldbank.org/public-private-partnership/ppp-sector/water-sanitation/ppps-irrigation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also the usual legal considerations that need to be checked when developing PPPs in any sector, such as legal restrictions on the type of PPP arrangement that can be entered into, relevant procurement rules for entering into PPPs, existence of restrictions on foreign investment, taxation and potential for tax holidays and the ability to assign rights such as security and step in rights to lenders.&lt;ref name="PPPIRC"/&gt;

==Water tariff and cost recovery==
Farmers contribute to operational and maintenance costs of irrigation infrastructure both in cash and kind. The Water Ministry estimates that water users contribute with cash to cover maintenance costs in 45% irrigation systems. Irrigation systems such as Guadalupe and Pampa Redonda in Santa Cruz and Chiara in Cochabamba, a total of 10% of all irrigation systems, received any payment for operation costs.&lt;ref name="Giundale"/&gt;
 
For example, in Cochabamba users pay approximately US$4.1 application fee and US$9.6 registration fee. Users pay O&amp;M costs through a day of work or a US$2.7 fine per day of work.&lt;ref name="Agua en la Economia Nacional"&gt;

==Investment and financing==
In irrigation, there is trend of increasing investment in irrigation, from 132.7 UDS millions
in 2001 invested in rural development (including irrigation) to 168.3 USD million in 2002.
A large part of these investments were made through Municipal governments building
systems and transferring them to the communities, though in most of the cases there is no
clarity about who actually finally owns those systems.&lt;ref name="Bustamante"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iclei-europe.org/fileadmin/user_upload/logowater/resources/Local_govt_and_IWRM_Smits-Bustamante-Butterworth.pdf |format=PDF |title=Integrated water resources management at the local level:the role of local government |author=Smits, Step (et al.) |publisher=European Commission Research Directorate General |date=n.d. |page=1 |accessdate=2008-06-23 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding particular irrigation projects, PRONAR implemented 158 projects from 1996 to 2005, in seven out of the nine departments of Bolivia, investing US$20 million in close collaboration with the Inter American Development Bank, irrigation associations, and municipal governments.

==Possible climate change impacts on irrigated agriculture==
Although specific impacts of Climate Change on irrigation in Bolivia are still unknown, phenomena such as a high intensity [[El Nino-Southern Oscillation|El Nino]] in the form of floods, droughts, frost and hail are generally expected to affect Bolivia. Natural disasters directly affect the country’s development, because it hurts its economic results, weaken its social well-being, cause capital losses, and damage the roads and energy and irrigation infrastructure. Such losses, in turn, influence economic indicators such as inflation and production, which in turn increase poverty

Floods and landslides in the rainy season affect a wide range of infrastructure. Landslides in 1997 and 1998 in the communities of Cotahuma, Mokotor, and the Kunii area, in the department of La Paz, caused 24 deaths and destroyed 264 homes. An unprecedented hail storm in 2002 also in La Paz caused 70 deaths and damage was estimated at more than US$70 million. Droughts often recur, their area of incidence is quite large, and they are a major cause of migration from the countryside to the cities.&lt;ref name="Giundale"/&gt;

In addition, increase of temperatures in the Andes and the melting of glaciers may increase seasonal runoff in the short term and increase agricultural dependency on annual rainfall in the medium and long term. For example, Bolivia’s Chacaltaya glacier, situated 20&amp;nbsp;km NE of the city of La Paz, has lost 82% of its surface area since 1982 and may completely melt by 2013.&lt;ref name="Francou"&gt;

==External cooperation==
The World Bank is currently undertaken a US 78.1 million Second Participatory Rural Investment Project with the objective of piloting the consolidation of institutional arrangements between the national, prefecture and municipal governments and civil society for sustainable management of sub-national public investment in irrigated agriculture, forestry and fishing with an emphasis on territorial development. The World Bank is also supporting with US$12.5 million the implementation of the National Plan for Sustainable Rehabilitation and Reconstruction (PRRES), thought the Bolivia Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management Project aimed at strengthening the national system for risk management and rehabilitation, reconstruction, and small mitigation works.&lt;ref&gt;

|title=BO-T1039 : Evaluation and Design of Irrigation Project }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IDB together with the GTZ provided technical and financial assistance to Bolivia’s government in the implementation of a National Irrigation Plan, PRONAR that finalized in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
|url=http://www.gtz.de/en/
|title=GTZ }}&lt;/ref&gt; This evaluation is the groundwork for further collaboration among IDB and the Bolivia’s government.

==Lessons learned from Bolivia’s PRONAR==
The Water Ministry identified a number of lessons learned from the evaluation of PRONAR from 1996 to 2005. Some of the key aspects are:

*'''Infrastructure''' With PRONAR infrastructure was designed based on irrigation water requirements and water availability. It is necessary to also incorporate social, hydrological and topographical data when designing irrigation infrastructure to avoid technical problems during implementation. It is also necessary having strong local institutions able to manage and monitor implementation of irrigations works.
* '''Legal framework''' A well defined legal framework defining sectoral policy regarding public investment in private irrigation systems is crucial especially determining responsibility of operation and maintenance of public funded irrigation infrastructure.
*'''Economic impact of irrigation investment''' Irrigated agriculture has a major economic impact when it is applied to high value crops and farmers have a connection with a local or national markets. The connection with local or national markets is determined by access to transportation.

'''James Walker Dawson''' (1870, [[India]] - 26 June 1927, [[Edinburgh]]) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[pathologist]] remembered for his work on [[multiple sclerosis]] including the description of the eponymous [[Dawson's fingers]].

== Biography ==
James Dawson started his medical training at [[Edinburgh University]] in 1888, but had to interrupt his studies due to [[tuberculosis]]. He spent 13 years overseas, mainly in India, the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[New Zealand]], and worked as a [[lumberjack]] and [[Sheep husbandry|sheep farmer]] during that time.&lt;ref name=murray&gt;[[Thomas John Murray|T.J. Murray]]. ''Multiple Sclerosis: The History of a Disease'', page 190. Demos Medical Publishing LLC, 2005. {{ISBN|978-1-888799-80-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903 he resumed his training, and graduated M.B, C.M. the next year.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |date=July 1927 |title=James Walker Dawson, M.D., D.Sc., F.R.C.P.E., F.R.C.S.E. |journal=Br Med J |volume=2 |pmid= 20773303 |issue=3471 |pages=116–117 |id= |pmc=2524459 |quote= |doi= 10.1136/bmj.2.3471.116-c }}&lt;/ref&gt; He started research into disorders of the [[nervous system]] at the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]] under Dr. Alexander Bruce. In 1910, he was awarded the Syme Fellowship in surgery, and the following year he was awarded his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] with a gold medal for his thesis ''Studies on Inflammation''. He was unable to serve in [[World War I]] due to ill health, so he taught pathology at the University of Edinburgh.

Bruce died unexpectedly, and Dawson continued the research on his own. In 1916 he published a landmark paper on the histology of ''"disseminated sclerosis"'', describing the distribution and stages of lesions, reviewing theories on the aetiology and describing the inflammatory process seen in the disease.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson JD. The Histology of Disseminated Sclerosis. ''Trans Royal Soc Edin''. 1916; 50: 517-740.&lt;/ref&gt; This work formed the basis for his [[Doctor of Science|D.Sc.]] thesis in the same year. In his book ''The Founders of Neurology'' which was published in 1953, W. Haymaker stated that little had been added to this work in the intervening 40 years.&lt;ref name=murray /&gt;

He declined a number of appointments, again due to ill health, and continued working as a [[histologist]] in the laboratory at the Royal College of Physicians in Edinburgh. He produced publications including work on multiple [[neuroma]]ta of the [[central nervous system]], [[Osteitis fibrosa cystica|generalised osteitis fibrosa]], [[melanoma]]ta and [[syringomyelia]]. He became a [[Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians]] in 1924, and also published an address on ''The Spirit of Leisure and the Spirit of Work'' which was presented to Edinburgh medical students for many years.&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Dawson: The spirit of leisure and the spirit of work. ''Edinburgh Medical Journal'', January 1924.&lt;/ref&gt; He was preparing three Morison Lectures for presentation to the Royal College of Physicians at the time of his death in 1927.

James Dawson was married to Edith Kate Dawson, who was herself a pathologist of international repute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcsed.ac.uk/site/PID=10112004152441/760/default.aspx Dawson, Edith Kate MA MD FRCSEd.] The Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh Collected Papers.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lake Doxa''' ({{lang-el|Λίμνη Δόξα}} ''Limni Doxa'') is an [[reservoir|artificial lake]] in western [[Corinthia]], [[Greece]]. It is situated at an elevation of 900 m, in the municipal unit [[Feneos]], near the village [[Archaia Feneos]]. Construction was completed in the late 1990s. It is fed and drained by the small river ''Doxa'' (''Δόξα''), which empties into the plain of Feneos. In the heart of the lake on a small peninsula features a small church of [[Agios Fanourios]]. The [[Saint George Monastery in Feneos]] was relocated to higher ground, north of the lake. The lake is surrounded by pine forests.

The earliest lock hospitals in India were established around 1797 at [[Berhampur]], [[Kanpur]], [[Danapur]], and [[Fatehgarh]]. They were usually within bazaars, surrounded by a mud wall and manned by a doctor and a woman assistant. The local police were in charge of rounding-up women suspected of being diseased, who could return home only after obtaining a certificate of discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wald |first=Erica |date=5 May 2009 |title=From begums and bibis to abandoned females and idle women |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/001946460804600102 |journal=The Indian Economic &amp; Social History Review |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=5–25 |doi=10.1177/001946460804600102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "lock hospital" originates from their use as [[leprosarium]]s, in which the patients were kept in restraints.&lt;ref name=Loundes/&gt;{{rp|3}}

The '''Medical Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal''' of [[New Zealand]] hears and determines disciplinary proceedings brought against [[medical practitioner]]s under Part VIII of the [[Medical Practitioners Act of 1995]].

The Tribunal comprises a Chair, a senior Deputy Chair, a Deputy Chair and a panel of not fewer than 12 members, all appointed by the Minister of Health. When the Tribunal sits to hear and determine any matter it sits with a Chair or Deputy Chair and four members, three of whom are medical practitioners, and one person who is not a medical practitioner.

The Medical Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal is in the process of being superseded by the [[Health Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal]] of New Zealand, established under the [[Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003]] which came into effect on 18 September 2004.

'''Money-rich, time-poor''' is an expression which arose in [[UK|Britain]] at the end of the 20th century to describe groups of people who, whilst having a high disposable income through well-paid employment, have relatively little [[leisure time]] as a result. '''Time poverty''' has also been coined as a noun for the phenomenon.

Many people accept time poverty as a necessary condition of employment; others have sought to solve the problem through [[Downshifting (lifestyle)|downshifting]] or through adoption of [[Flexible working hours|flexible working]] arrangements.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}  The problem affects both salaried workers who work long hours even though they might be well compensated as well as hourly low-wage workers who work long hours to earn more money.

'''Musica Humana Research''' is a collaboration between art, music and [[medical research]]  
 
The idea behind this project was the creation of a specially composed and designed music for [[therapy|treatment]] of hospitalized patients and was initiated by Professor M.D. Lars Heslet [[Copenhagen University Hospital]] and the composer and oboist [[Niels Eje]] during the nineties. 
In 1998 the [[Egmont Foundation]] granted economic support to complete the project.
 
The Egmont Foundation grant (1998–2003) was primarily aimed at developing a special composed music programme targeted at improving the sound [[built environment|environment]] in intensive care and recovery wards at a number of hospitals in [[Denmark]]. 

This specially designed music was to be created by composer Niels Eje and according to the grant foundation, implemented and scientifically validated by a group of researchers affiliated to the project. 
The goal was to actively use specially designed music to improve patient [[wellbeing]] and [[Contentment|satisfaction]] during hospitalisation, reduce [[anxiety]] and [[stress (biological)|stress]], and also improve the patients ability to recover.

Since 2001 Musica Humana Research has carried out many activities, including publishing and drawing attention to the research results and how to improve the sound environment for patients in hospitals. The activities includes articles in [[medical journal]]s, [[presentation]]s at [[Academic conference|conferences]] and symposiums all over the world.
 
Musica Humana Research has since 2003 become an international network of independent researchers, achieving positive and documented results with [[clinical trials]] in Denmark, [[Sweden]], [[Norway]] and United States.

'''''N''-Nitroso-''N''-methylurea''' (NMU) is a highly reliable [[carcinogen]], [[mutagen]], and [[teratogen]]. NMU is an alkylating agent, and exhibits its toxicity by transferring its [[methyl]] group to [[nucleobases]] in [[nucleic acids]], which can lead to AT:GC [[transition (genetics)|transition]] mutations.

NMU is the traditional precursor in the synthesis of [[diazomethane]]. However, because it is unstable at temperatures beyond 20 °C and somewhat shock-sensitive, it has become obsolete for this purpose and replaced by other N-nitroso compounds: (''N''-methyl)nitrosamides and [[nitrosamine]]s. Most chemical supply houses have stopped carrying it.

Acute exposure to NMU in humans can result in skin and eye irritation, headache, nausea, and vomiting.&lt;ref name="NJ1"&gt;[http://nj.gov/health/eoh/rtkweb/documents/fs/1411.pdf Hazardous Substance Fact Sheet for NMU] New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services&lt;/ref&gt; NMU is ''reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen'' based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals ([[International Agency for Research on Cancer|IARC]] 1972, 1978, 1987).&lt;ref name="NTP1"&gt;[http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/eleventh/profiles/s132nitr.pdf NMU Substance Profile] NTP, Report on Carcinogens, Eleventh Edition&lt;/ref&gt; Various cancers induced in animal models include: squamous cell [[carcinoma]]s of the forestomach, [[sarcoma]]s and [[glioma]]s of the brain, [[adenocarcinoma]]s of the pancreas, mammary carcinomas, [[leukemia]], and [[lymphoma]]s.&lt;ref name="NTP1"/&gt; However, the actual potential for human exposure is quite limited, as the chemical is not produced or used in large quantities &lt;ref name="NTP1"/&gt;

NMU is teratogenic and embryotoxic, resulting in craniofacial ([[cleft palate]]) and skeletal defects, fetal growth retardation, and increased [[vanishing twin|fetal resorption]].&lt;ref name="wada"&gt;Wada, A., et al. (1994). Induction of Congenital Malformations in Mice by Paternal Methylnitrosourea Treatment. Congenital Anomalies '''34''':65-70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nagao"&gt;Nagao, T., et al. (1991). Induction of Fetal Malformations After Treatment of Mouse Embryos with Methylnitrosourea at the Preimplantation Stages. Teratogenesis, Carcinogenesis, and Mutagenesis '''11''':1-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Faustman"&gt;Faustman, E., et al. (1989). ''In Vitro'' Developmental Toxicity of Five Direct-Acting Alkylating Agents in Rodent Embryos: Structure-Activity Patterns. Teratology '''40''':199-210.&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure to NMU during pre-implantation, post-implantation, organogenesis, or by paternal exposure can result in these effects.

A '''nightmare''', also called a '''bad dream''',&lt;ref name="OEtymD"&gt;{{OEtymD|nightmare}} Retrieved July 11, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; is an unpleasant [[dream]] that can cause a strong emotional response from the mind, typically [[fear]] but also [[despair (emotion)|despair]], [[anxiety]] and great [[sadness]]. However, psychological nomenclature differentiates between nightmares and bad dreams, specifically, people remain asleep during bad dreams whereas nightmares awaken individuals.  Further, the process of psychological homeostasis employs bad dreams to protect an individual's Homeostatically Protected Mood (HPMood) from the impact of elevated anxiety levels. During sleep, nightmares indicate the failure of the homeostatic system employing bad dreams to extinguish anxiety accumulated throughout the day. &lt;ref&gt;Tunbridge, Lindsay (2014), International Journal of Dream Research, Vol 7 Issue 1, http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:16-ijodr-119592&lt;/ref&gt;  The dream may contain situations of discomfort, psychological or physical terror or panic. After a nightmare, a person will often awaken in a state of distress and may be unable to return to [[sleep]] for a short period of time.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association (2000), Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed, TR, p. 631&lt;/ref&gt;

Nightmares can have [[Human body|physical]] causes such as sleeping in an uncomfortable position or having a [[fever]], or [[Psychology|psychological]] causes such as [[stress (medicine)|stress]] or [[anxiety]]. Eating before going to sleep, which triggers an increase in the body's [[metabolism]] and [[brain]] activity, is a potential stimulus for nightmares.&lt;ref name=Stephens&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stephen, |first=Laura |title=Nightmares |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/nightmare.html |year=2006 |publisher=Psychologytoday.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831193305/http://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/nightmare.html |archivedate=31 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recurrent nightmares may require [[medical]] help, as they can interfere with sleeping patterns and cause [[insomnia]].

==Cause==
Scientific research shows that nightmares may have many causes.
In a study focusing on children, researchers were able to conclude that nightmares directly correlate with the stress in children's lives. Children who experienced the death of a family member or a close friend or know someone with a chronic illness have more frequent nightmares than those who are only faced with stress from school or stress from social aspects of daily life.&lt;ref&gt;Schredl, Michael, et al. "Nightmares and Stress in Children." Sleep and Hypnosis 10.1 (2008): 19-25. ProQuest. Web. 29 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
A study researching the causes of nightmares focuses on patients who have [[sleep apnea]]. The study was conducted to determine whether or not nightmares may be caused by sleep apnea, or being unable to breathe. In the nineteenth century, authors believed that nightmares were caused by not having enough oxygen, therefore it was believed that those with sleep apnea had more frequent nightmares than those without. The hypothesis, however, was proven wrong and the results actually showed that healthy people have more nightmares than the sleep apnea patients.&lt;ref&gt;Schredl, Michael, et al. "Nightmares and Oxygen Desaturations: Is Sleep Apnea Related to Heightened Nightmare Frequency?" Sleep and Breathing 10.4 (2006): 203-9. ProQuest. Web. 24 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Stephen LaBerge's book entitled ''Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming (1990)'' he outlines a possible reason for how dreams are formulated and why nightmares occur with a high frequency. A dream starts with an individual thought or scene, in his example he uses the scene of walking down a dimly lit street. Since dreams are not predetermined, your brain responds to the situation by either thinking a good thought or a bad thought, and the dream framework follows from there. Since the prominence of bad thoughts in dreams is higher than good, the dream will proceed to be a nightmare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming|last=Stephen|first=LaBerge|publisher=BALLANTINE BOOKS|year=1990|isbn=|location=New York|pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a popular view, featured in the story ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', that eating [[cheese]] before sleep can cause nightmares, but there is little scientific evidence for this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hammond |first=Claudia |date=17 April 2012 |title=Does cheese give you nightmares? |url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120417-does-cheese-give-you-nightmares |work=BBC |access-date=7 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible effects==
A study involving a large group of undergraduate students analyzes the effects of nightmares on the quality of sleep. The study showed that the participants experienced abnormal sleep architecture and that the results of having a nightmare during the night were very similar to those of people who have insomnia. This means that, like insomniacs, people who have nightmares do not get as much rest as those who do not have chronic nightmares. Therefore, they experience a lesser quality of sleep than others. This is thought to be caused by frequent nocturnal awakenings and fear of falling asleep.&lt;ref&gt;Simor, Pé, et al. "Disturbed Dreaming and Sleep Quality: Altered Sleep Architecture in Subjects with Frequent Nightmares."European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience 262.8 (2012): 687-96. ProQuest. Web. 24 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
[[File:John Henry Fuseli - The Nightmare.JPG|thumb|''[[The Nightmare]]'' ([[Henry Fuseli]], 1781)]]
[[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]] seemed to have shared a belief that people frequently distressed by nightmares could be re-experiencing some stressful event from the past.&lt;ref name="Coalson 1985, Web"&gt;Coalson 1985, Web&lt;/ref&gt; Both perspectives on dreams suggest that therapy can provide relief from the dilemma of the nightmare experience.

Halliday (1987), grouped treatment techniques into four classes. Direct nightmare interventions that combine compatible techniques from one or more of these classes may enhance overall treatment effectiveness:&lt;ref&gt;Halliday 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Analytical technique|Analytic]] and [[cathartic]] techniques
* Story-line alteration procedures
* Face-and-conquer approaches
* [[Desensitization (psychology)|Desensitization]] and related behavioral techniques.

===Post-traumatic stress disorder===
Reccurring [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]] nightmares in which real traumas are re-experienced respond well to a technique called '''imagery rehearsal'''. First described in the 1996 book ''[[Trauma and Dreams]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0-674-00690-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Harvard psychologist [[Deirdre Barrett]], this [[contemporary dream interpretation]] involves dreamers coming up with alternative, mastery outcomes to the nightmares, mentally rehearsing those outcomes awake, and then reminding themselves at bedtime that they wish these alternate outcomes should the nightmares reoccur. Research has found that this technique not only reduces the occurrence of nightmares and insomnia,&lt;ref name="pmid15984916"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = J.

There have been multiple studies conducted under placebo-controlled conditions. (Am J Psychiatry 2003; 160:371–373)
&lt;blockquote&gt;A comprehensive model has been put forth by Krakow and Zadra (2006) that includes four group treatment sessions, ~2.25 to 2.5 hr in length. The first two sessions focus on how nightmares are closely connected to [[insomnia]] and how they become an independent [[symptom]] or disorder that warrants individually tailored and targeted intervention. The last two sessions focus on the imagery system and how IRT can reshape and eliminate nightmares through a relatively straightforward process akin to [[cognitive restructuring]] via the human imagery system. First, the patient is asked to select a nightmare, but for learning purposes the choice would not typically be one that causes a marked degree of distress. Second, and most commonly, guidance is not provided on how to change the disturbing content of the dream; the specific instruction developed by Joseph Neidhardt is "change the nightmare anyway you wish" (Neidhardt et al., 1992). In turn, this step creates a "new" or "different" dream, which may or may not be free of distressing elements. Our instructions, unequivocally, do not make a suggestion to the patient to make the dream less distressing or more positive or to do anything other than "change the nightmare anyway you wish." Last, the patient is instructed to rehearse the "new dream" through imagery and to ignore the old nightmare.p. 234&lt;ref name="pmid19444882"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some people may experience recurring nightmares due to [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), or they may have some other source of [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]] that influences their [[dreams]] at night.&lt;ref name="Coalson 1985, Web"/&gt; Whatever the cause, there are treatments available, some of them medical and some [[psychological]]. While most treatments are meant for people who have a true disorder, the techniques discussed above will work well for any person dealing with nightmares.&lt;ref name="Coalson 1985, Web"/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Fearfulness in waking life is correlated with nightmares.&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15778923 The Science Behind Dreams and Nightmares], ''Talk of the Nation'', National Public Radio. 30 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of dreams have estimated that about 75% of the time, the emotions evoked by dreams are negative.&lt;ref name="npr"/&gt; However, it is worth noting that people are more likely to remember unpleasant dreams.

One definition of "nightmare" is a dream which causes one to wake up in the middle of the sleep cycle and experience a negative emotion, such as fear. This type of event occurs on average once per month. They are not common in children under five, but they are more common in young children (25% experiencing a nightmare at least once per week), most common in teenagers, and common in adults (dropping in frequency about one third from age 25 to 55).&lt;ref name="npr"/&gt;

==Etymology==
The word "nightmare" is derived from the [[Old English language|Old English]] "[[mare (folklore)|mare]]", a mythological [[demon]] or goblin who [[Harassment|torments]] others with frightening dreams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Word Origins And How We Know Them |last=Liberman |first=Anatoly |authorlink=Anatoly Liberman |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-538707-0 |page=87 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sMiRc-JFIfMC&amp;pg=PA87#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=29 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the prefix "night-" was added to stress the dream aspect. The word "nightmare" is cognate with the older Dutch term ''nachtmerrie'' and German ''Nachtmahr'' (dated).

[[File:Organs involved during Pointing and Calling.jpg|thumb|right|Pointing and calling requires co-action and co-reaction among the operator's brain, eyes, hands, mouth, and ears.]]
'''Pointing and calling''' is a method in [[occupational safety]] for avoiding mistakes by pointing at important indicators and calling out the status. It is common in [[Japan]] and railways of [[Taiwan]], it is also sometimes referred to by its Japanese terms, ''shisa kanko'' ({{lang|ja|指差喚呼}}), ''shisa kakunin kanko'' ({{lang|ja|指差確認喚呼}}) or ''yubisashi koshō'' ({{lang|ja|指差呼称}}). Making large gestures and speaking out the status helps keeping focus and [[attention]]. The method was first used by train drivers and is now commonly used in Japanese industry. It is not common in other countries, though it is used in the [[New York City Subway]] system. It is recommended by the [[Japan Industrial Safety and Health Association]] (JISHA, {{lang|ja|中央労働災害防止協会}}).&lt;ref name="japantimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2008/10/21/reference/jr-gestures/#.VL7Xg-d2MTk|title=JR gestures|last=Gordenker|first=Alice|date=October 21, 2008|publisher=[[The Japan Times]]|accessdate=2008-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jica.go.jp/english/operations/evaluation/jica_archive/project/term/latin_america/mexico_2001_3.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20110716123642/http://www.jica.go.jp/english/operations/evaluation/jica_archive/project/term/latin_america/mexico_2001_3.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-07-16|title=Terminal Evaluation - Latin America and the Caribbean|publisher=[[Japan International Cooperation Agency]]|accessdate=2008-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pointing and Calling Japanese Safety Standard at Railway Companies &amp; Toyota (HD).webm|thumb|right|(video) different train operators and factory workers using Pointing and Calling.]]
Pointing and calling requires co-action and co-reaction among the operator's [[human brain|brain]], [[human eye|eyes]], [[hands]], [[mouth]], and [[ears]].

==History==
The method originated in Japan in the early 1900s, with train drivers calling out the status of signals. The pointing was added a few decades later.&lt;ref name="japantimes" /&gt;

==Effectiveness==
A 1994 study by the [[Railway Technical Research Institute]] showed that pointing and calling reduced mistakes by almost 85 percent when doing a simple task.&lt;ref name="japantimes" /&gt;

'''Ride for Hope''' is a US coast to coast [[Relay race|relay]] [[Cycling|cycle ride]] which takes place over 10 days. Teams of riders cycle for 50 miles each day from [[Sausalito, California|Sausalito, CA]] to [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis, MD]] covering a total of 3080 miles.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}&lt;!-- 50 miles times 10 days = 500, not 3080 --&gt;

The ride is organised to raise funds for the [[orphan]]s in [[Africa]] from the [[AIDS]] and [[HIV]] [[pandemic]] who are supported by Christ's Hope International. The organiser and leader for the ride Tim Patton is a serious cyclist who started the event after having been to Africa and seeing the plight of the orphans there himself.

'Ride for Hope' takes place in June 2009, 7th to the 17th and has so far raised $100,000 in support for the orphans.

As the teams cycle through [[Chicago]] on June 13, people are invited to join a 50 miles cycle to show support for the cause.

More information on this event and Christ's Hope International is available at [http://www.christshopeusa.org Ride for Hope]

The '''Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia''' is a medical organization that promotes the science and practice of [[pathology]]. It has members in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Saudi Arabia]]. 

The object of the College is:&lt;blockquote&gt; ''To promote the study of the science and practice of Pathology in relation to medicine; to encourage research in pathology and ancillary sciences, to bring together pathologists for their common benefit and for scientific discussions and demonstrations; and to disseminate knowledge of the principles and practice of pathology in relation to medicine by such means as may be thought fit.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
[[File:West0025.jpg|right|thumb|Heritage-listed [[Durham Hall, Surry Hills|Durham Hall]], Albion Street, [[Surry Hills, New South Wales|Surry Hills]], offices for the College since 1986.]]
The College of Pathologists of Australia was incorporated on 10 April 1956.  In 1970, the College was granted Royal assent, and became the Royal College of Pathologists of Australia.  With the increasing number of Fellows in New Zealand, the College changed its name to the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia in January 1980.
Since 1986, the College has occupied [[Durham Hall, Surry Hills|Durham Hall]], a heritage listed building in [[Sydney]]'s [[Surry Hills, New South Wales|Surry Hills]]&lt;ref name=nswshr-221&gt;{{cite NSW SHR|5045266|Durham Hall|hr=00221|fn=EF14/5393; S90/3357; HC32348|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the adjacent [[203-205 Albion Street, Surry Hills|203-205 Albion Street, Surry Hills cottages]].&lt;ref name=nswshr-443&gt;{{cite NSW SHR|5045167|Cottage|hr=00443|fn=10/3256; S90/06062; HC 32234|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programmes==
===Training and examinations===
The College conducts training and examinations in several sub-disciplines, including:
* [[Anatomical Pathology]]
* [[clinical chemistry|Chemical Pathology]]
* [[Forensic Pathology]]
* [[General Pathology]]
* [[Genetics]]
* [[Haematology]]
* [[Immunopathology]]
* [[Microbiology]]

The College accredits laboratories for training, approves supervised training in accredicted laboratories, and conducts examinations leading to Fellowship of the College ('''FRCPA''').

===Continuing Professional Development===
Since its inception, the College has contributed to the continual development of knowledge and skills of it Fellows, and has established a formal Continuing Professional Development Program.

==Professional Practice Standards==
The College collaborated with the Commonwealth Government to establish the National Pathology Accreditation Advisory Council (NPAAC) in 1979. NPAAC advises the Commonwealth, State and Territory Health Ministers on matters relating to the accreditation of pathology laboratories, plays a key role in ensuring the quality of Australian pathology services and is responsible for the development and maintenance of standards and guidelines for pathology practices. 

While NPAAC provides the standards for laboratory practice, the actual accreditation process is carried out by NATA/RCPA, a joint initiative between the College and the National Association of Testing Authorities ([http://nata.asn.au NATA]).

'''Self-administration''' is, in its [[Medicine|medical]] sense, the process of a subject administering a [[Pharmacology|pharmacological]] substance to themself. A clinical example of this is the subcutaneous "self-injection" of [[insulin]] by a [[Diabetes|diabetic]] patient.

In [[animal experimentation]], self-administration is a form of [[operant conditioning]] where the [[Reinforcement|reward]] is a drug.  This drug can be administered remotely through an implanted intravenous line or an intracerebroventricular injection.  Self-administration of putatively addictive drugs is considered one of the most valid experimental models to investigate [[Substance dependence|drug-seeking]] and drug-taking behavior.  The higher the frequency with which a test animal emits the operant behavior, the more rewarding (and [[Drug addiction|addictive]]), the test substance is considered.  Self-administration of addictive drugs has been studied using humans,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Higgins  | first = Stephen | authorlink =   |author2=Warren K. Bickel |author3=John R.

Self-administration of heroin and cocaine is used to screen drugs for possible effects in reducing drug-taking behavior, especially [[reinstatement]] of drug seeking after [[extinction (psychology)|extinction]].  Drugs with this effect may be useful for treating people with drug addiction by helping them establish abstinence or reducing their probability or relapsing to drug use after a period of abstinence.

In a prominent model of self-administration developed by [[George Koob]], rats are allowed to self-administer cocaine for either 1&amp;nbsp;hour each day (short access) or 6&amp;nbsp;hours each day (long access).  Those animals who are allowed to self-administer for 6&amp;nbsp;hours a day show behavior that is thought to resemble cocaine dependence, such as an escalation of the total dose taken during each session and an increase in the dose taken when cocaine is first made available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=George F. |last1=Koob |first2=Michel |last2=LeMoal |title=Neurobiology of Addiction |publisher=Academic Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-12-419239-3}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The "self-administration" behavioral paradigm serves as an animal behavioral model of the human pathology of addiction.  During the task, animal subjects are operant conditioned to perform one action, typically a lever press, in order to receive a drug.  Reinforcement (through the use of the drug) occurs contingent upon the subject performing the desired behavior. Drug dosing in self-administration studies is response-dependent. This is an important element of creating a disease model of drug addiction in humans because response-independent drug administration is associated with increased toxicity and different neurobiological, neurochemical and behavioral effects.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, B.D (Ed.). (2003). Methods in Drug Abuse Research: Cellular and Circuit Level Analyses (17-50). Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press LLC.&lt;/ref&gt; In summary, the effects of response-dependent drug dosing greatly differ from response-independent drug dosing and self-administration studies appropriately capture this distinction.

===History===

As far back as the mid-20th century, researchers have investigated animals’ drive to consume drugs of abuse in order to better understand human addictive processes.  Spragg was one of the first researchers to create a model of chronic morphinism in a chimpanzee to explore the role of operant conditioning in relation to a drug dependency.  When deprived of both food and morphine, chimpanzees would repeatedly attempt to seek out the drug of choice, even doing so much as to physically pull the experimenter into the room housing morphine and syringes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Spragg S.D.S. | year = 1940 | title = Morphine addiction in chimpanzees | url = | journal = Comparative Psychology Monographs | volume = 15 | issue = 7| pages = 1–132 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Weeks (1962) published an account of the first true use of the intravenous self-administration paradigm in a study aiming to model morphine addiction in unrestrained rats.  For the first time, a drug of abuse served as an operant reinforcer and rats self-administered morphine to satiety in stereotyped response patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Weeks J. R. | year = 1962 | title = Experimental morphine addiction: Method for automatic intravenous injections in unrestrained rats | url = | journal = Science | volume = 138 | issue = | pages = 143–144 | doi=10.1126/science.138.3537.143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific community quickly adopted the self-administration paradigm as a behavioral means to examine addictive processes and adapted it to non-human primates. Thompson and Schuster (1964) studied the relative reinforcement properties of morphine in restrained [[rhesus monkey]]s using intravenous self-administration. Significant changes in response to other types of reinforcers (i.e., food, shock avoidance) were observed in drug-dependent subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Thompson T. |author2=Schuster C.R. | year = 1964 | title = Morphine self-administration, food-reinforced, and avoidance behaviors in rhesus monkeys | url = https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/46396/1/213_2004_Article_BF00413045.pdf| journal = Psychopharmacologia | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 87–94 | doi=10.1007/bf00413045}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1969, Deneau, Yanagita and Seevers provided macaque monkeys free access to a variety of drugs of abuse for investigating whether nonhuman primates would voluntarily initiate self-administration of these substances.  Initiation and maintenance of self-administration produced dependence and toxicity in monkeys, thereby more closely approximating important aspects of drug addiction in humans and allowing for the first of modern self-administration studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Deneau G. |author2=Yanagita T. |author3=Seevers M.H. | year = 1969 | title = Self-administration of psychoactive substances by the monkey | url = | journal = Psychopharmacology | volume = 16 | issue = 1| pages = 30–48 | doi=10.1007/bf00405254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The procedure of testing the efficacy of a pharmacological agent as a reinforcer would soon become a standard assay.  Most frequently, studies were performed in nonhuman primates to identify abuse potential, as required by the drug development process. In 1983, Collins ''et al.'' published a landmark paper in which rats were exposed to a battery of 27 psychoactive substances. The team compared test drug self-administration rates with saline vehicle self-administration rates.  If animals self-administered at a rate significantly greater than vehicle, the drug was considered an active reinforcer with abuse potential.  With few exceptions, the abuse liability observed in rats paralleled that observed from previous research in monkeys.  In light of these similarities between the different animal models, it was identified that the abuse potential of psychoactive substances could be investigated using rats instead of nonhuman primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Collins R.J. |author2=Weeks J.R. |author3=Cooper M.M. |author4=Good P.I. |author5=Russell R.R. | year = 1984 | title = Prediction of abuse liability of drugs using IV self-administration by rats | url = | journal = Psychopharmacology | volume = 82 | issue = | pages = 6–13 | doi=10.1007/bf00426372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==

===Acquisition===
Operant conditioning represents the behavioral paradigm underlying self-administration studies.   Although not always required, subjects may be first pre-trained to perform some action, such as a lever press or nosepoke to receive a food or water reward (under food- or water- restricted conditions, respectively). Following this initial training, the reinforcer is replaced by a test drug to be administered by one of the following methods: oral, inhalation, intracerebral, intravenous. Intravenous catheterization is used most commonly because it maximizes bioavailability and has rapid onset, although is inappropriate for drugs taken orally, such as alcohol.  Humans suffering from addiction often resort to intravenous drug use for similar reasons, so this route of administration increases the face validity of the construct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Panlilio L. V. |author2=Goldberg S. R. | year = 2007 | title = Self-administration of drugs in animals and humans as a model and an investigative tool | journal = Addiction | volume = 102 | issue = | pages = 1863–1870 | doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2007.02011.x | pmid=18031422 | pmc=2695138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maintenance===
Upon presentation of the drug to the subject, a number of experimental variables might be manipulated to test hypotheses:

===Dose-response relationship===
[[File:Dose response2.png|300px|thumb|right|Dose-response relationship in cocaine self-administering mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Pomrenze M |author2=Baratta V. M |author3=Cadle B. |author4=Cooper Donald C. | year = 2012 | title = Cocaine self-administration in the mouse: A low- cost, chronic catheter preparation | url = | journal = Nature Precedings | volume =  | issue = | page =  | doi = 10.1038/npre.2012.7040.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Both humans and animals will adjust the rate and number of drug infusions to maintain stable rewarding blood levels of drugs, like cocaine.  A dilute dose of cocaine will be administered intravenously at a faster rate than a concentrated dose of cocaine.&lt;ref&gt;Pomrenze M, Baratta, V. M, Cadle, B., Donald C. Cooper (2012). Cocaine self-administration in the mouse: A low- cost, chronic catheter preparation. Nature Precedings March 29 http://www.figshare.com/articles/Cocaine_self-administration_in_the_mouse:_A_low-_cost,_chronic_catheter_preparation/91521&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reinforcement schedules===

Continuous reinforcement: A single operant response triggers the dispense of a single dose of reinforcer.  A time-out period may follow each operant response that successfully yields a dose of reinforcer; during this period the lever used in training may be retracted preventing the animal from making further responses. Alternatively operant responses will fail to produce drug administration allowing previous injections to take effect.  Moreover, time-outs also help prevent subjects from overdosing during self-administration experiments.   
Fixed-ratio studies require a predefined number of operant responses to dispense one unit of reinforcer. Standard fixed ratio reinforcement schedules include FR5 and FR10, requiring 5 and 10 operant responses to dispense a unit of reinforcer, respectively.
Progressive ratio reinforcement schedules utilize a multiplicative increase in the number of operant responses required to dispense a unit of reinforcer. For example, successive trials might require 5 operant responses per unit of reward, then 10 responses per unit of reward, then 15, and so on.  The number of operant responses required per unit of reinforcer may be altered after each trial, each session, or any other time period as defined by the experimenter. Progressive ratio reinforcement schedules provide information about the extent that a pharmacological agent is reinforcing through the breakpoint.  The breakpoint is the number of operant responses at which the subject ceases engaging in self-administration, defined by some period of time between operant responses (generally up to an hour).
Fixed interval (FI) schedules require that a set amount of time pass between drug infusions, regardless of the number of times that the desired response is performed. This “refractory” period can prevent the animal from overdosing on a drug.
Variable interval (VI) schedules of reinforcement are identical to FI schedules, except that the amount of time between reinforced operant responses varies, making it more difficult for the animal to predict when the drug will be delivered.

Second-order reinforcement schedules build on basic reinforcement schedules by introducing a conditioned stimulus that has previously been paired with the reinforcer (such as the illumination of a light). Second-order schedules are built from two simpler schedules; completion of the first schedule results in the presentation of an abbreviated version conditioned stimulus, following completion of a fixed-interval, the drug is delivered, alongside the full-length conditioned stimulus. Second-order schedules result in a very high rate of operant responding at the presentation of the conditioned reinforcer becomes a reinforcing in its own right. Benefits of this schedule include the ability to investigate the motivation to seek the drug, without interference of the drug's own pharmacological effects, maintaining a high level of responding with relatively few drug infusions, reduced risk of self-administered overdose, and external validity to human populations where environmental context can provide a strong reinforcing effect for drug use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Everitt B.J. |author2=Robbins T.W. | year = 2000 | title = Second-order schedules of drug reinforcement in rats and monkeys: measurement of reinforcing efficacy and drug-seeking behaviour | url = | journal = Psychopharmacology | volume = 153 | issue = | pages = 17–30 | doi=10.1007/s002130000566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extinction and reinstatement===

Extinction involves the discontinuation of a particular reinforcer in response to operant behavior, such as replacing a reinforcing drug infusion with a saline vehicle. When the reinforcing element of the operant paradigm is no longer present, a gradual reduction in operant responses results in eventual cessation or “extinction” of the operant behavior.
Reinstatement is the restoration of operant behavior to acquire a reinforcer, often triggered by external events/cues or exposure to the original reinforcer itself. Reinstatement can be broken into a few broad categories:

Drug-induced reinstatement: exposure to a reinforcing drug after extinction of drug-seeking operant behavior can often reinstate drug-seeking, and can even occur when the new drug of exposure is different from the original reinforcer. This is thought to be strongly linked to '''drug sensitization''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 9824469 | volume=10 | issue=11 | title=Drug-induced reinstatement of heroin- and cocaine-seeking behaviour following long-term extinction is associated with expression of behavioural sensitization | date=November 1998 |vauthors=De Vries TJ, Schoffelmeer AN, Binnekade R, Mulder AH, Vanderschuren LJ | journal=Eur. J. Neurosci. | pages=3565–71 | doi=10.1046/j.1460-9568.1998.00368.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cue-induced reinstatement: environmental cues associated with drug administration can trigger drug reinstatement by acting as conditioned stimuli, even during drug abstinence &lt;ref&gt;Buccafusco J.J. &amp; Shuster L. (Eds.) (2009). Methods of Behavior Analysis in Neuroscience (2nd ed.) Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press&lt;/ref&gt;

1. Environmental surroundings as well as drug-associated behavior or actions can function as environmental cues.

2. Stress-induced reinstatement: in many cases, a stressor can reinstate drug-seeking in a drug-abstinent animal. This can include (but is not limited to) acute stressors such as foot-shock or social defeat stress. In many cases, it appears that social stress can potentiate drug reinstatement just as strongly as exposure to the drug itself &lt;ref&gt;Crombag HS, Bossert JM, Koya E, Shaham Y (2008) Review: Context-induced relapse to drug seeking: a review. Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci, 2008 Oct 12;363(1507):3233-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

(2012). Cocaine self-administration in the mouse: A low- cost, chronic catheter preparation. Nature Precedings March 29 http://www.neuro-cloud.net/nature-precedings/pomrenze&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Animal self-administration experiments are typically performed in standard operant conditioning chambers adapted for the catheters used to deliver a drug intravenously. The catheter is secured to the animal by a harness or back plate and is tethered to a protective leash that extends upward through a hole in the top of a chamber, where it attaches to a rotating swivel on a mechanical arm that allows the subject to move around freely. The chamber houses two levers: one whose depression results in the delivery of a drug, the other whose depression does nothing. Activity on these levers can be used to measure drug administration (via activity at the drug-inducing lever) as well as changes in nonspecific behavior that reflect short- and long-term effects of the drug (via activity at the non-inducing lever). The sterile intravenous catheter used to deliver the drug into the bloodstream of the subject is typically composed of a flexible plastic, silastic tubing and nylon mesh placed subcutaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Pomrenze M, Baratta, V. M, Cadle, B., Cooper, D.C. (2012). Cocaine self-administration in the mouse: A low- cost, chronic catheter preparation. Nature Precedings March 29 http://www.figshare.com/articles/Cocaine_self-administration_in_the_mouse:_A_low-_cost,_chronic_catheter_preparation/91521&lt;/ref&gt;  It is attached to a mechanical pump that can be calibrated to deliver a specific amount of drug upon depression of one of the levers in the chamber.
Other chamber modifications are required if the drug is to be delivered orally or via inhalation, such as liquid containers or an aerosol distribution mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;Adriani, W., Macri, S., Pacifici, R., &amp; Laviola, G.

==Significant findings==

Self-administration studies have long been considered the “standard” in addiction research using both animal and human models.
Conducting self-administration studies in animal models provides a much greater level of experimental flexibility than in humans because investigating the effects of novel pharmacological drug treatments poses significantly fewer ethical and practical barriers.   In 1999, Pilla and colleagues published in Nature a study documenting the efficacy of a partial D3-agonist (BP-897) in reducing environmental cue-induced cocaine craving and vulnerability to relapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Pilla M. |author2=Perachon S. |author3=Sautel F. |author4=Garrido F. |author5=Mann A. |author6=Wermuth C. G. | year = 1999 | title = Selective inhibition of cocaine-seeking behaviour by a partial dopamine D3 receptor agonist. |doi=10.1038/22560 | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 400 | issue = 6742| pages = 371–375 |display-authors=etal | pmid=10432116}}&lt;/ref&gt;   An interesting aspect of this study was the use of second-order reinforcement schedules to identify a dissociation in the effects of BP-897 in that the drug inhibits cue-induced cocaine seeking but has no primary reinforcement effect.  This latter condition is important for any pharmacological agent to be used in the treatment of addiction—drugs used to treat addiction should be less reinforcing than the drug whose addiction they treat and optimally have no reinforcing effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Koob G.

[[File:MiR-212 regulates cocaine intake.jpg|thumb|left|400px]]

A recent study published in Nature showed an upregulation of microRNA-212 in the dorsal striatum of rats previously exposed to cocaine for extended periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hollander J. A. |author2=Im H.-I. |author3=Amelio A. L. |author4=Kocerha J. |author5=Bali P. |author6=Lu Q. | year = 2010 | title = Striatal microRNA controls cocaine intake through CREB signalling.| journal = Nature | volume = 466 | issue = 7303| pages = 197–202 | doi=10.1038/nature09202|display-authors=etal | pmid=20613834 | pmc=2916751}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Animals infected with a viral vector overexpressing miR-212 in the dorsal striatum produced the same initial levels of cocaine intake; however, drug consumption progressively decreased as net cocaine exposure increased.  The authors of the study noted that viral-infected animals exhibited decreased operant responding during the post-infusion time-out period and proposed that this demonstrated a reduction in compulsive drug-seeking behavior.(Hollander ''et al.'')  miR-212 acts through Raf1 to enhance the CREB response; CREB-TORC is known to negatively regulate the reinforcing effects of cocaine. (Hollander ''et al.'') This study provides one example (miR-212, owing to its amplification of CREB) of a self-administration study that may provide potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of cocaine addiction.
One of the most important advances to emerge from self-administration studies comes from a behavioral model for addiction in animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Deroche-Gamonet V. |author2=Belin D. |author3=Piazza P. V. | year = 2004 | title = Evidence for addiction-like behavior in the rat | url = | journal = Science | volume = 305 | issue = 5686| pages = 1014–1017 | doi=10.1126/science.1099020}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This model relies on observation of three separate phenomena to classify a rat as “addicted:”
1)      '''Persistence in drug-seeking''': Depends on the attempts of rats to obtain drug during time-out or no-periods in the self-administration apparatus.
2)      '''Resistance to punishment''': Measured by how much rats maintain rates of self-administration when cocaine infusion is paired with an electric shock.
3)      '''Motivation for the drug''': Measured by the breakpoint in progressive ratio reinforcement. (Deroche-Gamonet et al.)

The researchers used an additional test to further support classification of a rat as “addicted” by measuring relapse rates during reinstatement paradigms.  Human drug addicts reportedly relapse at a rate of &gt;90% as measured from the initial diagnosis.  Rats that responded at high rates after some form of cue-induced reinstatement could be considered likely to relapse.(Deroche-Gamonet et al.)  This model provided an important advancement for the method of self-administration because it allows animal models to better approximate the physiological and behavioral aspects of drug addiction in humans.

Self-administration experiments can also be paired with methods such as in vitro electrophysiology or molecular biology to understand the effects of addiction on neural circuitry.  Self-administration studies have allowed researchers to locate a staggering number of changes in brain signaling that occur in addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lüscher C. |author2=Malenka Robert C. | year = 2011 | title = Drug-Evoked Synaptic Plasticity in Addiction: From Molecular Changes to Circuit Remodeling | journal = Neuron | volume = 69 | issue = 4| pages = 650–663 | doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2011.01.017 | pmid=21338877 | pmc=4046255}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of such a study involved examining synaptic plasticity in rats undergoing the behavioral shift to addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kasanetz F. |author2=Deroche-Gamonet V. |author3=Berson N. |author4=Balado E. |author5=Lafourcade M. |author6=Manzoni O. | year = 2010 | title = Transition to addiction is associated with a persistent impairment in synaptic plasticity | url = | journal = Science | volume = 328 | issue = 5986| pages = 1709–1712 | doi=10.1126/science.1187801|display-authors=etal | pmid=20576893}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the criteria for classifying rats as “addicts” or “non-addicts” as put forth by Deroche-Gamonet et al.,  it was found that addicted rats display a prolonged and persistent impairment in mGluR2/3-dependent Long-Term Depression.  Despite exposure to the same self-administration paradigm, control rats recovered this form of synaptic plasticity.  The authors of the study propose an important explanation for their results in that this specific loss of plasticity over an extended period  is responsible for the progressive loss of controlled drug use.(Kasanetz et al.) This represents a potential molecular mechanism by which addicts might differ from non-addicts and undergo pathological learning processes during the development of addiction.

Much like animal studies, human experiments that pair self-administration studies with additional neuroscientific techniques provide unique insight into the disease of addiction.  Human self-administration studies have gained momentum with the widespread use of fMRI technology to measure BOLD signals.   Brain imaging coupled with human self-administration studies with the laboratory have led to the development of a three-stage model of human neurocircuitry of addiction: Binge/Intoxication, Preoccupation/Anticipation, and Withdrawal/Negative Effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Koob G. F. |author2=Volkow N. D. | year = 2009 | title = Neurocircuitry of Addiction | url = | journal = Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages = 217–238 | doi=10.1038/npp.2009.110 | pmid=19710631 | pmc=2805560}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Koob, Lloyd, and Mason reviewed the laboratory models approximating each stage of the model of human addiction.(Koob et al.) The binge-intoxication phase traditionally has been modeled by drug or alcohol self-administration; the psychological effects of addiction might be modeled by the increased motivation for self-administration observed in drug-dependent animals.  Self-administration studies capably model the somatic effects of addiction, but many of the most deleterious effects related to drug addiction can be considered psychological in nature. (Koob et al.)  Models like the one published by Deroche-Gamonet and colleagues in 2004 better approximate the effects of addiction on physiology and psychology, but animal models are inherently limited in their ability to reproduce human behavior.

The use of the self-administration methodology to model human drug addiction provides powerful insight into the physiological and behavioral effects of the disease.  While self-administration experiments in humans or animals each pose unique barriers to complete understanding of addiction, the scientific community continues to invest a great deal of effort in both avenues of research in the hopes of improving understanding and treatment of addiction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1476">The '''Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Pakistan''' ('''SOGP''') is a professional medical association formed by practitioners of [[obstetrics]] and [[gynecology]] in [[Pakistan]]. A member of the [[International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics]] (FIGO), the body was established in 1957 and is among the oldest specialist professional bodies. When Prof. H.Dewattleville, the President of FIGO at that time, visited [[Karachi]], he addressed staff and students at the [[Dow Medical College]] and members of the Pakistan Medical Council (now [[Pakistan Medical and Dental Council]]) and stressed the need for such an organisation in the country. The first constitution of the organisation was signed and published by the [[Journal of Pakistan Medical Association]] in June 1957.&lt;ref&gt;http://sogp.org/brief_history&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, it is the largest and most prominent organisation of obstetricians and gynaecologists in the country. SOGP is also a member of the South Asia Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (SAFOG) and works in close collaboration with other national medical committees around the world. In 1997, Pakistan was also elected to the Executive Board of FIGO.

'''Periodization''' is the systematic planning of [[physical training|athletic or physical training]].&lt;ref name=Rowbottom&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowbottom|first=David J.|editor1-first=William E.|editor1-last=Garrett|editor2-first=Donald T.|editor2-last=Kirkendall|title=Periodization of Training|year=2000|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780683034219|page=499|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cx22TcXodrwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=April 20, 2013|chapter=Periodization of Training|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cx22TcXodrwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA499#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim is to reach the best possible performance in the most important competition of the year.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnd Krüger]] (1973). Periodization or Peaking at the right time, in: Track Technique 54 (1973), pp.1720- 1724&lt;/ref&gt; It involves progressive cycling of various aspects of a training program during a specific period. Conditioning programs can use periodization to break up the training program into the off-season, preseason, inseason, and the postseason. Periodization divides the year round condition program into phases of training which focus on different goals.

==History==
The roots of periodization come from [[Hans Selye]]’s model, known as the [[General adaptation syndrome]]
The GAS describes three basic stages of response to stress: (a) the Alarm stage, involving the initial shock of the stimulus on the system, (b) the Resistance stage, involving the adaptation to the stimulus by the system, and (c) the Exhaustion stage, in that repairs are inadequate, and a decrease in system function results. The foundation of periodic training is keeping one's body in the resistance stage without ever going into the exhaustion stage.  By adhering to cyclic training the body is given adequate time to recover from significant stress before additional training is undertaken. The response to a new stress is to first respond poorly and the response drops off. For example when the body is first exposed to sun a sunburn might develop. During the resistance stage adaptation improves the response to a higher level, called super compensation, than the previous equilibrium. The example would be that a suntan develops. The exhaustion stage is a continuation of the stimulus at too high a level and the increase gained from adaptation is now offset and all gains are lost. The example would be that wrinkles, spots, or even skin cancer develop. The goal in sports periodization is to reduce the stress at the point where the resistance stage ends so the body has time to recover. In this way the exhaustion stage does not reduce the gains achieved, the body can recover and remain above the original equilibrium point. The next cycle of increased stimulus now improves the response further and the equilibrium point continues to rise after each cycle.

Selye (1957) labeled beneficial stresses as "[[eustress]]" and detrimental stresses as "distress". In athletics, when physical stress is at a healthy level (eustress), an athlete experiences muscular strength and growth, while excessive physical stress (distress) can lead to tissue damage, disease, and death. Periodization is most widely used in resistance program design to avoid over-training and to systematically alternate high loads of training with decreased loading phases to improve components of muscular fitness (e.g. strength, strength-speed, and strength-endurance). The Selye-cycles are similar to the "micro cycles" used at later times.

[[Russia]]n [[physiologist]] [[Leo Matveyev]] and Romanian sport scientist [[Tudor Bompa]] expanded and further organized the periodization model. Matveyev has been regarded as the father of modern periodization. He analysed the results of the Soviet athletes of the 1952 and 1956 summer Olympics and compared successful and not so successful athletes and their training schedules. From these training plans periodized schedules were developed for the 1960 Olympics. With the success of the Soviet athletes, Matveyev's plans were spread all over the Eastern  Bloc in their annual coordination meetings. From there it also spread to Romania, where [[Tudor Bompa]] developed the system further. In the 1968 it was used for the first time in the GDR and in 1972 in West Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnd Krüger]]. Nachwort zum neusten Stand der Literatur zur Periodisierung, in: L. P. MATWEJEW: Periodisierung des sportlichen Trainings. Berlin: Bartels &amp; Wernitz 1972, 201 - 231 (2. Aufl. 1978). Also basis for the French translation: Postface.La base de l'entraînement.Paris: Vigot 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the Soviet Union, periodization started to become modified. While Matveyev followed Pavlov{{which|date=May 2016}} and assumed that everybody should use the same periodization, individualised systems, using more and more biological data, were introduced.&lt;ref&gt;V.I. PLATONOV: General theory of training of athletes in Olympic sports. Kiew: Olympic Books, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Periodic training systems typically divide time up into three types of cycles: microcycle, mesocycle, and macrocycle. The microcycle is generally up to 7 days. The mesocycle may be anywhere from 2 weeks to a few months, but is typically a month. A macrocycle refers to the overall training period, usually representing a year or two. There are longer cycles as well for the Olympian, being 4 or 8 years, and the career plan which is usually only considered for Olympians and professional athletes.

==Theory of planning==
Training should be organized and planned in advance of a competition or performance.
It should consider the [[sportsperson|athlete]]’s potential, his/her performance in tests or [[competition]], and calendar of competition. It has to be simple, suggestive, and above all flexible as its content can be modified to meet the athletes rate of progress.

===The macrocycle===
A [[macrocycle]] is an annual plan that works towards peaking for the goal competition of the year. There are three phases in the macrocycle: preparation, competitive, and transition.&lt;ref name=zfw-periodization&gt;{{cite web|title=Periodisation in fencing|url=http://zfw-fencing.co.uk/articles/periodisation-fencing|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire preparation phase should be around 2/3 to 3/4 of the macrocycle. The preparation phase is further broken up into general and specific preparation of which general preparation takes over half. An example of general preparation would be building an [[Aerobic exercise|aerobic base]] for an [[Endurance sports|endurance athlete]] such as running on a [[treadmill]] and learning any rules or regulations that would be required such as proper [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]] stroke as not to be disqualified. An example of specific preparation would be to work on the proper form to be more efficient and to work more on the final format of the sport, which is to move from the treadmill to the [[Road surface|pavement]].

The competitive phase can be several competitions, but they lead up to the main competition with specific tests. Testing might include any of the following: performance level, new shoes or gear, a new race tactic might be employed, pre-race meals, ways to reduce [[anxiety]] before a race, or the length needed for the taper. When the pre-competitions are of a higher priority there is a definite taper stage while lower priority might simply be integrated in as training. The competitive phase ends with the taper and the competition.

The transition phase is important for [[Psychology|psychological]] reasons, a year of training means a vacation is in order. A typical [[wikt:weekend warrior|weekend warrior]] might take three months while a professional athlete might take as little as two weeks.

===The mesocycle===
A mesocycle represents a phase of training with a duration of between 2 – 6 weeks or microcycles, but this can depend on the sporting discipline.&lt;ref name=zfw-periodization/&gt; A mesocycle can also be defined as a number of continuous weeks where the training program emphasize the same type of physical adaptations, for example muscle mass and anaerobic capacity. During the preparatory phase, a mesocycle commonly consists of 4 – 6 micro-cycles, while during the competitive phase it will usually consist of 2 – 4 micro-cycles depending on the competition’s [[calendar]].

The goal of the plan is to fit the mesocycles into the overall plan timeline-wise to make each mesocycle end on one of the phases and then to determine the [[workload]] and type of work of each cycle based on where in the overall plan the given mesocycle falls. The goal in mind is to make sure the body peaks for the high priority competitions by improving each cycle along the way.

===The microcycle===
A microcycle is typically a week because of the difficulty in developing a training plan that does not align itself with the weekly calendar. Each microcycle is planned based on where it is in the overall macrocycle.&lt;ref name=zfw-periodization/&gt;

A micro-cycle is also defined as a number of training sessions, built around a given combination of acute program variables, which include progression as well as alternating effort (heavy vs. light days). The length of the micro-cycle should correspond to the number of workouts - empirically often 4-16 workouts - it takes for the athlete or fitness client to adapt to the training program. When the athlete or fitness client has adapted to the program and no longer makes progress, a change to one or more program variables should be made.

==The annual plan==
The annual plan is important in that it directs and guides performance training over a year. It is based on the concept of [[periodization]] and the principles of training. The objective of training is to reach a high level of performance (peak performance) and an athlete has to develop skills, biomotor abilities and psychological traits in a methodical manner.

===Preparatory phase===
This phase consists of the general preparation and specific preparation. Usually which can be subdivided into three different phases. One should always remember that this is a base creation phase with the objective to attain the previous training state, and the longest period of periodization must be devoted towards the preparatory period.
The performance depends on preparatory period, and is divided into '''three''' phases:

'''Phase  I)''' To regain previous training 
*Low volume, but maintaining high intensity is there.
*competitions.

'''Phase II)''' Low training volume &amp; High training load to develop the factors needed for performance.
*works on specific exercise. 
'''Phase III)''' Decrease in the intensity of load and increase in tactical training and aim at improving tactical under competition condition.
{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Competitive phase===
This phase may contain a few main competitions each containing a pre-competitive and a main competition. Within the main competition, an uploading phase and a special preparatory phase may be included. This also includes hypertropthy

===Transition phase===
This phase is used to facilitate psychological rest, relaxation and biological regeneration as well as to maintain an acceptable level of general physical preparation. This phase lasts 3–4 weeks (perhaps longer) but should not exceed five weeks under normal conditions and may be sports specific. It allows the body to fully regenerate so that it is prepared for the next discipline.
*there is no competition in this phase.

===Opposition to Periodization===
A review published in the journal 'sports medicine' in 2017 has questioned the validity of the use of traditional models of periodization in sport. This is largely due to the over simplified assumptions put forward in the early development of periodization theory that are not always transferable to the psyco-biological effects of various training methods used in sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1007/s40279-017-0823-y| pmid=29189930| pmc=5856877|title = Periodization Theory: Confronting an Inconvenient Truth| journal=Sports Medicine| volume=48| issue=4| pages=753–764|year = 2018|last1 = Kiely|first1 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tactical Periodization ==

For many years, football training and its planning has been (and still is) characterised by fragmented thinking of which has perhaps been attributed to the success of such an approach in individual sports. The emphasis of planning and improvement was mainly in regards to the physical attributes of strength, speed and endurance.&lt;ref&gt;Carvalhal, C. (2014). ‘Soccer: Developing A Know-how’,  Prime Books&lt;/ref&gt; Furtheremore, whether it be the undulating model, the reverse linear model or the traditional periodization framework, one of the underpinning assumptions is that it would be best to segregate the programme into distinct training blocks in a sequential hierarchy i.e. a training block to build endurance before speed and strength before power. This is claimed to be based on the ‘science of periodization’. However, Kiely,&lt;ref&gt;Kiely, J. (2010). ‘Periodization, planning, prediction: And why the future ain’t what it used to be!’, UKA, 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the proof on which this is all based on is flawed because the studies used to build this proof have only ‘compared training interventions with no training variation to those with degrees of variation’  but did not offer any insight ‘into how that variation is best scheduled and organised’ (Kiely, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;4). So although it is commonly agreed that training variation is an important design feature which needs to be integrated into the training plan, there is ‘little or no supporting evidence’ which proves that the segregation of the program into distinct training blocks or that there should be sequential hierarchy of how this should be done is in fact advantageous.

Many authors such as Garganta, Maia, &amp; Marque,&lt;ref&gt;Garganta, J., Maia, J. &amp; Marques, A. (1996). ‘Acerca da investigação dos factores de rendimento em futebol’, Revista paulista de educação física, São Paulo, 10, (2), 146-158.&lt;/ref&gt; Oliviera,&lt;ref&gt;Oliveira, G.J. (1991). ‘Especificidade, o pós-futebol do pré-futebol. Um factor condicionante do alto rendimento desportivo. In Oliveira, R. (2014) ‘Tactical periodization: The secrets of soccer most effective training methodology’.&lt;/ref&gt; Castelo,&lt;ref&gt;Castelo, J. (2000). ‘Formação continua. O treinador de futebol. Exercícios de treino no futebol’, Escola superior de desporto de Rio Maior. IPS.&lt;/ref&gt; and Gaiteiro &lt;ref&gt;Gaiteiro, B. (2006). ‘A cienca oculta do sucesso! Mourinho aos olhos da cienca’. In Tamarit, X. (2014). ‘What is tactical periodization?’ Bennion Kearny Limited.&lt;/ref&gt; have argued in regards to the indivisibility of the 4 components which make up a football performance...technical, tactical, physical and mental. This complexity makes football a multidimensional phenomenon which cannot be simply reduced to the sum of its parts. Is defending more important than attacking or vice versa? This question cannot be answered as football needs to be understood as a whole. As highlighted by Tamarit,&lt;ref&gt;Tamarit, X. (2014). ‘What is tactical periodization?’  Bennion Kearny Limited.&lt;/ref&gt; football is a tactical game where players are constantly required to make decisions in response to specific situations. So football needs to be viewed as a tactical game which encompasses with it the physical, technical and mental aspects required for positive performances.  This is the foundation upon which Victor Frade developed a training methodology known as tactical periodisation which emphasises the development of the tactical dimension. Therefore, any physical, technical or mental development must always have a tactical intention. In other words, although the ability to run for 90 minutes may seem vital to play the game, knowing when, where and how to run is much more important.

'''Taunton State Hospital''' is a [[psychiatric hospital]] located on Hodges Avenue 
in [[Taunton, Massachusetts]]. Established in 1854, it was originally known as the '''State Lunatic Hospital at Taunton'''. It was the second state asylum in Massachusetts. Most of the original part of the facility was built in a unique and rare neo-classical style designed by architects [[Boyden &amp; Ball]]. It is also a [[Kirkbride Plan]] hospital and is located on a large {{convert|154|acre|adj=on}} farm along the [[Mill River (Taunton River)|Mill River]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tauntongazette.com/news/x430730654/Taunton-State-Hospital-offers-years-of-service-and-healing Taunton Daily Gazette, January 29, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

The complex was expanded at various times to include over forty buildings and structures. The main part of the hospital (known as "the Kirkbride Building") closed in 1975, and the buildings fell into disrepair.  In 1994, the property was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as a historic district.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/ma/Bristol/districts.html MASSACHUSETTS - Bristol County - Historic Districts]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the main dome of the administration building collapsed. In 2006, a large part of the historic complex was destroyed by fire. In 2009, the remaining parts were demolished. However, many of the newer buildings on the campus remain.

==History==
In 1851, the [[Massachusetts General Court]] appointed a commission to find a site for a new asylum to relieve the pressure of a rising patient population from its only facility in [[Worcester State Hospital|Worcester]]. The new  at Taunton opened in April 1854. The large sprawling campus located on a hill offered fresh air and sunlight, following [[Thomas Story Kirkbride|Kirkbride's]] concept for treating mental health patients. The complex was expanded in the early 1870s and again between 1887 and 1906. From the 1930s, juvenile facilities, crisis centers, sick wards, and group homes were added.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tauntongazette.com/news/x430730654/Taunton-State-Hospital-offers-years-of-service-and-healing Taunton Daily Gazette, January 29, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the building's most beautiful features was its breezeways, which were added in the 1890s to connect the end of the wards to the hospital's infirmary buildings. Its distinct cupolas, large dome, cast-iron capitals, and window bar gave this building its own very unusual personality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kirkbridebuildings.com/buildings/taunton/ Kirkbride Buildings]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, the main part of the hospital was closed and abandoned. In 1999, the large dome which towered over the hospital's administration building collapsed. Then on the night of March 19, 2006, a massive fire broke out in the center of the building, which included the administration and theater. Sections damaged by fire were then leveled, leaving only the decaying wings of the Kirkbride Building.

In May 2009, demolition of the remaining historic sections of the Kirkbride Building began. The facility had numerous architectural features that were salvaged and sold to individuals and companies throughout the United States, including architectural granite, bricks, timbers, iron gates, vintage plumbing and lighting fixtures, furniture, and slate roofing tiles. The project was completed in early 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.costellodismantling.com/pages/cfProjects_Details.cfm?ProjectID=30 Costello Dismantling Company]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable patients==
*[[Thomas Hubbard Sumner]], a sea captain known for developing the celestial navigation method known as the 'Sumner line' or [[line of position]].
*[[Jane Toppan]], a sociopathic serial killer.
*[[Lizzie Borden]] often talked about being held in the asylum. However, she was never admitted and is only known as being held in the jail, which was on Hodges Ave near the hospital, during the trial.

==Recent history==
In the early 1990s, a $19 million capital improvement plan was implemented by the state to improve the still-operating portions of the campus. In early 2012, the state announced the closure of the remaining parts of the facility containing 169 beds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tauntongazette.com/news/x430730654/Taunton-State-Hospital-offers-years-of-service-and-healing Taunton Daily Gazette, January 29, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; A plan to keep a portion of the facility open was vetoed by Governor [[Deval Patrick]] in July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/metrodesk/2012/07/08/gov-deval-patrick-signs-million-budget-moves-close-taunton-state-hospital/IDkcbYmftD80TroSJeE5xK/story.html Gov. Deval Patrick signs $32.5 billion budget, moves to close Taunton State Hospital]&lt;/ref&gt;

Taunton State Hospital remains open and houses 48 psychiatric beds, the Women's Recovery from Addiction Program, a residential program under the Department of Youth Services, and a substance abuse program administered by High Point Treatment Center.  There is also a greenhouse on the campus that is staffed by patients and sells a variety of plants and seasonal produce to the public.

&lt;/ref&gt;) is the delivery of [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] services over [[telecommunication network]]s and the internet. Most types of [[Service (economics)|services]] fall into two categories: clinical assessment (the patient's functional abilities in his or her environment), and [[medical therapy|clinical therapy]]. Some fields of rehabilitation practice that have explored telerehabilitation are: [[neuropsychology]], [[speech-language pathology]], [[audiology]], [[occupational therapy]], and [[physical therapy]]. Telerehabilitation can deliver therapy to people who cannot travel to a [[clinic]] because the patient has a [[disability]] or because of travel time. Telerehabilitation also allows experts in rehabilitation to engage in a clinical consultation at a distance.

Most telerehabilitation is highly visual. As of 2006 the most commonly used modalities are via [[webcam]]s, [[videoconferencing]], [[phone line]]s, [[videophone]]s and webpages containing [[rich Internet applications]]. The visual nature of telerehabilitation technology limits the types of rehabilitation services that can be provided. It is most widely used for [[neuropsychological rehabilitation]]; fitting of rehabilitation equipment such as [[wheelchair]]s, [[Brace (orthopaedic)|braces]] or [[artificial limb]]s; and in speech-language pathology. Rich internet applications for neuropsychological rehabilitation (aka [[cognitive rehabilitation]]) of cognitive impairment (from many etiologies) was first introduced in 2001. This endeavor has recently (2006) expanded as a [[teletherapy]] application for cognitive skills enhancement programs for school children. [[Tele-audiology]] (hearing assessments) is a growing application. As of 2006, telerehabilitation in the practice of occupational therapy and physical therapy are very limited, perhaps because these two disciplines are more "hands on".

Two important areas of telerehabilitation research are (1) demonstrating equivalence of assessment and therapy to in-person assessment and therapy, and (2) building new data collection systems to digitize information that a therapist can use in practice. Ground-breaking research in [[telehaptics]] (the sense of touch) and virtual reality may broaden the scope of telerehabilitation practice, in the future.

In the United States, the [[National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research]]'s (NIDRR)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/nidrr/index.html?src=mr National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031011114426/http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/nidrr/index.html?src=mr |date=2003-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; supports research and the development of telerehabilitation. NIDRR's grantees include the "Rehabilitation Engineering and Research Center" (RERC) at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], the [[Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago]], the State University of New York at Buffalo, and the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Washington DC. Other federal funders of research are the Veterans Administration, the Health Services Research Administration in the US Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Defense. Outside the United States, excellent research is conducted in Australia and Europe.

As of 2006, only a few health insurers in the United States will [[reimburse]] for telerehabilitation services. If the research shows that [[tele-assessment]]s and [[tele-therapy]] are equivalent to clinical encounters, it is more likely that [[insurer]]s and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] will cover telerehabilitation services.

==History==
In 1999, D.M. Angaran published "Telemedicine and Telepharmacy: Current Status and Future Implications" in the [[American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy]]. He provided a comprehensive history of [[telecommunications]], the [[internet]] and [[telemedicine]] since the 1950s. The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD) and the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) spearheaded the technology in the [[United States]] during the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[space program]]; both agencies continue to fund advances in telemedicine.

Three early adopters of telemedicine were [[state penitentiary system]]s, [[rural health care system]]s, and the [[radiology]] profession. Telemedicine makes business sense for the states because they do not have to pay for security escorts to have a [[prison]]er receive care outside the prison.

Rural telemedicine in the United States is heavily subsidized through federal agency [[Grant (money)|grants]] for telecommunications operations. Most of this funding comes through the [[Health Services Research Administration]] and the [[Department of Commerce]]. Some state [[universities]] have obtained state funding to operate [[tele-clinic]]s in rural areas. As of 2006, few (if any) of these programs are known to financially break-even, mostly because the Medicare program for people over age 65 (the largest payer) is very restrictive about paying for telehealth.

In contrast, the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] is relatively active in using telemedicine for people with disabilities. There are several programs that provide annual physical exams or monitoring and consultation for veterans with spinal cord injuries. Similarly, some state [[Medicaid]] programs (for poor people and people with disabilities) have pilot programs using telecommunications to connect rural practitioners with subspecialty therapists. A few [[school district]]s in [[Oklahoma]] and [[Hawaii]] offer school-based rehabilitation therapy using therapy assistants who are directed by a remote therapist. The [[MedStar National Rehabilitation Hospital|National Rehabilitation Hospital]] in [[Washington DC]] and [[Sister Kenny Rehabilitation Institute]] in [[Minneapolis]] provided assessment and evaluations to patients living in [[Guam]] and [[American Samoa]]. Cases included post-[[stroke]], post-[[polio]], [[autism]], and wheel-chair fitting.

An argument can be made that "telerehabilitation" began in 1998 when NIDRR funded the first RERC on tele-rehabilitation. It was awarded to a consortium of biomedical engineering departments at the National Rehabilitation Hospital and [[The Catholic University of America]], both located in Washington, DC; the Sister Kenny Rehabilitation Institute in Minnesota; and the [[East Carolina University]] in [[North Carolina]]. Some of this early research work, and its motivation, is reviewed in Winters (2002). The [[State of Science Conference]] held in 2002 convened most of military and civilian clinicians, engineers, and government officials interested in using telecommunications as a modality for rehabilitation assessment and therapy; a summary is provided in Rosen, Winters &amp; Lauderdale (2002). The conference was attended by the incoming president of the [[American Telemedicine Association]] (ATA). This led to an invitation by ATA to the conference attendees to form a special interest group on telerehabilitation. NIDRR funded the second 5-year RERC on telerehabilitation in 2004, awarding it to the University of Pittsburgh. This RERC was renewed in 2010.

In 2001, O. Bracy, a neuropsychologist, introduced the first web based, rich internet application, for the telerehabilitation presentation of cognitive rehabilitation therapy. This system first provides the subscriber clinician with an economical means of treating their own patients over the internet. Secondly, the system then provides, directly to the patient, the therapy prescription set up and controlled by the member clinician. All applications and response data are transported via the internet in real time. The patient can login to do their therapy from home, the library or anywhere they have access to an internet computer. In 2006, this system formed the basis of a new system designed as a cognitive skills enhancement program for school children. Individual children or whole classrooms can participate in this program over the internet.

In 2006, M.J. McCue and S.E. Palsbo published an article in the [[Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare]] that explored how telemedicine can become a profitable business for hospitals. They argue that telerehabilitation should be expanded so that people with disabilities and people in pain (perhaps after [[hip-replacement surgery]] or people with [[arthritis]]) can get the rehabilitative therapy they need. It is unethical to limit paymente for telerehabilitation services only to patients in rural areas.

Research in telerehabilitation is in its infancy, with only a handful of equivalence trials. As of 2006, most peer-reviewed research in telemedicine are case reports of pilot programs or new equipment. Rehabilitation researchers need to conduct many more controlled experiments and present the evidence to clinicians (and payers) that telerehabilitation is clinically effective. The discipline of speech-language pathology is far head of occupational therapy and physical therapy in demonstrating equivalence over various types of telecommunications equipment.

== Technologies ==

# [[Plain old telephone service]] (POTS) with [[videophone]]s/phones in telerehabilitation
#: There are several types of connections used with real time exchanges. Plain old telephone service (POTS) uses standard [[analog transmission|analog]] [[telephone line]]s. Videophones are used with POTS lines and include a [[camera]], [[Display device|display screen]], and [[telephone]]. Videophones use telephone lines that are available in most homes, so are easy to set up; however small display screens make them problematic for individuals with vision problems. This can be solved by using a large screen or [[television]] as a screen.

===Speech-language pathology===
The clinical services provided by speech-language pathology readily lend themselves to telerehabilitation applications due to the emphasis on auditory and visual communicative interaction between the client and the clinician. As a result, the number of telerehabilitation applications in speech-language pathology tend to outnumber those in other allied health professions. To date, applications have been developed to assess and/or treat acquired adult [[speech and language disorders]], [[stuttering]], [[voice disorders]], speech disorders in children, and [[swallowing dysfunction]]. The technology involved in these applications has ranged from the simple telephone (Plain Old Telephone System – POTS) to the use of dedicated Internet-based videoconferencing systems.

Early applications to assess and treat acquired adult speech and language disorders involved the use of the telephone to treat patients with aphasia and motor speech disorders (Vaughan, 1976, Wertz, et al., 1987), a computer controlled video [[laserdisc]] over the telephone and a [[closed-circuit television|closed-circuit]] television system to assess speech and language disorders (Wertz et al., 1987), and a satellite-based videoconferencing system to assess patients in rural areas (Duffy, Werven &amp; Aronson, 1997). More recent applications have involved the use of sophisticated Internet-based videoconferencing systems with dedicated [[software]] which enable the assessment of language disorders (Georgeadis, Brennan, Barker, &amp; Baron, 2004, Brennan, Georgeadis, Baron &amp; Barker, 2004) and the assessment and treatment of motor speech disorders (Hill, Theodoros, Russell, Cahill, Ward, Clark, 2006; Theodoros, Constantinescu, Russell, Ward, Wilson &amp; Wootton, in press) following [[brain impairment]] and [[Parkinson's disease]]. Collectively, these studies have revealed positive treatment outcomes, while assessment and diagnoses have been found to be comparable to face-to-face evaluations.

The treatment of stuttering has been adapted to a telerehabilitation environment with notable success. Two Australian studies (Harrison, Wilson &amp; Onslow, 1999; Wilson, Onslow &amp; Lincoln, 2004) involving the distance delivery of the [[Lidcombe program]] to children who stutter have utilized the telephone in conjunction with [[offline]] video recordings to successfully treat several children. Overall, the parents and children responded positively to the program delivered at a distant. Using a high speed videoconferencing system link, Sicotte, Lehoux, Fortier-Blanc and Leblanc (2003) assessed and treated six children and adolescents with a positive reduction in the frequency of dysfluency that was maintained six months later. In addition, a videoconferencing platform has been used successfully to provide follow-up treatment to an adult who had previously received intensive therapy (Kully, 200).

Reports of telerehabilitation applications in [[paediatric]] speech and language disorders are sparse. A recent Australian pilot study has investigated the feasibility of an Internet-based assessment of speech disorder in six children (Waite, Cahill, Theodoros, Russell, Busuttin, in press). High levels of agreement between the online and face-to-face clinicians for [[single-word articulation]], [[speech intelligibility]], and [[oro-motor task]]s were obtained suggesting that the Internet-based protocol had the potential to be a reliable method for assessing paediatric speech disorders.

Voice therapy across a variety of types of voice disorders has been shown to be effectively delivered via a telerehabilitation application. Mashima et al. (2003) using PC based videoconferencing and speech analysis software compared 23 patients treated online with 28 persons treated face-to-face. The authors reported positive post treatment results with no significant difference in measures between the traditional and videoconferencing group, suggesting that the majority of traditional voice therapy techniques can be applied to distance treatment.

Although obvious limitations exist, telerehabilitation applications for the assessment of swallowing function have also been used with success. Lalor, Brown and Cranfield (2000) were able to obtain an initial assessment of the nature and extent of swallowing dysfunction in an adult via a videoconferencing link although a more complete evaluation was restricted due to the inability to physically determine the degree of [[Larynx|laryngeal]] movement. A more sophisticated telerehabilitation application for the assessment of swallowing was developed by Perlman and Witthawaskul (2002) who described the use of real-time videofluoroscopic examination via the Internet. This system enabled the capture and display of images in real-time with only a three to five second delay.

There continues to be a need for ongoing research to develop and validate the use of telerehabilitation applications in speech-language pathology in a greater number and variety of adult and paediatric communication and swallowing disorders.

'''Thomas Fresh''' (3 September 1803 – 1861) was a pioneer in British [[environmental health]]. In 1844, he became [[Liverpool]]'s first public health officer.&lt;ref name="Parkinson, Norman"&gt;{{cite web|last=Parkinson|first=Norman |url=http://jmb.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/07/25/0967772013479277.abstract |title=Thomas Fresh (1803-1861), Inspector of Nuisances, Liverpool's first Public Health Officer|format=|work=Journal of Medical Biography|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Thomas Fresh was born on 3 September 1803 at the family farm 'Newbarns', in the village of [[Newbarns]], in the [[Lake District]] parish of [[Dalton-in-Furness]]. The family also had interests in property and iron-ore mining and trading.&lt;ref name="Parkinson, Norman"/&gt;

Fresh was appointed Liverpool's [[Inspector of Nuisances]] by the Borough's Health of the Town Committee on 4 September 1844, over two years before the celebrated appointments on 1 January 1847 of [[William Henry Duncan]], as Britain's first [[Medical Officer of Health]], [[James Newlands]] as the first Borough Engineer, and Fresh’s own re-appointment under the Liverpool ‘Sanatory’ Act of 1846.&lt;ref name="Parkinson, Norman" /&gt;

Even before his 1844 appointment Fresh was the officer responsible for environmental health interventions, working initially from the police department. He was also at various times concurrently Superintendent of Alms Houses, and Superintendent of Scavengers (i.e. manager of refuse collection and public cleansing). The latter was eventually subsumed into Newlands' department.&lt;ref name="Parkinson, Norman" /&gt;

Thomas Fresh was the first inspector of nuisances appointed by a United Kingdom Health Committee. When he was re-appointed in January 1847 he became probably the first of the inspectors of nuisances (sanitary inspectors) appointed under a 'Sanatory Act' with statutorily defined powers and duties. They were the forefathers of today's environmental health practitioners.  With no trained staff to call upon, and with no established systems or infrastructures, Fresh created a model sanitary department, and became nationally famous. He worked closely with William Duncan, the Medical Officer of Health, who had no field staff of his own.&lt;ref name="Parkinson, Norman" /&gt;

Fresh died in [[Glasgow]] in 1861 and is buried in Liverpool’s St James’s Cemetery. He was succeeded by his wife Martha. They had no children.&lt;ref name="Parkinson, Norman" /&gt;

==Legacy==

In 1853 Thomas and Martha Fresh were living in a much extended and improved former agricultural cottage on his 'model farm' in the [[Formby]] district between Liverpool and Southport when, on behalf of local residents and the joint Lord of the Manor, he asked the directors of the [[Liverpool, Crosby and Southport Railway]] to construct a station at that point on the line. He donated his own land for the purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Dilworth, Kate (2008) [http://www.formbytimes.co.uk/news/formby-news/2008/09/25/mr-fresh-of-freshfield-celebrated-at-formby-66401-21891362/ Mr Fresh, of Freshfield, celebrated at Formby], ''Formby Times'', 25 September. (accessed: 9 July 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parkinson, Norman" /&gt; As a significant landowner in the area, he gave his name to the district of [[Freshfield]] and [[Freshfield railway station]] - built in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Gahan|first=John W.|title=Seaport to Seaside|page=88|publisher=Countyvise Limited|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fresh's house is today 95 Freshfield Road, Freshfield. A blue plaque has been affixed to the house by the Formby Civic Society, and an application is to be made to have the house 'listed' to celebrate its significance as the home of the founder of Freshfield and one of the Liverpool public health pioneers.

'''Water metering''' is the process of measuring water use.

In many [[developed countries]] water meters are used to measure the volume of [[water use]]d by residential and commercial buildings that are supplied with water by a public [[water supply]] system. Water meters can also be used at the water source, well, or throughout a water system to determine [[Fluid dynamics|flow]] through a particular portion of the system. In most of the world water meters measure flow in [[cubic metre]]s (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) or litres &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofwat.gov.uk/mediacentre/leaflets/prs_lft_101117meters.pdf|title=Ofwat UK - Water meters - your questions answered|author=|date=|website=ofwat.gov.uk|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the USA and some other countries water meters are calibrated in [[Cubic foot|cubic feet]] (ft.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) or [[US gallon]]s on a mechanical or electronic register. Some electronic meter registers can display rate-of-flow in addition to total usage.

There are several types of water meters in common use. The choice depends on the flow measurement method, the type of end user, the required flow rates, and accuracy requirements.

In North America, standards for manufacturing water meters are set by the [[American Water Works Association]]. Outside of North America, most countries use [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO standards]]

==Types of metering devices==
{{see also|Flow measurement}}
There are two common approaches to flow measurement, [[#Displacement water meters|displacement]] and [[#Velocity water meters|velocity]], each making use of a variety of technologies. Common displacement designs include oscillating piston and nutating disc meters. Velocity-based designs include single- and multi-jet meters and turbine meters.

There are also non-mechanical designs, for example electromagnetic and ultrasonic meters, and meters designed for special uses. Most meters in a typical [[Water supply network|water distribution system]] are designed to measure cold [[potable water]] only. Specialty hot water meters are designed with materials that can withstand higher temperatures. Meters for [[reclaimed water]] have special lavender register covers to signify that the water should not be used for drinking.

Additionally, there are electromechanical meters, like prepaid water meters and automatic meter reading meters. The latter integrates an electronic measurement component and a [[LCD]] with a mechanical water meter. Mechanical water meters normally use a reed switch, hall or photoelectric coding register as the signal output. After processing by the [[microcontroller]] unit (MCU) in the electronic module, the data are transmitted to the LCD or output to an information management system.

Water meters are generally owned, read and maintained by a public [[water provider]] such as a city, rural water association or private [[water company]]. In some cases an owner of a mobile home park, apartment complex or commercial building may be billed by a utility based on the reading of one meter, with the costs shared among the tenants based on some sort of key (size of flat, number of inhabitants or by separately tracking the water consumption of each unit in what is called [[Utility submeter|submetering]]).

===Displacement water meters===
[[Image:Hidrômetro.JPG|right|thumb|250px|'''Water meter''' in [[Belo Horizonte]].]]
This type of water meter is most often used in residential and small commercial applications and homes. [[Displacement Volumetric Meter|Displacement meters]] are commonly referred to as [[Positive displacement meter|Positive Displacement]], or "PD" meters. Two common types are oscillating piston meters and [[wiktionary:nutate|nutating]] disk meters. Either method relies on the water to physically displace the moving measuring element in direct proportion to the amount of water that passes through the meter. The piston or disk moves a magnet that drives the register.

PD meters are generally very accurate at the low-to-moderate flow rates typical of residential and small commercial users, and commonly range in size from 5/8" to 2". Because displacement meters require that all water flows through the meter to "push" the measuring element, they generally are not practical in large commercial applications requiring high flow rates or low pressure loss. PD meters normally have a built-in strainer to protect the measuring element from rocks or other debris that could stop or break the measuring element. PD meters normally have bronze, brass or plastic bodies with internal measuring chambers made of molded plastics and stainless steel.

===Velocity water meters===
A velocity-type meter measures the velocity of flow through a meter of a known internal capacity. The speed of the flow can then be converted into volume of flow to determine the usage. There are several types of meters that measure water flow velocity, including jet meters (single-jet and multi-jet), turbine meters, propeller meters and mag meters. Most velocity-based meters have an adjustment vane for calibrating the meter to the required accuracy.

====Multi-jet meters====
Multi-jet meters are very accurate in small sizes and are commonly used in ⅝" to 2" sizes for residential and small commercial users. Multi-jet meters use multiple ports surrounding an internal chamber to create multiple jets of water against an [[impeller]], whose rotation speed depends on the velocity of water flow. Multi-jets are very accurate at low flow rates, but there are no large size meters since they do not have the straight-through flow path needed for the high flow rates used in large pipe diameters.  Multi-jet meters generally have an internal strainer element that can protect the jet ports from getting clogged. Multi-jet meters normally have [[bronze]] alloy bodies or outer casings, with internal measuring parts made from modern [[thermoplastics]] and stainless steel.

====Turbine meters====
Turbine meters are less accurate than displacement and jet meters at low flow rates, but the measuring element does not occupy or severely restrict the entire path of flow. The flow direction is generally straight through the meter, allowing for higher flow rates and less pressure loss than displacement-type meters. They are the meter of choice for large commercial users, fire protection and as master meters for the water distribution system.  [[Strainers]] are generally required to be installed in front of the meter to protect the measuring element from gravel or other debris that could enter the water distribution system. Turbine meters are generally available for 1-½" to 12" or higher pipe sizes. Turbine meter bodies are commonly made of bronze, [[cast iron]] or [[ductile iron]]. Internal turbine elements can be plastic or non-corrosive metal alloys. They are accurate in normal working conditions but are greatly affected by the flow profile and fluid conditions.

*'''Fire meters''' are a specialized type of turbine meter meeting the high flow rates requirements for fire protection. They are often approved by [[Underwriters Laboratories]] (UL) or [[FM Global|Factory Mutual]] (FM) for use in fire protection.
*'''Fire hydrant meters''' are a specialized type of portable turbine meter attached to a [[fire hydrant]] to measure water flowing out of the hydrant. The meters are normally made of aluminium to keep their weight low and usually have a 3" capacity. Utilities often require them for measuring water used on construction sites, for pool filling, or where a permanent meter has not yet been installed.

====Compound meters====
A compound meter is used where high flow rates are necessary, but where at times there are also smaller rates of flow that need to be accurately measured. Compound meters have two measuring elements and a check valve to regulate flow between them. At high flow rates, water is normally diverted primarily or completely to the high flow element. The high flow element is typically a turbine meter. When flow rates drop to where the high flow element cannot measure accurately, a check valve closes to divert water to a smaller element that can measure the lower flow rates accurately. The low flow element is typically a multi-jet or PD meter. By adding the values registered by the high and low elements, the utility has a record of the total consumption of water flowing through the meter.

===Electromagnetic meters===
[[File:Tetley's brewery, Leeds (10th May 2010) 008.jpg|thumb|Electromagnetic flow meter]]
[[Magnetic flow meter]]s, commonly referred to as "mag meters", are technically a velocity-type water meter, except that they use electromagnetic properties to determine the water flow velocity, rather than the mechanical means used by jet and turbine meters. Mag meters use the physics principle of [[Faraday's law of induction]] for measurement, and require AC or DC electricity from a power line or battery to operate the [[electromagnet]]s. Since mag meters have no mechanical measuring element, they normally have the advantage of being able to measure flow in either direction, and use electronics for measuring and totalizing the flow. Mag meters can also be useful for measuring raw (untreated/unfiltered) water and waste-water, since there is no mechanical measuring element to get clogged or damaged by debris flowing through the meter. Strainers are not required with mag meters, since there is no measuring element in the stream of flow that could be damaged. Since stray electrical energy flowing through the flow tube can cause inaccurate readings, most mag meters are installed with either grounding rings or grounding [[electrodes]] to divert stray electricity away from the electrodes used to measure the flow inside the flow tube.

===Ultrasonic meters===
[[Ultrasonic flow meter|Ultrasonic water meters]] use one or more [[Ultrasonic sensor|ultrasonic]] [[transducer]] to send ultrasonic sound waves through the fluid to determine the velocity of the water.  Since the cross-sectional area of the meter body is a fixed and known value, when the velocity of water is detected, the volume of water passing through the meter can be calculated with very high accuracy.  Because water density changes with temperature, most ultrasonic water meters also measure the water temperature as a component of the volume calculation.

There are 2 primary ultrasonic measurement technologies used in water metering:

* [[Doppler effect]] meters which utilize the [[Doppler Effect]] to determine the velocity of water passing through the meter.
* Transit Time meters which measure the amount of time required for the ultrasonic signal to pass between 2 or more fixed points inside the meter.

Ultrasonic meters may either be of flow-through or "clamp-on" design.  Flow-through designs are those where the water passes directly through the meter, and are typically found in residential or commercial applications.  Clamp-on designs are generally used for larger diameters where the sensors are mounted to the exterior of pipes, etc.

Ultrasonic water meters are typically very accurate, with residential meters capable of measuring down to 0.01 gallons or 0.001 cubic feet.  In addition they have wide flow measurement ranges, require little maintenance and have long lifespans due to the lack of internal mechanical components to wear out.  While relatively new to the American water utility market, ultrasonic meters have been used in commercial applications for many years and are becoming widely accepted due to their advantages over traditional mechanical designs.

===Prepaid water meters===
Meters can be prepaid or postpaid, depending on the payment method. Most mechanical type water meters are of the postpaid type, as are electromagnetic  and ultrasonic meters. With prepaid water meters the user purchases and prepays for a given amount of water from a vending station. The amount of water credited is entered on media such as an IC or RF type card. The main difference is whether the card needs a contact with the processing part of the prepaid water meter. In some areas a prepaid water meter uses a keypad as the interface for inputting the water credit.

==Registers==
[[Image:Water meter register.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A typical water meter register showing a meter reading of 8.3 gallons. Notice the black "1" on the odometer has not yet fully turned over, so only the red hand is read.]]
[[File:Water meter with remote reading.jpg|thumb|Water meters connected to remote reading devices through three-wire cables]]

There are several types of registers on water meters. A standard register normally has a dial similar to a clock, with gradations around the perimeter to indicate the measuring unit and the amount of water used, if less than the lowest digit in a display similar to the odometer wheels in a car, their sum being the total volume used. Modern registers are normally driven by a magnetic coupling between a magnet in the measuring chamber attached to the measuring element and another attached to the bottom of the register. Gears in the register convert the motion of the measuring element to the proper usage increment for display on the sweep hand and the odometer-style wheels. Many registers also have a leak detector. This is a small visible disk or hand that is geared closer to the rotation speed of the drive magnet, so that very small flows that would be visually undetectable on the regular sweep hand can be seen.

With [[Automatic Meter Reading]], manufacturers have developed pulse or encoder registers to produce electronic output for radio transmitters, reading storage devices, and data logging devices. Pulse meters send a digital or analog electronic pulse to a recording device. Encoder registers have an electronic means permitting an external device to interrogate the register to obtain either the position of the wheels or a stored electronic reading. Frequent transmissions of consumption data can be used to give [[smart meter]] functionality.

There are also some specialized types of registers such as meters with an [[LCD]] instead of mechanical wheels, and registers to output data or pulses to a variety of recording and controller devices. For industrial applications, output is often [[4-20 mA]] analog for recording or controlling different flow rates in addition to totalization.

===Water meter reading===
Different size meters indicate different resolutions of the reading. One rotation of the sweep hand may be equivalent to 10 gallons or to 1,000 gallons (1 to 100&amp;nbsp;ft.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 0.1 to 10 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). If one rotation of the hand represents 10 gallons, the meter has a 10-gallon sweep. Sometimes the last number(s) of the wheel display are non-rotating or printed on the dial face. The fixed zero number(s) are represented by the position of the rotating sweep hand. For example, if one rotation of the hand is 10 gallons, the sweep hand is on 7, and the wheel display shows 123456 plus a fixed zero, the actual total usage would be 1,234,567 gallons.

In the United States most utilities bill only to the nearest 100 or 1,000 gallons (10 to 100&amp;nbsp;ft.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 1 to 10 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), and often only read the leftmost 4 or 5 numbers on the display wheels. Using the above example, they would read and bill 1,234, rounding to 1,234,000 gallons based on a 1,000 gallon billing resolution. The most common rounding for a particular size meter is often indicated by differently coloured number wheels, the ones ignored being black, and the ones used for billing being white.

==Prevalence==
[[File:Water meter in building .jpg|250px|thumb|right|Water meter in building]]
Water metering is common for residential and commercial drinking [[water supply]] in many countries, as well as for industrial self-supply with water. However, it is less common in [[irrigated agriculture]], which is the major water user worldwide. Water metering is also uncommon for piped drinking water supply in rural areas and small towns, although there are examples of successful metering in rural areas in developing countries, such as in El Salvador.&lt;ref&gt;Water and Sanitation Program Field Note: Micro-metering in rural areas: A success story from El Salvador, 2003 (in Spanish) [http://www.wsp.org/filez/pubs/ELSALVADOR.pdf PAS]&lt;/ref&gt;

Metering of water supplied by utilities to residential, commercial and industrial users is common in most developed countries, except for the [[Water supply and sanitation in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] where only about 38% of users are metered.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ofwat.gov.uk/future/customers/metering/pap_tec201110metering.pdf - Ofwat, Exploring the costs and benefits of faster, more systematic water metering in [[England and Wales]], October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In some developing countries metering is very common, such as in [[Water supply and sanitation in Chile|Chile]] where it stands at 96%, while in others it still remains low, such as in [[Water supply and sanitation in Argentina|Argentina]].

The percentage of residential water metering in selected cities in developing countries is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;World Bank: Water, Electricity and the Poor, p. 78 [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWSS/Resources/Subsidybook.pdf WB]&lt;/ref&gt;

* 99% in [[Santiago de Chile]] (1998)
* 96% in [[Abidjan]], Ivory Coast (1987)
* 62% in cities in Guatemala (2000)
* 30% in [[Lima]], Peru (1991)
* 28% in [[Kathmandu]], Nepal (2001)
*  2% in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina (1992)

Nearly two-thirds of [[OECD]] countries meter more than 90% of single-family houses. A few are also expanding their metering of apartments (e.g., France and Germany).&lt;ref&gt;OECD:[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/21/1/1934075.pdf The Price of Water: Trends in OECD countries], 1999, accessed on 21 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
The benefits of metering are that:

* in conjunction with volumetric pricing it provides an incentive for water conservation,
* it helps to detect water leaks in the distribution network, thus providing a basis for reducing the amount of [[non-revenue water]];
* it is a precondition for quantity-targeting of water subsidies to the poor.

==Costs==
The costs of metering include:

* Investment costs to purchase, install and replace meters, 
* Recurring costs to read meters and issue bills based on consumption instead of bills based on monthly flat fees.

While the cost of purchasing residential meters is low, the total [[Whole-life cost|life cycle costs]] of metering are high. For example, retrofitting flats in large buildings with meters for every flat can involve major and thus costly plumbing work.&lt;ref name="Lis Stedman 2006, p. 26-28"&gt;Lis Stedman: Motivations for metering, Water 21, The Magazine of the International Water Association, April 2006, p. 26-28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems==
Problems associated with metering arise particularly in the case of intermittent supply, which is common in many developing countries. Sudden changes in pressure can damage meters to the extent that many meters in cities in developing countries are not functional. Also, some types of meters become less accurate as they age, and under-registering consumption leads to lower revenues if defective meters are not regularly replaced. Many types of meters also register air flows, which can lead to over-registration of consumption,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Walters |first=David |date=2012 |title=Experimentelle Untersuchung der Genauigkeit von Hauswasserzählern bei intermittierender Wasserversorgung |type=M. Sc. |publisher=Karlsruher Institut fur Technologie (KIT) }}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in systems with intermittent supply, when water supply is re-established and the incoming water pushes air through the meters.

==Effect on consumption==
There is disagreement as to the effect of metering and water pricing on water consumption. The [[price elasticity]] of metered water demand varies greatly depending on local conditions. The effect of volumetric water pricing on consumption tends to be higher if the water bill represents a significant portion of household expenditures. There is evidence from the UK that there is an instant drop in consumption of some 10% when meters are installed, although in most instances consumption isn't directly measured prior to meter installation, so the benefits are uncertain.&lt;ref name="Lis Stedman 2006, p. 26-28"/&gt; Whilst metered water users in the UK do use less than unmetered users, in most areas metering is not compulsory, so the metered customers are a self-selecting group. There is also concern that water metering could be socially regressive, as householders on low incomes are less able to invest in [[water efficiency]] measures and may experience water poverty (defined as when a household spends more than 3% of net income on water and sewage services).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.poverty.ac.uk/articles-water-utilities-inflation-low-income-households-editors-pick/water-poverty-set-soar|title=Water poverty set to soar {{!}} Poverty and Social Exclusion|website=www.poverty.ac.uk|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]], domestic water consumption for metered flats (112 liter/capita/day) was 18% lower than for unmetered flats (137 liter/capita/day) in 1992.
