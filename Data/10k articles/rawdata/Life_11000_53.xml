'''Agnes of Brunswick-Grubenhagen''' (born: {{circa|1406}}; died: 18 November 1439) was, from 1412 to 1439, [[abbess]] of [[Gandersheim Abbey]] as '''Agnes II'''.

== Life ==
She was a daughter of [[Eric I, Duke of Brunswick-Grubenhagen]].  She was about six years old when she was elected abbess of [[Gandersheim Abbey]].  The pope confirmed Agnes's election while she was a minor while Agnes, however, he appointed a dean of the Abbey as her guardian and regent.  Around 1425, Agnes began to rule without a regent.

She died in 1439 and was buried in the abbey church.

He was a royal appointee of [[Sigebert I]]. After his prefecture was up, he was elected to replace [[Ferreolus of Uzès|Ferreolus]] as [[Bishop of Uzès]] in 581.

The man he had replaced as prefect, [[Jovinus of Provence|Jovinus]], later testified against him in court when it was alleged that he had unlawfully imprisoned an [[archdeacon]] on [[Christmas Day]] for the theft of a merchant's goods.

'''Aristonous of [[Pella]]''', son of Peisaeus, who was one of the [[somatophylakes]] ''bodyguards'' of [[Alexander the Great]], distinguished himself greatly on one occasion in India. On the death of Alexander, he was one of the first to propose that the supreme power should be entrusted to [[Perdiccas]]. He was subsequently [[Olympias]]' general in the war with [[Cassander]]; and when Olympias was taken prisoner in 316 BC, he was put to death by order of Cassander.

Aristonous is described as of both [[Pella]]ean&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''Anabasis'' 6.28.4&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eordaea]]n in origin,&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''Indica'' 18.5&lt;/ref&gt; which would mean that he was from Eordaea but raised at the court in Pella. According to Plutarch, a certain somatophylax, Aristophanes, took away Alexander's sword when he was quarrelling with [[Cleitus the Black]], but this reference seems to be confused with Aristonous.

The '''Atmospheric Chemistry Suite''' ('''ACS''') is a science payload consisting of three [[Infrared spectroscopy|infrared spectrometer]] channels abord the [[ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter]] (TGO) orbiting Mars since October 2016.&lt;ref name='Korablev 2014'&gt; ''Three infrared spectrometers, an atmospheric chemistry suite for the ExoMars 2016 Trace Gas Orbiter''. Korablev, O., et al., 2014. J. Appl. Remote Sensing. 8, 4983.&lt;/ref&gt;  The three channels are: the near-infrared channel ([[Near-infrared spectroscopy|NIR]]), the mid-infrared channel (MIR), and the far infrared channel (FIR, also called TIRVIM).

The ACS was proposed in 2011 by Russian Academy Section and eventually accepted by the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) and [[Roscosmos]] as one of two Russian instruments onboard TGO. &lt;ref name='Korablev 2016'&gt; [http://www-mars.lmd.jussieu.fr/granada2017/abstracts/korablev_granada2017.pdf Science Investigations for the Atmospheric Chemistry Suite on ExoMars TGO]. (PDF) O. Korablev, N. I. Ignatiev, A. A. Fedorova, A. Yu. Trokhimovskiy, A. V. Grigoriev, A. V. Shakun, Space, F. Montmessin, F. Lefevre, F. Forget. ''Sixth International Workshop on the Mars Atmosphere: Modelling and Observations''. Granada, Spain 17-20 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  The instrument was funded by Roscosmos and [[Centre national d'études spatiales]] (CNES) of France, and has components of both Russia and France. Its development and fabrication was under Russian leadership. The functionality of all the three channels was confirmed during cruise to Mars.

==Objectives==

The main objective of the ACS suite is to make an inventory and map minor atmospheric species or trace gases in the [[atmosphere of Mars]]. This will allow scientists to profile the upper limits on the [[Atmosphere of Mars#Methane|methane contents]], and to possibly to detect sulfur dioxide ([[Sulfur dioxide|{{chem|SO|2}}]]), a gas of volcanic origin.&lt;ref name='Korablev 2016'/&gt;

== Channels ==

The [[Near-infrared spectroscopy|near-infrared]] channel (NIR), is a compact spectrometer operating in the range of 0.7–1.7 μm
with a resolving power of λ/Δλ ~ 20,000 and with a spectral range of 10-20 nm. It is designed to operate in [[nadir]] and in  [[occultation|solar occultation]] modes.&lt;ref name='Korablev 2016'/&gt; 

The mid-infrared channel (MIR) is an [[Echelle grating|echelle]] spectrometer with crossed dispersion, designed exclusively
for solar occultation measurements in the 2.2–4.4 μm spectral range with a resolving power of approximately 50,000.&lt;ref name='Korablev 2016'/&gt;

The far-infrared channel covers the [[thermal infrared spectroscopy]]; it is a [[Planetary Fourier Spectrometer|Fourier spectrometer]] called the TIRVIM. It has an aperture of ~5 cm and it measures the spectrum of 1.7–17 μm. Its main task will be for temperature sounding of the [[Atmosphere of Mars|Martian atmosphere]] in the 15-μm {{chem|CO|2}} band. TIRVIM has 10 times higher
performances than the PFS spectrometer of [[Mars Express]] orbiter. &lt;ref name='Korablev 2016'/&gt;

==Methane==

{{main article|Atmosphere of Mars#Methane}}
Of particular interest to this astrobiology mission, is the detection and characterization of the [[Atmosphere of Mars#Methane|atmospheric methane]] ({{chem|CH|4}}), as it may be of geological or biological nature. Large differences in the abundances were measured between observations taken in 2003, 2006, and on 2014 NASA reported that the ''Curiosity'' rover detected a tenfold increase ('spike') in methane in the atmosphere in late 2013 and early 2014.  This suggestes that the methane was locally concentrated and is probably seasonal. Because methane on Mars would quickly break down due to ultraviolet radiation from the Sun and chemical reactions with other gases, its persistent presence in the atmosphere also implies the existence of an unknown source to continually replenish the gas.&lt;ref name='Webster 2015'&gt;{{cite journal |title=Mars methane detection and variability at Gale crater |journal=Science |date=23 January 2015 |last=Webster |first=Christopher R. |volume=347 |issue=6220 |pages=415–417 |doi=10.1126/science.1261713 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/347/6220/415.short |accessdate=2015-04-15 |bibcode = 2015Sci...347..415W |pmid=25515120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Measuring the ratio of [[hydrogen]] and [[methane]] levels on Mars may help determine the likelihood of [[life on Mars]].&lt;ref name="PNAS-20120607"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Oze |first1=Christopher |last2=Jones |first2=Camille |last3=Goldsmith |first3=Jonas I. |last4=Rosenbauer |first4=Robert J. |title=Differentiating biotic from abiotic methane genesis in hydrothermally active planetary surfaces |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/109/25/9750.abstract |date=7 June 2012 |journal=[[PNAS]] |volume=109| issue =  25 |pages=9750–9754 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1205223109 |accessdate=27 June 2012 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..109.9750O |pmid=22679287 |pmc=3382529}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Space-20120625"&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff |title=Mars Life Could Leave Traces in Red Planet's Air: Study |url=http://www.space.com/16284-mars-life-atmosphere-hydrogen-methane.html |date=25 June 2012 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=27 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the scientists, "...low H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ratios (less than approximately 40) indicate that life is likely present and active."&lt;ref name="PNAS-20120607" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3021">'''BS 25999''' was [[BSI Group|BSI's]] standard in the field of [[Business continuity planning|Business Continuity Management]] (BCM). It was withdrawn in 2012 (part 2) and 2013 (part 1) following the publication of the international standards [[ISO 22301]] -  ″Societal Security — Business continuity management systems — Requirements″ and [[ISO 22313]] - ″Societal Security — Business continuity management systems — Guidance″

Upon its publication in 2007 BS 25999 replaced PAS 56, a [[Publicly Available Specification]], published in 2003 on the same subject.

==Structure==
BS 25999 was a Business Continuity Management (BCM) standard published by the British Standards Institution (BSI).

It had two parts;

* Part 1, "BS 25999-1:2006 Business Continuity Management. Code of Practice", took the form of general guidance on the processes, principles and terminology recommended for BCM.
* Part 2, "BS 25999-2:2007 Specification for Business Continuity Management", specified a set of requirements for implementing, operating and improving a BCM System (BCMS).

==Timelines==
The first part of BS 25999 (BS 25999-1:2006) was published by the [[BSI Group|British Standards Institution]] in December 2006. The second part of BS 25999 (BS 25999-2:2007) was published in November 2007.

BS 25999-2 was withdrawn in November 2012 having been replaced by the International Standard, ISO 22301. BS 25999-1 was withdrawn in early 2013 having been replaced by ISO 22313.

==Development==
Both parts of the standard contributed significantly to the international standards that succeeded then and to the development of other national and international standards (such as ASIS/BSI BCM.01:2010).

==Other related standards==
There are a number of similar worldwide standards:

North America - Published by the National Fire Protection Association
NFPA 1600: Standard on Disaster/Emergency Management and Business Continuity Programs.

ASIS/BSI BCM.01:2010 Business Continuity Management Systems: Requirements with Guidance for Use. Published in December 2010 and developed jointly between ASIS and BSI for North America

The first live-action version of the character appeared in the tenth and final season of ''[[Smallville (TV series)| Smallville]]'', played by [[James Marsters]]. Brainiac 5 is introduced in the third season of ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', portrayed by [[Jesse Rath]]. He became part of the main cast in the [[Supergirl (season 4)|fourth season]].

==Publication history==
Brainiac 5 first appeared in name in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #276 (May 1961) and was created by [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Jim Mooney]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Original continuity (1958–1994)===
{{Main|Legion of Super-Heroes (1958 team)}}
Brainiac 5 is a green-skinned, blond-haired teenage native of the planet Colu, who claimed to be descended from the original [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]], one of [[Superman]]'s deadliest enemies. He wished to join the Legion as atonement for his great-great-grandfather's misdeeds. When Brainiac 1 was revealed to be an android created by the Computer Tyrants, Brainiac 5 "discovered" he was actually descended from Brainiac 2, the leader of the rebellion against the tyrants, as well as being the clone of the original Brainiac. Brainiac 5's ingenuity led to the invention of, amongst other things, the [[Legion Flight Ring|Legion flight ring]] (perfecting an invention of the original [[Invisible Kid]] based on a metal discovered by [[Mon-El]]), the anti-lead serum that allowed Mon-El to leave the [[Phantom Zone]] and the force field belt which became the signature device of the character. Another of Brainiac 5's creations had less beneficial effects:  the super computer [[Computo (comics)|Computo]], which attempted to take over the world, killing one of [[Triplicate Girl]]'s three selves in the process. He successfully destroyed his creation with "an [[anti-matter]] force", but this highlighted one of his major flaws: a habit of initiating projects without considering the dangers. A much later example was his transformation of fellow scientist Professor Jaxon Rugarth into the psychotic, all-powerful [[Infinite Man]] in conjunction with honorary Legionnaire [[Rond Vidar]].

As time went on, Brainiac 5 began to be portrayed as unstable. Long attracted to [[Supergirl]], Brainiac 5 created a robot duplicate of her in his sleep, convincing himself this was the real Supergirl.&lt;ref&gt;''Superboy'' vol. 1, #204 (September–October 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; A few years the Legion encountered [[Pulsar Stargrave]], a villain who convinced Brainiac 5 that he was the Coluan's long-lost father.&lt;ref&gt;''Superboy'' vol. 1, #224 (February 1977)&lt;/ref&gt; Brainiac 5 joined Stargrave to battle the sorcerer [[Mordru]], but the android's influence would haunt him long after that. It was claimed in ''Superboy'' #225 that Stargrave was actually the original Brainiac android, but the truth of this is uncertain.

When Stargrave murders [[Ultra Boy]]'s ex-girlfriend An Ryd, Brainiac 5 frames Ultra Boy for the murder. [[Chameleon Boy]], who suspected Brainiac 5 from the beginning, finds proof when Brainiac's madness leads him to an attempt to destroy the universe using the [[Miracle Machine]], a device that turns thoughts into reality. He is stopped by [[Matter-Eater Lad]], who eats the machine, and both are committed to a mental institution (the energies of the Machine having driven Matter-Eater Lad insane). Brainiac 5 eventually recovers his sanity and rejoins the group. Shortly afterward, however, he is accused of having murdered Ultra Boy's ex-girlfriend himself. To prove his innocence, he finds Stargrave and defeats him. He later manages to cure [[Matter-Eater Lad]]'s insanity. Around this time, he corrects another of his mistakes by finding a way of controlling Computo.

====''Crisis on Infinite Earths''====
{{Main|Crisis on Infinite Earths}}
Brainiac 5 enters a state of deep melancholy upon the thousand-year anniversary of Supergirl's death at the hands of the [[Anti-Monitor]] during ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' and flew down to hell and finished his life.&lt;ref&gt;''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 3) #16 (November 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the Crisis eliminated Supergirl from existence, Brainiac 5 (as well as everyone else) has no recollection of her. Beyond this, however, Brainiac 5's history was relatively unaffected by the Crisis, although it would be some time before he received an origin that reflected the new Brainiac 1. Following the death of the pocket universe [[Superboy]], Brainiac 5 is one of a number of Legionnaires who swear revenge on the [[Time Trapper]]. To this end, he recreated the Infinite Man. The Infinite Man and Time Trapper seemingly destroy each other, but Brainiac 5 quits the Legion after being accused of murdering Professor Rugarth. He rejoins in ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 3) #63 (Aug 1989), shortly before the "'''Five Year Gap'''".

===="Five Year Gap"====
Five years after the end of the "Magic Wars", things had radically changed for the heroes, most notably the disbanding of the Legion and an ongoing war with the [[Khund]] Empire, which had resulted in Earth's government (Earthgov) signing a deal with the [[Dominators (DC Comics)|Dominators]]. When ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 4) began, Brainiac 5 was dedicated to finding a cure to the [[Validus]] Plague, a virulent disease that had afflicted an entire planet and crippled the former Lightning Lad, [[Garth Ranzz]]. Soon after the start of ''Legion'' (vol. 4) a [[retcon]] removed the Superman family of characters almost completely from Legion continuity. Supergirl was replaced by [[Laurel Gand]], a Daxamite descendant of [[Lar Gand]]'s brother. Unlike Supergirl, she was a native of the 30th century. Brainiac 5 and Laurel did have a relationship, but the couple eventually separated and she became the [[common-law marriage|common law wife]] of [[Rond Vidar]] (a Legion ally and [[Green Lantern Corps|Green Lantern]] who had been a close friend of Brainiac 5).

Brainiac 5 joined other Legionnaires in searching for the space pirate Roxxas, and was present when the team officially reformed. The reassembled Legion repelled a Khund invasion fleet, and confronted [[Darkseid]], but shortly thereafter, was swept into the war against the corrupt Earthgov and the Dominators. During the Dominators' subjugation of Earth, the members of their highly classified "Batch SW6" escaped captivity.  Originally, Batch SW6 appeared to be a group of teenage Legionnaire clones, created from samples apparently taken just prior to [[Ferro Lad]]'s death at the hands of the [[Sun-Eater]]. Later, they were revealed to be time-paradox duplicates, every bit as legitimate as their older counterparts. After Earth was destroyed in a disaster reminiscent of the destruction of [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] over a millennium earlier,&lt;ref&gt;''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 4) #38 (Late December 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; a few dozen surviving cities and their inhabitants reconstituted their world as New Earth. The SW6 Legionnaires — including their version of Brainiac 5 — remained.

Not long after the destruction of Earth, Brainiac 5 discovered the timestream was extremely unstable, and that Legion history was in a state of constant flux. This was the first indication of ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'', the event that would lead to the Legion's whole history being rebooted. During a battle with [[Glorith]], a time-warping sorceress, Brainiac 5 was rapidly aged into a weathered, enfeebled older man. Due to the trauma of this rapid aging, Brainiac's already-prickly personality took a turn for the worse, and he became colder, more clinical, and even amoral. When the Legion was forced to go on the run as fugitives after being framed by [[Universo]] and the Khund Empire, Brainiac wore a high-tech combat suit to protect his ravaged new body, and went by the simpler moniker of "5". When "Zero Hour" befell the Legion, Brainiac 5 redoubled his efforts to save the timestream and reality as the 30th century knew it. Despite all the brilliance of Brainiac and his youthful SW6 counterpart combined, they could not save themselves from being swallowed up by temporal entropy, and their timeline was rebooted.

===''Zero Hour'' reboot continuity (1994–2004)===
{{Main|Legion of Super-Heroes (1994 team)}}
Following the Zero Hour event and the rebooting of the Legion, the "new" Brainiac 5 was extremely antisocial and disrespectful of his colleagues. He barely interacted with the other Legionnaires, although he was still somewhat attracted to Laurel Gand, now called [[Andromeda (DC Comics)|Andromeda]], who was now also something of an outsider. When Andromeda was believed killed, he was the only person who really missed her, a wrenching experience for someone used to suppressing emotion.&lt;ref name="MissingAndromeda"&gt;''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 4) #72 (September 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; It was later revealed that, even amongst Coluans, Querl Dox had been something of a loner, due to his even higher intelligence, interest in practical experiments rather than "pure" thought, and lack of concern about the consequences of his experiments. It was also revealed that his mother, [[Brainiac 4]], had abandoned him at birth, having no emotional attachment whatsoever to her newborn child.&lt;ref name="OriginsP-ZH"&gt;''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 4) #77 (February 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, he was cared for by robots and given almost no contact with other living people, developing no social skills. Having created a method of traveling back to the 20th century, leading to the Legion's rescue of [[Lar Gand|Valor]], Brainiac 5 was arrested for unauthorized time-travel. He was later pardoned when [[R.J. Brande]] became President of the United Planets.

In addition to having a crush on Andromeda, Brainiac 5 had a secret stash of lustful holo-collection featuring Andromeda herself, [[Nura Nal|Dreamer (Nura Nal)]], [[Ayla Ranzz|Spark (Ayla Ranzz)]] and another fellow legionary whose alias begins with "In-" (obviously [[Invisible Kid|Invisible Kid (Lyle Norg)]]), and probably others.&lt;ref name="Legion-1-31"&gt;''Legion'' (vol. 1) #31 (May 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Before that, in a moment of rare emotional outburst, Brainy kisses Lyle's cheek as he finds him again, and right after he feels embarrassed.&lt;ref name="Legion-1-27"&gt;''Legion'' (vol. 1) #27 (January 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trapped in the 20th century====
Brainiac 5 was one of a number of Legionnaires who were trapped in the 20th century. He spent his efforts then trying to find a way back to his own time using 20th century equipment. He finally produced a computer capable of doing this, utilizing a 30th Century Omnicom, a [[New Gods]] [[Mother Box]] loaned to him by [[Metron (comics)|Metron]] and the responsometer of [[Will Magnus|Veridium]] of the [[Metal Men]]. Unfortunately, this became the post-Zero Hour C.O.M.P.U.T.O. The Legion had to defeat it and separate it into its component pieces before returning to their own time. While in the 20th century, he also encountered his ancestors, Brainiac and [[Vril Dox]] II, as well as the post-Crisis Supergirl. Ironically, he was attracted to Supergirl due to her similarity to Andromeda (some stories suggested that Brainiac 5's attraction for tall blonde women was linked to his desire to find his mother, a tall blonde who had abandoned him at birth).&lt;ref name="OriginsP-ZH"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Legion of Super-Heroes'' vol. 4 #108 (Sept. 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
[[Image:Brainiac 5 PostZero2.png|thumb|right|190px|Brainiac 5.1]]--&gt;

====Upgrade: Brainiac 5.1====
Upon his return, he was part of a team that investigated a mysterious space anomaly. The anomaly "upgraded" him: he was now more considerate of others, and had vastly improved people skills. He also internalized his force shield apparatus. Following his return from the space anomaly, a friendship was formed with his teammate [[Gates (comics)|Gates]], who dubbed the improved Querl Dox "Brainiaon investigated the criminal/terrorist organization called the [[Dark Circle]]. Querl learned his mother, [[Brainiac 4]], was the leader of the Dark Circle, having found that mass destruction was the only thing capable of making her feel emotions.&lt;ref name="Motherleader"&gt;''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 4) #108 (September 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; The shock of this almost caused him to revert to his former, distant self. Although he did not revert, he began to be somewhat sarcastic and impatient again. He also began researching without considering the consequences again, inadvertently transforming the team into a "[[Bizarro]] Legion".&lt;ref name="BizarroLegion"&gt;''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 4) #114–115&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Legion Lost''====
{{Main|Legion Lost}}
Brainiac 5.1 was amongst the Legionnaires who were cast into a distant galaxy when the Stargate network was shut down. They spent a year travelling through the "Lost Galaxy". During this time, he felt a great amount of stress, as his teammates all believed he could devise a way of getting them home in addition to all the other responsibilities forced upon him by the circumstances of their situation. As he eventually confessed to [[Saturn Girl]], he did not have a clue how to get them home - or even where "home" was, relative to their location. In the same conversation, he also complained that he'd "always hated [his] name upgrade," and on the way out, as well as reassuring him, she made a point of redubbing him "Brainiac '''Five'''," and he dropped the ".1" from his name thereafter.&lt;ref name="pointdrop"&gt;''Legion Lost'' #9 (January 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, using his teammate [[Shikari (comics)|Shikari]]'s tracking skills and an interdimensional doorway they'd earlier found, but been forced to leave, he did get them home. Upon their return, Brainiac began developing a replacement for the Stargates, based on the "threshold" doorway they had used to return from the Lost Galaxy. Restoring the connection to the planet Xanthu, they learned that it had been at war with Robotica, the "robot homeworld", until they mysteriously disappeared. Robotica's leader was revealed as C.O.M.P.U.T.O. A strike team was launched against it, but Brainiac 5 tricked it into upgrading itself, so it no longer sought vengeance.&lt;ref name="computobeat"&gt;''The Legion'' #14 (January 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; It was revealed that the Coluans disapproved of artificial intelligence, however, and Brainiac 5 was made a pariah on his homeworld for saving machine-life from destruction.&lt;ref name="Outcast"&gt;''The Legion'' #15 (February 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Please do not re-add the B5/Invisible Kid stuff as its just fan research/theory!--&gt;

===DC One Million===
{{Main|DC One Million}}
During the Reboot Legion's heyday, they are tangentially involved in the DC One Million crossover, where the audience is shown the "Justice Legion L" of the 853rd Century. Loosely based on members of the Legion of the 31st Century, the Justice Legion L are tasked with protecting the remains of the United Planets, by that point reduced to a small system of worlds joined together by a powerful magnetic core centered on [[Braal (planet)|Braal]]. Several of the planets involved had actually merged to form new, symbiotic worlds, including Colu-Bgztl. The Justice Legion L includes Brainiac 417, a counterpart to Brainiac 5 who is from this particular combined world: Brainiac 417. As with all members of his race, he combines super-intelligence with an ephemeral, intangible state; Brainiac 417 appears to be a shimmering green brain inside a transparent humanoid body. His race are purported to have become beings of pure intelligence and thought. Brainiac 417 is not the leader of the Justice Legion L (that duty fell to [[Cosmic Boy|Cosmicbot]]), but is one of the most valuable members, and is shown to have integrated his technologies to the point where he can jump back a thousand years to recruit an earlier version of [[Superboy]] for the purposes of saving the day.

==="Threeboot" continuity (2004-2009)===
{{Main|Legion of Super-Heroes (2004 team)}}
[[File:Brainiac5.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover to ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 5) #1 (2005).&lt;br&gt; Art by Barry Kitson]]
In volume 5 of the ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' title, Brainiac 5 is portrayed as similar to his ancestor [[Vril Dox II]] in ''[[L.E.G.I.O.N.]]''. He is just as arrogant and unthinking of others as the previous version was initially, but is more politically savvy. He has a tendency to put plans in motion without consulting Legion leader [[Cosmic Boy]], who suspects him of planning a coup. He also has problems with [[Nura Nal|Dream Girl]] as he hates that she is able to predict the future without scientific means. "Brainy" was also unnerved when she told him that they would one day marry. When she was killed during Terror Firma's attack on the Legion HQ on Earth, he became obsessed with "outthinking death." In a botched experiment to restore her to life, he however manages to store her consciousness in his own subconscious mind, enabling the girl to interact with him in his dreams, and keep using her precognition in his behalf. Following Cosmic Boy's disappearance, Brainiac 5 has become the advisor to Legion leader [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] and later to Lightning Lad.

Brainiac 5 eventually proposes to Dream Girl after spending the night together in which Dream Girl inhabited the body of a spiritualist, however, on the same night, [[Princess Projectra]] has her own urges and primal, repressed emotion, viciously attack Dream Girl upon her return to Querl's mind, viciously beating her and gouging out her eyes, leaving the girl blind and powerless, thus hoping to strip Brainiac 5 of her constant counseling.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Legion of Super-Heroes'' #47 (December 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; He much later manages to turn their dream into reality when, forced to rebuild new bodies for his teammates, mangled to shreds by a race of digitalized aliens while connected to the [[cyberspace]], creates a new body for Dream Girl, imprinting her personality, into the cloned body. Successful in his attempt, that, despite Nura's previsions, even restored her lost sight, Brainiac 5 happily extends to all the legionnaires his invitation to their marriage, holding hands with his resurrected soon-to-be bride &lt;ref&gt;''Legion of Super-Heroes'' #50 (March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Unbeknownst to Brainiac 5, the ''dark side'' of his mind, the avatar of his repressed urges and dark feelings, was granted a physical
body by Princess Projectra and sent to the physical body.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

===Post-Infinite Crisis (2007)===
The events of the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' miniseries have apparently restored a close analogue of the Pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] Legion to continuity, as seen in "[[The Lightning Saga]]" story arc in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' and ''[[Justice Society of America]]'', and in the "[[Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes (comics)|Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes]]" story arc in ''[[Action Comics]]''.  This incarnation of the Legion shares roughly the same history as the original Legion up to the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.comics.ign.com/articles/828/828574p1.html IGN: Superman/Green Lantern interview]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/69gBLotjr?url=http://uk.comics.ign.com/articles/828/828574p1.html |date=2012-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The Lightning Saga''====
{{Main|The Lightning Saga}}
The original Brainiac 5 from the Pre-Crisis universe briefly appeared in the Justice League/Justice Society ''Lightning Saga'' crossover. He was revealed as the mastermind behind the Legion's plot to return to the 21st century to retrieve someone connected to [[Flash (comics)|the Flash]]. At the end of the storyline, Brainiac 5 was seen holding one of the lightning rods the Legionnaires used on 21st century [[Earth]], and told his teammates that the Legion had gotten what it came for.  This Brainiac 5's agenda does not end there, however; in the pages of ''[[Countdown (DC Comics)|Countdown]]'', [[Triplicate Girl|Una]] arrived in the present to stop [[Val Armorr|Karate Kid]] from returning to the 31st century, explaining that Brainiac 5 says the two of them have another mission in the present day.

====''Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes''====
{{Main|Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes}}
In this follow-up story to the Lightning Saga (Taking place in [[Action Comics]] #858-863), Brainiac 5 is masquerading as a tyrannical dictator of Colu, but only to delay Colu, which is the strategical beachhead of a United Planets attack on Earth, and keep them from completing their calculations. Brainiac still possesses the Lightning Rod, and states that the person inside is crucial to stopping the "Crisis of the 31st century". However, his ruse is discovered, and Brainiac leaves with the Legion, with only four hours until the United Planets go to war.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' #862 (March 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; After Superman and the Legion defeat [[Kirt Niedrigh|Earthman]] and his "Justice League of Earth", and convince the armada to stand down, Brainiac 5 tells Superman that the Legion will not forget him this time.

====''Final Crisis: Legion of Three Worlds''====
{{Main|Final Crisis: Legion of Three Worlds}}
In this [[Final Crisis]] tie-in, Brainiac 5 is driven to the breaking point after being banished by Colu, and by Earth's continued xenophobia. He considers leaving the Legion, but is convinced to remain as a way to prove all his naysayers wrong. When [[Superboy-Prime]] attacks [[Takron-Galtos]] and frees the [[Legion of Super-Villains]], Brainiac 5 informs his fellow Legionnaires of his plan to recruit their post-''Zero Hour'' and "Threeboot" selves to help.&lt;ref&gt;''Final Crisis: Legion of Three Worlds'' #1 (August 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; His plan succeeds, and Brainiac meets his alternate selves from two other realities. The "Threeboot" version of Brainiac refuses to work with his older self, due to his rebellious nature, while the post-''Zero Hour'' version sees his older counterpart as wiser and more experienced, and tries to mediate between his alternate selves.&lt;ref&gt;''Final Crisis: Legion of Three Worlds'' #2 (October 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their differences, all three versions of Brainiac 5 work together to set in motion the final phases of the original Brainiac's master contingency plan against Superboy-Prime. This plan, which involved the resurrections of Superboy-Prime foes [[Bart Allen]]/Kid Flash (whose essence was in the lightning rod) and [[Connor Kent]]/Superboy, was devised long ago when Brainiac 5 was forewarned of Prime's arrival by one of Dream Girl's prophesies.

===The New 52===
Brainiac 5 seems to be largely unaffected by the changes of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' miniseries, as is true for the Legion of Super-Heroes as a whole.  However, the term "Brainiac" is no longer his name but an honorable title.&lt;ref&gt;''Legion: Secret Origin'' #2 (November 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  This adds understanding to the opening arcs of ''Action Comics'' vol. 2 (2011) by Grant Morrison, where an alien is stealing and bottling cities, an act usually committed by Brainiac, but is only named "the Collector".

===Rebirth===
A younger Brainiac 5 appears briefly during ''Justice League'' vol. 3 (2017) by Bryan Hitch, though unconnected to the Legion. He is also not referred to by his name, only as the "brainy kid" by Cyborg. After analyzing the Timeless technology with specialized contacts, he lends Cyborg his prototype flight bracelet, marked with the Brainiac sigil, so the League member can reach the weapon.

Brainiac 5 possesses a twelfth level intellect which grants him superhuman calculation skills, amazing memory and exceptional technical knowledge. By comparison, 20th century Earth as a whole constitutes a sixth level intellect, and most of his fellow Coluans have an eighth level intellect. 31st century Earth as a whole is a ninth level intellect. His incredible memory allows him to retain knowledge of events that all other characters forget such as the first meeting of the three different Legions.&lt;ref&gt;''Legion of Three Worlds'' #3 (April 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Post-''Zero Hour'' version of Brainiac 5 was shown in several issues to be able to ponder twelve lines of thought simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;''Legion of Super-Heroes'' #107 (Aug. 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; When a renegade Titanian read his mind, she discovered that his subconscious — usually the more active and chaotic part of the mind — was less active than his twelve simultaneous conscious thoughts.  Whether any other version of Brainiac also exhibits this trait remains to be seen.&lt;ref name="OriginsP-ZH"/&gt;

===Equipment===
Since Brainiac 5 processes a super intelligent mind, his main method of aiding himself and his fellow Legionnaires has always been through devices he himself invented. His primary role in any version of the Legion has always been that of the scientist. One of his most important inventions is the [[Legion Flight Ring]], which he has either invented or had a significant role in creating over the various versions of the Legion.&lt;ref&gt;''Legion of Super-Heroes'' #267 (Sept. 1980)&lt;/ref&gt; Another invention, which has proved invaluable to him, is the [[Force field (science fiction)|force field]] belt which has remained his main method of self-defense in cases where he found himself in battle in every version of the Legion.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

In recent issues of ''The Legion of Super Heroes'', Brainiac 5's force field belt, one of his signature inventions, has now been relegated to one of the predecessors of the title, with Brainiac 5 calling the invention an irreplaceable piece of his family history. {{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In various storylines, another invention of his has been the super-computer C.O.M.P.U.T.O. This machine has been included in most versions of the Legion, but always reworked in the storyline to suit the situation required. Brainiac 5 modified the "[[Time Sphere]]" to create the "[[Time Sphere|Time Bubble]]" he used it to time travel to send or bring other DC characters to and from the 31st century. Other methods of travel that have not involved time travel have included devices such as the developments on the Threshold technology{{Issue|date=November 2008}} and the wormhole-conduit teleporter.{{Issue|date=November 2008}}

Not all of Brainiac 5's inventions have proved useful to the Legion. Both versions of C.O.M.P.U.T.O. each proved to be among Brainiac 5's worst mistakes. While not a product of his own research but rather stolen data, Brainiac 5.1 also managed to create [[Bizarro]] versions of many of the Legion members.{{Issue|date=November 2008}}

==In other media==
===Television===
* Brainiac 5 made a non-voiced cameo appearance in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''. In the episode "New Kids In Town", he chats with teammate, [[Triplicate Girl]]. At the time of his debut it was unclear if he, in fact, used his given name or had any connections to Brainiac. However, his costume included a chest symbol comprising three circles forming an inverted triangle. This closely resembled the discs on the animated Brainiac's forehead (and his icon when he was a computer program), suggesting some kind of connection between them. It was revealed on commentary on the ''Superman: The Animated Series'' Vol. 3 DVD box set that this character was in fact Brainiac 5.
* Brainiac 5 appears in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', voiced by [[Matt Czuchry]]. Like his comic book counterpart, Brainiac 5 wears his trademark force field belt, which protects him from the Fatal Five's attack. It is revealed that Brainiac learned to pass its code biologically and created Brainiac 5 as an organic being. Unfortunately for Brainiac, Brainiac 5 rejected evil and joined the [[Legion of Super Heroes]]. In the episode "Far From Home," he brings [[Green Arrow]], [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]], and [[John Stewart (comics)|Green Lantern]] into the future to help him battle the [[Fatal Five]]. In the short time after meeting each other, Brainiac 5 and Supergirl fall in love. After the Fatal Five are defeated, Supergirl chooses to remain in the future with him and the Legion. Back in the present, [[Superman]] receives a holographic message explaining why Supergirl stayed, stating "I met this boy..." The episode ended with Superman asking who this boy is.
* Brainiac 5 appears in ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Adam Wylie]]. He is a core member of the Legion of Super Heroes. This version is Coluan, a nano-based cybernetic organism that not only possesses 12th-level intelligence, but can assume a human-like form. His human-like form can also alter its shape to create tools and weapons or transform into a large, battle robot form, much like the reboot Legion member, Gear. His AI core is based on the original Brainiac 1.0 from whom he tries to distance himself as best as possible. Unlike many versions where he is portrayed as cold and unfeeling, this version is considerably more emotional. In the first season, he often appears eager to prove himself to his older teammates, particularly the original Superman; Brainiac 5, unlike his villainous ancestor, idolizes Superman. However, his high intellect and his emotional nature often cause him internal conflict; for example, he idolizes Superman, but knows intellectually that he cannot reveal many of the things he knows lie in the future for Superman once he is returned to his own time, as Superman's knowledge of his future events could change what is, for the Legion, history. In the second-season episodes "Chained Lightning" and "Message in a Bottle," Brainiac 5 grows close to [[Salu Digby|Shrinking Violet]]; however, as the series ended it remains unknown if this was an intended romance or not. He seems to have feelings for Superman himself, because of the simulation he produced that involved him and Superman shown at the premiere of season two and many other incidents in the series. In the second-season premiere, Superman X (a clone of Superman from the 41st century) hints that someday Brainiac 5 will be responsible for something terrible in the future. The starting phase occurs in "Message in a Bottle," when Brainiac 5 was forced to tap into the data of Brainiac who had been observing Brainiac 5 since he came online. Brainiac 5 travels within himself to meet with his ancestor, where he is offered data from the original Brainiac. Brainiac 5 forcefully accepts the "gift" of data he needed to stop [[Imperiex]] from his ancestor who hinted it to "open new avenues of possibilities." Soon after using the info he obtained to save Kandor and restore it to original size, Brainiac 5 begins to suffer data corruption as Imperiex intended from the start, becoming cold and unfeeling in the process. Once completely under his ancestor's influence during the "Dark Victory" series finale, Brainiac 5 assumes a new form in homage to his ancestor and leaves the Legion to join Imperiex's army, taking command after killing Imperiex. Once overpowering the hivemind on his homeworld of [[Colu]] with his will, Brainiac 5 intends to bring "order" to the universe, destroying any who interfere. Thanks to Superman and Superman X, Brainiac 5 managed to regain control over himself and overpower his ancestor. In the process, Brainiac 5 becomes a pure organic being as he discards his robotic armor. To cope with this new state and his recent actions, Brainiac 5 leaves the Legion. The robotic parts, in turn, combine to form a new evil Brainiac, leaving the series with a cliffhanger, which was intended to finish until the show was canceled.
* Brainiac 5 appears in the ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' live-action series. In the season eight episode "Legion," [[Clark Kent]] and three Legionnaires ([[Lightning Lad]], [[Saturn Girl]], and [[Cosmic Boy]]) extract Brainiac from [[Chloe Sullivan]]'s body, leaving his [[nanobot]]s a condensed ball of metal, attempting to repurpose any programming they can use from the core to be friendlier. Brainiac 5 appears in the season ten episode "Homecoming," visiting Clark to show the past, present and future and help Clark come to terms with the darkness in his own heart in preparation for an upcoming confrontation with [[Darkseid]]. Actor [[James Marsters]], who portrayed Brainiac in ''Smallville'', returned to play Brainiac 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2010/07/26/smallville-season-10-spoilers-comic-con/ | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100727052031/http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2010/07/26/smallville-season-10-spoilers-comic-con/ | dead-url= yes | archive-date= 27 July 2010 | title= Exclusive video: 'Smallville' execs, Erica Durance drop major S10 intel and weigh in on an 11th | date= 26 July 2010 | last= Ausiello | first= Michael | work= Entertainment Weekly | accessdate= 2 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brainiac 5's character has been described by producers as "a slippery fish with a questionable moral compass" despite the reprogramming.

[[File:Jesse Rath -Defiance Panel (cropped).jpg|thumb|200px|[[Jesse Rath]] plays Brainiac 5 in the third season of ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'']]
* Brainiac 5 appeared in the third season of ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', portrayed by [[Jesse Rath]], as a member of the Legion of Superheroes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2017/11/06/supergirl-brainiac-5-legion-super-heroes-jesse-rath/ |title=Supergirl Casts the Legion's Brainiac 5 With Defiance Alum Jesse Rath |last=Mitovich |first=Matt Webb |publisher=[[TVLine]] |date=November 6, 2017 |accessdate=November 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was first mentioned only as Querl in the seventh episode, "Wake Up," by [[Mon-El]]. However, in his subsequent apparences, he is referred to as "Brainy" by his fellow Legionnaires, Mon-El and [[Imra Ardeen]]. In the season finale, his home time period has become uninhabitable and stays in the 21st century. Rath was promoted to series regular for season four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tvline.com/2018/06/15/supergirl-season-4-jesse-rath-series-regular-brainy/ |title=Supergirl Promotes Jesse Rath to Series Regular for Season 4 |website=TVLine |first=Andy |last=Swift |date=June 15, 2018|accessdate=June 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video games===
* Brainiac 5 is mentioned in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' in [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]]'s ending where Superman's defeat has the opposite effect for Ares and is further weakened by the ensuing peace to which Ares imprisons Brainiac 5 and forces him to create a time loop of the game's events creating a never ending cycle of conflict which Ares can feed off of forever.
* Brainiac 5 makes a cameo appearance in ''[[Injustice 2]]'', voiced by [[Liam O'Brien]]. If Brainiac is used in the game's arcade mode - in which Brainiac is the end boss - it is revealed at the end that the player character was actually Brainiac 5, who went back in time to fix the fear people had of the Coluan race in the future by defeating Brainiac and impersonating his ancestor. He returns to the 31st century where the Legion of Super Heroes confront him over his actions, but they are still proud to be on their side.

'''Bulbasaur''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ʌ|l|b|ə|ˌ|s|ɔː|r}}), known as {{nihongo|'''Fushigidane'''|フシギダネ|}} in Japan,&lt;ref name=fushi&gt;{{cite book|title=Communication Yearbook 27|first=Pamela|last=Kalbfleisch|isbn=0-8058-4819-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGrbK6_3KeEC|page=173|publisher=International Communication Association|accessdate=April 20, 2009|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is the first [[List of Pokémon|Pokémon species]] in [[Nintendo]] and [[Game Freak]]'s ''[[Pokémon]]'' franchise. Designed by [[Atsuko Nishida]],&lt;ref name="Origin"/&gt; its name is a combination of the words "bulb" and "dinosaur." First appearing in [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pokémon Red'' and ''Green'']] as a [[Gameplay of Pokémon#Starter Pok.C3.A9mon|Starter Pokémon]], it later appeared in subsequent sequels, spin-off games, related merchandise, and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise.

Known as the Seed Pokémon, Bulbasaur can survive for days solely on sunlight. It is a central character in [[Pokémon (anime)|the anime]], being one of [[Ash Ketchum|Ash]]'s main Pokémon for the first season, and a different one later being obtained by [[May (Pokémon)|May]]. It is featured in various manga, and is owned by protagonist [[Red (Pokémon Adventures)|Red]] in the ''[[Pokémon Adventures]]'' manga. Bulbasaur has been featured in myriad pieces of merchandise, including toys, key chains, and plush dolls.

==Conception and design==
Bulbasaur was designed by [[Atsuko Nishida]], one of the character designers for [[Pokémon Red and Green|''Pocket Monsters Red'' and ''Green'']], who based its design on [[Venusaur]].&lt;ref name="Origin"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/creator-profile-the-creators-of-pikachu/ |title=Creator Profile: The Creators of Pikachu|website=NA website of Pokémon|publisher=The Pokémon Company International|quote=Sugimori: “Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle were all designed by Ms. Nishida.” ; Nishida: “I created the designs for Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle by working backward from their final forms. I wanted people to be surprised when it evolved into Charizard, so I designed the original Charmander in such a way that Charizard would be unimaginable.”}}&lt;/ref&gt; The species first appeared as one of three [[Gameplay of Pokémon#Starter Pok.C3.A9mon|starter Pokémon]] the player could choose from at the beginning of the initial [[Game Boy]] games, [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'']], released in [[Japan]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="MacDonald"&gt;MacDonald, Mark; Brokaw, Brian; Arnold; J. Douglas; Elies, Mark. Pokémon Trainer's Guide. Sandwich Islands Publishing, 1999. {{ISBN|0-439-15404-9}}. (pg 192–195)&lt;/ref&gt; Its Japanese name, ''Fushigidane'', is a combination of the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] words for {{nihongo|''mystery'' or ''miracle'' || fushigi|}} and {{nihongo|''seed'' || tane}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Anime Explosion!: The What? Why? &amp; Wow! of Japanese Animation]]  |last=Drazen |first=Patrick |year=2003 |publisher=Stone Bridge Press, LLC |location= St. Paul, MN |isbn=1-880656-72-8 |page=321 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In translating the game for [[English language|English speaking]] audiences, [[Nintendo]] gave the Pokémon "cleverly descriptive names" related to their appearance or features as a means to make the characters more relatable to American children; thus ''Bulbasaur'', relating to both its dinosaur appearance and the large garlic-shaped bulb on its back.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/1122/cover2.html|title=PokéMania|last=Chua-Euan|first=Howard|date=November 22, 1999|publisher=TIME|accessdate=September 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--[[French language|French]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Taiwanese Minnan|Taiwan]] and [[Chinese language]] counterparts used names relating closer to the original name: ''Bulbizarre'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smashbros.com/fr/gamemode/various/various36_list.html Liste des trophées -- Smash Bros.

[[German language|German]] versions used a name closer to the American counterpart, ''Bisasam''; a combination of ''bisamratte'' ([[musk rat]]) and ''samen'' (seed).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smashbros.com/de/gamemode/various/various36_list.html Liste aller Trophäen -- Smash Bros. DOJO], ''Nintendo'', May 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; ---&gt; &lt;!--Does it really matter what it is called in these languages?---&gt; The idea to feature Bulbasaur and the other ''Red'' and ''Green'' starters in a significant role in [[Pokémon X and Y|''Pokémon X'' and ''Y'']] came about a year and a half into the development of the games. The Mega Evolutions for the three Pokémon's final forms were created, and the designers decided that they should give players an opportunity to receive one of these Pokémon from Professor Sycamore, the games professor, to see their Mega Evolved form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pokemon X/Y: WHY?!

==Reception and legacy==
[[IGN]] named Bulbasaur the "52nd best" Pokémon. IGN author Audrey Drake noted that she had a "very special attachment" to it due to it being her first Pokémon. She also stated that it may be her "favorite".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bulbasaur - #52 Top Pokémon |url=http://www.ign.com/top/pokemon/52 |work=[[IGN]] |last=Drake |first=Audrey |accessdate=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]'' also included it in its list of the best Pokémon at #3 (along with Charmander and Squirtle). Author O'Dell Harmon noted the choice between these three Pokémon as the "most important" one in the series' history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Top 50 Pokémon Of All Time |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2012/11/21/top-50-poke.aspx?PostPageIndex=5&amp;PageIndex=7 |work=[[Game Informer]] |last=Harmon |first=O'Dell |date=November 21, 2012 |accessdate=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Game Revolution called Bulbasaur the "best Pokémon ever". Author Alex Osborn stated that it "embodies the charm that makes Pokémon what it is" and called it his "personal favourite".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=21 Greatest Pokémon of All Time |url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/features/7-greatest-pokmon-of-all-time#/slide/21 |work=Game Revolution |last=Osborn |first=Alex |date=February 22, 2013 |accessdate=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow Game Revolution editor Daniel Bischoff noted it as his "favourite Pokémon" as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tell GR: Which Is Your Favorite Pokémon Of All Time? |url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/manifesto/tell-gr-which-is-your-favorite-pokmon-of-all-time-21857 |work=Game Revolution |last=Bischoff |first=Daniel |date=October 1, 2013 |accessdate=March 2, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821040745/http://www.gamerevolution.com/manifesto/tell-gr-which-is-your-favorite-pokmon-of-all-time-21857 |archivedate=August 21, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nintendo World Report's Pedro Hernandez also called it his "favourite" Pokémon. He noted that it "represented" a number of "firsts" for him - including his "first episode" of the ''Pokémon'' anime, his "first Pokémon", and the "first Pokémon" he "saw in 3D." He also attributes Bulbasaur to the reason he became interested in the ''Pokémon'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Top 5 Pokémon: Pedro's Picks |url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/feature/25502/top-5-pokemon-pedros-picks |work=Nintendo World Report |last=Hernandez |first=Pedro |date=March 1, 2011 |accessdate=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]''{{'}}s John Vekinis attributed his "love of Grass-type Pokémon" to Bulbasaur in spite of the Grass type's weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Top five Pokemon Types |url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/53177/blog/top-five-pokemon-types/?page=5| work=[[Official Nintendo Magazine]] |last=Vekinis |first=John |date=August 10, 2013 |accessdate=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Official Nintendo Magazine'' readers voted Bulbasaur as the "second best" Grass-type Pokémon.

In an [[IGN]] biography page, Bulbasaur is described as "the odd man out" in the [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'']] game because it represented neither color, thought added "it’s perhaps the best-known grass-type Pokémon, even though it’s a little bit more animal than vegetable", as well as noting its popularity with new players of the games.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310000528/http://stars.ign.com/objects/143/14349860_biography.html|archivedate=March 10, 2012|url=http://stars.ign.com/objects/143/14349860_biography.html|title=Bulbasaur Biography|publisher=IGN|accessdate=September 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] editor "Pokémon of the Day Chick" agreed, despite the fact its later evolutions were "slightly eclipsed by Charizard", and also praised the anime incarnation for its attitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faqs.ign.com/articles/380/380258p1.html|title=Pokemon Crystal Version - Pokemon of the Day: Bulbasaur (#1)|website=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GamesRadar]] editor Brett Elston described Bulbasaur as being "popular" for more than just being the first Pokémon numerically, citing its moveset and evolutions.&lt;ref name="bulbasaurgr"/&gt; Fellow GamesRadar editor Carolyn Gudmundson, in an article on the "top 7 gut-wrenching choices", listed the choice between fire, grass, or water with Bulbasaur as a "frontrunner", due to being a dinosaur as well as being grass type, though found its later evolutions "ugly and charmless".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/f/the-top-7-gut-wrenching-choices/a-2009050410717660001/p-4/c-1?newest|title=The Top 7... gut-wrenching choices|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a panel of five-to-eight-year-olds assembled by the ''[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]'' in 1999, Bulbasaur was one of the children's "three favorite Pokémon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/1999/04/26/features/story1.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990508192305/http://starbulletin.com/1999/04/26/features/story1.html |archivedate=May 8, 1999 |title=Pokémon An Adult's Guide from a Kid's Perspective |accessdate=May 2, 2008 |last=Shimabukuro |first=Betty |date=April 26, 1999 |publisher=Honolulu Star-Bulletin}}&lt;/ref&gt; One boy in a study by Dafna Lemish and Linda Renee-Bloch identified with Bulbasaur's attributes of being "strong and also cute". Lemish and Renee-Bloch feel that the importance of cuteness is an example of the "appropriation of Japanese values" in an Israeli context, and note that boys' desire for strength has been correlated with "a desire for social interaction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=U7hthImoc5AC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA181#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Pikachu's Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pokémon|first=Joseph|last=Tobin|date=February 5, 2004|publisher=Duke University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9063">'''Capital punishment''' in Montenegro was first prescribed by law in 1798. It was abolished on 19 June 2002. The last execution, by shooting, took place on 29 January 1981, and the two last death sentences were pronounced on 11 October 2001. Montenegro is bound by the following international conventions prohibiting capital punishment (dates of ratification are given in parentheses): [[Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (6 September 2001), as well as Protocols [http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/html/114.htm No. 6] and [http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/html/187.htm No. 13] to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (3 March 2004). According to Art. 26 of the Montenegrin [http://sr.wikisource.org/sr/%D0%A3%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B2_%D0%A6%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B5_%D0%93%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B5 Constitution] (2007): „In Montenegro, capital punishment is forbidden”.

== History ==

=== Montenegro, 1798-1914 ===
Until 1851, Montenegro was a theocracy, ruled by an Orthodox Bishop and a Senate, composed of representatives of Montenegrin tribes, which enjoyed a full autonomy. The first written law was passed in 1789 (and amended in 1803), during the rule of Bishop Peter I. It prescribed the death penalty for murder and treason and allowed three modes of execution: hanging, shooting and stoning.&lt;ref name="Zakonik"&gt;''Zakonik obšči crnogorski i brdski. Zakonik Danila Prvog''[''The General Code of Montenegro and the Hills. The Code of Danilo the First''], facsimile edition, 1982, p. xxviii&lt;/ref&gt;  The shooting was performed by representatives of all tribes (at times, several hundred men), in order to prevent the blood revenge by the offender's tribe.&lt;ref name="karadzic"&gt;Karadžić, Vuk (1969). Sabrana dela [Collected Works], XVIII. Belgrade. p. 656.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although not prescribed by law, capital punishment was also applied to thieves. According to historical sources, „a thief was hanged and a murderer shot“ in 1831.&lt;ref name="karadzic"/&gt;  In 1839/1840, „about 20 criminals“ were executed.&lt;ref name="Popovic"&gt;Popović, Petar (1951). ''Crna Gora u doba Petra I i Petra II'' [''Montenegro in the times of Petar I and Peter II''], Belgrade. p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; 
After Montenegro became a secular Princedom, a new penal code was adopted in 1855 (The Prince Danilo's Code). It prescribed capital punishment for some 18 offenses, including murder, treason, offences against the dignity of the Prince (lese-majesty), various forms of theft, and refusal to pay tax.&lt;ref name="Zakonik" /&gt;  A man who kills his wife and/or her lover having found them in an act of adultery (in flagrante) was exempt from all punishment. The legal mode of execution was shooting, but only for men. Women could not be shot (as it would „soil the rifles“), but were to be hanged, drowned or stoned instead. Executions of women were extremely rare – one documented case involved a woman stoned for murdering her husband in 1854.&lt;ref name= "Bojovic"&gt;Bojović, Jovan (1982). ''Zakonik knjaza Danila'' [''Prince Danilo's Code''], Titograd, p.49.&lt;/ref&gt;
The first modern Penal Code, adopted in 1906, prescribed capital punishment for more than twenty offenses.&lt;ref name="Zakonik2"&gt;''Krivični zakonik za Knjaževinu Crnu Goru'' [''Penal Code for the Princedom of Montenegro''], Cetinje 1906.&lt;/ref&gt;  Execution was by shooting, performed by a firing squad of ten soldiers. The true number of death sentences and executions prior to 1914 is not known, but it was small: on the average, one or two executions per year. An exception to this were two political trials in 1908 and 1909, when 13 persons accused of conspiring against the government were sentenced to death (nine were executed).

=== Yugoslavia, 1918–1941 ===
When Yugoslavia was created in 1918, different legal systems remained in force in different parts of the new country. In the north-western provinces (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia and Vojvodina), executions were by hanging in an enclosed space with restricted public attendance. In the remainder of the country (Serbia, Kosovo, Montenegro and Macedonia), executions were by shooting and in public. When   a single Penal Code was introduced for the whole country (1929), hanging remained the only legal mode of execution, with the exception of sentences passed by military courts, which were executed by shooting.&lt;ref name="Jankovic" &gt;Janković, Ivan (2012). ''Na belom hlebu: Smrtna kazna u Srbiji, 1804–2002'' [''On white bread diet: The death penalty in Serbia 1804-2002'']. Belgrade. Ch.8-10&lt;/ref&gt;
Crimes punished by death were mostly murder and robbery leading to death, as well as terrorism. According to the official statistics, there were 14 death sentences and 5 executions in Montenegro from 1920 to 1940 (In the same period, in the whole of Yugoslavia there were 904 sentences and 291 executions).&lt;ref&gt;''Statistički godišnjaci Kraljevine SHS / Jugoslavije'' [''Statistical Yearbooks of the Kingdom SHS / Yugoslavia'']. Belgrade. 1921-1941.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Yugoslavia, 1945–1991 ===
In the first years after WWII, death sentences were passed in large numbers daily on collaborationists and war criminals, but also on the „enemies of the people“, i.e. all those who opposed the new communist regime. There are no reliable data, but it seems likely that in Yugoslavia until 1951 there were as many as 10,000 death sentences, a majority of which were executed. In Montenegro, there may have been several hundred death sentences, approximately two thirds of which were executed. In addition to political offences, capital crimes included the theft of the government property, as well as aggravated murder and robbery. Until 1959, executions were either by shooting or by hanging, as determined by the sentence of the court in each individual case, although hangings were considered as an aggravated form and were used less frequently. In the first post-war years, executions of major war criminals were often public. After 1950, the number of death sentences fell sharply. According to the official statistics, from 1950 to 1958 there were 229 death sentences in all of Yugoslavia, while in Montenegro there were only between ten and twenty.
The 1959 reforms resulted in a less strict system of criminal justice. Number of capital offences was reduced and capital punishment was abolished for property offences. Hanging was abolished and the only legal mode of execution remained shooting, performed by a platoon of eight policemen, only half of whom had rifles loaded with live ammunition. Executions could not be performed publicly. From 1959 to 1991, there were, on average, two or three executions per year in Yugoslavia. In the same 32-year period, there were fewer than ten executions in Montenegro.&lt;ref name=Jankovic /&gt;  The last execution in Montenegro took place in Kotor on 29 January 1981. The person executed was one Dragiša Ristić, sentenced to death for raping and murdering a minor.

=== Montenegro after 1991 ===
From April 1992, Serbia was a part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which consisted of two federal units – Serbia and Montenegro. From 1991 to 2002, Montenegrin courts passed 8 death sentences, none of which had been executed. The two last death sentences were passed by the Higher Court in Podgorica on Slavko Dević and Rade Arsović, convicted of murder.

== Abolition ==

=== Early attempts ===
In 1906, a pamphlet against capital punishment was published in Cetinje,  and in 1907 the minister of justice informed the Parliament that it was the Prince’s wish to have the death penalty abolished in Montenegro, except for treason.  However, no amendments to the Penal Code were made in the Parliament and the capital punishment remained in force.

=== Partial abolition, 1992 ===
Constitution of FR Yugoslavia (which consisted of Serbia and Montenegro), adopted on 25 April 1992, abolished capital punishment for federal crimes (including genocide, war crimes, political and military offences), but the federal units kept the right to prescribe capital punishment for crimes under their jurisdiction (murder and robbery). In the drafting of the Constitution, the proposal to abolish capital punishment came from the Montenegrin members of the Drafting Commission.

=== Final abolition, 2002 ===
On 19 June 2002, the Montenegrin Parliament amended the Penal Code by deleting from it all references to capital punishment. As was stressed in the parliamentary debate, a paramount motive for this abolition was the desire of the then FR Yugoslavia to join the Council of Europe.

==Signs and symptoms==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Re-created clock drawings from patients with left and right hemisphere damage, hemineglect, and dementia.png|thumb|]] --&gt;
A key deficit in constructional [[apraxia]] patients is the inability to correctly copy or draw an image. There are qualitative differences between patients with [[left hemisphere]] damage, [[right hemisphere]] damage, and [[Alzheimer's Disease]].&lt;ref name="Guérin 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Behrmann 2001"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Behrmann, Marlene |author2=Boller, François |author3=Grafman, Jordan |title=Disorders of visual behavior |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam |year=2001 |pages=99–118 |isbn=0-444-50360-9 |oclc=47703916 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Left hemisphere damage===

Patients with damage to their left hemisphere tend to preserve items, oversimplify drawing features&lt;ref name="Russell 2010"/&gt; and omit details when drawing from memory. In addition, left hemisphere patients are less likely to systematically arrange the parts of their drawing.&lt;ref name="Smith 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith AD, Gilchrist ID |title=Drawing from childhood experience: constructional apraxia and the production of oblique lines |journal=Cortex |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=195–204 |date=April 2005 |pmid=15714902 |doi=10.1016/S0010-9452(08)70894-3 |url=http://www.psychology.nottingham.ac.uk/staff/lpzas2/publications/Smith_Cortex_2005.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right hemisphere damage===

Patients with damage to their right hemisphere have trouble correctly replicating spatial relationships of complex figures. Drawing elements are often piecemeal, transposed to different positions or orientations, or shown diagonally on the page.&lt;ref name="Russell 2010"/&gt; As a result, right hemisphere patients tend to produce asymmetric or distorted drawings&lt;ref name="Smith 2005"/&gt; characterized by [[hemispatial neglect]], the omission of elements from one side of the model.&lt;ref name="Laeng 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Laeng B |title=Constructional apraxia after left or right unilateral stroke |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=44 |issue=9 |pages=1595–606 |year=2006 |pmid=16516249 |doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.01.023 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was once thought that right hemisphere patients were twice as likely to make mistakes in 3D construction tasks as left hemisphere patients but this inaccurate conclusion was attributable to participant selection bias in that researchers excluded from studies individuals with severe left hemisphere lesions due to the debilitating language impairments of those individuals. However, included in studies were individuals with severe right hemisphere lesions.&lt;ref name="Bonato et al 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bonato M, Sella F, Verteltti I, Umilta C |title=Neuropsychology is nothing with out control: A potential fallacy hidden in clinical studies |journal=Cortex |volume=48 |issue=6 |pages=353-355 |date=June 2011 |URL=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ilaria_Berteletti/publication/51515514_Neuropsychology_is_nothing_without_control_a_potential_fallacy_hidden_in_clinical_studies/links/0912f504e384591788000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent research has substantiated the absence of a marked difference in performance between left and right hemisphere patients on 3D construction tasks.&lt;ref name="Capruso 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Capruso DX |author2=Hamsher Kd |title=Constructional ability in two- versus three-dimensions: relationship to spatial vision and locus of cerebrovascular lesion |journal=Cortex |volume=47 |issue=6 |pages=696–705 |date=June 2011 |pmid=20547388 |doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2010.05.001 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alzheimer's disease===

[[Alzheimer's disease]] patients with constructional apraxia have unique symptoms. Their drawings contain fewer angles, spatial alterations, a lack of perspective and simplifications, which are uncharacteristic of left hemisphere or right hemisphere patients. Constructional disabilities are present early on in the disease and get progressively worse over time;&lt;ref name="Behrmann 2001"/&gt; however even patients with advanced Alzheimer's disease may be able to do some constructional tasks.&lt;ref name="Nielson 1996"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nielson KA, Cummings BJ, Cotman CW |title=Constructional apraxia in Alzheimer's disease correlates with neuritic neuropathology in occipital cortex |journal=Brain Res. |volume=741 |issue=1-2 |pages=284–93 |date=November 1996 |pmid=9001734 |doi=10.1016/S0006-8993(96)00983-3 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spontaneous drawing is affected early and is heavily dependent upon [[semantic]] memory; therefore simplifications in the drawing may be due to impaired access to semantic knowledge. As Alzheimer's disease progresses, the patient's ability to copy objects becomes increasingly impaired and they may lose the ability to correctly draw simple figures due to a motor loss in routine memories.&lt;ref name="Behrmann 2001"/&gt;

==Causes==
Constructional apraxia cannot be localized to a specific hemisphere or cerebral area because drawing and constructional tasks require both perceptual and motor functioning.&lt;ref name="Laeng 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Capruso 2011"/&gt; It has been linked to parietal lesions in the left and right hemisphere, [[stroke]] and Alzheimer's disease.

Initially, researchers tried to isolate the cause to left hemisphere lesions in the [[parietal lobe]] because of its similarities to [[Gerstmann syndrome]]; however, lesions in the [[dorsal stream]] also result in [[visual agnosia]] and a piecemeal drawing.&lt;ref name="Guérin 1999"/&gt; Although constructional apraxia can result from lesions in any part of the brain, it is most commonly associated with lesions in the parietal-occipital lobes. Constructional apraxia is common after right parietal stroke and it continues after visuospatial symptoms have subsided.&lt;ref name="Russell 2010"/&gt; Patients with posterior and parietal lobe lesions tend to have the most severe symptoms.&lt;ref name="Capruso 2011"/&gt;

In Alzheimer's disease research, the AT8 [[antibody]] has proven to be an early indicator of [[tau protein]] pathology. Constructional apraxia patients with the most AT8 pathology were least able to copy an image, while those best able to had the least [[senile plaque|neuritic pathology]]. Therefore, figure copying ability is highly correlated with Alzheimer's disease pathology.&lt;ref name="Nielson 1996"/&gt;

==Neurological mechanisms==

===Drawing===
As the study of constructional apraxia impairments narrows, research is concentrating on analyzing drawing abilities. Drawing abilities may be decomposed into three steps: visual perception, visual imagery, and graphic production.

According to the [[two-streams hypothesis]], as information exits the [[occipital lobe]] it follows two pathways. The dorsal stream ("where pathway") ends in the [[parietal lobe]] while the [[ventral stream]] ("what pathway") terminates in the temporal lobe.&lt;ref name="Laeng 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MilnerGoodale 1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Milner|first=A. David|title=The Visual Brain in Action|year=1995|isbn=0198521367|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Damage to the parietal lobe is highly correlated with constructional apraxia since it is involved in drawing and copying. The parietal lobe is also critical for remapping spatial position across [[saccades]].&lt;ref name="Russell 2010"/&gt; There is an attentional subsystem responsible for moving the eyes, head, and body to focus on different images. Damage at various levels of this system could lead to trouble localizing a stimulus or hemispatial neglect which manifests as perseverative errors on the drawing.&lt;ref name="Makuuchi 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Makuuchi M, Kaminaga T, Sugishita M |title=Both parietal lobes are involved in drawing: a functional MRI study and implications for constructional apraxia |journal=Brain Res Cogn Brain Res |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=338–47 |date=May 2003 |pmid=12706214 |doi=10.1016/S0926-6410(02)00302-6 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a couple theories used to describe the neurological mechanisms behind drawing.

====Kosslyn and Koeing model====
Kosslyn proposes that there is an early split of information in the dorsal stream. The first pathway captures coordinate relations by defining distances between points in space. These points become a continuum which can transform into other points through intermediate points. This coding of points would allow space to be perceived qualitatively, which would also help with movement.&lt;ref name="Laeng 2006"/&gt;

The other pathway encodes "categorical" information, which synthesizes information about the shape and spatial arrangement of an objects parts. It decomposes objects into their most basic form, by looking for boundaries, lines, or patches. These categorical relations in turn lead to abstract spatial relations that allow one to perceive objects as being "on top," "inside," "between," "beside," etc.&lt;ref name="Laeng 2006"/&gt;

====Van Sommers model====
The Van Sommers model describes two hierarchical systems for drawing: one for visual perception, another for graphic production. The visual perception model utilizes [[David Marr (neuroscientist)|David Marr]]'s three stage system to describe visual perception in copying. In the first stage, an image us represented in 2D based on changes in intensity. Foreground and background are not distinguished. In the second stage, a 2.5D representation is formed which encodes the object in a viewer-centered coordinate system. Finally a 3D object-centered representation is established making it possible to appreciate volume. Visual representations of familiar drawings are stored in memory. This representation sends feedback to the other areas of the brain which encoded the spatial and physical properties of the object. Feedback from these areas allows the drawer to successfully encode the coordinate and categorical relations.&lt;ref name="Guérin 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bouaziz Magnan 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bouaziz|first1=Serge|last2=Magnan|first2=Annie|title=Contribution of the visual perception and graphic production systems to the copying of complex geometrical drawings: A developmental study|journal=Cognitive Development|volume=22| issue=1|year=2007| pages=5–15| issn=0885-2014|doi=10.1016/j.cogdev.2006.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the graphic production model, the viewer begins by making a series of ''depiction decisions'' about the dimensions, amount of detail to include, etc. Depiction decisions are not used when copying a drawing because they're dictated by the situation. Next, the ''production strategy'' is formed. If the drawing is unfamiliar, then the drawer will divide and rank the different portions of the drawings. If the drawing is familiar (e.g. a sun), then the drawer will reproduce the item line by lie regardless of the pictures organization due to automatic execution. The third component, ''contingent planning,'' reflects the importance of planning in drawing. Contingent planning is a result of production strategy. If the drawing is unfamiliar and requires a segmented approach, then the most appropriate sequence is determined before the drawing. At this point, the drawing task becomes a problem solving task. The fourth and final component of the model refers to the ''[[articulation (anatomy)|articulatory]] and economic constraints'' placed on the drawer by using a pencil. Certain directions are favored due to the orientation of the hand and fingers, etc.  However, some feel the Van Sommers model does not adequately account for all aspects of drawing.&lt;ref name="Guérin 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bouaziz Magnan 2007"/&gt;

====Other theories====
Drawing from memory in response to a verbal order requires the image to be recalled from [[Semantic memory#Search of Associative Memory|associative memory]] and brought into the visual buffer. Once there, it can be successfully drawn and copied from memory. Familiar images (like the sun) may not require [[visual imagery]] to draw, as the production schemes and action programming stored in the associative memory and [[procedural memory]] may be sufficient to reproduce the drawing.

===Construction===
Construction problems are usually caused by [[visual perception]] deficits. They require normal vision and the ability to execute a series of motor activities. When looking at performance, it is important to consider perceptual and [[executive function]]ing. A patient with trouble visually recognizing patterns or spatial relations may have difficulty correctly building a model. In addition, problems planning, organizing, or carrying out action may impede the ability to solve a construction problem.&lt;ref name="Capruso 2011"/&gt;

== Neuropsychological mechanisms==

[[File:Re-created geometric drawings from patients with left and right hemisphere damage, hemineglect, and dementia.png|thumb|]]
Modern attempts to understand constructional apraxia have moved away from anatomical functions towards a cognitive neuropsychological approach. Both adults and children alike experience difficulty reproducing [[Angle#Types of angles|oblique]] lines. Some feel that these deficiencies may be attributed to planning since it is easier to plan horizontal and vertical lines than oblique lines. Research indicates that both adults and children are more able to draw squares than diamonds, although as children grow into adults they are more accurately able to depict diamonds.&lt;ref name="Smith 2005"/&gt;

One study showed that constructional apraxia patients were significantly less accurate than the control patients in producing angles with vertical and horizontal orientations. In this study, constructional apraxia patients drew patterns usually found in children 8 and younger. Gregory argues that [[ontogenetic]]ally and [[phylogenic]]ally earlier behavioral traits are present in the brain, but inhibited. When these inhibitory mechanisms become compromised, then the childlike behavior patterns re-emerge. Therefore, according to this theory, the inhibitory mechanisms in patients with constructional apraxia have failed, causing them to draw like young children who have difficulty drawing oblique lines.&lt;ref name="Smith 2005"/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Constructional disabilities are often tested by asking the patient to draw a 2D model or assemble an object. Some researchers feel that neuronal mechanisms involved in drawing and copying differ, thus they should be tested individually. Free drawing is a commonly used test in which the patient is asked to draw a named object. It can be an effective tool in measuring the patient's ability to maintain spatial relations, organize the drawing, and draw complete shapes. The complexity of the task should be noted as such tasks often require [[lexicon|lexical]]-semantic abilities as well as imagery abilities.&lt;ref name="Behrmann 2001"/&gt;

==Treatment==
[[Motor imagery]] has been explored as a potential therapy for constructional apraxia patients. Motor imagery is a process by which a specific action is mimicked in the working memory without a corresponding motor output. Since constructional apraxia is a visuospatial problem not a motor problem, rehabilitation-treatment based on motor imagery has not proven to be an effective in patients with right hemisphere stroke or hemispatial neglect.&lt;ref name="Vromen 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vromen A, Verbunt JA, Rasquin S, Wade DT |title=Motor imagery in patients with a right hemisphere stroke and unilateral neglect |journal=Brain Inj |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=387–93 |year=2011 |pmid=21355672 |doi=10.3109/02699052.2011.558041 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1934, [[Karl Kleist]] characterized constructional apraxia as a disturbance "in formative activities such as assembling, building and drawing, in which the spatial form of the product proves to be unsuccessful, without there being an apraxia for single movements."&lt;ref name="Kleist, 1934"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kleist K |title=Gehirnpathologie |at=Konstruktive (optische) Apraxie |publisher=Barth |location=Leipzig |year=1934 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Benton, 2000"&gt;{{cite book |author=Benton, AL |title=Exploring the history of neuropsychology: selected papers |chapter=6, Spatial thinking in neurological patients: Historical aspects |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=0-19-513808-2 |oclc=42935803 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years following, the definition of constructional apraxia 
diverged. There were those who felt it was an executive processing order and those who felt it was a visuospatial disorder. Due to discrepancies in definitions, constructional apraxia became a blanket term to describe any kind of constructional impairment. Modern researchers question whether the term "apraxia" is appropriate to describe this condition.&lt;ref name="Behrmann 2001"/&gt;

'''Wang Yue''' ({{zh|c=[[wikt:王|王]][[wikt:悦|悦]]|p=Wáng Yuè}}), also known as "Little Yue Yue" ({{zh|c=小悅悅}}), was a two-year-old Chinese girl who was run over by two vehicles on the afternoon of 13 October 2011 in a narrow road in [[Foshan]], Guangdong. As she lay bleeding on the road for more than seven minutes, at least 18 passers-by skirted around her body, ignoring her. She was eventually helped by a female rubbish scavenger and sent to a hospital for treatment, but succumbed to her injuries and died eight days later. The [[closed-circuit television]] recording of the incident was uploaded onto the Internet, and quickly stirred widespread reaction in China and overseas. Many commentators saw this as indicative of a growing apathy in contemporary Chinese society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2011/10/toddlers-death-evokes-outpouring-of-grief-and-guilt.html|title=Chinese toddler's death evokes outpouring of grief and guilt|date=21 October 2011|work=latimes.com|accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accident==
Wang, who was two years old, wandered away from her home in [[Foshan]] while her mother was quickly collecting laundry during a thunderstorm.  [[Closed-circuit television camera]]s captured the child wandering into a narrow, busy market street. Within a few moments of her appearance on the screen, Wang was struck by a white van, and knocked to the ground and under the van's front wheels. The van driver pauses, but does not get out. After a moment, he pulls forward slowly, at which time his rear wheel drives over Wang. The driver moves on. Subsequently, at least 18 people walk past her, and fail to assist her, some pausing to stare before moving on. In that time, another large truck runs over Wang's legs with both front and back tires. She is eventually helped by a female rubbish scavenger, Chen Xianmei ({{zh|c=陈贤妹}}). It is apparent in the video that Wang is crying, holding her head, moving her arms and legs, and bleeding.&lt;ref name="nationalpost"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/10/21/chinese-toddler-whose-hit-and-run-sparked-global-outrage-dies-in-hospital/|title=Chinese toddler Yue Yue dies in hospital after hit and run shocks a nation|last=Landreth|first=Jonathan|date=21 October 2011|work=nationalpost.com|accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Wang's parents Wang Chichang and Qu Feifei chose not to blame anyone besides themselves for their daughter's death.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/8840381/Chinese-girl-run-over-by-a-car-dies.html|title=Chinese hit-and-run toddler dies|last=Moore|first=Malcolm|date=21 October 2011|work=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qu said, "Granny Chen represents the best of human nature, it's the nicest and most natural side of us."&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;

The drivers of both vehicles were detained by police in the days after the incident.&lt;ref name=abcnews&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/9907601|title=Chinese toddler ignored after hit-and-run dies|date=21 October 2011|work=guardian.co.uk|accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
On May 26, 2012, Hu Jun, who was driving the first minivan that ran over Wang, was put on trial in Foshan and charged with Wang's death. He pleaded guilty to traffic crimes, but not [[homicide]].&lt;ref name=Huffingtonpost&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/26/chinese-driver-on-trial-after-hit-and-run_n_1547692.html|title=Hu Jun On Trial Over Chinese Hit And Run After Toddler's Death|date=26 May 2012|work=huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 6, 2012, Hu was convicted of [[Involuntary homicide#Involuntary manslaughter|involuntary homicide]] and sentenced to {{frac|3|1|2}} years in prison. The sentence was lightened because he turned himself in and had paid part of Wang's medical expenses.&lt;ref name=bbcnews&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-19498727|title=Foshan driver jailed in toddler hit-and-run case|date=6 September 2012|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nydailynews&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-09-06/news/33656395_1_yueyue-wang-yue-light-sentence|title=Light sentence for hit-run of child, 2, in China|date=6 September 2012|work=nydailynews.com|accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public reaction==
Closed-circuit footage of the incident was broadcast by a local television station, then posted online. The footage sparked worldwide news reports,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503543_162-20121691-503543.html|date=October 17, 2011|title=After toddler is left to die, China disquieted|accessdate=October 22, 2011|first=Joshua|last=Norman|publisher=[[CBS News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and triggered dozens of editorials and millions of posts on social media sites, the majority criticizing the callousness and cruelty of those who passed Wang Yue without helping her.&lt;ref name="YueFox"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2011/10/22/can-video-yue-yue-toddler-left-for-dead-change-china/|title=Can Video of Yue Yue, a Toddler Left for Dead, Change China?|first=Chai|last=Ling|date=October 22, 2011|accessdate=October 22, 2011|publisher=[[Fox News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YueWSJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203752604576645033136435572|first=Josh|last=Chin|title=Toddler's Death Stirs Ire in China|date=October 22, 2011|accessdate=October 22, 2011|publisher=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-15401055|title=Anger and debate over hit-and-run toddler Wang Yue|first=Martin|last=Yip|date=21 October 2011|accessdate=22 October 2011|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, there have been incidents in China, such as the [[Xu Shoulan v. Peng Yu|Peng Yu incident]] in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.danwei.org/law/common_sense_decency_and_crowd.php |title=A 45,000-yuan helping hand: common sense, decency, and crowded public transportation|last=Martinsen|first=Joel|date=7 September 2007|work=danwei.org|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/asia-pacific/ignored-toddler-doesnt-tell-the-whole-story-about-china/article2206105/|title=Ignored toddler doesn’t tell the whole story about China| date=19 October 2011|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein [[Good Samaritan law|Good Samaritans]] who helped people injured in accidents were accused of having injured the victim themselves and in many cases were forced to pay for the victim's medical bills. Some commentators have explained that this may have caused people to fear getting in trouble for doing the right thing in Wang's case, thus failing to help.&lt;ref name="nationalpost" /&gt;

The Communist Party Chief of the [[Guangdong]] province, [[Wang Yang (official)|Wang Yang]], called the incident "a wake-up call for everybody".&lt;ref name=abcnews/&gt; The [[Sina Weibo]] website attracted more than 4.5 million posts on the incident within a few days and launched a "stop apathy" campaign online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/20/world/asia/china-toddler-dead/?hpt=ias_c2|title=Chinese toddler dies a week after being hit by cars, ignored by passersby|date=21 October 2011|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also reports that some of the 18 people identified in the camera footage have received harassment, threats, and crank calls since the news broke.&lt;ref name=abcnews/&gt;

In November 2011, the results of a poll by the ''[[China Youth Daily]]'', the official Communist party newspaper for youth, showed that 80% of the young people surveyed said they had been following the case closely, and 88% of those polled thought Wang died because of growing indifference [in China] towards other people. A majority, 71%, also thought the people who passed the child without helping were afraid of getting into trouble themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/china/2011-10/28/content_23748172.htm|title=Youths search their souls after Yue Yue's death|date=2 November 2011|work=China.org.cn|accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an article by Chen Weihua, deputy editor of the ''[[China Daily]]'', "Various surveys in the past weeks have shown that the majority of the people polled believe our morals have suffered a major setback in the past decade."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/2011-11/01/content_14012721.htm|title=Reclaiming moral ground key to nation|last=Chen|first=Weihua|date=1 November 2011|work=[[China Daily]]|accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
According to ''[[China Daily]]'', “At least 10 Party and government departments and organizations in Guangdong, including the province's commission on politics and law, the women's federation, the Academy of Social Sciences, and the Communist Youth League, have started discussions on punishing those who refuse to help people who clearly need it.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2011-10/20/content_13941570.htm|title=Law mulled to make aid compulsory|last=Zheng|first=Caixiong|date=20 October 2011|work=chinadaily.com.cn|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Officials of Guangdong province, along with many lawyers and social workers, also held three days of meetings in the provincial capital of [[Guangzhou]] to discuss the case. It was reported that various lawmakers of the province were drafting a "Good Samaritan" law, which would "penalize people who fail to help in a situation of this type and indemnify them from lawsuits if their efforts are in vain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/la-mobile-china-toddler-death,0,362417.story|title=Chinese toddler's death evokes outpouring of grief and guilt|last=Demick|first=Barbara|date=21 October 2011|work=latimes.com|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal experts and the public debated the idea ahead of discussions and a legislative push.&lt;ref name="YueWSJ"/&gt;  On 1 August 2013, the nation's first Good Samaritan law took effect in [[Shenzhen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Huifeng | first = He | title = Shenzhen introduces Good Samaritan law | publisher = [[South China Morning Post]] | date = 1 August 2013 | url = http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1293475/shenzhen-introduces-good-samaritan-law | accessdate = January 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most attention was focused on the passers-by who failed to assist Wang, a British journalist interviewed other shopkeepers in the Foshan hardware market who were just meters away yet failed to respond. He found that the area where the incident occurred was inhabited mainly by [[Migration in the People's Republic of China|internal migrant]] families (the Wangs had migrated from [[Shandong]] seven years earlier). In the writer's view, there was little sense of community and little in common there. One resident noted, "It is quite sad that we don't really talk to each other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/8841840/As-Chinese-hit-and-run-girl-dies-passersby-claim-they-did-not-see-her.html|title=As Chinese hit-and-run girl dies, passersby claim they did not see her|last=Moore|first=Malcolm|date=21 October 2011|work=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later incidents ===
While media outlets reported on the perceived Chinese apathy in the aftermath of Wang Yue's death, another incident occurred in Hangzhou when a Chinese woman attempted suicide by drowning in a lake, while local Chinese bystanders gathered at the edge of the lake to watch. After noticing that no one was attempting to rescue the woman, a [[Uruguay]]an visitor to China named Maria Fernanda Gomez Arregui swam into the water and saved the woman from drowning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=F_474 |url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90882/7633050.html |title=Rescuer didn't save a life for fame - People's Daily Online |publisher=English.peopledaily.com.cn |date=2011-11-02 |accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese government officials announced that Maria Fernanda would receive a cash reward of 3000 [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] for her heroic display of "traditional Chinese virtues".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kenneth Tan |url=http://shanghaiist.com/2011/11/03/hangzhou_government_to_reward_urugu.php |title=Hangzhou government to reward laowai heroine RMB3,000 for possessing "traditional Chinese virtues" |publisher=Shanghaiist |date=2011-11-03 |accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shanghaidaily.org/article/print.asp?id=486466 |title=上海日报 - English Window to China News |publisher=Shanghai Daily |date=2011-11-03 |accessdate=2011-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404035536/http://www.shanghaidaily.org/article/print.asp?id=486466 |archivedate=2012-04-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rescue achieved a high profile after the media presented photographs by Wang Ronggui&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinawhisper.com/american-woman-saves-a-drowning-chinese-woman-in-west-lake |title=American woman saves a drowning Chinese woman in West Lake |publisher=China Whisper |date=2011-10-18 |accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; to contrast with the lack of action of bystanders in the death of Wang Yue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/chinese-told-theyve-got-to-try-a-little-kindness-20111111-1nbly.html |title=Chinese told they've got to try a little kindness |publisher=Smh.com.au |date=2011-11-12 |accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several other similar deaths that occurred around the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/nov/04/world/la-fg-china-samaritan-20111105 |title=After shocking incidents, Chinese struggle to instill kindness - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=2011-11-04 |accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later incidents in China continue to be compared with the death of Wang Yue. In December 2012, a five-year-old boy named Yan Zhe received [[crush injury|crush injuries]] from a minibus in [[Zhejiang]] province. Despite the pleas of the child's mother, other drivers and passers-by refused to help. He was eventually taken to a hospital but died on the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Is there a conscience there?: Chinese boy hit by minibus ignored by passers-by|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/is-there-a-conscience-there-chinese-boy-hit-by-minibus-ignored-by-passersby-20121214-2bddr.html|accessdate=14 December 2012|newspaper=smh.com.au|date=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kris Kremers''' and '''Lisanne Froon''' were [[Dutch people|Dutch]] students who died on or shortly after April 1, 2014, while hiking in [[Panama]]. After an extensive search, portions of their bodies were found a few months later. Their cause of death could not be determined definitively, but Dutch authorities working with forensic and search-rescue investigators thought it likely the students had accidentally fallen from a cliff after becoming lost.&lt;ref name=NltimesA/&gt; The circumstances and aftermath of their disappearance have resulted in much speculation about the cause of death.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elitereaders.com/photos-tourists-mysteriously-disappeared/|title=These Haunting Photos Were Snapped Just Before These Tourists Mysteriously Disappeared.|date=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mostlymystery.com/missing-in-panama-a-mystery-deepens-2/|title=Missing in Panama — A Mystery Deepens - Mostly Mystery}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NltimesA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nltimes.nl/2015/03/04/kris-lisanne-likely-fell-off-cliff-panama-investigators/|title=Kris &amp; Lisanne likely fell off cliff in Panama: investigators|date=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foul play could not be entirely ruled out and Panamanian officials came under fire for allegedly mishandling the disappearance and aftermath.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/07/24/death-on-the-serpent-river-how-the-lost-girls-of-panama-disappeared.html|title=Death on the Serpent River: How the Lost Girls of Panama Disappeared|last=Kryt|first=Jeremy|date=2016-07-24|website=The Daily Beast|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tvn-2.com/nacionales/Cronologia-busqueda-Kris-Lisanne_0_3965603516.html|title=Cronología de la búsqueda de Kris y Lisanne|newspaper=TVN|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further investigation into the case in 2017 uncovered enough new evidence to suggest foul play,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/did-a-serial-killer-stalk-the-lost-girls-of-panama|title=Did a Serial Killer Stalk the Lost Girls of Panama?|last=Kryt|first=Jeremy|date=2017-05-13|website=The Daily Beast|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a possible link to other murders in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/lisanne-kris-catherinewill-the-panama-cases-ever-be-solved?ref=author|title=Lisanne, Kris, Catherine—Will the Panama Cases Ever Be Solved?|last=Kryt|first=Jeremy|date=2017-05-16|website=The Daily Beast|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==  
Lisanne Froon, 22, was described as aspiring, optimistic, intelligent, and a passionate volleyball player, and Kris Kremers, 21, as open, creative, and responsible. Both grew up in [[Amersfoort]]. Froon had graduated with a degree in [[Applied Sciences]] from [[Deventer]] the previous September, and Kremers had just completed her studies in cultural social education, specializing in art education at the [[University of Utrecht]]. Only a few weeks prior to leaving for Panama, Froon had moved in with Kremers in a dorm room in Amersfoort, and they worked together at the café/restaurant 'In den Kleinen Hap'. They both saved up money for six months and planned to go to Panama together on a special trip to learn Spanish, as well as to do something of significance for the locals, particularly volunteering with children. The trip was also supposed to be a reward to Froon for graduating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.findlisannekris.com/kris-and-lisanne/about-lisanne/|title=About Lisanne|date=2014-05-08|work=Foundation to Find Kris &amp; Lisanne|access-date=2017-09-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.findlisannekris.com/kris-and-lisanne/about-kris/|title=About Kris|date=2014-05-08|newspaper=Foundation to Find Kris &amp; Lisanne|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disappearance  ==
Kremers and Froon arrived in Panama for a six-week vacation on March 15, 2014. They toured Panama for two weeks before arriving in [[Boquete, Chiriquí|Boquete]] on March 29 to live with a local family for a month while volunteering with children. On April 1, they went hiking with their hosts' dog around 11:00 near the clouded forests that surrounded the [[Volcán Barú|Baru volcano]], possibly the trail of Pianista, not far from Boquete. They wrote on [[Facebook]] that they intended to walk around Boquete, and it was reported that they had been seen having brunch with two young Dutch men before embarking on the trail.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2014/04/hunt_for_girls_missing_in_pana/|title=Hunt for girls missing in Panama scaled down, Dutch men being questioned|date=2014-04-15|newspaper=DutchNews.nl|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their hosts became alarmed when their dog returned home that night without the young women. Froon's parents stopped receiving text messages, which both women had been sending to their families daily. On the morning of April 2, Froon and Kremers missed an appointment with a local guide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2014/06/22/panamese-autoriteiten-organiseren-morgen-persconferentie-a1424164&lt;/ref&gt; On April 3, authorities began aerial searches of the forest and local residents began searching. On April 6, the parents of Kremers and Froon arrived in Panama along with police, dog units, and detectives from the Netherlands to conduct a full-scale search of the forests for ten days. The parents offered a US$30,000 reward.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/07/30/the-last-man-to-see-the-lost-girls-of-panama-alive.html|title=The Last Man to See the Lost Girls of Panama Alive|last=Visser|first=Jeremy Kryt{{!}}Nadette De|date=2016-07-30|website=The Daily Beast|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mostlymystery.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/kris-and-lisanne1.jpg|title=Missing: Two Dutch Nationals|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Backpack ==
Ten weeks later, a local woman turned in Froon's blue backpack, which she said she had found in a rice paddy by a riverbank near her village of Alto Romero, in the Bocas del Toro region. She said she was sure it had not been there the day before. The backpack contained two pairs of sunglasses, US$83 in cash, Froon's passport, a water bottle, Froon's camera, two bras, and the women's phones{{snd}}all packed, dry, and in good condition. The women's phones showed that some hours after the start of their hike, someone had dialed 112 (the [[112 (emergency telephone number)|international emergency number]]) and 911 (the emergency number in Panama).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/07/the-lost-girls-of-panama-the-camera-the-jungle-and-the-bones.html|title=The Lost Girls of Panama: The Camera, the Jungle, and the Bones|last=Visser|first=Jeremy Kryt{{!}}Nadette De|date=2016-08-07|website=The Daily Beast|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The first distress call had been made just hours after beginning their hike: one from Kremers's iPhone at 16:39 and shortly after that, one from Froon's Samsung Galaxy at 16:51. None of the calls had gone through due to a lack of reception in the area except for one 911 call attempt on April 3 that lasted for a little over a second before breaking up. After April 5, Froon's phone battery became exhausted after 05:00 and was not used again. Kremers's iPhone would not make any more calls either but was intermittently turned on to search for reception. After April 6, multiple attempts of a false PIN code were entered into the iPhone; it never received the correct code again. One report showed that between 7 and 10 April, there were 77 emergency call attempts with the iPhone. On April 11, the phone was turned on at 10:51, and was turned off for the last time at 11:56.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.allmystery.de/i/t23811542a_t90b70a_t7b5a9c_black_log_new.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.allmystery.de/i/t7d40d0d00_ibioblucptypqw.png&lt;/ref&gt;

Froon's camera contained photos from April 1 suggesting that the women had taken a trail at the overlook of the Continental Divide and wandered into some wilderness hours before their first attempt to reach 911, but with no signs of anything unusual. On April 8, ninety flash photos were taken between 01:00 and 04:00, apparently deep in the jungle and in near-complete darkness. A few photos show that they were possibly near a river or a ravine. Some show a twig with plastic bags and candy wrappers on top of a rock, another shows what looks like toilet paper and a mirror on another rock, and another shows the back of Kremers's head with what looks like blood by her temple.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://laestrella.com.pa/panama/nacional/dutch-girls-camera-took-90-photos-3-hours/23811086|title=Dutch girls' camera took 90 photos in 3 hours|date=2014-10-07|newspaper=La Estrella de Panam&amp;aacute;|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The discovery of the backpack led to new searches along the Culebra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.panamaamerica.com.pa/tema-del-dia/indigenas-han-sido-pieza-clave-en-investigaciones|title=Indígenas han sido pieza clave en investigaciones|last=Anonymous|date=2014-06-19|work=Panamá América|access-date=2017-09-20|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kremers' jean shorts, zipped and neatly folded, were found atop a rock on the opposite bank of the tributary a few kilometers away from where Froon's backpack had been discovered (although later witnesses would claim the jeans were not neatly folded but found in the river itself&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.thedailybeast.com/tourist-trap-how-did-the-lost-girls-perish-in-paradise |title= Deep Inside the Panama 'Paradise' Murder Mysteries |last=Kryt |first=Jeremy |date= 2017-05-15 |website= The Daily Beast |access-date= 2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Two months later, closer to where the backpack was discovered, a pelvis and a boot with a foot inside were found. Soon at least 33 widely scattered bones were discovered along the same river bank. DNA testing confirmed they belonged to Froon and Kremers. Froon's bones still had some skin attached to them, but Kremers's bones appeared to have been bleached.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;http://mostlymystery.com/found/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  A Panamanian forensic anthropologist later claimed that under magnification "there are no discernible scratches of any kind on the bones, neither of natural nor cultural origin—there are no marks on the bones at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-lost-girls-the-bones-and-the-man-in-the-panama-morgue-1 |title= The Lost Girls, The Bones, and the Man in the Panama Morgue |last=Kryt |first=Jeremy |date= 2017-05-16 |website= The Daily Beast |access-date= 2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2333">A '''Device Master Record''' is a compilation of all the instructions, drawings and other records, that must be used to produce a product. The Device Master Record is often referred to as simply DMR. The term is used in [[Quality Management System]]s that cover product design and production.

The physical appearance of the DMR can be a binder with documents, a document that can refer to other documents, or the same concepts in a computer as documents in a database. Labels, Instructions for Use, drawings, Certificates of Conformity, and other documetnts might form part of a DMR.

One of the purposes of the Device Master Record, is to separate the production process from the design process, that is covered in the Design Dossier or [[Design History File]] (DHF). After a product design department is updating their design documents, the design has to be transferred to a production scenario. For instance, if the product incorporates software, the software must be compiled and tested before it is given to the production department. Similarly, if a piece of plastic is used in the product, a plastic mould must be created before production can start. Once everything is ready for switching to making the new design, the device master record is updated.

All products, that are produced according to such quality management systems, can refer to a specific DMR that was used to produce it. The DMR will specify exactly what plastic moulds to use, what software builds to install etc.  The production history is part of the [[Device History Record]] (DHR) .

If an error is found in a product, the manufacturer may identify this problem to specific versions of the DMR, possibly using a [[Corrective and preventive action|CAPA]], and may then choose to issue notices to customers for products, that have been built according to these versions of the DMR, or make a [[product recall]].

== Theoretical background ==
The theory presents simple mechanistic rules that describe the uptake and allocation of energy (and nutrients) and the consequences for physiological organization throughout an organism's life cycle, including the relationships of energetics with aging and effects of toxicants.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  Assumptions of the DEB theory are delineated in an explicit way,  the approach clearly distinguishes mechanisms associated with intra‐ and interspecific variation in metabolic rates, and equations for energy flows are mathematically derived following the principles of physics and simplicity.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ledder|first=Glenn|date=2014|title=The Basic Dynamic Energy Budget Model and Some Implications|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/23737867.2014.11414482|journal=Letters in Biomathematics|volume=1:2|pages= 221–233|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sarà|first=Gianluca|last2=Rinaldi|first2=Alessandro|last3=Montalto|first3=Valeria|date=2014-12-01|title=Thinking beyond organism energy use: a trait-based bioenergetic mechanistic approach for predictions of life history traits in marine organisms|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/maec.12106|journal=Marine Ecology|language=en|volume=35|issue=4|pages=506–515|doi=10.1111/maec.12106|issn=1439-0485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornerstones of the theory are:

* conservation of [[mass balance|mass]], [[Energy balance (biology)|energy]] and [[time balance|time]],
* relationships between surface area and volume
* [[stoichiometric]] constraints on production
* organizational uncoupling of metabolic [[modularity (biology)|modules]] (assimilation, dissipation, growth)
* strong and weak [[homeostasis]] (composition of compartments is constant; composition of the organism is constant when the food is constant) 
* substrate(s) from the environment is/are first converted to reserve(s) before being used for further metabolism

The theory specifies that an organism is made up two main compartments: '''[[Dynamic reserve|(energy) reserve]]''' and '''structure'''. Assimilation of energy is proportional to surface area of the structure, and maintenance is proportional to its volume. Reserve does not require maintenance. Energy mobilization will depend on the relative amount of the energy reserve, and on the interface between reserve and structure. Once mobilized, the energy is split into two branches:

* a fixed proportion  (termed kappa, κ) is allocated to  [[Individual growth|growth]] (increase of structural mass) and maintenance of structure, while 
* the remaining proportion (1- κ) is allocated to processes of maturation (increase in complexity, installation of regulation systems, preparation for reproduction) and maintaining the level of attained maturity (including, e.g., maintenance of defense systems).

The κ-rule therefore states that the processes of growth and maturation do not directly compete. [[Maintenance of an organism|Maintenance]] needs to be paid before allocating energy to other processes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In the context of energy acquisition and allocation, the theory recognizes three main developmental stages: '''embryo''', which does not feed or reproduce, '''juvenile''', which feeds but does not reproduce, and '''adult''', which both feeds and is allocating energy to reproduction. Transitions between these life stages occur at events specified as '''birth''' and '''puberty''', which are reached when energy invested into maturation (tracked as 'level of '''maturity'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;') reaches a certain threshold. Maturity does not increase in the adult stage, and maturity maintenance is proportional to maturity.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Biochemical composition of reserve and structure is considered to be that of [[generalised compound]]s, and is constant (the assumption of strong homeostasis) but not necessarily identical. Biochemical transformation from food to reserve (assimilation), and from reserve to structure (growth) include overhead costs. These overheads, together with processes of somatic and maturity [[Maintenance of an organism|maintenance]] and reproduction overheads (inefficiencies in transformation from reserve to reproductive material), all contribute to the consumption of oxygen and production of carbon dioxide, i.e. [[metabolism]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== DEB models ==
All dynamic energy budget models follow the energy budget of an individual organism throughout its life cycle; by contrast,"static" energy budget models describe a specific life stage or [[size]] of an organism.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lika|first=Konstadia|last2=Nisbet|first2=Roger M.|date=2000-10-01|title=A Dynamic Energy Budget model based on partitioning of net production|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002850000049|journal=Journal of Mathematical Biology|language=en|volume=41|issue=4|pages=361–386|doi=10.1007/s002850000049|issn=0303-6812}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main advantage of the DEB-theory based model over most other models is its description of energy assimilation and utilization ([[Dynamic reserve|reserve dynamics]]) simultaneously with decoupled processes of growth, [[Developmental biology|development/ maturation]], and [[Maintenance of an organism|maintenance]].&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mueller|first=Casey A.|last2=Augustine|first2=Starrlight|last3=Kooijman|first3=Sebastiaan A.L.M.|last4=Kearney|first4=Michael R.|last5=Seymour|first5=Roger S.|title=The trade-off between maturation and growth during accelerated development in frogs|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S109564331200308X|journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A: Molecular &amp; Integrative Physiology|volume=163|issue=1|pages=95–102|doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2012.05.190}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DEB theory specifies [[dynamic reserve|reserve]]s as separate from structure: these are the two [[state variable]]s that contribute to physical volume, and (in combination with reproduction buffer of adults) fully define the size of an individual. Maturity (also a [[state variable]] of the model) tracks how much energy has been invested into maturation, and therefore determines the life stage of the organism relative to maturity levels at which life stage transitions (birth and puberty) occur. Dynamics of the state variables are given by [[ordinary differential equation]]s which include the major processes of energy uptake and use: assimilation, mobilization, maintenance, growth, maturation, and reproduction.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

* Food is transformed into reserve, which fuels all other metabolic processes. The feeding rate is proportional to the surface area; food handling time and the transformation efficiency from food to reserve are independent of food density.
* A fixed fraction (kappa) of mobilized reserve is allocated to somatic maintenance plus growth (soma), the rest on maturity maintenance plus maturation or reproduction. Maintenance has priority over other processes. Somatic maintenance is proportional to structural body volume, and maturity maintenance to maturity. Heating costs for endotherms and osmostic work (for fresh water organisms) are somatic maintenance costs that are proportional to surface area.
* Stage transitions occur if the cumulated investment into [[Developmental biology|maturation]] exceeds threshold values. Life stages typically are: embryo, juvenile, and adult. Reserve that is allocated to reproduction is first accumulated in a buffer. The rules for converting the buffer to gametes are species-specific (e.g. spawning can be once per season).

[[Parametrization|Parameters]] of the model are individual specific, but similarities between individuals of the same species yield species-specific parameter estimations.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/research/bib/MarqAugu2018.html|title=The AmP project: Comparing Species on the Basis of Dynamic Energy Budget Parameters|last=Marques, G.

Estimated parameters are collected in the online library called the [http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/deb/deblab/add_my_pet/index.html Add-my-pet project].

===The standard DEB model===
The standard model quantifies the metabolism of an [[isomorph]] (organism that does not change in shape during ontogeny) that feeds on one type of food with a constant composition (therefore the weak [[homeostasis]] applies, i.e. the chemical composition of the body is constant). The state variables of the individual are 1 reserve, 1 structure, maturity, and (in the adult stage) the reproduction buffer. Parameter values are constant throughout life. The reserve density at birth equals that of the mother at egg formation. [[Foetus]]es develop similarly, but receive unrestricted amount of reserve from the mother during development.

===Extensions of the standard model===

DEB theory has been extended into many directions, such as 
*effects of changes in shape during growth (e.g. [[V1-morph]]s and [[V0-morph]]s)
*non-standard embryo-&gt;juvenile-&gt;adult transitions, for example in holometabolic insects &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Llandres|first=Ana L.|last2=Marques|first2=Gonçalo M.|last3=Maino|first3=James L.|last4=Kooijman|first4=S.

*the formation and excretion of metabolic products (which is a basis for [[syntrophy|syntrophic]] relationships, and useful in [[biotechnology]])
*the production of free radicals (linked to size and nutritional status) and their effect on survival ([[aging]])

== Criticism ==
The main criticism is directed to the formal presentation of the theory (heavy mathematical jargon), number of listed parameters, the symbol heavy notation, and the fact that modeled (state) variables and parameters are abstract quantities which cannot be directly measured, all making it less likely to reach its intended audience (ecologists) and be an "efficient" theory.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marquet|first=Pablo A.|last2=Allen|first2=Andrew P.|last3=Brown|first3=James H.|last4=Dunne|first4=Jennifer A.|last5=Enquist|first5=Brian J.|last6=Gillooly|first6=James F.|last7=Gowaty|first7=Patricia A.|last8=Green|first8=Jessica L.|last9=Harte|first9=John|date=2014-08-01|title=On Theory in Ecology|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/64/8/701/2754269|journal=BioScience|language=en|volume=64|issue=8|pages=701–710|doi=10.1093/biosci/biu098|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, more recent publications aim to present the DEB theory in an "easier to digest" content to "bridge the ecology-mathematics gap".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The general methodology of estimation of DEB parameters from data is described in [http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/research/bib/Meer2006.html van der Meer 2006]; [http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/research/bib/KooySous2008.html Kooijman et al 2008] shows which particular compound parameters can be estimated from a few simple observations at a single food density and how an increasing number of parameters can be estimated if more quantities are observed at several food densities. A natural sequence exists in which parameters can be known in principle. In addition, routines for data entry and scripts for parameter estimation are available as a free and documented software package [http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/deb/deblab/debtool/DEBtool_M/manual/index.html DEBtool], aiming to provide a ready-to-use tool for users with less mathematical and programing background. Number of parameters, also pointed as relatively sparse for a bioenergetic model,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; vary depending on the main application and, because the whole life cycle of an organism is defined, the overall number of parameters per data-set ratio is relatively low.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kearney|first=Michael R.|last2=Domingos|first2=Tiago|last3=Nisbet|first3=Roger|date=2015-04-01|title=Dynamic Energy Budget Theory: An Efficient and General Theory for Ecology|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article-abstract/65/4/341/255084|journal=BioScience|language=en|volume=65|issue=4|pages=341–341|doi=10.1093/biosci/biv013|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linking the DEB (abstract) and measured properties is done by simple mathematical operations which include auxiliary parameters (also defined by the DEB theory and included in the [http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/deb/deblab/debtool/DEBtool_M/manual/index.html DEBtool] routines), and include also switching between energy-time and mass-time contexts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  [https://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/deb/deblab/add_my_pet/index.html Add my pet (AmP)] project explores parameter pattern values across taxa. The DEB notation is a result of combining the symbols from the main fields of science ([[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[mathematics]]) used in the theory, while trying to keep the symbols consistent.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; As the symbols themselves contain a fair bit of information  &lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; (see [http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/research/bib/Kooy2010_n.pdf DEB notation] document), they are kept in most of the DEB literature.

==  Compatibility (and applicability) of DEB theory/models with other approaches ==

'''Eliyahu Moshe Goldratt''' (March 31, 1947 – June 11, 2011) was an Israeli business management guru.&lt;ref&gt;McClenahen, John S: [http://www.industryweek.com/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=11477 "Manufacturing's Influential Thinkers &amp; Doers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608170929/http://www.industryweek.com/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=11477 |date=2008-06-08 }} Retrieved on: October 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Tales out of business school." ''The Economist.'' (January 21, 1995).  334 (7898), 63&lt;/ref&gt; He was the originator of the Optimized Production Technique, the [[Theory of Constraints]] (TOC), the [[Thinking Processes (Theory of Constraints)|Thinking Processes]], Drum-Buffer-Rope, [[Critical Chain Project Management]] (CCPM) and other TOC derived tools.

He was the author of several [[business fable|business novels]] and non-fiction works, mainly on the application of the theory of constraints to various manufacturing, engineering, and other business processes.

The processes are typically modeled as resource flows, the constraints typically represent limits on flows. In his book &lt;cite&gt;''[[The Goal]]''&lt;/cite&gt;, the protagonist is a manager in charge of a troubled manufacturing operation. At any point in time, one particular constraint (such as inadequate capacity at a machine tool) limits total system throughput, and when the constraint is resolved, another constraint becomes the critical one.  The plot of Goldratt's stories revolve around identifying the current limiting constraint and raising it, which is followed by finding out which is the next limiting constraint. Another common theme is that the system being analyzed has excess capacity at a number of non-critical points, which, contrary to conventional wisdom, is absolutely essential to ensure constant operation of the constrained resource.

==Life==
[[File:Eliyahu M. Goldratt grave 2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Eliyahu M. Goldratt's grave]]
Goldratt was born into a rabbinic family, the son of [[Avraham-Yehuda Goldrat]], in British Mandatory Palestine one year prior to Israel's modern statehood. He obtained BSc degree from [[Tel Aviv University; Israel]], and MSc and PhD degrees from [[Bar-Ilan University; Israel]]. Goldratt died June 11, 2011 at noon, in his home in Israel. &lt;ref&gt;"Eliyahu M. Goldratt, Renowned Business 'Guru' and Author of International Best-Selling Business Novel 'The Goal,' Dies at Age 64", [http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/eliyahu-m-goldratt-renowned-business-guru-and-author-of-international-best-selling-business-novel-the-goal-dies-at-age-64-123796619.html "PR Newswire"], June 14, 2011.  Retrieved June 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

===Creative Output years===

After some experience helping Israeli manufacturers, Goldratt left the academic world to join a company called Creative Output. The company developed and sold a software package, the Optimized Production Technology (OPT). OPT was billed as the first software to provide finite capacity scheduling for production environments. This software and the principles behind it were analyzed by a number of major publications&lt;ref&gt;G. Bylinsky. &lt;cite&gt;''An Efficiency guru with a brown box''&lt;/cite&gt;. Fortune; 120 (September 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldratt was actively involved in many controversies such as Cost Accounting v Throughput Accounting&lt;ref&gt;Goldratt, E. M.; &lt;cite&gt;''Cost accounting is enemy number one of productivity''&lt;/cite&gt;. International Conference Proceedings, American Production and Inventory Control Society (APICS) (October 1983).&lt;/ref&gt; and culminated in the publication of &lt;cite&gt;''A Town Without Walls''&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Goldratt, Eliyahu M. &amp; Plossl, George; &lt;cite&gt;A'' Town Without Walls''&lt;cite&gt;. Whitepaper, distributed during APICS 1984 International Conference in Las Vegas/USA&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the company, Goldratt noticed elements that made him uncomfortable&lt;ref name="My Saga"&gt;Goldratt, Eliyahu M.; &lt;cite&gt;''My Saga to Improve Production''&lt;/cite&gt;. For instance, in the second edition of &lt;cite&gt;''The Goal''&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; several software implementations did not come close to their estimated potential. After some work, Goldratt discovered that the habits and assumptions (paradigms) of employees and managers prior to using the software were still prominent and negatively influenced results after implementation.&lt;ref name="My Saga"/&gt;

His answer was the book &lt;cite&gt;[[The Goal]]&lt;/cite&gt; that took 13 months to write. After completion, the book was not well received by the company staff and by large publishers.&lt;ref name="My Saga"/&gt; Finally, with help from Larry Gadd the owner of North River Press, the book was published and became a great success.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Gadd. Preface to &lt;cite&gt;[[The Choice (philosophy book)|The Choice]]&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After a while, Goldratt noticed that many implementations were conducted using the Book but not the software. This caused further stress in the company and Goldratt tried to capture the essence of how to implement the solution directly in what is now known as Drum-Buffer-Rope method. He published &lt;cite&gt;The Race&lt;/cite&gt; to explain some of the concepts he was working on and developed a course to teach people how to manage their production using a computer simulation game.

Goldratt tried to move the company down the path of "consulting," trying to help people rethink the way they did things, but Creative Output's declining revenues and Goldratt involvement with anything but the sales of OPT software convinced the shareholders to fire Goldratt (and afterward his closer collaborators).

===Avraham Y. Goldratt Institute years===

After leaving Creative Output circa 1985, Goldratt created the Avraham Y Goldratt Institute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = AGI Goldratt Institute | url = http://www.goldratt.com
 | accessdate = June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or AGI (named after his father) to promote the Theory of Constraints and help it be implemented worldwide.

During the time of the AGI, Goldratt got deeply involved with the further development of TOC, mainly the [[Thinking Processes (Theory of Constraints)|Thinking Processes]] (and launched it publicly in 1991), [[Critical Chain Project Management]] and other applications.  His concepts influenced applications outside manufacturing and supply management, including the field of [[sales process engineering]].&lt;ref name="Selden"&gt;{{cite book|title= Sales Process Engineering: A Personal Workshop |author = Paul H. Selden|publisher=ASQ Quality Press|location = Milwaukee, WI|year=1997|pages =33–35, 264–268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Goldratt followed his plan to retire from the Institute prior to his 50th birthday.

===Goldratt Group years===

From the beginning of the 2000s, Goldratt created the self-funded Goldratt Group and launched the Viable Vision initiative.

He continued the development of TOC both in the Goldratt Group and in active support for other developments like TOC for Education, TOC in Healthcare, TOC for the Individual (in the continuity of the Odyssey Program, and the publishing of &lt;cite&gt;''The Choice''&lt;/cite&gt;).

==Writings==
{{Original research|date=February 2010}}{{Refimprove|date=February 2010}}

Goldratt produced many works. Some of the more noteworthy are:

:*''[[The Goal (novel)|The Goal]]'' (fiction, 1984) introduces TOC process for improving organizations and briefly TOC's accounting aspects. While set in a manufacturing company, the book provides the context for a more generic approach to continuous improvement.&lt;ref name=Rahman1998&gt;Shams-ur Rahman, (1998) "Theory of constraints: A review of the philosophy and its applications", International Journal of Operations &amp; Production Management, Vol. 18 Iss: 4, pp.336 - 355&lt;/ref&gt;

:*''The Race'' (non-fiction, 1986) further develops the logistical system called drum-buffer-rope (DBR), based on metaphors developed in The Goal.&lt;ref name=Rahman1998 /&gt;

:*''The Haystack Syndrome'' (non-fiction, 1990) looks deeper at the idea of performance measurements, examines differences between data and information, and explains the logic of the need for information.&lt;ref name=Rahman1998 /&gt;

:*''What is This Thing Called Theory of Constraints and How Should it be Implemented?'' (non-fiction, 1990) addresses the five focusing steps of on-going improvement and fundamentals of the [[Thinking Processes (Theory of Constraints)|Thinking processes]].&lt;ref name=Rahman1998 /&gt;

:*''[[It's Not Luck (novel)|It's Not Luck]]'' (fiction, 1994) applies TOC to [[marketing]], [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] and [[Business Strategy]]; Goldratt illustrates use of the Thinking processes to address policy constraints.&lt;ref name=Rahman1998 /&gt;

:*''[[Critical Chain (novel)|Critical Chain]]'' (fiction, 1997) applies TOC to [[project management]] and illustrates the [[Critical Chain]] method for managing projects while commenting on the MBA Academic environment and its issues

:*''[[Necessary But Not Sufficient (novel)|Necessary But Not Sufficient]]'' (fiction, 2000) applies TOC to [[Enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) and operations software

More recent works:

:*''[[The Choice (philosophy book)|The Choice]]'' (2008) Talks about Goldratt's thought-provoking approach, this time through a conversation with his daughter Efrat, as he explains to her his fundamental system of beliefs.
:*[[The Choice (philosophy book)|The Choice, Revised Edition]] (2010) The revised edition includes Efrat's own notes she made during the conversation with her father, helping the reader determine the true essence of the book.

:*''[[Isn't it Obvious (novel)|Isn't it Obvious]]'' (fiction, 2009) Goldratt's most recent book looks into retail. Ilan Eshkoli and Joe Leer Brown are co-authors. The story is about a husband (manager) and wife (purchaser) working in her family's retail chain. An unexpected crisis helps them to find new ways of doing things - ending in success.

'''Endogenous regeneration''' in the brain is the ability of cells to engage in the repair and [[Regeneration (biology)#Humans|regeneration]] process.  While the brain has a limited capacity for regeneration, [[Endogeny|endogenous]] neural [[stem cell]]s, as well as numerous pro-regenerative molecules, can participate in replacing and repairing damaged or diseased [[neuron]]s and [[Neuroglia|glial cells]].  Another benefit that can be achieved by using endogenous regeneration could be avoiding an [[Immune system|immune]] response from the host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Odelberg S. J. |year=2002 |title=Indus regeneration in mammals|journal= Cell &amp; Developmental Biology |volume=13 |pages=335–343. |doi=10.1016/s1084-9521(02)00089-7 |pmid= 12324215 |issue=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neural stem cells in the adult brain==
During the early development of a human, [[Nervous system|neural]] stem cells lie in the [[Germ layer|germinal layer]] of the developing brain, [[Ventricular system|ventricular]] and [[subventricular zone]]s.  In brain development, [[Multipotent#Multipotency|multipotent]] stem cells (those that can generate different types of cells) are present in these regions, and all of these cells differentiate into neural cell forms, such as [[neurons]], [[oligodendrocytes]] and [[astrocytes]].  A long-held belief states that the multipotency of neural stem cells would be lost in the adult human brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Doetsch F, Isabelle C, Lim DA |year=1999 |title=Subventricular Zone Astrocytes Are Neural Stem Cells in the Adult Mammalian Brain |journal=Cell |volume=97 |pages=703–716|doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80783-7|pmid=10380923|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is only ''[[in vitro]]'', using [[neurosphere]] and adherent [[monolayer]] cultures, stem cells that can be found in the adult mammalian brain that have shown mutipotent capacity, while the ''[[in vivo]]'' study is not convincing.  Therefore, the term "neural progenitor" is used instead of "stem cell" to describe limited regeneration ability in the adult brain stem cell.&lt;ref name='zhao'&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zhao, C. |author2=Deng, W. |author3=Gage, F. H. |year=2008 |title=Mechanisms and functional implications of adult neurogenesis |journal= Cell |volume=132 |pages=645–660 |doi= 10.1016/j.cell.2008.01.033 |pmid=18295581|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neural stem cells]] (NSC) reside in the [[subventricular zone]] (SVZ) of the adult human brain and the [[dentate gyrus]] of the adult mammalian [[hippocampus]].  Newly formed neurons from these regions participate in learning, memory, [[olfaction]] and mood modulation.&lt;ref name='zhao' /&gt;  It has not been definitively determined whether or not these stem cells are multipotents.  NSC from the hippocampus of rodents, which can differentiate into dentate [[granule cell]]s, have developed into many cell types when studied in culture.&lt;ref name='ming'&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Guo-li Ming H. S. |year=2005 |title=Adult Neurogenesis in the Mammalian Central Nervous System |journal=Annu. Rev. Neurosci. |volume=28|pages=223–250. |doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.28.051804.101459 |pmid=16022595}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, another ''in vivo'' study, using NSCs in the postnatal SVZ, showed that the stem cell is restricted to developing into different neuronal sub-type cells in the [[olfactory bulb]].  It is believed that the various spatial location niches regulate the differentiation of the neural stem cell.&lt;ref name='development'&gt;{{cite journal| author=Duan, X. |author2=Kang, E. |author3=Liu, C. Y. |author4=Ming, G. L. |author5=Song, H. |year=2008|title= Development of neural stem cell in the adult brain |journal= Curr Opin Neurobiol |volume=18 | issue = 1 |pages=108–115 |doi= 10.1016/j.conb.2008.04.001|pmc=2464621 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurogenesis in the central nervous system==
{{main|neuroregeneration}}

[[Santiago Ramon y Cajal]], a neuroscience pioneer, concluded that the generation of neurons occurs only in the [[Prenatal development|prenatal]] phase of human development, not after birth.  This theory had long been the fundamental principle of [[neuroscience]].&lt;ref name='ming' /&gt;  However, in the mid-20th century, evidence of adult mammalian [[neurogenesis]] was found in rodent hippocampus and other region of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Altman J. |title=Autoradiographic and histological studies of postnatal neurogenesis. II. A longitudinal investigation of the kinetics, migration and transformation of cells incorporating tritiated thymidine in infant rats, with special reference to postnatal neurogenesis in some brain regions | year=1966 |journal=J. Comp. Neurol. |pages=431–74 |doi=10.1002/cne.901280404 |volume=128 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the intact adult mammalian brain, [[neuroregeneration]] maintains the function and structure of the [[central nervous system]] (CNS).  The most adult stem cells in the brain are found in the subventricular zone at the lateral walls of the lateral ventricle.  Another region where neurogenesis takes place in the adult brain is the [[subgranular zone]] (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus.  While the exact mechanism that maintains functional NSCs in these regions is still unknown, NSCs have shown an ability to restore neurons and glia in response to certain [[Pathology|pathological]] conditions.  However, so far, this regeneration by NSCs is insufficient to restore the full function and structure of an injured brain.  However, endogenous neuroregeneration, unlike using embryonic stem cell implantation, is anticipated to treat damaged CNS without immunogenesis or [[Carcinogenesis|tumorigenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ninette Amariglio A. H. |author2=Bernd W, Scheithauer |author3=Yoram Cohen |year=2009 |title=Donor-Derived Brain Tumor Following Neural Stem Cell Transplantation in an Ataxia Telangiectasia Patient|journal= PLOS Medicine |volume=6 | issue = 2 |pages= 221–231 |url=http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1000029 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurogenesis in subgranular zone==
[[Progenitor cells]] in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus migrate to the nearby location and differentiate into granule cells. As a part of the [[limbic system]], new neurons of the hippocampus maintain the function of controlling mood, learning and memory.  In the dentate gyrus, [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/putative putative] stem cells, called type 1 cells, proliferate into type 2 and type 3 cells, which are transiently amplifying, lineage-determined progenitor cells.  Type 1 cells in the hippocampus are multipotent ''in vitro''.  However, although there is evidence that both new neurons and glia are generated in the hippocampus ''in vivo'', no exact relationship of neurogenesis to type 1 cells is shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gerd Kempermann |author2=Sebastian Jessberger |author3=Barbara Steiner |author4=Golo Kronenberg |title=Milestones of neuronal development in the adult hippocampus |journal = Trends in Neurosciences |volume = 27 | issue = 8 | year = 2004|doi=10.1016/j.tins.2004.05.013|url=http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences//retrieve/pii/S0166223604001675_returnURL=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0166223604001675?showall=true |pages=447–452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the hippocampus, newly formed neurons contribute only a small portion to the entire neuron population.  These new neurons have different [[electrophysiology]] compared to the rest of the existing neurons.  This may be evidence that generating new neurons in the SGZ is part of learning and memorizing activity of mammals.  Several studies have been performed to explain the relationship between neruogenesis and learning.  In the case of learning, that related to the hippocampal function, a significantly increased number of neurons are generated in the SGZ and survival of the new neurons is increased if they are required for retention of memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bendetta Leuner |author2=Sabrina Mendolia-Loffredo |author3=Yevgenia Kozorovitskiy |author4=Deanna Samburg |author5=Elizabeth Gould |author6=Tracey J. Shors |title = Learning Enhances the Survival of New Neurons beyond the Time when the Hippocampus Is Required for Memory |year =2004 |journal = The Journal of Neuroscience |volume =24 | issue = 34 |pages = 7477–7481|url=http://www.jneurosci.org/content/24/34/7477.full.pdf |doi=10.1523/jneurosci.0204-04.2004 |pmid=15329394 |pmc=3279157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Elizabeth Gould |author2=Anna Beylin |author3=Patima Tanapat |author4=Alison Reeves |author5=Tracey J.

In addition to learning and memorizing, neurogenesis in the SGZ is also affected by mood and emotion.  With constant, inescapable stress, which usually results in emotional depression, there is a significant decrease in neurogensis, the effect of which can be reversed by treatment with [[fluoxetine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Fluoxetine Treatment | year = 2003 |journal = Neuropsychopharmacology |volume = 28 |pages = 1562–1571 |doi=10.1038/sj.npp.1300234 |issue=9 |title = Cell Proliferation in Adult Hippocampus is Decreased by Inescapable Stress: Reversal by Fluoxetine Treatment |pmid = 12838272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurogenesis in subventricular zone==
The largest NSC population in the brain is found in the SVZ.  The SVZ is considered a micro-environment called a "stem cell niche" that retains the NSC's capacity of self-renewing and multipotency.  Basic [[fibroblast]] growth factor (FGF2), [[hepatocyte growth factor]] (HGF), [[Notch-1]], [[sonic hedgehog]] (SHH), [[Noggin (protein)|noggin]], [[ciliary neurotrophic factor]] (CNTF), and a soluble carbohydrate-binding protein, [[Galectin-1]], are reported as factors that maintain such properties of NSC in stem cell niche.  Like stem cells in SGZ, progenitor cells in SVZ also differentiate into neurons and form an intermediate cell called a transiently amplifying cell (TAC).  A recent study revealed that [[beta-catenin]] signaling, Wnt β-catenin, regulates the differentiation of TAC.&lt;ref name='gene'&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Naoko Kaneko |author2=Eisuke Kako |author3=Kazunobu Sawamoto |title=Prospects and Limitations of Using Endogenous Neural Stem Cells for Brain Regeneration |year =2011 |journal = Genes |volume = 2 |pages = 107–130 |doi = 10.3390/genes2010107 | issue =4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NSCs in the SVZ have a distinct capacity to migrate into the olfactory bulb in the anterior tip of the [[Cerebrum|telencephalon]]
by a pathway called the [[rostral migratory stream]] (RMS).  This migration is unique to new neurons in the SVZ that embryonic neurogenesis and nerogenesis at other region of the brain are not able to perform.  Another unique neurogensis in the SVZ is neurogenesis by astrocytes.  A study done by Doetsch (1999) showed that astrocytes in the SVZ can be dedifferentiate and differentiate into neurons in the olfactory bulb.  Among four types of cells in the SVZ (migrating neuroblasts, immature precursors, astrocytes, and [[ependyma]]l cells), migrating neuroblasts and immature precursors are silenced with the anti-[[Mitosis|mitotic]] agent and astrocytes are infected with a [[retrovirus]].  In the result, neurons that have the retrovirus are found in the olfactory bulb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Doetsch, F. |author2=Isabelle, C. |author3=Lim, D. A. |title=Subventricular Zone Astrocytes Are Neural Stem Cells in the Adult Mammalian Brain |year=1999 |journal = Cell |pages= 703–716 |volume=97 |doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80783-7 |pmid = 10380923 |issue = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors affecting neurogenesis==
Neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain is affected by various factors, including exercise, [[stroke]], brain [[Insult (medical)|insult]] and pharmacological treatments.  For example, [[kainic acid]]-induced seizures, antidepressant ([[fluoxetine]]), [[neurotransmitter]]s such as [[GABA]] and growth factors ([[fibroblast growth factors]] (FGFs), [[epidermal growth factor]] (EGF), [[neuregulins]] (NRGs), [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF), and [[pigment epithelium-derived factor]] (PEDF) induce formation of neuroblasts.  The final destination of NSCs is determined by "niche" signals.  [[Wnt signaling pathway|Wnt]] signaling drives NSCs to the formation of new neurons in the SGZ, whereas bone [[Morphogenesis|morphogenic]] proteins (BMPs) promote NSC differentiation into glia cells in the SVZ.&lt;ref name='development' /&gt;

However, in the case of brain injury, neurogenesis seems insufficient to repair damaged neurons.  Thus, Cajal's theory was accepted for a long time.  In actuality, in the intercranial physiological condition, many neurogenesis inhibitors are present (for example, [[axon]] growth-inhibitory [[ligand]]s expressed in [[oligodendrocytes]], [[myelin]], NG2-glia, and reactive astrocytes in the lesion and degenerating tracts, and fibroblasts in scar tissue).  The inhibitory ligands bind to [[growth cone]] receptors on a damaged neuron, which causes repulsion and collapse of the growth cone in the damaged regions.  Among inhibitory factors, oligodendrocyte and myelin-derived inhibitory ligands are membrane-bound, meaning that, in the case of injury, those factors are not upregulated or overexpressed, rather it is from direct contact between intact or degraded myelin (or oligodendrocytes) and newly forming neurons.

Nevertheless, with scar formation, many cell types in the brain release growth-inhibitory ligands such as [[basal lamina]] components, inhibitory axon guidance molecules and [[chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=AXEL SANDVIG |author2=MARTIN BERRY |author3=LEE B. BARRETT |author4=ARTHUR BUTT |author5=AND ANN LOGAN |title=Myelin-, Reactive Glia-, and Scar-Derived CNS Axon Growth Inhibitors:Expression, Receptor Signaling, and Correlation with Axon Regeneration |journal =GLIA |year=2004 |volume =46 |pages=225–251 | doi= 10.1002/glia.10315 | pmid= 15048847 | issue= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Inhibitory action of such factors may be a protection of the brain from inflammation.  Okano and Sawamoto used an astrocyte-selective conditional [[Stat3]]-deficient mice model to examine the role of reactive astrocytes.  The result was increased widespread [[CD11b]]-positive inflammatory cell invasion and [[Demyelinating disease|demyelination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hideyuki Okano |author2=Kazunobu Sawamoto |title=Neural stem cells: involvement in adult neurogenesis and CNS repair |year=2012 |journal = Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B |volume=363 |pages=2111–2122 |doi =10.1098/rstb.2008.2264 | issue =1500 | pmid =18339601 | pmc =2610183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
Brain damage itself can induce endogenous regeneration.  Many studies have proven endogenous regeneration as a possible treatment of brain damage.  However, the inhibitory reaction of the surrounding tissue of damaged region must be overcome before the treatment produces significant improvement.

===Traumatic brain injury===
In the study of the endogenous regeneration of the brain done by Scharff and co-researchers, damaged neurons in a songbird brain are regenerated with the same neuronal types where regeneration occurs (in the case of the study, the hippocampus).  However, in places where normal regeneration of the neuron does not occur, there was no replacement of damaged neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Scharff C, Kirn JR, Grossman M, Macklis JD, Nottebohm F |title =Targeted neuronal death affects neuronal replacement and vocal behavior in adult songbirds |journal=Neuron |year =2002|pages =481–492 |volume=25 |doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(00)80910-1 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, recovering brain function after a brain injury was supposed to have limitations.  However, a current study revealed that neurons are repaired to some degree after damage, from the SVZ.

The migrating ability of progenitor cells in the SVZ form chain-like structures and laterally move progenitor cells towards the injured region. Along with progenitor cells, thin astrocytic processes and blood vessels also play an important role in the migration of neuroblasts, suggesting that the blood vessels may act as a scaffold.  Other factors that contribute of the migration are [[Slit (gene family)|slit proteins]] (produced at the [[choroid plexus]]) and their gradient (generated by the flow of [[cerebrospinal fluid]]).  However, only 0.2% of new neurons survived and functioned in this study.  Enhancing neurogenesis can be done by injecting growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and epidermal growth factor (EGF).  However, enhanced neurogenesis also have the possibility of [[epilepsy]] resulting in prolonged seizures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Okano H, Sakaguchi M, Ohki K, Suzuki N, Sawamoto K |title=Regeneration of the central nervous system using endogenous repair mechanisms |year=2007 |journal =J Neurochem |pages=1459–1465 |volume=102 |doi=10.1111/j.1471-4159.2007.04674.x |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parkinson's Disease===
Although endogenous regeneration methods are showing some promising evidence in treating [[brain ischemia]], the current body of knowledge regarding promoting and inhibiting endogenous regeneration is not sufficient to treat [[Parkinson's disease]].  Both extrinsic and intrinsic modulation of pathological and physiological stimulation prevent the progenitor cell from differentiating into [[dopamine]] cells.  Further research must be done to understand factors that affect progenitor cell differentiation in order to treat Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Andreas Hermann |author2=Alexander Storch |title=Endogenous Regeneration in Parkinson's Disease: Do We Need Orthotopic Dopaminergic Neurogenesis? |year=2008 |journal=Stem Cells |volume=26 |pages=2749–2752 |doi=10.1634/stemcells.2008-0567 |issue=11 |pmid=18719222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the difficulties in replacing compromised dopamine neurons through endogenous sources, recent work suggests that pharmacological activation of endogenous [[neural stem cell]]s or neural precursor cells results in powerful neuronal rescue and motor skill improvements through a signal [[Transduction (biophysics)|transduction]] pathway that involves the [[phosphorylation]] of [[STAT3]] on the [[serine]] residue and subsequent Hes3 expression increase ([[Hes3 signaling axis|STAT3-Ser/Hes3 Signaling Axis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Androutsellis-Theotokis A, Rueger MA, Park DM |title=Targeting neural precursors in the adult brain rescues injured dopamine neurons |journal=Proc.

==Decomposition==

Decomposition is a continuous process that is commonly divided into stages for convenience of discussion.&lt;ref name= Payne&gt;{{cite journal|last= Payne|first= J.A.|title= A summer carrion study of the baby pig sus scrofa Linnaeus|journal= Ecology|volume= 46|issue= 5|pages= 511–523|year= 1965 | doi=10.2307/1934999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Grassberger&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Grassberger M. |author2=Frank C. |title= Initial study of arthropod succession on pig carrion in a central Europe urban habitat|journal= Journal of Medical Entomology|volume= 41|issue= 3|pages= 511–523|year= 2004|doi= 10.1603/0022-2585-41.3.511}}&lt;/ref&gt; When studying decomposition from an entomological point of view and for the purpose of applying data to human death investigations, the [[domestic pig]] Sus scrofa (Linnaeus) is considered to be the preferred human analogs.&lt;ref name= Anderson/&gt; In entomological studies, five [[Decomposition#Stages|stages of decomposition]] are commonly described: (1) Fresh, (2) Bloat, (3) Active Decay, (4) Advanced or  Post-Decay, and (5) Dry Remains.&lt;ref name= Anderson/&gt;&lt;ref name= Gennard&gt;{{cite book|last= Gennard|first= D.E.|title= Forensic Entomology: An Introduction|publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd|year= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the pattern of arthropod colonization follows a reasonably predictable sequence, the limits of each stage of decomposition will not necessarily coincide with a major change in the faunal community. Therefore, the stages of decomposition are defined by the observable physical changes to the state of the carcass.&lt;ref name= Schoenly&gt;{{cite journal|author= Schoenly K., Reid, W.|title= Dynamics of heterotrophic succession in carrion arthropod assemblages: discrete seres or a continuum of change?|journal= Oecologia|volume= 73|pages= 192–202|year= 1987|doi= 10.1007/BF00377507|issue= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pattern of insect succession results as different [[carrion insects]] are attracted to the varying biological, chemical and physical changes a carcass undergoes throughout the process of decay.&lt;ref name= Anderson/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A decaying carcass provides "a temporarily, rapidly changing resource which supports a large, dynamic arthropod community." --M. Grassberger and C. Frank &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Fresh stage===
[[File:Example of a pig carcass in the fresh stage of decomposition.jpg|thumb|right|Pig carcass in the fresh stage of decomposition]]

The fresh stage of decomposition is generally described as the period between the moment of death and when the first signs of bloat are apparent.&lt;ref name= Anderson/&gt;&lt;ref name= Grassberger/&gt; There are no outward signs of physical change, though internal bacteria have begun to digest organ tissues.&lt;ref name= Kreitlow/&gt; No odor is associated with the carcass.&lt;ref name= Anderson/&gt;&lt;ref name= Grassberger/&gt; Early post-mortem changes, used by pathologists as medical markers for early post-mortem interval estimations, have been described by Goff and include [[livor mortis]], [[rigor mortis]] and [[algor mortis]].

The first insects to arrive at decomposing remains are usually [[Calliphoridae]], commonly referred to as blow flies. These flies have been reported to arrive within minutes of death or exposure, and deposit eggs within 1–3 hours. Adult flies of the families [[Flesh-fly|Sarcophagidae]] (flesh flies) and [[Muscidae]] are also common in this first stage of decomposition. First eggs are laid in or near the natural orifices of the head and anus, as well as at the site of perimortem wounds.&lt;ref name= Anderson/&gt; Depending on the rate of decomposition and the development time of particular blowfly species, eggs may hatch and young larvae begin to feed on tissues and liquids while the carcass is still classified in the fresh stage.&lt;ref name= Rodriguez&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Rodriguez W.C. |author2=Bass W.M. |title= Insect activity and its relationship to decay rates of human cadavers in East Tennessee|journal= Journal of Forensic Sciences|volume= 28|issue= 2|pages= 423–432|year= 1983 | doi=10.1520/JFS11524J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adult [[ant]]s may also be seen at a carcass during the fresh stage. Ants will feed both on the carcass flesh as well as eggs and young larvae of first arriving flies.&lt;ref name= Payne/&gt;

===Bloat stage===
[[File:Example of a pig carcass in the bloat stage of decomposition.jpg|thumb|right|Pig carcass in the bloat stage of decomposition]]

The first visible sign of the Bloat Stage is a slight inflation of the abdomen and some blood bubbles at the nose.&lt;ref name= Payne/&gt; Activity of anaerobic bacteria in the abdomen create gases, which accumulate and results in abdominal bloating.&lt;ref name= Anderson/&gt; A colour change is observed in the carcass flesh, along with the appearance of marbling. During the bloat stage the odor of [[putrefaction]] becomes noticeable.&lt;ref name= Grassberger/&gt;

Blowflies remain present in great numbers during the bloat stage, and blowflies, flesh flies and muscids continue to lay eggs. Insects of the families [[Piophilidae]] and [[Fanniidae]] arrive during the bloat stage. Ants continue to feed on the eggs and young larvae of flies.&lt;ref name= Payne/&gt;&lt;ref name= Grassberger/&gt;

The first species of [[Coleoptera]] arrive during the bloat stage of decomposition, including members of the families [[Staphylinidae]] (rove beetles), [[Silphidae]] (carrion beetles) and [[Cleridae]]. These beetles are observed feeding on fly eggs and larvae.&lt;ref name= Anderson/&gt;&lt;ref name= Grassberger/&gt; Beetle species from the families [[Histeridae]] may also be collected during this stage, and are often hidden beneath remains.&lt;ref name= Payne/&gt;&lt;ref name= Grassberger/&gt;

===Active decay stage===
[[File:Example of a pig carcass in the active decay stage of decomposition.jpg|thumb|right|Pig carcass in the active decay stage of decomposition]]

The beginning of active decay stage is marked by the deflation of the carcass as feeding [[Fly|Dipteran]] larvae pierce the skin and internal gases are released. During this stage the carcass has a characteristic wet appearance due to the liquefaction of tissues. Flesh from the head and around the anus and umbilical cord is removed by larval feeding activity.&lt;ref name= Payne/&gt; A strong odor of putrefaction is associated with the carcass.&lt;ref name= Anderson/&gt;

Feeding larvae of Calliphoridae flies are the dominant insect group at carcasses during the active decay stage.&lt;ref name= Anderson/&gt; At the beginning of the stage larvae are concentrated in natural orifices, which offer the least resistance to feeding. Towards later stages, when flesh has been removed from the head and orifices, larvae become more concentrated in the thoracic and abdominal cavities.&lt;ref name= Payne/&gt;

Adult calliphorids and muscids decreased in numbers during this stage, and were not observed to be mating.&lt;ref name= Payne/&gt; However, non-Calliphoridae Dipterans are collected from carcasses.&lt;ref name= Anderson/&gt; The first members of [[Sepsidae]] arrive at the carcass during the active decay stage. Members of Coleoptera become the dominant adult insects at the site of remains. In particular, the numbers of staphylinids and histerids increase.&lt;ref name= Payne/&gt;

===Advanced decay stage===
[[File:Example of a pig carcass in the advanced decay stage of decomposition.jpg|thumb|right|Pig carcass in the advanced decay stage of decomposition]]
[[File:Example of a pig carcass in the dry decay stage of decomposition.jpg|thumb|right|Pig carcass in the dry/remains stage of decomposition]]
[[File:Decomposition00.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Blowfly and fly larvae on 5-day old corpse of [[South African porcupine]] (Hystrix africaeaustralis)]]

Most of the flesh is removed from the carcass during the advanced decay stage, though some flesh may remain in the abdominal cavity. Strong odors of decomposition begin to fade.&lt;ref name= Anderson/&gt;&lt;ref name= Payne/&gt;

This stage marks the first mass migration of third instar calliphorid larvae from the carcass  Piophilidae larvae may also be collected at this stage.&lt;ref name= Anderson/&gt;&lt;ref name= Grassberger/&gt; Few adult calliphoridae are attracted to carcasses in advanced decay. Adult [[Dermestidae]] (skin beetles) arrive at the carcass;&lt;ref name= Grassberger/&gt; adult dermestid beetles may be common, whereas larval stages are not&lt;ref name= Anderson/&gt;

===Dry decay===
The final stage of decomposition is dry remains. Payne described a total of six stages of decay, the last two being separate dry and remains. As these stages are nearly impossible to distinguish between, many entomological studies combine the two into a single final stage. Very little remains of the carcass in this stage, mainly bones, cartilage and small bits of dried skin. There is little to no odor associated with remains.&lt;ref name= Anderson/&gt;&lt;ref name= Grassberger/&gt; Any odor present may range from that of dried skin to wet fur.&lt;ref name= Payne/&gt;

The greatest number of species are reported to occur in the late decay and dry stages.&lt;ref name= Anderson/&gt;&lt;ref name= Payne/&gt; The dry decay stage is characterized by the movement from previously dominant carrion fauna to new species.&lt;ref name= Payne/&gt; Very few adult calliphorids are attracted to the carcass at this stage,&lt;ref name= Grassberger/&gt; and adult piophilids emerge.&lt;ref name= Anderson/&gt; The dermestid beetles, common in advanced decay, leave the carcass. Non-carrion organisms that commonly arrive at remains in dry decay are centipedes, millipedes, isopods, snails and cockroaches.&lt;ref name= Payne/&gt;

==Factors affecting decomposition==

{{main|Environmental effects on forensic entomology}}
Understanding how a corpse decomposes and the factors that may alter the rate of decay is extremely important for evidence in death investigations. Campobasso, Vella, and Introna consider the factors that may inhibit or favor the colonization of insects to be vitally important when determining the time of insect colonization.&lt;ref name="Campobasso" /&gt;

===Temperature and climate===

Low temperatures generally slow down the activity of blow-flies and their colonization of a body. Higher temperatures in the summer favor large maggot masses on the carrion. Dry and windy environments can dehydrate a corpse, leading to mummification. Dryness causes cessation in bacterial growth since there are no nutrients present to feed on.

===Access===

Access to the body can limit which insects can get to the body in order to feed and lay eggs. Those circumstances that enhance the availability of corpses for arthropod colonization are called "physical barriers". For example, corpses found in brightly lit areas are generally inhabited by ''[[Lucilia illustris]]'', in contrast to ''[[Phormia regina]]'', which prefers more shaded areas. Darkness, cold, and rain limit the amount of insects that would otherwise colonize the body. A submerged corpse can vary in temperature and is colonized by very few terrestrial insects. Fish, [[crustacean]]s, aquatic insects &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Haskell NH, McShaffrey DG, Hawley DA, Williams RE, Pless JE | title=Use of aquatic insects in determining submersion interval | journal=J. Forensic Sci. | year=1989 | volume=34 | issue=3 | pages=622-6326}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=González Medina A, Soriano Hernando Ó, Jiménez Ríos G | title=The Use of the Developmental Rate of the Aquatic Midge ''Chironomus riparius'' (Diptera, Chironomidae) in the Assessment of the Postsubmersion Interval | journal=J. Forensic Sci. | year=2015 | volume=60 | issue=3 | pages=822–826 | doi=10.1111/1556-4029.12707}}&lt;/ref&gt; and bacteria would be the likely fauna in this case. Bodies that have been buried are harder to get to than freely available bodies which limits the availability of certain insects to colonize. The  Coffin fly ''[[Megaselia scalaris]]'' is one of the few fly species seen on buried bodies because it has the ability to dig up to six feet underground to reach a body and oviposit.

===Reduction and cause of death===

[[Scavengers]] and [[carnivores]] such as wolves, dogs, cats, beetles, and other insects feeding on the remains of a carcass can make determining the time of insect colonization much harder. This is because the decomposition process has been interrupted by factors that may speed up decomposition. Corpses with open wounds, whether pre or post mortem, tend to decompose faster due to easier insect access. The cause of death likewise can leave openings in the body that allow insects and bacteria access to the inside body cavities in earlier stages of decay. Flies oviposit eggs inside natural openings and wounds that may become exaggerated when the eggs hatch and the larvae begin feeding.

===Clothing and pesticides===

Wraps, garments, and clothing have shown to affect the rate of decomposition because the corpse is covered by some type of barrier. Wraps, such as tight fighting tarps can advance the stages of decay during warm weather when the body is outside. However, loose fitting coverings that are open on the ends may aid colonization of certain insect species and keep the insects protected from the outside environment. This boost in colonization can lead to faster decomposition. Clothing also provides a protective barrier between the body and insects that can delay stages of decomposition. For instance, if a corpse is wearing a heavy jacket, this can slow down decomposition in that particular area and insects will colonize elsewhere. Bodies that are covered in [[pesticides]] or in an area surrounded in [[pesticides]] may be slow to have insect colonization. The absence of insects feeding on the body would slow down the rate of decomposition.

===Percent body fat of corpse===

More [[body fat|fat on the body]] allows for faster decomposition. This is due to the composition of fat, which is high in water content. Larger corpses with higher percent [[body fat]] also tend to retain heat much longer than corpses with less body fat. Higher temperatures favor the reproduction of bacteria inside high nutrient areas of the liver and other organs.

===Drugs===

On occasion, drugs that are present in the body at death can also affect how fast insects break down the corpse. Development of these insects can be sped up by [[cocaine]] and slowed down by drugs containing [[arsenic]].&lt;ref name="Campobasso"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=11457604 | year=2001 | last1=Campobasso | first1=CP | last2=Di Vella | first2=G | last3=Introna | first3=F | title=Factors affecting decomposition and Diptera colonization | volume=120 | issue=1–2 | pages=18–27 | journal=Forensic Science International | doi=10.1016/S0379-0738(01)00411-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carloyne"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1662/0002-7685(2003)065[0360:OMMFEI]2.0.CO;2 | year = 2003 | volume = 65 | pages = 360–366 | title = Of Maggots &amp; Murder: Forensic Entomology in the Classroom | last1 = Carloye | first1 = Lisa | journal = The American Biology Teacher | issue = 5  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current research==

New research in the related field [[entomotoxicology]] is currently studying the effects of drugs on the development of insects who have fed on the decomposing tissue of a drug user. The effects of drugs and toxins on insect development are proving to be an important factor when determining the insect colonization time. It has been shown that cocaine use can accelerate the development of maggots. In one case, ''Lucilia sericata'' larvae that fed in the nasal cavity of a cocaine abuser, grew over 8&amp;nbsp;mm longer than larvae of the same generation found elsewhere on the body.&lt;ref name="Introna"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Introna | first1 = Francesco | last2 = Campobasso | first2 = Carlo P. | last3 = Goff | first3 = Madison L. | year = 2001 | title = Entomotoxicology | url = | journal = Forensic Science International | volume = 120 | issue = | pages = 42–47 | doi=10.1016/s0379-0738(01)00418-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers in entomotoxicology are developing techniques to detect and measure drug levels in older fly pupae. This research is useful for determining cause of death for bodies that are found during later stages of decay. To this date, [[bromazepam]], [[levomepromazine]], [[malathion]], [[phenobarbital]], [[trazolam]], [[oxazepam]], [[alimemazine]], [[clomipramine]], [[morphine]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[copper]] have been recovered from maggots.&lt;ref name="Catts"&gt;Catts, E. P. and N. H. Haskell, ed. Entomology &amp; Death: A Procedural Guide. 4th ed. Clemson, SC: Joyce's Print Shop, Inc., 1990. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusion==

Understanding the stages of decomposition, the colonization of insects, and factors that may affect decomposition and colonization are key in determining forensically important information about the body. Different insects colonize the body throughout the stage of decomposition.&lt;ref name= Anderson/&gt; In entomological studies these stages are commonly described as fresh, bloat, active decay, advanced decay and dry decay.&lt;ref name= Anderson/&gt;&lt;ref name= Payne/&gt; Studies have shown that each stage is characterized by particular insect species, the succession of which depends on chemical and physical properties of remains, rate of decomposition and environmental factors.&lt;ref name= Payne/&gt; Insects associated with decomposing remains may be useful in determining post-mortem interval, manner of death, and the association of suspects.&lt;ref name= Catts/&gt; Insect species and their times of colonization will vary according to the geographic region,&lt;ref name= Anderson/&gt; and therefore may help determine if remains have been moved.&lt;ref name= Catts/&gt;

'''GD 61''' is a [[white dwarf]] with a planetary system located 150 light-years from Earth in the constellation [[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/water-seen-rubble-around-star|title=Water seen in rubble around star

In 2013, a circumstellar disk that resulted from the destruction of a water-rich asteroid was detected in close orbit around GD 61, which makes this the first detection of solid or liquid water on an [[wikt:extrasolar|extrasolar]] body. This asteroid would originally have been 26% water by mass, close to the water content of [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]].&lt;ref name=circumstellar&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.3269.pdf Evidence for water in the rocky debris of a disrupted extrasolar minor planet]&lt;/ref&gt; This evidence suggests that a planet, with a rocky surface similar to Earth's, may have existed in the past, with the asteroid thus being an artifact from this period, now possibly part of a debris field from the hypothetical planet's breakup.

'''Giovanni Carmelo Verga''' (Vizzini, 2 September 1840  – Catania, 27 January 1922) was  an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Literary realism|realist]] (''[[Verismo (literature)|Verismo]]'') writer, best known for his depictions of life in his native [[Sicily]], especially the [[short story]] (and later play) ''"[[:it:Cavalleria rusticana (novella)|Cavalleria rusticana]]"'' and the novel ''[[I Malavoglia]]'' (''The House by the Medlar Tree'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Editors |first=The |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/626007/Giovanni-Verga |title=Giovanni Verga &amp;#124; Italian author |publisher=Britannica.com |date=1922-01-27 |accessdate=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
The first son of Giovanni Battista Catalano Verga and Caterina Di Mauro, Verga was born into a prosperous family of [[Catania]] in Sicily. He began writing in his teens, producing the largely unpublished, but currently quite famous, [[historical novel]] ''Amore e Patria'' (''Love and Country''); then, although nominally studying [[law]] at the [[University of Catania]], he used money his father had given him to publish his ''I carbonari della montagna'' (''The Carbonari of the Mountain'') in 1861 and 1862. This was followed by ''Sulle lagune'' (''On the Lagoons'') in 1863.

[[File:Ritratto penna e acq. verga.jpg|thumb|left|190px|Portrait of Verga, by [[Antonino Gandolfo]].]]

Meanwhile, Verga had been serving in the [[Catania National Guard]] (1860–64), after which he travelled to [[Florence]] several times, settling there in 1869.

He moved to [[Milan]] in 1872, where he developed his new approach, characterized by the use of [[dialogue]] to develop character, which resulted in his most significant works. In 1880 his story collection ''Vita dei campi'' (''Life in the Fields''), including ''"Fantasticheria"'' ("Daydreaming"), ''"[[La Lupa (story)|La lupa]]"'' ("The She-wolf"), ''"[[Jeli il pastore]]"'' ("Jeli the Shepherd"), ''"Pentolaccia"'' ("The Plaything"), and ''[[Rosso Malpelo]]'', most of which were about rural Sicily, came out. It also included ''"Cavalleria rusticana"'' ("Rustic Chivalry"), which he adapted for the [[theatre]] and later formed the basis for several opera [[libretto]]s including [[Pietro Mascagni|Mascagni]]'s ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' and [[Stanislao Gastaldon|Gastaldon]]'s ''[[Mala Pasqua!]]''. Verga's short story, ''"Malaria"'', was one of the first literary depictions of the disease malaria.

He then embarked on a projected series of five novels, but only completed two, ''[[I Malavoglia]]'' and ''[[Mastro-don Gesualdo]]'' (1889), the second of which was the last major work of his literary career. Both are widely recognized as masterpieces.

In 1894 Verga moved back to Catania, to the house in which he had lived as a child. In 1920 he was appointed  Senator of the Kingdom ''(Senatore del Regno)'' for life ''(ad vitam)''. He died of a cerebral [[thrombosis]] in 1922.

The [[Teatro Verga]] in Catania is named after him. His house in ''via Sant'Anna'' is now a museum, the ''Casa-Museo Giovanni Verga''.

He was an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;Cigliana, Simona; Fedi, Roberto (2002). ''Giovanni Verga''. Rome: Istituto Poligrafico e Zecca dello Stato.  p. 287. (in Italian).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==
''How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time'' has forty chapters, which are grouped into six parts.

=== Part I. The Problem: We Need to Make Decisions, But We Don't Know How (Chapters 1–6) ===

For ethical advice to be credible, the book says it cannot be perceived as arbitrary.  The book cites [[The Dice Man]] – a man who makes choices based on dice rolls – as an example of advice-following which is arbitrary and so cannot be regarded as ethical.

Chapter three argues intuitions about what we should do can be more useful, but are undermined because our multiple intuitions often lead to contradictory advice (e.g. ‘help a stranger’ or ‘put family first’?).  Philosophers have sought to eliminate these contradictions by locating right and wrong in a single part of the decision-making process: for example, in the actions we take (e.g. [[Kant]]), in our character (e.g. [[Aristotle]], [[virtue ethics]]) or in the consequences of our actions (e.g. [[Utilitarianism]]).

Chapter four explains how ‘do whatever is best’ (utilitarianism) still dominates modern philosophical and economic thinking.

Chapter five cites seven faults with utilitarianism.  These are that it can be self-defeating; that it considers only future events and ignores the past; that it places decision-making authority in questionable hands; that it doesn’t discriminate fairly between people; that it sacrifices individual concerns to the group interest; that it down-grades promises, fairness and truth-telling; and that it doesn’t offer any clear rules.&lt;ref name="iainbking.files.wordpress.com"&gt;[https://iainbking.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/how-to-make-good-decisions-62-point-summary.pdf ''How to Make Good Decisions...'' a 62 point summary (pdf)]&lt;/ref&gt; The chapter also argues that the main argument for utilitarianism is invalid, and ‘empty’.&lt;ref&gt;http://leehopkins.com/counselling/2015/11/12/ethics-condundrum-1/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Part II. The Proof: Finding the Basics of Right and Wrong (Chapters 7–14) ===

Part II starts with a secular revision of [[Pascal’s Wager]],&lt;ref name="24 and Philosophy King"/&gt; arguing “What does it hurt to pursue value and virtue? If there is value, then we have everything to gain, but if there is none, then we haven’t lost anything.” Thus, it rationally makes sense for us to pursue something of value.&lt;ref name="24 and Philosophy King"/&gt;

It says that “people ultimately derive their choices from what they want to do and what other people want to do” &lt;ref&gt;[http://petergreenwell.com/essays/did-angela-do-good-or-bad/ ''Did Angela do Good or Bad?'' Peter Greenwell, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

It then presents four different arguments for deriving a basic principle from which right and wrong can be developed.  These are an adaptation of utilitarianism; an adaptation of [[John Rawls|John Rawls']] theory;&lt;ref name="iainbking.files.wordpress.com"/&gt; an argument from evolutionary theory;&lt;ref&gt;[https://philosophynow.org/issues/100/Moral_Laws_of_the_Jungle ''Moral Laws of the Jungle'', Philosophy Now magazine, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; and a '[[Sherlock Holmes]]' approach.

All four arguments converge on [[empathy]], [[duty|obligation]] and the ‘Help Principle’, which the book argues are kernels of a viable ethical system.&lt;ref name="24 and Philosophy King"/&gt; According to [[Audrey Tang]], King's philosophy advocates: "If spending one unit of your effort could help another person by two units, he detailed in his book, you should help."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/open-source-enlightenment-2015-part-1-audrey-tang ''Open Source Enlightenment'', Audrey Tang, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Part III. The Principle: Refining the Help Principle (Chapters 15–22) ===

Part III defines the Help Principle more carefully, with a section on [[autonomy]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ijbioethics.ir/fa/ManuscriptDetail?mid=5331 International Journal of Bio-Ethics, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; and a critique of the [[Golden Rule#Cannot be a sole guide to action|golden rule]].

It results in an approach to ethics which combines deontology, consequentialism and virtue ethics.  This has been described as quasi-utilitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;D’Souza, J. F. and Adams, C. K. (2016). "On Measuring the Moral Value of Action". ''Frontiers of Philosophy in China''. 11(1), pp. 122–136.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Part IV. The Program: Extending the Principles to Other Problems (Chapters 23–31) ===

Part IV attempts to distinguish white lies from bad lies.&lt;ref name="Watkins"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schokking"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.christopherxjjensen.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/gendels-ross-research-paper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Contradicting [[Aristotle]], who believed no general rule on lying was possible, 'For he who advocates lying can never be believed or trusted,' and [[St Augustine]], who believed all lies were sinful, the book presents a definition of good lies, and argues why it is credible and superior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2012/02/05/imp06.asp Sunday Observer (Sri Lanka), February 5th, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethiomedia.com/15store/4259  ''The Conundrum of Illicit Financial Flows'', Teshome Abebe, November 14, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapters 28 and 29 reconcile individual human rights with group interests.  Both individual justice and social justice feature.

=== Part V. Practical Advice: For Real People in the Modern World (Chapters 32–38) ===

Part V deals with situations when information is not certain, and other real world problems which are absent from much academic philosophy.  These problems make [[effective altruism]] impractical and rare.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ispitphilo.wordpress.com/ ''Food for the Mind'', by Blake Hall, May 1, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter 34 argues that the notion of [[integrity]] can only make sense in ethics if it is applied to the consequences people allow to happen rather than to people themselves.

=== Part VI. The Prognosis: How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time (Chapters 39–40) ===

Part VI claims a hybrid system can be internally-consistent and address several problems of the main schools of ethics.&lt;ref name="24 and Philosophy King"/&gt;

Chapter 40 concludes it is impossible to make good decisions all the time because we can never know enough about the world, and the consequences of our actions.  Hence, ethics can never emulate the scientific revolution by offering a simple set of rules for every situation, similar to those derived by Newton.  This is because Newton’s own rules can never be applied perfectly, because we can never know how the world really is.

== About the book ==
It was published on December 1, 2008.&lt;ref name="pw"/&gt;  It became a bestseller within the category of philosophy books in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/bloomsburyacademic/docs/philosophy2013 Philosophy Books, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book answers the [[Expressivism#Objections to expressivism|Frege–Geach Problem]], the [[is ought problem|Fact–Value Gap]], and the [[Open Question Argument]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://talks.cam.ac.uk/talk/index/63048 'Moral Philosophy for Elves' (University of Cambridge, United Kingdom)]&lt;/ref&gt; although the given answers have been challenged.&lt;ref name=Crocker /&gt;&lt;ref name="iainbking.files.wordpress.com"/&gt;

The book has been used to reconcile [[utilitarian]] and [[deontology|rules-based]] ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |first=Jeevan |last=D'Souza |title=On Measuring the Moral Value of Action |publisher= Philos, China |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeevan_Dsouza2/publication/301688068_On_Measuring_the_Moral_Value_of_Action/links/59d8ee11a6fdcc2aad0d86cf/On-Measuring-the-Moral-Value-of-Action.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''Kobe child murders'''|神戸連続児童殺傷事件|Kōbe renzoku jidō sasshō jiken|lead=yes}} occurred in [[Kobe, Hyogo|Kobe, Japan]] on March 16 and May 27, 1997. Two victims, {{nihongo|Ayaka Yamashita|山下彩花|Yamashita Ayaka}}, age 10, and {{nihongo|Jun Hase|土師 淳|Hase Jun}}, age 11, were [[murder]]ed by a 14-year-old boy under the alias {{nihongo|'''Seito Sakakibara'''|酒鬼薔薇 聖斗|Sakakibara Seito}}.

The perpetrator was arrested on June 28, 1997 in connection with the Hase murder, and later confessed to both murders. As a [[minor (law)|juvenile]] offender, he was prosecuted and convicted as "Boy A". His real name has not been released to the press because [[Japanese law]] prohibits publishing the identification, but in some weekly magazines his real name has been reported. Beginning in 2004, "Boy A" was released on a provisional basis, with a full release announced to follow on January 1, 2005. The murders and subsequent release of the perpetrator gained widespread attention from Japanese media and politicians.

==The murders==
[[Image:Jun hase.jpg|150px|thumb|Murder victim Jun Hase]]
On May 27, 1997, the head of {{nihongo|Jun Hase|土師 淳|}}, a special education pupil at Tainohata Elementary School, was found in front of the school gate hours before pupils arrived for classes. Hase had been [[decapitation|beheaded]] with a handsaw, with further [[mutilation]]s being done before being left in front of the school, for students to discover when they arrived in the morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kobe murder |newspaper=Weekly Bunshun |date=July 24, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; A note, written in red pen, was found stuffed in his mouth, identifying the killer as "Sakakibara." The note read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"This is the beginning of the game... Try to stop me if you can you stupid police... I desperately want to see people die, it is a thrill for me to commit murder. A bloody judgment is needed for my years of great bitterness."''&lt;ref group ="notes"&gt;さあゲームの始まりです
愚鈍な警察諸君
ボクを止めてみたまえ
ボクは殺しが愉快でたまらない
人の死が見たくて見たくてしょうがない
汚い野菜共には死の制裁を
積年の大怨に流血の裁きを&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Additionally, some [[English language|English]] was on the note as well: "shooll{{sic}} killer".

Police commented that the style of Hase's killing and the note was reminiscent of that of the [[Zodiac Killer|Zodiac murders]] in the [[San Francisco]] area during the late 1960s.

On June 6, a letter was sent to the newspaper ''Kobe Shinbun'', in which Sakakibara claimed responsibility for the slaying and decapitation of Jun Hase, and threatened that more killings would follow. This second letter, delivered in a brown envelope postmarked June 3, had no return address or name. Enclosed was a three-page, 1400-word letter, also written in red ink, which included a six-character name that can be pronounced as "Sakakibara Seito". The same characters, which mean ''alcohol'', ''devil'', ''rose'', ''saint'' and ''fight'', were used in the first message that was inserted into the boy's mouth.

Beginning with the phrase "Now, it's the beginning of a game", the letter stated that "I am putting my life at stake for the sake of this game... If I'm caught, I'll probably be [[capital punishment in Japan|hanged]]... police should be angrier and more tenacious in pursuing me.... It's only when I kill that I am liberated from the constant hatred that I suffer and that I am able to attain peace. It is only when I give pain to people that I can ease my own pain." The letter also lashed out against the Japanese educational system, calling it "compulsory education that formed me, an invisible person."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimezzz.net/serialkillers/K/KOBE_school_killer.htm |title=Kobe School Killer |accessdate=2008-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the initial panic, the Japanese [[mass media|media]] misreported the name as "Onibara" - [[Demon]]'s [[Rose]], though the killer insisted it was as he gave it. Infuriated by the mixup, Sakakibara later wrote to the station, "From now on, if you misread my name or spoil my mood I will kill three vegetables a week.... If you think I can only kill children you are greatly mistaken." (In this context, the "vegetables" that Sakakibara meant were human).

The 14-year-old junior high school student was arrested as a suspect in the Hase murder on June 28. Shortly after his arrest, "Boy A" also confessed to the murder of 10-year-old Ayaka Yamashita (山下彩花 ''Yamashita Ayaka'') on March 16, as well as the [[assault]]s of three other girls on and around that same date. After the March 16 attack, he wrote in his [[diary]]: "I carried out sacred experiments today to confirm how fragile human beings are... I brought the hammer down, when the girl turned to face me. I think I hit her a few times but I was too excited to remember." The following week, on March 23, he added: "This morning my mom told me, 'Poor girl. The girl attacked seems to have died.' There is no sign of me being caught... I thank you, "Bamoidōkishin", for this... Please continue to protect me."

==Aftermath and controversy==
After the murders, Japanese politician [[Shizuka Kamei]] called for restricting objectionable content, stating, "Movies lacking any literary or educational merit made for just showing cruel scenes... Adults should be blamed for this", and that "[the incident] gives adults the chance to rethink the policy of self-imposed restrictions on these films and whether they should allow them just because they are profitable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1116677377?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325015908/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1116677377.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 |archivedate=2008-03-25 |work=Variety |first=Jon |last=Herskovitz |title=Murder keys Japan vid crackdown |date=1997-07-06 |accessdate=2012-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the [[Diet of Japan|Diet]] lowered the age for criminal responsibility from 16 to 14. However, in the wake of the June 1, 2004 murder of Satomi Mitarai by 11-year-old "Girl A" ([[Sasebo slashing]]), there has been some discussion for the need for further revision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.coav.org.br/publique/cgi/cgilua.exe/sys/start.htm?infoid=834&amp;tpl=printerview&amp;sid=107| date=June 21, 2004| publisher=Publique!| title=Violent crime prompts debate over age of legal responsibility in Japan| first=Nicholas| last=Watson| accessdate=2007-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 11, 2004, in an unprecedented act, the [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|Japanese Ministry of Justice]] announced that Sakakibara, 21 at the time, was being released on a provisional basis, with a full release to follow on January 1, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kobe killer set free |date=2004-03-11 |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20040311a1.html |work=The Japan Times |accessdate=2011-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have charged that since the government had taken the unusual step of notifying the public, that Sakakibara was likely not fit for release and should be transferred to prison. In the wake of the [[Sasebo slashing]], three months later, this criticism was exacerbated.

Due to the seriousness of the crimes and the fact that they had been committed by a minor, his name and new residence to this day remain a highly-guarded secret. Yet, his real name has been circulated on the Internet since June 29, 1997, according to journalist Fumihiko Takayama.

A number of people, including Shōjirō Gotō (a lawyer who dealt with many false accusation cases), Hidehiko Kumagai{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} and Nobuyoshi Iwata (former principal of the junior high school that Boy A attended), insist that Boy A was wrongfully accused and point out contradictions in the statements of the investigating authorities, for example:
* Police investigators said that one of the murders was made by a left-handed person: Boy A is right-handed.
* Boy A's confession contained many absurd statements and claims of things that would be impossible for a 14-year-old to do.
* Boy A had bad grades, and yet his confession was complex (if cryptic) and contained many elaborate figures of speech and similes.

In 2002, the boy's mother visited him in prison and asked him if he had really committed the crimes.  He affirmed this to her.&lt;ref&gt;一橋文哉 『未解決 —封印された五つの捜査報告—』 新潮文庫、2011年11月1日。{{ISBN|978-4-10-142627-3}}. p.378&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, Sakakibara, then aged 32, released an autobiography through [[Ohta Publishing]] called ''Zekka'' (絶歌), in which he expressed remorse for his crimes and recounted the murders in graphic detail.&lt;ref&gt;[https://japantoday.com/category/crime/controversial-autobiography-of-1997-kobe-child-killer-released Controversial autobiography of 1997 Kobe child killer released], ''Japan Today'', 06-15-15 (Retrieved 3-14-18)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite attempts by Jun Hase's family to block the release of ''Zekka'', and despite one bookstore chain refusing to stock the book, it quickly reached the top of Japanese bestseller lists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/07/01/national/crime-legal/child-serial-killers-memoir-hot-seller-hot-potato/ Child serial killer’s memoir a hot seller, hot potato], ''The Japan Times'', 07-01-15 (Retrieved 03-14-18)&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, Sakakibara set up a vanity website in which he posted bizarre [[photoshop]]ped images of a nude male, suggested to be himself.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gizmodo.com/japans-notorious-boy-a-killer-now-has-a-creepy-vanity-1730106666 Japan's Notorious "Boy A" Killer Now Has a Creepy Vanity Website], Cheryl Eddy, Gizmodo.com, 09-11-15 (Retrieved 03-14-18)&lt;/ref&gt; In response to these controversies, the tabloid ''Shūkan Post'' publicized Sakakibara's real name and location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/east-asia/article/1858474/japanese-tabloid-defies-privacy-laws-expose-identity-man-who Japanese tabloid defies privacy laws to expose identity of man who carried out the 'Kobe child murders' at age 14], ''South China Morning Post'', 09-15-15 (Retrieved 03-14-18)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lawrence Joseph Bader''' (December 2, 1926 – September 16, 1966), also known as '''John''' "'''Fritz'''" '''Johnson''', was a cookware salesman from [[Akron, Ohio]], who disappeared on a fishing trip on [[Lake Erie]] on March 15, 1957. Declared dead in 1960, Bader was found alive five years later, as John "Fritz" Johnson, a  local TV personality living in [[Omaha, Nebraska]].&lt;ref name=Dispatch&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1734&amp;dat=19650210&amp;id=C00fAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bFEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6932,2562925&amp;hl=en The Strange Case of John Fritz Johnson] ''[http://m.the-dispatch.com The Dispatch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905054123/http://m.the-dispatch.com/ |date=2015-09-05 }}'', February 15, 1965, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Life&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=KkEEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=&amp;quot;Lawrence+Joseph+Bader&amp;quot; The Man With Two Wives- Amnesia or Hoax?] ''Life'', March 5, 1965, pp. 41-46.&lt;/ref&gt; The incident is described by author [[Jay Robert Nash]] as "... one of the most baffling amnesia disappearances on record, a weird story forever unanswered."&lt;ref name= Among&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=8NybAAAACAAJ ''Among the Missing: An Anecdotal History of Missing Persons from 1800 to the Present''] [[Jay Robert Nash]] Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1978, pp. 56–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==
On March 15, 1957, Larry Bader, a cookware salesman for the [[Reynolds Metals Corporation]] from [[Akron, Ohio]], rented a {{convert|14|ft}} boat, kissed his wife Mary Lou goodbye, and went to [[Lake Erie]] to go fishing. His boat was found the next day, after a storm. The boat had minor damage and a missing oar. Bader, who was $20,000 in debt and in trouble with the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]], was never found. The couple had three children, with another on the way.&lt;ref name=Among/&gt;

=="Fritz" Johnson==
Four days later, John "Fritz" Johnson made his first known appearance at Roundtable Bar in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. Johnson immediately attracted attention by sitting on a flagpole for 30 days to raise money for polio. His popularity led to his becoming a bartender, radio announcer, and TV sports director at [[KETV|KETV-7]].&lt;ref name=Life/&gt; With his flamboyant personality, he became one of Omaha's most popular personalities.&lt;ref name=Dispatch/&gt;

Johnson lived an equally colorful bachelor lifestyle, driving a hearse equipped with pillows, a bar, and an incense burner, aptly naming it his "hunting vehicle". In 1961 Johnson married Nancy Zimmer, a 20-year-old divorcee, and adopted her daughter. Later they had a son together.&lt;ref name= Dispatch/&gt;

In 1964, it was discovered that Johnson had a cancerous tumor behind his left eye. He lost the eye and wore an eye patch, adding to his flamboyance.&lt;ref name=Among/&gt;

==Reappearance==
On February 2, 1965, Johnson, who like Bader was an archery enthusiast, attended a tournament in [[Chicago]]. An acquaintance from Akron saw him and, despite the eye patch and mustache, recognized Bader. He then brought Bader's 21-year-old niece, Suzanne Peika, to have a look. Convinced, she asked him, "Pardon me, but aren't you my Uncle Larry Bader, who disappeared seven years ago?"&lt;ref name= Life/&gt;

Johnson laughed it off, but Mrs. Peika called in his two brothers from Akron, who had his fingerprints compared with Bader's military records. They matched. Johnson was now faced with the fact that all his memories were false and that he had two wives.&lt;ref name= Life/&gt;

{{quote|It was like a physical shock. Up until that moment, I had no doubt that I was ''not'' Larry Bader. But when I heard that, it was like a door had been slammed and somebody had hit me right in the face.&lt;ref name= Life/&gt;|author="Fritz" Johnson}}

==Man with two wives==
Bader's reappearance caused many problems for Mary Lou, his first wife. She had been receiving $254 monthly from Social Security. She also received $39,500 from Bader's life insurance that would have to be paid back. Also, Mary Lou had been dating since her husband's "death", and had recently accepted a marriage proposal. With the marriage reinstated, her new marriage was impossible, since she was Catholic.&lt;ref name= Life/&gt; Since Bader's reappearance, his marriage to Nancy was regarded as legally null and void. However, she claimed she would stick by him.&lt;ref name=Life/&gt;

==Analysis==
A team of psychiatrists examined Bader for ten days. Their conclusion was that Johnson had no recollection of his former life. There was evidence in his past that he might have wanted to "start again". He was from a well-to-do family and never needed money. Later on, he tried various [[get-rich-quick scheme]]s that failed. He flunked his first semester at the [[University of Akron]] because he concentrated more on his hamburger stand than his studies. As an adult, he barely made enough money to maintain the lifestyle he was used to, and got into trouble with the IRS, trying to save money by not paying taxes.&lt;ref name= Life/&gt;

According to psychologists, cases of amnesia lasting several years, in which the person filled the missing time with false memories, are rare but not unheard of.&lt;ref name= Life/&gt; Another theory was that the tumor may have been responsible for Bader's apparent memory loss. This was never determined.&lt;ref name= Ohio&gt;[http://www.ohio.com/news/local-history-tv-personality-a-dead-ringer-for-missing-akron-man-1.306923 Local history: TV personality a dead ringer for missing Akron man.] Ohio.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
The malignant tumor that cost Bader his eye eventually resurfaced. Bader/Johnson died on September 16, 1966, at St. Joseph's Medical Hospital in Omaha. His death meant that the question of whether he was an amnesiac or a hoaxer was never resolved.&lt;ref name=Among/&gt;

[[File:Jesse orosco.jpg|thumb| [[Jesse Orosco]], who became a left handed specialist later in his career, pitched until the age of 46.]]
In [[baseball]], a '''left-handed specialist''' (also known as '''lefty specialist''') is a [[relief pitcher]] who throws [[left-handed]] and specializes in pitching to left-handed [[Batter (baseball)|batters]], weak right-handed batters, and [[switch-hitter]]s who bat poorly right-handed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fireman: The Evolution of the Closer in Baseball|first=Fran|last=Zimniuch|page=168|publisher=[[Triumph Books]]|location=Chicago|year=2010|isbn=978-1-60078-312-8|ref=zimniuch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because baseball practices [[Baseball rules#Substitutions|permanent substitution]], these pitchers frequently pitch to a very small number of batters in any given game (often only one), and rarely pitch to strictly right-handed batters. Most [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) teams have several left-handed pitchers on their rosters, at least one of whom is a left-handed specialist. A left-handed specialist is sometimes called a ''LOOGY'' (or '''L'''efty '''O'''ne-'''O'''ut '''G'''u'''Y'''), coined by [[John Sickels]], and may be used pejoratively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=8840|title=Checking the Numbers|publisher=Baseball Prospectus|accessdate=March 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/glossary/index.php?search=loogy|title=Glossary|publisher=Baseball Prospectus|accessdate=February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pitcher generally has an advantage when his [[handedness]] is the same as the batter's, and the batter has an advantage when they are opposite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/the-advantage-of-batting-left-handed/|title=The advantage of batting left-handed|publisher=Hardballtimes.com|accessdate=February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because a right-handed pitcher's [[curveball]] breaks to the left, from his own point of view, which causes it to cross the plate with its lateral movement away from a right-handed batter but towards a left-handed batter (and vice versa for a left-handed pitcher), and because batters generally find it easier to hit a ball that is over the plate. Furthermore, since most pitchers are [[right-handed]], left-handed batters generally have less experience with left-handed pitchers. A left-handed pitcher may also be brought in to face a [[switch-hitter]] who generally bats left-handed, forcing the batter to shift to his less-effective right-handed stance or to take the disadvantages of batting left-handed against a left-handed pitcher. Research from 2011-2013 has shown that a [[pinch hitter]] (usually right-handed) is often used when a left-handed reliever is inserted in the game, thereby reducing or negating the pitcher's [[platoon split]] advantage. Only a handful of left-handed relievers face a higher percentage of left-handed batters than right-handed batters over the course of a season.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/blog/sweetspot/post/_/id/43004/how-often-do-loogys-get-matchup-edge&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1991 MLB season, there were 28 left-handed relievers who were not their team's [[closer (baseball)|closer]] and pitched 45 or more games. Only four averaged fewer than an inning per appearance. From 2001 to 2004, over 75 percent of left handed relievers meeting those criteria averaged less than one inning. Left-handed reliever [[John Candelaria]] was one of the early specialists in 1991, pitching 59 games and averaged .571 innings. In 1992, he allowed no earned runs—excluding inherited runners—in 43 of the 50 games. [[Jesse Orosco]] became a left-handed specialist later in his 24-season career and retired at the age of 46. From 1991 to 2003, he never averaged more than an inning pitched per appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Darby|first=William|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ch11RiQRj5sC&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=%22left-handed%20specialist%22%20jesse%20orosco&amp;pg=PA32#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Deconstructing Major League Baseball, 1991–2004: how statistics illuminate individual and team performances|publisher=McFarland|year=2006|pages=23–32|isbn=978-0-7864-2537-2|accessdate=February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2013 MLB season, there were seven relief pitchers who averaged less than two outs recorded per appearance, all of whom were left-handed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2013-reliever-pitching.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Joe Thatcher]], a left-handed specialist, appeared in 72 games with 39.2 innings pitched, and had the fewest outs recorded per appearance with 1.6.&lt;ref&gt;http://arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130803&amp;content_id=55778040&amp;vkey=news_ari&amp;c_id=ari&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.azcentral.com/sports/diamondbacks/articles/20130807arizona-diamondbacks-lefty-reliever-joe-thatcher-finds-hes-right-at-home-with-new-team.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://indianasportsjournal.com/2013/07/31/kokomos-joe-thatcher-traded-from-san-diego-padres-to-arizona-diamondbacks/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130803&amp;content_id=55777012&amp;notebook_id=55778040&amp;vkey=notebook_ari&amp;c_id=ari&lt;/ref&gt;

==Right-handed specialist==
The right-handed specialist (sometimes called a ''ROOGY'', for '''R'''ighty '''O'''ne-'''O'''ut '''G'''u'''Y''') is less common than the left-handed specialist, but are occasionally featured.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phuturephillies.com/prospectprimer/scouting-lingo/ Scouting Lingo | Phuture Phillies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metstoday.com/11/spring-training-2006/the-loogy/ The LOOGY&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mandelbrot set''' is the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[complex number]]s &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; for which the function &lt;math&gt;f_c(z)=z^2+c&lt;/math&gt; does not [[diverge (stability theory)|diverge]] when [[Iteration|iterated]] from &lt;math&gt;z=0&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., for which the sequence &lt;math&gt;f_c(0)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f_c(f_c(0))&lt;/math&gt;, etc., remains bounded in absolute value.
[[File:Mandelbrot sequence new.gif|thumb|Zooming into the Mandelbrot set]]
 
Its definition and name are due to [[Adrien Douady]], in tribute to the [[mathematician]] [[Benoit Mandelbrot]].&lt;ref name="John H. Hubbard 1985"&gt;Adrien Douady and John H. Hubbard, ''Etude dynamique des polynômes complexes'', Prépublications mathémathiques d'Orsay 2/4 (1984 / 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; The set is connected to a [[Julia set]], and related Julia sets produce similarly complex [[fractal]] shapes. 

Mandelbrot set images may be created by sampling the complex numbers and testing, for each sample point &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, whether the sequence &lt;math&gt;f_c(0), f_c(f_c(0)),\dotsc&lt;/math&gt; [[Sequence#Bounded|goes to infinity]] (in practice -- whether it leaves some predetermined bounded neighborhood of 0 after a predetermined number of iterations). Treating the [[Real numbers|real]] and [[Imaginary number|imaginary part]]s of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; as [[image coordinate]]s on the [[complex plane]], pixels may then be coloured according to how soon the sequence &lt;math&gt;|f_c(0)|, |f_c(f_c(0))|,\dotsc&lt;/math&gt; crosses an arbitrarily chosen threshold, with a special color (usually black) used for the values of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; for which the sequence has not crossed the threshold after the predetermined number of iterations (this is necessary to clearly distinguish the Mandelbrot set image from the image of its complement). If &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is held constant and the initial value of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;—denoted by &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt;—is variable instead, one obtains the [[Julia set#Quadratic polynomials|corresponding Julia set]] for each point &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; in the [[parameter space]] of the simple function. 

Images of the Mandelbrot set exhibit an elaborate and infinitely complicated [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] that reveals progressively ever-finer [[Recursion|recursive]] detail at increasing magnifications. The "style" of this repeating detail depends on the region of the set being examined. The set's boundary also incorporates smaller versions of the main shape, so the [[fractal]] property of [[self-similarity]] applies to the entire set, and not just to its parts.

The Mandelbrot set has become popular outside [[mathematics]] both for its aesthetic appeal and as an example of a complex structure arising from the application of simple rules. It is one of the best-known examples of [[mathematical visualization]] and [[mathematical beauty]].

==History==
[[File:Mandel.png|322px|right|thumb|The first published picture of the Mandelbrot set, by [[Robert W. Brooks]] and Peter Matelski in 1978]]
The Mandelbrot set has its place in [[complex dynamics]], a field first investigated by the [[French mathematicians]] [[Pierre Fatou]] and [[Gaston Julia]] at the beginning of the 20th century. This fractal was first defined and drawn in 1978 by [[Robert W. Brooks]] and Peter Matelski as part of a study of [[Kleinian group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Brooks and Peter Matelski, ''The dynamics of 2-generator subgroups of PSL(2,C)'', in {{cite book|author=Irwin Kra|editor=Irwin Kra|others=[[Bernard Maskit]]|title=Riemann Surfaces and Related Topics: Proceedings of the 1978 Stony Brook Conference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eTzSSu0LH7kC&amp;pg=65--71|date=1 May 1981|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-08267-7|pages=65–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 March 1980, at [[IBM]]'s [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center]] in [[Yorktown Heights, New York|Yorktown Heights]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] first saw a visualization of the set.&lt;ref name="bf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pubs/paper311.pdf |title=Biophilic Fractals and the Visual Journey of Organic Screen-savers |author=R.P. Taylor &amp; J.C. Sprott |accessdate=1 January 2009 |format=pdf |year=2008 |work=Nonlinear Dynamics, Psychology, and Life Sciences, Vol. 12, No. 1 |publisher=Society for Chaos Theory in Psychology &amp; Life Sciences }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandelbrot studied the [[parameter space]] of [[quadratic polynomial]]s in an article that appeared in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Benoit Mandelbrot, ''Fractal aspects of the iteration of &lt;math&gt;z\mapsto\lambda z(1-z)&lt;/math&gt; for complex &lt;math&gt;\lambda, z&lt;/math&gt;'', ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'' '''357''', 249/259&lt;/ref&gt; The mathematical study of the Mandelbrot set really began with work by the mathematicians [[Adrien Douady]] and [[John H. Hubbard]],&lt;ref name="John H. Hubbard 1985"/&gt; who established many of its fundamental properties and named the set in honor of Mandelbrot for his influential work in [[fractal geometry]].

The mathematicians [[Heinz-Otto Peitgen]] and [[Peter Richter]] became well known for promoting the set with photographs, books,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Beauty of Fractals]] |last=Peitgen |first=Heinz-Otto |authorlink= |author2=Richter Peter |year=1986 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=Heidelberg |isbn=0-387-15851-0 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an internationally touring exhibit of the German [[Goethe-Institut]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Frontiers of Chaos]], Exhibition of the Goethe-Institut by H.O. Peitgen, P. Richter, H. Jürgens, M. Prüfer, D.Saupe. since 1985 shown in over 40 countries.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Chaos: Making a New Science]] |last=Gleick |first=James |authorlink= |year=1987 |publisher=Cardinal |location=London |isbn= |pages=229 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of Douady and Hubbard coincided with a huge increase in interest in complex dynamics and [[abstract mathematics]], and the study of the Mandelbrot set has been a centerpiece of this field ever since.

==Formal definition==
The Mandelbrot set is the set of values of ''c'' in the [[complex plane]] for which the [[Orbit (dynamics)|orbit]] of 0 under [[Iterated function|iteration]] of the [[quadratic map]]

:&lt;math&gt;z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c&lt;/math&gt;

remains [[Bounded sequence|bounded]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://math.bu.edu/DYSYS/explorer/def.html|title=Mandelbrot Set Explorer: Mathematical Glossary|accessdate=2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, a complex number ''c'' is part of the Mandelbrot set if, when starting with ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 and applying the iteration repeatedly, the [[absolute value]] of ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; remains bounded however large ''n'' gets. This can also be represented as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mrob.com/pub/muency/escaperadius.html|title=Escape Radius, Mu-Ency at MROB|accessdate=2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c \in M \iff \limsup_{n \to \infty}|z_{n+1}| \leq 2.&lt;/math&gt;
 
For example, letting ''c'' = 1 gives the sequence 0, 1, 2, 5, 26, ..., which tends to [[infinity]]. As this sequence is unbounded, 1 is not an element of the Mandelbrot set. On the other hand, ''c'' = −1 gives the sequence 0, −1, 0, −1, 0, ..., which is bounded, and so −1 belongs to the Mandelbrot set.

The Mandelbrot set &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is defined by a family of [[complex quadratic polynomial]]s

:&lt;math&gt;P_c:\mathbb C\to\mathbb C&lt;/math&gt;

given by

:&lt;math&gt;P_c: z\mapsto z^2 + c,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a complex parameter. For each &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, one considers the behavior of the [[sequence]]
:&lt;math&gt;(0, P_c(0), P_c(P_c(0)), P_c(P_c(P_c(0))), \ldots)&lt;/math&gt;

obtained by [[iterated function|iterating]] &lt;math&gt;P_c(z)&lt;/math&gt; starting at [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]] &lt;math&gt;z = 0&lt;/math&gt;, which either escapes to infinity or stays within a [[Disk (mathematics)|disk]] of some finite [[radius]]. The Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of all points &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; such that the above sequence does ''not'' escape to infinity.

[[File:Mandelset hires.png|right|thumb|322px|A mathematician's depiction of the Mandelbrot set ''M''. A point ''c'' is colored black if it belongs to the set, and white if not. Re[c] and Im[c] denote the real and imaginary parts of ''c'', respectively.]]
More formally, if &lt;math&gt;P_c^n(z)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the ''n''th iterate of &lt;math&gt;P_c(z)&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt;P_c(z)&lt;/math&gt; [[function composition|composed]] with itself ''n'' times), the Mandelbrot set is the [[subset]] of the [[complex plane]] given by

:&lt;math&gt;M = \left\{c\in \mathbb C : \exists s\in \mathbb R^+, \forall n\in \mathbb N, |P_c^n(0)| \le s \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

As explained below, it is in fact possible to simplify this definition by taking &lt;math&gt;s=2&lt;/math&gt;.

Mathematically, the Mandelbrot set is just a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of complex numbers. A given complex number ''c'' either belongs to ''M'' or it does not. A picture of the Mandelbrot set can be made by coloring all the points &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; that belong to ''M'' black, and all other points white. The more colorful pictures usually seen are generated by coloring points not in the set according to which term in the sequence &lt;math&gt;|P_c^n(0)|&lt;/math&gt; is the first term with an absolute value greater than a certain cutoff value, usually 2. The list of colors used are always predefined by the program used or created by the user, the next color in the list is chosen when the iteration count rises. See the section on [[#Computer drawings|computer drawings]] below for more details.

The Mandelbrot set can also be defined as the [[connectedness locus]] of the family of [[Polynomial|polynomials]] &lt;math&gt;P_c(z)&lt;/math&gt;. That is, it is the subset of the complex plane consisting of those parameters &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; for which the [[Julia set]] of &lt;math&gt;P_c&lt;/math&gt; is [[connected space|connected]].

&lt;math&gt;P_c^n(0)&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial in c and its leading terms settle down as n grows large enough. These terms are given by the [[Catalan numbers]]. The polynomials &lt;math&gt;P_c^n(0)&lt;/math&gt; are bounded by the [[generating function]] for the Catalan numbers and tend to it as n goes to infinity.

==Basic properties==
The Mandelbrot set is a [[compact set]], since it is [[closed set|closed]] and contained in the [[closed disk]] of radius 2 around the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]]. More specifically, a point &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; belongs to the Mandelbrot set if and only if
:&lt;math&gt;|P_c^n(0)|\leq 2&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n\geq 0.&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, if the [[absolute value]] of &lt;math&gt;P_c^n(0)&lt;/math&gt; ever becomes larger than 2, the sequence will escape to infinity in a short amount of time.

[[File:Verhulst-Mandelbrot-Bifurcation.jpg|thumb|Correspondence between the Mandelbrot set and the [[bifurcation diagram]] of the [[logistic map]]]]
The [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; with the real axis is precisely the interval [−2, 1/4]. The parameters along this interval can be put in one-to-one correspondence with those of the real [[logistic map|logistic family]],
:&lt;math&gt;z\mapsto \lambda z(1-z),\quad \lambda\in[1,4].&lt;/math&gt;
The correspondence is given by

:&lt;math&gt;c = \frac\lambda2\left(1-\frac\lambda2\right).&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, this gives a correspondence between the entire [[parameter space]] of the logistic family and that of the Mandelbrot set.

Douady and Hubbard have shown that the Mandelbrot set is [[connected space|connected]]. In fact, they constructed an explicit [[holomorphic function|conformal isomorphism]] between the complement of the Mandelbrot set and the complement of the [[closed unit disk]]. Mandelbrot had originally conjectured that the Mandelbrot set is [[Disconnected (topology)|disconnected]]. This conjecture was based on computer pictures generated by programs that are unable to detect the thin filaments connecting different parts of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. Upon further experiments, he revised his conjecture, deciding that &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; should be connected. There also exists a [[Topology|topological]] proof to the connectedness that was discovered in 2001 by Jeremy Kahn&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.math.brown.edu/~kahn/mconn.pdf|title=The Mandelbrot Set is Connected: a Topological Proof|last=Kahn|first=Jeremy|date=8 August 2001|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
[[File:Wakes near the period 1 continent in the Mandelbrot set.png|thumbnail|right|External rays of wakes near the period 1 continent in the Mandelbrot set]]
The dynamical formula for the [[uniformization theorem|uniformisation]] of the complement of the Mandelbrot set, arising from Douady and Hubbard's proof of the connectedness of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, gives rise to [[external ray]]s of the Mandelbrot set. These rays can be used to study the Mandelbrot set in combinatorial terms and form the backbone of the Yoccoz parapuzzle.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mandelbrot set, theme and variations''. Tan, Lei. Cambridge University Press, 2000. {{isbn|978-0-521-77476-5}}. Section 2.1, "Yoccoz para-puzzles", [https://books.google.com/books?id=-a_DsYXquVkC&amp;pg=PA121 p.&amp;nbsp;121]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of the Mandelbrot set is exactly the [[bifurcation locus]] of the quadratic family; that is, the set of parameters &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; for which the dynamics changes abruptly under small changes of &lt;math&gt;c.&lt;/math&gt; It can be constructed as the limit set of a sequence of [[algebraic curves|plane algebraic curves]], the ''Mandelbrot curves'', of the general type known as [[polynomial lemniscate]]s. The Mandelbrot curves are defined by setting ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''z'', ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''z'', and then interpreting the set of points |''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'')| = 2 in the complex plane as a curve in the real [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian plane]] of degree 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; in ''x'' and ''y''.  These algebraic curves appear in images of the Mandelbrot set computed using the "escape time algorithm" mentioned below.

==Other properties==

===Main cardioid and period bulbs===
&lt;!--[[Douady rabbit]] links directly here.--&gt;
[[File:Mandelbrot Set – Periodicities coloured.png|right|thumb|Periods of hyperbolic components]]

Upon looking at a picture of the Mandelbrot set, one immediately notices the large [[cardioid]]-shaped region in the center. This ''main cardioid''
is the region of parameters &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;P_c&lt;/math&gt; has an [[Periodic points of complex quadratic mappings|attracting fixed point]]. It consists of all parameters of the form
:&lt;math&gt; c = \frac\mu2\left(1-\frac\mu2\right)&lt;/math&gt;
for some &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; in the [[open unit disk]].

To the left of the main cardioid, attached to it at the point &lt;math&gt;c=-3/4&lt;/math&gt;, a circular-shaped '''bulb''' is visible. This bulb consists of those parameters &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;P_c&lt;/math&gt; has an [[Periodic points of complex quadratic mappings|attracting cycle of period 2]]. This set of parameters is an actual circle, namely that of radius 1/4 around −1.

There are infinitely many other bulbs tangent to the main cardioid: for every rational number &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{p}{q}&lt;/math&gt;, with ''p'' and ''q'' [[coprime]], there is such a bulb that is tangent at the parameter

:&lt;math&gt; c_{\frac{p}{q}} = \frac{e^{2\pi i\frac pq}}2\left(1-\frac{e^{2\pi i\frac pq}}2\right).&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Animated cycle.gif|left|thumb|200px|Attracting cycle in 2/5-bulb plotted over [[Julia set]] (animation)]]This bulb is called the ''&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{p}{q}&lt;/math&gt;-bulb'' of the Mandelbrot set. It consists of parameters that have an attracting cycle of period &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; and combinatorial rotation number &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{p}{q}&lt;/math&gt;. More precisely, the &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; periodic [[Classification of Fatou components|Fatou components]] containing the attracting cycle all touch at a common point (commonly called the ''&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-fixed point''). If we label these components &lt;math&gt;U_0,\dots,U_{q-1}&lt;/math&gt; in counterclockwise orientation, then &lt;math&gt;P_c&lt;/math&gt; maps the component &lt;math&gt;U_j&lt;/math&gt; to the component &lt;math&gt;U_{j+p\,(\operatorname{mod} q)}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Juliacycles1.png|right|thumb|300px|Attracting cycles and [[Julia set]]s for parameters in the 1/2, 3/7, 2/5, 1/3, 1/4, and 1/5 bulbs]]

[[File:Mandel rays.jpg|thumb|right|425px|Cycle periods and antennae]]

The change of behavior occurring at &lt;math&gt;c_{\frac{p}{q}}&lt;/math&gt; is known as a [[bifurcation theory|bifurcation]]: the attracting fixed point "collides" with a repelling period ''q''-cycle. As we pass through the bifurcation parameter into the &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{p}{q}&lt;/math&gt;-bulb, the attracting fixed point turns into a repelling fixed point (the &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-fixed point), and the period ''q''-cycle becomes attracting.

{{clear|left}}
===Hyperbolic components===
All the bulbs we encountered in the previous section were interior components of
the Mandelbrot set in which the maps &lt;math&gt;P_c&lt;/math&gt; have an attracting periodic cycle. Such components are called ''hyperbolic components''.

It is conjectured that these are the ''only'' interior regions of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. This problem, known as ''density of hyperbolicity'', may be the most important open problem in the field of complex dynamics. Hypothetical non-hyperbolic components of the Mandelbrot set are often referred to as "queer" or ghost components.&lt;ref&gt;''Exploring the Mandelbrot set. The Orsay Notes'' by Adrien Douady and John H. Hubbard. page 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolf Jung, March 2002, [http://www.mndynamics.com/papers/thesis.pdf Homeomorphisms on Edges of the Mandelbrot Set by Wolf Jung]&lt;/ref&gt;
For ''real'' quadratic polynomials, this question was answered positively in the 1990s independently by Lyubich and by Graczyk and Świątek. (Note that hyperbolic components intersecting the real axis correspond exactly to periodic windows in the [[Bifurcation diagram|Feigenbaum diagram]]. So this result states that such windows exist near every parameter in the diagram.)

Not every hyperbolic component can be reached by a sequence of direct bifurcations from the main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set. However, such a component ''can'' be reached by a sequence of direct bifurcations from the main cardioid of a little Mandelbrot copy (see below).

Each of the hyperbolic components has a ''center'', which is a point ''c'' such that the inner Fatou domain for &lt;math&gt;P_c(z)&lt;/math&gt; has a super-attracting cycle – that is, that the attraction is infinite (see the image [[:commons:File:Centers8.png|here]]). This means that the cycle contains the critical point 0, so that 0 is iterated back to itself after some iterations. We therefore have that &lt;math&gt;P_c&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;math&gt;(0) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for some ''n''. If we call this polynomial &lt;math&gt;Q^{n}(c)&lt;/math&gt; (letting it depend on ''c'' instead of ''z''), we have that &lt;math&gt;Q^{n+1}(c) = Q^{n}(c)^{2} + c&lt;/math&gt; and that the degree of &lt;math&gt;Q^{n}(c)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;2^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;. We can therefore construct the centers of the hyperbolic components by successively solving the equations &lt;math&gt;Q^{n}(c) = 0, n = 1, 2, 3, ...&lt;/math&gt;. The number of new centers produced in each step is given by Sloane's {{oeis|A000740}}.

===Local connectivity===
[[File:Cactus model of Mandelbrot set.svg|right|thumb|Topological model of Mandelbrot set without mini Mandelbrot sets and Misiurewicz points (Cactus model)]]
[[File:Lavaurs-12.png|right|thumb|Thurston model of Mandelbrot set (abstract Mandelbrot set)]]

It is conjectured that the Mandelbrot set is [[locally connected]]. This famous conjecture is known as ''MLC'' (for ''Mandelbrot locally connected''). By the work of [[Adrien Douady]] and [[John H. Hubbard]], this conjecture would result in a simple abstract "pinched disk" model of the Mandelbrot set. In particular, it would imply the important ''hyperbolicity conjecture'' mentioned above.

The work of [[Jean-Christophe Yoccoz]] established local connectivity of the Mandelbrot set at all finitely [[Renormalization|renormalizable]] parameters; that is, roughly speaking those contained only in finitely many small Mandelbrot copies.&lt;ref name="yoccoz"&gt;{{citation

===Self-similarity===

[[File:Blue Mandelbrot Zoom.jpg|left|thumb|340px|Quasi-self-similarity in the Mandelbrot set]]The Mandelbrot set in general is not strictly self-similar but it is quasi-self-similar, as small slightly different versions of itself can be found at arbitrarily small scales.

The little copies of the Mandelbrot set are all slightly different, mostly because of the thin threads connecting them to the main body of the set.

===Further results===
The [[Hausdorff dimension]] of the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of the Mandelbrot set equals 2 as determined by a result of [[Mitsuhiro Shishikura]].&lt;ref name="shishikura"/&gt; It is not known whether the boundary of the Mandelbrot set has positive planar [[Lebesgue measure]].

In the [[Blum-Shub-Smale]] model of [[real computation]], the Mandelbrot set is not computable, but its complement is [[Recursively enumerable set|computably enumerable]]. However, many simple objects (''e.g.'', the graph of exponentiation) are also not computable in the BSS model. At present, it is unknown whether the Mandelbrot set is computable in models of real computation based on [[computable analysis]], which correspond more closely to the intuitive notion of "plotting the set by a computer". Hertling has shown that the Mandelbrot set is computable in this model if the hyperbolicity conjecture is true.[[File:Relationship between Mandelbrot sets and Julia sets.PNG|3220x|left|thumb|A zoom into the Mandelbrot set illustrating a Julia "island" and a similar Julia set.]]

===Relationship with Julia sets===
As a consequence of the definition of the Mandelbrot set, there is a close correspondence between the geometry of the Mandelbrot set at a given point and the structure of the corresponding [[Julia set]]. For instance, a point is in the Mandelbrot set exactly when the corresponding Julia set is connected.

This principle is exploited in virtually all deep results on the Mandelbrot set. For example, Shishikura proved that, for a dense set of parameters in the boundary of the Mandelbrot set, the Julia set has [[Hausdorff dimension]] two, and then transfers this information to the parameter plane.&lt;ref name="shishikura"&gt;{{citation

[[File:Unrolled main cardioid of Mandelbrot set for periods 8-14.png|thumbnail|right|Components on main cardioid for periods 8–14 with antennae 7–13]]

For every rational number &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{p}{q}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''p'' and ''q'' are [[relatively prime]], a hyperbolic component of period ''q'' bifurcates from the main cardioid. The part of the Mandelbrot set connected to the main cardioid at this bifurcation point is called the '''''p''/''q''-limb'''. Computer experiments suggest that the [[diameter]] of the limb tends to zero like &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{q^2}&lt;/math&gt;. The best current estimate known is the ''[[Jean-Christophe Yoccoz|Yoccoz-inequality]]'', which states that the size tends to zero like &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{q}&lt;/math&gt;.

A period-''q'' limb will have ''q''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 "antennae" at the top of its limb. We can thus determine the period of a given bulb by counting these antennas.

=== Pi in the Mandelbrot set ===
In an attempt to demonstrate that the thickness of the ''p''/''q''-limb is zero, David Boll carried out a computer experiment in 1991, where he computed the number of iterations required for the series to diverge for z = &lt;math&gt;-\tfrac{3}{4} + i\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;-\tfrac{3}{4}&lt;/math&gt; being the location thereof). As the series doesn't diverge for the exact value of z = &lt;math&gt;-\tfrac{3}{4}&lt;/math&gt;, the number of iterations required increases with a small ε. It turns out that multiplying the value of ε with the number of iterations required yields an approximation of π that becomes better for smaller ε. For example, for ε = 0.0000001 the number of iterations is 31415928 and the product is 3.1415928.&lt;ref&gt;Gary William Flake, ''The Computational Beauty of Nature'', 1998. p.&amp;nbsp;125. {{isbn|978-0-262-56127-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fibonacci sequence in the Mandelbrot set ===
The [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]] is a sequence such that every number in the sequence is the sum of the two previous numbers and can be found in the Mandelbrot Set. Starting with the period one cardioid and the period two bulb, the sequence of bulb periods where each successive bulb is the largest bulb attached to the cardioid between the previous two bulbs follows the Fibonacci sequence. For instance, the period three bulb is the next largest bulb after the period two bulb, the period five bulb is the largest between the period two and period three bulbs, and the period eight bulb is the largest between the period three and period five bulbs. These correspond with the numbers of the Fibonacci sequence beginning with 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on.

===Image gallery of a zoom sequence===
The Mandelbrot set shows more intricate detail the closer one looks or [[magnification|magnifies]] the image, usually called "zooming in". The following example of an image sequence zooming to a selected ''c'' value gives an impression of the infinite richness of different geometrical structures and explains some of their typical rules.

The magnification of the last image relative to the first one is about 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; to 1.

The seahorse "body" is composed by 25 "spokes" consisting of two groups of 12 "spokes" each and one "spoke" connecting to the main cardioid. These two groups can be attributed by some kind of metamorphosis to the two "fingers" of the "upper hand" of the Mandelbrot set; therefore, the number of "spokes" increases from one "seahorse" to the next by 2; the "hub" is a so-called [[Misiurewicz point]]. Between the "upper part of the body" and the "tail" a distorted small copy of the Mandelbrot set called satellite may be recognized.

The islands above seem to consist of infinitely many parts like [[Cantor set]]s, as is{{Clarify|date=May 2010}} actually the case for the corresponding Julia set ''J&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''. However, they are connected by tiny structures, so that the whole represents a simply connected set.

[[Multibrot set]]s are bounded sets found in the complex plane for members of the general monic univariate [[polynomial]] family of recursions

:&lt;math&gt; z \mapsto z^d + c.\ &lt;/math&gt;

For an integer d, these sets are connectedness loci for the Julia sets built from the same formula. The full cubic connectedness locus has also been studied; here one considers the two-parameter recursion &lt;math&gt; z \mapsto z^3 + 3kz + c &lt;/math&gt;, whose two [[critical point (mathematics)|critical points]] are the [[complex square root]]s of the parameter ''k''. A parameter is in the cubic connectedness locus if both critical points are stable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rudy Rucker]]'s discussion of the CCM: [http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/faculty/rucker/cubic_mandel.htm CS.sjsu.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; For general families of [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic functions]], the ''boundary'' of the Mandelbrot set generalizes to the [[bifurcation locus]], which is a natural object to study even when the connectedness locus is not useful. is

The [[Multibrot set]] is obtained by varying the value of the exponent ''d''. The [[Multibrot set|article]] has a video that shows the development from ''d'' = 0 to 7, at which point there are 6 i.e. (''d'' − 1) lobes around the perimeter. A similar development with negative exponents results in (1 − ''d'') clefts on the inside of a ring.

Although there is no accepted extension of the set into 3D, the use of [[quaternion]]s allows for an extension into 4 dimensions. &lt;ref&gt;http://archive.bridgesmathart.org/2010/bridges2010-247.pdf retrieved August 19 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Of particular interest is the
[[tricorn (mathematics)|tricorn]] fractal, the connectedness locus of the anti-holomorphic family

The tricorn (also sometimes called the ''Mandelbar set'' [most likely due to the difference between the Tricorn and Mandelbrot set is a Bar over the right hand Z]) was encountered by [[John Milnor|Milnor]] in his study of parameter slices of real [[Cubic function|cubic polynomials]]. It is ''not'' locally connected. This property is inherited by the connectedness locus of real cubic polynomials.

Another non-analytic generalization is the [[Burning Ship fractal]], which is obtained by iterating the following :

There are many programs used to generate the Mandelbrot set and other fractals, some of which are described in [[fractal-generating software]]. These programs use a variety of algorithms to determine the color of individual pixels and achieve efficient computation.

===Escape time algorithm===
&lt;!--[[Spatial anti-aliasing]] links directly here.--&gt;
The simplest algorithm for generating a representation of the Mandelbrot set is known as the "escape time" algorithm. A repeating calculation is performed for each ''x'', ''y'' point in the plot area and based on the behavior of that calculation, a color is chosen for that pixel.

The ''x'' and ''y'' locations of each point are used as starting values in a repeating, or iterating calculation (described in detail below). The result of each iteration is used as the starting values for the next. The values are checked during each iteration to see whether they have reached a critical "escape" condition, or "bailout". If that condition is reached, the calculation is stopped, the pixel is drawn, and the next ''x'', ''y'' point is examined. For some starting values, escape occurs quickly, after only a small number of iterations. For starting values very close to but not in the set, it may take hundreds or thousands of iterations to escape. For values within the Mandelbrot set, escape will never occur. The programmer or user must choose how much iteration, or "depth", they wish to examine. The higher the maximal number of iterations, the more detail and subtlety emerge in the final image, but the longer time it will take to calculate the fractal image.

Escape conditions can be simple or complex. Because no complex number with a real or imaginary part greater than 2 can be part of the set, a common bailout is to escape when either coefficient exceeds 2. A more computationally complex method that detects escapes sooner, is to compute distance from the origin using the [[Pythagorean theorem]], i.e., to determine the [[absolute value]], or ''modulus'', of the complex number. If this value exceeds 2, or equivalently, when the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts exceed 4, the point has reached escape. More computationally intensive rendering variations include the [[Buddhabrot]] method, which finds escaping points and plots their iterated coordinates.

The color of each point represents how quickly the values reached the escape point. Often black is used to show values that fail to escape before the iteration limit, and gradually brighter colors are used for points that escape. This gives a visual representation of how many cycles were required before reaching the escape condition.

To render such an image, the region of the complex plane we are considering is subdivided into a certain number of [[pixel]]s. To color any such pixel, let &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; be the midpoint of that pixel. We now iterate the critical point 0 under &lt;math&gt;P_c&lt;/math&gt;, checking at each step whether the orbit point has modulus larger than 2. When this is the case, we know that &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; does not belong to the Mandelbrot set, and we color our pixel according to the number of iterations used to find out. Otherwise, we keep iterating up to a fixed number of steps, after which we decide that our parameter is "probably" in the Mandelbrot set, or at least very close to it, and color the pixel black.

In [[pseudocode]], this algorithm would look as follows. The algorithm does not use complex numbers and manually simulates complex-number operations using two real numbers, for those who do not have a [[complex data type]]. The program may be simplified if the programming language includes complex-data-type operations.

&lt;!-- NOTE that xtemp is necessary, otherwise y would be calculated with the new x, which would be wrong. Also note that one must plot (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), not (''x'',''y''). --&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;For each pixel (Px, Py) on the screen, do:
{
  x0 = scaled x coordinate of pixel (scaled to lie in the Mandelbrot X scale (-2.5, 1))
  y0 = scaled y coordinate of pixel (scaled to lie in the Mandelbrot Y scale (-1, 1))
  x = 0.0
  y = 0.0
  iteration = 0
  max_iteration = 1000
  while (x*x + y*y &lt; 2*2  AND  iteration &lt; max_iteration) {
    xtemp = x*x - y*y + x0
    y = 2*x*y + y0
    x = xtemp
    iteration = iteration + 1
  }
  color = palette[iteration]
  plot(Px, Py, color)
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
Here, relating the pseudocode to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_c&lt;/math&gt;:
* &lt;math&gt;z = x + iy\ &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;z^2 = x^2 +i2xy - y^2\ &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;c = x_0 + i y_0\ &lt;/math&gt;
and so, as can be seen in the pseudocode in the computation of ''x'' and ''y'':
* &lt;math&gt;x = \mathop{\mathrm{Re}}(z^2+c) = x^2-y^2 + x_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y = \mathop{\mathrm{Im}}(z^2+c) = 2xy + y_0.\ &lt;/math&gt;

To get colorful images of the set, the assignment of a color to each value of the number of executed iterations can be made using one of a variety of functions (linear, exponential, etc.). One practical way, without slowing down calculations, is to use the number of executed iterations as an entry to a [[Lookup table|look-up color palette table]] initialized at startup. If the color table has, for instance, 500 entries, then the color selection is ''n''&amp;nbsp;mod&amp;nbsp;500, where ''n'' is the number of iterations.

====Histogram coloring====
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
A more complex coloring method involves using a [[histogram]], which keeps track of how many pixels reached each iteration number, from 1 to ''n''. This method will equally distribute colors to the same overall area, and, importantly, is independent of the maximal number of iterations chosen.

First, create an array of size ''n''. For each pixel, which took ''i'' iterations, find the ''i''th element and increment it. This creates the histogram during computation of the image. Then, when finished, perform a second "rendering" pass over each pixel, utilizing the completed histogram. If you had a continuous color palette ranging from 0 to 1, you could find the normalized color of each pixel as follows, using the variables from above.
&lt;pre&gt;
total = 0
for (i = 0; i &lt; max_iterations; i += 1) {
  total += histogram[i]
}

hue = 0.0;
for (i = 0; i &lt;= iteration; i += 1) {
  hue += histogram[i] / total // Must be floating-point division.
}

color = palette[hue]
&lt;/pre&gt;

This method may be combined with the smooth coloring method below for more aesthetically pleasing images.

====Continuous (smooth) coloring====
{{multiple image| direction = vertical
| width = 180
| image1 = Escape Time Algorithm bands.png
| caption1 = This image was rendered with the escape time algorithm. There are very obvious "bands" of color
| image2 = Normalized Iteration Count Algorithm 1.png
| caption2 = This image was rendered with the normalized iteration count algorithm. The bands of color have been replaced by a smooth gradient. Also, the colors take on the same pattern that would be observed if the escape time algorithm were used.
}}

The escape time algorithm is popular for its simplicity. However, it creates bands of color, which, as a type of [[aliasing]], can detract from an image's aesthetic value. This can be improved using an algorithm known as "normalized iteration count",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=García|first=Francisco|author2=Ángel Fernández |author3=Javier Barrallo |author4=Luis Martín |title=Coloring Dynamical Systems in the Complex Plane|url=http://math.unipa.it/~grim/Jbarrallo.PDF|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linas.org/art-gallery/escape/escape.html|title=Renormalizing the Mandelbrot Escape|author=Linas Vepstas}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides a smooth transition of colors between iterations. The algorithm associates a real number &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; with each value of ''z'' by using the connection of the iteration number with the [[Julia set|potential function]]. This function is given by

: &lt;math&gt;\phi(z) = \lim_{n \to \infty} (\log|z_n|/P^{n}),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the value after ''n'' iterations and ''P'' is the power for which ''z'' is raised to in the Mandelbrot set equation (''z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''P''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''c'', ''P'' is generally 2).

If we choose a large bailout radius ''N'' (e.g., 10&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt;), we have that

: &lt;math&gt;\log|z_n|/P^{n} = \log(N)/P^{\nu(z)}&lt;/math&gt;

for some real number &lt;math&gt;\nu(z)&lt;/math&gt;, and this is

: &lt;math&gt;\nu(z) = n - \log_P (\log|z_n|/\log(N)),&lt;/math&gt;

and as ''n'' is the first iteration number such that |''z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;| &gt; ''N'', the number we subtract from ''n'' is in the interval &lt;nowiki&gt;[0,&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

For the coloring we must have a cyclic scale of colors (constructed mathematically, for instance) and containing ''H'' colors numbered from 0 to ''H''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 (''H'' =&amp;nbsp;500, for instance). We multiply the real number &lt;math&gt;\nu(z)&lt;/math&gt; by a fixed real number determining the density of the colors in the picture, take the integral part of this number modulo&amp;nbsp;''H'', and use it to look up the corresponding color in the color table.

For example, modifying the above pseudocode and also using the concept of [[linear interpolation]] would yield
&lt;pre&gt;For each pixel (Px, Py) on the screen, do:
{
  x0 = scaled x coordinate of pixel (scaled to lie in the Mandelbrot X scale (-2.5, 1))
  y0 = scaled y coordinate of pixel (scaled to lie in the Mandelbrot Y scale (-1, 1))
  x = 0.0
  y = 0.0
  iteration = 0
  max_iteration = 1000
  // Here N=2^8 is chosen as a reasonable bailout radius.
  while ( x*x + y*y &lt; (1 &lt;&lt; 16)  AND  iteration &lt; max_iteration ) {
    xtemp = x*x - y*y + x0
    y = 2*x*y + y0
    x = xtemp
    iteration = iteration + 1
  }
  // Used to avoid floating point issues with points inside the set.
  if ( iteration &lt; max_iteration ) {
    // sqrt of inner term removed using log simplification rules.
    log_zn = log( x*x + y*y ) / 2
    nu = log( log_zn / log(2) ) / log(2)
    // Rearranging the potential function.
    // Dividing log_zn by log(2) instead of log(N = 1&lt;&lt;8)
    // because we want the entire palette to range from the
    // center to radius 2, NOT our bailout radius.
    iteration = iteration + 1 - nu
  }
  color1 = palette[floor(iteration)]
  color2 = palette[floor(iteration) + 1]
  // iteration % 1 = fractional part of iteration.
  color = linear_interpolate(color1, color2, iteration % 1)
  plot(Px, Py, color)
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Distance estimates===
One can compute the [[distance]] from point ''c'' (in [[exterior (topology)|exterior]] or [[interior (topology)|interior]]) to nearest point on the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of the Mandelbrot set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.moleculardensity.net/buddhabrot/appendix/2 | title=Interior and exterior distance bounds for the Mandelbrot | author=Albert Lobo Cusidó}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Exterior distance estimation====
The proof of the [[Mandelbrot set#Basic properties|connectedness]] of the Mandelbrot set in fact gives a formula for the [[Uniform isomorphism|uniformizing map]] of the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; (and the [[derivative]] of this map). By the [[Koebe quarter theorem]], one can then estimate the distance between the midpoint of our [[pixel]] and the Mandelbrot set up to a factor of 4.

In other words, provided that the maximal number of iterations is sufficiently high, one obtains a picture of the Mandelbrot set with the following properties:

# Every pixel that contains a point of the Mandelbrot set is colored black.
# Every pixel that is colored black is close to the Mandelbrot set.

[[File:Demm 2000 Mandelbrot set.jpg|thumb|Exterior distance estimate may be used to color whole complement of Mandelbrot set]]
The distance estimate ''b'' of a pixel ''c'' (a complex number) from the Mandelbrot set is given by

: &lt;math&gt;b=\lim_{n \to \infty} 2 \cdot \frac{|{P_c^n(c)| \cdot \ln|{P_c^n(c)}}|}{|\frac{\partial}{\partial{c}} P_c^n(c)|},&lt;/math&gt;
where 
* &lt;math&gt;P_c(z) \,&lt;/math&gt; stands for [[complex quadratic polynomial]]
* &lt;math&gt;P_c^n(c)&lt;/math&gt; stands for ''n'' iterations of &lt;math&gt;P_c(z) \to z&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;z^2 + c \to z&lt;/math&gt;, starting with &lt;math&gt;z=c&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;!--
 --&gt; &lt;math&gt;P_c^{ 0}(c) = c&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;!--
 --&gt; &lt;math&gt;P_c^{ n+1}(c) = P_c^n(c)^2 + c&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial{c}} P_c^n(c)&lt;/math&gt; is the derivative of&lt;!--
 --&gt; &lt;math&gt;P_c^n(c)&lt;/math&gt; with respect to c. This derivative can be found by starting with&lt;!--
 --&gt; &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial{c}} P_c^{ 0}(c) = 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--
 --&gt; and then &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial{c}} P_c^{ n+1}(c) = 2\cdot{}P_c^n(c)\cdot\frac{\partial}{\partial{c}} P_c^n(c) + 1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;!--
 --&gt; This can easily be verified by using the chain rule for the derivative.

The idea behind this formula is simple: When the [[equipotential]] lines for the potential function &lt;math&gt;\phi(z)&lt;/math&gt; lie close, the number &lt;math&gt;|\phi'(z)|&lt;/math&gt; is large, and conversely, therefore the equipotential lines for the function &lt;math&gt;\phi(z)/|\phi'(z)|&lt;/math&gt; should lie approximately regularly.

From a mathematician's point of view, this formula only works in limit where ''n'' goes to infinity, but very reasonable estimates can be found with just a few additional iterations after the main loop exits.

Once ''b'' is found, by the Koebe 1/4-theorem, we know that there is no point of the Mandelbrot set with distance from ''c'' smaller than ''b/4''.

The distance estimation can be used for drawing of the boundary of the Mandelbrot set, see the article [[Julia set]].

====Interior distance estimation====
[[File:Mandelbrot Interior 600.png|thumb|Pixels colored according to the estimated interior distance]]
It is also possible to estimate the distance of a limitly periodic (i.e., inner) point to the boundary of the Mandelbrot set. The estimate is given by

: &lt;math&gt;b=\frac{1-\left|{\frac{\partial}{\partial{z}}P_c^p(z_0)}\right|^2}
  {\left|{\frac{\partial}{\partial{c}}\frac{\partial}{\partial{z}}P_c^p(z_0) +
        \frac{\partial}{\partial{z}}\frac{\partial}{\partial{z}}P_c^p(z_0)
        \frac{\frac{\partial}{\partial{c}}P_c^p(z_0)}
             {1-\frac{\partial}{\partial{z}}P_c^p(z_0)}} \right|},&lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the period,
* &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the point to be estimated,
* &lt;math&gt;P_c(z)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[complex quadratic polynomial]] &lt;math&gt;P_c(z)=z^2 + c&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;P_c^p(z_0)&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-fold iteration of &lt;math&gt;P_c(z) \to z&lt;/math&gt;, starting with &lt;math&gt;P_c^{ 0}(z) = z_0&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; is any of the &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; points that make the [[attractor]] of the iterations of &lt;math&gt;P_c(z) \to z&lt;/math&gt; starting with&lt;!--
 --&gt; &lt;math&gt;P_c^{ 0}(z) = c&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;z_0 = P_c^p(z_0)&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial{c}}\frac{\partial}{\partial{z}}P_c^p(z_0)&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;!--
 --&gt; &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial{z}}\frac{\partial}{\partial{z}}P_c^p(z_0)&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;!--
 --&gt; &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial{c}}P_c^p(z_0)&lt;/math&gt; and&lt;!--
 --&gt; &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial{z}}P_c^p(z_0)&lt;/math&gt; are various derivatives of&lt;!--
 --&gt; &lt;math&gt;P_c^p(z)&lt;/math&gt;, evaluated at &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt;.

Analogous to the exterior case, once ''b'' is found, we know that all points within the distance of ''b''/4 from ''c'' are inside the Mandelbrot set.

There are two practical problems with the interior distance estimate: first, we need to find &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; precisely, and second, we need to find &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; precisely.
The problem with &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; is that the convergence to &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; by iterating &lt;math&gt;P_c(z)&lt;/math&gt; requires, theoretically, an infinite number of operations.
The problem with any given &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is that, sometimes, due to rounding errors, a period is falsely identified to be an integer multiple of the real period (e.g., a period of 86 is detected, while the real period is only 43=86/2). In such case, the distance is overestimated, i.e., the reported radius could contain points outside the Mandelbrot set.

===Optimizations===

====Cardioid / bulb checking====
One way to improve calculations is to find out beforehand whether the given point lies within the cardioid or in the period-2 bulb. Before passing the complex value through the escape time algorithm, first check that:

:&lt;math&gt; p = \sqrt{  \left(x - \frac{1}{4}\right)^2 + y^2} &lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt; x \leq p - 2p^2 + \frac{1}{4} &lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt; (x+1)^2 + y^2 \leq \frac{1}{16} &lt;/math&gt;,

where ''x'' represents the real value of the point and ''y'' the imaginary value. The first two equations determine that the point is within the cardioid, the last the period-2 bulb.

The cardioid test can equivalently be performed without the square root:

:&lt;math&gt; q = \left(x - \frac{1}{4}\right)^2 + y^2, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; q \left(q + \left(x - \frac{1}{4}\right)\right) \leq \frac{1}{4}y^2. &lt;/math&gt;

3rd- and higher-order buds do not have equivalent tests, because they are not perfectly circular.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
|url=http://linas.org/art-gallery/bud/bud.html
|title=Mandelbrot Bud Maths}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible to find whether the points are within circles inscribed within these higher-order bulbs, preventing many, though not all, of the points in the bulb from being iterated.

====Periodicity checking====
To prevent having to do huge numbers of iterations for points in the set, one can perform periodicity checking. Check whether a point reached in iterating a pixel has been reached before. If so, the pixel cannot diverge and must be in the set.

Periodicity checking is, of course, a trade-off. The need to remember points costs memory and ''data management'' instructions, whereas it saves ''computational'' instructions.

However, checking against only one previous iteration can detect many periods with little performance overhead. For example, within the while loop of the pseudocode above, make the following modifications.
&lt;pre&gt;
  while (x*x + y*y &lt; 2*2  AND  iteration &lt; max_iteration) {
    xtemp = x*x - y*y + x0
    ytemp = 2*x*y + y0
    if (x == xtemp  AND  y == ytemp) {
      iteration = max_iteration
      break
    }
    x = xtemp
    y = ytemp
    iteration = iteration + 1
  }
&lt;/pre&gt;

====Border tracing / edge checking====
[[File:Mandelbrot DEM Sobel.png|thumbnail|right|Edge detection using Sobel filter of hyperbolic components of Mandelbrot set]]
It can be shown that if a solid shape can be drawn on the Mandelbrot set, with all the border colors being the same, then the shape can be filled in with that color. This is a result of the Mandelbrot set being simply connected. Boundary tracing works by following the [[polynomial lemniscate|lemniscates]] of the various iteration levels (colored bands) all around the set, and then filling the entire band at once. This can be a good speed increase, because it means that large numbers of points can be skipped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reocities.com/CapeCanaveral/5003/mandel.htm|title=Boundary Tracing Method|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220012221/http://www.reocities.com/CapeCanaveral/5003/mandel.htm|archivedate=2015-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar method operating on the same principle uses rectangles instead of arbitrary border shapes. It is usually faster than boundary tracing because it requires fewer calculations to work out the rectangle. It is inefficient, however, because boundaries are not rectangular, and so some areas can be missed. This issue can be minimized by creating a recursive algorithm that, if a rectangle border fails, will subdivide it into four smaller rectangles and test those, and either fill each or subdivide again and repeat the process.

However, this only works using discrete colors in the escape time algorithm. It will not work for smooth/continuous coloring.

==== Symmetry utilization ====
Simply put, rendering less than 100 percent of the image is required if the real axis is present in the image due to the symmetry of the set along the real axis, therefore the programmer would have to simply mirror the pixel color and placement as the image is rendered.  

==== Pythagorean theorem bailout method ====
Simple programs and scripts generally tend to set the escape, or bailout value to two. In doing so, the borders for the color bands are not smooth. The rendering process and colorization method can be improved by utilizing the distance from the origin and the point being rendered with the Pythagorean theorem by summing the squares of the real and imaginary portions of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; and then escaping if the value is larger or equal to four. The result of this optimization are smoother borders of the color bands, which leads to the images showing a resemblance to most others. Plus, of course, the rendering process of said image is faster.

====Perturbation theory and series approximation====
Very highly magnified images require more than the standard 64–128 or so bits of precision that most hardware [[Floating-point unit|floating-point units]] provide, requiring renderers to use slow "bignum" or "[[Arbitrary-precision arithmetic|arbitrary-precision]]" math libraries to calculate. However, this can be sped up by the exploitation of [[perturbation theory]]. Given

:&lt;math&gt; z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c &lt;/math&gt;

as the iteration, and a small epsilon and delta, it is the case that

:&lt;math&gt; (z_n + \epsilon)^2 + (c + \delta) = z_n^2 + 2z_n\epsilon + \epsilon^2 + c + \delta, &lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt; z_{n+1} + 2z_n\epsilon + \epsilon^2 + \delta, &lt;/math&gt;

so if one defines

:&lt;math&gt; \epsilon_{n+1} = 2z_n\epsilon_n + \epsilon_n^2 + \delta, &lt;/math&gt;

one can calculate a single point (e.g. the center of an image) using high-precision arithmetic (''z''), giving a ''reference orbit'', and then compute many points around it in terms of various initial offsets delta plus the above iteration for epsilon, where epsilon-zero is set to 0. For most iterations, epsilon does not need more than 16 significant figures, and consequently hardware floating-point may be used to get a mostly accurate image.&lt;ref&gt;

|url=http://www.fractalforums.com/announcements-and-news/superfractalthing-arbitrary-precision-mandelbrot-set-rendering-in-java/
|title=Superfractalthing - Arbitrary Precision Mandelbrot Set Rendering in Java}}&lt;/ref&gt; There will often be some areas where the orbits of points diverge enough from the reference orbit that extra precision is needed on those points, or else additional local high-precision-calculated reference orbits are needed. By measuring the orbit distance between the reference point and the point calculated with low precision, it can be detected that it is not possible to calculate the point correctly, and the calculation can be stopped. These incorrect points can later be re-calculated e.g. from another closer reference point.

Further, it is possible to approximate the starting values for the low-precision points with a truncated [[Taylor series]], which often enables a significant amount of iterations to be skipped.&lt;ref&gt;

An alternate explanation of the above: 

For the central point in the disc &lt;math&gt; c &lt;/math&gt; and its iterations &lt;math&gt; z_n &lt;/math&gt;, and an arbitrary point in the disc &lt;math&gt; c + \delta &lt;/math&gt; and its iterations &lt;math&gt; z'_n &lt;/math&gt;, it is possible to define the following iterative relationship:

:&lt;math&gt; z'_{n} = z_{n} + \epsilon_{n} &lt;/math&gt; 

With &lt;math&gt; \epsilon_{1} = \delta &lt;/math&gt;. Successive iterations of &lt;math&gt; \epsilon_n &lt;/math&gt; can be found using the following:

:&lt;math&gt; z'_{n+1} = {z'_n}^2 + (c + \delta) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; z'_{n+1} = (z_n + \epsilon_n)^2 + c + \delta &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; z'_{n+1} = {z_n}^2 + c + 2z_n\epsilon_n + {\epsilon_n}^2 + \delta&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; z'_{n+1} = z_{n+1} + 2z_n\epsilon_n + {\epsilon_n}^2 + \delta&lt;/math&gt;

Now from the original definition:
:&lt;math&gt; z'_{n+1} = z_{n+1} + \epsilon_{n+1} &lt;/math&gt;,

It follows that:

:&lt;math&gt; \epsilon_{n+1} = 2z_n\epsilon_n + {\epsilon_n}^2 + \delta &lt;/math&gt;

As the iterative relationship relates an arbitrary point to the central point by a very small change &lt;math&gt; \delta &lt;/math&gt;, then most of the iterations of &lt;math&gt; \epsilon_n &lt;/math&gt; are also small and can be calculated using floating point hardware.

However, for every arbitrary point in the disc it is possible to calculate a value for a given &lt;math&gt; \epsilon_{n} &lt;/math&gt; without having to iterate through the sequence from &lt;math&gt; \epsilon_0 &lt;/math&gt;, by expressing &lt;math&gt; \epsilon_n &lt;/math&gt; as a power series of &lt;math&gt; \delta &lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; \epsilon_n = A_{n}\delta + B_{n}\delta^2 + C_{n}\delta^3 + \dotsc &lt;/math&gt;

With &lt;math&gt; A_{1} = 1, B_{1} = 0, C_{1} = 0, \dotsc &lt;/math&gt;.

Now given the iteration equation of &lt;math&gt; \epsilon &lt;/math&gt;, it is possible to calculate the coefficients of the power series for each &lt;math&gt; \epsilon_n &lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \epsilon_{n+1} = 2z_n\epsilon_n + {\epsilon_n}^2 + \delta &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \epsilon_{n+1} = 2z_n(A_n\delta + B_n\delta^2 + C_n\delta^3 + \dotsc) + (A_n\delta + B_n\delta^2 + C_n\delta^3 + \dotsc)^2 + \delta &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \epsilon_{n+1} = (2z_nA_n+1)\delta + (2z_nB_n + {A_n}^2)\delta^2 + (2z_nC_n + 2A_nB_n)\delta^3  + \dotsc &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore it follows that:

:&lt;math&gt; A_{n+1} = 2z_nA_n + 1 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; B_{n+1} = 2z_nB_n + {A_n}^2 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; C_{n+1} = 2z_nC_n + 2A_nB_n &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \vdots &lt;/math&gt;

The cooefficents in the power series can be calculated as iterative series using only values from the central point's iterations &lt;math&gt; z &lt;/math&gt;, and do not change for any arbitrary point in the disc. If &lt;math&gt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; is very small, &lt;math&gt; \epsilon_n &lt;/math&gt; should be calculable to sufficient accuracy using only a few terms of the power series. As the Mandlebrot Escape Contours are 'continuous' over the complex plane, if a points escape time has been calculated, then the escape time of that points neighbours should be similar. Interpolation of the neighbouring points should provide a good estimation of where to start in the &lt;math&gt; \epsilon_n &lt;/math&gt; series. 

Further, separate interpolation of both real axis points and imaginary axis points should provide both an upper and lower bound for the point being calculated. If both results are the same (i.e. both escape or dot not escape) then the difference &lt;math&gt; \Delta n &lt;/math&gt; can be used to recuse until both an upper and lower bound can be established. If floating point hardware can be used to iterate the &lt;math&gt; \epsilon &lt;/math&gt; series, then there exists a relation between how many iterations can be achieved in the time it takes to use BigNum software to compute a given &lt;math&gt; \epsilon_n &lt;/math&gt;. If the difference between the bounds is greater than the number of iterations, it is possible to perform binomial search using BigNum software, successively halving the gap until it becomes more time efficient to find the escape value using floating point hardware.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4409">{{BLP sources|date=August 2010}}'''Mariann Aalda''' (born May 7, 1948) is an American television, stage, film actress, performance artist, and stand-up comic.

==Career==
She is best known for her work in television as DiDi Bannister-Stoner on ABC's ''[[The Edge of Night]]'' from 1981 until the show's cancellation in 1984. Later, she appeared on the CBS show ''[[Guiding Light]]''.  She also had regular roles on the [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[The Royal Family (TV series)|The Royal Family]]'', as the daughter of [[Redd Foxx]] and [[Della Reese]], and the [[HBO]] series ''[[1st &amp; Ten (HBO TV series)|1st &amp; Ten]]'', as the wife of [[O.J. Simpson]]'s character.

Aalda also achieved notoriety recurring on the CBS sitcom, ''Designing Women'', as Anthony's yuppie-from-hell girlfriend, Lita Ford, and on the [[NBC]] soap opera ''[[Sunset Beach (TV series)|Sunset Beach]]'' as the tragically disfigured Lena Hart.  Additionally, she co-hosted the lifestyle show ''Designs for Living'' on the USA Network and was a reporter for the magazine show ''NOW!'' on WNBC in New York.  Her numerous guest-star roles are mostly sitcom.

Aalda has also appeared in movies, co-starring in the urban cult film ''[[Class Act]]'' as rapper Kid's clueless mom, and as Coach Harrison in Nobody's Perfect. She was also a featured player in ''Beaches'' and ''Pretty Woman'', directed by Garry Marshall

'''Marie Pauline Depage''' (23 September 1872 – 7 May 1915) was a Belgian nurse, and wife of Dr [[Antoine Depage]]. She was killed in the [[Sinking of the RMS Lusitania|sinking of the RMS ''Lusitania'']], and she is commemorated in Belgium alongside the British nurse [[Edith Cavell]]

==Early life==
She was born Marie Pauline Picard, in [[Ixelles]] near [[Brussels]] in Belgium, one of two daughters and two sons of the engineer Désiré Émile Picard and Julie Marie Victorine Héger. She was a niece of Professor [[Paul Héger]] and granddaughter of [[Constantin Héger]].

She married a Belgian doctor [[Antoine Depage]] on 8 August 1893. They had three sons.

Her husband was a surgeon to the Belgian King [[Albert I of Belgium|Albert]], and chairman of the Belgian Red Cross. He was also a founder of the [[International Society of Surgery]] ([[Societe internationale de chirurgie]]) in 1902. Depage showed talent in drawing and painting; after studying human anatomy, she drew illustrations of her husband's surgical work.

Concerned at the antiquated nursing practice in Belgian hospitals run by nuns, Antoine Depage founded a [[Laïcité|laicised]] non-denominational medical institute in 1907, the [[Berkendael Medical Institute]] (also known as ''L'École Belge d’Infirmières Diplômées''), in [[Uccle]] near Brussels, with [[Edith Cavell]] as head nurse. Marie Depage took on the administrative work. The couple were also involved in the introduction of [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Baden-Powell]]'s scouting movement into Belgium in 1909-10, and Marie translated and published several of Baden-Powell's books.

==War work==
With her husband and eldest son Pierre, also a surgeon, Depage organised sending four Belgian ambulances to the Balkans during the [[First Balkan War]] in 1912-13, accompanying the ambulance sent to a hospital in Constantinople.

After the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Depage volunteered at the Red Cross hospital established at the [[Royal Palace]] in Brussels, and then helped her husband to covert the ''Grand Hôtel de l'Océan'' at [[De Panne]] (also known in French as [[La Panne]]) into a Red Cross hospital for military casualties (see [[:fr: Grand Hôtel de l'Océan]]), and organised surgical units to treat wounded soldiers of the Belgian Army near the [[Yser Front]].

Depage travelled to the US in January 1915 to raise funds for the ''L'Océan'' hospital. After raising $100,000 in a few weeks, she received news that her middle son Lucien would be joining her eldest son Pierre at the front, and decided to return to Belgium. She booked passage on the [[RMS Lusitania|RMS ''Lusitania'']], leaving New York on 1 May 1915 for Liverpool via [[Cobh|Queenstown]] in the south of Ireland. The ship was torpedoed by [[SM U-20 (Germany)|German submarine ''U-20'']] at about 2:10 pm on 7 May 1915, and rapidly sank. Depage assisted other passengers to board lifeboats, and treated some injured on the deck of the sinking vessel. As the ship sank, she became entangled in ropes and drowned, one of nearly 1,200 killed from almost 2,000 aboard.

Depage's body was one of 289 recovered, and was buried by her husband in the sand dunes near La Panne. The funeral was attended by the King and Queen of the Belgians, [[Albert I of Belgium|Albert I]] and [[Elisabeth of Bavaria, Queen of Belgium|Elizabeth]]. Depage established the Institute Marie Depage near the Hospital de l'Ocean in her honour.

A memorial by Belgian sculptor [[Paul Du Bois]] was erected at Uccle in 1920, to commemorate the deaths of Depage and Cavell in 1915. Cavell had been convicted of treason and executed by occupying German forces in October 1915. An inscription on the monument reads "Passant, dis-le à tes enfants, ils les ont tuées" (French: "Passer-by, tell your children, they killed them"). The monument stands next to the Edith Cavell Hospital, at the intersection of Rue Edith Cavell and Rue Marie Depage.

'''Multi-level (or multilevel) governance''' is an approach in [[political science]] and [[public administration theory]] that originated from studies on [[European integration]]. Political scientists [[Liesbet Hooghe]] and [[Gary Marks]] developed the concept of multi-level governance in the early 1990s and have continuously been contributing to the research program in a series of articles (see Bibliography).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Piattoni|first=Simona|title=Multi-level Governance: a Historical and Conceptual Analysis|journal=European Integration|year=2009|volume=2|series=31|pages=163–180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their theory resulted from the study of the new structures that were put in place by the EU ([[Maastricht Treaty]]) in 1992. Multi-level governance gives expression to the idea that there are many interacting authority structures at work in the emergent global political economy. It "illuminates the intimate entanglement between the domestic and international levels of authority".

==Origins and significance of the concept of multi-level governance==
'Multi-level governance' is a recent concept, having first entered the lexicon of political science around fifteen years ago as comparativists became re-acquainted with European integration and discovered that authority was shifting not only from central states up to Europe, but also down to subnational authorities. The first efforts to understand this were descriptive, spawning concepts that have generated an extensive literature. Multi-level, polycentric, and multi-layered governance emphasize the dispersion of decision making from the local to the global level. In recent years these concepts have cross-pollinated subfields of political science including [[European studies]] and [[decentralization]], [[federalism]] and [[international organization]], [[public policy]] (e.g. [[environmental policy]], [[health policy]]) and public-private governance, [[local governance]] and [[transnational governance]].

The authors of a recent survey of the literature on the structure of government conclude that ‘We attribute many of the recent “cutting-edge” theoretical contributions in political science to studies of “multi-level governance”’ and they note that although students of federalism ‘considered the current subject matter of their field to be based on well-defined, well rooted and broadly accepted ideas, they were nevertheless open to a new flowering of federal theory as a result of fertilization by these new MLG theoretical developments’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stein|first=Michael|author2=Lisa Turkewitsch|title=The Concept of Multilevel Governance in Studies of Federalism|journal=paper presented at the International Political Science Association|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is nothing entirely new under the sun. Though scarcely recognized at the time, this research revives a rich tradition in political science represented by [[Karl Deutsch]] (1966) on the effect of societal transactions on government structure, [[Robert Dahl]] (1973) on the virtues and vices of multilevel democracy, and [[Stein Rokkan]] (1983) on identity and territorial politics.

==Application of the concept==
===Multi-level governance and the European Union===
The study of the [[European Union]] has been characterized by two different theoretical phases. The first phase was dominated by studies from the field of [[international relations]]; in the second phase these studies were revised and insights from among others, [[public policy]] were added. The most straightforward way of understanding this theoretical shift is to see it as a move away from treating the EU as an [[international organisation]] similar to others (e.g. [[NATO]]) to seeing it as something unique among international organisations. The uniqueness of the EU relates both to the nature and to the extent of its development. This means that in some areas of activity the EU displays more properties related to national political systems than to those of international organisations.

The theory of multi-level governance belongs to the second phase. Multi-level governance characterizes the changing relationships between actors situated at different territorial levels, both from the public and the private sectors. The multi-level governance theory crosses the traditionally separate domains of domestic and international politics and highlights the increasingly fading distinction between these domains in the context of [[European integration]]. 
Multi-level governance was first developed from a study of EU policy and then applied to EU [[decision-making]] more generally. An early explanation referred to multi-level governance as ''a system of continuous negotiation among nested governments at several territorial tiers''&lt;ref&gt;G. Marks, 'Structural policy and Multi-level governance in the EC' in: A. Cafruny and G. Rosenthal (ed.) ''The State of the European Community: The Maastricht Debate and Beyond'' (Boulder 1993) pp.391–411&lt;/ref&gt; and described how ''supranational, national, regional, and local governments are enmeshed in territorially overarching policy networks''.&lt;ref&gt;I.Bache, ''Europeanization and Britain: Towards Multi-level governance?'' Paper prepared for the EUSA 9th Biennal Conference in Austin, Texas, 31–2 March April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The theory emphasized both the increasingly frequent and complex interactions between governmental actors and the increasingly important dimension of non-state actors that are mobilized in cohesion policy-making and in the EU policy more generally. As such, multi-level governance raised new and important questions about the role, power and authority of states.

No other international form of cooperation is characterized by such far-reaching integration as the [[European Union]]. This becomes evident by the number and scope of policy areas covered by the European Union and the way policy is developed. The European Union can be characterised by a mix of classic intergovernmental cooperation between sovereign states and far-reaching supranational integration.

Multi-level governance within the EU is understood as respecting competences, sharing responsibilities and cooperating between the various levels of governance: the EU, the Member States and the regional and local authorities. In this context, it refers to the principle of [[subsidiarity]], which places decisions as close as possible to the citizens and ensures that that action at Union level is justified in light of the possibilities available at national, regional or local level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Committee of the Regions|title=Multilevel governance: building Europe in partnership|url=http://cor.europa.eu/en/activities/governance/Pages/mlg.aspx|website=www.cor.europa.eu|publisher=Committee of the Regions}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice Multilevel Governance within the EU is about participation and coordination between all levels of government both in the decision making process and in the implementation or evaluation of European policies.

The combination of communal decision-making with the wide area of policy areas results in a deep entanglement of the member states’ national policy levels with the European policy level. This entanglement is one of the basic principles of the multi-level governance theory. The multi-level governance theory describes the European Union as a [[political system]] with interconnected institutions that exist at multiple levels and that have unique policy features. The European Union is a political system with a European layer ([[European Commission]], [[European Council]] and [[European Parliament]]), a national layer and a regional layer. These layers interact with each other in two ways: first, across different levels of government (vertical dimension) and second, with other relevant actors within the same level (horizontal dimension).

Concerning with the changes of the institutional design of the European Union, the current model governance has been shaped as a setup of constraints upon political margin of discretion, applying the central tenet of ordoliberalism with the aim to use strong rules in order to reduce the discretionary exercise of powers by institutions so as to avoid an arbitrary use of them. This principle has achieved an extreme effect at the European level, that one not to avoid arbitrary use of political powers but to keep political responsibility and participation out of the decision-making process. As Laruffa concludes: 
"It is quite clear that such a model of governance, which is made only by rules without any role for a democratic policy-making process, imposes a de facto limit to on the political rights of the European citizens. This means that there is a control exercised by rules over the European citizens rather than a control by the European citizens over rules and policies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.progressiveeconomy.eu/sites/default/files/papers/Matteo%20Laruffa%20The%20European%20economic%20governance.pdf Laruffa Matteo, The European Economic Governance: Problems and Proposals for Institutional Innovations, Winning Paper for the Annual Meeting Progressive Economy, Brussels, 6 March 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The European Union: Multilevel Governance in Practise'''

Within the European Union nearly 95,000 local and regional authorities currently have significant powers in key sectors such as education, the environment, economic development, town and country planning, transport, public services and social policies. These local and regional authorities implement nearly 70% of EU legislation. They help ensure the exercise of European democracy and citizenship. Special rights and competences for regions, cities and communities are supposed to enable and preserve diversity of governance at local and regional level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van den Brande and Delebarre|title=Committee of the Regions' White Paper on Multilevel Governance|url=http://web.cor.europa.eu/epp/Ourviews/Documents/White%20Paper%20on%20MLG.pdf|publisher=Committee of the Regions}}&lt;/ref&gt; By thinking beyond traditional EU - Member States relations the EU multi-level governance concept further strengthens regional and transnational cooperation. In a broader sense, this concept also includes the participation of non-state players like economic and social partners and civil society in the decision making process of all levels of governance(thus taking up the vertical and horizontal dimensions of multilevel governance).

'''The Treaty of Lisbon as an important step towards Multilevel Governance'''

The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] represents an important step towards institutional recognition of multi-level governance in the way the European Union operates. It strengthens the competences and influence of local and regional authorities in the Community decision-making process giving roles to national (and regional) parliaments and the [[Committee of the Regions]] and enshrines the territorial dimension of the European Union, notably territorial cohesion as part of the process of European integration. The Committee of the Regions has established a system to monitor the compliance with the subsidiarity thorough the whole EU policy and law making process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Committee of the Regions: Subsidiarity Monitoring Network|url=http://cor.europa.eu/en/activities/networks/Pages/subsidiarity-monitoring-network.aspx|website=www.cor.europa.eu|publisher=Committee of the Regions|accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Multilevel governance within the EU as an ongoing process'''

Nevertheless, multi-level governance within the EU is a dynamic and ongoing process. On 16 June 2009 the Committee of the Regions adopted a White Paper on multi-level governance which recommended specific mechanisms and instruments for stimulating all stages of the European decision-making process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van den Brande|first1=Luc|last2=Delebarre|first2=Michel|title=The Committee of the Regions' White Paper on Multi-level Governance|url=http://web.cor.europa.eu/epp/Ourviews/Documents/White%20Paper%20on%20MLG.pdf|website=www.cor.europa.eu|publisher=Committee of the Regions}}&lt;/ref&gt; This document, together with the follow-up opinion "Building a European culture of Multilevel Governance"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van den Brande|first1=Luc|title=Building a European Culture of Multilevel Governance: Follow-up to the Committee of the Regions' White Paper|url=http://www.toad.cor.europa.eu/ViewDoc.aspx?doc=cdr%5ccivex-v%5cdossiers%5ccivex-v-020%5cEN%5cCDR273-2011_FIN_AC_EN.doc&amp;docid=2829023|website=www.cor.europa.eu|publisher=Committee of the Regions}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; affirmed the Committee’s political commitment to Multi-level Governance, proposing a first political project for Building Europe in partnership. As a follow up to the 2009 White paper on Multi-level Governance, the Committee developed a "Scoreboard on Multi-level Governance" to monitor on a yearly basis the development of multi-level governance at European Union level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Committee of the Regions|title=The Multilevel Governance Scoreboard|url=http://cor.europa.eu/en/activities/governance/Pages/mlg-scoreboard.aspx|website=www.cor.europa.eu|publisher=Committee of the Regions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Charter for Multi-level Governance in Europe'''

On 3 April 2014 the Committee of the Regions adopted a Charter for Multi-level Governance calling public authorities of all levels of governance to use and promote multi-level governance in their future undertakings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Committee of the Regions|title=Charter for Multilevel Governance in Europe|url=http://cor.europa.eu/en/activities/governance/Pages/charter-for-multiLevel-governance.aspx|website=www.cor.europa,eu|publisher=Committee of the Regions}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Charter is open for signature to:

• all European Union local and regional authorities;

• European and national associations of local and regional authorities, as well as local and regional authorities' network are invited to officially commit to multilevel governance principles, giving the Charter their formal support;

• National and European political figures wishing to back up the Charter are also invited to declare their support&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=New|first1=Europe|title=CoR: Charter for Multi-level Governance in Europe|url=http://www.neurope.eu/article/cor-charter-multilevel-governance-europe|accessdate=3 April 2014|agency=New Europe|date=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multi-level governance beyond the European Union===
The point of departure for multi-level governance was Europe, but recent books and articles have dealt with the dispersion of authority away from central states in Latin America, Asia, and North America. Decentralization has been at least as marked in Latin America as in Europe over the past two decades, and several Asian countries have decentralized in the past decade.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand &amp; Laliberte 2010; Bird &amp; Vaillancourt 2008; Eaton 2008; Falleti 2010; Smoke et al. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Dispersion of authority above the national state is most evident in the EU, but it is not sui generis. A recent survey counts 32 regional IGOs pooling authority over quite wide areas of policy and which cover all but a handful of states in the world today.&lt;ref&gt;Goertz &amp; Powers 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The number of governmental and non-governmental [[international organizations]] has increased markedly over the past two decades, as has their scope, range and intrusiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Acharya &amp; Johnston 2007; Farrell et al. 2005; Hurrell 1993; Volgy et al. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Crossborder interdependence – from migration to climate change to terrorism – has stimulated regional organization in many parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Brondizio, Ostrom, Young 2009; Hurrell 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vertical and horizontal dimension of multi-level governance==
The "vertical" dimension refers to the linkages between higher and lower levels of government, including their institutional, financial, and informational aspects. Here, local capacity building and incentives for effectiveness of sub national levels of government are crucial issues for improving the quality and coherence of public policy.

The "horizontal" dimension refers to co-operation arrangements between regions or between municipalities. These agreements are increasingly common as a means by which to improve the effectiveness of local public service delivery and implementation of development strategies.

==Consequences and practical relevance of multi-level governance==
There has been an intensification of research on the consequences as well as the character of multi-level governance. The concept was developed as a tool of pure research, but it now motivates policy makers. From the late 1990s the European Commission began to refer to its own mission as one of achieving multilevel governance, especially in cohesion policy.&lt;ref&gt;Leonardi (2005: 7)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the Commission set up a committee on multilevel governance to contribute to its White Paper on governance. José Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission, claims that ‘the multilevel system of governance on which our European regional policy is based provides a key boost to the Union's competitive edge’ and that, in the current economic crisis, 'multilevel governance must be a priority'.&lt;ref&gt;‘Own-Initiative Opinion of the Committee of the Regions on The Committee of the Regions’ White Paper on Multilevel Governance’, 80th plenary session, 17–18 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In an October 2008 resolution, the European Parliament called on the member states ‘to develop as quickly as possible the practical measures set out in the First Action Programme . . . with a view to strengthening multilevel governance’.&lt;ref&gt;European Parliament resolution of 21 October 2008 on governance and partnership at national and regional levels and a basis for projects in the sphere of regional policy (2008/2064(INI)).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, 344 representatives of elected regional and local authorities across the EU approved a resolution on a 'European Union Charter for Multilevel Governance', which would bring localities and regions into European democratic decision making.&lt;ref&gt;‘Own-Initiative Opinion of the Committee of the Regions on The Committee of the Regions’ White Paper on Multilevel Governance’, 80th plenary session, 17–18 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

This theme has been taken up by several political parties including the European Peoples Party, representing Christian democratic parties in the European Parliament, which recently stated that ‘multilevel governance should be one of the guiding principles of the EU, an integral part of any European strategy or policy where local and regional authorities are widely implicated, and monitored closely to ensure that it is indeed being put into practice on the ground’.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.cor.europa.eu/epp/News/Pages/18October2011.aspx (accessed on 13 November 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

International organizations have also taken positions on the issue. In 2009, the United Nations Development Programme released a report, ‘Delivering Human Security through Multilevel Governance’, which argued that ‘the two-level approach to international relations . . . is being replaced by a much more complex multilevel system of governance that also involves local, sub-national providers of public goods as well as regional governance actors acting at a supranational but not a global level’. The World Bank has commissioned a series of studies examining multilevel governance; the United Nations has a research and training institute on comparative regional integration that studies ‘multilevel regulatory processes and the relations between sub- and supra-national regional governance’,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cris.unu.edu/Comparative-Regional-Integration.15.0.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509103529/http://www.cris.unu.edu/Comparative-Regional-Integration.15.0.html |archivedate=9 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }} (accessed on 13 November 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; and the OECD has created a directorate on multilevel governance.

However, the consequences of multilevel governance are debated. In the eyes of its detractors, multilevel governance exacerbates corruption (Treisman 2000), leads to gridlock (Scharpf 2007), engenders moral hazard (Rodden 2006), constrains redistribution (Obinger, Castles, Leibfried 2005), obfuscates accountability (Peters &amp; Pierre 2004), and wastes money (Berry 2009). Research on both causes and consequences of multi-level governance is ongoing and more and more information about the subnational as well as the international dimension of multi-level governance is available in the context of larger data sets.&lt;ref&gt;For a current large-scale research project on multi-level governance see http://www.falw.vu/~mlg/{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Amongst others, the project codes regional authority in 74 countries between 1950 and 2010 as well as international authority in 72 [[international governmental organizations]] from 1950 to 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|title=National Energy Policies and Energy Security in the Context of Climate Change and Global Environmental Risks: A Theoretical Framework for Reconciling Domestic and International Law Through a Multiscalar and Multilevel Approach|journal=European Energy and Environmental Law Review|date=2011|volume=20|issue=6|ssrn=1970698}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multi-level governance of climate change in cities ===
Global climate change is being contributed to by ever increasing levels of greenhouse gas emissions emanating from decisions and activities of individuals and organisations at local, regional, national and international levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bulkeley|first=Harriet|author2=Kristine Kern|title=Local Government and the Governing of Climate Change in Germany and the UK|journal=Urban Studies|year=2006|volume=43|series=12|pages=2237–2259|doi=10.1080/00420980600936491}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cities are suggested to contribute up to 75% of global carbon dioxide emissions, reflecting the increasing proportions of global populations living and working in cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bulkeley|first=Harriet|title=Cities and the Governing of Climate Change|journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources|year=2010|volume=12|pages=141–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; As we know, tackling climate change is an extensive, time-consuming and costly task, a task that cannot be achieved solely through the policy implementation and regulation from central governments and bodies alone. It has become increasingly clear that nation-states will be unable to commit to and meet international targets and agreements for offsetting climate change without engaging with the activity of sub-national and local action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Betsill|first=Michele|author2=Harriet Bulkeley|title=Cities and the Multi-level Governance of Global Climate Change|journal=Global Governance|year=2006|volume=12|pages=141–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hereby, warranting the extreme importance of multi-level governance of climate change within cities.

Forms of governance at multi-levels have taken off increasingly at the local scale, building upon the notion of ‘think global, act local’, in cities in particular. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions stem from certain activities that originate from specific places, bringing about thought that the local scale is the most appropriate political scale to produce necessary offsets in emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Betsill|first=Michele|author2=Harriet Bulkeley|title=Cities and the Multi-level Governance of Global climate Change|journal=Global Governance|year=2006|volume=12|pages=141–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cities are exemplary of such specific places in which local governance action can and will help reduce GHG emissions. The levels of governance authority handed down to local governments within cities has been perceived to out-do policy goals within the national and international arena,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Betsill|first=Michele|author2=Harriet Bulkeley|title=Cities and the Multi-level Governance of Global climate Change|journal=Global Governance|year=2006|volume=12|pages=141–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some local governments taking on their own initiatives for tackling urban climate change. This sets an important stance to which the local scale of multi-level governance is important for tackling global climate change within the urban arena.

Four distinct modes of governance exist within the dynamics of climate change in cities. Each stems from the local level with the ability of being implemented on multi-scales to mitigate and adapt to urban climate change. Self-governing is the capacity of local governments to govern its own activities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kern|first=Kristine|author2=Gotelind Alber|title=Governing Climate Change in Cities: Modes of urban Climate Governance in Multi-level Systems|journal=Conference on Competitive Cities and Climate Change|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as improving energy efficiency within a designated city, without the burdening pressure to meet targets of increased energy efficiencies set by national governments. A form of self-governing within multi-level systems is horizontal collaboration where cities may collaborate with regions demonstrating multi-levels of governance to tackle urban climate change,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kern|first=Kristine|author2=Gotelind Alber|title=Governing Climate Change in Cities: Modes of urban Climate Governance in Multi-level Systems|journal=Conference on Competitive Cities and Climate Change|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; imperative to the success of city climate change policy. Governing through enabling is the co-ordination and facilitation of partnerships with private organisations by the local government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Kern|first = Kristine|title = Governing Climate Change in Cities: Modes of urban Climate Governance in Multi-level Systems|journal = Conference on Competitive Cities and Climate Change.|year = 2008|url = |last2 = Gotelind Alber}}&lt;/ref&gt; National governments also implement this mode of governance to implement policy and action within cities. Governing through provision, a form of vertical collaboration along with governing through enabling, applies itself to the multi-levels of governance. Climate change in cities is tackled here through the shaping of and delivery of services and resources, with additional support aided to local governments from regional and national authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kern|first=Kristine|author2=Gotelind Alber|title=Governing Climate Change in Cities: Modes of urban Climate Governance in Multi-level Systems|journal=Conference on Competitive Cities and Climate Change|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, another form of vertical collaboration, is governing through regulation. Such regulation characterises traditional forms of authoritative governance, exemplifying local to nation-state relations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kern|first=Kristine|author2=Gotelind Alber|title=Governing Climate Change in Cities: Modes of urban Climate Governance in Multi-level Systems|journal=Conference on Competitive Cities and Climate Change|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; almost nearly covering the entirety of the multi-level governance scale.

=== Subnational Integration of Climate Actions ===
Within the various initiatives of the Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership ([[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)|LEDS GP]]), the thematic working group on Subnational Integration ([http://ledsgp.org/working-groups/subnational-integration-of-leds/ SNI-WG]) was created in 2013 to support learning and facilitate collaboration between national and subnational governments for accelerated effective climate actions. The SNI-WG realizes several activities at global and regional levels including organizing panels at multiple regional and global forums, hosting peer-learning discussions, publishing reports and case studies, along with facilitating technical workshops, webinars and providing advisory Remote Expert Assistance on LEDS ([http://ledsgp.org/assistance REAL]) support upon request. This process has generated observations, feedback and insights on the potential of the vertical integration and coordination of subnational climate actions to accelerate and scale-up both local and global emission reductions. Improving coordination and integration between the different levels of authority in a country is critical in determining both national and global capacity to govern climate change. City and subnational governments require support from the national government, and vice versa, in order to design and implement intersectoral policies and actions for domestic decarbonization pathways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/multilevel-governance-low-emission-development-lac/?loclang=en_gb|title=Forging low emission development paths in Latin America: Multilevel dynamics in the world’s most urbanized region|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multilevel governance theory and empirical evidence demonstrate that the coordination and vertical integration of climate actions can:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://ledsgp.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Coordination-and-vertical-integration-of-climate-actions-web-final.pdf|title = The Coordination and Vertical Integration of Climate Actions|last = Muller|first = Scott A|date = 2015|journal = LEDS GP Working Paper|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Help alleviate domestic political constraints.
* Raise national government ambitions for more aggressive Intended Nationally Determined Contributions ([http://unfccc.int/focus/indc_portal/items/8766.php INDCs]) and [[Greenhouse gas|GHG mitigation]] commitments.
* Scale up, as well as unlock, additional and new mitigation opportunities at the subnational level.
* Accelerate the effective implementation of national targets, strategies and development priorities by “localizing” them. This can also provide opportunities for “bundled approaches” and increasing “co-benefits” by linking local priorities with diverse development objectives Improve the consistency of sub-national and national climate data sets; strengthening MRV.
* Create a more bankable “low-risk” environment for infrastructure finance and private sector investments.
* Enable safe learning and strengthen domestic institutions.
* Address recognized challenges and limits to sub-national [[Non-state actor|non-state actor (NSA)]] climate actions.
* Expand and accelerate the flow of international public and private climate finance to cities, urban infrastructure and local priorities.
* Help address some of the persistent collective action challenges to multilateral climate agreements.

==== Cities for Climate Protection program ====

The [[Cities for Climate Protection program|Cities for Climate Protection]] (CCP) program is one example of multi-level governance of climate change. Roles and responsibilities are shared within different levels of governance, from state actors to non-state actors (Betsill &amp; Bulkeley, 2006). Membership consists of 40 large cities worldwide ([[Large Cities Climate Leadership Group]]), with local governments often working in close connection with national governments. However, the CCP can overlook the activity of nation-states giving local governments the opportunity to amend positions of policy implementation and regulation for offsetting urban climate change, which may be of a controversial nature to national governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Betsill|first=Michele|author2=Harriet Bulkeley|title=Cities and the Multi-level Governance of Global Climate Change|journal=Global Governance|year=2006|volume=12|pages=141–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus illustrating even though climate change in cities can be addressed and governed at local, regional, national and international levels, it does not always follow a hierarchical order.

==Criticism on multi-level governance theory==
Many of the problems associated with multi-level governance revolve around the notion of levels. The very idea of levels and levels of analysis is imbued with hierarchical implications. However, different levels or social spaces often interact or cut across with one another in complex ways that are not strictly hierarchical. To what extent can 'levels' be identified at all? The notion that international bodies constitute a discrete level of authority and governance is contestable. International regulatory networks may not be separate sources of authority but instead represent the reconstitution of state authority and the pursuit of state-level governance by other means. While territorial levels make sense when we are referring to public forms of authority, they seem less compatible with private and market forms of authority.

Another criticism on the theory of multi-level governance is that it's not really a proper theory, rather that it is an approach. The main difference between multi-level governance and other theories of integration is that it gets rid of the continuum or grey area between [[intergovernmentalism]] and [[supranationalism]] and leaves in its place a descriptive structure. This theory does not address the [[sovereignty]] of states directly, but instead simply says that a multi-level structure is being created by subnational and supranational actors. One of the main questions of integration theory, namely, the transfer of loyalty and sovereignty between national and supranational entities and the future of this relationship in the EU is not specifically addressed in this theory.

The identification of partial political measures and general macroeconomics is divided on diverse decisional levels. National governments maintain an important decisional role but the control unlocalizes at supranational level. Individual national sovereignty is dilated in this decisional process and the supranational institutions have an autonomic role.

== Arguments for multi-level governance ==
=== Security ===
The use of security as a means of instituting ideals of democracy. The shift to a multi-level governance perspective of enforcing the ideals prevents one nation from imposing its personal agenda or perception of what these ideals entail. Additionally, the use of supranational judgement creates a uniformity for the international portrayal and enforcement of democratic principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Croft|first1=Stuart|last2=Howorth|first2=Jolyon|last3=Krahmann|first3=Elke|last4=Terriff|first4=Terry|last5=Webber|first5=Mark|title=The Governance of European Security|journal=Review of International Studies|date=2004|volume=30|issue=1|pages=3–26|jstor=20097896}}&lt;/ref&gt; The utilization of multi-level security governance allows for a pooling of resources to manage this enforcement, while still allowing States to act autonomously. The supranational level merely acts as a medium for allowing the promotion of mutually beneficial security. With the rise of transnational threats, a method for ensuring international security without the reliance on a single policing nation is required. Multi-level governance provides functional means of dealing with the deficiencies of merely national actors dealing with transnational issues on the international stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Croft|first1=Stuart|last2=Howorth|first2=Jolyon|last3=Krahmann|first3=Elke|last4=Terriff|first4=Terry|last5=Webber|first5=Mark|title=The Governance of European Security|journal=Review of International Studies|date=2004|volume=30|issue=1|pages=3–26|jstor=20097896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic Interdependence ===
The preliminary notion of the European Union was the European Coal and Steel Community. The union was between the nations of France, Belgium, Italy, Netherlands, Luxembourg, and West Germany. Striving for the concept of European peace the nations sought to bind the nations through economic interdependence. Coming about as a reaction to World War II, the ECSC created an economic tie for previously independent nations. It provided the European peace the nations sought, and would evolve into the European Union seen today. It was not a new concept as trade has historically been viewed as a catalyst for peace between nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gartzke|first1=Erik|last2=Quan|first2=Li|last3=Boehmer|first3=Charles|title=Investing in the Peace: Economic Interdependence and International Conflict|journal=International Organization|date=2001|volume=55|issue=2|pages=391–438|jstor=3078636}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creating multi-level governance is shown to create the necessary ties for fostering economic interdependence to a greater degree than mere trade between nations. The linking of nations through a sharing of capital creates an adhesiveness that deters the escalation of political conflict from reaching a state of war. On the international stage, political conflict leads to war as a result of perception of potential gains being larger than the opportunity costs. Interdependence created by multi-level governance is shown to greatly reduce the probability of war by increasing the opportunity costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gartzke|first1=Erik|last2=Quan|first2=Li|last3=Boehmer|first3=Charles|title=Investing in the Peace: Economic Interdependence and International Conflict|journal=International Organization|date=2001|volume=55|issue=2|pages=391–438|jstor=3078636}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in opportunity cost to war can be viewed from even the economic ties perspective. It is seen by noting that economic ties between participatory nations makes the cost of disruption to the system through the escalation of the political sphere towards war illogical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blanchard|first1=Jean-Marc|last2=Ripsman|first2=Norrin|title=Qualitative Research on Economic Interdependence and Conflict: Overcoming Methodological Hurdles|journal=Economic Interdependence and International Conflict: New Perspectives on an Enduring Debate|date=2003|pages=310–323|jstor=10.3998/mpub.11952.22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Efficiency ===
Multi-level government has shown to increase efficiency of governance by creating an agreed upon standard for the implementation and execution of policies. To elaborate, the establishment of a supranational institution can be used to set standards for the way cooperating nations run their environmental, industrial, and safety policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gruber|first1=Lloyd|title=The Efficiency Rationale for Supranational Governance|journal=Ruling the World: Power Politics and the Rise of Supranational Institutions|date=2000|pages=61–80|jstor=j.ctt7s8w1.9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key factor for multi-level governance is the terms the national actors agree to when forming the supranational institution as they will give certain decision making processes to the higher level, and agree to abide by the outcome. Nations consent to the terms as they face a common issue of international policy that has to deal with collective-action problems making it nonsensical to attend to by themselves. Agreements between nations to form a multi-level government creates an efficiency gain that allows them to all share in the positive benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gruber|first1=Lloyd|title=The Efficiency Rationale for Supranational Governance|journal=Ruling the World: Power Politics and the Rise of Supranational Institutions|date=2000|pages=61–80|jstor=j.ctt7s8w1.9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal ==
Before his murder, Kothari told police he had received threats.&lt;ref name=timesofindia&gt;{{cite news|first=Deshdeep |last=Saxena |title=Murdered MP journo was framed 19 times |publisher=[[Times of India]] |date=June 27, 2015 |accessdate=September 27, 2015 |pages= |language=| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Murdered-MP-journo-was-framed-in-19-false-cases/articleshow/47838288.cms }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was already known to police, since as a result of his controversial reporting, Kothari had a long list of over 19 false accusations on record in various police stations in his home state, including common goat theft and rape. Although he was jailed for over 16 months awaiting trial for rape, none of the cases led to a conviction.&lt;ref name=catchnews /&gt;&lt;ref name=timesofindia /&gt;&lt;ref name=indianexpress&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/mp-journalist-burnt-to-death-by-mining-mafia-three-held/|title=MP journalist burnt to death by mining mafia, 3 arrested|date=21 June 2015|work=[[The Indian Express]]|accessdate=2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Kothari’s sister Sandhya and brother Rahul begged him to stop reporting about the sand mafia as it was risking his life.&lt;ref name=dnaindia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-mp-scribe-killing-i-told-my-brother-leave-journalism-or-you-will-die-says-sandeep-kothari-s-sister-2097799 |title=MP scribe killing: I told my brother 'leave journalism or you will die', says Sandeep Kothari's sister|work=[[DNA India]]|accessdate=2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CPJ&gt;{{cite web|title=Sandeep Kothari |url=https://cpj.org/killed/2015/sandeep-kothari.php |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists |accessdate=October 26, 2015 |date=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Kothari came from a business family. His father had a small convenience store, known in India as a [[kirana store]]. Kothari and his two brothers were forest contractors and shared this family business before his brothers opened an automobile repair shop and Kothari went into journalism at ''[[Deshbandhu]]''.&lt;ref name=thehoot&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehoot.org/media-watch/media-practice/anatomy-of-a-journalist-s-murder-8409|title=Anatomy of a journalist's murder|work=The Hoot |date=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandeep Kothari was a Hindi-language journalist since 2005. Over his career, he wrote for prominent newspapers, such as ''Nai Duniya'', ''[[Hari Bhoomi]]'' (sometimes transliterated as ''Haribhumi''), and ''Deshbandhu'' around [[Jabalpur]]. After 2012, he left ''Nai Duniya'' to freelance.&lt;ref name=indianexpress /&gt; He specialized in investigating illegal [[chit fund]] schemes, manganese and [[sand mining]] and [[land grabbing]] around [[Katangi]] and [[Tirodi]], and he became adept at using India's [[Right to Information Act, 2005|Right to Information]] (RTI) Act to get information about his subjects.&lt;ref name=thehoot /&gt; More recently, Kothari had turned to freelance work as journalist and published his own work out of [[Katangi]].&lt;ref name=catchnews /&gt;&lt;ref name=IFEX /&gt;&lt;ref name=indianexpress /&gt;&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3929835/indian-journalist-murders-sandeep-kothari-madhya-pradesh/|title=India: Illegal Mining Linked to Murder of Journalist Sandeep Kothari|author=Rohit Inani / New Delhi|work=[[TIME]]|accessdate=2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=frontline&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/the-nation/death-for-daring/article7395357.ece|title=Death for daring|work=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]|accessdate=2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The police called him a "[[History-sheeter|history sheeter]]" -- a term used to disparage journalism -- in reference to his recent investigations around Katangi.&lt;ref name=indianexpress /&gt;

After the murder, the [[Madhya Pradesh Police]] appointed a Special Investigation Team to look into the murder. Three arrests have been made after the murder.

Police received complaints that Kothari was a [[Blackmail|blackmailer]], however, his family and colleagues assert that these are just more false accusations like the ones made during his final years.&lt;ref name=thehoot /&gt;

== Context ==
[[File:Loading illegally dredged sand.JPG|250px|right|thumb|Illegal sandmining operation in India.]]Kothari’s murder was connected to the local [[Illegal_sand_mining_in_Madhya_Pradesh|sand mining mafia]] as he was exposing their practices. Sand mining is an illegal process of removing sand and selling it as material to a construction company. Worldwide sand mining is a $70 billion industry.&lt;ref name=Wired&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Wired Magazine|work=Wired|title=The Deadly Global War For Sand|date=March 26, 2013 |accessdate=November 8, 2015|url= https://www.wired.com/2015/03/illegal-sand-mining/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The activity is primarily a local operation that is set up close to construction work. India does not have enough legal sand to fill demand. However, the Indian [[Planning Commission (India)|Planning Commissio]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;n estimates that sand mining constitutes almost 9 percent of the nation's [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]]. While sand mining has a high profit margin for those who run it, it has environmental impacts and is therefore regulated. Sand mining companies, therefore have been known to rely on [[bribing]] government and law enforcement to work untouched.&lt;ref name=IndiaRealTime&gt;{{cite web|publisher=India Real Time|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|title=Why Indian has a “Sand Mafia”|date=August 6, 2013 |accessdate=November 8, 2015|url= https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2013/08/06/why-india-has-a-sand-mafia/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mining mafias in India have been implicated in hundreds of deaths, including government officials, police officers, journalists, and citizens.&lt;ref name=Wired /&gt;&lt;ref name=catchnews /&gt;

== Impact == 
Sandeep Kothari was targeted by the mining [[mafia]] because of his reports to expose the sand mafia and illegal mining activities.&lt;ref name=bbcnews&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-33253254|title=The perils of being an Indian journalist|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ndtv1 /&gt; However, Kothari was not the only journalist to suffer this fate at the hands of the sand mafia. Weeks before Sandeep's murder, [[Murder of Jagendra Singh|Jagendra Singh]], a journalist from [[Shahjahanpur]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], was burned 1 June 2015 and he died from the attack on 8 June.&lt;ref name=catchnews /&gt;&lt;ref name=time /&gt;&lt;ref name=ndtv1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcnews /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Journalist burnt alive; UP minister, cops charged|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Journalist-burnt-alive-UP-minister-cops-charged/articleshow/47607739.cms|accessdate=November 26, 2015|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; And Haider Khan, a journalist from the same area as Singh, was beaten by the sand mining mafia.&lt;ref name=time /&gt;

== Reactions ==
[[Irina Bokova]], director-general of [[UNESCO]], has called for an investigation into the death of Sandeep Kothari and is urging authorities to bring the crime’s perpetrators to trial.&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web|publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization|work=[[UNESCO]]|title=Director-General deplores killing of Indian journalist Sandeep Kothari|date=July 2, 2015 |accessdate=October 26, 2015|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/resources/news-and-in-focus-articles/all-news/news/director_general_deplores_killing_of_indian_journalist_sandeep_kothari/#.Vi5MGvmrRaQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[International Federation of Journalists]] (IFJ) said, "It is critical for the safety and independence of media in India that these incidents be investigated swiftly and transparently and with immediate steps taken to remedy the situation."&lt;ref name=IFEX /&gt;

The Indian Journalists Union (IJU) and the [[Press Council of India]] (PCI) addressed the "intolerance" directed at Indian journalists that raises their security risks, and have called on the police departments of India to investigate Kothari’s murder along with the other recent.&lt;ref name=IFEX /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5633">'''Máel mac Donngaile''' (died 859), known as '''Máel Gualae''', was a [[King of Munster]] from the [[Eóganacht Chaisil]] branch of the [[Eoganachta]], the ruling dynasty of Munster. He was of the Clann Faílbe sept of this branch and a grandson of [[Tnúthgal mac Donngaile]] (died 820), whom some sources name as King of Munster and brother of [[Áilgenán mac Donngaile]] (died 853), also King of Munster.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, Table 12&lt;/ref&gt; His branch of the ruling dynasty had their lands in the [[Cashel, County Tipperary|Cashel]] area of modern [[County Tipperary]]. He reigned from 856 to 859.

After the death of Áilgenán in 853 there was an interregnum until the succession of his brother Máel Gualae in 856.&lt;ref&gt;''Annals of Innisfallen, AI 856.1&lt;/ref&gt; The Danes had arrived in Ireland in 849 and took control of Dublin in 851. The dispersed Norse went off to plunder different areas of Ireland and a rivalry began between these two Viking groups with Irish kings using this rivalry in their own conflicts. A number of men in Munster joined up with these Norse and were known as ''Gall Gaedil'' ("foreign Gaels"). [[Cerball mac Dúnlainge]] (died 888), King of [[Osraige]] aligned himself with the Danes versus the Norse to become the most powerful ruler in southern Ireland during this period. 

During the interregnum, the [[High King of Ireland]] [[Máel Sechnaill mac Máele Ruanaid]] (died 862) of [[Clann Cholmáin]] led an expedition into Munster in 854 as far as the borders of the [[Déisi]] in Tipperary County  and took hostages from Munster.&lt;ref&gt;''Annals of Ulster'', AU 854.2&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Fragmentary Annals of Ireland]]'' claim that Cerball, brother-in-law of the high king, was sent by the high king into Munster as well to claim the hostages.&lt;ref&gt;''Fragmentary Annals of Ireland'', FA 246&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Annals of the Four Masters]]'', the Norse had instigated the opposition to the high king in Munster.&lt;ref&gt;''Annals of The Four Masters'', AFM 852.3&lt;/ref&gt; The high king appeared again at Cashel to take hostages from Munster in 856, probably at the time of the accession of Máel Gualae.&lt;ref&gt;AU 856.2&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Norse activities in Munster were a disruptive influence and around 855 the men of Munster appealed to Cerball of Osraige for aid against the Norse. Cerball arrived with a force of Danes under a leader named Horm and they surrounded the Norse and massacred them.&lt;ref&gt;FA 254&lt;/ref&gt; In 856 a Norse force slew Gormán son of Lonán, heir designate of Cashel, at [[Loch Cenn]].&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicum Scotorum'', CS 856&lt;/ref&gt; In 857 Cerball and his Danish allies, [[Amlaíb Conung]] and Ímar, won a victory over the Norse and Gall Gaeill under Kettil "The Fair" in the Munster territory of Arad Tíre in northern Tipperary.&lt;ref&gt;AU 857.1, FA 263&lt;/ref&gt;

In 858 Máel Sechnaill led a large muster of the men of Ireland into Munster to exact hostages. This time Cerball was his enemy as well as the [[Leinster]]men had complained to the high king of him. The forces of Cerball and Máel Gualae had been stationed at Belach Gabrán in southern Osraige, possibly at [[Goresbridge]] on the [[River Barrow]], to oppose the High King's army, but this took an unexpected route and their forces were divided. The High King inflicted a shattering defeat on the forces of Máel Gualae at the Battle of Carn Lugdoch (near modern [[Waterford]]) and the King of the Déisi, Máel Crón mac Muiredaig, was slain. The High King remained at [[Emly]] for a month raiding all of Munster as far as the sea in Desmond. He took hostages from all the lands of Munster. Many of the Norse-Gaels were slain by the High King's army. The defeat of the Munstermen led Cerball to also submit and give hostages to the high king.&lt;ref&gt;AU 858.4, FA 260&lt;/ref&gt;  

The next year however in 859 Cerball again defied Máel Sechnaill and with his Danish allies led an expedition into [[kingdom of Mide|Mide]].&lt;ref&gt;AU 859.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a royal conference at Ráith Aeda Meic Bric (modern [[Rahugh]], [[County Westmeath]]) with the High King, the kingdom of Cerball was made directly subject to the high king and separated from Munster. Máel Gualae accepted this transfer of authority.&lt;ref&gt;AU 859.3&lt;/ref&gt; That same year Máel Gualae was captured by the Norsemen who stoned him to death&lt;ref&gt;AU 859.4, M 857.8&lt;/ref&gt;

His son [[Dub Lachtna mac Máele Gualae]] (died 895) was also a King of Munster.

'''Nicholas Simon O'Hern''' (born 18 October 1971) is an Australian [[professional golfer]].

O'Hern has played on both of the world's premier [[professional golf tour]]s, the [[European Tour]], and the United States-based [[PGA Tour]]. His biggest successes though, have come at home on the [[PGA Tour of Australasia]], where he won the Order of Merit as the leading money winner in 2006.

==Personal life==
O'Hern was born in [[Perth, Western Australia]]. His father was a three-handicap golfer who played baseball for Australia, and he followed him by playing baseball for Western Australia. He was also a talented tennis player, but he chose to concentrate on golf. In 2009, he was named the Number 1 Ticket Holder for the [[Fremantle Football Club]].

==Career==
O'Hern took up golf at the age of nine and plays left-handed. He turned professional in 1994. He was successful at the European Tour [[qualifying school]] at his first attempt in 1998 and played regularly on the European Tour from 1999 through 2007. He has not won on the European Tour, but had two second-place finishes in 2003, two more in 2004 and one each in 2005, 2006 and 2007.

In 2005, O'Hern began to play quite regularly in the United States. He was not a member of the [[PGA Tour]], but having reached the top twenty of the [[Official World Golf Rankings]], he received a substantial number of invitations and sponsors exemptions for PGA Tour events. In 2006 he became a member of the PGA Tour on the basis of his membership of the International Team at the 2005 [[Presidents Cup]], and has since played mostly on that tour.

Also in 2006, O'Hern won the [[Cadbury Schweppes Australian PGA Championship|Australian PGA Championship]], after he holed out from the greenside bunker for birdie on the fourth hole of a two-man play-off with [[Peter Lonard]]. The win brought to an end a seven-year drought for O'Hern, and propelled him to the top of the PGA Tour of Australasia's Order of Merit for 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/golf/6163993.stm |title=O'Hern ends long wait for victory |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=10 December 2006 |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has won five tournaments in Australia, and continues to play on the PGA Tour of Australasia during the northern hemisphere winter.

O'Hern has featured in the top 20 of the [[Official World Golf Rankings]], and he is the only player who has beaten [[Tiger Woods]] in matchplay more than once. He is coached by Neil Simpson, Peter Thomson and Lewis Freiberg of the Mount Lawley Golf Club in [[Perth, Western Australia]].

Knee surgery ended O'Hern's 2010 season after 11 events. He started the 2011 season on a medical exemption. O'Hern satisfied his medical exemption in May 2011 with four events remaining to retain his PGA Tour status. On 6 June, O'Hern went through sectional qualifying and secured a spot in the [[2011 U.S. Open (golf)|2011 U.S. Open]].

O'Hern has never won on the PGA Tour; his best finish is a tie for second at the 2006 [[Booz Allen Classic]].

===Ball marking===
O'Hern's ball marking has become famous because of its originality. In an ode to his native Australia, O'Hern marks his [[Titleist]] Pro V1 with a drawn-on [[kangaroo]]. The marking has been featured in Titleist advertisements.

{{Video games}}
'''Nonviolent video games''' are [[video game]]s characterized by little or no [[Violence#Violence in the media|violence]]. As the term is vague, game designers, developers, and marketers that describe themselves as non-violent video game makers, as well as certain reviewers and members of the non-violent gaming community, often employ it to describe games with ''comparatively'' little or no violence. The definition has been applied flexibly to games in such purposive genres as the [[Christian video game]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/Beliefs/story?id=1042784&amp;page=1 Christian Video Games Offer Wholesome Action: Game Makers Hope Non-Violent Alternatives Will Catch On]''. [[ABC News|ABC News/Technology]]. 17 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a number of games at the fringe of the "non-violence" label can only be viewed as objectively violent.

The purposes behind the development of the nonviolent genre are primarily reactionary in nature. As video quality and level of gaming technology have increased, the violent nature of some video games has gained worldwide attention from moral, political, gender, and medical/psychological quarters. The popularity of violent video games and increases in youth violence have led to much research into the degree to which video games may be blamed for societally negative behaviors. Despite the inconclusive nature of the scientific results, a number of groups have rejected violent video games as offensive and have promoted the development of non-violent alternatives. The existence of a market for such games has in turn led to the manufacture and distribution of a number of games specifically designed for the nonviolent gaming community. Video game reviewers have additionally identified a number of games belonging to traditionally violent gameplay genres as "nonviolent" in comparison to a typical game from the violent genre. Despite the fact that some of these games contain mild violence, many of them have entered the argot of nonviolent gamers as characteristic non-violent games.

==Video game violence and attendant controversies==
{{Main article|Video game controversy#Crime and violence}}

Controversies surrounding the negative influences of video games are nearly as old as the medium itself. In 1964, [[Marshall McLuhan]], a noted media theorist, suggested in his book, ''[[Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]'', that "[t]he games people play reveal a great deal about them.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall. ''[[Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]''. Signet. 1964. Re-issued 1994. {{ISBN|0-262-63159-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; " This was built upon in the early 1980s in an anti-video-game crusade spearheaded by the former Long Island PTA president, Ronnie Lamm, who spoke about her cause on the [[PBS NewsHour|MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour]] in December 1982.&lt;ref name=gonzalez&gt;Gonzalez, Lauren. ''[http://www.gamespot.com/features/6090892 When Two Tribes Go to War: A History of Video Game Controversy]''. [[GameSpot]] feature. Retrieved 8 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]], [[C. Everett Koop]], had suggested that games had no merit and offered little in the way of anything constructive to young people.&lt;ref name=gonzalez/&gt; Despite early general claims of the negative effects of video games, however, effects of these concerns were relatively minor prior to the early 1990s.

Discussion of the impact of violence in video games came as early as 1976's ''[[Death Race (1976 video game)|Death Race]]'' arcade game (a game with black and white graphics which involved running over screaming zombies).  In the 1980s titles such as Exidy's ''[[Chiller (video game)|Chiller]]'' (1986), Namco's ''[[Splatterhouse]]'' (1987) and Midway's ''[[Narc (video game)|NARC]]'' (1988) raised concerns about video game violence in the arcade. Home games such as [[Palace Software|Palace]]'s ''[[Barbarian (Palace Software)|Barbarian]]'' (1987) featured the ability to decapitate opponents. It was not until graphic capabilities increased and a wave of new ultra-violent titles were released in the early 1990s that the mainstream news began to pay significant attention to the phenomenon. In 1992, with [[Midway Games|Midway]]'s release of the first ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' video game, and then in 1993 with [[id Software|id]]'s ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', genuine controversy was first ignited as the wide and growing popularity of violent video games came into direct conflict with the moral and religious ethics of concerned citizens. Protests and [[List of banned video games|game-bannings]] followed the publicizing of these conflicts, and controversies would erupt periodically throughout the 1990s with the releases of such games as ''[[Dreamweb]]'' (1992), ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'' (1992), ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'' (1993), ''[[Phantasmagoria (video game)|Phantasmagoria]]'' (1995), ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]'' (1996), ''[[Blood (video game)|Blood]]'' (1997), ''[[Grand Theft Auto (video game)|Grand Theft Auto]]'' (1997), ''[[Carmageddon]]'' (1997), ''[[Postal (video game)|Postal]]'' (1997), ''[[Mortal Kombat 3]]'' (1997), ''[[Carmageddon II: Carpocalypse Now]]'' (1998), ''[[Blood II: The Chosen]]'' (1998), ''[[Grand Theft Auto 2]]'' (1999), and ''[[Requiem: Avenging Angel]]'' (1999) among others.

In April 1999, the fears of the media and violence-watch groups were legitimated in their eyes as investigations into the lives of [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]], the shooters in the [[Columbine High School massacre]], revealed that they had been fans of the video game, ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', and had even created [[Doom WAD|levels]] for it today dubbed "the [[Harris levels]]". A great deal of discussion of violence in video games followed this event with strong arguments made on both sides, and research into the phenomenon which had begun during the 1980s received renewed support and interest.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20080422082626/http://mentalhealth.about.com/cs/familyresources/a/vidgameviolence.htm Violent Video Games Produce Violent Behavior]''. [[About.com]] article. 9 November 2005. Retrieved 8 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2001, [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] [[David Satcher]], led a study on violence in youth and determined that while the impact of video games on violent behavior has yet to be determined, "findings suggest that media violence has a relatively small impact on violence," and that "meta-analysis [had demonstrated that] the overall effect size for both randomized and correlational studies was small for physical aggression and moderate for aggressive thinking."&lt;ref name=gonzalez/&gt;

Despite this, the controversies and debate have persisted, and this has been the catalyst for the emergence of the non-violent video game genre. Non-violent video games are defined in the negative by a ''[[Modus tollendo ponens]]'' [[Disjunctive syllogism|disjunctive argument]]. In other words, in order to recognize a non-violent game, an identifier must recognize the violent game as a distinct class. This has led to a degree of ambiguity in the term as it relies upon a definition of [[violence]] which for different identifiers may mean different things. In general, violence may be placed into at least three distinct categories:
*Totally non-violent games – Games in which absolutely no violence occurs. This category contains games characterized by lack of the death of characters, lack of sudden noise or movement, and often lack of traditional conflict. (e.g., ''[[Below the Root (video game)|Below the Root]]'' or ''[[Sudoku Gridmaster]]'')
*Games in which the player acts non-violently – Games where violence occurs to the character-player as a result of environmental hazards or enemies but the character-player's reaction is to run away or otherwise distance himself from the violence.
**Games with environmental hazards only – Games lacking enemies, but containing a potentially violent environment (E.g. ''[[Alleyway (video game)|Alleyway]]'', or ''[[Roller Coaster (video game)|Roller Coaster]]'')
**Games with enemies – Games with violent enemies which the player-character must avoid (E.g. the ''[[Eggerland (series)|Eggerland]]'' series)
*Games in which the player acts non-violently to other sentient beings – Games where a player acts violently against robots or other non-living non-sentient enemies (E.g. ''[[Descent (video game)|Descent]]'')

===Education===
The majority of these games have not been scientifically tested to see whether children learn the skills the games claim to teach.In another study performed in Chile, educational video games were put into some first and second grade classrooms. Children who had the games in their classroom showed more progress in math, reading comprehension, and spelling than the children who did not use games in their classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmch.tv/mentors_teachers/video_games_benefits.asp "Are there any benefits of playing video games" Accessed 13 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
{{Main article|Video game effects}}

The [[history of video games|history of video game development]] shares approximate contemporaneity with [[media violence research]] in general. In the early 1960, studies were conducted on the effects of [[adolescents and cartoon violence|violence in cartoons]],&lt;ref&gt;Mussen, P., &amp; Rutherford, E. (1961). ''Effects of aggressive cartoons on children’s aggressive play''. Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 62, 461–464.&lt;/ref&gt; and throughout the 1970s and 1980s a number of studies were conducted on how televised violence influenced viewers (especially younger viewers). The focus of many of these studies was on the effects of exposure of children to violence, and these studies frequently employed the [[social learning theory]] framework developed by [[Albert Bandura]] to explore violent behavioral modeling.

[[File:David Satcher official photo portrait.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] [[David Satcher]] has conducted research in the field of video game violence and has concluded that "findings suggest that media violence has a relatively small impact on [youth] violence."&lt;ref name=gonzalez/&gt;]]
With advancements in video technology and the rise of video games containing graphic violence in the late 1980s and early 1990s, media violence research shifted to a great degree from televised violence to video game violence. Although under current debate, a number of researchers have claimed that violent games may cause more intense feelings of aggression than nonviolent games, and may trigger feelings of anger and hostility.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, C. A., &amp; Bushman, B. J. (2001). ''Effects of violent games on aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, aggressive affect, physiological arousal, and prosocial behavior: A meta-analytical review of the scientific literature''. Psychological Science, 12, 353–359.&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretical explanations for these types of effects have been explained in myriad theories including social cognitive theory, excitation transfer theory, priming effect and the [[Video game effects#General Aggression Model|General Aggression Model]].  However recent scholarship has suggested that social cognitive theories of aggression are outdated and should be retired.&lt;ref&gt;name=Ferguson &amp; Dyck, 2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=Christopher|title=Paradigm change in aggression research: The time has come to retire the General Aggression Model|journal=Aggression and Violence Behavior|year=2012|issue=17|pages=220–228|url=http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Paradigm%20Change.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927103208/http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Paradigm%20Change.pdf|archivedate=27 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One difference between video games and television which nearly all media violence studies recognize is that video games are primarily interactive while television is primarily passive in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Kirsh, Stephen J. ''Children, Adolescents, and Media Violence – A Critical Look at the Research''. Media Violence and the Concept of Risk. [[SAGE Publications]]. 2006. p. 276. {{ISBN|0-7619-2976-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Video game players identify with the character they control in the video games and there have been suggestions that the interactivity available in violent video games narrows the gap between the theory and practice of youth violence in a manner that goes beyond the effects of televised violence.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, Kelly Stephen. ''[http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-1107102-220029/unrestricted/Meyers_dis.pdf Television and Video Game Violence: Age Differences and the Combined Effects of Passive and Interactive Violent Media]''. Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College – Department of Psychology. December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, Patricia Marks and Cocking, Rodney R. ''Interacting with video: Volume 11 of Advances in applied developmental psychology''. Greenwood Publishing Group. 1996. {{ISBN|1-56750-152-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acknowledgment of the fact that, for better or worse, video games are likely to remain a part of modern society has led to a brace of comparative studies between violent games and non-violent games.&lt;ref name=cooper&gt;Cooper, J., &amp; Mackie, D. (1986). ''Video games and aggression in children''. Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 16(8), 726–744.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tamborini, R., Eastin, M. S., Skalski, P., Lachlan, K., Fediuk, T. A., &amp; Brady, R. (2004). ''Violent virtual video games and hostile thoughts''. Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media, 48(3), 335–357.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=polman&gt;Polman, H., de Castro, B. O., &amp; van Aken, M. A. G. (2008). ''Experimental study of the differential effects of playing versus watching violent video games on children’s aggressive behavior''. Aggressive Behavior, 34(3), 256–264.&lt;/ref&gt; As technology has advanced, such studies have adapted to include the effects of violent games and non-violent games in new media methods such as immersive virtual reality simulations.&lt;ref&gt;Arriaga, P., Esteves, F., Caneiro, P., &amp; Monteiro, M. B. (2008). ''Are the effects of unreal violent video games pronounced when playing with a virtual reality system?'' Aggressive Behavior, 34(5), 521–538.&lt;/ref&gt;

Results have varied, with some research indicating correlation between violence in video games and violence in players of the games, and other research indicating minimal if any relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Craig &amp; Dill, Karen. ''Video Games and Aggressive Thoughts, Feelings, and Behavior in the Laboratory and in Life''. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, April 2000 Vol. 78, No. 4, 772–790.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silvern, S. B., &amp; Williamson, P. A. (1987). The effects of video game play on young children’s aggression, fantasy, and prosocial behavior. Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, 8(4), 453–462.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the lack of solid conclusion on the issue, the suggestion that violent games cause youth violence together with the clear popularity of violent video game genres such as the [[first-person shooter]] have led some game designers to publish non-violent alternatives.&lt;ref name=dobson&gt;Dobson, Jason. ''[http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=9161 ACE, Christian Developers Conference Focuses On Responsible Game Development]''.

GameZone. 28 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawsuits and legislation===
As research supporting the view that video game violence leads to youth violence has been produced, there have been a number of lawsuits initiated by victims to gain compensation for loss alleged to have been caused by video-game-related violence. Similarly, in the [[United States Congress|US Congress]] and the legislatures of states and other countries, a number of legislative actions have been taken to mandate rating systems and to curb the distribution of violent video games. At times, individual games considered too violent have been censored or banned in such countries as [[Censorship in Australia#Video games|Australia]], [[Law 3037/2002|Greece]], [[List of banned video games|etc.]]

Christian Science Monitor. 19 October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Activism|activist]] and (now former) attorney [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]] brought suit against [[Atari]], [[Nintendo]], [[Sega]], and [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] on behalf of the victims of [[Heath High School shooting]] in ''[[Heath High School shooting|James v. Meow Media]]''. The suit was dismissed in 2000, absolving the companies of responsibility for the shooter's actions based on a lack of remedy under Kentucky [[tort]] law.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.freedomforum.org/templates/document.asp?documentID=16730 Federal appeals panel upholds dismissal of lawsuit against movie, video game makers]''. [[Associated Press]]. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals]] upheld the dismissal, and in 2003, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] denied [[certiorari]], refusing to review the case because it was not dismissed on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|1st Amendment]] grounds.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.freedomforum.org/templates/document.asp?documentID=17477 High court won't revive suit blaming Hollywood for school shooting]''. [[Associated Press]]. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the County Council for St. Louis, Missouri enacted Ordinance 20,193 that barred minors from purchasing, renting, or playing violent video games deemed to contain any visual depiction or representation of realistic injury to a human or a "human-like being" that appealed to minors' "morbid interest in violence."&lt;ref name=krug&gt;Krug, Judith F. &amp; Caldwell-Stone, Deborah. ''[http://www.mediainstitute.org/ONLINE/FAM2003/6-a.html Controversial Ruling Finds Video Games Not Protected Speech]''. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; This ordinance was challenged in 2001 by the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA) as violative of freedom of expression as guaranteed by the first amendment. The IDSA cited the 7th Circuit case of ''American Amusement Machine Association v. Kendrick''&lt;ref&gt;''American Amusement Machine Association v. Kendrick'', 244 F.3d 572 (7th Cir. 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; as precedent suggesting that video game content was a form of freedom of expression, however in 2002 the Eastern District Court of Missouri ultimately issued the controversial ruling that "video games are not a form of expression protected by the First Amendment" in ''Interactive Digital Software Association v. St. Louis County''.&lt;ref&gt;''Interactive Digital Software Association v. St. Louis County'', 200 F. Supp. 2d 1126 (E.D. Mo. 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[Columbine High School massacre]], a $5 billion lawsuit was filed in 2001 against a number of video game companies and [[id Software]], the makers of the purportedly violent video game, ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' by victims of the tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.freedomforum.org/templates/document.asp?documentID=13762 Federal suit blames video-game makers for Columbine shooting]''.

The suit was dismissed by Judge Babcock in March 2002 in a ruling suggesting that a decision against the game makers would have a chilling effect on free speech. Babcock noted that "it is manifest that there is social utility in expressive and imaginative forms of entertainment, even if they contain violence."&lt;ref name=AP1/&gt;

In 2003, Washington State enacted a statute banning the sale or rental to minors of video games&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Chris. ''[http://money.cnn.com/2003/05/20/technology/gaminglaw Wash. bans 'violent' game sales]''. CNN/Money. 21 May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; containing "aggressive conflict in which the player kill, injures, or otherwise causes physical harm to a human form in the game who is depicted by dress or other recognizable symbols as a public law enforcement officer." In 2004, this statute was subsequently declared an unconstitutional violation of the first amendment right to free speech in the Federal District Court case of ''Video Software Dealers Ass'n v. Maleng''.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Irwin. ''Case-in-Point''. Legal Television Network. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Jack Thompson brought suit against [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] and ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' in representation of the victims of the [[Devin Moore (murderer)|Devin Moore]] shooting incident. On 7 November 2005, Thompson withdrew from ''[[Strickland v. Sony]]'', stating, "It was my idea [to leave the case]." He was quick to mention that the case would probably do well with or without his presence. This decision followed scrutiny from Judge James Moore, however Thompson claimed he received no pressure to withdraw. At the same time, Judge James Moore had taken the motion to revoke Thompson's license under advisement. Jack Thompson appeared in court to defend his ''[[pro hac vice]]'' right to practice law in Alabama, following accusations that he violated legal ethics.&lt;ref&gt;DeWitt, Robert.

In 2005, California State Senator, [[Leland Yee]] introduced [[California Assembly Bills 1792 &amp; 1793]] which barred ultra-violent video games and mandated the application of [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]] ratings for video games. Yee, a former [[Developmental psychology|child psychologist]] has [[Leland Yee#Video game controversies|publicly criticized]] such games as ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' and ''[[Manhunt 2]]'', and opposes the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]'s ''Global Gaming League''. Both of these bills were passed by the assembly and signed by Gov. [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] in October 2005. By December 2005, both bills had been struck down in court by Judge Ronald Whyte as unconstitutional, thereby preventing either from going into effect on 1 January 2006. Similar bills were subsequently filed in such states as Michigan and Illinois, but to date all have been ruled to be unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;Byrd, Patrick R.

Houston Law Review&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, in reaction to such controversial games as ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'', Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] along with Senators [[Joe Lieberman]] and [[Evan Bayh]], introduced the [[Family Entertainment Protection Act]] (S.2126), intended to protect children from inappropriate content found in video games by imposing a federal mandate for inclusion of [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]] ratings.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4682533.stm Clinton wades into GTA sex storm]''.

In June 2006, the Louisiana case of ''[[Entertainment Software Association v. Foti]]'' struck down a state statute that sought to bar minors from purchasing video games with violent content. The statute was declared an unconstitutional violation of the 1st Amendment. Amici filing briefs included [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]].

On 27 September 2006, Senator [[Sam Brownback]] (R-KS) introduced the United States [[Truth in Video Game Rating Act]] (S.3935). The act would require the ESRB to have access to the full content of and hands-on time with the games it was to rate, rather than simply relying on the video demonstrations submitted by developers and publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senate Proposes New ESRB Legislation|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=11030|work = [[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=9 October 2008}} 27 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, Congressman [[Fred Upton]] introduced the [[Video Game Decency Act]] (H.R.6120) to the House.

===Degrees of violence===
{{Main article|Video game content rating system}}

Video game rating boards exist in a number of countries, typically placing restrictions (suggested or under force of law) for content that is violent or sexual in nature. About 5% of games fall into a category rated "mature" and recommended to those 17 years old and older. Those games account for about a quarter of all video game sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2011-06-27-supreme-court-violent-video-games_n.htm | work=USA Today | first1=Joan | last1=Biskupic | first2=Mike | last2=Snider | title=Supreme Court rejects ban on violent video games | date=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gamers seeking violence find themselves increasingly age restricted as identified violence level increases. This means that non-violent games, which are the least restricted, are available to all players at any age. This moral or legislative public policy against violence has the indirect effect of encouraging players of all ages and especially younger players to play non-violent games, however it also produces something of a [[forbidden fruit]] effect. For this and other reasons, the effectiveness of rating systems such as the ESRB to actually curb violent gameplay in youth gaming has been characterized as futile.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. David Walsh (21 March 2000).

[http://www.iccr.org/news/press_releases/pdf%20files/Nasharticle071305.PDF VVG's – Violent Video Games – Are Your Students Tuned In To A VVG World?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029233757/http://www.iccr.org/news/press_releases/pdf%20files/Nasharticle071305.PDF |date=29 October 2008 }}''. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; however no firm conclusions have been achieved to date. The number of studies in this field has blossomed contemporaneously with greater [[gender studies]], and a degree of tension exists in the field between the traditional stereotype of violence as a male-dominant characteristic and the realities of the marketing data for violent games.

In 2008, an example of such studies was funded by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, U.S. Department of Justice to the Center for Mental Health and Media.&lt;ref&gt;Olson CK, Kutner LA, Warner DE, Almerigi JB, Baer L, Nicholi AM Jr, &amp; Beresin EV: ''Factors correlated with violent video game use by adolescent boys and girls''. Journal of Adolescent Health, 2007, 41: 77–83&lt;/ref&gt; These studies were released in the book, ''[[Grand Theft Childhood]]'', wherein it was found that among girls, nine of the "top ten [most popular video games] were nonviolent games such as ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'' titles, ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'' or [[Game (simulation)|simulation game]]s" compared to a majority of violent games in the top ten favorites of boys.&lt;ref&gt;Kutner, Lawrence, Ph.D. and Olson, Cheryl K., Sc.D. ''[[Grand Theft Childhood|Grand Theft Childhood: The Surprising Truth About Violent Video Games and What Parents Can Do]]''. [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]. 15 April 2008. {{ISBN|0-7432-9951-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the conclusion reached in ''Grand Theft Childhood'' was that "focusing on such easy but minor targets as violent video games causes parents, social activists and public-policy makers to ignore the much more powerful and significant causes of youth violence that have already been well established, including a range of [non-gender-linked] social, behavioral, economic, biological and mental-health factors."&lt;ref&gt;Kutner, Lawrence, Ph.D. and Olson, Cheryl K., Sc.D. ''[[Grand Theft Childhood|Grand Theft Childhood: The Surprising Truth About Violent Video Games and What Parents Can Do]]''. [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]. 15 April 2008. {{ISBN|0-7432-9951-5}}. p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; This conclusion supports [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] [[David Satcher|Satcher]]'s 2001 study (''supra'').&lt;ref name=gonzalez/&gt;

Despite this conclusion, general awareness of the issue together with traditional stereotyping has led a number of game developers and designers to create non-violent video games specifically for [[girl gamer|female audiences]]. Advertisement placement and other marketing techniques have in the past targeted women as more receptive to non-violent video game genres such as [[life simulation game]]s, [[strategy game]]s, or [[puzzle video game]]s. Although these genres often contain certain degrees of violence, they lack the emphasis on graphic violence characterized for instance by the [[first-person shooter]] genre.

==Religious perspective==
Criticism for the violent aspects of video game culture has come from a number of anti-violence groups, and perhaps the most vocal of these are the numerous religious opposition groups. The moral codes of nearly all major religions contain prohibitions against murder and violence in general. In some cases this prohibition even extends to aggression, wrath, and anger. Violent video games, while merely vicarious in nature, have been the focus of religious disapproval or outrage in various circles.&lt;ref name=nash/&gt; Notable anti-violent-video-game crusader, former attorney [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]] is a self proclaimed [[Christian right|Christian conservative]],&lt;ref name=provenzo/&gt; and his legal actions against violent video games have been intimately linked to his religious views. As groups like the [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christian]] population have increased in number of adherents, new marketing opportunities have developed contemporaneously.&lt;ref name=davis&gt;Davis, Matthew. ''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4534835.stm Christians purge video game demons]''. BBC News – Washington. 24 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Several religion-centric games forums such as [[GameSpot]]'s [[GameSpot#Forums|"Religion and Philosophy" forum]] have developed within the greater gaming community in reaction to this growing niche.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gamespot.com/pages/unions/forums/show_topics.php?board_id=909179086&amp;union_id=7382 Religion and Philosophy]''.

===Christian games===
{{Main article|Christian video game}}
There has been a rapid increase in [[Christian video game]]s in the last decade,&lt;ref name=davis/&gt; however as Christian games have striven to compete with their more popular secular progenitors, there has been an increasing number of games released that blur the lines between Christian and non-Christian values.&lt;ref&gt;Hutson, Jonathan. ''[http://www.talk2action.org/story/2006/5/29/195855/959 The Purpose Driven Life Takers (Part 1)]''. Talk to Action. 29 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Jack Thompson, for instance, has publicly decried such Christian games as ''[[Left Behind: Eternal Forces]]'', stating "It's absurd, ... you can be the Christians blowing away the infidels, and if that doesn't hit your hot button, you can be the Antichrist blowing away all the Christians."&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;Chmielewski, Dawn C. ''[http://articles.latimes.com/2006/may/10/business/fi-godgames10/2 Converting Video Games Into Instruments of God]'' LA Times. 10 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; (The game reviewers [[IGN]], [[Ars Technica]] and [[GameSpy]] have disagreed that "Left Behind: Eternal Forces" is overtly violent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pc.ign.com/articles/745/745956p1.html IGN: Left Behind: Eternal Forces Review]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/reviews/2006/12/leftbehind.ars Ars Technica: Left Behind: Eternal Forces]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/left-behind-eternal-forces/749748p1.html GameSpy: Left Behind: Eternal Forces Review]&lt;/ref&gt;) Similarly, James Dobson, PhD., founder of the [[Focus on the Family]] group, has advised parents in relation to video games to "avoid the violent ones altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Dobson, James. Dr. ''[http://www.uexpress.com/focusonthefamily/index.html?uc_full_date=20041010 Teen's Hard Times Can Help Build Character]''. 10 October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Super 3D Noah's Ark.png|frame|In the [[Christian video game]], ''[[Super 3D Noah's Ark]]'', the player takes the role of [[Noah]] as he non-violently shoots food with a slingshot in order to sate hordes of ravening animals.]]
Although Christian games have been around since [[Sparrow Records]]' ''[[Music Machine (album series)#Spin-offs|Music Machine]]'' for the [[Atari 2600]], there have been few genres as unassailably violent as that of the [[first-person shooter]] (FPS). The majority of games that have been [[List of banned video games|banned]] for violence have been FPS games, and for this reason, Christian games in the FPS genre have struggled to overcome the blurring effects of the violence inherent to the genre. Games such as ''[[Revelation 7 (video game)|Revelation 7]]'' and ''[[Xibalba (video game)|Xibalba]]'', for instance, have attempted to avoid claims of violence by using "off the wall" [[absurdism|absurdist]] humor with enemies such as flying, bat-winged clown heads (modeled after the biblical [[Jezebel (Bible)|Jezebel]]) that shoot rays out of their nose, or alien Nazis (a mocking reference to [[Raëlism|Raëlian]] religious beliefs)&lt;ref name=linder&gt;Linder, Matthew. ''Marty Bee Interview''. Gamepraise.net (also available at Objectiveministries.org). 1 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Christian FPS games such as ''[[Eternal War]]'' have avoided the issue by expressing the view that justified violence is morally acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twoguyssoftware.ca/ Xrucifix]. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these games, despite containing objectively violent content, have been affirmatively labeled "non-violent video games" by marketers and faith-based non-violent gaming communities. In direct response to the [[Columbine High School massacre]] (alleged to have been caused by the shooters' obsession with the game, ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]''), Rev. Ralph Bagley began production on ''[[Catechumen (video game)|Catechumen]]'', a Christian first-person game produced by N'Lightening Software involving holy swords instead of guns.&lt;ref&gt;Dee, Jonathan. ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/01/magazine/01GAMES.html PlayStations of the Cross]''. New York Times. 1 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Catechumen'', the player fights inhuman demons using holy armament. When "sent back" the demons produce no blood or gore, and for this reason it has been described as a non-violent game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/disneys-atlantis-the-lost-empire Metacritic Game Review]&lt;/ref&gt; The intent of ''Catechumen'', according to Rev. Bagley, is "to build the genre of Christian gaming. People are tired of having these violent, demonic games dictating to their kids."&lt;ref name=davis/&gt; Among Christian FPS games, a lack of gore has often been used as the minimum standard for non-violence. Christian game reviewers have at times characterized non-Christian games such as ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'' and ''[[Narbacular Drop]]'' as comparatively non-violent games despite their lack of a Christian focus.

An example of a notable Christian video game organization is the Christian Game Developers Foundation, focusing on [[Family-friendliness|family-friendly]] gameplay and Biblical principles. Another well known Christian video game creator and distributor is [[Wisdom Tree]] which is best known for its unlicensed Christian video games on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].

===Hindu games===
In 2006, Escapist magazine reported that a Hindu first-person shooter entitled ''My Hindu Shooter'' was in the works.&lt;ref&gt;Varney, Allen. ''[http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_66/385-My-Hindu-Shooter My Hindu Shooter]''. 10 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''My Hindu Shooter'', a game based on the [[Unreal Engine]], the player employs the [[Vedas|Vedic]] abilities of [[Jyotiṣa|astrology]], [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic healing]], breathing (meditation), [[herbalism]], [[Gandharva Kingdom#Gandharva Chitrasena|Gandharva Veda music]], architecture (which let you purify demonic areas) and [[Yajna|yagyas]] (rituals). Gameplay involved acquisition of the [[siddhi]]s of clairvoyance, levitation, invisibility, shrinking and strength, and the ultimate goal of the game was to achieve pure consciousness by removing [[karma]] through completion of quests and cleansing the six [[chakra]]s in ascending order.&lt;ref&gt;Kietzmann, Ludwig.

===Buddhist games===
According to Buddhist morality, the first of the [[Five Precepts]] of [[Śīla]] is a personal rule of not killing. This moral guideline extends to human as well as non-human life. 
There are five conditions to violate the first precept:
# The being must be alive. 
# There must be the knowledge that it is a sentient living being. 
# There must be an intention to cause death. 
# An act must be done to cause death. 
# There must be death, as the result of the said act.

{{Original research|section|date=July 2014}}As the first precept requires an actual living being to be killed to be considered as violated, Buddhists can still enjoy video games with violence because there is no real being that is dying or being hurt. The fuller extent of the first precept is to maintain a harmless attitude towards all. The main problem is the mind, which is the main focus of Buddhism. Violent video games tend to create ill-will and tension, thus it is not conducive for meditation practice. Other than that, the action of the mind also creates ''kamma'' (action) which will bear its fruit when the conditions are right.

Although primarily [[browser game]]s, a number of stand-alone video games eschewing violence, such as the 2007 Thai game ''Ethics Game'' have been created that promote the Five Precepts and Buddhism generally.&lt;ref&gt;Sherriff, Lucy.

Despite notoriety in the Western press for controversial violent games such as ''[[Under Ash]]'', and ''[[Under Siege (2005 video game)|Under Siege]]'', Muslim developer Afkar Media has also produced at least one non-violent game entitled ''Road Block Buster''. In ''Road Block Buster'' the hero must "jump[] around [] doing tricks to soldiers ...

==Types of non-violent video games==
Non-violent video games as a genre are characterized as a [[Video game genres#Video game genres by purpose|genre by purpose]]. Unlike genres described by style of gameplay, non-violent video games span a wide number of gameplay genres. Defined in the negative, the purpose of non-violent games is to provide the player with an experience that ''lacks'' violence. Many traditional gameplay genres naturally lack violence and application of the term "non-violent video games" to titles that fall under these categories raises no questions regarding accuracy. For game developers and designers who self-identify as non-violent video game makers, however, the challenge has been to expand the concepts of non-violence into such traditionally violent gameplay genres as [[action game]]s, [[role-playing game (video games)|role-playing games]], [[strategy game]]s, and the [[first-person shooter]].&lt;ref name=linder/&gt;

[[Video game genres#Other notable genres|Emergent and more recent gameplay genres]] such as [[music video game]]s are for the most part naturally non-violent. [[Video game genres#Video game genres by purpose|Purposive video game genres]] such as [[educational game]]s also are primarily non-violent in nature. Other electronic game genres like [[audio game]]s are also most frequently non-violent. The indisputably non-violent nature of these games are often considered self-evident by members of both the non-violent gaming community and the gaming community at large. As such they are often not explicitly identified as such. Typically, explicit identification is applied counterintuitively to titles where there might otherwise be a question concerning non-violence. This has led such categorization to be viewed with mistrust, hostility, and mockery&lt;ref name=brown&gt;Brown, Seth. ''[http://www.cracked.com/article_15672_praystation-6-most-misguided-christian-video-games.html PrayStation: The 6 Most Misguided Christian Video]''. [[Cracked.com]]. August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; by those who fail to recognize the comparative nature of the definition or who disagree fundamentally with the underlying purpose of the genre.

===Traditionally non-violent games===
[[File:KMines.png|thumb|Games like ''[[Minesweeper (video game)|Minesweeper]]'' contain traditionally non-violent [[Puzzle video game|puzzle game]] aspects, though minesweeper takes its name from a facet of war.]]
Among traditionally non-violent games are included [[List of maze video games|maze games]], [[adventure game]]s, [[life simulation game]]s, [[construction and management simulation]] games, and some [[vehicle simulation game]]s among others. These games are generally less frequently described as non-violent due to the self-evident nature of the descriptive term. Prior to the development of games specifically designed for non-violence, non-violent gamers were limited to these traditionally non-violent genres, however a number of games even under the traditionally non-violent umbrella may be considered arguably violent. ''[[Minesweeper (computer game)|Minesweeper]]'', for instance, is an abstraction of a scenario that often leads to a patently violent result.

Other common traditionally non-violent genres include [[adventure game]]s, [[Puzzle video game|puzzle game]]s, [[music video game]]s, [[programming game]]s, [[Party video game|party games]], and traditional games.

Examples of traditionally non-violent games include:
*''[[Sudoku Gridmaster]]'' – A totally non-violent game wherein the player must assign the mathematically appropriate number to the corresponding blank in a grid.
*''[[Roller Coaster (video game)|Roller Coaster]]'' – A game featuring a non-violent main-character wherein the player must navigate a dangerous amusement park to collect pieces of money.
*''[[Alleyway (video game)|Alleyway]]'' – A game with only environmental hazards featuring a non-violent main-character wherein the player must break blocks (mild violence) with a ball while avoiding the floor of the level.
*The ''[[Eggerland (series)|Eggerland]]'' series – A series with enemies featuring a non-violent main-character wherein the player must solve block-sliding puzzles in order to secure a key and unlock the door to the next room.
*''[[Robots (1984 video game)|Robots]]'' – A game lacking violence to sentient beings wherein a player must either bomb malfunctioning robots or conserve bombs by stepping strategically in order to induce the robots to crash into one another.

===Non-violent action games===
[[File:Seiklus.jpg|thumb|''[[Seiklus]]'' is a [[platform game|platformer]] that lacks much of the violence traditionally associated with platformers.]]
Action games have typically been among the most violent of video games genres with the liberal employment of enemies to thwart the actions of the player-character, and an emphasis on killing these enemies to neutralize them. As action games have developed they have become progressively more violent over the years as advances in graphic capabilities allowed for more realistic enemies and death sequences. Nevertheless, some companies like [[Nintendo]] have tended to shy away from this kind of realism in favor of cartoon and fantasy violence, a concept also implicated in the increase of youth violence by [[media violence research]]ers. This has created a spectrum of violence in action games. Non-violent video game proponents have labeled a number of games containing comparatively low-level violence as non-violent as well as games such as the anti-violent [[serious game]], ''[[Food Force]]''.

Studies have also shown that there are tangible benefits to violence in action games such as increased ability to process visual information quickly and accurately. This has led to support for the development of action games that are non-violent which will allow players to retain the positive visual processing benefits without the negatives associated with violence.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, Mark.

====Non-violent first person shooters====
The application of the term "non-violent" to genres such as the [[first-person shooter]] (FPS), that many players consider ''inherently'' or ''definitionally'' violent, has at times generated vociferous arguments that the concept is inconceivable and at best oxymoronic. This argument typically derives from a strict definition of violence as "extreme, destructive, or uncontrollable force especially of natural events; intensity of feeling or expression,&lt;ref&gt;''violence''. Encarta. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; " a definition by which the vast majority of video games may be described as violent. Despite arguments to the contrary, however, such characterizations have been employed as a marketing tool by makers and distributors of non-violent video games, and the degree of popularity enjoyed by games so described may be attributed to the comparative violence of other more violent members of the supergenre.

Non-violent first-person shooter developers have expressed the notion that it is the challenge of making a non-violent game in a violent genre that motivates them in part.&lt;ref name=linder/&gt; Rarely, FPS games such as ''[[Garry's Mod]]'' and ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'' that have been developed without the specific intent of non-violence have been identified by reviewers and the non-violent gaming community as non-violent FPSes.&lt;ref name=gigaom&gt;Au, Wagner James.

V.17 No.21. 22–28 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Such characterizations have led to the concern that parents may allow their children to play these games, not realizing that there are still some elements of violence including violent deaths. Further ambiguities arise when determining whether a game is a first-person ''shooter'', as in certain games such as ''[[Narbacular Drop]]'', the player doesn't shoot anything at all, but merely clicks walls with the cursor. Similarly, in games such as ''[[Myst#Remakes and rereleases|realMyst]]'', the player merely interacts with the environment by touching things in the first-person and the term "shooter" is seen to be objectively inaccurate. Despite this, non-violent first-person games have often been characterized oxymoronically as shooters because of all comparable genres, these games are most closely similar to the FPS and often employ engines designed for the FPS genre.

Often modeled upon violent FPS games, non-violent FPSes such as ''[[Chex Quest]]'' or the newer Sherlock Holmes games, may bear striking resemblance to the violent game whose engine they are using. Developers of such games often have done little to change the game other than replacing violent or scary imagery and recasting the storyline to describe "zorching", "slobbing", or otherwise non-lethally incapacitating enemies. Examples of simple changes intended to reduce violence for non-violent FPSes include the alteration of the red shroud from the death-sequence in ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' to become the green shroud from the slime-sequence in ''Chex Quest'' or the removal of the red shroud from the death-sequence in ''[[Half-Life 2]]'' for the deaths in ''Portal''. At times, similarities between violent progenitors and their non-violent descendants have proved strong enough that the non-violent developers have cast their game as a spoof of the violent version. This is apparent in ''Chex Quest''. Off-beat and absurdist humor have been employed in a number of games order to tone down the serious content by makers of non-violent FPSes.&lt;ref name=linder/&gt;

One subgenre of the FPS that typically is not characterized as non-violent despite the fact that gameplay revolves to a great degree around avoidance of battle, is that of [[stealth game]]s. Although much of the gameplay characteristic to stealth games accords closely with the requirements of the non-violent genre, stealth games most frequently simply delay chaotic violence to focus instead upon controlled precision violence.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} When stealth and violence are both present as options, stealth is often presented as the superior option for being morally superior or requiring greater skill.&lt;ref name="kotakuDishonoredParty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/dishonoreds-party-level-rewrote-the-rules-of-stealth-ga-1613011624|last=Burford|first=GB|work=Kotaku|title=Dishonored's Party Level Rewrote The Rules Of Stealth Games|date=July 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-violent role-playing games===
[[File:Spritual warfare.PNG|frame|The [[Christian video game|Christian RPG]], ''[[Spiritual Warfare (video game)|Spiritual Warfare]]'', features a non-violent hero who spreads repentance by sharing holy fruit]]
Though infrequently regarded as explicitly violent, role-playing video games (RPGs) have traditionally focused on the adventures of a party of travelers as they spend days and months leveling-up to fight greater and greater foes. Fighting in these games is highly stylized and often turn-based, however the actions of the player-characters and the enemies that attack them are distinctly violent. There have been some attempts made to reduce this violence by rendering it in cartoonish format as in some members of the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series{{Citation needed|date = July 2009}} or by recasting the enemies' deaths as "fainting," "sleeping," or becoming "stunned" as in the ''[[Pokémon (video game series)|Pokémon]]'' series, however neither of these series has been explicitly labeled non-violent.

One rare example of an RPG that was designed as a non-violent video game is ''[[Spiritual Warfare (video game)|Spiritual Warfare]]'', a game with enemies featuring a non-violent main-character wherein the player wanders about converting the denizens of his town to Christianity while fending off the attacks of wild animals with holy food. Another example is ''[[A Tale in the Desert]]'', an [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] based on economic development.

Secular examples include Capcom's ''[[Ace Attorney]]'' series&lt;ref&gt;Landis, Shawn. ''Capcom's Ace Attorney Video Game''. 24 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Savino, Candace. ''[http://www.joystiq.com/2008/02/28/ds-fanboy-review-apollo-justice-ace-attorney DS Fanboy Review: Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney]''. 28 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Victor Interactive Software|Victor]]'s ''[[Story of Seasons (series)|Story of Seasons]]'' series&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.nowar-paix.ca/goodvideogames/index.html Recommended Nonviolent Video Games]''. NoWar list.&lt;/ref&gt; – a simulation/RPG game. Additionally, such RPGs as  ''[[Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar]]'', ''[[Planescape: Torment]]'', and ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]'' have all been identified as containing certain modes of play that are mostly non-violent. This concept is also explored in the higher difficulty levels of the [[Thief (series)|''Thief'' series]].

In 2015 the fan-funded indie RPG ''[[Undertale]]'' allowed players to choose whether or not to use violent methods, in a story that includes both explicit and subtextual commentary on the nature of violence in videogames.

===Non-violent strategy games===
As with role-playing games, strategy games have traditionally focused on the development and expansion of a group as they defend themselves from the attacks of enemies. Strategy games tend not to be explicitly described as violent, however they nearly universally contain violent content in the form of battles, wars, and other skirmishes. Additionally, strategy games tend to more often strive for realistic scenarios and depictions of the battles that result. Counteracting this violence, however, is the fact that strategy games tend to be set at a distant third party perspective and as such the violence of the battles tends to be minute and highly stylized.

For the most part, non-violent groups have not explored this genre of violent game. Gender-marketers have designed strategy games for both male and female audiences, however gender-linked treatment of violence has not occurred in this genre and as such, male- and female-oriented strategy games tend to contain equal degrees of violence. Christian developers have made various attempts at the genre including ''[[Left Behind: Eternal Forces]]'' in which the player attempts to convert as many civilians in an apocalyptic future as possible by raising their spirit level and shielding them from the corrupting influences of rock-and-roll music and general secularism. The game has been criticized by such anti-violent video game personalities as former attorney [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]]&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; for strategy involving the slaying of infidels and non-believers, and for the ability of players engaged in multi-play modes to play as the Antichrist on the side of the Forces of Satan.

Secular non-violent video game designers have emerged from the [[serious game]]s movement and include such anti-violence titles as ''[[PeaceMaker (computer game)|PeaceMaker]]'', a game where the player tries to foster peace between Israelis and Palestinians, and ''[[A Force More Powerful]]'', a nonviolence-themed game designed by [[Steve York]], a documentary filmmaker  and director of Bringing Down a Dictator, a non violent resistance film featuring Ivan Marovic, a resistance leader against [[Slobodan Milošević]] who was instrumental in bringing him down in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Troeh, Eve. ''[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5342543 Video Game Teaches Non-Violent Solutions]''. [[National Public Radio]]. 14 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krotoski, Aleks. ''[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2006/may/08/seriousgamere Serious game: resolving conflict with non-violent means]''. The Guardian. 8 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Though these games are anti-violent, however, failure on the part of the player leads to violence. Thus the goal of the game is merely shifted to active violence-prevention while the degree of violence used to challenge the player remains consistent with violent strategy games.

Some examples of relatively nonviolent strategy games include:
*''[[M.U.L.E.]]''&lt;ref name="anderson198312"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v9n12/114_MULE.php | title=M.U.L.E | accessdate=March 17, 2011 | author=Anderson, John J. | date=December 1983 | publisher=Creative Computing | pages=114 | quote=I should also mention that there is no shooting to be found anywhere in the game.

===Non-violent sports games and non-violent vehicle simulations===
{{Expand section|date=October 2008}}
According to the Funk and Buchman method for [[Game classification#Electronic games|classifying video games]], there are six categories into which games may be divided:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Children, Adolescents and the Media|author=[[Victor C. Strasburger]] and Barbara J. Wilson|pages=122–123|year=2002|publisher=Sage Publications|isbn=0-7619-2125-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#general entertainment (no fighting or destruction)
#educational (learning or problem solving)
#fantasy violence (cartoon characters that must fight or destroy things, and risk being killed, in order to achieve a goal)
#human violence (like fantasy violence, but with human rather than cartoon characters)
#nonviolent sports (no fighting or destruction)
#sports violence (fighting or destruction involved)

The separation of violent and nonviolent sports here illustrates a phenomenon also recognizable in the [[vehicle simulation game]] genre. With both sport and vehicle simulation games, gameplay has traditionally been highly bipolar with nearly as many violent titles as non-violent. Just as there are non-violent and ''violent'' sports games, so too are there [[flight simulator|flight]] and [[combat flight simulator|''combat'' flight simulators]], [[Space simulator|space flight]] and [[Space flight simulator game|space ''combat'' simulators]], and [[Racing video game|racing game]]s and [[vehicular combat game|vehicular ''combat'' games]]. Distinction of games as violent or non-violent here serves a purely practical purpose as gameplay may differ considerably beyond the merely aesthetic.

Such sports as [[Table tennis|Ping-pong]], [[golf]], and [[Cue sports|billiards]], have in the past been identified as nonviolent.&lt;ref&gt;Sargent, Martin. ''[http://www.g4tv.com/techtvvault/features/37171/Twisted_List_Top_Nonviolent_Sports_Games.html Twisted List: Top Nonviolent Sports Games]''. G4TV TechTV Vault. 16 April 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; A common example of a nonviolent game that has been employed in a number of studies and government committee reports is ''[[NBA Jam: Tournament Edition]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kirsh, S. J. (1998). ''Seeing the world through Mortal Kombat-colored glasses: violent video games and the development of a short-term hostile attribution bias''. Childhood, 5 (2), 177–184.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, Joanne. ''[https://www.webcitation.org/5s52ruFm4?url=http://yourmindonmedia.com/downloads/media_violence_paper.pdf The Psychological Effects of Media Violence on Children and Adolescents]''. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirsh.

'''''Passage''''' is a [[science fiction]] novel by [[Connie Willis]], published in 2001. The novel won the [[Locus Award]] for Best Novel in 2002,&lt;ref name="WWE-2002"&gt;{{cite web

''Passage'' follows the efforts of Joanna Lander, a research psychologist, to understand the phenomenon of [[near-death experience]]s (or NDEs) by interviewing hospital patients after they are revived following [[clinical death]]. Her work with Dr. Richard Wright, a neurologist who has discovered a way to chemically induce an artificial NDE and conduct an "RIPT" [[Neuroimaging|brain scan]] during the experience, leads her to the discovery of the biological purpose of NDEs. 

Science fiction scholar [[Gary K. Wolfe]] writes, "Willis tries something truly astonishing: without resorting to supernaturalism on the one hand or clinical reportage on the other, without forgoing her central metaphor, she seeks to lift the veil on what actually happens inside a dying mind."&lt;ref name= "Wolfe"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Wolfe |first= Gary K. |authorlink= Gary K. Wolfe |date= March 2001 |title= ''Passage'' |journal= [[Locus (magazine)|Locus]] |volume= 46 |issue=482, number 3 |page= 23 |location= [[Oakland, California]] |publisher= [[Charles N. Brown]] |issn= 0047-4959&lt;!-- |accessdate= October 12, 2012--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through Lander's work, Dr. Wright is able to develop a medicine that brings patients back from clinical death.

The novel contains enlightening discussions of various disasters, including the ''[[RMS Titanic]]'', the [[Hartford circus fire]], the [[Hindenburg disaster]], the [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79]], the [[1883 eruption of Krakatoa]], the [[Boston Molasses Disaster]], and, almost as prominently as the ''Titanic'', the sinking of the ''[[USS Yorktown (CV-5)|USS Yorktown]]''. (Willis has written extensively in several novels about events in [[World War II]].)

==Background==

Connie Willis's inspiration for ''Passage'' came in part from her mother's death, when Willis was 12. Willis felt frustrated that relatives and friends tried to comfort her with platitudes, so she wanted to write a novel that dealt with death honestly and could help people understand the process of death and mourning.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.locusmag.com/2003/Issue01/Willis.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The character of Maurice Mandrake was inspired by Willis's anger at psychics and mediums who take advantage of vulnerable people.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scifi.com/sfw/interviews/sfw11763.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==

Joanna Lander, a clinical psychologist, interviews patients who have had near-death experiences; she aspires [[Near-death studies|to understand what occurs]] between the times when a person dies and then is revived. She becomes frustrated when many of her patients cannot or will not give accurate information about their experiences. She realizes that the [[scientific evidence]] is contaminated by the influence of Dr. Maurice Mandrake, a persistent and almost omnipresent [[charlatan]] "researcher" who publishes best-selling books about near-death experiences and convinces patients that their experiences happened exactly the way his books describe NDEs, such as learning cosmic secrets from [[angel]]s:

{{quote|They remembered it all for him, [[Out-of-body experience|leaving their body]] and entering the [[Near-death experience#Characteristics|tunnel]] and meeting Jesus, remembered the Light and the [[Life review|Life Review]] and the Meetings with Deceased Loved Ones. Conveniently forgetting the sights and sounds that didn't fit and conjuring up ones that did. And completely obliterating whatever had actually occurred.&lt;ref name= Willis&gt;{{cite book |authorlink= Connie Willis |last= Willis |first= Connie |title= Passage |location= New York |publisher= Bantam Books |year= 2001 |page= 5 |isbn= 0-553-11124-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Dr. Richard Wright, who has discovered a way to induce artificial NDEs in patients and [[Electroencephalography|monitor their brain activity]] throughout, contacts Joanna and asks if she will join his research study and interview his patients after he induces NDEs. She agrees. They are intellectually compatible and have a budding, mutual romantic interest.

Mandrake considers the pair his competitors, and he sabotages their efforts by approaching revived patients before they can. Mandrake's method is to ask mellifluous [[leading question]]s of the patients and thereby taint their self-reported NDEs; this causes Joanna and Richard hardship in finding un-interviewed volunteers for their own study. The reader later learns that two of their volunteers are liars, which also corrupts their conjectures.

Lacking enough volunteers for proper [[methodology]], Joanna elects to undergo the process. She gets the help of Tish, a nurse, to help with the prep; Tish is happy to, because she thinks Richard Wright is "cute" and can flirt with him while Joanna is "under".

Joanna finds herself in a dark passage that, through further NDEs, she realizes is part of a dream-like version of the ''[[RMS Titanic]]'', on which she encounters passengers of the real ''Titanic'' as well as someone symbolically near death, a high school teacher whom she had studied with a decade or so earlier, Mr. Pat Briarley. Between NDE sessions, Joanna struggles to figure out why she sees the ''Titanic'', and she eventually tracks down Mr. Briarley, who spoke often of the ''Titanic'' in class. Joanna discovers that Mr. Briarley, once a highly animated and keen teacher, now suffers from [[Alzheimer's disease]]. This is crushing to Joanna, who was certain that Mr. Briarley could give her "the key" to clarify why she sees the ''Titanic''. However, Mr. Briarley's niece, Kit, promises to help.

Joanna also consults with Maisie Nellis, a nine-year-old girl who suffers from [[Ventricular fibrillation|a heart defect]], "V-fib", because Maisie, a born rationalist, gives only accurate information about her NDEs. Maisie also gives Joanna important information about the ''Titanic''.

Through talking with her patients and undergoing more NDEs, Lander realizes that the near-death experience is a mechanism that the brain uses to create a scenario symbolic of what the brain attempts to do when it is dying: find a suitable neural pathway by which to send a message that can "jump start" the rest of the body back into life. If the person having a real near-death experience can metaphorically send a message to someone appearing in the NDE, she learns (specifically, from a revived coma patient), the person will awaken and survive.

Before she can tell Richard Wright about her discovery, she goes to visit Nurse Vielle in the Emergency Room and is stabbed by a man deranged by a drug called "rogue". Before losing consciousness, she manages to say a few words to Vielle, trying to communicate her discovery about NDEs. She finds herself on the ''Titanic'' again and races against dream-like obstacles to escape and awaken.

Richard Wright, on hearing that Joanna is dying or dead, enters an artificial NDE, thinking that he will find himself in the ''Titanic'' and be able to rescue Lander. He instead finds himself at the offices of the [[White Star Line]], where the names of the victims of the ''Titanic'' disaster are being read to the public - he is too late to "save" Joanna. He awakens many hours later, and Tish, crying, tells him that Joanna has died.

As Richard and Joanna's friends struggle with her death, Joanna herself remains on the ''Titanic'' until it sinks, and her memories of life fade away.

Richard realizes that Joanna was trying to tell him something before she died (they had discussed the importance of [[last words]]), and he tracks down all the people she spoke to before she was stabbed. He learns what Joanna discovered. Before she could reach him, Joanna had told, of all people, Mandrake, "The NDE is a message. It's an [[SOS]]. It's a call for help."&lt;ref&gt;Willis, ''Passage'', p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt; Grasping her dying message, Richard develops a chemical treatment that he believes can revive a patient. Maisie suffers V-fib and dies, but Richard successfully uses his experimental treatment on her, and she later receives a heart transplant; she will live.

Within her final NDE, on an imaginary ship, Joanna finds herself adrift on the water, with some memories still intact and accompanied by a child and a dog which Maisie has told her about from other disasters. As the novel ends, they watch the approach of a ship repeatedly mentioned by Ed Wojakowski.

==Characters==

* '''Joanna Lander''' - A clinical psychologist who attempts to learn the true nature of near-death experiences through interviews with patients. She is kind, often [[Absent-mindedness|absent-minded]], but as dogged as [[Sherlock Holmes]] when she is after a clue to her investigations. Joanna, unmarried and childless, loves Maisie Nellis, calling her "one of the world's great kids."&lt;ref&gt;Willis, ''Passage'', p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Richard Wright''' - A neurologist who wants to discover a way to revive patients after clinical death. Described as blond and cute, he is considered aloof by Amelia Tanaka and by Nurse Tish, who want to date him, and a great catch by Vielle, who wants Joanna to date him. He is a nurturer: Joanna never thinks to bring lunch for herself, although an ongoing joke in the novel is that the hospital [[cafeteria]] is never open; Richard often feeds Joanna the oranges, crackers, candy bars and sodas in his coat pockets which he brought from home.
* '''Vielle Howard''' - A nurse who works in the ER, and Joanna Lander's best friend. They regularly get together to watch movies. Vielle has a crush on a [[police officer]] who looks like [[Denzel Washington]]; but she is pursued by a [[morgue]] employee.
* '''Maurice Mandrake''' - A charlatan researcher who interviews patients who have had NDEs, convincing them that their experiences were exactly as he describes in his best-selling books.
* '''Amelia Tanaka''' - A [[Pre-medical|pre-med]] college student who volunteers for the NDE study because she thinks Richard Wright is cute. She reports that her NDEs make her feel warm and loved, but very late in the book it is revealed that she lied, having told Wright what she thought he wanted to hear. In fact, her NDEs took place in her college's department of chemistry and frightened her, to the point that she quits the project.
* '''Ed Wojakowski''' - A gregarious elderly man who volunteers for the NDE study and claims to be a World War II veteran in the [[United States Navy]], but is discovered to borrow other people's experiences and possibly just to lie about all the rest. After many meandering and irrelevant stories, avoiding what he has actually experienced in an NDE, he tells Joanna after she nails him with a direct question that his NDE happened aboard a ship. She assumes it is the ''Titanic''.
* '''Maisie Nellis''' - A nine-year-old suffering from [[cardiomyopathy]] and occasional [[ventricular fibrillation]] and [[atrial fibrillation]]; often in the hospital, she is put on the list for a heart transplant. She has NDEs and is a friend of Joanna. She is obsessed with famous disasters, including the [[Hartford circus fire]] (which becomes the setting of her final NDE). Maisie infects Joanna with her obsession, so that Lander's last NDE includes people who died in that fire. "Maisie, in fact, with her junior gonzo way of facing down death, owns the spiritual center of the novel," writes Gary Wolfe.&lt;ref name= "Wolfe" /&gt; ([[Jo Walton]] adds, "The chapter from Maisie's point of view after she has been lied to is one of the best things Willis has ever written..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tor.com/2012/07/26/messages-from-beyond-death-connie-williss-passage/ |author= Walton, Jo |authorlink= Jo Walton |date= July 26, 2012 |title= Messages From Beyond Death: Connie Willis's ''Passage'' |publisher= ''[[Tor.com]]'' |accessdate= November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* '''Pat Briarley''' - Joanna's English teacher in high school who spoke often of the events surrounding the ''Titanic'', which Joanna has internalized and largely forgotten; he suffers from [[Alzheimer's disease]].
* '''Kit Gardiner''' - Pat Briarley's niece, who has become her uncle's [[caregiver]], and who becomes good friends with Joanna, offering to do research for her among Mr. Briarley's many books.
* '''Carl Aspinall''' - A coma patient in the hospital (whom the nurses and Joanna irreverently call "Coma Carl"). Like a dreamer in [[rapid eye movement sleep]], he sometimes talks and gestures; his caretakers mistakenly interpret his movements as "rowing" and his utterances as "patches" and "oh, grand." When he suddenly awakens, Joanna learns that he was experiencing a sort of NDE set in Arizona, in which he was menaced by [[Apache]]s, was muttering about the [[Rio Grande]] river, and was attempting to send [[smoke signal]]s, not rowing. Though a minor character, he actuates the [[Climax (narrative)|novel's climax]] by unintentionally enlightening Joanna that the NDE is a process of sending a message, both physiologically and symbolically.

==Style==

Willis includes elements of [[wikt:madcap|madcap]] comedy in the style and form of ''Passage'', and links different events thematically in order to foreshadow later events.&lt;ref name="scifi.com"&gt;http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue211/books.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel celebrates [[metaphor]], the very idea of which gives Joanna the understanding of how the NDE works to help the dying brain, rather than to ease it into death.

Willis gives certain dialogue traits to some characters. Joanna, seeking to avoid leading questions, continuously asks of patients and even friends, "Can you describe it?" and "Can you be more specific?" (When she finds Dr. Wright starting to unconsciously mimic her, she grins in approval.&lt;ref&gt;Willis, ''Passage'', p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;) Maisie, meanwhile, always manipulating Joanna and others to remain with her during her boring bouts in hospital rooms, tends to begin questions with, "Did you know...?" as in, about the ''Hindenburg'', "Did you know they had a piano? Up in a balloon?"&lt;ref&gt;Willis, ''Passage'', p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, when Kit Briarley begins a question, "Did you know...?" Joanna laughs in appreciation.

==References to pop culture==
When they gather to watch movies one night, Vielle tells Richard, "As if talking to patients about their NDEs isn't bad enough, in her spare time Joanna researches famous people's [[last words]]."&lt;ref&gt;Willis, ''Passage'', p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; So does Willis: each chapter section and each chapter has an [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]]; they include:

* "More light!" ([[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s last words)
* "To die would be an awfully big adventure." ([[Charles Frohman]], quoting [[J. M. Barrie]]'s ''[[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan]]'' before he died on the sinking ''[[RMS Lusitania]]'' in 1915)
* "I must go in, the fog is rising." ([[Emily Dickinson]]'s last words)
* "Hold tight!" ([[Karl Wallenda]]'s last words)

Willis has the characters discuss a great many movies, some of which have indirect or obvious bearing on the novel's themes. They include ''[[Coma (1978 film)|Coma]]'', ''[[Fight Club]]'', ''[[Final Destination]]'', ''[[Flatliners]]'', ''[[Harold and Maude]]'', and ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'', as well as ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' and ''[[The X-Files]]''.

Joanna frequently talks about the ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' movie; she, Vielle, Pat and Kit Briarley, and others share her dislike of it because of the changes to historical fact. Joanna (speaking for Willis), complains:

{{quote|about [[Charles Lightoller|Lightoller]] and [[William McMaster Murdoch|Murdoch]]. And Loraine Allison, she thought. She remembered ranting, "Why didn't they tell the stories of the real people who died on the ''Titanic'', like [[John Jacob Astor IV|John Jacob Astor]] and Lorraine Allison?... She was six years old and the only [[First class travel#Cruise ships and liners|first class]] child to die, and her story's a lot more interesting than dopey [[Titanic (1997 film)#Fictional characters|Jack]] and [[Titanic (1997 film)#Fictional characters|Rose]]'s!"&lt;ref&gt;Willis, ''Passage'', p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Reception==
[[Gary K. Wolfe]], the first of many ''[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]]'' reviewers to discuss the book at time of publication, compares the novel at many points with Willis's ''[[Lincoln's Dreams]]'' and writes:
{{quote|Apart from its simple virtues as a compelling story on an irresistible theme, Connie Willis's big, ambitious new novel ''Passage'' should be of particular interest to her readers because of the ways in which it recapitulates major preoccupations and techniques of her career to date, and because in it she seems fiercely determined to show us everything she's got... Each makes historical research a major vector of narrative suspense, with specific historical details&amp;mdash;the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in ''Lincoln's Dreams'', the sinking of the ''Titanic'' here&amp;mdash;treated as though they were clues in a [[Crime fiction|murder mystery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Wolfe |first= Gary K. |authorlink= Gary K. Wolfe |date= March 2001 |title= Passage |journal= [[Locus (magazine)|Locus]] |volume= 46 |issue=482, number 3 |page= 21 |location= [[Oakland, California]] |publisher= [[Charles N. Brown]] |issn= 0047-4959}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wolfe continues: {{quote|Like ''[[Doomsday Book (novel)|Doomsday Book]]'' (1992), it grapples with one of the grandest of all themes, death, and uses the inability of major characters to communicate key bits of information to each other as another suspense device. Like Willis's comic short fiction, it pokes fun at institutional culture&amp;mdash;in this case hospitals, with their [[maze]]like architecture and ego-driven politics&amp;mdash;and at such ghoulish aspects of pop culture as afterlife gurus like John Edwards" (i.e., [[John Edward]]) "and [[self-help]] manuals for the recently bereaved."&lt;ref name= "Wolfe" /&gt;}}

Faren Miller wrote in ''Locus'': 
{{quote|While the subject matter and setting of ''Passage'' allow Willis to display her characteristically ''unsentimental'' poignancy ... she can also poke fun at matters of life and death... The book's multiplying internal and external mazes provide an emblem of human complexity, foolishness, and deeper terrors, some reaching from beyond death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Miller |first= Faren |date= May 2001 |title= Passage |journal= [[Locus (magazine)|Locus]] |volume= 46 |issue=484, number 5 |page= 25 |location= [[Oakland, California]] |publisher= [[Charles N. Brown]] |issn= 0047-4959}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Jonathan Strahan of ''Locus'' praises the novel's "seriousness", "clear-eyed humor" and its "amusing portrayal of what it's like to be in a big hospital", which is itself a "confusing, overwhelming portrait," as parts of what it makes "her most ambitious novel". He adds, "At the three-quarter point of ''Passage'', Willis does something that no reviewer should leak" - he means Joanna's death and what comes thereafter - "but it is much of what makes the book worth reading. What she attempts is to find a way to look at death and life after death in a way that doesn't conflict with matters of faith, but which also is consistent with the fundamentally rational underpinnings of science fiction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Strahan |first= Jonathan |date= June 2001 |title= Passage |journal= [[Locus (magazine)|Locus]] |volume= 46 |issue=485, number 6 |page= 71 |location= [[Oakland, California]] |publisher= [[Charles N. Brown]] |issn= 0047-4959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SciFi.com describes ''Passage'' as "an emotionally exhausting trip" that is ultimately "a rewarding experience."&lt;ref name="scifi.com"/&gt; Laura Miller, writing for ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', says that "its construction is a marvel of ingenuity and — what's even more remarkable, given the wizardry of Willis' storytelling — its intellectual honesty is impeccable... You won't find the beautiful sentences of more-celebrated 'novelists of ideas' here, though the ideas themselves are far better, more daring and more original, than those chewed over by most literary heavyweights. The dialogue can sound a trifle canned, the minor characters feel a mite thin (not that many novels of ideas don't share these flaws, too), which explains in part why ''Passage'' seems to hover between genre and genius. Given how rare a searching intelligence like Willis' is among today's novelists, does it really matter?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.salon.com/2001/05/21/willis_4/ |author= Miller, Laura |date= May 21, 2001 |title= ''Passage'' by Connie Willis |publisher= ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' |accessdate= October 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[SF Site]]'' review judges that the novel "starts slowly, and it's too long. Willis' trademark habit of making some set of frustrating everyday-life details a recurring motif or running joke (in this case, the difficulty of navigating the hospital corridors, plus the never-open cafeteria) is over-extended here...";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sfsite.com/09a/pa111.htm |author= Horton, Rich |year= 2001 |title= Passage |publisher= ''[[SF Site]]'' |accessdate= October 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; conversely, reviewer Steven Wu felt that "Part One of the book is masterful, with several chilling scenes, a compelling mystery, and a doozy of a cliffhanger ending. But then, only a third of the way through the book, things begin slowing down."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.scwu.com/bookreviews/h/WillisConniePassage.shtml |author= Wu, Steven |date= August 12, 2002 |title= Passage |publisher= ''Steven Wu's Book Reviews'' |accessdate= October 12, 2012 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120208165435/http://www.scwu.com/bookreviews/h/WillisConniePassage.shtml |archivedate= February 8, 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''[[The A.V. Club]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s reviewer writes: {{quote|There's certainly nothing comforting about ''Passage'', which steeps its characters in death of all kinds — swift and sudden, prolonged and painful. Willis' satirical flair originally has Landry [sic] and Wright running around like [[The Three Stooges]], juggling impossible schedules in an impossible environment and careening amidst exaggeratedly colorful characters in every chapter. A mid-book twist, however, takes the story into darker and more memorable territory, helping turn ''Passage'' into a complex, finely crafted, haunting story that makes the light at the end of the tunnel impossible to take lightly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.avclub.com/articles/connie-willis-passage,5995/ |author= Robinson, Tasha |date= April 19, 2002 |title= Passage |publisher= [[The A.V.

A reviewer from Scientific Gems wrote of the novel, "it is well-written, it has an interesting plot, and it has useful things to say about the nature of science and the nature of medicine. One piece of good advice, for example: 'Joanna says you should only say what you saw, not what anybody else says you should see.'" [Spoken by Maisie Nellis] "Indeed, the importance of truth is underscored repeatedly in the book. Thanks partly to a very young female patient with a strange taste in literature [Maisie again], there is also some interesting discussion of historical disasters..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://scientificgems.wordpress.com/2015/10/08/passage-a-book-review/ |author= Scientific Gems |date= October 8, 2015	|title= ''Passage'': a book review |accessdate= November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;https://scientificgems.wordpress.com/2015/10/08/passage-a-book-review/

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36973">In [[philosophy]], '''physicalism''' is the [[metaphysical]] thesis that "everything is physical", that there is "nothing over and above" the physical,&lt;ref&gt;See Smart, 1959&lt;/ref&gt; or that everything [[supervenience|supervenes]] on the physical.&lt;ref name="DStoljar" /&gt; Physicalism is a form of ontological [[monism]]—a "one [[Substance theory|substance]]" view of the nature of reality as opposed to a "two-substance" ([[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]]) or "many-substance" ([[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]]) view. Both the definition of "physical" and the meaning of physicalism have been debated.

Physicalism is closely related to [[materialism]]. Physicalism grew out of materialism with advancements of the physical sciences in explaining observed phenomena. The terms are often used interchangeably, although they are sometimes distinguished, for example on the basis of physics describing more than just matter (including energy and physical law). Common arguments against physicalism include both the [[philosophical zombie]] argument&lt;ref name="Chalmers, D. 1996" /&gt; and the multiple observers argument,&lt;ref name="Zuboff1990" /&gt; that the existence of a physical being may imply zero or more distinct conscious entities.

The word "physicalism" was introduced into philosophy in the 1930s by [[Otto Neurath]] and [[Rudolf Carnap]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/physicalism/ Physicalism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of "physical" in physicalism is a philosophical concept and can be distinguished from alternative definitions found in the literature (e.g. [[Karl Popper]] defined a physical proposition to be one which can at least in theory be denied by observation&lt;ref name="Popper2002" /&gt;). A "physical property", in this context, may be a metaphysical or logical combination of properties which are  physical in the ordinary sense. It is common to express the notion of "metaphysical or logical combination of properties" using the notion of [[supervenience]]: A property ''A'' is said to supervene on a property ''B'' if any change in ''A'' necessarily implies a change in ''B''.&lt;ref&gt;See Bennett and McLaughlin, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Since any change in a combination of properties must consist of a change in at least one component property, we see that the combination does indeed supervene on the individual properties. The point of this extension is that physicalists usually suppose the existence of various abstract concepts which are non-physical in the ordinary sense of the word; so physicalism cannot be defined in a way that denies the existence of these abstractions. Also, physicalism defined in terms of supervenience does not entail that all properties in the actual world are [[type physicalism|type identical]] to physical properties. It is, therefore, compatible with [[multiple realizability]].&lt;ref&gt;See Putnam, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

From the notion of supervenience, we see that, assuming that mental, social, and biological properties supervene on physical properties, it follows that two hypothetical worlds cannot be identical in their physical properties but differ in their mental, social or biological properties.&lt;ref name="DStoljar" /&gt;

Two common approaches to defining "physicalism" are the theory-based and object-based approaches. The theory-based conception of physicalism proposes that "a property is physical if and only if it either is the sort of property that physical theory tells us about or else is a property which metaphysically (or logically) supervenes on the sort of property that physical theory tells us about".&lt;ref name="DStoljar" /&gt; Likewise, the object-based conception claims that "a property is physical if and only if: it either is the sort of property required by a complete account of the intrinsic nature of paradigmatic physical objects and their constituents or else is a property which metaphysically (or logically) supervenes on the sort of property required by a complete account of the intrinsic nature of paradigmatic physical objects and their constituents".

Physicalists have traditionally opted for a "theory-based" characterization of the physical either in terms of current physics,&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., Smart, 1978; Lewis, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; or a future (ideal) physics.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., Poland, 1994; Chalmers, 1996; Wilson, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; These two theory-based conceptions of the physical represent both horns of [[Hempel's dilemma]]&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Melnyk should apparently be credited with having introduced this name for Hempel's argument. See Melnyk, 1997, p.624&lt;/ref&gt; (named after the late philosopher of science and logical empiricist [[Carl Gustav Hempel]]): an argument against theory-based understandings of the physical. Very roughly, Hempel's dilemma is that if we define the physical by reference to current physics, then physicalism is very likely to be false, as it is very likely (by pessimistic meta-induction&lt;ref&gt;see Vincente, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;) that much of current physics is false. But if we instead define the physical in terms of a future (ideal) or completed physics, then physicalism is hopelessly vague or indeterminate.&lt;ref&gt;See Hempel, 1969, pp.180-183; Hempel, 1980, pp.194-195.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the force of Hempel's dilemma against theory-based conceptions of the physical remains contested,&lt;ref&gt;For a recent defence of the first horn see Melnyk, 1997. For a defence of the second, see Wilson, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; alternative "non-theory-based" conceptions of the physical have also been proposed. [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]] (1998) for example, has argued in favour of the aforementioned "object-based" conception of the physical.&lt;ref&gt;See Jackson, 1998, p.7; Lycan, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; An objection to this proposal, which Jackson himself noted in 1998, is that if it turns out that [[panpsychism]] or [[panprotopsychism]] is true, then such a non-materialist understanding of the physical gives the counterintuitive result that physicalism is, nevertheless, also true since such properties will figure in a complete account of paradigmatic examples of the physical.

David Papineau&lt;ref&gt;See Papineau, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and Barbara Montero&lt;ref&gt;See Montero, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; have advanced and subsequently defended&lt;ref&gt;See Papineau and Montero, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; a "via negativa" characterization of the physical. The gist of the via negativa strategy is to understand the physical in terms of what it is not: the mental. In other words, the via negativa strategy understands the physical as "the non-mental". An objection to the via negativa conception of the physical is that (like the object-based conception) it doesn't have the resources to distinguish [[neutral monism]] (or panprotopsychism) from physicalism.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., Judisch, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supervenience-based definitions of physicalism ===

Adopting a supervenience-based account of the physical, the definition of physicalism as "all properties are physical" can be unravelled to:

1) Physicalism is [[Truth|true]] at a possible world ''w'' if and only if any world that is a physical duplicate of ''w'' is also a duplicate of ''w simpliciter''.&lt;ref name="See Jackson, 1998"&gt;See Jackson, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Applied to the actual world (our world), statement 1 above is the claim that physicalism is true at the actual world if and only if at ''every possible world'' in which the physical properties and laws of the actual  world are instantiated, the non-physical (in the ordinary sense of the word) properties of the actual world are instantiated as well. To borrow a metaphor from [[Saul Kripke]] (1972), the truth of physicalism at the actual world entails that once God has instantiated or "fixed" the physical properties and laws of our world, then God's work is done; the rest comes "automatically".

Unfortunately, statement 1 fails to capture even a necessary condition for physicalism to be true at a world ''w''. To see this, imagine a world in which there are ''only'' physical properties—if physicalism is true at any world it is true at this one. But one can conceive physical duplicates of such a world that are ''not'' also duplicates simpliciter of it: worlds that have the same physical properties as our imagined one, but with some additional property or properties. A world might contain "[[epiphenomenal ectoplasm]]", some additional pure experience that does not interact with the physical components of the world and is not necessitated by them (does not supervene on them).&lt;ref name="Lewis1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Horgan1982" /&gt; To handle the epiphenomenal ectoplasm problem, statement 1 can be modified to include a "that's-all" or "totality" clause&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; or be restricted to "positive" properties.&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Adopting the former suggestion here, we can reformulate statement 1 as follows:

2) Physicalism is true at a possible world ''w'' if and only if any world that is a ''minimal'' physical duplicate of ''w'' is a duplicate of ''w simpliciter''.&lt;ref name="See Jackson, 1998"/&gt;

Applied in the same way, statement 2 is the claim that physicalism is true at a possible world ''w'' if and only if any world that is a physical duplicate of ''w'' (without any further changes), is duplicate of ''w'' without qualification. This allows a world in which there are only physical properties to be counted as one at which physicalism is true, since worlds in which there is some extra stuff are ''not'' "minimal" physical duplicates of such a world, nor are they minimal physical duplicates of worlds that contain some non-physical properties that are metaphysically necessitated by the physical.&lt;ref&gt;Where "metaphysical necessitation" here simply means that if "B" metaphysically necessitates "A" then any world in which B is instantiated is a world in which A is instantiated--a consequence of the metaphysical supervenience of A upon B. See Kripke, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

But while statement 2 overcomes the problem of worlds at which there is some extra stuff (sometimes referred to as the "epiphenomenal ectoplasm problem"&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., Stoljar, 2009, section 4.3.&lt;/ref&gt;) it faces a different challenge: the so-called "blockers problem".&lt;ref&gt;See Hawthorne, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Imagine a world where the relation between the physical and non-physical properties at this world (call the world ''w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'') is slightly weaker than metaphysical necessitation, such that a certain kind of non-physical intervener—"a blocker"—could, were it to exist at ''w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,'' prevent the non-physical properties in ''w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' from being instantiated by the instantiation of the physical properties at ''w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.'' Since statement 2 rules out worlds which are physical duplicates of ''w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' that also contain non-physical interveners by virtue of the minimality, or that's-all clause, statement 2 gives the (allegedly) incorrect result that physicalism is true at ''w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.'' One response to this problem is to abandon statement 2 in favour of the alternative possibility mentioned earlier in which supervenience-based formulations of physicalism are restricted to what [[David Chalmers]] (1996) calls "positive properties". A positive property is one that "...if instantiated in a world W, is also instantiated by the corresponding individual in all worlds that contain W as a proper part."&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, 1996, p.40.&lt;/ref&gt; Following this suggestion, we can then formulate physicalism as follows:

3) Physicalism is true at a possible world ''w'' if and only if any world that is a physical duplicate of ''w'' is a positive duplicate of ''w''.&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, 1996; Stoljar, 2009, section 4.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the face of it, statement 3 seems able to handle both the epiphenomenal ectoplasm problem and the blockers problem. With regard to the former, statement 3 gives the correct result that a purely physical world is one at which physicalism is true, since worlds in which there is some extra stuff are positive duplicates of a purely physical world. With regard to the latter, statement 3 appears to have the consequence that worlds in which there are blockers are worlds where positive non-physical properties of ''w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' will be absent, hence ''w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' will not be counted as a world at which physicalim is true.&lt;ref&gt;see Hawthorne, 2002, p.107&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Stoljar]] (2010) objects to this response to the blockers problem on the basis that since the non-physical properties of ''w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' aren't instantiated at a world in which there is a blocker, they are not positive properties in Chalmers' (1996) sense, and so statement 3 will count ''w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' as a world at which physicalism is true after all.&lt;ref&gt;See Stoljar, 2010, p.138&lt;/ref&gt;

A further problem for supervenience-based formulations of physicalism is the so-called "necessary beings problem".&lt;ref name="See Jackson, 1998"/&gt; A necessary being in this context is a non-physical being that exists in all possible worlds (for example what theists refer to as [[God]]). A necessary being is compatible with all the definitions provided, because it is supervenient on everything; yet it is usually taken to contradict the notion that everything is physical. So any supervenience-based formulation of physicalism will at best state a [[necessity and sufficiency|necessary but not sufficient]] condition for the truth of physicalism.&lt;ref name="See Jackson, 1998"/&gt;

Additional objections have been raised to the above definitions provided for supervenience physicalism: one could imagine an alternate world that differs only by the presence of a single ammonium molecule (or physical property), and yet based on statement 1, such a world might be completely different in terms of its distribution of mental properties.&lt;ref name="Kim1993" /&gt; Furthermore, there are differences expressed concerning the modal status of physicalism; whether it is a necessary truth, or is only true in a world which conforms to certain conditions (i.e. those of physicalism).&lt;ref name="DStoljar" /&gt;

=== Realisation physicalism ===

Closely related to supervenience physicalism, is realisation physicalism, the thesis that every instantiated property is either physical or realised by a physical property.&lt;ref name="Melnyk1997" /&gt;

=== Token physicalism ===
{{See also|Anomalous monism}}

Token physicalism is the proposition that "for every actual particular (object, event or process) x, there is some physical particular y such that x = y". It is intended to capture the idea of "physical mechanisms".&lt;ref name="DStoljar" /&gt; Token physicalism is compatible with [[property dualism]], in which all substances are "physical", but physical objects may have mental properties as well as physical properties. Token physicalism is not however equivalent to supervenience physicalism. Firstly, token physicalism does not imply supervenience physicalism because the former does not rule out the possibility of non-supervenient properties (provided that they are associated only with physical particulars). Secondarily, supervenience physicalism does not imply token physicalism, for the former allows supervenient objects (such as a "nation", or "soul") that are not equal to any physical object.

== Reductionism and emergentism ==

=== Reductionism ===

There are multiple versions of reductionism.&lt;ref name="DStoljar" /&gt; In the context of physicalism, the reductions referred to are of a "linguistic" nature, allowing discussions of, say, mental phenomena to be translated into discussions of physics. In one formulation, every concept is analysed in terms of a physical concept. One counter-argument to this supposes there may be an additional class of expressions which is non-physical but which increases the expressive power of a theory.&lt;ref name="Smart1959" /&gt; Another version of reductionism is based on the requirement that one theory (mental or physical) be logically derivable from a second.&lt;ref name="Nagel1961" /&gt;

The combination of reductionism and physicalism is usually called reductive physicalism in the philosophy of mind. The opposite view is non-reductive physicalism. Reductive physicalism is the view that mental states are both nothing over and above physical states and reducible to physical states. One version of reductive physicalism is [[type physicalism]] or mind-body identity theory. Type physicalism asserts that "for every actually instantiated property F, there is some physical property G such that F=G".&lt;ref name="DStoljar" /&gt; Unlike token physicalism, type physicalism entails supervenience physicalism.

A common argument against reductive physicalism is [[multiple realizability]], the possibility that a psychological process (say) could be instantiated by many different neurological processes (even non-neurological processes, in the case of machine or alien intelligence).&lt;ref name="Kim1993" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fodor1974" /&gt; For in this case, the neurological terms translating a psychological term must be disjunctions over the possible instantiations, and it is argued that no physical law can use these disjunctions as terms.&lt;ref name="Fodor1974" /&gt; Type physicalism was the original target of the multiple realizability argument.&lt;ref&gt;Bickle, J. (2006). Multiple realizability. In Stanford encyclopedia of philosophy. Available at http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/multiple-realizability/. Last revised in 2006, and last checked on May 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emergentism ===
{{main article|Emergentism}}

There are two versions of emergentism, the strong version and the weak version. Supervenience physicalism has been seen as a strong version of emergentism, in which the subject's psychological experience is considered genuinely novel.&lt;ref name="DStoljar" /&gt; Non-reductive physicalism, on the other side, is a weak version of emergentism because it does not need that the subject's psychological experience be novel. The strong version of emergentism is incompatible with physicalism. Since there are novel mental states, mental states are not nothing over and above physical states. However, the weak version of emergentism is compatible with physicalism. 

We can see that emergentism is actually a very broad view. Some forms of emergentism appear either incompatible with physicalism or equivalent to it (e.g. posteriori physicalism),&lt;ref name="Byrne1993" /&gt; others appear to merge both [[dualism (philosophy)|dualism]] and supervenience. Emergentism compatible with dualism claims that mental states and physical states are metaphysically distinct while maintaining the supervenience of mental states on physical states. This proposition however contradicts supervenience physicalism, which asserts a denial of dualism.

== A priori versus a posteriori physicalism ==
Physicalists hold that physicalism is true. A natural question for physicalists, then, is whether the truth of physicalism is deducible [[A priori knowledge|a priori]] from the nature of the physical world (i.e., the inference is justified independently of experience, even though the nature of the physical world can itself only be determined through experience) or can only be deduced [[A priori knowledge|a posteriori]] (i.e., the justification of the inference itself is dependent upon experience). So-called "a priori physicalists" hold that from knowledge of the [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] of all physical truths, a totality or that's-all truth (to rule out non-physical epiphenomena, and enforce the closure of the physical world), and some primitive [[indexical]] truths such as "I am A" and "now is B", the truth of physicalism is knowable a priori.&lt;ref name="See Chalmers and Jackson, 2001"&gt;See Chalmers and Jackson, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Let "P" stand for the conjunction of all physical truths and laws, "T" for a that's-all truth, "I" for the indexical "centering" truths, and "N" for any [presumably non-physical] truth at the actual world. We can then, using the [[material conditional]] "→", represent a priori physicalism as the thesis that PTI → N is knowable a priori.&lt;ref name="See Chalmers and Jackson, 2001"/&gt; An important wrinkle here is that the [[concept]]s in N must be possessed non-deferentially in order for PTI → N to be knowable a priori. The suggestion, then, is that possession of the concepts in the [[consequent]], plus the empirical information in the [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] is sufficient for the consequent to be knowable a priori.

An "a posteriori physicalist", on the other hand, will reject the claim that PTI → N is knowable a priori. Rather, they would hold that the inference from PTI to N is justified by metaphysical considerations that in turn can be derived from experience. So the claim then is that "PTI and not N" is metaphysically impossible.

One commonly issued challenge to a priori physicalism and to physicalism in general is the "conceivability argument", or [[zombie argument]].&lt;ref&gt;See Chalmers, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; At a rough approximation, the conceivability argument runs as follows:

'''P1''') PTI and not Q (where "Q" stands for the conjunction of all truths about consciousness, or some "generic" truth about someone being "phenomenally" conscious [i.e., there is "something it is like"&lt;ref&gt;See Nagel, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; to be a person x] ) is conceivable (i.e., it is not knowable a priori that PTI and not Q is false).

'''P2''') If PTI and not Q is conceivable, then PTI and not Q is metaphysically possible.

'''P3''') If PTI and not Q is metaphysically possible then physicalism is false.

'''C''') Physicalism is false.&lt;ref&gt;See Chalmers, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Here proposition '''P3''' is a direct application of the supervenience of consciousness, and hence of any supervenience-based version of physicalism: If PTI and not Q is possible, there is some [[possible world]] where it is true. This world differs from [the relevant indexing on] our world, where PTIQ is true. But the other world is a minimal physical duplicate of our world, because PT is true there. So there is a possible world which is a minimal physical duplicate of our world, but not a full duplicate; this contradicts the definition of physicalism that we saw above.

Since a priori physicalists hold that PTI → N is a priori, they are committed to denying P1) of the conceivability argument. The a priori physicalist, then, must argue that PTI and not Q, on ideal rational reflection, is incoherent or [[contradictory]].&lt;ref&gt;For a survey of the different arguments for this conclusion (as well as responses to each), see Chalmers, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A posteriori physicalists, on the other hand, generally accept P1) but deny P2)--the move from "conceivability to metaphysical possibility". Some a posteriori physicalists think that unlike the possession of most, if not all other [[empirical]] concepts, the possession of consciousness has the special property that the presence of PTI and the absence of consciousness will be conceivable—even though, according to them, it is knowable a posteriori that PTI and not Q is not metaphysically possible. These a posteriori physicalists endorse some version of what Daniel Stoljar (2005) has called "the [[phenomenal concept strategy]]".&lt;ref&gt;See Stoljar, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly speaking, the phenomenal concept strategy is a label for those a posteriori physicalists who attempt to show that it is only the ''concept'' of consciousness—not the ''property''—that is in some way "special" or [[sui generis]].&lt;ref&gt;cf. Stoljar, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Other a posteriori physicalists&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Tye, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; eschew the phenomenal concept strategy, and argue that even ordinary macroscopic truths such as "water covers 60% of the earth's surface" are not knowable a priori from PTI and a non-deferential grasp of the concepts "water" and "earth" ''et cetera''. If this is correct, then we should (arguably) conclude that conceivability does not entail metaphysical possibility, and P2) of the conceivability argument against physicalism is false.&lt;ref&gt;For critical discussion, see Chalmers, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Real physicalists must accept that at least some ultimates are intrinsically experience-involving.  They must at least embrace ''micropsychism''. Given that everything concrete is physical, and that everything physical is constituted out of physical ultimates, and that experience is part of concrete reality, it seems the only reasonable position, more than just an 'inference to the best explanation'... Micropsychism is not yet panpsychism, for as things stand realistic physicalists can conjecture that only some types of ultimates are intrinsically experiential.  But they must allow that panpsychism may be true, and the big step has already been taken with micropsychism, the admission that at least some ultimates must be experiential. 'And were the inmost essence of things laid open to us' I think that the idea that some but not all physical ultimates are experiential would look like the idea that some but not all physical ultimates are spatio-temporal (on the assumption that spacetime is indeed a fundamental feature of reality). I would bet a lot against there being such radical heterogeneity at the very bottom of things. In fact (to disagree with my earlier self) it is hard to see why this view would not count as a form of dualism... So now I can say that physicalism, i.e. real physicalism, entails panexperientialism or panpsychism. All physical stuff is energy, in one form or another, and all energy, I trow, is an experience-involving phenomenon. This sounded crazy to me for a long time, but I am quite used to it, now that I know that there is no alternative short of 'substance dualism'... Real physicalism, realistic physicalism, entails panpsychism, and whatever problems are raised by this fact are problems a real physicalist must face.&lt;ref name="Strawson2006"/&gt;|[[Galen Strawson]]|Consciousness and Its Place in Nature: Does Physicalism Entail Panpsychism?}}

'''Poison Ivy''' is a fictional [[supervillain]], appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]], commonly in association with the [[superhero]] [[Batman]]. Created by [[Robert Kanigher]] and [[Sheldon Moldoff]], the character made her debut in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #181 (June 1966).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 118 |quote = Poison Ivy first cropped up to plague Gotham City in issue #181 of ''Batman''.

Poison Ivy, whose real name is '''Pamela Lillian Isley''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|z|l|i}}), has been portrayed as a [[Romantic interest|love interest]] of [[Batman]] and is known for her infatuation with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Batman's Top 10 Love Interests | work = MTV News | date = 2011-03-22 | accessdate = 2016-05-01 | url = http://www.mtv.com/news/2621111/batmans-top-10-love-interests/ | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160410030145/http://www.mtv.com/news/2621111/batmans-top-10-love-interests/ | archivedate = 2016-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Gotham City]] [[botany|botanist]] obsessed with plants, [[ecological extinction]], and environmentalism, Ivy typically wears a green one-piece outfit adorned with leaves and often has plant vines extending over her limbs and uses plant [[toxin]]s and mind-controlling [[pheromones]] for her criminal activities, which are usually aimed at protecting [[endangered species]] and the [[natural environment]]. She was originally characterized as a [[supervillain]], but as of the [[New 52]] and [[DC Rebirth]], she has periodically been depicted as an [[antiheroine]], often doing the wrong things for the right reasons.

One of the world's most notorious [[eco-terrorism|eco-terrorists]], Poison Ivy is one of Batman's most enduring enemies and belongs to the collective of adversaries who make up Batman's [[List of Batman Family adversaries#Classic Rogues Gallery|rogues gallery]], and has has been featured in many media adaptations related to Batman. [[Uma Thurman]] portrayed the character in ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman &amp; Robin]]'' and [[Clare Foley]], [[Maggie Geha]] and [[Peyton List (actress, born 1986)|Peyton List]] played her in ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]''. She has also been voiced by [[Diane Pershing]] in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', [[Piera Coppola]] on ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' animated series, [[Tasia Valenza]] for the ''[[Batman: Arkham]]'' video game franchise, and [[Riki Lindhome]] in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]''.

==Publication history==
[[File:Batman181.JPG|thumb|upright|right|Poison Ivy debuted in ''Batman'' #181 (June 1966).]]
Poison Ivy was created by [[Robert Kanigher]] and [[Sheldon Moldoff]], and the character first appeared in ''Batman'' #181 (June 1966). Robert Kanigher originally modeled Poison Ivy after [[Bettie Page]], giving her the same [[haircut]] and look.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://batman.ugo.com/gothamgirls/poisonivy/default.asp |title=UGO's World of Batman – Gotham Girls: Poison Ivy |publisher=Batman.ugo.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527212318/http://batman.ugo.com/gothamgirls/poisonivy/default.asp |archivedate=May 27, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character was partly inspired by the short story "[[Rappaccini's Daughter]]',"&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, Les. ''Batman: The Complete History'' (Chronicle Books, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; written by [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], about a maiden who tends a garden of poisonous plants; she becomes resistant to the poisons, but in the process she herself becomes poisonous to others. According to [[Octavio Paz]], the sources of Hawthorne's story lie in [[Ancient India]]. In the play ''[[Mudrarakshasa]]'', one of two political rivals employs the gift of a [[visha kanya]], a beautiful girl who is fed on poison. This theme of a woman transformed into a [[phial]] of venom is popular in Indian literature and appears in the [[Puranas]]. From India, the story passed to the West and contributed to the ''[[Gesta Romanorum]]'', among other texts. In the 17th century, [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]] picked up the tale in ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'' and gave it a historical character: the Indian king Porus sends [[Alexander the Great]] a girl brimming with poison.

Following the character's initial appearance, Poison Ivy continued to appear in the various Batman comic books and had a major role in the ''[[Black Orchid (comics)|Black Orchid]]'' miniseries. The character did not have an [[origin story|origin]] in her first appearances during the 1960s; she was merely a [[temptress]]. An origin story was later [[retroactive continuity|retcon]]ned for her. Poison Ivy is typically depicted with long flowing hair, plant vines extending over her neck or limbs, and a green one-piece suit adorned with leaves.&lt;ref name=FotE /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Dylan Horrocks|Horrocks, Dylan]] | Penciller = [[Rick Leonardi|Leonardi, Rick]] | Inker = Delperdang, Jesse | Story = The City is a Jungle | Title = Batgirl #52 | Volume = | Issue = 52 | Date = July 2004 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 22 | Panel = | ID = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==

===Pre-Crisis===
Dr. Lillian Rose, PhD&lt;ref name="goodcomics.comicbookresources.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2011/12/08/the-abandoned-an-forsaked-poison-ivys-name-is-lillian-rose/ |title=The Abandoned An' Forsaked - Poison Ivy's Name is Lillian Rose?! |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date=December 8, 2011 |accessdate=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a promising [[botany|botanist]] who is persuaded by Marc LeGrande into assisting him with the theft of an [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] artifact containing ancient herbs. Fearing she would implicate him in the theft, he attempts to poison her with the herbs, which are deadly and untraceable. She survives this murder attempt and discovers she has acquired an immunity to all natural toxins and diseases.&lt;ref name=MMB&gt;''World's Finest'' #252 (September 1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Crisis===
Following the events of the DC maxi-series comic ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', which massively [[retcon]]ned DC Universe history and continuity, Poison Ivy's origins were revised in ''[[Secret Origins]]'' #36, 1988, written by [[Neil Gaiman]].&lt;ref name="goodcomics.comicbookresources.com"/&gt; Poison Ivy's real name is Dr. Pamela Lillian Isley, PhD, a [[Gotham City]] botanist. She grows up wealthy with emotionally distant parents and later studies advanced botanical biochemistry at a university with [[Swamp Thing|Alec Holland]] under [[Floronic Man|Dr. Jason Woodrue]]. Isley, a shy girl, is easily seduced by her professor. Woodrue injects Isley with poisons and toxins as an experiment, causing her transformation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mykey3000.com/cosmicteams/docs/swampthing.html Swamp Thing Chronology&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060502074552/http://www.mykey3000.com/cosmicteams/docs/swampthing.html |date=May 2, 2006 }}, Mykey3000.com&lt;/ref&gt; She nearly dies twice as a result of these poisonings, driving her insane. Later, Woodrue flees from the authorities leaving Isley in the hospital for six months. Enraged at the betrayal, she suffers from violent mood swings, being sweet one moment and evil the next. When her boyfriend has a car accident after mysteriously suffering from a massive [[fungus|fungal]] overgrowth, Isley drops out of school and leaves Seattle, eventually settling in Gotham City.&lt;ref name=LotDK&gt;''Legends of the Dark Knight'' #43&lt;/ref&gt;

She begins her criminal career by threatening to release her suffocating spores into the air unless the city meets her demands. Batman, who appears in Gotham that very same year, thwarts her scheme, and she is incarcerated in [[Arkham Asylum]].&lt;ref name=SotB&gt;''Shadow of the Bat Annual'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; From this point on, she has a kind of obsession with Batman, he being the only person she could not control. Over the years, she develops plant-like superpowers, the most noticeable being a lethal toxin in her lips; she is literally able to kill with a kiss.

In subsequent issues, she states that she only started a life of crime to attain sufficient funds to find a location to be alone with her plants, undisturbed by humanity. A few years later, she attempts to leave Gotham forever, escaping Arkham to settle on a desert island in the [[Caribbean]]. She transforms the barren wasteland into a second [[Garden of Eden|Eden]], and is, for the first time in her life, happy. It is soon firebombed, however, when an American-owned corporation tests their weapons systems out on what they think is an abandoned island. Ivy returns to Gotham with a vengeance, punishing those responsible. After being willingly apprehended by Batman, she resolves that she can never leave Gotham, at least not until the world was safe for plants. From then on, she dedicates herself to the impossible mission of "purifying" Gotham.&lt;ref name=BP&gt;''Batman: Poison Ivy''&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point, Batman travels to Seattle to ascertain information on Pamela Isley's life before she became Poison Ivy. Here, Batman states that both of Pamela's parents are dead. When and why they died has been left undetermined.&lt;ref name=LotDK /&gt;

While in Arkham, Poison Ivy receives a [[Language of flowers|message through flowers]] that someone is to help her escape. That night, two women, Holly and Eva, successfully break Ivy out and bring her back to their employer. She is less than happy to discover that it is the [[Floronic Man]], formerly known as Dr. Jason Woodrue, her former college professor that conducted the experiments on her. The only human portion of him remaining is his head, while the rest of his body is plant-based.

After striking a deal with him in the underground tunnels of Gotham, Ivy receives a trunk full of money in return for samples of her [[DNA]]. Woodrue intends to combine their DNA to create a "child", all while flooding the streets of Gotham with high-grade [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. The purpose of this is to create a world economy run on [[hemp]] and to have their offspring control it. Batman intervenes, but is overcome by Woodrue's henchwomen, Holly and Eva. However, Ivy turns on Floronic Man and lets Batman go to fight the intoxicated maniac. In the end, Batman decapitates the Floronic Man, and Ivy escapes with her money.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: Shadow of the Bat'' #56–58&lt;/ref&gt;

At times, Ivy demonstrates positive and maternal traits. When [[Gotham City]] is destroyed in an [[No Man's Land (comics)|earthquake]], rather than fight over territory like most of Batman's enemies, she holds dominion over Robinson Park and turns it into a tropical paradise. Sixteen children who are orphaned during the quake come to live with her as she sympathizes with them having suffered a [[Psychological trauma|traumatic]] childhood herself.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Files 1998''&lt;/ref&gt; She cares for them like sons and daughters, despite her usual [[misanthropy]].

That winter, [[Clayface]] (Basil Karlo) pays Ivy a visit, hoping to form a bargain with her. This would entail her growing fruits and vegetables, having the orphans harvest them, and him selling the produce to the highest bidder. She wants nothing to do with the plan, and she attempts to kill him with a kiss. Clayface overpowers her, however, and imprisons Ivy and the orphans for six months in a chamber under the park's lake. He feeds her salt and keeps her from the sun to weaken her. Eventually, Batman comes and discovers the imprisoned orphans and Ivy. The two agree to work together to take Karlo down. Batman battles Clayface and instructs [[Tim Drake|Robin]] to blow up the lake bed above, allowing the rushing water to break apart the mud, effectively freeing Ivy. She fights Karlo, ensnaring him in the branches of a tree and fatally kissing him. She then proceeds to sink him down into the ground, where he becomes fertilizer for Ivy's plants. Batman, originally intending to take the orphans away from Ivy, recognizes that staying with her is what is best for them, and they remain in her care until the city is restored. Also, as part of a bargain to keep her freedom, Batman arranges it so that Ivy provides fresh produce to the starving hordes of earthquake survivors.&lt;ref name=FotE&gt;''Batman: Shadow of the Bat'' #88, ''Detective Comics'' #735&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Greg Rucka|Rucka, Greg]] | Artist = [[Dan Jurgens|Jurgens, Dan]] [[Bill Sienkiewicz|Sienkiewicz, Bill]] | Story = Batman #568 | Title = | Volume = 1 | Issue = 568 | Date = 199 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel = | ID = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Soon after, Ivy finds [[Harley Quinn]], who had almost been murdered by [[Joker (character)|the Joker]], among the debris of the earthquake and nurses her back to health. The two have been best friends and partners-in-crime ever since.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: Harley Quinn''&lt;/ref&gt;

After Gotham City is reopened to the public, the city council wants to evict her from the park and send her back to Arkham Asylum, as they are uncomfortable with the thought of a "[[psychosis|psychotic]] eco-terrorist controlling the equivalent of 30-odd square blocks." They also mistakenly believe that the orphans in Ivy's care are hostages. The [[Gotham City Police Department]] threaten to spray the park with R.C. Sixty, a powerful [[herbicide]] that most certainly would have killed every living plant in the park, including Ivy, and more than likely do harm to the children. Ivy refuses to leave the park to the city and let them destroy the paradise she had created, so she chooses [[martyr]]dom. It is only after Rose, one of the orphans, is accidentally poisoned by Ivy that the hardened eco-terrorist surrenders herself to the authorities in order to save the girl's life. Batman says that, as much as she would hate to admit it, Ivy is still more human than plant.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' #751–752&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on, she and other Gotham characters are manipulated by the [[Riddler]] and [[Hush (comics)|Hush]]. Her task is to [[hypnosis|hypnotize]] both [[Superman]] and [[Catwoman]], using Catwoman to steal ransom money from [[Killer Croc]] after the original plan is interrupted by Batman while Superman serves as a 'bodyguard' when she hides in Metropolis. However, she abandons Catwoman to be killed by Killer Croc, and Batman is able to keep Superman busy in a fight (aided by the [[Kryptonite]] ring he was given long ago) long enough for the Man of Steel to break out of the spell. Soon afterwards, the Riddler, who is being chased and attacked by [[Hush (comics)|Hush]], approaches Ivy and seeks her protection. Ivy, who is angered by the manipulation, battles the Riddler physically and psychologically. She comes to physically dominate her opponent, humiliating Riddler and temporarily breaking his spirit.&lt;ref name=Low&gt;''Detective Comics'' #797–799&lt;/ref&gt;

Poison Ivy comes to believe that her powers are killing the children she had looked after, so she seeks Bruce Wayne's help to reverse her powers and make her a normal human being once more. Soon after, she is convinced by Hush to take another serum to restore her powers and apparently dies in the process. However, in ''Batman: Gotham Knights'', when her grave is visited shortly thereafter, it is covered with ivy, creating the impression her death would be short-lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = Lieberman, A.

Shortly after, Poison Ivy appears briefly in Robinson Park, killing two corrupt cops who killed one of her orphans (although whether this takes place before or after the aforementioned storyline is unknown).&lt;ref name=GC&gt;''Gotham Central'' #32&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[One Year Later]]", Ivy is alive and active. Her control over flora has increased, referred to as being on a par with [[Swamp Thing]] or Floronic Man. She also appears to have resumed her crusade against the corporate enemies of the environment with a new [[fanaticism]], regarding Batman no longer as a main opponent, but as a "hindrance".&lt;ref name="OYL"/&gt; After arriving back from a year-long absence, Batman discovers that Ivy has been feeding people including "tiresome lovers", "incompetent henchmen", and those who "returned her smile" to a giant plant which would digest the victims slowly and painfully. She refers to these murders as a "guilty pleasure". In an unprecedented event, her victims' souls merge with the plant, creating a botanical monster called ''Harvest'', who seeks revenge upon Poison Ivy. With the intervention of Batman however, she is saved. Poison Ivy is left in critical condition, and the whereabouts of Harvest are unknown.&lt;ref name="OYL"&gt;{{cite web | first=Ray | last=Tate |url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/reviews/11578374516654.htm | title=Detective Comics #823 |accessdate=2008-05-06|date=September 9, 2006|publisher=Comics Bulletin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other storylines===
In ''Countdown #37'', the [[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]] and the [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]] are hiding out in a greenhouse, picking fruits and vegetables from the plants. They run into Ivy, who is talking to her plants (presumably being told that Piper and Trickster hurt them), to which she reacts by tying them up in vines with the intention of killing them. She is then shown to have joined the Injustice League Unlimited and is one of the villains featured in ''[[Salvation Run]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Paul Dini|Dini, Paul]] [[Adam Beechen|Beechen, Adam]] | Penciller = Giffen, Keith, Lopez, David, Norton, Mike | Inker = Hillsmen, Don Ramos, Rodney | Story = Forbidden Fruit | Title = Countdown #37 | Volume = 1 | Issue = 37 | Date = August 2007 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel = | ID = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the "Battle for the Cowl" storyline, she is coerced by a new [[Black Mask II|Black Mask]] into joining his group of villains that aims to take over Gotham. She and [[Killer Croc]] unsuccessfully attempt to murder [[Damian Wayne]].

Shortly after, she escapes from Black Mask's control and forms an alliance with [[Catwoman]] and [[Harley Quinn]], leading into the ongoing series ''Gotham City Sirens''.

During Hush's ploy to hurt Batman through hurting his loved ones, Hush kidnaps Catwoman and surgically removes her heart. After being saved by Batman, she is operated on by some of the most gifted surgeons in the world, including [[Doctor Mid-Nite]] and [[Mister Terrific (comics)|Mr. Terrific]]. [[Zatanna]] also gives her a magic antidote to help heal her wounds. In order to get even with Hush, Selina enlists the help of Poison Ivy, [[Harley Quinn]], [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]], [[Holly Robinson (comics)|Holly Robinson]], and [[Slam Bradley]] to track down all of Hush's accounts, pilfer them, and leave him penniless. Selina pays Holly, Harley, and Ivy over $30 million each, hoping that they would use the funds to leave Gotham to start fresh somewhere else.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = Paul Dini | Penciller = [[Dustin Nguyen (artist)|Dustin Nguyen]] | Inker = Derek Fridolfs | Story = Heart of Hush, Part V of V: The Demon in the Mirror | Title = Detective Comics #850 | Volume = 1 | Issue = 850 | Date = January 2009 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel = | ID = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Harley uses her money to go on a shopping spree, while Ivy gives her money away to organizations in [[Madagascar]] and [[Costa Rica]] for reforestation.

After rescuing Catwoman from Boneblaster, a new villain trying to make a name for himself, Poison Ivy takes Catwoman back to Edward Nigma's townhouse. When there, Catwoman sees that Ivy has been keeping the Riddler under mind control so that she and Harley could use his townhouse as a hideout. Here, Catwoman decides that with Gotham City more dangerous than ever with all the gang wars and [[Dick Grayson|a new Batman]], a partnership with the other two women would be advantageous. However, Ivy fears that Catwoman has lost her edge and prowess, and consults with Zatanna on the nature of Catwoman's injuries. Zatanna responds that Catwoman has psychological wounds that would need healing. Ivy resolves that she and Harley would provide Catwoman with "positive female reinforcement". The three then agree to become a team. However, Harley and Ivy have one condition that Catwoman is to reveal to them the true identity of Batman.

Eventually, Ivy and the other Sirens ambush the Riddler at his office (with Ivy using her plants to trust and gag his secretary), telling him that they've been framed for the murder of a young nurse. He agrees to help clear their names, and during the discussion Ivy reveals that she has recently taken up a job at the Gotham division of [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] under an assumed name (Dr. Paula Irving).&lt;ref&gt;''Gotham City Sirens'' #9 (February 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; She is eventually kidnapped and placed in a specialized containment unit by a researcher named Alisa Adams, but escapes and turns the table on her captor by binding her with vines. Ivy initially informs Adams that she plans to kill her, but instead decides to let her live after seeing a photograph of Alisa's young daughter. Ivy then threatens Alisa into keeping her mouth shut about her true identity, telling her that she will change her mind and kill her if she reveals her secret to anyone.&lt;ref&gt;''Gotham City Sirens'' #12 (May 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

When Harley Quinn betrays her friends and breaks into Arkham Asylum with the goal of killing the Joker, she ultimately chooses instead to release Joker from his cell, and together the two orchestrate a violent takeover of the facility.&lt;ref&gt;''Gotham City Sirens'' #20–23 (April–July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Poison Ivy arrives and tries to convince Harley Quinn that the Joker is evil, but Harley Quinn refuses to believe her and knocks Poison Ivy unconscious. After they are defeated by Catwoman and Batman, Catwoman then tells Poison Ivy that they are no longer friends, after Ivy had drugged Catwoman in an attempt to discover Batman's identity. Poison Ivy is taken in Arkham Asylum.&lt;ref name="Gotham City Sirens' 2011"&gt;''Gotham City Sirens'' #24 (June 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Ivy soon escapes and ambushes Harley in her cell, binding and gagging her former friend before she can defend herself. Ivy struggles with the decision to execute Harley for her betrayal, but ultimately releases her after realizing that she is still her friend. Together, the two set off to find Catwoman and make her pay for leaving them behind.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;''Gotham City Sirens'' #25 (July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The two of them find Catwoman and fight her on the streets. While fighting, Catwoman confesses that she saw good in the both of them and only wanted to help them. When she tells them that she only kept tabs on them because Batman wanted to keep them under control, Ivy lashes out onto the city by using giant vines to destroy buildings, cursing at Batman for manipulating her. Batman is about to arrest them, but Catwoman helps the two of them escape.&lt;ref&gt;''Gotham City Sirens'' #26 (August 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The New 52: ''Birds of Prey'', ''Detective Comics'' and ''Poison Ivy: Cycle of Life and Death'' (2011—2016)===
In [[The New 52]] (the 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Poison Ivy is recruited into the covert-ops group known as the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]. Though she is specifically hand-picked by the team's leader [[Black Canary]], the other members of the group protest Ivy's inclusion, citing her violent past and connections to various murders.&lt;ref&gt;''Birds of Prey'' (vol. 3) #3 (November 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; These suspicions are proven correct when Ivy poisons the team and forces them to attack corrupt companies she wants to destroy until Katana apparently kills her.&lt;ref&gt;''Birds of Prey'' (vol. 3) #12 (October 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ivy survives the injuries and returns to Gotham, breaking out [[Clayface|Clayface/Basil Karlo]] in order to manipulate him into becoming her husband. Batman intervenes to help her, mainly because the locations she attacked were the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]]'s properties. Poison Ivy ends up captured by Penguin's men.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' (vol. 2) #14 (January 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; She is buried alive by them, but survives long enough to be rescued by Penguin's right-hand man [[Emperor Blackgate|Emperor Penguin]] who has taken over his boss' businesses after [[Death of the Family|the Joker's return]]. He proposes an alliance with her.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' (vol. 2) #15 (February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; However, Karlo, who Batman had set free from Ivy's control, tracks down and attacks Poison Ivy.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' (vol. 2) #16 (March 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

The character's origin, in this new [[DC Comics|DC]] universe, was presented in a special issue of ''[[Detective Comics]]'' (#23.1), during the "Villains Month" event in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' (vol. 2) #23.1 (September 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In this timeline of [[The New 52]], Pamela Isley was born with a skin condition that prevented her from leaving her home. The garden was the place where she spent most of her limited time outside. Her father constantly beat her mother until he finally murdered her and buried her in the garden. While in college, Pamela sold pheromone pills to other students to study its effects until she was caught by police. She used a powerful version of the pills to mind-control the dean so he would drop the charges and let her graduate from college with honors. While visiting her father in prison, she kissed him with a poison that was secreted from her lips that killed him.

Later she landed an internship in Wayne Enterprises in its Bio-Chemistry division developing pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications. She was fired after proposing Bruce Wayne to develop chemicals that could brainwash people by triggering social or behavioral responses from them. As she was escorted out by security, she accidentally spilled the chemicals she was working with on herself, giving her powers to control plant life and immunity to all poisons and viruses.

====''Cycle of Life and Death''====
[[File:Poison Ivy Pamela Isley.png|thumb|175px|left|Poison Ivy as Dr. Pamela Isley, PhD (March 2016). Art by Clay Mann and Seth Mann.]]
In January 2016, DC Comics debuted Ivy's first six-issue miniseries, ''[[Poison Ivy: Cycle of Life and Death]]''. As Dr. Pamela Isley, PhD, she joins the prestigious plant sciences department at Gotham Botanical Gardens, but things quickly get complicated when Luisa Cruz, Ivy's friend and mentor, is murdered via poisoning. Ivy investigates whilst working on her latest project, successfully giving life to two children who are plant-human hybrids like herself, as well as her biological daughters. Ivy names them Rose and Hazel.

With the help of Selina Kyle and fellow researcher, Darshan, she finds that the Gotham Botanical Gardens were performing experiments which resulted in creating another plant-human hybrid named Thorn. Ivy destroys the laboratory and rescues the child. Ivy raises Rose, Hazel and Thorn who grow to adult size at an exponential rate, becoming young women within 35 weeks. When the girls sneak out to see Gotham City at night for the first time, they cause an incident at a strip club that gets the police involved and Ivy has to help them escape.

Returning to the apartment, Ivy locks Rose, Hazel and Thorn away so they will not leave again. Ivy finds Doctor Eric Grimley - Chair of the Gotham Botanical Gardens Research Department - waiting on her balcony and he attacks her. Grimley had transformed himself into a large plant-like monster to escape dying from cancer. Grimley murdered Luisa because she was suspicious of the experiments he was performing and now, with his cancer returning, intends to harvest Rose, Thorn, and Hazel for spores to help escape death again.

Darshan arrives and releases the girls, who help Ivy fight Grimley along with [[Swamp Thing]] - who seeks to punish Grimley for wanting to defy nature by escaping the cycle of life and death. Together they defeat Grimley, with Thorn hacking him up with a machete for the experiments she was put through.

Darshan later helps Rose, Thorn, and Hazel leave Ivy, reasoning that they were getting so restless they'd go eventually with or without his help, and they set off away from Gotham to places unknown, claiming they planned to live out their lives regardless of how short they may be.

===DC Universe===
DC Comics began the next relaunch of its entire line of titles called [[DC Rebirth]] in June 2016. DC opted to rebrand its titles under the "DC Universe" name in December 2017, using the continuity established from DC Rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnston|first=Rich|title=The End Of DC Rebirth Announced At New York Comic-Con|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/10/06/end-dc-rebirth-announced-new-york-comic-con|website=bleedingcool|accessdate=March 11, 2018|date=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bonthuys|first=Darryn|title=The Rebirth era is over, as a new direction begins in DC Universe|url=https://www.criticalhit.net/comics-toys/rebirth-era-new-direction-begins-dc-universe|website=criticalhit|accessdate=March 11, 2018|date=December 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the DC Universe, Poison Ivy appears in the first story arc of ''[[Trinity (comic book)|Trinity]]'' vol. 2 (issues 1-6), trying to create a portal between a dream world inhabited by an entity of the Green called White Mercy which is related to the Black Mercy plant. She builds the portal at an old shed at Clark Kent's farmhouse but doesn't realise that Diana, Clark and Bruce Wayne are actually the Trinity. It is later revealed that this is a plan orchestrated by Mongul trying to conquer Earth using Superman as a vessel. With the help of Poison Ivy and the White Mercy entity, Mongul is stopped, but Poison Ivy loses her memories of this incident.

She later appears in ''Batgirl'' #6 where she teams up with Batgirl to save an airplane and its passengers from a plant that is growing uncontrollably in the cargo bay. It is hinted that she knows Batgirl's true identity, but decides to keep it a secret. Poison Ivy is also a recurrent character in the ''Harley Quinn'' series and Harley's main love interest, though the two are not exclusive.

In ''All Star Batman'' #7 Batman is asking for Poison Ivy's help as a scientist so he can stop a deadly virus that is threatening to destroy the planet. After helping him and manufacturing the cure, Batman promises to clear her name.

Poison Ivy appears in "The War of Jokes and Riddles" story arc of ''Batman'', where she allied herself with the [[Riddler]] in his war against the [[Joker (character)|Joker]].&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' #26, 28, 29, 31 (September–November 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; In the arc, when the Riddler was trying to convince her to join his side, she is seen stopping [[Carmine Falcone]]'s men—who are sent to kill the Riddler—by capturing them in vines.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' #26 (September 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

Poison Ivy appears in the "Gotham Resistance" tie-in story arc for ''[[Dark Nights: Metal]]'', where she controls a jungle-like realm within a [[Gotham City]] warped by the dark energy emitted from the dark metal in the cards given by the Batman Who Laughs to various enemies of Batman including Poison Ivy herself. Poison Ivy captures [[Harley Quinn]]—who realizes that Poison Ivy isn't herself—[[Green Arrow]], [[Nightwing]], [[Damian Wayne|Robin]], and [[Killer Croc]] as they try to solve what's going on and stop it. They manage to escape when Poison Ivy violently reacts to her plants being harmed during an attack by several members of the [[Teen Titans]] and [[Suicide Squad]], who all also have been twisted, as well as a Dark Robin.&lt;ref&gt;''Suicide Squad'' #16 (November 2017); ''Green Arrow'' #32 (December 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the "Source Code" story arc of ''[[Batgirl and the Birds of Prey]]'', Poison Ivy has infiltrated and was trying to take down Terracare, a company whose fertilizers had a secret ingredient destructive to bee populations. She comes across the Birds of Prey—[[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Huntress]], [[Black Canary]], and [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]]—and [[Catwoman]] who were trying to save the [[Calculator (comics)|Calculator]]'s family held hostage by Terracare. Earlier, Terracare had traced back a data breach to the Calculator—who sold the information to Catwoman, which she used to steal a vial of the ingredient from Terracare for Poison Ivy—so the company demanded the return of their stolen items in exchange for his family. After they stopped those responsible at Terracare, Batgirl arranges that Poison Ivy becomes the chemist in charge of the fertilizers.&lt;ref&gt;''Batgirl and the Birds of Prey'' #12–13 (September–October 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; After this arc, Poison Ivy is occasionally seen working at Terracare or helping the Birds of Prey against villains, such as the Daughters of Gotham or the Calculator.&lt;ref&gt;''Batgirl and the Birds of Prey'' #14–17 (November 2017 – February 2018), #19 (April 2018), #21–22 (June–July 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the "Unnatural Disaster" storyline of ''Damage'', Poison Ivy has fallen under the influence of forces that led to a desire to destroy humanity. She partnered with [[Gorilla Grodd]] for that intend. They fought against Damage (Ethan Avery) who is trying to protect people from them. However, Poison Ivy eventually resists the control of these forces, as she thinks that people are worth saving and doesn't want to be a killer. At the end, [[Alec Holland (comics)|Swamp Thing (Alec Holland)]] reveals to Ethan Avery that the [[Parliament of Trees#The Green|Green]] is trying to change Poison Ivy but hasn't succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;''Damage'' #4–6 (June–August 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Batman'' #41&amp;ndash;43 features a Poison Ivy arc titled "Everyone Loves Ivy". Fueled by her guilt over the men she thought she killed in "The War of Jokes and Riddles", Poison Ivy uses her powers to take control of everyone on earth, except Batman and Catwoman. With the help of Harley Quinn, Batman and Catwoman convince Poison Ivy to release the world from her control. At the end of arc, Poison Ivy enters a facility known as the Sanctuary for rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/batman-cat-woman-poison-ivy-hero-villain/|title=Batman's Rogues Gallery Has Lost a Villain, But Gotham's Gained a Hero|work=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=March 21, 2018|first=Jim|last=Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Heroes in Crisis]]'', at the mental health institution Sanctuary, Poison Ivy is seen giving a confession in which she states that she shouldn't be there because they are made for heroes and she is a terrorist. Earlier, [[Harley Quinn]] had told Poison Ivy to go to Sanctuary and followed her there. In the aftermath of several murders at Sanctuary, [[Booster Gold]] seeks out the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash (Barry Allen)]] in his effort to solve the situation. He explains to him that either Harley or maybe he himself killed everyone, mentioning "Ivy" and a few other names of those killed. In contrast, Harley Quinn is convinced that Booster Gold had killed those people and lets herself be found by Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman to reveal this to them before escaping. Later, while standing on a bridge, Harley Quinn regretfully reflects upon Poison Ivy as she drops a red rose into the water.&lt;ref&gt;''Heroes in Crisis'' #2 (December 2018). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Harley Quinn'' features Ivy several times first as Harley's best friend and then lover. Ivy has helped Harley out on several adventures between her ecological terrorism gigs back in Harley's new home on Coney Island. She helps Harley explain to the local assassins that Harley posted her own bounty while sleepwalking and that trying to kill her would just lead to their deaths and no pay day. Harley rescued her from a super villain's mind control while Ivy was secretly held prisoner and used by said villain in Arkham. She assisted in hiring the Gang of Harleys and nursing Harley back to health when Captain Strong's mutant possibly alien seaweed put her in the hospital. She and Catwoman joined Harley on a road trip when Harley's uncle died and found that while both she and Harley are immune to most toxins, that does not include some secret drink brewed up on an Indian reservation. She and Harley were invited to spend a romantic week in Bermuda on a nudist colony by Sy Borgman. When there was a dispute over some real-estate Ivy helped turn it into protected swampland. Also when Penguin attacked new York with giant killer penguins she helped out by growing a giant daisy in what their friend Eggy called the worst Kaiju fight ever.

==Activism==
Ivy calls herself an "eco-terrorist of global importance" and has demonstrated philanthropic contributions to conservation efforts. A [[Gotham Girls]] episode "[https://web.archive.org/web/20150224155235/http://www2.warnerbros.com/gothamgirls/play/files/GG_09.swf Pave Paradise]" has her going out of her way to get Gotham's mayor to prevent bulldozing of a park because he swore he would not do it in his election campaign. In ''[[Gotham City Sirens]]'', Ivy reveals that she donated her $30 million share of [[Hush (DC Comics)|Hush]]'s money to a reforestation fund.&lt;ref name="gcs1"&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = Paul Dini | Penciller = Guillem March | Inker = Guillem March | Story = | Title = [[Gotham City Sirens]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = 1 | Date = June 24, 2009 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel = | ID = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
[[File:Poison Ivy (character).png|thumb|175px|Poison Ivy with plant vines extending over her arms and legs (2016).&lt;ref name="Poison Ivy: Cycle of Life and Death 2"&gt;''Poison Ivy: Cycle of Life and Death'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; Art by Clay Mann and Seth Mann.]]
The experiments that transformed Dr. Isley introduced a mixture of several potent toxins originating from a selection of venomous predators and poisonous plant life into her bloodstream to act as a [[mutagen]]; making her touch deadly while also giving her a superhuman [[immune system]]. This immunity also extends to synthetic toxins such as Joker venom.&lt;ref name=Harl13&gt;''Harley Quinn'' #13&lt;/ref&gt; Some versions of the character show her as more plant than human, such as breathing [[carbon dioxide]] and undergoing [[photosynthesis]] as well as having a more plantlike appearance with [[aloe]] blood and [[chlorophyll]] skin.

Poison Ivy's body produces [[pheromone]]s that make people susceptible to [[mind control]] around her, especially men, although strong-minded people like Batman are usually capable of resisting. She specializes in hybrids and can create the most potent floral toxins in [[Gotham City]], ranging from truth serums and love potions. Often these toxins are secreted from her lips and administered in her preferred way, a poisonous kiss, usually after professing false love or affection for her victim. They come in a number of varieties, from mind-controlling drugs to instantly fatal toxins.

She has the ability to mentally control all forms of plant life on a molecular level. This plant growth can occur in an instant, allowing her to use plants in the environment to attack or ensnare her opponents, and even to create powerful new plant hybrids for specialized purposes. In volume three of ''Batman'', she causes giant plant roots to become uprooted at a moment's notice, and directs the roots to entangle her enemies.&lt;ref name="Batman vol 3 27"&gt;''Batman'' vol. 3, #27&lt;/ref&gt; While in Arkham Asylum, she manipulates and animates plants, using roots to form supports for a tunnel she and another inmate named [[Magpie (comics)|Magpie]] dig to escape, and also spawning glowing fungi to entertain Magpie.&lt;ref name=AALH&gt;''Arkham Asylum: Living Hell''&lt;/ref&gt; Plant vines are also commonly seen extending over her limbs and neck, creating part of her overall appearance.&lt;ref name="Poison Ivy: Cycle of Life and Death 2"&gt;''Poison Ivy: Cycle of Life and Death'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; She controlled an entire tree to come down on Clayface, ensnaring him in its branches, and once brought a whole skyscraper down with giant vines.

Poison Ivy is identified by the [[Swamp Thing]] as a being with an elemental mystical component, whom he calls the "[[May Queen]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Black Orchid'' (vol. 2), 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Writers have not referred to her in this way in quite some time. She has shown an ability to use the Green, a force connected to plant life. Ivy is able to communicate over great distances with this talent, as she manifests in a vase of roses in [[Zatanna]]'s dressing room to talk to the magician.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = Paul Dini | Penciller = Guillem March | Inker = Guillem March | Story = Union | Title = Gotham City Sirens #1 | Volume = 1 | Issue = 1 | Date = August 2009 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel = | ID = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character carries a certain number of live [[vine]]s: coupled with her natural ability to commune with plant life, they act as weaponry, or defensive/grabbing appendages. Their supply is, however, limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = Dini, Paul | Penciller = Guillem March | Inker = Guillem March | Story = Union | Title = Gotham City Sirens #6 | Volume = 1 | Issue = 6 | Date = January 2010 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel = | ID = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond her metahuman traits, Ivy is shown to be exceptionally physically fit both due to gymnastics and her enhanced health; being both similar to Harley Quinn in skill as well as showing enough hand-to-hand combat prowess to challenge Batman without relying solely on her powers.

==Romantic relationships==

===Batman===
Although Poison Ivy has been historically portrayed as a supervillainess, [[Batman]] and Poison Ivy have worked together in achieving common goals and are frequently depicted as having a romantic relationship. While not at the same level as his relationship with [[Catwoman]], Batman's attraction to Ivy is present in some way. 

In her first appearance, Poison Ivy is established as having an attraction to Batman, and tries to convince Batman to join her side and creates love potions that ensnare him. &lt;ref name=16things&gt;{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/batman-poison-ivy-facts-trivia/|title=16 Things You Didn’t Know About Poison Ivy|work=[[Screen Rant]]|date=October 7, 2017|first=Britt|last=Poteet}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In one of the annuals of ''[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat]]'', a mutual attraction between Poison Ivy and the Batman is obvious right from the start.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: Shadow of the Bat'' 1995 Annual #3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Batman 1997 graphic novel: Poison Ivy&lt;/ref&gt; ]

In the 1989 story, ''Batman: Poison Ivy'', Christopher DeJardin tries to kill Ivy, and Batman takes the bullet. Batman, who was wearing body armor, knocks him out. Ivy considers his saving her from death as proof he loves her, though he responds that that she doesn't know the meaning of the word.

In ''Batman: Hothouse'' (1992), Batman gains an obsession with Isley. Later, she kisses him. Now completely deranged, Ivy thinks herself "Titania, Queen of the May", and Batman her Oberon - as Batman struggles with the hallucinations induced by the kiss, she pins him down and prepares to unmask him. With his last burst of strength, Batman kicks the greenhouse's sprinklers on, washing away Ivy's pheromones. The sobered Batman chases an increasingly desperate Ivy onto the greenhouse's catwalks, where he barely manages to save Ivy from falling to her death. Subsequently, Ivy is returned to Arkham Asylum, her twisted love for Batman stronger than ever.

In the 2004 story ''[[Batman/Poison Ivy: Cast Shadows]]'', Batman and Ivy work together to find a killer carrying out a series of Ivy-like murders at [[Arkham Asylum|Arkham]]. Batman gets poisoned by the flowers, and he has to kiss Poison Ivy for the cure. Ivy insists for him to trust her, despite Batman's doubts. Batman at first decides to punch her, hesitates, then willingly shares a kiss with her instead, curing him, but when — assuming Batman dead — Poison Ivy tries to kill herself, once more insinuating that it is more than just lust she feels for him. Later, Ivy returns to Arkham to finish her rehabilitation, but some "anonymous benefactor" makes sure her time there isn't as daunting as it might have been. Ivy discovers that Batman filled her cell with flowers as a gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/series/20034/ |title=Batman / Poison Ivy: Cast Shadows |publisher=Comics.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Gothtopia'', Batman comes to her rescue when he realizes she was telling him the truth, even though he put her in Arkham. First she punches him for not believing her claims, and then she kisses him for coming to her rescue, poisoning him with her mind control toxin. Resisting it, he warns that they would be best off helping each other for now. Thanks to her own resistance and the kiss he received, both Batman and Ivy become immune to Scarecrow's gas effect.

===Harley Quinn===
Prior to the [[The New 52|New 52]] reboot, Ivy is sometimes shown as romantically involved with [[Harley Quinn]].&lt;ref name=cbrbrian&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/harley-quinn-and-poison-ivy-a-history/|title=Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy: A History|date=December 18, 2016|work=[[Comic Book Resources]]|first=Brian|last=Cronin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/08/harley-quinn-suicide-squad-margot-robbie-domestic-violence|title=Is Suicide Squad's Harley Quinn the Most Divisive Character in Comic-Book History?|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=August 3, 2016|first=Joanna|last=Robinson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=16things/&gt; Unlike most villain team-ups, their partnership seems to be based on genuine friendship.

Accordingly, Poison Ivy despises the Joker, and the two exchange vicious banter at every opportunity. In the final storyline of the ''[[Gotham City Sirens]]'' series, Harley suggests that Ivy may be in love with her, an accusation that stuns her.&lt;ref name="Gotham City Sirens' 2011"/&gt; The following issue has Poison Ivy acknowledge that she may indeed love Harley, but the details of her love are never specified.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

In ''Harley Quinn'' #8, Harley went on a vacation with Ivy to a nudist colony in which she tried to convince Ivy to move in with her, but while Ivy admitted that she loves Harley more than any other person on Earth and would love to spend as much time with her as possible, she is currently more dedicated to saving the environment. Harley was disappointed and very sad, but accepted it and the two parted with promises to meet again.&lt;ref name=cbrbrian/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/24269-harley-quinn-poison-ivy-dating-break-up-dc-comics|title=Poison Ivy Brutally Dumped Part-Time Girlfriend Harley Quinn|work=[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]]|date=November 23, 2016|first=Emily|last=Gaudette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She mentions in "House and Garden" where she ostensibly reforms that her hyper-immune system has left her [[infertility|unable to bear children]].&lt;ref name="House and Garden"&gt;{{cite episode|title=House and Garden|series=Batman: The Animated Series|credits=Paul Dini, Boyd Kirkland, Dong Yang|network=Fox|airdate=1994-05-02|season=2|number=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
[[File:Poison Ivy2.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Uma Thurman]] as Poison Ivy in ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman &amp; Robin]]'' (1997)]]
* [[Uma Thurman]] played Poison Ivy in the 1997 film ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman &amp; Robin]]''. Dr. Pamela Isley is a botanist, working for [[Wayne Enterprises]]' arboreal preservation project in South America. She is experimenting with Venom to create animal-plant [[cross-breeding]]s capable of fighting back and protecting the world's plants from "the thoughtless ravages of man". However, her senior colleague, Dr. [[Floronic Man|Jason Woodrue]], steals some of her Venom samples in order to transform a prisoner into [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]. Isely is outraged that her research has been corrupted, and when she rejects Woodrue's advances, he tries to murder her by sending her crashing into shelves lined with beakers containing Venom and other animal-plant toxins and chemicals. She is transformed into a poisonous hybrid of human and plant. Replacing her blood with aloe, her skin with chlorophyll and filled her lips with venom, making her kiss poisonous. She kills Woodrue by kissing him with her poisonous lips, and vows to establish botanical supremacy over the world. She allies herself with Bane and [[Mr. Freeze]], and plans to freeze the Earth with a giant freezing cannon, which will destroy the human race and enable Poison Ivy's mutant plants to "overrun the globe". She ensures Freeze's cooperation by pulling the plug on his [[Nora Fries|cryogenically frozen wife]], and convincing him that Batman had done it. Ivy then lures an infatuated [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] to her garden hideout and tries to kill him with a venomous kiss; the attempt fails, however, as Robin had coated his lips with rubber. A furious Ivy throws Robin into her lily pond and entangles Batman in her vines, but they are able to free themselves when Batgirl unexpectedly arrives and traps the villainess in her own floral throne. After Batman, Robin and Batgirl foil the villains' plan, Ivy is imprisoned in Arkham Asylum with a vengeful Freeze as her cellmate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=[[Janet Maslin]] | title = Batman and Robin |work=The New York Times | date = June 20, 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Poison Ivy is one of the many villains broken out of Arkham by the Joker and [[Lex Luthor]] in ''[[Lego Batman: The Movie - DC Super Heroes Unite]]''. She, along with the rest of the rogues gallery, battles with Batman and [[Tim Drake|Robin]] but is recaptured before escaping the grounds.
* The ''[[Batman: Arkham]]'' franchise version of Poison Ivy makes a cameo appearance in ''[[Batman: Assault on Arkham]]''. When the Joker releases all the inmates at the Asylum, Ivy goes to the greenhouse. Two guards are there and she approaches them and users her vines on them. Later, she kisses guards and inmates with her mind control-lipstick, to possess other inmates to do her bidding and escape from Arkham.
* Poison Ivy appears in ''[[Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League: Gotham City Breakout]]'' with [[Vanessa Marshall]] reprising her role from ''Batman: The Brave and the Bold''.

During the battle at the Gotham Energy facility, she tries to kiss [[Batman]], only for Batman to block it with several of the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]]'s hench-penguins, whom she continues to kiss and poison. She is sent to [[Arkham Asylum]] with the rest of the Rogues after Joker forces everyone to turn themselves in. She is later broken out to assist Batman in defeating the Joker, [[Harley Quinn]] and the army of Uber villains. They manage to succeed and, in celebration, she kisses a man, which accidentally poisons him. She and the Rogues reconcile with Joker and leave, with Batman giving them a thirty-minute head start.

* Poison Ivy has two cameo appearances in ''[[Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu]]'', first as a hallucination induced by the Scarecrow, and later as an imprisoned inmate of Arkham Asylum.
* In ''[[Batman: Gotham City Racer]]'', Poison Ivy's vehicle was playable.
She is able to jump higher than any other character (an ability given to all female villains), increase the growth rate of particular plants, blow long-range poison kisses, and give up-close poison kisses to foes which, in turn, fall apart.
* Poison Ivy appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]'', voiced by [[Cyndi Williams]]. Sketches of her are viewable on the official website.
* Poison Ivy is a playable character in the multiplayer online battle arena game ''[[Infinite Crisis (video game)|Infinite Crisis]]'', with [[Tasia Valenza]] reprising her role from the ''[[Batman: Arkham]]'' series.

====''Lego DC'' series====
* Poison Ivy is a playable character in ''[[Lego Batman: The Videogame]]'' with her sound effects done by [[Vanessa Marshall]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Game Informer]]'' features a two-page gallery of the many heroes and villains who appear in the game with a picture for each character and a descriptive paragraph. See "''LEGO Batman'': Character Gallery", ''Game Informer'' 186 (October 2008): 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Her abilities are double jump, immunity to toxins, poison kiss (which only works on enemies right in front of her), making guards open love doors (not mind-control), and she is the only character that can make plants grow. She works for the [[Riddler]], and is the fourth [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] of Chapter 1 "The Riddler's Revenge." She appears in the hero story right after [[Two-Face]] is defeated where she aids in the Riddler's escape from [[Batman]] and [[Robin (character)|Robin]] by dropping a seed right in front of him and making a giant vine grow under his feet, lifting him onto a rooftop where Poison Ivy stands. In the Riddler's side of the story, the Riddler assigns her to get some mutated vine seeds from the Botanic Gardens. The two of them attempt to sneak past [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]]. However, the Riddler learns the hard way that stepping on flowers provokes her, and makes her yell at him, getting Commissioner Gordon's attention. After they get the seeds, she stays with the plants, and plays with them, including hugging a tree and lying in falling, red flowers that form into a heart, but not before giving the Riddler the seeds. Back in Batman's side of the story, the dynamic duo finds her, and she drops 3 seeds on the ground; one of them grows into a tiny plant that barks like a puppy dog, but when Robin aims at it, it grows into a giant plant with Poison Ivy riding inside of it, starting the boss fight. The other seeds grow into monster plants as well ,and they spit out seeds that become Poison Ivy's goons, and either hero has to attack them until they become lego pieces that they need to use to build bombs to blow one of the plants up (but the explosions can hurt the heroes too) and Poison Ivy moves into another. After the second plant blows up, Poison Ivy doesn't move into the third one, but she can't be damaged until that one blows up. After all her goons are gone, she can defeated simply by attacking her. After she's defeated, she appears to be injured, and Robin has compassion on her, and attempts to check on her. Unfortunately, it turns out to be a trick, and she has a flower spray love gas at him which makes him fall in love with her. Batman throws a Batarang at her, and tries to make Robin snap out of the love gas (which he does by himself when they chase the Riddler). In the ending cutscene, Poison Ivy is seen in her cell in [[Arkham Asylum]] caring for plants. She's the only female boss that's not featured as a miniboss.
* Poison Ivy appears in ''[[Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Laura Bailey (voice actress)|Laura Bailey]]. In the third level, "[[Arkham Asylum]] Antics" she rides around on [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane's]] Mole Machine along with the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]] and Bane himself. She appears as an optional boss. Once again, she is fought at the Botanic Gardens. Before the fight, she whips a vine around and says, "It's time to go green."
* Poison Ivy appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]'', voiced by [[Tara Strong]]. She appears in side quests alongside [[Swamp Thing]]. 
* Poison Ivy appears in ''[[Lego Dimensions]]''. She is featured in ''The Lego Batman Movie'' adventure pack as the second boss.
* Poison Ivy appears as a both a main character and a boss in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]'', with [[Tasia Valenza]] reprising her role from the ''Batman: Arkham'' series.&lt;ref&gt;[https://screenrant.com/lego-dc-super-villains-video-game-trailer/]&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Batman: Arkham''====
{{Further|Batman: Arkham}}

Poison Ivy appears in the ''Batman: Arkham'' series voiced primarily by [[Tasia Valenza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://918thefan.com/2011/kanas-korner-interview-with-tasia-valenza/|title=91.8 The Fan » Blog Archive » Kana’s Korner – Interview with Tasia Valenza|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Poison Ivy makes her first appearance in ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]''. This iteration's appearance is revamped to a naked-goddess persona, wearing only an orange prison-issued shirt and foliage panties, and her appearance is also more plant-like having green skin, with vine-like growths and leaves on her body. She acts as the penultimate boss. She first appears in the Penitentiary, begging to be released from her cell so she can help her "babies"; she can apparently feel the pain Doctor Young inflicted on the island's plants while creating a Venom-plant hybrid in order to create the Titan drug. She is later released by [[Harley Quinn]], after which she makes a beeline for the Botanical Gardens. [[Batman]] later tracks her down. After some convincing (by way of crushing one of her vines when it tries to attack), she tells Batman that the molds growing in [[Killer Croc]]'s lair can be used to create a Titan antidote. After Batman leaves, the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] arrives and gives Poison Ivy a double-dose of Titan, causing her plants to sprout up randomly and grow to massive proportions, wreaking havoc across the island and destroying the makeshift Batcave in the sewer systems. When Batman returns to stop her, Poison Ivy attacks with spore projectiles, hypnotized guards, and an enormous mutated plant-monster. Batman eventually defeats her, and she can later be seen being returned to her cell.
* Poison Ivy makes her next appearance in ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]''. Her design remains the same except for a crimson colored shirt. She has taken up residence in an abandoned hotel within Arkham City's districts, isolating herself from humanity and relying on thugs seduced with plant toxins for protection. Late in the game's storyline, Poison Ivy forges a shaky alliance with [[Catwoman]] in return for an unusual favor following a brief fight. She promises support from mutated plants if Catwoman will break into [[Hugo Strange]]'s heavily guarded TYGER vault and recover a rare flower which was seized from her upon incarceration. After the player has successfully completed this stage however, Catwoman spitefully reneges on their agreement by destroying the plant rather than attempt escape with it. Poison Ivy is misled into blaming Strange for this calamity and subsequently swears revenge on Gotham City. Her plant shop she owned in her former life can also be located in Arkham City, serving an actual purpose during one of Catwoman's gameplay missions. Poison Ivy also appears in ''[[Batman: Arkham City Lockdown]]'', voiced by [[Amy Carle]].
* Pamela Isley is alluded in ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]''. She is hinted at when the player locates a plant shop owned by her. It is assumed she has yet to undergo her Poison Ivy transformation during this game's time period. The DLC "Cold Cold Heart" also alluded to her via her ID at GothCorp's check-in area.
* Poison Ivy next appears in ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]''. Her design has been altered: her long hair has been cut short and tied above her head, her pigmentation is now a light tint of the color, giving her a more human appearance. Originally, as seen in Harley Quinn's story mission, she was first imprisoned at the Blüdhaven police station, but was soon rescued when Harley fought the entire police department, as well as [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]]. Poison Ivy attended [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow's]] meeting with the other villains, but refused to join in. As a result, Scarecrow had her knocked out and placed in gas chamber to have the new Fear Toxin used on her. However, Batman knocks out the guards and Poison Ivy proves immune to the toxin, allowing Batman to take her to the Isolation Cell at the GCPD. Batman is forced to work together with her in order to stop Scarecrow's citywide fear toxin by helping her awaken two ancient trees that had long since gone dormant. She helps save the city, but sacrifices her life in the process. She dies and disintegrates in Batman's arms after her final act of redemption, stating 'Nature... always... wins". Later in the game, a red flower can be found on the location of her death.

====''Injustice'' series====
* Poison Ivy is alluded in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''. One of her poisonous plants is an interactable item in the [[Arkham Asylum]] stage. Poison Ivy is seen as an unplayable support card in the game's [[iOS]] version depicted with her [[The New 52|New 52]] look, and is mentioned on different [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] missions. 
* Poison Ivy appears as a playable character in ''[[Injustice 2]]'', once again voiced by [[Tasia Valenza]]. In the game's story mode, she allies herself with the [[Secret Society of Super-Villains|Society]] to take over the planet, disappointed that [[Batman]]'s reform from the Regime wasn't environmentally friendly. She battles her fellow Gotham City Sirens, [[Harley Quinn]] and [[Catwoman]] (or [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] depending on who the player chooses). In her single player ending, Poison Ivy makes [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] collect every city on Earth, then kisses Brainiac, killing the Coluan with her poison. She then uses the Earth's plant life to rule the planet.

===Miscellaneous===
* Poison Ivy appears in "The Flower Girl", a story in ''Batman Adventures'' vol. 2, #16. In the story, Poison Ivy is dying from the effects of her own toxins, and makes her way to [[Swamp Thing|Dr. Holland]], who is practicing science in a remote rural cottage. She pleads with Holland to save her life, but he explains to her that there is nothing he can do. Shortly after, she dies in his arms, and collapses into a pile of dead plants. Moments later, another Pamela Isley, whose character design matches her appearance in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', appears. She states that the Ivy who died is a vegetable creature that she had created as a distraction for Batman, in order to start a new life.
* The character also co-starred in the three-issue comic book miniseries ''Harley and Ivy'', and was given her swan song in ''[[The Batman Adventures]]'' comic book series, which contains stories about Batman's adventures in Gotham City after a break from the [[Justice League]].
* Poison Ivy is portrayed by Jaime Lyn Beatty in [[StarKid Productions]]' web-musical, ''[[Holy Musical B@man!]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2448">The '''Purple Earth hypothesis''' is an [[astrobiology|astrobiological]] hypothesis that life forms of early Earth were [[retinal]]-based rather than [[chlorophyll]]-based, making Earth appear purple rather than green. An example of a retinal-based organism today is the photosynthetic microbe collectively called [[halobacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/environment/070410_purple_earth.html LiveScience.com: Early Earth Was Purple, Study Suggests] Accessed May 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sparks, William B.; DasSarma, S.; Reid, I. N.|title=Evolutionary Competition Between Primitive Photosynthetic Systems: Existence of an early purple Earth?|bibcode=2006AAS...209.0605S|website=Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society, Vol. 38, p.901}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lozier|first1=R.H.|last2=Bogomolni|first2=R.A.|last3=Stoeckenius|first3=W.|title=Bacteriorhodopsin: a light-driven proton pump in Halobacterium Halobium|journal=Biophysical Journal|date=September 1975|volume=15|issue=9|pages=955–962|doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(75)85875-9|bibcode=1975BpJ....15..955L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difficulty with this hypothesis is that retinal-based photosynthesis requires either [[arginine]] or oxygen in the environment. As a complex amino acid, arginine is not likely to have been available in the levels needed. Oxygen only became available in earth's environment after the development of chlorophyll-based photosynthesis, and given that retinal organisms also require oxygen to synthesize critical substances for life, the possibility that retinal life-forms could have preceded chlorophyll-based ones as the most common photosynthetic organisms is unlikely.

'''Samuel Brandon''' was a 16th-century  English writer, author of one known play, ''The Virtuous Octavia'', published in 1598.

==''The Virtuous Octavia''==
Nothing is known of Brandon, except that he was the author of ''The Tragi-comœdi of the Virtuous Octavia''. This, his one play, is described by John Joseph Knight in the first edition of ''The Dictionary of National Biography'' as "a work of some merit and of considerable value and rarity."&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; There are no contemporary records of the play, except for its entry in the register of the Stationers' Company for 1598, and it was not reprinted until 1909.&lt;ref name=malone&gt;Introduction to the Malone Society reprint of ''The Virtuous Octavia'', Oxford, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Virtuous Octavia'' is modelled on [[Samuel Daniel]]'s ''Cleopatra''.&lt;ref name=malone/&gt; The plot, taken from the [[The Twelve Caesars|life of Augustus]] by [[Suetonius]], and that of [[Mark Antony]] by [[Plutarch]], follows to some extent classical models. It is set is [[Rome]], and its catastrophe is the death of Mark Antony. The fact that at the close [[Octavia the Younger|the heroine]], who oscillates between love for her husband and jealousy of [[Cleopatra]], is still alive, is the excuse for calling it a [[tragicomedy]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Knight comments that though "weak in structure and deficient in interest, the ''Virtuous Octavia'' has claims to attention as poetry."&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; It is written in [[decasyllabic]] verse with rhymes to alternate lines,&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; with choruses at the end of each act.&lt;ref name=erskine&gt;{{cite book|author=Baker, David Erskine|title=Biographia Dramatica Or a Companion to the Playhouse|date=1812|publisher=Longmann, Hurst|location=London|pages=384–5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eMBTAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA385&amp;lpg=PA385&amp;dq|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Payne Collier]], writing in 1831, noted Brandon's innovative use of [[epithet|compound epithet]]s of a type derived from ancient Greek literature, such as "pearl-dropping showers", "sceptre-bearing hands" and "terror-breeding crown".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Collier|first1=John Payne|title=History of English Dramatic Poetry to the Time of Shakspeare and Annals of the Stage to the Restoration, Volume 3|date=1831|publisher=F. J. Murray, 1831|location=London|pages=257–8|volume=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iOlOAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA249&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two epistles between Octavia and Mark Antony, in an imitation of [[Ovid]]'s style, but written in long [[Alexandrine]]s are appended to the play.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref name=erskine/&gt; These epistles are dedicated "to the honourable, virtuous, and excellent Mrs. Mary Thin", while the play itself is dedicated to Lady Lucia Audelay. At the close of the work are the Italian words: "''L'acqua non temo dell'eterno oblio''",&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;{{cite DNB|first=John Joseph|last= Knight|wstitle=Brandon, Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt; a phrase described in the play's entry in  the ''Biographia Dramatica'' (1812) as "an instance among many of the vanity of authors, who flatter themselves into an imaginary immortality, which frequently terminates even before the close of their mortal existence, much less extends beyond it".&lt;ref name=erskine/&gt;

'''Sandy Shaw''' (formerly '''Sandy Shakocius''') (born 1943) is an American writer on health. She is an advocate of [[life extension]].

==Education==
Sandy Shaw's father was an engineer and her mother a housewife. She received her degree from [[University of California, Los Angeles|U.C.L.A.]] in 1966, with a double major in chemistry and zoology and a minor in mathematics.

== Writing and media appearances==

Shaw is the co-author with [[Durk Pearson]] of several books on "life extension", emphasizing [[Megavitamin therapy|megadoses]] of [[antioxidant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Rh0uAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cGgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6280,1006280&amp;dq=sandy-shaw+life-extension&amp;hl=en|title=How Long A Life? .If Life Extenders Get Their Way, It Could Go On And...And On, And On|last=Lardner|first=James|date=2 June 1983|work=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]|page=1C|accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have appeared on many television programs, including several appearances on [[Larry King Live]]. They have appeared in many TV documentaries about aging, including two by the [[BBC]], one by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], and on Japanese TV. During the period of 1978 to 1986, they appeared over 30 times on [[The Merv Griffin Show]], including the final "goodbye" program. They have been featured in interviews and articles in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' (a front page story on them), ''[[Omni (magazine)]]'', ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'', ''[[Playgirl]]'', ''[[Forbes]]'', ''[[Newsweek]]'', ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', ''[[US Weekly]]'', ''Fit'', ''The American Druggist'', ''PSA Magazine'', ''Longevity'', ''[[Men's Journal]]'', as well as magazines in France, Germany, and Japan.

Shaw and Pearson wrote, designed the stunts, and acted as technical advisers for an episode of ''The Wonderful World of Disney'', which aired in 1978, called "Black Holes, Monsters That Eat Space and Time." They acted as scientific and technical advisors and received screen credits for the [[Clint Eastwood]] movie [[Firefox (film)|Firefox]], designing special effects for all the scenes after Eastwood entered the Firefox cockpit. They also acted as scientific and technical advisors and received screen credits for [[Douglas Trumbull]]'s movie [[Brainstorm (1983 film)|Brainstorm]], starring [[Natalie Wood]].

In 1988, Shaw and Pearson released ''Life Extension, the Video'', produced by Ray Schwartz.  In the same year they co-authored with Steve Sharon ''[[The Dead Pool]]'', a high-tech thriller, which was sold to [[Warner Bros.]] and made into a Clint Eastwood [[Dirty Harry]] movie.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6518">In [[condensed matter physics]], '''spin–charge separation''' is an unusual behavior of [[electron]]s in some materials in which they 'split' into three independent particles, the [[spinon]], the [[orbiton]] and the [[Holon (physics)|holon]] (or chargon). The electron can always be theoretically considered as a [[bound state]] of the three, with the spinon carrying the [[spin (physics)|spin]] of the electron, the [[orbiton]] carrying the [[Atomic orbital|orbital]] degree of freedom and the chargon carrying the [[Electric charge|charge]], but in certain conditions they can become [[Deconfinement|deconfined]] and behave as independent particles.

The theory of spin–charge separation originates with the work of [[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga]] who developed an approximate method for treating one-dimensional interacting quantum systems in 1950.&lt;ref name=tomonaga&gt;{{cite journal|title=Remarks on Bloch's method of sound waves applied to many-fermion problems|journal=Progress of Theoretical Physics|volume=5|issue=4|page=544|doi=10.1143/ptp/5.4.544|year=1950|last1=Tomonaga|first1=S.-i.|bibcode=1950PThPh...5..544T}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was then developed by [[Joaquin Mazdak Luttinger]] in 1963 with an exactly solvable model which demonstrated spin–charge separation.&lt;ref name=luttinger&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1704046 |title=An Exactly Soluble Model of a Many‐Fermion System |journal=Journal of Mathematical Physics |volume=4 |issue=9 |page=1154 |year=1963 |last1=Luttinger |first1=J. M. |bibcode=1963JMP.....4.1154L }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 [[F. Duncan M. Haldane]] generalized Luttinger's model to the Tomonaga–[[Luttinger liquid]] concept&lt;ref name=haldane&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Haldane | first1 = F. D. M. | title = 'Luttinger liquid theory' of one-dimensional quantum fluids. I. Properties of the Luttinger model and their extension to the general 1D interacting spinless Fermi gas | journal = Journal of Physics C: Solid State Physics | volume = 14 | issue = 19 | page = 2585 | year = 1981 | doi = 10.1088/0022-3719/14/19/010|bibcode = 1981JPhC...14.2585H }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereby the physics of Luttinger's model was shown theoretically to be a general feature of all one-dimensional metallic systems. Although Haldane treated spinless fermions, the extension to [[spin-½]] fermions and associated spin–charge separation was clear so that the promised follow-up paper did not appear.

Spin–charge separation is one of the most unusual manifestations of the concept of [[quasiparticle]]s. This property is counterintuitive, because neither the spinon, with zero charge and spin half, nor the chargon, with charge minus one and zero spin, can be constructed as combinations of the electrons, [[Electron hole|holes]], [[phonon]]s and [[photon]]s that are the constituents of the system. It is an example of [[fractionalization]], the phenomenon in which the [[quantum number]]s of the quasiparticles are not multiples of those of the elementary particles, but fractions.

Since the original electrons in the system are [[fermion]]s, one of the spinon and chargon has to be a fermion, and the other one has to be a [[boson]]. One is theoretically free to make the assignment in either way, and no [[Observable|observable quantity]] can depend on this choice. The formalism with bosonic chargon and fermionic spinon is usually referred to as the "slave-fermion"&lt;!-- please, do not touch the spelling unless you understand the term --&gt; formalism, while the formalism with fermionic chargon and bosonic spinon is called the "Schwinger boson" formalism.  Both approaches have been used for strongly correlated systems, but neither has been proved to be completely successful. One difficulty of the spin–charge separation is that while spinon and chargon are not gauge-invariant&lt;!-- please, do not touch the spelling unless you understand the term --&gt; quantities, i.e. unphysical objects, there are no direct physical probes to observe them. Therefore more often than not one has to use thermal dynamical or macroscopic techniques to see their effects. This implies that which formalism we choose is irrelevant to real physics, so in principle both approaches should give us the same answer. The reason we obtain radically different answers from these two formalisms is probably because of the wrong mean field solution we choose, which means that we are dealing with the spin–charge separation in a wrong way.

The same theoretical ideas have been applied in the framework of [[ultracold atom]]s. In a two-component Bose gas in 1D, strong interactions can produce a maximal form of spin–charge separation.&lt;ref name=opt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.optical-lattice.com/index.php?lattice-site=spin-waves |title=Spin-charge separation optical lattices |publisher=Optical-lattice.com |date= |accessdate=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observation==
Building on physicist [[F. Duncan M. Haldane]]'s 1981 theory, experts from the [[University of Cambridge|Universities of Cambridge]] and [[University of Birmingham|Birmingham]] proved experimentally in 2009 that a mass of electrons artificially confined in a small space together will split into spinons and holons due to the intensity of their mutual repulsion (from having the same charge).&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/8227861.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; England &amp;#124; Physicists 'make electrons split' |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-08-28 |accessdate=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/07/090730141607.htm Discovery About Behavior Of Building Block Of Nature Could Lead To Computer Revolution].

'''Stem-cell therapy''' is the use of [[stem cells]] to treat or prevent a disease or condition.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |authors=Mahla RS| title = Stem cells application in regenerative medicine and disease threpeutics | journal = International Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 2016 | issue = 7 | pages = 1–24 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27516776 | doi = 10.1155/2016/6940283 | pmc=4969512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bone marrow transplant]] is the most widely used stem-cell therapy, but some therapies derived from [[umbilical cord blood]] are also in use. Research is underway to develop various sources for stem cells, as well as to apply stem-cell treatments for [[neurodegenerative diseases]] and conditions such as [[diabetes]] and [[heart disease]], among others.

Stem-cell therapy has become controversial following developments such as the ability of scientists to isolate and culture [[embryonic stem cells]], to create stem cells using [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]] and their use of techniques to create [[induced pluripotent stem cells]]. This controversy is often related to [[abortion debate|abortion politics]] and to [[human cloning]]. Additionally, efforts to market treatments based on transplant of stored umbilical [[cord blood]] have been controversial.

For over 30 years, [[bone marrow]] has been used to treat people with cancer with conditions such as [[leukaemia]] and [[lymphoma]]; this is the only form of stem-cell therapy that is widely practiced.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Murnaghan for Explore Stem Cells.

These agents, however, cannot discriminate between the leukaemia or neoplastic cells, and the [[Hematopoiesis|hematopoietic stem cells]] within the bone marrow. It is this side effect of conventional chemotherapy strategies that the stem-cell transplant attempts to reverse; a donor's healthy bone marrow reintroduces functional stem cells to replace the cells lost in the host's body during treatment. The transplanted cells also generate an immune response that helps to kill off the cancer cells; this process can go too far, however, leading to [[graft vs host disease]], the most serious side effect of this treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Malard F, Mohty M | year = 2014 | title = New Insight for the Diagnosis of Gastrointestinal Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease | journal = Mediators Inflamm | volume = 2014 | issue = | page = 701013 | doi = 10.1155/2014/701013 | pmid = 24733964 | pmc=3964897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another stem-cell therapy called [[Prochymal]], was conditionally approved in Canada in 2012 for the management of acute graft-vs-host disease in children who are unresponsive to steroids.&lt;ref name=mnt&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/245704.php |title=Prochymal – First Stem Cell Drug Approved |date=22 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an [[Cell therapy#Allogeneic Cell Therapy|allogenic stem therapy]] based on [[mesenchymal stem cells]] (MSCs) derived from the bone marrow of adult donors. MSCs are purified from the marrow, cultured and packaged, with up to 10,000 doses derived from a single donor. The doses are stored frozen until needed.&lt;ref name=NYT2012&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/18/health/a-stem-cell-based-drug-gets-approval-in-canada.html |title=A Stem-Cell-Based Drug Gets Approval in Canada |date=17 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Healthy adult brains contain [[neural stem cell]]s which divide to maintain general stem-cell numbers, or become [[progenitor cells]]. In healthy adult laboratory animals, progenitor cells migrate within the brain and function primarily to maintain neuron populations for [[olfaction]] (the sense of smell). Pharmacological activation of [[endogenous]] neural stem cells has been reported to induce [[neuroprotection]] and behavioral recovery in adult rat models of neurological disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Androutsellis-Theotokis A, Leker RR, Soldner F, etal |title=Notch signalling regulates stem cell numbers in vitro and in vivo |journal=Nature |volume=442 |issue=7104 |pages=823–26 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16799564 |doi=10.1038/nature04940 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Androutsellis-Theotokis A, Rueger MA, Park DM, etal |title=Targeting neural precursors in the adult brain rescues injured dopamine neurons |journal=Proc.

====Criticisms====

In 2013, studies of autologous bone marrow stem cells on ventricular function were found to contain "hundreds" of discrepancies.&lt;ref name="Dusseldorf Stem Cell Mystery"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Francis|first=Darrel P|title=Autologous bone marrow-derived stem cell therapy in heart disease: Discrepancies and contradictions|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167527313008012|journal=Int J Cardiol|accessdate=6 July 2013|doi=10.1016/j.ijcard.2013.04.152|pmid=23830344|volume=168|issue=4|date=Oct 2013|pages=3381–403}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics report that of 48 reports there seemed to be just five underlying trials, and that in many cases whether they were randomized or merely observational accepter-versus-rejecter, was contradictory between reports of the same trial. One pair of reports of identical baseline characteristics and final results, was presented in two publications as, respectively, a 578 patient randomized trial and as a 391 subject observational study. Other reports required (impossible) negative standard deviations in subsets of people, or contained fractional subjects, negative NYHA classes. Overall there were many more people published as having receiving stem cells in trials, than the number of stem cells processed in the hospital's laboratory during that time. A university investigation, closed in 2012 without reporting, was reopened in July 2013.&lt;ref name="Strauer SZ"&gt;{{cite news|last=Berndt|first=Christina|title=A minefield of contradictions|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wissen/vorwuerfe-gegen-stammzellforscher-ein-minenfeld-von-widerspruechen-1.1713007|publisher=Suddeutsche Zeitung|accessdate=6 July 2013|newspaper=Sueddeutsche.de|date=2013-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Blood-cell formation====
The specificity of the human immune-cell repertoire is what allows the human body to defend itself from rapidly adapting antigens. However, the immune system is vulnerable to degradation upon the pathogenesis of disease, and because of the critical role that it plays in overall defense, its degradation is often fatal to the organism as a whole. Diseases of hematopoietic cells are diagnosed and classified via a subspecialty of pathology known as [[hematopathology]]. The specificity of the immune cells is what allows recognition of foreign antigens, causing further challenges in the treatment of immune disease. Identical matches between donor and recipient must be made for successful transplantation treatments, but matches are uncommon, even between first-degree relatives. Research using both hematopoietic adult stem cells and embryonic stem cells has provided insight into the possible mechanisms and methods of treatment for many of these ailments.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Fully mature human [[red blood cells]] may be generated ''[[ex vivo]]'' by [[hematopoietic stem cell]]s (HSCs), which are precursors of red blood cells. In this process, HSCs are grown together with [[stromal cell]]s, creating an environment that mimics the conditions of bone marrow, the natural site of red-blood-cell growth. [[Erythropoietin]], a [[growth factor]], is added, coaxing the stem cells to complete terminal differentiation into red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Giarratana MC, Kobari L, Lapillonne H, etal |title=Ex vivo generation of fully mature human red blood cells from hematopoietic stem cells |journal=Nat.

====Regrowing teeth====
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Dentistry]] --&gt;
In 2004, scientists at [[King's College London]] discovered a way to cultivate a complete tooth in mice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/connected/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=P8&amp;targetRule=10&amp;xml=%2Fconnected%2F2004%2F02%2F17%2Fecntee15.xml | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | accessdate=24 May 2010 | first=Graeme | last=Archer | title=Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were able to grow bioengineered teeth stand-alone in the laboratory. Researchers are confident that the [[tooth regeneration]] technology can be used to grow live teeth in people.	

In theory, stem cells taken from the patient could be coaxed in the lab turning into a tooth bud which, when implanted in the gums, will give rise to a new tooth, and would be expected to be grown in a time over three weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anglin|first1=Ian|title=Scientists Grow Teeth Using Stem Cells|url=http://singularityhub.com/2013/08/26/scientists-grow-teeth-using-stem-cells-harvested-from-urine/|website=SingularityHUB|accessdate=31 July 2014|date=2013-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will fuse with the jawbone and release chemicals that encourage nerves and blood vessels to connect with it.

====Blindness and vision impairment====
Since 2003, researchers have successfully transplanted corneal stem cells into damaged eyes to restore vision. "Sheets of retinal cells used by the team are harvested from aborted fetuses, which some people find objectionable." When these sheets are transplanted over the damaged [[cornea]], the stem cells stimulate renewed repair, eventually restore vision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php?newsid=15535 Fetal tissue restores lost sight] MedicalNewsToday. 28 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The latest such development was in June 2005, when researchers at the [[Queen Victoria Hospital]] of [[Sussex, England|Sussex]], England were able to restore the sight of forty people using the same technique.

==== Wound healing ====
Stem cells can also be used to stimulate the growth of human tissues. In an adult, wounded tissue is most often replaced by [[Granulation tissue|scar tissue]], which is characterized in the skin by disorganized collagen structure, loss of hair follicles and irregular vascular structure. In the case of wounded fetal tissue, however, wounded tissue is replaced with normal tissue through the activity of stem cells.&lt;ref name="Gurtner"/&gt; A possible method for tissue regeneration in adults is to place adult stem cell "seeds" inside a tissue bed "soil" in a wound bed and allow the stem cells to stimulate differentiation in the tissue bed cells. This method elicits a regenerative response more similar to fetal wound-healing than adult scar tissue formation.&lt;ref name=Gurtner&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev.med.58.082405.095329 |vauthors=Gurtner GC, Callaghan MJ, Longaker MT | year = 2007 | title = Progress and potential for regenerative medicine | url = | journal = Annu.

==== Infertility ====
Culture of [[human embryonic stem cell]]s in mitotically inactivated porcine ovarian fibroblasts (POF) causes differentiation into [[germ cell]]s (precursor cells of oocytes and spermatozoa), as evidenced by [[gene expression]] analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Richards M, Fong CY, Bongso A |title=Comparative evaluation of different in vitro systems that stimulate germ cell differentiation in human embryonic stem cells |journal=Fertil.

====HIV/AIDS====

Destruction of the immune system by the HIV is driven by the loss of CD4+ T cells in the peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues. Viral entry into CD4+ cells is mediated by the interaction with a cellular chemokine receptor, the most common of which are [[CCR5]] and [[CXCR4]]. Because subsequent viral replication requires cellular gene expression processes, activated CD4+ cells are the primary targets of productive HIV infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allers|first1=Kristinia|last2=Hütter|first2=Gero|last3=Hofmann|first3=Jörg|last4=Loddenkemper|first4=Chrtoph|last5=Rieger|first5=Kathrin|last6=Thiel|first6=Eckhard|last7=Schneider|first7=Thomas|title=Evidence for the cure of HIV infection by CCR5Δ32/Δ32 stem cell transplantation|journal=Blood|date=14 July 2014|volume=117|issue=10|pages=2791–99|doi=10.1182/blood-2010-09-309591|pmid=21148083}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently scientists have been investigating an alternative approach to treating HIV-1/AIDS, based on the creation of a disease-resistant immune system through transplantation of autologous, gene-modified (HIV-1-resistant) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (GM-HSPC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DiGiusto|first1=David|last2=Stan|first2=Rodica|last3=Krishnan|first3=Amrita|last4=Li|first4=Haitang|last5=Rossi|first5=John|last6=Zaia|first6=John|title=Development of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Based Gene Therapy for HIV-1 Infection: Considerations for Proof of Concept Studies and Translation to Standard Medical Practice|journal=Viruses|date=22 November 2013|volume=2013|issue=5|pages=2898–919|doi=10.3390/v5112898|pmid=24284880|pmc=3856421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stem cells are thought to mediate repair via five primary mechanisms: 1) providing an anti-inflammatory effect, 2) homing to damaged tissues and recruiting other cells, such as [[endothelial progenitor cell]]s, that are necessary for tissue growth, 3) supporting tissue remodeling over scar formation, 4) inhibiting [[apoptosis]], and 5) differentiating into bone, cartilage, tendon, and ligament tissue.&lt;ref name=Richardson07&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Richardson LE, Dudhia J, Clegg PD, Smith R |title=Stem cells in veterinary medicine – attempts at regenerating equine tendon after injury |journal=Trends Biotechnol. |volume=25 |issue=9 |pages=409–16 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17692415 |doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2007.07.009 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167-7799(07)00188-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Csaki C, Matis U, Mobasheri A, Ye H, Shakibaei M |title=Chondrogenesis, osteogenesis and adipogenesis of canine mesenchymal stem cells: a biochemical, morphological and ultrastructural study |journal=Histochem.

To further enrich blood supply to the damaged areas, and consequently promote tissue regeneration, platelet-rich plasma could be used in conjunction with stem cell transplantation.&lt;ref name="kane" /&gt;&lt;ref name="yamada" /&gt; The efficacy of some stem cell populations may also be affected by the method of delivery; for instance, to regenerate bone, stem cells are often introduced in a scaffold where they produce the minerals necessary for generation of functional bone.&lt;ref name="kane" /&gt;&lt;ref name="yamada"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yamada Y, Ueda M, Naiki T, Takahashi M, Hata K, Nagasaka T |title=Autogenous injectable bone for regeneration with mesenchymal stem cells and platelet-rich plasma: tissue-engineered bone regeneration |journal=Tissue Eng. |volume=10 |issue=5–6 |pages=955–64 |year=2004 |pmid=15265313 |doi=10.1089/1076327041348284}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Singec07&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Singec I, Jandial R, Crain A, Nikkhah G, Snyder EY |title=The leading edge of stem cell therapeutics |journal=Annu.

Stem cells have also been shown to have a low immunogenicity due to the relatively low number of MHC molecules found on their surface. In addition, they have been found to secrete chemokines that alter the immune response and promote tolerance of the new tissue. This allows for [[allogeneic]] treatments to be performed without a high rejection risk.&lt;ref name=orthoa&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brehm W, Burk J, Delling U, Gittel C, Ribitsch I |title=Stem cell-based tissue engineering in veterinary orthopaedics |journal=Cell Tissue Res. |volume=347 |issue=3 |pages=677–88 |year=2012 |pmid=22287044 |doi=10.1007/s00441-011-1316-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drug discovery and biomedical research===
The ability to grow up functional adult tissues indefinitely in culture through [[Directed differentiation]] creates new opportunities for drug research. Researchers are able to grow up differentiated cell lines and then test new drugs on each cell type to examine possible interactions ''in vitro'' before performing ''in vivo'' studies. This is critical in the development of drugs for use in veterinary research because of the possibilities of species specific interactions. The hope is that having these cell lines available for research use will reduce the need for research animals used because effects on human tissue ''in vitro'' will provide insight not normally known before the animal testing phase.&lt;ref name=reviewa /&gt;

:With the advent of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), treatments being explored and created for the used in endangered low production animals possible. Rather than needing to harvest embryos or eggs, which are limited, the researchers can remove mesenchymal stem cells with greater ease and greatly reducing the danger to the animal due to noninvasive techniques. This allows the limited eggs to be put to use for reproductive purposes only.&lt;ref name=reviewa /&gt;

===Conservation===
Stem cells are being explored for use in conservation efforts. Spermatogonial stem cells have been harvested from a rat and placed into a mouse host and fully mature sperm were produced with the ability to produce viable offspring. Currently research is underway to find suitable hosts for the introduction of donor spermatogonial stem cells. If this becomes a viable option for conservationists, sperm can be produced from high genetic quality individuals who die before reaching sexual maturity, preserving a line that would otherwise be lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=I.

===Sources for stem cells===
Most stem cells intended for regenerative therapy are generally isolated either from the patient's [[bone marrow]] or from [[adipose tissue]].&lt;ref name="yamada" /&gt;&lt;ref name="zachos" /&gt; Mesenchymal stem cells can differentiate into the cells that make up bone, cartilage, tendons, and ligaments, as well as muscle, neural and other progenitor tissues, they have been the main type of stem cells studied in the treatment of diseases affecting these tissues.&lt;ref name=Awad99/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nathan S, Das De S, Thambyah A, Fen C, Goh J, Lee EH |title=Cell-based therapy in the repair of osteochondral defects: a novel use for adipose tissue |journal=Tissue Eng. |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=733–44 |date=August 2003 |pmid=13678450 |doi=10.1089/107632703768247412}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of stem cells transplanted into damaged tissue may alter efficacy of treatment. Accordingly, stem cells derived from bone marrow aspirates, for instance, are cultured in specialized laboratories for expansion to millions of cells.&lt;ref name="yamada" /&gt;&lt;ref name="zachos" /&gt; Although adipose-derived tissue also requires processing prior to use, the culturing methodology for adipose-derived stem cells is not as extensive as that for bone marrow-derived cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fraser JK, Wulur I, Alfonso Z, Hedrick MH |title=Fat tissue: an underappreciated source of stem cells for biotechnology |journal=Trends Biotechnol. |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=150–54 |date=April 2006 |pmid=16488036 |doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2006.01.010 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167-7799(06)00028-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nakagami06&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nakagami H, Morishita R, Maeda K, Kikuchi Y, Ogihara T, Kaneda Y |title=Adipose tissue-derived stromal cells as a novel option for regenerative cell therapy |journal=J.

New sources of mesenchymal stem cells are being researched, including stem cells present in the skin and dermis which are of interest because of the ease at which they can be harvested with minimal risk to the animal.&lt;ref name=nerve&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Park BW, Kang DH, Kang EJ, Byun JH, Lee JS, Maeng GH, Rho GJ |title=Peripheral nerve regeneration using autologous porcine skin-derived mesenchymal stem cells |journal=J Tissue Eng Regen Med |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=113–24 |year=2012 |pmid=21337707 |doi=10.1002/term.404}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hematopoetic stem cells have also been discovered to be travelling in the blood stream and possess equal differentiating ability as other mesenchymal stem cells, again with a very non-invasive harvesting technique.&lt;ref name= eyes&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marfe G, Massaro-Giordano M, Ranalli M, Cozzoli E, Di Stefano C, Malafoglia V, Polettini M, Gambacurta A |title=Blood derived stem cells: an ameliorative therapy in veterinary ophthalmology |journal=J.

:There has been more recent interest in the use of extra embryonic mesenchymal stem cells. Research is underway to examine the differentiating capabilities of stem cells found in the umbilical cord, yolk sac and placenta of different animals. These stem cells are thought to have more differentiating ability than their adult counterparts, including the ability to more readily form tissues of endodermal and ectodermal origin.&lt;ref name=orthoa /&gt;

====Embryonic stem cell lines====
{{Main|Stem-cell controversy}}
There is widespread controversy over the use of human [[embryonic stem cell]]s. This controversy primarily targets the techniques used to derive new embryonic [[stem cell line]]s, which often requires the destruction of the [[blastocyst]]. Opposition to the use of human embryonic stem cells in research is often based on philosophical, moral, or religious objections.&lt;ref name="Mlsna"&gt;

On 23 January 2009, the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] gave clearance to [[Geron Corporation]] for the initiation of the first clinical trial of an embryonic stem-cell-based therapy on humans. The trial aimed evaluate the drug GRNOPC1, [[embryonic stem cell]]-derived [[oligodendrocyte]] progenitor cells, on people with acute [[spinal cord injury]]. The trial was discontinued in November 2011 so that the company could focus on therapies in the "current environment of capital scarcity and uncertain economic conditions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/innovation/2012/0127/1224310600371.html | work=The Irish Times | first=Claire | last=O'Connell | title=Stem cells – where are we now? | date=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 biotechnology and [[regenerative medicine]] company [[BioTime]] ({{NYSE MKT|BTX}}) acquired Geron's stem cell assets in a stock transaction, with the aim of restarting the clinical trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= BioTime acquires stem cell assets from Geron, raises $10&amp;nbsp;million|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/biotech/2013/01/biotime-acquires-stem-cell-assets-geron.html|work= San Francisco Business Times |date= 7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)====

Scientists have reported that MSCs when transfused immediately within few hours post thawing may show reduced function or show decreased efficacy in treating diseases as compared to those MSCs which are in log phase of cell growth(fresh), so cryopreserved MSCs should be brought back into log phase of cell growth in invitro culture before these are administered for clinical trials or experimental therapies, re-culturing of MSCs will help in recovering from the shock the cells get during freezing and thawing. Various clinical trials on MSCs have failed which used cryopreserved product immediately post thaw as compared to those clinical trials which used fresh MSCs.&lt;ref name="pmid22029655"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = François M, Copland IB, Yuan S, Romieu-Mourez R, Waller EK, Galipeau J | title = Cryopreserved mesenchymal stromal cells display impaired immunosuppressive properties as a result of heat-shock response and impaired interferon-γ licensing | journal = Cytotherapy | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 147–52 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22029655 | pmc = 3279133 | doi = 10.3109/14653249.2011.623691 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Veterinary medicine ==
Research has been conducted on horses, dogs, and cats can benefit the development of stem cell treatments in veterinary medicine and can target a wide range of injuries and diseases such as [[myocardial infarction]], stroke, [[tendon]] and [[ligament]] damage, [[osteoarthritis]], [[osteochondrosis]] and [[muscular dystrophy]] both in large animals, as well as humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen J, Li Y, Wang L, etal |title=Therapeutic benefit of intravenous administration of bone marrow stromal cells after cerebral ischemia in rats |journal=Stroke |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=1005–11 |date=April 2001 |pmid=11283404 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11283404 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.32.4.1005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000043246.74879.CD |vauthors=Assmus B, Schächinger V, Teupe C, etal |title=Transplantation of Progenitor Cells and Regeneration Enhancement in Acute Myocardial Infarction (TOPCARE-AMI) |journal=Circulation |volume=106 |issue=24 |pages=3009–17 |date=December 2002 |pmid=12473544 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12473544}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Murphy JM, Fink DJ, Hunziker EB, Barry FP |title=Stem cell therapy in a caprine model of osteoarthritis |journal=Arthritis Rheum. |volume=48 |issue=12 |pages=3464–74 |date=December 2003 |pmid=14673997 |doi=10.1002/art.11365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sampaolesi M, Blot S, D'Antona G, etal |title=Mesoangioblast stem cells ameliorate muscle function in dystrophic dogs |journal=Nature |volume=444 |issue=7119 |pages=574–79 |date=November 2006 |pmid=17108972 |doi=10.1038/nature05282|url=https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/187585 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While investigation of cell-based therapeutics generally reflects human medical needs, the high degree of frequency and severity of certain injuries in [[racehorses]] has put veterinary medicine at the forefront of this novel regenerative approach.&lt;ref name="taylor"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2746/042516407X180868 |vauthors=Taylor SE, Smith RK, Clegg PD |title=Mesenchymal stem cell therapy in equine musculoskeletal disease: scientific fact or clinical fiction? |journal=Equine Vet.

===Sources of stem cells===
Veterinary applications of stem cell therapy as a means of tissue regeneration have been largely shaped by research that began with the use of adult-derived [[mesenchymal stem cell]]s to treat animals with injuries or defects affecting bone, cartilage, ligaments and/or tendons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Young RG, Butler DL, Weber W, Caplan AI, Gordon SL, Fink DJ |title=Use of mesenchymal stem cells in a collagen matrix for Achilles tendon repair |journal=J.

===Hard-tissue repair===
Bone has a unique and well documented natural healing process that normally is sufficient to repair fractures and other common injuries. Misaligned breaks due to severe trauma, as well as treatments like tumor resections of bone cancer, are prone to improper healing if left to the natural process alone. Scaffolds composed of natural and artificial components are seeded with mesenchymal stem cells and placed in the defect. Within four weeks of placing the scaffold, newly formed bone begins to integrate with the old bone and within 32 weeks, full union is achieved.&lt;ref name=reviewz&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Ribitsch I, Burk J, Delling U, Geißler C, Gittel C, Jülke H, Brehm W|title=Basic Science and Clinical Application of Stem Cells in Veterinary Medicine|year=2010|pages=219–63|doi=10.1007/10_2010_66|pmid=20309674|journal=Bioreactor Systems for Tissue Engineering II|volume=123|isbn=978-3-642-16050-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies are necessary to fully characterize the use of cell-based therapeutics for treatment of bone fractures.

Stem cells have been used to treat degenerative bone diseases. The normally recommended treatment for dogs that have Legg–Calve–Perthes disease is to remove the head of the femur after the degeneration has progressed. Recently, mesenchymal stem cells have been injected directly in to the head of the femur, with success not only in bone regeneration, but also in pain reduction.&lt;ref name=reviewz /&gt;

Because of the general positive healing capabilities of stem cells, they have gained interest for the treatment of cutaneous wounds. This is important interest for those with reduced healing capabilities, like diabetics and those undergoing chemotherapy. In one trial, stem cells were isolated from the Wharton's jelly of the umbilical cord. These cells were injected directly into the wounds. Within a week, full re-epithelialization of the wounds had occurred, compared to minor re-epithelialization in the control wounds. This showed the capabilities of mesenchymal stem cells in the repair of epidermal tissues.&lt;ref name="goat"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Azari O, Babaei H, Derakhshanfar A, Nematollahi-Mahani SN, Poursahebi R, Moshrefi M |title=Effects of transplanted mesenchymal stem cells isolated from Wharton's jelly of caprine umbilical cord on cutaneous wound healing; histopathological evaluation |journal=Vet.

Soft-palate defects in horses are caused by a failure of the embryo to fully close at the midline during embryogenesis. These are often not found until after they have become worse because of the difficulty in visualizing the entire soft palate. This lack of visualization is thought to also contribute to the low success rate in surgical intervention to repair the defect. As a result, the horse often has to be euthanized. Recently, the use of mesenchymal stem cells has been added to the conventional treatments. After the surgeon has sutured the palate closed, autologous mesenchymal cells are injected into the soft palate. The stem cells were found to be integrated into the healing tissue especially along the border with the old tissue. There was also a large reduction in the number of inflammatory cells present, which is thought to aid in the healing process.&lt;ref name="palate"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Carstanjen B, Desbois C, Hekmati M, Behr L |journal=The Canadian Journal of Veterinary Research |year=2006 |volume=70 | pages=143–47 |pmid=16639947 |pmc=1410720 |issue=2 |title=Successful engraftment of cultured autologous mesenchymal stem cells in a surgically repaired soft palate defect in an adult horse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ligament and tendon repair===
Autologous stem cell-based treatments for [[ligament]] injury, [[tendon]] injury, [[osteoarthritis]], [[osteochondrosis]], and sub-chondral bone cysts have been commercially available to practicing veterinarians to treat horses since 2003 in the United States and since 2006 in the United Kingdom. Autologous stem cell based treatments for tendon injury, ligament injury, and [[osteoarthritis]] in dogs have been available to veterinarians in the United States since 2005. Over 3000 privately owned horses and dogs have been treated with autologous adipose-derived stem cells. The efficacy of these treatments has been shown in double-blind clinical trials for dogs with osteoarthritis of the hip and elbow and horses with tendon damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Black LL, Gaynor J, Adams C, etal |title=Effect of intraarticular injection of autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem and regenerative cells on clinical signs of chronic osteoarthritis of the elbow joint in dogs |journal=Vet. Ther. |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=192–200 |year=2008 |pmid=19003780 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nixon AJ, Dahlgren LA, Haupt JL, Yeager AE, Ward DL |title=Effect of adipose-derived nucleated cell fractions on tendon repair in horses with collagenase-induced tendinitis |journal=Am. J. Vet. Res. |volume=69 |issue=7 |pages=928–37 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18593247 |doi=10.2460/ajvr.69.7.928 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Race horses are especially prone to injuries of the tendon and ligaments. Conventional therapies are very unsuccessful in returning the horse to full functioning potential. Natural healing, guided by the conventional treatments, leads to the formation of fibrous scar tissue that reduces flexibility and full joint movement. Traditional treatments prevented a large number of horses from returning to full activity and also have a high incidence of re-injury due to the stiff nature of the scarred tendon. Introduction of both bone marrow and adipose derived stem cells, along with natural mechanical stimulus promoted the regeneration of tendon tissue. The natural movement promoted the alignment of the new fibers and tendocytes with the natural alignment found in uninjured tendons. Stem cell treatment not only allowed more horses to return to full duty and also greatly reduced the re-injury rate over a three-year period.&lt;ref name=orthoa /&gt;

The use of embryonic stem cells has also been applied to tendon repair. The embryonic stem cells were shown to have a better survival rate in the tendon as well as better migrating capabilities to reach all areas of damaged tendon. The overall repair quality was also higher, with better tendon architecture and collagen formed. There was also no tumor formation seen during the three-month experimental period. Long-term studies need to be carried out to examine the long-term efficacy and risks associated with the use of embryonic stem cells.&lt;ref name=orthoa /&gt; Similar results have been found in small animals.&lt;ref name=orthoa /&gt;

====Joint repair====
Osteoarthritis is the main cause of joint pain both in animals and humans. Horses and dogs are most frequently affected by arthritis. Natural cartilage regeneration is very limited and no current drug therapies are curative, but rather look to reduce the symptoms associated with the degeneration. Different types of mesenchymal stem cells and other additives are still being researched to find the best type of cell and method for long-term treatment.&lt;ref name=orthoa /&gt;

Adipose-derived mesenchymal cells are currently the most often used because of the non-invasive harvesting. There has been a lot of success recently injecting mesenchymal stem cells directly into the joint. This is a recently developed, non-invasive technique developed for easier clinical use. Dogs receiving this treatment showed greater flexibility in their joints and less pain.&lt;ref name="arth"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Guercio A, Di Marco P, Casella S, Cannella V, Russotto L, Purpari G, Di Bella S, Piccione G |title=Production of canine mesenchymal stem cells from adipose tissue and their application in dogs with chronic osteoarthritis of the humeroradial joints |journal=Cell Biol.

===Muscle repairs===
Stem cells have successfully been used to ameliorate healing in the heart after myocardial infarction in dogs. Adipose and bone marrow derived stem cells were removed and induced to a cardiac cell fate before being injected into the heart. The heart was found to have improved contractility and a reduction in the damaged area four weeks after the stem cells were applied.&lt;ref name="hearta"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kim U, Shin DG, Park JS, Kim YJ, Park SI, Moon YM, Jeong KS |title=Homing of adipose-derived stem cells to radiofrequency catheter ablated canine atrium and differentiation into cardiomyocyte-like cells |journal=Int.

A different trial is underway for a patch made of a porous substance onto which the stem cells are "seeded" in order to induce tissue regeneration in heart defects. Tissue was regenerated and the patch was well incorporated into the heart tissue. This is thought to be due, in part, to improved angiogenesis and reduction of inflammation. Although cardiomyocytes were produced from the mesenchymal stem cells, they did not appear to be contractile. Other treatments that induced a cardiac fate in the cells before transplanting had greater success at creating contractile heart tissue.&lt;ref name="heartb"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Chang Y, Lai PH, Wei HJ, Lin WW, Chen CH, Hwang SM, Chen SC, Sung HW|title=Tissue regeneration observed in a basic fibroblast growth factor–loaded porous acellular bovine pericardium populated with mesenchymal stem cells|journal=The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery|volume=134|issue=1|year=2007|pages=65–73.e4|issn=0022-5223|doi=10.1016/j.jtcvs.2007.02.019|pmid=17599488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nervous system repairs====
Spinal cord injuries are one of the most common traumas brought into veterinary hospitals.&lt;ref name=reviewz /&gt; Spinal injuries occur in two ways after the trauma: the primary mechanical damage, and in secondary processes, like inflammation and scar formation, in the days following the trauma. These cells involved in the secondary damage response secrete factors that promote scar formation and inhibit cellular regeneration. Mesenchymal stem cells that are induced to a neural cell fate are loaded onto a porous scaffold and are then implanted at the site of injury. The cells and scaffold secrete factors that counteract those secreted by scar forming cells and promote neural regeneration. Eight weeks later, dogs treated with stem cells showed immense improvement over those treated with conventional therapies. Dogs treated with stem cells were able to occasionally support their own weight, which has not been seen in dogs undergoing conventional therapies.&lt;ref name="pmid22348702"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sung Su Park|title=Functional recovery after spinal cord injury in dogs treated with a combination of Matrigel and neural-induced adipose-derived mesenchymal Stem cells |journal=Cytotherapy |year=2012 |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=584–97 |doi=10.3109/14653249.2012.658913 |pmid=22348702|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19934591"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ryu HH, Lim JH, Byeon YE, Park JR, Seo MS, Lee YW, Kim WH, Kang KS, Kweon OK |title=Functional recovery and neural differentiation after transplantation of allogenic adipose-derived stem cells in a canine model of acute spinal cord injury |journal=J.

Treatments are also in clinical trials to repair and regenerate peripheral nerves. Peripheral nerves are more likely to be damaged, but the effects of the damage are not as widespread as seen in injuries to the spinal cord. Treatments are currently in clinical trials to repair severed nerves, with early success. Stem cells induced to a neural fate injected in to a severed nerve. Within four weeks, regeneration of previously damaged stem cells and completely formed nerve bundles were observed.&lt;ref name=nerve /&gt;

Stem cells are also in clinical phases for treatment in ophthalmology. Hematopoietic stem cells have been used to treat corneal ulcers of different origin of several horses. These ulcers were resistant to conventional treatments available, but quickly responded positively to the stem cell treatment. Stem cells were also able to restore sight in one eye of a horse with retinal detachment, allowing the horse to return to daily activities.&lt;ref name=eyes /&gt;

==Society and culture==

===Marketing===
In the late 1990s and early 2000s there was an initial wave of companies and clinics offering stem cell therapy to desperate people, often with extraordinary claims about what stem cells could do. Such companies and clinics included [[Advanced Cell Therapeutics]], [[Stowe BioTherapy]], Cells4Health run by Cornelis Kleinbloesem, the Beijing Xishan Institute for Neuroregeneration and Functional Recovery in [[Shijingshan]] run by [[Huang Hongyun]], and EmCell in [[Kiev, Ukraine]] run by Alexandr Smikodub.&lt;ref name=ScienceSelling2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Malignant/&gt; These clinics made strong claims about their outcomes, but rarely published their protocols or rigorous research showing that their therapies were safe and effective.&lt;ref name=ScienceSelling2006&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Enserink |first1=M |title=Biomedicine.

By 2012 a second wave of companies and clinics had emerged, usually located in developing countries where medicine is less regulated and offering stem cell therapies on a [[medical tourism]] model.&lt;ref name=Malignant/&gt;&lt;ref name=Slabbert/&gt; Like the first wave companies and clinics, they have made similar strong claims and also have not published their protocols or rigorous research; Mexico, Thailand, and India have been centers of this activity,&lt;ref name=Malignant&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sipp |first1=D |title=The malignant niche: safe spaces for toxic stem cell marketing. |journal=NPJ Regenerative Medicine |date=2017 |volume=2 |pages=33 |doi=10.1038/s41536-017-0036-x |pmid=29302366 |pmc=5736713}}&lt;/ref&gt; as has South Africa.&lt;ref name=Slabbert&gt;{{cite news |last1=Slabbert |first1=Melodie |title=South Africa's struggle to control sham stem cell treatments |url=http://theconversation.com/south-africas-struggle-to-control-sham-stem-cell-treatments-45500 |work=The Conversation |date=August 21, 2015 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 the FDA sent a warning letter to StemGenex Biologic Laboratories in San Diego, which marketed a service in which it took body fat from people, processed it into mixtures it said contained various forms of stem cells, and administered it back to the person by inhalation, IV, or infusion into their spinal cords; the company said the treatment was useful for many chronic and life-threatening conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=FDA presses its campaign against rogue regenerative med players, cites StemGenex for illegal sales |url=https://endpts.com/fda-presses-its-campaign-against-rogue-regenerative-med-players-cites-stemgenex-for-illegal-sales/ |work=Endpoints News |date=November 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27051">{{Death of Jesus}}
The '''stolen body hypothesis''' posits that the body of [[Jesus Christ]] was stolen from his burial place.  His tomb was found empty not because he was [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrected]], but because the body had been hidden somewhere else by the apostles or unknown persons.  Both the stolen body hypothesis and the debate over it presume the basic historicity of the gospel accounts of the tomb discovery.  The stolen body hypothesis finds the idea that the body was not in the tomb plausible - such a claim could be checked if early Christians made it - but considers it more likely that early Christians had been misled into believing the resurrection by the theft of Jesus's body.

The hypothesis has existed since the days of [[Early Christianity]]; it is discussed in the [[Gospel of Matthew]], generally agreed to have been written between AD 70 and 100.  Matthew's gospel raises the hypothesis only to refute it; according to it, the claim the body was stolen is a lie spread by the Jewish high priests.

==Historicity and gospel account==
{{See also|Death of Jesus|Historicity of Jesus|Historical reliability of the Gospels}}
The primary sources of details about Jesus are the Gospels.  Roman records are spottier - there is no extant contemporary record of the execution of Jesus, for example, not that such a thing would be expected, and thus no details about what was done with the body afterward.  As such, accounts of the days between Jesus's execution and the discovery of the empty tomb are almost exclusively based on the Gospel accounts and knowledge of society at the time, and it is difficult to say more than scenarios such as the stolen body hypothesis are "plausible" or "unlikely," rather than "proven" or "disproven".&lt;ref&gt;Carrier, "The Plausibility of Theft", p. 349.  "...[this work] demonstrates the plausibility (but by no means the certainty) of the hypothesis that the body of Jesus was stolen."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Gospel of Mark]], generally thought to be the oldest of the gospels, [[Joseph of Arimathea]] asked Pontius Pilate for the body of Jesus.  Afterward, a group of women went to the tomb, and found the stone rolled away, an angel there, and no body.  The Gospel of Luke largely concurs with this account, though the list of women slightly differs.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |title=The Jewish Teachers of Jesus, James, and Jude: What Earliest Christianity Learned from the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha |first=David A. |last=deSilva |year=2012 |accessdate=September 23, 2018 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zCxpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA275&amp;dq=mark+john+women+tomb+list&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiiuO3Tu9LdAhUpT98KHUZNBz8Q6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=mark%20john%20women%20tomb%20list&amp;f=false}}&lt;br/&gt;  See {{Bibleverse||Mark|15:40-41|NRSV}} and {{Bibleverse||John|19:25|NRSV}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the [[Gospel of John]], [[Nicodemus]] helped Joseph of Arimathea with the burial of Jesus.  It also notes that Jesus was buried in a garden near the site of the crucifixion, and that no body had lain there before.  In John, [[Simon Peter]] and the [[beloved disciple]] also come to the tomb to verify Mary Magdalene's claim of an empty tomb; there is no direct reference to this in Mark and Luke, where it is implied that the apostles only believe upon seeing the resurrected Jesus.

The [[Gospel of Matthew]] includes a distinct account of the period between Jesus's death and the discovery of the empty tomb not in the other gospels, and directly addresses skepticism about the resurrection.  In Matthew's account, the chief priests and the Pharisees know of prophecies that Jesus will return in three days, and fear that his disciples will steal the body to make it appear that he has been resurrected.  They ask Pilate to secure the tomb, and Pilate sends a guard to watch the tomb.  When Mary Magdalene arrives at the tomb, unlike the accounts in the other gospels, there is an earthquake and the tomb rolls open in front of her.  An angel appears and scares away the guards, and the empty tomb is revealed.  When the guards report this to the chief priests, the priests bribe the guards to lie about the events:

{{quote|...some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests everything that had happened. After the priests had assembled with the elders, they devised a plan to give a large sum of money to the soldiers, telling them, "You must say, 'His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.'  If this comes to the governor's ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble." So they took the money and did as they were directed. And this story is still told among the Jews to this day.|{{Bibleverse||Matthew|28:11-15|NRSV}} (NRSV)}}

This is the chief reference to the stolen body hypothesis in the New Testament.

==Potential culprits==

===The disciples===
According to this version of the stolen body hypothesis, some of the disciples stole away Jesus's body. Potential reasons include wishing to bury Jesus themselves; believing that Jesus would soon return and wanting his body in their possession; a "pious deceit" to restore Jesus's good name after being crucified as a criminal; or an outright plot to fake a resurrection.&lt;ref name="carrier352"&gt;Carrier. "The Plausibility of Theft", p. 352.&lt;/ref&gt; In the pious deceit theory, the proposed motive is that if people believed God had taken Jesus's body up to heaven, this would "prove" Jesus was a true holy man and vindicate his name.&lt;ref name="carrier352" /&gt; The "faked resurrection" theory is the only scenario discussed in the gospels, although Matthew brings it up solely to refute it and claim that the tale was a concoction of Jerusalem's high priests. According to proponents of this theory, the fact that Matthew raises the issue makes it likely that such an anti-Christian narrative already existed at the time. Jesus's entourage may have been at least as many as seventy (the [[Seventy Disciples]]), so it is not improbable according to proponents that at least one or two of them might have been willing to undertake such a plot.&lt;ref name="carrier352" /&gt; This theory also obviates the need for a miraculous resurrection.

A Jewish anti-Christian work dating from the 5th-century, the [[Toledoth Yeshu]], contains the claim the disciples planned to steal Jesus's body from his tomb. In this account, the body had already been moved, and when the disciples arrived at the empty tomb they came to the incorrect conclusion that he had risen from the dead. Later, the corpse was sold to the Jewish leaders for thirty pieces of silver, who confirmed Jesus's death; Jesus's corpse was then dragged through the streets of Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="habermas"&gt;Gary R. Habermas, ''The Historical Jesus: Ancient Evidence for the Life of Christ'', page 205 (Thomas Nelson, Inc., 2008). {{ISBN|0-89900-732-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another variant comes from a record of a 2nd-century debate between a Christian and a Jew, [[Justin Martyr]]'s ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]'': "his disciples stole him by night from the tomb, where he was laid when unfastened from the cross, and now deceive men by asserting that he has risen from the dead and ascended to heaven."&lt;ref&gt;Martyr, Justin. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.iv.cviii.html ''Dialogue with Trypho''], Chapter CVIII.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sincerity of the disciples====
Christian apologists find the idea that the disciples stole the body unconvincing. Both [[Eusebius]] and church tradition hold that a large number of apostles were [[martyred]] for their faith. Therefore, it is unlikely that any conspirators would preach and ultimately die for something they knew to be false. [[James Norman Dalrymple Anderson|J.N.D. Anderson]], dean of the faculty of law at the University of London and Christian apologist, said "This [the stolen body theory] would run totally contrary to all we know of them [the apostles]: their ethical teaching, the quality of their lives. Nor would it begin to explain their dramatic transformation from dejected and dispirited escapists into witnesses whom no opposition could muzzle."&lt;ref&gt;McDowell, Josh. [https://books.google.com/books?id=dIfkKmdh22MC&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;ots=RgK7uUG9cp&amp;dq=their%20ethical%20teaching%2C%20the%20quality%20of%20their%20lives.%20Nor%20would%20it%20begin%20to%20explain%20their%20dramatic%20transformation%20from%20dejected%20and%20dispirited%20escapists%20into%20witnesses%20whom%20no%20opposition%20could%20muzzle.&amp;pg=PA95#v=onepage&amp;q=their%20ethical%20teaching,%20the%20quality%20of%20their%20lives.%20Nor%20would%20it%20begin%20to%20explain%20their%20dramatic%20transformation%20from%20dejected%20and%20dispirited%20escapists%20into%20witnesses%20whom%20no%20opposition%20could%20muzzle.&amp;f=false ''More than a carpenter'']. p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[E.P. Sanders]] agrees with apologists that it is unlikely that the disciples would create a fraud but looks at it differently. He claims:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is difficult to accuse these sources, or the first believers, of deliberate fraud. A plot to foster belief in the Resurrection would probably have resulted in a more consistent story. Instead, there seems to have been a competition: 'I saw him,' 'so did I,' 'the women saw him first,' 'no, I did; they didn't see him at all,' and so on. Moreover, some of the witnesses of the Resurrection would give their lives for their belief. This also makes fraud unlikely."&lt;ref&gt;"Jesus Christ." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 10 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Responses from proponents include the possibility that the number of actual conspirators was small, or that [[Early Christianity|early Christian]] theology on the matter of the resurrection was very different from [[proto-orthodox Christianity]].

====Was the resurrection expected?====
Another apologetical argument is to argue that the disciples had no compelling reason to fabricate a resurrection story because they earnestly believed (at that time) Jesus was not the Messiah after all. According to J.N.D. Anderson in his work, the disciples simply didn't anticipate the resurrection and were surprised by the physical presence of the risen Christ. This is emphasized by the disciples fearful response upon seeing Jesus for the first time after his resurrection: "...They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost" ({{Bibleverse||Luke|24:37}}). They seemingly failed to "expect" the resurrection and were either unfamiliar with or discounted [[Messianic prophecy|prophecies indicating the Messiah would be resurrected]]. The Gospel of John seems to support this: "...Finally the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went inside. He saw and believed. They still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead..." ({{Bibleverse||John|20:8-20:9}}). If the apostles "did not understand" these prophecies, they would have no logical purpose in robbing the body of Jesus from his tomb, as there was nothing to prove.

Proponents refer to the Gospel of Matthew in response to this. If the high priests and the Pharisees understood that Jesus claimed he would rise from the dead in three days, it is plausible his disciples understood this as well.

===Graverobbers===
[[Graverobbing]] was a known problem in 1st century [[Judaea (Roman province)|Judaea]]; the famous [[Nazareth Inscription]] details an edict of Caesar that mandates capital punishment for meddling with tombs.  Several other pieces of evidence exist as well, such as a decree of Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] reasserting the existing law, implying that its violation continued to be a problem in the 2nd century AD.&lt;ref name="carrier365"&gt;Carrier.  "The Plausibility of Theft", p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is thus possible that Jesus's body was taken by graverobbers.  [[Gary Habermas]] finds this unlikely; he writes: "Robbing a tomb for valuables is one thing - taking the body with you is something else!  Why take a male body with you when you are trying to escape?"&lt;ref&gt;Gary Habermas; http://www.garyhabermas.com/qa/qa_index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, it appears some ancient graverobbers did steal bodies.  A possible motive for such would be the usage of Jesus's body in [[necromancy]]; several rites of the time required "one untimely dead" or the body of a holy person.  For example, a person could insert a scroll into a corpse's mouth and ask questions of the dead according to one belief of the time.&lt;ref name="carrier350"&gt;Carrier.  "The Plausibility of Theft", p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Tacitus]] notes that "the remains of human bodies" were found along with curse paraphernalia in the quarters of [[Germanicus]].&lt;ref name="carrier350" /&gt;  [[William Lane Craig]] dismisses these cases from elsewhere in the Roman Empire as too remote as they are "non-Jewish, non-Palestinian, and non-contemporary &amp;mdash; in other words, irrelevant to Jesus."&lt;ref name="dale-allison-on-the-resurrection-of-jesus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/dale-allison-on-the-resurrection-of-jesus|title=Dale Allison on the Resurrection of Jesus - Reasonable Faith|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223164035/http://www.reasonablefaith.org/dale-allison-on-the-resurrection-of-jesus|archivedate=23 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Removal by Jewish leadership===
Historian [[Charles Freeman (historian)|Charles Freeman]] posits that [[Caiaphas]] and members of the [[Sanhedrin]] removed Jesus's body to stave off possible civil disorder from Jesus's followers. By emptying the tomb, the Sanhedrin hoped to prevent it from becoming a shrine. Also, he noted that the gospels of Matthew and Mark both record that one or more young men (or angels) dressed in white appeared to the [[myrrhbearers]] and told them to seek Jesus in [[Galilee]]. Freeman argued that these young men/angels could have been priests from the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], as their Gospel description matches that of temple priests (white clothes). By encouraging Jesus's followers to return to Galilee, then, the priests were trying to get them to leave Jerusalem and avoid unrest.&lt;ref name="freeman"&gt;Charles Freeman, ''A New History of Early Christianity '', pp. 31-33(Yale University Press, 2009). {{ISBN|978-0-300-12581-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jesus's family, or unknown thieves===
According to this version of the stolen body hypothesis, there was no conspiracy; Jesus's body was moved from the tomb for unknown or irrelevant reasons. The apostles then found an empty tomb and became genuinely convinced that Jesus had been resurrected, which would explain their later fervor in the spread of Christianity. Author and [[textual criticism|textual critic]] [[Bart Ehrman]] contends that while the stolen body hypothesis is unlikely, from a historical perspective it is still far more probable than the resurrection. Ehrman also says that there are plenty of motives for stealing the body. Maybe Jesus's family wanted it buried in the family tomb?&lt;ref name="ehrmancraig"&gt;[http://www.reasonablefaith.org/is-there-historical-evidence-for-the-resurrection-of-jesus-the-craig-ehrman Is there historical evidence for the resurrection of Jesus? A debate between William Lane Craig and Bart D. Ehrman.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possibility, if a rather bizarre one, is the [[gardener]]. [[Tertullian]], in ''[[De Spectaculis]]'' 30, mentions that in addition to the theory that the disciples stole the body the theory that the gardener did the deed such that "his lettuces might come to no harm from the crowds of visitants [to the body]."&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian. [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0303.htm ''De Spectaculis''], Chapter 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Tertullian, an early Christian polemicist, may have merely meant to mock those who doubted the resurrection by putting the petty gardener theory in their mouths. The passage also perhaps only references a joke at the time or other non-serious accusation. However, the gospel of John possibly addresses the issue, as does [[Tatian]]'s ''[[Diatessaron]]''. In {{Bibleverse||John|20:14-20:16}} and the ''Diatessaron'' Section 53, Mary, after supposing the resurrected Jesus to be the gardener, asks him what he had done with the body - implying that the gardener may in fact have had a motive to move the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Diatessaron |last=Tatian |authorlink=Tatian |others=Roberts-Donaldson translation |year=c. 160&amp;ndash;175 |at=Section LIII |language=Syriac |accessdate=August 26, 2012 |url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/diatessaron.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in the Toledoth Yeshu, it is a gardener named Juda who originally moves the body, and then later sells the body of Jesus to the Jewish leadership.&lt;ref name="habermas"/&gt; Even if this all only attests to a Jewish polemic against Christianity, it implies that people at that time found the gardener having a motive to steal the body plausible, even if this motive is unknown to us today.&lt;ref name="carrier351"&gt;Carrier. "The Plausibility of Theft", p. 351.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other issues==

===The guard at the tomb===
According to the Gospel of Matthew, a guard was sent to the tomb: "Pilate said to them, 'You have a guard of soldiers; go, make it as secure as you can.' So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone." ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:65-66|NRSV}}) It is unclear whether Roman soldiers were used, or if the priests were to use their own temple guard. Nevertheless, Christian tradition has generally claimed that Roman guards were used. Apologists consider it implausible that grave robbers would risk robbing a guarded tomb when surely many unguarded ones existed.  Furthermore, while traditionally depicted as only two guards, Matthew does not specify how many there were; since "some" guards report the tale to the chief priests, it's plausible to assume there may have been more than two, which would render a raid even chancier.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Horvath; [http://sntjohnny.com/front/how-many-guards-at-the-tomb-of-jesus How many guards at Jesus’ tomb?] Horvath also argues that both Roman ''and'' temple guards were present.&lt;/ref&gt; Apologists also doubt that the disciples could possibly have sneaked past a Roman guard at a sealed tomb, and that attacking the guards would be even more implausible.  In response, it could be hypothesized that the guard was not on duty at night, and thus the thieves would be able to have struck then. A bribe to the soldiers is also possible, although most of the disciples were of modest means.

Alternatively, the entire account of the guard and the chief priests can be discounted as likely to be an ahistorical addition written by Matthew to make the stolen body hypothesis appear implausible.

Michael White]] and [[Helmut Koester]] argue the story was probably added as an attempt to refute the Jewish claims that the disciples stole the body which were circulating at the time.&lt;ref&gt;''Ancient Christian Gospels'' Koster, Helmut; Trinity Press, (1992) pg 237.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/religion/symposium/historical.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Atheist and historian [[Richard Carrier]] writes:
{{quote|The authors create a rhetorical means of putting the theft story into question by inventing guards on the tomb ...  it is most suspicious that the other gospel accounts omit any mention of a guard, even when Mary visits the tomb (compare Matthew 28:1-15 with Mark 16:1-8, Luke 24:1-12, and John 20:1-9), and also do not mention the theft story&amp;mdash;this claim is not even reported in Acts, where a lot of hostile Jewish attacks on the church are recorded, yet somehow this one fails to be mentioned. Neither Peter nor Paul mention either fact, either, even though their letters predate the gospels by decades. Worse, Matthew's account involves reporting privileged conversations between priests and Pilate, and then secret ones between priests and guards that no Christian could have known about (27.62-65, 28.11-15). This is always a very suspicious sign of fiction...  (Matthew) had the motive to make it up, to answer the objections of later skeptics (just like the Thomas story in John), and the story looks like an invention, because it narrates events that could not be known by the author.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/resurrection/2.html Why I Don't Buy the Resurrection Story: Probability of Survival vs. Miracle, Assessing the Odds].  Note that Carrier discusses the issue more specifically with regards to the hypothesis that Jesus survived and escaped.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[William Lane Craig]] considers the historicity of the guards plausible, although he suspects it was more likely Jewish temple guards, especially considering the chief priests' promises to keep them "out of trouble" would mean little to Roman soldiers who might be executed for claiming to have slept on duty.&lt;ref name="craigguard" /&gt;  The best objection to Matthew's version, to Craig, is that Matthew's account "presupposes not only that Jesus predicted his resurrection in three days, but also that the Jews understood this clearly while the disciples remained in ignorance."&lt;ref name="craigguard" /&gt;  While the gospel accounts give good reason to believe that the disciples would not understand the resurrection until it happened, Craig grants that it is indeed harder to explain the chief priest's actions, although far from impossible - perhaps it was simply an attempt to ensure no trouble started.  In favor of the existence of the guards being historical, however, Craig notes that the non-canonical [[Gospel of Peter]] also includes a story of guards being placed at the tomb, yet one that is quite different, suggesting that the guards are less likely to have been invented entirely by Matthew.  Additionally, Matthew's account isn't as foolproof as an invented or exaggerated account could be - the Gospel of Peter has an explicitly Roman guard guarding the tomb sent immediately on Good Friday (rather than Matthew's Saturday), the tomb is sealed seven times, and the Jewish elders keep watch the entire time.  On Easter Sunday, Jesus rises, flanked by two angels, in front of the Jews and a crowd from Jerusalem out to see him.&lt;ref name="craigguard" /&gt;  This account, given credence by neither Christians nor historians, clearly makes a secret theft of the body impossible.  Additionally, Craig writes that the polemic mentioned by Matthew suggests that Jews didn't contest the existence of a guard at the time.  In other words, if the guard didn't exist, the logical Jewish counterargument would be to argue against that Christian claim; instead, Matthew's story has the Jewish side using the weak "but the guards were asleep when the theft occurred" argument, suggesting the Jews of the time knew guards had been placed.&lt;ref name="craigguard" /&gt;

===Burial cloths===
The gospels of Luke and John record that the burial wrappings of Jesus were left inside the tomb.  The head wrapping was folded and placed separate from the other linens ({{Bibleverse||John|20:5-7}}).  Christian apologists contend that a grave robber would probably have stolen everything, especially since [[Joseph of Arimathea]] was a man of means and the wrappings were likely to have been valuable.  Further, carefully removing, then wrapping and folding the linens would be difficult and serve no useful purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[[Warren W. Wiersbe|Wiersbe, Warren W.]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=Sn18qwyJw9QC&amp;lpg=PA310&amp;ots=uEL3xz4fB3&amp;dq=linen%20clothes%20Jesus%20grave%20robber&amp;pg=PA310#v=onepage&amp;q=grave%20robbers&amp;f=false The Wiersbe Bible Commentary: The Complete New Testament]&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus these claims in the gospel are also brought into contention by the theory, especially if a grave robber is proposed as the culprit.  Replies from proponents include noting that if the motive of the graverobbers was body parts for necromancy, the cloths might be irrelevant; and if the culprit was a conspirator out to "prove" Jesus's holiness, then the wrappings might have been ''deliberately'' left behind to foster the notion of the body miraculously disappearing.  Richard Carrier also considers the mention of the cloths "a natural embellishment to such a narrative and thus cannot be trusted to be historical,"&lt;ref name="carrier353"&gt;Carrier.  "The Plausibility of Theft", p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt; since historians of the era would often illustrate such scenes with plausible minor details that lack a source, similar to military historians describing specific sword interplay.&lt;ref name="carrier353" /&gt;

===Ritual purity===
Some apologists{{who|date=December 2010}} note that the disciples, as practicing Jews, could not come near a dead body without [[Ritual washing in Judaism#Death|breaking ritual purity regulations]]. Exceptions included the nearest male relative could claim a dead body and women.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Thus, the fact that women discovered the empty tomb first is seen as very plausible, and the (presumably devout) disciples taking the body is seen as a less likely explanation. However, if a genuine conspiracy was afoot, breaking purity is unlikely to have stopped the conspirators, and grave robbers violate this law constantly by profession. If Jesus's family reclaimed the body, this would not apply either.  It does, however, make it less plausible other Jews would have stolen the body.

The '''Voluntary Euthanasia Party''' is a minor political party in Australia, founded in early 2013 by Corey McCann to advocate for legislative change to allow [[voluntary euthanasia]] in Australia. The party's inception was strongly supported by Dr [[Philip Nitschke]], director of [[Exit International]] and Richard Mills, then President of Dying with Dignity NSW.

The party applied to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) to be registered as a political party on 10 May 2013.  The application was assessed on 20 May and the party was registered on 1 June.&lt;ref name=aec&gt;[http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/party_registration/Registration_Decisions/2013/5146.htm Application for registration approved – Voluntary Euthanasia Party], Australian Electoral Commission, 1 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The party was founded in 2013 to bring attention to the need for voluntary assisted dying law reform and to bring together advocates from the Dying with Dignity and [[Exit International]] movements. The immediate goal of the VEP was to make voluntary euthanasia a central issue at the September 2013 Federal election, and it nominated six candidates for the Senate (two each in New South Wales, the ACT and South Australia); and a candidate for the House of Representatives seat of Solomon in the Northern Territory. Three of the candidates were terminally ill.

== Executive Committee ==
Professor Ranjan Ray, former President of the Western Australia Voluntary Euthanasia Society, was the first convenor of the Party, and was succeeded by Kerry Bromson in 2014.  [[Philip Nitschke]], the founder of [[Exit International]], is the Deputy Convenor, and has been since the party's launch in 2013.

== Definitions ==
There is no universally agreed definition of "voluntary euthanasia". Terms like dying with dignity, physician-assisted dying, physician-assisted suicide and voluntary assisted dying are also used. The VEP regards voluntary euthanasia as involving a request by a terminally or incurably ill person for medical assistance to end his or her life painlessly and peacefully. A doctor may administer the medication or prescribe medication that the patient self-administers.

== Election campaigns ==

===Upcoming NSW State Campaign, 2015===
{{Update|section|date=June 2016}}
In New South Wales, the VEP will be standing candidates for the Legislative Council in the state election on 28 March 2015. The lead candidate for the VEP in the [[New South Wales state election, 2015]] is Shayne Higson. Mrs Higson began advocating for voluntary assisted dying legislation after her mother died from a brain tumour in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Caddy |first1=Amelia |title=Shayne helpless in the face of mother's suffering |url=http://www.illawarramercury.com.au/story/1493221/shayne-helpless-in-the-face-of-mothers-suffering/ |website=The Illawarra Mercury |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016 federal election===
In the [[Australian federal election, 2016|2016 federal election]] the Voluntary Euthanasia Party fielded two [[Australian Senate|senate]] candidates in each of New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria, and one candidate in Victoria for the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] seat of [[Division of Menzies|Menzies]].&lt;ref name="2016candidates"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aec.gov.au/election/candidates.htm |title=Candidates for the 2016 federal election |date=12 June 2016 |access-date=12 June 2016 |publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
The VEP has over 3500 members (current as of February 2015), many of whom are also members of their state dying with dignity branch, voluntary euthanasia organisation and/or Exit International.
