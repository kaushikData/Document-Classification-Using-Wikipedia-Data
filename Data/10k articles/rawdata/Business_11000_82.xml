==Early life==
Andy Lau was born in [[Tai Po]], [[Hong Kong]], a son of a [[fireman]] (劉禮). His family was considered to be wealthy as his grandfather was a landowner, but his father left with him to the slums of [[Diamond Hill]] when he was six, where the area was full of wooden houses, and was burnt down when he was eleven. As a young boy, Lau had to fetch water for his family up to eight times a day because their house was not equipped with [[plumbing]].&lt;ref name="radio86"&gt;{{cite web| website= Radio86.co.uk| url= http://www.radio86.co.uk/explore-learn/culture/1266/andy-lau-from-tiger-to-heavenly-king?comment=1| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150610202632/http://www.radio86.co.uk/explore-learn/culture/1266/andy-lau-from-tiger-to-heavenly-king?comment=1 |archivedate=10 June 2015 |title= Andy Lau: From tiger to heavenly king| access-date= 31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from a Band One secondary school, [[Ho Lap College]] in [[San Po Kong]], [[Kowloon]].&lt;ref name="sina2"&gt;{{cite web| website= Sina.com| url= http://news.sina.com/m/2007-08-25/02061688771.shtml | title= 五虎"恩怨：李家乘和劉德華的終極PK| language= | date= | accessdate= 31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named as Lau Fook-wing (劉福榮) during his academic years.

==Career==
===Actor===
{{see also|Andy Lau filmography}}
In 1981, Lau signed up for the artist training program offered by [[Television Broadcasts Limited|TVB]], which is where his acting career began.&lt;ref name="yes1"&gt;{{cite web| website= Yesasia.com| url= http://www.yesasia.com/us/yumcha/andy-lau-the-face-of-hong-kong/0-0-0-arid.10-en/featured-article.html | title= Andy Lau – The Face of Hong Kong| language= | date= | access-date= 1 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lead role which led to his initial popularity was in the 1982 [[TVB]] series ''[[The Emissary (TV series)|The Emissary]]''. In 1983, Lau's role as ''"[[Yang Guo]]"'' in the TVB ''[[wuxia]]'' series, ''[[The Return of the Condor Heroes (1983 TV series)|The Return of the Condor Heroes]]'' (神鵰俠侶) further increased his popularity. From then on, he would take on many of the lead roles in many TVB series.

In September 1983, TVB was looking to increase their ratings in competition with Korea and Japan for the best variety show.  The station then created the show ''TVB All-star challenge'' (星光熠熠勁爭輝) featuring almost the entire line-up of the most popular actors and singers at the time.&lt;ref name="big5ch1"&gt;{{cite web| website= Big5.china.com| url= http://big5.china.com/gate/big5/lianzai.china.com/books/html/436/1981/17462.html |title= [Unknown] | publisher= }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted= yes }}." ''第二章 影視新星 無線電視臺的五虎將''. Korea referred as Goryeo (高麗). Retrieved on 31 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Lau, along with [[Tony Leung Chiu-wai|Tony Leung]], [[Michael Miu]], [[Felix Wong]], and [[Kent Tong]] were branded as the "[[Five Tiger Generals of TVB]]" (無線五虎將) due to their popularity on the show.&lt;ref name="big5ch1" /&gt;

In the late '80s, Lau left [[TVB]] due to contract problems. TVB wanted to bind him to an exclusive five-year contract which Lau refused to sign, so TVB [[blacklist]]ed him. He then focused on his film career.&lt;ref name="radio86"/&gt;

In 1981, Lau made a guest appearance in one of [[Susanna Kwan]]'s music videos and caught the eye of the manager [[Teddy Robin]].&lt;ref name="sina1"&gt;{{cite web| work= Sina.com| url= http://dailynews.sina.com/bg/ent/chnstar/sinacn/20091206/2258938138.html | title= 劉德華 一張老臉 還擄少女心| date= | access-date= 27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teddy Robin then gave Lau a chance to play a small role in the movie ''Once Upon a Rainbow''.&lt;ref name="sina1" /&gt; This was the first step in Lau's film acting career.&lt;ref name="sina1" /&gt; He landed a role in [[Ann Hui]]'s 1982 film ''[[Boat People (film)|Boat People]]''.&lt;ref name="yes1" /&gt; Later in 1983 he had his first leading role in the [[Shaw Brothers Studio|Shaw Brothers]]-produced action film, ''[[On the Wrong Track]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| website= Lovehkfilm.com| url= http://www.lovehkfilm.com/reviews_2/on_the_wrong_track.htm | title= Film review |date= | access-date= 31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his early leading roles included the more serious 1988 film, ''[[The Truth (1988 film)|The Truth]]'' (法內情). However, Lau is best known in films for his (often) recurring roles as a "Heroic Gangster", such as [[Wong Kar-wai]]'s 1988 film ''[[As Tears Go By (film)|As Tears Go By]]'', and [[Benny Chan (film director)|Benny Chan]]'s 1990 film ''[[A Moment of Romance]]''.

Though a respectable actor, Lau was initially known more for his handsome features.  Some people he has worked with have called him a [[matinee idol]], but he has claimed to be an artist.&lt;ref name="Time1" /&gt; Lau has proved his acting skills in many of his films. His first major acting prize came with ''[[A Fighter's Blues]]'', which was his first [[Golden Bauhinia Awards|Golden Bauhinia Award]] for Best Actor.&lt;ref&gt;Dianying.com. "[http://www.dianying.com/ft/awards/goldenbauhinia/28 Dianying.com]." ''第 6 屆金紫荊獎頒獎''. Retrieved on 31 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He would win the [[Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actor]] award that year for ''[[Running Out of Time (1999 film)|Running out of Time]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.hkfaa.com/history/list_19.html|title=19th Hong Kong Film Awards|language=Chinese|publisher=Official website of [[Hong Kong Film Awards]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he won the prestigious [[Golden Horse Award for Best Leading Actor]] for his performance in ''[[Infernal Affairs III]]'', the second sequel to the popular ''[[Infernal Affairs]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| website= Dajiyuan.com| url= http://www.dajiyuan.com/b5/4/12/4/n737526.htm| title= 第41屆金馬獎 劉德華稱帝楊貴媚封后| language= | access-date= 31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also known to Western audiences for starring in ''[[wuxia]]'' films such as ''[[House of Flying Daggers]]'', which was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography]].

In 2005, Lau received the "No.1 Box office Actor 1985–2005" award of Hong Kong, yielding a box office total of [[Hong Kong dollar|HKD]] 1,733,275,816 for shooting 108 films in the past 20 years.&lt;ref name="radio86" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Madamet"/&gt; The aforementioned figure is as compared to the first runner-up [[Stephen Chow]]'s (HKD 1,317,452,311) and second runner-up [[Jackie Chan]]'s (HKD 894,090,962). "I've never imagined that it would be as much as 1.7&amp;nbsp;billion!" he told reporters.  For his contributions, a wax figure of Lau was unveiled on 1 June, 2005 at the [[Madame Tussauds Hong Kong]].&lt;ref name="Xinhuanet.com"&gt;{{cite web| website= Xinhuanet.com| url= http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-06/02/content_3034722.htm |title= Wax figure of Andy Lau unveiled| date= | access-date= 31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Lau also received the "Nielsen Box Office Star of Asia" award by the [[Nielsen Company]] ([[ACNielsen]]).&lt;ref name="Focus Films" /&gt;

===Film producer===
In 1991, Lau set up his own film production company, [[Teamwork Motion Pictures]], which in 2002 was renamed to [[Focus Group Holdings Limited]]. His contributions in the film industry as well as his involvement in nurturing new talent in the Asian film industry led him to winning the "Asian Filmmaker of the Year" award in the [[Pusan International Film Festival]] in 2006.&lt;ref name="Focus Films" /&gt; Some of the films Lau has produced include award-winning films, ''[[Made in Hong Kong (film)|Made in Hong Kong]]'' and ''[[A Simple Life]]'', his 100th film, ''[[A Fighter's Blues]]'' the Chinese digital film ''[[Crazy Stone (film)|Crazy Stone]]'', and big budget action blockbusters, ''[[Firestorm (2013 film)|Firestorm]]'' and ''[[Shock Wave (film)|Shock Wave]]''.

===Musical career===
[[File:Andylau in concert 4.30.2011-02.jpg|thumb|250px|Andy Lau in concert 2011]]
{{see also|Andy Lau discography}}
Lau released his first album ''"Only Know that I Still Love You"'' (只知道此刻愛你) under [[Capital Artists]] in 1985.&lt;ref name="radio86" /&gt; This album was not a big hit,&lt;ref name="radio86" /&gt; but despite having a voice not traditionally associated with popular music, Lau's hard work and perseverance resulted in him becoming one of the most successful singers in [[Cantopop]]. His singing career reached stellar status in 1990 with the release of the album entitled ''"Would It Be Possible"'' (可不可以), and his subsequent releases only solidified his status as a marketable singer.&lt;ref name="radio86" /&gt; For that song, he would win his first [[1990 RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards]].  He would then win at least one [[RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards|RTHK award category]] every year consecutively until the year 2007.

From [[Jade Solid Gold Top 10 Awards]] he has won the "Most Popular Hong Kong Male Artist" award 7 times and the "Asia Pacific Most Popular Hong Kong Male Artist" award 15 times.&lt;ref name="radio86" /&gt; He was also entered into the [[Guinness World Records]] for "Most Awards Won by a Cantopop Male Artist". By April 2000, he had already won an unprecedented total of 292 awards.&lt;ref name="radio86" /&gt;

Many of Lau's songs quickly topped the music charts not only in Hong Kong, but also in Taiwan, [[Mainland China]], and in many different parts of Asia.  Some of his most notable hits include "The Days We Spent Together" (一起走過的日子), "If You Are My Legend" (如果你是我的傳說), "The Tide" (潮水), "Forget Love Potion" (忘情水), "True Forever" (真永遠), "Chinese people" (中國人), "Love You Forever" (愛你一萬年), "You Are My Woman" (你是我的女人), and "Secret Admiration" (暗裡著迷).  Besides singing in [[Cantonese]] and [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], he has also sung in other languages such as English, Japanese, [[Malay language|Malay]], and [[Taiwanese Hokkien]].  One example of a Hokkien song was (世界第一等), and he has also performed a Cantonese cover of Joan Jett's "[[I Hate Myself for Loving You]]" (我恨我痴心).

Since the early 1990s, Lau, along with [[Jacky Cheung]], [[Aaron Kwok]], and [[Leon Lai]] have been referred to by the Chinese media as the Cantopop [[Four Heavenly Kings (Hong Kong)|Four Heavenly Kings]].&lt;ref name="X1" /&gt;

Lau sang alongside [[Jackie Chan]] during a part of the [[2008 Summer Olympics closing ceremony]] on 24 August, 2008. In addition, Lau, who has been supporting disabled athletes in Hong Kong for more than a decade, was appointed as the Goodwill ambassador for the [[2008 Summer Paralympics]].&lt;ref name="sina English"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://english.sina.com/sports/p/2008/0906/184566.html|title=Beijing Paralympic theme song shows love for life |website= Sina.com| date= September 6, 2008| access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He led other performers in singing and performing the song ''"Everyone is No.1"'' at the [[Beijing National Stadium]] just a few hours before the [[2008 Summer Paralympics#Opening ceremony|2008 Paralympics opening ceremony]] began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/95374/95375/6494350.html|title=Beijing 2008 Paralympic Games |website= peopledaily.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also sang the theme song "Flying with the Dream" with [[Han Hong (singer)|Han Hong]] during the Paralympics opening ceremony on 6 September 2008.&lt;ref name= "sina English" /&gt;

As a songwriter, Lau's only creative works are as a lyricist. Most of the songs he has written have been for himself.

===Appearance in other media===
Lau is alleged to have been featured as a [[non-player character]] (NPC) as a random pedestrian in a [[Nonlinear gameplay|sandbox-style]] action video game called ''[[Prototype (video game)|Prototype]]''. On 6 July, the Hong Kong local newspapers [[Headline Daily]] and [[Sing Tao Daily]] reported on Lau's cameo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.hkheadline.com/digital/digital_content.asp?contid=58389&amp;srctype=g&amp;catid=878|title=頭條日報 頭條網 - 變種戰士易容鬥法|website= hkheadline.com | date= | access-date= | language= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lau was severely injured on 16 January 2017, when he was thrown off and stomped on by a horse during a commercial shoot in [[Thailand]].

The '''Austrian Federal Economic Chamber''' ([[German language|de]]: ''Wirtschaftskammer Österreich'' or '''WKO''') functions as the federal parent organization for the nine [[States of Austria|State]] Chambers and 110 trade associations for different industries within [[Austria]]'s [[economy|system of economy]].&lt;ref name="AdvantageAustria"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advantageaustria.org/international/index.en.html|title=AdvantageAustria|accessdate= December 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most State Chambers and associations have local offices to provide services in close proximity to members. 
&lt;!--The Presiding Committee of the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber consists of President Christoph Leitl, the Vice Presidents Richard Schenz, Martha Schultz, Matthias Krenn, Christoph Matznetter, Ulrike Rabmer-Koller and Jürgen Roth, Secretary General Anna Maria Hochhauser and Deputy Secretary General Herwig Höllinger.&lt;ref name="WKO Management"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wko.at/Content.Node/wir/Management_of_the_Austrian_Federal_Economic_Chamber.html|title=WKO Management|accessdate= June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;      

Compulsory membership by Austrian federal law is automatic with obtaining the operating licence of the company and thus includes all Austrian [[Company|companies]] in operation. The resultant membership of 517.477 active businesses as per 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wko.at/statistik/jahrbuch/mg-km.pdf|title=Yearbook of the Federal Economic Chamber|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes diverse sectors such as trade and [[craft]], [[commerce]], [[industry]], [[transportation]], [[tourism]], services industries, [[finance]] and [[insurance]], but not agriculture, as this sector is served by its own Chamber.

==Main tasks and activities==
[[File:Wirtschaftskammer Österreich.jpg|thumb|Building of the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Austrian Industry Day in Vienna|url=http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann14070/|website=www.eso.org|publisher=European Southern Observatory|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Representation of membership interests at all levels of government. By law governments are obliged to consult with Chambers on legislative projects and important regulation. In many laws a provision is made to involve Chambers in decision-making and administrative procedures. 
Information and advisory service to members: Typical issues include taxation, labour law, vocational training, industry-specific legislation, industry-wide advertising and market research.

===Collective bargaining with unions===
Trade associations engage in negotiations with their respective sectoral countrywide union. 
Economic Promotion and Development as well as training and consulting are mainly organised by a specialised department in each region (WIFI, Wirtschaftsfoerderungsinstitut).

===Business Support===
Business Support and Promotion of International Trade is provided by a specialised department at a national level (AWO - AUSSENWIRTSCHAFT ÖSTERREICH), 110 field offices around the world (Austrian Trade Commissions) plus a network of specialised experts within the State Chambers. 
Public law (Wirtschaftskammergesetz) provides a legal foundation for the Austrian Federal Economic Chambers, supplying the legal framework for all Chambers, their co-operation, mandatory membership, and rules for setting membership fees. Although established by public law the Federal Economic Chambers are exclusively business driven.

Every 5 years entrepreneurs elect officers and representatives for the trade associations and the Chamber (amounting to a total of more than 10.000 officers) from their own ranks. In these elections free associations of entrepreneurs field their candidates to compete for the leadership of the Chambers and individual trade associations. Some of these entrepreneurial associations are affiliated with political parties while others are independent platforms. Since 1999,[[Dr. Christoph Leitl]] has been elected President of the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber thrice.

[[File:Wirtschaftskammer Graz 20130802.jpg|thumb|Building of the Economic Chamber in [[Graz]].]]
The Austrian Federal Economic Chamber is financially self-sufficient with around 85% of expenditure covered by member contributions and a further 15% by revenues from marketable sales. This factor, combined with organisational management through democratic self-government, makes us fully independent from public authorities.

==AdvantageAustria.org==
In Austria the promotion of foreign trade constitutes, by law, one major part of the activities of the Economic Chamber. The immense importance of foreign trade to Austria is reflected in the extraordinary range of services provided by AdvantageAustria.org (AWO - AUSSENWIRTSCHAFT ÖSTERREICH) with an international network of 113&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wko.at/Content.Node/service/aussenwirtschaft/AussenwirtschaftsCenter.html&lt;/ref&gt; Austrian Trade Offices worldwide, in most cases sections of the Austrian embassies in the respective countries.

Furthermore, AdvantageAustria.org offers Austrian businesses a wide range of complementary services including: specialist services related to Austria's EU membership, information and advice. The primary aim is to help create and sustain successful sales and promotion of Austrian goods and services in international markets.

AdvantageAustria.org is also responsible for the organization of trade missions and official participation in international trade fairs and provides advice and assistance to inbound buying missions.

The heads of each Austrian Trade Offices, the Austrian Trade Commissioners or Delegates, help Austrian companies to find new contacts and develop existing business. Trade Commissioners put buyers in contact with potential agents, importers and co-operation partners. They also obtain credit ratings and assist with trade name and patent registration.

'''''Business Games''''' was a software package published by [[Acornsoft]] for the [[BBC Micro]] (Model A and Model B) and [[Acorn Electron]]. It was released in the ''Acornsoft Education'' range and includes two [[business simulation game]]s; ''Stokmark'' and ''Telemark''.

==Gameplay==

===Stokmark===
''Stokmark'' is a simulation of the [[stock market]]. Up to eight players take turns to either buy or sell shares in a choice of four companies. As well as the price, players are given the [[P/E ratio|price-to-earnings ratio]] and [[dividend yield]]. Prices change instantly when transactions are made (usually based on the standard [[supply and demand]] principle although there is a random element). After each round a news story is displayed which affects the value of certain shares. After every four rounds, players are awarded [[dividends]] on the shares they hold and are ranked on their total current value (of both cash and shares). The object of the game is to make the largest amount of profit.&lt;ref name="instructions"&gt;[http://8bs.com/elecgame/businessgames.htm Original instructions] reproduced at 8bs.com (cited 2011-11-07)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Telemark===
''Telemark'' is a four player game where each player has to make decisions based on the manufacturing of televisions. This includes whether to build or extend factories, spend on improving management or marketing, and setting the price. When the player enters their price, it is not displayed on the screen so other players do not know what their competitors are charging until the end of each round. The game introduces terms and reports such as [[market share]], [[Overhead (business)|overheads]], [[Income statement|profit and loss accounts]] and [[balance sheet]]s. The instruction booklet provides detailed instructions on working out the [[Break-even (economics)|break-even]] point as well as blank worksheets to be filled out by the players. The winner is the player who has made the most profit after a set number of rounds or the first player to gain more than half the market share for televisions.&lt;ref name="instructions" /&gt;

==Release==
''Business Games'' was released in 1983 as part of Acornsoft's Education range which was aimed at schools as well as home users. As it only requires 16k [[Random-access memory|RAM]], it runs on the [[BBC Micro]] Model A as well as the Model B. It was also released for the [[Acorn Electron]] in 1984. The instructions recommend the games for teaching business and economic studies&lt;ref name="instructions" /&gt; but the Acorn Electron version in particular was well known among home users, as it was often included with the Acornsoft software packs bundled with Electrons in 1984 and 1985.&lt;ref name="software pack"&gt;[http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/eug/66/a-rare.html "What's It Worth"] Dave E, EUG #66, Electron User Group "Most Electrons came bundled with five Acornsoft games (Typically Arcadians, Boxer, Business Games, Chess and Hopper)"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The package was reviewed by Ken Garrett for [[The Micro User]] which was largely positive. ''Stokmark'' was described as "a well-presented and useful introduction to some investment terms" but also "rather repetitive".&lt;ref name="micro user"&gt;[http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/themicrouser/reviews/games/businessgames.htm "Business Games"], The Micro User, Database Publications, Vol 2 No 1, March 1984&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed ''Telemark'' is "a good game and to be properly appreciated must be played seriously".&lt;ref name="micro user" /&gt;

A '''chief information security officer''' ('''CISO''') is the senior-level executive within an [[organization]] responsible for establishing and maintaining the enterprise vision, strategy, and program to ensure information assets and technologies are adequately protected. The CISO directs staff in identifying, developing, implementing, and maintaining processes across the enterprise to reduce information and [[information technology]] (IT) risks. They respond to incidents, establish appropriate standards and controls, manage security technologies, and direct the establishment and implementation of policies and procedures. The CISO is also usually responsible for information-related compliance (e.g. supervises the implementation to achieve [[ISO/IEC 27001]] certification for an entity, or a part of it).

Typically, the CISO's influence reaches the entire organization. Responsibilities may include, but not be limited to:&lt;!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER --&gt;
* [[Computer emergency response team]]/computer security incident response team
* [[Cybersecurity]]
* [[Disaster recovery]] and [[business continuity management]]
* [[Identity and access management]]
* [[Information privacy]]
* Information [[regulatory compliance]] (e.g., US [[PCI DSS]], [[FISMA]], [[GLBA]], [[HIPAA]]; UK [[Data Protection Act 1998]]; Canada [[PIPEDA]], Europe [[General Data Protection Regulation|GDPR]])
* [[Information risk management]]
* [[Information security]] and [[information assurance]]
* [[Information security operations center]] (ISOC)
* [[Information technology controls]] for financial and other systems
* IT investigations, [[digital forensics]], [[eDiscovery]]
* [[Security architecture]] 

Having a CISO or the equivalent function in the organization has become a standard in business, government, and non-profit sectors. Throughout the world, a growing number of organizations have a CISO. By 2009, approximately 85% of large organizations had a security executive, up from 56% in 2008, and 43% in 2006. In 2011, in a survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers for their Annual Information Security Survey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Information Security Survey|publisher=PricewaterhouseCoopers|accessdate={{date|2012-05-27}}|url=http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/information-security-survey}}&lt;/ref&gt; 80% of businesses had a CISO or equivalent. About one-third of these security chiefs report to a [[Chief Information Officer]]  (CIO), 35% to [[Chief Executive Officer]] (CEO), and 28% to the board of directors.

In corporations, the trend is for CISOs to have a strong balance of business acumen and technology knowledge. CISOs are often in high demand and compensation is comparable to other C-level positions who also hold a similar [[corporate title]].

Independent organizations such as [[Holistic Information Security Practitioner]] Institute (HISPI) and [[EC-Council]] provide training, education and certification by promoting a holistic approach to Cybersecurity to Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs), Information Security Officers (ISOs), Information Security Managers, Directors of Information Security, Security Analysts, Security Engineers and Technology Risk Managers from major corporations and organizations.

Common reasons for counseling statements in the workforce: not finishing one's assignments/tasks, [[no call, no show|unexcused absences or tardies]], loss of money (such as cashiers), insubordination. Different jobs have different ways of writing and announcing counseling statements.

'''David Henderson''' is a [[Christchurch]], [[New Zealand]] based property developer.

In 1994 he founded the [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] magazine the ''[[Free Radical (magazine)|Free Radical]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 30 Issues On | work = The Free Radical Online | url = http://www.freeradical.co.nz/content/30/30deborah.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a student of [[Zenith Applied Philosophy]], "It really sparked my interest. I found it greatly stimulating and inspiring, immensely so. They got a terribly bad name, a bad rap."&lt;ref name=listener&gt;{{cite web | title = Change of Heart | work = New Zealand Listener | url = http://www.listener.co.nz/issue/3471/features/7508/change_of_heart.html | date = 2006-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1992 to 1995 he was audited 27 times after claiming a [[Goods and Services Tax (New Zealand)|GST]] refund and the [[Inland Revenue Department (New Zealand)|Inland Revenue Department]] demanded he pay $NZ924,341 in taxes and penalties. He was charged with fraud, his business failed and he was bankrupted and had to sell his house. The IRD eventually conceded that he did not owe it $NZ924,341, and fraud charges against him were dropped. They also admitted that they owed him $NZ64,000.This experience led him to write a book ''Be Very Afraid: One Man's Stand Against the IRD''.  In 2007 his story was made into a film by [[South Pacific Pictures]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Entrepreneur's tax battle subject of film | work = The Star Canterbury | url = http://www.starcanterbury.co.nz/localnews/storydisplay.cfm?storyid=3732555&amp;thesection=localnews&amp;thesubsection=&amp;thesecondsubsection= | date = 4 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930180203/http://www.starcanterbury.co.nz/localnews/storydisplay.cfm?storyid=3732555&amp;thesection=localnews&amp;thesubsection=&amp;thesecondsubsection= |archivedate=30 September 2007 |accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; entitled ''[[We're Here To Help]]''.

Henderson's company, Property Ventures Limited is undertook a number of developments including the billion dollar new town, Five Mile, in [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]].  This failed and the resulting site was known as "Hendo's hole"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Hendo's hole' has new owner|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/southland-times/business/3081000/Hendos-hole-has-new-owner|publisher=Southland times|date=20 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007 saw the opening in Christchurch of a new style of hotel named HotelSO. This building, acquired by Henderson in 2004, was occupied by the Inland Revenue Department.

Applications were made in the High Court at Christchurch on 16 May 2008 to have Mr Henderson's Five Mile Holdings and Property Ventures placed in liquidation. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/thepress/4597004a6530.html |title=Liquidation action looms |date=25 June 2008 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early August 2008, the [[Christchurch City Council]] held a short-notice urgent meeting about sensitive central city property purchases, then on 8 August 2008 announced that it would buy five of Henderson's properties&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccc.govt.nz/MediaReleases/2008/August/08164234.asp&lt;/ref&gt; for approximately $NZ17 million. Henderson was to have first option to buy back the properties. This decision caused much civic controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/thepress/4652136a6009.html |title=Business lobby questions Henderson deals |date=11 August 2008 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The High Court in Christchurch placed Henderson in bankruptcy on 29 November 2010.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_4403232"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/4403232/Property-developer-David-Henderson-placed-in-bankruptcy |title=Property developer David Henderson placed in bankruptcy |author=Martin van Beynen |authorlink=Martin van Beynen |date=29 November 2010 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insolvency.govt.nz/&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuhrmann’s attended primary school in Vienna before progressing to a [[Gymnasium (school)|Grammar school]].   Between 1936 and 1941 he attended a technical high school.  During the [[Second World War|war]] he undertook his military service before returning to civilian life.

In 1952/53 he provided significant input to the development of the 547 engine which became known as the Fuhrmann engine.   This is a four-cylinder boxer engine with two overhead camshafts, driven by [[bevel gears]], for each of the two cylinder banks.

'''Estoppel''' is a judicial device in [[common law jurisdictions|common law legal systems]] whereby a [[court]] may prevent, or "estop" a person from making assertions or from going back on his or her word; the person being sanctioned is "estopped".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/E/Estoppel.aspx|title=Estoppel Definition|publisher=Duhaime's Law Dictionary|accessdate=18 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222171456/http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/E/Estoppel.aspx|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' defines estoppel as a "bar or impediment raised by the law, which precludes a man from alleging or from denying a certain fact or state of facts, in consequence of his previous allegation or denial or conduct or admission, or in consequence of a final adjudication of the matter in a court of law".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelawdictionary.org/estoppel/|title=Estoppel|publisher=''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]''|accessdate=18 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151213120728/http://thelawdictionary.org/estoppel/|archivedate=13 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estoppel may prevent someone from  bringing a particular claim, particularly if a promise unsupported by consideration{{clarify|date=March 2018}} is being relied on by the other party.&lt;ref name="High Trees"&gt;''[[Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd]]'' [1947] [[Kings Bench Law Reports|KB]] 130.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Legal doctrine]]s of estoppel are based in both [[common law]] and [[Equity (law)|equity]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''Jorden v Money''  [1854] 10 ER 868&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://swarb.co.uk/jorden-and-louisa-his-wife-v-money-hl-30-jul-1854/ ''Jorden v Money'']&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is also a concept in [[international law]].&lt;ref&gt;T. COTTIER, H. P. MÜLLER, "[http://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690-e1401 Estoppel]" in ''Max Planck encyclopedia of Public International Law'', april 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of estoppel==
There are many different types of estoppel which can arise, but the common thread between them is that a person is restrained from asserting a particular position in law where it would be inequitable to do so. By way of illustration:

* If a landlord promises the tenant that he will not exercise his right to terminate a lease, and relying upon that promise the tenant spends money improving the premises, the doctrine of ''[[promissory estoppel]]'' may prevent the landlord from exercising a right to terminate, even though his promise might not otherwise have been legally binding as a contract. The landlord is precluded from asserting a specific ''right''.
* If a person brings legal proceedings in one country claiming that a second person negligently injured them and the courts of that country determine that there was no negligence, then under the doctrine of ''[[issue estoppel]]'' the first person will not normally be able to argue before the courts of another country that the second person was negligent (whether in respect of the same claim or a related claim). The first person is precluded from asserting a specific ''claim''.

Estoppel is an equitable doctrine.&lt;ref name="Waltons HCA"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|7|1988|litigants=[[Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher]] |parallelcite=(1988) 164 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 387 |date=19 February 1988 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, any person wishing to assert an estoppel must normally come to the court with "[[clean hands]]".

The doctrine of estoppel (which may prevent a party from asserting a right) is often confused with the doctrine of [[waiver]] (which relates to relinquishing a right once it has arisen). It also substantially overlaps with, but is distinct from, the equitable doctrine of [[Laches (equity)|laches]].

==Etymology and usage==
The verb is ''estop'', which comes from [[Middle English]] ''estoppen'', itself borrowed from [[Old French]] ''estop(p)er'', ''estouper'', presumably from [[Vulgar Latin]] *''stuppāre.'' 'to stop up with tow, caulk', from [[Latin]] ''stuppa'', 'broken flax', from [[Ancient Greek]] ''stuppe'', 'broken flax'.&lt;ref&gt;"estop" and "stop", in ''American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'' (2004), Fourth Edition, Boston:  Houghton Mifflin.&lt;/ref&gt; The noun form ''estoppel'' is based on the [[Old French]] ''estoupail,'' 'stopper, bung', a derivative of ''estouper''.

Where a court finds that a party has done something warranting a form of estoppel, that party is said to be estopped from making certain related arguments or claiming certain related rights. The defendant is estopped from presenting the related defence, or the plaintiff is estopped from making the related argument against the defendant. [[Edward Coke|Lord Coke]] stated, "It is called an estoppel or conclusion, because a man's own act or acceptance stoppeth or closeth up his mouth to allege or plead the truth."&lt;ref&gt;2 Coke, Littleton 352a&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Estoppel is sometimes said to be a rule of evidence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ceds.vu.edu.au/buslaw/centrallon.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125082725/http://ceds.vu.edu.au/buslaw/centrallon.htm |archivedate=2012-01-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereby a person is barred from leading evidence of a fact that has already been settled or they are otherwise precluded from asserting, but that may be an oversimplification. Firstly, although some estoppels relate to preventing a party from asserting ''facts'', others relate to preventing a party from asserting a ''right'' or a ''claim''. Secondly, under the [[conflict of laws]] in common law jurisdictions, matters of evidence are usually treated as [[Procedure in conflict of laws|procedural matters]] for the law of the local court (the ''[[lex fori]]''), whereas it is generally accepted that an estoppel may affect substantive rights and are therefore matters to be determined by the proper law (or ''[[lex causae]]'') that governs the particular issue.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dicey Morris &amp; Collins]], 14th ed. (2006) at '''7-031''': "For the purposes of English domestic law, estoppel is sometimes said to be a rule of evidence.  Whether ... it should be regarded as a rule of substance or procedure ... may well vary with the type of estoppel under consideration."&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many different types of estoppel that can arise under common law legal systems. It has been judicially noted on more than one occasion that the link between them is often somewhat tenuous. ''Treitel on Contracts'' notes that "unconscionability...provides the link between them", but they nevertheless have "separate requirements and different terrains of application".&lt;ref&gt;''Treitel on Contracts'', 14th ed. (2015) at '''3-090'''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The courts have long abandoned an attempt to create a single general underlying rationale or principle:
{{Cquote|the attempt... to demonstrate that all estoppels... are now subsumed in the single and all-embracing estoppel by representation and that they are all governed by the same principle [has] never won general acceptance.&lt;br /&gt;{{align|right|-- [[Peter Millett, Baron Millett|Lord Millett]]&lt;ref&gt;''First National Bank plc v Thompson'' [1996] Ch 231 at 236&lt;/ref&gt;}}}}

The plea of estoppel is often closely connected with the plea of [[waiver]], the object of both being to ensure [[bona fide]]s in day-to-day transactions.&lt;ref name=Olga&gt;India -- ''Olga Tellis v. Bombay Municipal Corporation'' (1985.07.10) (Right to Life and Livelihood for Homeless)&lt;/ref&gt; It is also related to the doctrines of variation and election. It is applied in many areas of contract law, including insurance, banking, and employment. In [[English law]], the concept of [[legitimate expectation]] in the realm of [[administrative law]] and [[judicial review]] is estoppel's counterpart in [[public law]].

Promissory estoppel is often applied where there is an agreement without a consideration, or the consideration is future-based (as a promise). When applied in defense by a defendant it may be called a "shield", and where applied by a plaintiff it may be called a "sword".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://mq.academia.edu/EsterLioe/Papers/1141002/Promissory_Estoppel_Serves_as_a_Shield_and_a_Swords_Guarding_Unconscionable|title=Promissory Estoppel Serves as a Shield and a Swords Guarding Unconscionable|first=Ester|last=Lioe|date=|website=academia.edu|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425121254/http://mq.academia.edu/EsterLioe/Papers/1141002/Promissory_Estoppel_Serves_as_a_Shield_and_a_Swords_Guarding_Unconscionable|archivedate=2012-04-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australiancontractlaw.com/cases/walton.html|title=Australian Contract Law - Julie Clarke|author=|date=|website=www.australiancontractlaw.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313074030/http://www.australiancontractlaw.com/cases/walton.html|archivedate=2014-03-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most commonly used as a shield,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coursework.info/University/Law/Contract_Law/Promissory_Estoppel_is_a_shield_not_a_sw_L845199.html|title=Promissory Estoppel is a shield not a sword - University Law - Marked by Teachers.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=coursework.info|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120129021800/http://www.coursework.info/University/Law/Contract_Law/Promissory_Estoppel_is_a_shield_not_a_sw_L845199.html|archivedate=2012-01-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some commentators stating that it can only be used as a shield, although this varies with jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://netk.net.au/Contract/07Estoppel.asp|title=Contract Law lecture - Estoppel - its origins and forms|author=|date=|website=netk.net.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples ===
Estoppel can be understood by considering examples such as the following:

#A city entered into a contract with another party. The contract stated that it had been reviewed by the city's counsel and that the contract was proper.  Estoppel applied to estop the city from claiming the contract was invalid.&lt;ref&gt;''Speckman v. City of Indianapolis'', 540 N.E.2d 1189, 1191 (Ind. 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;
#A [[creditor]] unofficially informs a [[debtor]] that the creditor forgives the [[debt]] between them. Even if such forgiveness is not formally documented, the creditor may be estopped from changing its mind and seeking to collect the debt, because that change would be unfair.
#A [[landlord]] informs a [[leasehold estate|tenant]] that rent has been reduced, for example, because there was construction or a lapse in utility services. If the tenant relies on this statement in choosing to remain in the premises, the landlord could be estopped from collecting the full rent.

=== Types ===
Some types of estoppel under English, Australian, and American laws are as follows:

==== In civil cases ====
*'''Reliance-based estoppels''': These involve one party relying on something the other party has done or said. The party who performed/spoke is the one who is estopped. This category is discussed [[#Reliance-based estoppels|below]].
*'''Estoppel by record''': This frequently arises as issue/cause of action estoppel or judicial estoppel where the orders or judgments made in previous legal proceedings prevent the parties from relitigating the same issues or causes of action.
*'''[[Estoppel by deed]]''': Situations where rules of [[Evidence (law)|evidence]] prevent a litigant from denying the truth of what was said or done.
*'''Estoppel by silence''' or [[acquiescence]]: Estoppel that prevents a person from asserting something when he had the right and opportunity to do so earlier, and such silence put another person at a disadvantage.
*'''[[Laches (equity)|Laches]]''': Estoppel after a litigant deliberately and avoidably delays an action so as to disadvantage an adversary.

=== In American criminal cases ===
*'''Entrapment by estoppel''': In American criminal law, although "[[ignorance of the law is no excuse]]" is a principle which generally holds for traditional (older [[common law]]) crimes, courts sometimes allow this [[excuse]] as a defense, when defendant can show they reasonably relied on an interpretation of the law by the public official(s) charged with enforcement or interpretation of that law, such as a regulatory official (even if that official's interpretation is later determined to be wrong).&lt;ref name=Twitchell&gt;[[Commonwealth v. Twitchell]], Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, 416 Mass. 114, 617 N. E.2d (1993); Wilkins, Justice&lt;/ref&gt; The defense is based on "[[Equity (law)|fairness]]" principles in the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]].&lt;ref name=Twitchell/&gt; It generally involves [[determination of fact]], not of law,&lt;ref name=Twitchell/&gt; except as to determination of whether the interpreting government official had the legal status asserted by the defense.&lt;ref name=Twitchell/&gt;

== Reliance-based estoppels ==
Reliance-based estoppels (at English law) include:&lt;ref&gt;''Halsbury's Laws of England'', Vol 16(2), 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
*by representation of fact, where one person asserts the truth of a set of facts to another;
*promissory estoppel, where one person makes a promise to another, but there is no enforceable contract; and
*proprietary estoppel, where the parties are litigating the title to land.
Both ''Halsbury's'' and Spencer Bower (see below) describe these three estoppels collectively as '''estoppels by representation'''.  More simply, one party must say or do something and see the other party rely on what is said or done to change behavior.

All reliance-based estoppels require the victimised party to show both ''inducement'' and ''detrimental reliance'', i.e.:
* there must be evidence to show that the representor actually intended the victim to act on the representation or promise, '''or'''
* the victim must satisfy the court that it was reasonable for him or her to act on the relevant representation or promise, '''and'''
* what the victim did must either have been reasonable, '''or'''
* the victim did what the representor intended, '''and'''
* the victim would suffer a loss or ''detriment'' if the representor was allowed to deny what was said or done—detriment is measured at the time when the representor proposes to deny the representation or withdraw the promise, not at the time when either was made, '''and'''
* in all the circumstances, the behavior of the representor is such that it would be "unconscionable" to allow him or her to resile.

Simply put, promissory estoppel has four necessary elements which the plaintiff must prove:
* there was a promise
* that was reasonably relied upon
* resulting legal detriment to the promisee
* justice requires enforcement of the promise

Estoppel by representation of fact and promissory estoppel are mutually exclusive: the former is based on a representation of existing fact (or of mixed fact and law), while the latter is based on a promise not to enforce some pre-existing right (i.e. it expresses an intention as to the future). A promissory estoppel operates only between parties who, at the time of the representation, were in an existing relationship, while this is not a requirement for estoppel by representation of fact.

The test for '''[[unconscionability]]''' in the English and Australian courts takes many factors into account, including the behavior, state of mind and circumstances of the parties. Generally, the following eight factors are determinative:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Spence |title=Protecting Reliance: The Emergent Doctrine of Equitable Estoppel |publisher=Hart Publishing |year=1999 |pages=60–66 |ISBN=9781901362626}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*how the promise/representation and reliance upon it were induced;
*the content of the promise/representation;
*the relative knowledge of the parties;
*the parties' relative interest in the relevant activities in reliance;
*the nature and context of the parties' relationship;
*the parties' relative strength of position;
*the history of the parties' relationship; and
*the steps, if any, taken by the promisor/representor to ensure he has not caused preventable harm.

But in ''Cobbe v Yeoman's Row'',&lt;ref name=cobbe&gt;''Cobbe v Yeoman's Row'' [2008] UKHL 55&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Scott of Foscote stated the following:

{{quote|the ingredients for a proprietary estoppel should include, in principle, a proprietary claim made by a claimant and an answer to that claim based on some fact, or point of mixed fact and law, which the person against whom the claim was made could be estopped from asserting. To treat a "proprietary estoppel equity" as requiring simply unconscionable behaviour was a recipe for confusion. The remedy to which, on the facts as found by the judge, the claimant was entitled could be described neither as based on an estoppel nor as proprietary in character. His Lordship's present view was that proprietary estoppel could not be prayed in aid to render enforceable an agreement declared by statute (s.&amp;nbsp;2 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989) to be void. A claim for the imposition of a constructive trust to provide a remedy for a disappointed expectation engendered by a representation made in the course of incomplete contractual negotiations was misconceived and could not be sustained by reliance on unconscionable behaviour. The claimant was, however, entitled to a quantum meruit payment for his services in obtaining the planning permission.}}

=== England and Wales ===
==== Estoppel by representation of fact ====
In English law, '''estoppel by representation of fact''' is a term coined by Spencer Bower. This species of estoppel is also referred to as "common law estoppel by representation" in ''Halsbury's Laws of England'', vol 16(2), 2003 reissue.

Spencer Bower defines estoppel by representation of fact as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Law relating to Estoppel by Representation |edition=4th |first=Spencer |last=Bower |year=2004 |at=para. I.2.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Where one person ('the representor') has made a representation of fact to another person ('the representee') in words or by acts or conduct, or (being under a duty to the representee to speak or act) by silence or inaction, with the intention (actual or presumptive) and with the result of inducing the representee on the faith of such representation to alter his position to his detriment, the representor, in any litigation which may afterwards take place between him and the representee, is estopped, as against the representee, from making, or attempting to establish by evidence, any averment substantially at variance with his former representation, if the representee at the proper time, and in proper manner, objects thereto.}}

A second definition comes from Sean Wilken and Theresa Villiers:&lt;ref name=wilkenvilliers&gt;{{cite book  |title=The Law of Waiver, Variation and Estoppel |first1=Sean |last1=Wilken |first2=Theresa |last2=Villiers |edition=2nd |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|para. 9.02}}

{{quote|An estoppel by representation [of fact] will arise between A and B if the following elements are made out. First, A makes a false representation of fact to B or to a group of which B was a member. [It is not necessary to demonstrate A knew that the representation was untrue.] Second, in making the representation, A intended or [in the alternatively,] knew that it was likely to be acted upon. Third, B, believing the representation, acts to its detriment in reliance on the representation. [It must have been reasonable to rely on the representation.] Fourth, A subsequently seeks to deny the truth of the representation. Fifth, no defence to the estoppel can be raised by A.}}

A representation can be made by words or conduct. Although the representation must be clear and unambiguous, a representation can be inferred from silence where there is a duty to speak or from negligence where a duty of care has arisen. Under English law, estoppel by representation of fact usually acts as a defence, though it may act in support of a cause of action or counterclaim.

==== Equitable estoppel ====
{{Main|Estoppel in English law}}
Under English and Australian legal systems, ''estoppels in [[Equity (law)|equity]]'' include promissory and proprietary estoppels, described below.  (Contrast with estoppel by representation, which is a claim (under the English system) at law.)

===== Proprietary estoppel =====
{{Main|Proprietary estoppel}}
In English law, ''proprietary estoppel'' is distinct from promissory estoppel.  ''Proprietary estoppel'' is not a concept in American law, but a similar result is often reached under the general doctrine of promissory estoppel.

Traditionally, ''proprietary estoppel'' arose in relation to rights to use the land of the owner, and possibly in connection with disputed transfers of ownership.  Although proprietary estoppel was only traditionally available in disputes affecting title to real property, it has now gained limited acceptance in other areas of law.  Proprietary estoppel is closely related to the doctrine of constructive trust.&lt;ref name=cobbe/&gt;

J. Fry summarized the five '''elements''' for proprietary estoppel as:&lt;ref&gt;''Wilmott v Barber'' (1880) 15 Ch D 96&lt;/ref&gt;

* the claimant
** made a mistake as to his legal rights (typically because the actual owner attempted to convey the property, but the transfer is invalid or ineffective for some reason);
** did some act of reliance;
* the defendant
** knows of the existence of a legal right which he (the defendant) possesses, and which is inconsistent with the right claimed by the claimant;
** knows of the claimant's mistaken belief; and
** encouraged the claimant in his act of reliance.

'''Example:''' A father promised a house to his son who took possession and spent a large sum of money improving the property, but the father never actually transferred the house to the son.  Upon the father's death, the son claimed to be the equitable owner. The court found the testamentary trustees (as representatives of the deceased father's estate) were ''estopped'' from denying the son's proprietary interest, and ordered them to convey the land to the son.&lt;ref&gt;''Dillwyn v Llewelyn'' (1862) 4 De G.F.&amp; J. 517 C.A. See also ''Inwards v Baker'' [1965] 2 Q.B. 29, C.A.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Promissory estoppel =====
The [[doctrine]] of ''promissory estoppel'' prevents one party from withdrawing a promise made to a second party if the latter has reasonably relied on that promise.

A promise made without [[consideration]] is generally not enforceable. It is known as a bare or gratuitous promise. Thus, if a car salesman promises a potential buyer not to sell a certain car over the weekend, but does so, the promise cannot be enforced. But should the car salesman accept from the potential buyer even one penny in consideration for the promise, the promise will be enforceable in court by the potential buyer. Estoppel extends the court's purview even to cases where there is no consideration, though it is generally not a 'sword': not a basis on which to initiate a lawsuit.

The doctrine of ''promissory estoppel'' was first developed in ''[[Hughes v. Metropolitan Railway Co]]'' [1877] but was lost for some time until it was resurrected by [[Lord Denning|Denning J]] in the controversial case of ''[[Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd]]''.&lt;ref name="High Trees"/&gt;

Promissory estoppel requires:
#an unequivocal promise by words or conduct
#evidence that there is a change in position of the promisee as a result of the promise (reliance but ''not necessarily to their detriment'')
#inequity if the promisor were to go back on the promise

In general, estoppel is "a shield not a sword"—it cannot be used as the basis of an action on its own.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;''Combe v Combe'' (1951) 2 [[Kings Bench Law Reports|KB]] 215&lt;/ref&gt; It also does not extinguish rights. In ''High Trees'' the plaintiff company was able to restore payment of full rent from early 1945, and could have restored the full rent at any time after the initial promise was made provided a suitable period of notice had been given. In this case, the estoppel was applied to a "negative promise", that is, one where a party promises not to enforce full rights.

Estoppel is an equitable (as opposed to common law) construct and its application is therefore discretionary. In the case of ''[[D &amp; C Builders v. Rees]]'' the courts refused to recognise a promise to accept a part payment of £300 on a debt of £482 on the basis that it was extracted by duress. In ''[[Combe v. Combe]]'' Denning elaborated on the equitable nature of estoppel by refusing to allow its use as a "sword" by an ex-wife to extract funds from the destitute husband.

The general rule is that when one party agrees to accept a lesser sum in full payment of a debt, the debtor has given no consideration, and so the creditor is still entitled to claim the debt in its entirety. This is not the case if the debtor offers payment at an earlier date than was previously agreed, because the benefit to the creditor of receiving payment early can be thought of as consideration for the promise to waive the rest of the debt. This is the rule formulated in ''[[Pinnel's Case]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Pinnel's Case]]'' (1602) 5 Co Rep 117a&lt;/ref&gt; and affirmed in ''[[Foakes v Beer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Foakes v Beer]]'' (1884) 9 App Cas 605&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision of the Court of Appeal in ''Collier v P &amp; MJ Wright (Holdings) Ltd'' suggests that the doctrine of promissory estoppel can now operate to mitigate the harshness of this common law rule.&lt;ref&gt;''Collier v P &amp; MJ Wright (Holdings) Ltd'' 2008 1 WLR 643&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, [[Arden LJ]] held that allowing a creditor to renege on his promise to forebear seeking the balance of a debt in return for part payment would be, in and of itself, inequitable. Therefore, the only reliance that the promisee must demonstrate is the actual making of the part payment. This approach has been criticised as doing violence to the principle set down in Hughes and the extent to which the other members of the Court, namely [[Longmore LJ]], agreed with it is uncertain.

=== United States ===
==== Equitable estoppel ====
Equitable estoppel is the American counterpart to estoppel by representation. Its elements are summarized as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lucian B. |last=Cox |title=Equity: Principles and procedures in Virginia and West Virginia |at=§ 288 |year=1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Facts misrepresented or concealed
*Knowledge of true facts
*Fraudulent intent
*Inducement and reliance
*Injury to complainant
*Clear, concise, unequivocal proof of actus (not by implication)

For example, in ''Aspex Eyewear v. Clariti Eyewear'', eyeglass frame maker Aspex sued competitor Clariti for patent infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/09-1147.pdf|title=''Aspex Eyewear v.

During this period, Clariti expanded its marketing and sales of the products. The [[Federal Circuit]] found that Aspex misled Clariti to believe it would not enforce its patent, and thus estopped Aspex from proceeding with the suit.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Leeman, [http://sunsteinlaw.com/silence-is-deadly-the-peril-of-inaction-after-calling-someone-an-infringer/ "Silence is Deadly: The Peril of Inaction After Calling Someone an Infringer"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714223656/http://sunsteinlaw.com/silence-is-deadly-the-peril-of-inaction-after-calling-someone-an-infringer/ |date=2014-07-14 }}, Sunstein IP Update (June 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Promissory estoppel ====
In many jurisdictions of the United States, ''promissory estoppel'' is an alternative to [[consideration]] as a basis for enforcing a promise. It is also sometimes called ''detrimental reliance.''

The [[American Law Institute]] in 1932 included the principle of estoppel into § 90 of the [[Restatement of Contracts]], stating:

{{quote|A promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance of a definite and substantial character on the part of the promisee and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.|Restatement (Second) removed the requirement that the detriment be "substantial".}}

However:

{{quote|Equitable estoppel is distinct from promissory estoppel. Promissory estoppel involves a clear and definite promise, while equitable estoppel involves only representations and inducements. The representations at issue in promissory estoppel go to future intent, while equitable estoppel involves statement of past or present fact. It is also said that equitable estoppel lies in tort, while promissory estoppel lies in contract. The major distinction between equitable estoppel and promissory estoppel is that the former is available only as a defense, while promissory estoppel can be used as the basis of a cause of action for damages.|28 Am Jur 2d Estoppel and Waiver § 34}}

Suppose that B goes to a store and sees a sign that the price of a radio is $10. B tells the shopkeeper that he will get the money and come back later that day to purchase it; there is no discussion of price. The shopkeeper says that when B returns, he will welcome B as a customer—unless he sells all three of his radios first. Hearing this, B goes and sells his watch for $10 (it was really worth $15, but since B wanted the money right away, he chose not to wait for the best price). When B returns, the sign says $11, and the owner tells B that he has raised the price. In equity, can you argue that the shopkeeper is estopped by conduct? B relied upon the implied representation that a radio would be sold for $10 when he returned with the money; B has sold his watch at a discount, to his detriment. (This element would be absent if B sold the watch at the market price.) But the shopkeeper did not guarantee to hold one of the radios against the possibility of B's return nor did they agree a fixed price.

In some common-law jurisdictions, a promise by the shopkeeper to hold a specific radio would create a binding contract, even if B had to go for the money. A ''promise'' to pay the owner in the future is good consideration if it is made in exchange for a promise to sell a specific radio (one from three is probably sufficiently specific): one promise in exchange for a second promise creates equal value. So the shopkeeper's actual words and knowledge are critical to deciding whether either a contract or an estoppel arises.

The drafters of the Second Restatement debated how to calculate the amount of damages flowing from a promissory estoppel, using the following example: A young man's uncle promises to give him $1,000 to buy a car. The young man buys a car for $500, but the uncle refuses to pay any money. Is the young man entitled to $1,000 (the amount promised), or merely $500 (the amount he actually lost)? The Restatement states that "The remedy granted for breach may be limited as justice requires."—leaving quantification to the discretion of the court. In practice, however, a recent study of over 300 promissory estoppel cases decided under the Restatement (Second) of Contracts has found that many courts continue to enforce the promise to the full extent (i.e., $1,000 in the example above).&lt;ref&gt;[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1373861&amp;download=yes "The Many Faces of Promissory Estoppel: An Empirical Analysis under the Restatement (Second) of Contracts"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325025745/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1373861&amp;download=yes |date=2017-03-25 }}, by Marco Jimenez&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other estoppels ==

=== Pais ===
''Estoppel in pais'' (literally "by act of notoriety", or "solemn formal act") is the historical root of common law estoppel by representation and equitable estoppel. The terms ''Estoppel in pais'' and equitable estoppel are used interchangeably in American law.

=== Convention ===
''Estoppel by convention'' in English law (also known as ''estoppel by agreement'') occurs where two parties negotiate or operate a contract but make a [[Mistake (contract law)|mistake]]. If they share an assumption, belief, or understanding of the contract's interpretation or legal effect, then they are bound by it, if:{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

#They both knew the other had the same belief, and
#They both based their subsequent dealings on those beliefs.

Estoppel by convention is most commonly invoked if one party wishes to rely on pre-contract negotiation as an aid to construction of the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Chartbrook Ltd and another v Persimmon Homes Ltd and another |court=UKHL |division= |year=2009 |num=38 |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is debatable whether ''estoppel by convention'' is a separate estoppel doctrine, or merely a case of ''reliance-based estoppel'' (''estoppel by representation'' would be its most frequent form), or of the rule of interpretation that, where words in a contract are ambiguous, one always interprets those words so as to give effect to the actual intentions of the parties even if that would not be the usual legal outcome (see ''Amalgamated Investment and Property Co. Ltd. v Texas Commerce International Bank Ltd'' [1982] QB 84).

=== Acquiescence ===
{{Main|Estoppel by acquiescence}}

''Estoppel by [[acquiescence]]'' may arise when one person gives a legal warning to another based on some clearly asserted facts or legal principle, and the other does not respond within "a reasonable period of time". By ''acquiescing'', the other person is generally considered to have lost the legal right to assert the contrary.

As an example, suppose that Jill has been storing her car on Jack's land with no contract between them. Jack sends a registered letter to Jill's legal address, stating: "I am no longer willing to allow your car to stay here for free. Please come get your car, or make arrangements to pay me rent for storing it. If you do not do so, within 30 days, I will consider the car abandoned and will claim ownership of it. If you need more time to make arrangements, please contact me within 30 days, and we can work something out." If Jill does not respond, she may be said to have ''relinquished'' her ownership of the car, and ''estoppel by acquiescence'' may prevent any court from invalidating Jack's actions of registering the car in his name and using it as his own.

=== Contractual ===

The law relating to contractual estoppel (in English law) was summarised in {{cite BAILII|litigants=Peekay Intermark Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd |court=EWCA |division=Civ |year=2006 |num=386 |date= }}:

{{cquote|There is no reason in principle why parties to a contract should not agree that a certain state of affairs should form the basis for the transaction, whether it be the case or not. For example, it may be desirable to settle a disagreement as to an existing state of affairs in order to establish a clear basis for the contract itself and its subsequent performance. Where parties express an agreement of that kind in a contractual document neither can subsequently deny the existence of the facts and matters upon which they have agreed, at least so far as concerns those aspects of their relationship to which the agreement was directed. The contract itself gives rise to an estoppel ...&lt;ref&gt;''Peekay Intermark Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd'', at paragraph 56.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Deed ===
{{Main|Estoppel by deed}}

''Estoppel by deed'' is a rule of evidence arising from the status of a [[deed|contract signed under seal]]—such agreements, called deeds, are more strictly enforced than ordinary contracts and the parties are expected to take greater care to verify the contents before signing them. Hence, once signed, all statements of fact (usually found in the opening recital which sets out the reason(s) for making the deed) are conclusive evidence against the parties who are estopped from asserting otherwise.

=== Conflict estoppel ===
"[O]ne who by his speech or conduct has induced another to act in a particular manner ought not be permitted to adopt an inconsistent position, attitude or course of conduct may not be adopted to loss or injury of another".&lt;ref&gt;''Brand v. Farmer's Mut. Protective Assoc of Texas'', Tex. App 95 S.W.2d 994, 997&lt;/ref&gt; For example, as between two or more claimants, a party that takes multiple and inconsistent legal positions is estopped to assert its positions against another consistent and certain claim, i.e. preferential treatment for certain over uncertain claims.

===Issue estoppel===&lt;!--"issue estoppel" redirects here--&gt;
{{See also|Res judicata}}
Issue estoppel (more commonly known as issue preclusion) prevents, in some cases, an issue that has already been litigated and decided on the merits from being re-litigated, even when the parties are different.  In the world of crime, some cases have achieved notoriety, e.g. in the [[Birmingham Six]] saga, the [[Judicial Committee of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] ruled in ''Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police (1982)'' that ''issue estoppel'' applied. [[Kenneth Diplock, Baron Diplock|Lord Diplock]] said:

{{quote|[This case] concerns the inherent power which any court of justice must possess to prevent misuse of its procedure in a way which, although not inconsistent with the literal application of its procedural rules, would nevertheless be manifestly unfair to a party to litigation before it, or would otherwise bring the administration of justice into disrepute among right-thinking people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldjudgmt/jd050210/polan-3.htm Judgments - Polanski (Appellant) v Conde Nast Publications Limited (Respondents)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708134446/https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldjudgmt/jd050210/polan-3.htm |date=2017-07-08 }} UK Parliament publications &gt; Business &gt; Lords Publications &gt; Judgment Index &gt; Judgment. Paragraph 86&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A variant of issue estoppel also precludes a party from bringing a claim in subsequent proceedings which ought properly to have been brought as part of earlier legal proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Henderson v Henderson]]'' (1843) 3 Hare 100, 67 ER 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other countries==

=== Australia ===
The doctrine of promissory estoppel was adopted into [[Australia]]n law in ''[[Legione v Hateley]]''. However, the plaintiffs were unsuccessful in that case because the reliance was unreasonable and the promise not unequivocal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|11|1983|litigants=[[Legione v Hateley]] |parallelcite=(1983) 152 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 406 at p 440  |date=14 April 1983 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian law has now gone beyond the position espoused in the English ''High Trees'' case,&lt;ref name="High Trees"/&gt; to cases where there is no pre-existing legal relationship between the two parties, and promissory estoppel can be wielded as a "sword", not just as a "shield". Mason CJ and Wilson J in ''[[Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher]]''&lt;ref name="Waltons HCA"/&gt; held that if estoppel is proven, it gives rise to an equity in favour of the plaintiff, and the court will do the minimum equity that is just in the circumstances. From this case, it is also possible for the promise to come from silence or inaction.

Stated by Brennan J in ''Waltons Stores'': {{quote|To establish an equitable estoppel, it is necessary for the plaintiff to prove that 1) the plaintiff assumed that a particular legal relationship would exist between them (and in the latter case) that the defendant would not be free to withdraw from that expected legal relationship; 2) the defendant has induced the plaintiff to adopt that assumption or expectation; 3) the plaintiff acts or abstains from acting in reliance on the assumption or expectation; 4) the defendant knew or intended him to do so; 5) the plaintiff's action or inaction will occasion detriment if the assumption of expectation is not fulfilled; and 6) the defendant has failed to act to avoid that detriment whether by fulfilling the assumption or expectation of otherwise.&lt;ref name="Waltons HCA"/&gt;}}

Although there is some debate as to whether "unconscionability" is an element that English courts need to take into account when considering estoppel by representation of fact, the Australian courts clearly do.&lt;ref name=wilkenvilliers/&gt;{{rp|para. 9-03}}&lt;ref name="Cth v Verwayen"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|39|1990|litigants=[[Commonwealth v Verwayen]] |parallelcite=(1990) 170 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 394 at p 444 per Deane J |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This element is satisfied if one party encourages the other party to create assumptions that lead to reliance.&lt;ref name="Thompson v Palmer"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|61|1933|litigants=Thompson v Palmer |parallecite=(1933) 49 [[COmmonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 507 |date=14 December 1933 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the principle of estoppel may give birth to an enforceable obligation even without a consideration under the following conditions:
# promise&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|43|1996|litigants=W v G |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# dishonest behaviour of the promisor
# special relationship between the promisor and the promisee,&lt;ref name="Con-stan Industries v Norwich"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|14|1986|litigants=[[Con-stan Industries of Australia Pty Ltd v Norwich Winterthur Insurance (Australia) Ltd]] |parallelcite=(1986) 160 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 226 |courtname=auto |date=11 April 1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., duty of information);
# irreversible change of position on the part of the promisee

When enforcing an estoppel, Australian courts will look to the impact that enforcement will have on others, especially third parties. Relief in estoppel thus remains discretionary, and will not always be granted based on the expectation of the plaintiff.&lt;ref name="Giumelli v Giumelli"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|10|1999|litigants=Giumelli v Giumelli |parallecite=(1999) 196 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 101}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCA|84|2010|litigants=Delaforce v Simpson-Cook |date=20 July 2010 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The status of estoppel by representation of fact is less clear in Australia. Two seminal decisions purport to fuse common law and equitable estoppels into a single unified doctrine,&lt;ref name="Waltons HCA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cth v Verwayen"/&gt; but the New South Wales Court of Appeal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCA|158|2002|litigants=Byron Shire Council v Vaughan |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; continues to treat estoppel by representation at common law as distinct from equitable estoppel.&lt;ref&gt;Meagher, Gummow &amp; Lehane, ''Equity: Doctrines &amp; Remedies'', 4th edition, Butterworth: 2002, Chapter 17; and Parkinson, ''The Principles of Equity'', 2nd edition, LBC: 2003, Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  This can be significant in deciding which court has jurisdiction to adjudicate on the issue.

Whilst there also exists a doctrine of proprietary estoppel, the High Court of Australia merged this doctrine with the doctrine of promissory estoppel by virtue of their similar criteria.&lt;ref name="Waltons HCA"/&gt;

Nonetheless, authority for the doctrine of proprietary estoppel indicates that if a landlord allows a licensee to expend money on the land under an expectation created or encouraged by the landlord that he/she will be able to remain there, and the licensee suffers a detriment in relying on that expectation, an equity arises in the licensee such as to entitle him/her to stay.&lt;ref&gt;for expectation interest/assumption, see also {{cite AustLII|FCA|205|1998|litigants=Mobil Oil Australia Ltd v Wellcome International Pty Ltd |date=13 March 1998 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Inwards v Baker'' (1965) 2 [[Queens Bench Law Reports|QB]] 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Where a proprietary estoppel is found to exist, the court does not have to grant the plaintiff a proprietary interest in the land subject to the dispute. It may instead make an order that the plaintiff receive equitable compensation.&lt;ref name="Giumelli v Giumelli"/&gt;

=== India ===
Section 115 of the [[Indian Evidence Act]] defines estoppel: "When one person has, by his declaration, act or omission, intentionally caused or permitted another person to believe a thing to be true and to act upon such belief, neither he nor his representative shall be allowed, in any suit or proceeding between himself and such person or his representative, to deny the truth of that thing."

So, for instance, if A intentionally and falsely leads B to believe that certain land belongs to A, and thereby induces B to buy and pay for it, and only later does A acquire the land, then A is not allowed to argue to void the sale on the ground that, at the time of the sale, he had no title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiankanoon.org/doc/565781/|title=Section 115 in The Indian Evidence Act, 1872|author=|date=|website=indiankanoon.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813041454/http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/565781/|archivedate=2012-08-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine of estoppel is based on the principle that consistency in word and action imparts certainty and honesty to human affairs. If a person makes a representation to another, on the faith of which the latter acts, to his prejudice, the former cannot recant the representation.

However, estoppel has no application to representations made regarding the fundamental rights conferred by the [[Constitution of India]], the source of all laws, which exists not only to benefit individuals but to secure collective rights. Thus, no one can barter away the freedoms conferred upon him by the Constitution. A concession made by him in a proceeding, whether under a [[mistake of law]] or otherwise, that he does not possess or will not enforce any particular fundamental right, cannot estop him, as enforcing estoppel would defeat the purpose of the Constitution.&lt;ref name=Olga/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9452">'''General Secretary''' or '''First Secretary''' is the official title of leaders of most [[Communist party|Communist political parties]]. When a Communist party is the ruling party in a Communist-led [[one-party state]], the General Secretary is typically the country's ''[[de facto]]'' leader—though sometimes this leader also holds state-level positions (such as a [[president|presidency]] or [[premier]]ship) in order to hold ''[[de jure]]'' leadership of the state as well. One exception to this rule is the [[People's Republic of China]] from 1978 to 1990 where the Chairman and then General Secretary of the Communist Party were subordinate to [[Deng Xiaoping]] who was the ''de facto'' [[paramount leader]] of China.

[[File:Porslins-tallrik med Grillska vapnet.jpg|thumb|275px|Chinese porcelain dish with the Grill coat of arms, imported to Sweden by the SOIC.]]

The '''Grill family''' was one of several Swedish families having significant influence with the [[Swedish East India Company]] (SOIC). During the 17th century, 18th century and for some years into the 19th century, they owned [[ironworks]] and mills manufacturing goods for export while operating wharfs, textile companies, saw mills and other factories related to shipbuilding. Several Grills were directors of the SOIC and the Grill firm traded with the merchants in Canton (now known as [[Guangzhou]]) as members of the SOIC and privately. The Grills owned houses, manors and estates at a number of locations in Sweden.

All the noted Grills were in some way connected to the main Grill Trading House, and several other companies were established in association with the Trading House. The Grill name was kept and passed on through the generations and some of the Grills even shared the same first name.

Apart from the SOIC, the Grills are most noted for their contribution to the Swedish [[Ferrous metallurgy|iron industry]] and for exports of iron during the 18th century.

Only ships in the Swedish Navy were entitled to fly a (triple-)tailed flag. The SOIC ships used the two-tailed version, that looked like a navy flag, to discourage pirates at sea. Despite the prohibition, Claes Grill (I) ordered several flags in Canton.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=174–176}} He even used them at his summer residence, Svindersvik, on land and on the rowboat taking him to and from the house. One of these flags remained at Svindersvik and is one of the oldest, preserved flags in Sweden. {{As of|2014}} it is kept at the ''[[Livrustkammaren]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Söderberg|first=Bengt G.|date=1968|title=Slott och herresäten i Sverige.

Originating in [[Genoa]], Italy,&lt;ref name=Grilliana /&gt; part of the family moved to [[Augsburg]], Germany where on 29{{nbsp}}July 1571, Andreas Grill received [[burgher arms]] with their own [[coat of arms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=En praktfull ostindisk servis med det grillska vapnet|trans-title=A splendid East India tableware with the Grill coat of arms|url=http://www.digitaltmuseum.se/things/en-praktfull-ostindisk-servis-med-det/S-NM/NMA.0029080|website=www.digitaltmuseum.se|publisher=Digitalt Museum—[[Nordic Museum]]|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grilliana – En sida om släkten Grill|trans-title=Grillology – A page about the Grill family|url=http://grilliana.wordpress.com/historia/vapenbrevet/|website=www.grilliana.wordpress.com|publisher=The Grill family|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

The name Grill comes from the Italian ''Grillo'', meaning cricket, while the family's coat of arms displays a crane holding a cricket in its beak.{{efn|Shield:Or, standing on a triple mount sable, a crane holding a cricket on its beak proper.&lt;ref name=Familj325&gt;{{cite journal |title=Ett fosterländskt Bildergalleri. |trans-title=A patriotic picture gallery. |last=Schöldström |first=Birger |journal=Svenska Familj-Journalen |year=1879 |publisher=Svenska Familj-Journalen via Project Runeberg | url=http://runeberg.org/famijour/1879/0329.html |volume=18 |pages=325–327 |language=Swedish |location=Stockholm }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The family came to Sweden with the arrival of the silversmith Anthoni Grill (I), grandson of Andreas Grill, born in Augsburg and from 1638, a [[Burgess (title)|burgess]] in [[Amsterdam]]. He was the ''Riksguardie'' (National Appraiser) for the [[Myntverket]] in 1658 to 1667, where he supervised the making of coins and made sure that [[measurement]]s were standardized throughout Sweden. He was not especially good at his work and in 1663, he was demoted to handle smaller goods in gold and silver. He was succeeded at the Myntverket by his son Anthoni Grill (II), who also bought the Grill house at [[Stortorget]] in Stockholm.&lt;ref name=biografiskt&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title =Grill, släkt |trans-title=Grill, family| encyclopedia =[[Svenskt biografiskt lexikon]] | year =1967–1969 |publisher =[[National Archives of Sweden]] |location =Stockholm |language=Swedish |volume=17 |page=276 |url =http://sok.riksarkivet.se/sbl/artikel/13191 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 18th century the family was described as members of the ''Skeppsbroadeln'' (the Skeppsbro Nobility).&lt;ref name=Goteborg /&gt; The name was coined during the 18th century and referred to the wealthiest merchant families in Stockholm at that time, especially those who lived by the quays along the [[Skeppsbron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skeppsbroadeln|trans-title=Skeppsbro nobility|url=http://www.ne.se/skeppsbroadeln|website=www.ne.se|publisher=''[[Nationalencyklopedin]]''|language=Swedish|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family consisted of two branches —the [[Garphyttan]] branch and the [[Godegård]] branch. The Grill family is included in the ''[[Ointroducerad Adels Förening]]'' (Association of the Unintroduced Nobility), an association for Swedish citizens whose family was ennobled in a foreign country, as well as some families who were ennobled in Sweden but for some reason never introduced at the Swedish House of Nobility.&lt;ref name=Leos&gt;{{cite book|last1=Müller|first1=Leos|title=The merchant houses of Stockholm, c. 1640–1800: a comparative study of early-modern entrepreneurial behaviour|date=1998|publisher=Acta Universitatis Upsaliensis|location=Uppsala|isbn=91-554-4233-1|series=Studia historica Upsaliensia, 0081-6531 ; 188Studia historica Upsaliensia, 0081-6531 ; 188|id={{LIBRIS|8359550}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abraham Grill (I) &lt;small&gt;the Elder&lt;/small&gt; ==

[[File:1674-1725-abraham-grill-da.jpg|thumb|Abraham Grill (I) &lt;small&gt;the Elder&lt;/small&gt;.]]
'''Abraham Grill''' (1674{{snd}}20 March 1725) was a Swedish merchant. Married three times, he had seven children&lt;ref name=Grilliana /&gt; and was the son of Anthoni (II) as well as heir to the Grill family fortune, which he increased through trade speculation. During the [[Great Northern War]] led by King [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]], he gave large sums of money to the state and during a time of famine he sold grains at reduced price to the needy. He was also the driving force behind the founding of a house for poor elderly widows in Stockholm on 14{{nbsp}}July 1724.&lt;ref name=Nordisk&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title =Grill | encyclopedia =[[Nordisk familjebok]]–Uggleupplagan |editor1=Meijer Bernhard |editor2=Westrin Theodor |editor3=Berg Ruben G:son |editor4=Söderberg Verner |editor5=Fahlstedt Eugène | year =1909 | publisher =Nordisk familjeboks förl. | url=http://runeberg.org/nfbj/0178.html | pp=303–304 | location =Stockholm | language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1716, he and his brother Carlos Grill, founded the Grill [[Joint-stock company|Trading House]]. The house traded mainly in [[wrought iron]] and became one of the leading trading houses in Stockholm during the 18th century.&lt;ref name=tradinghouse&gt;{{cite web|title=Handelshuset Carlos &amp; Claes Grill (1716–1799)|trans-title=The Carlos &amp; Claes Grill Trading House (1716–1799)|url=http://sok.riksarkivet.se/?Sokord=Abraham+Grill&amp;FacettFilter=arkis_aukt_huvudkategori_facet%24F%C3%B6retag%3A&amp;page=1&amp;postid=Arkis+2BD0C626-62E9-471D-8C01-967559000D04&amp;s=TARKIS08_Siv|website=www.riksarkivet.se/|publisher=[[National Archives of Sweden]]|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its first year the company bought [[Land reclamation|reclaimed land]], from the Countess Elisabeth Oxenstierna, in the east part of Stockholm. The land was used to establish the Terra Nova Wharf,{{efn|''Terra Nova'' is Latin for "new land" and refers to the reclaimed land it was built upon.{{sfn|Zethelius|1956|p=59}}}} also known as the ''Köpmannavarvet'' (the Merchants Wharf),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strandvägshamnen|trans-title=Port at Strandvägen|url=http://www.stockholmshamnar.se/Historia/Platser/Stockholm/Strandvagshamnen/|website=www.stockholmshamnar.se|publisher=Stockholms Hamn|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a number of the ships for the SOIC were built.{{sfn|Zethelius|1956|p=59}}

When Abraham died in 1725, his share of the Trading House went to his son Claes (I). At the death of Carlos in 1736, Claes (I) was sole owner of the company until his half-brother Johan Abraham joined him as partner. Johan Abraham continued to run the Trading House after Claes (I)'s death in 1767. In 1799, Johan Abraham died and the company went bankrupt.&lt;ref name=tradinghouse /&gt;

== Abraham Grill (II) &lt;small&gt;the Younger&lt;/small&gt; ==

'''Abraham Grill''' (28 January 1707{{snd}}28 January 1768) was the brother of Anthoni (III) and Claes (I), and half-brother to Johan Abraham.&lt;ref name=Grilliana /&gt; He started his career as Swedish [[Consul (representative)|consul]] in [[Helsingør]] in 1733 to 1736.&lt;ref name=biografiskt /&gt; During his time in Denmark he met Anna Maria Petersen, and they were married in 1735. They had thirteen children of which five died at an early age.&lt;ref name=Grilliana /&gt;

Abraham and his family moved to Gothenburg in 1746, where he established a trading house. That year, he was also one of the directors for the SOIC during the second charter.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=165}} He cooperated closely with the two other trading houses in the Grill family at that time: Carlos &amp; Claes Grill in Stockholm and Anthony &amp; Johannes Grill in Amsterdam. Abraham's trading house handled most of the copper exported from Gothenburg during a few years in the 1760s. The company also exported iron and tea, brought to Gothenburg by the SOIC.&lt;ref name=Goteborg&gt;{{cite web|last=Svensson|first=Anders|title=Abraham Grill|url=http://gamlagoteborg.se/2014/05/18/abraham-grill/|website=gamlagoteborg.se|publisher=Det Gamla Göteborg|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Abraham's many children, Lorentz Grill, became his partner in the trading house in 1761. At the death of Abraham (on his birthday) in 1768, Lorentz sought out new partners and continued running the company.&lt;ref name=Goteborg /&gt;

== Johan Abraham Grill ==

[[File:Paret Grill.jpg|thumb|320px|Johan Abraham Grill and Christina Elisabeth Grill]]
'''Johan Abraham Grill''' (1719{{snd}}16 March 1799) was a Swedish merchant and politician. He was the son of Abraham (I), &lt;small&gt;the Elder&lt;/small&gt;, and Katarina Rozelius, half-brother to Claes (I) and uncle to Jean Abraham.&lt;ref name=Nordisk /&gt; He married Christina Elisabeth Fischer (1731–1805). It was Johan Abraham who introduced a motto for the Grill family: ''Ärlighet warar längst'' (Honesty is the best policy.).&lt;ref name=Grilliana /&gt;

In 1747, Johan Abraham became partner in the Grill Trading House. Throughout his career he held a number of official positions and received several awards.

'''Claes Grill''' (19 April 1705{{snd}}6 November 1767) was a Swedish merchant and factory owner. Claes was the son of Abraham (I) Grill and Helena Wittmark and twin brother to Anthoni Grill. Claes married his uncle's daughter, Anna Johanna (I) Grill (1720–1778), a woman famed for her beauty.

=== Early years ===
Claes started to work for his father and at the age of 17 when he was employed at Abrahams office in the Grill Trading House. After the death of Abraham (I), Claes became director of the Trading House, and ran the company together with his uncle Carlos. The name of the company was changed to ''Carlos &amp; Claes Grill'', at that time one of the largest trading company in Sweden. After the death of Carlos in 1736, he was sole head of the firm until 1747, when his half-brother joined him as partner.&lt;ref name=SBHClaes&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Grill, Klas |editor-first=Herman |editor-last=Hofberg |encyclopedia=[[Svenskt biografiskt handlexikon]] |year=1906 |publisher=Svenskt biografiskt handlexikon via [[Project Runeberg]] | url=http://runeberg.org/sbh/a0402.html |volume=1 |pages=402–403 |language=Swedish |location=Stockholm |accessdate=20 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the family had connections to the [[Netherlands]], Claes went there in 1731 or 1732, to further his education and gain more experience with the trading business.&lt;ref name=Claes&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Hildebrand |first1=Bengt|last2=Högberg|first2=Staffan|title =Claes Grill| encyclopedia =[[Svenskt biografiskt lexikon]] | year =1967–1969

=== The Grill Trading House ===
During the mid 18th century, the Grill Trading House flourished both in Sweden and abroad. They were connected to hundreds of trading houses in Europe. Foremost was the export of goods to [[Hamburg]], Amsterdam and England. The Dutch Grill company, Antoni Grill &amp; Sons based in Amsterdam acted as a centre for payments to the Grill trading house in Stockholm. The Anglo-Swedish company run by Andrew &amp; Charles Lindegren in London handled all the exports, shipping documents, vessel clearances, and insurance for the Grill Trading House. They also supplied Swedish ships with transit cargoes from England to the countries around the [[Mediterranean Sea]].&lt;ref name=Claes /&gt;

During the second charter of the SOIC between 1746 and 1766, the Grill Trading House was one of the leading companies in the East India trade. They were partners in a large linen and rigging factory as well as a glass factory in Stockholm. They leased the Stora Stads wharf in Stockholm, owned the Terra Nova wharf and had interests in the Djurgården wharf. All three wharfs built ships for both the SOIC and foreign customers.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=131}}

The Grill Trading House also ran a banking business for Swedes traveling abroad. Since the company was connected to so many other trading houses, they could issue [[Negotiable instrument|bills of exchange]] for travelers and diplomats to be redeemed at trading houses in other countries. Under the direction of Claes, the trading house acquired several factories and ironworks: Söderfors 1748, Österbybruk with the [[Dannemora mine]] (1750) and [[Iggesund, Hudiksvall|Iggesund]] (1753). The main exports from these factories were iron, copper, [[lumber]] and [[tar]]. Imports consisted of salt from [[Portugal]], oak and [[hemp]] from the [[Baltic states]], also wine, coffee, sugar, cheese, tobacco and textiles.&lt;ref name=Leos /&gt; Claes ran his companies in an old-fashioned, patriarchal way writing letters every week to his managers at the estates concerning everything from the running of the factories to making enquiries about individual employees. Overall, the Grills industrial companies employed more than 4,000 persons at that time.&lt;ref name=Claes /&gt;

=== Houses and estates ===

[[File:Svindersvik 2009h.jpg|thumb|Svindersvik, interior]]
With the building of the manor in Österbybruk, it became the hub for all the iron and mining activities of the Grill Trading House, although Claes and his family did not live there permanently. They lived in the Grill house in Stockholm until 1764, when he bought the Torstensonska Palace (now known as the [[Arvfurstens palats]]) at [[Gustav Adolfs torg, Stockholm]]. The summers were spent at [[Svindersvik]], a country residence outside Stockholm, built by Claes in the early 1740s.&lt;ref name=Claes /&gt;

Claes was an art collector and his houses were decorated with [[Chinese art|Chinese]] objects as well as paintings by Swedish and Dutch masters like [[Alexander Roslin]], [[Gustaf Lundberg]], [[Hans Memling]] and [[David Teniers the Younger|David Teniers]]. He owned six complete sets of [[porcelain]] tableware commissioned from Canton. {{As of|2014}}, the oldest and largest of these still has 325 pieces preserved.&lt;ref name=Claes /&gt; Imported porcelain broken in transit from [[Qing dynasty|China]] or by daily household use became decorative gravel used on the garden paths at one of the Grills' estates. This example of wasting money and resources was condemned by those who opposed the activities of the SOIC. Even noted botanist [[Carl Linnaeus]] was at first an opponent. He wrote: "A part of the silver, which withstands the wear and tear of time and which even fire cannot destroy, we exchange for fragile objects of clay, which, once dropped, cannot be mended."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roth|first1=Stig|title=Chinese porcelain: imported by the Swedish East India Company|date=1965|publisher=Historiska Museet|location=Göteborg|page=24|id={{LIBRIS|1520976}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefactor ===

Claes was interested in [[natural science]] and contributed to different projects, such as helping Carl Linnaeus financially and with the collection of plants and animal specimens from foreign lands. In 1740, he became a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. He gave financial support to young scientists and naturalists, lent money (without interest) to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for the construction of an observatory, contributed a substantial sum of money to the [[Danviken Hospital]] and saved the [[Sveriges Riksbank]] (the [[central bank]] of Sweden) from bankruptcy in 1747 by buying banknotes at their nominal value. In 1748, he became ''[[Praeses|preses]]'' or president of the Royal Academy of Sciences and was elected to the board of directors at the central bank of Sweden, a position he held until 1756.{{efn|In his speech at the Academy on 4{{nbsp}}February 1749, Claes (I) spoke on the use of shipping. In his speech he summed up the ships owned by shipping companies in Stockholm in 1749: "Ships made of oak: 62 ships up to and including 100 ''lästs'', 16 ships up to 200 ''lästs'', 4 ships up to 300 ''lästs''. Ships made of pine: 63 ships up to and including 100 ''lästs'', 31 ships up to 200 ''lästs'', 13 ships up to 300 ''lästs'' and 3 over 300 ''lästs''." {{sfn|Zethelius|1956|p=96}}}} Claes was also awarded the honorary title of ''kommerseråd'' ("trade counselor") by [[Adolf Frederick, King of Sweden|King Adolf Frederick]]. In 1755, he was one of the initiating founders of the Factory Academy, a social network for factory owners in central Sweden.&lt;ref name=SBHClaes /&gt;

=== Political life and fall ===
Between 1748 and 1750, Claes was a member of the [[Bourgeoisie]] in the [[Riksdag of the Estates]] and politically involved with the [[Hats (party)|Hats]]. He was also one of the partners in the infamous ''Växelkontoret'' (Exchange office), a private financial institution handling mainly [[promissory note]]s without the involvement of the central bank. When the [[Caps (party)|Caps]] became the ruling party in 1765, Claes, along with his half-brother Johan Abraham and all the other members of the ''Växelkontoret'', were accused of corruption and mishandling its affairs. In 1765, Claes and Johan Abraham, were fined by the Justice deputation of the Riksdag, and in 1766, they were sentenced to pay back "five barrels of gold" to the ''Växelkontoret''. When the Hats regained their political power in the Riksdag the following year, the sentence was revoked, but by then Claes had died.&lt;ref name=SBHClaes /&gt;

The products from the ironworks were of good quality and production peaked in 1780.&lt;ref name=Soder /&gt;

=== Collector ===
[[File:Uppstoppad häst. Hertig Fredrik Adolf - Livrustkammaren - 86954.tif|thumb|upright|Mounted horse from the Grill collection at Söderfors, now in the ''[[Livrustkammaren]]'']]
Like his father, he was a [[Natural science|natural scientist]] and he collected [[Taxidermy|mounted animals]], fossils, [[mineral]]s and plants in a museum, started in 1783, at the Söderfors manor. The first specimens were collected in the vicinity of Söderfors. After two years Adolf Ulric moved on to the birds of the archipelago. He was able to use his connections through his relatives in the trading houses, to send for specimens from [[Greenland]] and [[Qing dynasty|China]]. The collections were also increased during his travels and on a journey to England in 1788, he traded a mounted [[moose]] for 60 rare birds.&lt;ref name=Ulric /&gt;

Claes and his wife Anna Johanna (I), would live in Stockholm during the winter and spend the summers at Svindersvik. The residence was usually accessed by rowboat. The style of the residence is rococo, with many Chinese elements brought to Sweden by the SOIC. At the death of Claes (I), the estate was passed on to his daughter Anna Johanna (II). The house was sold in 1780, and passed through several owners, until it was bought by silk manufacturer K.A. Almgren in 1863. {{As of|1949}}, the house is owned by the Nordic Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A rococo style country residence|url=http://www.nordiskamuseet.se/node/2313|website=www.nordiskamuseet.se|publisher=[[Nordic Museum]]|accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grill's estate in Söderfors largely made up the entire town at that time along with the ironworks and the manor. The ironworks were founded in 1676 to make anchors.

The first manor was finished in 1700 then between 1749 and 1756 it was rebuilt by architect Carl Hårleman for Claes Grill (I). After his death, the manor passed to his son Adolf Ulric. He was an avid [[Natural history|naturalist]] and during his redidence he filled it with art and specimens of mounted animals, minerals, fossils and plants.&lt;ref name=Soder /&gt; Adolph Ulric had a separate house built for his collection in 1786.

The ironworks at Österbybruk were established by King [[Gustav I of Sweden]] with the help of German experts during the 16th century and specialised in making munitions. During the 17th century the factories were merged with Lövsta and Gimo, under the directions of [[Louis De Geer (1587–1652)|Louis De Geer]], making it the second largest ironworks in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dahlgren|first1=Erik Wilhelm|title=De uppländska bruken Österby, Forsmark, Leufsta och Gimo under äldsta tider|trans-title=The Upplandic ironworks Österby, Forsmark, Leufsta and Gimo during the elder days|date=1928|location=Stockholm|id={{LIBRIS|1488887}}|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since De Geer recruited skilled iron workers from the [[Wallonia|Walloon Region]] of Belgium, these ironworks became known as the Walloon factories ("Wallonbruken").&lt;ref name=Vallon /&gt; The iron ore processed in Österby came from the Dannemora mine and was noted for its purity.

In 1763, Claes (I) started construction of the mansion at Österbybruk. The mansion incorporated the two wings already built in the 1730s; the west wing which served as housing for one of the ironworks caretakers and the east wing containing a chapel. The mansion was not completed until 1780, due to the decline of the East India trade, accusations of financial misconduct against Claes and Johan Abraham and the [[Amsterdam Banking Crisis of 1763|banking crises in Amsterdam in 1763]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hildebrand|first=Bengt|title=Claes Grill |encyclopedia=[[Svenskt biografiskt lexikon]] |year=1967–1969|volume=17|page=281|publisher=[[National Archives of Sweden]] |location=Stockholm |url=http://sok.riksarkivet.se/SBL/Presentation.aspx?id=13196|language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2014}}, the manor is owned by the [[Bruno Liljefors]] Foundation.

The Grill's estates at the village of Godegård, the manor and the ironworks, dominated the community during the 18th century. Mining had been done in the area as early as in the [[Middle Ages]], and by the early 17th century, an ironworks was already established at Godegård. The ironworks was bought by Louis De Geer in 1618.

Settling down in Sweden after his profitable journeys to China, [[Jean Abraham Grill|Jean Abraham]] was looking for something to invest in. He started negotiations for the purchase of land, manor and factory at Godegård, at that time the largest ironworks in [[Östergötland]], and bought them all in 1775.&lt;ref name=Jean /&gt; Jean Abraham continued the expansion of the ironworks and made significant restoration of the manor.

== Garphyttan ==
[[File:Garphytte bruk.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Administration building at Garphyttan.]]
The mining at Garphyttan was started during the Middle Ages by German miners.

It was not until the factory was bought by three Dutch merchants in 1661, that the company started to flourish again. A trip hammer, two hearths, a smithy, a saw mill, a silver refinery and housing for the workers were added. The factories and the ironworks went through several owners until 1773, when Abraham (III) acquired them all. The previous owner had borrowed money from the Anthony Grill &amp; Sons Trading House in Amsterdam, and when he failed to repay the loan, the factories became the property of the Grills. The building of a manor at Garphyttan started during the 17th century, and several additions were made in the middle of the 18th century. The main building of the manor was destroyed during a fire in 1830, only the four wings remain.&lt;ref name=Garp&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nachmanson|first1=August|last2=Hannerberg|first2=David|title=Garphyttan: ett gammalt bruks historia|trans-title=Garphyttan: the history of an old orinworks|date=1945|publisher=Bonnier|location=Stockholm|id={{LIBRIS|26310}}|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stora Nyckelviken manor was completed in 1746 by Herman Petersen, a wealthy merchant and director of the SOIC. The manor was designed in much the same style as the other manors built with the profits from the East India trade. It consists of a main building, wings, gazebos and a park. The manor was only owned by the Grill family for a short period of time. Jean Abraham Grill bought it in 1760, and sold it 20 years later.&lt;ref name=Grill-houses /&gt; {{As of|2014}} the manor is owned by the municipality of Nacka.

[[File:Ortala bruk.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Coal storage at the Ortala ironworks]]
The first ironworks in Skebo was built in the 15th century. The iron ore was mined locally in the forests surrounding the factory. The first smithy with a trip hammer at Skebo, was constructed by Hindrich Lemmens in 1626. The iron from the ironworks was mainly sold to the Norrtälje rifle factory, which made weapons used in the [[Thirty Years' War]]. During the 18th century the Skebo and Ortala (a similar mine and factory nearby) ironworks were operated jointly. They went through several owners, due to the economical entanglements and financial difficulties of the directors and investors. One of these affairs resulted in Jacob Grill obtaining Skebo and Ortala, along with three other factories in 1769, from the previous owner who could not pay his debt to Jacob.&lt;ref name=Grill-houses /&gt; Jacob had no experience in operating an ironworks, he got into financial difficulties and had to sell the factories in 1782. The ironworks flourished during the 19th century, and began to decline after 1900, ending in bankruptcy in 1924.&lt;ref name=Skebo&gt;{{cite web|title=Ett av Upplands äldsta järnbruk|trans-title=One of the oldest ironworks in Uppland|url=http://www.skebobruksmuseum.se/html/skebo_bruks_historia.html|website=www.skebobruksmuseum.se|publisher=Skebobruks Museum|accessdate=28 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131127031212/http://skebobruksmuseum.se/html/skebo_bruks_historia.html|archivedate=27 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time at Skebo, Jacob built a manor in 1767–1770. During the 19th century the new owners filled it with art and sculptures and it became a center for the local socialite. When the ironworks folded the manor became a retirement home for elderly gentlemen, a spa, a house for seminars and workshops, and in 2010, a noted restaurant listed in the White Guide 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detta har hänt|trans-title=The story so far|url=http://skeboherrgard.se/om_oss/historik|website=skeboherrgard.se|publisher=Skebo Herrgård|accessdate=28 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230234227/http://skeboherrgard.se/om_oss/historik|archivedate=30 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2013}}, the restaurant is closed and the manor is a temporary lodging for refugees seeking asylum in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andersson|first1=Ki|title=Skebo herrgård tillfällig bostad för flyktingar|trans-title=Skebo manor temporary home for refugees|url=http://norrteljetidning.se/nyheter/nyheter/1.2260799-skebo-herrgard-tillfallig-bostad-for-flyktingar|website=norrteljetidning.se|publisher=Norrtelje Tidning|accessdate=28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Lövåsen lead and silver factory ==
[[File:Sockensten Stora Skedvi 50-1.jpg|thumb|120px|Marker at Stora Skedvi]]

The Lövåsen lead and silver factory in Stora Skedvi was one of the first factories to be connected with the Grill family. The Swedish government handed over the administration of the factory to Anthoni Grill (I) in 1656, to be used as a laboratory and workshop by him. He had claimed that he was in possession of a secret "matter" that would enable him to extract much more copper, lead, silver and gold from the ore than by other conventional methods. He experimented fore some years at the laboratory, but he never improved the extraction process, and was consequently demoted from his position at the mine. {{As of|2014}}, there are no visible remains of the mine or the factory.&lt;ref name=biografiskt /&gt;

== Ersta ==
[[File:Ersta 2009e.jpg|thumb|120px|left|The Ersta manor]]
Ersta is one of the many ''malmgårdarna'' (suburban manors) built in Stockholm during the 17th and 18th century. At these manors, wealthy, noble families from different parts of Sweden, could enjoy the same comforts as in their homes in the country. The manors were built in the suburbs, close to what constituted Stockholm in the 17th century and 18th century. The city has grown considerably since then, and these locations are now considered to be part of central Stockholm. Many of the buildings, the entire manor or part of them, are still in use and embedded in the modern cityscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lindberg|first1=Birgit|title=Malmgårdarna i Stockholm|trans-title=The suburban manors of Stockholm|date=1985|publisher=LiberFörlag|location=Stockholm|isbn=91-38-90418-7|page=16|id={{LIBRIS|7268833}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ersta, on the high cliffs of southern Stockholm, was probably built in the 1670s by [[brännvin]] manufacturer Oluf Håkansson. At that time the land in that area was cheap since it was close to the old gallows. When the gallows was moved further away from town to make way for a new shipyard, the Stora Stads wharf, where ships for the SOIC were built, the area around Ersta became sought after and was called "a garden". The mansion passed through several owners until Jean Abraham Grill bought it in 1755. In 1770, he established a [[crucible steel]] factory at Ersta with the help of [[Bengt Andersson Qvist]], a member of the [[Swedish Board of Mines]]. Members of the Qvist family were inspectors at the Iggesund ironworks.&lt;ref name=Grill-houses /&gt; The steel was of good quality, but nevertheless unprofitable. In 1775, Jean Abraham sold the manor and the steel factory to Qvist who ran the company until it folded with his death in 1799.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lindberg|first1=Birgit|title=Malmgårdarna i Stockholm|trans-title=Suburban manors of Stockholm|date=1985|publisher=LiberFörlag|location=Stockholm|isbn=91-38-90418-7|pages=45–48|id={{LIBRIS|7268833}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2014}}, only two of the buildings at the manor remain.

'''Heikki Hugo Herlin''' (7 February 1901 — 21 August 1989) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[engineer]], [[industrialist]] and [[vuorineuvos]].

Herlin gained experience by studying and working abroad, before he inherited his father's position as manager of the [[Elevator|lift]] producer [[Kone|Kone Oy]] in 1932. He developed the company substantially and started [[export]]s already in the 1930s. After Kone had participated at delivering large number of units to [[Soviet Union]] as part of the [[Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union|Finnish war reparations]], Herlin established fruitful business relations with the Soviet Union. Herlin had broad language skills which he utilised when he developed Kone an international company. In 1964 he gave the leadership to his son [[Pekka Herlin]], continuing still as a board member.

Herlin was member of many company boards as wells as non-profit associations. He founded the Kone Foundation which supports cultural and sociological research.

== Early years ==
Herlin's parents were engineer [[Harald Herlin]] and Minna [[née]] Westerlund. Harald Herlin was a [[Water pipe|water piping]] specialist and he managed [[plumbing]] company ''Oy Vesijohtoliike Ab'' until 1920. He also worked as [[consultant]], and at the early 1920s he was assigned to [[Reorganisation|reorganise]] electromechanical company [[Strömberg (company)|Ab Gottfr. Strömberg Oy]]. Subsequently, he bought the company's [[Elevator|lift]] business in 1924. The company, [[Kone|Kone Oy]], run small-scale [[licensed production]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Heikki Herlin 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Heikki Herlin 2"/&gt;

== Studies and early career ==
Herlin studied in [[Helsingin Suomalainen Yhteiskoulu|Helsinki Finnish Coeducational School]] and passed his [[Matriculation exam (Finland)|matriculation exam]] in 1919. He went to study [[mechanical engineering]] in [[Helsinki University of Technology]] and graduated in 1924. During 1925–1926 Herlin worked for [[Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie|AG Brown Boveri &amp; Cie]] in [[Mannheim]], [[Weimar Republic|Germany]]. In 1926 he returned to Finland for a short time to work as draftsman for Gottfr. Strömberg, but left already in 1927 to continue his studies in [[Columbia University]], United States. At the same time he worked as [[draughtsman]] for some American engineering companies. When Herlin returned to Finland in 1928, he initially worked as a designer for Kone, his father's company. During 1929–1932 Herlin worked as technical manager in [[Kone- ja Siltarakennus]] to managing [[Separator (milk)|separator]] production.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Heikki Herlin 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Heikki Herlin 2"/&gt;

== Manager of Kone ==
In 1932 Herlin followed his father as manager of Kone. The production in the [[Helsinki]]-located factory had grown steadily during Harald Herlin's leadership, but now the company started to develop rapid. The [[product quality]] was improved to meet an international standard and [[productivity]] was improved. Finland was in an economical upswing after the [[1930s recession]] was overcome, and number of new buildings, equipped with Kone lifts, were constructed. Also exports started in the same time. Prior to the [[Winter War]], the company employed 300–400 people and the annual production reached 250 lifts. Herlin became an influential representative of the Finnish engineering industry during the war years.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Heikki Herlin 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Heikki Herlin 2"/&gt;

After the [[Continuation War]] between Finland and Soviet Union ended to [[Moscow Armistice]], Finland had to pay large [[Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union|war reparations to Soviet Union]]. This included a number of Kone lifts and [[Crane (machine)|cranes]]. When the war reparations were finally paid off in the early 1950s, Herlin continued the export within normal trade agreements. At the turn of the 1960s, Kone was one of the ten biggest companies of Finland employing 2&amp;nbsp;000 people.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Heikki Herlin 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Heikki Herlin 2"/&gt;

Heikki H. Herlin led Kone until 1964 after which he was followed by his son [[Pekka Herlin]], but continued as board member until 1987.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Heikki Herlin 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Heikki Herlin 2"/&gt;

== Character ==
[[File:Habib-Bourguiba-1963-Finlande.jpg|240px|thumb|right|Herlin (right) presenting [[Kone]] premises to the [[President of Tunisia|Tunisian president]] [[Habib Bourguiba]] (middle) and the [[President of Finland|Finnish president]] [[Urho Kekkonen]] (left).]]
Herlin's early international experience effected on his career as Kone manager. He put focus on [[product development]] and was open-minded at extending the [[market area]]. His contribution on war reparation industry was significant; he also saw the potential of the Soviet market already in the 1940s.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Heikki Herlin 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Heikki Herlin 2"/&gt;

While Herlin had strong background and expertise in engineering industry, he had broad knowledge in other areas as well. He took part in organisational activities, such as [[Rotary Club]] and voluntary national defence. Herlin was founding member of the Finnish branch of the [[European Cultural Foundation]]. He also founded the Kone Foundation, that supports cultural and sociological research; one notable support project was publishing of genealogy book [[Genealogia Sursilliana]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Heikki Herlin 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Heikki Herlin 2"/&gt;

Heikki H. Herlin had a broad language knowledge, which he developed continuously. While he could communicate in every language which were most important for his business, he also studied exotic languages; for him it was a matter of honour to be able to give at least a vote of thanks in the local language, wherever he visited representing either his company or Finnish trade and industry delegations.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Heikki Herlin 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Heikki Herlin 2"/&gt;

== Personal life ==
Heikki H. Herlin lived in the Thorsvik Estate, which his father had bought. He met there his future wife Anna Oittinen at the turn of the 1930s; she had come there as a nurse to take care of his mother Hanna Herlin.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Heikki Herlin 2"/&gt; During 1931–1936 the couple got three daughters and one son, Pekka Herlin, who inherited his father's position as Kone leader.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Heikki Herlin 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Heikki Herlin 2"/&gt;

'''Indian Audit and Accounts Service (IA&amp;AS)''' is an Indian Central Government service, free of control from any executive authority, under the [[Comptroller and Auditor General of India]]. The officers of the Indian Audit and Accounts Service serve in an audit managerial capacity, in the Indian Audit and Accounts Department. IA&amp;AS is responsible for auditing the accounts of the Union and State governments and public sector organizations, and for maintaining the accounts of State governments. Its role is somewhat similar to the US [[GAO]] and [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)]].

The service can be divided into officers looking after accounting and audit issues pertaining to the Union government and the State governments, and those manning the department's headquarters. The state accounts and audit offices are headed by Accountants General or Principal Accountants General. They are functionally equivalent; only the designations vary. Major states have three Principal Accountants General (PAsG) or Accountants General (AsG), each heading Accounts and Entitlement (i.e., compiling state accounts, maintaining pension accounts, loan accounts, etc.), General and Social Sector Audit (GSSA) or Economic and Revenue Sector Audit (ERSA).

The equivalent officers at the Central level are Principal Directors (PDs) or Directors General (DsG). The PDs, DsG, AsG and PAsG report to Additional Deputy CAG  (also called ADAI, for historical reasons) or Deputy CAG (called DAI, again for historical reasons). The Deputy CAGs are the highest-ranked officers in the service.

After training, the Officer Trainees are posted as Assistant Accountant General Assistant Directors a Junior Grade Group A later promoted to Deputy Accountants General (DAsG) or Deputy Directors (DDs) a Senior time scale. Subsequent to their promotion, they become Senior Deputy Accountants General (Sr.DAsG) or Directors. All officers below the rank of AG/PD are also called Group Officers as they are generally in charge of a group in the office.

==Recruitment and training==

Recruitment to the IA&amp;AS is through the joint competitive examinations (the Union Public Service Commission) and through promotion from the subordinate cadre. Once recruited to the IA&amp;AS, the directly recruited officers are trained mainly at the [http://www.naaa.gov.in National Academy of Audit and Accounts], [[Shimla]], Himachal Pradesh, India. The training is split into two phases. Phase-1 involves giving a theoretical background to the students on concepts of Government and commercial auditing and accounting. Phase-2 gives emphasis on practical training. The training involves modules where Officer Trainees are attached to the Reserve Bank of India,TISS-Mumbai,SEBI the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, NIFM Faridabad, the Bureau of Parliamentary Studies and the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad. The Officer Trainees are also given an international exposure through attachment with London School of Economics and Political Science and [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)]].

'''International labour law''' is the body of rules spanning [[public international law|public]] and [[private international law]] which concern the rights and duties of employees, employers, [[trade union]]s and governments in regulating the workplace. The [[International Labour Organization]] and the [[World Trade Organization]] have been the main international bodies involved in reform labour markets. The [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]] have indirectly driven changes in labour policy by demanding [[structural adjustment]] [[Conditionality|conditions]] for receiving loans or grants. [[Conflict of laws]] issues arise, determined by national courts, when people work in more than one country, and supra-national bodies, particularly in the [[EU law|law]] of the [[European Union]], has a growing body of rules regarding labour rights.

'''International labour standards''' refer to conventions agreed upon by international actors, resulting from a series of value judgments, set forth to protect basic worker rights, enhance workers’ job security, and improve their terms of [[employment]] on a global scale. The intent of such standards, then, is to establish a worldwide minimum level of protection from inhumane labour practices through the adoption and implementation of said measures.  From a theoretical standpoint, it has been maintained, on ethical grounds, that there are certain basic [[human rights]] that are universal to humankind.&lt;ref name="Brown1"&gt;Brown, Drusilla K., Alan V. Deardorff and Robert M. Stern. "International Labour Standards and Trade: A Theoretical Analysis", ''Fair trade and harmonisation: Prerequisites for free trade?'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1996. 227–272.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is the aim of international labour standards to ensure the provision of such rights in the [[workplace]], such as against [[workplace aggression]], [[workplace bullying|bullying]], [[employment discrimination|discrimination]] and [[gender inequality]] on the other hands for [[diversity (business)|working diversity]], [[workplace democracy]] and [[empowerment]].

While the existence of international labour standards does not necessarily imply implementation or enforcement mechanisms, most real world cases have utilised formal treaties and agreements stemming from international institutions.&lt;ref name=Berik2006&gt;Berik, Günseli and Yana Rodgers. 2006. "Asia's race to capture post-MFA markets: a snapshot of labour standards, compliance, and impacts on competitiveness", ''Asian Development Review'' 23(1): 55–86.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary international agency charged with developing working standards is the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO). Established in 1919, the ILO advocates international standards as essential for the eradication of labour conditions involving "injustice, hardship and privation". According to the ILO, international labour standards contribute to the possibility of lasting [[peace]], help to mitigate potentially adverse effects of international [[market competition]] and help the progress of [[international development]].

Implementation, however, is not limited to the ILO nor is it constrained to the legislative model that the ILO represents.  Other alternatives include direct trade sanctions, multilateral enforcement, and voluntary standards. In addition to controversies that arise over each of these models, greater issues have also been raised concerning the debate over the need for international labour standards themselves. However, while critics have arisen, the [[international community]] has largely come to a consensus in favour of basic protection of the world’s labour force from inhumane practices.&lt;ref&gt;Maskus, Keith E. [http://elibrary.worldbank.org/content/workingpaper/10.1596/1813-9450-1817 "Should core labour standards be imposed through international trade policy?"] ''The World Bank: The Policy Working Paper Series'' 1 (1999), accessed March 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Associated with the development of successful international labour standards is proper monitoring and enforcement of labour standards. Most monitoring occurs through the ILO, but domestic agencies and other NGOs also play a role in the successful monitoring of international labour standards.&lt;ref name=ApplyingPromoting /&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of labour law}}
Since the [[industrial revolution]] the labour movement has been concerned how economic [[globalisation]] would weaken the bargaining power of workers, as their employers could move to hire workers abroad without the protection of the labour standards at home. In the Fourth Annual International Congress in 1869, the following was resolved:&lt;ref&gt;K Marx, ''Report of the General Council to the Fourth Annual Congress'' ([http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/iwma/documents/1869/basle-report.htm 1869])&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|the extension of the principle of free trade, which induces between nations such a competition that the interest of the workman is liable to be lost sight of and sacrificed in the fierce international race between capitalists, demands that such [unions] should be still further extended and made international.}}

=== Early history ===
The concept of protecting workers from the perils of labour environments dates all the way back to 14th-century Europe.&lt;ref name="Brown2"&gt;Brown, Drusilla K. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2696558 "Labour standards: Where do they belong on the international trade agenda?"] ''The Journal of Economic Perspectives'' 15, no. 3 (2001): 89-112, accessed March 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The first example of the modern labor rights movement, though, came in response to the brutal working conditions that accompanied the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref name="Brown2"/&gt;  In 1802, the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed what is now known as the [[Factory Acts|English Factory Act]].  The act sought to regulate the workday of apprentices by restricting work hours to 12 per day.&lt;ref name="Brown2"/&gt;  In doing so, the English Factory Act served as a precursor to the models of international labour standards seen today.  Minimal regulations similar to those found in English legislation subsequently became increasingly commonplace among 19th century industrialising nations.  Early attempts at the provision of labour standards were limited in scope, though.  Such conventions focused primarily on improving working conditions in relation to hours of work, women's and [[Child labour|children's labour]], and the use of hazardous materials.&lt;ref name="Brown1"/&gt; While it was evident that support for workers’ rights was inconsistent across international boundaries, activists originally only employed the use of moral suasion to deal with differences in labour standards.  It was not until the latter parts of the 19th century that efforts were made to implement uniform standards on an international scale.&lt;ref name="Brown2"/&gt;

=== Creation of ILO ===
[[File:Flag of ILO.svg|thumb|Flag of ILO]]
In 1919, following the end of the [[World War I|First World War]], the agenda on international labour standards reached a new level of prominence as a result of the founding of the [[International Labour Organization]].&lt;ref name="Brown1"/&gt; As mandated by Part XIII of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], the ILO was created as a branch of the [[League of Nations]] in order to address all conceivable aspects of labour rights.  Preliminary efforts focused primarily on the eradication of slavery and all forms of forced labour.&lt;ref name="Brown1"/&gt; The agenda quickly expanded, however, to include the rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining, non-discrimination in employment, and the elimination of child labour. The ILO’s creation marked the first instance of multiple major international actors coming together in an attempt to reach a consensus on universal workers’ rights. Despite a lack of any formal means of coercion, the ILO then urged its 44 original member countries to adopt and ratify conventions limiting oppressive labour market practices.&lt;ref name="Brown1"/&gt;

=== The early years of the ILO ===
In the first two years of the ILO’s existence, 22 international labour conventions were adopted.&lt;ref name=Origins&gt;{{cite web|title=Origins and History|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/history/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the topics that the first conventions addressed were “hours of work in industry, unemployment, maternity protection, night work for women, minimum age, and night work for young persons in industry.”&lt;ref name=Origins/&gt; In 1930, the ILO adopted the first future fundamental convention: the Forced Labour Convention (No.29), which prohibited all forms of forced labour unless exempted by certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ILO between the two world wars 1930|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/support/lib/century/content/1930.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With the onset of the [[Great Depression]], the [[United States]] joined the ILO in 1934 noting that complex labour issues would require an international response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brief History and Timeline|url=http://www.ilo.org/washington/ilo-and-the-united-states/brief-history-and-timeline/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the history of the [[League of Nations]], the ILO is the only League-affiliated organisation that the United States joined. With the backdrop of World War 2, the ILO broadened its mandate with the [[Declaration of Philadelphia]], signed during the 26th general conference session in 1944. The Declaration of Philadelphia, which is attached to the general constitution of the ILO, foreshadows some of the ILO’s earliest future fundamental conventions including the freedom of expression and association which was adopted in 1948 as Convention 87, Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention.&lt;ref name=Philadelphia&gt;{{cite web|title=Declaration of Philadelphia|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/libdoc/ilo/1944/44B09_10_e_f.pdf|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C087 - Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87)|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO:12100:P12100_ILO_CODE:C087|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Globalisation and changing divisions of labour ===
In the first half of the 20th century, global [[Division of labour|divisions of labour]] were shaped largely by the practices of [[colonialism]]. Poorer countries exported natural resources to richer countries, which then manufactured and produced specialised goods.&lt;ref name=Kabeer3&gt;Kabeer, Naila. [http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all?content=10.1080/1354570042000198227 "Globalisation, labour standards, and women's rights: dilemmas of collective (in)action in an interdependent world"], ''Feminist Economics'' 10, no. 1 (2004): 3-35, accessed March 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; As many colonised nations achieved independence, developing nations in the [[North-South divide|global South]] took on increasingly [[Protectionism|protectionist policies]] in attempts to build up the manufacturing sectors of their economies, thus marking a shift in the global division of labour. However, towards the latter part of the 20th century, a number of factors saw protectionist measures fall. Such factors included rising labour costs in the north, advances in transportation and communication technologies, the liberalisation of trade, and the deregulation of markets.&lt;ref name=Kabeer3/&gt; In the midst of a changing international labour landscape, developing nations in the south took on a previously unseen domination of the labour-intensive manufacturing industry.

With the deregulation of major markets and significant increases in the volume of international trade, attempts to make manufacturing sectors more attractive to retailers saw extreme downward pressure placed on the quality of working conditions in lower income regions of the world.&lt;ref name="Kabeer3" /&gt; This gave rise to growing concerns about a global [[Race to the bottom]], in which governments take part in the iterative loosening of labour protections in attempts to aid the international competitiveness of export-oriented industries. Fears of this nature consequently produced the notable increases in the discourse on international labour ethics that characterise the contemporary [[international human rights law|international human rights]] arena.&lt;ref name="Brown2" /&gt;

== Models ==
The traditional model of labour standards regulation has been, for most of history, within-country or within-jurisdiction legislation and enforcement.&lt;ref name=Block258&gt;Block, Richard N., Karen Roberts, Cynthia Ozeki and Myron J. Roomkin. "Models of international labour standards", ''Industrial Relations'' 40, no. 2 (2001): 258–292.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this model may not be appropriate when competitors in a product market are located in different countries or jurisdictions with dissimilar labour standards. This concern opens up the discussion for the establishment of international labour standards, which, in turn, require international regulation, particularly in the context of global trade. However, determining an effective method of implementation of international labor standards has been an area of difficulty and an area that is highly contested. The following sections outline several existing models for the regulation of international labour standards based largely on work by Richard N. Block, Karen Roberts, Cynthia Ozeki and Myron J. Roomkin in their paper titled "Models of International Labour Standards".&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt;

=== Legislative ===
The legislative model for implementing a set of international labour standards is the best known.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt; This model involves the enactment and enforcement of labour standards by a legislative body across a union of countries.  Social policies regarding employment and labour typically fall into three areas: free movement of labour, prevention of [[social dumping]] via low labour standards, and dialogue between labour and management.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt; This model has been adopted by the [[European Community]], part of the [[European Union]], and is also the model taken by the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO). Organisations, such as these, are given the authority, through a series of procedures, to then issue directives in any of these areas of labour policy. Member states must comply with these directives; however, what compliance actually means and entails is left to the discretion of each member state.

=== Direct trade sanctions ===
For over 25 years, there have been links between labour standards and [[international trade]], particularly for specific commodities.&lt;ref name=Berik56/&gt; The earliest and broadest-based example of linking international labour standards with trade is found in U.S. legislation under the [[Trade Act of 1974]], creating the [[Generalized System of Preferences]] (GSP). Under the GSP, the United States was allowed to grant nonreciprocal [[tariff]] preference to less developed countries, based on certain country and product eligibility criteria, in order to promote their economic growth and development. Among the country eligibility criteria is affording workers in a country certain internationally recognized rights, similar to the four core conventions established by the ILO.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. International Trade Commission. 1997. Advice on Providing Additional GSP Benefits for Least Developed Countries. Investigation No. 332-370, Publication 3023, February. At http://www.usitc.go:80/wais/reports/arc/W3023.HTM{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; If a complaint or petition was filed against a GSP beneficiary, these are processed through the [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]]. Since 1988, eight countries have been suspended or terminated from the GSP program: Burma, Liberia, Maldives, Mauritania, Nicaragua, Pakistan (several products), Sudan and Syria.&lt;ref name=Suspended&gt;"Countries Suspended from the GSP Program for Failure to Enforce Internationally Recognised Worker Rights", 1998, Correspondence with Jon Rosenbaum of the Office of the United States Trade Representative.&lt;/ref&gt; Four countries have been suspended but subsequently reinstated: Central African Republic, Chile, Paraguay, and Romania.&lt;ref name=Suspended/&gt; Additionally, Section 2202 of the [[Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988]] requires that the [[Secretary of State]] submit to Congress an annual report on the economic policy and trade practices of each country with which the United States has an economic or trade relationship.

The trade sanctions model in the United States, also working as an incentives approach of sorts, appears to have been successful in forcing U.S. officials to encourage countries that are the subject of complaints to address severe violations of labour standards, as defined in the legislation. This model, however, is not designed to be a broad-based guarantee of labour standards among trading partners because it is based on external complaints not the results of monitoring.&lt;ref name=Berik56/&gt; While it is effective in providing procedural rights, a lower percentage of trading partners provide substantive standards, so this measure has had mixed success. Some hope that implementation in competitor developing countries along with support by complementary domestic policies would allow this model to overall, raise the global [[social floor]].&lt;ref name=Berik56/&gt;

=== Multilateral enforcement ===
Another example of the various methods of implementation of international labour standards is the multilateral enforcement model. The model, embodied in the [[North American Free Trade Agreement|North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation]] (NAALC), is different from other compulsory methods in that it opposes any imposition of common standards schemes.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt; Instead, the multilateral enforcement model requires that signatories to agreements like the NAALC make firm commitments to existing labor standard structures within their respective domestic spheres.  The unique aspect of the NAALC, however, is that it does not in any way dictate policy.  This includes a strong aversion to uniformly adopted standards on the international level.  Rather than encouraging the inclusion of a baseline set of workers’ rights, the multilateral enforcement model merely requires that its members strive to create unbiased administrative bodies that judge whether or not appropriate measures are being taken to ensure the continued support of domestic labour standards.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt; In this manner, the multilateral model is not international in its adoption of a common set of principles, but rather in its level of required commitment to an unspecified group of standards.  In enforcing such commitments, agreements like the NAALC primarily utilize recommendations and publicity to make decision makers accountable for their actions.  Multilateral enforcement models like the NAALC have experienced mixed results in terms of effectiveness due to their limited powers of influence.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt;

=== Voluntary standards ===
The voluntary standards model makes reference to a system of implementation for labour standards based on a corporate [[code of conduct]]. Corporate codes of conduct are adopted when various organizations join together in agreement to operate under a set of socially responsible labour rules. Therefore, this model generally involves voluntary behaviour and self-regulation. An example of voluntary corporate adoption of labour standards is given by the [[Sullivan Principles]] in [[South Africa]] that were taken on by a group of U.S. companies.&lt;ref&gt;Dordrecht, Jan, Karen Paul and Steven D. Lyndenberg. 1992. "Applications of Corporate Social Monitoring Systems", ''Journal of Business Ethics'' 11(1):1-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, U.S. apparel retailers, such as [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], the Gap, and Liz Claiborne, have recently attempted to put in place a system of regulations to prevent their products from being produced under [[sweatshop]] conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Paula. 1998a. “U.S. Apparel Industry to Monitor World Shops.” Journal of Commerce, October 19, p. 1A.&lt;/ref&gt;

For this model to be successful, there must be incentive for compliance. The problem, however, is that in the case of labour standards, there are usually high economic incentives to disregard these standards, which are viewed as rises in production costs. For this reason, the monitoring system plays a crucial role in the success and effectiveness of such conditions. In some cases, like the aforementioned [[Sullivan Principles]] in South Africa, monitoring has demonstrated the codes’ success. In this case, investors rewarded adherence to the code, as a sign of [[corporate citizenship]]. On the other hand, consumers can also punish firms they see as socially irresponsible by means of [[boycott]]s or the individual decision to avoid purchase of certain products.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Richard B. 1994. “A Hard-Headed Look at Labour Standards.” In International Labour Standards and Economic Interdependence, edited by Werner Sengenberger and Duncan Campbell, pp. 79-91. Geneva: ILO&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The main point of these examples being: where there is strong pressure from investors and consumers to support certain standards, companies may benefit by being seen as upholding accepted morals.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt;

Now, while this is true, it is also true that where costs of complying with stringent standards are high and the sources of consumer pressure diffused, codes are likely to be ineffective.  It takes the active involvement and interest of the company, in response to whatever actions have been taken, for this model to be successful. When they choose to respond to outside pressures, companies use means such as public announcements, local religious leaders, human rights activists, university professors, and labor representatives, among others, to implement compliance and a system of monitoring. Another difficulty has been that, while pressure has been effectively pressed on individual firms, it has been difficult to find agreement at an industry level, in terms of corporate codes.

Finally, a variation of the voluntary standards models is one of certification, which began in October 1997 with the issuance of [[SA8000|SA (Social Accountability) 8000]] by the Council on Economic Priorities Accrediting Agency (CEPAA). [[SA8000]] is an example of a corporate certification process for social responsibility and labor standards.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt; This certification process has the purpose of identifying corporations that comply with certain criteria based on social accountability requirements, including criteria for [[child labor]] and worker health and safety. The resulting certification then serves the purpose of assuring customers that goods and services provided by certified firms have been produced by workers who are offered labour standards that meet at least a minimally acceptable level.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt;

==International Labour Organization==
{{Clist global labour}}
{{main|International Labour Organization|List of ILO Conventions}}
The [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) is a specialised agency of the [[United Nations]], consisting of 187 member countries, that deals with labour issues. Following [[World War I]], the [[Treaty of Versailles]] contained the first constitution of a new [[International Labour Organization]] founded on the principle that "labour is not a commodity", and for the reason that "peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice".&lt;ref&gt;[[Treaty of Versailles]] 1919, [[s:Constitution of the International Labour Office|Part XIII]], Section I and art 427&lt;/ref&gt; The primary role of the [[ILO]] has been to coordinate principles of international labour law by issuing Conventions, which codify labour laws on all matters. Members of the ILO can voluntarily adopt and ratify the conventions by enacting the rules in their domestic law. For instance, the first [[Hours of Work (Industry) Convention, 1919]] requires a maximum of a 48-hour week, and has been ratified by 52 out of 185 member states. The UK ultimately refused to ratify the Convention, as did many current EU members states, although the [[Working Time Directive]] adopts its principles, subject to the individual opt-out.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, KD Ewing, ''Britain and the ILO'' (2nd edn IER 1994) 16. Two further general working time conventions are the [[Forty-Hour Week Convention, 1935]] No 51 and the [[Holidays with Pay Convention, 1936]] No 52&lt;/ref&gt; The present constitution of the ILO comes from the [[Declaration of Philadelphia]] 1944, and under the [[Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work]] 1998 classified eight conventions&lt;ref&gt;There are 189 Conventions, however some have been superseded by others. For instance, Conventions Nos 2, 34, 96 and 181 all concern [[private employment agencies]], but only Convention 181 is in force.&lt;/ref&gt; as core. Together these require freedom to join a union, bargain collectively and take action (Conventions Nos [[Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention|87]] and [[Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention|98]]) abolition of forced labour ([[Forced Labour Convention|29]] and [[Abolition of Forced Labour Convention|105]]) abolition labour by children before the end of compulsory school ([[Minimum Age Convention, 1973|138]] and [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention|182]]) and no discrimination at work (Nos [[Equal Remuneration Convention|100]] and [[Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention|111]]). Compliance with the core Conventions is obligatory from the fact of membership, even if the country has not ratified the Convention in question. To ensure compliance, the ILO is limited to gathering evidence and reporting on member states' progress, so that publicity will put public and international pressure to reform the laws. Global reports on core standards are produced yearly, while individual reports on countries who have ratified other Conventions are compiled on a bi-annual or perhaps less frequent basis.

The ILO, by its existence, is the recognised international vehicle for raising international labour standards issues in a worldwide forum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilo.org/public/english/standards/relm/country.htm "Alphabetical list of ILO member countries"], ''International Labour Organization'', accessed April 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; No other model in existence is capable of performing this role. This organisation establishes labour standards by means of both conventions and recommendations and has a tripartite governing structure – representing government, employers and workers.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt; While ILO recommendations take more of the role of providing mere guidance to member states, the stronger form, ILO conventions, have the status of a [[treaty]], which, in principle, is binding on the member countries that voluntarily ratify them. These represent benchmarks of strong labour standards towards which countries can strive by promulgating and enforcing national laws that comply with the conventions.&lt;ref name=Berik56&gt;Berik, Günseli and Yana Van der Meulen Rodgers. "Options for enforcing labour standards: Lessons from Bangladesh and Cambodia", ''Journal of International Development'' 22 (2008): 56-85, www.interscience.wiley.com, accessed March 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It is through these means that the organisation works to enforce international labour standards.

In 1998, the ILO [[International Labour Conference]] adopted the “Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work” defining certain rights as “fundamental.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilo.org/declaration/lang--en/index.htm "Declaration: Home page"],  International Labour Organization, accessed April 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration commits member states to respect and promote these main principles, referred to as the core conventions, which are grouped into the following four categories (total of eight ILO conventions): freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to [[collective bargaining]], the elimination of forced or compulsory labour, the abolition of [[child labour]], and the elimination of [[discrimination]] in respect of employment and occupation. The Declaration claims these rights to be universal, applying to all people in all States – regardless of level of economic development.&lt;ref name=Berik56/&gt; The International Labour Conference regards these principles as so important that all member counties are obligated to comply with them, regardless of ratification status.

Alongside the fundamental conventions, the ILO has also identified four priority conventions or governance conventions. Crucial to the running of the international labour standards systems implemented by the ILO, the ILO recommends that member states ratify the following priority conventions: the Labour Inspection Convention (1947), the Labour Inspection (Agriculture) Convention (1969), the Triparte Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention (1976), and the Employment Policy Convention (1964).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conventions and Recommendations|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/introduction-to-international-labour-standards/conventions-and-recommendations/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues with the ILO’s approach to implementing international labour standards come down to a question of universality amongst the conventions and member countries, with some arguing that flexibility is necessary to meet the needs of developing countries. These concerns gather around the idea that the race to expand exports or attract foreign investment can cause competition on the basis of labour costs, leading to a decline in international labour standards as governments either dismantle national laws that protect workers or weaken the enforcement of these laws.&lt;ref name=Berik56/&gt; The underlying issue here is the connection between national incomes and the standards a country can feasibly support while remaining competitive. Other issues involve enforcement of these standards following ratification. The ILO provides a vehicle for investigating cases of noncompliance through representations, filed by employer or worker organisations, or complaints, lodged by another member that also ratified the convention.&lt;ref name=Berik56/&gt; These are then sent to a committee that launches an investigation and report. This is followed by either acceptance of recommendations on steps the government may take to address the complaint or the request to submit the case to the [[International Court of Justice]]. Failure to comply may result in an incurred sanction from the organization. [[File:Peace Palace covered by the first flakes of snow of 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Peace Palace]], the headquarters for the International Court of Justice]]

Overall, the ILO structure essentially created a system of [[voluntary compliance]] with labor standards based on ratification of the established conventions.  In general the enforcement system of representation and complaints has been successful – success being measured by the fact that only one representation or complaint has reached the most severe sanction.&lt;ref name=Berik56/&gt; On the other hand, due to the absence of strong sanctions, the ILO lacks a strong enough deterrent factor for countries inclined to violate the standards the ILO upholds. Further, the “flexibility” of standards allows too much leeway for adaptation based on independent circumstances, diminishing the force of the conventions.

==World Trade Organization==
{{main|Labour standards in the World Trade Organization}}
[[File:Wto logo.svg|thumb|left|As one of the only [[international organisations]] with real enforcement power through trade sanctions, the [[WTO]] has been the target for calls by labour lawyers to incorporate global standards of the [[International Labour Organization]].]]
Because the ILOs enforcement and sanction mechanisms are weak, there has been significant discussion about incorporating [[labour standards in the World Trade Organization]]'s operation, since its formation in 1994. The [[WTO]] oversees, primarily, the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] which is a treaty aimed at reducing customs, tariffs and other barriers to free import and export of goods, services and capital between its 157-member countries. Unlike for the ILO, if the WTO rules on trade are contravened, member states who secure a judgment by the [[Dispute settlement in the World Trade Organization|Dispute Settlement procedures]] (effective a judicial process) may retaliate through trade sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Hughes and Rorden Wilkinson (1998), "International Labour Standards and World Trade: No Role for the World Trade Organization?", New Political Economy, 3: 3, pp. 375-389&lt;/ref&gt; This could include reimposition of targeted tariffs against the non-compliant country. Proponents of an integrated approach have called for a "[[social clause]]" to be inserted into the GATT agreements, for example by amending article XX, which gives an exception to the general trade barrier reduction rules allowing imposition of sanctions for breaches of human rights. An explicit reference to core labour standards could allow action where a WTO member state is found to be in breach of ILO standards. Opponents argue that such an approach could backfire and undermine labour rights, as a country's industries, and therefore its workforce, are necessarily harmed but without any guarantee that labour reform would take place. Furthermore, it was argued in the Singapore Ministerial Declaration 1996 that "the [[comparative advantage]] of countries, particularly low-age developing countries, must in no way be put into question."&lt;ref&gt;Singapore Ministerial Declaration ([http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/minist_e/min96_e/wtodec_e.htm 13 December 1996])&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, it is argued that countries ought to be able to take advantage of low wages and poor conditions at work as a comparative advantage in order to boost their exports. Similarly it is disputed that business will relocate production to low wage countries from higher wage countries such as the UK, because that choice depends mostly on [[productivity]] of workers. The view of many labour lawyers and economists remains that more trade, in the context of weaker bargaining power and mobility for workers, still allows for business to opportunistically take advantage of workers by moving production, and that a coordinated multilateral approach with targeted measures against specific exports is preferable.&lt;ref&gt;See KA Elliott and [[RB Freeman]], ''Can Labor Standards Improve under Globalization?'' (Institute for International Economics 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; While the WTO has yet to incorporate labour rights into its procedures for dispute settlements, many countries began to make bilateral agreements that protected core labour standards instead.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. EU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement (14 May 2011) OJ 2011 L127, article 13&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in domestic tariff regulations not yet touched by the WTO agreements, countries have given preference to other countries who do respect core labour rights, for example under the EU Tariff Preference Regulation, articles 7 and 8.&lt;ref&gt;Tariff Preference Regulation (EC) No 732/2008 arts 7, 8, 15 and Annex II and III&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workers in multiple countries==
{{main|Conflict of laws}}
While the debate over labour standards applied by the ILO and the WTO seeks to balance standards with free movement of capital globally, [[conflicts of laws]] (or [[private international law]]) issues arise where workers move from home to go abroad. If a worker from America performs part of her job in Brazil, China and Denmark (a "peripatetic" worker) or if a worker is engaged in Ecuador to work as an expatriate abroad in France, an employer may seek to characterise the contract of employment as being governed by the law of the country where labour rights are least favourable to the worker, or seek to argue that the most favourable system of labour rights does not apply. For example, in a [[UK labour law]] case, ''[[Ravat v Halliburton Manufacturing and Services Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2012] UKSC 1&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Ravat was from the UK but was employed in Libya by a German company that was part of the American multinational oil conglomerate, [[Halliburton]]. He was dismissed by a supervisor based in [[Egypt]]. He was told he would be hired under UK law terms and conditions, and this was arranged by a staffing department in Aberdeen. Under the UK [[Employment Rights Act 1996]] he would have a right to unfair dismissal, but the Act left open what the territorial scope of the statute was. The UK Supreme Court held that the principle would be that for an expatriate worker, although the general rule is that they will not have UK labour law rights, there would be an exception if the worker could show a "close connection" to the UK, and this was established through the contractual assurances given to Mr Rabat.&lt;ref&gt;See also ''[[Lawson v Serco Ltd]]'' [2006] UKHL 3 and ''[[Duncombe v Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families]]'' [2011] UKSC 36&lt;/ref&gt;

This fits within the general framework in the EU. Under the EU [[Rome I Regulation]] article 8,&lt;ref&gt;Rome I Regulation (Regulation (EC) No 593/2008&lt;/ref&gt; workers will have employment rights of the country where they habitually work. But exceptionally they may have a claim in another country if they can establish a close connection to it. The Regulation emphasises that the rules should be applied with the purpose of protecting the worker.&lt;ref&gt;See Rome I, recital 23 and Brussels I, recital 13&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also necessary that a court has jurisdiction to hear a claim. Under the [[Brussels I Regulation]] article 19,&lt;ref&gt;Brussels I Regulation (EC) No 44/2001&lt;/ref&gt; this requires the worker habitually works in the place where the claim is brought, or is engaged there.

==European Union law==
{{main|EU law|European labour law|Directive on services in the internal market}}
The [[European Community]] (EC) is a multigovernmental legislative structure that, through the [[Treaty of European Union]] (Maastricht) in 1992, the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]] in 1997, and various other agreements has promoted full economic integration of its member states.&lt;ref name=Springer1994&gt;Springer, Beverly. 1994. ''The European Union and Its Citizens: The Social Agenda'', Westport, CT: Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt; While it has issued a number of directives in non-labour areas, the same cannot be said for matters concerning social policy and labour. However, some restrictions regarding health and safety have been adopted by the EC in an attempt to mitigate any inhumane practices, involving low health and safety standards, used for the sake of a [[competitive advantage]].&lt;ref name=Springer1994/&gt;

The European Union, unlike most international organisations, has an extensive system of labour laws, but officially excluding (according to the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]]) matters around direct wage regulation (e.g. setting a minimum wage), fairness of dismissals (e.g. a requirement for elected workers to approve dismissals) and collective bargaining. A series of Directives regulate almost all other issues, for instance the [[Working Time Directive]] guarantees 28 days of paid holiday, the [[Equality Framework Directive]] prohibits all forms of discrimination for people performing work, and the [[Collective Redundancies Directive]] requires that proper notice is given and consultation takes place before any decisions about economic dismissals are finalised.

However, the [[European Court of Justice]] has recently expanded upon the Treaties through its case law. As well as having legal protection for workers rights, an objective of trade unions has been to organise their members across borders in the same way that [[multinational corporations]] have organised their production globally. In order to meet the balance of power that comes from ability of businesses to dismiss workers or relocate, unions have sought to take collective action and strikes internationally. However, this kind of coordination was recently challenged in the [[European Union]] in two controversial decisions. In ''[[Laval Ltd v Swedish Builders Union]]''&lt;ref&gt;(2008) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62005J0341:EN:HTML C-319/05]&lt;/ref&gt; a group of Latvian workers were sent to a construction site in Sweden on low pay. The local Swedish Union took industrial action to make Laval Ltd sign up to the local collective agreement. Under the [[Posted Workers Directive]], article 3 lays down minimum standards for workers being posted away from home so that workers always receive at least the minimum rights that they would have at home in case their place of work has lower minimum rights. Article 3(7) goes on to say that this "shall not prevent application of terms and conditions of employment which are more favourable to workers". Most people thought this meant that more favourable conditions could be given than the minimum (e.g. in Latvian law) by the host state's legislation or a collective agreement. However, in an interpretation seen as astonishing by many, the ECJ said that only the posting state could raise standards beyond its minimum for posted workers, and any attempt by the host state, or a collective agreement (unless the collective agreement is declared universal under article 3(8)) would be an infringement of the business' freedom to provide services under [[TFEU]] article 56. This decision was implicitly reversed by the European Union legislature in the [[Rome I Regulation]], which makes clear in recital 34 that the host state may allow more favourable standards. However, in ''[[The Rosella]]'', the ECJ also held that a blockade by the [[International Transport Workers Federation]] against a business that was using an [[Estonia]]n [[flag of convenience]] (i.e. saying it was operating under Estonian law to avoid labour standards of Finland) infringed the business' right of free establishment under [[TFEU]] article 49. The ECJ said that it recognised the workers' "right to strike" in accordance with ILO Convention 87, but said that its use must be proportionately to the right of the business' establishment. The result is that the European Court of Justice's recent decisions create a significant imbalance between the international freedom of business, and that of labour, to bargain and take action to defend their interests.

For those members within the EC who favour the implementation of labour standards, there has been a push to ease the decision-making barriers to social legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Liebfried, Stephan and Paul Pierson (eds.). 1995. "Semisovereign Welfare States: Social Policy in a Multitiered Europe", ''European Social Policy: Between Fragmentation and Integration'', pp. 43-77. Washington: The Brookings Institution.&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 February, 1992, the signing of the [[Maastricht Treaty]] made it easier to pass legislation on less controversial issues, such as health and safety, nondiscrimination, and consultation with workers.&lt;ref&gt;European Union. 1998a. “Glossary: The Reform of the European Union.” At European Union Internet resources: {{cite web |url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/GSSI/eu.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030402125359/http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/GSSI/eu.html |archivedate=2003-04-02 |df= }} linked to http://europa.eu.int/en/agenda/igc-home/en/g4000s.htm#s1 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990208203802/http://europa.eu.int/en/agenda/igc-home/en/g4000s.htm#s1#s1 |date=1999-02-08 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the EC provides a structure for enacting legislation that applies across counties, the extent to which it can actually create international labour standards, even within its own confines, is limited.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt; While these directives allow for labour concerns to be brought above the national level, the presence of philosophical differences among member states as well as constraints on state autonomy demonstrate barriers to this model. However, despite these difficulties and a complex decision-making structure designed to include consultation with the governments of all member states, the various EC policy-making institutions and the related parties have succeeded in creating cross-national legislation for labour standards under its social policy umbrella.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt; Consequently, this model, as demonstrated by the EC, is a viable one for establishing labour standards on a cross-national basis. The difficulty lies in the duplication of this model elsewhere, due to the EC’s unique, integrated community that is the only such general multinational standard system in the world today.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt;

== Monitoring ==
A crucial element to the success of international labour standards is proper monitoring and enforcement. When monitoring international labor standards, agencies rely on three major types of information: information from international organisations, like the ILO, information from national agencies, and information from non-governmental organizations.&lt;ref name=NationalAcademiesPress&gt;{{cite book|author=Committee on Monitoring International Labour Standards, Center for Education, Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, and Policy and Global Affairs|title=Monitoring international labor standards techniques and sources of information|year=2004|publisher=National Academies Press|location=Washington, DC|edition=[Online-Ausg.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon locating and determining the necessary data, monitoring agencies then need to process and sift through the results to analyze compliance with certain international labor standards. Finally after compliance analysis, recommendations and required adjustments are then communicated to the concerned party.&lt;ref name=NationalAcademiesPress/&gt;

=== Data sources ===
One of the major sources of data necessary for the monitoring of international labour standards is the International Labour Organization. According to Article 22 of the ILO Constitution, “each of the members agrees to make an annual report to the International Labour Office on the measures which it has taken to give effect to the provisions of Conventions to which it is a party.”&lt;ref name=Constitution&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of the International Labour Organization|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/leg/download/constitution.pdf|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, countries are mandated to prepare a report every two years for the Core Labour Standards of the ILO and every five years for all other active conventions that the country has ratified, which are submitted, to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and the Conference Committee on the Application of Standards.&lt;ref name=ExpCommittee&gt;{{cite web|title=Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/applying-and-promoting-international-labour-standards/committee-of-experts-on-the-application-of-conventions-and-recommendations/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For conventions that have not yet been ratified by the country, Article 19 of the ILO Constitution mandates countries to demonstrate on regular intervals steps “they have taken to give effect to any provision of certain conventions or recommendations, and to indicate any obstacles which have prevented or delayed the ratification of a particular convention.”&lt;ref name=Constitution/&gt; All of the above combine to form the ILO’s regular system of supervision.&lt;ref name=ApplyingPromoting&gt;{{cite web|title=Applying and promoting International Labour Standards|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/applying-and-promoting-international-labour-standards/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Surveys|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/applying-and-promoting-international-labour-standards/general-surveys/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Flag of the United Nations.svg|thumb|Flag of the United Nations]]
The ILO also has a special procedures type of supervisory mechanism where complaints levelled against member states and freedom of association complaints are dealt with.&lt;ref name=ApplyingPromoting/&gt; Under articles 24 and 26 of the ILO Constitution, different groups of people may indicate to the governing body that a certain state is not complying with an international labor standard that they have previously ratified.&lt;ref name=NationalAcademiesPress/&gt;&lt;ref name=Constitution/&gt; Within the ILO framework, the labor standard regarding the freedom to associate has also received a special priority which allows complaints to be brought up to the governing body even if the state has not ratified the conventions regarding the freedom of association.&lt;ref name=ApplyingPromoting/&gt;

Other international organisations like the [[United Nations]] and the [[World Bank]] also monitor international labour standards.&lt;ref name=NationalAcademiesPress/&gt; The United Nations largely relies on self-reported data from member states. These data points are used to determine whether or not member states are meeting the requirements of international treaties agreed to by the United Nations. Given that the ILO is a subset of the UN, generally, more detailed labour standards data and compliance records are located within the realm of the ILO.&lt;ref name=NationalAcademiesPress/&gt; The World Bank incorporates the international standards set by the ILO as one of the factors behind assistance to member states.

National agencies and NGOs also monitor international labour standards. National agencies generally report on domestic compliance of international labour standards while NGOs are much more diverse in their scope.&lt;ref name=NationalAcademiesPress/&gt;

=== Challenges ===
Several challenges, however, exist in the monitoring of international labour standards. The ILO and other international organisations generally rely on self-reporting data from countries.&lt;ref name=ApplyingPromoting /&gt;&lt;ref name=NationalAcademiesPress /&gt;&lt;ref name=ExpCommittee /&gt; Some analysts have questioned the quality and neutrality of these sources of data. For example, definitions of what constitutes [[unemployment]] vary from country to country making it difficult to compare data and to judge data quality.&lt;ref name=NationalAcademiesPress /&gt;  Additionally, despite the large amount of data, there are still gaps in their coverage. Coverage is greatest in the urban environments and the formal sector. Conversely, gaps exist in the coverage of rural environments and informal sectors which can positively skew the labour statistics that countries report.&lt;ref name=NationalAcademiesPress /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Rigby, Crispin |author=Division of Behavioural and Social Sciences and Education, Policy and Global Affairs Division, National Research Council of the National|title=Monitoring international labour standards international perspectives : summary of regional forums|year=2004|publisher=National Academies Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-309-52986-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Challenges also exist in the usage of data to assess compliance with various international labour standards. As interest continues to grow in the monitoring and enforcement of international labour standards, an assessment, according to the National Research Council, “requires careful analysis of what the core labor standards mean and imply, how to determine when a country is or is not in compliance, what indicators of compliance and which sources of information to use, and limitations of the sources of information.”&lt;ref name=NationalAcademiesPress /&gt;  Standardisation will be necessary to allow proper and effective monitoring of labor standards.

== Violations ==
=== Workplace discrimination ===
{{See also|Employment Discrimination}}
Workplace discrimination, overt and covert, is an example of violations of international labour standards.  The ILO defines workplace discrimination as “treating people differently because of certain characteristics, such as race, colour, or sex, which results in the impairment of equality and of opportunity and treatment.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Workplace Discrimination|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/equality-and-discrimination/workplace-discrimination/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020214812/http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/equality-and-discrimination/workplace-discrimination/lang--en/index.htm|archivedate=20 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An overt example of workplace discrimination is unequal pay, especially between men and women. Though recognized as an example of workplace discrimination since 1919, the [[gender pay gap]], often a measurement of unequal pay, is estimated to be 22.9%, which means that for every dollar earned by a man, a woman, in the same position would earn 77.1 cents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equal Pay: An Introductory Guide|url=http://www.ilo.org/ilc/ILCSessions/100thSession/reports/reports-submitted/WCMS_154779/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013|author1=Oelz, Martin  |author2=Olney, Shauna &amp; Tomei, Manuela}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that the ILO proposes that there are many benefits to reducing and eliminating the gender pay gap, at the current, slow rates of gender pay reduction, the ILO estimates that “another 75 years will be needed to bridge this gap.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A New Era of Social Justice|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/@ed_norm/@relconf/documents/meetingdocument/wcms_155656.pdf|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Job security]] is another arena where workplace discrimination can be found. In some developing countries, like Bangladesh, job insecurity reflects patriarchal societies that have diminished women’s options. Currently in Bangladesh, of the 1.8 million workers in garment factories, 1.5 million are women. From the perspective of the factory owners, the advantage of hiring woman is the “docility that comes with disadvantage.”&lt;ref name=Kabeer3 /&gt; Women have fewer opportunities than men when it comes to decent, respectable employment. For many of these women, if they were to lose their jobs at the garment factories, they would be forced into poverty or work in the informal sector, like prostitution.&lt;ref name=Kabeer3 /&gt;

Other forms of discrimination, outside of [[gender discrimination]], include discrimination based on race &amp; ethnicity, age, religion, political opinions, social origins, disabilities, sexual orientations, genetics, and lifestyle. The ILO identifies all these forms of discrimination as violations of international labor standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equality at work: The continuing challenge|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---relconf/documents/meetingdocument/wcms_154779.pdf|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Child labour ===
{{Main|Child Labour}}
[[File:Minimum age convention.png|thumb|300px|Parties to ILO's 1973 Minimum Age Convention, and the minimum ages they have designated: purple, 14 years; green, 15 years; blue, 16 years]]
[[File:Mining diggerboys.jpg|thumb|Young diamond miners in Sierra Leone]]
According to the ILO, [[child labor]] is “work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity, and that is harmful to physical and mental development.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is child labour|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/facts/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ILO classifies work conducted by children into three categories: children in employment, child labor, and hazardous work. The ILO condemns both child labor and hazardous work with the goal of eliminating hazardous child labor by 2016. In 2012, the ILO estimated that 168 million children (11% of the world’s children) were engaged in child labour, of which, 85 million engaged in hazardous work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Making progress against child labour|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---ipec/documents/publication/wcms_221513.pdf|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ILO Convention No. 5 adopted in 1919 and entered into force in 1921 was the first ILO convention regulating child labour. Specifically, the main provision of the article stated “children under the age of fourteen years shall not be employed or work in any public or private industrial undertaking.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C005 - Minimum Age (Industry) Convention, 1919 (No. 5)|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO:12100:P12100_ILO_CODE:C005|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its inception in 1919, several other ILO conventions had been adopted that have modified and expanded the initial 1919 convention. Today, the C138 [[Minimum Age Convention, 1973]] and C182 [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention]] 1999 have replaced all the previous conventions. The Minimum Age Convention defines the minimum age children are allowed to work. Children, unless under special allowances, are not allowed to engage in hazardous work until the age of 18. The basic minimum age for child labor is 15 (14 for developing countries), and the minimum wage for light work, which may not interfere with education or vocational orientation and training, is 13 (12 for developing countries).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C138 - Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No. 138)|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO:12100:P12100_ILO_CODE:C138|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  C182 urges all governments to take immediate action to identify and eliminate the worst forms of child labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C182 - Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182)|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO:12100:P12100_ILO_CODE:C182|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The following are defined as hazardous work according to the ILO:
* “Work which exposes children to physical, psychological, or sexual abuse
*Work underground, underwater, at dangerous heights, or in confined spaces
*Work with dangerous machinery, equipment, and tools, or which involves the manual handling or transport of heavy loads
*Work in an unhealthy environment which may, for example, expose children to hazardous substances, agents, or processes, or to temperatures, noise levels, or vibrations, damaging to their health
*Work under particularly difficult conditions such as work for long hours or during the night or work where the child is unreasonably confined to the premises of the employer” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eliminating the worst forms of child labour: A practical guide to ILO Convention No. 182 - Handbook for parliamentarians No. 3, 2002|url=http://www.ilo.org/pardev/civil-society/parliamentarians/WCMS_172685/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020224427/http://www.ilo.org/pardev/civil-society/parliamentarians/WCMS_172685/lang--en/index.htm|archivedate=20 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of UN Member States has ratified both C138 and C182. The [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention]] (C182) has been ratified by 177 nations, while 8 countries (Cuba, Eritrea, India, Marshall Islands, Myanmar, Palau, Somalia, Tuvalu) have yet to ratify it. The [[Minimum Age Convention]] (C138) has been ratified by 166 countries, while 19 countries have yet to ratify it.

=== {{anchor|C155|C161|C187}} Unsafe labour practices ===
[[File:Image of Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire on March 25 - 1911.jpg|thumb|Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire on March 25, 1911]]
Operating under the mantra that “decent work is safe work,” the ILO Programme on Safety and Health at Work and the Environment, SafeWork, has the goal of making work safer for all. According to the ILO, someone dies from a work-related accident or disease every 15 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Safety and health at work|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/safety-and-health-at-work/lang--en/index.htm |publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unsafe labour practices have a long, sordid history. From the 1911 [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]] to the 2013 [[West Fertiliser Company Explosion|fertilizer explosion]] in West, Texas, [[industrial disasters]] negatively affect the lives of workers and their dependents with high associated economic costs. Since its creation in 1919, ensuring worker safety has been one of the ILO’s fundamental missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Global strategy on occupational safety and health: Conclusions adopted by the International Labour Conference at its 91st Session, 2003|url=http://www.ilo.org/safework/info/policy-documents/WCMS_107535/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ILO has over its history adopted several conventions that have the goal of maximising worker safety and health. Currently, there are three fundamental conventions that are in effect: the Occupation Safety and Health Convention (C155, 1981), the Occupational Health Services Convention (C161, 1985), and the Promotional Framework for Occupational Safety and Health Convention (C187, 2006). The most recent convention has the stated aim of “promoting a preventative safety and health culture and progressively achieving a safe and healthy working environment.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Labour Standards on Occupational safety and health|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/subjects-covered-by-international-labour-standards/occupational-safety-and-health/lang--en/index.htm |publisher= International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One challenge that the ILO faces is the low ratification levels of the fundamental health and safety conventions.

== Criticisms ==
In addition to disagreements about the appropriate method of implementation for international labour standards, there are dissenting opinions concerning the validity of their existence at all.  The two most common arguments raised against international labour standards are that they undermine international competitiveness and erode domestic policy.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

=== Undermines international competitiveness ===
A critique of international labour standards historically raised by right-of-centre economists is that they distort market forces, thus inhibiting employment and income.&lt;ref name=Kabeer3/&gt; According to right-wing economists, global free trade allows countries to specialise in those activities in which they have a [[comparative advantage]] and to reap mutual gains through exchange.  The international competitiveness of countries with large amounts of unskilled labour depends on their ability to provide low-cost workers.&lt;ref name=Kabeer3/&gt; Therefore, international standards would undermine any comparative advantage by increasing the cost of labour.  According to the conservative argument, international labour standards leave developing nations with a diminished export economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Labour standards in international trade agreements: an assessment of the arguments|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/095851999340594|journal = The International Journal of Human Resource Management|date = January 1, 1999|access-date = 2015-04-24|issn = 0958-5192|pages = 351–375|volume = 10|issue = 2|doi = 10.1080/095851999340594|first = George|last = Tsogas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of international labour standards often respond by arguing that this critique only attacks a particular aspect of enforcement rather than the standards themselves.  Furthermore, left-of-centre economists suggest that higher labour standards do not necessarily undermine competitiveness.&lt;ref name=Berik2006/&gt; Empirical evidence provided by Berik and Rodgers (2006) suggests that any costs of raising labour standards can easily be offset by incentives encouraging [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI) and exports.&lt;ref name=Berik2006/&gt; Following this line of argument, not only do higher labour standards improve social and political stability, thus encouraging more foreign investment, but they also provide valuable investments in human capital that can lead to efficiency gains.&lt;ref name=Berik2006/&gt;

=== Erodes domestic policy ===
Another prominent argument against international labour standards is the notion that any attempt to harmonise set benchmarks for acceptable working conditions disregards, to some extent, the current state of an individual country’s unique economic and social climates.&lt;ref name="Brown1"/&gt; It is suggested that rather than adopting an internationally agreed upon group of labour standards, sovereign states are better off leaving labour market regulation to domestic policy.&lt;ref name="Brown1"/&gt; In this way, it is argued, a country can tailor a standard such as a minimum wage to the specific situation in that area of the world rather than trying to implement an ill-fitting uniform wage.&lt;ref name="Brown1"/&gt; In a 1996 study, Drusilla Brown, Alan Deardorff and Robert Stern use a variety of theoretical labour models to test the effectiveness of the harmonisation of international labour standards.&lt;ref name=Seminar3&gt;Brown, Drusilla K., Alan V. Deardorff and Robert M. Stern. [http://www. fordschool.umich.edu/rsie/workingpapers/ppp.html "International labour standards and trade: A theoretical analysis"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020012258/http://www/ |date=2011-10-20 }}, ''Research Seminar in International Economics'' 3 (1996), accessed March 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The study concludes that in theoretical cases, market failures that allow a breakdown in working environment conditions are most adequately remedied by labour standards.&lt;ref name=Seminar3/&gt; However, market failures are not uniform across countries and so it stands to reason that labour standards should not be constructed in an international way.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

An example of this critique can be seen by looking at the issue of child labour practices.  The case against harmonised international labour rights makes the point that the amount of child labour in a country is directly dependent on its level of economic development.&lt;ref name="Brown2"/&gt; Following this line of reasoning, poorer countries have a better chance at abolishing child labour through economic development rather than minimum age requirements. In fact, one study found that children 14 years and younger are not completely withdrawn from the labour force until GDP approaches $5000 per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Edmonds | first1 = E.

'''Josiah Clifton Firth''' (27 October 1826 &amp;ndash; 11 December 1897) was a New Zealand farmer, businessman and politician who had a brief brush with fame as the messenger between [[Te Kooti]] and the New Zealand Government during [[Te Kooti's War]].

Born in [[Clifton, West Yorkshire]], England, Firth came from a family background interested in farming and industrial development. He had a well rounded education. He moved to New Zealand in the early 1850s and settled in [[Auckland]] where he began making bricks and also took a one third interest in a steam powered flour mill in 1856. 

In 1859 he made his first visit to [[Matamata]] where he met and became friends with [[Wiremu Tamihana]], the King Maker&lt;ref name="DNZB Firth"&gt;{{DNZB|last=Waterson|first=D. B.|id=1F7|title=Firth, Josiah Clifton - Biography|accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and met [[Pōtatau Te Wherowhero|King Pōtatau]] during a tour of the Waikato he published in 1860. His account ended with a prophecy of the [[Invasion of the Waikato]], saying, "''It is unfortunate that the remedy we propose should have an aspect of selfishness. For we say to them, and justly, 'Sell three-fourths of your lands, and cease to be nomads, if you wish to save your race from extinction.' They not unnaturally decline the prescription when the fee is apparently so large. So the matter rests for the present. Time and the natural progress of events will, nevertheless, shortly either enforce the prescription and exact the fee, or consign the refractory patients to a swift and sure destruction''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/new-zealander/1860/01/28/7|title=New Zealander {{!}} 28 January 1860|last=|first=|date=|website=paperspast.natlib.govt.nz|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Auckland he was one of a small group of highly influential business men such as [[John Logan Campbell]], [[Frederick Whitaker]] and Thomas Morrin. They had significant influence on The [[Bank of New Zealand]] and the [[New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Company]]. Firth was always able to borrow  finance to capitalize his many innovative schemes.&lt;ref&gt;Firth Tower and Stanley landing. Historical Reserves Management Plan Matamata District Council.&lt;/ref&gt;

Firth briefly entered Parliament for the [[Auckland West]] electorate. He was elected in [[New Zealand general election, 1860–61|1861]]&lt;!-- election held on 11 January 1861 --&gt;, and resigned on 30 April 1862.&lt;ref name="DNZB Firth" /&gt; He promoted the purchase of land directly from Maori as had happened in the Wairarapa. This contravened the Treaty of Waitangi but had been a mechanism used from time to time in localized issues when Maori agreed.

In 1865 with the establishment of peace in the Waikato, Firth was able to lease land from Wiremu Tamihana  of Ngati Haua, a kingitanga tribe. Tamihana, who was a Christian, had been at the core of the Kingite movement but was at heart a man of peace. A large area of land  around [[Matamata]] was leased for a rental of up to five hundred pounds a year. Two years later he bought outright some of the land covered by the lease and this became the basis of his estate at Matamata. By 1865 Firth had leased 55,000 acres."The fern and bracken covered plains was burnt and soon sown in grassland and feed crops such as turnips".

He built his first homestead near Peria where Tamihana had earlier established a missionary station. When Tamihana died in 1866 Firth had a monument built at the place he died with an inscription that said it was Tamihana's will that Firth stay on the Matamata land as long as he (Firth) chose.&lt;ref&gt;Firth Tower and Stanley Landing.. Matamata District Council.&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, his businesses in Auckland were prospering and he was able to lease a very fine house on the eastern side of [[Mount Eden]] from John Ogilvie (1839?-1871) Secretary to the Auckland Board of Commissioners (in 1871 he would purchase the house).

Early in 1870 Josiah, or Hohaia as he was known to the [[Māori people|Māori]], was contacted by Te Kooti during his flight from Te Porere through the King Country and back to the Ureweras. From his base at Tapapa, near Tirau. Te Kooti sent a message to Firth to meet him at Wiremu Tamihana's monument. Firth  claimed to have inherited Wiremu Tamihana's "mantle of patience". Before the meeting Firth contacted Daniel Pollen the general agent for the government in Auckland. On 17 January Firth met Te Kooti. Firth told Te Kooti he had come to listen -he had no power to offer any terms. They talked for some time with Te Kooti emphasising he would not surrender but wanted to be left in peace to live at Tapapa. Firth noted that although Te Kooti was unarmed he was backed by a semi circle of heavily armed men with modern weapons in good condition.&lt;ref&gt;Redemption Songs. J. Binney. p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; He told Firth: "If they let me alone I will live quietly; if not I will fight."

The government sent word to Firth that they had nothing to say to Te Kooti apart from if he surrendered he would be given safe conduct to Auckland. This telegram crossed with one from Firth outlining Te Kooti's wishes. But Te Kooti had aroused too much fear and hatred for his offer to be accepted, and it was rejected out of hand. There was also considerable official annoyance with Josiah Firth. The Premier Willian Fox and the government agent for Hawkes Bay J.D. Ormond were irate"with that meddlesome sweep Firth."The military were instructed to attack Te Kooti whether Firth was with him or not. For Te Kooti the whole meeting may have been another ruse, as shortly afterwards Chief Te Hiri from Coromandel arrived and gave Te Kooti a huge quantity of gunpowder(7kegs) and a bag of  bullets 2 feet high. In fact Te Kooti had "predicted" he would be given the ammunition down to the exact day and time.&lt;ref&gt;Redemption Songs. J. Binney. p. 198–201. Auckland University Press. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; indicating the resupply mission had been prearranged.

In 1873 Firth began a seven-year project to clear the Waihou River of snags and obstacles to navigation thus opening the upper reaches of the Thames Estuary to shipping.&lt;ref name="NZETC Firth"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cyclopedia of New Zealand : Auckland Provincial District |year=1902 |url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Cyc02Cycl-t1-body1-d1-d10-d17.html |author=Cyclopedia Company Limited |accessdate=8 June 2010 |location=Christchurch |chapter=Mr. Josiah Clifton Firth}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the author of "Our Kin across the Sea".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Australasia|Firth, Josiah Clifton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871 Firth purchased his Auckland residence 'Clifton' which he had previously leased, and extended the building. To the rear of the wooden Gothic house he erected a large wing in the Castellated style which included a 15 metre tall tower, completed in 1873. This structure was built in unreinforced [[concrete]], an experimental material for the period. As well a providing a vantage point with splendid views of the [[Waitematā Harbour]] the tower contained a water tank so the up-to-date indoor plumbing had good water pressure. The tower also contained a study for Firth in which he arranged a small museum of geological items and other curiosities. In 1882 at Matamata he constructed a second castellated tower, a slightly smaller version of the Mt Eden tower and likewise an extension to an earlier wooden residence. Both structures are still standing - the Matamata Tower being a tourist attraction in its own right.

Firth championed the use of concrete as a building material and significantly Firth's sons would go on to found the [[Firth Concrete|Firth Concrete Company]]. Firth's two concrete structures are now some of the earliest examples of concrete construction in the country ([[John Logan Campbell]]'s 1871 house 'Loganbank' in Official Bay having been demolished). As a member of the Beresford Street Congregationalist Church in [[Karangahape Road]], Firth influenced the choice of concrete for that building as well (1875).

In 1882 Firth arranged a grand reception in the grounds of Clifton House for the Maori King, [[Tawhiao]]. Firth had played a part in the establishment of Tawhiao's father The Waikato chief [[Potatau Te Wherowhero]] as Maori King in 1858.

New Zealand agriculture went through a serious depression during the 1880s, one which hit Firth hard, and in 1889 he was declared bankrupt.  Later he began to develop a trade in [[pumice]] based on its properties of insulation and fire resistance, travelling to the [[United States]] and England. He died suddenly on 11 December 1897 just as the venture was becoming successful,&lt;ref name="DNZB Firth" /&gt; and was buried at St Stephen's Cemetery in the Auckland suburb of Parnell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=AS18971213.2.31 | date=13 December 1897| title=Mr J.

He founded [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd.]]

== Biography ==
Born in [[Kagoshima, Kagoshima|Kagoshima]] to a [[kimono]] merchant, Kawasaki Shōzō became a tradesman at the age of 17 in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], the only place in Japan then open to the West. He started a [[shipping]] business in [[Osaka]] at 27, which failed when his [[cargo ship]] sank during a storm. In 1869, he joined a company handling [[sugar]] from the [[Ryukyu Islands]], established by a [[Kagoshima Prefecture|Kagoshima]] [[samurai]], and in 1893, researched Ryukyu sugar and sea routes to the Ryukyus at the request of the [[Ministry of Finance (Japan)|Ministry of Finance]]. In 1894, he was appointed executive vice president of Japan Mail Steam-Powered Shipping Company,&lt;!-- Nippon Yusen? --&gt;  and succeeded in opening a sea route to the Ryukyu and transporting sugar to mainland Japan.

Having experienced many sea accidents in his life, Kawasaki deepened his trust in Western ships because they were more spacious, stable and faster than typical Japanese ships. At the same time, he became very interested in the modern shipbuilding industry. In April 1876, supported by [[Matsukata Masayoshi]], the Vice Minister of Finance, who was from the same province as Kawasaki, he established Kawasaki Tsukiji Shipyard on borrowed land from the government alongside the Sumida-gawa River, Tsukiji Minami-Iizaka-chō (currently Tsukiji 7-chome, [[Chūō, Tokyo]], a major step forward as a shipbuilder.

Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. traces its origins to 1878, when Kawasaki Shōzō (川崎 正蔵) established Kawasaki Tsukiji Shipyard in Tokyo, Japan. Eighteen years later, in 1896, it was incorporated as Kawasaki Dockyard Co., Ltd.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7514">'''Leaching''' is the process of extracting substances from a [[solid]] by dissolving them in a [[liquid]], either naturally or through an [[industrial process]]. In the [[chemical process]]ing industry, leaching has a variety of commercial applications, including [[Separation technique|separation]] of [[metal]] from [[ore]] using [[acid]], and [[sugar]] from [[sugar beet]]s using hot [[water]].

Another term for this is lixiviation, or the extraction of a soluble particle from its constituent parts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Oliva P. Canencia |author2=angelo Mark P. Walag |title= Coal Combustion from Power Plant Industry Inmisamis Oriental, Philippines: a Potential Groundwater Contamination and Heavy Metal Detection |journal=Asian Journal of Microbiology, Biotechnology &amp; Environmental Sciences |volume=18 |issue=1 |year=2016 |pages=55–59 |issn=0972-3005 |url=https://www.academia.edu/24631111/Coal_Combustion_from_Power_Plant_Industry_in_Misamis_Oriental_Philippines_A_Potential_Groundwater_Contamination_and_Heavy_Metal_Detection |access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{not in citation|date=April 2016}}&lt;!-- the word "lixiviation" is not used in the referenced article --&gt;.

In a typical leaching operation, the solid mixture to be separated consists of particles, [[Chemically inert|inert]] insoluble carrier A and [[Solution|solute]]&amp;nbsp;B. The [[solvent]],&amp;nbsp;C, is added to the mixture to selectively dissolve&amp;nbsp;B. The overflow from the stage is free of solids and consists of only solvent C and dissolved&amp;nbsp;B. The underflow consists of slurry of liquid of similar composition in the liquid overflow and solid carrier&amp;nbsp;A. In an ideal leaching [[wikt: equilibrium| equilibrium]] stage, all the solute is dissolved by the solvent; none of the carrier is dissolved. The mass ratio of the solid to liquid in the underflow is dependent on the type of equipment used and properties of the two phases.

Leaching is the process by which inorganic, organic contaminants or radionuclides are released from the solid phase into the water phase under the influence of mineral [[dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]], [[desorption]], [[complexation]] processes as affected by pH, [[redox]], dissolved organic matter and (micro)[[biological activity]]. The process itself is universal, as any material exposed to contact with water will leach components from its surface or its interior depending on the [[porosity]] of the material considered.

One such reaction is:
:Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + 4NaCN → 2Na[Ag(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] + Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S

==Leaching processes for biological substances==

Many biological organic and inorganic substances occur in a mixture of different components in a solid. In order to separate the desired solute constituent or remove an undesirable solute component from the solid phase, the solid is brought into contact with a liquid. The solid and liquid are in contact, and the solute or solutes can diffuse from the solid into the solvent, resulting in separation of the components originally in the solid. This separation process is called ''liquid-solid leaching'' or simply ''leaching''. Because in leaching the solute is being extracted from the solid this is also called ''extraction''. In leaching, when an undesirable component is removed from a solid with water, the process is called ''washing''.&lt;ref name=Geankoplis&gt;{{cite book|last=Geankoplis|first=Christie|title=Transport Process and Separation Principles|year=2004|publisher=Pretence Hall|location=NJ|isbn=978-0-13-101367-4|pages=802–817}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the biological and food processing industries, many products are separated from their original natural structure by liquid-solid leaching. An important process for example is the leaching of sugar from [[sugar beet]]s with hot water. In the production of vegetable oils, organic solvents such as [[hexane]], [[acetone]], or [[ether]] are used to extract oil from nuts, beans, and seeds.

In the pharmaceutical industry, many different pharmaceutical products are obtained by leaching plant roots, leaves, and stems.&lt;ref name=Geankoplis/&gt;

==Leaching processes for inorganic and organic materials==
Leaching is extensively used in metal processing industries. The useful metal may occur in mixtures with very large amounts of undesirable constituents, and leaching is used to remove the metals as soluble salts.&lt;ref name=Geankoplis/&gt; The use of acids is prevalent in the metal processing industry. [[Sulfate]]s are normally used to remove metals from the solid phase.  These processes result in harmful sulfate-rich environmental byproducts. Because acids solubilize metals, large-scale release of heavy-metal-rich acidic mine drainage (AMD) can thereby occur.

==Shrinking-core model==
As mentioned above when leaching a solid with a liquid the desired solid goes to the liquid phase while undesired solid remains. The removal of the solid as the liquid dissolves into the particle leads to a diameter of unleached core that shrinks with time. A mathematical model can be used for this process, derived using [[Fick's law of diffusion]] taking pore diffusion as rate limiting step:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seader and Henley|first=J.D. and Ernest J.|title=Separation Process Principles|year=2001|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons inc.|location=U.K|isbn=978-0-471-46480-8|pages=639–641}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;t=\frac{\rho _Br_s^2}{6D_ebM_Bc_{A_b}} \left[ 1-3 \left(\frac{r_c}{r_s}\right)^2 + 2 \left(\frac{r_c}{r_s}\right)^3 \right]&lt;/math&gt;

==Environmentally friendly leaching==
Some recent work has been done to see if organic acids can be used to leach [[lithium]] and [[cobalt]] from spent [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] with some success. Experiments performed with varying temperatures and concentrations of [[malic acid]] show that the optimal conditions are 2.0 m/L of organic acid at a temperature of 90 °C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Li|first=Li|author2=Jing Ge |author3=Renjie Chen |author4=Feng Wu |author5=Shi Chen |author6=Xiaoxiao Zhang |title=Environmental friendly leaching reagent for cobalt and lithium recovery|journal=International Journal of Integrated Waste Management, Science and Technology|date=March 16, 2010|volume=30|series=Waste Management|issue=12|pages=2615–2621|url=http://www.journals.elsevier.com/waste-management/#description|accessdate=December 22, 2011|doi=10.1016/j.wasman.2010.08.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction had an overall efficiency exceeding 90% with no harmful byproducts.

:4 LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(solid) + 12 C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(liquid) → 4 LiC&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(liquid) + 4 Co(C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(liquid) + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(liquid) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(gas)

The same analysis with [[citric acid]] showed similar results with an optimal temperature and concentration of 90 °C and 1.5 molar solution of citric acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Li|first=Li|author2=Jing Ge |author3=Feng Wu |author4=Renjie Chen |author5=Shi Chen |author6=Borong Wu |title=Recovery of cobalt and lithium from spent lithium ion batteries using organic citric acid as leachant|journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials|date=2010-04-15|volume=176|issue=1-3|pages=288–293|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030438940901810X|accessdate=December 22, 2011|doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2009.11.026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''lead time''' is the [[:wikt:latency|latency]] between the initiation and execution of a process. For example, the lead time between the placement of an order and delivery of a new car from a manufacturer may be anywhere from 2 weeks to 6 months.

==Journalism==
Lead time in [[publishing]] describes the amount of time that a [[journalist]] has between receiving a writing assignment and submitting the completed piece.  Depending on the publication, lead times can be anything from a couple of hours to many months/years.

==Medicine==
Lead time (when referring to a disease) is the length of time between detection of a disease through screening and the moment in time where it would have normally presented with symptoms and led to a diagnosis. An example of this is seen with breast cancer population screening, where women who are asymptomatic have a positive test result with mammography, whereas the underlying disease would have taken many more years to manifest.

==Supply chain management==
A more conventional definition of lead time in the [[supply chain management]] realm is the time from the moment the customer places an order (the moment the supplier learns of the requirement) to the moment it is ready for delivery. In the absence of [[finished goods]] or intermediate (work in progress) inventory, it is the time it takes to actually manufacture the order without any inventory other than raw materials. The [[Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply]] identifies "total lead time" as a combination of "internal lead time" (the time required for the buying organisation's internal processes to progress from identification of a need to the issue of a [[purchase order]]) and "external lead time" (the time required for the supplying organisation's processes, including any [[New product development|development]] required, manufacture, despatch and delivery).&lt;ref&gt;CIPS in partnership with Profex Publishing, ''Procurement and Supply Operations'', 2012, revised 2016, pp. 64-65&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturing==
In the manufacturing environment, lead time has the same definition as that of Supply Chain Management, but it includes the time required to ship the parts from the supplier.  The shipping time is included because the manufacturing company needs to know when the parts will be available for [[material requirements planning]].  It is also possible for lead time to include the time it takes for a company to process and have the part ready for manufacturing once it has been received.  The time it takes a company to unload a product from a truck, inspect it, and move it into storage is non-trivial.  With tight manufacturing constraints or when a company is using [[Just In Time (business)|Just In Time]] manufacturing it is important for supply chain to know how long their own internal processes take.

Lead time is made of:&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.supply-chain-consultant.eu/10/lead-time-supply-chain/ ''Lead Times'']. "Lead times in supply chain" Supply Chain Consultant Website.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Preprocessing Lead Time''' (also known as "planning time" or "paperwork"): It represents the time required to release a purchase order (if you buy an item) or create a job (if you manufacture an item) from the time you learn of the requirement.
* '''Processing Lead Time''': It is the time required to procure or manufacture an item.
* '''Postprocessing Lead Time''': It represents the time to make a purchased item available in inventory from the time you receive it (including quarantine, inspection, etc.)

'''Example'''

Company A needs a part that can be manufactured in two days once Company B has received an order.  It takes three days for company A to receive the part once shipped, and one additional day before the part is ready to go into manufacturing.
*If Company A's Supply Chain calls Company B they will be quoted a lead time of 2 days for the part.
*If Company A's Manufacturing division asks the Supply Chain division what the lead time is, they will be quoted 5 days since shipping will be included.
*If a line worker asks the Manufacturing Division boss what the lead time is before the part is ready to be used, it will be 6 days because setup time will be included.

'''In more detail'''

Lead Time terminology has been defined in greater detail.&lt;ref&gt;Rajaniemi, J. (2012) [http://www.leadtimes.org/ ''www.leadtimes.org''] Lead Time Terminology in Manufacturing.&lt;/ref&gt; The Supply Chain from customer order received to the moment the order is delivered is divided into five lead times.
* '''Order Lead Time''' - Time from customer order received to customer order delivered.
* '''Order Handling Time''' - Time from customer order received to sales order created.
* '''Manufacturing Lead Time''' - Time from sales order created to production finished (ready for delivery).
* '''Production Lead Time''' - Time from start of physical production of first submodule/part to production finished (ready for delivery).
* '''Delivery Lead Time''' - Time from production finished to customer order delivered.

A restaurant opens up and a customer walks in. A waiter guides him to a table, gives him the menu and asks what he would like to order. The customer selects a dish and the waiter writes it in his notepad. At that moment the customer has made an order which the restaurant has accepted – Order Lead Time and Order Handling Time have begun. Now the waiter marks the order in the cash register, rips the paper from the notepad, takes it into the kitchen and puts into the order queue. The order has been handled and is waiting in the factory (kitchen) for manufacturing. As there are no other customers, the waiter decides to stand outside the kitchen, by the door, waiting for the dish to be prepared and begins calculating Manufacturing Lead Time.

Meanwhile, the chef finishes what he was doing, takes the order from the queue, starts his clock as a mark for the start of Production Lead Time and begins cooking. The chef chops the vegetables, fries the meat and boils the pasta. When the dish is ready, the chef rings a bell and stops his clock. At the same time the waiter stops calculating Manufacturing Lead Time and rushes through the kitchen door to get the food while it is hot.

When he picks it up, begins counting of Delivery Lead Time that ends when the dish is served to the customer, who can now happily say that the Order Lead Time was shorter than he had expected.

==Order lead time==
When talking about Order Lead Time (OLT) it is important to differentiate the definitions that may exist around this concept. Although they look similar there are differences between them that help the industry to model the order behavior of their customers. The four definitions are : 
*The '''Actual Order Lead Time ''' (OLT&lt;sub&gt;Actual&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, A. (1989). Component inventory costs in an assembly problem with uncertain supplier lead-times. IIE transactions, 21(2), 112-121.&lt;/ref&gt; The order lead-time'', refers to the time which elapses between the receipt of the customer's order (Order Entry Date) and the  '''''delivery''''' of the goods."&lt;ref&gt;Gunasekaran, A., Patel, C., &amp;  Tirtiroglu, E., 2001  "Performance measures and metrics in a supply chain environment." International journal of operations &amp; production Management 21, no. 1/2: 71-87.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The '''Requested Order Lead Time ''' (OLT&lt;sub&gt;Requested&lt;/sub&gt;) represents the time between the Order Entry Date and the customer '''''requested''''' delivery date; this measurement could help the company to understand the order behavior of the customers and help to design profitable models to fulfill customer needs.&lt;ref&gt;2)Cousens, A., Szwejczewski, M., &amp; Sweeney, M. 2009. "A process for managing manufacturing flexibility." International Journal of Operations &amp; Production Management, 29(4), pp.357-385.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Silva, L., 2013, "Supply Chain Contract Compliance Measurements" Master thesis (work in progress), Aalto University, Finland.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The '''Quote Order Lead Time ''' (OLT&lt;sub&gt;Quote&lt;/sub&gt;) is the '''''agreed'' ''' time between the Order Entry Date and the supplier’s committed deliver date of goods as stipulated in a supply chain contract.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;
*The '''Confirmed Order Lead Time''' (OLT&lt;sub&gt;Confirmed&lt;/sub&gt;) represents the time between the Order Entry Date and the by the supplier '''''confirmed''''' delivery date of goods.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;

[[Image:OLT Definitions.jpg|thumb|OLT Definitions&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;]]

=== OLT formulas ===
*OLT&lt;sub&gt;Requested&lt;/sub&gt; = Wish Date – Order Entry Date
The OLT&lt;sub&gt;Requested&lt;/sub&gt; will be determined by the difference between the date the customer wants the material in his facilities (wish date) and the date when they provided its order to the supplier. 
*OLT&lt;sub&gt;Quote&lt;/sub&gt; = Quote Date – Order Entry Date
The OLT&lt;sub&gt;Quote&lt;/sub&gt; will be determined by the difference between the date the customer agree to receive the material in their facilities (Quote date) and the date when the order is provided to the supplier.
*OLT&lt;sub&gt;Actual&lt;/sub&gt; = Delivery Date – Order Entry Date
The OLT&lt;sub&gt;Actual&lt;/sub&gt; will be determined by the difference between the day the provider deliver the material (Delivery date) and the date when they enter the order in the system. 
*OLT&lt;sub&gt;Confirmed&lt;/sub&gt; = Confirmed Date – Order Entry Date
The OLT&lt;sub&gt;Confirmed&lt;/sub&gt; will be determined by the difference between the date the confirmed date by the provider to deliver the material in the customer facilities (Confirmed date) and the date when they provide the order to the supplier.

===Average OLT based on volume===
The Average OLT based on Volume (OLT&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;) is the addition of all the multiplications between the volume of product we deliver (quantity) and the OLT divided by the total quantity delivered in the period of time we are studying for that specific facility.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;OLTV= \frac{\sum_{j}{Quantity_j \cdot OLT_j}}{_{Total Quantity Deliver}} \,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
By doing this the company will be able to find a relation of volume weighted between the quantities of material required for an order and the time requested to accomplish it. The volume metric could be applied to the 4 types of OLT. &lt;br /&gt;
The figure obtained from this calculation will be the average time (e.g. in days) between order placing and the requested delivery date of a specific customer under consideration of the average quantities ordered during that particular time.

===Potential application areas for order lead time measurement===
The correct analysis of OLT will give the company:
*Better understanding of the market behavior making it able to develop more profitable schemas that fit better with customer needs (Revenue Management).
*Increases company ability to detect and correct any behavior that is not within terms agreed in the contract (by penalization or different contract schema).  
*The OLT measurement creates an opportunity area to improve the customer relations by increasing the level of communication with them.

==Project management==
In [[project management]] lead time is the time it takes to complete a task or a set of interdependent tasks. The lead of the entire [[project]] would be the overall duration of the [[critical path method|critical path]] for the project.

Lead time is also the saved time by starting an activity before its predecessor is completed.

According to the PMI (2008), lead is a dependency between two activities (p.&amp;nbsp;140).&lt;ref&gt;PMI. (2008). A guide to a project management body of knowledge (4th. ed.). ''The Project Management Institute''. Newton Square, PA: PMI Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; An example would be scheduling the start of a 2-week activity dependent with the finish of the successor activity with a lead of 2 weeks so they will finish at the same time.

'''Leo Burnett''' (October 21, 1891 – June 7, 1971) was an [[United States citizen|American]] [[advertising]] executive and the founder of  [[Leo Burnett Worldwide|Leo Burnett Company, Inc.]]. He was responsible for creating some of advertising's most well-known characters and campaigns of the 20th century, including [[Tony the Tiger]], [[Charlie the Tuna]], the [[Marlboro Man]], the [[Maytag#Ol' Lonely|Maytag Repairman]], [[United Airlines|United]]'s "Fly the Friendly Skies", and [[Allstate]]'s "Good Hands", and for garnering relationships with [[multinational corporation|multinational]] clients such as [[McDonald's]], [[Hallmark]] and [[Coca-Cola]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CNBC Titans: Leo Burnett|url=http://www.leoburnett.com/|website=Hulu|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Burnett was named by [[Time Magazine]] as one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=March 11, 2012 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,991227,00.html |title= Time Magazine  |work= Times 100 Persons of the Century |date=June 14, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Leo Burnett was born in [[St. Johns, Michigan]], on October 21, 1891 to Noble and Rose Clark Burnett. Noble ran a dry goods store and as a young man, Burnett worked with his father, watching Noble as he designed ads for the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Star Reacher|date=1995|publisher=Leo Burnett Company, Inc.|location=Chicago, IL|page=7|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CNBC Titans: Leo Burnett|url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/296814|website=Hulu|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After high school, Burnett went on to study [[journalism]] at the [[University of Michigan]] and received his bachelor's degree in 1914.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Burnett's first job out of college was as a reporter for the Peoria ''Journal Star'' in [[Peoria, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Leo Burnett: Advertising|date=1993|publisher=Art Director's Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, he moved to [[Detroit]] and was hired to edit an in-house publication for Cadillac Clearing House, later becoming an advertising director for the same institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leo Burnett|url=http://www.top-biography.com/9129-Leo%20Burnett|website=Top Biography|accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Cadillac, Burnett met his advertising mentor, [[Theodore F. MacManus]], whom Burnett called "one of the great advertising men of all time". MacManus ran the agency that handled Cadillac's advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joan Kufrin|title=Star Reacher|date=1995|publisher=Leo Burnett Company, Inc.|location=Chicago, IL|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, Burnett married Naomi Geddes. The couple met at a small restaurant near the Cadillac offices, where Naomi worked as a cashier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joan Kufrin|title=Star Reacher|date=1995|publisher=Leo Burnett Company, Inc.|location=Chicago, IL|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; They went on to have three children: Peter, Joseph and [[Phoebe Snetsinger|Phoebe]].

During [[World War I]], Burnett joined the [[United States Navy|Navy]] for six months. However, his service was mostly spent at [[Naval Station Great Lakes|Great Lakes]] building a [[breakwater (structure)|breakwater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joan Kufrin|title=Star Reacher|publisher=Leo Burnett Company, Inc.|location=Chicago, IL|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his time in the military, Burnett returned to Cadillac for a short while. It was then when a few employees at Cadillac formed the LaFayette Motors Company – triggering Burnett to move to [[Indianapolis]] to work for the new establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leo Burnett|url=http://www.top-biography.com/9129-Leo%20Burnett|website=Top Biography|accessdate=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, he was offered a position at Homer McKee. He then left LaFayette and joined McKee, where Burnett said of the founder, "(He) gave me my first feel of what I have come to regard as the "warm sell" as contrasted to the "hard sell" and "soft sell".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joan Kufrin|title=Star Reacher|date=1995|publisher=Leo Burnett Company, Inc.|location=Chicago, IL|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was his first agency job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Denis Higgins|title=The Art of Writing Advertising: Conversations with Masters of the Craft|date=1987|location=Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After spending a decade at McKee's, and working through the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|stock market crash of 1929]], Burnett left the company. In 1930, he moved to [[Chicago]] and was hired by Erwin, Wasey &amp; Company, where he was employed for five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joan Kufrin|title=Star Reacher|date=1995|publisher=Leo Burnett Company, Inc|location=Chicago, IL|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, Burnett founded the Leo Burnett Company, Inc. in a suite at the [[Palmer House]] in downtown Chicago.&lt;ref name="CNBC Titans: Leo Burnett"&gt;{{cite web|title=CNBC Titans: Leo Burnett|url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/296814|website=Hulu|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, the operation moved to the 18th floor of the London Guarantee Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joan Kufrin|title=Star Reacher|date=1995|publisher=Leo Burnett Company, Inc.|location=Chicago, IL|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the agency has 9,000+ employees in over 85 offices globally.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In December 1967, nearing the end of his career, Burnett delivered his famous "When To Take My Name Off The Door" speech at the agency's annual holiday gathering.&lt;ref name="CNBC Titans: Leo Burnett"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When To Take My Name Off The Door|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WUxb8YB88o|website=YouTube|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, 1971, Burnett went to his agency, pledging to his colleagues to cut back to working only three days per week due to some  health problems. That evening, at the age of 79, he died of a [[heart attack]] at his family farm in [[Lake Zurich, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joan Kufrin|title=Star Reacher|date=1995|publisher=Leo Burnett Company, Inc.|location=Chicago, IL|page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CNBC Titans|url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/296814|website=Hulu|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leo Burnett Company==
A [[Privately held company|private company]] formed in 1935 and officially running under the name of '[[Leo Burnett Worldwide|Leo Burnett Company, Inc.]]', the agency started with working capital of $50,000, eight employees and three clients.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Now a part of [[Publicis|Publicis Groupe]], Leo Burnett is one of the largest agency networks with 85 offices in 69 countries and 9,000+ employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicisgroupe.com/#/en/videos/brand-videos/brand/Bartle+Bogle+Hegarty+%28BBH%29|website=Publicis Groupe|title=Publicis Groupe Showcase|accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Overview of Leo Burnett Company, Inc.|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=427231|website=Bloomberg Businessweek|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kufrin|first1=Joan|title=Leo Burnett: Star Reacher|publisher=Leo Burnett Company, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first several years, Burnett billed about $1 million annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HrBHohLC56AC&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;ots=xpxEh6Kqui&amp;dq=Burnett%20billed%20about%20$1%20million%20annually&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q=Burnett%20billed%20about%20$1%20million%20annually&amp;f=false|title=Life List: A Woman's Quest for the World's Most Amazing Birds|last=Gentile|first=Olivia|date=2009-07-01|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|year=|isbn=9781608191468|location=|page=39|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1950, billings had increased to $22 million, and by 1954 the company was at $55 million annually. By the end of the 1950s, the Leo Burnett Company was billing $100 million  annually.&lt;ref name="topbiography"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 12, 2012 |url=http://www.top-biography.com/9129-Leo%20Burnett

==Advertising techniques==
Burnett used dramatic realism in his advertising, the [[Soft sell]] approach to build brand equity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hackley|first=Chris|title=Advertising &amp; Promotion An Integrated Market Communications Approach|year=2010|publisher=Sage Publications Ltd|location=London|isbn=978-1-84920-145-2|pages=36|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burnett believed in finding the "inherent drama" of products and presenting it in advertising through warmth, shared emotions and experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ad Age Advertising Century: People: Leo Burnett|url=http://adage.com/century/people003.html|publisher=Advertising Age|accessdate=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His advertising drew from heartland-rooted values using simple, strong and instinctive imagery that talked to people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=ciaadvertising.org |editor1-first=Gerrard |editor1-last=Tellis |editor2-first=Tim |editor2-last=Ambler |title=The SAGE Handbook of Advertising |publisher=SAGE Publications |date=January 16, 2006 |pages=17–35 |chapter=1.2: A Brief History of Advertising |isbn=978-1-4129-1886-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also known for using "cultural archetypes" in his copy, by creating mythical creatures that represented American values. This is evident on such campaigns as [[Jolly Green Giant]], [[Tony the Tiger]], [[Pillsbury Doughboy]] and more famously the [[Marlboro Man]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sandra|first1=Moriarty|last2=Mitchell|first2=Nancy|last3=Wells|first3=William|title=Advertising &amp; IMC Principles and Practice|year=2012|publisher=Pearson Education Limited|location=Harlow|isbn=978-0-27-37-5292-9|pages=44|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, these campaigns played on the 1950s attitudes towards masculinity that pervaded his campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ewen|first1=Stuart|title=Leo Burnett: The Sultan of Sell|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,989783-2,00.html|website=Time|publisher=Time Inc.|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corny language===
Burnett was known for keeping a folder in the lower left-hand corner of his desk called "Corny Language".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 15, 2012 |url= http://www.longlostmarketingsecrets.com/mastermarketers/leoburnett.html 
 |title= Long Lost Marketing Secrets – Leo Burnett  |work=Peter Woodhead |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He collected words, phrases, and analogies that struck him as being particularly apt in expressing an idea.&lt;ref name="ogilvy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ogilvy|first=David|title=Ogilvy on Advertising|year=1983|publisher=Carlton Publishing Group|location=London|isbn=978-1-85375-615-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social advertising==
In 1947, Burnett wrote ''The Good Citizen'', a booklet concerning the duties and privileges of being a [[U.S. citizen]]. This was done as a public service for The [[Advertising Council]] and The [[American Heritage Foundation]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

'''Letters of assist''' refers to a [[contract]]ual document issued by the [[United Nations]] (UN) to a government authorizing it to provide goods or services to a [[peacekeeping]] or other UN operation.

==Formal definition and usage==
A contractual document issued by the United Nations (UN) to a government authorizing it to provide goods or services to a peacekeeping operation; the UN agrees either to purchase the goods or services or authorizes the government to supply them subject to reimbursement by the UN. A letter of assist typically details specifically what is to be provided by the contributing government and establishes a funding limit that cannot be exceeded. Also called LOA. See also peacekeeping.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/letter+of+assist Letters of Assist] (''The Free Dictionary'')&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contingent Owned Equipment===
LOAs are often used in conjunction with [[Contingent owned equipment|Contingent Owned Equipment]], an important aspect of many UN operations, peacekeeping or [[UN Police|police]]. As the official UN website puts it:

:''The United Nations is financially responsible for the costs of contingent deployment to the mission and arranges a commercial contract or Letter of Assist (LOA) with the contributing country to transport the equipment, either by Sea, Rail, Road, or in special circumstances by Air. LOA are like commercial contracts but are only arranged between the UN and contributing countries Governments.

The '''Logemann Family''' is a Brazilian family of northern German descent. They operate as a family enterprise, and have a full stake in Grupo SLC, a conglomerate of agroindustrial companies, one of them being [[SLC Agrícola]] , an agricultural company and land-holding corporation with properties totalling around {{convert|400000|ha|sqmi}}, which ranks the Logemann Family as the 53rd largest private landowner globally.&lt;ref name=Lovemoney&gt;{{cite web|title=The World's biggest private landowners|url=https://www.lovemoney.com/galleries/70168/revealed-the-worlds-biggest-private-landowners?page=49
|website=lovemoney.com|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family, after selling their [[John Deere]] stake in 1999, heavily invested in cotton, which placed them at the very top of global production. &lt;ref name=IstoéDinheiro&gt;{{cite web|title=Os Novos Reis do Algodão|url=https://www.istoedinheiro.com.br/noticias/negocios/20040406/novos-reis-algodao/17418|website=istoedinheiro.com.br|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All family members live in [[Porto Alegre]], the capital of Brazil's southern-most state [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. According to ''[[Forbes]]'' in 2014, the family shares a 3 billion-dollar empire divided between 19 blood members.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Complete List Of the 150 Richest of Brazil|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andersonantunes/2014/09/18/the-complete-list-with-the-150-richest-people-in-brazil/#28dd34ac7968|website=Forbes.com|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family has kept away from media attention, valuing discretion above all else.

== Business Activities==

The Logemann family began its business activities with Frederico Jorge Logemann, who founded Schneider &amp; Logemann Cia LDTA. This company had a humble shop that repaired and manufactured agricultural tools for the village. Upon  development, the company began producing their own threshers.&lt;ref name="SLC"&gt;{{cite web|title= Historia da SLC|url=http://www.slc.com.br/?page_id=4
|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jorge Antonio Dahne Logemann then took control upon his father's death, and began development of automotive harvesting machines, being the first of the Southern Hemisphere to ever produce one. Mr. Jorge Logemann then founded [[SLC Agrícola]] in 1977 (now the family's main business) and in 1979 he merged SLC with [[John Deere]] for a [[Joint venture]] in Brazil.&lt;ref name="SLC"&gt;{{cite web|title= Historia da SLC|url=http://www.slc.com.br/?page_id=4
|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, Mr. Jorge Antonio Logemann passes away, and his two sons Eduardo and Jorge Luis took leadership of the family's businesses. In 1999, Eduardo and Jorge sell SLC &amp; John Deere back to the John Deere group, and exit the business of tool and machine fabrication.&lt;ref name="SLC"&gt;{{cite web|title= Historia da SLC|url=http://www.slc.com.br/?page_id=4
|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the family issues shares of [[SLC Agricola]] in [[B3 (stock exchange)]], which allowed [[SLC Agrícola]] to become one of the 10 most important company of [[Rio Grande do Sul]].&lt;ref name="SLC"&gt;{{cite web|title= Historia da SLC|url=http://www.slc.com.br/?page_id=4
|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the family sold one of their businesses, Ferramentas Gerias, to Grupo OVD for an undisclosed amount.&lt;ref name="Amanha"&gt;{{cite web|title= Paranaense OVD anuncia compra da Ferramentas Gerais|url=http://www.amanha.com.br/posts/view/4835|website=amanha.com.br|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable Members==
'''Frederico Jorge Logemann''', German engineer from [[Bremen]], founds in 1927 the village of Belo Horizonte, today's [[Horizontina]]. In 1945 he and his partner Balduíno Schneider found Schneider &amp; Logemann Cia LTDA, focused in the fabrication and maintenance of agricultural tools. Two years after, the company constructed its first thresher. Mr. Logemann passed away in 1947, after which his only son, Jorge Antonio Dahne Logemann, continued his work.&lt;ref name=SLC&gt;{{cite web|title=Grupo SLC|url=http://www.slc.com.br/?page_id=4|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zaira Logemann''', who passed away in 2017, was the oldest member of the family since 1987, belonging to the second generation. She was married to Jorge Antonio Logemann, the member responsible for the creation of SLC and the joint venture with John Deere in 1977. Mrs. Zaira has also been at the forefront of a construction for a new hospital wing in Porto Alegre, which now take on her name. &lt;ref name=Yooying&gt;{{cite web|title=Voluntárias Pela Vida|url=https://www.yooying.com/p/1639147107415163015|website=yooring.com|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eduardo Logemann''', eldest son of Zaira, is the current chairman of the family's companies. He is connected to seven different boards, and served as vice president of [[Federação das Indústrias do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul]].&lt;ref name="Federação das Indústrias do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eduardo Silva Logemann Executive Profile|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=36508873&amp;privcapId=35016821|website=bloomberg.com|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Gerard Lowry''' (born 13 March 1953) is an Irish [[Independent politician|Independent]] politician who has served as a [[Teachta Dála]] (TD) since 1987, currently for the [[Tipperary (Dáil constituency)|Tipperary]] constituency. He previously served as [[Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport|Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications]] from 1994 to 1996 and [[Fine Gael|Chairman of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party]] from 1993 to 1994.&lt;ref name=oireachtas_db&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;HouseNum=30&amp;MemberID=645&amp;ConstID=171|title=Mr. Michael Lowry|work=Oireachtas Members Database|accessdate=27 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lowry is a former Chairman of the [[Fine Gael]] party and was [[Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport|Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications]] between 1994 and 1996. He resigned from his ministry in some controversy. [[Fine Gael]] barred him from standing for the party again. Thereafter he ran as an [[Independent politician|Independent]] candidate and has maintained his seat in the Dáil ever since. The [[Moriarty Tribunal]] concluded "beyond doubt" that Lowry was a [[Tax evasion|tax evader]] and had assisted businessman [[Denis O'Brien]]'s [[Esat Digifone licence controversy|Esat Digiphone]] consortium in acquiring a lucrative mobile phone licence in the mid-1990s, during Lowry's time as Communications Minister. O'Brien went on to become one of the richest men in Ireland.&lt;ref name="RTÉ-Moriarty-findings"/&gt;

Lowry initiated a [[defamation]] lawsuit against an ''[[Irish Independent]]'' journalist, Sam Smyth, over an article that Smyth had written regarding the Moriarty Tribunal as well as comments that Smyth made on a [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]] show. The lawsuit was thrown out of several courts and Lowry was ordered to pay Smyth's legal costs. More recently his relationship with Kevin Phelan has come under scrutiny, with the emergence of [[Lowry Tapes|a recorded conversation]] in which Lowry claims to have made an undeclared payment of €250,000.

Despite being the subject of a criminal investigation resulting from several scandals pursuing him from his time in office, he continues to be very popular in his constituency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Lynch|url=http://www.herald.ie/national-news/if-hed-been-more-careful-he-could-now-be-taoiseach-2590894.html|title=If he'd been more careful, he could now be Taoiseach|newspaper=[[Evening Herald]]|date=23 March 2011|accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Lowry was born in [[County Tipperary]] and educated at [[Thurles]] CBS. He was elected to [[North Tipperary County Council]] in 1979. In the early 1980s he was a [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] administrator, and was the youngest-ever Chairman of the [[Tipperary GAA]] Board.&lt;ref name=IT-still-topping-polls&gt;{{cite news|first=Colm|last=Keena|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/0323/1224292846826.html|title=Still topping polls despite frequent falls from grace|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|date=23 March 2011|accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He runs a commercial refrigeration business, Streamline Enterprises, that he founded in controversial circumstances in 1988.&lt;ref name=IT-still-topping-polls/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://streamlineenterprises.ie/|title=Streamline Enterprises: Streamline Enterprises are market leaders in Refrigeration, Air Conditioning and HVAC solutions: Welcome to Streamline Enterprises Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, as chairman of the [[Semple Stadium]] Development Committee, he was involved in raising the necessary funds for the refurbishment of the stadium in preparation for the All-Ireland Centenary Hurling final in 1984.&lt;ref name=IT-still-topping-polls/&gt;

==National politics==
Lowry was first elected to [[Dáil Éireann]] as a [[Fine Gael]] TD for [[Tipperary North (Dáil constituency)|Tipperary North]] at the [[Irish general election, 1987|1987 general election]] and in 1993 he became Chairman of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party.

In 1994 he was appointed [[Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport|Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications]] in the [[24th Government of Ireland|Rainbow Coalition]] government.

A succession of political scandals pursued Lowry throughout his time in office. These included [[Esat Digifone licence controversy|allegations of irregularities]] relating to the granting of a mobile phone licence to [[BT Ireland|Esat Telecom]], which were later investigated by the [[Moriarty Tribunal]], plans for the [[Luas|Dublin Light Rail System]] and the closure of rural post offices. The 1997 [[McCracken Tribunal]] revealed supermarket tycoon [[Ben Dunne (entrepreneur)|Ben Dunne]] had paid IR£395,000 for an extension to Lowry's home in Tipperary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sam|last=Smyth|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/sam-smyth-the-twobit-politician-who-committed-daylight-robbery-2590520.html|title=The two-bit politician who committed daylight robbery|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]] |date=23 March 2011|accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tribunal concluded that Lowry had evaded tax.

This allegation prompted Lowry's resignation from the Cabinet in November 1996. Taoiseach [[John Bruton]] announced that Lowry would not be allowed to stand as a Fine Gael candidate at the next election, and he resigned from the party.

Lowry announced that he would stand as an independent candidate in the [[Irish general election, 1997|1997 general election]]. He topped the poll in his constituency in that election, and did so again in the [[Irish general election, 2002|2002]] and [[Irish general election, 2007|2007]] general elections.&lt;ref name=elecs_irl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=3737|title=Michael Lowry|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=27 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lowry is backed by a strong local organisation in Tipperary, known informally as "Team Lowry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Eimear|last=Ni Bhraonain|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/its-the-personal-touch-that-earns-such-a-loyal-following-2595420.html|title=It's the personal touch that earns such a loyal following|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]|date=26 March 2011|accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lowry was re-elected to represent Tipperary North at the [[Irish general election, 2011|2011 general election]], heading the poll on the [[PRSTV|1st count]] with 14,010 votes.&lt;ref name="2001_elecs"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/election2011/results/tipperary-north.html |title=Tipperary North |accessdate=26 February 2011 |publisher=RTÉ News |date=28 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228221747/http://www.rte.ie/news/election2011/results/tipperary-north.html |archivedate=28 February 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected again, for [[Tipperary (Dáil constituency)|Tipperary]], at the [[Irish general election, 2016|2016 general election]]. He voted for [[Enda Kenny]] as Taoiseach on 6 May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstalk.com/election2016/Enda-Kenny-Taoiseach-Cabinet-Dail-votes-Independents|title=Enda Kenny is re-elected as Taoiseach in the Dáil|work=Newstalk|date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after [[Ceann Comhairle]] [[Seán Ó Fearghaíl]] confirmed the result, Lowry was seen to offer a handshake to Kenny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.carlow-nationalist.ie/2016/05/06/video-enda-kenny-elected-taoiseach-after-day-of-drama/|title=KENNY ELECTED TAOISEACH, SHANE ROSS REVEALS APPOINTMENT TO TRANSPORT MINISTRY|work=Carlow Nationalist|date=6 May 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513202632/http://www.carlow-nationalist.ie/2016/05/06/video-enda-kenny-elected-taoiseach-after-day-of-drama/|archivedate=13 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business interests==
Lowry has directorships listed with the Companies Registration Office. He has two roles with Garuda Ltd, a manufacturer of electric domestic appliances; Abbeygreen Consulting, which involves construction work and special trades; and Gdlc Business Consultants Ltd., a business and management consultancy registered in Dublin. He also has an unlimited company called Glebeland Farm, which manages his bloodstock and livestock interests.&lt;ref name=examiner-sale-of-wedding-morn-foal&gt;{{cite news|first=Conor|last=Ryan|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/lowrys-stock-rises-with-sale-of-wedding-morn-foal-215661.html|title=Lowry's stock rises with sale of Wedding Morn foal|newspaper=Irish Examiner|date=1 December 2012|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lowry had some success with horse racing as a quarter-partner in the MALM partnership, but has in recent times taken to flat-race breeding.&lt;ref name=examiner-sale-of-wedding-morn-foal/&gt;

Lowry owned a horse called "Wedding Morn", though the price he paid for the horse is not known. The horse was covered by Coolmore's "[[Danehill Dancer]]", from the stable of [[John Magnier]]. He would have paid up to €75,000 to have the horse covered. Another horse, "Probably", was sold by Lowry, which was the progeny of Wedding Morn. Wedding Morn was delivered of three foals including Probably, and the three were sold for a total of €410,000 by Lowry between 2009 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Conor|last=Ryan|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/archives/2012/0711/world/lowry-has-1m-reasons-to-be-happy-200396.html|title=Lowry has €1m reasons to be happy|newspaper=Irish Examiner|date=11 July 2012|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lowry sold Wedding Morn in 2012 for €361,849.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Conor|last=Ryan|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/lowrys-bloodstock-secures-813k-215991.html|title=Lowry's bloodstock secures €813k|newspaper=Irish Examiner|date=5 December 2012|accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moriarty Tribunal: investigation and results==
One of the remits of the [[Moriarty Tribunal]], which sat from 1997 to 2011, was the investigation of payments to Lowry. In early 2007 Lowry announced that he had made a full and final settlement of all outstanding payments with the [[Revenue Commissioners]] in response to the findings concerning his tax evasion. His company Garuda had to pay €1.2 million after a Revenue audit. He also paid almost €200,000 to settle his personal taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Fintan|last=O'Toole|authorlink=Fintan O'Toole|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2009/0421/1224245071062.html|title=A country still in thrall to the likes of Lowry|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=21 April 2009|accessdate=27 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011 the second and final report from the Moriarty Tribunal found that, during his time as Communications Minister, Michael Lowry assisted businessman [[Denis O'Brien]]'s consortium Esat Digiphone in acquiring a lucrative mobile phone licence in the mid-1990s which ultimately made O'Brien one of the richest men in Ireland.&lt;ref name="RTÉ-Moriarty-findings"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0322/moriarty_background.html|title=Lowry helped O'Brien get mobile licence|work=[[RTÉ News]]|date=22 March 2011|accessdate=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It concluded "beyond doubt" that Lowry gave what it termed "substantive information to Denis O'Brien, of significant value and assistance to him in securing the licence".&lt;ref name="RTÉ-Moriarty-findings"/&gt; The Tribunal report found that Lowry, displayed "an appreciable interest" in the process and had "irregular interactions with interested parties at its most sensitive stages".&lt;ref name="RTÉ-Moriarty-findings"/&gt; It also found that one of Lowry's interventions, which cut the selection process to the advantage of Esat, was "disgraceful" and "insidious", and that he had misled the Government, his party leader [[John Bruton]] and his own civil servants to influence the selection process in Esat's favour.&lt;ref name=Indo-lowry-disgrace&gt;{{cite news|first=Shane|last=Phelan|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/lowrys-disgrace-2590572.html|title=Lowry's disgrace|work=Irish Independent|date=23 March 2011|accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tribunal also found that Lowry sought to procure unwarranted rent increases that over a seven-year period would have benefited businessman Ben Dunne. Lowry sought to influence the outcome of an arbitration being conducted in 1995 in relation to the rent payable by the then state-owned [[Telecom Éireann]] for Marlborough House to a company owned and controlled by Dunne. The report said that the matter was "profoundly corrupt to a degree that was nothing short of breathtaking".&lt;ref name="RTÉ-Moriarty-findings"/&gt;

The report also summarised the cumulative payments made to Lowry, and says "In aggregating the known payments from Denis O'Brien to Michael Lowry, it is apposite to note that, between the granting of the second GSM licence to Esat Digiphone in May 1996, and the transmission of £420,000 sterling to complete the purchase of the latter of Lowry's English properties in December 1999, O'Brien had made or facilitated payments to Lowry of £147,000 sterling, £300,000 sterling and a benefit equivalent to a payment in the form of O'Brien's support for a loan of £420,000 sterling."&lt;ref name="RTÉ-Moriarty-findings"/&gt;

Lowry had addressed the Dáil saying that if he had been trying to hide a lot of money he would have "put it in an offshore account", implying that no such account existed. The Tribunal found that he actually had at least four such accounts that he used for the purpose of evading tax, and had not disclosed these accounts to the previous McCracken Tribunal.&lt;ref name=IT-still-topping-polls/&gt;

Lowry rejected the Moriarty report, claiming that it was flawed and that the assumptions and conclusions that Justice Moriarty arrived at were totally baseless.&lt;ref name=Indo-lowry-disgrace/&gt; Nonetheless the [[Criminal Assets Bureau]] and the Bureau of Fraud were called in on 29 March 2011 to begin investigating his finances, since his €1.4 million settlement with the revenue commissioners did not grant him immunity from prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0329/lowrym.html|title=CAB investigating Michael Lowry finances|work=RTÉ News|date=29 March 2011|accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 March 2011, following the [[Moriarty Tribunal|Moriarty Report]]'s publication, the Dáil passed an all-party motion calling on Lowry to voluntarily resign his seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0331/moriarty.html#videol|title=Lowry Motion passed without vote|work=RTÉ News|date=31 March 2011|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Lowry v. Sam Smyth''==
In 2010 Lowry launched a [[defamation]] lawsuit against ''[[Irish Independent]]'' journalist Sam Smyth, over an article Smyth had written regarding the Moriarty Tribunal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/tribunal-will-reveal-findings-on-money-trail-to-exminister-2196088.html|title=Tribunal will reveal findings on money trail to ex-minister|newspaper=Irish Independent|date=27 May 2010|accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as comments Smyth had made on a [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]] show describing Lowry as having been "caught with his hand in the till."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/0210/breaking19.html|title=Lowry loses High Court action|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=10 February 2012|accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smyth defended the defamation claim, stating he "did not call Michael Lowry TD a thief, but did believe he was a liar and a tax cheat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/1218/1224285836003.html|title=Journalist says he called TD a tax cheat not a thief|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=12 December 2010|accessdate=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lowry's defamation lawsuit was thrown out in the Circuit court,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/1006/lowrym_smyths.html|title=Sam Smyth awarded legal costs against Lowry|work=RTÉ News|date=6 October 2011|accessdate=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again on appeal to the High Court.&lt;ref name=rte-high-court-dismisses-lowry&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/0210/lowrym.html|title=High Court dismisses Lowry defamation appeal|work=RTÉ News|date=10 February 2012|accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; High Court Justice Nicholas Kearns noted that Lowry "did not dispute that he engaged in tax fraud",&lt;ref name=rte-high-court-dismisses-lowry/&gt; and ordered Lowry to pay Smyth's legal costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Dearbhail|last=McDonald|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/a-good-day-for-journalism-as-lowry-loses-libel-appeal-3016622.html|title='A good day for journalism' as Lowry loses libel appeal|newspaper=Irish Independent|date=11 February 2012|accessdate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Undeclared land interest==
It emerged in October 2012 that Lowry owned land in Wigan which he had failed to declare in his register of members' interests. Between 2001 and 2003 the 25-acre site had been owned by Liam Carroll and Vineacre Ltd, a UK property company owned by him and Lowry. Vineacre Ltd was removed from the title in 2003 and Lowry declared his Vineacre interest until the company was dissolved in 2008. The land then became Lowry's and Carroll's in their own names, but he failed to declare his interest from 2008 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Conor|last=Ryan|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/links-between-lowrys-worthless-wigan-land-and-deals-probed-by-moriarty-215576.html|title=Links between Lowry's 'worthless' Wigan land and deals probed by Moriarty|newspaper=Irish Examiner|date=30 November 2012|accessdate=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 November 2012 Lowry amended his declaration to the [[Oireachtas]] to include the land interest, despite claiming previously that the land was "worthless". An unprecedented 380 complaints were made by members of the public in relation to the scandal, partly prompted by an article written by author Elaine Byrne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/lowry-may-face-standards-probe-after-380-complaints-3312122.html|title=Lowry may face standards probe after 380 complaints|newspaper=Sunday Independent|date=2 December 2012|accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Elaine|last=Byrne|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/stop-giving-out-about-lowry-and-make-an-official-complaint-instead-3281694.html|title=Stop giving out about Lowry and make an official complaint instead|newspaper=Sunday Independent|date=4 November 2012|accessdate=4 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to rules, the property must be worth more than €13,000 to be declared an interest. Lowry claimed the complaints were part of an "orchestrated campaign" against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Brennan|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/public-inquiry-to-examine-lowrys-land-share-in-uk-3309789.html|title=Public inquiry to examine Lowry's land share in UK|newspaper=Irish Independent|date=29 November 2012|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2012 the probe into Lowry's failure to declare the land interest had been transferred to the Standards in Public Office Commission (SIPO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Conor|last=Ryan|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/archives/2012/1129/world/lowryaposs-uk-land-interest-to-be-probed-215450.html|title=Lowry's UK land interest to be probed|newspaper=Irish Examiner|date=29 November 2012|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with Kevin Phelan==
{{further information|Lowry Tapes}}
In March 2013 Northern Ireland land scout Kevin Phelan revealed that Lowry had made payments to him in 2002, of which only half had been disclosed to the [[Moriarty Tribunal]]. The ''Sunday Independent'' released a secret recording of a telephone conversation made by Phelan, in which Lowry asks for nothing to be revealed about the payment to the tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Colm|last=Keena|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/payment-from-michael-lowry-was-part-of-agreement-says-land-scout-1.1330321|title='Payment from Michael Lowry was part of agreement, says land scout'|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=19 March 2013|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also broadcast on ''[[Tonight with Vincent Browne]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tv3.ie/article.php?article_id=98152 |title=Lowry tape broadcast |work=TV3 News |date=15 March 2013 |accessdate=15 March 2013 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/michael-lowry-kevin-phelan-conversation-833051-Mar2013/|title=Gardaí examining Lowry tape as conversation is aired on national TV: Independent TD Michael Lowry can be heard making reference to a £250,000 payment which he said he never declared|work=TheJournal.ie|date=15 March 2013|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, it was announced that Lowry has launched [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] proceedings against [[Independent News &amp; Media|INM]] in relation to the tapes.

==Tax affairs==
Lowry availed himself of the Tax Amnesty in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/politics/td-availed-of-1993-last-chance-tax-amnesty-29450040.html|title=TD availed of 1993 'last chance' tax amnesty|date=6 July 2006|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made a settlement with the Revenue again in 2003. In 2007 he paid a settlement of €192,000 which was due to the emergence of secret payments to him by businessman [[Ben Dunne (entrepreneur)|Ben Dunne]]. His company Garuda Limited made a settlement of €1.1m in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/michael-lowrys-firm-in-11m-tax-settlement-26417152.html|title=Michael Lowry's firm in 1.1m tax settlement|date=8 October 2006|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 he faced five charges, including knowingly completing incorrect tax returns on a number of dates between 2003 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2007/0925/93931-tax/|title=Michael Lowry to face trial in Dublin Circuit Court|date=5 December 2015|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 he was found guilty on one of the charges, relating to a €372,000 payment received in 2002 but not recorded until 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=O'Donnell |first1=Orla |title=Lowry guilty of filing incorrect corporation tax return |url=https://www.rte.ie/news/courts/2018/0626/973306-michael-lowry-court/ |accessdate=26 June 2018 |work=RTE.ie |date=26 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State board appointments lobbying==
In January 2015 it was revealed that he lobbied Taoiseach Enda Kenny to have his female former press adviser reappointed to a State board. Lowry passed a note to the Taoiseach in the Dáil chamber asking him to consider re-appointing Valerie O'Reilly, who runs her own successful public relations agency, to the board of the National Transport Authority (NTA). The note read "Taoiseach, would you please consider re-appointing Valerie O'Reilly to the board of the NTA. A woman, bright, intelligent and not bad looking either!" Her initial appointment by the previous government in March 2010 provoked charges of cronyism. The incident came just three months after Kenny and Fine Gael were engulfed in another cronyism scandal involving John McNulty and the [[Irish Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Daniel|last=McConnell|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/politics/exclusive-exminister-passes-note-to-taoiseach-seeking-crony-appointment-30934975.html|title=Ex-minister passes note to Taoiseach seeking 'crony' appointment|work=Sunday Independent|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The then [[Fianna Fáil]] senator [[Averil Power]] expressed surprise at the tone of the note and said: "She probably does have strong business credentials, but to be referred to in this ''[[Father Ted]]'' 'lovely girls' sort of way is every women's worst nightmare. It also shows that we need far greater transparency when it comes to State board appointments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Connolly|first1=Shaun|title=Lovely girls' note embroils Taoiseach in controversy|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/lovely-girls-note-embroils-taoiseach-in-controversy-308932.html|work=Irish Examiner|accessdate=27 January 2015|date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lowry was also revealed to have lobbied Minister for Transport [[Paschal Donohoe]] on the same matter. Donohoe told journalists at UCD that he had been "briefly" approached by Lowry. Lowry himself confirmed he had spoken to Donohoe in the Seanad chamber's anteroom. "I had been following a debate on a health-related issue in the Seanad and, out of courtesy, I informed Mr Donohoe, when I met him, that I had sent a note to the Taoiseach on the reappointment" claimed Lowry. When asked to respond to media coverage of the affair, Lowry said: "It is a load of nonsense and, frankly, more irritating than anything else."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Regan|first1=Michael|title=Independent TD responds to reappointment controversy|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/oireachtas/reaction-to-note-political-correctness-gone-mad-lowry-1.2080477|work=The Irish Times|accessdate=27 January 2015|date=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Naguib Onsi Sawiris''' ( or ''Sawires'', [[Egyptian Arabic]]: "نجيب اُنسـي ساويرس ", {{IPA-arz|næˈɡiːb ˈʔonsi sæˈwiːɾɪs|IPA}} or {{IPA-arz|sæˈwiːɾes|}}; born 17 June 1954) is an Egyptian [[billionaire]] businessman. Sawiris is chairman of [[Weather Investments]]'s parent company, and chairman of [[Orascom Telecom Holding|Orascom Telecom Media and Technology Holding S.A.E]].

==Early life==
Naguib Sawiris is the eldest of three brothers. His brothers are [[Nassef Sawiris]] and [[Samih Sawiris]]. He is the son of [[Onsi Sawiris]] who established the Orascom Group.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Education==
Sawiris holds a diploma of Mechanical Engineering with a Masters in Technical Administration from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zürich) and a Diploma from the German Evangelical School, [[Cairo]], Egypt.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Career==
Since joining Orascom, the family business in 1979, Sawiris has contributed to the growth and diversification of the company into what it is today one of Egypt’s largest and most diversified conglomerates and the country’s largest private sector employer. Sawiris established and built the railway, information technology, and telecommunications sectors of Orascom. The success of these ventures as well as the other sectors of the company led to the management’s decision to split Orascom into separate operating companies in the late 90s: Orascom Telecom Holding (OTH), [[Orascom Construction Industries]] (OCI), Orascom Hotels &amp; Development and Orascom Technology Systems (OTS).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

As the founder of OTH, Sawiris has led the growth of the company, culminating in the merger deal between [[Wind Telecom]], the parent company of [[Orascom Telecom Holding]] and [[VimpelCom Ltd.]] in April 2011. At the time, the merger created the world’s sixth largest mobile telecommunications provider by number of subscribers with operations in 20 countries serving 181 million customers. As part of the merger deal, Sawiris spun off [[Orascom Telecom]]’s non-gsm operations and Egyptian-based telecom assets into Orascom Telecom Media and Technology Holding of which he is chairman.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Sawiris led the acquisition of La Mancha Resources Inc through a tender offer launched by Weather Investments II. La Mancha Resources Inc. is an international gold producer based in Canada with operations, development projects and exploration activities in Africa, Australia and Argentina. In August 2012, Sawiris was appointed chairman.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

'''''OpenCity''''' is a [[free and open-source software]] 3D [[city-building game]] started in 2003 by France-based Vietnamese programmer Duong-Khang Nguyen. The game mechanics are similar to [[Simcity]],&lt;ref name="chip"/&gt; while the game developers don't strive to make it a direct Simcity [[Video game clone|clone]].

== Gameplay ==
In the game, the player builds a city by marking land as commercial, industrial or residential zones. Those zones depend on each other to grow. The player is also required to supply the city with power and connect the different zones by building roads.

==Origins and development==
'''''OpenCity''''' is the product of programmer Duong-Khang Nguyen and 3D artist Frédéric Rodrigo. Nguyen was inspired by the open source game ''FreeReign''; when he realized that the ''FreeReign'' project was [[Abandonware|abandoned]] and the [[source code]] was not in the condition to be improved, he began development on his own city-building simulator.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100625040648/http://linux.softpedia.com/get/GAMES-ENTERTAINMENT/Simulation/Open-City-10890.shtml Open City 0.0.6.1] on [[Softpedia]] (archived, June 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The work in project started in 2003 with the registration on [[Sourceforge]].&lt;ref name="sourceforge"&gt;[https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencity/ opencity] on sourceforge.net&lt;/ref&gt; OpenCity is [[Free and open-source software]] due to the [[Software license|licensing]] as [[GPLv2]].&lt;ref name="sourceforge"/&gt; Contributions to the game came from the game's community in form of translation and quality testing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opencity.info/en/Credits.html Credits] on the OpenCity website&lt;/ref&gt; OpenCity is built on cross platform libraries and APIs like [[Simple DirectMedia Library]] and [[OpenGL]], which allows [[Source port|porting]] to various OSes and platforms, like [[Windows]], [[OS X]]&lt;ref name=macobserver&gt;[http://www.macshareware.com/review/opencity OpenCity 0.0.6] on Macshareware.com (August 24, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; and many [[Linux distribution]]s.&lt;ref name="ubunutu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fedora"/&gt;&lt;ref name="debian"/&gt;

Latest stable release branch is 0.0.62 with updates from 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[https://sourceforge.net/p/opencity/code/HEAD/tree/branches/0.0.6/ HEAD/tree/branches/0.0.6/] on [[sourceforge.net]]&lt;/ref&gt; while the unstable development branch 0.0.7 has updates until 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sourceforge.net/p/opencity/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/opencity/ HEAD/tree/trunk/opencity/] on [[sourceforge.net]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception == 
OpenCity achieved a broad spread as [[free and open-source]] and [[freeware]] video game,&lt;ref name=macobserver/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerbild.de/download/OpenCity-2255175.html OpenCity] on [[computerbild.de]] (May 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; and was downloaded directly from [[Sourceforge]] between 2003 and May 2017 over 190,000 times according to the SF download statistic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencity/files/stats/timeline?dates=2003-04-23+to+2017-07-16 opencity - stats] on [[sourceforge.net]] (May 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; OpenCity was also directly integrated in many [[Linux distribution]]s: [[Fedora (linux distribution)|Fedora]],&lt;ref name="Fedora"&gt;[http://rpms.remirepo.net/rpmphp/zoom.php?rpm=opencity Package: opencity] on rpms.remirepo.net&lt;/ref&gt; [[Debian]],&lt;ref name="debian"&gt;[https://packages.debian.org/search?searchon=sourcenames&amp;keywords=opencity opencity] on packages.debian.org&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arch Linux]], [[SUSE Linux|SuSE]], [[Slackware]], [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]],&lt;ref name="ubunutu"&gt;[https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/precise/opencity/ OpenCity] on apps.ubuntu.com&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pardus (operating system)|Pardus]], [[Frugalware]]. ''OpenCity'' has been reviewed as "well made 3D [[Video game remake|remake]]" of SimCity by [[Chip.de]] in 2013.&lt;ref name="chip"&gt;[http://www.chip.de/downloads/OpenCity_23170816.html OpenCity 0.0.6.2] on [[Chip.de]] ''"OpenCity ist ein liebevoll gemachtes 3D-Remake des Spiele-Klassikers SimCity aus dem Jahre 1989."''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6743">The '''person-centered systems theory''' (German: Personzentrierte Systemtheorie) is a multi-level concept for the understanding of processes in [[psychotherapy]], [[counseling psychology|counseling]], [[coaching]] and [[clinical psychology]] under consideration of the interrelation of different levels – namely body, psyche, interpersonal and social processes. The concept has been developed by the German [[psychologist]] and [[psychotherapist]] [[Jürgen Kriz]].

Person-centered systems theory focuses on the necessity to reduce the incomprehensible complexity of (physical-chemical) [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] by means of developing meaningful structures, patterns and rules in order to create a comprehensibly simple [[lifeworld]]. In this context, the question of stability as well as adaptive transition of the patterns is essential. Moreover, the historic perspective plays an important role because it provides the only access to an understanding of cultural patterns of explanation, metaphors, narrations as well as principles of reasoning. Here, Kriz introduces the term 'meaning [[attractor]]' (German: Sinnattraktor), which he describes as reduction of the vast possibilities of understanding and communication providing certainty and stability while limiting change, adaptation and creativity. Accordingly, it is an essential objective of person-centered systems theory to explain the effects of psychotherapy – and clinical processes in general – across various methods and schools of thought.

The [[Systems theory|systems theoretical]] (meta-) perspective of the person-centered systems theory refers to the systems-theoretical concepts of [[Gestalt psychology]] as well as humanistic psychotherapy ([[Carl Rogers]]' person-centered approach in particular) on the one hand and the relations to modern interdisciplinary [[systems theory]] (especially concepts of [[self-organization]] and [[Synergetics (Haken)|synergetics]]) on the other.

Contrary to the common systems approach in psychotherapy – as in [[systemic therapy (psychotherapy)|systemic]] and [[family therapy]] -, person-centered systems theory does not primarily focus on patterns of interactions and communication respectively but it takes into account the individual (the person in the sense of person-centered psychotherapy) as well as the underlying somatic processes and the cultural embedding of meaning processes. After all, central aspects like [[sense]], mind, [[Meaning (psychology)|meaning]] or [[Coherence theory of truth|coherence]] are related to the level of personal processes – even if these are substantially affected in their biographical and historical dynamic by social processes. A [[social system]] can define and/or prescribe something as meaningful – however, experiencing it as something meaningful is an intrinsic process of that person (first person perspective).

According to the model of synergetics, the patterns at each process level can be stable (for a given time) or show phase transitions. The former comes along with the positive aspects of predictability, familiarity and security, but the negative aspects of rigidity, solidification and non-adaptation. The latter is experienced as leaving old and inadequate patterns behind in order to reach new and better adapted ones. This has the positive aspects of novelty, creativity and uniqueness, but the negative aspects of instability, uncertainty and chaos. In the life-course of individuals, couples, families, groups and organizations, both phases of stability and of pattern transitions are necessary. Many symptoms and problems are related to over-stabilization of patterns, which have been good solutions to some requirements but are no longer adequate or functional due to the fact that the requirements have changed.

The person-centered systems theory describes the systemic effects of communication between humans (couples, families, organizations) as well as their interrelations through internal processes (perception, thinking, feeling) in its complex, non-linear interaction both [[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up and top-down]].

Kriz (2017) provides a comprehensive presentation and discussion of the person-centered systems theory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7304">'''Product data management''' ('''PDM''') or [[Product information management|Product information management (PIM)]] is the business function often within [[product lifecycle management]] (PLM) that is responsible for the management and publication of [[Product (business)|product]] data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npd-solutions.com/pdm.html Product Data Management/Product information management], Kenneth Crow&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ivica Crnkovic, Ulf Asklund, Annita Persson Dahlqvist "Implementing and Integrating Product Data Management and Software Configuration Management" {{ISBN|978-1580534987}}&lt;/ref&gt; In software engineering, this is known as [[version control]]. The goals of product data management include ensuring all stakeholders share a common understanding, that confusion during the execution of the processes is minimized, and that the highest standards of quality controls are maintained.

== Introduction ==
Product data management is the use of software or other tools to track and control data related to a particular product. The data tracked usually involves the technical specifications of the product, specifications for manufacture and development, and the types of materials that will be required to produce goods. The use of product data management allows a company to track the various costs associated with the creation and launch of a product. Product data management is part of product lifecycle management and [[configuration management]], and is primarily used by engineers.

Within PDM the focus is on managing and tracking the creation, change and archive of all information related to a product. The information being stored and managed (on one or more file servers) will include engineering data such as [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) models, drawings and their associated documents.

Product data management (PDM) serves as a central knowledge repository for process and product history, and promotes integration and data exchange among all business users who interact with products — including project managers, engineers, sales people, buyers, and quality assurance teams.

The central database will also manage [[metadata]] such as owner of a file and release status of the components. The package will: control check-in and check-out of the product data to multi-user; carry out [[Change management (engineering)|engineering change management]] and release control on all versions/issues of components in a product; build and manipulate the product structure [[bill of materials]] (BOM) for assemblies; and assist in configurations management of product variants.

This enables automatic reports on product costs, etc. Furthermore, PDM enables companies producing complex products to spread product data into the entire [[product lifecycle management|PLM]] launch-process. This significantly enhances the effectiveness of the launch process.

Product data management is focused on capturing and maintaining information on products and/or services through its development and useful life.  Typical information managed in the PDM module include
*Brand name
*Part number
*Part description
*Supplier/vendor
*Vendor part number and description
*Unit of measure
*Cost/price
*Schematic or CAD drawing
*Material data-sheets

==Advantages==

* Track and manage all changes to product related data
* Spend less time organizing and tracking design data
* Improve productivity through reuse of product design data
* Enhance collaboration
* Helps using visual management

== Industrial Applications ==
Product Data Management is closely related and often used interchangeably with Product Information Management (PIM).  PDM software applications are commonly used by companies involved with manufacturing and retailing. Examples of PDM software vendors include CMPRO,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://psasys.com/cmpro/|title=CMPRO - PSA, Inc.|work=PSA, Inc.|access-date=2017-11-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; SOLIDWORKS,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.solidworks.com/sw/products/product-data-management/packages.htm|title=Packages|website=www.solidworks.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zentail&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.zentail.com|title=Sell on Jet.com, Walmart, Amazon, eBay, Google Shopping {{!}} Zentail|website=www.zentail.com|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bintime/Gepard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bintime.com|title=BINTIME provides a e-commerce development team, dedicated to your business goals|website=bintime.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Apart from those providers, in the market exist other kind of vendors that offer [https://saleslayer.com/product-data-management-pdm PDM systems] with extra functionalities such as Sales Layer.

== History ==

PDM stems from traditional engineering design activities that created product drawings and schematics on paper and using CAD tools to create parts lists (Bills of Material structures – BOM).  The PDM and BOM data is used in enterprise resource planning ([[enterprise resource planning|ERP]]) systems to plan and coordinate all transactional operations of a company (sales order management, purchasing, cost accounting, logistics, etc.)

PDM is a subset of a larger concept of product lifecycle management ([[product lifecycle management|PLM]]).  PLM encompasses the processes needed to launch new products ([[New product introduction|NPI]]), manage changes to existing products ([[engineering change notice|ECN]]/[[Engineering change order|ECO]]) and retire products at the end of their life ([[End-of-life (product)|EoL]]).

Robert Carter was born at [[Corotoman|Corotoman Plantation]] in [[Lancaster County, Virginia]], to John Carter (1613–1669) of London, England, and Sarah Ludlow (1635–1668) of Maiden Bradley, [[Wiltshire]]. In 1688, he married Judith Armistead of Hesse in [[Gloucester County, Virginia|Gloucester County]], an area which was included in the formation of [[Mathews County, Virginia|Mathews County]] in 1691.&lt;ref name="FHCC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christchurch1735.org/history/robert_carter.html |title=History: Robert "King" Carter of Corotoman (1663-1732) |first= |last= |author=Foundation for Historic Christ Church |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |month= |year= |work=Historic Christ Church |publisher=Historic Christ Church |location=Lancaster County, Virginia |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans-title=|doi= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031017121816/http://www.christchurch1735.org/history/robert_carter.html|archivedate=2003-10-17|accessdate=22 December 2010 |quote= |ref= |separator= |dead-url=yes |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her death in 1699, he married Elizabeth Landon in 1701.

At age 28, Robert Carter entered the [[General Assembly of Virginia]] as a Burgess from Lancaster County, serving five consecutive years. In 1726, as President of the [[Governor's Council]], he served as acting [[Governor of Virginia]] after the death of Governor [[Hugh Drysdale]].

As an agent of [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]] – known simply as Lord Fairfax – he served two terms as agent for the [[Fairfax Proprietary]] of the [[Northern Neck]] of Virginia. During his first term, 1702–1711, he began to acquire large tracts of land for himself in the [[Rappahannock River]] region of Virginia. Carter acquired some {{convert|20000|acre|km2}}, a large part of which was the {{convert|6000|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Nomini Hall Plantation]], also spelled "Nomoni" or "Nominy," which he purchased in 1709 from the heirs of Col. [[Nicholas Spencer]], cousin of the [[Baron Colepeper|Lords Culpeper]], from whom the Fairfaxes had inherited their Virginia holdings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bFTkr8xU930C&amp;pg=PA447|title=The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography|author=|date=19 April 2018|publisher=Virginia Historical Society.|accessdate=19 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he became representative of Fairfax's interests again in 1722, serving from 1722–32, he secured for his children and grandchildren about {{convert|110000|acre|km2}} in the Northern Neck, as well as additional land in Virginia west of the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]].

Carter died on 4 August 1732, in [[Lancaster County, Virginia]], and was buried there at [[Christ Church (Lancaster)|Christ Church]]. He left his family 300,000 acres (1,200&amp;nbsp;km²) of land, 1,000 slaves and 10,000 British pounds in cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://members.tripod.com/~Bonestwo/index-17.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20081015141450/http://members.tripod.com/~Bonestwo/index-17.html |archivedate=15 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
When Lord Fairfax saw Carter's obituary in the London monthly ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'', he was astonished to read of the immense personal wealth acquired by his resident land agent. Rather than name another Virginian to the position, Fairfax made arrangements to have his cousin, Colonel William Fairfax, move to Virginia to act as land agent, with the paid position of customs inspector (tax collector) for the Potomac River district. Fairfax himself then visited his vast Northern Neck Proprietary from 1735–37, and he moved there permanently in 1747.

Currently, he is the CEO of [[With Honor]], a new movement led by veterans focused on building a cross-partisan coalition of next-generation veterans in the [[United States Congress]] in order to help fix our America's broken, hyper-polarized politics.

==Background and early life==
Barcott was born in Rhode Island. His father attended [[Miami University]] on an [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] scholarship and went on to serve in the Marines' [[3rd Reconnaissance Battalion]] during the [[Vietnam War]].

His parents met as graduate students at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. Barcott's mother is a nurse and anthropologist who teaches at the [[University of Rhode Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.uri.edu/nursing/meet/donna-schwartz-barcott-ph-d-r-n/ |title=Professor Donna Schwartz-Barcott URI profile|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barcott initially applied to the [[United States Naval Academy]] but was turned down.

While an undergraduate at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|UNC]] in 2001, Barcott founded [[Carolina for Kibera]] (CFK) in Kenya with Salim Mohamed and Tabitha Atieno Festo. CFK started as a small inter-ethnic soccer program and medical clinic run out of Festo's ten-by-ten foot shack. Today it is a major affiliated entity of the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. More than 5,000 youth participate in its holistic youth programs, and the Tabitha Clinic treats more than 20,000 patients a year in collaboration with the [[U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smartglobalhealth.org/blog/entry/cdc-carolina-for-kibera-tabitha-health-clinic/ Center For Strategic and International Studies, The Commission on Smart Global Health Policy, August 10, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Double Time Capital===
Barcott co-founded Double Time Capital in 2013 as an impact investment firm focused on clean energy and sustainability. As of February 2017, "Double Time has financed 36 solar energy projects, which collectively produce roughly 10% of North Carolina's solar power and power around 30,000 homes in the state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Quittner|first1=Jeremy|title=These Marines Beat the Odds to Build a Solar Energy Fund|url=http://fortune.com/2017/02/22/marines-solar-energy-fund/|website=Fortune.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, North Carolina was the second ranked state in the United States based on the cumulative amount of solar electric capacity installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=North Carolina Solar|url=https://www.seia.org/state-solar-policy/north-carolina-solar|website=SEIA.org|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''September 11 National Day of Service and Remembrance''' or '''9/11 Day''' is a federally-recognized day of unity and charitable service, annually observed throughout the United States and in other countries around the world on the anniversary of the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]]. It has grown to become the largest annual day of charitable service in the United States.

==Background==

According to the nonprofit MyGoodDeed, which founded the September 11 National Day of Service and Remembrance ("9/11 Day") in 2002, the goal of "9/11 Day" is "to keep alive the spirit of unity and compassion that arose in the immediate aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]] in tribute to the individuals lost and injured in the attacks, and the many who rose in service in response." The idea of making September 11 an annual day of service was first conceived in the winter of 2001 by David Paine, a former marketing executive from New York City. In the Spring of 2002 David was joined by his friend Jay Winuk, who had lost his brother Glenn Winuk in the attacks at the World Trade Center, and together they formed the nonprofit group called One Day's Pay. In 2007, the name of the organization was officially changed to MyGoodDeed. In 2009, MyGoodDeed successfully led an effort to designate September 11 under federal law as a National Day of Service and Remembrance, which occurred as part of passage of the bipartisan Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act by the [[United States Congress]], and later, by an amendment to the Patriot Day [[Presidential Proclamation]] by President Barack Obama, which formally recognized and established September 11 as a National Day of Service and Remembrance. The Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act authorized the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), a federal agency, to assist the 9/11 community in building awareness of and support for "9/11 Day" through its national service programs. In 2011, on the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, MyGoodDeed, CNCS and the Points of Light Institute/HandsOn Network joined together to organize the largest day of charitable service in U.S. history, with more than 32 million Americans participating, according to research conducted by Horizon Consumer Science on behalf of MyGoodDeed. Today, 9/11 Day continues to engage nearly 30 million Americans annually in various forms of charitable service, including volunteering, donations to charities, and simple good deeds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://911day.org/about/ About Us], 911day.org, published by MyGoodDeed, accessed July 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serve.gov/?q=site-page/september-11th-national-day-service-and-remembrance|September 11th National Day of Service and Remembrance], serve.gov, published by the Corporation for National and Community Service, accessed July 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pointsoflight.org/signature-events/911-day-service-and-remembrance/2011|9/11 Day of Service and Remembrance 2011], pointsoflight.org, published by the Points of Light Foundation, accessed July 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

Activities by volunteers on this federally-recognized National Day of Service and Remembrance happen all across the nation, and include lesson plans that engage tens of thousands of students of all ages in service activities; coast-to-coast blood drives; meal packing projects; painting and refurbishing homes; food drives; reclaiming neighborhoods; helping communities prepare for disasters; and countless other activities that support and honor those lost and injured on 9/11; veterans, soldiers, military families, and rescue and recovery workers, including first responders. Among the largest projects held annually are two large-scale hunger relief projects, one in New York City and another at the National Mall in Washington, DC, which mobilize a total of more than 7,000 volunteers who together pack over two million meals for individuals at risk of hunger. In Boston, thousands join together on 9/11 at the Rose Kennedy Greenway to assemble care packages for military personnel.  Participants are encouraged to use the [[hashtag]] #911Day when posting online about the day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serve.gov/?q=site-page/september-11th-national-day-service-and-remembrance|September 11th National Day of Service and Remembrance], serve.gov, published by the Corporation for National and Community Service, accessed July 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ysa.org/act/programs/911day/ 9/11 Day of Service &amp; Remembrance], ysa.org, published by Youth Service America, accessed July 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Volunteers Honor 9/11 Victims By Helping Others On National Day Of Service|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/09/11/volunteers-honor-911-victims-by-helping-others-on-national-day-of-service/|accessdate=2 December 2012|newspaper=CBS New York|date=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996''' is an amendment to the [[Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act]], a law governing the management of marine [[fisheries]] in the [[United States]]. Another major amendment to this legislation was later made under the ''Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006''. The SFA was enacted to amend the outdated MSFCMA of 1976. The amendment included changes to the purpose of the act, definitions, and international affairs, as well as many small changes.

The U.S. Senate [[Bill (law)|bill]] S. 39 was passed by the 104th United States Congressional session and enacted into law by the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|42nd President of the United States]] Bill Clinton on October 11, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=52088 |title= William J. Clinton: "Statement on Signing the Sustainable Fisheries Act," October 11, 1996 |author1=Peters, Gerhard |author2=Woolley, John T |publisher = University of California - Santa Barbara |work= The American Presidency Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
There were several major changes to the purpose of the law: 
# Prohibiting fisheries managers from using social, economic, or any other justifications to allow catch targets to exceed a calculated "maximum sustainable yield."
# Mandating that for each managed species, fisheries managers quantitatively define "[[overfishing]]" (certain specified maximum allowed rates of fishing mortality) and "overfished" (depletion below a certain population level).
# Mandating regular assessment of which fish populations that are overfished, and creating an official list of overfished species in U.S. waters.
# Mandating that for overfished species, plans must be enacted allowing them to recover to quantitatively specified target population levels (usually about one-third of the estimated pre-fishing population) within ten years (with certain exceptions).
# Adding that catches of unintended species or unmarketable fish be reduced, to the extent practicable.
# Adding the promotion of protection of "Essential Fish Habitat."
# Adding the promotion of catch and release programs to conservation and management principles.

==Definitions==
The following terms which became relevant in the twenty years following the original act were added:
* [[bycatch]]
* charter fishing
* [[commercial fishing]]
* economic [[discards]]
* essential fish habitat
* [[fishing community]]
* [[individual fishing quota]]
* optimum yield
* [[overfishing]] (overfished)
* Pacific Insular Area
* [[recreational fishing]]
* regulatory discards
* special areas
* vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States

==International affairs==
Besides establishing the Pacific Insular Area fishery agreement regulations, the SFA directs the Secretary of State to "seek to secure an international agreement to establish standards and measures for bycatch reduction that are comparable to the standards and measures applicable to United States fishermen."

{{Taxation}}

The '''Tax Justice Network''' (or '''TJN'''), is an independent [[advocacy group]] consisting of a coalition of international researchers and activists with a shared concern about [[tax avoidance]], [[tax competition]], [[tax evasion]], and [[tax havens]].  It has a particular focus on [[offshore financial centres]] that behave as [[corporate tax haven]]s.
The Tax Justice Network gathers organizations, social movements, and advocates for international tax cooperation, and against tax evasion and tax competition. TJN's goal is to achieve progressive, democratic, and socially just tax systems. It carries out campaigns from an internationalist perspective whose purpose is to develop a fiscal system that is favourable to the poor in developing and developed countries, that finances public good, and that mitigates public wrongs such as pollution and unacceptable inequality.

==Foundation and growth==
TJN grew out thank to the process of the global social forum and the international movement of [[ATTAC]]. TJN is a multilingual, non-partisan, non-governmental, plural and diverse network. It has as members and militants’ organizations of social movements and national, regional and local civil society, as well as activists for justice in taxes, researchers, journalists, development specialists, trade unionists, and professionals of taxation, politicians and officials.

[[Civil Society]] is progressively committing itself to the issues of capital flight, tax evasion and tax fraud and competition, which are generally seen as obstacles to the mobilization of national resources in developing countries. In June 2000, one of the main NGOs dedicated to development published a report titled Tax Havens: “Unlocking the hidden billions to eradicate poverty”. The creation of the Tax Justice Network was in part a consequence of the publication of that report. In the United States, the Citizens for Tax Justice Organization has undertaken a similar effort, although with a national focus. On the contrary, TJN focuses primarily on the international level.

Since 2000, ATTAC, which was born in France in support of the called Tobin tax, has become a movement of international pressure that faces the problems of tax fraud, financial crime and the abuse of tax havens. In April 2005, ATTAC-Spain asked the Government not to recognize the fictitious and instrumental companies registered in tax havens before the Spanish legal system. And ATTAC-Germany played a decisive role in the creation of Tax Justice Network, whose diffusion is spreading in the Spanish-speaking countries.

Until recently, international fiscal policy was hardly a field for civil campaigns, as can be demonstrated by an example. In June 2003, the G8 meeting in Evian summoned 300,000 demonstrators in Geneva, 3,000 people registered to pressure the delegates and Geneva came to a standstill. In December 2003 the UN Committee of Fiscal Experts met in Geneva and TJN was the only civil society organization that attended and intervened in the meeting.

==Functions and objectives.==
The main purpose is to combat the lobbying activities of accounting, business or law organizations that use considerable amounts of time and money to ensure favourable tax treatment for wealthy individuals and powerful organizations that shape their customers. 
Other functions of TJN:

* Conducts campaigns for social change through public debate and education. Public understanding of tax issues is the pre-requirement for international tax justice. The Network makes information available through the media as well as through conferences and seminars, the Internet, news bulletins, printed publications, symbolic actions, demonstrations and promotion and defense of its objectives. We base our activities on solvent research and expert knowledge.

* Facilitates cooperation among its members and sharing information and communication. It organizes international exchange and policy debates to harmonize the opinions and concerns of our members. This process forms the basis for the comprehensive global campaigns on international fiscal policy.

==Management== 
 
It is managed by its member organizations as well as by individual militants. It ensures the visibility of member organizations in their activities and participation in the decision-making of the Network. It operates in accordance with the principles of participatory democracy, its empowerment, transparency, accountability and equal opportunities. TJN encourages and supports, when necessary, member organizations and individuals to participate in decision making. The Network supports the development of national TJN campaigns, particularly in developing countries. The activities of the Network are coordinated by an international secretariat. 
The Network includes:
* national, regional and local civil society (specially important)
* development organizations and several NGOs
* religious groups
* unions
* researchers 
* journalists
* economists
* financial professionals

==Empirical results==

In March 2005, TJN published the results of an investigation that demonstrated $ 11.5 million of the personal wealth of wealthy individuals held in offshore financial centers. In addition, to minimize taxes or to avoid paying them, a large proportion of this wealth is managed in about 70 tax havens. If the income from this wealth patrimony will pay the taxes in the countries where these rich individuals reside or where they obtain their wealth, the additional tax collection available for the financing of public services and for investment in the whole world would be around 255,000 million of annual dollars. We emphasize that this estimate of the loss of tax revenues does not include the tax evasion of transnational corporations or the reduction of tax revenues caused by tax competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Price of Offshore|url=http://www.taxjustice.net/cms/upload/pdf/Price_of_Offshore.pdf|publisher=Tax Justice Network|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TJN has reported on the OECD [[Base erosion and profit shifting]] (BEPS) projects and conducted their own research that the scale of corporate taxes being avoided by multinationals is an estimated $660bn in 2012 (a quarter of US multinationals’ gross profits), which is equivalent to 0.9% of World GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bna.com/tax-avoidance-costing-n57982085579/| title=Tax Avoidance Costing U.S. $189 Billion: Tax Justice Network| publisher=Bloomberg News | date=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.taxjustice.net/scalebeps/ | title=Base Erosion and Profit Shifting BEPS| publisher=Tax Justice Network | date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In July 2012, following a study into wealthy individuals with offshore accounts, the Tax Justice Network published claims regarding deposits worth at least $21 trillion (£13 trillion), potentially even $32 trillion, in secretive tax havens. As a result, governments suffer a lack of income taxes of up to $280 billion.&lt;ref name="TOI"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international-business/13-trillion-pounds-in-offshore-tax-havens-report/articleshow/15093725.cms | title=13 trillion pounds in offshore tax havens: Report | publisher=The Times of India | date=July 22, 2012 | accessdate=July 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/07/22/uk-offshore-wealth-idUKBRE86L03W20120722?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=topNews | title=Super rich hold $32 trillion in offshore havens | publisher=Reuters | date=July 22, 2012 | accessdate=July 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18944097 | title=Tax havens: Super-rich 'hiding' at least $21tn | publisher=BBC | date=July 22, 2012 | accessdate=July 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tim Maia''' ({{IPA-pt|tʃĩ majɐ}}; September 28, 1942 – March 15, 1998), born '''Sebastião Rodrigues Maia''' in [[Rio de Janeiro]] city, was a Brazilian musician, songwriter and businessman known for his iconoclastic, ironic, outspoken, and humorous musical style. Maia contributed to [[Brazilian music]] within a wide variety of musical genres, including [[soul music|soul]], [[funk]], [[bossa nova]], [[disco]], [[Ballads#Sentimental ballads|romantic ballads]], pop, rock, [[jazz]], [[baião (music)|baião]] and [[Música popular brasileira|MPB]]. He introduced the soul style on the Brazilian musical scene. Tim Maia is internationally recognised as one of the biggest icons of the Brazilian music.

Tim Maia recorded numerous albums and toured extensively in a long career. After his early death in 1998, his recorded oeuvre has shown enduring popularity. A theatrical retrospective of his career, the popular musical ''Vale Tudo'', was first staged in Rio de Janeiro in 2012.

==Biography==

===1950s===
Maia was born in the [[Tijuca]] neighbourhood, in the southern suburbs of Rio de Janeiro. He began writing melodies while still a child, the second youngest of nineteen children. Then known as "Tião Maia", he wrote his earliest songs at age eight. At fourteen, as a drummer, he formed the group Os Tijucanos do Ritmo, which lasted one year. He then took guitar classes and was soon teaching other children in Tijuca. He also gave lessons to his friends Erasmo Esteves and [[Roberto Carlos (singer)|Roberto Carlos]], fellow members of the so-called Matoso Gang. Named after the street where they used to hang out, the gang also included [[Jorge Ben Jor|Jorge Ben]] and [[Erasmo Carlos]], among others. They liked to listen to the earliest styles of [[rock and roll]], with both Maia and Ben being nicknamed "Babulina" after their enthusiastic pronunciation of [[Ronnie Self]]'s song "Bop-A-Lena".&lt;ref name=noites/&gt;

In 1957, Maia, Carlos, Arlênio Silva, Edson Trindade and Wellington started the vocal group The Sputniks. After a televised appearance on [[Carlos Eduardo Imperial|Carlos Imperial]]'s ''Clube do Rock'' on [[TV Tupi]], Imperial arranged a solo appearance for Roberto Carlos the following week. Maia got annoyed at this, leading him to insult Carlos in the following rehearsals until his bandmate left the group. After watching Carlos' concert the following week, Maia left The Sputniks, and went after Imperial for a solo appearance. Imperial eventually suggested another artistic name, Tim, which Maia accepted with reservations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Nelson |last=Motta|title=Vale Tudo – O som e a fúria de Tim Maia|publisher=Objetiva|language=pt|year=2007|isbn=9788573028744|pages=29–32|location=Rio de Janeiro|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, Maia went to study in the United States, where he lived for four years. He joined a vocal harmony ensemble, The Ideals, and wrote the lyrics to "New Love", which was recorded as a demo with guest percussion by a young [[Milton Banana]].&lt;ref name="Seabrook"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Seabrook |first=John |authorlink=John Seabrook |date=January 28, 2013 |title=Tarrytown Boy |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |publisher=Condé Nast |page=23 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2013/01/28/130128ta_talk_seabrook |accessdate=November 16, 2013 }}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Maia also recorded the song as a soloist in 1973).&lt;ref name="Seabrook"/&gt; The group's career was derailed in 1963 when Maia was arrested for possession of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and deported back to Brazil.&lt;ref name=noites/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seabrook"/&gt;

===1960s===
After returning, Maia had a few unsuccessful jobs and arrests in Rio. Eventually he decided to move to São Paulo to try to get help to kickstart his musical career from Carlos, who was beginning to enjoy the massive success of [[Jovem Guarda]] with Esteves. Carlos was inaccessible, but Maia started to perform in São Paulo's nightlife and in [[Wilson Simonal]]'s radio program, and also had a televised appearance at [[TV Bandeirantes]] with [[Os Mutantes]]. By the end of 1967 Maia managed to send a homemade recording to Carlos, who got Maia a deal for a single at [[Columbia Records|CBS]] and an appearance on the ''Jovem Guarda'' TV program. His first single in 1968, "Meu País" backed by "Sentimento", went unnoticed, as was another single, "These Are the Songs"/"What Do You Want to Bet?", recorded in English for RGE Discos. Maia also wrote one of Carlos' hits, "Não Vou Ficar".&lt;ref&gt;Motta (2007), pp. 54–71&lt;/ref&gt; He became more visible after 1969 when he launched his "These Are the Songs," which was re-recorded by [[Elis Regina]] in the next year in a duo with Maia. Maia managed a deal with [[Polydor]]/[[Philips Records|Philips]] and recorded the successful single "Primavera".&lt;ref&gt;Motta (2007), pp. 77–79&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
[[File:Tim Maia no Teatro Opinião.tif|left|thumb|Tim Maia, 1972. [[Brazilian National Archives|National Archives of Brazil.]]]]
In the 1970s, Maia started to record albums and perform shows promoting his synthesis of American [[Soul music|soul]] and Brazilian music with elements of [[samba]] and [[baião (music)|baião]]. The movement gradually took the working-class suburbs of the north side of Rio de Janeiro, exploding in 1976 with the black movement.

In 1970, Maia recorded his first full-length LP, ''Tim Maia'', which included the classics "Azul da Cor do Mar", "Coroné Antônio Bento", and "Primavera", and topped the charts for 24&amp;nbsp;weeks in Rio de Janeiro. His first four albums were all self-titled. Next year's ''Tim Maia'' had other hits including "Não Quero Dinheiro (Só Quero Amar)" and "Preciso Aprender a Ser Só". His fourth album, released in 1973, included "Réu Confesso" and "Gostava Tanto de Você". Angry at how the [[music publisher (popular music)|music publisher]] distributed the royalties, Maia opened his own, Seroma (derived from the first syllables of his first, middle and last names), to make sure he had a bigger cut of the profits.&lt;ref&gt;Motta (2007), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

After his fourth album, Maia left Polydor for [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]], who offered him a chance to record a double album. The instrumental parts were all ready when Maia went to his composing friend Tibério Gaspar for help with the lyrics. In his house Maia found the book ''Universo em Desencanto'' (Disenchanting Universe), revolving around the cult of Rational Culture.&lt;ref&gt;Motta (2007), p. 127-9&lt;/ref&gt; Maia converted to the cult, abandoned the drugs and red meat, and decided to write the lyrics for the songs about the knowledge contained in the book. RCA rejected the albums ''Tim Maia Racional, Vols. 1 &amp; 2'' for the newly found spiritual content, but Maia bought the [[master tape]]s from them and released the albums independently through label Seroma Discos, which would split its profits with the cult. While the lead single "Que Beleza (Imunização Racional)" had some airplay, at the time these records were not well received, due to inadequate distribution, and the spiritual content alienating both the radios and Maia's fans. Eventually, the artist could only perform at events promoted by the Rational Culture. Eventually in 1975, Maia got fed up with the cult, destroyed the unsold records and went back to his carefree life.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, Russ. [https://web.archive.org/web/20100712192434/http://www.soundsandcolours.com/articles/brazil/tim-maias-journey-into-rational-culture/ "Tim Maia's Journey into Rational Culture"] Sounds and Colours, July 7, 2010. Retrieved on 2014-11-05&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Motta (2007), p. 132-143&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Racional'' albums are now regarded as classics and saw re-release in 2005.

For his return in 1976, Maia signed with [[Polygram]] and recorded an album also titled ''Tim Maia'', which included the hit "Rodésia" (inspired by the [[Rhodesian Bush War]]), and also did a self-published album in English.&lt;ref&gt;Motta (2007), p. 146-156&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 Maia signed with [[Som Livre]], where he recorded the album ''Verão Carioca''.&lt;ref&gt;Motta (2007), p. 160-1&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978 Maia signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]] and incorporated the [[disco]] sound of the period in the album ''Tim Maia Disco Club'', which spawned the hits "Sossego" and "Acenda o Farol".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=November 28, 2001|title=Tim Maia Disco Club, Tim Maia (WEA) |journal=[[Veja (magazine)|Veja]]|publisher=[[Editora Abril]]|format=0100-7122|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/idade/estacao/veja_recomenda/281101/tim_maia.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Motta (2007), p. 165-7&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 Maia recorded ''Reencontro'' for [[EMI|EMI-Odeon]], but revolted at the label's estimated promotion costs which were the same as the money spent recording, Maia fought with the marketing executive, and in response EMI president fired Maia, releasing the album with no publicity to low sales.&lt;ref&gt;Motta (2007), p. 173-5&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s and 1990s===
In 1980, Maia recorded another self-titled album for Polygram. The following year, with turbulent passages through all the major labels in Brazil, Maia released again through Seroma the album ''Nuvens'', which flopped due to inefficient distribution. To earn cash for his future albums, Maia was a guest in songs by [[Fevers]], [[Edu Lobo]] and [[Chico Buarque]], [[Ivan Lins]] and [[Sandra de Sá]]. His collaboration with Sá, "Vale Tudo", later became a solo hit for Maia.&lt;ref&gt;Motta (2007), p. 184-189&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1983 he had hits with "O Descobridor dos Sete Mares" and "Me Dê Motivo", included on ''O Descobridor dos Sete Mares'' (Polygram). Another milestone of his career in the 1980s was ''Tim Maia'' (1986), which had the hit "Do Leme ao Pontal (Tomo Guaraná, Suco de Caju, Goiabada Para Sobremesa)".

In 1990, Maia saw [[Caetano Veloso]]'s [[songbook]] and asked editor [[Almir Chediak]] to do one for his own work. Chediak was working on such an album with [[bossa nova]] classics, and Maia requested a copy, which eventually inspired him to do a self-released album of bossa nova covers, ''Tim Maia Interpreta Clássicos da Bossa Nova''.&lt;ref&gt;Motta (2007), p. 286-9&lt;/ref&gt; After a period of poor presence in the media, he was again on top after being mentioned by Jorge Ben Jor's "W/Brasil" in 1991. In the same period, Maia had another hit with his re-recording of [[Lulu Santos]]' "Como uma Onda" for a television advertisement – Santos in return recorded Maia's "Descobridor dos Sete Mares.

At the same time, he withdrew from majors, recording his next albums through Vitória Régia, including ''What a Wonderful World'' (1997), where he recorded American pop/soul classics, and ''Amigos do Rei/Tim Maia e Os Cariocas'', with the famous vocal group. Obese and in bad health, in March 8, 1998 he was performing at the Municipal Theater of [[Niterói]] when he became ill. He was hospitalized and died a few days later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.uol.com.br/JC/_1998/1603/br1603b.htm Tim Maia morre aos 55 anos, no Rio], ''Jornal do Commercio''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
[[File:Leomaia.JPG|thumb|Léo Maia, Tim's adoptive son, also became a musician.]]
Tim Maia had two sons: Carmelo Maia (also known as Telmo, b. 1975) with Geisa Gomes da Silva, and José Carlos da Silva Nogueira (1966–2002). He was also the surrogate father of Geisa's other son, Marcio Leonardo "Léo" Maia (b. 1974).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estadao.com.br/arquivo/cidades/2002/not20020422p16837.htm Polícia começa a investigar assassinato de filho de Tim Maia], ''[[O Estado de S. Paulo]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Léo was registered by Tim as his son, although he knew that Léo was not his child, since he met his wife Geisa when she was already pregnant. She had been separated from her boyfriend, who refused to recognize Léo as his child.&lt;ref&gt;Motta (2007), pp. 127–8&lt;/ref&gt; Tim and Geisa started living together but they broke up after a few arguments. When they made up, she was pregnant with Carmelo. Tim registered Carmelo and married her. When Léo Maia was 12, Tim Maia and Geisa divorced.

Maia lived in the United States of America from 1959 to 1963. He first resided [[Tarrytown, New York]], with the family of an acquaintance of Maia's father's costumer. There he learned English and did not speak much Portuguese because so few Brazilians were living in the USA at the time. In 1961, Maia moved to New York City, and in 1963 with a group of three friends decided to travel to Southern United States. With a stolen car and performing small thefts to finance the journey (which got him arrested five times), Maia and friends travelled through nine states before arriving in Florida. In [[Daytona Beach]], Maia had his final imprisonment for marijuana possession, which earned him deportation back to Brazil.&lt;ref name=vt2&gt;Motta (2007), pp. 40–51&lt;/ref&gt;
 		 	
Tim Maia became a member of the [[Brazilian Socialist Party]] (''Partido Socialista Brasileiro – PSB'') in October 1997.&lt;ref name="Luc"&gt;{{pt icon}} Lucena, Pierre. [http://acertodecontas.blog.br/atualidades/biografia-de-tim-maia-o-livro-mais-divertido-do-ano/ "Biografia de Tim Maia é o livro mais divertido do ano"]. Acerto de Contas. December 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He was rumoured to have joined the party in order to run for a seat in the [[Senate of Brazil|Federal Senate]] for [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] in the [[Brazilian general election, 1998|1998 general elections]], but died before that.&lt;ref name="Luc" /&gt; When asked by a reporter why he chose to join the then small PSB, he replied: "''Brazil is the only country where – in addition to whores cumming, pimps being jealous and drug dealers being addicted – poor people vote for the right-wing''".&lt;ref name="Luc" /&gt; His phrase would become a famous [[aphorism]] on the way Brazilians face politics.&lt;ref name="Luc" /&gt;

He was also known his easygoing lifestyle, and for his habit of lightheartedly missing appointments and even important gigs.&lt;ref name=noites&gt;{{cite book|last=Motta|first=Nelson|authorlink=Nelson Motta|title=Noites Tropicais|publisher=Objetiva|year=2001|location=Rio de Janeiro |language=pt |isbn=85-7302-292-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Maia had a tradition of arriving late at concerts, at times missing them altogether. He also frequently complained about the sound quality in them. Many of his missed concerts were due to what he called his "triathlon", consuming [[whiskey]], [[cocaine]] and [[marijuana]] before a gig.&lt;ref name=veja&gt;[http://veja.abril.com.br/141107/p_178.shtml 140 quilos de som e transgressão] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025042938/http://veja.abril.com.br/141107/p_178.shtml |date=October 25, 2012 }}, ''[[Veja (magazine)|Veja]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In the end of his life, Tim Maia suffered from many health problems which included diabetes, acute hypertension, obesity and pulmonary embolism. In 1996, he had a [[Fournier gangrene]] solved through an emergency operation.&lt;ref&gt;Motta (2007), pp.364–5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and homages==
[[File:Caricatura Tim Maia - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Caricature Tim Maia.]]
After his death, Maia was the subject of numerous tributes by [[Música popular brasileira]] artists; two lavish commemorations in 1999 and 2000 were each released on CD and DVD. A biography, ''Vale Tudo – O Som e a Fúria de Tim Maia'', was published in 2011 by one of Maia's personal friends, [[Nelson Motta]].&lt;ref name=veja/&gt; Motta later worked with [[João Fonseca]] on a stage version of the book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rioshow.oglobo.globo.com/teatro-e-danca/eventos/tim-maia-vale-tudo-o-musical-5084.aspx|title=Tim Maia – Vale tudo, o musical|author=|date=August 8, 2011|work=[[O Globo]]|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; – their musical retrospective ''Tim Maia: Vale Tudo'' began a successful theatrical run in Rio de Janeiro in 2012.&lt;ref name="Seabrook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohter"&gt;{{Cite news |title=He's Back, Baby: The Man Who Put the Funk in Rio |author=Rohter, Larry |authorlink=Larry Rohter |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 19, 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/21/arts/music/tim-maia-brazilian-singer-is-in-resurgence.html?_r=0 |accessdate=November 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film adaptation ''[[Tim Maia (film)|Tim Maia]]'' based on the book was released in 2014.&lt;ref name="Seabrook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/1161001-filme-sobre-tim-maia-saira-em-2014-apos-atraso-na-producao.shtml Filme sobre Tim Maia sairá em 2014, após atraso na produção], ''[[Folha de S.

In 2004, Som Livre released an album of posthumous duets entitled ''Soul Tim: Duetos''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cliquemusic.uol.com.br/discos/ver/soul-tim-duetos|title=Soul Tim Duetos|author=Silvio Essinger|date=|publisher=CliqueMusic|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maia's entire discography, including the never before seen third volume of ''Tim Maia Racional'', was reissued by [[Editora Abril]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colecaotim.com.br/todasnoticias.php Coleção Tim Maia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102042054/http://www.colecaotim.com.br/todasnoticias.php |date=November 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012, American record label [[Luaka Bop]] released a Maia compilation entitled ''Nobody Can Live Forever.''&lt;ref name="Seabrook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohter"/&gt;

In January 2001, [[Guns N' Roses]] guitarist [[Robin Finck]] sang "Sossego" during the [[Rock In Rio|Rock in Rio III]] festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cliquemusic.uol.com.br/br/Cybernotas/Cybernotas.asp?Nu_materia=1483 Rock In Rio: Guns'N'Roses toca Tim Maia]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, [[TV Globo]] recorded a special program about Maia, ''Por Toda a Minha Vida'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Rede Globo]]'', [http://memoriaglobo.globo.com/Memoriaglobo/0,27723,GYN0-5273-258725,00.html "Por toda a Minha Vida"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323112256/http://memoriaglobo.globo.com/Memoriaglobo/0,27723,GYN0-5273-258725,00.html |date=March 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2009, Globo had an episode of its show ''Som Brasil'' with Maia's songs, performed by his son Léo and [[Seu Jorge]] among other artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvglobo.sombrasil.globo.com/som-brasil/category/tim-maia/ Os bastidores do Som Brasil Tim Maia]&lt;/ref&gt; [[TV Cultura]] (São Paulo's public broadcasting) released in 2012 {{YouTube|87FNMfTGSmA|Tim Maia's 1992 episode}} of their ''Ensaio'' music program.&lt;ref&gt;Faro, F.

'''William Fehr''' (17 April 1892 – 2 April 1968) was a [[South Africa]]n businessman and art collector noted for his acquisition of famous artworks, known as [[The William Fehr Collection]], now on display in the [[Castle of Good Hope]] in [[Cape Town]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/library-resources/articles_papers/Dr-william-ferh.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The collection was made publicly available for the first time in 1952 when Fehr and other collectors were invited to display historic pieces at the castle. A decade later the collection was purchased by the state and is now owned by [[Department of Arts and Culture (South Africa)|The Department of Arts and Culture of South Africa]].

==Early Childhood==
William Fehr was born in a remote colonial outpost called [[Burgersdorp]], a small town that linked the [[Cape Colony]] in the eastern frontier to the south of the [[Free State]] via a newly built railway. Fehr attended an Academy school in the little town. In 1901 his father Carl Fehr, who was a successful businessman in the town, moved his family back to his hometown of [[Wiesbaden]] in Germany as a result of his poor health and the looming threat of  the [[Anglo-Boer War]] &lt;ref name= "art collector"&gt;[http://www.sahistory.org.za/article/dr-william-fehr-1892-1968-collector-art-history 2016. South African History Online. "William Fehr (1892-1968), collector of art as history
". SAHO. Accessed: 1st August 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;. In Wiesbaden, William and his two younger siblings Gordon and Bertha attended Kënigliches Real-Gymnasium Schule &lt;ref name= "Dr. William Fehr"&gt;[http://scholar.sun.ac.za/handle/10019.1/52056 2000 - 43. Stellenbosch University Library and Information Services. "WILLIAM FEHR (1892-1968) AND HIS CONTRIBUTION TO THE STUDY OF SOUTH AFRICAN HISTORY AND CULTURE". SUNScholar Research Repository. Accessed: 1st August 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Early Career==
By 1912 William had taken up an apprenticeship at Edward Markus, a commerce firm in [[Berlin]]. In 1914 he became the head of the company's samples department at its [[London]] branch, a city that began refining his love for fine art &lt;ref name= "Dr. William Fehr"&gt;[http://scholar.sun.ac.za/handle/10019.1/52056 2000 - 43. Stellenbosch University Library and Information Services. "WILLIAM FEHR (1892-1968) AND HIS CONTRIBUTION TO THE STUDY OF SOUTH AFRICAN HISTORY AND CULTURE". SUNScholar Research Repository. Accessed: 1st August 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Due to [[World War I]], Carl decided to leave [[Europe]] and relocate his family back to the Cape Colony, with William following shortly thereafter. William found employment in [[East London]] at a commerce firm called Messrs. Malcomess &amp; Co., Ltd. &lt;ref name= "Dr. William Fehr"&gt;[http://scholar.sun.ac.za/handle/10019.1/52056 2000 - 43.

Accessed: 1st August 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Personal Art Collection==
During the 1920s William began assembling a personal art collection from colonial era Africa dating as far back as the 15th Century &lt;ref name= "art collector"&gt;[http://www.sahistory.org.za/article/dr-william-fehr-1892-1968-collector-art-history 2016. South African History Online. "William Fehr (1892-1968), collector of art as history
". SAHO. Accessed: 1st August 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;. This collection included paintings, prints and drawings, a collection which would later be extended to interior décor artefacts &lt;ref name= "William"&gt;[http://dev.iziko.org.za.dedi6.cpt3.host-h.net/collections/william-fehr-collection-0 2016. iziki Museums of South Africa. "The WF Collection". iziko. Accessed: 1st August 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;. His most prized works were in the form of personal pictures from his time growing up. William was fascinated with the ever-expanding and evolving medium of photography, and its ability to capture ordinary life onto a glass plate &lt;ref name= "art collector"&gt;[http://www.sahistory.org.za/article/dr-william-fehr-1892-1968-collector-art-history 2016. South African History Online. "William Fehr (1892-1968), collector of art as history
". SAHO. Accessed: 1st August 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==The William Fehr Collection==
In the early to mid 19th Century there was a lack of systematic artifacts gathering by South African cultural and heritage institutions, particularly by the South African government. By this time William was one of the foremost art collectors in South Africa. In 1952 he lent his personal collection for public exhibition to the Van Riebeeck Tercentenary Festival which was housed at the Castle of Good Hope &lt;ref name= "William"&gt;[http://dev.iziko.org.za.dedi6.cpt3.host-h.net/collections/william-fehr-collection-0 2016. iziki Museums of South Africa. "The WF Collection". iziko. Accessed: 1st August 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;.
 
In 1964 the South African government purchased his personal collections, which by then included oil paintings, furniture, ceramic, metal and glassware. This collection can still be seen at the Castle of Good Hope today &lt;ref name= "William"&gt;[http://dev.iziko.org.za.dedi6.cpt3.host-h.net/collections/william-fehr-collection-0 2016. iziki Museums of South Africa. "The WF Collection". iziko. Accessed: 1st August 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1965 he donated more of his personal artifacts to the South African government, works which were housed at Rust en Vreugd in the Cape Town City Centre &lt;ref name= "William"&gt;[http://dev.iziko.org.za.dedi6.cpt3.host-h.net/collections/william-fehr-collection-0 2016. iziki Museums of South Africa.

'''Winthrop Rockefeller''' (May 1, 1912 – February 22, 1973) was an American politician and philanthropist, who served as the first [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] [[governor of Arkansas]] since [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. He was a third-generation member of the [[Rockefeller family]].

==Early life==
Winthrop Rockefeller was born in New York, to philanthropists [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.|John Davison Rockefeller Jr.]] (1874–1960) and [[Abby Aldrich Rockefeller|Abigail Greene "Abby" Aldrich]] (1874–1948). He had one elder sister named [[Abby Rockefeller Mauzé|Abby]], three elder brothers [[John D. Rockefeller III|John III]], [[Nelson Rockefeller|Nelson]], and [[Laurance Rockefeller|Laurance]], and a younger brother named [[David Rockefeller|David]]. Nelson served as [[Governor of New York]] and [[Vice President of the United States]].

Winthrop attended [[Yale University]] (1931–34) but was ejected as a result of misbehavior before earning his degree. Prior to attending Yale, he graduated from the [[Loomis Chaffee School]] in [[Windsor, Connecticut]].

In early 1941, he enlisted in the [[United States Army|Army]]. As a soldier of the [[77th Sustainment Brigade (United States)|77th Infantry Division]], he fought in [[World War II]], advancing from [[Private (rank)|Private]] to [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]]. He earned a [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]] with [[Oak Leaf Cluster]]s and a [[Purple Heart]] for his actions aboard the [[troopship]] [[USS Henrico (APA-45)|USS ''Henrico'']], after a [[kamikaze]] attack during the [[USS Henrico (APA-45)#Invasion of Okinawa|invasion of Okinawa]]. His image appears in the Infantry Officer Hall of Fame at [[Fort Benning]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

==Personal life==
On February 14, 1948, Winthrop married actress Jievute "Bobo" Paulekiute (September 6, 1916 &amp;ndash; May 19, 2008). She was previously married to [[Boston Brahmin]] socialite John Sears Jr.&lt;ref name=BoboDeath&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Stephen|title=Bobo Rockefeller, 91, Married Well, Divorced Better|url=http://www.nysun.com/obituaries/bobo-rockefeller-91-married-well-divorced-better/76767/|publisher=The New York Sun|accessdate=21 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wedding took place in [[Florida]], and at the reception, a choir sang [[Spiritual (music)|Negro spirituals]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Bride Wore Pink", Time magazine, 23 February 1948&lt;/ref&gt; On September 17, 1948, she gave birth to their son, [[Winthrop Paul Rockefeller|Winthrop Paul "Win" Rockefeller]].

The couple separated in 1950 and divorced in 1954. Bobo got custody of Win.&lt;ref&gt;"Take It Or Leave It", Time magazine, June 23, 1952&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 11, 1956, Rockefeller wed the [[Seattle]]-born socialite Jeanette Edris (1918–1997).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newspaperarchive.com/SiteMap/FreePdfPreview.aspx?img=107288693 ''Lubbock Avalanche-Journal via newspaperarchive.com''] 17 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; She had two children, Bruce and Ann Bartley, from a previous marriage. Winthrop and Jeanette had no children together and divorced shortly after he left the governorship in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrfoundation.org/assets/files/pdfs/wrf2008report_sm.pdf "The Life of Winthrop Rockefeller" ''wrfoundation.org''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402133936/http://www.wrfoundation.org/assets/files/pdfs/wrf2008report_sm.pdf |date=2012-04-02 }} 17 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

As the state's First Lady, Jeanette Rockefeller took a special interest in [[mental health]] issues.

==Move to Arkansas==
Rockefeller moved to central [[Arkansas]] in 1953 and established ''Winrock Enterprises'' and ''Winrock Farms'' atop [[Petit Jean Mountain]] near [[Morrilton, Arkansas|Morrilton]] in [[Conway County, Arkansas|Conway County]].

In 1954, Republican [[Pratt C. Remmel]] polled 37 percent of the vote in the gubernatorial [[general election]] against [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Orval Faubus]]. It was a good showing for a Republican candidate in Arkansas, compared to previous races in the 1940s and early 1950s. Twelve years later, Rockefeller would build upon Remmel's race and win the governorship for the Republican Party.

In 1955, Faubus appointed Rockefeller chairman of the Arkansas Industrial Development Commission (AIDC).

Rockefeller initiated a number of philanthropies and projects. He financed the building of a model school at Morrilton and led efforts to establish a Fine Arts Center in the capital city of [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]]. He also financed the construction of medical clinics in some of the state's poorest counties, in addition to making annual gifts to the state's colleges and universities. These philanthropic activities continue to this day through the ''Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation''.

==First political campaigns==
In 1960, Rockefeller did not seek the governorship but instead raised funds for the Republican nominee, [[Henry M. Britt]], a conservative [[lawyer]] from [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]], the seat of [[Garland County, Arkansas|Garland County]]. Britt lost in every county and barely polled 30 percent of the statewide vote in his loss to Faubus. In 1961, Rockefeller was named Arkansas [[Republican National Committee|Republican national committeeman]], having succeeded [[Wallace Townsend]], a lawyer in Little Rock who had held the position since 1928. In 1962, Rockefeller supported [[Willis Ricketts]], another in a long line of failed Republican candidates who sought to topple Faubus. He also supported a slate of Republican legislative candidates. Soon, he quarreled with state Republican party chairman [[William L. Spicer]] of [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]] over the direction of the party. Spicer favored a stronger conservative approach compared to Rockefeller's moderate-to-liberal outlook.

Rockefeller resigned his position with the AIDC and conducted his first campaign for governor in 1964 against Faubus. His campaign was ultimately unsuccessful, but Rockefeller energized and reformed the tiny [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] to set the stage for the future. In 1964, [[Osro Cobb]], a Republican former state chairman who had also served as [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas|United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas]], refused to endorse Rockefeller but openly Faubus, who subseqauently gave Cobb a temporary appointment to the [[Arkansas Supreme Court]].

In his memoirs, Cobb recalls that Rockefeller

&lt;blockquote&gt;had used ruthless tactics to convert the fine Republican state organization into a one-man Rockefeller machine, loyal not to party but to Rockefeller personally. In rapid succession, Mr. Rockefeller captiously took over most of the functions of the state chairman and in a matter of months succeeded in taking over and exercising absolute right of dictation as to each and every important party function at the state level. Such one-man dictatorship is clearly the deadly enemy of any semblance of two-party government. ... Faithful Republican leaders who have worked tirelessly over the years have been pushed aside or replaced. ... A stranger passing through Arkansas at this time and seeing Mr. Rockefeller's advertising on billboards would not know whether Mr. Rockefeller belonged to any political party. Certainly the fact that he is the Republican nominee has not been included. The evidence simply is unanswerable that Mr. Rockefeller is working for his own personal interest to the exclusion of all other considerations, which leaves the Republican Party in Arkansas hanging precariously at the whims of one individual ... .&lt;ref&gt;[[Osro Cobb]], ''Osro Cobb of Arkansas:Memoirs of Significance'', Carol Griffee, ed. ([[Little Rock, Arkansas]]: Rose Publishing Company, 1989), pp. 140-141.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The election of 1966==
When Rockefeller made his second run in the [[Arkansas gubernatorial election, 1966|1966 election]], only 11 percent of Arkansans considered themselves [[United States Republican Party|Republicans]]. But Arkansans had tired of Faubus after six terms as governor and as head of the Democratic "[[Political machine|machine]]". Democrats themselves seemed to be more interested in the reforms that Rockefeller offered in his campaign than "winning another one for the party". An odd coalition of Republicans and Democratic reform voters catapulted Rockefeller into the governor's office, as he defeated a [[segregationist]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842937,00.html | work=Time | title=Arkansas: Squealing at the Lick Log | date=1966-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Democratic former Justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court, [[James D. Johnson]] of [[Conway, Arkansas|Conway]] in [[Faulkner County, Arkansas|Faulkner County]], who preferred the appellation "Justice Jim".&lt;ref&gt;Coincidentally, Rockefeller resided in [[Conway County, Arkansas|Conway County]] and Johnson had relocated to [[Conway, Arkansas|Conway]] in [[Faulkner County, Arkansas|Faulkner County]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Former state Republican chairman Osro Cobb reversed himself in 1966 and endorsed Rockefeller. He explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Arkansas Republicans were eager to work with Winthrop Rockefeller on another race for governor if he could be led to run as a true Republican to help build the party in the state. I liked him personally. He showed me many courtesies, and I still thought [despite feelings in 1964] that he would make a good governor and could be elected on the Republican ticket. ... He had learned a lesson. And he won his next two races for governor. ... His service contributed greatly to the enormous benefits of two-party government in Arkansas.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, pp.143-144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a surprise, Rockefeller's running-mate for [[Lieutenant Governor of Arkansas|lieutenant governor]], [[Maurice L. Britt]], a decorated World War II veteran and a former professional football player, was narrowly elected to the second-ranking post over the Democrat James Pilkington of [[Hope, Arkansas|Hope]], Arkansas.

Other Rockefeller running-mates, such as former Democratic State Representative [[Jerry Thomasson]] of [[Arkadelphia, Arkansas|Arkadelphia]], who sought the office of [[attorney general]] in 1966 and 1968, and [[Leona Troxell]] of [[Rose Bud, Arkansas|Rose Bud]] in [[White County, Arkansas|White County]], who ran for state treasurer in 1968, were defeated.

Only three Republicans won election to the 100-member [[Arkansas House of Representatives]] at the time of Rockefeller's first victory: [[George E. Nowotny]], of [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]], [[Danny Patrick (Arkansas politician)|Danny Patrick]] of [[Madison County, Arkansas|Madison County]], and [[Jim Sheets]] of [[Siloam Springs, Arkansas|Siloam Springs]] in [[Benton County, Arkansas|Benton County]]. Another Republican representative, [[Marshall Chrisman]] of [[Ozark, Arkansas|Ozark]] in [[Franklin County, Arkansas|Franklin County]], served in the state House from 1969 to 1970.

Two Republicans ran for [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] on the Rockefeller ticket in 1966. [[John Paul Hammerschmidt]], the outgoing party chairman, won in the northwestern Third District. [[Lynn Lowe]], a [[Texarkana, Arkansas|Texarkana]] farmer, who later served as party chairman from 1974–1980, lost in the southern Fourth District race to the Democrat [[David Pryor]].

At the time Winthrop became governor, his brother [[Nelson Rockefeller]] had been the [[governor of New York]] since 1959, and remained so throughout Winthrop's four years in office. They are often erroneously cited as the first two brothers to be [[Governor (United States)|governors]] at the same time, but they were actually the third case; the previous instances were [[Levi Lincoln Jr.|Levi]] and [[Enoch Lincoln]] from 1827 to 1829, and [[John Bigler|John]] and [[William Bigler]] from 1852 to 1855. More recently, [[George W. Bush|George W.]] and [[Jeb Bush]] were both governors from 1999 to 2000.

At the [[1968 Republican National Convention]], Winthrop Rockefeller received backing from members of the Arkansas [[delegate|delegation]] as a "[[favorite son]]" [[President of the United States|presidential]] candidate. He received all of his state's 18 votes; his brother Nelson, then concluding a major presidential bid against [[Richard Nixon|Richard M. Nixon]], received 277. This was the only time in the 20th century that the names of two brothers were placed into nomination at the same time.

==Governor of Arkansas==
The Rockefeller administration enthusiastically embarked on a series of reforms but faced a hostile Democratic legislature. Rockefeller endured a number of personal attacks and a concerted [[whispering campaign]] regarding his personal life.

Scholars Diane Blair and Jay L. Barth continue: "As long as Rockefeller led the Arkansas Republicans, the party had a progressive, reformist cast, and those whom Rockefeller had brought into the party continued to dominate party offices and shape presidential preferences until 1980,"&lt;ref&gt;Diane Divers Blair (1938-2000) and Jay L. Barth (born 1939), ''Arkansas Government and Politics'', 2nd ed. ([[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]], [[Nebraska]]: [[University of Nebraska Press]], 2005), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; when the nomination and election of [[Ronald Reagan]] of [[California]] as president and [[Frank D. White]] as governor moved power within the state GOP "sharply to the right."&lt;ref&gt;Blair and Barth, Arkansas Politics and Government, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately the growth of the Republican Party was slower in Arkansas than in the other southern states in the post-segregation era. Blair and Barth attribute sluggish GOP development to "tradition, [which] is important to rural people. They are looking for ways to stay with the Democratic Party; they have to be run off."&lt;ref&gt;Blair and Barth, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his biographer, Cathy Kunzinger Urwin, Rockefeller's "good-government" reform proposals included: revision of the Arkansas State Constitution, governmental administrative reorganization, election law reform (a "little [[Hatch Act of 1939|Hatch Act]]" to prohibit state employees from engaging in political activities on the job), teacher tenure, taxpayer-funded kindergarten under Amendment 53, adult and continuing education programs, rehabilitation and vocational training in the corrections system, and the recurring attempts at industrial recruitment.&lt;ref&gt;Cathy Kunzinger Urwin, ''Agenda for Reform : Winthrop Rockefeller as Governor of Arkansas, 1967-71'' ([[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]]: [[University of Arkansas Press]], 1991), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Rockefeller's most publicized "good-government" reforms was the ending of illegal gambling in the resort city of [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]]. He also made headway in streamlining state government and secured passage of a state minimum-wage law.&lt;ref&gt;Urwin, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Urwin determined that Rockefeller's negatives created public perceptions of "his personal flaws, rather than his accomplishments or lack of them, as governor."&lt;ref&gt;Urwin, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; Considered a weak administrator, he depended too heavily on staff, so improperly managed that the employees often failed to answer mail. He was habitually tardy to meetings. A special legislative session in May 1968 was particularly disastrous.&lt;ref&gt;Urwin, pp. 110-111&lt;/ref&gt; An Oliver Quayle poll in 1968 declared that Rockefeller seemed "strange, alien, and foreign" to many voters. The poll maintained that many thought Rockefeller sought too much power, that he drank too much, and that he spent too little time in his office. A majority said that the wealthy Rockefeller, despite his interest in "good government," could not understand the problems of common people on restricted incomes or those in the middle class with limited investment opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Randy Sanders, ''Mighty Peculiar Elections: The News South Gubernatorial Campaigns of 1970 and the Changing Politics of Race'' ([[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]]: [[University Press of Florida]], 2002), p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Rockefeller had a particular interest in the reform of the [[Arkansas Department of Correction|Arkansas prison system]]. Soon after his election he had received a shocking report from the [[Arkansas State Police]] on the brutal conditions within the prison system. He decried the "lack of righteous indignation" about the situation and created a new Department of Corrections. He appointed a new warden, academic [[Tom Murton]], the first professional [[Penology|penologist]] that the state had ever retained in that capacity. However, he fired Murton less than a year later, when Murton's aggressive attempts to expose decades of corruption in the system subjected Arkansas to nationwide contempt.

Rockefeller also focused on the state's lackluster educational system and proposed funding increases for new buildings and teacher salaries when the legislature allowed.

In 1967, Rockefeller named an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent, [[Lynn A. Davis]], to head the state police with orders to halt illegal [[gambling]] in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]]. After sensational raids against the mobsters, Davis was forced out as police director 128 days later when the [[Arkansas Supreme Court]] ruled that he did not meet the strict 10-year residency requirement for the appointment. Democratic lawmakers refused to change the rule to allow Davis to serve. The Hot Springs raids were the No. 1 news story in Arkansas in 1967 as determined by the [[Associated Press]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'', January 9, 28, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John L. Ward, ''The Arkansas Rockefeller'', [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]]: [[Louisiana State University]] Press, 1978, pp. 104-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rockefeller won re-election in November 1968, having defeated [[Marion H. Crank]], a state legislator from [[Foreman, Arkansas|Foreman]] in [[Little River County, Arkansas|Little River County]], who had won the Democratic nomination in a heated fight with [[Virginia Johnson (Arkansas)|Virginia Morris Johnson]], wife of Jim Johnson and the first woman ever to seek the office of [[governor of Arkansas]]. Newly reelected, Rockefeller proposed tax increases to fund additional reforms and his second term began on January 14, 1969. Rockefeller and the legislature dueled with competing public-relations campaigns and Rockefeller's plan ultimately collapsed in the face of public indifference.

With Rockefeller's reelection, the Republicans won a rare seat in the [[Arkansas Senate|Arkansas State Senate]] with the election of [[Jim Caldwell (Arkansas politician)|Jim R. Caldwell]] of [[Rogers, Arkansas|Rogers]] in northwestern Arkansas.&lt;ref&gt;After his political career ended in 1979, Caldwell, a [[Church of Christ]] minister, moved to [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the Rockefeller administration, the state Republican Party chairman was the attorney [[Odell Pollard]] of [[Searcy, Arkansas|Searcy]] in [[White County, Arkansas|White County]], who once said that he and Rockefeller agreed on everything.

Much of Rockefeller's second term was spent in conflict with the opposition legislature. In 1969, he told the lawmakers that his reelection the previous November had meant that a slim majority of voters had approved of tax increases. He proposed to spend half of the new revenues sought on education, 12 percent on health and welfare, 10 percent on local government, and the remainder on state employee salaries and streamlined services. "There are no frills in what I am proposing ... . no luxuries ... . no monuments to me as an individual ... . I implore every member of the General Assembly as I have myself: Listen to the voice of the people ... . not to the selfish interests."&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

Ernest Dumas, then with the since defunct ''[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette|Arkansas Gazette]]'' in Little Rock noted that the Rockefeller revenue package was essentially dead-on-arrival in both houses of the legislature though parts of the program were enacted piecemeal in the subsequent administration of the Democrat [[Dale Bumpers]]. Dumas describes Rockefeller as the "most liberal governor in Arkansas history" in light of his attempts to increase taxes to augment the size and scope of state government as well as steadfast support for civil rights and opposition to capital punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Statement of Ernest Dumas, December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racial politics==
During this term Rockefeller quietly and successfully completed the [[Racial integration|integration]] of Arkansas schools that had been such a political bombshell only a few years before. He established the Council on Human Relations despite opposition from the legislature. Draft boards in the state boasted the highest level of racial integration of any U.S. state by the time that Rockefeller left office.&lt;ref name=LifeOfWinthrop&gt;{{cite web|last=Scott|first=Lauren|title=A look at the life of Winthrop Rockefeller in Arkansas|url=http://www.thv11.com/news/article/194816/2/THV-Extra-at-10-A-closer-look-at-Rockefeller|publisher=THV11|accessdate=8 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, it was disclosed that Rockefeller had maintained a list of militants for use by law enforcement to prevent potential disorders on Arkansas college and university campuses. The list drew opposition from some of his opponents, including an unsuccessful Democratic primary hopeful, state House [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] [[Hayes McClerkin]] of [[Texarkana, Arkansas|Texarkana]]. McClerkin argued that the list may have contained the names of those who merely disagreed with Rockefeller politically.&lt;ref&gt;John L. Ward, ''The Arkansas Rockefeller'' ([[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], [[Louisiana]]: [[Louisiana State University Press]], 1978), pp. 167-168, 175; ''[[Arkansas Democrat]]'', January 3, 8, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, the Arkansas GOP under Rockefeller hired its first paid executive director, Neal Sox Johnson of [[Nashville, Arkansas|Nashville]] in [[Howard County, Arkansas|Howard County]]. Johnson left the position in 1973 to take a high position with the former [[Farmers Home Administration]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and was replaced by [[Ken Coon]],&lt;ref&gt;''Arkansas Outlook'', Arkansas Republican Party newsletter, February 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; who carried the party's gubernatorial banner in 1974 against [[David Pryor]].

==End of the Rockefeller era==
In the 1970 campaign, Rockefeller expected to face Orval Faubus, who led the old-guard Democrats, but the previously unknown [[Dale Bumpers]] of [[Charleston, Arkansas|Charleston]] in [[Franklin County, Arkansas|Franklin County]] rose to the top of the Democratic heap by promising reforms. Bumpers' charisma and "fresh face" were too much for an incumbent Republican to overcome. Rockefeller lost his third-term bid, but he had inadvertently propelled the Democrats to reform their own party. Maurice Britt managed the 1970 campaign, and he was replaced on the Republican ticket for lieutenant governor by [[Sterling R. Cockrill]] of Little Rock, the former Democratic House Speaker in Rockefeller's first term. Cockrill switched parties in the spring of 1970 to make the race; he was defeated by the Democrat [[Bob C. Riley]] but finished 35,000 votes ahead of Rockefeller.&lt;ref&gt;Arkansas Secretary of State, General election returns, November 3, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting on his defeat, Rockefeller said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It has been said by some that I asked for too much. Perhaps so. You tell me -- what quality of leadership would ask too little? What sort of leadership would be content merely to maintain a standard of living that for so long has been so meager for so many? The shame upon me and my administration would have been in not struggling for something better. Today, I am not ashamed ... . The most meaningful measurement of progress is that certain things are no longer acceptable to us as a people.&lt;ref&gt;''The Arkansas Outlook'', January 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With the 1970 elections, the Republicans were reduced to a single member of each legislative chamber, [[Preston Bynum]] of [[Siloam Springs, Arkansas|Siloam Springs]] in the House and Jim Caldwell in the Senate. Danny Patrick, elected with Rockefeller in 1966 and 1968, went down to defeat in Madison and Carroll counties at the hands of Stephen A. Smith, who at twenty-one became Arkansas' youngest-ever state legislator,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acjournal.org/holdings/vol2/Iss1/articles/smith.html|title=Stephen A. Smith, University of Arkansas, "People, Power, and Realpoliticks in the Provinces"|publisher=acjournal.org|accessdate=May 31, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611133832/http://www.acjournal.org/holdings/vol2/Iss1/articles/smith.html|archivedate=June 11, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a designation that Patrick himself had taken only four years earlier.

As a dramatic last act, Governor Rockefeller, a longtime [[Capital punishment#Controversy and debate|death penalty opponent]], commuted the sentences of every prisoner on Arkansas's [[Death Row]] and urged the governors of other states to do likewise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,876862,00.html|title=The Law: Clemency in Arkansas|author=|date=11 January 1971|publisher=|accessdate=6 April 2018|via=www.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?did=126&amp;scid=13|title=DPIC - Death Penalty Information Center|author=|date=|website=www.deathpenaltyinfo.org|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-three years later, in January 2003, Illinois' [[Lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] governor, [[George Ryan]], would do the same, granting blanket commutations to the 167 inmates then sentenced to death in that state.

Before he left office, Rockefeller appointed a young public administrator, [[Jerry Climer]], to the vacant post of Pulaski County clerk. Two years later, Climer ran for secretary of state. He later founded two [[Washington, D.C.]]-based "think tanks." and left office on January 12, 1971.

In 1972, Rockefeller persuaded [[Len E. Blaylock]] of [[Perry County, Arkansas|Perry County]], his former welfare commissioner known for expertise in government administration to be the Republican gubernatorial nominee. Blaylock lost to Bumpers by an even greater margin than had Rockefeller in 1970. Rockefeller that year also supported the unsuccessful candidacy of [[Wayne H. Babbitt]], a [[North Little Rock, Arkansas|North Little Rock]] [[veterinarian]] who became the only Republican ever to challenge the reelection of U.S. Senator [[John L. McClellan]].

Rockefeller hired as a $300-a-month secretary [[Judy Petty Wolf|Judy Petty]], who went on to serve two terms in the state legislature and to carry the Republican standard twice in races for Congress.

In September 1972, Rockefeller was diagnosed with inoperable [[pancreatic cancer]] and endured a devastating round of [[chemotherapy]]. When he returned to Arkansas the populace was shocked at the gaunt and haggard appearance of what had been a giant of a man.

Winthrop Rockefeller died February 22, 1973, in [[Palm Springs, California]], at the age of sixty. His body was cremated, and his ashes were interred at Winrock Farms in Morrilton, Arkansas.

==Legacy==
The legacy of Winthrop Rockefeller lives on in the form of numerous charities, scholarships, and the activities of the ''Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation'' and the ''Winthrop Rockefeller Charitable Trust'', including Winrock International, an international [[nonprofit organization]] based in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] whose mission is to empower disadvantaged people, increase economic opportunity, and sustain natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=3042 "Winrock International"], The Enyclopedia of Arkansas History &amp; Culture. Retrieved on 29 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation provides funding for projects across Arkansas to encourage economic development, education, and racial and social justice. In 1964, he founded [[Museum of Automobiles]] on [[Petit Jean State Park|Petit Jean Mountain]], which after his death in 1973 was given to the [[Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism|Arkansas State Parks]] system; a [[non-profit organization]] was formed to run the museum; in March 2007, the Charitable Trust pledged $100,000 for its ongoing operations if the museum raised an equal amount by the end of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmcstations.com/Global/story.asp?S=6122157|title=wmcstations.com via AP|author=|date=|website=wmcstations.com|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rockefeller's political legacy lives on in both the Republican and Democratic parties of Arkansas, both of which were forced to reform as a result of his presence on the state scene.

Rockefeller was the subject of the December 2, 1966, cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.

Winthrop Rockefeller's son and only child, Win, served as Arkansas lieutenant governor, having won a [[special election]] in 1996 to succeed [[Mike Huckabee]]. Winthrop Paul Rockefeller then won two full four-year terms in 1998 and 2002. Like his father, Win Paul Rockefeller's political career was cut short by a devastating cancer.

The [[Winrock Shopping Center]] in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], is named for Rockefeller. He developed the center in a relationship with the [[University of New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cabq.gov/aes/s2midht.html&lt;/ref&gt;

During his tenure as chairman of [[Colonial Williamsburg]], Winthrop was a frequent visitor at the foundation's [[Carter's Grove|Carter's Grove Plantation]] eight miles away in [[James City County, Virginia|James City County]], [[Virginia]]. He is credited with helping develop a plan with [[Gussie Busch]] in the early 1970s to turn a portion of the large tract of undeveloped land between the two points into the massive [[Anheuser-Busch]] (AB) investment there, which included building a large brewery, the [[Busch Gardens Williamsburg]] [[Amusement park|theme park]], the [[Kingsmill]] planned resort community, and McLaws Circle, an office park. AB and related entities from that development plan now are the source of the area's largest employment base, surpassing both Colonial Williamsburg and the local military bases.
