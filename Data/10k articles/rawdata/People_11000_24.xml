The '''Afshar Operation''' was a military operation in [[Afghanistan]] that took place on February 11-12, 1993 during the [[Afghan Civil War (1992-96)]]. The operation was launched by [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] and [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]]'s [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] government and the allied [[Abdul Rasul Sayyaf]]'s [[Ittehad-i Islami]] paramilitary forces against [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]]'s [[Hezbe Islami]] and [[Abdul Ali Mazari]]'s [[Hezbe Wahdat]] militias in the densely populated [[Afshar district|Afshar]] district in west [[Kabul]]. The [[Hazara people|Hazara]]-Hezbe Wahdat together with the [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]]-Hezbe Islami of Hekmatyar had been shelling densely populated areas in northern Kabul from their positions in Afshar, killing thousands. To counter the shelling, government forces attacked Afshar in order to capture the positions of Wahdat and its leader Mazari, and to consolidate parts of the city controlled by the government.

The operation became an urban war zone and escalated into what is called the '''Afshar massacre''' when Sayyaf's Ittehad-i Islami forces and Massoud's Jamaat-e-Islami forces committed "repeated human butchery"&lt;ref name="Culpability "&gt;{{cite report |year=2006 |chapter-url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2005/07/06/blood-stained-hands/past-atrocities-kabul-and-afghanistans-legacy-impunity#3f7630 |chapter=IV. Culpability |title=Blood-Stained Hands: Past Atrocities in Kabul and Afghanistan’s Legacy of Impunity |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; turning against the [[Shia]] [[Muslim]]s.&lt;ref name="Book_Anderson"/&gt; Reports emerged that Sayyaf's [[Sunni]] [[Wahhabist]] forces backed by [[Saudi Arabia]] rampaged through Afshar, murdering, raping and burning homes.&lt;ref name="bbc_2001"&gt;{{cite news |date=2 December 2001 &lt;!-- , 17:56 GMT --&gt; |title=A personal account |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=2008-04-21 |first=Phil |last=Rees |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/correspondent/1682466.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Battle for Kabul"&gt;{{cite report |date=July 6, 2005 |chapter-url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2005/07/06/blood-stained-hands/past-atrocities-kabul-and-afghanistans-legacy-impunity#96a8e1 |chapter=III. The Battle for Kabul: April 1992-March 1993 |title=Blood-Stained Hands: Past Atrocities in Kabul and Afghanistan’s Legacy of Impunity |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Hezb-e Wahdat and the Ittihad-i Islami had been involved in systematic abduction campaigns against civilians of the "opposite side", a pattern Ittihad continued in Afshar. Besides Ittihad commanders, two of the nine government commanders on the ground, [[Anwar Dangar]] (who later defected to the [[Taliban]]) and [[Mullah Izzat]], were also named as leading troops that carried out abuses. Reports describe looting, indiscriminate shelling by Sayyaf´s men and massacaring of thousands of civilians from Hazara ethnic group. In one instance fleeing civilians in the streets were hit by fire from government soldiers. At the same time it was reported that in another incidence government troops carried a wounded Afshar civilian to safety and that some commanders on the ground tried to stop abuses from taking place.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

The Islamic State's Defense Minister Ahmad Shah Massoud ordered an immediate halt to the crimes on the second day of the operation, but especially looting and the destruction of houses continued to take place for a second day. Massoud then appointed a Shia commander, [[Hussain Anwari]], to ensure the safety of the Shia civilian population in Afshar. However Anwari himself became infamous for terrorizing [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] civilians, who were also raped and assaulted.

He also ordered the withdrawal of all offensive troops and persuaded Sayyaf to do the same. The Islamic State government in collaboration with the then enemy militia of Hezb-e Wahdat as well as in cooperation with Afshar civilians established a commission to investigate the crimes that had taken place in Afshar. The commission paid ransoms for approximately 80 to 200 people held by several Ittihad commanders. But 700-750 people abducted by Ittihad during the campaign were never returned, and were presumably killed or died in captivity.&lt;ref name="Battle for Kabul"/&gt; The same commission received information that many women were abducted during the operation, but said that few families would report it.&lt;ref name="Book_Anderson"&gt;{{cite book |first=John Lee |last=Anderson |title=The Lion's Grave |edition=November 26, 2002 |pages=224 |publisher=Atlantic Books |isbn=1-84354-118-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Afshar operation proceeded with Massoud's approval, although he disapproved of Sayyaf's methods.

The Afshar operation, which saw hundreds of Sunni Pashtuns and Shia [[Hazaras]] systemically targeted and depopulated from villages in the area, was the first such [[sectarian]] oriented incident in Afghanistan's modern history. It is also considered to have been one of the worst single events in Afghanistan's wars.&lt;ref&gt;http://worldhazaracouncil.org/en/home1/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and Objectives==
On April 26, 1992, the mujahedin leaders announced a new peace and power-sharing agreement, the [[Peshawar Accords]].&lt;ref name="Culpability"/&gt; During the period discussed in this article, the sovereignty of Afghanistan was vested formally in the "Islamic State of Afghanistan," an entity created in April 1992, after the fall of the Soviet-backed Najibu
lah government through the Peshawar Accords.&lt;ref name="Battle for Kabul"/&gt; The legitimate representatives of the government were President Burhanuddin Rabbani and minister of defense Ahmad Shah Massoud.&lt;ref name="Battle for Kabul"/&gt;

With the exception of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-i Islami which to a very large extent was controlled by the regime in Pakistan, all parties were ostensibly unified under this government in 1993.&lt;ref name="Battle for Kabul"/&gt; Hekmatyar shelled Kabul with tens of thousands of rockets in 1992 to gain power for himself.&lt;ref name="Culpability"/&gt; Hekmatyar repeatedly was offered the position of prime minister but he did not want to share power.

After failed attempts for negotiations a brutal war broke out between the Saudi-backed Ittihad-e-Islami of Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, the Jamiat-e-Islami of Ahmad Shah Massoud  and the Hezb-i Wahdat of Abdul Ali Mazari. According to [[Human Rights Watch]] numerous Iranian agents were assisting Wahdat forces, as Iran was attempting to maximize Wahdat's military power and influence in the new government.&lt;ref name="Blood-Stained Hands"&gt;{{cite report |date=July 6, 2005 |url=https://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2005/07/06/blood-stained-hands |title=Blood-Stained Hands: Past Atrocities in Kabul and Afghanistan's Legacy of Impunity |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi agents, private or governmental, were trying to strengthen Sayyaf and his Ittihad faction to the same end.&lt;ref name="Blood-Stained Hands"/&gt; Rare ceasefires commonly collapsed within days.&lt;ref name="Blood-Stained Hands"/&gt;

In December 1992 Abdul Ali Mazari's Wahdat entered in an alliance with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.&lt;ref name="Battle for Kabul"/&gt;  With his newly created alliance with Hezb-i Wahdat, Hekmatyar increased his rockets and shell attacks on the city.&lt;ref name="Culpability"/&gt;  Human Rights Watch concludes:
{{quote |Shells and rockets fell everywhere.&lt;ref name="Culpability"/&gt;}}

The Afghanistan Justice Project gives the following objectives for the military operation:
{{quote|There were two tactical objectives to the operation. First, Massoud intended, through the operation to capture the political and military headquarters of Hezb-i Wahdat [...] and to capture Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of Hezb-i Wahdat. Second, the ISA [the Islamic State of Afghanistan with defense minister Massoud] intended to consolidate the areas of the capital directly controlled by Islamic State forces by linking up parts of west Kabul controlled by Ittihad-i Islami with parts of central Kabul controlled by Jamiat-i Islami. Given the political and military context of Kabul at the time, these two objectives (which were largely attained during the operation) provide a compelling explanation of why the Islamic State forces attacked Afshar.&lt;ref name="Casting Shadows"&gt;{{cite web|year=2005 |url=http://afghanistanjusticeproject.org/warcrimesandcrimesagainsthumanity19782001.pdf |title=Casting Shadows: War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity 1978-2001, Documentation and analysis of major patterns of abuse in the war in Afghanistan |publisher=Afghanistan Justice Project |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090824063526/http://afghanistanjusticeproject.org/warcrimesandcrimesagainsthumanity19782001.pdf |archivedate=2009-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Timeline==

===Preparation===
According to a Human Rights Watch report, "credible and consistent" accounts from several officials who worked in [[Shura-e-Nazar]] (the informal politico-military organization headed by Rabbani's defense minister, Ahmad Shah Massoud) and the Rabbani interim government reveal that a military campaign against Hezb-i Wahdat was planned and approved by officials at the "highest levels" of the Rabbani government.&lt;ref name="Culpability"/&gt;

According to Afghanistan Justice Project although individual commanders cannot be identified, brigade and battalion leaders can be listed. For Jamiat, these include [[Qasim Fahim]], Anwar Dangar, Mullah Ezat, Mohammad Ishaq Pashiri, Haji Bahlol Panshiri, [[Baba Jalandar Panjshiri]], Khanjar Akhund Panshiri, Musdoq Lalai, and Baz Mohammad Ahmadi Badakhshani. From Ittihad these included Haji [[Shir Alam]], Amir Anwar Oryakhail, [[Zulmai Tufan]], Dr. Abdullah, Jaglan Naeem, Mullah Taj Mohammad, [[Abdullah Shah]], Khinjar, Abdul Manan Diwana, Amanullah Kochi, [[Shirin]], Mushtaq Lalai, and Mullah Kachkol.

By February 1993, Massoud had conducted negotiations with dissident Wahdat commanders who signed secret protocols with Massoud in order to avoid a long fight promising to cooperate during the conflict and to capture Mazari and his cabinet.&lt;ref name="Casting Shadows"/&gt;

===The Operation===
The men of [[Mohammad Fahim]], who was in charge of special operations, contacted a number of the Shia commanders and obtained their co-operation. This allowed the [[artillery]] to be pre-positioned in advance of the battle, with a [[ZU-23]] gun and 30 men being positioned on Aliabad hill, with the purpose of targeting the Central Silo, Afshar, Kart-iSeh, Kart-iChar and Kart-I Sakhi. The forces allied with the government began to bomb the area around Afshar before troops began to move in around 4:00 am on February 11. Troops moved from Badambagh to the top of Radar hill, which was part of the Afshar ridge. According to Afghanistan Justice Project:

A large contingent of both Ittihad and Jamiat forces advanced towards Afshar from the west. The closest point of the front line to the main target of the operation was the Kabul Polytechnic. A Jamiat force advanced along the main Afshar Road, from Kart-iParwan and the Intercontinental Hotel, towards the Social Science Institute, entering Afshar from the east. The ISA forces did not advance along other sections of the front line marking the west Kabul enclave, although they maintained an intense bombardment and had ample forces deployed to maintain a threat of advance.

According to this, by 13:00 the main defense line of Hezb-I Wahdat had failed and the forces, including Mazari and his top commanders, began to flee on foot. By 14:00 the Social Science Institute was captured and troops were in control of Khushal Mina and Afshar.

Mazari re-established a defense line near the Central Silo and Kart-iSakhi, at the edge of Khushhal Mina, keeping control over most of West Kabul. Following this many of the residence fled to Taimani, an Ismali area of the city.

The objectives of the military operation were largely attained during the operation.&lt;ref name="Casting Shadows"/&gt; Wahdat's headquarters and many of their positions were captured so that they were not able to shell Kabul from those positions anymore.&lt;ref name="Casting Shadows"/&gt;

===Crimes Against Civilians===
Numerous abuses were reported and large information was collected through interviews by two separate reports – one by Afghanistan Justice Project and another by Human Rights Watch. The abuses largely took place after the military operation itself when forces started to establish posts and to search homes.&lt;ref name="Casting Shadows"/&gt;

The vast majority of testimony regarding the Afshar operation suggests that the abuses were largely carried out by the Ittihad forces of Abdul Rasul Sayyaf and the Jamiat forces of Ahmad Shah Massoud. Ittihad forces played a major role in the assault, working directly under Sayyaf and receiving pay from him. The Ittihad forces were not absorbed into the ministry of defense.&lt;ref name="Casting Shadows"/&gt; Sayyaf acted as the de facto general commander of Ittihad forces during the operation and was directly in touch with senior commanders by radio.&lt;ref name="Casting Shadows"/&gt;

According to reports, Wahdat soldiers as well as male Hazara citizens were being arrested and executed mostly by Ittihad forces. Unarmed civilians as well were being killed, with men in particular being targeted. Other men were abducted and taken to the base of Sayyaf's Ittihad in Paghman and made to dig trenches and bury the dead. Those who survived stated they saw on the bodies evidence of torture and mutilations. Human Rights Watch suggests that 70-80 people were killed in the streets fighting, while 700-750 people disappeared. It states that between 80-200 people were later released after ransoms were paid to Sayyaf's Ittihad commanders.

===Controversy===
John Jennings, a journalist with the AP present in Afshar during the operation around Massoud's troops, went into considerable detail to debunk allegations of a systematic [[massacre]] of civilians.&lt;ref name="Gutman_Book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gutman|first=Roy|authorlink=Roy Gutman|title=How We Missed the Story: Osama Bin Laden, the Taliban, and the Hijacking of Afghanistan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A9eqvc-Ru3cC&amp;pg=PA304|year=2008|publisher=US Institute of Peace Press|isbn=978-1-60127-024-5|page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he did leave open the possibility that some captured Wahdat fighters were summarily executed rather than being treated as POWs by troops furious at Wahdat atrocities against Kabul civilians during the preceding months. Jennings recounts entering a nearby basement where Wahdat fighters had tied up non-Hazara hostages with wire, shot them and tried to burn the bodies, before fleeing the scene ahead of Massoud's advancing troops.&lt;ref name="Gutman_Book"/&gt; Jennings also describes Ahmad Shah Massoud's followers rescuing a wounded Hazara civilian caught in the crossfire during the height of the battle. Despite these written reference — and although Jennings is quoted as a reliable source on other topics in the Human Rights Watch reports — any account of what he witnessed during and after the Afshar battle was left out by Human Rights Watch editors.&lt;ref name="Gutman_Book"/&gt;

===Islamabad Accord (March 1993)===

The Afshar campaign and the surrounding violence were ended by the Islamabad Accord between the Islamic State and Hekmatyar's alliance (including Hezb-i Wahdat) fashioned in late February 1993 and signed on March 7, 1993. There were a few weeks of relative calm. Hezb-i Wahdat ally Gulbuddin Hekmatyar took the long-offered position of prime minister in the Rabbani government.

The Islamabad Accord among other things stated:
{{quote|Having agreed to bringing armed hostilities to an end, Recognizing the need for a broad-based Islamic Government in which all parties and groups representing all segments of Muslim Afghan society are represented so that the process of political transition can be advanced in an atmosphere of peace, harmony and stability, [...] All the parties and groups concerned have agreed as follows: To the formation of a Government for a period of 18 months in which President Burhanuddin Rabbani would remain President and Eng. Gulbedin Hikmatyar or his nominee would assume the office of Prime Minister. The powers of the President and Prime Minister and his cabinet which have been formulated through mutual consultations will form part of this Accord and is annexed; The Cabinet shall be formed by the Prime Minister in consultations with the President, and leaders of Mujahideen Parties within two weeks of the signing of this Accord; [...] A cease-fire shall come into force with immediate effect. After the formation of the Cabinet, there shall be permanent cessation of hostilities.&lt;ref name="International Conflict Research Institute"&gt;{{cite web |year=1993 |url=http://incore.hq.unu.edu/services/cds/agreements/pdf/afgan1.pdf |title=Afghan Peace Accord (Islamabad Accord) |publisher=[[University of Ulster]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[Roy Gutman]] of the [[United States Institute of Peace]] wrote in ''How We Missed the Story: Osama bin Laden, the Taliban, and the Hijacking of Afghanistan'':
{{quote|Hekmatyar had become prime minister ... But after chairing one cabinet meeting, Hekmatyar never returned to the capital, fearing, perhaps, a lynching by Kabulis infuriated over his role in destroying their city. Even his close aides were embarrassed. Hekmatyar spokesman Qutbuddin Helal was still setting up shop in the prime minister's palace when the city came under Hezb[-i Islami] rocket fire late that month. "We are here in Kabul and he is rocketing us. Now we have to leave. We can't do anything," he told Massoud aides.&lt;ref name="Gutman_Book"/&gt;}}

Hekmatyar turned out afraid to enter the city (he had shelled for one year) more than once to take up his post.&lt;ref name="Gutman_Book"/&gt; He attended one cabinet meeting but by late March, unwilling to compromise with other cabinet members not belonging to his faction and while his aides were still in the prime minister's palace, Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Islami forces were again shelling Kabul.&lt;ref name="Gutman_Book"/&gt;

'''Alexandru Ioan Cuza''' ({{IPA-ro|alekˈsandru iˈo̯an ˈkuza|pron|Ro-Alexandru Ioan Cuza.ogg}}, or '''Alexandru Ioan I''', also anglicised as '''Alexander John Cuza'''; 20 March 1820 – 15 May 1873) was [[Prince of Moldavia]], [[Prince of Wallachia]], and later ''[[Domnitor]]'' (Ruler) of the [[Romanian Principalities]]. He was a prominent figure of the Revolution of 1848 in [[Moldavia]]. He initiated a series of reforms that contributed to the modernization of Romanian society and of state structures.

==Early life==
Born in [[Bârlad]], Cuza belonged to the traditional [[boyar]] class in Moldavia, being the son of [[Ispravnic]] Ioan Cuza (who was also a landowner in [[Fălciu County]]) and his wife Sultana (or Soltana), a member of the [[Cozadini family]] of [[Phanariotes|Phanariote]] origins. Alexander received an urbane European education, becoming an officer in the [[Moldavian military forces|Moldavian Army]] (rising to the rank of [[colonel]]). He married [[Elena Cuza|Elena Rosetti]] in 1844.
In 1848, known as the [[Revolutions of 1848|year of European revolutions]], Moldavia and [[Wallachia]] fell into revolt. The [[1848 Moldavian revolution|Moldavian unrest]] was quickly suppressed, but in Wallachia the revolutionaries took power and governed during the summer (''see [[1848 Wallachian revolution]]''). Young Cuza played a prominent enough part so as to establish his [[Liberalism in Romania|liberal]] credentials during the Moldavian episode and to be shipped to [[Vienna]] as a prisoner, where he made his escape with [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] support.

[[File:CuzaHuNewspaper.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Hungarian newspaper ''Vasárnapi Ujság'' commented "with sympathy and respect" (Carol C. Koka)&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://actualitateasm.ro/stiri/22661-publicatia-vasarnapi-ujsag-saluta-la-1859-dubla-alegere-a-lui-alexandru-ioan-cuza/ "Publicația Vasárnapi Ujság saluta la 1859 dubla alegere a lui Alexandru Ioan Cuza"]&lt;/ref&gt; Cuza's double election in Moldavia and Wallachia]]
Returned during the reign of [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Prince]] [[Grigore Alexandru Ghica]], he became Moldavia's minister of war in 1858 representing also [[Galați]] in the [[ad hoc Divan]] at [[Iași]]. Cuza was acting freely under the guarantees of the [[Great Power|European Powers]] in the eve of the [[Crimean War]] for a recognition of the Prince of Moldavia. Cuza was a prominent speaker in the debates and strongly advocated the union of Moldavia and Walachia. In default of a foreign prince, he was nominated as a candidate in both principalities by the pro-unionist [[Partida Națională]] (profiting of an ambiguity in the text of the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]]). Cuza was finally elected as Prince of Moldavia on 17 January 1859 (5 January [[Julian calendar|Julian]]) and, after "street pressure" changed the vote in [[Bucharest]], also Prince of Wallachia, on 5 February 1859 (24 January Julian). He received the firman from the Sultan on 2 December 1861 during a visit to Istanbul.
He was recipient of the [[Order of Medjidie]], [[Order of Osmanieh]], [[Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus]] and [[Order of the Redeemer]].

Although he and his wife [[Elena Cuza|Elena Rosetti]] had no children, she raised as her own children his two sons from his mistress [[Marija Obrenović|Elena Maria Catargiu-Obrenović]]: [[Alexandru Al. Ioan Cuza]] (1864–1889), and Dimitrie Cuza (1865–1888 ''suicide'').

==Reign==

===Diplomatic efforts===
[[File:Prince Alexandru Ioan Cuza.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Alexandru Ioan Cuza official portrait]]
[[File:RO, IS, Union Museum.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The residence of Prince Cuza in [[Iași]], one of the two capitals of the United Principalities between 1859 and 1862]]
Thus Cuza achieved a [[de facto]] union of the two principalities. The Powers backtracked, [[Napoleon III|Napoleon III of France]] remaining supportive, while the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] ministry withheld approval of such a union at the [[Congress of Paris]] (18 October 1858); partly as a consequence, Cuza's authority was not recognized by his nominal [[suzerain]], [[Abdülaziz of the Ottoman Empire|Abdülaziz]], the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], until 23 December 1861, (and, even then, the union was only accepted for the duration of Cuza's rule).

The union was formally declared three years later, on 5 February 1862, (24 January Julian), the new country bearing the name of Romania, with [[Bucharest]] as its capital city.

Cuza invested his diplomatic actions in gaining further concessions from the Powers: the sultan's assent to a [[Parliament of Romania|single unified parliament]] and [[Prime Minister of Romania|cabinet]] for Cuza's lifetime, in recognition of the complexity of the task. Thus, he was regarded as the political embodiment of a unified Romania.

===Reforms===

Assisted by his councilor [[Mihail Kogălniceanu]], an intellectual leader of the 1848 revolution, Cuza initiated a series of reforms that contributed to the modernization of Romanian society and of state structures.

[[File:StampRomania1865Michel13.JPG|thumb|left|140px|1865 stamp]] 
[[File:Portrait of Alexandru Ioan Cuza by August Strixner.png|thumb|right|140px|Cuza in the 1860s; portrait by August Strixner]]
His first measure addressed a need for increasing the land resources and revenues available to the state, by [[Secularization of monastery estates in Romania|"secularizing" (confiscating) monastic assets]] in 1863.&lt;ref name=Stoica1&gt;{{cite book|last=Stoica|first=Vasile|title=The Roumanian Question: The Roumanians and their Lands|year=1919|publisher=Pittsburgh Printing Company|location=Pittsburgh|pages=69–70|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7314/view/1/69/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Probably more than a quarter of Romania's farmland was controlled by untaxed [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] "[[Dedication|Dedicated]] Monasteries", which supported [[Greeks|Greek]] and other foreign monks in shrines such as [[Mount Athos]] and [[Jerusalem]] (a substantial drain on state revenues). Cuza got his parliament's backing to expropriate these lands. He offered compensation to the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Greek Orthodox Church]], but [[Patriarch Sophoronius III of Constantinople|Sophronius III]], the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], refused to negotiate; after several years, the Romanian government withdrew its offer and no compensation was ever paid. State revenues thereby increased without adding any domestic tax burden.
The [[Land reform in Romania|land reform]], liberating peasants from the last [[corvée]]s, freeing their movements and redistributing some land (1864), was less successful.&lt;ref name=Stoica1/&gt; In attempting to create a solid support base among the peasants, Cuza soon found himself in conflict with the group of [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880-1918)|Conservatives]]. A liberal bill granting peasants title to the land they worked was defeated. Then the Conservatives responded with a bill that ended all peasant dues and responsibilities, but gave landlords title to all the land. Cuza [[veto]]ed it, then held a [[plebiscite]] to alter the Paris Convention (the virtual [[constitution]]), in the manner of Napoleon III.

[[File:Palatul de la Ruginoasa1.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The Al.I. Cuza family residence in [[Ruginoasa, Iaşi|Ruginoasa]]]]
His plan to establish [[universal manhood suffrage]], together with the power of the Domnitor to rule by decree, passed by a vote of 682,621 to 1,307. He consequently governed the country under the provisions of ''Statutul dezvoltător al Convenției de la Paris'' ("Statute expanding the Paris Convention"), an [[Constitution of Romania|organic law]] adopted on 15 July 1864. With his new plenary powers, Cuza then promulgated the Agrarian Law of 1863. Peasants received title to the land they worked, while landlords retained ownership of one third. Where there was not enough land available to create workable farms under this formula, state lands (from the confiscated monasteries) would be used to give the landowners compensation.

Despite the attempts by [[Lascăr Catargiu]]'s cabinet to force a transition in which some corvées were to be maintained, Cuza's reform marked the disappearance of the boyar class as a [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privileged]] group, and led to a channeling of energies into [[capitalism]] and [[industrialization]]; at the same time, however, land distributed was still below necessities, and the problem became stringent over the following decades – as peasants reduced to destitution sold off their land or found that it was insufficient for the needs of their growing families.

Cuza's reforms also included the adoption of the Criminal Code and the Civil Code based on the [[Napoleonic code]] (1864), a Law on Education, establishing [[tuition]]-free, [[Compulsory education|compulsory]] [[public education]] for [[primary school]]s&lt;ref name=Stoica1/&gt; (1864; the system, nonetheless, suffered from drastic shortages in allocated funds; illiteracy was eradicated about 100 years later, during the communist regime). He founded the [[University of Iași]] (1860) and the [[University of Bucharest]] (1864), and helped develop a modern, European-style [[Romanian Army]], under a working relationship with France. He is the founder of the [[Romanian Naval Forces]].

==Downfall and exile==
[[File:Daumier30.05.1866.PNG|thumb|right|150px|A French perspective on the situation after Cuza's toppling, caricature by [[Honoré Daumier]] in ''[[Le Charivari]]'' (May 5, 1866). A character symbolising the [[Danubian Principalities]], looking on as the Foreign Powers charged with overseeing him quarrel: "Oh, my! It looks as if they are no longer taking care of me at all!"]]

Cuza failed in his effort to create an alliance of prosperous peasants and a strong liberal prince, ruling as a benevolent authoritarian in the style of Napoleon III. Having to rely on a decreasing group of hand-picked [[Bureaucracy|bureaucrats]], Cuza began facing a mounting opposition after his land reform bill, with liberal landowners voicing concerns over his ability to represent their interests. Along with financial distress, there was an awkward scandal that revolved around his mistress, [[Marija Obrenović|Maria Catargiu-Obrenović]], and popular discontent culminated in a [[coup d'état]].

Cuza was forced to abdicate by the so-called "[[monstrous coalition]]" of Conservatives and Liberals. At four o'clock on the morning of 22 February 1866, a group of military conspirators broke into the palace, and compelled the prince to sign his [[abdication]]. On the following day they conducted him safely across the frontier.

His successor, Prince [[Carol I of Romania|Karl of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]], was proclaimed Domnitor as Carol I of Romania on 20 April 1866. The election of a foreign prince with ties to an important princely house, legitimizing Romanian independence (which Carol came to do after the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877–1878|Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878]]), had been one of the liberal aims in the revolution of 1848.

Despite the participation of [[Ion Brătianu]] and other future leaders of the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|Liberal Party]] in the overthrow of Cuza, he remained a hero to the [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] and [[Republicanism|republican]] wing, who, as [[Francophile]]s, had an additional reason to oppose a [[Prussia]]n monarch; anti-Carol riots in Bucharest during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (''see [[History of Bucharest]]'') and the coup attempt known as the [[Republic of Ploiești]] in August 1870, the conflict was eventually resolved by the compromise between Brătianu and Carol, with the arrival of a prolonged and influential Liberal cabinet.

Cuza spent the remainder of his life in exile, chiefly in [[Paris]], [[Vienna]] and [[Wiesbaden]], accompanied by his wife, his mistress, and his two sons. He died in [[Heidelberg]]. His remains were buried in his residence in [[Ruginoasa, Iaşi|Ruginoasa]], but were moved to the [[Trei Ierarhi Monastery|Trei Ierarhi Cathedral]] in Iași after [[World War II]].

== Personal life ==

He was born to Boghos Derounian and Eliza Aprahamian in Dedeagach, [[Adrianople Vilayet]], [[Ottoman Empire]] (today [[Alexandroupoli]], [[Greece]]). The [[Balkan Wars]] and [[First World War]] had an unsettling effect on the entire region, and his hometown repeatedly changed hands. The family moved several times, spending time in [[Turkey]] and [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]], where his brother [[Steven Derounian]] (who later became a Republican Representative) was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Austin man remembered for honesty in 'Quiz Show' |work=Austin American-Statesman|first=Lee|last=Kelly|date=November 5, 1994|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?s_hidethis=no&amp;p_product=AASB&amp;p_theme=aasb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=derounian&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=(derounian)&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no&lt;!-- this is just for proof of existence. for the full text see Factiva --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the family emigrated to the United States, settling in [[Mineola, New York]]. He went on to study at [[New York University]]'s School of Journalism. Later, he married Marie Nazarian and had a daughter named Elyse and a son named Robert.

He died of a heart attack on April 23, 1991, while researching at the library of the [[American Jewish Committee]] on East 56th Street.

== Undercover work ==

In 1933, Archbishop [[Leon Tourian]] was assassinated at the altar of his New York church.  The assassins were members of the [[Dashnaks]], a radical Armenian group who accused the Archbishop of treason to the Armenian national cause. Deeply shocked, Derounian spent the rest of his life opposing the Dashnaks as well as other violent radicals - in particular, fighting fascism and all forms of racism.

During the [[1948 Israeli-Arab War]], Derounian also infiltrated among the Arabs fighting the newborn [[Israel]], travelling extensively in the Arab parts of the expiring [[Mandatory Palestine]] as well as in Egypt and Syria. He took a highly partisan position on the [[Israeli-Arab Conflict]], stating at the conclusion of his book "Cairo to Damascus" that ''"In the simplest of terms, Israel, as I saw it, represented Good; the Arab world represented Evil".&lt;ref&gt;"Cairo to Damascus"'' Ch. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

==="The Plotters" ===

==="UnderCover"===
''"Under Cover: My Four Years in the Nazi Underworld of America - The Amazing Revelation of How Axis Agents and Our Enemies Within Are Now Plotting To Destroy the United States"'' became a best seller when published in 1943.

Derounian was a tireless investigator of subversive activity, and infiltrated numerous "patriotic" groups, some of which he listed in the opening of his book ''Under Cover'': [[German American Bund]], [[Christian Front (United States)|Christian Front]], [[American Freedom Party|American Nationalist Party]], [[American Women Against Communism]], [[The Gray Shirts]], [[America First Committee]], [[Christian Mobilizers]],  [[The American Defense Society]], [[Anglo-Saxon Federation of America]], [[National Workers League]], [[Yankee Freemen]], [[George Sylvester Viereck|Flanders Hall]], [[Patriot Party (1960s-1980s)|American Patriots]] among many others.

Among the groups he also helped expose was the international Nazi propaganda news agency [[Ulrich Fleischhauer|''World-Service'']].

He was also the chief investigator of the [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] organization, [[Friends of Democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1947/07/26/1947_07_26_028_TNY_CARDS_000209522

|quote=One of Friends of Democracy most fruitful accomplishments has been discovering a man named Avedis Derounian, better known by his pen name of John Roy Carlson.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech Representative [[Arthur G. Klein]] attempted to give in the [[US House of Representatives|US House]] in 1944 and which was printed in ''[[The Nation]],'' Klein praises Derounian's book ''Under Cover'':
{{Block quote|They (Americans) fail to understand, for instance, the reasons for and the character of the attack on John Roy Carlson, whose book, ''Under Cover'' has opened the eyes of so many to the existence of subversive propaganda and propagandists in our own midst.  They are puzzled that the broad and profound values of the book should be overlooked and thrust aside because of trivialities.....For the issues that are treated in the book, the revelations that are made, and their high average of accuracy are far too important for light dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;''The Nation'' April 26, 1944. pg 3&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Lawsuits related to ''Under Cover'' ====
This expose made him enemies, and several parties instituted actions against him for alleged libelous material. Three of the four cases failed the consolidated case before the jury, leaving a verdict in favor only of lawyer Jeremiah Stokes, which was later overturned. The lawsuit claimed that Derounian had held Stokes up for ridicule. Stokes is first mentioned on page 365 of ''Under Cover'', and his patriotism questioned in the next chapter, which begins:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I was in the room alone with two men.  The one who had pumped both my hands in welcome was a small round man with a bald dome and rotund face. He had small, beady eyes and he peered at you from  behind rimmed glasses.  He was definitely of the  single-track, uncompromising zealot type. Jeremiah Stokes had  let his law practice slide and was devoting the major portion of his time to the writing of "patriotic" tracts.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Derounian appealed; the appellate court reversed the district court and remanded the matter, stating in the overview:&lt;ref name=stokes&gt;Derounian v. Stokes, No. 3526, UNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS, TENTH CIRCUIT, 168 F.2d 305; 1948 U.S. App. LEXIS 3253, May 11, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The court found error in the submission to the jury of a physical description of the individual as small and rotund in stature, bald, round of face, and having small and beady eyes. The description of the individual was not reasonably calculated to subject him to public ridicule. It was error to submit to the jury ridicule of personal appearance as an element of damages.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==="Cairo to Damascus"===

[[File:Arab Legion soldier in ruins of Hurva.jpg|thumb|Arab Legion soldier in ruins of Hurva - photo by Arthur Derounian ("John Roy Carlson") in ''Cairo to Damascus'']]
Shortly after the publication of ''Under Cover'', Derounian as ''John Roy Carlson'' set himself with an assignment: to go undercover again and investigate the collaboration of Nazi and antisemitic people and organizations with the Arabs in the civil war that broke out in Palestine after the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|UN resolution to partition the country]], a war that would be the early stage of the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]].

He decided to travel to Palestine in 1947 via England and Egypt, to chronicle the war. Traveling with his camera, he documented what he saw and the material for this adventure became his book ''Cairo to Damascus'', published in 1951.

During his investigation, Carlson covered, not just the original subject, but many other aspects of the war.  Throughout the war, Carlson didn't travel with the Western journalists.  He traveled with Arabs, posing as an anti-Semitic, pro-Nazi, pro-Arab sympathizer in order to win their confidences. In general, everywhere he visited in the Arab world, Carlson presented extreme anti-Jewish views, whereby he could hear from his conversation partners, be it Arab civilians and military men, Nazi-German mercenaries or the Grand Mufti's Bosnian volunteers, their extreme views and their aspiration to put an end to Jewish existence in Palestine. He travelled between the two sides, crossing the hot zone in the midst of armed conflict, while in the Jewish side of Jerusalem, he identified himself with his true identity, as the writer of ''Under Cover''.

Carlson was an eye-witness to the pull-out of the British troops, the activities of the [[Haganah]], and the hand-over to the [[United Nations]] forces.  He observed first-hand the activities of the [[Arab Legion]] trained and armed by the British and the battle for the state of Israel.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In January 1948, Carlson arrived in London, where he presented himself as Charles L. Morey, "sales manager of the Homestead Farm Appliance Corporation, with offices and plant in St. John, Indiana" - an identity he had used already in 1945, in his correspondence with "every British hate-monger and anti-democrat" he read or heard about.&lt;ref&gt;John Roy Carlson, ''Cairo to Damascus'', pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; In London he met with British Fascists who supported [[Oswald Mosley]] as well as mercenaries that were about to join the Arabs and fight alongside with them.

Carlson left London and reached Cairo on March 2, 1948. When he tried to take photographs in the city, he was detained by the police under the suspicion of being a Jewish spy. On their way to the police station, Carlson and the two policemen were followed by a crowd yelling "Jew!". When Carlson turned around and shouted "I am an American!", he was yelled back: "Then you are worse than a Jew!".&lt;ref&gt;John Roy Carlson, ''Cairo to Damascus'', pp. 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt; In Cairo he met with members of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] and got them to talk about their hatred towards Jews.

On April 1, 1948, Carlson left Cairo accompanying the Egyptian "Green Shirts" volunteers as a photographer. They entered Palestine through [[Rafah]]. Not far from [[Be'er Sheba]], Carlson saw for the first time a Jewish communal settlement – [[Kibbutz]] [[Beit Eshel]] - "contrasted sharply with the squalor of Arab villages".&lt;ref&gt;John Roy Carlson, ''Cairo to Damascus'', p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Through [[Hebron]], the men reached [[Jerusalem]]. Carlson accompanied the Arab fighters, moving between different points of conflict. On April 13, 1948, the [[Hadassah medical convoy massacre]] took place, after which Carlson says the Arabs claimed "they had been falsely informed of large concentrations of Jewish bands gathering near the Hospital and University." When asked who had informed them, the Arabs of Aboutor answered: "The English!".&lt;ref&gt;John Roy Carlson, ''Cairo to Damascus'', p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlson went with his friends back to Egypt in order to purchase more weapons. On their way they passed very near [[Kfar Etzion]], where he witnessed a battle between the Arab Legion and the Jewish Kibbutz.&lt;ref&gt;John Roy Carlson, ''Cairo to Damascus'', p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; On their way back from Egypt to Palestine, the volunteer fighters' truck drove near the ruins of Kibbutz [[Kfar Darom]], towards [[Gaza City]]. On the beach, a member of the city council said to Carlson: "See that water? One month from now it will be black as far as the horizon with the nude bodies of floating Jews."&lt;ref&gt;John Roy Carlson, ''Cairo to Damascus'', p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;  Carlson and his friends proceeded to Jerusalem, during a wave of Arab defeats all over the country.  In his book, Carlson is referring to the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|Palestinian exodus]] that followed those defeats: "This flight-psychosis, which prevailed among the Arabs ... is a difficult phenomenon to explain.  It was a mass hysteria induced by poor morale and by fear of revenge and retribution for the Arab massacres and lootings from 1920 on."&lt;ref&gt;John Roy Carlson, ''Cairo to Damascus'', p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlson claims the Arab Legion was seen in Gaza, Hebron and Jerusalem, while the British formally stated that "all units of the Arab Legion had left Palestine for [[Jordan|Trans-Jordan]] prior to the end of [[Mandatory Palestine|the Mandate]]". On the night of the May 14 - the night before the [[Israeli declaration of independence]], Carlson saw [[Gush Etzion]] burning down. His good friend Moustafa told him that night: "Every Arab knows that we will be in [[Tel Aviv]] one month from tomorrow. We will sit in the cafes by the sea, drink coffee...eat [[baklawa]] and enjoy the Jewish girls!"&lt;ref&gt;John Roy Carlson, ''Cairo to Damascus'', pp. 239–240.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlson decided to cross to the Jewish part of Jerusalem, so he could "be with the Jews on the first day of the new Jewish State". Holding a small American flag he crossed just in time to cover the departure of [[Alan Cunningham]], the [[High Commissioners for Palestine and Transjordan]].&lt;ref&gt;John Roy Carlson, ''Cairo to Damascus'', pp. 245–246.&lt;/ref&gt;  He experienced the siege of the Jewish part of Jerusalem from within, and depicted the inhabitants' hardships, shortage, hunger, continuous bombardment and grief over the dead.

Carlson went back and forth between the Jewish and the Arab sides. He met [[Abdullah el-Tell]], the commander of the Arab Legion in Jerusalem, and under his protection he witnessed the fall of the [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem]] and the evacuation of its Jewish inhabitants on May 28, 1948, after a siege that lasted six months.&lt;ref&gt;John Roy Carlson, ''Cairo to Damascus'', pp. 325-337.&lt;/ref&gt; He also took the chance to take a photograph of King [[Abdullah I of Jordan]] when he came to Jerusalem just after the Jewish surrender.&lt;ref&gt;John Roy Carlson, ''Cairo to Damascus'', p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlson then visited [[Bethlehem]], [[Jericho]], [[Amman]] and [[Damascus]], where he met with pro-Nazi Arab circles who admired the German [[Führer]], and introduced him to a German Nazi with whom he raised a glass and toasted "Heil Hitler".&lt;ref&gt;John Roy Carlson, ''Cairo to Damascus'', p. 398.&lt;/ref&gt; In Damascus, Carlson managed to be accepted for a short interview with [[Haj Amin al-Husseini]].&lt;ref&gt;John Roy Carlson, ''Cairo to Damascus'', pp. 408–409.&lt;/ref&gt; Carlson's last visit in the Arab side of the conflict was to [[Beirut]], the capitol of [[Lebanon]], which astonished him with its modernity in comparison to the simplicity of Amman and Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;John Roy Carlson, ''Cairo to Damascus'', p. 425.&lt;/ref&gt; In Beirut, he met with Christians who were aspiring to democracy and some of them even dared to express pro-Zionist views.&lt;ref&gt;John Roy Carlson, ''Cairo to Damascus'', pp. 427-429.&lt;/ref&gt;  His attempt to interview [[Fawzi al-Qawuqji]] failed, when Qawuqji decided to leave angrily after being asked about his lies about his victories and his sojourn in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;John Roy Carlson, ''Cairo to Damascus'', pp. 432-423.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlson's journey amongst the Arabs ended when, through [[Nicosia]], he reached [[Haifa]] on a ship along with 280 Jewish [[displaced persons]], [[Holocaust survivors]] from the [[Cyprus internment camps]]. He made a comprehensive tour in Israel, by his own, without any official guidance,&lt;ref&gt;John Roy Carlson, ''Cairo to Damascus'', pp. 450–451.&lt;/ref&gt; a tour that affected him deeply and brought a comparison between the national revival of the Jewish People and a possible such revival of the Armenians:
{{quote |Israel proved, too, a sentimental homeland for me. For two thousand years the Jews had dreamed of independence; for a thousand years the Armenians have dreamed of a sovereign, democratic homeland, to which one might come and go freely. I thrilled vicariously at the good fortune of Israel. Had not the Armenians suffered under the Turks, though to a lesser degree, as the Jews under Hitler? How similar the tortured background of these two ancient peoples, how common their yearning for liberty ... How natural, then, for one of Armenian birth to find inspiration in Israel! As I moved and dreamed from one end of Israel to the other, in my mind's eye I found myself substituting Armenian for Hebrew characters in the alphabet. I saw an Armenian democracy; I read Armenian newspapers. I saw Armenians creatively at work, consumed with the energy of a liberated people. I saw Armenia being rebuilt".&lt;ref&gt;John Roy Carlson, ''Cairo to Damascus'', pp. 457-458.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On his way back from Israel in November 1948, Carlson visited his birthplace, [[Alexandropolis]], [[Greece]]. At the end of his journey he flew from [[Athens]] back to the United States.

In 1952, the book was translated to Hebrew by journalist Shalom Rosenfeld and published by the Ahisasaf Publishing House (הוצאה לאור אחיאסף) of Jerusalem.

'''Cheppudira Muthana Poonacha''' usually referred to as C. M. Poonacha was Chief Minister of [[Coorg]], Minister in [[Mysore]] State, [[Member of Parliament]] ([[Rajya Sabha]] and [[Lok Sabha]]), Union Railway Minister of India and Governor of Madhya Pradesh and Orissa.

==Freedom Movement==
C. M. Poonacha was a descendant of the Coorg [[Diwan (title)|Dewan]]s. During the Freedom Movement he was sentenced to imprisonment twice during the Salt [[Satyagraha]] in 1932 and 1933. He was again imprisoned in 1940–41. and in 1942–44. He became a member of All-India Congress Committee in 1938. Also, in 1938 he was elected to Coorg District Board, became its President in 1941 and in 1945 he was elected to Coorg Legislative Council. From 1945 to 1951 he was leader of the Congress Legislative Party in the Council. He hence became a prominent member of the [[Indian National Congress]] party in [[Coorg]].

==Politics==
In 1947 [[Coorg State|Coorg]] was a separate state in South [[India]] until 1956. The other states of South India at that time were Bombay Presidency, Madras Presidency, Mysore kingdom, Travancore kingdom, Cochin kingdom and Hyderabad kingdom. The Coorg State Assembly had a strength of 24 members and the Cabinet consisted of just two members.

===Constituent Assembly Member (Constitution of India)===
C M Poonacha represented the Coorg state as a member of the Constituent Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N1ZEqWRk7HsC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=hindu+c+m+poonacha&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=G6p3ZWIbdL&amp;sig=woiu9uKU9-Tfl7IN5E-6CEUwNIA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=k5chVJm7FY2QuASS4oG4CA&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwDQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hindu%20c%20m%20poonacha&amp;f=false |title=Dr. Rajendra Prasad, Correspondence and Select Documents: Volume Seventeen ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.in |date= |accessdate=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chief Minister (Coorg)===
Two parties fought the 1952 state elections: the Takkadi ('Scales of Justice') party under veteran Gandhian Pandyanda Belliappa, who was a dominant political force and voice of Coorg with its anti-merger plank, and the Congress under C.M. Poonacha in Coorg. Poonacha was elected Chief Minister of [[Coorg State]] (1952–56) in the first general elections. Coorg had two MPs in the Union Parliament then, besides having a state legislative body.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hindu.com/2008/04/29/stories/2008042958480300.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922090129/https://www.hindu.com/2008/04/29/stories/2008042958480300.htm |date=22 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956 the State Reorganisation Act was passed. Coorg was merged with Mysore and the legislative body at Mercara dissolved. While the Chief Minister was C.M. Poonacha, (who also held the finance portfolio), the only other Minister was Home Minister, Kittur Mallappa. C.M. Poonacha had won the Beriathnad seat while K. Mallappa won the second seat from Sanivarasante.&lt;ref name="thehindu1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/from-a-princely-state-to-two-assembly-segments/article1247754.ece |title=From a princely State to two Assembly segments - KARNATAKA |publisher=The Hindu |date=2008-04-29 |accessdate=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Congress won 15 seats and Independents (opposing merger), represented by the Takkadi party, won nine seats. Under various circumstances Coorg was merged with the then Mysore in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kodagu-fighting-to-maintain-its-existence/article5930024.ece |title=Kodagu fighting to maintain its existence - ANDHRA PRADESH |publisher=The Hindu |date=2014-04-20 |accessdate=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This election was widely controversial as it was believed that many people from nearby districts of Hunsur, Mysore and Mandya were brought to Kodagu to vote as the government of Karnataka(Congress) believed people of Kodagu will vote overwhelmingly in opposition of the merger. The head of State was the Chief Commissioner, Colonel Dayasingh Bedi. As the governor’s equivalent, Colonel Bedi was presiding over the meetings of the Cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/coorg-and-the-reorganisation-of-states/article5253017.ece |title=Coorg and the reorganisation of States - NATIONAL |publisher=The Hindu |date=2013-10-20 |accessdate=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harish Ramaswamy|title=Karnataka Government and Politics|page=383|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UM3LjKo8Uo8C&amp;pg=PA383&amp;dq=c+m+poonacha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yJchVNLCCYzhuQT-_ICYDQ&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=c%20m%20poonacha&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State Minister (Mysore)===
Kodagu was, amidst protests, merged with the then Mysore State in 1956. The 1951 pattern of voting continued in 1957 when elections were held for the two Assembly constituencies in Kodagu –  Virajpet and Madikeri. Poonacha of the INC was re-elected from Madikeri. He defeated Kolera Karumbayya of the Praja Socialist Party.&lt;ref name="thehindu1"/&gt;

After the formation of the new Mysore State Poonacha was Minister for Home and Industries under its Chief Minister [[S. Nijalingappa]]. He was also Chairman, State Trading Corporation of India from 1959 to 1963. He led the Government of India Trade delegation to some East European countries in 1960 and was the leader of the State Trading Corporation delegation to Japan in 1961.

===Central Minister===
Poonacha was elected to the [[Rajya Sabha]] in April 1964. Later Poonacha was made Union Minister without portfolio in Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru's cabinet. From 1 to 24 January 1966, he was Minister of State in the Ministry of Finance and from 25 January 1966 to 12 March 1967 Minister of State in the Ministry of Transport, Aviation, Shipping and Tourism. He contested and won the [[Lok Sabha]] seat for the [[Mangalore (Lok Sabha constituency)|Mangalore]] constituency in 1969. He contested again in 1971 as a candidate of [[Indian National Congress (Organisation)|NCO]] party, but lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kodagu-goes-to-ls-polls-with-mysore-for-first-time/article302942.ece |title=Kodagu goes to LS polls with Mysore for first time - KARNATAKA |publisher=The Hindu |date=2009-04-12 |accessdate=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Janak Raj Jai|title=Commissions and Omissions by Indian Prime Ministers, Volume 1|page=115|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Wrc1K0uJTgC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=c+m+poonacha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yJchVNLCCYzhuQT-_ICYDQ&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=c%20m%20poonacha&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kuldeep Mathur, James Warner Bjorkman|title=Top Policy Makers in India: Cabinet Ministers and Their Civil Service Advisors|page=84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kCx4gxkkbiQC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=c+m+poonacha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yJchVNLCCYzhuQT-_ICYDQ&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwCg#v=onepage&amp;q=c%20m%20poonacha&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Union Railway Minister===
After some time he became Union Minister for Railways from 1967 to 1969 (at first interim and then final) and Minister for Steel and Heavy Engineering in 1969. At that time he was the Member of Parliament representing [[Mangalore (Lok Sabha constituency)|Mangalore]] [[Lok Sabha]] constituency to which Coorg then belonged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irfca.org/docs/railway-ministers.html |title=[IRFCA&amp;#93; Railway Ministers |publisher=Irfca.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/uploads/directorate/finance_budget/Previous%20Budget%20Speeches/1967-68_interim.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/uploads/directorate/finance_budget/Previous%20Budget%20Speeches/1968-69.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2334">'''Canum Hodja Mehmed Pasha''' (also known as '''Canım Hoca''' in European sources) was an 18th-century [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] admiral who served three times as ''[[Kapudan Pasha]]'' (grand admiral of the [[Ottoman Navy]]).

Originally a Muslim from the fortress town of [[Koroni]] in the southwestern [[Peloponnese]] (in southern [[Greece]]), Canum Hodja Mehmed was captured by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] during the [[Morean War]] (1684–1699) and served seven years as a [[galley slave]] in the Venetian fleet, until ransomed for 100 [[gold ducat]]s.&lt;ref name="Setton428"&gt;Setton (1991), p. 428&lt;/ref&gt; He entered his first term as ''Kapudan Pasha'' in December 1714, upon the outbreak of the [[Ottoman–Venetian War (1714–18)|war with Venice]]. He distinguished himself in this war through the capture of [[Tinos]],&lt;ref name="Setton428"/&gt; as well as for his humane treatment of the Venetian captives in the [[Morea]], in stark contrast to the brutal behaviour of the [[Grand Vizier]], [[Silahdar Damat Ali Pasha]].&lt;ref&gt;Setton (1991), pp. 431–432&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Action of 8 July 1716|battle fought on 8 July 1716]], he led the Ottoman fleet in the failed attempt to capture [[Corfu]], the chief of the [[Ionian Islands]], then under [[Ionian Islands under Venetian rule|Venetian rule]].&lt;ref&gt;Setton (1991), pp. 441–442&lt;/ref&gt;

Dismissed from his post in February 1717, he regained it for a few days in 1730, and became once more ''Kapudan Pasha'' in 1732, holding the post until 1736.&lt;ref name="Setton428"/&gt;

'''Edward Lodewijk Van Halen''' (born January 26, 1955) is a [[Dutch Americans|Dutch-American]] musician, songwriter, and producer. He is the main songwriter and founder — with drummer [[Alex Van Halen]], bassist [[Mark Stone (musician) |Mark Stone]]&lt;!--- Stone was the band's founding bassist. Mike Anthony joined later. Please don't change this to read "Mike Anthony"---&gt;, and singer [[David Lee Roth]] — of the American [[hard rock]] band [[Van Halen]].

In 2011, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked Van Halen number eight in the list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/eddie-van-halen-20111122|title=100 Greatest Guitarists|publisher=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, he was voted number one in a ''[[Guitar World]]'' magazine reader's poll for "The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/readers-poll-results-100-greatest-guitarists-all-time#slide-99 |title=Readers Poll Results: The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time |publisher=Guitar World |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early life===
Born in [[Amsterdam]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.delpher.nl/nl/kranten/view?coll=ddd&amp;identifier=ABCDDD:010830689:mpeg21:a0195|title=Het Parool, geboorteregister van Amsterdam: Edward L. van Halen|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Netherlands, Edward Lodewijk van Halen is the son of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] father, [[Jan van Halen]], a clarinetist, saxophonist, and pianist, and Indonesian-born [[Indo people|Indo]] ([[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]]) mother, Eugenia van Halen ({{née}} van Beers).&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Dodds, Edward Van Halen: A Definitive Biography, 2011, p.2 "Thus was born a Eurasian woman in 1914 with the markedly Dutch name of Eugenia van Beers in the [[Dutch East Indies]]."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vimeo"&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff|url=https://vimeo.com/36240409|title=VH Interviews on Vimeo|publisher=Vimeo.com|date=February 5, 2012|accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Halen's middle name, "Lodewijk", is after composer [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], "Lodewijk" being the Dutch equivalent of "Ludwig". He continued this tradition by naming his son [[Wolfgang Van Halen|Wolfgang]] after composer [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]].

In February 1962, the family moved to the United States, settling in [[Pasadena, California]].&lt;ref name="vimeo"/&gt; Both Eddie and his older brother, [[Alex van Halen|Alex]], are [[Naturalization|naturalized]] U.S. citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Christopher|first=Michael|date=February 6, 2015|title=Rock Music Menu: Eddie Van Halen set for Smithsonian talk|url=http://www.delcotimes.com/article/DC/20150206/NEWS/150209755|newspaper=Delaware County Daily Times|location=Upper Darby Township, PA|access-date=February 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brothers learned to play the piano as children starting at the age of six.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Q&amp;A: Eddie Van Halen|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/eddie-van-halen-19980416|accessdate=2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="All Music Guide - Eddie Van Halen"&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p133912|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic.org]; accessed December 1, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

They commuted from Pasadena to [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]] to study with an elderly man, [[:lt:Stasys Kalvaitis|Stasys (Stanley) Kalvaitis]]&lt;ref name="van-halen.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.van-halen.com/video/vh-interviews|title=VH Interviews|publisher=van-halen.com|accessdate=2014-07-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723175023/http://www.van-halen.com/video/vh-interviews|archivedate=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; who taught them classical piano. Although they hated the commute, they continued as their mother would discipline them if they refused to go.

Van Halen revealed in an interview that he was never able to read music. Instead, he learned from watching and listening. During recitals of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] or Mozart, he would improvise. From 1964 through 1967, he won first place in the annual piano competition held at [[Long Beach City College]].&lt;ref name="van-halen.com"/&gt; Afterward, the judges would comment that he had an interesting interpretation of the classical piece. Van Halen's view was, "What? I thought I was playing it correctly!"  However, according to one interview, playing the piano did not prove to be challenging or interesting to him.&lt;ref name="obrecht"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jasobrecht.com/eddie-van-halen-complete-1978-interviews|title=Transcript of interview with Jas Obrecht|website=jasobrecht.com|accessdate=June 1, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111022020333/http://jasobrecht.com/eddie-van-halen-complete-1978-interviews/|archivedate=October 22, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, while Alex began playing the guitar, Eddie bought a drum kit and began practicing for hours every day.

After Eddie heard Alex's performance of [[The Surfaris]]' [[drum solo]] in the song ''[[Wipe Out (Surfaris song)|Wipe Out]]'', he decided to switch instruments and began learning how to play the electric guitar. According to Eddie, as a teen, he would often practice while walking around at home with his guitar strapped on or sitting in his room for hours with the door locked.&lt;ref name="lick-library"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eddie Van Halen Birthday Special|url=http://www.licklibrary.com/newsletters/issue114-uk.html|work=Lick Library|accessdate=October 26, 2013|date=January 2010|issue=114|quote=[...] However, when Alex started to then learn to play drums, overtaking Eddie's own abilities, the younger of the two switched to guitar instantly becoming attached to it &amp;ndash; locking himself away in his bedroom as a teen to practice, and walking around the house with his guitar strapped on yet unplugged.

Eddie Van Halen acknowledged the importance of supergroup [[Cream (band)|Cream]]'s "[[I'm So Glad]]" on ''[[Goodbye (Cream album)|Goodbye Cream]]'' to be "mind-blowing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aolradio.slacker.com|title=AOL Radio Stations|first=Slacker|last=Inc|website=AOL Radio|accessdate=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He once claimed that he had learned almost all of [[Eric Clapton]]'s solos in the band Cream "...note for note."  "I've always said Eric Clapton was my main influence," Van Halen said, "but [[Jimmy Page]] was actually more the way I am, in a reckless-abandon kind of way."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classicvanhalen.com/bios_evh.shtml Classicvanhalen.com], Guitar World Interview (February 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

Eddie and Alex formed their first band with three other boys, calling themselves ''The Broken Combs'', performing at lunchtime at Hamilton Elementary School in Pasadena, where Eddie was in the fourth grade. Eddie would later say that this was when he first felt the desire to become a professional musician.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|UOTidtqG-Ko|Van Halen 2012 Interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation of Van Halen==

[[File:Eddie Van Halan - 77 in New Haven.jpg|thumb|upright|Van Halen in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], 1978.]]
In 1972, Van Halen formed another band, originally called "Genesis". The name was changed to "Mammoth" when Van Halen became aware of the English [[progressive rock]] band [[Genesis (band)|of the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=15 Years On: Eddie Van Halen Interview Revisted|url=http://www.vhnd.com/2013/07/08/15-years-on-eddie-van-halen-interview-revisted|website=Van Halen News Desk|accessdate=December 5, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130711064101/http://www.vhnd.com/2013/07/08/15-years-on-eddie-van-halen-interview-revisted/|archivedate=July 11, 2013|date=July 8, 2013|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mammoth consisted of Van Halen on guitar and lead vocals, his brother Alex on drums and bass guitarist [[Mark Stone (musician)|Mark Stone]]. Mammoth had no [[Public address|P.A. system]] of their own, so they rented one from [[David Lee Roth]],&lt;ref name="guitarcom"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Obrecht|first=Jas|date=July 23, 1978|title=A Legend is Born: Eddie Van Halen's First Interview|periodical=Guitar.com|url=//www.guitarplayer.com/archive/artists/vanhalen.shtml|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000819115344/http://www.guitarplayer.com/archive/artists/vanhalen.shtml|archivedate=August 19, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; a service for which he charged by the night. Van Halen became frustrated with singing lead vocals,&lt;ref name="guitarcom"/&gt; and decided they could save money by adding Roth to the band.&lt;ref name="guitarcom"/&gt; Soon after, [[Michael Anthony (musician)|Michael Anthony]] replaced Stone on the bass guitar. The band opted to change its name because Roth suggested that the last name of the two brothers "sounded cool".{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

At one point, the band considered using the name "Rat Salade", after the [[Black Sabbath]] [[Rat Salad|song of the same name]], before settling on "Van Halen".&lt;ref name="Roll 2001"&gt;Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll, 3rd Edition, 2001, Rolling Stone Press, U.S. pg.1028&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Van Halen facts, information, pictures|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/people/literature-and-arts/music-popular-and-jazz-biographies/van-halen#C|website=encyclopedia.com|accessdate=December 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band originally began playing [[Cover version|cover material]], ranging from [[Pop music|pop]] to [[disco]].&lt;ref name="Roll 2001"/&gt;

In 1976, band supporter [[Rodney Bingenheimer]] invited [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] bass guitarist [[Gene Simmons]] to check out a Van Halen show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whiskyagogo.com/articles/770104.html|title=WHISKY ARTICLES|publisher=Whisky A-Go-Go|accessdate=December 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impressed, Simmons soon produced a Van Halen [[Demo (music)|demo tape]] with recording beginning at the [[The Village (studio)|Village Recorder]] studios in Los Angeles and finishing with [[Overdubbing|overdubs]] at the [[Electric Lady Studios]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Everybody Wants Some: The Van Halen Saga by Ian Christie, {{ISBN|978-0-470-03910-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking to strike a [[recording contract]], Simmons shopped the demo tape around, but found no success. In May 1977 at the [[Starwood (nightclub)|Starwood]], Van Halen was spotted by record producer [[Ted Templeman]]. Like Simmons, Templeman was impressed and quickly convinced [[Warner Bros. Records]] executive [[Mo Ostin]] to sign the band, and they accepted 24 hours later. Their [[Van Halen (album)|self-titled debut album]] was recorded in mid-September to early October 1977, and was released on February 10, 1978.

===David Lee Roth Era===
Van Halen released a total of six albums with vocalist David Lee Roth: ''[[Van Halen (album)|Van Halen]]'' (1978), ''[[Van Halen II]]'' (1979), ''[[Women and Children First]]'' (1980), ''[[Fair Warning (Van Halen album)|Fair Warning]]'' (1981), ''[[Diver Down]]'' (1982), and ''[[1984 (Van Halen album)|1984]]'' (1984).

In the early 1980s, the band began having increasing trouble working together as a cohesive unit. According to Gene Simmons' book ''Kiss and Make-Up'', Eddie Van Halen approached Simmons in 1982 about possibly joining Kiss to replace [[Ace Frehley]], chiefly because of his personality conflicts with Roth. Simmons and Alex Van Halen persuaded Eddie to remain in Van Halen, while Kiss replaced Frehley with [[Vinnie Vincent]].

Shortly afterwards, Van Halen released the album ''[[1984 (Van Halen album)|1984]]'', from which the single "[[Jump (Van Halen song)|Jump]]", was their first and only #1 single on the [[''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Other singles released from the album performed well, particularly "[[Hot for Teacher]]", the video for which featured a scantily dressed model playing the part of a female elementary school teacher and young actors portraying the band members as children. The album peaked at #2 on the [[Billboard charts]], behind only [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]''.

Jimmy Page said at the time, "For my money, Van Halen was the first significant new kid on the block. Very dazzling."&lt;ref&gt;Zlozower, Neil. ''Van Halen: A visual history: 1978–1984'' (2008)&lt;!-- publisher, ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Van Halen was invited by producer [[Quincy Jones]] to contribute the guitar solo for Michael Jackson's single, "[[Beat It]]", but reportedly declined any payment for the recording, deeming a credit on the album sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/30/showbiz/music/van-halen-jackson-thriller/index.html|title=Eddie Van Halen deconstructs his collaboration on 'Beat It'|first=By Denise Quan|last=CNN|publisher=CNN|date=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sammy Hagar Era===
[[File:Eddie Van Halen (1993).jpg|thumb|Van Halen at the [[45th Primetime Emmy Awards|45th Emmy Awards]], 1993.]]
With the arrival of former [[Montrose (band)|Montrose]] singer [[Sammy Hagar]] in July 1985, the band's sound changed somewhat to adapt to the strengths of the new vocalist. Eddie Van Halen's keyboard playing became more prominent, as heard in songs such as "[[Dreams (Van Halen song)|Dreams]]" and "[[Love Walks In]]". Hagar appeared on four studio albums with the band, ''[[5150 (album)|5150]]'' (1986), ''[[OU812]]'' (1988), ''[[For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge]]'' (1991), and ''[[Balance (Van Halen album)|Balance]]'' (1995), as well as one live album, ''[[Live: Right Here, Right Now]] ''(1993).

During Hagar's time with the band, some fans informally referred to the band as "Van Hagar" to distinguish it from the David Lee Roth lineup. With Hagar, all four studio releases reached No. 1 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] charts. ''For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge'' was awarded the [[34th Annual Grammy Awards|1992]] [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Performance with Vocal]]. The live album ''Live: Right Here, Right Now'' peaked at No. 5.

===Gary Cherone Era===
Following Hagar's departure, the group briefly reunited with original singer David Lee Roth and released ''[[Best Of – Volume I (Van Halen album)|Best Of – Volume I]]'', a greatest-hits package, in October 1996. Two new songs were recorded for the album, "[[Me Wise Magic]]"—which reached No. 1 on the [[mainstream rock]] chart as a single—and "[[Can't Get This Stuff No More]]". However, previous disagreements resurfaced and the reunion did not last.  Roth left in September 1996 after the [[MTV Video Music Award]]s.

The band auditioned many prospective replacements for Hagar, finally settling on [[Gary Cherone]], former frontman of Boston hard rock band [[Extreme (band)|Extreme]]. Cherone predicted that the new lineup would last "10 years"; however, the ''[[Van Halen III]]'' (1998) album was poorly received. The band completed a world tour with their new single "[[Without You (Van Halen song)|Without You]]" and returned to the studio to start on a second album. However, Cherone soon after departed amicably and, without a lead singer, Van Halen went on hiatus.

===Reunion with Hagar and Roth===
[[File:David Lee Roth and Eddie Van Halen 2007-11-10.jpg|thumb|Van Halen (right) with [[David Lee Roth]], November 2007.]]
In 2004, Van Halen returned with Hagar as their lead singer. A greatest hits package, ''[[The Best of Both Worlds (Van Halen album)|The Best of Both Worlds]]'', was released to coincide with the band's reunion tour. The album included three new tracks recorded with Hagar, "Up For Breakfast", "It's About Time", and "Learning to See". The band toured the United States, visiting 80 cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.van-halen.com/newsite/road.html|title=2004 tour listing on van-halen.com|website=van-halen.com|accessdate=June 1, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061219081921/http://www.van-halen.com/newsite/road.html|archivedate=December 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 2, 2007, it was officially announced on the band's website that David Lee Roth would rejoin Van Halen for their summer tour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://van-halen.com/newsite/pressrelease.html Van-halen.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403221011/http://van-halen.com/newsite/pressrelease.html|date=April 3, 2007}}, Van Halen Press Release&lt;/ref&gt; Excitement over the tour waned when, on February 20, 2007, reports surfaced that the tour was indefinitely postponed. A previously planned compilation of Roth-era Van Halen hits was shelved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pollstar.com/news/viewnews.pl?NewsID=7687|title=Link To Us|publisher=Pollstar|accessdate=December 1, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630000651/http://www.pollstar.com/news/viewnews.pl?NewsID=7687|archivedate=June 30, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After six months and a stint in rehabilitation for Eddie, the band confirmed on August 13, 2007, at a press conference in [[Los Angeles]], they would do a [[Van Halen 2007-2008 Tour|tour]] with Roth from late 2007 into 2008 across North America, with worldwide touring and a new album to follow.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/Music/08/13/vanhalen.reut/index.html?iref=mpstoryview|title=Van Halen, with Roth, to begin reunion tour|accessdate=August 13, 2007|work=CNN|date=August 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Persistent rumors had long indicated the Van Halen brothers were in talks with Roth to rejoin the band for a tour and/or new material. Van Halen's then 15-year-old son [[Wolfgang Van Halen|Wolfgang]] was to play bass on the tour, replacing Michael Anthony.

===2000s===
Van Halen [[Van Halen 2007–2008 North American Tour|toured]] the U.S. and Canada from September 2007 through summer 2008. The band released their twelfth studio album, ''[[A Different Kind of Truth]]'', on February 7, 2012, their first album in 14 years and their first album with Roth since ''1984''. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Different Kind of Truth|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/a-different-kind-of-truth-mw0002295183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and influence==
Van Halen's approach to the guitar involves several distinctive components. His use of two-handed [[tapping]], natural and artificial [[harmonics]], [[vibrato]], and [[tremolo]] picking, combined with his rhythmic sensibility and melodic approach, have influenced an entire generation of guitarists. The [[Instrumental rock|instrumental]] "Eruption" was voted No. 2 in ''[[Guitar World]]'' magazine's readers poll of the 100 Greatest Guitar Solos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://guitar.about.com/library/bl100greatest.htm About.com], 100 Greatest Guitar Solos; accessed December 1, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5937559/the_100_greatest_guitarists_of_all_time Rollingstone.com], 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his massive success, Van Halen has never fully learned to read music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/the-side/music/eddie-van-halen-interview-2012-8147775|title=Eddie Van Halen Interview – Esquire Eddie Van Halen Interview |publisher=Esquire|date=April 17, 2012|accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tapping===
{{Main article|Tapping}}
The 1978 instrumental "[[Eruption (instrumental)|Eruption]]" by Van Halen showcased a solo technique called [[tapping]], using both left and right hands on the guitar neck. Although Van Halen popularized tapping, he did not invent the tapping technique which had been used infrequently by various guitarists in blues and rock in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. {{fact|date=July 2018}}

[[George Lynch (musician)|George Lynch]] said in an interview that he and Van Halen saw [[Harvey Mandel]] tap at the Starwood in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themetalden.com/index.php?p=198|title=Interview: George Lynch|publisher=themetalden.com|accessdate=December 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Halen's accounts of how he came across the tapping technique vary. In one interview with ''[[Guitar World]]'', he said:{{quote|I think I got the idea of tapping watching Jimmy Page do his "[[Heartbreaker (Led Zeppelin song)|Heartbreaker]]" solo back in 1971. He was doing a pull-off to an open string, and I thought wait a minute, open string ... pull off. I can do that, but what if I use my finger as the nut and move it around? I just kind of took it and ran with it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guitarworld.com/article/van_halen_vh1 Van Halen: VH1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115053118/http://www.guitarworld.com/article/van_halen_vh1|date=January 15, 2011}}, ''[[Guitar World]]''; accessed December 1, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Van Halen also employs [[Tap harmonic|tapping harmonics]].  He holds the pick between his thumb and middle finger, which leaves his index finger free for tapping, and also makes for easy transitions between picking and tapping. 

Van Halen holds a patent for a flip-out support device that attaches to the rear of the electric guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|4656917| U.S. Patent No. 4,656,917}}, ''Musical instrument support'', April 14, 1987, Edward L. Van Halen, inventor.&lt;/ref&gt; This device enables the user to play the guitar in a manner similar to the piano by orienting the face of the guitar upward instead of forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Musical instrument support|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US4656917A/en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Celebrity Invention: Eddie Van Halen's Guitar Support System|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/02/celebrity-invention-eddie-van-halens-guitar-support-system/70770/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Patent Van Halen|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;Query=PN/4656917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pickup selection==
Van Halen has used a variety of pickups including Gibson PAF's, 1970s Mighty Mites, [[DiMarzio]]s and Ibanez Super 70s.  He was using Mighty Mite pickups in 1977 club photos, just prior to the recording of the first Van Halen album. Mighty Mite pickups were [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] pickups made by [[Seymour Duncan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wayneguitars.com/history.html|title=History|publisher=Wayne Guitars|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125065939/http://www.wayneguitars.com/history.html|archivedate=November 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were copies of DiMarzio Super Distortion pickups. Seymour Duncan apparently rewound a Gibson PAF for Van Halen around early 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vhlinks.com/pages/interviews/evh/gp122979.php|title=Interviews - Eddie Van Halen|date=December 29, 1979|publisher=vhlinks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His later guitars include various [[Kramer Guitars|Kramer]] models from his period of endorsement for that company (most notably the Kramer 5150, from which Kramer in its Gibson-owned days based their Kramer 1984 design, an unofficial artist signature model) and three signature models: the Ernie Ball/[[Music Man (company)|Music Man]] Edward van Halen Model (which continues as the [[Ernie Ball]] Axis), the [[Peavey Electronics|Peavey]] EVH Wolfgang (which has been succeeded by a similar guitar called the HP Special), and the Charvel EVH Art Series, on which Van Halen does the striping before they are painted by Charvel. His current deal is with Fender, making the EVH series of striped guitars, Wolfgang guitars, and EVH amps.

In an interview in ''[[Guitar World]]'' magazine in July 1985, Van Halen states that his "brown sound" is "...basically a tone, a feeling that I'm always working at ... It comes from the person.  If the person doesn't even know what that type of tone I'm talking about is, they can't really work towards it, can they?"
In an interview with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine in June 2015, he states that with the expression "brown sound" he actually tried to describe the sound of his brother Alex Van Halen's [[snare drum]], which he thought "...sounds like he’s beating on a log. It’s very organic. So it wasn’t my brown sound. It was Alex's." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/6605131/eddie-van-halen-synesthesia-rumors-brown-sound|title=Does Eddie Van Halen See Colors When He Hears Music?

===Patents===
Van Halen is the inventor on {{patent|US|4656917}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=-QgyAAAAEBAJ|title=Musical instrument support|publisher=google.com|accessdate=December 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main claim is for a supporting member on the back of a stringed instrument, allowing the musician to play and/or fret the instrument in new ways.

He is the lead inventor of {{patent|US|7183475}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US7183475|title=Stringed instrument with adjustable string tension control|publisher=US Patent|accessdate=December 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the [http://www.dtuna.com/index.php D-Tuna] he invented to enable a non-floating Floyd Rose-equipped guitar to quickly change the tuning of the low E string by a whole step.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Another patent naming Van Halen as inventor is [http://www.google.com/patents/USD388117 D388117]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/USD388117|title=Guitar peghead|publisher=Google.com|accessdate=December 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the headstock design for the EVH Wolfgang guitars.

==Personal life==
On August 29, 1980, Eddie met actress [[Valerie Bertinelli]] at a Van Halen concert in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Guitar Hero Picks His Bride|url=http://ew.com/article/1997/04/11/guitar-hero-picks-his-bride|website=EW.com|accessdate=March 12, 2017|date=April 11, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; They married in California on April 11, 1981; and have one child, a son, [[Wolfgang Van Halen|Wolfgang]] (born March 16, 1991).

After his father's death in December 1986 and his brother Alex's eventual sobriety in April 1987, Eddie Van Halen struggled with drug and alcohol abuse on and off for twenty years. In April 1988, he was hospitalized with [[dengue fever]] while on a wedding anniversary vacation in Australia. On September 2, 1994, he made his first attempt at sobriety.

Suffering from lingering injuries from past high-risk acrobatic stage antics and crashes, Van Halen underwent [[hip replacement surgery]] in November 1999, after his chronic [[avascular necrosis]], with which he was diagnosed in 1995, became unbearable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/event/307/000111971|title=Hip Replacement Surgery|publisher=NNDB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2001, Van Halen confirmed he had been undergoing treatment for [[tongue cancer]] since May 2000. The subsequent surgery removed roughly a third of his tongue. He was declared cancer-free in May 2002.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Since the 2004 tour, Van Halen had largely disappeared from the public eye, with the exception of occasional appearances including the 14th annual [[Elton John]] Academy Awards party and a performance at a [[Kenny Chesney]] concert. In December 2004, Van Halen attended [[Dimebag Darrell|"Dimebag" Darrell Abbott]]'s funeral, and donated the black and yellow guitar featured on the ''Van Halen II'' album inlay, stating that it was always a favorite of Dimebag's. The guitar was put in Darrell's [[Kiss Kasket]] and he was buried with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Pantera|series=VH1: Behind the Music|serieslink=Behind the Music|network=[[VH1]]|minutes=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5, 2005, Van Halen's wife, [[Valerie Bertinelli]], filed for divorce in Los Angeles Superior Court, after four years of separation, which was finalized on December 20, 2007. On March 8, 2007, Van Halen announced on the official band website that Van Halen was entering rehabilitation for unspecified reasons.  However, both Sammy Hagar and Michael Anthony have made statements indicating that Van Halen's personality had changed due to alcohol abuse.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Van Halen emerged from rehabilitation and appeared publicly as an honorary official during a [[NASCAR]] race at [[Phoenix International Raceway]] on April 21, 2007. He unveiled a new [[Fender Stratocaster]] with a paint job made for the NASCAR races before the ceremony. In 2007, Van Halen was honored in the [[Xbox 360]] version of ''[[Guitar Hero II]]''.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

On October 6, 2008, Van Halen proposed to his girlfriend, Janie Liszewski, an actress and stunt-woman who became Van Halen's publicist in 2007. The two married on June 27, 2009, at his [[Studio City, Los Angeles|Studio City]] estate, with his son Wolfgang and Bertinelli in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20288147,00.html|title=Eddie Van Halen – in Flip-Flops – Weds Girlfriend|date=June 27, 2009|publisher=People}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Eddie's brother Alex officiated the ceremony, while his son served as best man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kate Ward|title=Eddie Van Halen marries|url=http://news-briefs.ew.com/2009/06/eddie-van-halen-marries.html|work=EW.com|date=June 30, 2009|accessdate=July 1, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629225141/http://news-briefs.ew.com/2009/06/eddie-van-halen-marries.html|archivedate=June 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 1, 2011, Eddie and Wolfgang Van Halen attended Bertinelli's remarriage. 

In mid-January 2011, he attended the winter [[NAMM Show]] to present his new Wolfgang guitars, sharing the Fender booth with fellow guitar player [[Yngwie Malmsteen]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In August 2012, Van Halen underwent an emergency surgery for a severe bout of [[diverticulitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chad Childers|title=Eddie Van Halen Undergoes Emergency Surgery|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/eddie-van-halen-undergoes-emergency-surgery|work=Ultimate Classic Rock|date=August 29, 2012|accessdate=August 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His recovery time was four to six months, causing Van Halen to postpone their Japanese tour, which was originally scheduled to begin in November 2012.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Eddie has donated 75 of his personal guitars to [[The Mr. Holland's Opus Foundation]] stating: "I wanted to give back to the community, and especially kids in need who want an instrument but didn’t have the opportunity I had. I wanted to donate instruments because I have so many guitars and nobody would take them... until we found Mr. Holland’s Opus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eddie Van Halen Interview Oct. 2016 - Mr. Holland's Opus Foundation|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgG1hePhWoU|website=Youtube|accessdate=December 5, 2016|date=October 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EDDIE VAN HALEN Talks About Working With MR.

'''Evenki''' {{IPAc-en|eɪ|ˈ|v|ɛ|n|k|i}},&lt;ref&gt;Also spelled Ewenki, Ewenke, or Owenke and previously conflated with Solon or Suolun&lt;/ref&gt; formerly known as '''Tungus'''&lt;ref&gt;The people speaking Evenki were also called "Tungusy". According to {{harvnb|Nedjalkov|1997|p=xix}}, "Tungus" could be a Chinese exonym.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''[[Solon people|Solon]]''', is the largest member of the northern group of [[Tungusic languages]], a group which also includes [[Even language|Even]], [[Negidal language|Negidal]], and (the more closely related) [[Oroqen language]]. The name is sometimes wrongly given as "Evenks". It is spoken by [[Evenks]] in [[Russia]] and [[China]].

In certain areas the influences of the [[Yakut language|Yakut]] and the [[Buryat language|Buryat]] languages are particularly strong. The influence of Russian in general is overwhelming (in 1979, 75.2% of the Evenkis spoke Russian, rising to 92.7% in 2002). Evenki children were forced to learn Russian at Soviet residential schools, and returned with a “poor ability to speak their mother tongue...".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://munin.uit.no/handle/10037/7776|title=The role of the new Evenkiness in the Evenki language revitalization: the case of the Sakha Republic (Yakutia)|last=Sivtseva|first=Mira|date=20 May 2015|website=Muin Open Research Archive|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Evenki language varies considerably among its dialects which are divided into three large groups: the northern, the southern and the eastern dialects. These are further divided into minor dialects. A [[written language]] was created for Evenkis in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1931, first using a [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]], and from 1937 a Cyrillic one.&lt;ref name="Atknine"&gt;{{harvnb|Atknine|1997|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; In China, Evenki is written experimentally in the [[Mongolian script]].&lt;ref name="MonScript"&gt;{{harvnb|Kara|2006|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language is generally considered [[endangered language|endangered]].&lt;ref&gt;Grenoble; Janhunen&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic affiliation==
Evenki is a member of the [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic family]]. Its similarity to [[Manchu language|Manchu]], the best-documented member of the family, was noted hundreds of years ago, first by botanist [[Peter Simon Pallas|P. S. Pallas]] in the late 18th century, and then in a more formal linguistic study by [[Matthias Alexander Castrén|M. A. Castren]] in the mid-19th century, regarded as a "pioneer treatise" in the field of Tungusology.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atknine|1997|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact internal structure of the Tungusic family is a matter of some debate. Some scholars propose two sub-families: one for Manchu, and another for all the other Tungusic languages, including Evenki.&lt;ref name="WhaleyGrenoble"&gt;{{harvnb|Whaley|Grenoble|Li|1999|p=286}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[SIL International]]'s [[Ethnologue]] divides Tungusic into two sub-families, Northern and Southern, with Evenki alongside [[Even language|Even]] and [[Negidal language|Negidal]] in the Northern sub-family, and the Southern family itself subdivided into Southwestern (among which Manchu) and Southeastern ([[Nanai language|Nanai]] and others).&lt;ref name="EthnologueAltaic"&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2009|loc=[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=7-16]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others propose three or more sub-families, or at the extreme a [[dialect continuum|continuum]] with Manchu at one end and Evenki at the other.&lt;ref name="WhaleyGrenoble" /&gt;

==Dialects==
Bulatova enumerated 14 dialects and 50 sub-dialects within Russia, spread over a wide geographical area ranging from the [[Yenisei River]] to [[Sakhalin]]. These may be divided into three major groups primarily on the basis of phonology:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atknine|1997|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Northern (spirant)
##Ilimpeya: Ilimpeya, Agata and Bol'shoi, Porog, Tura, Tutonchany, Dudinka/Khantai
##Yerbogachen: Yerbogachen, Nakanno
#Southern (sibilant)
##Hushing
###Sym: Tokma or Upper Nepa, Upper Lena or Kachug, Angara
###Northern Baikal: Northern Baikal, Upper Lena
##Hissing
###Stony Tunguska: Vanavara, Kuyumba, Poligus, Surinda, Taimura or Chirinda, Uchami, Chemdal'sk
###Nepa: Nepa, Kirensk

##Sakhalin (no subdialects)

Evenks in China also speak several dialects. According to [[Ethnologue]], the Hihue or Hoy dialect is considered the standard; Haila’er, Aoluguya (Olguya), Chenba’erhu (Old Bargu), and Morigele (Mergel) dialects also exist. Ethnologue reports these dialects differ significantly from those in Russia.

Some works focused on individual Russia dialects include {{harvnb|Gortsevskaya|1936}} (Barguzin), {{harvnb|Andreeva|1988}} (Tommot), and {{harvnb|Bulatova|1999}} (Sakhalin).

==Phonology==
The Evenki language typically has CV syllables but other structures are possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nedjalkov|1997|p=314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bulatova and Grenoble list Evenki as having 11 possible vowel phonemes; a classical five-vowel system with distinctions between long and short vowels (except in {{IPA|/e/}}) and the addition of a long and short {{IPA|/ə/}},&lt;ref name="BG4"&gt;{{harvnb|Bulatova|Grenoble|1999|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Nedjalkov claims that there are 13 vowel phonemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nedjalkov|1997|p=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evenki has a moderately small consonant inventory; there are 18 consonants (21 according to Nedjalkov 1997) in the Evenki language and it lacks glides or semivowels.&lt;ref name="BG4"/&gt;

===Consonants===
Below are tables of Evenki consonant phonemes, including those identified by Nedjalkov (1997) in italics.&lt;ref name="Nedjalkov 1997 310-311"&gt;{{harvnb|Nedjalkov|1997|pp=310–311}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell 2000 548"&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|2000|p=548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phoneme ({{IPA|/β/}}) has a word-final [[allophone]], {{IPA|[f]}}, as well as an intervocalic variant, {{IPA|[w]}}. Likewise, some speakers pronounce intervocalic {{IPA|/s/}} as {{IPA|[h]}}. Speakers of some dialects also alternate {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/β/}}.&lt;ref name="Nedjalkov 1997 310-311"/&gt; Consonant inventories given by researchers working on dialects in China are largely similar. The differences noted: Chaoke and Kesingge ''et al.'' give {{IPA|/h/}} instead of {{IPA|/x/}} and lack {{IPA|/β/}}, {{IPA|/ɣ/}}, or {{IPA|/ɲ/}}; furthermore, Kesingge ''et al.'' give {{IPA|/dʐ/}} instead of {{IPA|/dʒ/}}.&lt;ref name="Chaoke 2009 339"&gt;{{harvnb|Dular|2009|p=339}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kesingge|Cidaltu|Alta|Norbu|1983|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like most [[Tungusic languages]], Evenki employs vowel harmony—suffix vowels are matched to the vowel in the root. However, some vowels &amp;ndash; {{IPA|/i, iː, u, uː/}} &amp;ndash; and certain suffixes do not adhere to the rules of vowel harmony.&lt;ref name="BG4" /&gt; Knowledge of the rules of vowel harmony is fading, as vowel harmony is a complex topic for elementary speakers to grasp, the language is severely endangered (Janhunen), and many speakers are multilingual.&lt;ref name="BG4" /&gt;

===Syllable structure===
Possible syllable structures include V, VC, VCC, CV, CVC, and CVCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dular|2009|p=348}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to dialects in Russia&lt;!-- Boldyrev lists a bunch of words starting with ң, but it would be nice to have an explicit statement of this --&gt;,{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} dialects in China do not have /k/, /ŋ/, nor /r/ in word-initial position.&lt;ref name="Chaoke 2009 339"/&gt;

==Alphabets==

===Russia===
The creation of the Evenki alphabet began in the 1920s. In May 1928, researcher [[Vasilevich, Glafira Makarievna|G. M. Vasilevich]] ([[:ru:Василевич, Глафира Макарьевна|ru]]) prepared for the Evenk students who studied in Leningrad the “Memo to Tungus-vacationers”. It was a small textbook duplicated on the glass&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Г. М. Василевич | chapter = | url = | title = Памятка тунгусам-отпукникам | orig-year = | agency =  | edition =   |location= Л. |year= 1928 |publisher=  |at=  |volume=  |issue = | pages = | page =  | series =  | isbn = | ref = }}&lt;/ref&gt;. It used the Vasilyevich Evenki alphabet on a Latin graphic basis. A year later, she compiled the “First Book for Reading in the Tungus Language” (''Әwәnkil dukuwuntin'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author =  | chapter = | url = | title = Эвенкийская литература | orig-year = | agency = В.

This alphabet had the following composition: ''Aa Bb HH Dd Ӡӡ Ee Әә Gg Hh Ii Kk Ll Mm Nn ​​Ŋŋ Oo Pp Rr Ss Tt Uu Ww Yy''; it also included the diacritical marks: a macron, to indicate the longitude of the sound, and a sub-letter comma, to indicate palatalization&lt;ref name="КиПВ"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Я. П. Алькор (Кошкин) |editor=  |format= |url= http://dlib.rsl.ru/viewer/01005509754#?page=20 |title= Письменность народов Севера |type=  |origyear= | agency =  |edition= Культура и письменность востока  |location= М. |date=  1931 |year= 1931 |publisher= ВЦК НА |volume=  |issue= X |pages = 12–31 |series=  |isbn =  |issn =  |doi =  |bibcode =  |pmid =  |ref=  |archiveurl =  |archivedate =  |language=  |quote=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 1930, it was decided to create a written language for the majority of the peoples of the North of the USSR. The Latin alphabet was chosen as its graphic basis. In the same year, the project of the Evenki alphabet was proposed by Ya. P. Alcor. This project differed from Vasilevich’s alphabet only by the presence of letters for displaying Russian borrowings (''C c, F f, J j, W w, Z z''), as well as using ''V v'' instead of ''W w''. After some refinement, the letter ''Ч'' was replaced by ''Ç ç'', ''V v'' by ''W w'', and the letter ''Y y'' was excluded&lt;ref name="КиПВ" /&gt;. In May 1931, the Evenki romanized alphabet was officially approved, and in 1932 regular publishing began on it&lt;ref name="ккэ" /&gt;. The basis of the literary language was laid the most studied nepsky dialect (north of the Irkutsk region)&lt;ref name="ПЯМ"&gt;{{cite book| author =  | chapter = | url = | title = Письменные языки мира: Языки Российской Федерации | orig-year = | agency =  | edition =  {{nowrap|1000 экз}} |location= М. |year= 2003 |publisher= Academia |volume= 2 |issue = | pages = 648–649| series =  | isbn = 978-5-87444-191-3| ref = }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The official [[Latinisation in the Soviet Union|Latinized]] Evenk alphabet, in which book publishing and schooling were conducted, looked like this&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Г. М.

Today, the official written language in [[Russia]] for the evenki language is [[Cyrillic script]]. The script has one additional letter, ӈ, to indicate /ŋ/; it is used only inconsistently in printed works, due to typographical limitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grenoble|Whaley|2003|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boldyrev's dictionary uses ң instead.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. the entry for кто; {{harvnb|Boldyrev|1994|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other sounds found in Evenki but not Russian, such as /dʒ/, lack devoted letters. Instead "д" stands in for both /d/ and /dʒ/; when the latter pronunciation is intended, it is followed by one of Cyrillic's [[iotation|iotified]] letters, similar to the way those letters cause [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]] of the preceding consonant in Russian. However orthographic decisions like these have resulted in some confusion and transfer of Russian phonetics to Evenki among younger speakers. For example, the spellings "ди" and "ды" were intended to record [dʒi] and [di] (i.e. the same vowel sound). However, in Russian "и" and "ы" are respectively two different vowels /i/ and /ɨ/.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grenoble|Whaley|2003|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long vowels are indicated with macrons.

===China{{anchor|Evenki alphabet}}===
In the "Imperial History of the National Languages of Liao, Jin, and Yuan" ({{zh|t=欽定遼金元三史國語解|p=Qīndìng liáo jīn yuán sān shǐ guóyǔ jiě}}) commissioned by the [[Qianlong Emperor]], the [[Manchu alphabet]] is used to write Evenki words.

Evenki in [[China]] is now written in the [[Latin script]] and experimentally in the [[Mongolian script]]. Evenki scholars made an attempt in the 1980s to create standard written forms for their language, using both Mongolian script and a [[pinyin]]-like Latin spelling. They published an Evenki–Mongolian–Chinese dictionary ({{harvnb|Kesingge|Cidaltu|Alta|Norbu|1983}}) with Evenki words spelled in IPA, a pinyin-like orthography, and Mongolian script, as well as a collection of folk songs in IPA and Mongolian script (and Chinese-style [[numbered musical notation]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kara|2006|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The orthographic system developed by Chinese Evenki scholars reflects differences between Evenki and Mongol [[phonology]]. It uses both {{MongolUnicode|ᠬ|evn|valign=middle}} and {{MongolUnicode|ᠭ|evn|valign=middle}} (usually romanised from Mongolian as ''q'' and ''ɣ'') for /g/.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kara|2006|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system uses double letters in both Mongolian and Latin to represent most long vowels; however for /ɔː/ ''ao'' is written instead of ''oo''. The same scholars' collection of songs has some orthographic differences from the table below; namely, long vowels are occasionally written not just doubled but also with an intervening [[silent letter|silent]] {{MongolUnicode|ᠭ|evn|valign=middle}} (''ɣ''), showing clear orthographic influence from the [[Mongolian language]]. In medial and final positions, ''t'' is written in the [[Manchu script]] form {{MongolUnicode|ᡨ|evn|valign=middle}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kara|2006|pp=139–142}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Evenki" itself is spelled ''eweŋki'', despite Mongolian orthography usually prohibiting the letter combination ''ŋk''. The vowel inventory of this system is also rather different from that of Chaoke (1995, 2009).

== Morphology ==
Evenki is highly agglutinating, suffixing, and not flexive: Each [[morpheme]] is easily recognizable and carries only one piece of meaning. Evenki pronouns distinguish between singular and plural as well as inclusive and exclusive in the first person.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bulatova|Grenoble|1999|pp=6, 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Evenki language has a rich case system—13 cases, though there is some variation among dialects—and it is a nominative–accusative language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bulatova|Grenoble|1999|pp=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evenki differentiates between alienable and inalienable possession:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bulatova|Grenoble|1999|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; alienable possession marks the possessor in the [[nominative case]] and the possessum in the [[possessed case]], while inalienable possession is marked by personal indices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nedjalkov|1997|pp=82, 158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|+ Evenki personal indices

|}

Below is a table of cases and suffixes in Evenki, following Nedjalkov (1997):

Plurals are marked with -il-, -l-, or -r- before the case marker, if any: ''tyge-l-ve'' (cup-&lt;small&gt;PL&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;ACD&lt;/small&gt;) "the cups (accusative);" Ivul-ngi oro-r-in (Ivul-&lt;small&gt;GEN&lt;/small&gt; reindeer-&lt;small&gt;PL&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;3SG-POS&lt;/small&gt;), "the reindeer (pl.) of Ivul."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nedjalkov|1997|p=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syntax==
Evenki is a [[subject–object–verb]] and [[head-final]] language. The subject is marked according to the nominative case, and the object is in the accusative. In Evenki, the [[indirect object]] precedes the [[direct object]].

==Literary traditions==
The [[Manchu script]] was used to write Evenki ([[Solon people|Solon]]) words in the "Imperial History of the National Languages of Liao, Jin, and Yuan". The Evenki did not have their own writing system until the introduction of the [[Latin script]] in 1931 and the subsequent change to Cyrillic in 1936-7.&lt;ref name="BG3"&gt;{{harvnb|Bulatova|Grenoble|1999|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The literary language was first based on the Nepa dialect of the Southern subgroup, but in the 1950s was redesigned with the Stony Tunguska dialect as its basis.&lt;ref name="Atknine" /&gt; Ethnographer [[S. M. Shirokogoroff]] harshly criticised the "child-like" literary language, and in a 1930s monograph predicted it would quickly go extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Inoue|1991|pp=35–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although textbooks through the 8th grade have been published, "Literary Evenki has not yet achieved the status of a norm which cut across dialects and is understood by speakers of some dialects with great difficulty".&lt;ref name="BG3"/&gt; However, despite its failure to gain widespread acceptance, within its dialectal base of roughly 5,000 people, it survived and continues in use up to the present.&lt;ref name="Atknine_a"&gt;{{harvnb|Atknine|1997|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1930s, "folklore, novels, poetry, numerous translations from Russian and other languages", textbooks, and dictionaries have all been written in Evenki.&lt;ref name="Nedjalkov"&gt;{{harvnb|Nedjalkov|1997|p=xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tura, Krasnoyarsk Krai|Tura]] (former administrative center of the [[Evenk Autonomous Okrug]]), the local newspaper includes a weekly supplement written in Evenki.&lt;ref name="Atknine_a" /&gt;

==Language shift and multilingualism==
There is a large quantity of Russian loan words in Evenki, especially for technologies and concepts that were introduced by the Russian pioneers in Siberia. "Evenki is spoken in regions with heavy multilingualism. In their daily life the people come into contact with Russian, Buriat and Yakut, and each of these languages had affected the Evenki language. Russian is the lingua franca of the region, part of the Evenki population is bilingual, and part trilingual. All Evenki know Russian relatively well."&lt;ref name="BG3"/&gt; In 1998 there were approximately 30,000 ethnic Evenkis living in Russia and about 1/3 of them spoke the language. Even a decade ago Bulatova was trying to warn speakers and linguists alike: "There is widespread loss of Evenki and the language can be considered seriously endangered".&lt;ref name="BG3"/&gt; According to the [[Russian Census (2002)|2002 Russian census]], there are 35,527 citizens of the Russian Federation who identify themselves as ethnically Evenki, but only 7,580 speakers of the language.&lt;ref name="ethnologue.com"&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2009|loc=[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=evn]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, there is an ethnic population of 30,500 but only 19,000 are fluent in Evenki and there are only around 3,000 people who are monolingual in Evenki.&lt;ref name="ethnologue.com"/&gt; Juha Janhunen investigated multilingualism in [[Hulunbuir]] (northern [[Inner Mongolia]]) and the adjoining section of [[Heilongjiang]] (e.g. [[Qiqihar]]) in 1996. He found that most [[Solon people|Solons]] still spoke Evenki, and about half knew [[Daur language]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Janhunen|1996|p=828}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] functioned as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' among members of all [[ethnic minorities in China|minority groups]] there, as they tended to do their education in Mongolian-[[medium of instruction|medium]] schools. The only Evenki-speakers whom Janhunen knew not to speak Mongolian as a second language were the Reindeer Evenki (sometimes called "Yakut") in the northern part of Hulunbuir, who used [[Russian language|Russian]] as their "language of intercultural communication".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Janhunen|1996|p=833}}&lt;/ref&gt; Janhunen predicted that all of these languages, including Mongolian, were likely to lose ground to Chinese in coming years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Janhunen|1996|p=834}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Chaoke noted more than a decade later that the usage rate of Evenki remained quite high, and that it was still common to find Evenki-speakers who were proficient in three, four, or even five languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dular|2009|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a small population of Mongolized [[Hamnigan]] speakers in Mongolia as well, numbering around 1,000.&lt;ref name="ethnologue.com"/&gt;

There is little information regarding revival efforts or Evenki's status now. In 1998, the language was taught in preschools and primary schools and offered as an option in 8th grade. The courses were regarded as an 'ethnocultural component' to bring Evenki language and culture into the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mamontova|first=Nadezhda|date=5 December 2014|title=What Language Do Real Evenki Speak?|doi=10.2753/AAE1061-1959520402|journal=Anthropology &amp; Archeology of Eurasia|volume=52|issue=4|pages=37–75|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instruction as a second language is also available in the [[Institute of the Peoples of the North]] at [[Herzen University]] (the former St. Petersburg State Pedagogical University).&lt;ref name="Nedjalkov" /&gt; In the 1980s, Christian missionaries working in Siberia translated the Bible into Evenki and a Christian group called the Global Recordings Network records Christian teaching materials in Evenki.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Global Recordings Network|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hermes of Philippopolis''' was one of the [[Seventy Disciples]] and was [[bishop]] in Philippopolis in [[Thrace]] (today's [[Plovdiv]], [[Bulgaria]]).  ''[[The Shepherd of Hermas]]'' is also traditionally ascribed to him.  He is referenced in [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 16:14, and his [[feast day]] is celebrated on May 31, on November 5 with Apostles [[Apostle Patrobas|Patrobas]], [[Apostle Linus|Linus]], [[Apostle Gaius|Gaius]], and [[Apostle Philologos|Philologos]], and on January 4 among the Seventy.

==Life==
He was wealthy, but fell into poverty because of [[sin]] and the sins of his sons.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} He was thus supposedly visited by an [[angel]] of [[repentance]], who is said to have stayed with him until the end of his life, during which time he wrote ''The Shepherd of Hermas''{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}  He ended his life as a [[martyr]].

'''[[High Sheriff]]s of [[Cornwall]]''': a chronological list:

''Note'': The right to choose High Sheriffs each year is vested in the [[Duchy of Cornwall]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duchyofcornwall.org/abouttheduchy_history_acquisition.htm The Duchy of Cornwall] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205194139/http://www.duchyofcornwall.org/abouttheduchy_history_acquisition.htm |date=5 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]], chaired by the Sovereign, which chooses the Sheriffs of all other English counties, other than those in the [[Duchy of Lancaster]]. This right came from the [[Earldom of Cornwall]]. In the time of Earls [[Richard, Earl of Cornwall|Richard]] and [[Edmund of Almain|Edmund]], the [[Steward (office)|steward]] or [[seneschal]] of Cornwall was often also the sheriff.&lt;ref&gt;James Whetter, Cornwall in the thirteenth century (Gorran 1998), 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Ignatius Breen''' (October 14, 1888 &amp;ndash; December 5, 1965) was an [[United States|American]] film [[Censorship|censor]] with the [[Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America]] who applied the [[Hays Code]] to film production.&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;Staff report (December 8, 1965). Joseph I. Breen, Film Code Chief; Watchdog of Movie Morals For Years Is Dead at 75. ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Breen was the youngest of three sons born to Mary and Hugh A. Breen in [[Philadelphia]]. His father had emigrated from [[Ireland]] and met his mother Mary in New Jersey. Breen was raised in a strict [[Roman Catholic]] home and attended Gesu Parish School until the eighth grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doherty|first=Thomas|title=Hollywood's Censor: Joseph I.

==As film censor==
===1934—1941===

Breen was a journalist and an "influential layperson" in the Catholic community.&lt;ref name="doherty"/&gt; Breen worked for [[Will H. Hays]] as a "troubleshooter" as early as 1931.&lt;ref name=breening&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=462777|title=The Breening of America|last=Leff|first=Leonard J.|journal=PMLA|volume=106|number=3|date=May 1991|pages=432–445|doi=10.2307/462777}}{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1933, the Roman Catholic [[National Legion of Decency]] was founded, and began to rate films independently, putting pressure on the industry. In 1933 and 1934 the Legion along with a number of Protestant and women's groups launched plans to boycott films that they deemed immoral.&lt;ref name=Bernstein00&gt;{{cite book |author=Matthew Bernstein |title=Controlling Hollywood: Censorship and Regulation in the Studio Era |year=2000 |isbn=0813527074 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dEYoT857G8UC |accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America]] (MPPDA) had, up until then, enforced the motion picture industry's own self-censorship standards, albeit not very seriously.&lt;ref name=talkies&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ILgyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AOsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=joseph-breen%20censor&amp;pg=1675%2C861119|title=Censors Bloomed With the Talkies|publisher=The Miami News|date=August 3, 1965|author=Bob Thomas|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hays, who had been in charge of enforcing this voluntary code since 1927, worried that the NLD's efforts could weaken his own power and that of his office, and hurt industry profits.&lt;ref name=talkies/&gt; 

Hays appointed the "tough Irish Catholic" Breen to head the [[Production Code Administration]] (PCA), a newly created department of the MPPDA, created to administer the [[Motion Picture Production Code]].&lt;ref name="pryors"&gt;Pryors, Thomas S. (October 15, 1954). "Breen is Retired as Movie Censor; At Own Request, Director of Code Leaves Office -- Chief Aide Successor", ''[[New York Times]]''; accessed May 4, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike previous attempts at self-censorship, PCA decisions became binding — no film could be exhibited in an American theater without a stamp of approval from the PCA.&lt;ref name=Black96&gt;{{cite book |author=Gregory D.

After ten years of unsuccessful voluntary codes and expanding local censorship boards, the studio approved and agreed to enforce the codes, and the nationwide production code was enforced starting on July 1, 1934.&lt;ref name=Black96/&gt; ''[[Liberty (1924–1950)|Liberty Magazine]]'' wrote in 1936 that Breen's appointment gave him "more influence in standardizing world thinking than Mussolini, Hitler, or Stalin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wu|first=Tim|title=The Future of Free Speech|journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|volume=57|number=13|year=2010|authorlink=Tim Wu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breen has been accused of [[anti-Semitism]]&lt;ref name=hattie&gt;{{cite book|author=Jill Watts|title=Hattie McDaniel: Black Ambition, White Hollywood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BCF1N-4ChUEC&amp;pg=PA146|accessdate=May 26, 2013|date=February 6, 2007|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-051491-4|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of a few personal letters he wrote in the early 1930s. In these letters, he lamented the immorality of the filmmakers. According to author Thomas Doherty, this outburst was likely a reaction to Breen's sudden immersion in the alien Hollywood culture rather than an expression of deeply held beliefs, stating that "The antisemitic bile erupted during the pre-Code era, when Breen, newly arrived in Hollywood, was shocked by the folkways of the locals and anguished by his inability to purify the screen." After 1934, he was "publicly and forthrightly anti-antisemitic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://forward.com/articles/12234/was-hollywood-s-famed-censor-an-antisemite-|publisher=The Jewish Daily Forward|author=Thomas Doherty|title=Was Hollywood's Famed Censor an Antisemite?|date=December 11, 2007|accessdate=May 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Dudley Pelley]], founder of the anti-Semitic organization the [[Silver Legion of America]], believed that Jews controlled the movie industry, which he thought to be the "most effective propaganda medium in America", during the 1930s. Hence he applauded the fact that Breen had assumed the power to censor Hollywood.&lt;ref name=celluloid&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael E.

He specifically warned Hollywood producers to avoid the topic altogether, saying that "[t]here is a strong pro-German and anti-Semitic feeling in this country ... and while those who are likely to approve of an anti-Hitler picture may think well of such an enterprise, they should keep in mind that millions of Americans might think otherwise."&lt;ref name="Kirle2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce Kirle|title=Unfinished Show Business: Broadway Musicals As Works-in-Process|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8KgEhFzJd9YC&amp;pg=PA132|accessdate=May 27, 2013|year=2005|publisher=SIU Press|isbn=978-0-8093-8857-8|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breen claimed that plans to make such pictures were being coordinated through the [[Hollywood Anti-Nazi League]], which he claimed was "conducted and financed almost entirely by Jews". As a result of Breen's anticommunist views, the censorship board pressured [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] to drop plans to film [[Sinclair Lewis]]'s anti-fascist novel, ''[[It Can't Happen Here]]''.&lt;ref name="KoppesBlack2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Clayton R..

In 1938, largely in response to [[Nazi]] activities in Germany, [[Pope Pius XI]] denounced anti-Semitism, stating that "it is not possible for Christians to take part in anti-Semitism". In response to this encouragement, American Roman Catholics formed the [[Committee of Catholics to Fight Anti-Semitism]]. The two authors of the [[Will H. Hays|Hays Code]], [[Martin Quigley (publisher)|Martin J. Quigley]] and the [[Daniel A. Lord|Rev. Daniel Lord, SJ]], promoted the cause. Quigley asked Breen to help gather statements of support from Catholics in the Hollywood film industry. Breen did so, and issued a statement himself, which said, in part, "In my judgement there is nothing more important for us Catholics to do at the present moment [July 1939] than to use  our energies in stemming the tide of racial bigotry and hostility."&lt;ref name="Doherty2009"&gt;Doherty 2009, pp. 211–12&lt;/ref&gt;

===1941—1954===
Breen retired from the PCA in April 1941, announcing that his departure was due to overwork and exhaustion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SRNRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=V8oMAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=joseph-breen%20censor&amp;pg=5941%2C2938965|title=New Censor Sought by Movie Czar|publisher=The Telegraph-Herald|date=April 25, 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1941 and 1942 Breen was the general manager of [[RKO Pictures]].&lt;ref name=breening/&gt; He returned to the PCA in 1942.&lt;ref name="doherty"/&gt;

By the mid-1950s, Breen's power over Hollywood was diminishing. For instance, [[Samuel Goldwyn]] publicly insisted that the production code be revised. Around the same time, [[Howard Hughes]], owner of RKO, released ''[[The French Line]]'', featuring revealing images of actress [[Jane Russell]] in a bathing suit, despite the fact that Breen had refused to approve the picture for release.&lt;ref name=mosby&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XQ9MAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ASQNAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=joseph-breen%20censor&amp;pg=3848%2C4857657|title=Hollywood Report|author=Aline Mosby|publisher=Oxnard Press-Courier|date=March 17, 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Breen's office refused to approve [[Otto Preminger]]'s film ''[[The Moon Is Blue]]'' because of objections to the dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=j_srAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pMYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=joseph-breen%20censor&amp;pg=1025%2C6593513|title=Movie Censorship Faces Strongest Challenge Now|author=Bob Thomas|publisher=Times Daily|date=June 9, 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Artists]] backed Preminger in his decision to release the movie without Breen's approval.&lt;ref&gt;Fujiwara, Chris, ''The World and Its Double: The Life and Work of Otto Preminger''. New York: Macmillan Publishers 2009; {{ISBN|0-86547-995-X}}, pp. 140-42&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, the same year he retired, in responding to these events in an interview with Aline Mosby, Breen claimed that "[A]fter the events of the past 10 months — ''The French Line'', ''The Moon is Blue'' and Goldwyn — the code is more entrenched than ever before. Those events brought tremendous support from groups all over the country."&lt;ref name=mosby/&gt; Breen retired from the PCA and was replaced by Geoffrey Shurlock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_vlXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qfYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=joseph-breen%20censor&amp;pg=710%2C95570|title=Censors try tempering growing movie violence|author=Bob Thomas|publisher=Spokane Daily Chronicle|date=June 1, 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On his retirement he was presented with an honorary [[Academy Award]]&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt; for "his conscientious, open-minded and dignified management of the Motion Picture Production Code".&lt;ref&gt;Doherty 2009 p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Breen married Mary Dervin in February 1914, with whom he had six children, three boys and three girls.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty 2009 p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  Their son Joseph Breen, Jr. was a writer and director.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0106713/&lt;/ref&gt; One of their other children, Thomas, whose right leg was amputated due to a combat injury on [[Guam]] during World War II, was cast in a feature role in [[Jean Renoir]]'s 1950 film [[The River (1951 film)|''The River'']], playing a wounded war veteran. Renoir was not aware at the time that Thomas was Joseph Breen's son.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty 2009 pp. 70, 282&lt;/ref&gt;

After his retirement, Breen moved to [[Phoenix, Arizona]] with his wife Mary. He suffered from poor health in his later years and eventually lost the use of his legs. He died at the age of 77 on December 5, 1965, at the Brentwood Convalescent Home in Los Angeles and was buried at [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City]].&lt;ref&gt;Doherty 2009 pp. 346–48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
After Breen's death, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine wrote that Breen was "one of the most influential figures in American culture" and that "more than any single individual, he shaped the moral stature of the American motion picture."&lt;ref name="doherty"&gt;Doherty, Thomas Patrick. ''Pre-Code Hollywood: Sex, Immorality, and Insurrection in American Cinema 1930-1934''. New York: Columbia University Press 1999. {{ISBN|0-231-11094-4}}, pg. 9&lt;/ref&gt; The trade magazine went on to say that Breen enforced the PCA code "with a potent mix of missionary zeal and administrative tenacity."&lt;ref name="doherty"/&gt;

In the 2004 film ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]'', Breen was portrayed by [[Edward Herrmann]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5081">'''Karl Spindler''' (1887-1951) was a German Naval Officer who was involved in an attempt to bring German arms ashore in [[Ireland]] on behalf of Irish rebels as part of the [[Easter Rising]] of 1916.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heimatverein-siebengebirge.de/aktivitaet/artikel/spindlere.html Captain Karl Spindler], Siebengebirge e.V.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Spindler was born in the small town of [[Königswinter]], near [[Cologne]], [[Germany]] on 29 May 1887, the son of a quarry owner, Hubert Spindler and his wife Elise (née Fuchs).  At an early age Spindler decided to go to sea rather than join the family business, serving for a period as a watch officer on a Lloyd line steamship.  He subsequently enlisted in the marine school in [[Bremen]] and the naval academy in [[Sonderburg]], then part of Germany. He served on several ships of the [[German Imperial Navy]] and at the outbreak of the Great War, he was commanding the Polarstern, a guardship for the port of [[Wilhelmshaven]].

==Naval career==
On 20 March 1916 Spindler was given instructions by his senior officer to undertake a highly secret and dangerous mission on board a disguised merchant ship and to pick five officers and a crew of 16 to join him on the journey. He was given command of a vessel named ''[[SS Libau|Libau]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://corkshipwrecks.net/1916Aud.htm Shipwrecks of Cork Harbour] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130624220152/http://corkshipwrecks.net/1916Aud.htm |date=2013-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a captured British vessel formerly named "Castro" and informed that it was to be falsely flagged as a Norwegian freighter and carry a cargo of weapons to the West Coast of Ireland along with a passenger, Sir [[Roger Casement]]. It was part of a plan to land German arms in Ireland to assist Irish republicans in staging what would become the 1916 Rising. Spindler travelled to [[Berlin]] for further orders and met Casement there. However Casement preferred to travel on board a submarine which would accompany the ''Libau'' which was to be renamed the ''Aud'', the name of a real Norwegian ship, once it went to sea. Casement was later put ashore at Banna Strand in Co. Kerry from the submarine by means of a small collapsible boat. However Casement was arrested soon afterwards on [[Good Friday]], 21 April 1916, and taken prisoner in the Tower of London on charges of High Treason against the [[United Kingdom]]. He was subsequently executed by hanging at Pentonville Prison on 3 August 1916. The uprising had failed. Meanwhile, Spindler's ship, now renamed the ''Aud'', was intercepted by British naval vessels near the [[Blasket Islands]] and forced to sail for [[Cobh]] (then known as Queenstown) where the British had a major naval base. However Spindler instructed his crew to open the ship's sea-valves and blow an explosive charge in the hold. As they left the sinking ship the crew took down the false Norwegian flag she was flying and hoisted the German Imperial flag in its place. They then left the vessel on board two dinghies and were taken prisoners by the British. After some questioning they were taken as prisoners of war to Donington Hall. From there they later escaped only to be recaptured the following day. Spindler was in a weakened state after several bouts of ill-health, and in a [[prisoner exchange]] shortly before the end of the war he was transferred to the Netherlands. He subsequently travelled to the United States where he went on a lecture tour speaking of his ill-fated trip to Ireland and his connections with the Easter Rising. In 1921 Spindler published a book on the "Aud" episode which was translated into English as "The mystery of the Casement ship" or "The Mystery Ship" &lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0B10F83F5810738DDDAA0894D9405B818EF1D3 German Describes Effort to Arm Irish], New York Times, 3 January 1921&lt;/ref&gt; and had significant sales and was translated into several languages. He was feted by Irish-American groups in the US and received numerous awards.

==Later life==
Although he made several returns to Germany to see his family, Spindler remained in the United States for the rest of his life.  During World War II he was detained in an internment camp as an enemy alien as he failed to get permanent residency or naturalization in the US.  He was released in poor health at the end of that war.  Karl Spindler died on 29 November 1951 in Bismarck, North Dakota.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/59359748 Karl M Spindler], findagrave.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leonard Hugh Long''' [[Order of Australia|OAM]]  (25 April 1911 &amp;ndash; 3 November 2013)&lt;ref name="Obituary"&gt;{{cite news|last = Crawford|first = Robert|title = Famous Nowra artist Leonard Long dies at 102|newspaper = South Coast Register|date = 2013-11-04|url = http://www.southcoastregister.com.au/story/1885060/famous-nowra-artist-leonard-long-dies-at-102/?cs=203|accessdate = 2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Australia]]n [[Painting|painter]] of the Australian School of landscape painters.

==Early years==
Born in Summer Hill, [[New South Wales]], the son of a baker, Long was a landscape artist in oils. He was raised in [[Mittagong]] on the Southern Tablelands of [[New South Wales]] and showed an early aptitude for drawing.  He painted his first painting at the age of 16.  He started his working life as a [[watch-maker]] in nearby [[Bowral]] later moving to [[Nowra]] for work.&lt;ref name="Long1986"&gt;
{{cite book | last = Anon | title = Leonard Long | publisher = Gwynne Publishers | year = 1986 | location = Melbourne | isbn = 1-86252-445-9}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
As a young man Long was a cyclist and rode his push bike long distances including the trip from Nowra back to Mittagong to see his sweetheart Mary whom he later married. In 1934, he and Mary settled in [[Nowra]] where they raised their family. They had twins Ray and Barry in 1936 and a daughter Carmel in 1938.  By 1939, Long had become more seriously interested in Landscape Painting and spent more and more of his spare time painting. After returning from his civil service during the Second World War as a precision instrument maker, he sold his watch-making business to his partner and began full-time painting in 1955.&lt;ref name="Long1986"/&gt; 

==Exhibitions==
During his career, Long held many successful solo exhibitions throughout [[Australia]] and traveled extensively both within Australia and overseas. His first overseas trip was sponsored by the American millionaire John Galvin and the experience made a lasting impression on the artist. He knew and painted with many other Australian artists including [[Albert Namatjira]].&lt;ref name="footsteps"&gt;{{cite web | title  = In the Artist's Footsteps: Albert Namatjira Biography | publisher = Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs | url = http://www.artistsfootsteps.com/html/namatjira_biography.htm | accessdate = 2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His works may be found in many private collections and is represented in many public galleries around the world.&lt;ref name="Long1986"/&gt;

==Older years==
Long moved to [[Melbourne]] in 1980. On 26 January 1993, Long was awarded a [[Order of Australia|Medal of the Order of Australia]] 'for service to the arts as a painter of Australian landscapes.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Commonwealth of Australia|title=Its an Honour|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=870432&amp;search_type=simple&amp;showInd=true|work=www.itsanhonour.gov.au|publisher=Honours and Awards Branch, Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet|accessdate=2010-06-20|location=Canberra|date=1993-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 100, Long continued to paint every day and staged his centenary exhibition on 14 May 2011 at Kim Nelson Fine Art &amp; Editions in [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]], New South Wales, not far from the nation's capital, [[Canberra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.yass.nsw.gov.au/events/pages/14713.html | title = Leonard Long Centenary Exhibition | publisher = Yass Valley Council | accessdate = 28 March 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110327135835/http://www.yass.nsw.gov.au/events/pages/14713.html | archivedate = 27 March 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He attributed his continued health to an active life and a medicinal scotch in the afternoon.&lt;ref name="Centenary"&gt;{{Cite news|last = Prytz|first = Anna|title = Donvale artist long drawn to nature|newspaper = Manningham Leader|publisher = [[News Limited]]|date = 2011-05-07|url = http://manningham-leader.whereilive.com.au/news/story/donvale-artist-long-drawn-to-nature/|accessdate = 2011-05-09|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110728095526/http://manningham-leader.whereilive.com.au/news/story/donvale-artist-long-drawn-to-nature/|archivedate = 28 July 2011|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ernő Zórád Prize ==
Honoring a comic creator's outstanding yearly achievement. The prize was first awarded at the 100th anniversary of Ernő Zórád's birth with the contribution of the artist's family.
* 2011: Attila Futaki

== Kepregeny.net Audience Polls ==
Every year since 2006, Kepregeny.net gives place to the annual audience polls to record comic book fans' opinion on the preceding year's crop. These polls cover many topics, not only Hungarian comics, but also translated materials, journalists, etc. In the first two years the polls were held on the portal's forum, in 2008 it moved to its opening page.&lt;br/&gt;
Note: the year given in each poll refers to the year the comics were published (in contrary to the Alfabéta prize, where the year refers to date the prize was given.)

|title=Physicist accused of being spy for Stalin 
|publisher=The Independent 
|date=February 26, 1996 
|accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (January 11, 1913 – December 23, 1992), born '''Leontine Theresa Petka''', also known as '''Helen Kroger''', was an [[Americans|American]] [[espionage|spy]] for the [[Soviet Union]]. She was the wife of spy [[Morris Cohen (Soviet spy)|Morris Cohen]].

== Espionage ==

Lona Cohen was born '''Leontine Theresa Petka''' in [[Adams, Massachusetts]], the daughter of Polish [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TrlRaHFHspsC&amp;pg=PA207&amp;dq=%22Lona+Petka+Cohen%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAWoVChMIqYettdTIyAIVCzw-Ch375Qfz]&lt;/ref&gt; An American citizen, she was a member of the [[Communist Party USA]] and had been recruited into Soviet espionage in 1939 by her husband, [[Morris Cohen (Soviet spy)|Morris]]. She worked for Soviet case officers, including [[Anatoli Yatskov]], out of the New York ''[[Resident spy|rezidentura]]'' during [[World War II]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

After her husband was [[conscription|drafted]] in 1942, Cohen ran a network that included [[engineer]]s and [[technician]]s at munitions and [[aviation]] plants in the [[New York (state)|New York]] area. One of her sources smuggled a working model of a new machine gun out of a munitions plant. She worked at two defense plants, the Public Metal Company in [[New York City]] in 1941 and the Aircraft Screw Products plant on [[Long Island]] in 1943.

She was a courier who picked up reports from [[Theodore Hall]], and a source [[Code name|cover name]]d "FOGEL" and "PERS" from the American secret [[atomic weapons]] project at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory#History|Los Alamos]], [[New Mexico]] and carried them to the Soviet consulate in New York, where a [[KGB]] sub-residency under a young engineer, [[Leonid R. Kvasnikov]], coordinated operations and dispatched intelligence to [[Moscow]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

After the defections of [[Elizabeth Bentley]] and [[Igor Gouzenko]], the Cohens ended contact with Soviet intelligence until 1949, at which time they began working with Col. [[Rudolph Abel]], a U.S. based [[illegal resident]]. After [[Klaus Fuchs]] was arrested in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1950, Cohen and her husband fled to [[Moscow]], where she received additional training as a [[radio]] operator and [[cipher]] clerk. In 1954, the pair resurfaced in [[London]] under the names Helen and Peter Kroger with [[New Zealand]] [[passport]]s. They set up an antiquarian book business which was cover for their activities of running the London Illegal Rezidentura. [[Gordon Lonsdale]] worked with them as part of the [[Portland Spy Ring]].

While in London, the Cohens were friends with Frank and Nora Doel. [[Frank Doel]] is the bookseller whose correspondence with the author [[Helene Hanff]] became the bestseller, ''[[84 Charing Cross Road]]''. In her follow-up book, ''The Duchess of Bloomsbury Street'', Hanff reported an anecdote told her by Nora Doel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hanff |first=Helene |title=The Duchess of Bloomsbury Street |year=1976 |publisher=Avon |isbn=0-380-00634-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; One [[New Year's Eve]], the Doels gave a party at which Lona Cohen (aka Helen Kroger):

&lt;blockquote&gt;arrived looking very exotic in a long black evening dress. 'Helen, you look like a Russian spy!' said Nora. And Helen laughed and Peter laughed and a few months later Nora picked up the morning paper and discovered that Helen and Peter Kruger ''were'' Russian spies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Imprisonment ==

[[File:Cranley Drive, Ruislip - geograph.org.uk - 306570.jpg|thumb|right|Cohen house in [[Ruislip]], found full of transmitting equipment]]  In the basement of their house, at 45 Cranley Drive, Ruislip, situated not far from the military airfield of [[Northolt]], they set up a high speed radio transmitter and began sending Moscow "information of special importance". In January 1961, they were arrested for espionage, and in March, she received a sentence of 20 years while her husband got 25 years, of which they served only eight, until in 1969, the two were finally exchanged with the Soviet Union for a British subject called [[Gerald Brooke]].

Before being taken in custody, Mrs. Kroger had asked permission to stoke up the boiler. Before she could do so, Detective Superintendent Smith, a veteran "spy catcher" who was in charge of the arrest, insisted on checking her handbag first. It was found to contain microdots, the photographic reduction of documents, in order to make them small enough to be smuggled out of the country more easily.

==Personal and death==

[[File:Morris Cohen on Russian stamp.jpg|thumb|right|[[Morris Cohen (spy)|Morris Cohen]] on Russian stamp]]   In 1941, Cohen married [[Morris Cohen (spy)|Morris Cohen]], who recruited her to his espionage activities.

Cohen died in Moscow on December 23, 1992.

== Awards ==

Lona Cohen was awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner]] and [[Order of Friendship of Peoples|Order of Friendship of Nations]] by the Soviet Union.

==Legacy==
Once in [[Moscow]], the Cohens continued training colleagues for illegal intelligence operations.&lt;ref&gt;''Deep Cover: My Secret Life and Tangled Allegiances as a KGB Spy in America'', by Jack Barsky with Cindy Coloma, Carol Stream, IL: Tyndale Momentum. Chapter 16 is entirely about a KGB agent's memoir of being trained by the Cohen's in Moscow in the late 1970s.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[Image:PackOfLies.jpg|right|thumb|Poster for original West End production of ''[[Pack of Lies]]'' (1983)]] --&gt;
In 1983, the British playwright [[Hugh Whitemore]] dramatized the case as ''[[Pack of Lies]]'', which was performed in London's [[West End theatre]] district starring [[Judi Dench]] and [[Michael Williams (actor)|Michael Williams]]. It played on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] for 3½ months in 1985, for which [[Rosemary Harris]] won the best actress [[Tony award]] for her portrayal of the British neighbor of the Cohens/Krogers. It was made into a TV movie starring [[Ellen Burstyn]], [[Alan Bates]], [[Teri Garr]] and [[Daniel Benzali]] (as "Peter Schaefer," i.e., "Peter Kroger," i.e., Morris Cohen) which aired in the U.S. on [[CBS]] in 1987. The plot centered on the neighbors (and seeming friends) whose house was used as a base from which the security services could spy on the Cohens, and the way [[paranoia]], suspicion and betrayal gradually destroyed their lives during that time.

The Cohens' cover as antiquarian book dealers Peter and Helen Kroger is mentioned in [[Helene Hanff]]'s ''The Duchess of Bloomsbury Street'' because they were friends of London book dealer [[Frank Doel]], recipient of the letters and book orders that inspired the bestseller ''[[84 Charing Cross Road]]''.

'''Malaysians''' are the people who are identified with the country of [[Malaysia]], its citizens and their descendants worldwide. This connection may be residential, legal, historical, or cultural. For most Malaysians, several (frequently all) of those types of connections exist and are the source(s) of their being considered Malaysians. Although citizens make up the majority of Malaysians, non-citizen residents and overseas Malaysians may also claim a Malaysian identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2015/05/03/Survey-Most-prefer-to-be-known-as-Msian/|title=Survey: Most prefer to be known as Malaysian|author1=Neville Spykerman|author2=Michelle Tam|author3=Victoria Brown|publisher=The Star|date=3 May 2015|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country is home to people of various [[Nationality|national]], [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] and religious origins. As a result, many Malaysians do not equate their [[nationality]] with [[ethnicity]], but with [[citizenship]] and [[allegiance]] to Malaysia. Majority of the population, however, belong to several clearly defined [[ethnolinguistic]] groups within the country with their own distinct cultures and traditions: [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], [[Orang Asli]] (aboriginal population), [[Malaysian Chinese]] (primarily [[Han Chinese]]), [[Malaysian Indians]] (primarily [[Tamils]]). Malays themselves are the source of the name ''Malaysia'' ("land of Malays") as they traditionally formed the majority during the British rule. The majority of the non-Malay and non-aboriginal population in modern Malaysia is made up of immigrants and their descendants. Following the initial period of Portuguese, Dutch and then significantly longer British colonization, different waves (or peaks) of immigration and settlement of non-[[aboriginal peoples]] took place over the course of nearly five centuries and continue today.

[[Federation of Malaya Independence Act 1957|Malayan independence]] from [[United Kingdom]] in 1957 grew gradually over the course of latter part of the 20th century since the formation of the [[Federation of Malaya]] in 1948 (excluding [[Crown Colony of Singapore]], [[Crown Colony of North Borneo]] and [[Crown Colony of Sarawak]]). [[World War II]] in particular gave rise to a desire amongst Malayans to have their country recognised as a fully-fledged sovereign state with a distinct citizenship.

==Population==
{{main|Demographics of Malaysia}}
As of 2010, Malaysians make up 0.4% of the [[world population|world's total population]], having relied upon immigration for population growth and social development. Approximately 30% of current Malaysians are first- or second-generation immigrants, and 20 percent of Malaysian residents in the 2000s were not born in Malaysian soil. It is estimated, by 2031, nearly one-half of Malaysians above the age of 15 will be [[foreign born]] or have one foreign born parent. [[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|Bumiputera]], according to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150301154300/http://www.statistics.gov.my/portal/download_Population/files/census2010/Taburan_Penduduk_dan_Ciri-ciri_Asas_Demografi.pdf 2010 Malaysian Census], numbered at 17,523,508 or 61.85% of the country's 28,334,135 population.

Classification of [[2010 Malaysian Census|2010 Census]] ethnic group is as set by Inter-Agency Technical Committee (IATC) in Appendix 1. IATC is a committee formed to co-ordinate and monitor the implementation and use of standardised codes, classifications and definitions used by the Department of Statistics, Malaysia and other government agencies. For the purpose of tabulation and analysis, as well as taking into account the diverse ethnic group in Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, Federal Territory of Labuan and Sarawak, major ethnic groups according to region as follows:

'''Milica Šterić''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Милица Штерић}}; 1914-1998) was a Serbian architect who worked at [[Energoprojekt]] for many years, founding and heading its architecture department. She is also responsible for many of the power plants built in Yugoslavia, which helped rebuild the country's economy after the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name="zua.rs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zua.rs/sr/research/alfa-i-omega-arhitekture-energoprojekta/|title=Alfa i omega arhitekture Energoprojekta – Žene u arhitekturi|website=www.zua.rs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://architexx.org/women-in-architecture-book-release-announcement/#.WvDjgdQvzcc|title=Women in Architecture Book Release|date=1 March 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known for her modernist approach, she is one of the first women in Serbia to undertake large scale architectural projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gradnja.rs/prva-izlozba-zenskog-arhitektonskog-drustva/|title=Prva izložba Ženskog arhitektonskog društva|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Šterić was born in [[Smederevo]], Serbia and studied architecture in [[Belgrade]], graduating in 1937. Once World War 2 was over, she was hired by Elektroistok in 1947. She then worked at [[Energoprojekt]] from 1951 until 1985,&lt;ref name="aas.org.rs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aas.org.rs/steric-milica-biografija/|title=Šterić, Milica - AKADEMIJA ARHITEKTURE SRBIJE|website=aas.org.rs}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she became their chief architect. She initially focused on constructing industrial and infrastructural buildings for both companies, designing several power plants throughout [[Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name="zua.rs"/&gt; Her first thermal power plant was built in [[Kostolac]] in 1948 and was called ''Mali Kostolac''. She went on to construct ''Kolubara A'' in [[Veliki Crljeni]] in 1956. She also built the ''Kakanj'' plant near [[Zenica]] and the ''Velenje'' plant in [[Slovenia]].

In 1957, Šterić spent half a year in the [[Netherlands]] working at the architectural firm ''Van den Broek and Bakeme'' where she learnt more about the Bauhaus style. After returning to Serbia, she applied her new skills and built a commercial building on Carice Milice 2 street. Constructed in 1957, the building's facade is a combination of steel and glass, underscored by horizontal bands of windows. Just down the road, Šterić also built the headquarters of [[Energoprojekt]] in 1960, which later became the Beobank building.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ephydro.com/about/downloads/ep-group/ep-60-years-of-success.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zua.rs"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aas.org.rs/predugi-cas-anatomije/|title=Predugi čas anatomije - AKADEMIJA ARHITEKTURE SRBIJE|website=aas.org.rs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politika.co.rs/sr/clanak/368444/Iz-sestog-pokusaja-zgrada-Beobanke-prodata-za-4-25-miliona-evra|title=Iz šestog pokušaja zgrada Beobanke prodata za 4,25 miliona evra|first=D. Aleksić / D.|last=Mučibabić|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first structure in [[Belgrade]] with free standing pillars and a transparent glass facade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mondo.rs/a1061959/Info/Beograd/Zgrada-Beobanke-imace-zelenu-fasadu.html|title=ATRAKCIJA! Zgrada Beobanke imaće zelenu fasadu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several housing projects in [[Bor, Serbia|Bor]], [[Bijeljina]], [[Kladovo]], [[Smederevo]], and [[Herceg Novi]] were designed by her in the 1960s, as well as a power station in [[New Belgrade]]. From the 1970s onwards, she was responsible for the construction of various public buildings in [[Smederevo]], such as a department store, a children's institution, and cultural center.

Šterić participated in international competitions, winning several contracts. During the 1970s, she co-designed the ministerial building in [[Kanou]], Nigeria, along with fellow architect [[Zoran Bojović (architect)|Zoran Bojović]]. She also built the Cimpata military settlement in [[Zambia]] and co-designed a Bedouin settlement in [[Kuwait]] consisting of 5,000 houses.

==Awards and Honours==
In 1984, Šterić received the "Grand prix d'architecture" from the "Union of Architects of Serbia".&lt;ref name="aas.org.rs"/&gt; In 1994, she was a member of the committee that created the "Academy of Architecture of Serbia" the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=1277440|title=Nakaradan i nepopravljiv plan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the "Belgrade International Architecture Week" festival&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bina.rs/|title=BINA - Beogradska internacionalna nedelja arhitekture|first=Super|last=User|website=www.bina.rs}}&lt;/ref&gt; organized a walking tour of [[Belgrade]] buildings that were constructed by women architects such as Šterić.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zua.rs/sr/events/bina-%D1%85-setnja-zene-u-arhitekturi-izmedu-1900-i-1960/|title=BINA Х – Šetnja Žene u arhitekturi između 1900. i 1960. – Žene u arhitekturi|website=www.zua.rs}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, she was one of several female pioneers reviewed in the book "''Women in Architecture - Contemporary architecture in Serbia since 1900''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zua.rs/sr/news/knjiga-zene-u-arhitekturi/|title=Knjiga Žene u arhitekturi – Žene u arhitekturi|website=www.zua.rs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nazism sidebar}}
A '''Nazi punk''' is a [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] who is part of the [[punk subculture]]. The term also describes the related music genre,&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Amy. ''The Official Punk Rock Book of Lists.'' Backbeat Books, 2007. p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; which is sometimes also referred to as '''hatecore'''. Nazi Punk music generally sounds like other forms of [[punk rock]], but differs by having lyrics that express hatred of some [[Minority groups|ethnic minorities]], [[Jews]], [[homosexuality |homosexuals]],[[anarchism| anarchists]], and other perceived enemies. 

It is a subgenre of punk that contrasts sharply with the [[anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]] ideas prevalent in much of the punk subculture. While early punks including [[Sid Vicious]] and [[Siouxsie Sioux]] incorporated Nazi imagery such as [[Swastika|Swastikas]], this has commonly been interpreted as an attempt to shock, rather than as a genuine belief in principles of Nazism.  In the long-standing band [[The Exploited]], [[Wattie Buchan]] has been regularly questioned about his swastika tattoo and he has constantly denied being a racist.&lt;ref name=Documentary&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJj6x0neC7E Documentary on the history of the band The Exploited&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978 in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] [[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]] had a punk-oriented youth organization called the Punk Front.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Simon. ''Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978-1984.'' Penguin (Non-Classics), 2006. p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Punk Front only lasted one year, it recruited several [[English people|English]] punks, as well as forming a number of [[White supremacy|white power]] punk bands such as The Dentists, The Ventz, Tragic Minds and White Boss.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Simon, ''Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978-1984'' (Penguin (Non-Classics), 2006), p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sabin, Roger, ''Punk Rock: So What?: The Cultural Legacy of Punk.'' (Routledge, 1999), pp. 207-208.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1980s, the [[white power skinhead]] band Brutal Attack temporarily transformed into a Nazi punk band.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.detour-records.co.uk/STRAPS.htm "The Straps: History"]&lt;/ref&gt; They said they did that in the hopes of getting public concerts booked easier, but this tactic did not work, and they soon returned to being a racist skinhead band.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The Nazi Punk subculture appeared in the [[United States]] by the early 1980s in the [[hardcore punk]] scene.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Mark. ''Dance of Days: Two Decades of Punk in the Nation's Capital.'' Akashic Books, 2003. p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flynn, Michael. ''Globalizing the Streets.'' Columbia University Press, 2008. p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nevvare Hanım''' (4 May 1901 – 22 June 1992) was the fourth wife of Sultan [[Mehmed VI]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]].{{sfn|Uluçay|2011|p=263}}

==Early life==
Nevvare Hanım was born on 4 May 1901{{sfn|Uluçay|2011|p=263}} in Derbent, [[Ottoman Empire]].{{sfn|Açba|2004|p=194}} Born as Ayşe Çıhçı, she was a member of [[Abkhazians|Abkhazian]] noble family, Çıhçı. Her father was Mustafa Bey Çıhcı, the son of Süleyman Bey Çıhçı. Her mother was Hafize Hanım Kap-Ipha, the daughter of Nevruz Bey Kap-Ipha.{{sfn|Açba|2004|p=77}}{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=196}} She had two elder siblings, Şefika Hanım and Ahmet Şükrü Bey, and four younger siblings, Hasan Bey, Fikri Bey, Halime Hanım and Hacer Nüvit Hanım.{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=199}} Through her grandfather, she was related to [[Müveddet Kadın]], third wife of Sultan [[Mehmed VI]], whose grandfather Mat Bey was a brother of Süleyman Bey.{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=194, 196}} 

As a young child, she had been sent to live-in Mehmed's Çengelköy mansion when he had been a prince, where after sometime she became a lady-in-waiting to Müveddet Kadın. Her name according to the costum of the Ottoman court was Nevvare.{{sfn|Açba|2004|p=75}}{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=196}}

==First marriage==
Nevvare married Mehmed on 20 June 1918 in the [[Dolmabahçe Palace]].{{sfn|Uluçay|2011|p=263}}{{sfn|Sakaoğlu|2008|p=707}}{{sfn|Açba|2004|p=194}} Mehmed was fifty seven, while Nevvare was seventeen years old. Nevvare remained childless.{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=197}} After Mehmed's accession to the throne on 4 July 1918,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Sylvia|last=Kedourie|title=Turkey: Identity, Democracy, Politics|publisher=Routledge|year=February 4, 2014|pages=22|isbn=978-1-135-22946-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was given the title of "Baş Ikbal".{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=197}} 

After Mehmed's deposition in 1922, he was sent into exile in [[Sanremo|San Remo]]. She, like rest of the family members, was imprisoned in [[Feriye Palace]]. Although, she wanted to go to San Remo, however, because of her illness, she went to live-in with her family in Derbent. The two divorced on 20 May 1924 on her request.{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=197}}{{sfn|Uluçay|2011|p=263}}

==Second marriage==
Nevvare returned to Istanbul, and married a trader named Mevlüd  Sönmezler in 1926, and took the name Leyla Sönmezler. They first settled in Ferenyolu, then in [[Şişli]]. In the beginning of 1970s they settled in Derbent.{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=197-8}} Her husband died in 1974.{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=199}}

==Death==
Nevvare died on 22 June 1992 in her mansion in Derbent, and was buried in a cemetery in Derbent.{{sfn|Açba|2004|p=194}}{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=198}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6602">'''Clement Ntsu Sejabanana Mokhehle''' (26 December 1918 – 6 January 1999) was a [[Lesotho]] politician. He served as the 3rd [[Heads of Government of Lesotho|Prime Minister]] of the country from 2 April 1993 to 17 August 1994 and from 14 September 1994 to 29 May 1998.

Mokhehle was born at the small village of Mokhehle, which located few miles from [[Teyateyaneng]] on 26 December 1918. His father, Cicerone Mokhehle, was the headman of the village and one of the early Basotho Inspector of Schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Khaketla|first1=B.

He published articles in the Basotho newspaper ''Mochochonono'' and later involved in protesting activities which led to his expulsion from the university in 1942. Mokhehle joined the Lekhotla la Bafo during his time in Lesotho. He returned to Fort Hare University in 1944 and graduated with a MSC degree in Zoology after discovered several new species of parasites. 

He joined the African National Congress as a student in Fort Hare university and was instrumental in formation of ANC Youth League and became a chartered member. He return to Lesotho continue with politics and founded the Basutoland Congress Party (renamed [[Basotho Congress Party]] after independence in 1966) in 1952 and led the party (served as its first party president) until 1997 when he resigned and formed a new political party, [[Lesotho Congress for Democracy]] (LCD). He fought colonial rule in Lesotho and demanded greater self-rule. He also founded the influential ''Mohlabani (The Warrior)'' and ''Makatolle'' political newspapers. His outspoken political views caused him to be dismissed from his teaching position at Basutoland High School in 1954. His party Basutoland Congress Party won many seats during the first elections held in Lesotho in 1960. In the 1965 elections, Basutoland Congress Party came second to Basotho National Party of Leabua Jonathan. Following the 1965 elections, he formed an unsuccessful alliance with King [[Moshoeshoe II of Lesotho|Moshoeshoe II]] to block Lesotho's independence unless another general election is held and paramount chiefs were given greater authority. The alliance ended when Moshoeshoe II gethering was suppressed by the government at [[Thaba Bosiu]] in December 1966. In 1970 Basotho Congress Party won the elections and the Prime minister Leabua Jonathan refused to relinquish power, suspended the constitution and declared state of emergency. He seized power by force and many were imprisoned without trial for over a year. It was clear Leabua was an anti-democrat and he ruled through the barrel of the gun. In 1974, Basotho Congress Party tried unsuccessfully size power by attacking police stations and following that many were arrested, killed and reign of terror by Chief Leabua continued. Ntsu Mokhehle fled Lesotho and went into exile and resided in Botswana, Zambia and South Africa. During his exile, he presided over the establishment of [[Lesotho Liberation Army]] and worked covertly with South African security forces in destabilizing Lesotho.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scott Rosenberg|first1=Richard F. Weisfelder|title=Historical Dictionary of Lesotho|date=13 June 2013|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810879829|page=352-354|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=B2TWVN92hYYC&amp;pg=PA353&amp;lpg=PA353&amp;dq=ntsu+clement&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iOmsGHaTZM&amp;sig=0wI3EXBpq8t7J6Y_Iefq9PyPfo8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mokhehle was awarded honorary doctorates by Fort Hare University in 1996 and [[National University of Lesotho]] in 1990.

The dictator [[Leabua Jonathan]] was overthrown by the Military, which facilitated the return of him along with others in February 1989. Basotho Congress Party of Ntsu Mokhehle won the 1993 election by landslide which deemed fair by international observers and he ruled until 1998. He led Basotho Congress Party until 1997 when he resigned and formed a new political party, [[Lesotho Congress for Democracy]] (LCD). He did not attend an LCD conference in late January 1998 due to poor health and did not seek to be re-elected as party leader, but the party re-elected him anyway. After Mokhehle insisted he could not lead the party any longer, a new conference was held and Deputy Prime Minister [[Pakalitha Mosisili]] was elected as party leader on 21 February.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trc.org.ls/events/events19.981.htm#Lesotho%20Congress%20for%20Democracy%20Vacillates%20Before%20Electing%20New%20Leader "Lesotho Congress for Democracy Vacillates Before Electing New Leader"], Summary of Events in Lesotho, Volume 5, Number 1, First Quarter 1998, trc.org.ls.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207001059/http://www.trc.org.ls/events/events19.981.htm#Lesotho%20Congress%20for%20Democracy%20Vacillates%20Before%20Electing%20New%20Leader |date=February 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The LCD won the [[Lesotho general election, 1998|parliamentary election]] that followed, and Mosisili replaced Mokhehle as Prime Minister.

Mokhehle died in [[Bloemfontein]], [[South Africa]] on 6 January 1999.

Hill Special Collection, MS2010-068; http://spec.lib.vt.edu/aerosp/aerospgd/hill.htm&lt;/ref&gt; mid–twentieth-century American [[aerodynamicist]]. He was a leading research and development engineer and manager for [[NASA]] (National Aeronautical and Space Administration) and its predecessor, [[NACA]] (the National Advisory Council for Aeronautics) between 1939 and 1970, retiring as Associate Chief, Applied Materials and Physics Division at the NASA Langley Research Centre.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, J. R., 1986, Engineer in Charge, NASA, p417, https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4305/&lt;/ref&gt; He is arguably most widely known today as the author of ''Unconventional Flying Objects: a Scientific Analysis''.&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;Hill, P. R., 1995, Unconventional Flying Objects: a Scientific Analysis, Hampton Roads Publishing Company Inc., Charlottesville, VA. {{ISBN|1-57174-027-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Hill was born in [[Odebolt, Iowa]] in February 1909.&lt;ref name="Obituaryof"&gt;Obituary of Paul Richard Hill, Hampton Roads (VA) Daily Press - Apr 12, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating  with a B.S. in mechanical engineering from [[University of California]], Berkeley in 1936 he was Professor of [[Aeronautics]]  at the Polytechnic College of Engineering in [[Oakland, California]] for three years before joining the National Advisory Committee of Aeronautics (NACA) in 1939. He continued to work in a range of senior R&amp;D management roles when NACA became the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1958 at the NASA [[Langley Research Center]].&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt; Hill was married to Frances Hoback Hill (d. 1999). They had one daughter, Julie M. Hill.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;  Paul Richard Hill died on April 9, 1990 in the James River Regional Convalescent Centre, Newport News, Virginia, USA.&lt;ref name="Obituaryof" /&gt;

The Paul R Hill Special Collection is held by the Archives of American Aerospace.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt; He was awarded NASA's [[NASA Exceptional Service Medal|Exceptional Service Medal]] in 1969.&lt;ref name="bare_url_a"&gt;SP-4012 NASA Historical Data Book: Volume IV, Appendix A: National Aeronautics and Space Administration Honor Awards. https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4012/vol4/appa.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This award was "… granted for significant achievement or service characterized by unusual initiative or creative ability that clearly demonstrates substantial improvement in engineering, {{sic|administative}} space flight, or space-related endeavors which contribute to NASA programs".&lt;ref name="bare_url_a" /&gt; In 1970 Hill received a citation for outstanding scientific leadership for "directing research applicable to space laboratories and other spacecraft."&lt;ref name="Hill" /&gt;

==NACA and NASA Research==
During the second world war Hill co-authored a number of technical NACA papers,&lt;ref&gt;Brevoort, M. J., Stickle, G. W, Hill, P.R., 1942, 'Effect of airplane design efficiency and engine economy on range', NACA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hill, P.R., Crigler, J. L., 1943, 'The effect of altitude on bomber performance', NACA.&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on aerodynamic aspects of aircraft performance. Hill was also involved in NACA collaboration with the [[Republic Aircraft Company]], assisting in the design of the highly successful [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47 fighter]]. Hill's specific role was in the aerodynamic design.&lt;ref name="Hill" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Naiman, I., Hill, P. R., 1941, 'The effect of external shape upon the drag of a scoop', NACA.&lt;/ref&gt; In the immediate post war period Hill made a number of significant contributions to the development of ram jet technology, including establishing and supervising the [[Wallops Island]] [[ram jet]] test flight programme and authoring the first NACA technical paper on ram jet technology.&lt;ref name="Hill" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hill, P. R., 1946, 'Parameters determining performance of supersonic pilotless airplanes powered by ram-compression power plants', NACA.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1950s, in part inspired by his personal interest in the 'flying saucer' or '[[UFO]]' phenomenon, Hill began experimenting in his own time with kinesthetically controlled flying platforms. This led to an official project, which Hill initiated with [[Charles H. Zimmerman|Charles Zimmerman]], who had been independently working on similar concepts for some time. This project designed and test flew such platforms in collaboration with the [[United States Air Force]], the [[Royal Canadian Airforce]] and the US [[Office of Naval Research]]. The increased understanding of the aerodynamic and performance characteristics of such platforms informed future design work for the [[Lunar Landing Module]] (LM), other VTOL designs and experiments with disc shaped aircraft in the period.&lt;ref name="Hill" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bare_url_a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zimmermann, C. H., Hill, P.R., Kennedy, T.L., 1953, 'Preliminary experimental investigation of the flight of a person supported by a jet thrust device attached to his feet', NACA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hill, P. R., Kennedy, T. L., 1954, 'Flight tests of a man standing on a platform supported by a teetering rotor.' NACA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, D. E.,Thomas, D. F., Hill, P. R., 1970, 'Lunar flying platform simulator', NASA.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1950s Hill was part of a specially-assembled advisory panel of "great men";&lt;ref name="Brodsky"&gt;Brodsky, R. F., 2006, On the Cutting Edge, Gordian Knot Books, pp31, 45-46.&lt;/ref&gt; aerodynamicists advising [[Sandia Labs]] on problems encountered with the design of the second generation bombs ([[H Bomb]]s). In addition to Hill, who at this time headed NACA's Pilotless Aircraft Division, the "great men" listed by Dr Robert F Brodsky of Sandia Labs in his memoir&lt;ref name="Brodsky" /&gt; were [[Jack Northrop]] (founder of [[Northrop Aircraft]]), [[George S. Schairer|George Schairer]] (Chief of aerodynamics at [[Boeing]]), [[Ira H. Abbott]] ("a legendary engineer"), [[Ed Heinemann]] (Chief engineer [[Douglas Aircraft]]), Dr. Alex Charters ("a famous ballistician"), Al Sibilia (Vought aircraft chief of aerodynamics), Dr. Charles Poor (Chief Scientist Army's Ballisic Research Laboratory), and "several other distinguished engineers". It was Hill and Charters, however, whom Brodsky called the "heroes". Hill's specific contribution was in diagnosing the aerodynamic problems in the bomb design, though Brodsky acknowledges that at the time they were ignored until a year later when the Sandia scientists realized they were right. "Both experts were correct, but they were too far ahead of us technically".&lt;ref name="Brodsky" /&gt;

In 1956 the US Air Force established project HYWARDS, with the aim of developing a hypersonic design capable of up to Mach 12, as a successor to the [[X-15]].&lt;ref name="bare_url_c"&gt;Hansen, J. R., 1986, Engineer in Charge, NASA, Chp 12, https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4305/ch12.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The aerospace historian, James Hansen notes that a number of NACA engineers later joined the initial HYWARDS study group at Langley Research Centre "notably Paul Hill, configuration and propulsion…".&lt;ref name="bare_url_c" /&gt; Hill made a number of important contributions, particularly in the design of [[hypersonic wind tunnel]]s.&lt;ref name="Hill" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hill, P. R., 1957, 'A method of computing the transient temperature of thick walls from arbitrary variation of adiabatic-wall temperature and heat-transfer coefficient', NACA.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1959 Hill became involved in research for a future lunar mission. A lunar study group was established under the leadership of Clint Brown who asked for the participation of six of "Langley's most thoughtful analysts: David Adamson, Supersonic Aerodynamics Division; Paul R. Hill, PARD; John C. Houbolt, Dynamic Loads Division; Albert A. Schy, Stability Research Division; Samuel Katzoff, Full-Scale Research Division; and Bill Michael of his own Theoretical Mechanics Division".&lt;ref name="bare_url_d"&gt;Hansen, J. R., 1995, Spaceflight Revolution: NASA Langley Research Center from Sputnik to Apollo, NASA history series SP-4308, http://purl.access.gpo.gov/GPO/LPS69854&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of many study groups to examine a lunar mission during the period, with arguably its major contribution being in initiating the concept of rendezvous in orbit between a lander and a main spacecraft.".&lt;ref name="bare_url_d" /&gt;

Space station research began in earnest at NASA-Langley in the early 1960s and Hill played a prominent role. The historian [[James Hansen]] describes Hill as one of two " key members of Langley's early space station research" (along with Robert Osborne),&lt;ref name="bare_url_d" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hill, P., R., Schnitzer, E., 1962  "Rotating Manned Space Stations."  Astronautics, vol. 7, no. 9, pages 14-18.  American Rocket Society.&lt;/ref&gt; with again much of Hill's pioneering work feeding into later developments.&lt;ref name="bare_url_d" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;Hall, T., D., 1994, The Architecture of Artificial Gravity Environments for Long Duration Space Habitation, Ph.D Thesis, University of Michigan.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Of all those who contributed to the Moon decision, the ones farthest in the background were the engineers of Langley and Goddard and Marshall, many of whom devoted their lives to spaceflight, designing dreams ...".&lt;ref name="Hall" /&gt;

==Interest in Unidentified Flying Objects==
Hill maintained a long-term interest in Unidentified Flying Objects. He had two personal UFO sightings. The first, on July 16, 1952, was with his future wife, Frances Hoback, and was reported to the USAF [[Project Blue Book|Blue Book project]].&lt;ref&gt;Hill – Hoback report of 16th July 1952. Project Bluebook archive pages MAXW-PBB12-435, MAXW-PBB12-436 and MAXW-PBB12-437; www.bluebookarchive.org/
&lt;/ref&gt; This sighting was officially classified as aeroplanes as a flight of bombers were in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Hill – Hoback report of 16th July 1952 case evaluation. Project Bluebook archive page reference MAXW-PBB12-318; www.bluebookarchives.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The then head of Blue Book, Captain (later Major) [[Edward Ruppelt]] was later to write of the case, however,

"The only possible solution to the sighting was that the two men (sic) had seen airplanes. We investigated this report and found that there were several B-26's from [[Langley AFB]] in the area at the time of the sighting, but none of the [[Martin B-26 Marauder|B-26]] pilots remembered being over Hampton Roads. In fact, all of them had generally stayed well south of Norfolk until about 10:30P.M. because of thunderstorm activity northwest of Langley. Then there were other factors - the observers heard no sound and they were away from all city noises, aircraft don't carry just one or two amber lights, and the distance between the two lights was such that had they been on an airplane the airplane would have been huge or very close to the observers. And last, but not least, the man from the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics was a very famous aerodynamicist and of such professional stature that if he said the lights weren't airplanes they weren't."&lt;ref&gt;Ruppelt, E., J., 1956, ''Report on Unidentified Flying Objects'', Doubleday, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

Hill's second personal UFO sighting, in 1962, was not reported to Blue Book, but is described in his book.&lt;ref name="Hill" /&gt;

Hill was a strong proponent of the extraterrestrial hypothesis, which suggests that some UFOs represent structural craft of extraterrestrial origin. After retiring from NASA he developed his analysis with the aim of demonstrating that those UFOs that are not misidentifications of mundane objects or phenomena, have a coherent and consistent set of performance characteristics that are in line with what is allowable within physical theory. Hill presented his case within his book, ''Unconventional Flying Objects: A Scientific Analysis''.&lt;ref name="Hill" /&gt; The book was published posthumously, following a number of rejections from publishers during Hill's lifetime.&lt;ref name="Interviewwith"&gt;Interview with Julie M Hill, 2000; www.thiemeworks.com/interview-with-julie-hill-daughter-of-paul-r-hill/&lt;/ref&gt;

''Unconventional Flying Objects'' was well received by the ufology community&lt;ref&gt;Puthoff, H. E., 1997, 'Synopsis of Unconventional Flying Objects: JSE Review', Journal of Scientific Exploration.&lt;/ref&gt; and is widely referenced by authors interested in UFOs,&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, D., M., 2000, UFOs and Abductions: Challenging the Borders of Knowledge, p354, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence KS., {{ISBN|0-7006-1032-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haisch, B.

==Interest in psi phenomenon==
In an interview in 2000 Hill's daughter, Julie, described her father's interest in psi research:

"He spoke about a friend who was a psychic and experiments they did. He said he set up a pinwheel experiment – I don't know how, but he knew how to set up an experiment that would be valid – and he told me that for about a week he could turn it with his mind, with his thoughts, but after about a week he couldn't do it anymore. He also told me a story about being in a car parked on the street, he was into thought experiments, and he said he projected a thought into her mind to get into my car, and as the woman was walking by the car she stopped, opened the door and sat down and looked at him, and I don't know if she shrieked or what but she was absolutely stunned at what she was doing. He said, I willed her to get into the car, and she did. I think he was as shocked as she was. They were both shocked.
He told me when I was in my late teens, and this was before Shirley Maclaine and astral projection, that when he slept, he could float out of his body at night and float on the ceiling and look down and watch himself sleep. He never said he went anywhere or saw fantastic things, just that he left his body and watched himself sleep".&lt;ref name="Interviewwith" /&gt;

None of these experiments were subject to peer review or published in any other way, however.

'''Pundalik Narayan Naik''' (born 1952) is a [[Konkani-language]] poet, short-story writer, novelist, playwright, and screenwriter from [[Goa]]. He has 40 books and two films to his credit.&lt;ref name=dai&gt;{{cite web |title=Second Edition of Pundalik N Naik's 'Acchev' Released |url=http://www.daijiworld.com/news/news_disp.asp?n_id=63782&amp;n_tit=Panaji%3A+Second+Edition+of+Pundalik+N+Naik%27s+%27Acchev%27+Released |date=7 August 2009 |publisher=''[[Daijiworld Media]]'' |access-date=21 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023003121/http://www.daijiworld.com/news/news_disp.asp?n_id=63782&amp;n_tit=Panaji%3A+Second+Edition+of+Pundalik+N+Naik%27s+%27Acchev%27+Released# |archive-date=23 October 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ge|George, p.334]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nav&gt;[http://www.navhindtimes.in/iwatch/pundalik-naik-bestowed-gomant-sharda-puraskar Pundalik Naik bestowed with Gomant Sharda Puraskar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807141541/http://www.navhindtimes.in/iwatch/pundalik-naik-bestowed-gomant-sharda-puraskar |date=7 August 2011 }} ''[[Navhind Times]]'', 31 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achievements==

He served as the President of [[Goa Konkani Akademi]] (Goa Academy of Letters for Konkani) of the [[Government of Goa]] since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goakonkaniakademi.org/committees/officebearers.htm|title=Officers Of Goa Konkani Akademi|publisher=[[Goa Konkani Akademi]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223190600/http://goakonkaniakademi.org/committees/officebearers.htm|archivedate=23 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; His novel ''Acchev'' (The Upheaval, 1977) and the first Konkani novel to be translated into English, is considered a landmark in the history of the language.&lt;ref name=dai/&gt;  It is a story based in a Goa wrecked by rampant mining.

''Acchev'' has been described as a novel which "describes peasant life in the Ponda [sub-]district and shows what happens when a traditional society that lives by myths and rituals comes into contact with modern mechanised ways of life."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1913/19130720.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Manohar Shetty, in a review in the ''Deccan Herald'', writes: "Pundalik Naik's novel is set in this grim backdrop, chronicling in detail the decay of a self-sufficient agricultural community with the impassive invasion of the mining industry. Naik's novel, the first to be translated from Konkani, created something of a sensation when it appeared in 1977. No other writer in Goa had portrayed in such graphic and brutal detail the ruinous fallouts on small agricultural holdings by the bulldozers of big industry. Pandhari, the protagonist of the novel, is the first to fall into the tempting shaft. Just before the auspicious day of sowing, Babuso, a wily and unscrupulous go-between, approaches him for his services as a load-bearer and to hire his bullock-cart to carry ore from the mines. Pandhari succumbs to the allure of quick money and in an instant becomes a bonded labourer and the bullocks, which once ploughed the life-sustaining fields, become a transport vehicle, the cart laden with the metallic spoils of the pillaged land."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/goanet/conversations/topics/21567# |title=Archived copy |access-date=20 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305143823/https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/goanet/conversations/topics/21567# |archive-date=5 March 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have complained that "his works are pretty difficult to bring into English and other languages".&lt;ref name="Translators"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/goa-book-club/A7RJ7jYSzqc |title=Archived copy |access-date=20 November 2018 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20110122130054/https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/goa-book-club/A7RJ7jYSzqc#!topic/goa-book-club/A7RJ7jYSzqc |archive-date=22 January 2011 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also an essay (translated into English by Vidya Pai) explaining how Naik's ''Acchev'' happened. This essay (in Konkani) was originally published in the special issue of the [[Konkani]] literary magazine ''Jaag'' released to celebrate 150 years of the Konkani novel in early 2012.&lt;ref name="Translators" /&gt;

During a five-day theatre festival on the plays of Pundalik Naik, called ''Natyarang Pancham'', held in 2011, the plays staged were ''Shabay Shabay Bhaujan Samaj'', ''Kaansulo'', ''Suring'', ''Chaityanak Math Naa'' and ''Shree Vichitrachi Jatra''.&lt;ref name="Festival"/&gt;

Naik took to writing plays in 1977. The Shubham Naik Trust and the Directorate of Art and Culture had organised a festival of selected Konkani plays of Pundalik Naik at five regional centers including Masordem—Sattari, Mandrem—Pernem, Sanguem, Chaudi—Canacona and Shiroda—Ponda.&lt;ref name="Festival" /&gt;

Naik has also written plays for radio and television, and has edited films.

==Other awards==

'''Radwaniyah Palace''' (also known as ''Al Radwaniyah Presidential Complex'') is a palace in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]], which functioned as a presidential resort for the late Iraqi dictator [[Saddam Hussein]] until it was taken over by coalition forces during the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. Inside it was decorated with marble, luxury furniture and monuments dedicated to Saddam. Located in western [[Baghdad]], Radwaniyah Palace was the main presidential site for Saddam and was a typical Presidential site.  It is bordered on the north by Qasr Tall Mihl and Al Urdun (Jordan) Street; on the south by sparse, outlying neighborhoods; on the east by suburbs Al 'Amiriyah and Hayy al-Furat; and on the west by [[Baghdad International Airport]]. High walls surround the former resort; watchtowers contribute to more readily maintaining surveillance and security for the site.

In addition to having two man-made hills and several man-made lakes, it houses two presidential palaces. The northern one usually goes by the more familiar name, [[Al Faw Palace]]. The southern one is known as the Victory Over Iran Palace.

Coalition installations [[Camp Liberty]], [[Camp Victory]] and [[Camp Slayer]] used to occupy Al Radwaniyah's grounds.

'''Red Bird''' ({{circa|lk=no|1788}}&amp;ndash;1828) was a leader of the Winnebago (or [[Ho-Chunk]]) [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribe. He was a leader in the [[Winnebago War]] against the [[United States]]. He was for many years one of the most friendly and trusted of the Wisconsin Native Americans. In the late 1820s Red Bird and his followers began to grow uneasy over the encroachments of [[Mineral Point, Wisconsin|lead]] [[Dodgeville, Wisconsin|miners]] on Ho-Chunk land. The tribe was also disturbed by the mistaken belief that two Ho-Chunk had been put to death at [[Fort Snelling]] in 1826 for a murder they did not commit. Near Prairie du Chien on June 28, 1827, Red Bird and three companions followed the Indian code of revenge and under the influence of liquor murdered Registre Gagnier and Solomon Lipcap and seriously injured Gagnier's infant daughter. They fled after Gagnier's wife and son escaped and gave the alarm in [[Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin|Prairie du Chien]].&lt;ref name = "wihistsoc"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 30, 1827, a band of Ho-Chunk fired on the [[Wisconsin River]] keelboat ''Oliver Perry'' killing two of the crew and wounding several others. With an Indian war threatening, the militia was mobilized and Federal troops were dispatched to Prairie du Chien from [[Jefferson Barracks Military Post|Jefferson Barracks, Mo.]] To avert a general war, Red Bird and his companions surrendered at [[Portage, Wisconsin|Portage]] on Sept. 2, 1827. Although the chief expected the dignity of being put to death, he was instead taken to Prairie du Chien where he died in prison, Feb. 16, 1828.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Subject==
The birth of Shaka, the historical Buddha ([[Sanskrit]]: [[Gautama|Siddhārtha Gautama]] or Śākyamuni), is one of the eight major events in the life of the Buddha that formed a popular subject for artistic representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/s/shakahassou.htm |title=Shaka hassou |publisher=[[Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System]] |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/s/shaka.htm |title=Shaka |publisher=[[Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System]] |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Maya (mother of Buddha)|Māyā]] was walking in the [[Lumbini|Lumbinī gardens]] and had stopped to pick flowers, the Buddha is said to have emerged from her right side.&lt;ref name="Forms"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GreatAge"/&gt; According to the ''Dīrghāgama Sūtra'', the young prince immediately took seven steps in the four directions and declared "in the Heavens and on Earth, only I am the Venerable One".&lt;ref group="note"&gt;天上天下唯我独尊 (''tenjō tenga yuiga dokuson''); as a modern idiom these words are sometimes used to satirize self-aggrandizing conceit&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Flammarion"&gt;{{cite book |title=Buddhism: Flammarion Iconographic Guides |author=Frédéric, Louis |publisher=[[Groupe Flammarion|Flammarion]] |year=1995 |isbn=2080135589 |pages=87–9, 303–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kanbutsue"/&gt; The ''Lalitavistara'' relates that the infant was then bathed by two [[nāga]], Nanda and Upananda, serpent deities or [[Dragon Kings]].&lt;ref name="Kanbutsue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eastern"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DeVisser"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Buddhism in Japan I |author=de Visser, M. W |year=1935 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]] |pages=45–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Sutra on the meritorious action of bathing the Buddha's image'' was translated into Chinese in 710.&lt;ref name="DeVisser"/&gt; Reenacting the legend of the Buddha's birth, the annual rite known as ''kanbutsu-e'' ("rite of sprinkling the Buddha", more popularly ''[[Buddha’s Birthday#Japan 2|hana matsuri]]'' or "flower festival") sees the bathing of small Buddha statues amidst garlands of flowers.&lt;ref name="Kanbutsue"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/k/kanbutsue.htm |title=Kanbutsu-e |publisher=[[Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System]] |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Living Buddhist Statues in Early Medieval and Modern Japan |author=Horton, Sarah J |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |year=2007 |isbn=9781403964205 |pages=22–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perfumed water was once used but, since the nineteenth century, this has generally been replaced by sweet [[hydrangea]] tea known as ''amacha''.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;''Amacha'' was also used to sweeten beverages, before the introduction of sugar to Japan in the seventeenth century; mixed with ink it is used to write on paper that is the glued to the wall of houses to ward off insects&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forms"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Flammarion"/&gt; Another variant sees the image repeatedly wiped with a silk cloth rather than [[Anointing|anointed]].&lt;ref name="GreatAge"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Great Age of Japanese Buddhist Sculpture, AD 600-1300 |author1=Nishikawa Kyōtarō |author2=Sano, Emily J |publisher=[[Japan Society (New York)|Japan Society]] |year=1983 |isbn=0912804084 |pages=60–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Celebrations of the Buddha's birth have been staged in Japan on the eighth day of the fourth month since [[Empress Suiko]] ordered that vegetarian feasts should be held in all the temples in 606.&lt;ref name="DeVisser"/&gt; ''Kanbutsu-e'' or "sprinkling" ceremonies are known to have been held at the [[Heian Palace|Seiryōden]], led by a priest from [[Gangō-ji]], in 840 and the ''[[Engi shiki]]'' lists the utensils used at these Palace ceremonies.&lt;ref name="DeVisser"/&gt; Earlier [[List of Japanese temple records|temple records]] and inventories of their treasures list ''kanbutsuzō'' or "images for sprinkling" at [[Hōryū-ji]] and [[Daian-ji]], and early surviving examples include one dating to the [[Asuka period]] at {{nihongo|Shōgen-ji|正眼寺}} in [[Aichi Prefecture]] ([[Important Cultural Properties of Japan|Important Cultural Property]]).&lt;ref name="DeVisser"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kunishitei.bunka.go.jp/bsys/maindetails.asp?register_id=201&amp;item_id=5091 |title=銅造誕生釈迦仏立像 |trans-title=Standing bronze statue of Shaka at Birth |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This example at [[Tōdai-ji]] is generally dated to the 750s.&lt;ref name="Forms"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eastern"/&gt;

At Tōdai-ji today, a {{nihongo|temporary flower hall|花御堂|hanamidō}} is erected each year before the [[Main Hall (Japanese Buddhism)|Daibutsuden]] (Great Buddha Hall).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.todaiji.or.jp/contents/function/04busyoue.html |title=仏生会 |trans-title=Rites for the Buddha's Birth (Bussho-e) |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Tōdai-ji]] |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This National Treasure Shaka at Birth was still used in the ceremony when [[Langdon Warner]] was writing in the late 1950s and indeed as late as the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Eastern"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Great Eastern Temple: Treasures of Japanese Buddhist Art from Todai-ji |author=Mino Yutaka |publisher=[[Art Institute of Chicago]] |year=1986 |isbn=0253326346 |pages=77f}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Warner"&gt;{{cite book |title=Japanese Sculpture of the Tempyo Period: Masterpieces of the Eighth Century |author=[[Langdon Warner|Warner, Langdon]] |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |year=1964 |pages=92f}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nara Buddhist Art: Todai-ji |author=Kobayashi Takeshi |publisher=[[Weatherhill]] |year=1975 |isbn=0834810212 |pages=56, 60}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently it has been replaced with a copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vvd-66zhwM |title=奈良 東大寺所蔵 誕生釈迦仏 |trans-title=Nara - Todaiji Collection - Shaka at Birth |language=Japanese |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statue==
Evoking the legend of his birth, the statue of the infant Buddha has its right arm raised, pointing to heaven, and left arm pendant, pointing to the earth; he is bare chested and wears a skirt.&lt;ref name="Forms"/&gt; The elongated earlobes and spiral-shaped curls of hear, resembling snail-shells, are among the [[Physical characteristics of the Buddha#The 80 secondary characteristics|eighty secondary physical characteristics of the Buddha]].&lt;ref name="GreatAge"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/r/rahotsu.htm |title=Rahotsu |publisher=[[Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System]] |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deep ridges on both body and arms "emphasize the fleshiness" of the smiling child's body.&lt;ref name="GreatAge"/&gt; The soft, rounded, "sweet-faced" features of the young Buddha have been likened to those of the celestial musicians on the roughly contemporary octagonal lantern erected in front of the Tōdai-ji [[Main Hall (Japanese Buddhism)|Daibutsuden]].&lt;ref name="Forms"/&gt; The original pedestal on which the image stands has been lost and replaced with a small wooden base [[Wood carving|carved]] with [[Padma (attribute)|lotus]] petals.&lt;ref name="Eastern"/&gt;

==Basin==
Like the statue, the basin or ''kanbutsuban'' is the largest of its type known.&lt;ref name="Kanbutsue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eastern"/&gt; The exterior has incised images of human figures, animals real and imaginary, birds, and butterflies, set against a landscape of flowers, grasses, shrubs, trees, mountain peaks, clouds, and [[Tō|pagodas]].&lt;ref name="Eastern"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Warner"/&gt; Images of hermits with banners riding on birds, barbarians in foreign garb astride [[Chinese lion]]s, and hunters chasing tigers are similar to motifs found on metalwork in Tōdai-ji's celebrated repository the [[Shōsōin]].&lt;ref name="Forms"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GreatAge"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eastern"/&gt; Much of this decoration is secular rather than Buddhist in inspiration.&lt;ref name="GreatAge"/&gt; Like the statue, the basin shows the influence of contemporary [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] China.&lt;ref name="Forms"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GreatAge"/&gt;

==Technology==
Both statue and basin are of [[Gilding|gilt]] [[bronze]], [[Casting (metalworking)|cast]] using the [[Lost-wax casting|lost-wax method]].&lt;ref name="GreatAge"/&gt; The statue was cast in one piece, other than for the right forearm which is a [[Conservation Techniques for Cultural Properties|restoration]]; the join is clearly visible.&lt;ref name="GreatAge"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eastern"/&gt; Pieces of the clay core were left inside after casting.&lt;ref name="Eastern"/&gt; The decorative motifs on the outside of the basin were [[engraved]] and the background of dots hammered with a [[Burin (engraving)|burin]] in the technique known as {{nihongo|"fish-[[roe]]"|魚々子|nanako}}.&lt;ref name="Eastern"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/n/nanako.htm |title=Nanako |publisher=[[Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System]] |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both statue and bowl are recognized as masterpieces of eighth-century metalwork.&lt;ref name="Kanbutsue"/&gt;

'''Steven Kolb''' is president and chief executive officer of the [[Council of Fashion Designers of America]] (CFDA), a group of over 500 American fashion womenswear, menswear, jewelry, and accessories designers. He holds a Masters in Public Administration from [[New York University]] and an honorary doctorate of the Arts from Kendall College of Art and Design at [[Ferris State University]] in Grand Rapids, Michigan.[http://www.ferris.edu/HTMLS/news/archive/2014/may/kolb.htm]  The [[Business of Fashion]] ranks Kolb as one of 500 people shaping the global fashion industry. [http://www.businessoffashion.com/community/people/steven-kolb]. In 2018, he was named to the Out100 list, a celebration of the most influential LGBTQ people of the year. [[https://www.out.com/out-exclusives/2018/11/14/out100-2018#slide-50]].
 
Kolb manages the CFDA's membership, trade association activities, and longstanding philanthropic initiatives such as Fashion Targets Breast Cancer,&lt;ref&gt;[http://fashiontargetsbreastcancer.com/ Fashion Targets Breast Cancer]&lt;/ref&gt; which raises public awareness and funds for breast cancer research in the U.S. and internationally.  Furthermore, he has overseen raising funds for natural disasters such as Fashion for Sandy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfda.com/the-latest/fashion-for-sandy-relief-raises-1-7-million Fashion for Sandy]&lt;/ref&gt; which raised funds after Hurricane Sandy and for HIV/AIDS through initiatives such as 7th on Sale.

Kolb works directly with CFDA Board Chair [[Diane von Furstenberg]] and the Board of Directors, which is composed of America's foremost designers, such as [[Vera Wang]], [[Ralph Lauren]], [[Michael Kors]], [[Ashley Olsen]], [[Prabal Gurung]], and Deborah Lloyd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfda.com/about/organization CFDA Board of Directors]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Kolb's largest contributions to American fashion has been his leadership role in cultivating the next wave of emerging American fashion talent through programs such as the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfda.com/programs/the-cfdavogue-fashion-fund CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund]&lt;/ref&gt; (CVFF). Kolb serves as a judge for CVFF and was featured on "The Fashion Fund," an original unscripted series documenting CVFF. Other CFDA program's where he sits on the selection committee include the Elaine Gold Launch Pad in partnership with the Accessories Council [https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/cfda-accessories-council-kick-off-elaine-gold-launchpad-round-two-1202685008/] and the CFDA/Lexus Fashion Initiative supporting sustainable fashion practices. He also serves as a judge for the International Woolmark Prize and the H&amp;M Foundation Global Change Award.

Kolb has helped build the annual CFDA Fashion Awards to become the preeminent spotlight on American fashion, even being called the Oscars of Fashion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/coffee-break-7253642 CNN WWD]&lt;/ref&gt;  The CFDA Fashion Awards red carpet and show are streamed on CFDA's Facebook page with over 4 million viewers watching in 2018.

Under his direction, the CFDA worked with the Boston Consulting group to conduct an extensive study to evaluate the purpose of New York Fashion Week. The intent of the study was to question the status quo of fashion week and stimulate a dialogue in the American fashion industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vogue.com/13409856/cfda-future-of-nyfw-study/]&lt;/ref&gt; As the result of the study many designers shifted to See Now Buy Now collections and outside the traditional September and February fashion week schedules.

Kolb has also worked to establish the Strategic Partnerships Group (SPG) at the CFDA. This group works to strategically align corporate partners with the CFDA's members, in an effort to leverage and add value to both the partner and the designer, respectively.  [[Charlotte Ronson]] and [[Stacey Bendet]] of Alice &amp; Olivia created limited-edition items for [[Starbucks]] as a result of one of these symbiotic partner and designer relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/04/living/gallery/cfda-fashion-awards/ CNN Living]&lt;/ref&gt; Other partnerships include the NFL's Super Bowl, Cartoon Network and Pokémon.

Furthermore, Kolb helped pave the way for the CFDA's Health Initiative, which was formed to address the overwhelming concern about whether some models are unhealthily thin, and how to implement best practices in such cases. In 2018, the Health Initiative was expand to the Initiative on Heath, Safety and Diversity addressing harassment and assault and the need for more diverse casting.  Civic responsibility became a core pillar of CFDA's work with Kolb leading campaigns with Planned Parenthood, ACLU and immigration reform with FWD.US. [https://wwd.com/business-news/business-features/cfda-fwd-immigration-report-1202672540/]  In addition, under his direction CFDA produced a study with Glamour Magazine called "The Glass Runway" looking at the gender inequalities in the fashion industry and offering actionable steps for improvement. [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/20/fashion/glass-runway-no-female-ceos.html]

Kolb has helped develop the Fashion Manufacturing Initiative,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfda.com/programs/the-fashion-manufacturing-initiative Fashion Manufacturing Initiative]&lt;/ref&gt; which is an investment fund to help revitalize [[New York City]]'s garment industry. The program offers matching financial grants to New York City's fashion manufacturing production facilities looking to grow and sustain their business by acquiring of innovative equipment, expanding their services, training workers, and creating professional development programming. He served on the Manhattan Borough President's working group to define new initiatives to support mid-town Manhattan production.  Kolb also works tirelessly to keep a designer's original designs intact through efforts such as the Innovative Design Protection and Piracy Prevention Act.

A major accomplishment, Kolb successfully led CFDA's effort to acquire the Fashion Calendar—the official schedule of fashion events and shows in New York, including New York Fashion Week. [http://fashionweekdaily.com/the-cfda-acquires-ruth-finleys-fashion-calendar/] Moreover, Kolb works with international counterparts to manage the global fashion week schedule and he spearheaded the creation of the New York Fashion Week logo and brand.  In  July 2015, under Kolb's leadership, New York Fashion Week: Men's launched creating a stand-alone fashion week for American menswear that aligns with the men's market. [http://www.complex.com/style/2015/07/creation-of-new-york-fashion-week-men]

==Prior work==
Kolb's background was also in the non-profit sector, but focused on raising funds for HIV and [[AIDS]] and [[cancer]].  He began his career at the American Cancer Society in New Jersey. While working as the deputy director at the Design Industries Foundation Fighting AIDS [[Diffa.org|DIFFA]] he managed a network of chapter affiliates and raised millions of dollars through events like Dining  by Design and caused related marketing programs like the Gift of Hope.  He is the founding executive director of MTV's Staying Alive Foundation where is set up the organization as a 501(c)3 and established an international grant making program for HIV/AIDS prevention and education for youth.

==Personal life==
On December 27, 2012 Kolb married longtime partner Jason Inkpen in New York City.  He has a collection of owls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/07/collect-call-steven-kolbs-owls/?_r=0 New York Times Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;  His rescue dog, Donna, a chihuahua terrier mix has her own Instagram account @offcialdonnathedog .

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3660">'''Tadeusz Romuald Jeziorowski''' (born in 1944) is a Polish [[historian]] and writer specialising in [[weaponry]], [[uniforms]] and [[orders]].

'''''The Katzenjammer Kids''''' is an American [[comic strip]] created by [[Rudolph Dirks]] in 1897, and later drawn by [[Harold Knerr]] for 35 years (1914 to 1949).&lt;ref name=lambiek&gt;[http://lambiek.net/artists/d/dirks_r.htm Dirks profile]: "Born in Heide, Germany, Rudolph Dirks moved with his parents to Chicago at the age of seven."&lt;/ref&gt; It debuted December 12, 1897, in the ''American Humorist'', the Sunday supplement of [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s ''[[New York Journal]]''. Dirks was the first cartoonist to regularly express dialogue in comic characters through the use of [[speech balloons]].&lt;ref name="Claire Suddath"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1989458_1989457_1989441,00.html |title=Top 10 Long-Running Comic Strips / The Katzenjammer Kids |author=Claire Suddath |publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine |date=May 17, 2010 |accessdate=May 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comic strip was turned into a stage play in 1903. It inspired several animated cartoons and was one of 20 strips included in the [[Comic Strip Classics stamps|Comic Strip Classics]] series of U.S. commemorative postage stamps.

After a series of legal battles between 1912 and 1914, Dirks left the Hearst organization and began a new strip, first titled '''''Hans and Fritz''''' and then '''''The Captain and the Kids'''''. It featured the same characters seen in ''The Katzenjammer Kids'', which was continued by Knerr. The two separate versions of the strip competed with each other until 1979, when ''The Captain and the Kids'' ended its six-decade run. ''The Katzenjammer Kids'' published its last strip on January 1, 2006, but is still distributed in reprints by [[King Features Syndicate]], making it the oldest comic strip still in [[print syndication|syndication]] and the longest-running ever.&lt;ref name="Claire Suddath"/&gt;

==History==
===Creation and early years===
[[File:Katzenjammer Kids 1922.jpg|thumb|left|A Sunday comic strip from May 14, 1922, by [[Harold Knerr]]]]
''The Katzenjammer Kids'' was inspired by ''[[Max and Moritz]]'', a children's story of the 1860s by German author [[Wilhelm Busch]]. 

''Katzenjammer'' translates literally as ''the wailing of cats'' (i.e. "caterwaul") but is used to mean ''contrition after a failed endeavor'' or ''hangover'' in German (and, in the latter sense, in English too). Whereas Max &amp; Moritz were grotesquely but comically put to death after seven destructive pranks, the Katzenjammer Kids and the other characters still thrive.

===Dirks and Knerr===

''The Katzenjammer Kids'' was so popular that it became two competing comic strips and the subject of a lawsuit. This happened because Dirks, in 1912, wanted to take a break after drawing the strip for 15 years, but the Hearst newspaper syndicate would not allow it. Dirks left anyway, and the strip was taken over by Harold Knerr. Dirks' last strip appeared March 16, 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Knoll og Tott – 100 år i Norge (Egmont Serieforlaget, 2011), p. 55. {{ISBN|978-82-429-4437-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dirks sued, and after a long legal battle, the Hearst papers were allowed to continue ''The Katzenjammer Kids'', with Knerr as writer and artist. He took over permanently in the summer of 1914. However, Dirks was allowed to create an almost identical strip of his own for the rival [[Pulitzer, Inc.|Pulitzer]] newspapers,&lt;ref name=lambiek/&gt; although he had to use a different name for the strip.

Initially named ''Hans und Fritz'' after the two naughty protagonist brothers, Dirks' new feature was called ''The Captain and the Kids'' from 1918 on. ''The Captain and the Kids'' was very similar to ''The Katzenjammer Kids'' in terms of content and characters, but Dirks had a looser and more verbal style than Knerr, who on the other hand often produced stronger, more direct gags and drawings. ''The Captain and the Kids'' soon proved to equal the popularity of ''The Katzenjammer Kids''. It was later distributed by the [[United Feature Syndicate]] (while Hearst's King Features distributed ''The Katzenjammer Kids'').&lt;ref name=lambiek/&gt;

''The Captain and the Kids'' also introduced some new characters. Ginga Dun is a snooty Indian trader who can outsmart almost anyone and only talks in verse. Captain Bloodshot is a pint-sized pirate rival of [[Long John Silver|John Silver]]'s.

===1950s to the present===
''The Captain and the Kids'' expanded as a [[daily strip]] during the 1930s, but it had only a short run. However, the [[Sunday strip]] remained popular for decades. From 1946, Dirks' son, John Dirks, gradually began doing more of the work on ''The Captain and the Kids''. They introduced new characters and plots during the 1950s, including a 1958 science fiction storyline about a brilliant inventor and alien invasions. Even as John Dirks took over most of the work, Rudolph Dirks signed the strip until his death in 1968. John Dirks' drawing shifted slightly towards a more square-formed line, though it maintained the original style until ''The Captain and the Kids'' ended its run in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eckhorst |first1=Tim |title=Rudolph Dirks – Katzenjammer, Kids &amp; Kauderwelsch |year=2012 |publisher=Deich Verlag |location=[[Wewelsfleth]] |language=German |isbn=978-3-942074-05-6 |page=100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knerr continued drawing ''The Katzenjammer Kids'' until his death in 1949; the strip was then written and drawn by [[Doc Winner|Charles H. "Doc" Winner]] (1949–56), with [[Joe Musial]] taking over in 1956. Musial was replaced on ''The Katzenjammer Kids'' by Mike Senich (1976–81), Angelo DeCesare (1981–86), and [[Hy Eisman]] (1986–2006). Now syndicated in reprint form, the strip is distributed internationally to some 50 newspapers and magazines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartoonician.com/getting-hy-on-comics-a-profile-of-hy-eisman/ ''A Profile of Hy Eisman'', Hogan's Alley #15]&lt;/ref&gt; Eisman reused a lot of old gags and stories in later years.

== Characters and story ==
''The Katzenjammer Kids'' (three brothers in the first strip but soon reduced to two) featured Hans and Fritz, twins who rebelled against authority, particularly in the form of their mother, Mama; der Captain, a shipwrecked sailor who acted as a surrogate father; and der Inspector, an official from the school system. Other characters included John Silver, a pirate sea captain and his crew, and King Bongo, a primitive-living but sophisticated-acting [[Black people|black]] jungle monarch who ruled a tropical island. Several of the characters spoke in stereotypical German-accented English. The main plot of the strip was Hans and Fritz would pull a prank or trick on one of the adults which resulted in their being hunted down and given a spanking in the end panel.

Knerr's version of ''The Katzenjammer Kids'' introduced several major new characters in the 1930s. Miss Twiddle, a pompous tutor, and her brainy niece Lena came to stay permanently with the Katzenjammers in early 1936. Later in the year Twiddle's ex-pupil, "boy prodigy" Rollo Rhubarb joined them. The ever-smug Rollo is always trying to outwit Hans and Fritz, but his cunning plans often backfire.

Notable features of the later strips included a more constructive relationship between the Captain and the boys, who sometimes had friendly conversations instead of fights. The King and his people were now Polynesian rather than African.

The ''Katzenjammer Kids'' characters initially appeared outside comics in a handful of live-action silent films, the first released in 1898. This first film, titled ''The Katzenjammer Kids In School'' was made for the [[Biograph Company]] by [[William George Bitzer]]. This film was followed in 1900 by another Bitzer-Biograph film, ''The Katzenjammer Kids in Love.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|auhtorlink1=Maurice Horn|last=Horn|first=Maurice|title=Comics and Cinema: The Beginnings (1896–1913)|journal=International Journal of Comic Art|date=15 October 2007|volume=9|issue=2|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between December 1916 and August 1918, a total of 37 ''Katzenjammer Kids'' silent cartoon shorts were produced by William Randolph Hearst's own cartoon studio [[International Film Service]], which adapted well-known comic strips owned by Hearst for animation. The series was retired in 1918 at the height of the characters' popularity – partly because of the growing tension against titles with German associations after World War I. The comic strip was briefly renamed to ''The Shenanigan Kids'' around this time, and in 1920 another five cartoons were produced under this title. All ''Katzenjammer Kids''/''Shenanigan Kids'' cartoons from International Film Services were directed (and most likely also animated) by [[Gregory La Cava]].

In addition, the Katzenjammer Kids had appearances (along with a lot of other King Features comic strip stars) in Filmation's TV special ''[[Popeye Meets the Man Who Hated Laughter]]'' (1972).

=== ''The Captain and the Kids'' ===
[[Image:Captainandthekids.jpg|thumb|right|The title card for ''The Captain and the Kids''.]]
In 1938, ''The Captain and the Kids'' became the subject of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]'s first self-produced series of theatrical [[short subject]] cartoons, directed by [[William Hanna]], Bob Allen and [[Friz Freleng]]: ''[[The Captain and the Kids (MGM animated series)|The Captain and the Kids]]''. Unlike the strip, which focused most of all on the gruesomely amusing antics of Hans and Fritz, the MGM cartoons often centered on the Captain. The series was overall unsuccessful, ending after one year and a total of 15 cartoons. Following that cancellation, Freleng returned to [[Warner Bros.]], where he had earlier been an animation director. The Captain was voiced by [[Billy Bletcher]], and John Silver was voiced by [[Mel Blanc]].

''The Captain and the Kids'' version of the strip was also animated for television as a back-up segment on [[Filmation]]'s ''[[Archie's TV Funnies]]'' in 1971. 

==Cultural legacy==
* In July 2009 a street in [[Heide]], Germany (where Dirks was born) was named after the cartoonist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eckhorst |first1=Tim |title=Rudolph Dirks – Katzenjammer, Kids &amp; Kauderwelsch |year=2012 |publisher=Deich Verlag |location=[[Wewelsfleth]] |language=German |isbn=978-3-942074-05-6 |page=107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Katzenjammer Kids'' ===
*''The Katzenjammer Kids'' are still very popular in the Scandinavian countries Denmark and Norway (where they are known as ''Knoll og Tott''); in both countries, an annual comic book has been published almost every Christmas since 1911 (the only exceptions reportedly being the years 1913 and 1944). For the most part, Harold Knerr's version of the comic is used in these annual comic books. In [[Sweden]], the annual Katzenjammer Kids comic book was also a tradition for many years, from 1928–1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seriesam.com/cgi-bin/guide?s=knoll+och+tott |title=Knoll och Tott |trans-title=Knoll and Tott |language=German |accessdate=December 10, 2017 |publisher=Seriesam AB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Art Clokey]], the creator of [[Gumby]], has claimed that ''The Katzenjammer Kids'' inspired the creation of Gumby's nemeses, [[Block-heads (Gumby)|The Block-heads]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=gumbyworld.com|title=The Blockheads|url=http://www.gumbyworld.com/memorylane/histblkhd.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Playboy]]'' frequently featured in its late 1970s-early 1980s "Playboy Funnies" pages a spoof of ''The Katzenjammer Kids'' called ''The Krautzenbummer Kids'' with adult style gags.
*French [[dark cabaret]] band [[Katzenjammer Kabarett]] is thus named in a homage to the strip, as is the Norwegian symphonic pop/swing group ''[[Katzenjammer (band)|Katzenjammer]]''.

=== ''The Captain and the Kids'' ===
*''The Captain and the Kids'' has been published as an annual comic book in Norway since 1987. When no more reproducible material was available in 2001, Per Sanderhage, the editor of the Danish comic strip agency PIB, negotiated a deal where ''[[Ferd'nand]]'' cartoonist Henrik Rehr would redraw 32 pages loosely based on old magazine clippings for the annual. In spite of the artistic/ethical questions this raises regarding the testament of Dirks' original work, the arrangement continues on to this day.

In August 1984, Posner Ward represented her father, [[Victor Posner]], who was unable to attend the renaming of a street in his name by [[Hermitage, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=googlenewsMiaminews082384&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4ZImAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bAEGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3897,2092868&amp;dq=tracy+posner&amp;hl=en|title=Posner Gets A Boulevard In Hermitage|date=August 23, 1984|work=[[Google News Archive]]|publisher=[[The Miami News]]|accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Speaking to the assembled guests and reporters, Posner Ward apologized for her father's inability to attend by saying, "My father planned to come up to the last minute; I hope you realize how hard he tried to make it. He is truly honored by this decision."&lt;ref name=googlenewsMiaminews082384/&gt;  She declined to speak about her father's legal case in Florida.&lt;ref name=googlenewsMiaminews082384/&gt;

'''Valerie Jean Solanas''' (April 9, 1936 – April 25, 1988) was an American [[radical feminism|radical feminist]] and [[author]] best known for writing the ''[[SCUM Manifesto]],'' which she self-published in 1967, and attempting to murder [[Andy Warhol]] in 1968.

Solanas had a turbulent childhood. She said her father regularly [[child sexual abuse|sexually abused]] her and she had a volatile relationship with her mother and stepfather after her parents' divorce. She was sent to live with her grandparents but ran away after being physically abused by her alcoholic grandfather. Solanas [[coming out|came out]] as a lesbian in the 1950s. After graduating with a degree in [[psychology]] from the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], Solanas relocated to [[Berkeley, California]], where she began writing her most notable work, the ''SCUM Manifesto'', which urged women to "overthrow the government, eliminate the money system, institute complete automation and eliminate the male sex".&lt;ref name="harvp|Solanas|1967|p=1"&gt;{{harvp|Solanas|1967|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|DeMonte|2010|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solanas moved to [[New York City]] in the mid-1960s. She met [[pop art]]ist Andy Warhol and asked him to produce her play ''Up Your Ass''. She gave him her script, which she later accused him of losing or stealing. After Solanas demanded financial compensation for the lost script, Warhol hired her to perform in his film, ''[[I, a Man]]'', paying her $25. In 1967, Solanas began self-publishing the ''SCUM Manifesto''. Olympia Press owner [[Maurice Girodias]] offered to publish Solanas's future writings, and she understood the contract to mean that Girodias would own her writing. Convinced that Girodias and Warhol were conspiring to steal her work, Solanas purchased a gun in early 1968.

On June 3, 1968, she went to [[The Factory]], where she found Warhol. She shot at Warhol three times, the first two shots missing and the third wounding Warhol. She also shot art critic [[Mario Amaya]] and attempted to shoot Warhol's manager, Fred Hughes, point blank, but the gun jammed. Solanas then turned herself in to the police. She was charged with attempted murder, assault, and illegal possession of a gun. She was diagnosed with [[paranoid schizophrenia]] and pleaded guilty to "reckless assault with intent to harm", serving a three-year prison sentence, including treatment in a [[psychiatric hospital]]. After her release, she continued to promote the ''SCUM Manifesto''. She died in 1988 of [[pneumonia]] in [[San Francisco]].

== Early life ==
Solanas was born in 1936 in [[Ventnor City, New Jersey]], to Louis Solanas and Dorothy Marie Biondo.&lt;ref&gt;State of California. California Death Index, 1940–1997. Sacramento, CA, USA: State of California Department of Health Services, Center for Health Statistics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Violet|1990|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lord&gt;{{harvp|Lord|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harron|1996|p=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was a bartender and her mother a dental assistant.&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fahs_3"&gt;{{harvp|Fahs|2014|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had a younger sister, Judith Arlene Solanas Martinez.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jansen|2011|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was born in [[Montreal]] to parents who immigrated from [[Spanish Canadians|Spain]] and her mother was an [[Italian-American]] of [[Genoa]]n and [[Sicilian Americans|Sicilian]] descent born in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name="Fahs_3"/&gt;

Solanas said that her father regularly [[child sexual abuse|sexually abuse]]d her.&lt;ref name=Watson35&gt;{{harvp|Watson|2003|pp=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents divorced when she was young, and her mother remarried shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Solanas|1996|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solanas disliked her stepfather and began rebelling against her mother, becoming a [[truancy|truant]]. As a child, she wrote insults for children to use on one another, for the cost of a dime. She beat up a boy in high school who was bothering a younger girl, and also hit a nun.&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt; Because of her rebellious behavior, in 1949 her mother sent her to be raised by her grandparents. Solanas said that her grandfather was a violent alcoholic who often beat her. When she was 15, she left her grandparents and became [[homeless]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Buchanan|2011|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, she gave birth to a son, fathered by a married sailor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fahs|2014|pp=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|Solanas's cousin claimed the man was a sailor, and that Solanas may have also given birth to a second child before leaving home.&lt;ref name=Fahs2008&gt;{{harvp|Fahs|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The child, named David (later David Blackwell by adoption), was taken away from Solanas and she never saw him again.&lt;ref name="Coburn"&gt;{{cite web|author=Judith Coburn|year=2000|title=Solanas Lost and Found|publisher=Village Voice|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2000-01-11/news/solanas-lost-and-found/|accessdate= November 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jobey"&gt;Jobey, Liz, ''Solanas and Son'', in ''[[The Guardian]]'', August 24, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hewitt|2004|p=602}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|Lord stated that Solanas and her son lived with "a middle-class military couple outside of Washington, D.C." before she went to the University of Maryland. This couple might have paid for her college tuition, according to Lord.&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt;}}

Despite this, she graduated from high school on time and earned a degree in [[psychology]] from the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], where she was in the [[Psi Chi]] Honor Society.&lt;ref name="HesfordDiedrich2010"&gt;{{harvp|Heller|2008|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Regarding the honor society: {{harvp|Jansen|2011|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at the University of Maryland, she hosted a call-in radio show where she gave advice on how to combat men.&lt;ref name=Watson35/&gt; She was also an open lesbian, despite the conservative cultural climate of the 1950s.&lt;ref name=Heller2001&gt;{{harvp|Heller|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She attended the [[University of Minnesota]]'s Graduate School of Psychology, where she worked in the animal research laboratory,&lt;ref name="Nickels2005C"&gt;{{harvp|Nickels|2005|pp=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; before dropping out and moving to attend [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] for a few courses. It was during this time that she began writing the ''SCUM Manifesto''.&lt;ref name="Jobey"/&gt;

== New York City and the Factory ==
In the mid-1960s Solanas moved to New York City, where she supported herself through [[begging]] and prostitution.&lt;ref name=Heller2001/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton2002"&gt;{{harvp|Hamilton|2002|pp=264–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965 she wrote two works: an autobiographical&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Solanas|1968|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; short story, "A Young Girl's Primer on How to Attain the Leisure Class",&lt;!--Some sources title this work "A Young Girl's Primer or How to Attain the Leisure Class", but the original typed version uses "on", not "or".--&gt; and a play, ''Up Your Ass'',{{Efn|The original title of the work is ''Up Your Ass, or, From the Cradle to the Boat, or, The Big Suck, or, Up from the Slime.''&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fahs2008/&gt;}} about a young prostitute.&lt;ref name=Heller2001/&gt; According to James Martin Harding, the play is "based on a plot about a woman who 'is a man-hating hustler and panhandler' and who&amp;nbsp;... ends up killing a man."&lt;ref name="CuttingPerfs-p168"&gt;{{harvp|Harding|2010|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harding describes it as more a "provocation than&amp;nbsp;... a work of dramatic literature"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harding|2010|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "rather adolescent and contrived."&lt;ref name="CuttingPerfs-p168" /&gt; The short story was published in ''[[Cavalier (magazine)|Cavalier]]'' magazine in July 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Watson|2003|p=447}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Solanas |first=Valerie |title=For 2¢: pain |journal=[[Cavalier (magazine)|Cavalier]] |date=July 1966 |pages=38–40, 76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Up Your Ass'' remained unpublished until 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Solanas |first=Valerie |date= March 31, 2014 |title=Up Your Ass |url= |location= |publisher=VandA.ePublishing |page= |asin=B00JE6N2UG }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, Solanas encountered Andy Warhol outside his studio, [[The Factory]], and asked him to produce her play. He accepted the script for review, told Solanas it was "well typed", and promised to read it.&lt;ref name="Nickels2005C" /&gt; According to Factory lore, Warhol, whose films were often shut down by the police for obscenity, thought the script was so [[pornography|pornographic]] that it must have been a police trap.&lt;ref name=Barron&gt;Barron, James (June 23, 2009). ''[http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/23/a-manuscript-a-confrontation-a-shooting/ A Manuscript, a Confrontation, a Shooting]'', [[New York Times]], retrieved on 2009-07-06.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KaufmanRosset2004A"&gt;{{harvp|Kaufman|Ortenberg|Rosset|2004|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solanas contacted Warhol about the script, and was told that he had lost it. He also jokingly offered her a job at the Factory as a typist. Insulted, Solanas demanded money for the lost manuscript. Instead, Warhol paid her $25 to appear in his film ''[[I, a Man]]''.&lt;ref name="Nickels2005C"/&gt;

In her role in ''I, a Man'', she leaves the film's title character (played by [[Tom Baker (American actor)|Tom Baker]]) to fend for himself, explaining "I gotta go beat my meat" as she exits the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video | people=Warhol, Andy (Director) |year=1967 | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0220569 | title=I, a Man | medium=Motion picture }}&lt;/ref&gt; Solanas was satisfied with her experience working with Warhol and her performance in the film, and brought [[Maurice Girodias]] to see the film. Girodias described her as being "very relaxed and friendly with Warhol." Solanas also had a nonspeaking role in Warhol's film ''Bikeboy'', in 1967.&lt;ref name="KaufmanRosset2004A"/&gt;

=== ''SCUM Manifesto'' ===
{{Main|SCUM Manifesto}}
In 1967, Solanas self-published her best-known work, the ''SCUM Manifesto'', a scathing critique of patriarchal culture. The manifesto's opening words are:

{{Quote|text=&lt;!-- The quotation marks within the quotation are in the original. --&gt;"Life" in this "society" being, at best, an utter bore and no aspect of "society" being at all relevant to women, there remains to civic-minded, responsible, thrill-seeking females only to overthrow the government, eliminate the money system, institute complete automation and eliminate the male sex.|sign=Valerie Solanas|source=''SCUM Manifesto''&lt;ref name="harvp|Solanas|1967|p=1"/&gt;}}

Some authors have argued that the ''Manifesto'' is [[SCUM Manifesto#As parody and satire|a parody of patriarchy and a satirical work]] and, according to Harding, Solanas described herself as "a social propagandist",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harding|2010|p=152}}, citing {{harvp|Frank|1996|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Solanas denied that the work was "a put on"&lt;ref name="Marmorstein_9"&gt;{{harvp|Marmorstein|1968|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and insisted that her intent was "dead serious".&lt;ref name="Marmorstein_9"/&gt; The ''Manifesto'' has been translated into over a dozen languages and is excerpted in several feminist anthologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hewitt|2004|p=603}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morgan|1970|pp=514–519}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also {{harvp|Rich|1993|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Heller|2008|p=165}}, citing as excerpting ''SCUM Manifesto'' Kolmar, Wendy, &amp; Frances Bartkowski, eds., ''Feminist Theory: A Reader'' (Mountain View, Calif.: Mayfield, 2000), &amp; Albert, Judith Clavir, &amp; Stewart Edward Albert, eds., ''The Sixties Papers: Documents of a Rebellious Decade'' (1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

While living at the [[Hotel Chelsea|Chelsea Hotel]], Solanas introduced herself to [[Maurice Girodias]], the founder of [[Olympia Press]] and a fellow resident of the hotel. In August 1967, Girodias and Solanas signed&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harron|1996|p=xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; an informal contract stating that she would give Girodias her "next writing, and other writings".&lt;ref name="Baer-Outlaw-p202"&gt;{{harvp|Kaufman|Ortenberg|Rosset|2004|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; In exchange, Girodias paid her $500.&lt;ref name="Baer-Outlaw-p202" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Watson334&gt;{{harvp|Watson|2003|p=334}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BaerAbt-p51"&gt;{{harvp|Baer|1996|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; She took this to mean that Girodias would own her work.&lt;ref name="BaerAbt-p51" /&gt; She told [[Paul Morrissey]] that "everything I write will be his. He's done this to me&amp;nbsp;...&lt;!-- 3-dot space-surrounded ellipsis, not 4-dot, because replacing comma, not period, despite next letter being capitalized, per sourcing (two sources agree) --&gt; He's screwed me!"&lt;ref name="BaerAbt-p51"/&gt; Solanas intended to write a novel based on the ''SCUM Manifesto'', and believed that a conspiracy was behind Warhol's failure to return the ''Up Your Ass'' script. She suspected that he was coordinating with Girodias to steal her work.

=== Shooting ===
[[File:Andy Warhol by Jack Mitchell.jpg|thumb|Andy Warhol, one of her two victims]]
On May 31, 1968, Solanas went to writer [[Paul Krassner]] to ask him for $50, which he loaned to her.&lt;ref name="BrainDamageCtrl-HiTimes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krassner|first1=Paul|title=Brain Damage Control: Phil Spector, Valerie Solanas and Me|url=http://hightimes.com/lounge/pkrassner/5855|website=High Times|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514175113/http://hightimes.com/lounge/pkrassner/5855|archivedate=May 14, 2012|date=September 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krassner later speculated that Solanas could have used the money to buy the gun she used to shoot Warhol, as the shooting was only three days later.&lt;ref name="BrainDamageCtrl-HiTimes" /&gt;

According to an unquoted source in ''The Outlaw Bible of American Literature'', on June 3, 1968, at 9:00&amp;nbsp;am, Solanas arrived at the [[Hotel Chelsea|Chelsea Hotel]], where Girodias lived. She asked for him at the desk but was told he was gone for the weekend. She remained for three hours before heading to the [[Grove Press]], where she asked for [[Barney Rosset]], who was also not available.&lt;ref name="KaufmanRosset2004C"&gt;{{harvp|Kaufman|Ortenberg|Rosset|2004|pp=202–203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 2014 biography ''Valerie Solanas'', Breanne Fahs argues that it is unlikely that Solanas appeared at the Chelsea Hotel looking for Girodias.&lt;ref name="Fahs_133"&gt;{{harvp|Fahs|2014|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fahs states that Girodias may have fabricated the account in order to boost sales of the ''SCUM Manifesto'', which he had published. Fahs states that "the more likely story ... places Valerie at the Actor's Studio at 432 West Forty-Fourth Street early that morning." Actress [[Sylvia Miles]] states that Solanas appeared at the Actor's Studio looking for [[Lee Strasberg]], asking to leave her play for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fahs|2014|pp=133–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miles said that Solanas "had a different look, a bit tousled, like somebody whose appearance is the last thing on her mind."&lt;ref name="Fahs_133"/&gt; Miles told Solanas that Strasberg would not be in until the afternoon. Miles said that she accepted a copy of the play from Solanas and then "shut the door because I knew she was trouble. I didn't know what sort of trouble, but I knew she was trouble."&lt;ref name="Fahs_133"/&gt;

Fahs records that Solanas then traveled to producer Margo Feiden's (then Margo Eden) residence in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, as Solanas believed that Feiden would be willing to produce her play. As related to Fahs, Solanas talked to Feiden for almost four hours, trying to convince her to produce the play and discussing her vision for a world without men. Throughout this time, Feiden repeatedly refused to produce Solanas's play. According to Feiden, Solanas then pulled out her gun, and when Feiden again refused to commit to producing the play, Solanas responded, "Yes, you will produce the play because I'll shoot Andy Warhol and that will make me famous and the play famous, and then you'll produce it." As she was leaving Feiden's residence, Solanas handed Feiden a copy of her play (a partial copy of an earlier draft of ''Up Your Ass''&lt;ref name="Fahs_F198"&gt;{{harvp|Fahs|2014}},
 [https://books.google.ie/books?id=h9ZWAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT323&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false footnote 198]&lt;/ref&gt;) and other personal papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fahs|2014|pp=134–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fahs describes how Feiden then "frantically called her local police precinct, Andy Warhol's precinct, police headquarters in Lower Manhattan, and the offices of Mayor [[John Lindsay]] and Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]] to report what happened and inform them that Solanas was on her way at that very moment to shoot Andy Warhol."&lt;ref name="Fahs_137"&gt;{{harvp|Fahs|2014|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances, the police responded that "You can't arrest someone because you believe she is going to kill Andy Warhol," and even asked Feiden "Listen lady, how would you know what a real gun looked like?"&lt;ref name="Fahs_137"/&gt; In a 2009 interview with James Barron of ''The New York Times'', Feiden said that she knew Solanas intended to kill Warhol, but could not prevent it.&lt;ref name="Barron"/&gt;{{Efn|"The Times does not present Ms. Fieden's account as definitive....

Later that day, Solanas arrived at the Factory and waited outside. Morrissey arrived and asked her what she was doing there, and she replied "I'm waiting for Andy to get money".&lt;ref name="KaufmanRosset2004C-p203"&gt;{{harvp|Kaufman|Ortenberg|Rosset|2004|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morrissey tried to get rid of her by telling her that Warhol was not coming in that day, but she told him she would wait. At 2:00&amp;nbsp;pm she went up into the studio. Morrissey told her again that Warhol was not coming in and that she had to leave. She left but rode the elevator up and down until Warhol finally boarded it.&lt;ref name="KaufmanRosset2004C" /&gt;

She entered [[The Factory]] with Warhol, who complimented her on her appearance as she was uncharacteristically wearing makeup. Morrissey told her to leave, threatening to "beat the hell"&lt;ref name="KaufmanRosset2004C-p203" /&gt; out of her and throw her out otherwise. The phone rang and Warhol answered while Morrissey went to the bathroom. While Warhol was on the phone, Solanas fired at him three times. Her first two shots missed, but the third went through both lungs, his spleen, stomach, liver, and esophagus.&lt;ref name="KaufmanRosset2004C"/&gt; She then shot art critic [[Mario Amaya]] in the hip. She tried to shoot Fred Hughes, Warhol's manager, in the head, but her gun jammed.&lt;ref name="Harding2010C"&gt;{{harvp|Harding|2010|pp=151–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes asked her to leave, which she did, leaving behind a paper bag with her address book on a table.&lt;ref name="Harding2010C"/&gt; Warhol was taken to [[Cabrini Medical Center|Columbus–Mother Cabrini Hospital]], where he underwent a successful five-hour operation.&lt;ref name="KaufmanRosset2004C"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dillenberger|2001|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that day, Solanas turned herself in, gave up her gun, and confessed to the shooting,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Baer|1996|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; telling a police officer that Warhol "had too much control in my life."&lt;ref name="Harding2010B"&gt;{{harvp|Harding|2010|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was fingerprinted and charged with [[felonious assault]] and possession of a deadly weapon.&lt;ref name="KaufmanRosset2004C-p204"&gt;{{harvp|Kaufman|Ortenberg|Rosset|2004|p=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next morning, the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' ran the front-page headline "Actress Shoots Andy Warhol." Solanas demanded a retraction of the statement that she was an actress. The ''Daily News'' changed the headline in its later edition and added a quote from Solanas stating "I'm a writer, not an actress."&lt;ref name="Harding2010B"/&gt; At her arraignment in [[Manhattan Criminal Court]] she denied shooting Warhol because he wouldn't produce her play but said "it was for the opposite reason",&lt;ref name="ActressDefiant-col1"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Faso |first1=Frank |first2=Henry |last2=Lee |date=June 5, 1968 |title=Actress defiant: 'I'm not sorry' |publisher=[[New York Daily News]] |volume=49 |issue=297 |page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; that "he has a legal claim on my works."&lt;ref name="ActressDefiant-col1" /&gt; Solanas told the judge that "it's not often that I shoot somebody.

After a cursory evaluation, Solanas was declared mentally unstable and transferred to the prison ward of Elmhurst Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fahs|2014|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solanas appeared at [[New York Supreme Court]] on June 13, 1968. [[Florynce Kennedy]] represented her and asked for a writ of [[habeas corpus]], arguing that Solanas was being held inappropriately at Elmhurst. The judge denied the motion and Solanas returned to Elmhurst. On June 28, Solanas was indicted on charges of attempted murder, assault, and illegal possession of a gun. She was declared "incompetent" in August and sent to [[Matteawan State Hospital for the Criminally Insane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fahs|2014|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same month, Olympia Press published the ''SCUM Manifesto'' with essays by Girodias and Krassner.&lt;ref name="KaufmanRosset2004C-p204"/&gt;

In January 1969, Solanas underwent psychiatric evaluation and was diagnosed with chronic [[paranoid schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name=Watson35/&gt; In June, she was finally deemed fit to stand trial. She represented herself without an attorney and pleaded guilty to "reckless assault with intent to harm".&lt;ref name=Jansen153&gt;{{harvp|Jansen|2011|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AKPress55&gt;{{harvp|Solanas|1996|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was sentenced to three years in prison, with one year of time served.&lt;ref name=Jansen153/&gt;&lt;ref name=AKPress55/&gt;

== After murder attempt ==
The shooting of Warhol propelled Solanas into the public spotlight, prompting a flurry of commentary and opinions in the media. Robert Marmorstein, writing in ''[[The Village Voice]]'', declared that Solanas "has dedicated the remainder of her life to the avowed purpose of eliminating every single male from the face of the earth."&lt;ref name="Marmorstein_9"/&gt; [[Norman Mailer]] called her the "[[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] of feminism."&lt;ref name="Nickels2005D"/&gt;

[[Ti-Grace Atkinson]], the New York chapter president of the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW), described Solanas as "the first outstanding champion of women's rights"&lt;ref name="Nickels2005D"&gt;{{harvp|Nickels|2005|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "a 'heroine' of the feminist movement",&lt;ref name="Friedan_109"&gt;{{harvp|Friedan|1976|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedan_138"&gt;{{harvp|Friedan|1998|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "smuggled [her manifesto]&amp;nbsp;... out of the mental hospital where Solanas was confined."&lt;ref name="Friedan_109"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedan_138"/&gt; According to [[Betty Friedan]], the NOW board rejected Atkinson.&lt;ref name="Friedan_138"/&gt; Atkinson left NOW and started another feminist organization,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Willis|1992|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Friedan, "the media continued to treat Ti-Grace as a leader of the women's movement, despite its repudiation of her."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Friedan|1998|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another NOW member, [[Florynce Kennedy]], called Solanas "one of the most important spokeswomen of the feminist movement."&lt;ref name="Nickels2005C"/&gt;&lt;ref name="solanas1996"&gt;{{harvp|Solanas|1996|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English professor Dana Heller argued that Solanas was "very much aware of feminist organizations and activism",&lt;ref name="Heller_160"&gt;{{harvp|Heller|2008|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; but "had no interest in participating in what she often described as 'a civil disobedience luncheon club.'"&lt;ref name="Heller_160"/&gt;{{Efn|[[Civil disobedience]] is the active and professed refusal to obey certain laws.}} Heller also stated that Solanas could "reject mainstream liberal feminism for its blind adherence to cultural codes of feminine politeness and decorum which the ''SCUM Manifesto'' identifies as the source of women's debased social status."&lt;ref name="Heller_160"/&gt;{{Efn|[[Liberal feminism]], feminism based on women showing and maintaining their equality by their own choices and acts.}}

=== Solanas and Warhol ===
After Solanas was released from the New York State Prison for Women in 1971,&lt;ref name=Buchanan48&gt;{{harvp|Buchanan|2011|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; she [[stalking|stalked]] Warhol and others over the telephone and was arrested again in November 1971.&lt;ref name="AKPress55"/&gt; She was subsequently institutionalized several times and then drifted into obscurity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Solanas|1996|pp=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attack had a profound impact on Warhol and his art, and security at the Factory scene became much stronger afterward. For the rest of his life, Warhol lived in fear that Solanas would attack him again. "It was the Cardboard Andy, not the Andy I could love and play with," said close friend and collaborator [[Billy Name]]. "He was so sensitized you couldn't put your hand on him without him jumping. I couldn't even love him anymore, because it hurt him to touch him."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.factorymade.org/fm/reviews.html Making the Scene: Factory Made: Warhol and the Sixties by Steven Watson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403213531/http://www.factorymade.org/fm/reviews.html |date=April 3, 2007 }}, Dennis Drabelle, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' book review, November 16, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life ==
[[File:Bristol Hotel San Francisco 01.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Solanas died in 1988 of pneumonia at the Bristol Hotel in San Francisco.]]
Solanas may have intended to write an eponymous autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Winkiel|1999|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1977 ''[[The Village Voice|Village Voice]]'' interview,&lt;ref name="Heller_151"&gt;{{harvp|Heller|2008|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; she announced a book with her name as the title.&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard Smith (director)|Smith, Howard]], &amp; Brian Van der Horst, ''Valerie Solanas Interview'', in ''Scenes'' (col.), in ''The Village Voice'' (New York, N.Y.), vol. XXII, no. 30, July 25, 1977, p. 32, col. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The book, possibly intended as a parody, was supposed to deal with the "conspiracy" that led to her imprisonment.&lt;ref name="Heller_151"/&gt; In a corrective 1977 ''Village Voice'' interview, Solanas said the book would not be autobiographical other than a small portion and that it would be about many things, include proof of statements in the manifesto, and would "deal ''very'' intensively with the subject of bullshit", but she said nothing about parody.&lt;ref name="replies"/&gt;

In the mid-1970s, in New York City, according to Heller, Solanas was "apparently homeless",&lt;ref name="Heller_164"&gt;{{harvp|Heller|2008|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; "continued to defend her political beliefs and the ''SCUM Manifesto''",&lt;ref name="Heller_164"/&gt; and "actively promoted" her new ''Manifesto'' revision.&lt;ref name="Heller_164"/&gt;

[[Ultra Violet (Isabelle Collin Dufresne)|Ultra Violet]], according to her somewhat unreliable report,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Violet|1990|p=v}} (esp. "I have taken artistic license in conveying both reality and essence" &amp; "some conversations&amp;nbsp;... are not intended&amp;nbsp;... as verbatim quotes.").&lt;/ref&gt; interviewed her. Solanas was then known as Onz Loh. Solanas stated that the August 1968 version of the manifesto had many errors, unlike her own printed version of October 1967, and that the book had not sold well. She also said that, until told by Violet, she was unaware of Warhol's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Violet|1990|pp=183–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|Violet objected to assassination;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Violet|1990|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a possible contrast in her views, see {{harvp|Violet|1990|p=241}} for another near-killing of Andy Warhol.}}

== Death ==
[[File:Grave of Valerie Jean Solanas - Stierch.JPG|thumb|The grave of Valerie Jean Solanas at Saint Marys Catholic Church Cemetery, Fairfax County, Virginia]]
On April 25, 1988, at the age of 52, Solanas died of [[pneumonia]] at the [[Hotel Bristol|Bristol Hotel]] in the [[Tenderloin, San Francisco|Tenderloin district]] of San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Watson|2003|p=425}}&lt;/ref&gt; A building superintendent at the hotel, not on duty that night, had a vague memory of Solanas: "Once, he had to enter her room, and he saw her typing at her desk. There was a pile of typewritten pages beside her. What she was writing and what happened to the manuscript remain a mystery."&lt;ref name="Coburn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harron|1996|p=xxxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother burned all her belongings posthumously.&lt;ref name="Coburn"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
=== Popular culture ===
Solanas's life has been the focus of numerous performances, films, musical compositions, and publications.

In 1996, actress [[Lili Taylor]] played Solanas in the film ''[[I Shot Andy Warhol]]'', which focused on Solanas's assassination attempt on Warhol (played by [[Jared Harris]]). Taylor won Special Recognition for Outstanding Performance at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] for her role.&lt;ref name="Taylor1"&gt;{{cite web|author=B. Ruby Rich|year=1996|title=I Shot Andy Warhol|work=Archives|publisher=[[Sundance Institute]]|url=http://history.sundance.org/films/1347 |accessdate=November 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's director, [[Mary Harron]], requested permission to use songs by [[The Velvet Underground]], but was denied by [[Lou Reed]], who feared that Solanas would be glorified in the film. Six years before the film's release, Reed and [[John Cale]] included a song about Solanas, "I Believe", on their [[concept album]] about Warhol, ''[[Songs for Drella]]'' (1990). In "I Believe", Reed sings, "I believe life's serious enough for retribution... I believe being sick is no excuse. And I believe I would've pulled the switch on her myself." Reed believed Solanas was to blame for Warhol's death from a [[gallbladder]] infection 20 years after she shot him.&lt;ref name="Reed1"&gt;{{cite web | author=Michael Schaub | date=November 2003 | title=The 'Idiot Madness' of Valerie Solanis | publisher=[[Bookslut]] | url=http://www.bookslut.com/propaganda/2003_11_000965.php | accessdate= November 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solanas's life has inspired three plays.

Rachel Zampelli played Solanas and sang "Big Gun", described as the "evening's strongest number" by ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref name="Marks"&gt;{{Cite news | first=Peter|last=Marks | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/theater-review-pop-paints-bold-portrait-of-warhol-and-his-inner-circle/2011/07/19/gIQAjEgaOI_story.html|title=Theater review: 'Pop!' paints bold portrait of Warhol and his inner circle | work=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=Nash Holdings LLC|location=Washington DC |date=July 19, 2011|accessdate= November 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Up Your Ass'' was rediscovered in 1999 and produced in 2000 by [[George Coates|George Coates Performance Works]] in San Francisco. The copy Warhol had lost was found in a trunk of lighting equipment owned by Billy Name. Coates learned about the rediscovered manuscript while at an exhibition at [[The Andy Warhol Museum]] marking the 30th anniversary of the shooting. Coates turned the piece into a musical with an all-female cast. Coates consulted with Solanas's sister, Judith, while writing the piece, and sought to create a "very funny satirist" out of Solanas, not just showing her as Warhol's attempted assassin.&lt;ref name="Coburn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Carr"/&gt;

Swedish author [[Sara Stridsberg]] wrote a [[semi-fiction]]al novel about Solanas called ''Drömfakulteten'' (English: ''The Dream Faculty''). The book's narrator visits Solanas toward the end of her life at the Bristol Hotel. Stridsberg was awarded the [[Nordic Council's Literature Prize]] for the book.&lt;ref name="Stridsberg"&gt;{{cite web|year=2007|title=Sara Stridsberg wins the Literature Prize|work=News|publisher=Norden|url=http://www.norden.org/en/news-and-events/news/sara-stridsberg-wins-the-literature-prize |accessdate=November 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Composer [[Pauline Oliveros]] released "To Valerie Solanas and [[Marilyn Monroe]] in Recognition of Their Desperation" in 1970. In the work Oliveros seeks to explore how "Both women seemed to be desperate and caught in the traps of inequality: Monroe needed to be recognized for her talent as an actress.

Solanas was featured in a 2017 episode of the [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] series ''[[American Horror Story: Cult]]'', "[[Valerie Solanas Died for Your Sins: Scumbag]]". She was played by [[Lena Dunham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Laura|last=Bradley|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/08/american-horror-story-cult-spoilers|title=How ''American Horror Story: Cult'' Will Change the ''A.H.S.'' Game|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|location=New York City|date=August 29, 2017|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode portrayed Solanas as the instigator of most of the [[Zodiac Killer]] murders.

=== Influence and analysis ===
Solanas's role as a [[cult figure]] was solidified with the publication of the ''SCUM Manifesto'' and her shooting of Warhol. Harding explained that, by declaring herself independent from Warhol, after her arrest she "aligned herself with the historical avant-garde's rejection of the traditional structures of bourgeois theater",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harding|2010|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that her anti-patriarchal "militant hostility&amp;nbsp;... pushed the avant-garde in radically new directions."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harding|2010|p=153}} and see pp.&amp;nbsp;29, 30, 31, &amp; 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Harding believed that Solanas' assassination attempt on Warhol was its own theatrical performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harding|2010|loc=chap.&amp;nbsp;6 esp. pp.&amp;nbsp;151–158 and see pp. 21, 24, 26, 29, 63 &amp; 178}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the shooting, she left on a table at the Factory a paper bag containing a gun, her address book, and a [[sanitary napkin]].&lt;ref name="CuttingPerfs-p151"&gt;{{harvp|Harding|2010|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harding stated that leaving behind the sanitary napkin was part of the performance,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harding|2010|pp=151–153}}&lt;/ref&gt; and called "attention to basic feminine experiences that were publically {{Sic}} taboo and tacitly elided within avant-garde circles."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harding|2010|p=153}} and see p.&amp;nbsp;152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist philosopher [[Avital Ronell]] compared Solanas to an array of people: [[John and Lorena Bobbitt|Lorena Bobbitt]]; a "girl Nietzsche";{{Efn|[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] was a philosopher and a critic.}} [[Medusa]]; the [[Unabomber]]; and [[Medea]].&lt;ref name=Verso2004&gt;{{harvp|Ronell|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronell believed that Solanas was threatened by the hyper-feminine women of the Factory that Warhol liked and felt lonely because of the rejection she felt due to her own [[butch and femme|butch]] [[androgyny]]. She believed Solanas was ahead of her time, living in a period before feminist and lesbian revolutionaries such as the [[Guerrilla Girls]] and the [[Lesbian Avengers]].&lt;ref name="Nickels2005D"/&gt;

Solanas has also been credited with instigating [[radical feminism]].&lt;ref name=Third/&gt; Catherine Lord wrote that "the feminist movement would not have happened without Valerie Solanas."&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt; Lord believed that the reissuing of the ''SCUM Manifesto'' and the disowning of Solanas by "women's liberation politicos" triggered a wave of radical feminist publications. According to [[Vivian Gornick]], many of the [[women's liberation]] activists who initially distanced themselves from Solanas changed their minds a year later, developing the first wave of radical feminism.&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt; At the same time, perceptions of Warhol were transformed from largely nonpolitical into political martyrdom because the motive for the shooting was political, according to Harding and [[Victor Bockris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harding|2010|p=172}}, citing Bockris, Victor, ''The Life and Death of Andy Warhol'', ''op. cit.'', p.&amp;nbsp;236.&lt;/ref&gt;

Breanne Fahs describes Solanas as a contradiction that "alienates her from the feminist movement." Fahs argues that Solanas never wanted to be "in movement" but nevertheless fractured the feminist movement by provoking NOW members to disagree about her case. Many contradictions are seen in her lifestyle as a lesbian who sexually serviced men, her claim to be asexual, a rejection of [[queer culture]], and a non-interest in working with others despite a dependency on others. Fahs also brings into question the contradictory stories of Solanas's life. She is described as a victim, a rebel, and a desperate loner, yet Solanas' cousin says she worked as a [[waitress]] in her late 20s and 30s, not primarily as a prostitute, and friend Geoffrey LaGear said she had a "groovy childhood." Solanas also kept in touch with her father throughout her life, despite claiming that he sexually abused her. Fahs believes that Solanas embraced these contradictions as a key part of her identity.&lt;ref name=Fahs2008/&gt;

==Collecting==
Beckton began to collect stamps as a boy in 1879.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;"Walter Dorning Beckton" in ''[[The London Philatelist]]'', Vol. XL, No. 471, March 1931, pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Greece and Italy were two of his particular interests and in competitive philately he won medals for his Greece, Straits Settlements, Japan, British West Indies, and Romania.&lt;ref name=abps/&gt; He won the [[Lindenberg Medal]] in 1931.&lt;ref name=royal/&gt;

==Organised philately==
Beckton was one of the Manchester school of philately which advocated the scientific study of all aspects of stamp production including [[Postage stamp paper|paper]], [[watermark]], printing and [[Postage stamp separation|perforation]]. He was president of the [[Manchester Philatelic Society]] for thirty-five years consecutively.

He was also vice-president of the [[International Philatelic Union]]. He wrote extensively on philately and was a regular contributor to the ''Philatelic Journal of Great Britain'' and other philatelic periodicals.

'''Z'ev ben Shimon Halevi''' (English name, '''Warren Kenton''') is an author of books on the Toledano Tradition of [[Kabbalah]], a teacher of the discipline, with a worldwide following, and a founder member of the [[Kabbalah Society]].

== Early life ==

Z'ev ben Shimon Halevi was born, on 8 January 1933, into a [[Jew]]ish family in London, England, where he continues to live and work, along with his wife, Rebekah. On his father's side of the family, he descends from a rabbinical [[Sephardi]] line with roots in [[Bessarabia]] which was, at the turn of the 20th century, a province of Russia. On his mother's side, he is descended from a Polish [[Ashkenazi]] family. [http://www.kabbalahsociety.org/halevi.html] His Ashkenazi great-grandfather was Zerah Barnet, who helped found the Orthodox Meah Shearim district, just outside the Old City of Jerusalem, and a Hebrew yeshiva in Jaffa.

He attended [[Saint Martin's School of Art]] and the [[Royal Academy]], studying painting during his time there. After college his jobs included working in general and psychiatric hospitals, as well as in a theatre workshop and at the [[Royal Opera House]].
Besides theatre work and practising graphic design [http://www.ltmcollection.org/posters/poster/poster.html?_IXSR_=AdA6PBybPAT&amp;_IXMAXHITS_=1&amp;IXinv=2006/10585&amp;IXsummary=artist/artist&amp;IXartist=Warren%20Kenton&amp;_IXFIRST_=1][http://www.ltmcollection.org/posters/poster/poster.html?_IXSR_=AdA6PBybPAT&amp;_IXMAXHITS_=1&amp;IXinv=1983/4/7382&amp;IXsummary=artist/artist&amp;IXartist=Warren%20Kenton&amp;_IXFIRST_=2], he also taught at [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art|RADA]] and the Architectural Association. He ran workshops for the [[Wrekin Trust]] and has lectured at the [[Theosophical Society]], the [[Royal College of Art]] and the [[The Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment|Prince of Wales Institute of Architecture]].

== Kabbalistic work ==

He first started studying Kabbalah at the age of 25. Since then, he has been a student and tutor of the Kabbalah for more than 60 years, beginning to teach it in 1971. During this time he has visited nearly all the old major centres of Kabbalah in Europe, North Africa and Israel, while specialising in the Toledano Tradition, a form that derives from the [[Sephardi]] Kabbalah which developed in early medieval Spain and France and which included among its focal points the towns of [[Lunel]] and [[Girona]] and the city of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. 
[[Image:einsof1.2.gif|left]]
These and other centres flowered, producing among their practitioners of [[mysticism]] and Kabbalah [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]], [[Isaac the Blind]] and [[Nachmanides]]. During this period Kabbalists incorporated into their expositions and exegeses a degree of [[Neoplatonic]] emanationism, called [[Ein Sof]] by kabbalists, that conformed to the requirements of [[Jewish theology]] and philosophy, though, to some extent, in medieval times, it conflicted with the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] approach to [[Jewish philosophy]] by [[Maimonides]] and his followers.&lt;ref&gt;Neoplatonism and Jewish Thought, edited by Lenn Goodman, Albany: SUNY Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

A fellow of the [[Temenos Academy]], UK, instituted by the poet, [[Kathleen Raine]], Halevi regularly lectures there. [http://www.temenosacademy.org/temenos_key_individuals.html] He has taught groups on every continent, including at Interface Boston, the New York Open Centre; The Centre for Psychological Astrology, UK; [[Omega Institute]]; New York Kabbalah Society; the Jungian Institute of Santa Fe, New Mexico; and Karen Kabbalah, Atlanta, as well as in synagogues and at rabbinical colleges. He is the Director of Tutors for the [[Kabbalah Society]] and for many years ran a series of Kabbalah courses at [[Regent's College]] in London.

He travels widely and runs a continuing series of ''Way of Kabbalah'' courses and lectures held in many countries, including America, Australia, Brazil, Canada, England, Germany, Holland, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Scotland and Spain, though few of his lectures have been published and fewer still are online; similarly with his articles.&lt;ref&gt;Kenton, W., Kenton, ''Kabbalah,'' Circles: Magazine of the Theosophical Society, Spring, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; [http://mysite.wanadoo-members.co.uk/theosophy/circles/kenton1.htm]. Over the years, he has also taken part in a series of interviews for various media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/schedule/2005/09/25/day/ BBC Radio 4 FM – Schedules, Sunday 17 March 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Applebaum, D., "Celestial Influence and Human Destiny: An Interview with Z'ev ben Shimon Halevi, Parabola, ''Myth, Tradition, and The Search for Meaning:'' Volume 25, No. 4. November 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Halevi is as well known a writer as he is a teacher, having published 18 books, including a kabbalistic novel and books on [[astrology]] and kabbalistic astrology. Contemporary astrologers such as Judy Hall refer to the work he has done on the latter. [http://www.astrozero.co.uk/articles/chain.htm], p.&amp;nbsp;22. In the earlier part of his career he wrote a number of books on [[stagecraft]]. Both he and his work on the Toledano Tradition are publicly recognised.&lt;ref&gt;Prince Charles' speech, Sacred Web Conference, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, 23/24 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Raine, Light Magazine, Spring 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and his work has now been translated into over thirteen languages, including [[Hebrew]].

Many of his publications are issued under his Hebrew name, Z'ev ben Shimon Halevi, a contraction of his full family name of '''Z'ev ben Shimon ben Joshua Haham-Halevi'''. Both of his families were [[Levite]]s, according to family records. When his grandfather migrated to England in 1900 the name Haham was recorded as Kaufman; it was later changed to Kenton.[http://www.kabbalahsociety.org/halevi.html]

== Influence ==

;Charles, Prince of Wales
[[Image:smaltre.gif|right]]
In an introduction to the Sacred Web Conference, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, 23/24 September 2006 at the [[University of Alberta]] in 2006, the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]], a Patron of the Temenos Academy, said, when talking of the tension between Tradition and [[Modernism]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This dilemma is captured in ancient notions of balance and harmony; notions that are, for example, expressed in many guises in that wonderful Kabbalistic diagram of the [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]]. As the Temenos Fellow, Warren Kenton, so beautifully explains in his lectures to the students of the Academy, the teaching of the Tree of Life is that the "active" and the "passive" aspects of life, which on their own may lead to imbalance and disharmony, must be, can only be, brought together in harmony by the influx into our lives of the Divine and the Sacred. Whether or not we interpret this image as an explanation of an outer or an inner orientation, it is in this way, and only in this way, that the forces, or characteristics, of expansion and constraint can be brought into balance.[http://www.sacredweb.com/conference06/conference_introduction.html]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is a DVD that includes this portion of the Prince's talk on the World Wisdom website. [http://www.worldwisdom.com/public/authors/details.aspx?ID=251]

;Kathleen Raine

The poet, [[Kathleen Raine]], had this to say about Halevi's work:
[[Image:jaclad.gif|left]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;A feature of this author's system not found in others (although doubtless it is traditional though not universally taught) is the beautiful way in which the interfaces of each 'world' overlap with the one above (or below). Thus, the highest experiences of the physical world overlap the lower part of the next world (the psychological]: and again psyche's highest experiences of the individual soul coincide with spiritual regions of the transpersonal world of universal forms. So from illumination to illumination we reascend the 'ladder' by which each of us 'came down to earth from heaven'. The awe-inspiring sublimity of the Kabbalistic universe at once convinces and comforts. It is our destiny to descend and to fulfil some task, learn some lesson in the natural world; as it is to follow the path of return, to reascend from world to world, no matter how many lifetimes this may take us before we return to our true home, 'the kingdom of Heaven'. ''Kathleen Raine, Light Magazine, Spring 1989.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;Sinéad O'Connor

Singer [[Sinéad O'Connor]] wrote in the inner sleeve notes to the album, ''[[I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got]]'', "Special thanks to Selina Marshall + [[Warren Kenton]] for showing me that all I'd need was inside me."

;Charles Thomson

Artist [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]] said, "I studied Kabbalah under a teacher called Warren Kenton, who said there was a lot of humour at the spiritual level, and I think that's true."[http://www.heyokamagazine.com/HEYOKA.3.PAINT.%20CHARLES%20THOMSON.htm]

== Criticism ==

A professor of Kabbalah at [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] has bemoaned the hijacking of kabba'lah by various [[New Age]] authors and has given Halevi as an example. [[Joseph Dan]], in his work ''The Heart and the Fountain: An Anthology of Jewish Mystical Experiences'', writes in footnote 57 to the introduction:

:Another distressing phenomenon is connected with the numerous books concerning kabbalah, its history, nature, and traditions, as instruction for modern living, published by "Z'ev ben Shimon Halevi" who is a nice English gentleman from Hampstead who does not know any Hebrew. His books were used as authentic, scholarly source by many, including [[Simo Parpola]].

In 'Authorized Guardians' in ''Polemical Encounters'' (Olav Hammer and Kocku von Stuckrad (ed.), Leiden:Brill, 2007; p.&amp;nbsp;89) Prof. Boaz Huss at Ben-Gurion university points at the fact that the criticism launched at Halevi does appear in the chapter 'The Christian kabbalah'. These and other attempts can be viewed as 'boundary-constructing discourse' and 'othering of the enemy', depicting him as 'debased' or 'degenerated' to annihilate him (cp. Huss in Hammer/Von Stuckrad, 2007, xiii). Halevi lives in the London borough of Brent.
