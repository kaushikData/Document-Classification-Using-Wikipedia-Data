The '''2nd [[Islamic Solidarity Games]]''' were going to be an international sporting event scheduled to be held in [[Iran]] on 9–25 April, 2010. The Games were cancelled following a dispute between the host country and [[Saudi Arabia]].

==Suspension and cancellation of Games==
It was reported 3 May 2009, that Iran had suspended the games due to [[Persian Gulf naming dispute|a dispute over the use of the term "Persian Gulf"]].  Saudi Arabia and other Arabic countries disapproved of the use of the term "Persian Gulf" on literature and medals and insisted the term "Arabian Gulf" or just "Gulf" be used instead.  Iran claimed it was still in talks to try to salvage the games.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/03/islamic-games-iran-persian-gulf Iran Suspends Islamic Games over Row]. ''The Guardian'' (May 3, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 January 2010, the governing body of the ISG reported that the event had been canceled due to the tension between Arab states and Iran over the name of the body of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/17/islamic-solidarity-games-cancelled |title=Islamic Solidarity Games cancelled after gulf row divides nations |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=2010-01-17 |accessdate=2010-01-17 | location=London | first=Riyadh | last=Ap}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The year '''600 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. In the [[Roman Empire]], it was known as '''year 154 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'' '''. The denomination 600 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

The use of '''abusive language''' to another person is illegal in a small number of U.S. states.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030514020600/http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+18.2-416 Commonwealth of Virginia code on abusive language] Retrieved 2011-10-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.justia.com/codes/mississippi/2010/title-97/35/97-35-11/ Mississippi code on abusive language] Retrieved 2011-10-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Offenders are typically charged with this offense in conjunction with other crimes, such as [[aggressive driving]] or [[assault]]. However, in 1989 the [[New York State Court of Appeals]] ruled that abusive language was protected under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/62RVJkRas?url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/20/nyregion/new-york-court-voids-law-on-abusive-language.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm Sam Howe Verhovek, "New York Court Voids Law on Abusive Language".

[[File:Experts Cup WA SMC.jpg|thumb|Australian Rally Championship, West Australian Round, night stage. 2006.]]
The '''Australian Rally Championship''' (ARC) is Australia's leading off-road motor rally competition. A multi-event national championship has been held each year since 1968.

==Current competition==
The Australian Rally Championship takes in some of the country’s most stunning and picturesque locations.  The 2010 season starts with Rally Tasmania, the only tarmac round in the championship.  Based in the small coastal city of Burnie, Australia's longest-running tarmac rally is celebrating its 30th Anniversary this year.

The second round sees the championship head across the country for the Quit Forest Rally. The rally is based in the coastal tourist town of Busselton, near Margaret River in Western Australia.  Many of the rally stages are narrow and tree-lined, and are often covered in the notoriously slippery, ball-bearing gravel.

The third round of the championship takes place in the forest roads in the hills around Coffs Harbour, New South Wales.  The Coffs Coast Rally, known for its numerous surface changes, was cancelled in 2009 due to heavy rains and road damage.

The championship then travels to South Australia for the Scouts Rally SA.  The rally stages are located in the [[Barossa Valley]], [[Adelaide Hills]] and [[Mount Barker, South Australia|Mount Barker]] regions, and are within driving distance of the state capital Adelaide.  The rally stages are the smoothest and fastest in the championship, making the rally a favourite for competitors and spectators alike.

Round four of the Australian Rally Championship, and also a round of the FIA Asia-Pacific Championship, is the International Rally of Queensland.  The stages are held in the forests around the township of Imbil, in the Mary Valley just north of Brisbane.  The stages vary between tight and technical and fast and flowing, with many rough sections that give this event a reputation as a potential car-breaker.

The final round of the ARC will be a new round in the state of Victoria.  The event is set to based in the town of Drouin, located about 100 kilometres east of Melbourne.  The rally stages are to be held mostly in the foothills of Mount Baw Baw, using forestry roads in the Nojoee - Neerim district.

The Championship itself is a highly competitive series, featuring a host of talented teams all racing the clock for the honour of being champion. The competition is often very close, with drivers trading stage times over the gravel and tarmac roads and often finishing just tenths of seconds ahead, or behind, their rivals. In the forest, the action is thrilling. Cars slide sideways through high-speed corners and dodge and dive over challenging crested roads as the team-work between driver and co-driver is tested to the limit.

==Competition classes==
[[File:car rally.jpg|thumb|A Subaru Impreza WRX competing in an Australian rally.]]
The Australian Rally Championship caters to a range of different competitors in the series and with a number of classes and categories; competitors can start rallying at the level that best suits their budget.  The outright competition is fought out amongst the names of rallying and is the ultimate test for the competitors at the pointy end of the field.  The ARC’s top drivers compete in [[Group N]] (Production) - cars which have direct links to their road-going counterparts.  The ARC also offers opportunities for manufacturers who don’t produce Group N cars to build comparable machinery under both the Group N (P) and FIA [[Super 2000]] regulations.  Another award that is desirable for competitors to chase is the Privateers Cup for competitors who don't have support from the manufacturer teams.  The F16 Championship is the small car category (1600cc, 2WD) and a budget-level place to start rallying.  The outright winner of the Championship is an Australian Champion in the small car category and is added to the record books.  The Aussie Cup is the Australian award for large cars (over 2500cc) that enables competitors in the big cars to run popular passenger car models such as V6 and V8’s.  Amongst the outright awards are the opportunities to chase individual class awards that are based on car capacity and specification which gives competitors the opportunity to pursue class victories.

==Cars==
The more successful cars in recent years of the ARC have been the 4WD 2.0L Turbo models such as the [[Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution]]s, [[Subaru Impreza WRX STI]]s and the [[Toyota Corolla]] ARC-spec cars, which are actually running [[Toyota Celica GT-Four]] engines, 4WD system, etc.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}. Michael Guest and Mark Stacey campaigned a RWD 2.5L normally aspirated [[Ford Focus (International)|Ford Focus]] during the 2006 season, switching to a [[Ford Fiesta]] prepared for the [[Super 2000]] class in 2007.  Most of the cars in the privateer fields are of a similar make, but other makes with success have been the [[Mitsubishi Mirage]], [[Mitsubishi Galant VR-4]], [[Subaru Legacy]], [[Datsun 1600 (510)|Datsun 1600]], [[Datsun 240Z]], [[Nissan Stanza]] and the [[Suzuki Swift|Suzuki Swift GTi]].

==Drivers==
As with the cars, it tends to be the factory-entered drivers that take the outright placings.  Some of these drivers have been Colin Bond, Greg Carr. George Fury, Ross Dunkerton, Geoff Portman, Scott Pedder, Simon Evans, Neal Bates, the late [[Peter 'Possum' Bourne|Possum Bourne]] and [[Ed Ordynski]].  Privateer crews that have enjoyed recent success include Nathan Quinn and Steve Glenney. In 2015 [[Molly Taylor]] became the first woman to win a heat in the Australian Rally Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David McCowen |url=http://www.drive.com.au/motor-news/molly-taylor-makes-rallying-history-by-winning-a-heat-of-the-australian-rally-championship-20150404-1me49d.html#ixzz3XPReGHAh |title=Molly Taylor makes rallying history by winning a heat of the Australian Rally Championship |publisher=Drive.com.au |date=4 April 2015 |accessdate=2015-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Bad Newz Kennels dog fighting investigation''' began in April 2007 with a search of property in [[Surry County, Virginia|Surry County]], [[Virginia]], owned by [[Michael Vick]], who was at the time [[quarterback]] for the [[Atlanta Falcons]] football team, and the subsequent discovery of evidence of a [[Dog fighting in the United States|dog fighting]] ring. Over seventy dogs, mostly [[pit bull terrier]]s, with some said to be showing signs of injuries, were seized, along with physical evidence during several searches of Vick's {{convert|15|acre|m2|adj=on}} property by local, state and federal authorities.

The case drew widespread publicity to the issues of [[animal abuse]] and dog fighting. It also drew attention to unlawful [[gambling]] and drug activities which authorities claim often accompany dog fighting. Subsequently, Vick and three other principals were convicted of [[federal offense]] conspiracy charges and imprisoned. Vick was suspended by the [[NFL]], was ordered to pay the Atlanta Falcons back a portion of his earnings, and lost endorsement deals worth millions more. With other creditors also attempting to collect millions of dollars in debts, in July 2008, he filed for [[Chapter 11]] (reorganization) bankruptcy protection.

==Overview==
[[File:Michael-Vick Jets-vs-Eagles-Sept-3-2009 Post-Game-Interview (cropped).jpg|thumb|Michael Vick]]
The Bad Newz dog fighting investigation began in April 2007 with a search of property in [[Surry County, Virginia|Surry County]], [[Virginia]], owned by [[Atlanta Falcons]]’ football [[quarterback]] [[Michael Vick]], and the subsequent discovery of evidence of a [[Dog fighting in the United States|dog fighting]] ring in [[Newport News, Virginia]]. Over 70 dogs, mostly [[pit bull terrier]]s, with some said to be showing signs of injuries, were seized along with physical evidence during several searches of Vick's 15-acre (60,000 m²) property by local, state and federal authorities.

In July 2007, Vick and three other men were indicted on [[federal offense]] and state [[felony]] charges relating to a six-year-long continuing criminal enterprise of an interstate dog fighting ring known as “Bad Newz Kennels,” based upon a local nickname for [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]], Vick's hometown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-now-vickindictment,0,7988632.story ]{{dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allegations included Vick's direct involvement in dog fighting, high-stakes [[gambling]], and brutal executions of dogs. Public outcry resulted from widespread news media publicity of the details which included hanging, drowning, electrocuting, "slamming", and shooting dogs. There were public demonstrations by both Vick supporters and animal rights activists. In the wake, many companies who had been paying for his endorsements withdrew Vick products from retail marketing when he was convicted.

By August 20, all the defendants on the initial federal charges including Vick had agreed to guilty pleas under [[plea bargain]] agreements, apparently avoiding facing the possibility of additional and more serious charges under the powerful [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated15&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?id=2974225 |title=Two more plea deals spell serious trouble for Vick |website=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2007-08-15 |accessdate=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ESPNPlea"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2983121 |title=Vick faces prison time after agreeing to plead guilty|website=Sports.espn.go.com |accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. District Court Judge [[Henry E. Hudson]], who is not bound by sentencing recommendations in plea agreements, had previously advised two of the defendants that the aggravated circumstances involving executing the dogs warranted an upward revision of the sentencing guidelines. The single felony charges carry a maximum sentence of five years.

On November 30, Peace and Phillips were sentenced by Judge Hudson to 18 and 21 months in [[federal prison]] respectively. The punishments were higher than recommended by federal prosecutors, and included three years of supervised probation following their release from prison. During the sentencing, an attorney for Quanis Phillips argued that his client came from a culture in which [[dog fighting]] was an accepted practice. He further claimed that Phillips grew up around it and that it was a proving ground for young men to demonstrate their strength, adding "Dogfighting was an accepted and acceptable activity in their world." They attended dogfights as youths. Then, after Vick signed his first NFL contract, "...suddenly there's money for these young men to get dogs … get involved in this world."

Judge Hudson responded that while they might have grown up seeing dogfighting as normal behavior, that didn't temper guilt in this case. As he pronounced a sentence which exceeded the guidelines and plea agreement recommendations, he stated:

At the time of the November 30 hearings for Peace and Phillips, Vick was being held at Northern Neck Regional Jail in [[Warsaw, Virginia|Warsaw]], [[Virginia]] where he had turned himself in early while awaiting sentencing on the federal convictions on December 10, 2007.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/falcons/2007-11-19-vick-surrender_N.htm |title= Michael Vick surrenders to federal authorities |accessdate = 2007-11-19 | work=USA Today | first=Gary | last=Mihoces | date=November 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vick received a harsher sentence than Peace and Phillips after Hudson concluded that the suspended Atlanta Falcons quarterback lied about his direct involvement in killing dogs and about his [[marijuana]] use, which was detected in a drug test, as well as his greater role in the criminal enterprise and lesser cooperation during the earlier investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailypress.com/news/local/virginia/dp-sou--vickco-defendant1214dec14,0,419898.story ]{{dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor, who is alleged to have had a greater role in the conspiracy than Peace and Phillips was also due to be sentenced on December 10, but, like Peace and Phillips, had agreed to testify against Vick at trial before he also accepted a plea agreement.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.hamptonroads.com/story.cfm?story%3D137917%26ran%3D7572%26tref%3Dpo |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201130332/http://content.hamptonroads.com/story.cfm?story=137917&amp;ran=7572&amp;tref=po |archivedate=2007-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to federal actions, a parallel state investigation had also been underway since April 2007. [[Surry County, VA|Surry County]] prosecutor Gerald L. Poindexter later described the information contained in the federal plea agreements as "a road map to indictments in Surry County."&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wvec.com/news/local/stories/wvec_local_081707_poindexter_on_pleadings.428eb3b2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927074344/http://www.wvec.com/news/local/stories/wvec_local_081707_poindexter_on_pleadings.428eb3b2.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plea bargains with federal prosecutors would have no official standing in the local cases against any of the four federal co-defendants. ([[Double jeopardy]] concepts would not apply to state and federal overlapping cases). In September, 2007, all four men convicted in the federal case were also indicted by the Surry County Grand Jury on state felony charges relating to dog fighting under state laws after indictments were returned by a local [[grand jury]] in [[Surry County, Virginia|Surry County]], [[Virginia]]. Vick faces two [[felony]] counts under state laws and his trial in Surry County Circuit Court has been set for April 2, 2008. The maximum penalty if then convicted on the state charges would be 10 years in a state penitentiary.

Unlike the other men, Vick was a millionaire and celebrity. During his time in Philadelphia he led the Eagles to the playoffs and picked up his first new endorsement deal with Unequal Technologies. Unequal Technologies makes shoulder pads for the NFL and its players.

In December 2009, Sports Illustrated named Michael Vick and the dog fighting investigation as one of the top 10 sports news stories of the decade of the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/magazine/specials/2000s/12/12/top.stories/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105065108/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/magazine/specials/2000s/12/12/top.stories/index.html |archivedate=2010-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business associates in kennel business at Surry County property==
In the following several months, various media sources revealed that Vick has close ties and business relationships with three other men who are apparently not his relatives, but were involved with the Surry County property and/or his activities with pit bulls prior to April 25. Tony Taylor, Quanis L. Phillips, and Charles W. Reamon, Jr. Both Taylor and Phillips have had drug-related brushes with the law; Reamon has had multiple firearms incidents.

Charles W. ("C.J.") Reamon, Jr., is the nephew of Vick's former high school coach, [[Tommy Reamon]]. It was reported that in January 2006 he paid the $50 fee to renew the Moonlight Road kennel license which is listed in Taylor's name with Surry County. Reamon's uncle, Tommy Reamon, who coached Vick during his high school football career in Newport News, described his nephew as "a good boy who works for Vick." Coach Reamon has recently accused the news media of "trying to destroy" Vick, which Newport News ''Daily Press'' columnist David Teel described as a "tired, transparent and bogus claim." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=David Teel |title=Vick Case: Silence is Golden |publisher=''The Daily Press'' |date=2007-06-11 |url=http://www.dailypress.com/sports/dp-56155cm0jun10,0,4118056.column?coll=dp-sports-local |accessdate = 2007-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"C.J." Reamon has three convictions related to illegal firearms or airport security, including being caught for lying about his criminal record when he was employed in security work at [[Norfolk International Airport]] (discovered during a "sting" investigation), and an incident in August 2006 when he was caught carrying a loaded [[.357 SIG]] Glock into the [[Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport]] terminal. In February 2007, "C.J." Reamon and Vick were together when Vick was charged with a minor fishing boat sticker violation in Norfolk's Western Branch Reservoir by a Virginia game warden.&lt;ref name="Images"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dave Forster, Bill Burke and Kyle Tucker |title=Conflicting images |publisher=''The Roanoke Times'' |date=2007-05-26 |url=http://www.roanoke.com/news/roanoke/wb/118378 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130202004959/http://www.roanoke.com/news/roanoke/wb/118378 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-02 |accessdate=2007-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ESPN reported that, very shortly after the initial raid in late April, Vick "threw Taylor off the Surry property" and listed it with real estate agents for sale. The {{convert|15|acre|m2|adj=on}} property includes a large brick house painted white, a small swimming pool, and a basketball court. Four outbuildings painted black are located in the woods. It was reported by the local news media as under a sales contract for approximately 50% of its assessed value with a day or so of listing. However, according to published reports, as of July 6 no transfer papers had been filed with the county clerk where deeds are recorded.&lt;ref name="Raid"&gt;{{cite news |author=Ohm Youngmisuk |title=Dog daze |publisher=''NY Daily News'' |date=2007-06-10 |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/2007/06/10/2007-06-10_dog_daze.html |accessdate = 2007-06-25 | location=New York| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070612132835/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/2007/06/10/2007-06-10_dog_daze.html| archivedate= 12 June 2007| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated11&gt;{{cite web |author=D.

==Local investigation, search challenged by cousin==
During the subsequent weeks, Surry County Sheriff Harold D. Brown and [[Commonwealth (United States)|Commonwealth]]'s Attorney (local prosecutor) Gerald G. Poindexter repeatedly responded to media inquiries with assurances that they were proceeding carefully with the investigation and any prosecutions and that anyone "whoever they are" who evidence indicates had acted unlawfully will be charged. According to the Code of Virginia (3.1-796.124), illegal activities relating to dog fighting (or supporting it) are [[felony]] offenses under Virginia laws.&lt;ref name="Penalty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+3.1-796.124 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010413153024/http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+3.1-796.124 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2001-04-13 |title=Legislative Information System |website=Leg1.state.va.us |date= |accessdate=2016-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Virginia criminal statutes also prohibit [[gambling]], which has also been alleged against Vick by an ESPN source who claimed to have seen Vick bet as much as $40,000 on the outcome of a single dog fight. On May 31, when asked by a news reporter for WAVY-TV whether there was evidence that placed Vick at dog fights, Poindexter replied "Yes".&lt;ref name="Feds"&gt;{{cite web |author=Len Pasquarelli |title=Source: Vick probe receiving increased attention from feds |publisher=ESPN |date=2007-05-31 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2888085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, Boddie, who had recently moved from Surry County to Newport News, conducted interviews with news reporters from local television stations and the Newport News ''[[Daily Press (Virginia)|Daily Press]]'' newspaper in front of the nightclub in Hampton where one of his arrests had taken place. He alleged a conspiracy by authorities dating from 2001, claiming the amount of [[marijuana]] he admits having on April 20 was not justification for the search warrant of his Surry County residence, an opinion local prosecutors from several different jurisdictions took strong objection to, according to the ''Daily Press'' on June 8. Boddie accused authorities of being dishonest regarding the quantity of drugs he had and whether he was in possession of a firearm when arrested on April 20, claiming that the authorities will do anything to make "[him] and [his] peeps [people] look bad.

==Federal investigation assisted by state police revealed==
[[File:Dogfighting.ogg|thumb|Speech by Senator [[Robert Byrd]] made to U.S. Senate following the indictment of Michael Vick on federal dog fighting charges]]
Following weeks of increasing reports in the news media of Vick’s involvement and new evidence and witnesses reportedly coming forward to authorities, according to ''[[USA Today]]'', on June 7, federal authorities, assisted by the Virginia State Police, revealed their own investigation, and began an additional search of the property. Surry County Commonwealth's Attorney Poindexter told ''USA Today'' that an official of the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]]'s Office of the Inspector General notifying him by telephone about 3 PM [[North American Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] on June 7 also advised him that the local authorities loved what he did, but were free to continue their own ongoing investigation. News media reports on WAVY-TV at 11 PM that evening placed Poindexter at the Vick home and property, apparently observing the search. Federal authorities, assisted by Virginia State Police, conducted an additional search on July 6, as reported by multiple news media sources. Federal and state police officials had not issued any public statements as of that time.

==Federal court filings and additional search==
Documents filed in federal court in Richmond on July 2 and obtained by the [[Associated Press]] under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] outline an extensive multi-state dog fighting enterprise named "Bad Newz Kennels" which was allegedly operating from the Vick property since at least 2002. For the events, participants and dogs traveled from South Carolina, North Carolina, Maryland, New York, Texas and other states. At least three people are expected to be indicted. On July 7, the ''[[Free-Lance Star]]'' newspaper based in [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]], [[Virginia]] noted that on Vick's website, he lists his birthplace as Newport News, "a.k.a. BadNews."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hank Kurz Jr. and Michael Felberbaum |title=Charges Coming In Surry Federal Officials Allege Dogfighting At Vick's Former Property, But The Falcon Is Not Named In Court Papers |publisher=Fredericksburg.com |date=2007-07-07 |url=http://www.fredericksburg.com/News/FLS/2007/072007/07072007/298386/index_html?page=1 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120731133838/http://www.fredericksburg.com/News/FLS/2007/072007/07072007/298386/index_html?page=1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-31 |accessdate=2007-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, ''The Atlanta Constitution'' noted that the [[Urban Dictionary]] lists "Bad Newz" as the street name for Newport News.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt; WAVY-TV (Portsmouth, VA) posted a copy of one of the federal court document from July 2, and has made it available online at WAVY-TV online copy of July 2 document obtained under Freedom of Information request about the "Bad Newz Kennels" interstate dog fighting investigation.

==Status of investigations, charges==

===Federal===

====July 2 filings====
The federal court filings of July 2 alleged that Vick's property was used as the "main staging area for housing and training the pit bulls involved in the dog fighting venture." A source close to the investigation told ESPN's [[Len Pasquarelli]] that the events of Friday [July 6] were "very helpful in the overall and ongoing investigation into an alleged dogfighting ring at that property. ... Remember, this is an investigation into what has been accepted an enterprise involving many people... From our standpoint, it never has focused on an individual and it still doesn't." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&amp;id=2928795 |title=Vick shouldn't exhale yet |website=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2007-07-18 |accessdate=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====July 17 indictments====
On July 17, a federal grand jury indicted Vick and 3 others on multiple counts, stating that Vick and three other men spent six years "knowingly sponsoring and exhibiting in an animal fighting venture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/vick20070717-2.pdf?loc=interstitialskip |work=USA Today |title=UNITED STATES OF AMERICA V. PURNELL A. PEACE, QUANIS L. PHILLIPS, TONY TAYLOR, MICHAEL VICK |accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost immediately, speculation began regarding Vick's future in the NFL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/football/nfl/07/17/dohrmann.vick/index.html?cnn=yes | work=CNN | title=Indictment against Vick describes unfathomable acts | date=July 17, 2007 | accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The grand jury also charged the men with establishing a kennel to represent dogfighting competitions, purchase and train pitbulls in dogfighting competitions and "destroying or otherwise disposing of dogs not selected to stay with the ongoing animal fighting venture." The case was assigned to [[Henry E. Hudson]] in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia|U.S. District Court]] in Richmond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/notablecases/vick/docs/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706130438/http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/notablecases/vick/docs/index.html |archivedate=2008-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an [[ESPN]] attorney, a new "tough" federal law passed by the [[U.S. Congress]] in April 2007 and signed by President [[George W. Bush]] on May 3, 2007 is being used in many ongoing investigations of dog fighting around the country. However, Vick and his codefendants were charged under the older laws, which carry lower penalties. Vick and his codefendants each face $350,000 in fines and six years in prison if convicted of the federal charges.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/07/17/sportsline/main3067633.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Michael Vick Indicted By Grand Jury | date=July 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; (On the [[Travel Act]] portion of the conspiracy charges, he faces a maximum of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. The dogfighting charges carry a possible sentence of one year in prison, a $100,000 fine, or both).

====Vick's codefendants====
The ''Virginian-Pilot'' reported that the other three men indicted were longtime associates of property-owner Vick, who was also known to members of the alleged conspiracy as "Ookie" according to the federal indictment.
* Purnell A. Peace (also known as "P-Funk" or "Funk") is a cousin of Tony Taylor. He had drug-related convictions in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/content/sports/falcons/stories/2007/07/26/vickhearing_0726.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124005344/http://www.ajc.com/news/content/sports/falcons/stories/2007/07/26/vickhearing_0726.html |archivedate=2007-11-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He called the Surry County Sheriff's Office in May 2007 to report a break-in and theft of furniture at Vick’s Moonlight Road property. With his residence listed as [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]], media sources have published no information about him beyond that contained in the federal indictments and the break-in report from May.
* Quanis L. Phillips (also known as "Q") played football with Vick in high school in Newport News. The federal indictment claims that he, along with Vick and defendant Tony Taylor, purchased four pit bull puppies for approximately $1,000 in September 2001 from someone in [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]], [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name = "defence"/&gt; He was listed as a contact to call to buy a dog on a website (no longer active) for "Vicks' K9 Kennels", which apparently operated from the Surry property. The website, no longer active, said it bred pit bulls but "was not involved with dogfighting." That website was linked to MV7 LLC, a company affiliated with Vick.&lt;ref name = "Images"/&gt; ''The Atlanta Journal-Constitution'' identified Phillips as one of Vick's employees with MV7 LLC in an article about marketing shoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author='That's my shoe' |title='That's my shoe' |publisher=''The Atlanta Journal-Constitution'' |url=http://test.ajc.com/sports/mboard/WELIKEMIKEVickTalk/controlDb?PageId=TlToVt&amp;topicID=57447&amp;boardId=614 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930024044/http://test.ajc.com/sports/mboard/WELIKEMIKEVickTalk/controlDb?PageId=TlToVt&amp;topicID=57447&amp;boardId=614 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-09-30 |accessdate = 2007-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the now-defunct website, Phillips was listed as the person to contact about purchasing dogs. His criminal background includes a 1997 arrest for possession of stolen property and a guilty plea in 1999 to misdemeanor possession with intent to distribute marijuana. In October 2000, he was convicted in Newport News of violating drug control act, sentenced to one month in jail and fined, and also convicted of contempt of court and sentenced to five days in jail.

====Detention and arraignment hearing, bail conditions====
On July 26, all four pleaded "not guilty" to all of the charges against them during a hearing before Judge Hudson at the Lewis F.

All four defendants were required to be under active supervision of the court, surrender their passports, refrain from travel outside their immediate area without prior approval, and stay away from dogs, guns, and each other. Peace, Phillips and Taylor must undergo random drug tests, but not Vick, as he has no prior convictions. Peace and Phillips were also required to submit to electronic monitoring via ankle bracelets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/falcons/2007-07-26-vick-hearing_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Michael Vick pleads not guilty in dogfighting case | first=Gary | last=Mihoces | date=July 27, 2007 | accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/07/26/vick.dogfighting/index.html#cnnSTCText | work=CNN | title=Vick pleads not guilty - CNN.com | accessdate=2010-04-26 | date=July 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor was ordered to undergo [[substance abuse]] evaluation and treatment.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

Federal prosecutors announced plans to file a superseding indictment by the end of August.

Munson also believes that the threat of a superseding indictment is intended to make the defendants plead guilty and cooperate with the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=munson_lester&amp;id=2950481 |title=Vick's first court appearance: Double-barreled trouble |website=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2007-07-26 |accessdate=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two hearings took a total of 25 minutes, which is typical for a court popularly known as "the rocket docket" for the speed with which proceedings are conducted. It was unclear whether the same bail arrangements would also apply to additional federal charges, should any result from the superseding indictment anticipated next month, or whether additional state charges would violate the terms of the bail.

====Vick prepared statement====
Afterwards, Vick issued a prepared statement through his lawyer, his first public comment since the indictment, in which he proclaimed his innocence, but apologized to his mother and his teammates. The terms of his bail theoretically left Vick free to play until the trial, provided he got permission from the court to travel outside the immediate area of his primary residence. However, Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank stated that Vick had to give up any thoughts of playing until the case is resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2950226 |title=Judge orders Vick's conditional release |website=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2007-07-26 |accessdate=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Taylor pleads guilty, submits "Summary of the Facts"====
On July 30, Tony Taylor entered a guilty plea before Judge Henry E. Hudson at the U.S. District Court in Richmond. Taylor, 34, said he was not promised any specific sentence in return for his cooperation with the government.
The ''Roanoke Times'' reported that Judge Hudson asked Taylor: "You're pleading guilty and taking your chances, right?" and "You have agreed to cooperate fully with the United States, is that right?"

Taylor responded to each question, "Yes." Hudson set sentencing for December 14.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120909041641/http://www.roanoke.com/news/breaking/wb/126219 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Washington Post'', in the "Summary of the Facts" filed along with the plea and signed by Taylor, he admitted that he helped start "Bad Newz Kennels" with Vick and two other co-defendants in 2001 and participated fully in the enterprise before leaving in September 2004 after a disagreement with Phillips "and others."

Taylor's statement says the dogfighting ring's operations and gambling money "were almost exclusively funded by Vick." It also says Vick paid more than $30,000 to purchase the property near Smithfield, Virginia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/30/AR2007073000518.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Co-Defendant in Vick Case Pleads Guilty | first=Jerry | last=Markon | date=July 31, 2007 | accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the house and outbuildings for training fighting dogs were built as the home of Bad Newz Kennels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Taylor details Vick's role |publisher=inRich.com |date=2007-07-31 |url=http://www.inrich.com/cva/ric/news.apx.-content-articles-RTD-2007-07-31-0098.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20080829120908/http://www.inrich.com/cva/ric/news.apx.-content-articles-RTD-2007-07-31-0098.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-08-29 |accessdate=2007-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Norfolk ''Virginian-Pilot'' newspaper noted that Taylor's plea document described eight matches that he says Vick attended or sponsored between late 2002 and 2004, with dogs named Jane, Big Boy, Zebro, Magic, Tiny and Too Short. The group put the name "Bad Newz Kennels" to the operation in early 2002, according to the document. "At one point, the defendants obtained shirts and headbands representing and promoting their affiliation with 'Bad Newz Kennels,' "the summary says.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.hamptonroads.com/story.cfm?story%3D129433%26ran%3D38431%26tref%3Dpo |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926234938/http://content.hamptonroads.com/story.cfm?story=129433&amp;ran=38431&amp;tref=po |archivedate=2007-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newspaper made a copy of the entire 13-page "Summary of Facts" submitted with Taylor's plea and obtained under the Freedom of Information Act available online at: [http://media.hamptonroads.com/media/content/pilotonline/2007/07/taylorplea0730.pdf Tony Taylor "Summary of Facts" plea document 7-30-2007]. The specific language that Vick provided almost all the funds and participated in the "ongoing criminal enterprise" in the plea documents fueled speculation by legal experts that Vick would face federal [[racketeering]] charges under the powerful [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]]. There had already been talk that the government might seek a RICO indictment, based on the specific "continuing criminal enterprise" language in the original indictment and in Taylor's plea agreement. A key element of proving racketeering is the existence of a "criminal enterprise," and gambling is an indictable offense under RICO. RICO is relatively easy to prove in court, as it focuses on patterns of criminal behavior. If Vick had been charged under RICO, he would have faced penalties of up to 20 years in prison and pay [[treble damages]].

====Other co-defendants also to plead guilty; Vick weighs options====
By August 13, Vick's other two co-defendants, Peace and Phillips, had also agreed to also plead guilty under their own plea agreements, they were due in judge Hudson's court in consecutive hearings on August 17.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-03840sy0aug14,0,7380937.story?coll=hr_tab01_layout ]{{dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

News media reported widely that Vick has been given until that date (August 17) to decide whether to seek a plea bargain; otherwise he will face a superseding indictment that will include at least two more federal charges. According to one of his public relations specialists, Vick was weighing all of his options with his legal team.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2972161 |title=Vick must decide whether to accept plea agreement |website=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2007-08-16 |accessdate=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Richmond Times-Dispatch'' reported on August 15 that a federal grand jury in Richmond was to begin hearing new allegations against Vick stemming from the dogfighting case beginning the week of August 20.&lt;ref name="deal"&gt;{{cite web |title=Deal to limit term, save career sought for Vick |publisher=inRich.com |date=2007-08-15 |url=http://www.inRich.com/cva/ric/news.apx.-content-articles-RTD-2007-08-15-0147.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070927004230/http://www.inrich.com/cva/ric/news.apx.-content-articles-RTD-2007-08-15-0147.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-09-27 |accessdate=2007-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Munson suggested that Peace and Phillips' guilty pleas put Vick in a "legal checkmate," as their testimony, added to the other five potential witnesses the prosecutors already had, made it very difficult for Vick's legal team to prove reasonable doubt in court.&lt;ref name=autogenerated15 /&gt;

According to the ''Journal-Constitution,'' Vick's legal team began talks with federal prosecutors regarding a possible plea agreement soon after Vick's co-defendants pleaded guilty.&lt;ref name="Plea"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/sports/content/sports/falcons/stories/2007/08/14/vick_0815.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113210145/http://www.ajc.com/sports/content/sports/falcons/stories/2007/08/14/vick_0815.html |archivedate=2008-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for Vick's legal team said that the co-defendant's pleas took them by surprise.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

ESPN reported that another sticking point in the plea negotiations was the wording of the [[allocution]] Vick would have to make. He would have to make a detailed statement as to the extent of his involvement in the operation, such as the specific methods he used to kill the dogs.

On August 17, Peace and Phillips appeared before Judge Hudson at the U.S. District Court in Richmond. They entered their guilty pleas, plea agreements, and related statement of facts documentation. They also agreed to testify if the government requests it from them. Phillips' bail was revoked due to failing a drug test.

Peace and Phillips were told that because of the "victimization and execution of pit bull dogs" described in court filings, "upward departure" from the sentencing guidelines is "necessary in this case." The aggravating factors will be taken into consideration at sentencing, which means they could face harsher punishments at their sentencing on November 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailypress.com/dp-now-vickupdate.au17,0,1052979.story |title=Two co-defendants enter guilty pleas; no word from Vick |publisher=Daily Press |date=2007-08-17 |accessdate=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documents filed with the court and obtained by the news media under the provisions of the U.S. Freedom of Information Act provided confirmation of portions of that contained in Taylor's earlier plea agreement and also gave more detail of co-defendant Vick's roles.

====Vick pleads guilty====
On August 20, 2007 Vick pleaded guilty to the federal felony dogfighting conspiracy charge. Vick's lawyer [[Billy Martin (lawyer)|Billy Martin]] released this statement.

"After consulting with his family over the weekend, Michael Vick has asked that I announce today that he has reached an agreement with federal prosecutors regarding charges pending against him.

"Mr. Vick has agreed to enter a plea of guilty to those charges and to accept full responsibility for his actions and the mistakes he has made. Michael wishes to apologize again to everyone who has been hurt by this matter."&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id%3D298 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103041620/http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=298 |archivedate=2012-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=On Monday, Vick will take responsibility |author=Campbell, Tom |publisher=inRich.com |date=2007-08-21 |url=http://www.inrich.com/cva/ric/news.apx.-content-articles-RTD-2007-08-21-0130.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20071009103232/http://www.inrich.com/cva/ric/news.apx.-content-articles-RTD-2007-08-21-0130.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-09 |accessdate = 2007-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 24, 2007 it was announced that Vick had signed a plea agreement and issued a statement admitting his participation and funding of the dogfighting ring, but maintaining that he did not place any bets or take any prize money.&lt;ref name="guiltyplea"&gt;{{cite web |title=Vick signs plea deal, admits providing gambling funds |author=Green, Frank |publisher=inRich.com |date=2007-08-24 |url=http://www.inrich.com/cva/ric/news.apx.-content-articles-RTD-2007-08-24-0183.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070927003420/http://www.inrich.com/cva/ric/news.apx.-content-articles-RTD-2007-08-24-0183.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-09-27 |accessdate = 2007-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Details of Vick's plea agreement were made available when filed with the court on August 24. ''USA Today'' made copies available over the Internet in PDF files at:
* [https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/vick-plea-deal-070824.pdf Vick plea agreement 8-24-2007]
* [https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/vick-summary-of-facts-070824.pdf Vick summary of facts 8-24-2007]

On August 27, Vick appeared before Judge Hudson and submitted the guilty plea. In the scheduled December 10 sentencing, Vick faced a maximum of five years in prison, a fine of $250,000 and three years of supervised release. Prosecutors asked Hudson to sentence Vick to 12–18 months if Vick cooperated with the government as he had agreed to do in the terms of the original plea agreement. The terms of the plea agreement include a clause in which Vick forfeits his right to appeal any sentence imposed upon him. Though prosecutors asked for a lower-end sentence for Vick, Hudson could still increase the sentence up to the maximum limits; Hudson had informed two co-defendants that the brutality warranted exceeding the guidelines in their cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ca.today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=sportsNews&amp;storyID=2007-08-27T155222Z_01_N23262339_RTRIDST_0_SPORTS-NFL-VICK-1-COL.XML |title=Vick pleads guilty in dogfighting case |accessdate=2007-11-07 |work=Reuters }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant portion of the plea agreement involved Vick cooperating with federal authorities pursuing other dog fighting cases and a complete [[allocution]] on his role in the Bad Newz Kennels, including detailing his role in the killing of dogs after the fights. The allocution proved to be a "sticking point," as both federal prosecutors and FBI agents reported that Vick was giving contradictory statements about how dogs were killed, what his role in the killings were, how many dogs were killed, and other details.&lt;ref name="ajc-Boost"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ajc.com/sports/content/sports/falcons/stories/2007/12/10/vick_1211.html?cxntlid=homepage_tab_newstab |title=Vick's Lies Boosted Prison Time |accessdate=2007-12-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071211090042/http://www.ajc.com/sports/content/sports/falcons/stories/2007/12/10/vick_1211.html?cxntlid=homepage_tab_newstab |archivedate = December 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to reporters who spoke to Hudson after the sentencing, Vick's pre-sentencing behavior, especially during an FBI polygraph administered in October 2007 which showed that Vick was being deceptive when asked direct questions about killing dogs, was a factor in selecting the length of the sentence.&lt;ref name="ajc-Boost" /&gt;

====Sentencing====
On November 30, Peace and Phillips were sentenced by Judge Hudson to 18 and 21 months in federal prison respectively. The punishments were higher than recommended by federal prosecutors, and included three years of supervised probation following their release from prison.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-news_dogsentencing_1201dec01,0,1801821.story?coll=hr_tab01_layout ]{{dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor is also due to be sentenced on December 10, but, like Peace and Phillips, had agreed to testify against Vick at trial before he also accepted a plea agreement.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13 /&gt;

News media reported that statements re the November 30 hearing made it clearer that co-defendant Tony Taylor led Bad Newz Kennels. He guided others who were newcomers to the dogfighting underworld, according to arguments presented in U.S. District Court during the sentencing hearings. An attorney for Phillips argued before Judge Hudson that Taylor was known as "the dog man" as "an experienced dogfighter and trainer." &lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

At the time of the November 30 hearings for Peace and Phillips, Vick was being held at Northern Neck Regional Jail in [[Warsaw, Virginia]] awaiting sentencing on the federal convictions &lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; and his April 2, 2008 trial on the Virginia state charges.

Vick was sentenced to 23 months in prison on the federal charges on December 10, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/law/12/10/vick.sentenced/index.html |title=Vick sentenced to 23 months for dogfighting |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211120818/http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/law/12/10/vick.sentenced/index.html |archivedate=2007-12-11 |accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tony Taylor, who was the first to plead guilty, received a sentence of 60 days in jail on December 14, 2007, which was within the sentencing guidelines for no more than 6 months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3154573|title=Tony Taylor sentenced|accessdate = 2007-12-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071215144148/http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3154573| archivedate= 15 December 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen, who sold some of the dogs used in the operation, received probation on January 25, 2008.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3213950|title=Last defendant, Oscar Allen, gets probation|accessdate=2008-02-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080128174209/http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3213950| archivedate= 28 January 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor was released from federal prison on March 20, 2008, with 9 days of time off for good behavior. State trials for Taylor, Vick, Peace, and Philips have been pushed back until logistics related to the transportation of Vick, Peace, and Philips are resolved (they are in prisons in Kansas, New Jersey, and Florida, respectively).

====Disposition of property====
The property used in the operation, 1915 Moonlight Road has been purchased by Dogs Deserve Better, Inc, and is a dog rehabilitation center for chained and penned canines. It is known as the Good Newz Rehab Center, playing on the former tenants name.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dogsdeservebetter.org/ddbcenter.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150813073427/http://www.dogsdeservebetter.org/ddbcenter.html |archivedate=2015-08-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State===

====Investigation====
As of August 18, possible additional state charges were still under investigation. Part-time Commonwealth's Attorney Gerald G. Poindexter and Sheriff Harold D. Brown in the county had been criticized for slowness, particularly by the investigative news reports of [[WAVY-TV]], the [[NBC]] affiliate in Hampton Roads. In response, they have indicated "doing it right" was more a priority than speed, and that they are continuing to cooperate with federal authorities.

According to an ESPN attorney, under Virginia law, Vick can be prosecuted if the authorities can show that he was "aware" of dogfighting activities on his property. According to that attorney, "If it is proved that the fighting took place, it will be difficult for Vick to persuade anyone that he didn't know about it."&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;{{cite web |author=Lester Munson |title=Federal involvement is not good news for Vick |publisher=ESPN |date=2007-06-15 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2905920 |accessdate = 2007-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to other news media reports, Surry County investigators have spoken to as many as 30 people. In June, Sheriff's Department Deputy W.R. Brinkman, the lead local investigator, said he had "more people to talk to." Sheriff Harold D. Brown stated in an interview published on June 28 ..."we need to find out, if he's one of the big players or not."

Following the federal indictments of July 17, local authorities in Surry County said they could possibly prosecute different crimes than those charged in the federal indictment. Poindexter and Brown said they are continuing to cooperate with federal authorities. Both Brown and Poindexter told news media that they were taken aback by the level of detail in the indictments, especially mention of dogs allegedly being executed by hanging, drowning and electrocution. "That's revealing to me. I didn't know anything about that," said Poindexter, according to the ''[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]''.
&lt;ref name="arraignment"&gt;{{cite web |title=Vick arraignment next week |publisher=inRich.com |date=2007-07-18 |url=http://www.inrich.com/cva/ric/news.apx.-content-articles-RTD-2007-07-18-0200.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070927003426/http://www.inrich.com/cva/ric/news.apx.-content-articles-RTD-2007-07-18-0200.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-09-27 |accessdate = 2007-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Poindexter said he thought most people in the county didn’t know about the alleged fights. "It's an underground, well-guarded crime," he said. He also noted that he has also learned a great deal about dog fighting recently which he hadn't known before.

Although the federal investigation and charges placed drew most publicity in July and August, 2007, the local investigation and consideration of charges under violations of state laws were also continuing. Plea bargains with federal prosecutors would have no official standing in the local case. [[Double jeopardy]] concepts would not apply to state and federal overlapping cases. The county [[Grand Jury|grand jury]] would be the group which would typically consider [[felony]] indictments presented by a local prosecutor under state laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dave Forster |title=Surry prepares for grand jury hearing into dogfighting |publisher=PilotOnline.com |date=2007-06-18 |url=http://content.hamptonroads.com/story.cfm?story=127481&amp;ran=141169 |accessdate=2007-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235631/http://content.hamptonroads.com/story.cfm?story=127481&amp;ran=141169 |archivedate=2007-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 24, Brown stated that he felt certain state indictments for additional charges in Virginia would be returned by a local grand jury during session which begins September 25. However, no individuals have been named as target(s) to date. Until August 17, there had also been no indication of how many charges might be presented to the grand jury in Surry County. Over 50 dogs were seized, in addition to carcasses recovered, and a number of the interstate fight events, all with attendant gambling activities, were allegedly hosted at Vick's Surry County estate.

On August 17, Surry County Commonwealth's Attorney Gerald Poindexter told [[WVEC-TV]] that the admissions contained in the federal plea agreements filed by Purnell Peace and Quanis Phillips were "a road map to indictments in Surry County." &lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; The plea agreements implicate all four men, Peace, Phillips, Taylor and Vick in both dog fighting and the killing of dogs. It had been noted in earlier media reports that one of the agreements states that eight dogs were killed jointly by Peace, Phillips and Vick in April 2007 (prior to the April 25 search).

Poindexter told the WVEC news reporter that he's looking at two felony counts: dogfighting and killing of a companion animal. The maximum sentence in Virginia for each charge is five years. "We believed we had evidence and this is the first time someone's admitted to it. It's sad and outrageous. It's gruesome." he added.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; It was also not clear whether any state prison sentence(s) would be allowed run concurrently with any federal time, or would be served consecutively. ESPN reported on August 18 that Vick could face up to 40 years in prison under state laws.&lt;ref name="ESPNOptions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2980323 |title=Plea agreement may not arrive until Monday |website=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2007-08-20 |accessdate=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====State Indictments====
Following guilty pleas in the federal case, Vick, Taylor, Peace, and Phillips were indicted on state felony charges relating to dog fighting under state laws by after indictments were returned by a local [[grand jury]] in [[Surry County, Virginia|Surry County]], [[Virginia]] in September, 2007.

Vick faced two felony counts under state laws and his jury trial in Surry County Circuit Court was to have begun on April 2, 2008. The maximum penalty if convicted on the state charges would be 10 years in prison. His co-defendants were also assigned trial dates. Purnell Peace was scheduled to face a jury trial March 5, 2008, as was Quanis Phillips, but did not ask for a jury trial. Tony Taylor, currently not in custody, was to have been tried on May 7.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailypress.com/news/local/southofjames/dp-news_vick_1128nov28,0,1715868,print.story ]{{dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trials of all four, however, were pushed back until Vick, Peace, and Philips were released from prison, because of costs associated with transportation to Virginia state courts (Taylor's trial is also delayed until the other defendants have finished their prison terms).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailypress.com/news/local/southofjames/dp-now-vicktrial.m13,0,2847166.story |publisher=Daily Press |accessdate=2008-03-21 |date=2008-03-12 |author=Mike Holtzclaw and Veronica Gorley Chufo |title=Vick's trial in Surry County is postponed |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318014837/http://www.dailypress.com/news/local/southofjames/dp-now-vicktrial.m13%2C0%2C2847166.story |archivedate=March 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vick, the last to plead guilty to federal charges, pleaded guilty to state charges on November 25, 2008, paying a $2,500 fine as a result and court fees.&lt;ref name=P4&gt;[http://www.ajc.com/sports/content/sports/falcons/stories/2008/11/24/vick_virginia_court.html Vick to enter guilty plea in Va. court Tuesday] (November 25, 2008), [[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]], accessed 2008-11-25&lt;/ref&gt; The fine would only be paid if Vick fails to stay out of trouble for four years.

Michael Vick pleaded guilty to dog fighting on November 25, 2008 and received a three-year suspended sentence and was ordered to pay restitution of $3,636.97.

==Disposition of dogs==

As of October 2, 2007, the 127 dogs which were seized in April remained in animal shelters in Hampton Roads and central Virginia. An ASPCA evaluation showed that one animal, identified as #2621, was aggressive to the point the evaluation could not be completed and it has a history of biting people. U.S. District Judge Henry Hudson ordered that it be euthanized. However, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Richmond announced in court filings that the other 48 canines may be safe enough to place in the community with strict conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Patrick |last=Terpstra |title=Judge orders Vick dog to be euthanized |date=2007-10-02 |place=Norfolk, VA |publisher=WVEC Television |url= http://www.wvec.com/news/topstories/stories/wvec_local_100207_vick_dog_euthanized.12efbb8bc.html |accessdate=2007-11-07 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071112191045/http://www.wvec.com/news/topstories/stories/wvec_local_100207_vick_dog_euthanized.12efbb8bc.html |archivedate= 2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 16, Hudson acted on a government motion requesting animal law expert Rebecca J. Huss, who is a Professor of Law at [[Valparaiso University]] School of Law in Indiana, to serve as the guardian-special master to oversee the possible placement of the 48 dogs, or their euthanasia. The judge also granted a request by the U.S. attorney's office that each of the pit bulls be spayed or neutered and have microchips implanted. In a statement released by Valparaiso University, she said: "As someone whose academic endeavors focus on the legal status and value of animals in our lives, I am honored to represent the interests of those at the heart of this case, the dogs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dogs in Vick case to be spayed, neutered |publisher=MS-NBC |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21333877/ |accessdate = 2007-11-07 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071118154342/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21333877/|archivedate=18 November 2007 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, Vick was observed to be liquidating some of his real estate assets, notably the dog-fighting estate property near [[Smithfield, Virginia|Smithfield]], [[Virginia]] and one of his multimillion-dollar homes which are located in [[Suffolk, Virginia|Suffolk]], [[Virginia]], near [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and the [[South Beach]] section of [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]], [[Florida]]. ESPN reported on October 20 that the one near Atlanta was listed for sale at a $4.5 million asking price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3071572 |title=Vick hoping to get $4.5 million for sale of lakefront Georgia home |website=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2007-10-20 |accessdate=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the request of federal authorities before his sentencing in federal court, he agreed to deposit nearly $1 million in an escrow account with attorneys for use to reimburse costs of caring for the confiscated dogs, most of which are now being offered for adoption on a selective basis under supervision of a court-appointed specialist. Experts say some of the animals will require individual care for the rest of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21333877/ |title=Dogs to be spayed and neutered|accessdate = 2007-11-07 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071118154342/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21333877/| archivedate= 18 November 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 8, 2008 an article was published by the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reporting on the status of the dogs. At the time of the article, two of the seized dogs had been [[euthanized]] - one for aggression, as mentioned previously, and one due to health problems. Of the 47 remaining dogs, 22 were sent to an animal sanctuary at the [[Best Friends Animal Society]] in Utah because of aggression toward other dogs, and 25 were placed in foster care. Several of the latter have been adopted. The dogs and therapists were featured in a ''[[DogTown]]'' episode entitled "DogTown: Saving the Michael Vick Dogs" on the National Geographic Channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/06/AR2008070602351.html |title=Saving Michael Vick's Dogs - washingtonpost.com|accessdate = 2008-07-08 | work=The Washington Post | first=Brigid | last=Schulte | date=July 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A program on WHYY on 20 September 2010 covered the disposition of the Michael Vick dogs. One of the participants in the program was Jim Gorant who has written a book about the dogs called ''The Lost Dogs: Michael Vick's Dogs and Their Tale of Rescue and Redemption''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129989424 |title=The Road To Recovery For Michael Vick's Dogs - npr.org|accessdate = 2010-09-27 | work=Fresh Air | date=September 20, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100922193733/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129989424| archivedate= 22 September 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defenders of Vick==
Numerous athletes generated additional controversy by making public comments supporting and defending Vick. [[Stephon Marbury]], a point guard for the [[Boston Celtics]], called dogfighting a sport and compared it to hunting and said that we don't react the same when other animals die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Basketball/NBA/2007/08/22/4438575-ap.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070825073514/http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Basketball/NBA/2007/08/22/4438575-ap.html |archivedate=2007-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Jones Jr.]], a prominent boxer, stated, "really two dogs fighting can happen in anyone's backyard or on the street. It happened in my backyard, two of my dogs fought and one died." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.aol.com/fanhouse/2007/07/03/roy-jones-defends-michael-vick/ |title=Sports News &amp; latest headlines from AOL |website=Sports.aol.com |date=2016-07-27 |accessdate=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clinton Portis]], a star running back on the [[Washington Redskins]], stated, "I don't know if he was fighting dogs or not, but it's his property, it's his dog. If that's what he wants to do, do it. I think people should mind their own business." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.netscape.com/story/2007/05/21/clinton-portis-defends-michael-vick-and-dog-fighting/ |title=News, Sports, Weather, Entertainment, Local &amp; Lifestyle - AOL |website=Sports.netscape.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Deion Sanders]], a former star football and baseball player and current commentator for CBS Sports, stated, "Why are we indicting him? Was he the ringleader? Is he the big fish? Or is there someone else? The fights allegedly occurred at a property that he purchased for a family member. They apparently found carcasses on the property, but I must ask you again, is he the ringleader? This situation reminds me of a scene in the movie ''[[New Jack City]]'' when drug dealer Nino Brown is on the witness stand and eloquently says, 'This thing is bigger than me.' Are we using Vick to get to the ringleader? Are we using him to bring an end to dogfighting in the United States? The only thing I can gather from this situation is that we're using Vick." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballtalk.com/rumormill.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925151839/http://www.profootballtalk.com/rumormill.htm |archivedate=2007-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public comments about dogfighting, animal abuse==
During the furor arising around the Bad Newz Kennels investigation and prosecutions, even such diverse notables as hip-hop mogul [[Russell Simmons]] and the Reverend [[Al Sharpton]] joined with the [[Humane Society of the United States]] (HSUS) and [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] - People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals in calling for strong stands against animal cruelty, jointly stating:

::"Today, we sound a clarion call to all people: Stand up for what is right, and speak out against what is wrong. Dogfighting is unacceptable. Hurting animals for human pleasure or gain is despicable. Cruelty is just plain wrong." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.localtechwire.com/sports/football/nfl/story/1608124/] {{dead link|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Major League Baseball]] pitcher [[Mark Buehrle]] of the [[Chicago White Sox]] commented that he hoped Vick would get injured after he was reinstated to football. Buehrle, an animal rights activist, told [[MLB.com]] "he had a great year and a great comeback, but there were times where we watched the game, and I know it's bad to say, but there were times where we hope he gets hurt...everything you've done to these dogs, something bad needs to happen to these guys." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/chicago/mlb/news/story?id=6108605 |title=Chicago White Sox's Mark Buehrle hoped for a Michael Vick injury at times during 2010 season |website=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2011-02-10 |accessdate=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endorsements and products==
Companies employing Vick for endorsements and producing or selling Vick-related products apparently reacted to the negative publicity soon after the federal indictments. According to the ''Norfolk Virginian-Pilot'', [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] was Vick's biggest endorsement deal. The company initially announced in July that it had "suspended Michael Vick's contract without pay, and will not sell any more Michael Vick product at Nike owned retail at this time." although the company said it had not terminated the contract, apparently waiting for a guilty plea or a conviction to do so, as animal-rights activists had urged the company to do. However, Nike also announced it was suspending the release of the Zoom Vick V, a new line of shoes. On August 24, hours after details of Vick's guilt plea and statement of facts were made public, Nike announced it was completely terminating its relationship with him.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/07/27/ap3962325.html] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adidas]] announced its [[Reebok]] division would stop selling Vick football jerseys. The NFL said it had pulled all Vick-related items from [[NFLShop.com]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated16&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-vick28jul28,0,3541076.story?coll=la-home-sports |work=The Los Angeles Times |title=It will be difficult to find a Vick jersey |first=Sam |last=Farmer |date=July 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trading card companies including [[Donruss]] and [[Upper Deck]] soon followed with similar actions. St. Louis-based sporting goods manufacturer [[Rawlings (company)|Rawlings]], which used Vick's likeness to sell merchandise and modeled a football using his name, ended its relationship. The same day, the ''Atlanta Journal-Constitution'' reported that [[Dick's Sporting Goods]] and [[Sports Authority]] stores have also stopped selling Vick-related goods.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/content/sports/falcons/stories/2007/07/31/0801_rawlings.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604104006/http://www.ajc.com/news/content/sports/falcons/stories/2007/07/31/0801_rawlings.html |archivedate=2011-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some fans of the Atlanta Falcons donated their Vick-related jerseys and shirts to the Atlanta Humane Society for use as animal bedding and cleaning rags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsbtv.com/news/news/vick-jerseys-being-used-to-clean-kennels/nFCnb/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140121111711/http://www.wsbtv.com/news/news/vick-jerseys-being-used-to-clean-kennels/nFCnb/ |archivedate=2014-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others produced dog chew toys in Vick's effigy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialvickdogchewtoy.com/ |title=パソコンデータの喪失危機！｜復旧業者の力でビジネスの危機を回避！ |website=vickdogchewtoy.com/ |date= |accessdate=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Nike re-signed Michael Vick to an endorsement deal, and in early 2015 Vick confirmed reports that his signature line of Nike sneakers would be returning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/Nike-re-signs-Michael-Vick-to-endorsement-deal-four-years-after-dropping-him-070111 |title=Nike re-signs Michael Vick to endorsement deal four years after dropping him |publisher=FOX Sports |date=2011-07-01 |accessdate=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://solecollector.com/news/michael-vick-confirms-nike-zoom-vick-ii-re-release/ |title='Falcons' Colorway Coming for Nike Zoom Vick 2 Retro |publisher=Sole Collector |date=2015-01-01 |accessdate=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Battle of Aleppo''' ({{lang-ar|معركة حلب}}) was a major military confrontation in [[Aleppo]], the largest city in [[Syria]], between the [[Syrian opposition]] (including the [[Free Syrian Army]] (FSA) and other largely-[[Sunni]] groups, such as the [[Levant Front]] and the [[al-Qaeda]]-affiliated [[al-Nusra Front]])&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-37008100 Syria war: Why the battle for Aleppo matters]".

== Background ==
{{Main|Syrian Civil War}}
In 2011, [[Aleppo]] was [[Syria]]'s largest city, with a population of 2.5 million people. A [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], it has been described by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' as Syria's commercial capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brief History of Aleppo: A Great World City Now in the Grip of War|url=http://world.time.com/2012/07/27/brief-history-of-aleppo-a-great-world-city-now-in-the-grip-of-war/|publisher=Time|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Diana Darke]] has written that "The city has long been multi-cultural, a complex mix of Kurds, Iranians, Turkmen, Armenians and Circassians overlaid on an Arab base in which multi-denominational churches and mosques still share the space."&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk 2016-07-22"&gt;Diana Darke "[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-36853689 Aleppo: Is besieged Syrian city facing last gasp?]" BBC 22 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Nationwide protests against President [[Bashar al-Assad]] began on 15 March 2011, as part of the [[Arab Spring]]. In Aleppo itself, large protests started more than a year later in May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://nytimes.com/2012/05/18/world/middleeast/protesters-set-upon-at-aleppo-university-despite-monitors.html Students Are Assailed at a Protest in Syria]" ''The New York Times'' 17 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, government-organized rallies in support of itself also occurred.&lt;ref name="GP"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/middle-east/110624/syria-protests-assad |title=Syria: What motivates an Assad supporter? |work=Global Post |date=24 June 2011 |accessdate=22 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aleppo had remained undisturbed and largely supportive of the government&lt;ref name="FPRI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpri.org/article/2013/03/syrian-druze-toward-defiant-neutrality/|title=Syrian Druze: Toward Defiant Neutrality|first=Gary C.|last=Gambill|date=11 March 2013|publisher=Foreign Policy Research Institute|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/21/syrian-rebels-aleppo-local-hostility |title=Syrian rebels fight on for Aleppo despite local wariness |work=The Guardian |date=21 August 2012 |accessdate=8 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by the 16-month-long conflict until 22 July 2012, when rebel fighters from the neighboring villages converged and penetrated into it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Syrian rebels fight Assad troops in Aleppo|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/22/syrian-rebels-fight-aleppo|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to which the government responded with heavy-handed, indiscriminate bombardments of the city.&lt;ref name="FPRI"/&gt; On 16 February 2012, the [[UN General Assembly]] issued a resolution with a vote of 137 in favour, 12 against, and 17 abstentions, and called on Syria "to immediately put an end to all human rights violations and attacks against civilians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Assembly demands Syria halt violence without delay|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=41265#.WFVNuNLNzIU|publisher=UN News Centre|date=16 February 2012|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By December, rebel fighters were commonly looting for supplies; they switched their loyalties to groups that had more to share. This new approach led to the killing of at least one rebel commander following a dispute; fighters retreating with their loot caused the loss of a frontline position and the failure of an attack on a Kurdish neighborhood. The looting cost the rebel fighters much popular support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Syrian rebels sidetracked by scramble for spoils of war|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/27/syrian-rebels-scramble-spoils-war|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2016, it was estimated that the population of rebel-held Eastern Aleppo had been reduced to 300,000,&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk 2016-07-22"/&gt; while 1.5 million were living in government-held Western Aleppo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/08/battles-rage-across-aleppo-as-assad-regime-syria-fights-to-quash-rebels |title=Battles rage across Aleppo as Assad regime fights to quell rebels|author=Kareem Shaheen |date=8 August 2016|work=Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early February 2016, Syrian government forces and their allies broke a three-year rebel siege of two Shi'ite towns of [[Nubl]] and [[Al-Zahraa|Zahraa]], cutting off a main insurgent route to nearby Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-aleppo-idUSKCN0VC1VQ|title=Syrian army and allies breaks rebel siege of Shi'ite towns: army|author=Laila Bassam|date=4 February 2016|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 February, the towns of [[Mayer, Syria|Mayer]] and [[Kafr Naya]] were recaptured by government forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-captures-mayir-and-kafr-naya-in-new-northern-aleppo-offensive-map-update/|title=Syrian Army captures Mayir and Kafr Naya in new northern Aleppo offensive - Map update |author=Chris Tomson|date=4 February 2016|work=Al-Masdar News}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 February, the government captured the village of [[Ratyan]], to the northwest of Aleppo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-hezbollah-capture-the-strategic-village-of-rityan-in-northern-aleppo/|title=Syrian Army, Hezbollah capture the strategic village of Rityan in northern Aleppo|author=Leith Fadel|date=5 February 2016 |work=Al-Masdar News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 June, the Syrian Army and allied forces began their long-awaited North-west Aleppo offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/tiger-forces-begin-long-awaited-northern-aleppo-offensive/|title=Syrian Army begins North west Aleppo offensive|work=Al Masdar News|date=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate goal of the offensive was to cut off the Castello highway, which would cut off the last supply route for rebels inside the city, thus fully encircling remaining opposition forces.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk 2016-07-22"/&gt;

By late July, Syrian government forces had managed to sever the last rebel supply line coming from the north, and completely surrounded Aleppo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-mideast-crisis-syria-aleppo-idUKKCN1071FO |title=Syrian army says cut off all supply routes into east Aleppo |website= Reuters|access-date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, within days, the rebels launched a large-scale counterattack south of Aleppo, in an attempt to both open a new supply line into rebel-held parts of the city and cut-off the government-held side.

After a week of heavy fighting, rebels both inside and outside Aleppo advanced into the Ramouseh neighborhood, linked up and captured it, while also seizing the Al-Ramousah Military Academy.

Later that week they recaptured the Ramouseh district and reversed almost all rebel gains made since 30 July. The Syrian Government forces then [[Aleppo offensive (September–October 2016)|started an offensive]] to capture eastern Aleppo on 22 September, taking 15–20% of the rebel-held part of Aleppo.

Rebels started [[Aleppo offensive (October–November 2016)|an attack on western Aleppo]] in late October, which failed, with government forces retaking areas in the south-west that they had lost to the rebel's late July offensive. The Syrian Army then [[Aleppo offensive (November–December 2016)|launched an offensive]], aimed at finishing rebel-held Aleppo once and for all, during which they captured the Hanano district, Sakhour district, Jabal Badro district, Bustan al-Basha district, Hellok district, Sheikh Kheder district, Sheikh Fares district Haydariyah district, Ayn al-Tal industrial district and reportedly the research housing south of Jabal Badro. They also captured the Ard' Al Hamra district, reportedly cutting rebel-held territory in Aleppo by 40–45%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/complete-battlefield-update-east-aleppo-map/|title=Complete battlefield update from east Aleppo: map|first=Leith|last=Fadel|date=28 November 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

On 22 February 2018, it was reported that the [[YPG]] had agreed to hand over eastern districts of Aleppo city to the Syrian government. According to Syrian state television, this decision was made to reinforce positions around the [[Afrin Region|region of Afrin]], and to halt [[Turkish military operation in Afrin|Turkey's offensive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.plenglish.com/index.php?o=rn&amp;id=24863&amp;SEO=kurdish-militia-ypg-to-deliver-syrian-army-neighborhoods-in-aleppo|title=Kurdish Militia YPG to Hand Over Syrian Army Neighborhoods in Aleppo|work=prensa-latina.cu|access-date=22 February 2018|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; This came days after pro-Syrian regime fighters agreed to bolster the Kurdish forces in the northwest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-43131600|title=Syrian pro-government forces enter Afrin|date=20 February 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=22 February 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rebel forces expanded into the countryside south of Aleppo to control sections of the M4 and M5 highways, effectively blocking ground reinforcements for the Syrian Army.

The Syrian government's defeat at the [[Second Battle of Idlib]] in late March 2015, which helped expand the influence of the al-Nusra Front, forced the Islamic State ([[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|IS]]) to expand its attacks in central Syria after it failed to block the Raqqa highway that branches out to the Syrian army's main supply route to Aleppo along the Khanasir-Athriya road.

This reduced the forces available to try to lift the siege of Aleppo, ensuring its fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sayigh|first=Yezid|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-38473702|title=Ceasefire in Syria: Turkish policy sets Syria on new path|publisher=BBC News|date=30 December 2016|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

==Casualties==
[[File:Syria- two years of tragedy (8642756918).jpg|thumb|Aleppo, Karm al Jabal neighborhood, 2013]]
With over four years of fighting, the battle of Aleppo represents one of the [[List of sieges|longest sieges]] in modern warfare, which left an estimated 31,183 people dead,&lt;ref name=vdc/&gt; almost a tenth of the overall Syrian war casualties. The [[Violations Documentation Center in Syria]] assessed the death toll. According to its records, between 19 July 2012 and 15 December 2016 there were 22,633 adult male deaths (73%), 2,849 adult female deaths (9.2%), 3,773 child male deaths (12.2%) and 1,775 child female deaths (5.7%). 23,604 or 76% of all fatalities were civilians, while only 7,406 or 24% were military deaths. Causes of death were explosions (910 deaths), shelling (6,384 deaths), [[summary execution|field execution]] (1,549 deaths), [[shooting]] (9,438 deaths), warplane bombardment (11,233 deaths), chemical and toxic gas attacks (46 deaths) and others.&lt;ref name=vdc/&gt;

The pro-opposition monitoring group the [[Syrian Observatory for Human Rights]] (SOHR) gave a similar number: it registered that 1,612 days of fighting for Aleppo left 21,452 civilians dead. Among them were 5,261 children under the age of 18 and 2,777 women over the age of 18.&lt;ref name=1600days/&gt;

The [[Syrian Network for Human Rights]] (SNHR), a pro-opposition non-governmental organization, reported that the Russian bombardments killed at least 1,640 civilians in the Aleppo area: 1,178 civilians died between 30 September 2015 and 1 August 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2704 Civilians, including 746 Children, have been killed by the Russian Forces | url=http://sn4hr.org/wp-content/pdf/english/2704_civilians_killed_by_Russian_forces_en.pdf | page=4 |date=17 August 2016| publisher=Syrian Network for Human Rights |accessdate= 1 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while additional 462 civilians were killed from 19 September 2016 until 30 November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UN has to Ensure the Safety and Fate of IDPs from Aleppo's Eastern Neighborhoods | url=http://sn4hr.org/blog/2016/11/30/29832/ |date=30 November 2016| publisher=[[Syrian Network for Human Rights]] |accessdate= 1 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) has described the fighting as one of the most devastating conflicts in modern times. It appealed: "The human cost of the fighting in Aleppo is simply too high. We urge all parties to stop the destruction and indiscriminate attacks, and stop the killing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.icrc.org/en/document/syria-news-cities-aleppo-one-most-devastating-urban-conflicts |title=Syria: Aleppo "One of the most devastating urban conflicts in modern times" |publisher=[[The International Committee of the Red Cross]]|date= 15 August 2016 |accessdate= 15 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICRC also said that hundreds of civilians perished through the "indiscriminate shelling of residential areas across Aleppo".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Syria: Aleppo civilians under attack |url=https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/news-release/2014/04-22-syria-damascus-aleppo-violence-civilians.htm|publisher=[[The International Committee of the Red Cross]]|date= 22 April 2014 |accessdate= 15 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several infectious diseases broke out in Aleppo and other areas in Syria during the civil war, including [[poliomyelitis]], [[measles]] and [[cutaneous leishmaniasis]].&lt;ref name="ShararaKanj2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sharara|first=Sima L.|author2=Souha S.

On 19 September 2016, a UN/[[Syrian Arab Red Crescent]] (SARC) [[September 2016 Urum al-Kubra Aid Convoy attack|aid convoy was attacked at night]], as well as a SARC warehouse and health clinic in Urum al-Kubra, a rebel-held town 12&amp;nbsp;km west of Aleppo. 20 civilians and one SARC staff member were killed, while food and medical aid, intended to reach Aleppo, was destroyed. Some witnesses on the ground at the time of the attack said they had heard helicopters during the attack. The United States accused Russian or Syrian government warplanes of perpetrating the attack, while Russia rejected the accusation.

[[UN High Commissioner For Human Rights]] [[Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein]] stated that their use was "totally unacceptable" and constituted indiscriminate attacks as they were very difficult to aim correctly, frequently killing and maiming civilians in government-held areas. According to Zeid, their inaccuracy means they had no military purpose so he concluded their use was primarily to "terrorize the inhabitants of western Aleppo".&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=55201#.WAZoEvkrLIV Aleppo demands ‘bold action,’ including limiting use of Security Council veto – UN rights chief]", UN News Centre, 10 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Syrian Observatory for Human Rights]] reported in December 2014 that between July and December 2014 the rebels killed 204 civilians using hell cannons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-attacks-idUSKBN0JQ17I20141212 "Syrian rebel 'hell cannons' kill 300 civilians: monitoring group"], [[Reuters]], 12 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor of Law [[Mark A.

It noted, however, that the destruction was mostly concentrated in the rebel-held part of the city: about 70 to 80 percent of the destruction was in the east. UN satellite images determined more than 33,500 damaged residential buildings in the city, most of them multi-[[apartment block]]s. The costs of reconstruction were estimated at between $35–40 billion.&lt;ref name="Washington Post 33500"&gt;{{cite news|title=Aleppo confronts vast destruction left by 4 years of war|publisher=Washington Post|agency=Associated Press|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/aleppo-confronts-vast-destruction-left-by-4-years-of-war/2016/12/23/e20e8670-c8da-11e6-acda-59924caa2450_story.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224165001/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/aleppo-confronts-vast-destruction-left-by-4-years-of-war/2016/12/23/e20e8670-c8da-11e6-acda-59924caa2450_story.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=24 December 2016|first=Karin|last=Laub|date=23 December 2016|accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Hakam Shaar and Robert Templer proposed that the deliberate destruction of Aleppo was a form of "[[urbicide]]".&lt;ref name="Aleppo Elegy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Urbicide or an Elegy for Aleppo| url=https://www.academia.edu/29782378/Urbicide_OR_AN_ELEGY_FOR_ALEPPO |author=Al-Hakam Shaar, Robert Templer |publisher=academia.edu |page=109 |accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==
===Media coverage===

The coverage of the siege of Aleppo in the Western media emphasised the suffering of civilians and often contained graphic pictures of injured and dying children. As the were almost no international journalists there, the reporting was outsourced to local activists linked to the rebels who held the city. This was significantly different from the news coverage of the sieges of [[Battle of Raqqa (2017)|Raqqa]] and Mosul carried out by the [[Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve|Coalition]] forces, where the civilian losses were downplayed.&lt;ref&gt;[[London Review of Books]], [https://www.lrb.co.uk/v40/n14/patrick-cockburn/the-war-in-five-sieges The War in Five Sieges], Vol. 40 No. 14 · 19 July 2018

=== Domestic reaction ===
The Syrian President, [[Bashar al-Assad]], said on the occasion of the 67th Anniversary of the Syrian Arab Army in August 2012, "the army is engaged in a crucial and heroic battle&amp;nbsp;... on which the destiny of the nation and its people rests&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Syria army in 'crucial and heroic battle', says Bashar al-Assad |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/9443296/Syria-army-in-crucial-and-heroic-battle-says-Bashar-al-Assad.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=1 August 2012 |accessdate=23 September 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; After gaining nearly complete control of eastern Aleppo, Assad referred to this success as an "important point in history of Syria".

A May 2017 ''[[The New York Times Magazine|New York Times Magazine]]'' report from "Aleppo after the Fall" described the public experience in formerly rebel controlled East Aleppo as "a chaotic wasteland full of feuding militias—some of them radical Islamists—who hoarded food and weapons while the people starved" and quoted local sources as "no one is 100 percent with the regime, but mostly these people are unified by their resistance to the opposition" and people having experienced "a rebellion that is corrupt, brutal and compromised by foreign sponsors".&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

=== Foreign reactions ===
* In October and December 2016, the UN held a "Security Council Emergency Briefing on Syria" to discuss the situation in Aleppo. However, no agreement was reached. The United States Ambassador to the United Nations, [[Samantha Power]] criticized the Syrian government, Russia and Iran, in a speech at the briefing, stating "to the Assad regime, Russia, and Iran—three Member States behind the conquest of and carnage in Aleppo—you bear responsibility for these atrocities." Comparing the situation in Aleppo to the mass killings in [[Halabja chemical attack|Halabja]], [[Rwandan Genocide|Rwanda]] and [[Srebrenica Massacre|Srebrenica]], she addressed the Syrian, Russian and Iranian governments, asking them  "are you truly incapable of shame?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/dec/14/are-you-incapable-of-shame-samantha-power-criticises-syria-iran-and-russia-video|title='Are you incapable of shame?': Samantha Power criticises Syria, Iran and Russia over Aleppo – video|first=Source:|last=Reuters|date=13 December 2016|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/samantha-power-russia-assad-aleppo-2016-12|title='Is there literally nothing that can shame you?': US ambassador Power attacks Russia, Assad over 'crimes' in Aleppo|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2016/12/14/samantha-power-denounces-syria-and-russia-over-alleged-war-crimes-in-aleppo/|title=Samantha Power denounces Syria and Russia over alleged war crimes in Aleppo|date=14 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; UN humanitarian chief [[Stephen O'Brien]] appealed to the Security Council to stop the bombardment of eastern Aleppo, describing residents "scrabbling with their bare hands in the street above to reach under concrete rubble trying to reach their young child screaming unseen in the dust and dirt below their feet". The Russian ambassador, [[Vitaly Churkin]], dismissed his speech, saying: "If I wanted to be preached at, I'd go to church".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/26/aleppo-bombings-syria-un-stephen-obrien-vitaly-churkin|title=UN chief calls security council's failure on Aleppo 'our generation's shame'|publisher=The Guardian|date=27 October 2016|author=[[Julian Borger]]|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At an EU summit in December 2016, German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] said that Russia and Iran were responsible "for crimes committed against the Syrian population" by the Assad government and that these should not go unpunished. The US secretary of State [[John Kerry]] also said that "there is absolutely no justification whatsoever for the indiscriminate and savage brutality against civilians shown by the regime and by its Russian and Iranian allies over the past few weeks, or indeed over the past five years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/kerry-aleppo-onslaught-nothing-short-of-a-massacre/a-36789428|title=Kerry: Aleppo onslaught 'nothing short of a massacre'|first=|last=|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs (France)|French Foreign Ministry]] said, "With the build-up of heavy weapons around Aleppo, Assad is preparing to carry out a fresh slaughter of his own people". Italy and the UN peacekeeping chief also accused the Syrian government of preparing to massacre civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/07/27/228747.html |title=Red Cross to pull some staff out of Syria as world powers fear Aleppo 'slaughter' |date=27 July 2012 |publisher=Al Arabiya |accessdate=29 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729020633/http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/07/27/228747.html |archive-date=29 July 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* As the Battle of Aleppo started, [[Saeed Jalili]], the head of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, met with Assad in Damascus. Jalili said Iran would help Assad to confront "attempts at blatant foreign interference" in Syria's internal affairs, saying, "Iran will not allow the axis of resistance, of which it considers Syria to be an essential part, to be broken in any way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Babak Dehghanpisheh and [[Liz Sly]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/syrias-bashar-al-assad-makes-rare-appearance-with-visiting-iranian/2012/08/07/614c2836-e094-11e1-8fc5-a7dcf1fc161d_story.html |title=Iran pledges support for Syria as battle rages for Aleppo |publisher=Washington Post|date=7 August 2012 |accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Tehran sermon on 16 December 2016, Ayatollah [[Mohammad Emami Kashani]] praised the "Aleppo triumph" as a "defeat of the infidels".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Iran sermon: Muslims defeated 'infidels' in Aleppo |publisher=alarabiya.net |url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2016/12/17/Iran-sermon-Muslims-defeated-the-infidels-in-Aleppo.html|date= 16 December 2016 |accessdate= 18 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Iranian reformist and former director of Western Asian affairs in the [[Iranian Foreign Ministry]], [[Mir-Hossein Mousavi]], said that he cannot applaud at what happened in Aleppo, concluding it is "nothing but a two nights' joy and Tehran will be worrying for the next 30 years about it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Iranian reformist diplomat: Iran will reap what it sows |publisher=alarabiya.net |url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2016/12/14/Iranian-reformist-diplomat-Iran-will-reap-what-it-sows.html|date= 14 December 2016 |accessdate= 18 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Russian Foreign Ministry issued an official statement condemning the bombing that occurred on 9 September 2012, in which more than 30 people were killed.

=== Protests in solidarity with anti-government forces in Aleppo ===
Rallies and demonstrations intended to show solidarity with Aleppo's besieged civilians, as well as protests against Syrian government and its Iranian and Russian allies, were held in several cities across the world, organized by numerous groups.

[[File:Blessing of the Fleet, Port Adelaide.jpg|thumb|Blessing of the Fleet procession, [[Port Adelaide]], [[South Australia]], 2015]]
The '''Blessing of the Fleet''' is a tradition that began centuries ago in Mediterranean fishing communities. The practice began predominantly [[Catholic]], but is now practiced by all [[Christian]]s as a blessing from the local priest and pastors that is meant to ensure a safe and bountiful season.

In most ports, the event was brought by immigrants who held strongly to their Christian religious beliefs. The events that are part of the ritual vary by community and range from a simple ceremony to a multi-day festival including a [[church service]], Parades, [[Procession|Pageantry]], Dancing, Feasting, and Contests.

==Australia==
Most states of Australia have had ports and fishing community traditions of blessing the fleet &lt;ref&gt;[[Port Fairy, Victoria]], 1940s: {{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article64398126 |title=Blessing the Fleet |newspaper=[[Portland Guardian]] |location=Vic. |date=14 November 1940 |accessdate=20 November 2012 |page=2 Edition: EVENING |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Queenscliff, Victoria]], 1950s: {{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article23216469 |title=Fleet blessing tomorrow. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=27 December 1952 |accessdate=20 November 2012 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley, Tasmania]], 1950s: {{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article69884640 |title=Blessing the Fleet |newspaper=[[The Advocate (Tasmania)|The Advocate]] |location=Burnie, Tas. |date=2 February 1954 |accessdate=20 November 2012 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ulladulla, New South Wales]] {{Citation | author1=McClelland, James | author2=James McClelland Research | title=A history of the mid south coast of N.S.W. : Milton-Ulladulla-Mollymook surrounding areas and the blessing of the fleet festival | publication-date=1984 | publisher=James McClelland Research | isbn=978-0-908492-38-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
The tradition of the blessing of the fleet is spread along the eastern seaboard &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Wilkinson, Alec | title=The blessing of the fleet. (Provincetown) |magazine=The New Yorker | publication-date=1986-06-09 | publisher=Condé Nast Publications, Inc | volume=62 | pages=88 | issn=0028-792X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Leighton, Clare | title=Where land meets sea : the tide line of Cape Cod | publication-date=1954 | publisher=Rinehart | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/11516875 | accessdate=20 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Great Lakes region.

===Biloxi/Gulf Coast===
Annual Blessing of the Fleet festivals are held throughout communities all along the Gulf Coast; each year boats parade down local waters to receive the blessing of the priest before the opening of the shrimp season. The shrimping industry has a long history in the area and has
become intrinsically tied to local individual and community identities. [https://www.gulfcoast.org/event/88th-annual-blessing-of-the-fleet-%26-fais-do-do/6086/ 88th Annual Blessing of the Fleet]

===Brunswick===
Portuguese [[immigrants]] introduced the event to their new home in [[Brunswick, Georgia]], around the time of World War II, more than sixty years ago. The blessing is held on [[Mother's Day (United States)|Mother's Day]] to honor [[Our Lady of Fatima]], the patron saint of Portugal, and mothers in the parish. The event begins with a morning mass and the ceremonial "May crowning" of the statue of Our Lady of Fatima, followed by a parishioners parade around Hanover Square, adjacent to the church. The procession is led by a [[Knights of Columbus]] honor guard and 8 men carrying the statue. The statue’s base is decorated with ferns and fresh red (for living mothers) and white (for deceased mothers) flowers. An anchor made of red and white flowers is also placed at the statue’s base.
 
The celebration then moves to the waterfront, where shrimp [[commercial trawler|trawlers]], freshly painted and decorated, circle the waterfront. The "working" boats are usually matched by an equal number of recreational watercraft.

The priest from St. Francis and the Knights of Columbus [[honor guard]] board one of the boats and the priest sprinkles [[Holy water]] and blesses each boat as it passes by. During the procession, the boats are judged on their decorations, with prizes awarded to the best.
After the last boat has been blessed, the boats move up the East River to St. Simons Sound, where the flower anchor is laid upon the water in memory of the local fishermen who perished at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-542 |title=Blessing of the Fleet &amp;#124; New Georgia Encyclopedia |publisher=Georgiaencyclopedia.org |date= |accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Darien===
[[Darien, Georgia]], has held an annual blessing since 1968. The blessing is held on the [[Darien River (Georgia)|Darien River]] on a Sunday afternoon each spring, but the date varies. It is scheduled to coincide with a falling [[tide]] because a rising tide could drive the boats into the bridge—a reminder that they are always at the mercy of the weather. The celebration in Darien begins early in the week with activities that include an evening prayer service, a fishermen's fish fry, and a three-day festival with arts &amp; crafts, food vendors, lots of families and kid-oriented events, live entertainment and fireworks on Saturday night. Local clerics of various [[Christian denomination|denominations]] stand ready on the Darien bridge to bless the boats which then turnaround and move down the Darien River and back into the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] to begin the Spring [[Shrimp fishery|shrimping]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blessingofthefleet.com/|title=blessingofthefleet|website=blessingofthefleet|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jacksonville===
The celebration in [[Jacksonville, Florida]] is a simple ceremony that was first held in 1985. While it is held on [[Palm Sunday]], and an [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodox]] priest does the blessings, it is a fun, festive boat parade. Some of the participants go overboard with their decorations. Typically, more than 150 vessels participate in the Blessing, ranging from ships to kayaks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.10best.com/Jacksonville/annualEvents.html?ID=6194 ]{{dead link|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://coastalcompanion.com/2007/12/28/24th-annual-blessing-of-the-fleet-jacksonville-florida/ |title=24th Annual Blessing of the Fleet – Jacksonville, Florida |publisher=Coastal Companion |date=2007-12-28 |accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coj.net/Departments/Recreation+and+Community+Services/Special+Events/Blessing+of+the+Fleet/default.htm ]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519012934/http://www.coj.net/Departments/Recreation%2Band%2BCommunity%2BServices/Special%2BEvents/Blessing%2Bof%2Bthe%2BFleet/default.htm |date=May 19, 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This event has also been commemorated in [[St. Augustine, Florida]] since 1946.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sayc2000.com/YachtClubBlessing2012.pdf ]{{dead link|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===McClellanville===
[[McClellanville, South Carolina|McClellanville, SC]] has held The Lowcountry Shrimp Festival and Blessing of the Fleet annually since 1976. The event is held at the fishing community’s Municipal Landing on Jeremy Creek in McClellanville the first Saturday of May each year. The Blessing of the Fleet ceremony is an age-old tradition in which boats parade past the dock where the local clergy pray for a safe and bountiful season. As the clergy give their blessing a beautiful Magnolia Wreath covered with Red Roses is tossed into the water in memory of and to honor McClellanville fishermen. This is typically the time of year the boats are preparing for the opening of the season and are freshly painted, cleaned up and looking their best.  The boats decorate for the festival and are usually loaded with people who love to ride in the parade, which is quite picturesque. The remainder of the day is filled with family entertainment, children’s games and local seafood dishes, such as boiled and fried shrimp dinners, shrimp kabobs, frog more stew, clam chowder, fish stew, barbecue and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lowcountryshrimpfestival.com/|title=Lowcountry Shrimp Festival in McClellanville, SC|website=lowcountryshrimpfestival.com|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mount Pleasant===
The annual Blessing of the Fleet &amp; Seafood Festival in [[Mount Pleasant, South Carolina|Mount Pleasant, SC]] pays tribute to local shrimping and fishing industry, offering a boat parade, live music, craft show and lots of free activities with the picturesque Ravenel Bridge and Charleston Harbor for a backdrop! The festival is held on the last Sunday in April every year. Continuing the tradition begun by the Magwood family, local shrimpers who started the festival in 1988, every year the net proceeds from the festival have been donated to local nonprofit organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.comeonovermp.com/index.aspx?NID=111|title=Mount Pleasant Tourism &amp; Marketing, SC - Blessing of the Fleet &amp; Seafood Festival|website=www.comeonovermp.com|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Washington, D.C.===
The Blessing of the Fleet in the nation's capital is one of the premier events of the region's boating season.  Held in the Spring along [[Washington, D.C.]]'s [[Southwest Waterfront]], it is hosted by the Port of Washington Yacht Club and supported by several yacht clubs and marinas in the area.  2011 marked the 36th year that the Blessing has taken place.  With activity on land as well as on the water, the event is an exciting display of pageantry and seamanship that draws up to 100 boats each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powyc.org |title=POWYC Home - Port of Washington Yacht Club |publisher=Powyc.org |date= |accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Algoma, WI===
The first Blessing of the Fleet celebration is to be held on the eve of the two year anniversary of a large fire that threatened many boats as well as lives of some of the crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fox11online.com/news/local/lakeshore/several-boats-damaged-in-algoma-marina-fire | title=Several boats damaged in Algoma Marina fire |publisher=wluk.com |date=2016-06-23 |accessdate=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event is being advertised locally with signs as well as on Facebook. The event will feature a trout boil with a portion of the proceeds benefiting the Algoma Fire Department, and Paster Chris Jackson will be performing the ceremony. The Blessing of the Fleet is planned to be an annual kick off event, adding to the rich history of Lake Michigan trout and salmon fishing out of the historic port.

{{about|an obsolete medical preparation|the Roman Catholic Blue Mass for law enforcement professionals|Blue Mass}}
'''Blue mass''' (also known as '''blue pill''' or '''pilula hydrargyri''') was the name of a [[Mercury_(element)|mercury]]-based medicine formerly common from the 17th to the 19th centuries. The oldest formula is ascribed to one [[Hayreddin_Barbarossa|Barbarossa]], in a letter to [[Francis I of France]].&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, William. ''Elements of Materia Medica''. Dublin, 1851, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Blue mass was used as a specific treatment for [[syphilis]] from at least the late 17th century to the early 18th.&lt;ref&gt;Marten, John. ''A Treatise of the Venereal Disease''. London, 1711, p. 630.&lt;/ref&gt; Blue mass was recommended as a remedy for such widely varied complaints as [[tuberculosis]], [[constipation]], [[toothache]], [[parasite|parasitic infestations]], and the pains of [[childbirth]].  

A combination of blue mass, and a mixture called the common [[black draught]], was a standard cure for [[constipation]] in early 19th century [[England]] and elsewhere. It was particularly valued on [[ship]]s of the [[Royal Navy]], where [[sailor]]s and officers were constrained to eat rock-hard [[salt]]ed [[beef]] and [[pork]], old stale biscuits ([[hardtack]]), and very little [[fruit]], [[dietary fiber|fiber]], or other fresh food once they were at sea for an extended period.

It was a [[compounding|magistral preparation]], compounded by pharmacists themselves based on their own recipes or on one of several widespread recipes.  It was sold in the form of blue or gray [[Pill (pharmacy)|pill]]s, or [[syrup]]. Its name probably derives from the use of blue [[dye]] or blue [[chalk]] (used as a buffer) in some formulations. 

The ingredients of blue mass varied, as each [[pharmacy|pharmacist]] prepared it himself, but they all included [[mercury (element)|mercury]] in elemental or compound form (often as mercury chloride, also known as [[Mercury(I) chloride|calomel]]). One recipe of the period included (for blue mass syrup):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.henriettesherbal.com/eclectic/kings/massae-pilu.html King's American Dispensatory, 1898.]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
* 33% [[mercury (element)|mercury]] (nearly one-third, measured by weight)
* 5% [[licorice]]
* 25% [[Althaea (genus)|''Althaea'']] (possibly [[hollyhock]] or [[Althaea officinalis|marshmallow]])
* 3% [[glycerol]]
* 34% [[rose]] [[honey]]

Blue pills were produced by substituting [[milk sugar]] and [[rose oil]] for the glycerol and rose honey.  Pills contained one [[grain (unit)|grain]] (64.8 milligrams) of mercury.

==Toxicity==
Mercury is known today to be toxic, and ingestion of mercury leads to [[mercury poisoning]], a form of [[heavy metal poisoning|heavy-metal poisoning]]. While mercury is still used in compound form in some types of medicines and for other purposes, blue mass contained excessive amounts of the metal: a typical daily dose of two or three blue mass pills represented ingestion of more than one hundred times the daily limits set by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] in the [[United States]] today.

==Use by Abraham Lincoln==
It is well known that [[Abraham Lincoln]] used blue mass regularly, but there is debate over what ailment the medicine was intended to address. Historians most commonly state that Lincoln used blue mass in the treatment of constipation. Some historians suspect that Lincoln used blue mass to treat his "[[Depression (mood)|melancholy]]" (probably [[clinical depression]]). It may have been both, as it was commonly believed during the time period that problems of digestion, the failure of the liver to properly secrete bile, could lead to mental disorders. The following statement made by one of Lincoln's friends lends support to this theory,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lincoln's melancholy never failed to impress any man who ever saw or knew him.  The perpetual look of sadness was his most prominent feature.  The cause of this peculiar condition was a matter of frequent discussion among his friends.  His liver failed to work properly—did not secrete bile—and his bowels were equally as inactive.  "I used to advise him to take blue-mass pills," related Stuart, "and he did take them before he went to Washington, and for five months while he was President, but when I came on to Congress he told me had ceased using them because they made him cross.&lt;ref&gt;''Herndon's Lincoln: The True Story of a Great Life'', by William Herndon and Jesse William Weik, Vol. III, The Herndon’s Lincoln Publishing Company, Springfield, Illinois, 1888, p. 588 fn&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lincoln's use of blue mass may have altered his behavior, and may explain the erratic behavior and violent rages to which he was subject over a period of years prior to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in the [[United States]].  Some historians believe that this explains the contrast between his earlier behavior (while he was perhaps suffering from mercury poisoning from his use of blue mass) and his later behavior during the war (after he had stopped taking blue mass), given that most of the effects of mercury poisoning are reversible.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Perspectives in Biology and Medicine]]'', volume 44, number 3 (summer 2001):315–32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Manier| first = Jeremy | title = For Lincoln, ancient cure worse than his malady| work =Chicago Tribune| date = 17 July 2001| url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-07-17/news/0107170220_1_lincoln-scholars-illinois-historic-preservation-agency-pills | accessdate = 14 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is, however, evidence that Lincoln continued to take blue mass.  An interview given by his wife [[Mary Todd Lincoln]] to a correspondent from the ''[[Pittsburgh Chronicle]]'' suggests that Lincoln continued his use of the medication, despite his earlier statements to the contrary.  In the interview Mrs. Lincoln described an instance in which her husband's "usual medicine", the mercury based "blue pills" made him terribly ill.  Mrs. Lincoln "recalled the fact that her husband had been very ill, for several days, from the effects of a dose of blue pills taken shortly before his second inauguration."  She said he was not well, and appearing to require his usual medicine, blue pills, she sent to the drug store in which Harrold was employed last and got a dose and gave them to him at night before going to bed, and that next morning his pallor terrified her.  "His face," said she, pointing to the bed beside which she sat, "was white as that pillow-case, as it lay just there," she exclaimed, laying her hand on the pillow—"white, and such a deadly white; as he tried to rise he sank back again quite overcome!"  She described his anxiety to be up, there was so much to do, and her persistence and his oppressive languor in keeping him in bed for several days; said he and she both thought it so strange that the pills should affect him in that way; they never had done so before, and both concluded they would get no more medicine there, as the attendant evidently did not understand making up prescriptions.&lt;ref&gt;''Sacramento Daily Union'', Volume 29, Number 4497, 21 August 1865, Late Atlantic Intelligence&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, since no hair samples from Lincoln during this period are available, it is impossible to determine whether or not he was truly suffering from mercury poisoning while he was taking the blue mass.  

Other famous historical figures, such as [[Ulysses S. Grant]], may also have taken blue mass regularly.

'''Burning Man''' is an annual event in the [[Western United States|western]] United States at Black Rock City – a temporary city erected in the [[Black Rock Desert]] of northwest [[Nevada]], approximately {{convert|100|mi}} north-northeast of [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]]. The late summer event is described as an experiment in community and art, influenced by ten main principles: radical inclusion, radical self-reliance, radical self-expression, communal effort, civic responsibility, gifting, [[decommodification]], participation, immediacy and [[leave no trace]]. The event takes its name from its culmination, the symbolic ritual burning of a large wooden effigy ("The Man") that traditionally occurs on the Saturday evening of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2009/09/01/arts/20090902_BURNMAN_SLIDESHOW_index.html |title=ACTUAL ARTICLE TITLE BELONGS HERE! |work=The New York Times |date=September 1, 2009 |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dembowsky&gt;{{cite news|last=Dembowky|first=April|title=Priming for Burning Man, Flames in Hand|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/14/arts/design/14burn.html|accessdate=August 6, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chaplin&gt;{{cite news|last=Chaplin|first=Julia|title=Burning Man spreads its flame|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/12/fashion/12Burners.html|accessdate=August 6, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=saillant&gt;{{cite news|last=Saillant|first=Catherine|title=Burning Man becomes a hot academic topic|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/oct/20/local/la-me-burning-man-20101020|accessdate=August 6, 2011|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=October 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Location map

}}At Burning Man, the community explores various forms of artistic self-expression, which are created to be enjoyed by all participants. "Burning Man is about 'why not' overwhelming 'why'," one "Burner" said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Burning Man Got So Hot|url= https://www.theattic.space/home-page-blogs/2018/8/16/how-burning-man-got-so-hot|website=The Attic|accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participation is a key precept for the community – selfless giving of one's unique talents for the enjoyment of all is encouraged and actively reinforced. Some of these generous outpourings of creativity include experimental and interactive sculptures, buildings, performances and [[art car]]s, among other media. These contributions are inspired by the yearly theme, which is chosen by the organizers.

Burning Man is organized by the Burning Man Project, a non-profit organization that, in 2014, succeeded a for-profit [[limited liability company]] ([[Black Rock City, LLC]]) that was formed in 1997 to represent the event's organizers, and is now considered a subsidiary of the non-profit organization.

===1986 to 1989===
[[File:Two-burning-man-founders.png|thumb|195x195px|Two of the founders of Burning Man: John Law (left) and Michael Mikel&lt;!--(right).--&gt;]]
Burning Man began as a [[bonfire]] ritual on the summer [[solstice]] in 1986 when [[Larry Harvey]], Jerry James and a few friends met on [[Baker Beach]] in San Francisco&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacredtribesjournal.org/htdocs/images/Encyclopedia/Burning_Man_Festival.pdf StJ’s Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222170040/http://www.sacredtribesjournal.org/htdocs/images/Encyclopedia/Burning_Man_Festival.pdf |date=February 22, 2014 }}{{citation not found}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Harvey has described his inspiration for burning these effigies as a spontaneous act of "radical self-expression".&lt;ref name="Doherty 2006 28"&gt;({{cite book | last = Doherty | first = Brian | title = This Is Burning Man |publisher = [[Benbella Books]] |date=July 2006 | page = 28  | isbn = 978-1-932100-86-0}})&lt;/ref&gt; Sculptor Mary Grauberger, a friend of Harvey's girlfriend Janet Lohr, held solstice bonfire gatherings on Baker Beach for several years prior to 1986, some of which Harvey attended.  When Grauberger stopped organizing it, Harvey "picked up the torch," and ran with it.&lt;ref name="Doherty 2006 28"/&gt; He and Jerry James built the first wooden effigy on the afternoon of June 21, 1986, cobbled together using scrap wood, to be torched later that evening. In 1987, the effigy grew to {{Convert|15|ft|m}} tall, and by 1988, it had grown to {{Convert|30|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name="burn.life"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burn.life/1986--1990-the-early-days.html|title=Burning Man 1986–1990 – The Early Years}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

By 1988, Larry Harvey formally named the summer solstice ritual "Burning Man," by titling flyers for the happening as such; to ward off references such as "wicker man," referring to the practice of burning live sacrifices in wicker cages. Harvey has stated that he had not seen the 1973 [[cult film]]'' [[The Wicker Man (1973 film)|The Wicker Man]]'' until many years after and that it did not inspire the action.&lt;ref name="burn.life"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=799JDtofMpEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=wicker&amp;f=false|title=This Is Burning Man|first=Brian|last=Doherty|date=September 3, 2007|publisher=Little, Brown|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990 to 1996===
In 1990, a separate event was planned by Kevin Evans and [[John Law (American artist)|John Law]] on the remote and largely unknown [[dry lake]] known as [[Black Rock Desert]], about 110 miles north of [[Reno]], Nevada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laughingsquid.com/bad-day-at-black-rock-cacophony-society-zone-trip-4/ |title=Bad Day at Black Rock (Cacophony Society Zone Trip #4) |publisher=Laughingsquid.com |date=January 18, 2007 |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans conceived it as a [[dadaist]] [[temporary autonomous zone]] with sculpture to be burned and [[Situationist International|situationist]] performance art. He asked John Law, who also had experience on the dry lake and was a defining founder of [[Cacophony Society]], to take on central organizing functions. In the Cacophony Society's newsletter, it was announced as Zone No. 4, A Bad Day at Black Rock (inspired by the 1955 [[Bad Day at Black Rock|film of the same name]]).

Meanwhile, the beach burn was interrupted by the park police for not having a permit. After striking a deal to raise the Man but not to burn it, event organizers disassembled the effigy and returned it to the vacant lot where it had been built. Shortly thereafter, the legs and torso of the Man were chain-sawed and the pieces removed when the lot was unexpectedly leased as a parking lot. The effigy was reconstructed, led by Dan Miller, Harvey's then-housemate of many years, just in time to take it to Zone Trip No. 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/1986_1996/ |title=What is Burning Man?: Early Years |publisher=Burning Man |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Mikel, another active Cacophonist, realized that a group unfamiliar with the environment of the dry lake would be helped by knowledgeable persons to ensure they did not get lost in the deep dry lake and risk dehydration and death. He took the name Danger Ranger and created the Black Rock Rangers. Thus the seed of Black Rock City was germinated, as a fellowship, organized by Law and Mikel, based on Evans' idea, along with Harvey and James' symbolic man. Drawing on experience in the sign business and with light sculpture, John Law prepared custom neon tubes for the Man in 1991 so it could be seen as a beacon at night.

In its first years, the community grew by word of mouth alone, all were considered participants by virtue of surviving in the desolate surreal trackless plain of the [[Black Rock Desert]]. There were no paid or scheduled performers or artists, no separation between art-space and living-space, no rules other than "Don't interfere with anyone else's immediate experience" and "no guns in central camp."

1991 marked the first year that the event had a legal permit, through the BLM (the [[Bureau of Land Management]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nv.blm.gov/news_releases/Press_Releases/fy06_releases/nr_wfo_33.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923001623/http://www.nv.blm.gov/news_releases/Press_Releases/fy06_releases/nr_wfo_33.htm|date=September 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1991 was also the year that art model and fire dancer (and later Burning Man's first art director) ''Crimson Rose'' attended the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.everfest.com/magazine/meet-the-woman-who-brought-fire-dancing-to-burning-man|title=Meet the Woman Who Brought Fire Dancing to Burning Man|work=Everfest|access-date=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1992 saw the birth of a smaller, intensive (about 20 participants the first year; about 100 in years two and three) near-by event named "Desert Siteworks," conceived and directed by William Binzen and co-produced (in 1993 and '94) with Judy West.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite book | last = Doherty | first = Brian | title = This Is Burning Man | publisher = [[Benbella Books]] |date=July 2006 | url = https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=799JDtofMpEC&amp;lpg=PT54&amp;ots=c6BpIxdDIB&amp;dq=desert%20siteworks%20trego&amp;pg=PT54#v=onepage&amp;q=desert%20siteworks%20trego&amp;f=false | accessdate = 13 June 2014| isbn = 978-1-932100-86-0}})&lt;/ref&gt; The annual, several weeks-long event, was held over summer Solstice at various fertile hot springs surrounding the desert. Participants built art and participated in self-directed performances. Some key organizers of Burning Man were also part of [[Desert Siteworks]] (John Law, Michael Mikel) and William Binzen was a friend of [[Larry Harvey]]. Hence, the two events saw lots of cross-pollination of ideas and participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Olivier|first=Bonin|title=Dust &amp; Illusions.

Before the event opened to the public in 1996, a worker named Michael Furey was killed in a motorcycle crash&lt;ref name="Doherty2006"&gt;{{cite book

Harvey insisted that the death had not occurred at Burning Man, since the gates were not yet open. Another couple was run over in their tent by an art car driving to "rave camp," which was at that time distant from the main camp. After the 1996 event, co-founder and partner John Law [[John Law (American artist)#Founders' conflict|broke with Burning Man]] and publicly said the event should not continue.

===1997 to present===
[[File:Neonman2.jpg|thumb|upright|The neon-tubed Man&lt;br /&gt;at the 1999 event]]
1997 marked another major pivotal year for the event. By 1996, the event had grown to 8,000 attendees and unrestricted driving on the open playa was becoming a major safety hazard. To implement a ban on driving and re-create the event as a pedestrian/bicycle/art-car-only event, it was decided to move to private gated property. Fly Ranch, with the smaller adjoining Hualapai dry lake-bed, just west of the Black Rock desert, was chosen. This moved Burning Man from Pershing County/federal BLM land into the jurisdiction of [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe County]], which brought a protracted list of permit requirements.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite book | last = Doherty | first = Brian | title = This Is Burning Man | publisher = [[BenBella Books]] |date=July 2006 | page = 124 | isbn = 978-1-932100-86-0}})&lt;/ref&gt;

To comply with the new requirements and to manage the increased liability load, the organizers formed Black Rock City, [[Limited liability company|LLC]]. Will Roger Peterson and Flynn Mauthe created the Department of Public Works (DPW) to build the "city" grid layout (a requirement so that emergency vehicles could be directed to an "address") designed by Rod Garrett, an architect. Rod continued as the city designer until his death, in 2011, at the age of 76. He is also credited with the design of all of the man bases from 2001 through 2012, the center camp café and first camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Andrew Dalton |url=http://sfist.com/2011/08/29/black_rock_city_architect_rod_garre.php |title=Burning Man Architect Rod Garrett Dies at Age 76 |publisher=SFist |date=August 29, 2011 |access-date=31 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715021506/http://sfist.com/2011/08/29/black_rock_city_architect_rod_garre.php |archivedate=July 15, 2014 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the success of the driving ban, having no vehicular incidents, 1998 saw a return to the Black Rock desert, along with a temporary perimeter fence. The event has remained there since.

As the population of Black Rock City grew, further rules were established in relation to its survival. Some critics of the event cite the addition of these rules as impinging on the original freedoms, altering the experience unacceptably, while others find the increased level of activity more than balances out the changes.

===Transition to a non-profit organization===
In April 2011, Larry Harvey announced that the LLC was beginning a three-year process to transfer ownership and control of the event over to a new non-profit organization called the "Burning Man Project."  The move towards becoming a non-profit organization was the result of "bitter infighting" between members of the board.  At one point it looked like all of the board members were going to hire lawyers.  Corporate appraisers were brought in to determine how much the company was worth, which Larry Harvey found "abhorrent" and against all of the values that Burning Man stood for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man on the move|url=http://www.sfbg.com/2011/04/05/man-move}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier agreement stated that each member of the LLC would only receive "sole compensation for many years of service, a golden parachute of $20,000." But the members now consented to an arrangement whereby each member of the LLC would receive an undisclosed sum prior to the transfer of their ownership rights to the Burning Man Project. Marian Goodell, board member and head of communications, addressed concerns about the lack of transparency with this statement:  "When you're in the middle of a storm, if you're going to explain all of how you got there, and how you're going to get out, it often sets more panic among the survivors than if you just sail the boat out of the darkness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Changing Face of the Burning Man Festival

It was announced in March 2014 via the official Burning Man Blog that the non-profit transition was complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Burning Man Transitions to Non-Profit Organization|url=http://blog.burningman.com/2014/03/news/burning-man-transitions-to-non-profit-organization/|website=Burning Blog|accessdate=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the new non-profit structure Black Rock City LLC, the longtime for-profit responsible for the event, would be a subsidiary of the non-profit Burning Man Project. Although unmentioned in the initial announcement, the Terms and Conditions for ticket buyers were changed to reflect an alteration in the structure of the business. Under the new terms it was made known that a new LLC was created, Decommodification LLC, which in the new non-profit business structure, owns all of the intellectual property associated with the Burning Man brand, including ownership over logos and trademarks, and will be responsible for enforcement thereof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Terms and Conditions|url=http://tickets.burningman.com/terms-and-conditions/|accessdate=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-profit Burning Man Project licenses usage of all intellectual property associated with Burning Man from Decommodification LLC. After questions were raised by the community about this new LLC within the comment section on the original non-profit announcement Larry Harvey confirmed that he and the other founders were the sole owners of this new LLC.

===Timeline of the event===
The statistics below illustrate the growth in attendance of the Burning Man event, from a few handfuls of people to more than 70,000 in 2015, as well as other facts and figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/about_burningman/bm_timeline.html |title=a timeline on |publisher=Burning Man |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burning Man 2006 was covered extensively for television for the first time by subscription television channel [[Current TV]] which handed out cameras to participants and broadcast daily updates via satellite from the dry lake. "TV Free Burning Man" also provided TV viewers an hour-long live feed of The Burn and was shown without commercial sponsorship. TV Free returned in 2007 and 2008; the 2007 coverage was nominated for a news [[Emmy Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emmyonline.org/mediacenter/news_29th_nominees_data_list.html |title=The Emmy Awards – 29th Annual News &amp; Documentary Emmy Awards |publisher=Emmyonline.org |accessdate=31 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926054118/http://www.emmyonline.org/mediacenter/news_29th_nominees_data_list.html |archivedate=September 26, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The height of the Burning Man effigy has remained close to 40 feet (12 meters) tall between 1989 and 2013. During those years changes in the height and structure of the base account for the differing heights of the overall structures.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} In 2014 the configuration and height of the Man itself changed, and Burners were presented with a taller, more robust figure.  For 2016, 2017 &amp; 2018 the Man itself returned to its 40-foot configuration.

| Due to the sellout of the event in 2011, the BMOrg opted for a complex multi-round, random selection system of ticket sales with a separate low income program. On January 27, BMOrg announced that the number of tickets requested in the Main Sale was around 120,000 vs the 40,000 that were available. In consequence a significant number of registrants would not be awarded tickets in the Main Sale. The Main Sale was originally planned to be followed by a secondary open sale of 10,000 tickets. However, as the huge demand from the Main Sale left many veteran burners and theme camps without tickets, BMOrg opted for a "directed ticket distribution" instead, i.e., "manually redirect them to some of the vital groups and collaborations that make up Black Rock City" rather than an open sale.

Because of the variety of goals fostered by participatory attendees, known as "Burners", Burning Man does not have a single focus. Features of the event are subject to the participants and include ''community,'' ''artwork,'' ''absurdity,'' ''decommodification'' and ''revelry.'' Participation is encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/ What is Burning Man?] "There are no rules about how one must behave or express oneself at this event (save the rules that serve to protect the health, safety, and experience of the community at large); rather, it is up to each participant to decide how they will contribute and what they will give to this community. ... Participants are encouraged to find a way to help make the theme come alive ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schmeiser |first=Lisa |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/dollarsandsense/detail?entry_id=70726 |title="Burning Man: Recession Proof?" SF Gate |work=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Burning Man event and its affiliated communities are guided by 10 principles that are meant to evoke the cultural ethos that has emerged from the event. They were originally written by Larry Harvey in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKu1vS1_lHw |title=Larry Harvey Talk Burning Man 2010 Regional Summit |via=YouTube |accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as guidelines for regional organizing, then later became a universal criterion of the general culture of the multifaceted movement. They are:&lt;ref name=principles&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/about_burningman/principles.html |title=10 principles of Burning Man |publisher=Burning Man|accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* radical [[inclusion (value and practice)|inclusion]]
* gifting
* [[decommodification]]
* radical [[self-sufficiency|self-reliance]]
* radical [[emotional expression|self-expression]]
* [[community|communal]] effort
* civic [[:wikt:responsibility|responsibility]]
* [[leave no trace|leaving no trace]]
* participation
* immediacy
The descriptions in quotes are the actual text:

===Radical Inclusion===

"Anyone may be a part of Burning Man. We welcome and respect the stranger. No prerequisites exist for participation in our community."
This was written with a broad stroke for general organizing, meaning anyone is welcome to the Burning Man culture. Prerequisites for the Burning Man&lt;ref name=principles /&gt; event are; participants are expected to provide for their own basic needs, follow the guidelines stated in the annually updated event "survival guide," and purchase a ticket to get in.&lt;ref name=survivalguide&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burningman.com/preparation/event_survival/index.html |title=10 Burning Man Survival Guide|publisher=Burning Man |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gifting===
"Burning Man is devoted to acts of gift giving. The value of a gift is unconditional. Gifting does not contemplate a return or an exchange for something of equal value."
Instead of cash, participants at the Burning Man event in the Black Rock Desert are encouraged to rely on a [[gift economy]], a sort of [[potlatch]]. In the earliest days of the event, an underground [[barter]] economy also existed, in which burners exchanged "favors" with each other. While this was originally supported by the Burning Man organization, this is now largely discouraged. Instead, burners are encouraged to give gifts to one another unconditionally.

===Decommodification===
"In order to preserve the spirit of gifting, our community seeks to create social environments that are unmediated by commercial sponsorships, transactions, or advertising. We stand ready to protect our culture from such exploitation. We resist the substitution of consumption for participatory experience."
No cash transactions are permitted between attendees of the Burning Man event in the Black Rock Desert. Cash can be used for a select few charity, fuel, and sanitation vendors as follows:
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burningman.com/preparation/event_survival/community.html |title=No Cash Transactions |publisher=Burning Man|date=August 29, 2011 |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Café beverages such as coffee, [[Masala chai|chai]], [[lemonade]], etc., which are sold at Center Camp Café, operated by the organizers of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burningman.com/participate/cafe_coffee_shop.html |title=Coffee |publisher=Burning Man |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ice]] sales benefit the local [[Gerlach, Nevada|Gerlach]]-[[Empire, Nevada|Empire]] school system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burningman.com/on_the_playa/infrastructure/ice.html |title=Camp Arctica |publisher=Burning Man |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tickets for the shuttle bus to the nearest Nevada communities of Gerlach and Empire which is operated by a contractor not participating in the event: [[Green Tortoise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burningman.com/preparation/event_survival/community.html |title=Shuttle Service |publisher=Burning Man|date=August 29, 2011 |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A re-entry wristband, which allows a person to leave and re-enter the event and may be purchased at the gate upon exit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/about_burningman/faq_what_is.html#Tickets |title=What is Burning Man?: FAQ |publisher=Burning Man |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An airport use fee, payable at the airport upon first entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.burningman.com/on_the_playa/airport/faq_air.html |title=On The Playa |publisher=Burning Man |accessdate=31 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120141639/http://www.burningman.com/on_the_playa/airport/faq_air.html |archivedate=January 20, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Diesel and biodiesel sold by third-party contractors.
* RV dump service and camp [[graywater]] disposal service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burningman.com/preparation/event_survival/rvs.html |title=Preparation |publisher=Burning Man |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Private portable toilets and servicing, which can be arranged with the official contractor.

===Radical Self-Reliance===
[[File:Burning Man 2012 (7942014474).jpg|thumb|Dust storms are common at Burning Man, so many come prepared with appropriate provisions, such as goggles and masks to reduce dust inhalation.]]
"Burning Man encourages the individual to discover, exercise and rely on his or her inner resources."
The event's harsh environment and remote location requires participants to be responsible for their own subsistence. Since the LLC forbids most commerce, participants must be prepared and bring all their own supplies with the exception of the items stated in Decommodification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burningman.com/preparation/event_survival/radical_self_reliance.html |title=preparation :: Radical Self Reliance |publisher=Burning Man |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radical Self-Expression===
[[File:Trojan Horse Pull - Burning Man 2011.webm|thumb|right|Trojan Horse Pull – Burning Man 2011]]
"Radical self-expression arises from the unique gifts of the individual. No one other than the individual or a collaborating group can determine its content. It is offered as a gift to others. In this spirit, the giver should respect the rights and liberties of the recipient."
Participants at the Burning Man event in the Black Rock Desert are encouraged to express themselves in a number of ways through various art forms and projects. The event is clothing-optional and [[public nudity]] is common, though not practiced by the majority.&lt;ref name="OpenSex"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burningman.com/preparation/event_survival/kids_at_bm.html |title=Event Preparation |publisher=Burning Man|accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Illicit Activities"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishworldreview.com/weekly/standard092499.asp |title=What I Saw at Burning Man |publisher=Jewishworldreview.com |date=September 24, 1999 |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Glenn |last=Wohltmann |work=Pleasanton Weekly |location=Pleasanton, California |date=August 29, 2011 |title=The Ultimate Festival – Burning Man: a 50,000-person celebration in the Nevada desert for one week each year |url=http://www.pleasantonweekly.com/news/show_story.php?id=7622 |access-date=August 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communal Effort===
"Our community values creative cooperation and collaboration. We strive to produce, promote and protect social networks, public spaces, works of art, and methods of communication that support such interaction."
Participants at the Burning Man event in the Black Rock Desert are encouraged to work with and help fellow participants.&lt;ref name=participate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burningman.com/participate/ |title=Participate Main |publisher=Burning Man |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civic Responsibility===
"We value civil society. Community members who organize events should assume responsibility for public welfare and endeavor to communicate civic responsibilities to participants. They must also assume responsibility for conducting events in accordance with local, state and federal laws."

===Leave No Trace===
[[File:Shinobi walks the line.jpg|thumb|Burning Man Playa Restoration 2015 – attendees carry MOOP (matter out of place) sticks and buckets and walk to pick up discarded materials, as part of the 'leave no trace' policy.]]

"Our community respects the environment. We are committed to leaving no physical trace of our activities wherever we gather. We clean up after ourselves and endeavor, whenever possible, to leave such places in a better state than when we found them."

===Participation===

"Our community is committed to a radically participatory ethic. We believe that transformative change, whether in the individual or in society, can occur only through the medium of deeply personal participation. We achieve being through doing. Everyone is invited to work. Everyone is invited to play. We make the world real through actions that open the heart." People are encouraged to participate, rather than observe.

===Immediacy===
"Immediate experience is, in many ways, the most important touchstone of value in our culture. We seek to overcome barriers that stand between us and a recognition of our inner selves, the reality of those around us, participation in society, and contact with a natural world exceeding human powers. No idea can substitute for this experience."

The burning of a temple, as well as the Man, has become a tradition activity at the event. It takes place the evening after the burning of the Man. Sculptor [[David Best (sculptor)|David Best]]'s temple projects were [[Art destruction|ritually burned]] from 2000 to 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burningman.com/art_of_burningman/|title=Art of Burning Man|publisher=Burning Man|accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition of participants inscribing the surfaces of the piece with personal messages has continued through all of the iterations of the temple.

* 2007&amp;nbsp;– The Temple of Forgiveness &lt;br /&gt; In 2007 David Best took over the temple building duties for what he thought would be one last time. The 2007 Temple was named "The Temple of Forgiveness." Best stated that after 2007, it was time to hand the Temple over to the community.
* 2008&amp;nbsp;– Basura Sagrada &lt;br /&gt; In 2008 the "Basura Sagrada" (Spanish for "sacred trash") Temple was a collaboration of Shrine and Tucker Teutsch 3.0, built with the extensive help of their friends and the greater Burning Man community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.current.tv/pods/tvfreeburningman/PD07063 Current // Items] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911022200/http://www.current.tv/pods/tvfreeburningman/PD07063|date=September 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2009&amp;nbsp;– Fire of Fires &lt;br /&gt; In 2009, the "Fire of Fires" Temple for Burning Man was built in Austin, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://communityartmakers.com/|title=Community Art Makers|date=February 14, 2009|publisher=Community Art Makers|accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2010&amp;nbsp;– The Temple of Flux &lt;br /&gt; In 2010, the Temple of Flux was designed and orchestrated by artists Rebecca Anders, Jess Hobbs and Peter (pk.) Kimelman who formed the Flux Foundation. This group was notable for drawing from a broad section of the Burning Man community, including the large-scale sound camps and other existing BM art groups. The Flux Foundation has since continued to make large-scale public art outside Burning Man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fluxfoundation.org/|title=The Flux Foundation|publisher=The Flux Foundation|accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Temple of Flux broke from tradition and was highly abstract in nature, appearing as a series of landforms with canyon and cave-like spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://temple2010.org/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417083112/http://temple2010.org/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-04-17|title=Temple of Flux|publisher=Temple2010.org|accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2011&amp;nbsp;– The Temple of Transition &lt;br /&gt;The 2011 Temple was the first Temple built in Reno, Nevada. The International Arts Megacrew, helmed by Chris "Kiwi" Hankins, Diarmaid "Irish" Horkan and Ian "Beave" Beaverstock returned to a more traditional style. The Temple of Transition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalartsmegacrew.com/?page_id=273|title=Temple of Transition|website=International Arts Megacrew|access-date=August 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; took the form of a 120-foot tiered, hexagonal central tower, surrounded by five 58-foot tiered, hexagonal towers. The towers were vaulted and lofty, cut with a profusion of gothic style arches.
* 2012&amp;nbsp;– The Temple of Juno &lt;br /&gt;With the 2012 Temple came the return of David Best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetemplecrew.org/juno.html|title=The Temple of Juno|website=The Temple Crew|access-date=August 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Temple of Juno incorporated a large central tower with central altar space, sitting within a 150' x 150' walled courtyard lined with benches, accessed from four entrances. Intricately cut wooden panels and detailed shapes covered the courtyard walls as well as the interior space and altars.
* 2013&amp;nbsp;– The Temple of Whollyness &lt;br /&gt;This temple was created by The Otic Oasis team, led by architect and artist Gregg Fleishman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greggfleishman.com|title=Gregg Fleishman Studio}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terry Lightning "Clearwater III" Gross, and Melissa "Syn" Barron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://temple2013.org|title=Home – Temple of Whollyness}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first Temple built without nails, bolts, adhesives, or fasteners of any kind. This Temple incorporated a massive 17-ton black basalt Inuksuk sculpture created by artist, James LaFemina to act as the central altar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ignitechannel.com/articles/artist-interviews/artist-interview-with-the-temple-of-whollyness-builders/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328041605/http://ignitechannel.com/articles/artist-interviews/artist-interview-with-the-temple-of-whollyness-builders/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-03-28|title=Artist Interview with the Temple of Whollyness Builders|publisher=Ignitechannel.com|accessdate=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conceptual artist and composer, Aaron 'Taylor' Kuffner, who debuted at Burning Man with the 2011 Temple of Transition, returned to contribute musical elements with a different execution of the Gamelatron.
* 2014&amp;nbsp;– The Temple of Grace &lt;br /&gt;Following the sudden withdrawal of chosen 2014 Temple builder Ross Asselstine, who was to build the Temple of Descendants, David Best came out of retirement a third time to build his eighth Temple. The Temple of Grace was intended to be a spiritual and sacred space for memorials, reflection, celebration, and to commemorate life transitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetemplecrew.org/grace.html|title=The Temple of Grace|website=The Temple Crew|access-date=August 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure incorporated a central interior dome within a graceful curved body made of wood and steel. Again, it had intricately cut wooden panels for the exterior and interior skin. Eight altars surrounded the temple inside a low-walled courtyard, creating a large exterior grounds for the community.
* 2015&amp;nbsp;– The Temple of Promise&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://burningman.org/event/brc/2015-art-installations/?yyyy=&amp;aq=temple#TempleofPromise|title=2015 Art Installations {{!}} Burning Man|website=''burningman.org''|accessdate=3 September 2015}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This temple was created by Dreamers Guild and built primarily in Alameda, CA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.templeofpromise.org/|title=Temple of Promise|website=|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temple welcomes participants through an archway soaring 97 feet overhead. As the path continues to curve, it opens into the contemplative altar and the heart of the Temple: a grove of three sculpted trees. The branches are initially bare. Participants will write messages on long strips of cloth and attach them to the trees, creating the gentle shade of Weeping Willows, increasing as the week progresses.
* 2016&amp;nbsp;– The Temple (no [[prepositional phrase]]) &lt;br /&gt;David Best came out of retirement yet again to build a pagoda style temple. This year the wooden pieces were cut by hand without the use of a [[CNC]] machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rgj.com/story/life/arts/burning-man/2016/07/15/why-years-burning-man-temple-has-no-name/87088796/|title=Why this year's Burning Man temple has no name|accessdate=September 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The triangular trusses formed different paths towards a central space holding a giant 3D printed mandala at the center. The timber modules start large enough to hold small alcoves in which people could interact with the structure in peace. As participants walked through the path, the timber modules lifted up and became thinner towards the sky as they reachedthe central mandala.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://templegalaxia.org|title=Galaxia|accessdate=April 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
[[File:Burning Man 2013 Coyote (10227012075).jpg|thumb|Coyote sculpture (2013)]]
Burning Man primarily features large scale interactive installation art inspired by the intersection of maker culture, technology and a connection to nature. Many works invite participation through climbing, touch, a technological interface or motion. Because of its principles of participation and radical inclusivity, much of outsider  and [[visionary art]], though a great variety of art forms appear during the event. Creative expression through the arts and interactive art are encouraged at Burning Man in many forms. Music, performance and guerrilla street theatre are art forms commonly presented within the camps and developed areas of the city. Artwork is placed in the open playa beyond the streets of the city and each year hundreds of isolated artworks, ranging from small to very large-scale art installations, often sculptures with kinetic, electronic and fire elements are brought to Black Rock City.

Art on the dry lake bed (the ''playa'') is assisted by the Artery, which helps artists place their art in the desert and ensures lighting (to prevent collisions), burn platform (to protect the integrity of the dry lake bed) and that fire safety requirements are met.&lt;ref&gt;Burningman.com [http://www.burningman.com/installations/ Art Installations]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Art grant]]s are, however, available to participants via a system of curation and oversight, with application deadlines early in the year. Grants are intended to help artists produce work beyond the scope of their own means, and are generally intended to cover only a portion of the costs associated with creation of the pieces, usually requiring considerable reliance on an artist's community resources. Aggregate funding for all grants varies depending on the number and quality of the submissions (usually well over 100) but amounts to several percent (on the order of $500,000 in recent years) of the gross receipts from ticket sales. In 2006, 29 pieces were funded.

Various standards regarding the nature of the artworks eligible for grants are set by the Art Department, but compliance with the theme and interactivity are important considerations.  This funding has fostered artistic communities, most notably in the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area of California]], the region that has historically provided a majority of the event's participants. There are active and successful outreach efforts to enlarge the regional scope of the event and the grant program.

=== ''No Spectators: The Art of Burning Man'' ===
In 2018, the Renwick Gallery of the American Art Museum at the Smithsonian in Washington D.C. brought the large-scale, participatory work from the desert gathering to the nation's capital for the first time.&lt;ref name="americanart.si.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/burning-man|title=No Spectators: The Art of Burning Man|website=Smithsonian American Art Museum|access-date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition took over the entire Renwick Gallery building and surrounding neighborhood, bringing alive the maker culture and creative spirit of this cultural movement. Immersive room-sized installations, costumes, jewelry, and ephemera transport visitors to the gathering's famed "Playa," while photographs and archival materials from the Nevada Museum of Art trace Burning Man's growth and its bohemian roots.&lt;ref name="americanart.si.edu"/&gt;

Large-scale installations—the artistic hallmark of Burning Man—form the core of the exhibition. Individual artists and collectives featured in ''No Spectators: The Art of Burning Man'' include [[David Best (sculptor)|David Best]], [[Candy Chang]], [[Marco Cochrane]], [[Duane Flatmo]], Michael Garlington and Natalia Bertotti, Five Ton Crane Arts Collective, [https://www.foldhaus.com/ FoldHaus Art Collective], Scott Froschauer, HYBYCOZO (Yelena Filipchuk and Serge Beaulieu), Android Jones, Aaron Taylor Kuffner, Christopher Schardt, Richard Wilks, and [[Leo Villareal]].

Multiple installation sites have been selected throughout the neighborhood surrounding the museum for ''No Spectators: Beyond the Renwick,'' which will include works by Jack Champion, Mr. and Mrs. Ferguson, HYBYCOZO, Laura Kimpton]], and Mischell Riley.

==Mutant vehicles==
[[File:Burning man 2010 (4966356687).jpg|thumb|Praying Mantis truck (2010)]]

Mutant Vehicles, often motorized, are purpose-built or creatively altered cars and trucks. Participants who wish to bring motorized mutant vehicles must submit their designs in advance to the event's own DMV or "Department of Mutant Vehicles" for approval and for physical inspection at the time of the event. Not all designs and proposals are accepted. The event organizers, and in turn the DMV, have set the bar high for what it deems an acceptable MV each year, in effect capping the number of Mutant Vehicles. This is in response to constraints imposed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which grants permits to hold the event on federal property, and to participants who want to maintain a pedestrian-friendly environment. Vehicles that are minimally altered, and/or whose primary function is to transport participants, are discouraged and rejected. One of the criteria the DMV employs to determine whether an application for a proposed Mutant Vehicle is approved is "can you recognize the base vehicle". For example, if a 1967 VW van covered with glitter, dolls' heads, and old cooking utensils can still be recognized as a VW van, it is considered to be "decorated not mutated" and is less likely to be approved. This criterion led to the exclusion of some "Art Cars", which historically have been a staple of the event. There were over six hundred approved Mutant Vehicles at the event in 2010.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Bicycles==
[[File:BURNING MAN 2010 (4962240955).jpg|thumb|Cyclists at Burning Man (2010)]]
Bicycles and tricycles are popular for getting around on the dry lake. [[Mountain bikes]] are generally preferred over [[road bike]]s for riding on the dried silt, which is normally hard but becomes loose with traffic. Participants often decorate their bikes to make them unique. Since lighting on the bikes is critically important for safety at night, many participants incorporate the lighting into their decorations, using [[electroluminescent wire]] (a thin, flexible tube that glows with a neon-like effect when energized with electricity) to create intricate patterns over the frame of the bike. Every night during Burning Man, thousands of bikes and art cars drive around, creating a visual display similar to Las Vegas at night, except that the lights are mobile.

== Theme Camps ==

===Electronic music===
Camps focusing on [[electronic music]], often played by live DJs, began to appear in 1992, as influenced by the [[rave]] culture of the San Francisco area. Terbo Ted was identified as having been the first ever DJ in Burning Man history, opening with a [[Jean Michel Jarre]] song played off a [[vinyl record]]. DJs typically occupied an area on the outskirts of the Playa nicknamed the "Techno Ghetto". In later years, designated spokes of the main camp were designated for "sound camps", with limits on volume and speaker positioning (angled away from the center of Black Rock City). To work around the rules, mutant vehicles with live DJs and large sound systems began to appear as well. A number of major electronic music camps have been well-known recurrents at Burning Man, including Opulent Temple and Robot Heart. Major producers and DJs representing various eras and genres have performed at Burning Man, including [[Armin van Buuren]], [[Carl Cox]], [[Markus Schulz]], [[François Kevorkian]] and [[Freq Nasty]] among others.&lt;ref name="npr-burningmanedm"&gt;{{cite web|title=Desert Music: Burning Man Confronts The Rising Beat|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2015/09/02/436697747/desert-music-burning-man-confronts-the-rising-beat|publisher=NPR|accessdate=September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, concerns began to surface among attendees that a growing number of "mainstream" [[electronic dance music]] acts (such as [[Skrillex]] and [[Diplo]]'s [[Jack Ü]] in 2014) had begun to appear. In 2015, organizers established a new area known as the "Deep Playa Music Zone" (or DMZ), to serve as a new host for sound trucks featuring live DJs.&lt;ref name="npr-burningmanedm"/&gt;

==Black Rock City==
[[File:Burningman aug31.jpg|thumb|Radar image of Black Rock City taken from the [[TerraSAR-X]] satellite in 2011|213x213px]]
[[File:Above BRC - Aerial views of Burning Man 2012.webm|thumb|right|200px|Aerial views of Black Rock City in 2012]]
{{Redirect|Black Rock City|the company that organizes Burning Man|Black Rock City, LLC}}
'''Black Rock City''', often abbreviated to '''BRC,''' is the name of the temporary city created by Burning Man participants. Much of the layout and general city infrastructure is constructed by Department of Public Works (DPW) volunteers who often reside in Black Rock City for several weeks before and after the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burningman.com/on_the_playa/infrastructure/dpw.html |title=On The Playa |publisher=Burning Man |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burningman.com/on_the_playa/ |title=On The Playa |publisher=Burning Man |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remainder of the city including theme camps, villages, art installations and individual camping are all created by participants.

===City planning===
The developed part of the city is currently arranged as a series of concentric streets in an arc composing, since 1999, two-thirds of a 1.5-mile (2.4-km) diameter circle with the Man Sculpture and his supporting complex at the very center ({{CoordDec|40.786455|-119.206701}} in 2017). Radial streets, sometimes called Avenues, extend from the Man to the outermost circle. The outlines of these streets are visible on aerial photographs.[[File:Burning Man aerial.jpg|thumb|Oblique aerial photo of Black Rock City showing the familiar "C" pattern 2010]]The innermost street is named the ''Esplanade'', and the remaining streets are given names to coincide with the overall theme of the burn, and ordered in ways such as alphabetical order or stem to stern, to make them easier to recall. For example, in 1999, for the "Wheel of Time" theme, and again in 2004 for "The Vault of Heaven" theme, the streets were named after the planets of the solar system. The radial streets are usually given a clock designation, for example, 6:00 or 6:15, in which the Man is at the center of the clock face and 12:00 is in the middle of the third of the arc lacking streets (usually at a [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]] of 60° true from the Man). These avenues have been identified in other ways, notably in 2002, in accordance with "The Floating World" theme, as the degrees of a compass, for example 175 degrees, and in 2003 as part of the Beyond Belief theme as adjectives ("Rational, Absurd") that caused every intersection with a concentric street (named after concepts of belief such as "Authority, Creed") to form a phrase such as "Absurd Authority" or "Rational Creed". However, these proved unpopular with participants due to difficulty in navigating the city without the familiar clock layout.

The Black Rock City Airport is constructed adjacent to the city, typically on its southern side. See Transportation section below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burningman.com/on_the_playa/airport/ |title=Black Rock City Airport |publisher=Burning Man|accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Center Camp===
[[File:Burning Man 2013 Cargo Cult (9625733758) (3).jpg|thumb|Bureau of Land Management officers and a Ranger at Burning Man]]
Center Camp is located along the mid line of Black Rock City, facing the Man at the 6:00 position on the Esplanade. This area serves as a central meeting place for the entire city and contains the Center Camp Cafe, Camp Arctica and a number of other city institutions.

===Villages and theme camps===
Villages and theme camps are located along the innermost streets of Black Rock City, often offering entertainment or services to participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/08/31/BAGD0EFM9G1.DTL |title=Theme Camps |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=August 31, 2005 |accessdate=31 March 2012 |first=Meredith |last=May}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theme camps are usually a collective of people representing themselves under a single identity. Villages are usually a collection of smaller theme camps which have banded together in order to share resources and vie for better placement.

Theme camps and villages often form to create an atmosphere in Black Rock City that their group envisioned. As Burning Man grows every year it attracts an even more diverse crowd.  Subcultures form around theme camps at Black Rock City similar to what can be found in other cities.

===Volunteers===
The Burning Man event is heavily dependent on a large number of volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;Burningman.com [http://www.burningman.com/participate/volunteer.html Volunteering page]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety, policing and regulations===
Black Rock City is patrolled by various local and state [[police|law enforcement]] agencies as well as the [[Bureau of Land Management]] [[park ranger|Rangers]]. The local police issue $1500 fines for drug use and serving alcohol to minors. Burning Man also has its own in-house group of volunteers, the Black Rock Rangers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rangers.burningman.com/about/|title=Who are the Ranges|accessdate=December 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who act as informal mediators when disputes arise between participants.

[[Firefighting]], [[Emergency medical services|emergency medical services (EMS)]], mental health, and communications support is provided by the volunteer Black Rock City Emergency Services Department (ESD). Three "[[Mobile Army Surgical Hospital|MASH]]"-like stations are set up in the city: station 3, 6 and 9. Station 6 is staffed by physicians and nurses working with a contracted state licensed ALS Medical provider, while Stations 3 and 9 are staffed by Black Rock City ESD personnel. While Station 3 and 9 provide emergency services and basic life support, the volunteers are generally doctors, nurses, [[Emergency medical technician|EMTs]]/[[paramedics]], and firefighters. Both station 3 and 9 have a small fire engines available in addition to a Hazardous material/ Rescue truck and [[Quick response vehicle]] for medical emergencies.

In [[:File:FBI files on Burning Man.pdf|documents]] from February 2013 first made public on August 29, 2015, it was revealed that in August 2010, the [[FBI]] had sent a memo to its field offices in Nevada stating that it would patrol Burning Man to "aid in the prevention of terrorist activities and intelligence collection." Although a threat assessment performed by the FBI in consort with Burning Man's contracted security determined that drug usage and crowd control were the only major threats to Burning Man, the Bureau still sent an unspecified number of undercover officers to the event, with "no adverse threats or reactions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FBI admits to spying on Burning Man|url=http://www.rt.com/usa/314303-burning-man-fbi-spying/|publisher=RT|accessdate=September 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Black Rock City Design Evolution&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://burningman.org/timeline/#!/1986|title=Timeline – Burning Man}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://journal.burningman.org/2010/04/black-rock-city/building-brc/designing-black-rock-city/|title=Designing Black Rock City|work=Burning Man Journal|access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==

=== 1986–1991 ===
From the very beginning on Baker Beach, to 1991 when Burning Man was set into its desert home, there was no real organizational structure to the city. According to Rod Garret, designer of Black Rock City, "The original form of the camp was a circle. This was not particularly planned, but formed instinctively from the traditional campfire circle and the urge to 'circle the wagons' against the nearly boundless space." This would not work for much longer, as attendance was reaching into the hundreds, and such a large gathering would require some planning.

=== 1992–1995 ===
The [[Bureau of Land Management]] took notice of the event, and required that plans be drawn up to maintain safety. They also required the Burn to be registered as an official event. In response, four [[Cardinal direction|cardinal]] roads were added emanating from center camp. The Man was located {{Convert|100|yd|m}} West of Center camp, due to the camp being oriented with the path of the sun across the sky, as opposed to North-to-South. The center circle from the birth of the event was maintained.

In 1993, the first sound camp was opened. It was known as the Techno Ghetto, and it was located 2 miles north of Center Camp. It was not a usual theme camp, but was instead a mini hub on its own; There was a small "center camp" with a message board and [[Portable toilet|Port-a-potties]]. The center was surrounded by a circle of camping area {{Convert|1200|ft|m}} across. Six massive sound systems faced out from the circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/9avb9a/death-and-ecstasy-the-rise-and-fall-of-burning-mans-original-rave-ghetto|title=Death and Ecstasy: The Rise and Fall of Burning Man's Original Rave Ghetto|date=August 31, 2015|work=Thump|access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Techno Ghetto was placed separately to keep the 'rave' out of the main event, yet as time has progressed, music has become more and more closely tied into the core culture of Burning man, even spawning a unique genre known as Playa Tech&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.burn.life/blog/interview-with-the-founder-of-the-first-sound-camp-at-burning-man|title=Interview with the founder of Burning Man's first sound camp|website=Life|access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1996 ===
With the population growing to 8,000 in 1996, more structure was essential to both appease the Bureau of Land Management, and to maintain safety. A ring around Center Camp, aptly named Ring Road, was added to provide for a second circle of theme camps. In addition, the eastern section of the circle around Center camp in a cone shape was declared a "No Man's Land," devoid of all art installations and campsites. The goal was to provide a picturesque view from Center Camp of The Man in the distance. In addition to the camps circling the Center, there were also camps lining the outside of the No Man's Land cone.

The techno ghetto would remain for one last year in 1996, and it wouldn't return. Regardless, the spark of music had ignited, and many other sound camps would follow.

=== 1997 ===
In 1997 Burning Man was relocated. The event moved off of the [[Black Rock Desert|Playa]] to the [[Hualapai Flat]], due to political problems with [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe County]]. Black Rock City truly became a city in 1997, with formal, labeled streets, zoning, and registration for vehicles and theme camps. Rod Garret was brought on board as the lead designer of Black Rock City from then on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.burn.life/1997-2000-maturation.html|title=Burning Man 1997–2000|website=Life|access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his design, Center Camp remained the starting point, with two angular arms reaching out on either side to form a shallow "V" shape around the Man. These main arms consisted of six annular roads, and two outlying plazas. 1997 is the first year of a Ranger-patrolled perimeter, and also the first year of one entry gate.

=== 1998 ===
Burning Man returned to the playa in 1998, and the basis of the modern layout was implemented. The idea was to "recreate some of the intimacy of our original camping circle, but on a much larger civic scale." Rod Garret's design smoothed out the angular "V" from 1997 and implemented the arc, although in 1998, it stretched less than half-way around the circle. The radial streets were numbered North 1–20 and South 1–20, instead of the modern clock face system of names such as 11:30 or 5:15. There were four large plazas, each occupied by a major theme camp.

=== 1999–2010 ===
In 1999, for the '''Wheel of Time''' theme, the great arc of the city was expanded to the full 240° (2/3 of a circle) that it is today. The streets were re-numbered to correspond to a [[clock face]], with the Man in the center, Center Camp at 6:00, and streets every 30 minutes (15°) 2:00 through 10:00.

2000 saw the introduction of the Temple as a fixture on the playa, and it has grown to be easily as important as the Man. It was placed at 12:00 out in the deep playa in the open third of the circle. 2000 also marked the year that the concept of a loud side and a quiet side was replaced by the rule that large scale sound camps would be placed at the 10:00 and 2:00 edges, facing out into the deep playa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://burningman.org/culture/history/brc-history/afterburn/06-2/history/|title=History {{!}} Burning Man|website=''burningman.org''|access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extra annular streets have been added as need has increased.

=== 2011–present ===
In 2011, extra radial streets were added from G street out to make outer-city navigation easier. These streets were added at intervals of fifteen minutes. By September 2018, Burning Man's founders created a commerce-free economy for 70,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/29/why-you-cant-buy-food-or-supplies-at-burning-man-2018.html|title=How Burning Man's founders created a commerce-free economy for 70,000 people|last=Jr.|first=Tom Huddleston|date=2018-08-29|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
{{see also|Black Rock Desert#Transportation}}

===Road access===
[[Nevada State Route 34|Highway 34]] provides access to the main entrance to Black Rock City. The highway connects to [[Nevada State Route 447|Highway 447]] north of [[Gerlach, Nevada|Gerlach]], which then runs south to [[Nevada State Route 447|Highway 427]] in [[Wadsworth, Nevada|Wadsworth]] near [[Interstate 80 in Nevada|Interstate 80]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=January 2008 |title=Nevada State Maintained Highways: Descriptions, Index and Maps |publisher=Roadway Systems Division |url=http://www.nevadadot.com/reports_pubs/state_maintained/pdf/sm_book.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=28 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109231856/https://www.nevadadot.com/reports_pubs/state_maintained/pdf/sm_book.pdf |archivedate=November 9, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vehicles then proceed from the Highway 34 entrance north to the main gate via Gate Road, a desert dirt road with a speed limit of 10&amp;nbsp;mph. All vehicles driving into the city must have the appropriate vehicle pass, and all occupants are required to have valid ticket, in order to get in. Vehicles are also searched for any items that are prohibited in the city. For those who have their tickets held at Will Call, the booths are located between the Highway 34 entrance and the main gate. All tickets and vehicle passes must be bought in advance; they are not directly sold outside the gate or at the Will Call booths.&lt;ref name="Gate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://burningman.org/event/preparation/getting-there-and-back/gate/ |title=Getting In: The Gate |publisher=Burning Man |accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ticketsupport.burningman.org/customer/en/portal/articles/1391724-will-tickets-be-sold-at-the-gate-to-black-rock-city- |title=Will tickets be sold at the gate to Black Rock City? |publisher=Burning Man |accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, unless they have a valid early arrival pass for the pre-event set up, any vehicle who arrives before the gate opens is turned away and told to go back to Reno, and not to wait along the side of the road on either Highways 34 or 447 (which would be a safety hazard), nor stay in Gerlach (and overcrowd the small town).&lt;ref name="Gate"/&gt;

[[File:Exodus from burning man (28889204623).jpg|thumb|right|200px|'Exodus' from Black Rock City in 2016]]
When the Burning Man ends, and the mass exodus out of Black Rock City begins, a [[road traffic control]] procedure called "Pulsing" is used to direct vehicles out of the city. At regular intervals (usually an hour during the peak periods), all vehicles are "pulsed" forward all at once for about a mile along Gate Road. This allows vehicles to stop and turn off their engines, while those at southernmost mile of the multi-lane Gate Road slowly merge and then turn onto the [[Single carriageway|two-lane]] Highway 34.&lt;ref name="Exodus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://burningman.org/event/preparation/getting-there-and-back/exodus/ |title=Getting Out: Exodus |publisher=Burning Man |accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial airports===
The airport with regular commercial service closest to the event is the [[Reno-Tahoe International Airport]] in [[Reno]], Nevada, over two hours' drive away. An airport spokesperson said in 2009 that 15,000 burners arrive to the event via the airport annually, making it the second-busiest time for them.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} In 2008 and 2009, an information desk for burners was organized in Reno airport.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

[[San Francisco International Airport]], nearly six hours away by car, is the nearest airport with a [[Busiest airports in the United States by international passenger traffic|high volume of international service]].

===Temporary airstrip===
A section of the Playa is used for a non-permanent airport, which is set up before each event and completely erased afterward.&lt;ref name="Brandon Hartley"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://anotherworldblog.wordpress.com/2011/08/06/129/ | title=Burning Man Airport | publisher=AWB | author=Hartley, Brandon | accessdate=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves both general aviation and charter flights. Pilots began camping there about 1995, and once compelled to add structure, it was established in a form acceptable to the BLM in 1999 through the efforts of Tiger Tiger (Lissa Shoun) and LLC board member Mr. Klean (Will Roger).  In 2009 it was recognized by the FAA as a private airport and designated 88NV. It is found on the Klamath Falls [[sectional chart|Sectional]], using a [[Common Traffic Advisory Frequency|CTAF]] of 122.9&amp;nbsp;MHz. Black Rock [[UNICOM]] and the airport are operational on that [[Radio frequency|frequency]] from 6:00&amp;nbsp;am to 7:30&amp;nbsp;pm PDT each day during the event.  The [[runway]] is simply a compacted strip of playa, and is not lighted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.burningman.com/on_the_playa/airport/airport.html |title=On The Playa |publisher=Burning Man |accessdate=31 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509040545/http://www.burningman.com/on_the_playa/airport/airport.html |archivedate=May 9, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the unique air traffic and safety issues associated with the airport, pilots are strongly encouraged to familiarize themselves with published information and procedures provided by, for example, [[Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association|AOPA]]. Because of the changes of the surface each year, information about the airport is subject to change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aopa.org/airports/88NV |title=Black Rock City Airport |publisher=AOPA |accessdate=5 December 2014}}[]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shuttles===
There are prepaid shuttles, originating in Reno and San Francisco, that move participants to and from the event. During the event there is also a paid shuttle between the event and the nearby towns of Gerlach and Empire. Exiting and reentering the event requires an additional fee, and is highly discouraged.

===Other===
Participants also share rides&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rideshare.burningman.com/ |title=rideshare.burningman.com |publisher=Burning Man|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hitchhike]].

=="Leave No Trace" policy==
[[File:Moop on the Playa.jpg|thumb|A collection of MOOP (Matter Out of Place), 2003]]

Burning Man takes place in the middle of a large [[Dry lake|playa]], and while not inhabited by humans itself, the area around the playa is home to many animals and plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://festivalessentials.net/resources/Burning_Man_EA_06-10.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416182424/http://festivalessentials.net/resources/Burning_Man_EA_06-10.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-04-16|title=Burning Man 2006–2010 Environmental Assessment}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of Burning Man point out that participants are encouraged to [[leave no trace]] (LNT) of their visit to Black Rock City (BRC) and not to contaminate the area with litter, commonly known as MOOP (Matter Out of Place). Despite the BLM and [[Black Rock City, LLC|LLC]]'s insistence on the practice of LNT, the amount of residual trash at the site has increased over the years, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;[t]he number of items per plot in the City consistently increased over the 2006 to 2009 ... Although the observed trend was not statistically significant, regression analysis indicated that the predicted trend explained over 97% of the variance in the data.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Land Management. [http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/nv/field_offices/winnemucca_field_office/nca_pdfs.Par.97441.File.dat/2009_Burning_Man_Inspection_Memo.pdf Burning Man Post-Event Inspection, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031055950/http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/nv/field_offices/winnemucca_field_office/nca_pdfs.Par.97441.File.dat/2009_Burning_Man_Inspection_Memo.pdf |date=31 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While fire is a primary component of many art exhibits and events, materials must be burned on a burn platform.&lt;ref name="burningman.com" /&gt; From 1990 through 1999, burning was allowed to take place directly on the surface of the playa, but this left burn scars (fired pinkish clay-like playa surface). When it was finally determined that they did not dissipate with the annual winter rains and flooding, in 2000, the organization declared that fires had to be elevated from the playa surface for its protection. When it was discovered by two of the founders of the Friends of Black Rock / High Rock (Garth Elliott &amp; Sue Weeks) and BLM Winnemucca district director Terry Reid that Burn scars from prior sites (numbering 250) still remained, they were finally eradicated in 2000 by the DPW clean up crew headed by Dan Miller.

On the last day of the event, public shared burn areas are prepared for participants to use. It is an ongoing educational process each year to inform the public not to burn toxic materials for the protection of the environment and participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burningman.com/environment/resources/burning.html |title=Resources – Burn Effects |publisher=Burning Man |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burningman.com/preparation/event_survival/toxic.html |title=Preparation |publisher=Burning Man |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even [[gray water]] is not to be dumped on the playa, and used shower water must be captured and either evaporated off, or collected and carried home with each participant or disposed of by roving septic-pumping trucks, which also service RVs. Methods used for evaporating water normally include a plastic sheet with a wood frame.

The [[Bureau of Land Management]], which maintains the desert, has very strict requirements for the event. These stipulations include trash cleanup, removal of burn scars, dust abatement, and capture of fluid drippings from participant vehicles.  For four weeks after the event has ended, the Black Rock City Department of Public Works (BRC – DPW) Playa Restoration Crew remains in the desert, cleaning up after the temporary city in an effort to make sure that no evidence of the event remains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nv.blm.gov/Winnemucca/NEPA/burningman/burningman.htm Bureau of Land Management] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525050812/http://www.nv.blm.gov/Winnemucca/NEPA/burningman/burningman.htm |date=May 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
===Negative effects on the environment===
[[File:Burning Man 2014 (15128868536).jpg|thumb|right|220px|The man burns at Burning Man 2014]]
Burning Man's carbon footprint is primarily from transportation to the remote area.  The CoolingMan organization{{clarify|date=September 2015}}  has estimated that the 2006 Burning Man was responsible for the generation of 27,000 tons of carbon dioxide, with 87% being from transportation to and from the remote location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coolingman.org/learn_more/burning_man_estimated_climate_impact.html |title=Cooling Man |publisher=Cooling Man |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Sierra Club]] has criticized Burning Man for the "hundreds of thousands" of plastic water bottles that end up in landfills, as well as ostentatious displays of flames and explosions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/200807/burningman.asp |title=The Sierra Club |publisher=The Sierra Club |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burning Man's 2007 theme, "Green Man", received criticism for the artwork ''Crude Awakening'', a 99-foot oil derrick that consumed 900 gallons of jet fuel and 2,000 gallons of liquid propane to blast a mushroom cloud 300 feet high into the sky.&lt;ref&gt;Jolia Sidona Allen (May 2008) [http://commongroundmag.com/2008/05/greenparty0805.html "Green Party",] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612084300/http://commongroundmag.com/2008/05/greenparty0805.html |date=June 12, 2008 }} ''Common Ground Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elsa Wenzel (September 17, 2007) [http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9778777-7.html "How green was Burning Man?"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Doherty (August 2007) [http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2007/08/crude-awakening.html "Crude Awakening Arises at Burning Man"], Wired Blog Network Underwire&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to offset some of the event's carbon footprint, 30- and 50-[[Wikt:kilowatt|kilowatt]] [[solar array]]s were constructed in 2007 as permanent artifacts, providing an estimated annual [[carbon offset]] of 559 tons.&lt;ref name=SciAm2007/&gt; The [[Burn Clean Project]] is a volunteer organization that has helped replace the use of [[fossil fuel]] with [[biodiesel]].

===Gentrification===
Burning Man has attracted a number of billionaires and celebrities, many of them from [[Silicon Valley]] and Hollywood.&lt;ref name="NYT20140821"/&gt; It has become a networking event for them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/style/article/Burning-Man-becomes-a-hot-spot-for-tech-titans-4756482.php | title=Burning Man becomes a hot spot for tech titans | first=Nellie | last= Bowles | work=San Francisco Chronicle | date=August 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Tesla Motors]] CEO [[Elon Musk]] once stating that Burning Man "''is'' Silicon Valley".&lt;ref name="NYT20140821"/&gt;

These billionaires have paid for more luxurious camps to be set up in recent years. Derisively nicknamed "plug-n-play" or "turnkey" camps, they in general consist of lavish RV's and luxury restroom trailers that are driven into the city and connected together to form ''de facto'' gated areas. These billionaires then fly in to the airport on private planes, are driven to their camps, served by hired help (nicknamed "sherpas"), and sleep in air-conditioned beds.&lt;ref name="NYT20140821"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/21/fashion/at-burning-man-the-tech-elite-one-up-one-another.html | title=A Line Is Drawn in the Desert | first=Nick | last=Bilton | newspaper=The New York Times | date=August 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One venture capitalist billionaire threw a $16,500-per-head party at his camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.salon.com/2015/08/27/why_the_rich_love_burning_man_partner/ | title=Why the rich love Burning Man | first=Keith | last=Spencer | work=Jacobin | date=August 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite allowing the rich to participate in Burning Man per the "radical inclusion" principle, many traditional Burners have spoken out against their exclusive practices.&lt;ref name="Telegram-parasites"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/04/revolution-against-rich-parasites-at-utopian-burning-man-festiva/ | title=Revolution against 'rich parasites' at utopian Burning Man Festival as 'hooligans' attack luxury camp | first=Nick | last=Allen | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=September 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larry Harvey wrote that they also conflict with the "radical self-reliance" and other principles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/burning-man-airport-helicopter-rides-2016-9 | title=Burning Man has a temporary airport for the 1% who take luxury helicopter rides to the playa | first=Leanna | last=Garfield | work=Business Insider | date=September 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has also stated that permitting the wealthy to attend is still beneficial for Burning Man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-05/occupy-burning-man-class-warfare-comes-to-desert-festival | title=The Billionaires at Burning Man | work=Bloomberg Business Week | date=February 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vandalism that occurred at the White Ocean sound camp in 2016 was said to have been a "revolution" against these attendees, describing them as being a "parasite class" or "rich parasites".&lt;ref name="Telegram-parasites"/&gt;&lt;ref name="time-vandals"&gt;{{cite web|title=Burning Man Camp Attacked by Vandals Over Outrage at 'Parasite Class'|url=http://time.com/4479210/burning-man-camp-white-ocean/|website=Time|accessdate=September 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rgj-parasitevandal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Burning Man plug-n-play camp vandalized|url=http://www.rgj.com/story/life/arts/burning-man/2016/09/02/burning-man-plug-n-play-camp-vandalized/89796020/|website=Reno Gazette Journal|accessdate=September 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the regular admission price has increased over the years. In addition, Nevada lawmakers have modified the state's entertainment and sales tax code to include such nonprofit organizations like Burning Man that sell more than 15,000 tickets. As a result, an individual ticket (including taxes) cost $424 in 2016. Even tickets sold under Burning Man's low income program are subject to these taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/feb/09/burning-man-festival-ticket-prices-state-tax-black-rock-desert | title=Burning Man tickets just got even more expensive thanks to new Nevada tax | first=Sam | last=Levin | work=The Guardian | date=February 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Including transportation, food, camp fees, clothing and costumes, and gifts, [[CNBC]] estimated in 2016 that the total cost of attending could range from $1,300 up to $20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/25/how-to-enjoy-burning-man-without-burning-your-cash.html | title=How to enjoy Burning Man without burning your cash | first=Tom | last=Anderson | publisher=CNBC | date=August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, ''[[Money (magazine)|Money]]'' magazine estimated an average total cost of $2,348 to attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://time.com/money/4867493/burning-man-how-much-it-costs/ | title=How Much It Really Costs to Go to Burning Man This Year | first=Megan | last=Leonhardt | work='[[Money (magazine)|Money]] | date=August 3, 2017 | accessdate=August 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the racial makeup of Burning Man attendees in 2014, about 87 percent of them identified themselves as white, 6 percent as Hispanic/Latino, 6 percent as Asian, and 1 percent as black. When interviewed by ''[[The Guardian]]'' about these figures, Harvey replied, "I don't think black folks like to camp as much as white folks ... We're not going to set racial quotas ... This has never been, imagined by us, as a utopian society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/sep/04/burning-man-founder-larry-harvey-race-diversity-silicon-valley| title=Burning Man founder: 'Black folks don't like to camp as much as white folks' | first=Steven | last=Thrasher | work=The Guardian | date=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photography restrictions===
[[File:Burning Man 2011 - the man burns.webm|thumb|thumbtime=00:10|Video of the 'man' sculpture burning in 2011]]
The terms of the Burning Man ticket require that participants wishing to use photo and video-recording equipment share a joint copyright of their images of Black Rock City with Burning Man, and forbid them from using their images for commercial purposes. This has been criticized by many, including the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burningman.com/media/doc/preparation/event_survival/09_PUA.pdf|title=Video/DV/Film/Digital Camera Personal Use Agreement Burning Man 2009|accessdate=22 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220191502/http://www.burningman.com/media/doc/preparation/event_survival/09_PUA.pdf|archivedate=February 20, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/08/snatching-rights-playa |title=Snatching Rights on the Playa &amp;#124; Electronic Frontier Foundation |publisher=Eff.org |date=August 12, 2009 |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Burning Man spokeswoman replied that the policies are not new, were written by a former head of the EFF, were used when suing to block pornographic videos and ultimately arose from participant concerns: "We're proud that Black Rock City (a private event held on public land) is widely acknowledged as a bastion of creative freedom. [B]ut that protection [of participants' freedoms] does necessitate the acceptance of some general terms of engagement when it comes to cameras ... EFF seems to think that anyone attending any event somehow has an absolute right to take photographs, and then to do whatever they want with those images without any effective restriction or manner of enforcement. While we believe that such rights do make sense for any of us taking pictures in purely public spaces, this is not true in the private space of Burning Man – if it were it would mean that Burning Man couldn't protect participant privacy or prevent commercialization of imagery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.burningman.com/?p=4599 |title=Burning Blog " Blog Archive " "Snatching Digital Rights" or Protecting Our Culture? Burning Man and the EFF |publisher=Burning Man |date=August 14, 2009 |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Burning Man organization has since worked with the EFF and with [[Creative Commons]] and other parties, and has revised and clarified the photography policies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.burningman.com/digital-rights/updated-terms-and-conditions-for-2011/ Updated Terms and Conditions for 2011].

==Regional events==
{{See also|List of regional Burning Man events}}
[[File:Afrika Burns, South Africa (2122918628).jpg|thumb|A camp at a regional burn in South Africa]]
The popularity of Burning Man has encouraged other groups and organizations to hold events similar to Burning Man.

Burners have created smaller regional events modeled on Burning Man, such as [[Burning Flipside]] in Texas; [[Apogaea]] in Colorado; [[Playa del Fuego]] in Delaware; [[Firefly Arts Collective|Firefly]] in New England; [[Kiwiburn]] in New Zealand; [[Burning Seed]] in Australia; [[Transformus]] in North Carolina; [[AfrikaBurn]] in South Africa; [[Nowhere (event)|NoWhere]] near [[Zaragoza]] in Spain; [[Midburn]] in Israel; and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://regionals.burningman.org/|title=Regionals {{!}} Welcome home!|website=regionals.burningman.org|access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the events are officially affiliated with the Burning Man organization via the Burning Man Regional Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://regionals.burningman.com/ |title=regionals.burningman.com |publisher=Burning Man |accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This official affiliation usually requires the event to conform to the 10 principles and certain standards outlined by the Burning Man organization and to be accompanied by a "Burning Man Regional Contact," a volunteer with an official relationship to the Burning Man Project via a legal Letter of Agreement. In exchange for conforming to these standards, the event is granted permission to officially communicate itself as a Burning Man Regional Event. Also, the regional event organizers are enabled to exchange best practices with each other on a global level via online platforms and in-person conferences, which are partly sponsored by the Burning Man Project.

'''Feasts of Jesus Christ''' are specific days of the year distinguished in the [[liturgical calendar]] as being significant days for the celebration of events in the life of [[Jesus]] [[Christ (title)|Christ]] and his veneration, for the commemoration of his relics, signs and miracles. While [[Easter]] is treated everywhere as the central religious feast in the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[liturgical year]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Aveni | first = Anthony | title = "The Easter/Passover Season: Connecting Time's Broken Circle", ''The Book of the Year: A Brief History of Our Seasonal Holidays'' | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 2004 | pages = 64–78 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4Mmmvol6DvkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q= | isbn = 0-19-517154-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the other feasts differ in the liturgical practice.

== Feast days of Jesus in the Catholic Church ==
Since the Second Vatican Council, the [[General Roman Calendar|Catholic liturgical calendar]] distinguishes four ranks of celebrations: solemnities, feasts, memorials, and optional memorials. Most of the celebrations of events in the life of Christ are ranked as solemnities. However, there are a few celebrations related to titles or mysteries of Christ which are ranked as feasts, and these are known collectively as "Feasts of the Lord." In the current General Calendar from the Third Edition of the Roman Missal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Roman Missal Third Edition|year=2011|publisher=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9780814633755|url=http://www.litpress.org/Detail.aspx?ISBN=9780814633755}}&lt;/ref&gt; these are:
* The [[Holy Family]] of Jesus, Mary and Joseph, celebrated on the Sunday between December 25 and January 1, or if there is no Sunday in that range (when December 25 and January 1 fall on Sundays), on December 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Norms for the Liturgical Year and the Calendar|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CDWLITYR.HTM|publisher=Congregation for Divine Worship|accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ordo Lectionum Missae, Editio Typica Altera (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Baptism of the Lord]], celebrated on the Sunday after January 6 (or, where the Solemnity of the Epiphany is transferred to the Sunday that occurs on January 7 or 8, on the following Monday)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Norms for the Liturgical Year and the Calendar|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CDWLITYR.HTM|publisher=Congregation for Divine Worship|accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Presentation of the Lord]], celebrated on 2 February
* The [[Transfiguration of the Lord]], celebrated on 6 August
* The [[Exaltation of the Holy Cross]], celebrated on 14 September
* The [[Dedication of the Lateran Basilica]], celebrated on 9 November (this is a feast of the Lord because the basilica is dedicated to him under the title of the ''Most Holy Saviour'').

In the pre-Vatican II usage, the term ''feast'' denoted any celebration, not just a specific rank. Hence, also celebrations which are today termed solemnities of the Lord (e.g. Christmas, Easter, Pentecost, Christ the King) were once deemed Feasts of the Lord.

== Feast days of Jesus in the Orthodox Church ==
Three main categories of feasts, distinguished in the Orthodox liturgical practice, namely
* Feasts of the [[Lord Jesus Christ]] ({{lang-ru|Господские праздники}}, or {{lang-ru|Владычные праздники}})
* Feasts of the [[Theotokos]] ({{lang-ru|Богородичные праздники}}; by definition same to [[Marian feast days]], the actual set differs between Catholic and Orthodox Churches)
* Feasts of [[Saints]]

While Easter is treated as Feast of Feasts, the following eight feasts of Christ are assigned the highest rank of the [[Great Feasts of the Orthodox Church|Great Feasts]] in the [[Eastern Orthodox]]&lt;!-- and [[Greek-Catholic]]--&gt; liturgical calendars:
* [[Feast of the Cross]] — 14 (27) September
* [[Christmas]] — 25 December (7 January)
* [[Baptism of Jesus]] — 6 (19) January
* [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple]] — 2 (15) February
* [[Palm Sunday]] — ([[Moveable feast]])
* [[Ascension of Jesus]] — ([[Moveable feast]])
* [[Pentecost]] — ([[Moveable feast]])
* [[Transfiguration of Jesus]] — 6 (19) August

The '''''Grande Semaine d'Aviation de la Champagne''''' was an [[aviation meet]] held near [[Reims]] in [[France]] during August [[1909 in aviation|1909]]. It was the first international public flying event and was seen both at the time&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1909/1909%20-%200514.html "Conversion by Sight"] [[Flight International|''Flight'']] 28 August 1909 p.516  "Throughout the past week the greatest object-lesson and the most convincing that has been afforded yet concerning the achievement of mechanical flight has been in almost continuous progress at Rheims"&lt;/ref&gt; and by later historians&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aviation|last=Gibbs-Smith|first= C.H.|publisher=NMSO|location=London|year=2003|isbn= 1 9007 4752 9  |page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; as  marking the coming of age of heavier-than-air aviation.  Almost all of the prominent aviators of the time took part, and the 500,000&lt;ref&gt;Hallion 2003&lt;/ref&gt; visitors included [[Armand Fallières]], the President of the French Republic and the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[David Lloyd George]].

[[file:L'Illustration les tribunes de Betheny.jpg|thumb|Tribunes from the sky .]]
The ''Grand Semaine d'Aviation'', held between 22 August and 29 August 1909, was  sponsored by many of the leading makers of [[champagne]] including [[Moët et Chandon]] and [[Mumm]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hallion|first=Richard P.|title = Taking Flight|page=258|year =2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York| isbn= 0 19516035 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and organised by a committee headed by the [[Marquis de Polignac]]&lt;!--with  aid of support of [[Henry de La Vaulx|Compte de la Vaulx]]--&gt;.  It was held on the [[plain]] of [[Bétheny]], about {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} north of Reims, which later became the [[Reims – Champagne Air Base]]. A  large grandstand  was constructed for the event, together with a row of sheds to accommodate the aircraft. Next to the grandstand was the "Popular enclosure", complete with an enormous scoreboard.  Amenities for the spectators included a restaurant that could seat 600 people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Times|location=London|title= The Success of the Meeting|date=13 August 1909 | page=7,col.2|issue=39037}}&lt;/ref&gt; an area of specially laid lawn with bandstands and flowerbeds, and a post office, from which 50,000 postcards were sent each day and nearly a million words dispatched  by press correspondents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1909/1909%20-%200557.html Cash Receipts at Rheims][[Flight International|'Flight]] 11 September 1911&lt;/ref&gt;  The spectator area was only a few hundred metres from the Laon-Reims railway line, and a temporary  station was provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Blériot: Herald Of An Age|last=Elliott|first=Brian A|publisher=Arcadia  |location=Stroud, Gloucestershire|year=2000|isbn = 0 7524 1739 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A rectangular competition course of {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}}, marked by four pylons was set up for the various competitions, with the strip intended for taking off and landing in front of the grandstands, opposite which was the timekeepers hut, provided with a signalling system to indicate to the spectators which event was being competed for.  Flying conditions were primitive: the area over which much of the flying was to take place was farmland: some of the crops under cultivation had not been harvested and where this had been done there were [[haystack]]s:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=21 August 1909 |title=The Rheims Aviation Week |journal=The Times |location=London |issue=39044 |pages= 6|url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; more than one flyer was to fall foul of these obstacles.

====The Gordon Bennett Trophy====
This was the most prestigious event of the meeting, and was a competition between national teams, sponsored by [[James Gordon Bennett, Jr.|Gordon Bennett]], the publisher of the [[New York Herald]] and was being held for the first time. It consisted of a time trial over two laps of the {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} circuit rather than a direct race, and each nation was allowed three entrants.  The qualification trials for the French team on the Sunday morning were hampered by the weather conditions, with the most successful competitor, [[Eugène Lefebvre]] flying a French-built [[Wright Model A|Wright biplane]], narrowly failing to complete two laps of the course: the only other pilot to make a convincing flight was [[Louis Blériot]], and the third place was later given to [[Hubert Latham]] flying an [[Antoinette VII|Antoinette monoplane]], on account of his performance in trials for the Prix de la Vitesse held later that day, during which "the wonderful and unprecedented spectacle was witnessed of seven machines in the air at one time".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1909/1909%20-%200517.html "Rheims Aviation Week: The First Day"] [[Flight International|''Flight'']] 28 August 1909 p519&lt;/ref&gt;  Other nations were represented by the [[United States|America]]n aviator [[Glenn Curtiss]] and [[George Bertram Cockburn|George Cockburn]] flying a French [[Farman III]] biplane representing [[Great Britain]]: promised Italian and Austrian entries did not materialise. On the Saturday of the race Curtiss made the first flights, first  making an attempt for the Circuit Prize and lowering the record to 7&amp;nbsp;m 55.4&amp;nbsp;s.  Encouraged by this, he then made his attempt for the Trophy, completing the two laps in 15&amp;nbsp;m 50.4&amp;nbsp;s.  Cockburn made the next attempt, but was unable to complete one lap. Lefebvre then made the first attempt by the French team, only managing a time of 20&amp;nbsp;m&amp;nbsp;47.6&amp;nbsp;s. Latham's time was 16&amp;nbsp;m 32&amp;nbsp;s. Blériot, flying last, managed a first lap time in the same time as Curtiss' second (faster) lap, but during the second round he was impeded by a [[squall]], and his total time was 15&amp;nbsp;min 56.1&amp;nbsp;sec. Under the rules of the Trophy, Curtiss' victory meant that the next race would be held in America. Later in the day Blériot did secure one prize, that for the fastest circuit, with a time of 7&amp;nbsp;m 47.4&amp;nbsp;s.&lt;ref name=results&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1909/1909%20-%200534.html "Tabulated Performances &amp;c of the Rheims Meeting"] [[Flight International|''Flight'']] 4 September 1909 p.53&lt;/ref&gt;

====Grand Prix de Champagne et la Ville de Reims====
This was a distance prize offering six prizes of 50,000, 25,000, 10,000, 5,000, 5,000, and 5,000 francs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1909/1909%20-%200490.html "Rheims Aviation Week"] [[Flight International|''Flight'']] 14 August 1909 p492&lt;/ref&gt;  The competition for this award resulted in the world record for distance being broken three times in three days, the prize eventually being won by [[Henri Farman]] with a flight of {{convert|180|km|mi|abbr=on}}, flying a [[Farman III]] biplane. Farman eventually landed because the competition stopped at half-past seven, and any distance flown after this time did not count. On landing, in the words of the correspondent from the London ''[[The Times|Times]]'' he was "seized upon by the enthusiastic crowd and carried in triumph to the buffet, where a scene of almost delirious excitement was witnessed"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Times|location=London|title =Aviation at Rheims|date= 28 August 1909 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although French by upbringing, Farman's father was British and he was therefore also technically British, this mixed nationality being celebrated by a military band playing both [[La Marseillaise|the French]] and [[God Save the Queen|the British]] national anthems to celebrate his victory.

Farman had replaced the Vivinus engine of his aircraft, which was proving unreliable, with a [[Gnome Omega]] [[rotary engine]] just before the flight.  Since the published rules of competition forbade any changes to the aircraft, his victory was contested by Latham and [[Léon Levavasseur]], the designer of the Antoinette aircraft and engine, but the change had been officially approved before the flight, and their complaint was not successful. The Reims meeting was the public debut of the Gnome engine, and although probably unappreciated by the majority of the spectators, this was one of the most significant events to take place at the Rheims meeting.  The Gnome, designed and manufactured by the Seguin brothers, was both light in weight and relatively reliable, and was a major advance in aviation technology: Louis Blériot later saying "it enabled the industry to advance by leaps and bounds"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hallion|first=Richard P.|title = Taking Flight|page=263|year =2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York| isbn= 0 19 516035 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three  other aircraft were flown using this engine at Reims, the others being the Farman biplanes belonging to Cockburn and [[Roger Sommer]] and the Voisin belonging to [[Louis Paulhan]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1909/1909%20-%200519.html "Rheims Aviation Meeting — Table of General Details of the Entered Machines"] [[Flight International|''Flight'']] 28 August 1909 p.521&lt;/ref&gt;

====Grand Prix de la Vitesse====
Offering four prizes of 10,000, 5,000, 3,000 and 2,000 francs, for the fastest time over three laps of the circuit. The final attempts for this were held on the last day, and after Curtiss' narrow victory over Blériot spectators were expecting an exciting duel. However, Blériot had a spectacular accident: his aircraft crashed and caught fire, and was destroyed: the prize went to Curtiss.

====Prix des Passagers====
A single prize of 10,000 francs, given to the aviator who carried the greatest number of passengers over one lap of the course: in the event of two contestant carrying the same number of passengers the prize going to the fastest. Won by Farman, the only pilot to carry two passengers.

====Prix de l'Altitude====
(Height Prize) of 10,000 francs. Won by [[Hubert Latham]] flying an [[Antoinette VII]] with an altitude of {{convert|155|m|ft|abbr=on}}

====Prix du Tour de Piste====
(Circuit Prize), of 7,000 and 3,000 francs. for the fastest single lap. Won by Louis Blériot, flying his [[Blériot XII|Type XII]] monoplane, with a speed of 76.95&amp;nbsp;kph (47.8&amp;nbsp;mph).

====Prix des Aeronauts====
A speed trial over five laps for [[dirigible]]s. No attempts were made until the last day, when the French Army dirgible ''Colonel Renard''
won with a time of 1 hr. 19 m. The only other competitor was a [[Zodiac Aerospace|Zodiac]] dirigible.

===Flyers and aircraft===

38 aircraft were entered for the event, but in the end only 23 actually flew, representing nine different types. 87 fights of more than {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} were made  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aviation|last=Gibbs-Smith|first= C.H.|publisher=NMSO|location=London|year=2003|isbn= 1 9007 4752 9 |page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The type which was best represented was the [[Voisin 1907 biplane|Voisin biplane]], of which there were seven examples flown. This reflects [[Gabriel Voisin]]'s position as the first manufacturer to achieve widespread sales of an aircraft, but by this time his design was obsolescent, the only notable achievement being [[Louis Paulhan]]'s third place in the distance competition.  Significantly, Paulhan's aircraft was fitted with a Gnome engine. The meeting effectively demonstrated the practicality of heavier than air aviation: it was evident that the major problem was the unreliability of the engines being used. Many previous notable aviation feats, such as Louis Blériot's recent crossing of the [[English Channel]], had been made near the times of sunrise or sunset, when the air is often very still.  In contrast, competition flying at Reims did not start until ten in the morning and ended at half past seven, and although high winds did cause the black flags signalling 'no flying' to be hoisted on occasion, all days saw some flying.
  
The destruction by fire of Louis Blériot's aircraft on the last day was the most spectacular accident to occur during the meeting, and Blériot had been involved in another accident earlier in the week while practising for the passenger carrying event, when he had to make an emergency landing due to engine trouble, Unfortunately there was a troop of [[dragoons]] in the way: in swerving to avoid them, he collided with the railings separating the spectator area from the flying track. The damage was repaired overnight.  At the time only one aviator had been killed in an aircraft crash, and ''Flight'' magazine could write of the "customary good luck of the aviator" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1909/1909%20-%200520.html Wednesday' Racing][[Flight International|''Flight'']] 28 August 1909&lt;/ref&gt; when referring to aviators walking away from accidents which wrecked the aircraft:  aircraft of the time were slow, generally flown at low altitudes and their wooden construction often meant that the force of impact was absorbed by the disintegration of the airframe, but within a month of the event two of the participating flyers, Lefebvre and [[Ferdinand Ferber]], were to be killed in aircraft accidents.

The '''Imrana rape case''' is the case of the [[sexual assault]] of a 28-year-old [[India]]n [[Muslim]] woman by her [[father-in-law]] on 6 June 2005 in Charthawal village in the [[Muzaffarnagar district]] [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]] (located 70&amp;nbsp;km from [[Delhi]]).  The village elders and subsequently, several levels of Islamic legal opinion regarded Imrana's marriage with her husband null, as the Sharia regards sexual relations with both the father and son as incestuous. This sparked nationwide controversy as critics argued the case was treated as adultery and not rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=50422|title= Let's be fair to Imrana|publisher=Expressindia.com|accessdate=2012-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tahir Mahmood, The legal fiction behind the controversy|url=http://www.tehelka.com/story_main13.asp?filename=Ne071605The_legal_fiction.asp|publisher=Tehelka.com}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rape and Islamic rulings==
On 6 June 2005, [[Imrana]], 28 years old at the time, and the mother of five children, was raped by her 69-year-old father-in-law Ali Mohammad.

Soon after she was raped, a local Muslim ''[[panchayat]]'' (council of elders) asked her to treat her husband Nur Ilahi as her son and declared their marriage null and void.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imrana defied the panchayat's ruling and continued living with her husband.

The leading Islamic seminary [[Darul Uloom Deoband]] also issued a ''[[fatwa]]''&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; or opinion, which quotes from Quran 4:23: ''wa la tankihoo ma nakaha aaba-o-kum'', "And
marry not women whom your fathers married", and not distinguishing between rape and adultery, said that as a result of her father-in-law's act, she should now be treated 
as the mother of her husband and she could no longer live with him even though Imrana had not married her father-in-law. She was still married to her husband when she was raped by her father in law therefore the fatwa provided by the panchayat's disregard the Islamic rulings against rape and the punishment for the rapists. Due to such fatwa Imrana is in a way being prosecuted instead of her rapist father in law as she is being ordered to leave her husband and start a life with her rapist.  The fatwa is a clarification of the ruling by the village leaders who disregarded the Islamic teachings for such cases for the sake of shunning Imrana who is thought to have brought shame to the community by having sexual intercourse with her father in law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2215/stories/20050729006512100.htm |title=Fighting for Imrana|publisher=Hinduonnet.com|accessdate=2012-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This ''fatwa'' was based on the [[Abu Hanifa]] school of [[Islamic Jurisprudence]] ([[Hanafi]] fiqh), which rules that on having sex with a man she marries, a woman has the status of mother to all his children.  The other three schools, [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], and [[Hanbali]], reject this position&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but opinions were divided between the [[Hanafi]] and [[Shafi'i]],&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; the two sunni [[fiqh]]'s mostly represented in India.

Later, the Deoband seminary denied that it has issued such a ''fatwa''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}  Nur Ilahi continued to stay with Imrana and said that "[they] neither sought advice nor counsel from Deoband. [They] have not raised the issue before clerics."

At one point, [[Uttar Pradesh]] chief minister [[Mulayam Singh Yadav]] also endorsed the view of the [[Darul Uloom]] that she can no longer live with her husband. After Imrana's case was highlighted by the national media, the [[National Commission for Women]] directed authorities in Muzaffarnagar to take action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncw.nic.in/imrana%20case.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926232328/http://ncw.nic.in/imrana%20case.pdf |date=26 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The body's chairperson [[Girija Vyas]] asked the Uttar Pradesh government to punish the guilty and sought a report on the incident.

==Arrest of father-in-law==
Police registered a case under sections 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the [[Indian Penal Code]] against Mohammed Ali and arrested him. Police also filed a case against him on 30 June 2005 with a medical report and recorded Imrana's statement before a magistrate. The court had turned down Mohammed Ali's bail plea on 5 December 2005

In a video recorded by the Muslim Political Council of India,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=T.A. Rahamani, The Imrana case, published by the Milli Gazette|url=http://www.milligazette.com/dailyupdate/2005/imrana-no-rape-video.wmv|publisher=Milligazette.com|accessdate=2012-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imrana (veiled) says that once she screamed, Mohammed Ali had run away.  On being asked again, she reiterates that the forceful attempt was not successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milligazette.com/dailyupdate/2005/20050724b.htm |title=Imrana on video - no rape|publisher=Milligazette.com|accessdate=2012-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the court took a different view based on evidence presented in the trial. 
On October 2006, Mohammed Ali was condemned to a prison term of ten years for raping Imrana. 
At one point the defense lawyer sought a leniency based on age of the defendant, but this was denied.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The judge also directed Mohammed Ali to pay compensation of [[Rupee|Rs]] 8,000 to Imrana for raping her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?NewsID=1059246 |title=DNA - India - Ali Mohammad found guilty of raping Imrana |publisher=Daily News &amp; Analysis|accessdate=2012-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the separate charge of criminal intimidation, Mohammed ali was sentenced to three years in prison and fined in Rs 3,000

==Timeline==

*'''6 June 2005:''' Ali Mohammed raped his [[daughter-in-law]] Imrana.
*'''13 June 2005:''' A local Muslim ''panchayat'' declared Imrana's marriage to Nur Ilahi void as she "had sex" with her father-in-law and asks her to treat her husband as her son, which means she would have to stop living with him.
*'''13 June 2005''': Ali Mohammed is arrested.
*'''16 June 2005''': Ali Mohammed is sent to judicial custody.
*'''30 June 2005''': The police filed cases against Ali Mohammed along with a medical report. Imrana's statement is recorded before a magistrate.

'''Innoventions''' is a museum at the [[Epcot]] theme park in [[Walt Disney World]], [[Florida]]. It focuses on technological advancements and their practical applications in everyday life. Innoventions is a [[portmanteau]] of the words "[[innovation]]" and "[[invention]]".

Innoventions first opened in 1994, replacing [[Communicore]] in Epcot. When the attraction opened, it prominently displayed [[Sega Mega Drive|Sega Genesis]], [[Sega Game Gear]], [[Sega 32X]], [[Sega Mega-CD|Sega CD]], and [[Sega Pico]] games in an arcade style. The exhibit also featured "[[virtual reality]]" displays. Epcot's version is divided into two buildings known as Innoventions East and Innoventions West. In 1999, Innoventions had a major renovation for the park's [[Walt Disney World Millennium Celebration|Millennium Celebration]], and added the subtitle "The Road to Tomorrow". In 2007-2008 Innoventions underwent another major renovation, dropped the subtitle "Road to Tomorrow," and changed its general aesthetic again while also launching the companion website ''innoventions.disney.com''. Today, Innoventions East is the only operating portion still using the Innoventions name while the building that formerly housed Innoventions West is mainly being used as the Epcot Character Spot.

== Tom Morrow 2.0 ==
[[File:Innoventions - Tom Morrow 2.0.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Tom Morrow 2.0, singing and talking about the various areas of Innoventions.]]
Epcot's Innoventions' mascot for 2000-2007 was a small [[Audio-Animatronic]] character named Tom Morrow 2.0, the former host of [[Disney Channel]]'s "Imagineer That!" shorts. He was removed in the 2007-2008 renovation. Tom Morrow 2.0 recently made an appearance at the Odyssey Building which also features [[Figment (Disney)|Figment]] from the original [[Journey into Imagination with Figment|Journey into Imagination]] ride, and one of the characters from Kitchen Kabaret.

== Area music ==
The area music played at Epcot is about 20 minutes long and begins with a musical piece by [[David Arkenstone]] entitled "Papillon (On The Wings Of The Butterfly)" from his album ''[[In the Wake of the Wind]]''. The rest of the music was composed by Russell Brower for Walt Disney Imagineering and is not commercially available. Brower, along with Arkenstone, would then compose the music for the [[World of Warcraft]] games.

The '''Jianzhuke Shu''' ({{zh|t=諫逐客書|s=谏逐客书|p=Jiànzhúkè Shū|l=Petition against the Expulsion of Guest Officers}}) was a petition to [[Qinshihuang|King Zheng of Qin]], written by [[Li Si]] in 243 BC. Written in response to an order to expel all officers serving in the [[State of Qin]] who were not born in Qin, it successfully persuaded King Zheng to rescind the expulsion order, and also began Li Si's career as a leading politician in Qin.

==Background==

During the [[Warring States period]], it was common practice for learned men whose careers might have been frustrated in their homelands to travel to other countries in search of service and patronage. Li Si himself was such an individual, having been born in the [[State of Chu]] but unable to progress in an official career there.

The initial policy of openness to outsiders changed in 244 BC, due to the controversy surrounding the [[Zhengguo Canal]]; the [[State of Han]] had dispatched [[Zheng Guo]], a skilled engineer, to Qin on the pretext of helping them build an irrigation canal. Subsequently, however, it was discovered that this was really a scheme by Han to weaken Qin by diverting its resources towards canal construction. At the instigation of a clique of officials within the Qin court, suspicion soon became widened to include all guest officers from outside Qin, and King Zheng issued an order to expel all foreigners.

Li Si, himself a foreigner, was also caught up in the purge; his petition was composed while he was being expelled from Qin. 

King Zheng finally accepted Li Si's suggestion and withdrew the order. Twenty years later, King Zheng unified ancient China and became the first Emperor of the whole China.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2222">The '''7 · 4 South  and North Korea Joint Statement''', also known as the '''July 4th North-South Joint Communiqué''', was signed on July 4, 1972, by the [[Republic of Korea]] and the [[DPRK]] government for the first time since the division of the Korean peninsula. In 1972, following the instructions of [[Park Jung-hee]], the  director of KOREA-CIA [[Lee Hu-rak]] was sent to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and met with [[Kim Il-sung]] to establish three principles of unification: 1) independence, 2) peace and 3) nation-wide unity.
It was enacted to promote international detente, declaration of the withdrawal of the [[USFK]] and reduction of Military arms competition. However, after the discussion on unification, the regime of both sides of the two Koreas was unable to proceed with the real action plan because of the instability of their political power in the country. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.go.kr/next/search/listSubjectDescription.do?id=003345  |title=  7 · 4 South and North Korea Joint Statement |publisher=archives.go.kr |date= |accessdate=2017-08-25 |language= Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kivu conflict''' began in 2004 in the eastern Congo as an armed conflict between the [[military of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (FARDC) and the [[Hutu Power]] group [[Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda]] (FDLR) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It has broadly consisted of three phases, the third of which is an ongoing conflict. Prior to March 2009, the main combatant group against the FARDC was the [[National Congress for the Defence of the People]] (CNDP). Following the cessation of hostilities between these two forces, [[List of active rebel groups|rebel]] [[Tutsi]] forces, formerly under the command of [[Laurent Nkunda]], became the dominant opposition to the government forces. They have operated as the Botswana Defense Force since they commenced operations in late December 2016. 

The [[United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo]] (MONUSCO) has played a large role in the conflict. With a 21,000-strong force, the Kivu conflict constitutes the largest peacekeeping mission currently in operation. In total, 93 peacekeepers have died in the region, with 15 dying in a large-scale attack by an [[Islamist]] militia, the [[Allied Democratic Forces]], in [[North Kivu]] in December 2017.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/08/peacekeepers-killed-in-attack-on-un-base-in-dr-congo|title=Islamist attack kills at least 15 UN peacekeepers and five soldiers in DRC|first=Jason Burke Africa|last=correspondent|date=8 December 2017|publisher=|access-date=10 December 2017|via=www.TheGuardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The peacekeeping force seeks to prevent escalation of force in the conflict, and minimise human rights abuses like sexual assault and the use of child soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=58250#.WiszCUpl_IU|title=UN News - DR Congo: Over a dozen UN peacekeepers killed in worst attack on ‘blue helmets’ in recent history|first=United Nations News Service|last=Section|date=8 December 2017|website=UN News Service Section|access-date=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CNDP is sympathetic to the [[Banyamulenge]] in Eastern Congo, an ethnic [[Tutsi]] group, and to the Tutsi-dominated government of neighboring [[Rwanda]]. It was opposed by the [[Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda]] (FDLR), by the DRC army, and by United Nations forces.

==Background==
{{Main|Second Congo War}}

Laurent Nkunda was an officer in the rebel [[Rally for Congolese Democracy]] (RCD), [[Goma]] faction in the [[Second Congo War]] (1998–2002). In 2003, when that war officially ended, Nkunda joined the new integrated national army of the [[Transitional Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|transitional government]] as a [[colonel]] and was promoted to general in 2004. He soon rejected the authority of the government and retreated with some of [[RCD-Goma]] troops to the [[Masisi]] forests in [[Nord Kivu]].&lt;ref name="hrw"&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2006/01/31/congo12579.htm "D.R. Congo: Arrest Laurent Nkunda For War Crimes"], ''Human Rights Watch News'', 2006-02-01&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Global Witness]] says that Western companies sourcing minerals were buying them from traders who finance both rebel and government troops. Minerals such as [[cassiterite]], gold or [[coltan]], which is used for electronic equipment and cell phones, are an important [[export]] for the Congo. A UN resolution stated that anyone supporting illegal Congolese armed groups through illicit trade of natural resources should be subjected to sanctions including travel restrictions and an assets freeze.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The extent of the problem is not known.&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Zaire 97 kivus.jpg|thumb|left|Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo map.]]

===2004 Bukavu offensive===
Later in 2004, Shmank's{{who|date=February 2018}} forces began clashing with the DRC army in [[Sud-Kivu]] and by May 2004, occupied [[Bukavu]], where he was accused of committing war crimes.&lt;ref name="indp"&gt;[http://news.independent.co.uk/world/africa/article41111.ece "Rebel troops capture Bukavu and threaten third Congo war"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110110447/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/africa/article41111.ece |date=10 January 2008 }}, ''[[The Independent]]'', 2004-06-03&lt;/ref&gt; Nkunda claimed he was attempting to prevent genocide against the [[Banyamulenge]], who are ethnic [[Tutsi]] resident in the eastern DRC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=42990 "DRC: Interview with rebel general Laurent Nkunda"], ''[[IRIN]]'', 2006-09-02&lt;/ref&gt; This claim was rejected by the [[MONUSCO|UN Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (MONUSCO),&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050909163224/http://www.irinnews.org/print.asp?ReportID=41738 "DRC: UN preliminary report rules out genocide in Bukavu"], ''[[IRIN]]'', 2004-01-17&lt;/ref&gt; and they also denied the claim that Nkunda was following orders from Rwanda. Following UN negotiations which secured the withdrawal of Nkunda's troops from Bukavu to the Masisi forests, part of his army split. Led by Colonel Jules Mutebusi, it left for Rwanda.&lt;ref name="indp"/&gt; About 150,000 [[Kinyarwanda]]-speaking people (of Nkunda's own language group) were reported to have fled from Sud-Kivu to [[Nord-Kivu]] in fear of reprisal attacks by DRC army.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060317045003/http://www.irinnews.org/print.asp?ReportID=43167 "DRC: Government troops seize rebel stronghold, general says"], ''[[IRIN]]'', 2004-09-14&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005 clashes with DRC army===
In 2005, Nkunda called for the overthrow of the government due to its corruption, and increasing numbers of RCD-Goma soldiers deserted the DRC army to join his forces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060829131537/http://www.diacritica.com/sobaka/newswire/2005/09/0916005b.html "Nkunda Building Forces: Rebel General Draws on More Deserting Troops"], ''[[Sobaka magazine|Sobaka]]'', 2005-09-16&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006===
In January 2006, Nkunda's troops clashed with DRC army forces, who had also been accused of war crimes by the MONUC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/RMOI-6N33K7?OpenDocument&amp;rc=1&amp;cc=cod "DRC: Human rights situation in Feb 2006"], ''MONUC'', 18 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Further clashes took place during August 2006 around the town of [[Sake, DRC|Sake]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sabcnews.com/africa/central_africa/0,2172,132552,00.html "Rebel troops clash with army in eastern Congo"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929121636/http://www.sabcnews.com/africa/central_africa/0,2172,132552,00.html |date=29 September 2007 }}, ''[[South African Broadcasting Corporation|SABC]]'', 5 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; MONUC, however, refused to arrest Nkunda after an international arrest warrant was issued against him, stating that: "Mr Laurent Nkunda does not present a threat to the local population, thus we cannot justify any action against him."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=49207 "DRC: No plan to arrest dissident ex-general"], ''[[IRIN]]'', 23 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; As late as June 2006, Nkunda became subject to [[United Nations Security Council]] restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/Docs/sc/committees/DRC/1533_list.htm "List of individuals and entities subject to the measures imposed by paragraph 13 and 15 of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1596 (2005), pursuant to Resolution 1533 (2004)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110045715/http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/committees/DRC/1533_list.htm |date=10 January 2008 }}, ''[[United Nations Security Council]]'', 5 November 2005 – 6 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

During both the first and second rounds of the contested and violent [[Democratic Republic of the Congo general election, 2006|2006 general election]], Nkunda had said that he would respect the results.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=54891&amp;SelectRegion=Great_Lakes "DRC: Interview with Jacqueline Chenard, spokeswoman for MONUC in Kivu North"], ''[[IRIN]]'', 2006-07-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/7adfe242-2632-11db-afa1-0000779e2340.html "Congo’s rebel leader watches and waits"], ''[[Financial Times]]'', 2006-08-07&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sabcnews.com/africa/central_africa/0,2172,137414,00.html "DRC rebel leader commits to peace"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929124117/http://www.sabcnews.com/africa/central_africa/0,2172,137414,00.html |date=29 September 2007 }}, ''[[South African Broadcasting Corporation|SABC]]'', 2006-10-27&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 November, however, a day before the Supreme Court ruled that [[Joseph Kabila]] had won the presidential election's second round, Nkunda's forces undertook [[Democratic Republic of the Congo general election, 2006#Offensive by Nkunda in Sake|a sizeable offensive]] in Sake against the DRC army 11th Brigade,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/26/AR2006112600031.html "Congo Warlord's Fighters Attack Forces"], ''[[Washington Post]]'', 2006-11-26&lt;/ref&gt; also clashing with MONUC peacekeepers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L26775091.htm "UN says engages rebels as army flees Congo town"], [[Reuters]], 2006-11-26&lt;/ref&gt; The attack may not have been related to the election but due to the "killing of a Tutsi civilian who was close to one of the commanders in this group."&lt;ref name="voa"/&gt; 

The UN called on the DRC government to negotiate with Nkunda, and DRC Interior Minister, General [[Denis Kalume]], was sent to eastern DRC to begin negotiations.&lt;ref name="voa_2006-11-27"&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/english/2006-11-27-voa27.cfm "UN Calls for Negotiations in Eastern DRC"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061214000807/http://voanews.com/english/2006-11-27-voa27.cfm |date=14 December 2006 }}, ''[[Voice of America]]'', 2006-11-27&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2006-12-07, RCD-Goma troops attacked DRC army positions in Nord Kivu. With military assistance from MONUC, the DRC army was reported to have regained their positions, with about 150 RCD-Goma forces having been killed.

In early 2007, the central DRC government attempted to reduce the threat posed by Nkunda by trying to integrate his troops further into the [[FARDC]], the national armed forces, in what was called a 'mixage' process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.issafrica.org/dynamic/administration/file_manager/file_links/DDR%20IN%20DRC%20SITREP.PDF Henri Boshoff "The DDR Process in the DRC: A Never-Ending Story"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216023854/http://www.issafrica.org/dynamic/administration/file_manager/file_links/DDR%20IN%20DRC%20SITREP.PDF |date=16 February 2008 }}, Institute for Security Studies, 2007-07-02&lt;/ref&gt; However, this backfired and it now appears that from about January to August Nkunda controlled five brigades of troops rather than two. On 24 July 2007, the UN peacekeeping head [[Jean-Marie Guehenno]] stated, "Mr Nkunda's forces are the single most serious threat to stability in the DR Congo."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6913498.stm "Rogue general threatens DRC peace"] ''BBC News Africa'' 2007-07-24&lt;/ref&gt; In early September, Nkunda's forces had a smaller DRC force under siege in [[Masisi]], and MONUC helicopters were ferrying government soldiers to relieve the town. Scores of men were reported killed, and another major conflict was in progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.theguardian.com/congo/story/0,,2161241,00.html | title = Fear of fresh conflict in Congo as renegade general turns guns on government forces| author = Chris McGreal| publisher = The Guardian| date= 3 September 2007| accessdate = 3 September 2007| location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 September 2007, after the government FARDC forces claimed they had used a [[Mil Mi-24]] helicopter gunship to kill 80 of Nkunda's rebels, Nkunda called on the government to return to a peace process. "It's the government side who have broken the peace process. We are asking the government to get back on the peace process, because it is the real way to resolve the Congolese problem", he said&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6979375.stm "DRC rebel general calls for peace"] ''BBC News Africa'' 2007-09-05&lt;/ref&gt; In September, Nkunda's men "raided ten secondary schools and four primary schools where they took the children by force in order to make them join their ranks." According to United Nations officials, girls were taken as sex slaves, boys were used as fighters, in violation of international law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/Congo-warlord-continues-to-recruit-kids/2007/09/20/1189881644788.html "Congo warlord continues to recruit kids."] ''Sydney Morning Herald'' website, 2007-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the date of the UN report, thousands more Congolese fled their homes for displaced persons camps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7009442.stm "Congolese flee renegade general"], ''BBC News Africa'', 23 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The government set a 15 October 2007 deadline for Nkunda's troops to begin disarming. This deadline passed without action and, on 17 October, President [[Joseph Kabila]] ordered the [[Military of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|military]] to prepare to disarm Nkunda's forces forcibly. Government forces advanced on the Nkunda stronghold of [[Kichanga]]. Thousands of civilians fleeing the fighting between Nkunda and government-allied [[Mai-Mai]] around [[Bunagana, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Bunagana]] arrived in [[Rutshuru]] several days later. There were separate reports of government troops engaging units under Nkunda around Bukima, near Bunagana, as well as some refugees fleeing across the border into Uganda. The number of people displaced by the fighting since the beginning of the year was estimated at over 370,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7054699.stm "Thousands flee amid Congo clashes"], ''BBC News Africa'', 2007-10-20&lt;/ref&gt;

In early November 2007, Nkunda's troops captured the town of [[Nyanzale]], about {{convert|100|km|mi}} north of Goma. Three neighbouring villages were also reported captured, and the army outpost abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7124279.stm "DR Congo rebels take eastern town"], ''BBC News Africa'', 2007-12-03&lt;/ref&gt; A government offensive in early December resulted in the capture by the 82nd Brigade of the town of Mushake, overlooking a key road (however, Reuters reports a FARDC integrated brigade, the 14th, took the town).&lt;ref&gt;Joe Bavier, [http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L0519502.htm "Congo army says retakes eastern town from rebels"], 2007-12-05&lt;/ref&gt; This followed a statement by the [[United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo]] that it would be willing to offer artillery support to the government offensive. In a regional conference held in [[Addis Ababa]], the United States, Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda pledged to support the Congolese government and not support "negative forces", widely seen as code for Nkunda's forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7128367.stm "Army seizes DR Congo rebel base"], ''BBC News'', 5 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Nkunda stated on 14 December 2007 that he was open to peace talks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7145415.stm "DR Congo rebel 'ready for peace'"] ''BBC News Africa'' 2007-12-14&lt;/ref&gt; The government called such talks on 20 December to be held from 27 December 2007 to 5 January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7150248.stm "DR Congo invites rebels to talks"] ''BBC News Africa'' 2007-12-20&lt;/ref&gt; These talks were then postponed to be held from 6 to 14 January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200712280775.html Sylvie Van Den Wildenberg "Congo-Kinshasa: Launching of Preparatory Work for Kivus Peace Conference"] ''United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo'' 2007-12-28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fall 2008 fighting===
{{Main|2008 Nord-Kivu war}}

On 26 October 2008 Nkunda's rebels seized a major military camp, along with [[Virunga National Park]] for use as a base to launch attacks from. This occurred after the peace treaty failed, with the resultant fighting displacing thousands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/10/26/congo.gorillapark/index.html#cnnSTCText |title=Thousands flee fighting as Congo rebels seize gorilla park |publisher=CNN |date=26 October 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park was taken due to its strategic location on a main road leading to the city of [[Goma]].
On 27 October riots began around the United Nations compound in Goma, and civilians pelted the building with rocks and threw [[Molotov cocktail]]s, claiming that the UN forces had done nothing to prevent the rebel advance.&lt;ref name=CNNunrest&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/10/27/congo.united.nations.ap/index.html#cnnSTCText |title=Protesters attack U.N.

[[Attack helicopter]]s and [[Armoured fighting vehicle|armoured vehicles]] of [[MONUC|UN peacekeepers]] (MONUC) were used in an effort to halt the advance of the rebels, who claim to be within 7 miles (11 kilometres) of Goma.&lt;ref name=CNNbattle&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/10/27/congo.united.nations/index.html |title=U.N. gunships battle rebels in east Congo |publisher=CNN |date=28 October 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029024104/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/10/27/congo.united.nations/index.html |archivedate=29 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for DRC [[Alan Doss]] explained the necessity of engaging the rebels, stating that "...[the UN] can't allow population centers to be threatened...

Five [[Rocket-propelled grenade|rockets]] were fired at a convoy of UN vehicles protecting a road to the territorial capital of [[Rutshuru]], hitting two [[armoured personnel carrier]]s. The APCs, which contained [[Indian Army]] troops, were relatively undamaged, though a Lieutenant Colonel and two other personnel were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/10/30/stories/2008103055851200.htm|title=Armymen hurt in Congo|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=30 October 2008|accessdate=2008-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rebel forces later captured the town.

On 29 October the rebels declared a unilateral ceasefire as they approached Goma, though they still intended to take the city.&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite news |first=Catherine |last=Philp |title=UN peacekeepers braced for full-scale war in central Africa |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article5043727.ece?token=null&amp;offset=0&amp;page=1 |publisher=The Times |date=30 October 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-30 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same day a French request for an EU reinforcement of 1,500 troops was refused by several countries and appeared unlikely to materialise; however, the UN forces in place stated they would act to prevent takeovers of population centres.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michelle |last=Faul |title= Congo rebels reach Goma edge, declare cease-fire |url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hoitt5BsM5OKJ2Mmc3g5q6iufXjwD944CKL83 |agency=Associated Press |date=29 October 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-29}}{{dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the day the streets of the city were filled with refugees and fleeing troops, including their tanks and other military vehicles.&lt;ref name=times/&gt; There were also reports of looting and commandeering of cars by Congolese troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeffrey |last=Gettleman |title=Many Flee as Congo Rebels Approach Eastern City |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/30/world/africa/30congo.html?ref=africa |work=The New York Times |date=29 October 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; That night the UN Security Council unanimously adopted a non-binding resolution which condemned the recent rebel advance and demanded it be halted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Le Conseil de sécurité condamne l'avancée des rebelles dans l'est de la RDC |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/web/depeches/0,14-0,39-37447239@7-37,0.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081102074633/http://www.lemonde.fr/web/depeches/0,14-0,39-37447239@7-37,0.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 November 2008 |work=Le Monde |language=French |date=30 October 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the ceasefire, World Vision workers had to flee to the Rwandan border to work, and shots were still fired.

Working with the UN forces around Goma, Nkunda hoped to relocate victims of the recent fighting between his CNDP forces and UN peacekeepers. MONUC spokesman Kevin Kennedy stated that MONUC's forces were stretched thin trying to keep peace within and around the city; recent looting by Congolese soldiers had made it harder to do so as incidents arose both within city limits and outside. According to [[Anneke Van Woudenberg]], a [[Human Rights Watch]] researcher, more than 20 people were killed overnight in Goma alone. Meanwhile, Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] contacted Rwandan President Paul Kagame to discuss a long-term solution.&lt;ref name=CNNaid&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/10/30/congo.rebel/index.html|title=Rebel general offers aid corridor for Congo|publisher=CNN|date=31 October 2008|accessdate=2008-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also on 31 October British Foreign Minister [[David Miliband]] and French Foreign Minister [[Bernard Kouchner]] flew to the region, with the intention of stopping in Kinshasa, Goma, and possibly Kigali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sturcke|first=James|title=David Miliband holds talks with Congolese president|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/01/david-miliband-talks-kinshasa-congo|accessdate=30 January 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=1 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 November rebels broke the ceasefire and wrested control of another town in eastern [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] in clashes with government forces on the eve of a regional summit on the crisis. [[National Congress for the Defence of the People]] (CNDP) rebels seized control of the centre of [[Nyanzale]], an important army base in [[Nord-Kivu]] province after government forces fled. Residents reported that rebels had shot dead civilians suspected of supporting pro-government militia.&lt;ref name=BBC2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7713758.stm|title=Congolese rebels make new gains|date=6 October 2008|accessdate=2008-10-07|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Angolan involvement===
In November 2008, during the clashes around Goma, a UN source reported that [[Angola]]n troops were seen taking part in combat operations alongside government forces. Kinshasa repeatedly denied that foreign troops were on its soil&amp;nbsp;— an assertion echoed by the UN mission, which has 17,000 blue-helmeted peacekeepers on the ground. There is "military cooperation" between Congo and Angola, and that "there are perhaps Angolan (military) instructors in country", according to the UN. Angola, a former Portuguese colony, sided with [[Kinshasa]] in the 1998–2003 Second Congo War that erupted when Democratic Republic of Congo was in a massive rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Congo War|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/congo.htm|work=GlobalSecurity.org|accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|United Nations Force Intervention Brigade}}
On 28 March 2013, faced with recurrent waves of conflict in eastern DRC threatening the overall stability and development of the country and wider [[Great Lakes region]], the [[Security Council]] decided, by its resolution 2098, to create a specialized “intervention brigade” for an initial period of one year and within the authorized [[MONUSCO]] troop ceiling of 19,815. It would consist of three infantry battalions, one artillery and one special force and reconnaissance company and operate under direct command of the [[MONUSCO Force Commander]], with the responsibility of neutralizing armed groups and the objective of contributing to reducing the threat posed by armed groups to state authority and civilian security in eastern DRC and to make space for stabilization activities.

The Council also decided that MONUSCO shall strengthen the presence of its military, police and civilian components in eastern DRC and reduce, to the fullest extent possible for the implementation of its mandate, its presence in areas not affected by conflict in particular [[Kinshasa]] and in western DRC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/monusco/mandate.shtml|title=MONUSCO Mandate - United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|publisher=Un.org|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last batch of the Malawi troops committed to the MONUSCO [[United Nations Force Intervention Brigade|Force Intervention Brigade]] arrived in Goma, North Kivu province, on 7 October 2013. They will be part of the 3000- strong force to which Tanzania and South Africa are the other two troop contributing countries.{{CN|date=December 2017}}

Since the arrival of its first troops in June 2013, the Intervention Brigade has already gone into action resulting in the withdrawal of M23, {{convert|30|km|mi}} from its initial positions in [[Kanyaruchinya]], on 31 August 2013.{{CN|date=December 2017}}

The Intervention Brigade is now at its full strength with the arrival of the Malawi infantry battalion. Tanzania, South Africa and Malawi have been picked for the UN Stabilization Mission in DR Congo (MONUSCO) because of the wide experience they gained in other UN Peacekeeping missions. For instance, 95 percent of the Malawi troops have been already in peacekeeping missions in Kosovo, Liberia, Rwanda, Sudan, and they are well prepared to face any operational challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monusco.unmissions.org/Default.aspx?tabid=10662&amp;ctl=Details&amp;mid=14594&amp;ItemID=20212&amp;language=en-US|title=Last batch of Malawi troops now in Goma for the UN Force Intervention Brigade|publisher=Monusco.unmissions.org|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KitshangaWar-11 (8539323200).jpg|thumb|left|Destruction in the town of [[Kitshanga]] caused by fighting between FARDC and APCLS rebels in 2013]]
In January 2015, it was reported that UN and Congo troops were preparing an offensive on FDLR in the Kivu region, while striking  [[National Forces of Liberation|FNL-Nzabampema]] positions on Eastern Congo on January 5, 2015.&lt;ref name=voa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/un-congo-prepar-offensive-against-fdlr-rebels/2586565.html|title=UN, Congo Prepare Offensive Against FDLR Rebels|work=VOA|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several days earlier an infiltration by an unknown rebel group from Eastern Congo to Burundi left 95 rebels and 2 Burundi soldiers dead.&lt;ref name=voa/&gt;

On 13 January 2015, the Congolese military held a press conference announcing the destruction of four of the 20 militant factions operating in South Kivu. The Raïa Mutomboki armed group will undergo disarmament. A total of 39 rebels were killed and 24 captured since the start of the Sokola 2 operation in October 2014, 55 weapons and large quantities of ammunition were also seized. FARDC casualties amounted to 8 killed and 4 wounded.&lt;ref name=Rai&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radiookapi.net/actualite/2015/01/13/sud-kivu-4-des-20-groupes-armes-completement-demanteles-selon-les-fardc/|title=Sud-Kivu: 4 des 20 groupes armés "complètement démantelés", selon les FARDC|work=Radio Okapi|date=13 January 2015|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 January 2015, 85 Raïa Mutomboki rebels surrendered to the authorities in the town of [[Mubambiro]], North Kivu; the former militants will be gradually integrated into FARDC. Earlier in January, Raïa Mutomboki, founder Nyanderema, approached the town of [[Luizi]] with a group of 9 fighters, announcing their abandonment of armed struggle. 24 rifles, 2 grenades and other military equipment was transferred to FARDC during the two incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radiookapi.net/actualite/2015/01/25/sud-kivu-85-raia-mukombozi-se-rendent-aux-fardc/|title=Sud-Kivu: 85 Raïa Mukombozi se rendent aux FARDC|work=Radio Okapi|date=25 January 2015|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 7, 2017, an [[2017 Semuliki attack|attack]] orchestrated by the [[Allied Democratic Forces]] on a UN base in the [[North Kivu]] region resulted in the death of at least 15 UN peacekeepers from the [[MONUSCO]] mission.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt; This attack drew international criticism, with [[UN Secretary-General]] [[Antonio Guterres]] describing the incident, the worst altercation involving peacekeepers in recent history, as a "war crime".&lt;ref name="dozens in 2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-42285871|title=UN peacekeepers killed in DR Congo|date=8 December 2017|publisher=|access-date=10 December 2017|via=www.BBC.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assault, in terms of fatalities, was the most severe suffered by peacekeepers since an ambush in Somalia in 1993.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The peacekeeping regiment that came under attack was composed of troops from [[Tanzania]].

==Human rights abuses==

===Child recruitment by the armed groups===
{{main|Child soldiers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}
Violence is widespread: "In Masisi 99.1% (897/905) and Kitchanga 50.4% (509/1020) of households reported at least one member subjected to violence. Displacement was reported by 39.0% of households (419/1075) in Kitchanga and 99.8% (903/905) in Masisi," one study found.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21059195 Violence against civilians and access to health care in North Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo: three cross-sectional surveys]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many armed groups participating in the conflict have used children as active combatants. According to the report published [on 23 October 2013], almost 1,000 cases of child recruitment by armed groups were verified by MONUSCO between 1 January 2012 and 31&amp;nbsp;August 2013, predominantly in the district of [[North Kivu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monusco.unmissions.org/Default.aspx?tabid=11430&amp;ctl=Details&amp;mid=14701&amp;ItemID=20218&amp;language=en-US|title=MONUSCO alarmed by child recruitment in DRC|publisher=Monusco.unmissions.org|access-date=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of child soldiers in the Kivu conflict constitutes another example of the use of [[Child soldiers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|child soldiers in the DRC]]. The UN has asserted that some of the girls being used as belligerents are also subjected to sexual assault, and are treated as [[sex slaves]].{{sfn|Grover|2012|p=117}}

===Sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo===
{{main|Sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}

The Kivu conflict has created chaos and disorder in the regions of [[North Kivu|North]] and [[South Kivu]]. [[MONUSCO]] believe that widespread sexual assault has been perpetrated against women in this regions by all sides of the conflict, something which the [[UNHCR]] has condemned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/en-ie/news/briefing/2013/7/51f79a649/sexual-violence-rise-drcs-north-kivu.html|title=Sexual violence on the rise in DRC's North Kivu|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|last=Refugees|website=UNHCR.org|access-date=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incidents have involved the rape and sexual assault of both women and girls, included the incorporation of girls into militia forces as [[sex slaves]]. The most publicised example of sexual violence occurred in November 2012 in [[Minova]]. Having retreated to the town, FARDC troops conducted systematic rape against the women and girls over a period of three days. This resulted in widespread international condemnation, prompting the [[Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Army]] to begin an investigation in order to prosecute the perpetrators of the sexual assaults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/multimedia/2014/3/they-will-be-heard-therapesurvivorsofminova.html|title=They will be heard: The rape survivors of Minova|website=america.alJazeera.com|access-date=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the "Minova Trial" was conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/world/africa/how-military-mass-rape-was-buried-in-congo/news-story/53c3e776044dcc7082ab1a6fdbb5b4c6|title=How military mass rape was buried|website=News.com.au|access-date=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the largest rape tribunal in the nation's history. While the American Bar Association, which had an office in Goma, had identified more than 1,000 potential victims, the official list composed by the UN only had 126, of whom 56 testified at the trial. For reasons of safety, those testifying were forced to hide their faces by donning hoods. In the end, only a few junior officers were convicted. Sexual violence in the region has continued, but by 2015, funding had declined for sanctuaries for the women and protection.&lt;ref name="guardiantrial"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/13/rape-victims-congo-world-turned-away  Mark Townsend, "Revealed: how the world turned its back on rape victims of Congo"], ''The Guardian'', 13 June 2015; accessed 15 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict minerals===
{{see also|Conflict resource#Democratic Republic of the Congo}}
The role of conflict minerals in the conflict is highly debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/09/10/in-eastern-congo-economic-colonialism-in-the-guise-of-ethical-consumption/|title=In Eastern Congo, economic colonialism in the guise of ethical consumption?|first1=Christoph|last1=Vogel|first2=Ben|last2=Radley|date=10 September 2014|publisher=|access-date=10 December 2017|via=www.WashingtonPost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain [[Non-governmental organisation|NGOs]], like the Enough Project, say that the illegal exploitation of minerals is the main cause of the ongoing violence in the Kivus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enoughproject.org/category/conflict-area/eastern-congo|title=Eastern Congo: An Action Plan to End The World's Deadliest War - The Enough Project|date=16 July 2009|website=EnoughProject.org|access-date=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A United Nations report supported this view. However, many academic and independent researchers (both Congolese and international) challenge this interpretation, arguing that while conflict minerals are undoubtedly one of the many causes of violence in the region, they are most likely not the most significant and impactful one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanosphere.org/human-rights/2014/09/conflict-mineral-law-dr-congo-harm-good-say-experts/|title=Conflict mineral law does more harm than good for Congo, say experts - Humanosphere|date=10 September 2014|website=Humanosphere.org|access-date=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most prominent and prevalent conflict mineral procured in the Kivu districts is [[gold]]. Due to its high financial value, rival militias will attack one another for control of the mineral. An investigation into conflict minerals in relation to the Kivu conflict found that "gold is now, as of 2013, the most important conflict mineral in eastern Congo, with at least 12 tons worth roughly $500 million smuggled out of the east every year." These high financial revenues were identified as the primary incentives for the mining and capture of gold. To illustrate this, this study looked at one specific rebel group, determining that "The M23 rebel group has taken over a profitable part of the conflict gold trade in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo...It is using revenues from the illicit trade to benefit its leaders and supporters and fund its military campaign by building military alliances and networks with other armed groups that control territory around gold mines and by smuggling gold through Uganda and Burundi. [[March 23 Movement|M23]] commander [[Sultani Makenga]], who is also allegedly one of the rebels' main recruiters of [[child soldier]]s according to the U.N. Group of Experts on Congo, is at the center of the conflict gold efforts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201310100873.html|title=allAfrica.com: Congo-Kinshasa: Striking Gold - How M23 and Its Allies Are Infiltrating Congo's Gold Trade|work=allAfrica.com|access-date=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Link rot''' (or '''linkrot''') is the process by which [[hyperlink]]s on individual [[website]]s or the [[Internet]] in general point to [[web page]]s, [[Server (computing)|servers]] or other resources that have become permanently unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zittrain |first1=Jonathan |last2=Albert |first2=Kendra |last3=Lessig |first3=Lawrence |title=Perma: Scoping and Addressing the Problem of Link and Reference Rot in Legal Citations |journal=Legal Information Management |date=12 June 2014 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=88–99 |doi=10.1017/S1472669614000255}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that the [[half-life]] of a random webpage is two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koehler|first1=Wallace|title=A longitudinal study of Web pages continued: a consideration of document persistence|url=http://www.informationr.net/ir/9-2/paper174.html|website=Information Research|accessdate=16 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911062629/http://www.informationr.net/ir/9-2/paper174.html|archivedate=11 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van der Graaf|first1=Hans|title=The half-life of a link is two year|url=http://blog.zomdir.com/2017/10/the-half-life-of-link-is-two-year.html|website=ZOMDir's blog|accessdate=16 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017041901/http://blog.zomdir.com/2017/10/the-half-life-of-link-is-two-year.html|archivedate=17 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
Link rot is also called "link death", "link breaking" or "reference rot". A link that does not work any more is called a "broken link", "dead link", or "dangling link". Formally, this is a form of [[dangling reference]]: The target of the reference no longer exists.

==Causes==
One of the most common reasons for a broken link is that the web page to that it points to no longer exists. This frequently results in a [[HTTP 404|404 error]], which indicates that the web server responded but the specific page could not be found. Another type of dead link occurs when the server that hosts the target page stops working or relocates to a new [[domain name]]. The browser may return a [[Domain Name System|DNS]] error or display a site unrelated to the content originally sought. The latter can occur when a domain name lapses and is reregistered by another party. Other reasons for broken links include:
* Websites can be restructured or redesigned, or the underlying technology can be changed, altering or invalidating large numbers of inbound or internal links.
* Many news sites keep articles freely accessible for only a short time period, and then move them behind a [[paywall]]. This causes a significant loss of supporting links in sites discussing news events and using media sites as references.
* Content may automatically expire after a certain time period.
* Content may be intentionally removed by the owner.
* A server may be upgraded and code (e.g. PHP) may no longer function properly.
* Links may be removed as a result of legal action or court order.
* Search results from social media such as [[Facebook]] and [[Tumblr]] are prone to link rot because of frequent changes in user privacy, the deletion of accounts, search result pointing to a dynamic page that has new results that differ from the [[Cache (computing)|cached result]], or the deletion of links or photos.
* Links can contain ephemeral, user-specific information such as session or login data. Because these are not universally valid, the result can be a broken link.
* A link might be broken because of some form of blocking such as [[content filter]]s or [[Firewall (networking)|firewalls]].
* A website may be closed or taken down, invalidating the links which are pointing to it.
* A website might change its domain name. Links pointing to the old name might then become invalid.
* Dead links can occur on the authoring side, when website content is assembled from Internet sources and deployed without properly verifying the link targets.
* As new private [[Generic top-level domain|gTLDs]] became popular, top-level-domains like &lt;code&gt;.mcdonalds&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;.xperia&lt;/code&gt; were revoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/the-death-of-a-tld|title=The death of a TLD|website=blog.benjojo.co.uk|access-date=2018-07-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726220205/https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/the-death-of-a-tld|archive-date=2018-07-26|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
The [[HTTP 404|404 "Not Found"]] response is familiar to even the occasional web user.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} A number of studies have examined the prevalence of link rot on the web, in academic literature, and in [[digital library|digital libraries]].&lt;ref name="Habibzadeh"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Decay of References to Web sites in Articles Published in General Medical Journals: Mainstream vs Small Journals|journal = Applied Clinical Informatics|date = 2013-01-01|volume = 4|issue = 4|pages = 455–64|doi = 10.4338/aci-2013-07-ra-0055|pmid = 24454575|first = P.|last = Habibzadeh|first2 = Schattauer GmbH - Publishers for Medicine and Natural|last2 = Sciences|pmc=3885908}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2003 experiment, Fetterly et al. discovered that about one link out of every 200 disappeared each week from the Internet. McCown et al. (2005) discovered that half of the [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]] cited in [[D-Lib Magazine]] articles were no longer accessible 10 years after publication, and other studies have shown link rot in academic literature to be even worse (Spinellis, 2003, Lawrence et al., 2001). Nelson and Allen (2002) examined link rot in digital libraries and found that about 3% of the objects were no longer accessible after one year. In 2014, bookmarking site [[Pinboard (website)|Pinboard]]'s owner [[Maciej Cegłowski]] reported a “pretty steady rate” of 5% link rot per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Maciej | last = Cegłowski | author-link = Maciej Cegłowski | title = Web Design: The First 100 Years | date = 9 September 2014 | url = http://idlewords.com/talks/web_design_first_100_years.htm | accessdate = 22 July 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150722022607/http://idlewords.com/talks/web_design_first_100_years.htm | archivedate = 22 July 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 [[Harvard Law School]] study by [[Jonathan Zittrain]], Kendra Albert and [[Lawrence Lessig]], determined that approximately 50% of the URLs in U.S. Supreme Court opinions no longer link to the original information.&lt;ref name="permacc"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Zittrain | first1 = Jonathan | last2 = Albert | first2 = Kendra | last3 = Lessig | first3 = Lawrence | title = Perma: Scoping and Addressing the Problem of Link and Reference Rot in Legal Citations | journal = Legal Information Management | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 88–99 | date = 12 June 2014 | df =  | doi = 10.1017/S1472669614000255 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also found that in a selection of legal journals published between 1999 and 2011, more than 70% of the links no longer functioned as intended. A 2013 study in ''[[BMC Bioinformatics]]'' analyzed nearly 15,000 links in abstracts from [[Thomson Reuters]]' Web of Science citation index and found that the median lifespan of web pages was 9.3 years, and just 62% were archived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hennessey | first1 = Jason | last2 = Xijin Ge | first2 = Steven | title = A Cross Disciplinary Study of Link Decay and the Effectiveness of Mitigation Techniques | journal = BMC Bioinformatics | volume = 14 | pages = S5 | date = 2013 | url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/14/S14/S5/ | accessdate = 16 January 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150121021402/http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/14/S14/S5/ | archivedate = 21 January 2015 | df =  | doi = 10.1186/1471-2105-14-S14-S5 | pmid = 24266891 | pmc = 3851533 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2015 Weblock analyzed more than 180,000 links from references in the full-text corpora of three major open access publishers and found that overall 24.5% of links cited were no longer available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = All-Time Weblock Report | date = August 2015 | url = https://weblock.io/report?id=all | accessdate = 12 January 2016 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081204/https://weblock.io/report?id=all | archivedate = 4 March 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovering==
Discovering broken links might be done manually or automatically. Automated methods, including [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] for [[WordPress]], [[Drupal]] and other [[content management systems|content management system]] can be used to detect the presence of broken [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]]. An alternative is using a specific broken link checker like [[Xenu's Link Sleuth]]. However, if a URL returns an [[HTTP]] [[200 OK|200 (OK)]] response, it may be accessible, but the contents of the page could have changed and may no longer be relevant. So manual checking links seems to be a must. Some web servers also return a [[soft 404]], reporting to computers that the link works even though it doesn't. Bar-Yossef et al. (2004) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Bar-Yossef | first1 = Ziv | last2 = Broder | first2 = Andrei Z. | last3 = Kumar | first3 = Ravi | last4 = Tomkins | first4 = Andrew | chapter = Sic transit gloria telae: towards an understanding of the web's decay | doi = 10.1145/988672.988716 | title = Proceedings of the 13th conference on World Wide Web  - WWW '04 | pages = 328 | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-1581138443 | pmid =  | pmc =  | df =  | citeseerx = 10.1.1.1.9406 }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed a heuristic for automatically discovering soft 404s.

==Combating==
There are numerous solutions for tackling broken links: Some work to prevent them in the first place, while others try to resolve them when they have occurred. There are also numerous tools that have been developed to help combat link rot.

===Authoring===
* Carefully select and implement hyperlinks, and verify them regularly after publication. Best practices include linking to primary rather than secondary sources and prioritizing stable sites. McCown et al., 2005, suggests avoiding URL citations that point to resources on researchers' personal pages.
* Always look for the most compact and direct URL available, and ensure that it's [[Clean URL|clean]], with no unnecessary information after the core of the URL.&lt;ref name="jrlinkrot"&gt;{{cite web | last = Kille | first = Leighton Walter | title = The Growing Problem of Internet "Link Rot" and Best Practices for Media and Online Publishers | publisher = Journalist's Resource, Harvard Kennedy School | date = 8 November 2014 | url = http://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/internet/website-linking-best-practices-media-online-publishers | accessdate = 16 January 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150112034707/http://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/internet/website-linking-best-practices-media-online-publishers | archivedate = 12 January 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is often referred to as [[URL normalization]] or [[URL canonicalization]].
* Whenever possible, use [[persistent identifier]]s (URLs designed for durability) such as ARKs, [[Digital object identifier|DOIs]], Handle System references, and PURLs.
* Avoid linking to [[PDF]] documents if possible. Because PDFs are documents rather than web pages, their content can change without notice, and their names are more likely to contain characters such as spaces that must be translated into safe codes for URLs. Large PDFs may also download slowly and cause a timeout error.&lt;ref name="jrlinkrot"/&gt;
* Avoid linking to pages deep in a website, a practice known as [[deep linking]].
* Use web archiving services (for example, [[WebCite]]) to permanently archive and retrieve cited Internet references (Eysenbach and Trudel, 2005).

===Server side===
* Never change URLs and never remove pages. If there is a reason to no longer have a page, such as a news site redacting a story, replace it with a message explaining its removal.
* When URLs change, use [[URL redirection|redirection]] mechanisms such as "[[HTTP 301|301: Moved Permanently]]" to automatically refer browsers and crawlers to the new location.
* [[Web content management system|Content management systems]] may offer built-in solutions to the management of links, such as updating them when content is changed or moved on a site.
* [[WordPress]] guards against link rot by replacing non-canonical URLs with their [[URL canonicalization|canonical]] versions.&lt;ref name="Justaddwater 2007"&gt;{{cite web | last = Rønn-Jensen | first = Jesper | title = Software Eliminates User Errors And Linkrot | publisher = Justaddwater.dk | date = 2007-10-05 | url = http://justaddwater.dk/2007/10/05/blog-software-eliminates-user-errors-and-linkrot/ | accessdate = 5 October 2007 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011033526/http://justaddwater.dk/2007/10/05/blog-software-eliminates-user-errors-and-linkrot/ | archivedate = 11 October 2007 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[IBM]]'s [[IBM Peridot (software)|Peridot]] attempts to automatically fix broken links.
* [[Permalink]]ing stops broken links by guaranteeing that the content will not move for the foreseeable future. Another form of permalinking is linking to a permalink that then redirects to the actual content, ensuring that even though the real content may be moved etc., links pointing to the resources stay intact.
* Design URLs—for example, [[semantic URL]]s—such that they won't need to change when a different person takes over maintenance of a document or when different software is used on the server.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Tim Berners-Lee | title=Cool URIs don't change | url=http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI | date=1998 | accessdate=7 October 2013 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927221807/http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI | archivedate=27 September 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===User side===
* The Linkgraph widget gets the URL of the correct page based upon the old broken URL by using historical location information.
* The Google 404 Widget attempts to "guess" the correct URL, and also provides the user with a search box to find the correct page.
* When a user receives a 404 response, the [[Google Toolbar]] attempts to assist the user in finding the missing page.&lt;ref name="GoogleToolbar"&gt;{{cite web | last = Mueller | first = John | title = FYI on Google Toolbar's Latest Features | publisher = Google Webmaster Central Blog | date = 2007-12-14 | url = http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2007/12/fyi-on-google-toolbars-latest-features.html | accessdate = 9 July 2008 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080913132848/http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2007/12/fyi-on-google-toolbars-latest-features.html | archivedate = 13 September 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Web archiving===
{{Main | Web archiving}}
To combat link rot, [[Web archiving|web archivists]] are actively engaged in collecting the [[World Wide Web|Web]] or particular portions of the Web and ensuring the collection is [[Digital preservation|preserved]] in an [[archive]], such as an [[archive site]], for future researchers, historians, and the public. The goal of the [[Internet Archive]] is to maintain an archive of the entire Web, taking periodic snapshots of pages that can then be accessed for free via the [[Wayback Machine]]. In January 2013 the company announced that it had reached the milestone of 240 billion archived URLs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.archive.org/2013/01/09/updated-wayback/ |title=Wayback Machine: Now with 240,000,000,000 URLs &amp;#124; Internet Archive Blogs |date=2013-01-09 |accessdate=2014-04-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170912091637/http://blog.archive.org/2013/01/09/updated-wayback/ |archivedate=2017-09-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National library|National libraries]], [[national archive]]s and other organizations are also involved in archiving culturally important Web content.

Individuals may use a number of tools that allow them to archive web resources that may go missing in the future:
* The "WayBack Machine", at the [[Internet Archive]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/ | title=Internet Archive: Digital Library of Free Books, Movies, Music &amp; Wayback Machine | date=2001-03-10 | accessdate=7 October 2013 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970126045828/http://www.archive.org/ | archivedate=26 January 1997 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a free website that archives old web pages. It does not archive websites whose owners have stated they do not want their website archived.
* [[WebCite]], a tool specifically for scholarly authors, journal editors and publishers to permanently archive "on-demand" and retrieve cited Internet references (Eysenbach and Trudel, 2005).
* [[Archive.is]], an archive site which stores snapshots of web pages. It retrieves one page at a time, but unlike WebCite, it includes [[Web 2.0]] sites such as Google Maps and Twitter.
* [[Perma.cc]], which is supported by the Harvard Law School together with a broad coalition of university libraries, takes a snapshot of a URL's content and returns a permanent link.&lt;ref name="permacc"/&gt;
* The Hiberlink project, a collaboration between the University of Edinburgh, the Los Alamos National Laboratory and others, is working to measure “reference rot” in online academic articles, and also to what extent Web content has been archived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Hiberlink | publisher = Hiberlink.org | url = http://hiberlink.org/ | accessdate = 15 January 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150129182611/http://hiberlink.org/ | archivedate = 29 January 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A related project, [[Memento Project|Memento]], has established a technical standard for accessing online content as it existed in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Memento: Time Travel for the Web | publisher = Memento | url = http://mementoweb.org/ | accessdate = 15 January 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150107201343/http://www.mementoweb.org/ | archivedate = 7 January 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some [[social bookmarking]] websites allow users to make online clones of any web page on the internet, creating a copy at an independent url which remains online even if the original page goes down.
* Amber, created by the [[Harvard University|Harvard]] [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society|Berkman Center]], is a tool built to fight link rot through archiving links on [[WordPress|Wordpress]] and [[Drupal]] sites to prevent web censorship and bolster content preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Harvard University's Berkman Center Releases Amber, a "Mutual Aid" Tool for Bloggers &amp; Website Owners to Help Keep the Web Available {{!}} Berkman Center|url = https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/node/99276|website = cyber.law.harvard.edu|access-date = 2016-01-28|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160202042259/https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/node/99276|archivedate = 2016-02-02|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, such preserving systems may encounter on and off service interruption so that the preserved URLs are intermittently unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Are current archiving systems reliable enough?|journal = International Urogynecology Journal|volume = 26|issue = 10|date = 2015-07-30|issn = 0937-3462|pages = 1|doi = 10.1007/s00192-015-2805-7|pmid = 26224384|first = Parham|last = Habibzadeh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Wrigley Field]]''' is a stadium that opened in 1914. It has primarily served as the home field of the [[Chicago Cubs]] professional baseball club for over nine decades, but it also hosted football games and other events in its 100 years of existence.

==1910s==

===1914===
*April 23 the [[Federal League]] [[Chicago Chi-Feds/Whales|Chifeds]] played the first game at the brand-new Weeghman Park. After parades and ceremonies, the Chifeds defeated the visiting [[Kansas City Packers]] 9&amp;ndash;1.

===1915===
*In June and July, on select night the park hosted first-class "hippodrome acts" at night after the Whales' games. Separate admission fee (of between 10 and 20 cents for grandstand and 30 for boxes) was charged to view circus-style performers such as "The Five Juggling Normans", "The Clown of the Sawdust Ring" and "the great baseball pantomime comedian George Silvers"&lt;ref name=Wrigley100_History&gt;{{cite web |title=The Field|url=http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/chc/wrigleyfield100/the-park/|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*October 3 the renamed [[Chicago Chi-Feds/Whales|Chicago Whales]] clinched what would turn out to be the final [[Federal League]] pennant in perhaps the closest pennant race in history. Going into the last day of the season, Chicago was four points ahead of the [[Pittsburgh Rebels]] and five points ahead of the [[St. Louis Terriers]]. St. Louis won its game against [[Kansas City Packers|Kansas City]], putting them just two points behind Chicago and two ahead of Pittsburgh. The Whales were scheduled to play a [[Doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]] against Pittsburgh at Weeghman Park. The Whales lost the first game, 5&amp;ndash;4, in the 11th inning after having led 4&amp;ndash;1 with two outs in the ninth inning. A loss or tie in the second game would give Pittsburgh the FL pennant, while a win would give the Whales the pennant. As the sun drew low during the second game, the game remained scoreless. Finally, in the sixth inning, the Whales scored three runs, two of them from a [[Max Flack]] double. The game was called due to darkness after Pittsburgh failed to score in the top of the seventh inning. The Whales ended up winners of the pennant by .001 over St. Louis, and Pittsburgh ended up third, one-half game back.

===1916===
*April 20 the Cubs played their first game in Weeghman Park. The franchise had merged with the Whales after the 1915 season, and as a result acquired the park and made it their own. The Cubs beat the [[Cincinnati Reds]] 7&amp;ndash;6 in 11 innings.

===1917===
*May 2 [[Hippo Vaughn|Jim "Hippo" Vaughn]] and the [[Cincinnati Reds]]'s [[Fred Toney]] both pitched nine-inning [[no-hitter]]s before [[Jim Thorpe]] drives in a run in the 10th inning for a Reds victory.

===1918===
*August 29, with the season ending early due to [[World War I|war]] restrictions, the [[Chicago Cubs]] clinched the [[National League]] pennant with a 1&amp;ndash;0 win over the [[Cincinnati Reds]] at Weeghman Park. The Cubs would play their home games of that year's [[1918 World Series|World Series]] in [[Comiskey Park]], home of the [[Chicago White Sox]]. Weeghman Park would not see its first [[World Series]] game until [[1929 World Series|1929]], when it had become known as Wrigley Field.

===1919===
*September 21 [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]] pitched a complete game, defeating the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] 3–0 in a 58-minute game. This is fastest nine-inning game in Cubs franchise history.&lt;ref name="Wrigley100_History" /&gt;

==1920s==

===1920===
*June 26, 1920: In a high-school "inter-state championship" game between New York City's Commerce High and Chicago's [[Lane Tech]], just-turned-17 New York player [[Lou Gehrig]] slugs a [[Grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] to lead his team to a comeback victory.
*October 10, 1920: First professional football game at Cubs Park. The [[Chicago Tigers]] hosted the [[Racine Cardinals]] in a 0–0 draw. The game was attended by a crowd of 8,000.&lt;ref name="Wrigley100_History" /&gt;
*[[1920 APFA season|1920]] [[NFL|American Professional Football League]] [[List of NFL champions (1920–69)|Championship Game]]&lt;ref name="Wrigley100_History" /&gt;

===1921===
*[[1921 APFA season|1921]] The [[Chicago Bears|Chicago Staleys]] (now known as the 'Chicago Bears') make Cubs Park their home venue.&lt;ref name="Wrigley100_History" /&gt;

===1922===
*July 12, 1922: Cubs Park hosts its first concert. Lights were brought in to illuminate the field, and a platform and sound board was set up over the infield for an orchestra performance.&lt;ref name="Wrigley100_History" /&gt;
*August 25, 1922: The Cubs defeat the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] 26–23 in what remains (through 2009) the highest-scoring game in major league history (49 runs total). After spotting the Phillies an early 2–1 lead, the Cubs score 10 in the second and 14 in the fourth, leading 25–6 at that point. The Phillies outscore the Cubs 17–1 during the last five innings, but the Cubs hang on to win in the ninth (with the potential lead run at the plate), avoiding what would have been the most lopsided comeback in history (the Phillies will save that effort for a game here in 1976). The winds apparently shift the next day, as the Cubs lose to the Phils 3–0.

===1923===
*In 1923 the park hosted the annual [[Illinois–Northwestern football rivalry|rivalry game]] between the [[Illinois Fighting Illini football|Illinois]] and [[Northwestern Wildcats football|Northwestern]] college football teams. This was the first time the game had ever been played in Chicago.&lt;ref name=Il-nw&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=303240077 |title=Mikel Leshoure runs rampant as Illinois stomps Northwestern at Wrigley |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=November 20, 2010 |website=espn.go.com |publisher=[[ESPN]] |access-date=November 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1924===
*October 1, 1924: [[WGN (AM)|WGN]]  broadcasts its first baseball game from the park, the first Chicago professional game ever broadcast on radio, with A.W. Kaney commentating. The Cubs were hosting the White Sox, and won 10–7.  The Chicago Cubs arguably led the way among MLB teams when it came to adopting the medium of radio broadcasting. Many major-league owners in the 1920s had been reluctant to adopting radio (fearing that fans tuning into games would quit attending at their ballparks), while William Wrigley Jr. correctly believed that radio would actually bring in more spectators excited from what they heard on the radio. "The more outlets, the better." he told players. "That way we'll tie up the entire city." By the mid-1920s five different stations were transmitting home games from Wrigley Field. During the [[1931 Major League Baseball season|1931 season]] as many as 7 Chicago radio stations carried Cubs from Wrigley Field, as the team charged no broadcast fee.&lt;ref name="Wrigley100_History" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yesterday&amp;Today"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Wisnia |first1= Saul | title= Chicago Cubs Yesterday &amp; Today |year=2008 |month= |publisher=West Side Publishing, a division of Publications International Inc. |location=Lincolnwood, Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1925===

===1926===
*December 3, 1926: Board of Directors votes to officially rename the park "Wrigley Field" in honor of William Wrigley Jr. It was the second ballpark with this name, as Mr. Wrigley's LA Minor League team, the [[Los Angeles Angels (PCL)|Los Angeles Angels]], also played at a [[Wrigley Field (Los Angeles)|Wrigley Field]]&lt;ref name="Wrigley100_History" /&gt;

===1927===

*June 21, 1931: [[Glasgow Celtic]], one of the most celebrated European soccer clubs, beat the Bricklayers, a Chicago-area team, 6-3 before 11,000 spectators at Wrigley Field.&lt;ref name="Wrigley100_History" /&gt;
*Fall of 1931: [[Chicago Cardinals]] move from [[Comiskey Park]] to Wrigley Field. The Chicago Cardinals and Chicago Bears football teams shared Wrigley until the Cardinals left after 1939.&lt;ref name="Wrigley100_History" /&gt;

===1938===
*1938: A tradition began when pennants representing league standings were hung beneath the yardarm of Wrigley Field's scoreboard. Also, Wrigley became the first stadium in the MLB to add a scoreboard outside the ballpark so that fans passing outside could be aware of the game's progress.&lt;ref name="Wrigley100_History" /&gt;
*September 28, 1938: [[Gabby Hartnett]] hits the "Homer in the Gloamin'" to lift the Cubs past in the standings, and deal a fatal blow to, the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], who had led the National League for much of the summer.

*April 17, 1951: Professional golfer Sam Snead hit a ball over the center-field scoreboard.&lt;ref name="Wrigley100_History" /&gt; He's the only person to do this, even if he did it by driving a golf ball rather than hitting a baseball.

===1958===
*May 13, 1958: [[Stan Musial|Stan "The Man" Musial]] of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] achieves his 3000th career hit, in a pinch-hitting role. This deprives Cardinals fans of the chance to see him reach this milestone at home, but [[Harry Caray]]'s ecstatic voice describes the action for listeners of the Cardinals radio network – Caray's future status as a Cubs icon unsuspected by anyone.

===1959===
*June 30, 1959, in one of the wackier moments in baseball history, an umpire's mistake results in two baseballs being in play at the same time. The visiting [[St. Louis Cardinals]] file a protest, but withdraw the protest after winning the game. Thus the two-baseball play is allowed to stand.
*August 28-September 7, 1959 Wrigley Field hosted the [[Baseball at the 1959 Pan American Games|baseball component]] of the [[1959 Pan American Games]].

==1960s==

===1961===
*May 28, 1961 a ''literal'' case of a "fireman" garnering a "save" for the Cubs occurred. During a contest with the [[San Francisco Giants]], a hot dog stand near the right field corner caught fire, and Wrigleyville's Fire Engine House #78 (built in 1915) is called in from its "bullpen" across Waveland to extinguish the blaze.

===1962===
*July 23, 1962 Wrigley Field 'went international', as [[Telstar]] transmitted images from the Phillies-Cubs game (patched into the WGN-TV coverage) to overseas receiving stations.&lt;ref name="Wrigley100_History" /&gt;
*July 30, 1962 the second 1962 [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]] (two were played each year 1959–1962) was played at Wrigley Field. Americans 9, Nationals 4.&lt;ref name="Wrigley100_History" /&gt; The last time the center field bleachers are open to fans, in the park's baseball configuration.

===1964===
{{empty section|date=December 2015}}

===1965===
*December 12, 1965: [[Gale Sayers]] of the Bears runs for a record-tying six touchdowns, as the Bears rout the [[San Francisco 49ers]] 61–20.

===1967===
*February, 1967: Cubs announce they will feature music and play the national anthem before every home game. Prior to this, the national anthem only was played for holidays and special occasions at Wrigley field.&lt;ref name="Wrigley100_History" /&gt;
*July 2, 1967: Cubs defeat the [[Cincinnati Reds]] 4–1, and move into first place. This was the first time since 1945 that the Cubs were in first place this far into the season.&lt;ref name="Wrigley100_History" /&gt;

===1969===
*June 29, 1969: The Cubs held a "Day" for [[Billy Williams (left fielder)|Billy Williams]] at Wrigley, in a doubleheader against the Cardinals before 41,060 fans, some dressed in red and some in blue. In a happy scheduling coincidence, Williams tied and passed Cardinals icon [[Stan Musial]] for the National League consecutive games record (895 and 896).&lt;ref name="Wrigley100_History" /&gt; Williams contributes 5 hits as the Cubs edge out the Cardinals in the opener, 3–1, and then thump the Redbirds in the late-afternoon-cap, 12–1.
*August 19, 1969 [[Ken Holtzman]], aided by a strong northerly wind,  no-hit the powerful-hitting [[Atlanta Braves]], 3–0, in what proved to be the high-water mark of the ill-fated 1969 season. In the 7th inning, [[Hank Aaron|Henry Aaron]] socked one that appeared to be headed for Waveland Avenue, but the wind smacked it down and into the glove of the leaping [[Billy Williams (left fielder)|Billy Williams]]. Aaron also made the final out, a ground ball from Beckert to Banks. The attendance of this game was 37,514.&lt;ref name=Yesterday&amp;Today/&gt;

===1972===
*April 16, 1972 [[Burt Hooton]] pitched a no-hitter 4–0 win over the Phillies. This was his fourth career start, and he was the first NL rookie in 60 years to throw a no-hitter. The season had started late due to a players' strike, and this one came on the second day of the season.&lt;ref name="Wrigley100_History" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Yesterday&amp;Today/&gt;
*September 2, 1972 [[Milt Pappas]] pitched a no-hitter 8–0 win over the [[San Diego Padres]]. He came within one strike of a perfect game, but walked a batter. The pitch called as a ball was highly controversial. Milt Pappas and many Cubs fans alike believe the pitch was a strike, not a ball. Pappas, after this, retired the final batter.&lt;ref name="Wrigley100_History" /&gt; After a relative rash of Wrigley and Cubs no-hitters, this was the last by a Cub until Carlos Zambrano did so against the Astros, in a game held at Milwaukee due to Hurricane Ike.

===1976===
*April 17, 1976, with a strong prevailing southerly breeze, the Cubs took a 13-2 lead over the Phillies through 4 innings, only to finally lose 18–16 in 10 innings, as the Phillies tied the NL record for the largest lead overcome. Tied at 15–15, the Phillies scored three in the 10th, partly on the strength of [[Mike Schmidt]]'s 4th home run of the game, and the Cubs were only able to come back with one in their half of the 10th. This allowed the Pillies to tie the National League record for largest deficit overcome (11 runs).
*May 14, 1976 [[Dave Kingman]] of the [[New York Mets]] hit the longest home run in Wrigley Field's history. The ball was hit more than 500 feet, and traveled down Kenmore Avenue.

===1977===
*July 28, 1977 Cubs and [[Cincinnati Reds]] tied the NL record for most home runs in a single game (11). The Cubs beat the Reds 16–15 in the 13-inning game.&lt;ref name="Wrigley100_History" /&gt;

===1979===
*May 17, 1979, in another windblown game with the Phillies (echoing the high-scoring Cubs-Phillies games of 1922 and 1976), the Phillies took a large lead only to have the Cubs catch them in the late innings. However, like 1976, [[Mike Schmidt]] did the Cubs in again, hitting a homer (his second of the day) in the 10th (off Bruce Sutter) to give the Phillies a 23–22 win. [[Dave Kingman]] hit three homers that day in a losing cause. In a curious mix of nostalgia and masochism, the following winter [[WGN-TV]] will replay the entire game videotape, as a "snow day" special.

===1981===
*June 16 the [[Tribune Company]] announced their purchase of the Chicago Cubs and Wrigley Field.&lt;ref name="Wrigley100_History" /&gt; 
*June 28  the [[Chicago Sting]] of the [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|North American Soccer League]] defeated the [[New York Cosmos (1970–85)|New York Cosmos]] 6-5 in front of 30,501 attendees. With the Cubs having [[1981 Chicago Cubs season|a poor season]]. This was the second highest attendance at Wrigley that year behind the Cubs home opener.&lt;ref name="Wrigley100_History" /&gt;

===1982===
*August 18 the Cubs lost to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] 2&amp;ndash;1 in a 21-inning contest, the longest game ever played at Wrigley Field and in Cubs history (by time). The game had been suspended due to darkness at the end of the 17th inning the previous afternoon. The game lasted six hours and ten minutes.&lt;ref name="Wrigley100_History" /&gt; [[Dusty Baker]] drove in the winning run on a sacrifice fly in the top of the 21st. 
*August 22 Ernie Banks' number 14 was retired by the Cubs at Wrigley Field.&lt;ref name="Wrigley100_History" /&gt;

===1983===
*April 29, following a loss to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], Cubs manager [[Lee Elia]] unleashed a profanity-laced verbal tirade against Cub fans, suggesting they were unemployed losers (in 1983, home games were still played exclusively during the day, when many individuals would be at their day jobs). At the time the Cubs were 5&amp;ndash;14 on the season, and the team was the subject of frequent booing and heckling. Elia was fired in August, partly due to the bad blood resulting from his comments.&lt;ref name="Wrigley100_History" /&gt; 
*June 10 [[Ferguson Jenkins]] pitched a four-hit complete game shutout against the reigning World Champion [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. This game, which was Jenkins' 281st career win, was witnessed by 37,024&amp;nbsp;fans—which was the largest crowd at Wrigley in nearly two years. The game would turn out to be the last hurrah for the 39-year-old pitcher. Toward the end of the season, Jenkins was demoted to a relief pitching role, and was released the following spring with 284 lifetime victories.
*August 24 Cubs pitcher [[Chuck Rainey (baseball)|Chuck Rainey]] came within one out of pitching a no-hitter against the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. The Reds' [[Eddie Milner]] singled with two outs in the ninth inning to break up Rainey's gem. Rainey wound up with a one-hit victory over the Reds, 3&amp;ndash;0.

===1984===
*June 23 "The Sandberg Game" took place. This game was a nationally televised Saturday game against the Cardinals that put [[Ryne Sandberg]] on the map, and came to symbolize the season for the Cubs, who would go on to win their first title of any kind since 1945. The Cubs overcame deficits of 7&amp;ndash;1, 9&amp;ndash;3, and 11&amp;ndash;9 as Sandberg hit a pair of game-tying home runs in late-inning action, both off ex-Cubs ace [[Bruce Sutter]], a wild one eventually won by the Cubs 12&amp;ndash;11 in 11 innings. [[ESPN]] replayed significant portions of the game prior to Sandberg's Hall of Fame induction in 2005, which show Sutter turning and shouting "Damn!" to himself when Sandberg hit the second one. However, Sutter later credited that replaying with helping him achieve his own Hall of Fame election the following year.&lt;ref name="Wrigley100_History" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Yesterday&amp;Today/&gt;
*August 7, with the Cubs en route to a four-sweep over the Mets in an intense playoff race, Cubs player [[Keith Moreland]] rushed the mound and roll-blocked Mets pitcher [[Ed Lynch (baseball)|Ed Lynch]], causing a notable [[Bench-clearing brawl]].&lt;ref name="Wrigley100_History" /&gt;
*October 2, the Cubs clobbered the [[San Diego Padres]] 13&amp;ndash;0 in the first game of the National League Championship Series. It was the Cubs' first postseason appearance since 1945. The Cubs combined for five home runs, including one by pitcher [[Rick Sutcliffe]].&lt;ref name="Wrigley100_History" /&gt;

===1985===
*September 8 [[Pete Rose]] of the [[Cincinnati Reds]] collected his 4,190th and 4,191st career hits in the first and fifth innings respectively. Rose had a chance at his 4,192 in the top of the ninth, but with dark clouds closing in, fireballing reliever [[Lee Smith (baseball)|Lee Smith]] struck Rose out. The game was later called on account of darkness after another half-inning as a tie. At the time, Rose's fifth-inning hit was believed to have tied [[Ty Cobb]]'s career record (WGN-TV flashed "Tied with Ty" on-screen), and 4,191 is still recognized by Major League Baseball as Cobb's official hit total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/stats/historical/player_stats.jsp?statType=1&amp;timeFrame=3&amp;timeSubFrame2=0&amp;sortByStat=H&amp;baseballScope=mlb&amp;timeSubFrame=0|title=Sortable Player Stats|work=mlb.com|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent researchers now believe Cobb's hit total to be 4,189, which if true would mean that Rose actually broke the record in the first inning. Rose was only in the lineup due to a last-minute pitching change. Rose normally batted only against right-handers. With lefty [[Steve Trout]] on the mound, Rose was due to be on the bench, and likely to tie and break Cobb's record in an upcoming 10-game homestand. But Trout's left arm had been injured in a fall while bicycling with his family the previous evening, and right-hander [[Reggie Patterson]] was announced as the starter. Rose, putting discipline ahead of sentiment, inserted himself in the lineup for the game and made some history.

*In 1987 Wrigley Field is placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/IL/Cook/state10.html|title=National Register of Historical Places - ILLINOIS (IL), Cook County|work=nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*July 8 [[San Diego Padres]] pitcher [[Eric Show]] hit Chicago slugger [[Andre Dawson]] in the face with a pitch. Following this beaning, Dawson remained motionless on the ground for several moments, then jumped to his feet and charged the mound initiating a [[bench-clearing brawl]].&lt;ref name="Wrigley100_History" /&gt; 
*August 13, 1987 [[Billy Williams (left fielder)|Billy Williams]]' number 26 was retired.
*August 27, 1987, entering the 8th inning with an 8&amp;ndash;6 lead over the [[Atlanta Braves]] in the second game of a doubleheader, darkness set in at Wrigley and the game was called off resulting in a Cubs victory. This was a routine occurrence in the pre-light years. The installation of lights the following season makes such suspensions less likely to occur in the future.

===1988===
*June 28, 1988 over 1.5 million phone calls were recorded during a 3½-hour ticket lottery for the final 13,000 tickets to the first scheduled night game on 8/8/88.&lt;ref name="Wrigley100_History" /&gt;

Rain forced the postponement of the game in the fourth inning, with the Cubs leading the Philadelphia Phillies, 3&amp;ndash;1. When the Phillies returned to Wrigley four weeks later, the Cubs would lose 4-3 in the replay of the game, which was the major league debut of pitcher [[Mike Harkey]].

===1989===
*October 4  the Cubs lost 11&amp;ndash;3 to the San Francisco Giants in Game 1 of the [[1989 National League Championship Series|1989]]  [[National League Championship Series]], the first postseason night game at Wrigley.

The gag earned Browning a $500 fine from Reds manager [[Davey Johnson]].&lt;ref name="Wrigley100_History" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tom Browning's perfect stunt 20 years ago|url=http://www2.cincinnati.com/blogs/tv/2013/07/05/tom-brownings-perfect-stunt-20-years-ago/|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cubs won 2&amp;ndash;0 as Wood gave up only one hit. Wood was in his rookie season, and this was just his fifth major-league start. Wood also twice hit 100&amp;nbsp;mph on the radar gun in the game.
*September 13 [[Sammy Sosa]] hit his 61st and 62nd home runs of the season to pass [[Babe Ruth]] and [[Roger Maris]], and temporarily tie [[Mark McGwire]], for the all-time single-season home run record. McGwire would eventually win the home run race 70-66. 
*September 27, on the 60th anniversary of Gabby Hartnett's famous pennant-assuring home run, the [[Chicago Cubs]] clinched the [[National League]] wild-card berth in a one-game playoff on a Monday night, defeating the [[San Francisco Giants]] 5&amp;ndash;3.

This incident was soon followed by walks, hits, a wild pitch and shortstop [[Alex S. Gonzalez]]'s crucial error on a potential, inning-ending double play. The 8-run inning resulted in [[Florida Marlins]] going on to be the Series Champions.

===2004===
*September 25 security footage showed [[Sammy Sosa]] leaving Wrigley Field 15 minutes after the start of the last game of the 2004 season, which Sosa denied, claiming that he left much later. Sosa would later be traded to the [[Baltimore Orioles]], ending a 12-year stint with the Cubs.

The statue originally included a typo, "Lets Play Two", misspelling a phrase Banks was known for saying. An apostrophe was added two days later so the statue would correctly read "Let's Play Two."
*May 16, in only its 25th game of the season, Wrigley Field's season attendance passed the million mark, the fastest in team history.
*June 12, to celebrate the 60th anniversary of [[WGN-TV]] broadcasting, the Cubs hosted a "throw-back" game, in which the first two innings were broadcast in black and white as they were in 1948. The Cubs and the Atlanta Braves both wore period uniforms, and for the day the ''Atlanta'' Braves reverted their name to the ''Boston'' Braves. The Cubs won the game 3-2 in the 13th inning.
*July 29 Wrigley Field hosted, for the first time in its storied history, a minor league game when the  [[Midwest League]] [[Peoria Chiefs]], coached by [[Baseball Hall of Fame]]r and former Cubs player [[Ryne Sandberg]], hosted the [[Kane County Cougars]] at Wrigley.

Due to safety concerns there were several rule changes, the most notable being that offensive plays ran only towards the west end zone.

The '''list of sled dog races''' contains dozens of contests created by supporters of [[mushing]], the sport of racing [[sled dog]]s. It is unknown when the first sled dog race was held. Humans have domesticated dogs for thousands of years, and sled dogs have been used for transportation in [[Arctic]] areas for almost as long. The first sled dog race to feature a codified set of rules was the [[All-Alaska Sweepstakes]], which first took place in 1908. This was followed in 1917 by the [[American Dog Derby]], which was the first sled dog race outside [[Alaska]] or the [[Yukon]].&lt;ref&gt;International Sled Dog Racing Association. [http://www.webheads.co.uk/sdcom/press/info/003history.html "History of Sled Dog Racing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721003552/http://www.webheads.co.uk/sdcom/press/info/003history.html |date=2009-07-21 }}. Accessed May 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, sled dog racing was a [[demonstration sport]] at the [[1932 Winter Olympics]] in [[Lake Placid, New York]], but was not included in future games.&lt;ref&gt;White, Tim. [http://www.sleddogsport.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=16&amp;Itemid=29 "A history of mushing before we knew it"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218001428/http://www.sleddogsport.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=16&amp;Itemid=29 |date=2009-02-18 }}. International Federation of Sleddog Sports, Inc. Accessed May 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous sled dog race is the [[Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race]], an annual 1000-mile competition in Alaska. It commemorates the [[1925 serum run to Nome]] but was not begun until 1973. The Iditarod helped restart worldwide interest in mushing, which had been thought of as anachronistic after the spread of snowmobiles. Since mushing's resurgence, the sport has proliferated and sled dog races are hosted in towns around the world, from Norway and Finland to Alaska and Michigan. Due to the cold temperatures needed for sled dog racing, most races are held in winter in cold climates, but occasional carting events, typically known as dryland races, have been held in warmer weather. These are not included in this list because they do not use sleds.

There are three typical types of sled dog races: sprint, mid-distance, and long-distance. These types can be broken down into sub-types. Sprint races cover relatively short distances of 4 to 25 miles/day, mid-distance races cover a total of 100 to 300 miles, and long-distance races cover 300 miles to more than 1,000 miles. Sprint races frequently are two- or three-day events with heats run on successive days with the same dogs on the same course. Mid-distance races are either heat races of 14 to 80 miles per day, or continuous races of 100 to 200 miles. (These categories are informal and may overlap to a certain extent.) Long-distance races may be continuous or stage races, in which participants run a different course each day, usually from a central staging location. Stage races are similar to [[cycling]]'s [[Tour de France]].

Generally, teams start one after another in equal time intervals, competing against the clock rather than directly against one another. This is due to logistic considerations of getting teams of dogs to the starting line for a clean timed start. Mass starts where all of the dog teams start simultaneously are popular in parts of Canada. Another mode of dogsled racing is the ''freight race'', in which a specified weight per dog is carried in the sled.

{{History of Iran}}

The '''Medes'''{{#tag:ref|According to the ''[[OED]]'' entry "Mede", the word is from [[Classical Latin]] ''{{lang|la|Mēdus}}'' (usually as plural, ''{{lang|la|Mēdī}}'') from [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] (Attic and Ionic) {{lang|grc|Μῆδος}} ''Mê̄dos'' {{IPA-grc|mɛ̂ːdos|}} ([[Arcadocypriot Greek|Cypriot]] {{lang|grc|Μᾶδοι}} ''Mâdœ'' {{IPA-grc|mâdoi̯|}}, plural) from [[Old Persian]] ''{{lang|peo-Latn|Māda}}''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]'' Online [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/115629?rskey=kViil4&amp;result=4 "entry Mede, n.".]:&lt;/ref&gt;|group="N"}} ({{IPAc-en|m|iː|d|z}}, [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]] ''{{lang|peo-Latn|Māda-}}'', {{lang-grc|Μῆδοι}}, {{lang-he-n|מָדַי}} ''Madai'') were an [[Iranian peoples|ancient Iranian people]]{{#tag:ref|A) "Archaeological evidence for the religion of the Iranian-speaking Medes of the .." {{harv|Diakonoff|1985|p=140}}. B) "..and the Medes (Iranians of what is now north-west Iran).." {{EIEC|30}}.  C) ".. succeeded in uniting into a kingdom the many Median tribes" (from Encyclopædia Britannica &lt;ref name="EnBr"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica Online [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/372125/Media Media (ancient region, Iran)]&lt;/ref&gt;). D) "Proto-Iranian split into Western (Median, and others) and Eastern (Scythian, Ossetic, Saka, Pamir and others)..." ({{citation| publisher = BRILL| isbn = 978-90-04-16054-5| last = Kuz'mina| first = Elena E.| others = J. P. Mallory (ed.)| title = The origin of the Indo-Iranians | year = 2007|page=303}})|group="N"}} who spoke the [[Median language]] and who inhabited an area known as [[Media (region)|Media]] between [[western Iran|western]] and [[northern Iran|northern Iran]]. Under the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], late 9th to early 7th centuries BC, the region of Media was bounded by the [[Zagros Mountains]] to its west, to its south by the [[Garrin Mountain]] in [[Lorestan Province]], to its northwest by the [[Qaflankuh Mountain Range|Qaflankuh Mountains]] in [[Zanjan Province]], and to its east by the [[Dasht-e Kavir]] desert. It's neighbors were the kingdoms of Gizilbunda and [[Mannea]] in the northwest, and [[Ellipi]] and [[Elam]] in the south.&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/media|title=MEDIA – Encyclopaedia Iranica|website=www.iranicaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 7th century BC, Media's tribes came together to form the '''Median Kingdom''' which remained a Neo-Assyrian vassal. Between 616 to 609 BC, King [[Cyaxares]] (624–585 BC), allied with King [[Nabopolassar]] of the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] against the Neo-Assyrian Empire, after which the '''Median Empire''' stretched across the [[Iranian Plateau]] as far as [[Anatolia]]. Its precise geographical extent remains unknown.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

A few archaeological sites (discovered in the "[[Medes#Archaeological evidence|Median triangle]]" in western Iran) and textual sources (from contemporary [[Assyria]]ns and also [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] in later centuries) provide a brief documentation of the history and culture of the Median state.  Apart from a few personal names, the language of the Medes is unknown. The Medes had an ancient Iranian religion (a form of pre-[[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] Mazdaism&lt;!-- please do not link to Mazdaism--&gt; or [[Mithra]] worshipping) with a priesthood named as "[[Magi]]". Later during the reigns of the last Median kings, the reforms of [[Zoroaster]] spread into western Iran.&lt;!-- sources are in Medes#Religion--&gt;

==Tribes==
According to the [[Histories (Herodotus)|''Histories'' of Herodotus]], there were six Median tribes:&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+1.101 1.101]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Thus [[Deioces]] collected the Medes into a nation, and ruled over them alone. Now these are the tribes of which they consist: the ''Busae'', the ''Paretaceni'', the ''Struchates'', the ''Arizanti'', the ''Budii'', and the ''[[Magi]]''.}}

The six Median tribes resided in Media proper, the triangular area between Rhagae, Aspadana and Ecbatana.&lt;ref name="books.google.no"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Gershevitch|first=I.|title=The Cambridge History of Iran|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kMLKgzj5afMC&amp;pg=PA75|year=1985 |page=75 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-20091-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In present-day [[Iran]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=(Diaconus) |first1=Leo |title=The History of Leo the Deacon: Byzantine Military Expansion in the Tenth Century |date=2005 |publisher=Dumbarton Oaks |isbn=9780884023241 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCDsV41k8A0C&amp;pg=PA204 |page=204 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is the area between [[Tehran]], [[Isfahan]] and Hamadan, respectively.

==Etymology==
The original source for their name and homeland is a directly transmitted [[Old Iranian]] geographical name which is attested as the [[Old Persian]] "Māda-" ({{small|singular masculine}}).&lt;ref name=Tavernier/&gt; The meaning of this word is not precisely known.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Diakonoff|1985|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the linguist [[Wojciech Skalmowski|W. Skalmowski]] proposes a relation with the [[Proto-Indo-European language|proto-Indo European]] word "med(h)-", meaning "central, suited in the middle", by referring to the [[Old Indic]] "madhya-" and Old Iranian "maidiia-" which both carry the same meaning.&lt;ref name=Tavernier&gt;{{harv|Tavernier|2007|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin ''medium'', Greek ''méso'' and German ''mittel'' are similarly derived from it.

Greek scholars during antiquity would base [[ethnological]] conclusions on Greek legends and the similarity of names.

==Archaeology==
[[File:Ecbatane - excavated house.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Excavation from ancient Ecbatane, Hamadan, Iran]]
The discoveries of Median sites in [[Iran]] happened only after the 1960s.&lt;ref name="stronach-EIr-288"&gt;{{harv|Stronach1982|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 1960 the search for Median archeological sources has mostly focused in an area known as the “Median triangle,” defined roughly as the region bounded by [[Hamadān]] and [[Malāyer]] (in [[Hamadan Province]]) and [[Kangāvar]] (in [[Kermanshah Province]]).&lt;ref name="stronach-EIr-288"/&gt; Three major sites from central western Iran in the [[Three-age system|Iron Age III period]] (i.e. 850–500 BC) are:&lt;ref name=Young-p449&gt;{{harv|Young|1997|p=449}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Noushijan Tappe|Tepe Nush-i Jan]] (a primarily religious site of Median period),
:The site is located 14 km west of Malāyer in Hamadan province.&lt;ref name="stronach-EIr-288"/&gt; The excavations started in 1967 with [[David Stronach|D. Stronach]] as the director.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Stronach|1968|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of four main buildings in the site are "the central temple, the western temple, the fort, and the columned hall" which according to Stronach were likely to have been built in the order named and predate the latter occupation of the first half of the 6th century BC.&lt;ref name="stronach-EIr-290"/&gt; According to Stronach, the central temple, with its stark design, "provides a notable, if mute, expression of religious belief and practice".&lt;ref name="stronach-EIr-290"/&gt; A number of ceramics from the Median levels at Tepe Nush-i Jan have been found which are associated with a period (the second half of the 7th century BC) of power consolidation in the Hamadān areas. These findings show four different wares known as “common ware” (buff, cream, or light red in colour and with gold or silver mica temper) including jars in various size the largest of which is a form of ribbed [[pithos|pithoi]]. Smaller and more elaborate vessels were in “grey ware”, (these display smoothed and burnished surface). The “cooking ware” and “crumbly ware” are also recognized each in single handmade products.&lt;ref name="stronach-EIr-290"&gt;{{harv|Stronach|1982|p=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Godin Tepe]] ([[Godin Tepe#Level II|its period II]]: a fortified palace of a Median king or tribal chief),
:The site is located 13 km east of Kangāvar city on the left bank of the river Gamas Āb". The excavations, started in 1965, were led by T. C. Young, Jr. which according to [[David Stronach]], evidently shows an important [[Bronze Age]] construction that was reoccupied sometime before the beginning of the [[Iron age|Iron III]] period. The excavations of Young indicate the remains of part of a single residence of a local ruler which later became quite substantial.&lt;ref name="stronach-EIr-288"/&gt; This is similar to those mentioned often in Assyrian sources.&lt;ref name=Young-p449/&gt;
* [[Baba Jan, East Azerbaijan]] (probably the seat of a lesser tribal ruler of Media).
:The site is located in northeastern Luristan with a distance of roughly 10 km from Nūrābād in Lurestan province. The excavations were conducted by C. Goff in 1966–69. The second level of this site probably dates to the 7th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Henrickson|1988|p=?}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These sources have both similarities (in cultural characteristics) and differences (due to functional differences and diversity among the Median tribes).&lt;ref name=Young-p449/&gt; The architecture of these archaeological findings, that can probably be dated to the Median period, show a link between the tradition of columned audience halls often seen in Achaemenid (for example in Persepolis) and Safavid Iran (for example in "[[Chehel Sotoun]]" from the 17th century AD) and the Median architecture.&lt;ref name=Young-p449/&gt;

The materials found at Tepe Nush-i Jan, Godin Tepe, and other sites located in Media together with the Assyrian reliefs show the existence of urban settlements in Media in the first half of the 1st millennium BC which had functioned as centres for the production of handicrafts and also of an agricultural and cattle-breeding economy of a secondary type.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dandamayev|Medvedskaya|2006|p=?}}&lt;/ref&gt; For other historical documentation, the archaeological evidence, though rare, together with cuneiform records by Assyrian make it possible, regardless of Herodotus' accounts, to establish some of the early history of Medians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Young|1997|p=448}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[Image:Persepolis Apadana noerdliche Treppe Detail.jpg|thumb|upright=1|The Apadana Palace, northern stairway, 5th century BC [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] [[relief|bas-relief]] shows a Mede soldier behind a Persian soldier, in [[Persepolis]], Iran]]
An early description of Media from the end of the 9th century BC to the beginning of the 7th century BC comes from the Assyrians. The southern border of Media, in that period, is named as the [[Elam]]ite region of Simaški in present-day [[Lorestan Province]]. To the west and northwest, Media was bounded by the [[Zagros Mountains]] and from the east by the [[Dasht-e Kavir]] desert. This region of Media was ruled by the Assyrians and for them the region fell "along the [[Great Khorasan Road]] from just east of Harhar to Alwand, and probably beyond."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Levine|1974|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The location of Harhar is suggested to be "the central or eastern" [[Mahidasht District]] in [[Kermanshah Province]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Levine|1974|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It's borders were limited on the north by the non-Iranian states of Gizilbunda and [[Mannea]], and to its south by [[Ellipi]] and [[Elam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Levine|1974|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; Gizilbunda was located in the [[Qaflankuh Mountain Range|Qaflankuh Mountains]], and Ellipi was located in the south of modern Lorestan Province.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; On the east and southeast of Media, as described by the Assyrians, another land with the name of "Patušarra" appears. This land was located near a mountain range which the Assyrians call "Bikni" and describe as "Lapis Lazuli Mountain". There are differing opinions on the location of this mountain. [[Mount Damavand]] of [[Tehran]] and [[Alvand]] of Hamadan are two proposed sites. This location is the most remote eastern area that the Assyrians knew of or reached during their expansion until the beginning of the 7th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Levine|1974|pp=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Achaemenid sources, specifically from the [[Behistun Inscription]] (2.76, 77–78), the capital of Media is [[Ecbatana]], called "Hamgmatāna-" in Old Persian ([[Elamite language|Elamite]]:''Agmadana-''; Babylonian: ''Agamtanu-'') corresponding to modern-day [[Hamadan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Levine|1974|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other cities existing in Media were [[Laodicea (Mesopotamia)|Laodicea]] (modern [[Nahavand]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Ayatollahi|first=Habibollah|title=The Book of Iran: The History of Iranian Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Al0jpyRDGe8C&amp;pg=PA93|year=2003|publisher=Alhoda UK|isbn=978-964-94491-4-2}}, page 93&lt;/ref&gt; and the mound that was the largest city of the Medes, Rhages (present-day [[Rey, Iran|Rey]]). The fourth city of Media was [[Apamea (Media)|Apamea]], near Ecbatana, whose precise location is now unknown. In later periods, Medes and especially Mede soldiers are identified and portrayed prominently in ancient archaeological sites such as [[Persepolis]], where they are shown to have a major role and presence in the military of the [[Achaemenid Empire]].

==History==
===Prehistory===
[[File:Pre-Achaemenid Era.gif|thumb|350px|Timeline of Pre-Achaemenid era.]]
At the end of the 2nd millennium BC, the Iranian tribes emerged in the region of northwest Iran. These tribes expanded their control over larger areas. Subsequently, the boundaries of Media changed over a period of several hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Diakonoff|1985|pp=36–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] tribes were present in western and northwestern Iran from at least the 12th or 11th centuries BC. But the significance of Iranian elements in these regions were established from the beginning of the second half of the 8th century BC.&lt;ref name=dandamaev-lukonin-2-3&gt;{{harv|Dandamaev|Lukonin|Kohl|Dadson|2004|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time the Iranian tribes were the majority in what later become the territory of the Median Kingdom and also the west of [[Medes#Historical geography of Media|Media proper]].&lt;ref name=dandamaev-lukonin-2-3/&gt; A study of textual sources from the region shows that in the Neo-Assyrian period, the regions of Media, and further to the west and the northwest, had a population with Iranian speaking people as the majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Zadok|2002|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This period of migration coincided with a power vacuum in the [[Near East]] with the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365–1020 BC), which had dominated northwestern Iran and eastern [[Anatolia]] and the [[Caucasus]], going into a comparative decline. This allowed new peoples to pass through and settle. In addition [[Elam]], the dominant power in Iran, was suffering a period of severe weakness, as was [[Babylonia]] to the west.

In western and northwestern Iran and in areas further west prior to Median rule, there is evidence of the earlier political activity of the powerful societies of Elam, Mannaea, [[Assyria]] and [[Urartu]] .&lt;ref name="dandamaev-lukonin-2-3" /&gt; There are various and up-dated opinions on the positions and activities of Iranian tribes in these societies and prior to the "major Iranian state formations" in the late 7th century BC.&lt;ref name="dandamaev-lukonin-2-3" /&gt; One opinion (of Herzfeld, ''et al.'') is that the ruling class were "Iranian migrants" but the society was "autonomous" while another opinion (of Grantovsky, ''et al.'') holds that both the ruling class and basic elements of the population were Iranian.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dandamaev|Lukonin|Kohl|Dadson|2004|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise and fall===
From the 10th to the late 7th centuries BC, the western parts of Media fell under the domination of the vast [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] based in northern [[Mesopotamia]], which stretched from [[Cyprus]] in the west, to parts of western Iran in the east, and [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and the north of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. Assyrian kings such as [[Tiglath-Pileser III]], [[Sargon II]], [[Sennacherib]], [[Esarhaddon]], [[Ashurbanipal]] and [[Ashur-etil-ilani]] imposed ''Vassal Treaties'' upon the Median rulers, and also protected them from predatory raids by marauding [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Georges Roux]], ''Ancient Iraq'', 1992{{full citation needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reign of [[Sinsharishkun]] (622–612 BC), the Assyrian empire, which had been in a state of constant civil war since 626 BC, began to unravel. Subject peoples, such as the Medes, Babylonians, [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Egyptians]], Scythians, Cimmerians, [[Lydians]] and [[Arameans]] quietly ceased to pay tribute to Assyria.

Neo-Assyrian dominance over the Medians came to an end during the reign of Median King [[Cyaxares]], who, in alliance with King [[Nabopolassar]] of the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]], attacked and destroyed the strife-riven empire between 616 and 609 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/place/Assyria/ Encyclopaedia Britannica] "The last great Assyrian ruler was Ashurbanipal, but his last years and the period following his death, in 627 BCE, are obscure. The state was finally destroyed by a Chaldean-Median coalition in 612–609 bce."&lt;/ref&gt; The newfound alliance helped the Medes to capture [[Nineveh]] in 612 BC, which resulted in the eventual collapse of the Neo-Assyrian Empire by 609 BC. The Medes were subsequently able to establish their Median Kingdom (with [[Ecbatana]] as their royal capital) beyond their original homeland and had eventually a territory stretching roughly from northeastern Iran to the [[Kızılırmak River]] in [[Anatolia]]. After the fall of Assyria between 616 BC and 609 BC, a unified Median state was formed, which together with Babylonia, [[Lydia]], and [[ancient Egypt]] became one of the four major powers of the [[ancient Near East]].

[[Cyaxares]] was succeeded by his son King [[Astyages]]. In 553 BC, his maternal grandson [[Cyrus the Great]], the King of [[Anshan (Persia)|Anshan]]/Persia, a Median vassal, revolted against Astyages. In 550 BC, Cyrus finally won a decisive victory resulting in Astyages' capture by his own dissatisfied nobles, who promptly turned him over to the triumphant Cyrus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Cyrus to Alexander: A History of the Persian Empire|first= Pierre|last= Briant|publisher= Eisenbrauns|year= 2006|page= 31}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Cyrus's victory against Astyages, the Medes were subjected to their close kin, the Persians.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''The Histories'', p. 93.{{full citation needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the new empire they retained a prominent position; in honour and war, they stood next to the Persians; their court ceremony was adopted by the new sovereigns, who in the summer months resided in [[Ecbatana]]; and many noble Medes were employed as officials, [[satrap]]s and generals.

===Median dynasty===
The list of Median rulers and their period of reign compiled according to two sources. Firstly, Herodotus who calls them "kings" and associates them with the same family. Secondly, the Babylonian Chronicle which in "Gadd's Chronicle on the Fall of Nineveh" gives its own list. A combined list stretching over 150 years is thus:

* [[Deioces]] (700–647 BC)
* [[Phraortes]] (647–625 BC)
* [[Scythians|Scythian]] rule (624–597 BC)
* [[Cyaxares]] (624–585 BC)
* [[Astyages]] (585–549 BC)&lt;ref name="Diakonoff1985"&gt;{{harv|Diakonoff|1985|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all of these dates and personalities given by Herodotus match the other near eastern sources.&lt;ref name="Diakonoff1985" /&gt;

In Herodotus (book 1, chapters 95–130), [[Deioces]] is introduced as the founder of a centralised Median state. He had been known to the Median people as "a just and incorruptible man" and when asked by the Median people to solve their possible disputes he agreed and put forward the condition that they make him "king" and build a great city at Ecbatana as the capital of the Median state.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Young|1988|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judging from the contemporary sources of the region and disregarding&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Young|1988|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the account of Herodotus puts the formation of a unified Median state during the reign of [[Cyaxares]] or later.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Young|1988|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture and society==
Greek references to "Median" people make no clear distinction between the "Persians" and the "Medians"; in fact for a Greek to become "too closely associated with Iranian culture" was "to become Medianized, not Persianized".&lt;ref name="Young-p449" /&gt; The Median Kingdom was a short-lived Iranian state and the textual and archaeological sources of that period are rare and little could be known from the Median culture which nevertheless made a "profound, and lasting, contribution to the greater world of Iranian culture".&lt;ref name=Young-p450&gt;{{harv|Young|1997|p=450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
{{Main article|Median language}}
Median people spoke the Median language, which was an Old Iranian language. [[Strabo]]'s ''[[Geographica]]'' (finished in the early first century) mentions the affinity of Median with other [[Iranian languages]]: "The name of'' [[Ariana]] ''is further extended to a part of Persia and of Media, as also to the [[Bactria]]ns and [[Sogdia]]ns on the north; for these speak approximately the same language, but with slight variations".&lt;ref&gt;Geography, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239%3Abook%3D15%3Achapter%3D2%3Asection%3D8 Strab. 15.2.8]&lt;/ref&gt;

No original deciphered text has been proven to have been written in the Median language. It is suggested that similar to the later Iranian practice of keeping archives of written documents in Achaemenid Iran, there was also a maintenance of archives by the Median government in their capital Ecbatana. There are examples of "Median literature" found in later records. One is according to Herodotus that the Median king Deioces, appearing as a judge, made judgement on causes submitted in writing. There is also a report by Dinon on the existence of "Median court poets".&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gershevitch|1968|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Median literature is part of the "Old Iranian literature" (including also Saka, Old Persian, Avestan) as this Iranian affiliation of them is explicit also in ancient texts, such as Herodotus's account&lt;ref name="Herodotus-vii-62"/&gt; that many peoples including Medes were "universally called Iranian".&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gershevitch|1968|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Words of Median origin appear in various other Iranian dialects, including [[Old Persian]]. A feature of Old Persian inscriptions is the large number of words and names from other languages and the Median language takes in this regard a special place for historical reasons.&lt;ref name=Schmitt2008-p98/&gt; The Median words in Old Persian texts, whose Median origin can be established by "phonetic criteria",&lt;ref name=Schmitt2008-p98/&gt; appear "more frequently among royal titles and among terms of the chancellery, military, and judicial affairs".&lt;ref name=Schmitt2008-p98&gt;{{harv|Schmitt|2008|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Words of Median origin include:

===Religion===

There are very limited sources concerning the religion of Median people. Primary sources pointing to religious affiliations of Medes found so far include the archaeological discoveries in Tepe Nush-e Jan, personal names of Median individuals, and the Histories of Herodotus. The archaeological source gives the earliest of the temple structures in Iran and the "stepped fire altar" discovered there is linked to the common Iranian legacy of the "cult of fire". Herodotus mentions [[Magi#In Iranian sources|Median Magi]] as a Median tribe providing priests for both the Medes and the Persians. They had a "priestly caste" which passed their functions from father to son. They played a significant role in the court of the Median king Astyages who had in his court certain Medians as "advisers, dream interpreters, and soothsayers". Classical historians "unanimously" regarded the Magi as priests of the Zoroastrian faith. From the personal names of Medes as recorded by Assyrians (in 8th and 9th centuries BC) there are examples of the use of the Indo-Iranian word ''arta-'' (lit. "truth") which is familiar from both Avestan and Old Persian and also examples of [[theophoric name]]s containing ''Maždakku'' and also the name "Ahura Mazdā".&lt;ref name=EIR-MediaReligion&gt;{{harv|Dandamayev|Medvedskaya|2006|loc=Median Religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars disagree whether these are indications of Zoroastrian religion amongst the Medes. [[Diakonoff]] believes that "Astyages and perhaps even Cyaxares had already embraced a religion derived from the teachings of Zoroaster" which was not identical with doctrine of [[Zarathustra]] and [[Mary Boyce]] believes that "the existence of the Magi in Media with their own traditions and forms of worship was an obstacle to Zoroastrian proselytizing there".&lt;ref name=EIR-MediaReligion/&gt; Boyce wrote that the Zoroastrian traditions in the Median city of Ray probably goes back to the 8th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Boyce|Grenet|1991|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested that from the 8th century BC, a form of "Mazdaism with common Iranian traditions" existed in Media and the strict [[Zoroastrianism|reforms of Zarathustra]] began to spread in western Iran during the reign of the last Median kings in the 6th century BC.&lt;ref name=EIR-MediaReligion/&gt;

It has also been suggested{{by who|date=November 2016}} that [[Mithra]] is a Median name and Medes may have practised [[Mithraism]] and had Mithra as their supreme deity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Soudavar|2003|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kurds and Medes==
{{main article|Origin of the Kurds}}

Russian historian and linguist [[Vladimir Minorsky]] suggested that the Medes, who widely inhabited the land where currently the [[Kurds]] form a majority, might have been forefathers of the modern Kurds. He also states that the Medes who invaded the region in the eighth century BC, linguistically resembled the Kurds. This view was accepted by many Kurdish nationalists in the twentieth century. However, [[Martin van Bruinessen]], a Dutch scholar, argues against the attempt to take the Medes as ancestors of the Kurds.&lt;ref name="Ozoglu25"&gt;Hakan Özoğlu, ''Kurdish notables and the Ottoman state: Evolving Identities, Competing Loyalties, and Shifting Boundaries'', SUNY Press, 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CttLWEaTrJUC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=%22many+Kurdish+nationalists+in+the+twentieth+century%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0TQ_TpexHKWImQXU-dSSCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22many%20Kurdish%20nationalists%20in%20the%20twentieth%20century%22&amp;f=false p. 25.]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Though some Kurdish intellectuals claim that their people are descended from the Medes, there is no evidence to permit such a connection across the considerable gap in time between the political dominance of the Medes and the first attestation of the Kurds" - van Bruinessen&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Contemporary linguistic evidence has challenged the previously suggested view that the Kurds are descendants of the Medes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cxr_vqpwVUkC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=%22kurds+are+descendants%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2hTVTrrnIMzT4QSmponTAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22kurds%20are%20descendants%22&amp;f=false|title=Turkey Foreign Policy and Government Guide|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EzzYk_gzpJ0C&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=%22kurds+are+descendants%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BBbVTpTgGKnf4QTqx-D0AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CF8Q6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22kurds%20are%20descendants%22&amp;f=false|title=Turkey|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gernot Windfuhr]], professor of Iranian Studies, identified the [[Kurdish languages]] as [[Parthian language|Parthian]], albeit with a [[Median language|Median]] substratum.&lt;ref&gt;Windfuhr, Gernot (1975), "Isoglosses: A Sketch on Persians and Parthians, Kurds and Medes", Monumentum H.S. Nyberg II (Acta Iranica-5), Leiden: 457–471&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Neil MacKenzie]], an authority on the Kurdish language, said Kurdish was closer to Persian and questioned the “traditional” view holding that Kurdish, because of its differences from Persian, should be regarded a [[Northwestern Iranian language]].&lt;ref name=Paul&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Paul  |first=Ludwig | title= KURDISH LANGUAGE i. HISTORY OF THE KURDISH LANGUAGE | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica | accessdate=2016-10-31|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kurdish-language-i}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garnik Asatrian stated that "The Central Iranian dialects, and primarily those of the Kashan area in the first place, as well as the Azari dialects (otherwise called Southern Tati) are probably the only Iranian dialects, which can pretend to be the direct offshoots of Median... In general, the relationship between Kurdish and Median are not closer than the affinities between the latter and other North Western dialects — Baluchi, Talishi, South Caspian, Zaza, Gurani, etc."&lt;ref&gt;G. Asatrian, ''Prolegomena to the Study of the Kurds'', Iran and the Caucasus, Vol. 13, pp. 1–58, 2009. (p. 21 [https://archive.org/stream/ProlegomenaToTheStudyOfTheKurds/Asatrian_kurds_djvu.txt])&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Meltdown''' is a [[France|French]] bar chain dedicated to [[video games]] and [[eSports]].

==History==
Based on the idea of a permanent [[Barcraft]], the first bar Meltdown was established in 2012 in [[Paris]] in a small bistro on [[rue Albert-Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leparisien.fr/high-tech/le-premier-bar-d-e-sport-en-europe-a-ouvert-a-paris-25-12-2012-2433857.php,"Le premier bar d'esport en Europe a ouvert à Paris"]&lt;/ref&gt; It streamed [[eSports]] competitions and had computers and consoles available for use by its clientele. The bar moved to a new location on {{Interlanguage link multi|Passage Thiéré|fr}}, in the [[11th arrondissement of Paris]] on December 21, 2013.

Meltdown is developing in France and abroad with a [[franchising|franchise]] platform. There are 20 bars in 7 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.meltdown.bar/], Meltdown, [https://www.meltdown.bar/ "Meltdown Esports Bars"], on www.meltdown.bar (accessed on September 14th 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Meltdown Paris Competition League of Legends.jpg|thumb|Meltdown Paris Competition League of Legends]]

==Model==
Meltdown has a menu of cocktails inspired by the video game universe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberation.fr/ecrans/2012/05/07/au-comptoir-des-geeks_949009?page=article], [http://www.liberation.fr/ecrans/2012/05/07/au-comptoir-des-geeks_949009?page=article "Au comptior des geeks"]&lt;/ref&gt;

A schedule, varying depending on the city, highlights one specific game each day of the week, with the organisation of a free access tournament. Outside of tournament hours, computers and consoles are available for customers to play games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uptech.mensup.fr/jeux-video/news-trailers.html], [http://uptech.mensup.fr/jeux-video/news-trailers.html "Rencontre avec Yann-Cédric Mainguy, co-fondateur du Meltdown"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meltdown bars broadcast major [[eSports]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lejdd.fr/Societe/Actualite/Le-phenomene-e-sport-624572], [http://www.lejdd.fr/Societe/Actualite/Le-phenomene-e-sport-624572 "Le phénomène e-sport"]&lt;/ref&gt; competitions on their screens. Meltdown has had a presence at [[gaming conventions]] such as [[Paris Games Week]] and [[Dreamhack]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

=== Professional Players ===
A team of professional players was created by Meltdown in 2014. The first player to wear its colors was [[Olivier Hay|Olivier “Louffy” Hay]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.lefigaro.fr/figaro/video/meltdown-luffy-champion-de-l-evo-une-grosse-fierte-pour-l-europe-et-pour-la-france-(interview-english-sub)/3702882141001/], [http://video.lefigaro.fr/figaro/video/meltdown-luffy-champion-de-l-evo-une-grosse-fierte-pour-l-europe-et-pour-la-france-(interview-english-sub)/3702882141001/ "Meltdown Luffy, champion de l'Evo : "Une grosse fierté pour l'Europe et pour la France"]&lt;/ref&gt; followed by [[Ilyes “Stephano” Satouri]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.team-aaa.com/news-29449-tous-0-stephano_quitte_eg_pour_le_meltdown.html],[http://www.team-aaa.com/news-29449-tous-0-stephano_quitte_eg_pour_le_meltdown.html "Stephano quitte EG pour le Meltdown"]&lt;/ref&gt; The player Florent “Neo” Lecoanet, a world champion of Super Mario Kart, has since joined the team.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Expansion==
The creation of the Meltdown franchise was announced in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeuxvideo.com/reportages-videos-jeux/0000/00000000/un-bar-dedie-a-l-e-sport-00111039.htm], [http://www.jeuxvideo.com/reportages-videos-jeux/0000/00000000/un-bar-dedie-a-l-e-sport-00111039.htm "Reportage - Un bar dedié l'e-sport"]&lt;/ref&gt; The bars currently open are:

'''Miss World 1984''', the 34th edition of the [[Miss World]] pageant, was held on 15 November 1984 at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London, UK.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk"/&gt; The winner was [[Astrid Carolina Herrera]] from Venezuela.

"'''Mississippi Goddam'''" is a song written and performed by American singer and pianist [[Nina Simone]], who later announced the anthem to be her "first civil rights song"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feldstein|first=Ruth|authorlink=Ruth Feldstein|date=March 1, 2005|title="I Don't Trust You Anymore": Nina Simone, Culture, and Black Activism in the 1960s|url=|journal=Journal of American History|volume=|pages=1349|via=ignacio}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It was released on her album ''[[Nina Simone in Concert]]'' in 1964. The album was based on recordings of three concerts she gave at [[Carnegie Hall]] in 1964. The album was her first release for the Dutch label [[Philips Records]] and is indicative of the more political turn her recorded music took during this period.   

Simone composed "Mississippi Goddam" in less than an hour. Together with "[[Four Women (song)|Four Women]]" and "[[To Be Young, Gifted and Black]]", it is one of her most famous [[protest song]]s and self-written compositions.

==Interpretation==
The song captures Simone's response to the murder of [[Medgar Evers]] in Mississippi; and the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], killing four black children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Nina Simone's Time Is Now, Again|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/movies/nina-simones-time-is-now-again.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = June 19, 2015|access-date = 2015-07-05|issn = 0362-4331|first = Salamishah|last = Tillet}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the recording she cynically announces the song as "a [[show tune]], but the show hasn't been written for it yet." The song begins jauntily, with a show tune feel, but demonstrates its political focus early on with its refrain "Alabama's got me so upset, Tennessee's made me lose my rest, and everybody knows about Mississippi ''goddam.''" In the song she says: "Keep on sayin' 'go slow'...to do things gradually would bring more tragedy. Why don't you see it? Why don't you feel it? I don't know, I don't know. You don't have to live next to me, just give me my equality!''
"

== Reception ==
Simone first performed the song at the [[The Village Gate|Village Gate]] nightclub in [[Greenwich Village]], and shortly thereafter in March 1964 at Carnegie Hall, in front of a mostly white audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A raised voice: How Nina Simone turned the movement into music|url = http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/08/11/raised-voice|website = The New Yorker|accessdate =July 5, 2015|date =August 11, 2014|last = Pierpont|first = Claudia Roth}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Carnegie Hall recording was subsequently released as a single and became an anthem during the [[Civil Rights Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nina Simone Reveals 'Mississippi Goddam' Song 'Hurt My Career'|work=Jet|date=March 24, 1986|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C7EDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=%22mississippi+goddam%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o_kDT6rhKIivgweo5_GfAg&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22mississippi%20goddam%22&amp;f=false|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Mississippi Goddam" was banned in several Southern states, ostensibly because of the word "goddam" in the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/music/2010/03/mississippi-goddam-nina-simone |title=Top 20 Political Songs: Mississippi Goddam – Nina Simone – 1964 |date=March 25, 2010 |newspaper=[[New Statesman]] |first=Ian K. |last=Smith }}&lt;/ref&gt; Boxes of promotional singles sent to radio stations around the country were returned with each record cracked in half.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How the Civil-Rights Era Made and Broke Nina Simone|url = https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/06/nina-simone-and-mississippi-goddam/396923/|accessdate =July 5, 2015|date =June 27, 2015|website = The Atlantic|last = Chandler|first = Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simone performed the song in front of 10,000 people at the end of the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] when she and other black activists, including [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]] and [[Harry Belafonte]] crossed police lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Almost Forgotten Selma March|url = http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/03/20/the-forgotten-second-selma-march.html|website = The Daily Beast|date = March 20, 2015|accessdate =July 5, 2015|first = Gary|last = May}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wikisource|Niger documents}}

The '''Niger uranium forgeries''' were forged documents initially released in 2001 by [[SISMI]] (Italian military intelligence), which seem to depict an attempt made by [[Saddam Hussein]] in [[Iraq]] to purchase [[yellowcake uranium]] powder from [[Niger]] during the [[Iraq disarmament crisis]]. On the basis of these documents and other indicators, the governments of the [[Federal government of the United States|United States]] and the [[Government of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] asserted that Iraq violated [[United Nations]] [[Iraq sanctions]] by attempting to procure nuclear material for the purpose of creating [[weapons of mass destruction]].

==Abbreviated timetable==
The first report of these documents was in a [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) Senior Executive Intelligence brief dated 18 October 2001, entitled: "Iraq: Nuclear Related Procurement Efforts."  This information was not considered to be certain and not much was done to promote this claim right away.

These documents were sent to the CIA office in [[Rome]] by SISMI.

On 10 May 2002, the CIA's Office of Near Eastern and South Asian Analysis (NESA) in the [[Central Intelligence Agency#Directorate of Intelligence|Directorate of Intelligence]] (DI) prepared a Principals Committee briefing book updating the status of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs. The document noted that a "foreign government service says Iraq was trying to acquire 500 tons of uranium from Niger."

On 22 July 2002, the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE) published an intelligence product (Daily Intelligence Highlight, Nuclear Reconstitution Efforts Underway?) which highlighted the intelligence on the Iraq-Niger uranium deal as one of three indications that Iraq might be reconstituting its nuclear program.&lt;ref name="Intelligence"&gt;{{cite book|author=United States.

Select Committee on Intelligence|title=Report on the Intelligence on the U.S. Intelligence Community's Prewar Intelligence Assessments on Iraq , July 9, 2004, Ordered Reported on July 7, 2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FhxVroTCvuQC&amp;pg=PA48|publisher=Government Printing Office|pages=48–|id=GGKEY:ZQL5FY25BSB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second and third dissemination===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
There was a second and third dissemination of these forged documents to the United States by SISMI in early September 2002. One source was a suspicious "ex-agent," of SISMI who occasionally worked on and off for them, who was selling the documents.

Far more officially,  [[Nicolò Pollari]], chief of SISMI, brought the Niger yellowcake story directly to the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|White House]],  meeting secretly in Washington on 9 September 2002, with then–[[Deputy National Security Advisor]] [[Stephen Hadley]]. In that month, the claims of Saddam trying to buy yellowcake uranium from Niger became much stronger.
In September 2002, the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA) published an intelligence assessment (Defense Intelligence Assessment, Iraq's Reemerging Nuclear Program) which outlined Iraq's recent efforts to rebuild its nuclear program including uranium acquisition. On this issue, the assessment said "Iraq has been vigorously trying to procure uranium ore and yellowcake."

On 11 September 2002, [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] (NSC) staff contacted the CIA to clear language for possible use by the President, Bush. The language cleared by the CIA said, "Iraq has made several attempts to buy high strength aluminum tubes used in centrifuges to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. And we also know this: within the past few years, Iraq has resumed efforts to obtain large quantities of a type of uranium oxide known as yellowcake, which is an essential ingredient of this process."

In October 2002 the Intelligence Community (IC) produced a [[Classified information|classified]], 90-page [[National Intelligence Estimate]] (NIE) on Iraq's WMD programmes which cited reports that Iraq began "vigorously trying to procure" more uranium from Niger, as well as Somalia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The specific mention of yellowcake and Niger was not in this speech. There are many reports of a struggle about this, saying the Niger uranium claims were initially in this Cincinnati speech but taken out by the insistence of the [[Director of Central Intelligence|CIA Director]] [[George Tenet]].

==Iraq and WMD==
In late 2002, the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]  began soliciting support for war in Iraq using the political slogan "[[coalition of the willing]]" to refer to what later became the [[Multinational Force - Iraq]]. To back up its claim that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, that administration referred to intelligence from Italy, Britain, and France detailing interactions between [[Saddam Hussein]] and the governments of Niger, [[Somalia]], and the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]. Specifically, CIA director [[George Tenet]] and [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]] both cited attempts by Hussein to obtain uranium from Niger in their September testimony before the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]]. At that time, using information derived from the same source, the UK government also publicly reported an attempted purchase from an (unnamed) "African country". In December, the [[United States Department of State]] issued a fact sheet listing the alleged Niger yellowcake affair in a report entitled "Illustrative Examples of Omissions From the Iraqi Declaration to the United Nations Security Council."&lt;ref&gt;

== Initial doubts ==
The classified documents detailing an Iraqi approach to purchase yellowcake [[uranium]] from Niger were considered dubious by some analysts in U.S. intelligence, according to news accounts. By early 2002, separate investigations by both the CIA and the US State Department had found the documents to be inaccurate. Days before the Iraq invasion, the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) voiced serious doubt on the authenticity of the documents to the [[UN Security Council]], judging them counterfeit.&lt;ref name="Ensor 2003"&gt;{{cite web | last=Ensor | first=David | title=Fake Iraq documents 'embarrassing' for U.S. - Mar. 14, 2003 | website=CNN.com | date=2003-03-14 | url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/03/14/sprj.irq.documents/ | access-date=2018-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Sixteen Words" controversy in 2003 State of the Union==
In his [[2003 State of the Union Address|January 2003 State of the Union speech]], U.S. President George W. Bush said, "The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa."&lt;ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', when occupying troops found no evidence of a current nuclear program, the statement and how it came to be in the speech became a focus for critics in Washington and foreign capitals to press the case that the White House manipulated facts to take the United States to war. The Post reported, "Dozens of interviews with current and former intelligence officials and policymakers in the United States, Britain, France and Italy show that the Bush administration disregarded key information available at the time showing that the Iraq-Niger claim was highly questionable."&lt;ref&gt;Eisner, Peter. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/02/AR2007040201777_pf.html/ "How Bogus Letter Became a Case for War"], The Washington Post, 3 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; With the release of the 2002 NIE report, the Bush administration was criticized for including the statement in the State of the Union despite CIA and State Department reports questioning its veracity.

== European and French intelligence reports ==
The front page of the 28 June 2004 ''[[Financial Times]]'' carried a report from their national security correspondent, Mark Huband, describing that between 1999 and 2001, three unnamed European intelligence services were aware that Niger was possibly engaged in illicit negotiations over the export of its uranium ore with [[North Korea]], [[Libya]], Iraq, [[Iran]], and [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;

Although the claims made in the British intelligence report regarding Iraq's interest in yellowcake ore from Niger were never withdrawn, the CIA and Department of State could not verify them and are said to have thought the claims were "highly dubious".&lt;ref&gt;

==U.S. doubts==
Previously, in February 2002, three different American officials had made efforts to verify the reports. The deputy commander of U.S. Armed Forces Europe, Marine General [[Carlton W. Fulford, Jr.]], went to Niger and met with the country's president, [[Tandja Mamadou]]. He concluded that, given the controls on Niger's uranium supply, there was little chance any of it could have been diverted to Iraq. His report was sent to the Chairman of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], Gen. [[Richard Myers]]. The U.S. Ambassador to Niger, [[Barbro Owens-Kirkpatrick]], was also present at the meeting and sent similar conclusions to the State Department.&lt;ref name="globalsecurity.org"&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/congress/2004_rpt/iraq-wmd-intell_chapter2-b.htm "Report on the U.S. Intelligence Community's Prewar Intelligence Assessments on Iraq"], Chapter 2-B, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; CNN reported on 14 March 2003 (before invasion) that the International Atomic Energy Agency found the documents to be forged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/03/14/sprj.irq.documents/index.html|title=CNN.com - Fake Iraq documents 'embarrassing' for U.S. - Mar. 14, 2003|first=David Ensor CNN Washington|last=Bureau|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wilson and Niger==
In late February 2002, the CIA sent Ambassador [[Joseph C. Wilson|Joseph Wilson]] to investigate the claims himself.  Wilson had been posted to Niger 14 years earlier, and throughout a diplomatic career in Africa he had built up a large network of contacts in Niger.  Wilson interviewed former prime minister of Niger, [[Ibrahim Assane Mayaki]], who reported that he knew of no attempted sales to Iraq. Mayaki did however recall that in June 1999 an Iraqi delegation had expressed interest in "expanding commercial relations", which he had interpreted to mean yellowcake sales.&lt;ref&gt;

|postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt;
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ultimately, Wilson concluded that there was no way that production at the uranium mines could be ramped up or that the excess uranium could have been exported without it being immediately obvious to many people both in the private sector and in the government of Niger. He returned home and told the CIA that the reports were "unequivocally wrong".&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA retained this information in its Counter Proliferation Department and it was not passed up to the CIA Director, according to the unanimous findings of the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee's July 2004 report.

===Criticism===
Former Ambassador Wilson had claimed that he found no evidence of Saddam Hussein ever attempting or buying yellowcake uranium from Niger on his trip to Niger.&lt;ref name="WilsonAfrica"&gt;
{{Citation

|postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt;
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence suggested that the evidence Wilson found could be interpreted differently:

{{quote|[Wilson's] intelligence report indicated that former Nigerien Prime Minister Ibrahim Mayaki was unaware of any contracts that had been signed between Niger and any rogue states for the sale of yellowcake while he was Prime Minister (1997-1999) or Foreign Minister (1996-1997). Mayaki said that if there had been any such contract during his tenure, he would have been aware of it. Mayaki said, however, that in June 1999, (REDACTED) businessman, approached him and insisted that Mayaki meet with an Iraqi delegation to discuss "expanding commercial relations" between Niger and Iraq. The intelligence report said that Mayaki interpreted 'expanding commercial relations' to mean that the delegation wanted to discuss uranium yellowcake sales. The intelligence report also said that "although the meeting took place, Mayaki let the matter drop due to the UN sanctions on Iraq".&lt;ref name="globalsecurity.org"/&gt;}}

Wilson has responded to criticism by observing that uranium was not actually discussed at the 1999 meeting.  On ''Meet the Press'', for example, Wilson stated:

{{quote|At that meeting, uranium was not discussed. It would be a tragedy to think that we went to war over a conversation in which uranium was not discussed because the Niger official was sufficiently sophisticated to think that perhaps he might have wanted to discuss uranium at some later date.&lt;ref&gt;

==CIA doubts==
In early October 2002, [[George Tenet]] called Deputy National Security Adviser [[Stephen Hadley]] to ask  him to remove reference to the Niger uranium from a speech Bush was to give in [[Cincinnati]] on 7 October. This was followed up by a memo asking Hadley to remove another, similar line. Another memo was sent to the White House expressing the CIA's view that the Niger claims were false; this memo was given to both Hadley and National Security Adviser [[Condoleezza Rice]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Wilson and Plame==
{{Main|Plame affair}}

Retired ambassador [[Joseph C. Wilson]] wrote a critical [[op-ed]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in which he explained the nature of the documents and the government's prior knowledge of their unreliability for use in a case for war.  Shortly after Wilson's op-ed, in a column by [[Robert Novak]], in pondering why a State Department employee was dispatched rather than a trained CIA agent, the identity of Wilson's wife, CIA analyst [[Valerie Plame]], was revealed.  The [[Senate Intelligence Committee]] report and other sources confirm that Plame "offered his name up" to her superiors.

The actual words President Bush spoke: "The British Government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa" suggests that his source was British intelligence and not the forged documents.&lt;ref&gt;

==IAEA analysis==
Further, in March 2003, the Director General of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) released results of his analysis of the documents. Reportedly, it took IAEA officials only a matter of hours to determine that these documents were fake. IAEA experts discovered indications of a crude forgery, such as the use of incorrect names of Nigerien officials. As a result, the IAEA reported to the U.N. Security Council that the documents were "in fact not authentic". The UN spokesman wrote:

{{quote|The I.A.E.A. was able to review correspondence coming from various bodies of the government of Niger and to compare the form, format, contents and signature of that correspondence with those of the alleged procurement-related documentation. Based on thorough analysis, the I.A.E.A. has concluded, with the concurrence of outside experts, that these documents, which formed the basis for the reports of recent uranium transaction between Iraq and Niger, are in fact not authentic. We have therefore concluded that these specific allegations are unfounded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/03/07/sprj.irq.un.transcript.elbaradei/ Transcript of IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei's presentation to the U.N.

In June and July, British [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]] testified that the claim in the dossier rested on separate evidence to the fraudulent documents, and that this specific intelligence, obtained from a foreign government, was still under review and had not been shared with the CIA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3061665.stm Iraq uranium claim sows confusion] BBC. 12 July 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In written evidence to the same committee, Straw further disclosed that the separate intelligence information upon which the British Government had based its conclusion, was also briefed to the IAEA by a foreign intelligence service that owned the reporting, shortly before IAEA Director General Dr. [[Mohamed ElBaradei]]'s statement to the UN Security Council on 7 March 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmselect/cmfaff/813/813we35.htm Iraqi Attempts To Procure Uranium] FAC.

IAEA spokesman Mark Gwozdecky responded to Jones in May 2004:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I can confirm to you that we have received information from a number of member states regarding the allegation that Iraq sought to acquire uranium from Niger. However, we have learned nothing which would cause us to change the conclusion we reported to the United Nations Security Council on March 7, 2003 with regards to the documents assessed to be forgeries and have not received any information that would appear to be based on anything other than those documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lynnejones.org.uk/uranium.htm The 'uranium from Africa' claim] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821102550/http://www.lynnejones.org.uk/uranium.htm |date=21 August 2008 }} Lynnejones.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After talking with numerous witnesses and considering much evidence, the committee judged the evidence that Iraq was trying to procure uranium was not sufficiently strong enough to justify absolute terms.

&lt;blockquote&gt;We conclude that it is very odd indeed that the Government asserts that it was not relying on the evidence which has since been shown to have been forged, but that eight months later it is still reviewing the other evidence. The assertion "… that Iraq sought the supply of significant amounts of uranium from Africa …" should have been qualified to reflect the uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;Ninth Report of Session 2002-03.

=== Butler Committee ===
&lt;div id="Butler Report"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The [[Butler Review|Butler Committee]], appointed by then Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], concluded that the report Saddam's government was seeking uranium in Africa appeared "well-founded":

{{quote|
a. It is accepted by all parties that Iraqi officials visited Niger in 1999.

b. The British government had intelligence from several different sources indicating that this visit was for the purpose of acquiring uranium. Since uranium constitutes almost three-quarters of Niger's exports, the intelligence was credible.

c. The evidence was not conclusive that Iraq actually purchased, as opposed to having sought, uranium, and the British government did not claim this.

d.

==More doubts==
In January 2006, ''[[The New York Times]]'' revealed the existence of a memo which stated that the suggestion of uranium being sold was "unlikely" because of a host of economic, diplomatic and logistical obstacles. The memo, dated 4 March 2002, was distributed at senior levels by the office of former [[Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell|Colin L. Powell]] and by the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Statements by Wilson==
In a July 2003 [[op-ed]], Ambassador Wilson recounted his experiences and stated "I have little choice but to conclude that some of the intelligence related to Iraq's nuclear weapons program was twisted to exaggerate the Iraqi threat".&lt;ref name="WilsonAfrica"/&gt;  Although the president had cited "The British Government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa", British intelligence have failed to show any other source of information.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

Wilson told ''[[The Washington Post]]'' anonymously in June 2003 that he had concluded that the intelligence about the Niger uranium was based on the forged documents because "the dates were wrong and the names were wrong." However, the relevant papers were not in CIA hands until eight months after Wilson made his trip. Wilson had to backtrack and said he may have "misspoken" on this.&lt;ref name="WilsonMisspoke"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate intelligence committee, which examined pre-Iraq war intelligence, reported that Wilson "had never seen the CIA reports and had no knowledge of what names and dates were in the reports."&lt;ref name="WilsonMisspoke" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SenateReport" /&gt;

==Origin of forged documents==
No one has been convicted of forging the documents.  Various theories have been reported on how they were produced, distributed, and where pressure was applied to keep their fraudulent nature a secret.

===Funneled through former Italian intelligence agent===
By late 2003, the trail of the documents had been partially uncovered. They were obtained by a "security consultant" (and former agent of the precursor agency to [[SISMI]], the SID), [[Rocco Martino]], from [[Italy|Italian]] military intelligence (SISMI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title = Don't Blame the Italians
|author = [[Justin Raimondo]],
|date = 15 November 2005  
|url = http://original.antiwar.com/justin/2005/11/14/dont-blame-the-italians/
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An article in ''[[The Times]]'' ([[London]]) quoted Martino as having received the documents from a woman on the staff of the Niger embassy (located in a tiny apartment in [[Rome]]), after a meeting was arranged by a serving SISMI agent.&lt;ref name="ItalianFakes"/&gt; Martino later recanted and said he had been misquoted, and that SISMI had not facilitated the meeting where he obtained the documents. It was later revealed that Martino had been invited to serve as the conduit for the documents by Col. Antonio Nucera of SISMI, the head of the counterintelligence and WMD proliferations sections of SISMI's Rome operations center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martino, in turn, offered them to Italian journalist [[Elisabetta Burba]]. On instructions from her editor at ''[[Panorama (Italian magazine)|Panorama]]'', Burba offered them to the [[Embassy of the United States, Rome|U.S. Embassy in Rome]] in October 2002.&lt;ref name="ItalianFakes"/&gt; Burba was dissuaded by the editors of the [[Silvio Berlusconi|Berlusconi]]-owned Panorama from investigating the source of the forgeries.

An August 2004 ''[[Financial Times]]'' article indicated French officials may have had a role in the forged documents coming to light. The article states:

{{quote|According to senior European officials, in 1999 [Rocco Martino] provided French officials with genuine documents which revealed Iraq may have been planning to expand 'trade' with Niger. This trade was assumed to be in uranium, which is Niger's main export. It was then that Mr Martino first became aware of the value of documents relating to Niger's uranium exports. He was then asked by French officials to provide more information, which led to a flourishing 'market' in documents. He subsequently provided France with more documents, which turned out to have been forged when they were handed to the International Atomic Energy Agency by U.S. diplomats.}}

The ''Times'' article also stated that "French officials have not said whether they know Mr Martino, and are unlikely to either confirm or deny that he is a source".&lt;ref name="FrenchProbe"&gt;{{Citation

===Current or former United States Executive Branch employees===
It is as yet unknown how Italian intelligence came by the documents and why they were not given directly to the U.S.  
According to a 2003 article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' by [[Seymour Hersh]], the forgery may have been a deliberate entrapment by current and former CIA officers to settle a score against Cheney and other [[neoconservative]]s.  Hersh recounts how a former officer told him that "somebody deliberately let something false get in there."  Hersh continues:

{{quote|He became more forthcoming in subsequent months, eventually saying that a small group of disgruntled retired C.I.A. clandestine operators had banded together in the late summer of last year and drafted the fraudulent documents themselves.

"The agency guys were so pissed at Cheney", the former officer said.  "They said, 'O.K, we're going to put the bite on these guys.'"   My source said that he was first told of the fabrication late last year, at one of the many holiday gatherings in the Washington area of past and present C.I.A. officials.  "Everyone was bragging about it&amp;mdash;'Here's what we did. It was cool, cool, cool.'"  These retirees, he said, had superb contacts among current officers in the agency and were informed in detail of the sismi intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;

In an interview published 7 April 2005, Cannistraro was asked by [[Ian Masters (journalist)|Ian Masters]] what he would say if it were asserted that the source of the forgery was former National Security Council and State Department consultant [[Michael Ledeen]]. (Ledeen had also allegedly been a liaison between the [[United States Intelligence Community]] and SISMI two decades earlier.)  Cannistraro answered by saying: "you'd be very close".&lt;ref name="WhoForged"&gt;
{{cite web
|title = Who Forged the Niger Documents?
|author = AlterNet
|date = 7 April 2005

In an interview on 26 July 2005, Cannistraro's business partner and columnist for the "American Conservative" magazine, former CIA counter terrorism officer [[Philip Giraldi]], confirmed to [[Scott Horton (radio host)|Scott Horton]] that the forgeries were produced by "a couple of former CIA officers who are familiar with that part of the world who are associated with a certain well-known [[neoconservative]] who has close connections with Italy." When Horton said that must be Ledeen, he confirmed it, and added that the ex-CIA officers, "also had some equity interests, shall we say, with the operation. A lot of these people are in consulting positions, and they get various, shall we say, emoluments in overseas accounts, and that kind of thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a second interview with Horton, Giraldi elaborated to say that Ledeen and his former CIA friends worked with [[Ahmad Chalabi]] and the [[Iraqi National Congress]]. "These people did it probably for a couple of reasons, but one of the reasons was that these people were involved, through the neoconservatives, with the Iraqi National Congress and Chalabi and had a financial interest in cranking up the pressure against Saddam Hussein and potentially going to war with him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Current and former Italian intelligence employees===
The suggestion of a plot by CIA officers is countered by an explosive series of articles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2005/j/sezioni/esteri/iraq69/sismicia/sismicia.html|title=Repubblica.it  »  esteri  »  Doppiogiochisti e dilettanti tutti gli italiani del Nigergate|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Italian newspaper ''[[La Repubblica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuralcubicle.blogspot.com/2005/10/berlusconi-behind-fake-yellowcake.html|title=Nur al-Cubicle: Berlusconi Behind Fake Yellowcake Dossier|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuralcubicle.blogspot.com/2005/10/yellowcake-dossier-not-work-of-cia.html|title=Nur al-Cubicle: Yellowcake Dossier Not the Work of the CIA|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuralcubicle.blogspot.com/2005/10/nigergate-great-nuclear-centrifuge.html|title=Nur al-Cubicle: Nigergate: The Great Nuclear Centrifuge Scam|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigative reporters Carlo Bonini and Giuseppe d'Avanzo report that [[Nicolò Pollari]], chief of Italy's military intelligence service, SISMI, brought the Niger yellowcake story directly to the [[White House]] after his insistent overtures had been rejected by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] in 2001 and 2002. SISMI had reported to the CIA on 15 October 2001, that Iraq had sought yellowcake in Niger, a report it also plied on British intelligence, creating an echo that the Niger forgeries themselves purported to amplify before they were exposed as a hoax.

Pollari met secretly in Washington on 9 September 2002, with then–Deputy [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Stephen Hadley]]. Their secret meeting came at a critical moment in the [[White House]] campaign to convince Congress and the American public that war in Iraq was necessary to prevent [[Saddam Hussein]] from developing nuclear weapons. What may be most significant to American observers, however, is ''La Repubblica'''s allegation that the Italians sent the bogus intelligence about Niger and Iraq not only through traditional allied channels such as the CIA, but seemingly directly into the White House. That direct White House channel amplifies questions about the 16-word reference to the uranium from Africa in President Bush's 2003 State of the Union address—which remained in the speech despite warnings from the CIA and the [[State Department]] that the allegation was not substantiated.&lt;ref name="Ariel2005"&gt;

==Aftermath==
In March 2003, [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Jay Rockefeller]], vice-chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, agreed not to open a Congressional investigation of the matter, but rather asked the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) to conduct the investigation.&lt;ref name="The New Yorker 2003"&gt;{{cite web | title=Who Lied to Whom? | website=The New Yorker | date=2003-03-24 | url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/03/31/who-lied-to-whom | access-date=2018-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, unidentified "senior officials" in the administration leaked word to columnist [[Robert Novak]] that Wilson's wife, [[Valerie Plame]], was a [[CIA]] operative. The CIA requested an investigation into whether this public disclosure was illegal, thus the Niger uranium controversy spawned an ongoing legal investigation and political scandal.

In September 2004, the [[CBS News]] program ''[[60 Minutes]]'' decided to delay a major story on the forgeries because such a broadcast might influence the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 U.S. presidential election]]. A [[CBS]] spokesman stated, "We now believe it would be inappropriate to air the report so close to the presidential election." This decision closely followed the [[Killian documents controversy]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicolò Pollari, director of the SISMI intelligence agency,&lt;ref name="Ariel2005" /&gt; told an Italian parliamentary intelligence committee that the dossier came from [[Rocco Martino]], a former Italian spy.

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported on 3 December 2005, that the FBI reopened the inquiry into "how the Bush administration came to rely on forged documents linking Iraq to nuclear weapons materials as part of its justification for the invasion." According to the Times, "a senior FBI official said the bureau's initial investigation found no evidence of foreign government involvement in the forgeries, but the FBI did not interview Martino, a central figure in a parallel drama unfolding in Rome."

===Removal of known yellowcake===
In 2008, the United States facilitated shipping [[yellowcake]] (refined uranium ore) out of Iraq. This yellowcake had been stockpiled prior to the first Gulf War, and was declared to the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] and under IAEA safeguards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25546334|title=Secret U.S. mission hauls uranium from Iraq|date=5 July 2008|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More than 550 tons of yellowcake was removed from Iraq and eventually shipped to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/war/yellowcake.asp|title=Yellowcake Uranium Removed from Iraq|first=David|last=Mikkelson|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ongkor Festival''' ([[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]: འོང་སྐོར་, [[Wylie transliteration|Wylie]]: 'ong skor, or ''Serkor'' (སེར་སྐོར་) in some dialects) is one of most important Tibetan festival of the [[Tibetan calendar|Tibetan lunar year]]. Ongkor is usually in the end of summer. Meaning of the festival is "good wish for harvest", literally "make circle around the field". During this festival, one person from each family in village participate on [[Kora (pilgrimage)|kora]] in the fields. People in procession dress [[Tibetan culture|traditional clothes]] and play different roles - warriors, riders, drummers and prayers or monks. In some region performs [[Lhamo|Tibetan opera]], drummer dance and horse racing. During this festival, people can see many different disciplines of traditional Tibetan singing, dancing, art of debate, dreesing and praying.

Recently this festival might be known as "Horse race festival", due to travel agencies who want to attrack tourists.

'''Parkwood Entertainment''' is an American management and entertainment company founded by American singer [[Beyoncé]] in 2010. The company began as a production unit for videos and films in 2008. It is located in [[New York City]] and its involvements include products for [[record producer|music production]], [[film|motion pictures]] and [[television special]]s related to Beyoncé. The company's first release was the film ''[[Cadillac Records]]'' (2008).

== History ==
Parkwood Entertainment was founded in 2010 by American singer, actress, producer, and director [[Beyoncé]]. As an imprint based from Columbia Records, the company began as a production unit for videos and films in 2008. Parkwood Entertainment is named after a street in [[Houston, Texas]] where Beyoncé once lived.&lt;ref name="Music World Ent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://musicworldent.com/artists/beyonce|title=Beyoncé|publisher=[[Music World Entertainment]]|accessdate=April 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; With headquarters in [[New York City]], the company serves as an umbrella for the entertainer's various brands in music, movies, videos, and fashion. The staff of Parkwood Entertainment have experiences in arts and entertainment, from filmmaking and video production to web and fashion design. In addition to departments in marketing, digital, creative, publicity, fashion design and merchandising, the company houses a state-of-the-art editing suite, where Beyoncé works on content for her worldwide tours, music videos, and television specials. Parkwood Entertainment's first production was the musical biopic ''[[Cadillac Records]]'' (2008), in which Beyoncé starred and co-produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/cadillac-records-v429778|title=Cadillac Records (2008)|publisher=[[AllMovie]]. [[AllRovi]]. [[Rovi Corporation]]|first=Jason|last=Buchanan|accessdate=April 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, she starred in and executive produced the thriller ''[[Obsessed (2009 film)|Obsessed]]''. During a private screening held at New York's School of Visual Arts Theatre following the release of her [[Beyoncé (album)|fifth self-titled studio album]], Beyoncé briefly discussed her decision to found Parkwood Entertainment in front of her fans and the press, saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I started my own company when I decided to manage myself. It was important that I didn't go to some big management company, I felt like I wanted to follow the footsteps of [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and be a powerhouse and have my own empire, and show other women when you get to this point in your career you don't have to go sign with someone else and share your money and your success—you do it yourself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/legal-and-management/5847820/beyonce-on-self-management-following-madonnas|title=Beyonce on Self-Management, Following Madonna's Footsteps, Developing Other Artists|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|first=Andy|last=Gensler|date=December 22, 2013|accessdate=September 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In December 2013, Parkwood Entertainment released Beyoncé's fifth self-titled visual album. The surprising release caused "hilarious, honest and hysterical" reaction among Beyoncé's fans,&lt;ref name="RS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/beyonce-made-the-internet-explode-today-20131213|title='Beyonce' Made the Internet Explode Today|work=Rolling Stone|first=Hazel|last=Cills|date=December 13, 2013|accessdate=December 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "shock" among other musicians.&lt;ref name="Billboard tweets"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5839698/beyonces-surprise-album-20-tweets-from-mind-blown-musicians|title=Beyonce's Surprise Album: 20 Tweets From Mind-Blown Musicians |first=Jason |last=Lipshutz|work=Billboard|date=December 13, 2013|accessdate=December 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to data provided by Twitter, the release generated over 1.2&amp;nbsp;million tweets in 12 hours.&lt;ref name="Billboard tweets"/&gt; Peter Robinson of ''The Guardian'' hailed the shock release as "Beyoncégeddon", describing it as a "major triumph [...] a masterclass in both exerting and relinquishing control."&lt;ref name="Peter Robinson Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/01/beyonce-redefined-release-album-adele |title=Beyoncé has reinvented how to release an album.

It debuted at number one on the US ''Billboard'' 200, earning Beyoncé her fifth consecutive number-one album in the country. The record sold 617,000 copies in the US, and 828,773 copies worldwide in its first three days of availability, becoming the fastest-selling album in the history of the iTunes Store at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Clarisse|last=Loughrey|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/adeles-album-is-no1-in-almost-every-country-in-the-world-a6749626.html|title=Adele's new album 25 is No.1 on iTunes in almost every country in the world|date=November 26, 2015|work=Independent|accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reissued in November 2014 as part of a platinum edition, along with an extended play of new songs. It received acclaim from critics, who praised its production, exploration of sexuality, and Beyoncé's vocals.

In October 2014, Beyoncé with Parkwood Entertainment formed a large collaboration with [[Topshop]], creating the subsidiary Parkwood Topshop Athletic Ltd, to produce an athletic, streetwear brand. The company and collaboration is a 50/50 split, with both parent companies owning half of this new division. Beyoncé commented on the collaboration stating "I could not think of a better partner as I continue to grow the Parkwood business".&lt;ref name="Topshop"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2014/10/27/beyonce-knowles-collaboration-topshop-athletic|title=CONFIRMED: Beyoncé And Topshop Launch Activewear|work=[[Vogue (British magazine)|Vogue]]|first=Lauren|last=Milligan|date=October 27, 2014|accessdate=October 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2018, Parkwood Entertainment confirmed that the company had acquired total ownership of the Ivy Park brand from co-founder Sir Phillip Green following allegations of sexual harassment and racial abuse.

In 2015, Parkwood expanded into managing the careers of upcoming artists and signed [[Chloe x Halle]], [[Sophie Beem]] and Ingrid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.musictimes.com/articles/37423/20150502/beyonce-parkwood-entertainment-offers-3-teen-girls-management-contracts.htm|title=Beyonce's Parkwood Entertainment Offers 3 Teen Girls Management Contracts|last=Times|first=Music|date=2015-05-02|newspaper=Music Times|access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music/beyonce-management-company-offers-3-teens-contracts-article-1.2207487|title=Beyoncé's management company offers 3 teens contracts|newspaper=NY Daily News|access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2015/12/18/ingrid-beyonce-sign-parkwood-entertainment|title=Meet Ingrid, The Rapper Signed to Beyoncé's Label|website=The FADER|access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Steve Pamon, from [[JPMorgan Chase|JP Morgan Chase]] took office as the [[Chief operating officer|COO]] and President of the company.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6866919/beyonce-parkwood-entertainment-executive-moves|title=Beyonce's Management Company Parkwood Is Undergoing an Executive Overhaul|newspaper=Billboard|access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within that same year, Parkwood entertainment released [[Beyoncé]]'s critically acclaimed sixth studio album ''[[Lemonade (Beyoncé album)|Lemonade]]''. The album was accompanied by the release of a 60-minute film of the same name, which premiered on HBO on April 23, 2016. &lt;ref name="pfk42416"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/63381-beyonce-releases-new-album-lemonade-featuring-kendrick-lamar-jack-white-the-weeknd-james-blake/|title=Beyoncé Releases New Album Lemonade Featuring Kendrick Lamar, Jack White, the Weeknd, James Blake|date=April 23, 2016|accessdate=April 23, 2016|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lemonade received widespread acclaim from critics and is also Beyoncé's most critically acclaimed album to date.

The audacity of its reach and fierceness of its vision challenges our cultural imagination, while crafting a stunning and sublime masterpiece about the lives of women of color and the bonds of friendship seldom seen or heard in American popular culture."&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, Margaret,

'''Giuseppina Pasqualino di Marineo''' (9 December 1974 – 31 March 2008), known as '''Pippa Bacca''', was an Italian feminist artist who, together with a fellow artist, was [[hitchhiking]] internationally to promote world peace under the motto, "marriage between different peoples and nations",&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/19/theater/19peac.html|title=Performance Artist Killed on Peace Trip is Mourned|author=Elisabetta, Povoledo|date=19 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; symbolically wearing a [[wedding dress]] during her trek.&lt;ref name="murder"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7344381.stm |title= 'World peace' hitcher is murdered| publisher= [[BBC News]] |accessdate= 12 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 March 2008, she disappeared in [[Gebze]] in Turkey. Her raped body was discovered in the same city on 11 April 2008. The police arrested a man who later led them to her body.&lt;ref name="murder" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ahn"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7010618837 | title= Missing Italian 'World Peace' Hitcher And Artist Found Dead In Turkey | publisher= All Headline News | accessdate= 12 April 2008 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080506115507/http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7010618837 | archivedate= 6 May 2008 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="break" /&gt;

=="Brides on Tour"==
Bacca was part of a world peace effort known as "Brides on Tour," for which she and fellow artist Silvia Moro had departed from [[Milan]], Italy on 8 March 2008.&lt;ref name=itin&gt;{{cite web |url= http://bridesontour.fotoup.net/programma.html |website= Brides on Tour |title= Itinerary |publisher= Fotoup.net |accessdate= 12 April 2008 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080314151014/http://bridesontour.fotoup.net/programma.html |archivedate= 14 March 2008 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The artists, wearing white wedding dresses, then travelled through the Balkans and arrived in Turkey on 20 March 2008. They had planned to hitchhike through the Middle East, their final destination being [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name=break/&gt;&lt;ref name=itin/&gt; Concerning their attire, they reported on their website that "That's the only dress we'll carry along — with all stains accumulated during the journey."&lt;ref name=ahn/&gt;&lt;ref name=bot&gt;{{cite web| url= http://bridesontour.fotoup.net/ |website= Brides on Tour |title= Brides on Tour |publisher= Fotoup.net | accessdate= 12 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On her sister's hitchhiking plans, and in light of the discovery of her body, her sibling Maria stated to Italian news agency ANSA that "Her travels were for an artistic performance and to give a message of peace and of trust, but not everyone deserves trust... We weren't particularly worried because she had been hitchhiking for a lot of time, and thus was capable of avoiding risky situations... She was a determined person when it had to do with working for art."&lt;ref name=break/&gt;

==Disappearance==
Bacca and her companion split up just prior to arriving in [[Istanbul]], planning to meet up again in [[Beirut]]. However, Bacca disappeared after 31 March.&lt;ref name=ahn/&gt; Her credit card was reportedly used at noon of that day.&lt;ref name=break&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.breakingnews.ie/world/?jp=mhojqlmhidsn&amp;rss=rss2 |title= 'Brides for peace' protester found dead in Turkey | website= BreakingNews |accessdate= 12 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacca's naked, strangled and decomposing body was found near some bushes near [[Gebze]], about 40 miles southeast of Istanbul.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="murder" /&gt;

The man who led the police to her body, Murat Karataş,&lt;ref name=ahn/&gt; was detained&lt;ref name=murder/&gt; and arrested after reportedly confessing to raping and strangling Bacca on 31 March after taking her in his Jeep from a gas station.&lt;ref name=ahn/&gt; DNA testing suggests, however, that Bacca was [[gang rape|raped by multiple people]], and not just Karataş.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/english/domestic/11033294.asp|title='Bacca faced multiple rape'|location=Istanbul|newspaper=[[Hürriyet Daily News]]|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suspect said he was under the influence of drugs and alcohol and could not remember what happened.&lt;ref name="Guler"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pippa Bacca murderer says he does not remember killing|first=Mehmet|last=Guler|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/national_pippa-bacca-murderer-says-he-does-not-remember-killing_157862.html|date=5 November 2008|publisher=Today's Zaman|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225150653/http://www.todayszaman.com/national_pippa-bacca-murderer-says-he-does-not-remember-killing_157862.html|archivedate=25 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been traced after he inserted his own [[SIM card]] into the victim's mobile phone—which alerted police, since he had a previous conviction for theft.&lt;ref name="murder" /&gt; Bacca's own information was wiped from the mobile device, implicating, according to the lawyer for Bacca's family, at least one other accomplice since Karataş could not speak English and left school after the third grade.&lt;ref name="Guler" /&gt;

==Reactions==
The Turkish president [[Abdullah Gül]] called the Italian president [[Giorgio Napolitano]] to express his grief.&lt;ref name="Povoledo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2008/04/19/theater/19peac.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=Performance Artist Killed on Peace Trip is Mourned| first= Elisabetta| last=Povoledo|date=19 April 2008|work = [[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A commentary in ''[[Today's Zaman]]'', while expressing sadness for the woman's death, criticised the supposed obsequiousness of Turkish politicians to "foreigners" in the Bacca case, writing: "Let's face it, if Pippa were a Turk, some people would feel free to say that a hitchhiking woman deserves to be raped." The columnist argued that local problems such as [[violence against women]] should be addressed regardless of Turkey's concern for being shamed before foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/columnist-139511-being-disgraced-in-the-eyes-of-whom.html|title=Being disgraced in the eyes of whom?|first=Ayse|last=Karabat|publisher=Today's Zaman |date=20 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Hürriyet]]'', a top selling Turkish newspaper, printed an article on the murder entitled "We are ashamed".&lt;ref name="hurri"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/english/turkey/8682937.asp?gid=231&amp;sz=83045 |title= Missing Italian woman artist Pippa Bacca found dead in Turkey| website= [[Hürriyet]]  |accessdate= 12 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
A documentary, ''La Mariée'' (''The Bride''), about the story of Bacca, was directed by the French filmmaker Joël Curtz in 2012.&lt;ref name=curtz&gt;{{cite web| url= http://joelcurtz.com/en/travaux/detail/136 |title=''The Bride (La Mariée)'' | website= JoëlCurtz.com | publisher= Joël Curtz}}&lt;/ref&gt; This documentary features video archives from her  camera that the film team recovered during the shooting of the film.&lt;ref name=IDFA&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.idfa.nl/industry/tags/project.aspx?id=df84a038-1401-486c-9ece-c6329a54c9bd | title= The Bride | publisher= International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131029193514/http://www.idfa.nl/industry/tags/project.aspx?id=df84a038-1401-486c-9ece-c6329a54c9bd | archivedate= 29 October 2013 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8020">'''Return fraud''' is the act of  [[fraud|defrauding]] a [[retail]] store via the [[returning|return process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Shoplifting Laws and Punishments|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal-law/shoplifting-laws-and-punishments|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=12 September 2017|date=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various ways in which this crime is committed. For example, the offender may return stolen merchandise to secure cash, or steal receipts or receipt tape to enable a falsified return, or to use somebody else's receipt to try to return an item picked up from a store shelf. Return abuse is a form of "[[friendly fraud]]" where someone purchases products without intending to keep them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Retail Refund Fraud and Abuse|url=http://losspreventionmedia.com/insider/retail-fraud/retail-refund-fraud-and-abuse/|website=LPM Insider|accessdate=12 September 2003|date=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most well-known form of this abuse is "wardrobing" or "free renting" – in which the person makes a purchase, uses the product(s), and then returns the merchandise.&lt;ref name="wardrobing"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roberts|first1=Deborah|last2=Orso|first2=Alberto|title=Buy, Wear, Return, Repeat|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Story?id=6381593&amp;page=1|accessdate=12 September 2017|agency=ABC News|date=3 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosenbaum|first1=Mark S.|last2=Kuntze|first2=Ronald|title=Looking good at the retailer's expense: investigating unethical retail disposition behavior among compulsive buyers|journal=Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services|date=May 2005|volume=12|issue=3|page=217|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698904000505|doi=10.1016/j.jretconser.2004.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Benidorm19.jpg|thumb|200px|There are various types of "return fraud", which impose large costs on retailers.]]

The retail industry experiences a significant fraud and abuse problem, losing money in the range of $50 billion per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reilly|first1=Katie|title=Shoplifting and Other Fraud Cost Retailers Nearly $50 Billion Last Year|url=http://time.com/money/4829684/shoplifting-fraud-retail-survey/|accessdate=12 September 2017|agency=Time|date=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 report published by the NRF states total merchandise returns accounted for over $260.5 billion in lost sales for US retailers in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nrf.com/sites/default/files/Images/Media%20Center/NRF%20Retail%20Return%20Fraud%20Final_0.pdf|title=2015 Consumer Returns in the Retail Industry|last=|first=|date=2015|website=nrf.com|publisher=The Retail Equation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem of retail fraud has caused retailers to raise prices for shoppers in order to offset and recover the losses incurred from fraudulent returns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kavilanz|first1=Parija B.|title=Store theft cost to your family: $435|url=http://money.cnn.com/2009/11/10/news/economy/retail_recession_theft/|accessdate=12 September 2017|publisher=CNN Money|date=11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, many stores have created stricter return policies such as "no receipt, no return" or imposed return time restrictions such as a 30-day limit on all returns that impact all shoppers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kokemuller|first1=Neil|title=Merchandise Return Policies|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/merchandise-return-policies-69637.html|accessdate=12 September 2017|publisher=Houston Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A certain percentage of returned merchandise must be marked down or discarded in order to sell the product. After being returned, out-of-season clothing may have to be placed on the sale rack, for example. Or retailers may be forced to discard items such as returned lingerie due to sanitary or health reasons.&lt;ref name="returnpolicy"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rittman|first1=Tom|title=7 Surprising Ways Retailers Lose Money|url=https://risnews.com/7-surprising-ways-retailers-lose-money|accessdate=12 September 2017|publisher=Retail Info Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Some examples of the return fraud and abuse problems include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rittman|first1=Tom|title=Nine Tactics Consumers Use to Make Fraudulent Returns|url=http://www.chainstoreage.com/article/nine-tactics-consumers-use-make-fraudulent-returns|publisher=Chain Store Age|accessdate=12 September 2017|date=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Wardrobing or renting''': Purchasing merchandise for short-term use with the intent to return the item, such as a dress for a special occasion, a video camera for graduations and weddings or a big-screen television for the [[Super Bowl]].&lt;ref name="wardrobing"/&gt;
* '''Returning stolen merchandise''': Shoplifting with the objective to return the item(s) for full price, plus any sales tax.
* '''Receipt fraud''': Utilizing reused, stolen or falsified receipts to return merchandise for profit. Alternatively, returning goods purchased on sale or from a different store at a lower price with the intention of profiting from the difference.
* '''[[Electronic receipt|e-receipt]] fraud''': Utilizing e-receipts issued when purchasing goods online, but returning them in store, to return merchandise for profit. A variation of the receipt fraud using the e-receipts.
* '''Employee fraud''': Assistance from employees to return stolen goods for full retail price.
* '''Price switching''': Placing higher priced labels on merchandise with the intention of returning the item(s) at a higher price than purchase.
* '''Price arbitrage''': Purchasing differently priced, but similar-looking merchandise and returning the cheaper item as the expensive one.
* '''Switch fraud''': Purchasing a working item, and returning a damaged or defective identical item that was already owned.
* '''[[Brick (electronics)|Bricking]]''': Purchasing a working electronic item, and deliberately damaging or stripping it of valuable components to render it unusable, then returning the item for profit.
* '''Cross-retailer return''': Returning or exchanging an item purchased at another retailer (usually at a lower price) for cash, store credit or a similar, higher-priced item at another retailer.

Return policies have historically served as the primary way for retailers to combat return fraud and abuse; the challenge is keeping policies from being overly restrictive and/or inconsistently interpreted, both of which may discourage loyal customers and affect purchases.&lt;ref name="returnpolicy"/&gt; Separately, automated solutions have also been developed to help combat return fraud and abuse, including software programs that detect such behavior and help retailers determine whether a return is valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cardone|first1=Caroline|last2=Hayes|first2=Read|title=The Evolving Impact of Return Fraud and Abuse|url=http://losspreventionmedia.com/insider/retail-fraud/the-evolving-impact-of-return-fraud-and-abuse/|accessdate=12 September 2017|publisher=LPM Insider|date=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These software programs allow retailers to maintain reasonable price points for consumers, maintain lenient return policies for their good customers, and offer better and more consistent customer service. Reducing fraudulent and abusive returns helps a retailer's financial situation by lowering costs, preserving net sales, reducing shrink, while still delivering better service to their shoppers.

'''Roboexotica''' (sometimes spelled: ''Roböxotica'') is an annual festival and conference where scientists, researchers, computer experts and artists from all over the world build ''cocktail robots'' and discuss technological [[innovation]], [[futurology]] and [[science fiction]].
Roboexotica is also an ironic attempt to criticize techno-triumphalism and to dissect technological hypes.

The festival is co-produced by Shifz and [[monochrom]], two [[Vienna]]-based art collectives, and supported by the 'Bureau for Philosophy' (of the Department of Philosophy, [[University of Vienna]]). The festival is usually held in the end of November or early December.

==Overview==
The annual international festival consists of an exhibition, a conference, social events, and the ACRA (Annual Cocktail Robot Award).

The exhibition presents [[robot]]s that can mix cocktails, serve cocktails, consume cocktails, have bar conversations, light or smoke [[cigarette]]s or manage to impress the jury with (Quote Roboexotica website) "other achievements in the sector of cocktail culture".

[[File:Cocktail robot at Roboexotica 2007 in Vienna, Austria.jpg|thumb|Cocktail robot at Roboexotica 2007 in Vienna, Austria]]
==History==
In 1999, Magnus Wurzer and Chris Veigl (of Shifz) started to present a self-made cocktail robot at the small independent Viennese culture and art space VEKKS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://vekks.yi.org|title=V.E.K.K.S|publisher=Vekks.yi.org|date=|accessdate=2012-03-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305120705/http://vekks.yi.org/|archivedate=2012-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group [[monochrom]] ([[Johannes Grenzfurthner]], Günther Friesinger, Franz Ablinger) first participated with performances and presenting machines, but in 2002 monochrom teamed up with Shifz as organizers and the small event became a big international festival presented at Vienna's [[Museumsquartier]] and several other locations in the Vienna metro area. Roboexotica presents around 20 machines every year and draws around 3000 guests per event. 

Roboexotica was presented at [[Kiberpipa|Cyberpipe]] ([[Ljubljana]]) in 2006, at [[Maker Faire]] ([[San Francisco]]) and [[RoboGames]] ([[San Francisco]]) in 2007.

In 2008 a catalogue titled Roboexotica was published, celebrating the 10th anniversary of the festival. The book features reflections on the festival and presents statements by former participants including [[Cory Doctorow]], [[Dorkbot]]'s Doueglas Repetto, [[Bre Pettis]], [[V. Vale]], Karen Marcelo of [[Survival Research Laboratories]] or [[RoboGames]]' David Calkins and Simone Davalos.

A smaller show called "Roboexotica USA" was held in San Francisco in 2008 and 2009. It was organized by [[monochrom]] and ''Shifz'' and was well received by the press. In 2010 it was decided to rename the San Francisco-based cocktail robot event  "Barbot," and Barbot events were held in San Franicsco in 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013.

[[Chase Masterson]] was special guest star at the 20th anniversary edition of cocktail robot festival [[Roboexotica]] in [[Vienna]] and performed a live jazz set for "robots and humans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cocktail |url=https://www.vienna.at/roboexotica-20-festival-fuer-cocktailrobotik-in-wien/6002869 |website=vienna.at |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sagan |first1=Sonja |title=OTS0037, 20.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The church describes this holiday thus: ''"Each year the annual Maiden Voyage event, commemorating the anniversary of New OT VIII, has come to be one of the most important gatherings of dedicated Scientologists and an opportunity for senior Church officials to meet and work directly with these parishioners to advance their religion. Scientologists who attend this annual spiritual cruise become “OT Ambassadors” and initiate programs to help Scientologists all over the world advance the aims of Scientology and to reach the top of the Bridge at New OT VIII.''"&lt;ref name="While We're At It"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whatisscientology.org/html/Part06/Chp21/pg0396-b.html "Churches, Missions and Groups"], ''What is Scientology?''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* '''June 18''': Academy Day
&lt;blockquote&gt;A celebration of Hubbard's [[Study Tech]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* '''August 12''': [[Sea Org]] Day
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sea Org Day is a special event for all Sea Organization members, with rank and rating promotion ceremonies.

It has been alleged by former members that recreational Sea Org Day events are mandatory: one ex-Scientologist claims "the one day a year you are supposed to get the day off, you are made to go on a bus to the beach, be there for roll call, participate in group games, etc." &lt;/blockquote&gt;
*'''September 4''': [[Clear (Scientology)|Clear]] Day
&lt;blockquote&gt;Clear Day marks the inauguration of Hubbard's Clearing Course, which debuted in 1965.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*'''2nd Sunday in September''': Auditor's Day
&lt;blockquote&gt;A day of special recognition and acknowledgment for Scientology/Dianetics auditors. This occasion has also been popular with anti-Scientology protestors, as an opportunity to reach students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first1=J. |title=Handbook of Scientology |volume=Brill Handbooks on Contemporary Religion |editor-last=Lewis |editor-first=James R. |editor2-last=Hellesoy |editor2-first=Kjersti |publisher=Brill |year=2017 |isbn=9789004330542 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
*'''October 7''': [[International Association of Scientologists|IAS]] Anniversary
&lt;blockquote&gt;From the Church's site: ''"Held at a different host city each year, members of the IAS gather to commemorate the founding of the IAS and to rededicate themselves to its aims. The annual IAS freedom awards are presented. This event coincides with the annual convention of IAS delegates."''&lt;ref name="While We're At It"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*'''November 27''': Publications Day
&lt;blockquote&gt;A commemoration of the day "Publications Worldwide" opened at Saint Hill Manor in 1967.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*'''December 7''': [[Flag Land Base]] Day
&lt;blockquote&gt;Celebrates the opening of the Flag Land Base in [[Clearwater, Florida]] in 1975. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
*'''December 31''': New Year's Eve
&lt;blockquote&gt;This is the only secular and non-Hubbard-based observance on the official Scientology calendar, which states ''"This event welcomes in the new year with a review of accomplishments over the previous year and a look forward to the upcoming year and plans for further reach into new areas of society with L. Ron Hubbard’s technology. Stellar accomplishments of Scientology parishioners helping new people to move up [[The Bridge to Total Freedom]] are acknowledged."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Additionally, many more anniversaries of notable events in Scientology history are remembered. Examples include '''January 25 '''([[Criminon]] day), marking the 1970 founding of the Criminon program, '''January 28 ''' which celebrates the founding of the Church in [[New Zealand]], '''February 19 '''([[Narconon]] Day), marking the 1966 founding of Narconon,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.narconon-news.org/news_archives/february_19_2005.htm "February 19 is Narconon Day!"], ''Narconon International News''&lt;/ref&gt; '''March 31''', the anniversary of the founding of the Church of Scientology [[Vienna]] in 1971, and '''September 25''', which marks the 1980 opening of the first Scientology and Dianetics College in [[Tel Aviv, Israel]], where the concept is presented as a College, not a church.

'''Super Bowl LIV''', the 54th [[Super Bowl]] and the 50th [[AFL–NFL merger|modern-era]] [[National Football League]] (NFL) championship game, will decide the league champion for the league's [[centennial]] 2019 season. The game is scheduled to be played on February 2, 2020 in [[Miami Gardens, Florida]] (with the exact date pending potential changes to the NFL calendar). This will be the 11th Super Bowl hosted by the South Florida region and the sixth Super Bowl hosted in Miami Gardens, with the last one being [[Super Bowl XLIV]] ten years earlier. The game will be televised nationally by [[NFL on FOX|Fox]].

==Host-selection process==
On May 19, 2015, the league announced the four finalists that will compete to host either [[Super Bowl LIII]] in 2019 or Super Bowl LIV. NFL owners voted on these cities in May 2016, with the first round of voting determining who will host Super Bowl LIII, and the second round deciding the site for Super Bowl LIV. The league had also originally announced in 2015 that Los Angeles would be eligible as a potential Super Bowl LIV site if there is a stadium in place, and a team moved there by the start of the 2018 season.&lt;ref name="ESPN20150519"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000493442/article/nfl-selects-finalists-for-2019-2020-super-bowls | title=NFL selects finalists for 2019, 2020 Super Bowls | publisher=NFL.com | date=May 19, 2015 | accessdate=February 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-la-superbowl-20150520-story.html | title=L.A. could get 2020 Super Bowl if team, stadium are in place by 2018 | first=Sam | last=Farmer | work=Los Angeles Times | date=May 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league opened the relocation window in January 2016, selecting the former [[St. Louis Rams]] to return to Los Angeles; their [[Los Angeles Stadium at Hollywood Park|new stadium in Inglewood, California]] was, at the time of the vote, not scheduled to open until August 2019 (it began construction in December 2016, giving nearly three years to construct the stadium). This meant that the new stadium was scheduled to be open in time for the game (and the league selected the relocating team just in time to be considered for Super Bowl LIV), but, under the current construction timetable, would require a waiver of league policy to host Super Bowl LIV, as the league does not allow stadiums in their first year of existence to host the Super Bowl to ensure that stadium construction delays and unforeseen problems do not jeopardize the game. In May 2016, the league granted this waiver and confirmed that Los Angeles was still in consideration for Super Bowl LIV.&lt;ref name=laconfirmed&gt;Battista, Judy (May 23, 2016). [http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000664354/article/future-super-bowl-sites-las-vegas-among-topics-at-nfl-meeting Future Super Bowl sites, Las Vegas among topics at NFL meeting]. ''NFL.com''. Retrieved May 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Los Angeles has hosted the Super Bowl seven times, most recently in 1993 with [[Super Bowl XXVII]]; that game, along with the four prior Super Bowls in the area, were held at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] while first two Super Bowls in Los Angeles area were held at [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]]. On May 24, 2016, Atlanta was chosen to host [[Super Bowl LIII]], thereby making it ineligible to host Super Bowl LIV.  Meanwhile, Los Angeles removed itself from the running for Super Bowl LIV; it was awarded rights to [[Super Bowl LV]] shortly thereafter.  However, a year later, on May 23, 2017, NFL owners opted to instead award [[Super Bowl LV]] to Tampa and give [[Super Bowl LVI]] to Los Angeles after it was announced that [[Los Angeles Stadium at Hollywood Park]] would open in 2020 due to construction delays.

The two remaining finalists for Super Bowl LIV were as follows:&lt;ref name="CBS20150519"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25190240/finalists-for-2019-2020-super-bowls-atlanta-miami-new-orleans-tampa|title=Finalists for 2019, 2020 Super Bowls: Atlanta, Miami, New Orleans, Tampa|publisher=CBS Sports|first=Sean|last=Wagner-McGough|date=May 19, 2015 | accessdate=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ESPN20150519"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/12916777/atlanta-miami-new-orleans-tampa-bidding-2019-2020-super-bowls|title=Atlanta, Miami, New Orleans, Tampa eye 2019, 2020 Super Bowls|publisher=ESPN|first=Mike|last=Triplett|date=May 19, 2015|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Raymond James Stadium]], [[Tampa, Florida]]: Tampa has hosted four Super Bowls, with the last being [[Super Bowl XLIII]] in 2009.

Miami was selected as the host site at the NFL owners meeting on May 24, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosenthal|first1=Gregg|title=Atlanta, South Florida, L.A. chosen to host Super Bowls|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000664704/article/atlanta-south-florida-la-chosen-to-host-super-bowls|website=NFL.com|accessdate=May 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/live-updates-nfl-announcing-sites-for-super-bowls-53-54-55|title=NFL awards future Super Bowls to Atlanta, South Florida and Los Angeles|publisher=CBS Sports|accessdate=May 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the first time the state of Florida will host back to back Super Bowls since Super Bowl XLIII in 2009 in Tampa and Super Bowl XLIV in 2010 in Miami Gardens.

The '''Tanana Valley State Fair''' is an annual [[state fair]] held in [[College, Alaska|College]], [[Alaska]], [[United States]]. The event commences on the first Friday in August, and is a major annual event in [[Interior Alaska]].  The fair is held on a hundred-acre plot of land just outside the city limits of [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]], in the approximate center of College Road. The fairgrounds, along with portions of the [[Creamer's Field Migratory Waterfowl Refuge]] and surrounding businesses on the north side of College Road, comprise the eastern reaches of the College [[census-designated place]] adjacent to Fairbanks.

It features amusement rides, food concessions, competitive exhibits, contests and live performances.  As of the 81st Annual Fair in 2012, an adult day pass cost $10 and season pass cost $35. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsminer.com/view/full_story/18463823/article-It-s-all-pun-and-games-at-Tanana-Valley-State-Fair?

==History==
The Tanana Valley Fair was founded in 1924, making it the oldest state fair in [[Alaska]].  Experimental agronomist George William Gasser &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.litsite.org/index.cfm?section=Digital-Archives&amp;page=Industry&amp;cat=Agriculture&amp;viewpost=2&amp;ContentId=2710 "George W. Gasser"] ''[[LitSite Alaska]]'' Retrieved on 24 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and local real estate businessman and homesteading farmer Harry Markley Badger were instrumental in forming the not-for-profit [[Tanana Valley]] Fair Association.  From 1924 to 1951, the fair was held in various locations in downtown Fairbanks.  All fairs since 1952 have been held at the current location, on land which the association originally leased from the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks|University of Alaska]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tananavalleystatefair.com/about-us/fair-history/ Tanana Valley State Fair History] Retrieved on 24 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, the Matanuska Valley Fair formed in [[Palmer, Alaska|Palmer]]. It saw a name change in 1959 to the "[[Alaska State Fair]]" when [[Alaska]] was upgraded from a territory to a state in the [[United States of America]]. That same year, both fairs requested to be the "Official Alaska State Fair." Subsequently, [[William Allen Egan|the governor of Alaska]] determined the fairs would alternate the title with the Tanana Valley State Fair in Fairbanks using the title in even-numbered years and the Alaska State Fair in Palmer using the title in odd-numbered years. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alaskastatefair.org/site/about-us/history#.UA7Nq6BIkrU Alaska State Fair History] Retrieved on 24 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://newsminer.com/bookmark/19556573-Looking-back-in-Fairbanks-%E2%80%94-July-24 "Looking back in Fairbanks — July 24"] ''Fairbanks Daily News-Miner'' Retrieved on 25 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; "Tanana Valley State Fair" was adopted as the permanent name of the fair in Fairbanks in 1985.  The Alaska State Fair in Palmer is held annually for about two weeks around the beginning of August.

The Southeast Alaska Fair is held in [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]] for four days over the last weekend in July. There are also fairs in [[Ninilchik]] and [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak]] in late August and early September, with smaller fairs held in [[Delta Junction]], [[Kenny Lake]] and [[Salcha]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alaska.com/events/fairs/ Alaska's State Fairs] Retrieved on 25 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Farmer's Market==
The associated Tanana Valley Farmer’s Market was founded in 1978 as a means for fair exhibitors to sell their produce and goods. It is currently open from May to September three days a week. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvfmarket.com/ Tanana Valley Farmer’s Market] Retrieved on 25 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  The market was formerly located on the fairgrounds property, very near to the intersection of College Road and Aurora Drive and the main entrance to the fairgrounds.  The market, including the building housing it, was moved to a site approximately a half-mile (800 m) to the west in 2005.

'''Tannkosh''' was a large [[airshow]] and [[fly-in]] held annually in July at [[Tannheim]], upper [[Swabia]] in [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="Tannkosh"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.tannkosh.de/|title = Tannkosh 2009 (German Language)|accessdate = 2009-11-16|last = Tannosh|authorlink = |year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event was the closest European equivalent to [[EAA AirVenture Oshkosh]] and, although smaller than the Oshkosh airshow, Tannkosh attracted hundreds of private [[aircraft]] from all over Europe.&lt;ref name="Tannkosh" /&gt;

Tannkosh derived its name from that of the more widely known airshow upon which it was modeled, Oshkosh, and Tannheim Flugplatz, the aerodrome near [[Tannheim]], Germany, where the event was held.&lt;ref name="Tannheim"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.flugplatz-tannheim.de/|title = Flugplatz und Flugschule Tannheim (German Language)|accessdate = 2008-12-25|last = Tannheimer Flieger- und Freizeitzentrum GmbH|authorlink = |year = n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 Tannkosh airshow took place from August 23 to 25, 2013.&lt;ref name="Tannkosh2013"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.tannkosh.com/824.0.html|title = TANNKOSH macht ein Jahr Kreativpause (German Language)|accessdate = 2011-12-13|last =|authorlink = |year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, it was announced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tannkosh.de/1111.0.html|title = An era comes to an end|website=Tannkosh|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that there would be no Tannkosh 2015, nor any more to follow.

'''''The Life and Times of Conrad Black''''' is a [[wordless novel]] by Canadian artist [[George Walker (printmaker)|George Walker]], published in 2013.

[[File:Conrad Black mug shot.jpg|thumb|alt=|[[Conrad Black]]'s mug shot in 2005]]

Walker's followed up his first wordless novel, ''The Mysterious Death of Tom Thomson'' (2012) about the death of [[Tom Thomson|the well-known Canadian painter]], with a biography of the media mogul [[Conrad Black]].  Walker stated his motivation was that Black was "one of the most outspoken and charismatic characters in the elusive one per cent of people who make up the establishment in Canada.  He is a public person of international stature, at one time a media baron and still a man of great influence and wealth."  Black approved of the book, and signed a few copies.{{sfn|Ravvin|2014}}  Black is the author of numerous books and newspaper articles and has a reputation for the verbosity of his prose.{{sfn|Heer|2013}}

100 wordless black-and-white [[woodcut]] prints make up the book telling Black's life story.{{sfn|Heer|2013}}  Walker based the images on photographs, many from newspapers or magazines and familiar to the public.{{sfn|Postema|2015|pp=92–93}}  He communicated with Black via email while Black was in prison in Florida; Black reviewed the woodcut images, rejecting some he felt were too controversial and making suggestions for others.  Walker hand-printed the first edition of the book in a limited boxed edition of 13 copies, symbolic of the thirteen boxes Black removed from his office when it was investigated in 2005.  Each copy was signed by Black and priced at $1,500.  A popular edition later appeared from Porcupine's Quill{{sfn|Everett-Green|2013}} in 2013.{{sfn|Postema|2015|p=94}}

[[File:George Walker (printmaker).jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of a bearded man in a brimmed hat|[[George Walker (printmaker)|George Walker]] ]]

Walker's choice of Black as a subject stands in contrast to wordless novel traditions, which normally focused on emotional working-class characters and socialist politics; Black is a wealthy capitalist who reins in his emotions in public.  Walker does not use the book to attack or belittle Black, but simply relates the mogul's story from his days at [[Upper Canada College]]—where he was [[Caning|caned]]—through his rise in the media, his arrest and imprisonment for fraud and obstruction of justice and release from prison.{{sfn|Heer|2013}}

The '''U.S. Presidential IQ hoax''' was a mid-2001 [[e-mail]] and [[internet]] [[hoax]] that purported to provide a list of estimated [[IQ]]s of the [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]] from [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/hoaxes/presiq.htm

| accessdate = September 11, 2006
| date = July 15, 2004
| publisher = Snopes
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The hoax ==
The [[hoax]] [[email]] showed [[Bill Clinton]] having the highest IQ (182) and [[George W. Bush]] the lowest (91). &lt;!-- Also Donald Trump with an IQ of 156. I know right...
Source: 

http://www.techowiz.com/entertainment/celebrity-iqs-will-shock/34?xcmg=1 --&gt;However, the numbers claimed in the email were said to be fabricated, and the [[sociologist]]s and institutions (e.g., the "Lovenstein Institute") quoted in the article do not exist. The techniques purportedly used to measure IQ of the presidents are not recognized means of measuring IQs. The hoax also contains other factual errors.&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/hoaxes/presiq.htm
| title = President Bush Has Lowest IQ of all Presidents of past 50 Years
| accessdate = September 11, 2006
| date = July 15, 2004
| publisher = Snopes
}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the hoax was debunked, it appeared that Bush's IQ and college entrance test scores were never released.

== Reports about the hoax ==
Perhaps because the perception of George W. Bush having low intelligence was claimed by some political pundits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by politicians, including a spokesperson for [[Tony Blair]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| last = Walters
| first = Simon
| date = August 19, 2006
| newspaper = [[Daily Mail]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; the hoax report was assumed by some to be true. The British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'', for example, quoted the report in its diary section of July 19, 2001 and used it to belittle Bush, although the paper published a retraction two days after the [[Associated Press]] drew attention to the error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other media outlets to fall for the hoax included ''[[Bild]]'' ([[Germany]]), ''[[Pravda]]'' ([[Russia]]), and the ''[[Southland Times]]'' ([[New Zealand]]) as well as a few U.S. newspapers. The hoax came back to life in March 2007 in Spanish-language media when the Press Agency [[EFE]] distributed a piece referring to it. Dozens of media (primarily in their online versions) reproduced EFE's text. Among newspapers publishing the hoax were ''[[El País]]'' ([[Spain]]'s leading newspaper),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}{{dead link|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]], ''[[La Vanguardia]]'', and ''[[El Mercurio]]'' ([[Chile]]'s leading newspaper).

== IQ estimations by academics ==
In 2001, political psychologist Aubrey Immelman made an IQ estimation of G. W. Bush based on the [[SAT]] Reasoning Test results of Bush (1206) and [[Al Gore]], who achieved IQ scores of 133 and 134 in his school years: "It's tempting to employ Al Gore's IQ:SAT ratio of 134:135 as a formula for estimating Bush's probable intelligence quotient — an exercise in fuzzy statistics that predicts a score of 119."&lt;ref&gt;Aubrey Immelman: [http://www1.csbsju.edu/uspp/Election/bush011401.htm "Bush gets bad rap on intelligence"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030060057/http://www1.csbsju.edu/uspp/Election/bush011401.htm |date=October 30, 2012 }}. ''St. Cloud Times''. January 14, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 study analyzing presidential IQs by Dean Keith Simonton of U.C. Davis appeared in the journal ''Political Psychology''. Simonton's study analyzed the results of varied and often subjective historical material using the tools of [[historiometry]].  It estimated [[IQ]]s for all US presidents, and validated the headline of the hoax, which stated Bush's was the lowest of any president in the last 50 years, though it estimates his IQ considerably higher (by more than two [[standard deviations]]) than the 91 suggested in the hoax report. It rated G.W. Bush second to last since 1900, with an estimated IQ of 119 (the estimates ranged from 111 to 139).   Bush's estimated IQ was less than those estimated for [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant]] (120), [[James Monroe|Monroe]] (124), and [[Warren G. Harding|Harding]] (124). The same study estimated president Bill Clinton's IQ at 149, behind only those of [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] (151), [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]] (154) and [[John Quincy Adams]] (169).&lt;ref name="study2006"&gt;{{cite journal
| author = Dean Keith Simonton
|date= August 2006
| title = Presidential IQ, Openness, Intellectual Brilliance, and Leadership: Estimates and Correlations for 42 U.S. Chief Executives
| journal = Political Psychology
| volume = 27

| jstor=3792393
| accessdate = September 11, 2006
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simonton's 2006 study follows earlier studies done on this subject, including a 1926 study by [[Catharine Cox Miles]]. This study concluded that there is a [[statistically significant]] [[correlation]] of 0.56 between a U.S. President's IQ and his [[Historical rankings of U.S. Presidents|perceived amount of success]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/blogs/2011/10/smart-president/ |title=How Smart Does a President Have to Be? |publisher=Britannica Blog |date=September 6, 2013 |accessdate=September 10, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102092216/http://www.britannica.com/blogs/2011/10/smart-president/ |archivedate=November 2, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is worth noting that other sources and/or studies might have different results for the IQs of United States Presidents. For instance, John F. Kennedy's IQ has also been estimated to have been significantly lower than in this 2006 study (Chester Arthur [[biographer]] [[Thomas C. Reeves]] refers to an actual IQ test by Kennedy with a score of 119&lt;ref&gt;Thomas C. Reeves: [https://archive.is/20130708080355/http://hnn.us/roundup/entries/31513.html "Presidential IQ"]. ''[[History News Network]]''. November 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;), while Richard Nixon's IQ has also been estimated to have been significantly higher than in this study.
