'''ASA style''' is a widely accepted format for writing university research papers in the field of [[sociology]]. It specifies the arrangement and punctuation of [[footnote]]s and [[bibliography|bibliographies]]. Standards for ASA style are specified in the ASA [[Style Guide]], which is published by the [[American Sociological Association]], the main scholarly organization for academic sociologists in the [[United States]]. The ''ASA Style Guide'', published by the [[American Sociological Association]], is designed to aid authors preparing manuscripts for ASA journals and publications.

==General features==

ASA style is closely related in appearance and function to APA (American Psychological Association) style. As with [[APA style]], the general format for citing references is [[parenthetical referencing]]. All references are to be included at the end of the paper in a section titled "References," rather than "Works Cited" as in [[MLA style]]. Also unlike MLA style, parenthetical references include the year of publication. The "author-date" in text citation system is a readily recognizable feature of ASA style. This emphasis on dates is carried over into the references section, where the date is the first piece of information to follow the author's or authors' name(s).

==Software support==

ASA style is supported by most major [[reference management software]] programs, including Endnote, Procite, Zotero, Refworks, and so forth, making the formatting of references a fairly straightforward task.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12994">'''Absolute dating''' is the process of [[chronological dating|determining an age]] on a specified [[chronology]] in [[archaeology]] and [[geology]]. Some scientists prefer the terms '''chronometric''' or '''calendar dating''', as use of the word "absolute" implies an unwarranted certainty of accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Evans|editor-first=Susan Toby|editor2-last=David L. |editor2-first=Webster|title=Archaeology of ancient Mexico and Central America : an encyclopedia|year=2001|publisher=Garland|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=9780815308874|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Henke|first=Winfried|title=Handbook of paleoanthropology|year=2007|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=9783540324744|page=312}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Absolute dating provides a numerical age or range in contrast with [[relative dating]] which places events in order without any measure of the age between events.

In archaeology, absolute dating is usually based on the physical, chemical, and life properties of the materials of artifacts, buildings, or other items that have been modified by humans and by historical associations with materials with known dates (coins and [[recorded history|written history]]). Techniques include [[dendrochronology|tree ring]]s in timbers, [[radiocarbon dating]] of wood or bones, and [[trapped-charge dating]] methods such as [[thermoluminescence dating]] of glazed ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kelly|first1=Robert L.|last2=Thomas|first2=David Hurst|title=Archaeology: Down to Earth|date=2012|isbn=9781133608646|edition=Fifth edition.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coins found in excavations may have their production date written on them, or there may be written records describing the coin and when it was used, allowing the site to be associated with a particular calendar year.

In [[historical geology]], the primary methods of absolute dating involve using the [[radiometric dating|radioactive decay]] of elements trapped in rocks or minerals, including isotope systems from very young (radiocarbon dating with {{chem|14|C}}) to systems such as [[uranium–lead dating]] that allow acquisition of absolute ages for some of the oldest rocks on earth.

==Radiometric techniques==
{{main|Radiometric dating}}
Radiometric dating is based on the known and constant rate of decay of [[Radionuclide|radioactive isotopes]] into their [[radiogenic nuclide|radiogenic daughter isotopes]]. Particular isotopes are suitable for different applications due to the type of atoms present in the mineral or other material and its approximate age. For example, techniques based on isotopes with half lives in the thousands of years, such as Carbon-14, cannot be used to date materials that have ages on the order of billions of years, as the detectable amounts of the radioactive atoms and their  decayed daughter isotopes will be too small to measure within the uncertainty of the instruments.

===Radiocarbon dating===
{{main|Radiocarbon dating}}
One of the most widely used and well-known absolute dating techniques is carbon-14 (or [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon]]) dating, which is used to date organic remains.  This is a radiometric technique since it is based on radioactive decay.  Cosmic radiation entering the earth’s atmosphere produces carbon-14, and plants take in carbon-14 as they fix carbon dioxide.  Carbon-14 moves up the food chain as animals eat plants and as predators eat other animals.  With death, the uptake of carbon-14 stops. 

It takes 5,730 years for half the carbon-14 to change to nitrogen; this is the half-life of carbon-14. After another 5,730 years only one-quarter of the original carbon-14 will remain.  After yet another 5,730 years only one-eighth will be left.  

By measuring the carbon-14 in [[organic material]], scientists can determine the  date of death of the organic matter in an artifact or [[ecofact]].

====Limitations====
The relatively short half-life of carbon-14, 5,730 years, makes the reliable only  up to about 50,000 years. The technique often cannot pinpoint the date of an archeological site better than historic records, but is highly effective for precise dates when calibrated with other dating techniques such as [[Dendrochronology|tree-ring dating]].

An additional problem with carbon-14 dates from archeological sites is known as the "old wood" problem.  It is possible, particularly in dry, desert climates, for organic materials such as from dead trees to remain in their natural state for hundreds of years before people use them as firewood or building materials, after which they become part of the archaeological record. Thus dating that particular tree does not necessarily indicate when the fire burned or the structure was built. 

For this reason, many archaeologists prefer to use samples from short-lived plants for radiocarbon dating.  The development of [[accelerator mass spectrometry]] (AMS) dating, which allows a date to be obtained from a very small sample, has been very useful in this regard.

===Potassium-argon dating===
{{main|Potassium–argon dating}}
Other radiometric dating techniques are available for earlier periods.  One of the most widely used is [[potassium–argon dating]] (K–Ar dating).  [[Potassium-40]] is a radioactive isotope of potassium that decays into argon-40.  The half-life of potassium-40 is 1.3 billion years, far longer than that of carbon-14, allowing much older samples to be dated. Potassium is common in rocks and minerals, allowing many samples of [[Geochronology|geochronological]] or [[Archeology|archeological]] interest to be dated. 

[[Argon]], a noble gas, is not commonly incorporated into such samples except when produced ''in situ'' through radioactive decay. The date measured reveals the last time that the object was heated past the [[closure temperature]] at which the trapped argon can escape the lattice. K–Ar dating was used to calibrate the [[geomagnetic polarity time scale]].

==Luminescence dating==
{{main|Luminescence dating}}
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}

===Thermoluminescence===
Thermoluminescence testing also dates items to the last time they were heated.  This technique is based on the principle that all objects absorb radiation from the environment.  This process frees electrons within minerals that remain caught within the item. 

Heating an item to 500 degrees Celsius or higher releases the trapped [[electron]]s, producing light.  This light can be measured to determine the last time the item was heated.

Radiation levels do not remain constant over time.  Fluctuating levels can skew results – for example, if an item went through several high radiation eras, thermoluminescence will return an older date for the item.  Many factors can spoil the sample before testing as well, exposing the sample to heat or direct light may cause some of the electrons to dissipate, causing the item to date younger.

Because of these and other factors, Thermoluminescence is at the most about 15% accurate.  It cannot be used to accurately date a site on its own.  However, it can be used to confirm the antiquity of an item.

===Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL)===
Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating constrains the time at which sediment was last exposed to light. During sediment transport, exposure to sunlight 'zeros' the luminescence signal. Upon burial, the sediment accumulates a luminescence signal as natural ambient radiation gradually ionises the mineral grains. 

Careful sampling under dark conditions allows the sediment to be exposed to artificial light in the laboratory which releases the OSL signal. The amount of luminescence released is used to calculate the equivalent dose (De) that the sediment has acquired since deposition, which can be used in combination with the dose rate (Dr) to calculate the age.

==Dendrochronology==
{{Main|Dendrochronology}}
[[Image:tree.ring.arp.jpg|thumb|240px|The growth rings of a tree at [[Bristol Zoo]], England. Each ring represents one year; the outside rings, near the bark, are the youngest.]]
'''Dendrochronology''' or '''tree-ring dating''' is the scientific method of dating based on the analysis of patterns of '''tree rings''', also known as '''growth rings'''. Dendrochronology can date the time at which tree rings were formed, in many types of wood, to the exact calendar year.  

Dendrochronology has three main areas of application: [[paleoecology]], where it is used to determine certain aspects of past [[ecology|ecologies]] (most prominently climate); [[archaeology]], where it is used to date old buildings, etc.; and [[radiocarbon dating]], where it is used to calibrate radiocarbon ages (see below).

In some areas of the world, it is possible to date wood back a few thousand years, or even many thousands.  Currently, the maximum for fully anchored chronologies is a little over 11,000 years from present.&lt;ref name="arts.cornell"&gt;{{cite journal |author=McGovern PJ |title=Science in Archaeology: A Review |journal=American Journal of Archaeology |volume=99 |issue=1 |pages=79–142 |year=1995 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amino acid dating==

H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2008 [http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2008AM/finalprogram/abstract_147285.htm] quote: ''The results provide a compelling case for applicability of amino acid racemization methods as a tool for evaluating changes in depositional dynamics, sedimentation rates, time-averaging, temporal resolution of the fossil record, and taphonomic overprints across sequence stratigraphic cycles.''&lt;/ref&gt; used to estimate the age of a specimen in [[paleobiology]], [[archaeology]], [[forensic science]], [[taphonomy]], [[sedimentary geology]] and other fields.  This technique relates changes in [[amino acid]] molecules to the time elapsed since they were formed. All biological tissues contain [[amino acid]]s.  All amino acids except [[glycine]] (the simplest one) are [[optical activity|optically active]], having an asymmetric [[carbon]] atom. This means that the amino acid can have two different configurations, "D" or "L" which are mirror images of each other.  

With a few important exceptions, living organisms keep all their amino acids in the "L" configuration.  When an organism dies, control over the configuration of the amino acids ceases, and the ratio of D to L moves from a value near 0 towards an equilibrium value near 1, a process called [[racemization]].  Thus, measuring the ratio of D to L in a sample enables one to estimate how long ago the specimen died.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~dsk5/AAGL/method/principles.html Amino Acid Geochronology Laboratory, Northern Arizona University]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mulloy 1955.jpg|thumb|upright|right|William Mulloy and a moai being restored at Ahu Akivi]]
'''Ahu Akivi''' is  a particular sacred place in [[Rapa Nui]] (or [[Easter Island]]) in the [[Valparaíso Region]] of [[Chile]], looking out towards the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The site has seven [[moai]], all of equal shape and size, and is also known as a celestial observatory that was set up around the 16th century. The site is located inland, rather than along the coast. Moai statues were considered by the early people of Rapa Nui as their ancestors or Tupuna that were believed to be the reincarnation of important kings or leaders of their clans. The Moais were erected to protect and bring prosperity to their clan and village.&lt;ref name=Stones&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lost-civilizations.net/easter-island-stones-history.html|title=Easter Island: stones, history. Easter Island|accessdate=13 August 2013|publisher= Lost Civilizations.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A particular feature of the seven identical moai statues is that they exactly face sunset during the [[Spring Equinox]] and have their backs to the sunrise during the [[Autumn Equinox]]. Such an astronomically precise feature is seen only at this location on the island.&lt;ref name=Stones/&gt;

==Geography==
Ahu Akivi, aligned in an east–west direction,&lt;ref name=Easter&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.osterinsel.de/05-ahu-akivi.htm|title=Ahu Akivi – The Seven scouts from Easter Island|language=German|accessdate=13 August 2013|publisher=Osterinsel.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; is located on the flank of the southern slope of Maunga Terevaka at Rapauni and it is surrounded by fairly flat agricultural land. It is {{Convert|2.3|km}} inland in the non coastal zone and is at an elevation of {{Convert|140|m}}. Ahu Vai Teka is at a distance of {{Convert|706.8|m}} from Ahu Kavi which is considered as part of the Ahu Akivi-Ahu Kavi complex.{{Sfn|Peregrine|Ember|2001|p=51}}

From Hanga Roa, an inland road leads to the site via the volcanic cone of [[Terevaka]] ({{Convert|510|m}} peak level). The coast road is via [[Playa Anakena]]. On this road there are many moi statues lying scattered and un restored. There are paths branching off to [[Puna Pau]], which is a quarry of low volcanic crater with red coloured rocks known as [[scoria]], which has been used to carve 70 of the "top hat" of the statues known as [[pukao]] which could be cylindrical top knot of hair or grass hat or turban. Further on, the site of Ahu Akivi is reached.{{Sfn|Graham|2003|p=537}} The site is located to the Northeast of [[Hanga Roa]],{{Sfn|Flenley|Bahn|2003|p=250}} the capital city of Easter Island, about {{Convert|10|km}} to its north.&lt;ref name=Easter/&gt;
 
The Rano Raraku quarry from where the statues were made is at least {{Convert|15|km}} away and free access is through the land route held by the clans.{{Sfn|Peregrine|Ember|2001|p=51}}

==History==
Ahu Akivi is part of the Ahu Akivi-Vai Teka complex which was built up by the Rapa Nui people in two phases. In the first phase, during the 16th century a central rectangular platform was created on a leveled surface. It  had wings projecting to the north and the south directions. An approach ramp was also part of this platform which led to the ceremonial plaza stretching {{Convert|25|m}} towards the west of the central platform. A cremation ground existed behind the central platform. The second phase of construction was elaborately planned and implemented in the early years of the 17th century when the platform was modified, a ramp was created, seven statues of equal size were erected. Another crematorium was also built. A cave in which people used to reside was also used as tomb during historic times.{{Sfn|Peregrine|Ember|2001|p=51}}

The other Ahu in the complex is the [[Ahu Vai Teka]], which is a much smaller platform of {{Convert|16|m}} length made up of rough lava stone blocks. There is no statue now, though one is believed to have existed initially. Both the ahus were believed to have been aligned astronomically with respect to the Sun. Both are located in the territory of the Miru, the highest ranking clan and the western confederacy, and  both were contemporary. It is also conjectured that the seven statues were placed at Ahu Akivi at least 150 years before the first Europeans found the island when the clan was functional at that time. It is also evident that their culture existed for 250–300 years with economic prosperity with political stability.{{Sfn|Peregrine|Ember|2001|p=51}}

In 1955, [[Thor Heyerdahl]] recruited American archaeologist [[William Mulloy]] and his Chilean associate, Gonzalo Figueroa García-Huidobro, who restored the statues to their original position; they had found them in knocked down condition in 1960.&lt;ref name=Stones/&gt; Mulloy's work on the Akivi-Vaiteka Complex was supported by the [[Fulbright Foundation]] and by grants from the [[University of Wyoming]], the [[University of Chile]] and the [[World Monument Fund|International Fund for Monuments]]. Ahu Akivi also gives its name to one of the seven regions of [[Rapa Nui National Park]].&lt;ref name=Stones/&gt;

The statues on the island invariably faced the village as a protective mana, but in the case of the Ahu Akivi statues they face towards the sea. There is a legend narrated for this positioning of the seven statues. It is conjectured that the [[Rapanui people]] did it to propitiate the sea to help the navigators. However, according to an oral tradition, Hotu Matu’s priest had a dream in which the King's soul flew across the ocean when the Rapa Nui island was seen by him. He then sent scouts navigating across the sea to locate the island and to find people to settle there. Seven of these scouts stayed back on the island waiting for the king to arrive. These seven are represented by the seven stone statues erected in their honour.{{Sfn|Kirch|1986|p=73}}&lt;ref name=Easter/&gt;

==Features==
[[File:Easterstatues.jpg|right|thumb|Closer view of Ahu Akivi statues]]
The architectural features of an Ahu platform were discerned by archaeologists, depending on its length under five categories. These are: A central platform of varying length; platform made of crude masonry in its rear wall or with fine masonry in the rear wall; with or without wings; with one or more statues; a red scoria top knot (headgear), ramp, a crematoriums plaza pavement, crafted front retaining wall, a cornice made of red scoria. In the case of the Ahu Akivi all these features have been noted except that the rear part of the platform is made of crude masonry wall.{{Sfn|Kirch|1986|p=73}} Another feature of the foundation of the platform is that the stones used to make it are not from the island but were brought as ballast in the 19th century in a ship.&lt;ref name=Easter/&gt;

Apart from the above, archeologists also unearthed stone disks, small statues, and fish hooks made of stones and bones indicative of burial ceremonies that were performed at the site.{{Sfn|Kirch|1986|p=73}}

The seven moai statues are located with absolute astronomical precision. Thus, the sacred observatory and sanctuary with all the seven moai look exactly towards the point where the sun sets during the equinox and which also aligns with the Moon. Each one is of {{Convert|16|ft}} height and weighs about 18 tons,{{Sfn|Maras|2010|p=25}} and its length is {{Convert|70|m}}.&lt;ref name=Easter/&gt;

During the excavations done here, the archaeologists also found tree root [[moulds]], indicative of vegetative cover in the past.{{Sfn|Flenley|Bahn|2003|p=250}}

==Restoration==
In 1960, when the American archaeologist and his associate carried out restoration, it took them one month to rise and fix the first moai in place. They used a stone ramp and two wooden levers to carry out this operation. However, they took less than a week to raise the seventh one.&lt;ref name=Akivi&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/easter/explore/ahuakivi.html|title= Ahu Akivi|accessdate=13 August 2013|publisher=NOVA Online and Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Entering Can. (White Rock, BC) from U.S. (Blaine, WA).jpg|thumb|Cars approaching Canada border at [[White Rock, British Columbia|White Rock]], BC in Canada from [[Blaine, Washington|Blaine]], WA in the U.S.]]

[[United States nationality law|U.S. citizens]] and [[Permanent residence (United States)|permanent residents]] entering [[Canada]] by land are required to possess the requisite documentation, and to meet other criteria before they are allowed entry into Canada. Consequently, travelers must also meet the requirements for re-entering the U.S. at the end of their visit.

== Visitor entry into Canada ==

Entry into Canada is solely determined by [[Canada Border Services Agency]] (CBSA) officials in accordance with Canadian law.&lt;ref name="USDS-CSI-CA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1082.html|title=Country Specific Information: Canada|date=December 11, 2007|website=U.S. Department of State [[Bureau of Consular Affairs]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913113532/http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1082.html|archivedate=2008-09-13|deadurl=yes|accessdate=August 27, 2008|df=}} [https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1765.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors are required to have the necessary travel documentation and be in good health.&lt;ref name=CIC-VC-WCA&gt;{{cite web

== Documentation ==

Canadian law requires that all persons entering Canada must carry proof of both citizenship and identity.&lt;ref name=USDS-CSI-CA/&gt; A valid [[United States passport|U.S. passport]]&lt;ref name=USDS-CSI-CA/&gt; or [[passport card]]&lt;ref name=USDS-CSI-CA/&gt; is preferred, although a [[birth certificate]], naturalization certificate, citizenship certificate, or another document proving U.S. nationality, together with a government-issued photo ID (such as a [[driver's license]]) are acceptable to establish identity and nationality.&lt;ref name=bsf5082&gt;{{cite web

|quote= If you are a United States citizen (U.S.), you do not need a passport to enter Canada; however, you should carry proof of your citizenship such as a birth certificate, a certificate of citizenship or naturalization or a Certificate of Indian Status, as well as a photo ID.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the documents required to return to the United States can be more restrictive (for example, a birth certificate and photo ID are insufficient) – see the section below on [[American entry into Canada by land#Return entry into the U.S.|Return entry into the U.S.]]

=== Enhanced driver's licenses ===
An enhanced driver's license (EDL), currently issued by the states of [[Michigan]], [[Minnesota]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Vermont]], and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], is specifically designed to meet the requirements of the [[Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative]] (WHTI) to re-enter the United States via a land or water border. An EDL will also suffice as proof of identity and citizenship for American citizens entering Canada by road.&lt;ref name=CBSA_GFT&gt;{{cite web

=== NEXUS/FAST ===
[[NEXUS (frequent traveler program)|NEXUS]] is a joint U S./Canadian program for pre-approved, low-risk travelers and requires an extensive background check and face to face interview with border officials of both nations. FAST ([[Free and Secure Trade]]) is the equivalent for international truck drivers. Membership in either program can expedite border clearance through the use of dedicated lanes.

=== United States permanent residents ===
United States permanent residents are required to show their [[Permanent residence (United States)|Permanent Resident Card]] (green card). No passport or visa is required.&lt;ref name=CBSA_GFT/&gt;

=== Minors 15 and under ===

Children under 16 need only present proof of U.S. citizenship.&lt;ref name=USDS-CSI-CA/&gt; Nevertheless, it is recommended that identification for children be carried anyway.&lt;ref name=F-CAN-PT-ERC&gt;{{cite web

A divorced parent who has or shares custody of a child should carry a copy of the custody document.&lt;ref name=F-CAN-PT-ERC/&gt; An adult who is not the parent or legal guardian of a child they are accompanying should have written permission from the parents or guardians to supervise the child.&lt;ref name=F-CAN-PT-ERC/&gt; When traveling in a group of vehicles, parents or guardians should be in the same vehicle as their children when arriving at the border.&lt;ref name=F-CAN-PT-ERC/&gt; CBSA personnel are looking for missing children and may question adults about children traveling with them.&lt;ref name=F-CAN-PT-ERC/&gt;

=== Documentation for vehicles ===

Persons driving into Canada must have their [[vehicle registration|vehicle's registration]] document and [[proof of insurance]].&lt;ref name=F-CAN-PT-ERC/&gt;

== Visas and admissibility==

A visa is not required for U.S. citizens to visit Canada for up to 180 days.&lt;ref name=USDS-CSI-CA/&gt; Anyone seeking to enter Canada for any purpose besides a visit (e.g. to work, study or immigrate) must qualify for the appropriate entry status and can see the [http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/index.asp Canadian immigration website].&lt;ref name=USDS-CSI-CA/&gt; The [[Embassy of Canada in Washington|Canadian embassy]] or nearest consulate can be contacted for additional information.&lt;ref name=USDS-CSI-CA/&gt;

=== Inadmissibility ===

[[Image:CIC Form IMM 5292 anonymized.jpg|thumb| "Allowed to Leave Canada" form ({{as of|2008|lc=y}}) issued by [[Citizenship and Immigration Canada|CIC]] to an inadmissible person]]

Some persons are inadmissible—they are not allowed to enter Canada.&lt;ref name=CIC-VC-WCA/&gt;

{{As of|2011}}, if a person is denied entry and advised to re-enter the U.S., they are issued form IMM 1282B.&lt;ref name=CBSA-Clearance&gt;{{cite web

|date= 2011-05-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form indicates that the person is allowed to withdraw their application to enter Canada, and is allowed to leave Canada. Persons who have been denied entry and provided this form are advised by the CBSA to show this form to the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP). There appears to be no legal precedent, however, for the traveler to voluntarily submit this form to the CBP, and doing so may cause the CBP to consider the traveler suspicious, and as a result they may subject the traveler to exhaustive questioning and search.{{Verify source|date=October 2009}} Information about the denial of entry may nevertheless be automatically and immediately available to the CBP.

==== Grounds for inadmissibility ====

Individuals may be refused entry to or removed from Canada on the following grounds:&lt;ref name=CIC-VC-WIA&gt;{{cite web

* Health reasons, if their condition is likely to endanger public health or public safety, or might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demands on health or social services.&lt;ref name=CIC-VC-WIA/&gt;
* Financial reasons, if they are unable or unwilling to support themselves and their family members.&lt;ref name=CIC-VC-WIA/&gt;
* Misrepresentation, which includes providing false information or withholding information directly related to decisions made under Canada's [[Immigration and Refugee Protection Act]] (IRPA).&lt;ref name=CIC-VC-WIA/&gt;
* Failure to comply with any provision of IRPA.&lt;ref name=CIC-VC-WIA/&gt; For instance, an attempt by persons who, having previously been deported from Canada, seek to enter Canada without written authorization.&lt;ref name=CIC-VC-WIA/&gt;
* Having an inadmissible family member.&lt;ref name=CIC-VC-WIA/&gt;

==== Avoiding inadmissibility ====

Persons can be denied entry into Canada on the basis of suspicion alone. In particular, the CBSA may deny entry to persons they doubt will be able to support themselves and their dependents, or whose willingness and means to return to the U.S. is in doubt.&lt;ref name=F-CAN-PT-ERC/&gt; Certain documents, such as the following, can serve to reduce these doubts:&lt;ref name=CIC-GMMEC&gt;{{Cite journal

* Information about destination in Canada, including destination address, destination telephone number, and name of the person being visited.&lt;ref name=CIC-GMMEC/&gt;

==== Criminal inadmissibility ====
A single criminal conviction, no matter how minor or how long ago, is grounds for exclusion from Canada.&lt;ref name=CIC-VC-WCA/&gt; With the exception of civil traffic violations such as speeding, and some municipal [[Local ordinance|ordinance]] infractions (which are typically not handled through the legal system) such as parking violations or littering, persons with a conviction must either have received a [[pardon]], applied for and been accepted for '''rehabilitation''', met the requirement to be considered '''deemed rehabilitated''', or if ineligible for rehabilitation or deemed rehabilitated status, apply for and receive a '''temporary resident permit''' (a special type of visa) to enter Canada.&lt;ref name=CIC-VC-OCI&gt;{{cite web

|quote= Depending on the nature of the offence, the time elapsed and your behaviour since it was committed or since you were sentenced, you may no longer be considered inadmissible to Canada.

Individuals with a criminal conviction that has been expunged are allowed entry into Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ENF 2/OP 18 Evaluating Inadmissibility|url=http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/manuals/enf/enf02-eng.pdf|publisher=CIC.GA.CA| quote=The "committing an act" inadmissibility provisions would generally not be applied in the following scenarios: [...] the person admits to committing the act but has received a record suspension or the record is expunged; |accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the criminal database might not be up-to-date, it is best to have paperwork of the expungement to guarantee entry. A letter from an attorney will suffice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Can I Get into Canada with a DUI Expungement?|url=http://www.canadaduientrylaw.com/expungement.php|publisher=CDUIL|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Rehabilitation =====
To be a candidate for rehabilitation, at least five years (or more depending on the severity of the offense) since the conclusion of any sentence imposed (imprisonment, probation, fine paid, suspension of driver's license, etc ... ) must have elapsed. Due to differences between legal systems, an overturned conviction or dismissed charges does '''not''' automatically overcome inadmissibility, unless the offense itself occurred in Canada. However, applicants in either of these situations can use an abbreviated process and the five-year waiting period generally does not apply. In simple cases, such as a single misdemeanor conviction, the application can typically be reviewed and approved by a Canadian Embassy, High Counsel, or CIC office. For more complicated histories or in the case of a felony conviction, the application will need to be forwarded to [[Ottawa]] for approval. Processing time in either case can take several months to a year or more, so it is advisable to begin the process of applying for rehabilitation well in advance of any planned travel to Canada. Factors considered when determining whether to approve an application for rehabilitation or not include the nature of the offense, the time elapsed and one's behavior since the offense was committed or since the sentence. Applicants are required to obtain clearances from law enforcement in the communities in which they have lived, and are strongly urged to submit documentation showing stability and reform such as records of employment and any education or treatment programs completed, as well as character references.&lt;ref name=CIC-VC-OCI/&gt;

A person with a past conviction can also be "deemed rehabilitated" by an immigration officer at the port of entry. Ten years must have elapsed since the conclusion of any sentence imposed and other criteria must be satisfied. Persons attempting to enter under the deemed rehabilitated system should also bring law enforcement clearances, documents showing a stable and reformed life, and character references, as the decision as to whether to admit someone as deemed rehabilitated is completely at the discretion of the border official and there is no recourse or right of appeal should deemed rehabilitated status be denied.&lt;ref name=CIC-VC-OCI/&gt; It should be noted that anyone with a ''felony'' conviction (unless a pardon was granted) cannot be deemed rehabilitated and must instead apply for rehabilitation or a temporary resident permit.

===== Temporary resident permits =====
Temporary resident permits are a one-time authorization for someone who is otherwise criminally inadmissible to enter Canada. Permits are rarely granted without cause, typically only in extenuating circumstances (such as a documented family emergency), on significant humanitarian grounds (such as sponsoring an inadmissible spouse or child), or for reasons of Canadian national interest, or in circumstances where the reasons for criminal inadmissibility are negligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Niren|first=Michael|title=Denied Entry To Canada: TRP Applications|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HunrhDeLQj0|accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; TRP's are usually issued with varying restrictions and can be revoked if deemed necessary. Temporary resident permits can, however, be obtained by an individual who has a criminal record if it can be proven that he has been rehabilitated and is able to demonstrate that the need for him to enter Canada outweighs any risk that he may cause to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jtmimmigration.com/travel-canada-misdemeanor-charge-record/|title=Can you travel to Canada with a misdemeanor charge on your record? {{!}}|date=2016-10-21|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Inadmissible family member =====
If an individual is deemed inadmissible, members of his or her family ''may'' also be deemed inadmissible solely based on that fact.

===== Offenses committed as a minor =====
In theory, a person is not inadmissible if they were convicted of a crime before the age of 18 and were tried as a young offender or through the juvenile justice system. If the person in question ''could'' have been tried as an adult (which is frequently the case in the US, where minors as young as 8 can be tried as an adult), regardless of whether they actually were or not, they are inadmissible.

Firearms are much more strictly controlled in Canada than in the U.S.  Visitors bringing any firearms into Canada, or planning to borrow and use firearms while in Canada, are required to declare the firearms in writing using a Non-Resident Firearm Declaration form.&lt;ref name=USDS-CSI-CA/&gt; Multiple firearms can be declared at the same time.&lt;ref name=USDS-CSI-CA/&gt; Upon acceptance, this declaration serves as a temporary license and registration certificate for up to 60 days.&lt;ref name=USDS-CSI-CA/&gt; The Non-Resident Firearm Declaration has a cost of $25 (Canadian).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/fs-fd/fee-frais-eng.htm Fees for Firearm Documents]&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors planning to borrow a firearm in Canada are required to obtain in advance a Temporary Firearms Borrowing License, the cost of which is $30 (Canadian), payable at the border.&lt;ref name=USDS-CSI-CA/&gt; These forms are required to be signed before a CBSA officer at the border.&lt;ref name=USDS-CSI-CA/&gt; Note that the forms are not available at the border itself. Details and downloadable forms are provided by the [[Canadian Firearms Program]].&lt;ref name=USDS-CSI-CA/&gt;

Canada has three classes of firearms: non-restricted, restricted, and prohibited.&lt;ref name=USDS-CSI-CA/&gt; Non-restricted firearms include most ordinary hunting rifles and shotguns.&lt;ref name=USDS-CSI-CA/&gt; These can be brought temporarily into Canada for sporting or hunting use during hunting season, use in competitions, in-transit movement through Canada, or personal protection against wildlife in remote areas of Canada.&lt;ref name=USDS-CSI-CA/&gt; Any person wishing to bring a hunting rifle into Canada is required to be at least 18 years old, and the firearm must be properly stored for transport.&lt;ref name=USDS-CSI-CA/&gt; Restricted firearms are primarily handguns.&lt;ref name=USDS-CSI-CA/&gt; A restricted firearm may be brought into Canada, but an [[Authorization to Transport]] permit must be obtained in advance from a [[Chief Firearms Officer]].&lt;ref name=USDS-CSI-CA/&gt; Prohibited firearms include fully automatic, converted automatics and assault-type weapons. Prohibited firearms are not allowed into Canada.&lt;ref name=USDS-CSI-CA/&gt; A comprehensive guide on importation of firearms and weapons is published by the CBSA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbsa.gc.ca/publications/pub/bsf5044-eng.html http://cbsa.gc.ca/publications/pub/bsf5044-eng.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is recommended that the Canadian embassy or a consulate, or the Canadian Firearms Program be contacted for detailed information and instructions on temporarily importing firearms in advance of any travel.&lt;ref name=USDS-CSI-CA/&gt; In all cases, travelers are required to declare to Canadian authorities any firearms and weapons in their possession when entering Canada.&lt;ref name=USDS-CSI-CA/&gt; If a traveler is denied permission to bring in the firearm, there may be facilities near border crossings where firearms may be stored, pending the traveler's return to the U.S.&lt;ref name=USDS-CSI-CA/&gt; Canadian law requires that officials confiscate firearms and weapons from those crossing the border that deny having them in their possession.&lt;ref name=USDS-CSI-CA/&gt; Confiscated firearms and weapons are never returned.&lt;ref name=USDS-CSI-CA/&gt; Possession of an undeclared firearm can result in a five-year prison sentence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cr/SOR-98-215/bo-ga:s_14_2/20091008/en#anchorbo-ga:s_14_2 Importation and Exportation of Firearms Regulations (Individuals) (SOR/98-215) which is an offence under S.109 of the ''Firearms Act'']  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605062817/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cr/SOR-98-215/bo-ga%3As_14_2/20091008/en |date=June 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Prohibited items ====

Electronic media of travelers entering Canada can be randomly checked.&lt;ref name=USDS-CSI-CA/&gt; Computers and mobile phone are subject to search without a warrant at the border, and illegal content can result in the seizure of the electronic device as well as detention, arrest and prosecution of the bearer.&lt;ref name=USDS-CSI-CA/&gt; Agents may access or otherwise view contents of online accounts and services if your electronic device contains saved passwords or access tokens.

Certain weapons that may be legal to possess in the U.S. are prohibited weapons in Canada, most notably [[pepper spray]], [[Mace (spray)|mace]] and [[Taser]]s. Under the Canadian [[Criminal Code (Canada)|''Criminal Code'']], a person can face a maximum of five years in prison for unauthorized possession&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-91.html#docCont ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 91.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208063935/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-91.html#docCont |date=December 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and five years for unauthorized importation of an illegal weapon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-104.html#docCont ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 104.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208050603/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-104.html#docCont |date=December 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If, however, it can be proven that the person, despite knowing that its importation or possession is illegal, imports or possess a prohibited weapon, the maximum penalty increases to ten years imprisonment.

Canadian law prohibits the unlawful importation or trafficking of controlled substances and narcotics.&lt;ref name=USDS-CSI-CA/&gt; A number of travelers, including Americans, have been arrested for attempting to smuggle [[khat]], an herbal stimulant from East Africa, into Canada.&lt;ref name=USDS-CSI-CA/&gt; Smugglers risk substantial fines, a permanent bar from Canada, and imprisonment.&lt;ref name=USDS-CSI-CA/&gt;

It is recommended that prescription medicines be in their original prescription container. Suspicious looking or unidentifiable pills found during a search can be tested for narcotics. Entry into Canada can be delayed until the tests have completed. Moreover, their discovery can lead to being denied entry even if the tests passed.

=== Handling disagreements ===

A person or organization may disagree with the CBSA about an assessment or decision made by the CBSA.&lt;ref name=CBSA-DRA&gt;{{cite web

==== Appeals ====

Persons who believe that they have not received their full entitlements under Canadian law, and have been unable to reach an agreement with the CBSA on a duty or penalty matter, have the right to a formal review of their file.&lt;ref name=CBSA-FR&gt;{{cite web

The role of the appeals representative who reviews a case is to carry out a complete, professional, and impartial review.&lt;ref name=CBSA-FR/&gt; This representative reviews the case by interpreting acts administered by the CBSA and reviewing CBSA policies, considering the appellant's point of view; and when necessary, asking for a technical opinion from CBSA experts or seeking legal advice from the [[Department of Justice (Canada)|Canadian Department of Justice]].&lt;ref name=CBSA-FR/&gt;

The representative who reviews the case will not have been involved in the original assessment, determination, or ruling of a duty, penalty or other matter.&lt;ref name=CBSA-FR/&gt; The appellant can discuss the case with an appeals representative, and has the right to obtain certain documents related to the case.&lt;ref name=CBSA-FR/&gt;

The CBSA does not charge for a review.&lt;ref name=CBSA-FR/&gt; If a person is not satisfied with the review, a further appeal can be made to the appropriate court or, to the [[Canadian International Trade Tribunal]] for relevant matters.&lt;ref name=CBSA-FR/&gt;

== Return entry into the U.S. ==

&lt;!-- Note that this article is not about Canadians entering the U.S. Accordingly, the information below does not and should not relate to that topic. This section is strictly about Americans reentering the U.S. from Canada by land only. --&gt;

=== Documentation ===
Beginning in 2009, U.S. citizens aged 16 and older traveling into the U.S. from Canada by land or sea (including ferries) have had to present documents denoting citizenship and identity, which include a valid U.S. passport, U.S. passport card, Trusted Traveler Program card (NEXUS, SENTRI, Global Entry or FAST), an Enhanced Driver's License, U.S. Military identification card when traveling on official orders, U.S. Merchant Mariner document when traveling in conjunction with official maritime business, Form I-872 American Indian Card, or (when available) Enhanced Tribal Card. Children under age 16 (or under 19, if traveling with a school, religious group, or other youth group) need only to present a birth certificate issued by an appropriate state or local authority, or a Naturalization Certificate.&lt;ref name = CBP-WHTI&gt;{{cite web

|quote= Since January 2007 U.S. citizens traveling by air to and from Canada have needed a valid passport to enter or re-enter the United States. Beginning January 31, 2008, U.S. and Canadian citizens aged 19 and older traveling into the U.S. from Canada by land or sea (including ferries) have had to present documents denoting citizenship and identity. This change primarily affects American and Canadian citizens who have previously been permitted entry into the U.S. by oral declaration alone, and marks the transition toward standard and consistent documents for all travelers entering the U.S. Acceptable documentation includes a valid passport or government-issued photo identification such as a driver's license and proof of citizenship such as a birth certificate. Children aged 18 and under need only to present a birth certificate. A list of acceptable documents is found at http://canada.usembassy.gov. Travelers who do not present acceptable documents may be delayed as U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers at the port of entry attempt to verify identity and citizenship. Beginning in June 2009, all travelers, including U.S. citizens, will have to present a passport or other secure document that denotes identity and citizenship when entering the U.S. from Canada.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9618">'''Américo Paredes''' (September 3, 1915 – May 5, 1999) was a [[Mexican-American]] author born in [[Brownsville, Texas]] who authored several text focusing on the border life that existed between the United States and Mexico, particularly around the [[Rio Grande]] region of South Texas. His family on his father’s side, however, had been in the Americas since 1580.  His ancestors were ''[[sefardi]]tas'', or Spanish Jews who had been converted to Christianity, and in 1749 - along with [[Escandon]] - they settled in the lower Rio Grande.  The year of Paredes’ birth was the year of the last [[Texas Mexican Uprising]], which was to portend the life Paredes was to lead.  Throughout his long career as a journalist, folklorist and professor, Paredes was to bring focus to his Mexican American heritage, and the beauty of those traditions.  
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lib.utexas.edu/benson/paredes/bibliography.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==

Growing up in Brownsville, Texas, Paredes was to experience the double life of American and Mexican culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Dorson|Richard M. Dorson]], "Forward", Americo Paredes, ''Folktales of Mexico'', plv {{ISBN|0-226-64571-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Paredes was a lover both of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]’ [[Tarzan]] books and of Mexican poetry—his father composed ''[[décima]]s'' (a ten line poem with set rhyme scheme).  This love of poetry was to hold Paredes in good stead when, at the age of 18, he won a poetry contest sponsored by [[Trinity University (Texas)|Trinity College]].  This award was to gain him the attention of the high school principal, Mr. Irvine, who in turn, expedited his entrance into junior college in 1934. The same year Paredes entered college, an event that would mark his life occurred, the assassination of [[Cesar Augusto Sandino]], about whom, five years later, Paredes would write “A  Cesar Augusto Sandino.”

While in his second year of junior college, Paredes was also to write ''George Washington Gomez: A Mexico-Texan Novel''. Although it was not published until 1990, ''[[George Washington Gomez]]''&lt;ref&gt;({{ISBN|978-1-55885-012-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; is Paredes' most well known work. The novel tells the story of a young man growing up in early 20th-century Jonesville on the River (a fictional city Paredes used to represent the city of Brownsville) and reveals the conflict in identity (as the title name suggests) the young man experiences growing up in an Anglo-Texan environment, particularly with regards to the educational system.

While in college, Paredes worked not only at the local grocery store (where he bought his first guitar from a co-worker), but also as a proofreader and reporter at ''[[The Brownsville Herald]]'', a job he kept even after graduation in 1936. In 1940, as [[World War II]] began for the Americans, Paredes took a second job with [[Pan-American Airways]] overseeing the outfitting of airplanes with fifty-caliber machine guns.  Simultaneously, he began playing guitar on the radio, a talent he had taught himself during junior college. As World War II heated up, Paredes was drafted into the army, but even there he was a journalist, reporting for the army publication ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'', a publication which—while in Japan—allowed him to interview military leader [[Hideki Tōjō]]. Also in Japan, Paredes took correspondence courses from the [[University of Texas]], through an army school, affectionately referred to as the Tokyo College.  By 1950, Paredes had moved to Austin to pursue first his masters and then his Ph.D. When he returned to the United States, he brought with him his half-Japanese, half-[[Uruguay]]an wife Amelia Nagamine, whose visa issues almost stopped his education.  By 1951, Paredes was teaching as a graduate student at the University of Texas and drawing attention.  In 1952 he would win an award from the ''[[Dallas Times Herald]]'' for a collection of short stories he had selected from his larger work, ''The Hammon and The Beans''.  He called it ''Border Country''. In 1955, he won an award of 500 dollars for his novel ''The Shadow'', although this book would not be published until 1998.

In his graduate school years it would be a twist of fate that would lead Paredes down the road of [[folklore]].  While taking English courses during his masters, he encountered a test comparing two Scottish ballads, which Paredes was to compare to the Mexican [[corrido]] (a comparison that would crop up again in his dissertation of ''With His Pistol in His Hand''). His professor at the time introduced him to Robert Stephenson, then a professor of English teaching folklore, who would persuade him to pursue a future in the field.  In 1956, Paredes’ dissertation, which was to turn into his opus ''With His Pistol in His Hand'',&lt;ref&gt;({{ISBN|978-0-292-70128-1}})&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1958, told the story of the legendary [[Gregorio Cortez]] and his conflict with the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]]. The text portrayed the famed Texas Rangers in a negative fashion, which was unheard of in the history of that organization. There was a suggestion, jokingly perhaps, by some Texas Rangers that Paredes should be shot in retaliation for his blemishing of the reputation of the Texas Rangers in that book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dukeupress.typepad.com/dukeupresslog/2008/01/the-enduring-le.html The Enduring Legacy of Américo Paredes]&lt;/ref&gt; ''With His Pistol in His Hand'' was actually Paredes' dissertation and was published as a book by the [[University of Texas at Austin]].,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fpa94 Paredes, Americo]&lt;/ref&gt; garnered the attention of famous folklorist [[Stith Thompson]], who was to recommend the work to the [[University of Texas Press]] for publication (this project however would not reach publication until 1958). The book "sold less than 1000 copies by 1965, then exploded into dozens of editions as it became a foundational text and primer for the emerging academic movement of Chicano studies."&lt;ref&gt;Lamadrid, Enrique. 2018. Review of ''Border Folk Balladeers: Critical Studies on Américo Paredes''. http://www.jfr.indiana.edu/review.php?id=2287&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year ''With His Pistol in His Hand'' was published, Paredes was hired by [[University of Texas, Austin]] to teach, a decision which would change the face of their curriculum.  In the 1960s and 70’s Americo Paredes was to join the Chicano movement along with [[Tomás Rivera]] and [[Miguel Méndez]].  During this same period he would also expand the educational curriculum of UT by founding their [[Americo Paredes Center for Cultural Studies|Center for Folklore Studies]] (1967).  Paredes would continue on to found their [[Center for Mexican American Studies]] as well. In 1989 Paredes would become one of five men to be awarded the [[Charles Frankel Prize]] of the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] and in 1991 (the same year his high school and young adult poetry ''Between Two Worlds'' would publish) he received the [[Orden del Aguila Azteca]] along with [[Cesar Chavez]] and [[Julian Samora]].

In 1970, his ''Folktales of Mexico'' was published as part of the ''Folktales of the World'' series.

On May 5, 1999 Americo Paredes died in Austin, Texas.

Paredes has the distinction of being one of the few scholars "to ever have a [[corrido]]...composed in his honor".&lt;ref&gt;[http://biography.jrank.org/pages/3704/Paredes-Am-rico-1915-1999-Folklorist-Educator.html Americo Paredes 1915–1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''artist's portfolio''' is an edited collection of their best artwork intended to showcase an artist's style or method of work. A portfolio is used by artists to show employers their versatility by showing different samples of current work. Typically, the work reflects an artist's best work or a depth in one specific area of work.

Historically, portfolios were printed out and placed into a book. With the increased use of the internet and email, however, there are now websites that host [[online portfolio]]s that are available to a wider audience. Sometimes an artist's portfolio can be referred to as a [[lookbook]].

== Photography ==
A [[photography]] portfolio can focus on a single subject. It can be a collection of photographs taken with a certain type of camera, in one geographic area, of one person or a group of people, only black &amp; white or sepia photos, a special event, etc.

Many photographers use portfolios to show their best work when looking for jobs in the photography industry. For example, wedding photographers may put together a book of their best wedding photos to show to engaged couples who are looking for a wedding photographer. [[Photojournalists]] may take a collection of their best freelance work with them when looking for a job.

==Artist design book ==
An artist design book is a collection of photographs meant to show off a model, photographer, style, or clothing line.  Sometimes they are made to compile the looks of other people such as a celebrity, politician or socialite. This is an especially popular term with fashion bloggers.

Artist design books, or ADBs, in their online form, can be described as "fashion diaries" because bloggers are constantly updating them on a daily or weekly basis. 

It is common for stores or clothing designers to use an ADB to show off products.&lt;ref&gt;Fasanella, Kathleen. [http://www.fashion-incubator.com/archive/what_are_look_books/ "What are Look books?], ''Fashion-Incubator'', 2005-26-08. Retrieved on 2010-12-16.&lt;/ref&gt; They may include photos of multiple types of clothes, shoes and other accessories from a season or line.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5694">'''Barton Gulch'''{{coord|45|13|21|N|112|06|47|W|display=title|name=Barton Gulch, Montana}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite gnis|id=779392|name=Barton Gulch, Montana}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[archaeological site]] in southwest [[Montana]] that has provided very important information concerning some of the earliest residents of the [[Paleo-Indian]] period in the northwest [[United States]].

==Geography==

Barton Gulch is located in [[Madison County, Montana]] on a [[tributary]] of the [[Ruby River]] southwest of Indian Creek in the Greenhorn range,&lt;ref&gt;1. Beauchamp 2007, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; and is calculated to be as big as {{convert|827640|sqft|m2}}, or {{convert|19|acre|m2}}. Dr. Les Davis excavated Barton Gulch from 1987 through 1993, and found 37 features that were each arranged into four distinct aggregations. Each of these aggregations contains a central oxidized pit that is 30-centimeters deep and surrounds each basin.  A string of small features, representing a living floor site, form a circle around each oxidized basin.

==History==

Barton Gulch, also known as the Barton Gulch Alder Complex, was discovered in 1972 and first excavated in 1979. Barton Gulch is dated back to 9400 RCYBP (radio carbon years before the present),&lt;ref&gt;2. Beauchamp 2007, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; and was actually uncovered due to intensive, localized commercial mining projects in the late 1970s. Barton Gulch, along with the Alder site, are regarded as the [[type site]]s for the Blackwater Draw Paleo-Indian archaeological culture, and believed to be a Clovis culture. Most of the excavations of Barton Gulch were done by Dr. Les Davis, a professor at Montana State University, in the late 1980s and early 1990s. There has also been an intermediate amount of mining done at Barton Gulch for gold due to the presumption that the source of gold found in Barton Creek could have moved its way down the channel into the area.

==Climate==

During the late [[Pleistocene|Pleistocene period]], the climate began a dramatic change. It is unknown how and why exactly the climate changed, but scientists speculate that the Earth's orbit around the sun changed, leading to an evident increase in the amount of sunlight exposed to the planet.&lt;ref&gt;3. Thomas 2000, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; As the Pleistocene period gave way to the Paleo-Indian period, so did the harsh winter climates give way to a suitable warm climate. Strong evidence for the warm climate is the many warm-weather plants that have been found during excavations at Barton Gulch.

==Flora and fauna==

Barton Gulch included various animals that have rarely been seen in Paleo-Indian cultures. Such animals included the [[cottontail rabbit]] (Sylvilagus sp.), [[hare]] (Lepus sp.), [[mink]] (Mustela vison), [[porcupine]] (Orithizon dorsatum) and [[deer]] (Odocoileus sp.). The bones of the deer were used to make [[hammerstone]]s and other small tools. Small tools that were made from the bones of the animals include knives, [[flake tool]]s, [[Scraper (archaeology)|end scrapers]], abrading stones and points.&lt;ref&gt;4. Bruhns 1999, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Also, due to the warm weather, Barton Gulch contained many different [[Eating|edible]] plant species.  Identified at Barton Gulch were remains of charred seeds, stems, spines, and other elements from over thirty different plant species. These plans were recovered from a series of over one hundred cooking features. These discoveries suggest that the people of the area used plants for various purposes such as food, medicine, in ceremonies, tools and weapons.

==People==

The people of Barton Gulch are thought to have been seasonally semi [[nomad]]ic, meaning that although the people's living habits were largely nomadic, they do participate in planting crops at specific locations.&lt;ref&gt;5. Scarre 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Excavations suggest that the people were logistically organized, kin-related aggregates of [[hunter-gatherers]].&lt;ref&gt;6. Soffer 1993, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; Remains of earth ovens at Barton Gulch were identified as a possible technique of processing plants and animals into food. The presence of earth ovens and other cooking features implies that the people had detailed procedures for preparing plant and animal remains.&lt;ref&gt;7. Nelson 2006, p. 817&lt;/ref&gt; The identification of the many different tools from the animal bones suggests that there were many different activities being done by the men and women of Barton Gulch. The first known Barton Gulch female was called Laura of the ChunN clan.

{{see also|Beaumont and Fletcher}}
'''The Beaumont and Fletcher folios''' were two large [[book size|folio]] collections of the stage plays of [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]] and his collaborators. The first was issued in 1647, and the second in 1679. The two collections were important in preserving many works of [[English Renaissance theatre|English Renaissance drama]].

==The first folio, 1647==
The 1647 folio was published by the booksellers [[Humphrey Moseley]] and [[Humphrey Robinson]]. It was modelled on the precedents of the first two folio collections of [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)|Shakespeare's plays]], published in 1623 and 1632, and the first two folios of the [[Ben Jonson folios|works of Ben Jonson]] of 1616 and 1640–1. The title of the book was given as ''Comedies and Tragedies Written by Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher Gentlemen,'' though the prefatory matter in the folio recognised that [[Philip Massinger]], rather than [[Francis Beaumont]], collaborated with Fletcher on some of the plays included in the volume. (In fact, the 1647 volume "contained almost nothing of Beaumont's" work.)&lt;ref&gt;Lee Bliss, in Kinney, p. 524.&lt;/ref&gt; Seventeen works in Fletcher's canon that had already been published prior to 1647, and the rights to these plays belonged to the stationers who had issued those volumes; Robinson and Moseley therefore concentrated on the previously unpublished plays in the Fletcher canon.

Most of these plays had been acted onstage by the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]], the troupe of actors for whom Fletcher had functioned as house dramatist for most of his career. The folio featured a dedication to [[Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke]], signed by ten of the King's Men – [[John Lowin]], [[Joseph Taylor (17th-century actor)|Joseph Taylor]], [[Richard Robinson (17th-century actor)|Richard Robinson]], [[Robert Benfield]], [[Eliard Swanston]], Thomas Pollard, Hugh Clark, William Allen, [[Stephen Hammerton]], and [[Theophilus Bird]] – all idled by the closing of the theatres in 1642. It also contained two addresses to the reader, by [[James Shirley]] and by Moseley, and 37 [[commendatory poem]]s, long and short, by figures famous and obscure, including Shirley, [[Ben Jonson]],&lt;ref&gt;Jonson, a decade dead by 1647, was posthumously represented with an excerpt from his poem to Beaumont.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Lovelace]], [[Robert Herrick (poet)|Robert Herrick]], [[Richard Brome]], [[Jasper Mayne]], [[Thomas Stanley (author)|Thomas Stanley]], and Sir [[Aston Cockayne]].

The 1647 folio contains 35 works – 34 plays and 1 [[masque]].

The 1647 folio has attracted significant attention from scholars and bibliographers, and various specialised studies of the folio (books on the book) have been written.&lt;ref&gt;Logan and Smith, pp. 83–5.&lt;/ref&gt; As with Shakespeare's [[First Folio]], the typesetting of individual compositors and the work of individual printers has been traced and analysed – including that of Susan Islip, one of the rare instances of a female printer in the 17th century.

==The second folio, 1679==
The second folio, titled ''Fifty Comedies and Tragedies,'' was published by the booksellers [[Henry Herringman]],&lt;ref&gt;Herringman was a member of the syndicates of stationers who issued the [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)|Fourth Folio]] of Shakespeare's plays in 1685, and the [[Ben Jonson folios|third Ben Jonson folio]] in 1692.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Martyn (publisher)|John Martyn]], and [[John and Richard Marriot|Richard Marriot]]; the printing was done by J. Macock. The three stationers had obtained the rights to previously-published works,&lt;ref&gt;The 17 printed before 1647, and ''[[The Wild Goose Chase]],'' which had been published in 1652.&lt;/ref&gt; and added 18 dramas to the 35 of the first folio, for a total of 53. The second folio added features that the first lacked. Many songs in the plays were given in full. Cast lists were prefixed to 25 of the dramas, lists that provide the names of the leading actors in the original productions of the plays. These lists can be informative on the companies involved and the dates of first productions; the cast list prefixed to ''[[The Honest Man's Fortune]],'' for example, reveals that the play was originally staged by the [[Lady Elizabeth's Men]] in the 1612–13 period.

On the negative side, the texts in the second folio were set into type from the previously-printed quarto texts, and never from manuscript; the texts of the plays in the first collection were printed from manuscript sources.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content, authorship, and canon==

The implicit canon, nearly realized by the contents of the second folio, comprises dramatic works written by Beaumont or Fletcher; either alone, together, or in collaboration with other playwrights. By this rule, likely, four plays should be excluded (''The Laws of Candy'' by [[John Ford (dramatist)|John Ford]], ''Wit at Several Weapons'' by [[Thomas Middleton|Middleton]] and [[William Rowley|Rowley]], ''The Nice Valour'' by Middleton, and ''The Coronation'' by [[James Shirley]]), and three more extant plays should be included (''Barnavelt'', ''A Very Woman'', and ''Henry VIII''). ''[[A Very Woman]]'' was printed in a volume of Massinger's plays in 1655, while ''[[Sir John van Olden Barnavelt]]'' remained in manuscript until the 19th century. ''Henry VIII'' was first published in the Shakespeare [[First Folio]] of 1623.

At least five plays, no longer extant, may also belong in the canon. Four of these were entered to Moseley in the [[Stationers' Register]] between 1653 and 1660, possibly with the intent of printing them in the second folio: ''[[The History of Cardenio|Cardenio]]'' (Shakespeare and Fletcher?), ''A Right Woman'' (Beaumont and Fletcher?), ''The Wandering Lovers'' (Fletcher?), and ''The Jeweler of Amsterdam'' (Fletcher, Field, and Massinger?). A fifth non-extant play, ''The Queen'' was questionably attributed to Fletcher by a contemporary.&lt;ref&gt;Bowers 1966, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_pBDWgpg_AwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR31#v=onepage&amp;f=false p xxxi].&lt;/ref&gt;

The folios contain two works that are generally thought to be the work of Beaumont alone – ''The Knight of the Burning Pestle'' and ''The Masque of the Inner Temple and Gray's Inn'' – and fifteen that are solo efforts by Fletcher, and perhaps a dozen that are actual Beaumont/Fletcher collaborations. The rest are Fletcher's collaborations with Massinger and other writers.

==Later editions==
The folios limited but did not extinguish the market for individual editions of the plays; such editions were printed when the chances for profit seemed favourable. Humphrey Robinson and Alice Moseley (Humphrey Moseley's widow) issued a quarto of ''Beggar's Bush'' in 1661, for example. During the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] era and into the 18th century, the plays in the Beaumont/Fletcher canon were very popular – though they were often performed in adapted versions rather than in the originals; and the adaptations then appeared in print. An adaptation of ''The Island Princess'' was published in 1669; and adapted version of ''Monsieur Thomas'' was printed in 1678.  ''Beggar's Bush'' became ''The Royal Merchant,'' published in 1706 – and later, ''The Merchant of Bruges.''&lt;ref&gt;Potter, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; This trend in favour of new adaptations over original versions made it easier for Herringman, Martyn, and Mariot to obtain permissions to reprint those originals in their 1679 collection.

[[Image:Casey at the bat.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Tim Wiles, Director of Research at the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] Library in [[Cooperstown]], frequently dresses as Casey to recite the poem.]]
"'''Casey at the Bat: A Ballad of the Republic Sung in the Year 1888'''" is a [[baseball]] poem written in 1888 by [[Ernest Thayer]]. First published in ''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]'' (then called ''The Daily Examiner'') on June 3, 1888, it was later popularized by [[DeWolf Hopper]] in many [[vaudeville]] performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Casey at the Bat|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/poetry/po_case.shtml|website=Baseball Almanac}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=catbird&gt;{{cite web|last1=Armenti|first1=Peter|title=The First Publication of "Casey at the Bat"|url=http://blogs.loc.gov/catbird/2013/06/the-first-publication-of-casey-at-the-bat/|website=From the Catbird Seat|publisher=Library of Congress|date=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has become one of the best-known poems in [[American literature]].  The poem was originally published anonymously (under the [[pen name]] "Phin", based on Thayer's college nickname, "Phinney").&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt;

==Synopsis==
A baseball team from the fictional town of "Mudville" (implied to be the home team) is losing by two [[Run (baseball)|runs]] in its last inning. Both the team and its fans, a crowd of 5,000, believe they can win if Casey, Mudville's star player, gets to bat. However, Casey is scheduled to be the fifth batter of the inning, and the first two batters (Cooney and Barrows) fail to get on base. The next two batters (Flynn and Jimmy Blake) are perceived to be weak hitters with little chance of reaching base to allow Casey a chance to bat.

Surprisingly, Flynn hits a single, and Blake follows with a double that allows Flynn to reach third base.  Both runners are now in scoring position and Casey represents the potential winning run. Casey is so sure of his abilities that he does not swing at the first two pitches, both called strikes. On the last pitch, the overconfident Casey [[Strikeout|strikes out swinging]], ending the game and sending the crowd home unhappy.

==Text==
{{Listen
 |filename=CaseyAtTheBat.ogg
 |title=Casey at the Bat
 |description=Recited by [[DeWolf Hopper]], c. 1920.
 |format=[[Ogg]] }}
The text is filled with references to baseball as it was in 1888, which in many ways is not far removed from today's version. As a work, the poem encapsulates much of the appeal of baseball, including the involvement of the crowd. It also has a fair amount of baseball jargon that can pose challenges for the uninitiated.

This is the complete poem as it originally appeared in ''[[The San Francisco Examiner|The Daily Examiner]]''.  After publication, various versions with minor changes were produced.

|quote=No one imagines that 'Casey' is great in the sense that the poetry of [[Shakespeare]] or [[Dante]] is great; a comic [[ballad]] obviously must be judged by different standards. One doesn’t criticize a slice of superb apple pie because it fails to taste like [[Crepe Suzette|crepes suzette]]. Thayer was only trying to write a comic ballad, with clanking rhymes and a vigorous beat, that could be read quickly, understood at once, and laughed at by any newspaper reader who knew baseball. Somehow, in harmony with the curious laws of humor and popular taste, he managed to produce the [[United States|nation]]'s best-known piece of [[comic verse]]—a ballad that began a native [[legend]] as colorful and permanent as that of [[Johnny Appleseed]] or [[Paul Bunyan]].|author=Martin Gardner|source=[[American Heritage (magazine)|''American Heritage'']]&lt;ref name=Gardner&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gardner|first=Martin|title=Casey At The Bat|journal=American Heritage|date=October 1967|volume=18|issue=6|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/casey-bat|accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
The outlook wasn't brilliant for the Mudville nine that day;
the score stood four to two, with but one inning more to play.
And then when Cooney died at first, and Barrows did the same,
a sickly silence fell upon the patrons of the game.

A straggling few got up to go in deep despair. The rest
clung to that hope which springs eternal in the human breast;
they thought, if only Casey could get but a whack at that –
they'd put up even money, now, with Casey at the bat.

But Flynn preceded Casey, as did also Jimmy Blake,
and the former was a lulu and the latter was a cake,
so upon that stricken multitude grim melancholy sat,
for there seemed but little chance of Casey's getting to the bat.

But Flynn let drive a single, to the wonderment of all,
and Blake, the much despised, tore the cover off the ball;
and when the dust had lifted, and the men saw what had occurred,
there was Jimmy safe at second and Flynn a-hugging third.

Then from five thousand throats and more there rose a lusty yell;
it rumbled through the valley, it rattled in the dell;
it knocked upon the mountain and recoiled upon the flat,
for Casey, mighty Casey, was advancing to the bat.

There was ease in Casey's manner as he stepped into his place;
there was pride in Casey's bearing and a smile on Casey's face.
And when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat,
no stranger in the crowd could doubt 'twas Casey at the bat.

Ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt;
five thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt.
Then while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip,
defiance gleamed in Casey's eye, a sneer curled Casey's lip.

And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air,
and Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there.
Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped—
"That ain't my style," said Casey. "Strike one," the umpire said.

From the benches, black with people, there went up a muffled roar,
like the beating of the storm-waves on a stern and distant shore.
"Kill him! Kill the umpire!" shouted someone on the stand;
and it's likely they'd have killed him had not Casey raised his hand.

With a smile of Christian charity great Casey's visage shone;
he stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on;
he signaled to the pitcher, and once more the spheroid flew;
but Casey still ignored it, and the umpire said: "Strike two."

"Fraud!" cried the maddened thousands, and Echo answered fraud;
but one scornful look from Casey and the audience was awed.
They saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain,
and they knew that Casey wouldn't let that ball go by again.

The sneer is gone from Casey's lip, his teeth are clenched in hate;
he pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate.
And now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go,
and now the air is shattered by the force of Casey's blow.

Oh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright;
the band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light,
and somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout;
but there is no joy in Mudville — mighty Casey has struck out.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

==Inspiration==
Thayer said he chose the name "Casey" after a non-player of Irish ancestry he once knew, and it is open to debate who, if anyone, he modeled the character after. It has been reported that Thayer's best friend [[Samuel Winslow]], who played baseball at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], was the inspiration for Casey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Casey at the Bat|url=http://www.joslinhall.com/casey_at_the_bat.htm|accessdate=June 3, 2017|publisher=Joslin Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=Martin|title=Casey At The Bat|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/casey-bat|accessdate=June 3, 2017|work=American Heritage|date=October 1967 |volume=18|issue=6|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Canale|first1=Larry|title=Casey Might Have Struck Out, But Related Memorabilia Does Not|url=http://www.sportscollectorsdigest.com/mudville-still-no-joy/|accessdate=June 3, 2017|work=Sports Collectors Digest|date=November 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another candidate is National League player [[King Kelly|Mike "King" Kelly]], who became famous when Boston paid Chicago a record $10,000 for him. He had a personality that fans liked to cheer or jeer. After the 1887 season, Kelly went on a playing tour to San Francisco. Thayer, who wrote "Casey" in 1888, covered the San Francisco leg for the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]''.

Thayer, in a letter he wrote in 1905, mentions Kelly as showing "impudence" in claiming to have written the poem. The author of the 2004 definitive bio of Kelly—which included a close tracking of his vaudeville career—did not find Kelly claiming to have been the author.&lt;ref name=rosenberg&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|first=Howard W.|title= Cap Anson 2: The Theatrical and Kingly Mike Kelly: U.S. Team Sport's First Media Sensation and Baseball's Original Casey at the Bat|publisher=Tile Books|year=2004|isbn=0-9725574-1-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|rosenberg|page1=9}}

Aside from omitting the first five verses, the only changes from the original are substitutions of Kelly for Casey, and [[Boston]] for Mudville.&lt;ref name=moore&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moore|first1=Jim|last2=Vermilyea|first2=Natalie|title=Ernest Thayer's "Casey at the bat" : background and characters of baseball's most famous poem|date=1994|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=9780899509976|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[King Kelly]], then of the [[History of the Boston Braves|Boston Beaneaters]], was one of baseball's two biggest stars at the time (along with [[Cap Anson]]).{{r|rosenberg|page1=9}}

In 1897, the magazine ''[[Current Literature]]'' noted the two versions and said, "The locality, as originally given, is Mudville, not Boston; the latter was substituted to give the poem local color."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Casey at the Bat|journal=Current Literature|date=February 1897|volume=21|issue=2|page=129|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951000902843q;view=1up;seq=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-publication version==
Sportswriter [[Leonard Koppett]] claimed in a 1979 article that the published poem omits 18 lines penned by Thayer which change the entire theme of the poem. Koppett said the full version of the poem takes the pitch count on Casey to full as his uncle Arnold stirs up wagering action in the stands before a wink passes between them and Casey throws the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Koppett|first1=Leonard|title=Casey at Bat?

==Live performances==
[[Image:Dewolfhopper1.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.1|1909 theatrical poster with DeWolf Hopper in A Matinee Idol]]
[[DeWolf Hopper]] gave the poem's first stage [[recitation]] on August 14, 1888, at [[New York City|New York's]] [[Wallack Theatre]] as part of the [[comic opera]] ''[[Prinz Methusalem]]'' in the presence of the Chicago and New York baseball teams, the [[Chicago Cubs|White Stockings]] and the [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]], respectively; August 14, 1888 was also Thayer's 25th birthday. Hopper became known as an orator of the poem, and recited it more than 10,000 times (by his count—some tabulations are as much as four times higher) before his death.&lt;ref name=Gardner /&gt;
{{Quote_box

On stage in the early 1890s, baseball star Kelly recited the original "Casey" a few dozen times and not the parody. For example, in a review in 1893 of a variety show he was in, the ''Indianapolis News'' said, "Many who attended the performance had heard of Kelly's singing and his reciting, and many had heard De Wolf Hopper recite 'Casey at the Bat' in his inimitable way. Kelly recited this in a sing-song, school-boy fashion."  Upon Kelly's death, a writer would say he gained "considerable notoriety by his ludicrous rendition of 'Casey at the Bat,' with which he concluded his `turn’ [act] at each performance."{{r|rosenberg|page1=229}}

During the 1980s, the magic/comedy team [[Penn &amp; Teller]] performed a version of "Casey at the Bat" with Teller (the "silent" partner) struggling to escape a [[straitjacket]] while suspended upside-down over a platform of sharp steel spikes. The set-up was that [[Penn Jillette]] would leap off his chair upon finishing the poem, releasing the rope which supported Teller, and send his partner to a gruesome death if he wasn't free by that time.  The drama of the performance was taken up a notch after the third or fourth stanza, when Penn Jillette began to read out the rest of the poem much faster than the opening stanzas, greatly reducing the time that Teller had left to work free from his bonds.

On July 4, 2008, Jack Williams recited the poem accompanied by the [[Boston Pops]] during the annual Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular at Boston's 4 July Celebration.

On July 14, 2013, the jam rock band [[Furthur (band)|Furthur]] performed the poem as part of a second-set medley in center field of Doubleday Field in Cooperstown, New York.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/furthur2013-07-14.AKGc1000s&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded version of "Casey at the Bat" was made by [[Russell Hunting]], speaking in a broad Irish accent, in 1893; an [http://cylinders.library.ucsb.edu/search.php?queryType=@attr+1=1020&amp;num=1&amp;start=1&amp;query=cylinder5348 1898 cylinder recording of the text made for the Columbia Graphophone label by Hunting] can be accessed from the [[Cylinder Preservation and Digitization Project]] at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] Library.

[[DeWolf Hopper]]'s more famous recorded recitation was released in October 1906.

In 1946, [[Walt Disney]] released a recording of the narration of the poem by [[Jerry Colonna (entertainer)|Jerry Colonna]], which accompanied the studio's [[animated cartoon]] adaptation of the poem (see below).

In 1973, the [[Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra]] commissioned its former Composer-in-Residence, [[Frank Proto]], to create a work to feature Baseball Hall-of-Famer [[Johnny Bench]] with the orchestra. The result "Casey At The Bat – an American Folk Tale for Narrator and Orchestra" was an immediate hit and recorded by Bench and the orchestra. It has since been performed more than 800 times by nearly every major and Metropolitan orchestra in the U.S. and Canada.

In 1980, baseball pitcher [[Tug McGraw]] recorded ''Casey at The Bat—an American Folk Tale for Narrator and Orchestra'' by [[Frank Proto]] with [[Peter Nero]] and the [[Philly Pops]].

In 1996, actor [[James Earl Jones]] recorded the poem with Arranger/Composer [[Steven Reineke]] and the [[Cincinnati Pops Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Casey At The Bat|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-2lXQQcXb8|work=Casey at the Bat – James Earl Jones|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1998 CD: Play Ball!  – Erich Kunzel – Cincinnati Pops Orchestra, Recorded 1996 with Arranger/Composer Steven Reineke and the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra (insert credits) – https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000064U5&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Dave Jageler]] and [[Charlie Slowes]], both radio announcers for the [[Washington Nationals]], each made recordings of the poem for the [[Library of Congress]] to mark the 125th anniversary of its first publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Osterberg|first1=Gayle|title=A Special Recording to Celebrate Casey's 125th|url=http://blogs.loc.gov/loc/2013/06/a-special-recording-to-celebrate-caseys-125th/|website=Library of Congress Blog|date=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mudville==
A rivalry of sorts has developed between two cities claiming to be the Mudville described in the poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zezima|first1=Katie|title=Mudville Journal; In 'Casey' Rhubarb, 2 Cities Cry 'Foul!'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/31/us/mudville-journal-in-casey-rhubarb-2-cities-cry-foul.html|work=New York Times|date=31 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Holliston-mudville-casey-statue.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Holliston, Massachusetts – Mudville Village, Statue and Plaque Dedicated to "Casey" of "Casey at the Bat"]][[Image:Holliston-mudville-welcome-sign.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Holliston, Massachusetts – Mudville Village, Welcome Sign]]
Residents of [[Holliston, Massachusetts]], where there is a neighborhood called Mudville, claim it as the Mudville described in the poem. Thayer grew up in nearby [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], where he wrote the poem in 1888; his family owned a wool mill less than a mile from Mudville's baseball field.

However, residents of [[Stockton, California]]—which was known for a time as Mudville prior to incorporation in 1850—also lay claim to being the inspiration for the poem. In 1887, Thayer covered baseball for ''[[The San Francisco Examiner|The Daily Examiner]]''—owned by his Harvard classmate [[William Randolph Hearst]]—and is said to have covered the local [[California League]] team, the [[Stockton Ports]]. For the [[1902 in baseball|1902]] season, after the poem became popular, Stockton's team was renamed the Mudville Nine. The team reverted to the Mudville Nine moniker for the 2000 and 2001 seasons. The [[Visalia Rawhide]], another California League team, currently keep Mudville alive by playing in Mudville jerseys on June&amp;nbsp;3 each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stockton Mudville Nine|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Stockton_Mudville_Nine|website=Baseball Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the towns' rival claims, Thayer himself told the ''[[Syracuse Post-Standard]]'' that "the poem has no basis in fact."&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt;

==Adaptations==

The poem has been [[Literary adaptation|adapted]] to diverse types of media:

===Books===
*Ralph Andreano's 1965 book, ''No Joy in Mudville'', laments the death of heroes in modern baseball.
*In the book ''Faithful'' by Steward O'Nan and Stephen King, describing the 2004 season of the Boston Red Sox, a chapter contributed by King is named "The Gloom is gone from Mudville".
*[[Wallace Tripp]] illustrated a popular 1978 book of the poem.
*[[Kurtis Scaletta]]'s 2009 children's novel, ''Mudville'', is about a town where it has been raining for 22 years, delaying a baseball game between two rival towns.
*Christopher Bing's 2000 children's book, an illustrated version of the original poem by Thayer, won a Caldecott Honor for its line drawing illustrations made to look like newspaper articles from 1888.

===Comics===
*Marvel Comics published a spoof in August 1969, in the 9th issue of "Not Brand Echh", featuring parodies of their popular heroes and villains, and the Bulk (parody of the Hulk) as Casey.
*DC Comics' series Fables from the Vertigo imprint featured an adaptation titled "Out to the Ball Game", which features a similar baseball match, with Weyland Smith playing the part of Casey against a team of goblins.

===Film===
* In 1922, [[Lee De Forest]] recorded [[DeWolf Hopper]] reciting the poem in DeForest's [[Phonofilm]] sound-on-film process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Progressive Silent Film List: Casey at the Bat|url=http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/C/CaseyAtTheBat1922.html|website=Silent Era}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1927, a feature-length [[silent film]] ''[[Casey at the Bat (1927 film)|Casey at the Bat]]'' was released, starring [[Wallace Beery]], [[Ford Sterling]], and [[ZaSu Pitts]]—the first film adaptation of the poem.
*[[Walt Disney]] produced an [[animated short]] adaptation of the poem for the film ''[[Make Mine Music]]'' (1946) and uses the original text, but is set in 1902 according to the opening song's lyrics, instead of 1888. This version is recited by [[Jerry Colonna (entertainer)|Jerry Colonna]]. It was later released as an individual short on July 16, 1954. Several differences from the original text include, but are not limited to; Barrows failing to get off base when he smacks the ball back into the pitcher's mitt, Flynn letting drive a single due to trying to get the bat out of his moustache and Blake getting a double due to an attempt by the visiting team's catcher to set his foot on fire.
* The poem is cited in Frederic Wiseman's documentary ''[[High school (North America)|High School]]'' (1968) by a teacher in a classroom.
*In 1986, [[Elliott Gould]] starred as "Casey" in the ''[[Shelley Duvall]]'s Tall Tales and Legends'' adaptation of the story, which also starred [[Carol Kane]], [[Howard Cosell]], [[Bob Uecker]], [[Bill Macy]] and [[Rae Dawn Chong]]. The screenplay, adapted from the poem, was written by [[Andy Borowitz]] and the production was directed by [[David Steinberg]].

==Derivations==
For a relatively short poem apparently dashed off quickly (and denied by its author for years), "Casey at the Bat" had a profound effect on American popular culture. It has been [[Casey at the Bat#Live performances|recited]], re-enacted, [[Casey at the Bat#Other versions|adapted]], dissected, parodied and subjected to just about every other treatment one could imagine.&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt;

===Sequels===
"Casey's Revenge", by [[Grantland Rice]] (1907), gives Casey another chance against the pitcher who had struck him out in the original story. It was written in 1906, and its first known publication was in the quarterly magazine ''The Speaker'' in June 1907, under the pseudonym of James Wilson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gardner|first=Martin|title=The Annotated Casey at the Bat: A Collection of Ballads About the Mighty Casey|year=1995|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=0-486-28598-7|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this version, Rice cites the nickname "Strike-Out Casey", hence the influence on [[Casey Stengel]]'s name. Casey's team is down ''three'' runs by the last of the ninth, and once again Casey is down to two strikes—with the bases full this time. However, he connects, hits the ball so far that it is never found.

*In response to the popularity of the 1946 Walt Disney animated adaptation, Disney made a sequel, ''Casey Bats Again'' (1954), in which Casey's nine daughters redeem his reputation.
*In 1988, on the 100th anniversary of the poem, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' writer [[Frank Deford]] constructed a fanciful story (later expanded to book form) which posited Katie Casey, the subject of the song "[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]", as being the daughter of the famous slugger from the poem.
*In 2010, Ken Eagle wrote "The Mudville Faithful", covering a century of the Mudville nine's fortunes since Casey struck out. Faithful fans still root for the perpetually losing team, and are finally rewarded by a trip to the World Series, led by Casey's great-grandson who is also named Casey.

===Parodies===
Of the many [[parody|parodies]] made of the poem, some of the notable ones include:
*''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine republished the original version of the poem in the 1950s with artwork by [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]] and no alterations to the text. Later lampoons in ''Mad'' included "'Cool' Casey at the Bat" (1960), an interpretation of the poem in [[beatnik]] style, with artwork by [[Don Martin (cartoonist)|Don Martin]]; "Casey at the Dice" in 1969, about a professional gambler; "Casey at the Talks" in 1977, a "modern" version of the famed poem in which Mudville tries unsuccessfully to sign free agent Casey[the last line of which is "Mighty Casey has held out"]; "Baseball at the Bat", a satire on baseball itself, "Howard at the Mike", about [[Howard Stern]]; "Casey at the Byte" (1985), a tale of a cocky young computer expert who accidentally erases the White House Budget Plan; "Clooney as the Bat", a mockery of [[George Clooney]]'s role as [[Batman]] in ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman and Robin]]''; and in 2006 as "Barry at the Bat", poking fun at [[Barry Bonds]]' alleged involvement in the [[BALCO]] scandal, and in 2001, "Jordan at the Hoop", satirizing [[Michael Jordan]]'s return to the NBA and his time with the [[Washington Wizards]]. A "Poetry Round Robin" where famous poems are rewritten in the style of the next poet in line, featured Casey at the Bat as written by [[Edgar Allan Poe]].
*[[Foster Brooks]] ("the Lovable Lush") wrote "Riley on the Mound", which recounts the story from the pitcher's perspective.

*Radio performer [[Garrison Keillor]]'s parodic version of the poem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keillor|first1=Garrison|title=Casey at the Bat (Road Game)|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/poetry/po_case7.shtml|website=Baseball Almanac}}&lt;/ref&gt; reimagines the game as a road game, instead of a home game, for the Mudville team. The same events occur with Casey striking out in the ninth inning as in the original poem, but with everything told from the perspective of other team.
*An episode of ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' featured a short titled "Buster at the Bat", where [[Sylvester (Looney Tunes)|Sylvester]] provides narration as Buster goes up to bat. The poem was parodied again for an episode of ''[[Animaniacs]]'', this time with [[Yakko, Wakko, and Dot|Wakko]] as the title character and Yakko narrating. 
*In ''[[The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius]]'' episode "Return of the Nanobots", Cindy's poem is identical to the ending of "Casey at the Bat" but replaces Mudville with Retroville and the last famed line with "cause Jimmy is an idiot!"
*[[The New York Times]] published a parody by Hart Seely and Frank Cammuso in which the poem was narrated by [[Phil Rizzuto]], a [[New York Yankees]] announcer who was known to veer off on tangents while calling the game. The poem was later published in Seely and Cammuso's book, ''2007 Eleven And Other American Comedies''.
*[[David Pogue]] penned a parody version titled 'A Desktop Critic: Steven Saves the Mac' for [[Macworld]] magazine that ran in their October 1999 issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pogue|first1=David|title=The Desktop Critic: Steven Saves the Mac|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/15358/1999/10/desktopcritic.html|work=Macworld|date=October 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; It tells the story of [[Steve Jobs]]' triumphant return to a struggling [[Apple Inc]] and his early efforts to reverse the company's fortunes.
*[[Dick Flavin (poet)|Dick Flavin]] wrote a version titled Teddy at the Bat, after [[Boston Red Sox]] legend [[Ted Williams]] died in July, 2002. Flavin performed the poem at [[Fenway Park]] during the night-long tribute to Williams done at the park later that month. The poem replaced Flynn and Blake with [[Bobby Doerr]] and [[Johnny Pesky]], the batters who preceded Williams in the 1946 Red Sox lineup.
*In 2000, Michael J. Farrand adapted the [[rhyming scheme]], tone, and [[Literary theme|theme]] of the poem—while reversing the outcome—to create his poem "The Man Who Gave All the Dreamers in Baseball Land Bigger Dreams to Dream" about [[Kirk Gibson's 1988 World Series home run|Kirk Gibson's home run]] off [[Dennis Eckersley]] in Game 1 of the 1988 [[World Series]].  The poem appears at the [[Baseball Almanac]].
*Norman Jackman wrote a reversed-outcome version in 1951 called "Bobby Thomson at the Bat," which went unknown for over 60 years until the [[San Francisco Giants]] published it in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sfgiantsphotos.mlblogs.com/bobby-thomson-at-the-bat-54859b06e729|title=Bobby Thomson at the Bat|last=MLB.com/blogs|first=|date=2 February 2012|website=SF Giants Photos|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's about [[Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball)|Thomson’s famous home run]] in a 1951 Giant-Dodger playoff game.  In 2016, the poem was accepted into the poetry files of the National Baseball Library and Archive of the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]].
*[[The New York Times]] best-selling author and poet laureate of The Ringer, [[Shea Serrano]], penned a loving tribute to [[NBA]] player [[Gordon Hayward]] in the vein of "Casey at the Bat" in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://theringer.com/gordon-hayward-utah-jazz-poem-nbshea-ea66d15584be&lt;/ref&gt;
*Canadian comedy duo [[Wayne and Shuster]] created "Shakespearean Baseball", featuring [[William Shakespeare]]-esque characters and dialogue in a skit based upon the poem. They performed the play on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' and on Canadian TV numerous times between the 1950s and 1980s.

===Translations===
There are three known translations of the poem into a foreign language, one in French, written in 2007 by French Canadian linguist Paul Laurendeau, with the title ''Casey au bâton'', and two in Hebrew. One by the sports journalist Menachem Less titled "התור של קייסי לחבוט" [Hator Shel Casey Lachbot],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hoops.co.il/index.asp?page=ViewEL&amp;id=98|בלאדת הספורט הגדולה מכולן!] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080711103818/http://www.hoops.co.il/index.asp?page=ViewEL&amp;id=98 |date=July 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the other more recent and more true to the original cadence and style by Jason H. Elbaum called קֵיסִי בַּמַּחְבֵּט [Casey BaMachbayt].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elbaum|first1=Jason H.|title=Casey at the Bat in Hebrew|url=http://caseyatthebatinhebrew.blogspot.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Names===
[[Casey Stengel]] describes in his autobiography how his original nickname "K.C." (for his hometown, [[Kansas City, Missouri]]) evolved into "Casey". It was influenced not just by the name of the poem, which was widely popular in the 1910s, but also because he tended to strike out frequently in his early career so fans and writers started calling him "strikeout Casey".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stengel|first1=Casey|last2=Paxton|first2=Harry T.|title=Casey at the Bat: The Story of My Life in Baseball|date=1962|publisher=Random House|location=New York|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary culture==

===Games===
The poem is referenced in the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] game ''[[EarthBound]]'', where a weapon is named the Casey Bat, which is the strongest weapon in the game, but will only hit 25% of the time.

===Television===
A one-time character in the ''[[Pokémon (anime)|Pokémon]]'' anime, a girl who is a very enthusiastic fan of baseball, is named "Casey" in the English version in reference to the poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Casey_(anime)|title=Casey (anime)|website=Bulbapedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A baseball-themed episode of [[The Twilight Zone]] was named [[The Mighty Casey]] in reference to the poem's lead character, though the plot is unrelated.

In the show [[Friends]], Ross clarifies how to spell "Casey" as in "at the bat" in the Season 2, episode 14 entitled "The One with the Prom Video."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://friends.tktv.net/Episodes2/summaries/14.html|title=Transcript of The One with the Prom Video|website=friends.tktv.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the show [[Containment]], Season 1, episode 6 takes its name, “He Stilled the Rising Tumult”, from the poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containment_(TV_series)|title=Containment (TV Series)}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=June 2018}}

===Theme parks===

'''[[Malaysian language|Malaysian]]''' and '''[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]''' are two standardised registers of the [[Malay language]], used in [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]], respectively. Both varieties are generally [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]], yet there are significant differences in spelling, grammar, pronunciation and vocabulary, as well as the predominant source of loanwords.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=OtWdhQ7vc6kC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=Indonesian+Malaysian+Malay+differences&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjcw-_JzqTZAhWGq48KHeY4Cw0Q6AEIRjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Indonesian%20Malaysian%20Malay%20differences&amp;f=false|title=The Austronesian Languages of Asia and Madagascar|last=Adelaar|first=K.

==Perception==
To non-native speakers the two varieties may seem identical, but to native speakers the differences are noticeable through both diction and accent. They affect the broadcasting industry with regard to foreign language subtitling, for example, in DVD movies and on cable TV. In order to reach a wider audience, both Indonesian and Malay subtitles are sometimes displayed in a movie, along with other language subtitles. Another example is Malaysian TV providing Malay subtitling on Indonesian [[sinetron]]s (TV dramas) aired in Malaysia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://myindo.com/story/278.asp |title=The Wonderful World of Subtitling |author=Fairy Mahzan |date= |work= |publisher=MyIndo.com |accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lifestyle.sindonews.com/read/1247171/158/hore-mnctv-tayangkan-film-terbaru-upin-ipin-1507640031|title=Hore, MNCTV Tayangkan Film Terbaru Upin Ipin|work=SINDOnews.com|access-date=2018-02-14|language=id-ID}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brunei, where Malay is also an official language, the language is known as ''Bahasa Melayu'' and in English as "Malay".&lt;ref&gt;[http://bruneitimes.com.bn/art-culture/2010/08/04/perambahan-unique-feature-brunei-malay Perambahan: A unique feature of Brunei Malay], ''[[Brunei Times]]'', 4 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indonesia, however, there is a clear distinction between "Malay language" (''bahasa Melayu'') and "Indonesian" (''bahasa Indonesia''). Indonesian is the national language which serves as the [[Lingua franca|unifying language]] of Indonesia; despite being a standardized form of Malay, it is not referred to with the term "Malay" in common parlance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=KafIAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=Indonesian+language+lingua+franca&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjW4ej41aTZAhXLPI8KHSaXAF4Q6AEIRTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Indonesian%20language%20lingua%20franca&amp;f=false|title=Language and Language-in-Education Planning in the Pacific Basin|last=Kaplan|first=R.

Thus, "Malay" is considered a [[regional language]] (''bahasa daerah'') in Indonesia, enjoying the same status as e.g. [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]], [[Buginese language|Buginese]], [[Balinese language|Balinese]],  [[Batak languages]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.co.id/search?hl=en&amp;tbm=bks&amp;ei=csmDWv3dKIv8vAS6ooLQBQ&amp;q=malay+regional+language+indonesia&amp;oq=malay+regional+language+indonesia&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...4388.5995.0.6128.10.9.0.0.0.0.279.873.0j4j1.5.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..5.0.0....0.Xknm0iUooJ0|title=malay regional language indonesia - Google Search|website=www.google.co.id|language=en|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, to some Indonesians, the term "Malay" is more often associated with Malaysia and the Malaysian variety of Malay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=cA1PilUrW8gC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=definisi+melayu&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwl6bi1qTZAhUGTo8KHTYfB9EQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=definisi%20melayu&amp;f=false|title=PELBBA 17: Pertemuan Linguistik Pusat Kajian Bahasa dan Budaya Atma Jaya Ketujuh Belas|date=2004|publisher=Yayasan Obor Indonesia|isbn=9789794615270|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In Malaysia, the terms "Indonesian Malay" and "Malaysian Malay" are sometimes used for Indonesian and Malaysian as spoken in Malaysia. In Indonesia, "Indonesian Malay" usually refers to the vernacular varieties of Malay spoken by the [[Malay Indonesian|Malay peoples of Indonesia]], that is, to Malay as a regional language in [[Sumatra]], though it is rarely used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=wiWguZzOToMC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=bahasa+melayu+indonesia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwilpYqM16TZAhXJO48KHSptCnQQ6AEIRTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=bahasa%20melayu%20indonesia&amp;f=false|title=Masyarakat Indonesia|last=Indonesia|first=Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan|publisher=Yayasan Obor Indonesia|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bahasa Malaysia'' and ''Bahasa Melayu'' are used interchangeably in reference to Malay in Malaysia.

==Orthography==

Before the 20th century, Malay was written in a local modified form of the [[Arabic alphabet]] known as [[Jawi script|Jawi]]. During the 20th century, Malay written with [[Roman letters]], known as Rumi, almost completely replaced Jawi in everyday life. The romanisations originally used in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] (now part of [[Malaysia]]) and the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]) reflected their past history as British and Dutch colonial possessions respectively. In Malaya, the romanisation of Malay, devised by [[Richard James Wilkinson|Richard Wilkinson]]&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JHgsfADZF9IC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;lpg=PA94&amp;dq=wilkinson+malay+orthography&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=f2ees7OY7n&amp;sig=UtkzvI0r_yC7xsTmzHfZm6qzTL8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=T_inT6jbGcrZ8AOXqpmCBQ&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=wilkinson%20&amp;f=false Spelling and Society: The Culture and Politics of Orthography Around the World]'', Mark Sebba, Cambridge University Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; was influenced by English, whereas in the Dutch East Indies, the [[Van Ophuijsen Spelling System|system devised by C. A. Van Ophuijsen]] was influenced by [[Dutch language|Dutch]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=A9UjLYD9jVEC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=van+ophuijsen+indonesia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=K_qnT9KKAcPm8QO2mdXOBA&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=van%20ophuijsen%20indonesia&amp;f=false The Indonesian Language: Its History and Role in Modern Society]'', James N. Sneddon, UNSW Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, in Indonesia, the vowel in the English word 'moon' was formerly represented ''oe'', as in Dutch, although the official spelling of this sound was changed to ''u'' in 1947 when the [[Republican Spelling System]] was used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=PhliAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA563&amp;dq=Van+Ophuijsen+Republic+spelling&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinjsa62KTZAhWMpo8KHSOUCMoQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Van%20Ophuijsen%20Republic%20spelling&amp;f=false|title=How Languages Work: An Introduction to Language and Linguistics|last=Genetti|first=Carol|date=2014-01-23|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521767446|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, until 1972, the initial consonant of the English 'chin' was represented in Malaysia as ''ch'', whereas in Indonesia, it continued to follow Dutch and used ''tj''. Hence the word for 'grandchild' used to be written as ''chuchu'' in Malaysia and ''tjoetjoe'' in Indonesia, until a unified spelling system was introduced in 1972 (known in Indonesia as ''Ejaan Yang Disempurnakan'' or the 'Perfected Spelling') which removed most differences between the two varieties: Malay ''ch'' and Indonesian ''tj'' became ''c'': hence ''cucu''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=sXrxDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=ch+tj+spelling&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjfr9nm2KTZAhWBuo8KHag5D5wQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=ch%20tj%20spelling&amp;f=false|title=Loan-Words in Indonesian and Malay|last=Jones|first=Russell|publisher=Yayasan Pustaka Obor Indonesia|isbn=9786024331740|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesia abandoned the spelling ''dj'' (for the consonant at the beginning of the word 'Jakarta') to conform to the ''j'' already in use in Malaysia, while the old Indonesian ''j'' for the semivowel at the beginning of the English 'young', was replaced with ''y'' as in Malaysia. Likewise, the [[Voiceless velar fricative|velar fricative]] which occurs in many Arabic loanwords, which used to be written 'ch' in Indonesian, became ''kh'' in both languages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, ''oe'' was retained in some proper names, such as the name of the first President, [[Sukarno]] (written as ''Soekarno''), and his successor [[Suharto]], (written as ''Soeharto''). The ''ch'' and ''dj'' letter combinations are still encountered in names such as ''Achmad'' and ''Djojo'' (pronounced as ''Akhmad'' and ''Joyo'' respectively), although the post-1972 spelling is now favoured.

Although the representations of speech sounds are now largely identical in the Indonesian and Malay standards, a number of minor spelling differences remain, usually for historical reasons. For instance, the word for 'money' is written as ''wang'' in Malaysia, but ''uang'' in Indonesia, the word for 'try' is written as ''cuba'' in Malaysia, but ''coba'' in Indonesia, the word for 'because' is written as ''kerana'' in Malaysia, but ''karena'' in Indonesia, while the word for 'cake' is written as ''kuih'' in Malaysia, but ''kue'' in Indonesia. One notable difference in [[punctuation]] between the two languages is the use of different [[decimal mark]]s; Indonesian, influenced by Dutch, uses the [[decimal comma#Countries using Arabic numerals with decimal comma|decimal comma]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://nasional.kompas.com/read/2013/06/14/21044791/Istri.Djoko.Disebut.Beli.Rumah.Rp.7.1.Miliar Istri Djoko Disebut Beli Rumah Rp 7,1 Miliar], ''[[Kompas]]'', 14 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Malay, influenced by English, uses the [[decimal comma#Countries using Arabic numerals with decimal point|decimal point]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utusan.com.my/utusan/Ekonomi/20130606/ek_05/58-IBO-berpotensi-jana-RM1.9b 58 IBO berpotensi jana RM1.9b], ''[[Utusan Melayu]]'', 6 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pronunciation==

Pronunciation also tends to be very different, with East Malaysia, Brunei and East Indonesia pronouncing words in a form called ''Bahasa Baku'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=MKdMDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=malay+creole+language+east+indonesia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiq4rrO2aTZAhVJQI8KHSheDmgQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=A grammar of Papuan Malay|last=Kluge|first=Angela|date=2016-07-08|publisher=Language Science Press|isbn=9783944675862|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the words are pronounced as spelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=Dw-YBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA230&amp;dq=malay+creole+language+east+indonesia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiq4rrO2aTZAhVJQI8KHSheDmgQ6AEIMzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=malay%20creole%20language%20east%20indonesia&amp;f=false|title=Pidgins, Creoles and Mixed Languages: An Introduction|last=Velupillai|first=Viveka|date=2015-04-15|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=9789027268846|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and enunciation tends to be clipped, staccato and faster than on the Malay Peninsula, which is spoken at a more languorous pace. Many vowels are pronounced (and were formerly spelt) differently in Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore and Sumatra: ''tujuh'' is pronounced (and was spelt) ''tujoh'', ''pilih'' as ''pileh'', etc., and many final ''a'''s tend to be pronounced as [[schwa]]s; {{IPA|[e]}} and {{IPA|[o]}} are also allophones of {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} in closed final syllables in peninsular Malaysian, Singaporean and Sumatran varieties of Malay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=uyY6HJYcEKYC&amp;pg=PA209&amp;dq=malay+pronunciation+difference&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiAsNf42aTZAhVMNI8KHVf8Dv4Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=malay%20pronunciation%20difference&amp;f=false|title=Status Change of Languages|last=Ammon|first=Ulrich|last2=Hellinger|first2=Marlis|date=1992|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9783110126686|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=gPekCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT82&amp;dq=malay+pronunciation+difference&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiAsNf42aTZAhVMNI8KHVf8Dv4Q6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=malay%20pronunciation%20difference&amp;f=false|title=Early History of Penang (Penerbit USM)|last=Salleh|first=Editor Muhammad Haji|date=2015-08-27|publisher=Penerbit USM|isbn=9789838616577|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vocabulary==

=== Vocabulary differences ===
Indonesian differs from Malaysian in the quantity of loanwords from Javanese, Dutch and other languages. For example, the word for 'post office' in Malaysia is "pejabat pos" (in Indonesia this means 'post officer'), whereas in Indonesia it is "kantor pos", from the Dutch word for office, ''kantoor''. There are also some [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] influences: in Indonesia, Christmas is known as "Natal", whereas Malaysia uses "Krismas", derived from English (or in some cases also "Natal", due to Indonesian influence). Pronunciation of some loanwords in Standard Malay follows English, while some in Indonesian follows Dutch, for example Malay "televisyen" (from English: television) and Indonesian "televisi" (from Dutch: ''televisie''), the "-syen" and "-si" also prevail in some other words. There are also instances where the Malaysian version derives from English pronunciation while the Indonesian version takes its cue from [[Latin]]. The Latin preference of the (older) Indonesian intellectuals in these instances may be ascribed to the influence of their classical-oriented education when [[Gymnasium (school)|''Gymnasium'']] schools were established during the Dutch colonial period : compare Malay ''kualiti'', ''kuantiti'', ''majoriti'', ''minoriti'' and ''universiti'' with Indonesian ''kualitas'', ''kuantitas'', ''mayoritas'', ''minoritas'' and ''universitas''.

Some words which are spelt the same in both languages may even carry entirely different meanings in the other language, potentially leading to humorous or embarrassing situations: while ''baja'' means "steel" in Indonesian, in Malaysian it means "fertiliser". Also, whereas the Indonesian word ''butuh'' means "require" or "need", in Malaysian, it is a vulgar slang term equivalent to "cunt/cock". Conversely, where the word "banci" seems innocuous enough in Malaysia ("census"), in Indonesia it is a derogatory term for "transvestite".

The relatively large share of Islamic (Arabic or Persian) loan words shared by Malaysian and Indonesian often poses no difficulty in comprehension and usage, although some forms may have developed a (slightly) different meaning or have become obsolete either in Malaysian or in Indonesian, e.g. ''khidmat'', ''wakil'' (see below).

==The influence of English==
One of the most important aspect in differences between Malaysian and Indonesian is the degree of influence from English. Apart from being heavily influenced by the Dutch language, Indonesian language also adopted a significant number of English loanwords in its vocabulary, although English did not play significant role on the Indonesian language and in fact most of these vocabulary are of Dutch origin - Dutch and English share a similar [[Germanic languages|Germanic origin]], and Dutch has also borrowed from [[Latin]], although to a lesser extent than English. There have been many changes in Indonesian as a result of its historical development. Words have been freely borrowed from English and only partly assimilated, in many cases, to the Indonesian patterns of structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indonesian reference grammar|page=2|author=Roderick Ross Macdonald |isbn=9780878401635 |year= 1976 |publisher=Georgetown University Press|location=Georgetown, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1970s, English words began pouring into the language, leading one commentator, writing in 1977, to refer to the "trend towards Indo-Saxonization",&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sYUbAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Indo-Saxonization%22&amp;dq=%22Indo-Saxonization%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjawpXSr6HaAhUTSsAKHbJwAgYQ6AEIpAEwFw ''The Indonesian Quarterly''], Yayasan Proklamasi, [[Centre for Strategic and International Studies]], 1977 Volume 5, Issues 1-3, page 76&lt;/ref&gt; known in Indonesian as ''pengindosaksonan''. A great many borrowings from English sometimes fulfill no communicative need, expressing concepts adequately covered by existing words. Among the examples are: ''akurat'' instead of ''tepat'' (accurate), ''aliansi'' in the place of ''sekutu'' (alliance), ''eksis'' rather than ''ada'' (exist), ''kandidat'' as well as ''calon'' (candidate), ''konklusi'' instead of ''kesimpulan'' (conclusion) ''kontaminasi'' in the place of ''pencemaran'' (contamination), ''opini'' rather than ''pendapat'' (opinion) and ''opsi'' in the place of ''pilihan'' (option). Contrary to its Indonesian counterpart, Malay has shown a remarkable resilience, despite formerly being part of [[British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Study of the Evolution of the Malay Language: Social Change and Cognitive Development|page=14 |author=Seong Chee Tham|isbn= 978-9971691363|year=1991|publisher=Singapore University Press|location=Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some in Indonesia view this trend of excessive borrowings as "language dynamism", while some Malaysian{{clarify|date=November 2013}} [[linguist]]s called it mass "language pollution",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dbp.gov.my/klikdbp/klikdbp3mac8.pdf|title=Bahasa Melayu dan Bahasa Indonesia |publisher=Berita Harian |date=19 March 2008 |accessdate=2011-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lack of creativity in creating new terms.

===Example===
'''The original text in Indonesian''':
:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antaranews.com/berita/261056/draghi-krisis-zona-euro-berisiko-sistemik Antara News – Draghi: Krisis Zona Euro Berisiko "Sistemik"]&lt;/ref&gt; Apabila peraturan '''''pakta stabilitas Eropa''''' dihormati sampai ke '''''detail'''''nya, '''''rasio utang publik''''' ''dibanding'' '''''produk domestik bruto''''' pada '''hari''' krisis akan berada di '''''posisi''''' 10 '''''persentase poin''''' kurang dalam '''''zona''''' euro, katanya.

'''The same text rendered in Malaysian''':
:Apabila peraturan '''''pakatan kestabilan Eropah''''' dihormati secara ter'''perinci''', '''''nisbah hutang awam''''' ''berbanding'' '''''keluaran dalam negara kasar''''' pada '''zaman''' krisis akan berada di '''''kedudukan''''' 10 '''''mata peratusan''''' kurang dalam '''''zon''''' euro, kata beliau.

'''English translation''':
:If the '''''European stability pact''''' rules had been respected in '''''detail''''', the '''''ratio of public debt''''' ''to'' '''''gross domestic product''''' on the '''days''' of crisis would have been at the '''''position''''' 10 '''''percentage points''''' less in the euro'''''zone''''', he said.

==Convergence of vocabulary==
The rift of evolution between the two languages is based more on political nuance and the history of their formation than on cultural reasons. As a result, views regarding each other's languages differ amongst Malaysians and Indonesians. In Malaysia, the national language is Malaysian; in Indonesia, it is Indonesian. Malaysians tend to assert that Malaysian and Indonesian are merely different varieties of the same language, while Indonesians tend to treat them as separate – albeit closely related – languages. The result of this attitude is that the Indonesians feel little need to synchronize their language with Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei, whereas the Malaysians are keener to coordinate the evolution of the language with the Indonesians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2005/yax-455.htm Who is Malay?, July 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; However, both parties have realized that communication benefits from mutually comprehensible and intelligible languages, which motivated efforts to synchronize the languages' development. The effort to synchronize both languages' evolution to increase their mutual intelligibility has been embarked by imposing standard [[rules of language]]. This process is headed by Pusat Bahasa&lt;ref&gt;due to several reorganization in current cabinet, the Indonesian Language Regulator is [http://bahasa.kemdiknas.go.id/lamanbahasa/ Badan Pengembangan dan Pembinaan Bahasa], Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan, Republik Indonesia&lt;/ref&gt; on the Indonesian side and Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka as its Malaysian counterpart.

'''Civil procedure doctrines''' are rules developed by [[case law]] as opposed to being set down in [[code]]s or [[legislation]], which, together with [[court]] rules and codes, define the steps that a person involved in a civil [[lawsuit]] can (or can not) take.

==Purpose==
In the United States [[federal jurisdiction]], these [[doctrine]]s have developed to comprehensively deal with certain common issues that arise when a person is involved in bringing, or contemplating bringing a civil lawsuit.

==Other jurisdictions==
Similar doctrines exist In other [[jurisdiction]]s, (however they are sometimes referred to under names other than 'Doctrines of Civil Procedure'), although often they have much less importance.  

For example, in [[England and Wales]], all [[civil procedure]] is covered by the [[Civil Procedure Rules 1998]], which according to Part 1 of those rules are a 'new [[Procedural law|procedural]] code', and have therefore largely replaced any pre-existing doctrines.

{{nihongo|'''''Double Dragon 3: The Rosetta Stone'''''|ダブルドラゴン3 ザ・ロゼッタストーン|Daburu Doragon 3: Za Rozetta Sutōn}} is a side-scrolling [[beat 'em up]] produced by [[Technōs Japan]] that was originally released as an [[arcade game]] in {{vgy|1990}}. It is the third arcade game in the [[Double Dragon (series)|''Double Dragon'' series]].

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Arcade ddragon3.png|thumb|left|An attract sequence from the arcade version showing three player characters fighting off against enemies]]

''Double Dragon 3'' can be set up to be played by up to two or three player simultaneously, similarly to ''[[The Combatribes]]''. The first two players control returning heroes Billy and Jimmy Lee respectively, while the third player controls a new character named Sonny (a yellow-clad palette swap of the Lee brothers). The controls consists of an eight way joystick and three buttons once again, but the combat system has been greatly altered from previous games. The game discards the directional attack buttons from ''[[Double Dragon II: The Revenge]]'', returning to the punch and kick format of the original ''[[Double Dragon (video game)|Double Dragon]]''. However, moves such as the elbow strike and the hair grab had been removed and new abilities were added in their place. The player can now run by pushing the joystick left or right twice and perform moves with a second player such as a back-to-back hurricane kick when standing near each other and a triangle jump kick when one player jumps towards the other. Other new moves include a running head-butt, a [[suplex|belly-to-back throw]] and a jumping knee drop.

At the start of certain stages, players will have access to an item shop where they can purchase in-game power-ups such as faster attack speed or new moves by using real money. The item selection vary between stages and each one cost a single credit.

One item, "Extra Guys", allows the player to control one of three new character types in addition to the {{nihongo|Lee brothers|リー兄弟}}. These characters form other teams of fighting siblings as well, allowing each player to control a different member of the group. When the player's current fighter is killed, the new one will replace him, essentially substituting the extra lives system from previous games. These new fighters consists of the {{nihongo|Urquidez brothers|ユキーデ兄弟}} (mixed martial arts champions), the {{nihongo|Chin brothers|陳兄弟}} ([[tai chi]] experts) and the {{nihongo|Ōyama brothers|大山兄弟}} ([[karate]] masters). Each player can hold up to three extra fighters in reserve and availability of a fighter type varies depends on the stage.

The Japanese version of ''Double Dragon 3'' was produced after the game was already distributed in North America and Europe and features drastic changes as a result. Most notably, the item shops were removed from the game and players can now choose which character to control at the start of the game, allowing the ability to start the game as any of three new fighter types (Urquidez, Chin and Ōyama) in addition to the Lee brothers. The player has access to his character's entire repertoire of moves, although the command input for the Hurricane Kick requires more precise timing in the Japanese version. Since weapons are no longer purchasable items, they can be found lying around on the floor in certain stages, waiting to be picked up by the player if he's controlling a Lee brother. The game was also made easier, with enemies doing 1/3 less damage than in the overseas releases.

==Plot==
After returning home from a two-year training mission, Billy and Jimmy Lee come across a fortune teller named Hiruko. The woman tells the Lee brothers that in order to challenge the world's strongest adversary, they must seek out the three [[Rosetta Stone]]s that have been scattered around the world.

The game begins in the United States, where the Lee brothers must defeat the remnants of the Black Warriors gang from the previous games before they set off to find the stones. Afterward, the heroes must travel to China, Japan and Italy, where each of the stones are being guarded by formidable fighters unique to each country (such as swordsmen in Japan and archers in Italy) who will refuse to give them up without a fight. Once all three Rosetta Stones have been procured, the Lee brothers' journey reaches its final destination in Egypt, where they face all sorts of supernatural creatures as they enter [[Cleopatra]]'s tomb to uncover the mystery surrounding the stones.

==Development==
The game was not internally developed by [[Technōs Japan]], who were busy working on other projects at the time such as ''[[WWF Superstars]]'' and ''The Combatribes''. Instead a company called East Technology, whose previous work was the 1989 arcade shoot-'em-up ''[[Gigandes]]'', was contracted to develop the third game in the series, resulting in a sequel with a drastically different gameplay and graphic style than its predecessors. The game was controversial upon its release due to the addition of item shops where players acquire power-ups by inserting real money into the cabinet, which was removed from the later Japanese release after negative feedback from playtesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamer.ne.jp/news/201210140001/|title=Sakekan interviews Yoshihisa Kishimoto (Part 1)|publisher=Gamer.ne.jp|language=Japanese|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
The music was composed by Akira Inoue and Takaro Nozaki, replacing original ''Double Dragon'' composer Kazunaka Yamane, who was busy composing for ''The Combatribes'' at the time (Yamane later returned for ''[[Super Double Dragon]]''). Inoue composed the background music for the USA, Italy and Egypt stages (including the boss battle themes), while Nozaki worked on the rest.  The soundtrack was released on June 21, 1991 by [[Pony Canyon]] in Japan as a joint CD album that also included the soundtrack to ''The Combatribes''. The catalog number is PCCB-00065. The first half of the album (tracks 1 to 12) covers the ''Double Dragon 3'' portion, which include an arranged version of the title theme. The album does not feature the shop themes that were present in the export versions of the game.

The [[demo (music)|demo]] versions of Inoue's tracks were later uploaded on his personal YouTube and Niconico channels in 2014.&lt;ref name=a_inoue_youtube&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/inoueakiraTube|website=Youtube|title=Akira Inoue's channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=a_inoue_niconico&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nicovideo.jp/user/40253828/video|title=イノウエアキラ's user page|website=niconico|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
A version for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] titled ''[[Double Dragon III: The Sacred Stones]]'' was released on February {{vgy|1991}}, a few months after the arcade release. This version is not a port, but rather was actually a parallel project that was developed simultaneously with the arcade release.&lt;ref name=urabanashi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://star.ap.teacup.com/kunio/|title=Inside stories by Yoshihisa Kishimoto|language=Japanese|publisher=Star.ap.teacup.com|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the plot of the two versions are similar, the graphics, gameplay system and characters featured in the NES version are very different compared to the arcade version.

''Double Dragon 3'' was ported to various platforms under license from [[Tradewest]]. Versions were released for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Commodore Amiga|Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]] in late 1991, followed by the [[IBM PC]], [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] and [[Game Boy]] in {{vgy|1992}}. These versions of the game were developed by [[SCi Games|The Sales Curve]], with the exception of the Genesis version (which was handled by [[Software Creations (UK)|Software Creations]]). The Game Boy and Genesis versions were published by Acclaim under the title of ''Double Dragon 3: The Arcade Game'', distinguishing them from the earlier NES release.&lt;ref&gt;''Double Dragon 3: The Arcade Game is a trademark of Technōs Japan Corporation. © 1990 Technōs Japan Corp. Licensed exclusively to Tradewest, Inc. Programmed by Software Creations, Ltd. Sublicensed to Acclaim Entertainment, Inc. Sega and Genesis are trademarks of Sega Enterprises Ltd. Flying Edge is a trademark of Acclaim Entertainment, Inc. © 1992 Acclaim Entertainment, Inc. All rights reserved.'' -- From the back box of the Genesis version&lt;/ref&gt;

''Double Dragon 3'' was re-released in {{vgy|2013}} alongside the first two arcade games in a compilation titled ''Double Dragon Trilogy'' produced by [[DotEmu]], which was released on [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[Steam (software)|Steam]] platforms. It only includes the overseas version of the game.

'''Downtown''' is the central business district for [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], [[California]]. Located in the heart of the city, Downtown Bakersfield is easily accessible from all its other parts. It is also reemerging as the center of Bakersfield’s arts, culture and entertainment sectors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bakersfield.com/news/business/growth/x1029066010/A-new-energy-brewing-downtown 'A new energy' brewing downtown]. The Bakersfield Californian.  February 18, 2010.  Accessed: 05-06-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Downtown contains several of the cities major theaters, sporting complexes, museums, and historical landmarks.

What is considered to be “downtown” Bakersfield varies. In order to define Downtown Bakersfield, it is important to first define the Central Bakersfield region. Starting from the north and traveling clockwise, Central Bakersfield is bounded by the Kern River, Union Avenue, [[California State Route 58|State Route 58]], and [[California State Route 99|State Route 99]]. Most people (including the Downtown Business Association) define downtown Bakersfield as the region bordered by 24th Street (SR 178), Union Avenue (SR 204), California Avenue, and "F" Street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwstatic.kern.org/gems/dtba/CathyFlyerMapNEWtrolley.pdf Downtown Dining] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719121407/http://wwwstatic.kern.org/gems/dtba/CathyFlyerMapNEWtrolley.pdf |date=July 19, 2011 }}. Downtown Bakersfield Business Association. Accessed: 05-06-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Other people extend the boundaries east to State Route 99 and north to Golden State Avenue (SR 204). Some people consider all of Central Bakersfield to be “downtown Bakersfield.”

Unlike most cities of similar size, Bakersfield does not have a towering skyline. There are few tall buildings in Downtown Bakersfield, such as the Bank of America Building (10 stories), the Bakersfield Marriott Hotel (9 stories), and The Padre Hotel (8 stories). The shops and cafes that line the Downtown streets feature a variety of dining and shopping opportunities. Visitors to Downtown Bakersfield can find souvenirs, antiques, local art work, and even natural baby products. Notable attractions in Downtown Bakersfield include the Rabobank Arena, the McMurtrey Aquatic Center, the Bakersfield Museum of Art, the historic Fox Theater, the exquisitely renovated The Padre Hotel, and a nightlife district centered on 19th Street and Wall Street Alley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bakersfieldcarealestate.biz/Small_Town_Feel_In_A_Big_City.asp|title=About Downtown Bakersfield|work=numerous sources|accessdate=2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727185106/http://www.bakersfieldcarealestate.biz/Small_Town_Feel_In_A_Big_City.asp|archivedate=2013-07-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Districts==
Bakersfield has always had some districts located downtown. Recently, as part of a redevelopment effort, others are being created.

===Arts District===
{{main|Arts District, Bakersfield}}

[[File:2009-0726-CA-Bakersfield-ThePadre.jpg|thumb|right|The Padre Hotel building, renovated and reopened in 2010, has been a longtime landmark in Downtown Bakersfield.]]
'''The Arts District''' is one of the newer districts to be defined in Downtown Bakersfield. It is roughly bordered by 21st Street, Chester Avenue, 17th Street, and "G" Street. Theaters in the district include the [[Fox Theater (Bakersfield)|Fox Theater]] (20th St. and H St), Stars Theater (Chester Ave. and 20th St) and Spotlight Theater (19th St. and H St). In addition, several art galleries are located around the intersection of 19th Street and Eye Street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwstatic.kern.org/gems/artscouncil/ArtsCultureMap.pdf Arts and Culture District] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719121521/http://wwwstatic.kern.org/gems/artscouncil/ArtsCultureMap.pdf |date=2011-07-19 }}. The Arts Council of Kern. Accessed: 05-06-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Arts District is also home to the historic The [[Padre Hotel]], which has been remodeled and reopened as a boutique hotel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepadrehotel.com/ Home Page]. The Padre Hotel. Accessed: 05-06-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The district has also begun holding [[First Friday (public event)|First Friday]] which showcases galleries and allows for street vendors on the first Friday of every month in support of local artists.

===Civic Center===
{{main|Civic Center, Bakersfield}}
'''Civic Center''' is the center of government for both the [[Bakersfield, California|City of Bakersfield]] and the [[Kern County, California|County of Kern]]. It is roughly bordered by Truxtun Ave, Q St, BNSF railroad yard, and H St. Major government buildings include [[Bakersfield City Hall]], County of Kern Administrative Building, [[Kern County Hall of Records|hall of records]], Superior Court, and Municipal Court.

Although structures representing the center of government, such as City Hall and the Court House are located there, growth has resulted in many services being moved to other places throughout the city. Also, many state and federal services are also placed in locations outside of the Civic Center.

Civic Center has also become one of Bakersfield’s sport centers. Civic Center also houses the [[Rabobank Theater and Convention Center]] (formerly known as the Civic Auditorium). This is the largest theater and convention facility in the city. It is also conveniently located next to the Marriott Convention Hotel. The [[Rabobank Arena]] (formerly known as the Centennial Garden), is a large indoor multipurpose arena.&lt;ref&gt;Alten, Jennifer. [http://www.sportsdestinations.com/ID-66-articledetails.aspx The Sun Shines on Bakersfield's Sporting Community] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728152816/http://www.sportsdestinations.com/ID-66-articledetails.aspx |date=July 28, 2009 }}. Sports Destination Management. July/August 2009. Accessed: 05-07-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[McMurtrey Aquatic Center]] houses a 50-meter competition swimming and diving pool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bakersfieldswim.us/pools.html City Pools] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527191735/http://www.bakersfieldswim.us/pools.html |date=May 27, 2010 }}. City of Bakersfield Recreation &amp; Parks. Accessed: 05-07-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the [[Bakersfield Ice Sports Center]], an indoor ice rink used for junior and adult league hockey and recreation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bakersfieldicesports.com/ice_hockey.html Hockey League] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511002616/http://www.bakersfieldicesports.com/ice_hockey.html |date=May 11, 2010 }}. Bakersfield Ice Sports. Accessed: 05-07-2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education District===
{{main|Education District, Bakersfield}}
'''Education District''' is the center of education institutions that are located Downtown. Currently five institutions have a campus or a satellite campus in the district. The Education District is roughly bordered by 24th St, Q St, 20th St and Chester Ave.

===Mill Creek===
{{main|Mill Creek, Bakersfield}}
'''Mill Creek''' is another one of Downtown’s newer districts, and is still being developed. When fully completed, Mill Creek will consist of a mixture of both low and high density residential, commercial and retail. The redevelopment area is defined to be Golden State Avenue, Union Avenue, California Avenue, and "Q" Street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bakersfieldcity.us/cityhighlights/state_of_city_2008/2008_powerpoint_presentations/dkunz-millcreek.pdf Mill Creek, A Downtown Master Plan]. City of Bakersfield. Page 2. Accessed: 05-07-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Running through the center of Mill Creek is the [[Mill Creek (Bakersfield)|Mill Creek Linear Park]]. This runs along the manmade Kern Island Canal, which has been redesigned to have the look of a natural river.

A major attraction in the area is the [[Bakersfield Museum of Art]]. The [[Beale Memorial Library]], which is the headquarters for the Kern County Library System, is also located in the Mill Creek. Another important structure is the [[Bakersfield (Amtrak station)|Amtrak station]], which is Bakersfield’s rail link to the [[San Joaquin Valley]].

==Other Neighborhoods and Districts==
The following are neighborhoods and districts which are near to Downtown Bakersfield. Some people consider them to be a part of Downtown.

===Buck Owens Boulevard===
[[File:Bakersfield CA - sign.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Bakersfield Sign]].]]
Formerly named Pierce Road, Buck Owens Boulevard was renamed in 1998 in honor of long-time Bakersfield resident and [[country music]] legend [[Buck Owens]], who died in 2006.&lt;ref name="About Buck Owens"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buckowens.com/aboutbuck.html|title=About Buck Owens|work=Buck Owen's Crystal Palace|accessdate=4 July 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707215828/http://www.buckowens.com/aboutbuck.html|archivedate=7 July 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buck Owens Boulevard runs north/south, parallel to Highway 99, between Rosedale Highway/24th Street in Bakersfield, and Airport Drive in [[Oildale, California|Oildale]].

===Westchester===
The '''Westchester''' neighborhood is just west of Downtown Bakersfield, although some people consider it to be part of Downtown. Westchester is bounded by the [[Kern River]], "F" Street, BNSF Railroad Yard and [[California State Route 99|State Route 99]] (or Oak Street).&lt;ref&gt;Waldner, Erin [http://www.bakersfield.com/entertainment/local/x726008486/Living-in-Westchester Living in Westchester]. The Bakersfield Californian. September 26, 2006. Accessed: 05-07-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Westchester is a mostly residential neighborhood. The neighborhood is known for large shady trees and historic homes built between the 1900s and 1960s. Main points of interest include the [[Kern County Museum]] (with the [[Beale Memorial Clock Tower]]), and [[Sam Lynn Ballpark]].

[[File:2009-0726-CA-Bakersfield-GarcesCircle.jpg|thumb|right|Garces Circle.]]
Being located in the heart of Bakersfield, getting to and from Downtown is relatively easy. [[California State Route 178|State route 178 freeway]] ends at the eastern edge, and provides connection to the northeast. [[California State Route 99|State route 99]] is approximately 1/2 miles west, and provides north/south connection to the rest of the city. Golden State Ave ([[California State Route 204|state route 204]]), as a freeway ends at the north edge of downtown, and provides access to the northwest.

Downtown also is the primary hub for all modes of intracity and intercity transportation, except air travel. [[Golden Empire Transit]] (GET) provides transportation to Greater Bakersfield from the downtown transit center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getbus.org/maps Maps]. Golden Empire Transit. Accessed: 05-07-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kern Regional Transit]] provides intercity transportation from GET downtown transit center or Amtrak station.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.co.kern.ca.us/roads/kernregionaltransit.asp Kern Regional Transit Schedule]. Kern County Roads. Accessed: 05-07-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amtrak]] provides rail connection to the San Joaquin Valley north of Bakersfield, and several bus routes to points west, south and east of the city (with tickets that travel by train at least once).&lt;ref&gt;''San Joaquin Timetable''. Amtrak. Effective date: October 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although traveling to downtown is relatively easy by car, traveling through it is more difficult. Since SR 178 freeway and Golden State Avenue (SR 204 freeway) stop at the edge of Downtown, cars must travel on surface streets to connect to additional freeways. This has created heavy traffic on major connecting arterial roads, especially on 23rd Street and 24th Street, which are one-way in each direction. This is especially a problem for cars traveling from the northeast to the southwest, since 23rd/24th St. is the most direct route between those two points.

She has been teaching at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] since 1977, and is also an Adjunct Professor of History of Art and Architecture at the [[University of Pittsburgh]].

Edith Balas is also a Holocaust survivor, having been sent to the Nazi death camp [[Auschwitz]].  In ''Bird in Flight: Memoir of a Survivor and Scholar,''  Balas tells her story of facing grim situations and becoming what she describes as a “professional survivor.”  Balas named her memoir “Bird in Flight” after [[Constantin Brâncuși]]’s famous sculpture of the same name. “I consider it emblematic of my life,” she said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cmu.edu/news/archive/2011/March/march22_edithbalasmemoir.shtml|title=March 22: CMU's Edith Balas Pens Memoir Depicting Life as a Survivor and Scholar - Carnegie Mellon University - CMU|first=Carnegie Mellon University|last=(CMU)|website=www.cmu.edu|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war her husband was imprisoned by the [[Communist Romania|communist authorities]] for three years, during which Balas raised their two daughters. She received an M.A. in Philosophy from the [[University of Bucharest]] in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cmu.edu/cas/people/balas_edith.html|title=Edith Balas - Center for the Arts in Society - Carnegie Mellon University|first=Carnegie Mellon|last=University|website=www.cmu.edu|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then emigrated to the United States with her husband, and received an M.A. in the History of Arts from Pittsburgh University in 1970 and a Ph.D. in 1973.

The '''Equal Opportunities Commission''' ('''EOC''') was an independent [[non-departmental public body]], (NDPB) in the United Kingdom, which tackled sex discrimination and promoted gender equality. Its last chair was [[Jenny Watson]].

It was set up under the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and had statutory powers to help enforce this Act, the Equal Pay Act and other [[gender equality]] [[legislation]] that existed in Britain. Due to the ability of the [[Scottish Parliament]] and [[Welsh Assembly]] to vary the law in this area, separate EOC sub-agencies existed for [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]]{{ref|EOC}}.  The EOC did not cover Northern Ireland, where instead these matters were dealt with by the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland.
 
Similar agencies existed for other categories of equality law in Great Britain. In October 2007 these all became part of a new single equality body, the [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30647">In [[cognitive psychology]], '''fast mapping''' is the term used for the hypothesized mental process whereby a new concept is learned (or a new hypothesis formed) based only on a single exposure to a given unit of information.  Fast mapping is thought by some researchers to be particularly important during [[language acquisition]] in young children, and may serve (at least in part) to explain the prodigious rate at which children gain vocabulary. In order to successfully use the fast mapping process, a child must possess the ability to use "referent selection" and "referent retention" of a novel word. There is evidence that this can be done by children as young as two years old, even with the constraints of minimal time and several distractors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Chad Spiegel and Justin Halberda|url=http://www.psy.jhu.edu/~labforchilddevelopment/pdf_files/Spiegal%20Halberda%202011.pdf|title=Rapid fast-mapping abilities in 2-year-olds|journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology|volume=109|issue=1|pages=132–40|year=2010|accessdate=23 January 2014|doi=10.1016/j.jecp.2010.10.013|pmid=21145067}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous research in fast mapping has also shown that children are able to retain a newly learned word for a substantial amount of time after they are subjected to the word for the first time (Carey and Bartlett, 1978). Further research by Markson and Bloom (1997), showed that children can remember a novel word a week after it was presented to them even with only one exposure to the novel word. While children have also displayed the ability to have equal recall for other types of information, such as novel facts, their ability to extend the information seems to be unique to novel words. This suggests that fast mapping is a specified mechanism for word learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Behrend, D.A., Scofield, J., &amp; Kleinknecht, E.E.|title=Beyond fast mapping: Young children's extensions of novel words and novel facts|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=2001|volume=37|issue=5|pages=698–705|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.37.5.698|pmid=11552764}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process was first formally articulated and the term 'fast mapping' coined by [[Harvard]] researchers [[Susan Carey]] and Elsa Bartlett in 1978.&lt;ref name="Carey"&gt;{{cite conference|author1=Carey, S.  |author2=Bartlett, E. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1978|title=Acquiring a single new word|conference=Proceedings of the Stanford Child Language Conference|volume=15|pages=17–29}} (Republished in Papers and Reports on Child Language Development 15, 17–29.)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evidence against ==
Today, there is evidence to suggest that children do not learn words through 'fast mapping' but rather learn probabilistic, predictive relationships between objects and sounds that develop over time. Evidence for this comes, for example, from children's struggles to understand color words: although infants can distinguish between basic color categories,&lt;ref name="Bornstein"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bornstein | first1 = M. H. | last2 = Kessen | first2 = W. | last3 = Weiskopf | first3 = S. | year = 1976 | title = Color vision and hue categorization in young human infants | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 115–129 | doi=10.1037/0096-1523.2.1.115| pmid = 1262792 }}&lt;/ref&gt; many sighted children use color words in the same way that blind children do up until the fourth year.&lt;ref name="Gleitman"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Landau, B., &amp; Gleitman, L. R.|year=1985|title=Language and experience: Evidence from the blind child|location=Cambridge, MA|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, words such as "blue" and "yellow" appear in their vocabularies and they produce them in appropriate places in speech, but their application of individual color terms is haphazard and interchangeable. If shown a blue cup and asked its color, typical three-year-olds seem as likely to answer "red" as "blue." These difficulties persist up until around age four, even after hundreds of explicit training trials.&lt;ref name="Rice"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rice, N.|year=1980|title=Cognition to language|location=Baltimore, MD|publisher=University Park Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inability for children to understand color stems from the cognitive process of whole object constraint. Whole object constraint is the idea that a child will understand that a novel word represents the entirety of that object. Then, if the child is presented with further novel words, they attach inferred meanings to the object. However, color is the last attribute to be considered because it explains the least about the object itself. Children's behavior clearly indicates that they have knowledge of these words, but this knowledge is far from complete; rather it appears to be predictive, as opposed to all-or-none.

=== Alternate theories ===
An alternate theory of deriving the meaning of newly learned words by young children during language acquisition stems from John Locke's "associative proposal theory". Compared to the "intentional proposal theory", associative proposal theory refers to the deduction of meaning by comparing the novel object to environmental stimuli.  A study conducted by Yu &amp; Ballard (2007), introduced cross-situational learning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chen, Yu|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~dll/papers/yu_psychscience07.pdf|title=Rapid Word Learning Under Uncertainty via Cross-Situational Statistics|journal=Psychological Science|volume=18|issue=5|year=2006|accessdate=18 September 2013|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01915.x|pmid=17576281|pages=414–420|citeseerx=10.1.1.385.7473}}&lt;/ref&gt; a method based on Locke's theory. Cross-situtational learning theory is a mechanism in which the child learns meaning of words over multiple exposures in varying contexts in an attempt to eliminate uncertainty of the word's true meaning on an exposure-by-exposure basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank, Michael|url=http://langcog.stanford.edu/papers/F-chapterunderreview.pdf|title=Learning words through probabilistic inferences about speakers' communicative intentions|accessdate=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, more recent studies&lt;ref name="Medina"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Medina, T. N., Snedeker, J., Trueswell, J. C., and Gleitman, L. R.|year=2010|title=How words can and cannot be learned by observation|doi=10.1073/pnas.1105040108|pmid=21576483|pmc=3107260|pages=9014–9019|volume=108|issue=22|journal=PNAS|url=http://www.ircs.upenn.edu/~truesweb/lila_pdfs/Medina%20Snedeker%20Trueswell%20&amp;%20Gleitman%202011%20-%20word-learning%20by%20observation.pdf|bibcode=2011PNAS..108.9014M}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that some amount of fast mapping does take place, questioning the validity of previous laboratory studies that aim to show that probabilistic learning does occur.  A critique to the theory of fast mapping is how can children connect the meaning of the novel word with the novel word after just one exposure? For example, when showing a child a blue ball and saying the word "blue" how does the child know that the word blue explains the color of the ball, not the size, or shape? If children learn words by fast mapping than they must use inductive reasoning to understand the meaning associated with the novel word. A popular theory to explain this inductive reasoning is that children apply [[Word learning biases|word-learning constraints]] to the situation where a novel word is introduced. There are speculations as to why this is; Markman and Wachtel (1988) conducted a study that helps explain the possible underlying principles of fast mapping. They claim children adhere to the theories of [[Word learning biases#cite note-Hansen-3|whole-object bias]], the assumption that a novel label refers to the entire object rather than its parts, color, substance or other properties, and mutual exclusivity bias, the assumption that only one label applies to each object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hansen | first1 = M.B. | last2 = Markman | first2 = E.M. | year = 2009 | title = Children's use of mutual exclusivity to learn labels for parts of objects | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 45 | issue = 2| pages = 592–596 | doi=10.1037/a0014838| pmid = 19271842 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In their experiment, children were presented with an object that they either were familiar with or was presented with a whole object term. Markman and Watchel concluded that the mere juxtaposition between familiar and novel terms may assist in part term acquisition. In other words, children will put constraints on themselves and assume the novel term refers to the whole object in view rather than to its parts.&lt;ref name=Almgren&gt;{{cite book|authors=Braisby, Nick; Dockrell, Julie E. and Best, Rachel M.|year=2001|chapter=Children's acquisition of science terms: does fast mapping work?|editors=Almgren, Margareta; Barreña, Adoni; Ezeizabarrena, María-José; Idiazabal, Itziar and MacWhinney, Brian |title=Research on child language acquisition: proceedings of the 8th Conference of the International Association for the Study of Child Language|location=Somerville, MA, USA|publisher=Cascadilla Press|pp=1066–1087|url=http://oro.open.ac.uk/3641/1/IASCL_Paper_II.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been six lexical constraints proposed (reference, extendibility, object scope, categorical scope, novel name, conventionality) that guide a child's learning of a novel word.&lt;ref name=Almgren/&gt; When learning a new word children apply these constraints. However, this purposed method of constraints is not flawless. If children use these constraints there are many words that children will never learn such as actions, attributes, and parts. Studies have found that both toddlers and adults were more likely to categorize an object by its shape than its size or color.&lt;ref name=Trueswell/&gt;

==Cross-situational learning versus propose but verify==
The next question in fast mapping theory is how exactly is the meaning of the novel word learned? An experiment performed in October 2012 by the Department of Psychology by University of Pennsylvania,&lt;ref name=Trueswell&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trueswell|first1=John C.|last2=Medina|first2=Tamara Nicol|last3=Hafri|first3=Alon|last4=Gleitman|first4=Lila R.|title=Propose but verify: Fast mapping meets cross-situational word learning|journal=Cognitive Psychology|date=February 2013|volume=66|issue=1|pages=126–156|doi=10.1016/j.cogpsych.2012.10.001|pmid=23142693|pmc=3529979|bibcode=1992CogPs..24..535V}}&lt;/ref&gt; researchers attempted to determine if fast mapping occurs via cross-situational learning or by another method, "Propose but verify". In cross-situational learning, listeners hear a novel word and store multiple conjectures of what the word could mean based on its situational context. Then after multiple exposures the listener is able to target the meaning of the word by ruling out conjectures. In propose but verify, the learner makes a single conjecture about the meaning of the word after hearing the word used in context. The learner then carries that conjecture forward to be reevaluated and modified for consistency when the word is used again. The results of the experiment seems to support that propose but verify is the way by which learners fast map new words.&lt;ref name=Trueswell/&gt;

=== Criticisms ===
There is also controversy over whether words learned by fast mapping are retained or forgotten. Previous research has found that generally, children retain a newly learned word for a period of time after learning. In the aforementioned Carey and Bartlett study (1978), children who were taught the word "chromium" were found to keep the new lexical entry in working memory for several days, illustrating a process of gradual lexical alignment known as "extended mapping."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swingley|first1=Daniel|title=Fast Mapping and Slow Mapping in Children's Word Learning|journal=Language Learning and Development|date=30 June 2010|volume=6|issue=3|pages=179–183|doi=10.1080/15475441.2010.484412|url=http://www.psych.upenn.edu/~swingley/papers/swingley_LLD10_fastmap.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study, performed by Markson and Bloom (1997), showed that children remembered words up to 1 month after the study was conducted. However, more recent studies have shown that words learned by fast mapping tend to be forgotten over time. In a study conducted by Vlach and Sandhofer (2012), memory supports, which had been included in previous studies, were removed. This removal appeared to result in a low retention of words over time. This is a possible explanation for why previous studies showed high retention of words learned by fast mapping.&lt;ref name=Vlach/&gt;{{rp|46}}

Some researchers are concerned that experiments testing for fast mapping are produced in artificial settings. They feel that fast mapping doesn't occur as often in more real life, natural situations. They believe that testing for fast mapping should focus more on the actual understanding of a word instead of just its reproduction. For some, testing to see if the child can use the new word in a different situation constitutes true knowledge of a word, rather than simply identifying the new word.&lt;ref name=Almgren/&gt;

== Variables affecting an individual's fast mapping ability==

=== Bilingualism ===

When learning novel words, it is believed that early exposure to multiple linguistic systems facilitates the acquisition of new words later in life. This effect was referred to by Kaushanskaya and Marian (2009) as the bilingual advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaushanskaya|first1=M|last2=Marian|first2=V|title=The Bilingual Advantage in Novel Word Learning|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|volume=16|issue=4|pages=705–710|doi=10.3758/pbr.16.4.705|pmid=19648456|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; That being said, a bilingual individual's ability to fast map can vary greatly throughout their life.

During the language acquisition process, a child may require a greater amount of time to determine a correct referent than a child who is a monolingual speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alt|first=Mary|author2=Christina Meyers |author3=Cecilia Figueroa |title=Factors That Influence Fast Mapping in Children Exposed to Spanish and English|journal=Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research|year=2013|volume=56|issue=4|pages=1237–38|doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2012/11-0092)|pmid=23816663|pmc=4487618}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time a bilingual child is of school age, they perform equally on naming tasks when compared to monolingual children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sheng|first1=Li|last2=McGregor|first2=Karla|last3=Marian|first3=Viorica|title=Lexical-Semantic Organization in Bilingual Children: Evidence from a Repeated Word Association Task|journal=Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research|date=June 2006|volume=49|issue=3|pages=572–587|doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2006/041)|pmc=1894819|pmid=16787896}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the age of adulthood, bilingual individuals have acquired word-learning strategies believed to be of assistance on fast mapping tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marian|first1=V|last2=Faroqi-Shah|first2=Y|last3=Kaushanskaya|first3=M|last4=Blumenfeld|first4=H|last5=Sheng|first5=L|title=Bilingualism: Consequences for Language, Cognition, Development, and the Brain|journal=ASHA Leader|date=2009|volume=14|issue=13|pages=10–13|doi=10.1044/leader.FTR2.14132009.10}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is speech practice, a strategy where the participant listens and reproduces the word in order to assist in remembering and decrease the likelihood of forgetting .&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
Bilingualism can increase an individual's cognitive abilities and contribute to their success in fast mapping words, even when they are using a nonnative language.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fong Kan|first1=Pui|last2=Sadagopan|first2=Neeraja|last3=Janich|first3=Lauren|last4=Andrade|first4=Marixa|title=Effects of Speech Practice on Fast Mapping in Monolingual and Bilingual Speakers|journal=Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research|date=June 2014|volume=57|issue=3|pages=929–941|doi=10.1044/2013_jslhr-l-13-0045|pmid=24167242}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socioeconomic status ===

Children growing up in a low-socioeconomic status environment receive less attention than those in high-socioeconomic status environments. As a result, these children may be exposed to less words and therefore their language development may suffer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kirk | first1 = E. | last2 = Howlett | first2 = N. | last3 = Pine | first3 = K. J. | last4 = Fletcher | first4 = B. | year = 2013 | title = To Sign or Not to Sign?

However, when examining their fast mapping abilities there were no significant differences observed in their ability to learn and remember novel words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Horton-Ikard|first1=R|last2=Weismer|first2=S|title=A Preliminary Examination of Vocabulary and Word Learning in African American Toddlers from Middle and Low Socioeconimc Status Homes|journal=American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology|volume=16|issue=4|pages=381–392|doi=10.1044/1058-0360(2007/041)|pmid=17971497|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children from low SES families were able to use multiple sources of information in order to fast map novel words. When working with children from low SES homes, providing a context of the word that attributes meaning, is a linguistic strategy that can benefit the child's word knowledge development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spencer|first1=E.J|last2=Schuele|first2=C|title=An Examination of Fast Mapping Skills in Preschool Children from Families with Low Socioeconomic Status|journal=Clinical Linguistics &amp; Phonetics|volume=26|issue=10|pages=845–862|doi=10.3109/02699206.2012.705215|year=2012|pmid=22954365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Face-to-face interaction ===
Three learning supports that have been proven to help with the fast mapping of words are saliency, repetition and generation of information.&lt;ref name=Vlach&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vlach|first1=Haley|last2=Sandhofer|first2=Catherine|title=Fast mapping across time: memory processes support children's retention of learned words|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|date=February 2012|volume=3|pages=1–8|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00046|pmc=3286766|pmid=22375132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of [[face-to-face interaction]] a child has with their parent affects his or her ability to fast map novel words. Interaction with a parent leads to greater exposure to words in different contexts, which in turn promotes language acquisition. Face to face interaction cannot be replaced by educational shows because although repetition is used, children do not receive the same level of correction or trial and error from simply watching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Christakis | first1 = DA | last2 = Gilkerson | first2 = J | last3 = Richards | first3 = JA | display-authors = etal   | year = 2009 | title = Audible Television and Decreased Adult Words, Infant Vocalizations, and Conversational Turns: A Population-Based Study | url = | journal = Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med | volume = 163 | issue = 6| pages = 554–558 | doi = 10.1001/archpediatrics.2009.61 | pmid = 19487612 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When a child is asked to generate the word it promotes the transition to long-term memory to a larger extent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bertsch|first1=Sharon|last2=Pesta|first2=B.J|last3=Wiscott|first3=R|last4=McDaniel|first4=M|title=The generation effect: A meta-analytic review|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition|date=2007|volume=35|issue=2|doi=10.3758/bf03193441|pages=201–210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evidence of fast mapping in other animals ==
It appears that fast mapping is not only limited to humans, but can occur in dogs as well. In an experiment, a dog, named Rico, was able to learn the labels of over 200 various items. He was also able to identify novel objects simply by exclusion learning. Exclusion learning occurs when one learns the name of a novel object because one is already familiar with the names of other objects belonging to the same group. The researchers, who conducted the experiment, mention the possibility that a language acquisition device specific to humans does not control fast mapping.  They believe that fast mapping is possibly directed by simple memory mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kaminski | first1 = J | last2 = Call | first2 = J | last3 = Fischer | first3 = J | year = 2004 | title = Word Learning in a Domestic Dog: Evidence for "Fast Mapping | url = | journal = Science | volume = 304 | issue = 5677| pages = 1682–1683 | doi=10.1126/science.1097859 | pmid=15192233| bibcode = 2004Sci...304.1682K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the deaf population ==
A study by Lederberg et al., was performed to determine if deaf and hard of hearing children fast map to learn novel words. In the study, when the novel word was introduced, the word was both spoken and signed. Then the children were asked to identify the referent object and even extend the novel word to identify a similar object. The results of the study indicated that deaf and hard of hearing children do perform fast mapping to learn novel words. However, compared to children with normal hearing (aging toddlers to 5 years old) the deaf and hard of hearing children did not fast map as accurately and successfully. The results showed a slight delay which disappeared as the children were a maximum of 5 years old. The conclusion that was drawn from the study is that the ability to fast map has a relationship to the size of the lexicon. The children with normal hearing had a larger lexicon and therefore were able to more accurately fast map compared to deaf and hard of hearing children who did not have as large of a lexicon. It is by around age 5 that deaf and hard of hearing children have a similar size lexicon to 5 year old children of normal hearing. This evidence supports the idea that fast mapping requires inductive reasoning so the larger the lexicon (number of known words) the easier it is for the child to reason out the accurate meaning for the novel word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=M. Diane Clark|author2=Marc Marschark|author3=Michael A. Karchmer|year=2001|title=Context, Cognition, and Deafness|pages=103–107|publisher=Gallaudet University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the area of cochlear implants (CIs), there are variegated opinions on whether cochlear implants impact a child's ability to become a more successful fast mapper.  In 2000, a study by Kirk, Myomoto, and others determined that there was a general correlation between the age of Cochlear Implant implementation and improved lexical skills (e.g. fast mapping and other vocabulary growth skills). They believed that children given implants prior to two years of age yielded higher success rates than older children between five and seven years of age.  With that said, researchers at the University of Iowa wish to amend that very generalization.  In 2013, "Word Learning Processes in Children with Cochlear Implants" by Elizabeth Walker and others indicated that although there may be a some levels of increased vocabulary acquisition in CI individuals, many post-implantees generally were slower developers of his/her own lexicon.  Walker bases her claims on another research study in 2007 (Tomblin et al.)  One of the purposes of this study was to note a CI child's ability to comprehend and retain novel words with related referents.  When compared with non-deaf children, the CI children had lower success scores in retention.  This finding was based on scorings obtained from their test: from 0 to 6 (0 the worst, 6 the best), CI children averaged a score around a 2.0 whereas non-deaf children scored higher (roughly 3.86).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Walker, Elizabeth|author2=McGregor, Karla|author3=Bacon, Sid|author4=Tobey, Emily|title=Word Learning Processes in Children with Cochlear Implants|journal=Journal of Speech, Language, &amp; Hearing Research|volume=56|issue=2|pages=375–87|year=2013|pmid=22896047|doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2012/11-0343)|pmc=3578980 |url=https://ir.uiowa.edu/etd/616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In individuals with ADHD==
An experiment was performed to assess fast mapping in adults with typical language abilities, disorders of spoken/written language (hDSWL), and adults with hDSWL and ADHD. 
The conclusion draw from the experiment revealed that adults with ADHD were the least accurate at "mapping semantic features and slower to respond to lexical labels." 
The article reasoned that the tasks of fast mapping requires high attentional demand and so "a lapse in attention could lead to diminished encoding of the new information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mary|first=Alt|author2=Michelle L. Gutmann|title=Fast mapping semantic features: Performance of adults with normal language, history of disorders of spoken and written language, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder on a word learning task|journal=J Communication Disorders|volume=42|issue=5|date=April 5, 2009|pages=347–364|pmid=19439319|doi=10.1016/j.jcomdis.2009.03.004|pmc=2771630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In individuals with language deficits==

Fast mapping in individuals with [[aphasia]] has gained research attention due to its effect on speaking, listening, reading, and writing. Research done by Blumstein makes an important distinction between those with [[Broca's aphasia]], who are limited in physical speech, as compared to those with [[Wernicke's aphasia]], who cannot link words with meaning. In Broca's aphasia, Blumstein found that whereas individuals with Wernicke's aphasia performed at the same level as the normal control group, those with Broca's aphasia showed slower reaction times for word presentations after reduced voice onset time stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Blumstein, S. E.|author2=Milberg, W.|author3=Brown, T.|author4=Hutchinson, A.|author5=Kurowski, K.|author6=Burton, M. W.|year=2000|lastauthoramp=y|title=The mapping from sound structure to the lexicon in aphasia: Evidence from rhyme and repetition priming|journal=Brain and Language|volume=72|issue=2|pages=75–99|pmid=10722782|doi=10.1006/brln.1999.2276}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In short, when stimuli were acoustically altered, individuals with Broca's aphasia experienced difficulty recognizing the novel stimuli upon second presentation. Bloomstein's findings reinforce the crucial difference between one's ability to retain novel stimuli versus the ability to express novel stimuli. Because individuals with Wernicke's aphasia are only limited in their understanding of semantic meaning, it makes sense that the participant's novel stimulus recall would not be affected. On the other hand, those with Broca's aphasia lack the ability to produce speech, in effect hindering their ability to recall novel stimuli. Although individuals with Broca's aphasia are limited in their speech production, it is not clear whether they simply cannot formulate the physical speech or if they actually did not process the stimuli.

Research has also been done investigating fast mapping abilities in children with language deficits.  One study done by Dollaghan compared children with normal language to those with expressive syntactic deficits, a type of specific language impairment characterized by simplified speech.  The study found that normal and language impaired children did not differ in their ability to connect the novel word to referent or to comprehend the novel word after a single exposure.  The only difference was that the language-impaired children were less successful in their production of the novel word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dollaghan, C. |year=1987|title=Fast Mapping in Normal and Language-Impaired Children|journal=Journal of Speech and Hearing Disorders|volume=52|issue=3|pages=218–222|pmid=3455444|doi=10.1044/jshd.5203.218}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that expressive language deficits are unrelated to the ability to connect word and referent in a single exposure.  The problem for children with those deficits arises only when trying to convert that mental representation into verbal speech.

==In individuals with intellectual disabilities==
A few researchers looked at fast mapping abilities in boys with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD), also referred to as [[autism spectrum]], and boys with [[fragile X syndrome]] (FXS). The experimental procedure consisted of a presentation phase where two objects were presented, one of which was a novel object with a nonsense word name. This was followed by a comprehension testing phase, which assessed the boys' ability to remember and correctly select the novel objects. Even though all groups in the study had fast mapping performances above chance levels, in comparison to boys showing typical development, those with ASD and FXS demonstrated much more difficulty in comprehending and remembering names assigned to the novel objects. The authors concluded that initial processes involved in associative learning, such as fast mapping, are hindered in boys with FXS and ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McDuffie | first1 = A. | last2 = Kover | first2 = S.

==Computational models==
Research in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] to reproduce computationally this ability, termed [[one-shot learning]]. This is pursued to reduce the learning curve, as other models like [[reinforcement learning]] need thousand of exposures to a situation to learn it.

'''''Finn's Hotel''''' is a posthumously-published collection of ten short narrative pieces written by Irish author [[James Joyce]].&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/14/james-joyce-collection-published James Joyce's 'last undiscovered' collection to be published | Books | theguardian.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Written in 1923, the works were not published until 2013 by [[Ithys Press]], who claimed the work to be a precursor to Joyce's ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''.&lt;ref name=ithyspress&gt;[http://ithyspress.wordpress.com/2013/06/14/finns-hotel-by-james-joyce-first-edition-just-published/ "''Finn's Hotel'' by James Joyce"], ''Ithys Press''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
Ithys Press published their fine arts edition of ''Finn's Hotel'' in June 2013.&lt;ref name=ithyspress /&gt; The edition was arranged with a preface by Danis Rose, an introduction by [[Seamus Deane]], featuring eleven illustrations by [[Casey Sorrow]], and design and letterpress printed by Michael Caine.

The publication attracted controversy as some Joyce scholars labeled the works as drafts, not meant for publication.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/01/09/specials/joyce-lost.html A Lost Work by Joyce Fuels Scholarly Debate&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2013/06/ithys-press-to-release-10-lost-james-joyce-works.html Ithys Press to Release 10 Lost James Joyce Works as Finn's Hotel :: Books :: News :: Paste&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbook.com/literature-nerds-freaking-out-about-lost-james-joyce-collection/ Literature Nerds Freaking Out About ‘Lost’ James Joyce Collection | BlackBook&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the spring of 2014, James O'Sullivan wrote an article for Genetic Joyce Studies, “Finn’s Hotel and the Joycean Canon”, which uses computational stylistics to analyze the text of ''Finn's Hotel'' to determine whether the text is merely early drafts or should be part of Joyce's canon.  O'Sullivan concluded that "the fragments within ''Finn’s Hotel'' are most likely drafts for what became ''Finnegans Wake''" and that statistically "the criticisms of Ithys Press are seemingly upheld."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Sullivan|first1=James|title=Using stylometry to weigh in on the Finn’s Hotel debate|url=http://josullivan.org/using-stylometry-to-weigh-in-on-the-finns-hotel-debate/|website=http://josullivan.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''geographic coordinate system''' is a [[coordinate system]] used in [[geography]] that enables every location on Earth to be specified by a set of numbers, letters or symbols.&lt;ref group=n&gt;In specialized works, "geographic coordinates" are distinguished from other similar coordinate systems, such as geocentric coordinates and geodetic coordinates. See, for example, Sean E. Urban and P. Kenneth Seidelmann, ''Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac, 3rd. ed., (Mill Valley CA: University Science Books, 2013) p. 20&amp;ndash;23.&lt;/ref&gt; The coordinates are often chosen such that one of the numbers represents a [[altitude|vertical position]], and two [[n-vector|or three]] of the numbers represent a [[horizontal position representation|horizontal position]]. A common choice of coordinates is [[latitude]], [[longitude]] and [[elevation]].&lt;ref name=OSGB&gt;{{Citation |title=A guide to coordinate systems in Great Britain |date=Mar 2015 |series=D00659 v2.3 |accessdate=2015-06-22 |publisher=Ordnance Survey |url=http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/docs/support/guide-coordinate-systems-great-britain.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To specify a location on a two-dimensional map requires a [[map projection]].&lt;ref name=Taylor2002&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Chuck|title=Locating a Point On the Earth|url=http://home.hiwaay.net/~taylorc/bookshelf/math-science/geodesy/positioning/index.html|accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of geodesy|history of longitude|history of prime meridians}}
The [[invention]] of a geographic coordinate system is generally credited to [[Eratosthenes]] of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], who composed his now-lost ''[[Geography (Eratosthenes)|Geography]]'' at the [[Library of Alexandria]] in the 3rd century&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=McPhail |first=Cameron |title=Reconstructing Eratosthenes'&lt;!--sic--&gt; Map of the World |pp=20–24 |url=https://ourarchive.otago.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10523/1713/McPhailCameron2011MA.pdf |date=2011 |publisher=University of Otago |location=[[Dunedin]] }}.&lt;/ref&gt; A century later, [[Against the Geography of Eratosthenes|Hipparchus]] of [[Nicaea]] improved on this system by determining latitude from stellar measurements rather than solar altitude and determining longitude by timings of [[lunar eclipse]]s, rather than [[dead reckoning]].  In the 1st or 2nd century, [[Marinus of Tyre|Marinus]] of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] compiled an extensive gazetteer and [[equirectangular projection|mathematically-plotted world map]] using coordinates measured east from a [[prime meridian]] at the westernmost known land, designated the [[Fortunate Isles]], off the coast of western Africa around the Canary or Cape Verde Islands, and measured north or south of the island of [[Rhodes]] off [[Asia Minor]]. [[Ptolemy]] credited him with the full adoption of longitude and latitude, rather than measuring latitude in terms of the length of the [[midsummer]] day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Evans |first=James |title=The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LVp_gkwyvC8C&amp;pg=PA102 |pp=102–103 |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1998 |location=Oxford |isbn=9780199874453}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ptolemy's 2nd-century [[Ptolemy's Geography|''Geography'']] used the same prime meridian but measured latitude from the [[Equator]] instead. After their work was translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in the 9th century, [[Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī|Al-Khwārizmī]]'s ''[[Book of the Description of the Earth]]'' corrected Marinus' and Ptolemy's errors regarding the length of the [[Mediterranean Sea]],{{refn|group=n|The pair had accurate absolute distances within the Mediterranean but underestimated the [[circumference of the Earth]], causing their degree measurements to overstate its length west from Rhodes or Alexandria, respectively.}} causing [[medieval Arabic cartography]] to use a prime meridian around 10° east of Ptolemy's line. Mathematical cartography resumed in Europe following [[Maximus Planudes]]' recovery of Ptolemy's text a little before 1300; the text was translated into [[Latin]] at [[Republic of Florence|Florence]] by [[Jacobus Angelus]] around 1407.&lt;!--more sources at linked pages--&gt;

In 1884, the [[United States]] hosted the [[International Meridian Conference]], attended by representatives from twenty-five nations. Twenty-two of them agreed to adopt the longitude of the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Observatory]] in [[Greenwich, England]] as the zero-reference line. The [[Dominican Republic]] voted against the motion, while France and [[Brazil]] abstained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Greenwich 2000 Limited |url=http://wwp.millennium-dome.com/info/conference.htm |title=The International Meridian Conference |publisher=Wwp.millennium-dome.com |date=9 June 2011 |accessdate=31 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806065207/http://wwp.millennium-dome.com/info/conference.htm |archivedate=6 August 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; France adopted [[Greenwich Mean Time]] in place of local determinations by the [[Paris Observatory]] in 1911.

==Geographic latitude and longitude==

{{Location map-line|lat=0|caption=Equator, the 0° parallel of latitude}}
{{Main|Latitude|Longitude}}
The "latitude" (abbreviation: Lat., [[φ]], or phi) of a point on Earth's surface is the angle between the equatorial plane and the straight line that passes through that point and through (or close to) the center of the Earth.&lt;ref group=n&gt;Alternative versions of latitude and longitude include geocentric coordinates, which measure with respect to Earth's center; geodetic coordinates, which model Earth as an [[ellipsoid]]; and geographic coordinates, which measure with respect to a plumb line at the location for which coordinates are given.&lt;/ref&gt; Lines joining points of the same latitude trace circles on the surface of Earth called [[circle of latitude|parallels]], as they are parallel to the Equator and to each other. The [[North Pole]] is 90°&amp;nbsp;N; the [[South Pole]] is 90°&amp;nbsp;S. The 0° parallel of latitude is designated the [[Equator]], the [[fundamental plane (spherical coordinates)|fundamental plane]] of all geographic coordinate systems. The Equator divides the globe into [[Northern Hemisphere|Northern]] and [[Southern Hemisphere]]s.

{{Location map-line|lon=0|caption=Prime Meridian, the 0° of longitude}}
The "longitude" (abbreviation: Long., [[λ]], or lambda) of a point on Earth's surface is the angle east or west of a reference [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] to another meridian that passes through that point. All meridians are halves of great [[ellipse]]s (often called [[great circle]]s), which converge at the North and South Poles. The meridian of the [[UK|British]] [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Observatory]] in [[Greenwich, England|Greenwich]], in south-east London, England, is the international [[prime meridian]], although some organizations—such as the French [[Institut Géographique National]]—continue to use other meridians for internal purposes. The prime meridian determines the proper [[Eastern Hemisphere|Eastern]] and [[Western Hemisphere]]s, although maps often divide these hemispheres further west in order to keep the [[Old World]] on a single side. The [[Antipodes|antipodal]] meridian of Greenwich is both 180°W and 180°E. This is not to be conflated with the [[International Date Line]], which diverges from it in several places for political reasons, including between far eastern Russia and the far western [[Aleutian Islands]].

The combination of these two components specifies the position of any location on the surface of Earth, without consideration of [[altitude]] or depth. The grid formed by lines of latitude and longitude is known as a "graticule".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jPVxSDzVRP0C&amp;pg=PA224&amp;dq=graticule|title=Glossary of the Mapping Sciences|last=American Society of Civil Engineers|date=1994-01-01|publisher=ASCE Publications|isbn=9780784475706|language=en|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin/zero point of this system is located in the [[Gulf of Guinea]] about {{convert|625|km|sp=us|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} south of [[Tema]], [[Ghana]].

==Measuring height using datums==
{{Main|Geodetic datum|Figure of the Earth|Reference ellipsoid}}

===Complexity of the problem===
To completely specify a location of a topographical feature on, in, or above Earth, one also has to specify the vertical distance from Earth's center or surface.

Earth is not a sphere, but an irregular shape approximating a [[Earth ellipsoid|biaxial ellipsoid]]. It is nearly spherical, but has an equatorial bulge making the radius at the Equator about 0.3% larger than the radius measured through the poles. The shorter axis approximately coincides with the axis of rotation.  Though early navigators thought of the sea as a flat surface that could be used as a vertical datum, this is not actually the case. Earth has a series of layers of equal [[potential energy]] within its [[gravitational field]]. Height is a measurement at right angles to this surface, roughly toward Earth's center, but local variations make the equipotential layers irregular (though roughly ellipsoidal). The choice of which layer to use for defining height is arbitrary.

===Common baselines===
Common height baselines include&lt;ref name=Taylor2002/&gt;
* The surface of the datum ellipsoid, resulting in an ''ellipsoidal height''
* The mean sea level as described by the gravity [[geoid]], yielding the [[orthometric height]]&lt;ref name=OSGB/&gt;&lt;ref name=USDOD&gt;[http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PUBS_LIB/Geodesy4Layman/geo4lay.pdf DMA Technical Report] Geodesy for the Layman, The Defense Mapping Agency, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[vertical datum]], yielding a [[dynamic height]] relative to a known reference height.
Along with the latitude &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; and longitude &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, the height &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; provides the three-dimensional ''geodetic coordinates'' or ''geographic coordinates'' for a location.&lt;ref name=Kowk&gt;{{cite web|last=Kwok|first=Geodetic Survey Section Lands Department  Hong Kong|title=Geodetic Datum Transformation, p.24|url=https://www.geodetic.gov.hk/smo/gsi/data/pdf/transformation.pdf|publisher=Geodetic Survey Section Lands Department  Hong Kong|accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Datums===
In order to be unambiguous about the direction of "vertical" and the "surface" above which they are measuring, map-makers choose a [[reference ellipsoid]] with a given origin and orientation that best fits their need for the area they are mapping. They then choose the most appropriate mapping of the spherical coordinate system onto that ellipsoid, called a terrestrial reference system or [[geodetic datum]].

Datums may be global, meaning that they represent the whole Earth, or they may be local, meaning that they represent an ellipsoid best-fit to only a portion of the Earth. Points on the Earth's surface move relative to each other due to continental plate motion, subsidence, and diurnal [[Earth tide|Earth tidal]] movement caused by the [[Moon]] and the Sun. This daily movement can be as much as a metre. Continental movement can be up to {{nowrap|10 cm}} a year, or {{nowrap|10 m}} in a century. A [[weather system]] high-pressure area can cause a sinking of {{nowrap|5 mm}}. [[Scandinavia]] is rising by {{nowrap|1 cm}} a year as a result of the melting of the ice sheets of the [[Quaternary glaciation|last ice age]], but neighbouring [[Scotland]] is rising by only {{nowrap|0.2 cm}}. These changes are insignificant if a local datum is used, but are statistically significant if a global datum is used.&lt;ref name=OSGB/&gt;

Examples of global datums include [[World Geodetic System]] (WGS 84), the default datum used for the [[Global Positioning System]],&lt;ref group=n&gt;WGS 84 is the default datum used in most GPS equipment, but other datums can be selected.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Terrestrial Reference Frame]] (ITRF), used for estimating [[continental drift]] and [[crustal deformation]].&lt;ref name=Bolstad&gt;{{cite book|last=Bolstad|first=Paul|title=GIS Fundamentals, 5th Edition|publisher=Atlas books|isbn=978-0-9717647-3-6|page=102|url=http://www.paulbolstad.net/5thedition/samplechaps/Chapter3_5th_small.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distance to Earth's center can be used both for very deep positions and for positions in space.&lt;ref name=OSGB/&gt;

Local datums chosen by a national cartographical organisation include the [[North American Datum]], the European [[ED50]], and the British [[OSGB36]]. Given a location, the datum provides the latitude &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; and longitude &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. In the United Kingdom there are three common latitude, longitude, and height systems in use. WGS 84 differs at Greenwich from the one used on published maps [[OSGB36]] by approximately 112m. The military system [[ED50]], used by [[NATO]], differs from about 120m to 180m.&lt;ref name=OSGB/&gt;

The latitude and longitude on a map made against a local datum may not be the same as one obtained from a GPS receiver. Coordinates from the [[Figure of the Earth#Historical Earth ellipsoids|mapping system]] can sometimes be roughly changed into another datum using a simple [[translation]]. For example, to convert from ETRF89 (GPS) to the [[Irish grid reference system|Irish Grid]] add 49 metres to the east, and subtract 23.4 metres from the north.&lt;ref name=irish&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osi.ie/GetAttachment.aspx?id=25113681-c086-485a-b113-bab7c75de6fa |title=Making maps compatible with GPS |publisher=Government of Ireland 1999 |accessdate=15 April 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721130505/http://www.osi.ie/GetAttachment.aspx?id=25113681-c086-485a-b113-bab7c75de6fa |archivedate=21 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally one datum is changed into any other datum using a process called [[Helmert transformation]]s. This involves converting the spherical coordinates into Cartesian coordinates and applying a seven parameter transformation (translation, three-dimensional [[rotation]]), and converting back.&lt;ref name=OSGB/&gt;

In popular GIS software, data projected in latitude/longitude is often represented as a 'Geographic Coordinate System'. For example, data in latitude/longitude if the datum is the [[NAD83|North American Datum of 1983]] is denoted by 'GCS North American 1983'.

{{further|Geographic coordinate conversion}}

== Map projection ==
{{main|Map projection}}

To establish the position of a geographic location on a [[map]], a map projection is used to convert geodetic coordinates to two-dimensional coordinates on a map; it projects the datum ellipsoidal coordinates and height onto a flat surface of a map. The datum, along with a map projection applied to a grid of reference locations, establishes a ''grid system'' for plotting locations. Common map projections in current use include the [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system|Universal Transverse Mercator]] (UTM), the [[Military Grid Reference System]] (MGRS), the [[United States National Grid]] (USNG), the [[Global Area Reference System]] (GARS) and the [[World Geographic Reference System]] (GEOREF).&lt;ref name=NGA_grids&gt;{{cite web|title=Grids and Reference Systems|url=http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/coordsys/grids/referencesys.html|publisher=National Geospatial-Intelligence Agenc|accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Coordinates on a map are usually in terms [[northing]] N and [[easting]] E offsets relative to a specified origin.

Map projection formulas depend in the geometry of the projection as well as parameters dependent on the particular location at which the map is projected. The set of parameters can vary based on type of project and the conventions chosen for the projection. For the [[transverse Mercator projection]] used in UTM, the parameters associated are the latitude and longitude of the natural origin, the false northing and false easting, and an overall scale factor.&lt;ref name=OGP7_2&gt;{{cite web|title=Geomatics Guidance Note Number 7, part 2 Coordinate Conversions and Transformations including Formulas|url=http://info.ogp.org.uk/geodesy/guides/docs/G7-2.pdf|publisher=International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (OGP)|accessdate=5 March 2014|pages=9–10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306005736/http://info.ogp.org.uk/geodesy/guides/docs/G7-2.pdf|archivedate=6 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the parameters associated with particular location or grin, the projection formulas for the transverse Mercator are a complex mix of algebraic and trigonometric functions.{{r|OGP7_2|page1=45-54}}

===UTM and UPS systems===
{{Main|Universal Transverse Mercator|Universal Polar Stereographic}}
The [[Universal Transverse Mercator]] (UTM) and [[Universal Polar Stereographic]] (UPS) coordinate systems both use a metric-based cartesian grid laid out on a [[Map projection#Projections by preservation of a metric property|conformally projected]] surface to locate positions on the surface of the Earth. The UTM system is not a single [[map projection]] but a series of sixty, each covering 6-degree bands of longitude. The UPS system is used for the polar regions, which are not covered by the UTM system.

===Stereographic coordinate system===
{{further|Stereographic projection}}
During medieval times, the stereographic coordinate system was used for navigation purposes.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} The stereographic coordinate system was superseded by the latitude-longitude system. Although no longer used in navigation, the stereographic coordinate system is still used in modern times to describe crystallographic orientations in the fields of [[crystallography]], [[mineralogy]] and materials science.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

==Cartesian coordinates==
{{main|axes conventions}}
Every point that is expressed in ellipsoidal coordinates can be expressed as an rectilinear {{nowrap|x y z}} ([[Cartesian coordinate|Cartesian]]) coordinate. Cartesian coordinates simplify many mathematical calculations.  The Cartesian systems of different datums are not equivalent.&lt;ref name=Taylor2002/&gt;

===Earth-centered, Earth-fixed===
[[File:ECEF.svg|alt=Earth Centered, Earth Fixed coordinates|thumb
|upright=1.3|Earth Centered, Earth Fixed coordinates in relation to latitude and longitude.]]
{{main|ECEF}}

The [[ECEF|earth-centered earth-fixed]] (also known as the ECEF, ECF, or conventional terrestrial coordinate system) rotates with the Earth and has its origin at the center of the Earth.

The conventional right-handed coordinate system puts:
* The origin at the center of mass of the Earth, a point close to the Earth's [[Figure of the Earth|center of figure]]
* The Z axis on the line between the North and South Poles, with positive values increasing northward (but does not exactly coincide with the Earth's rotational axis)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weblab.dlr.de/rbrt/pdf/TN_0001.pdf Note on the BIRD ACS Reference Frames] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718231431/http://www.weblab.dlr.de/rbrt/pdf/TN_0001.pdf |date=18 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The X and Y axes in the plane of the Equator
* The X axis passing through extending from 180 degrees longitude at the Equator (negative) to 0 degrees longitude ([[Prime meridian#IERS Reference Meridian|prime meridian]]) at the Equator (positive)
* The Y axis passing through extending from 90 degrees west longitude at the Equator (negative) to 90 degrees east longitude at the Equator (positive)

An example is the [http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ds_mark.prl?PidBox=aa3449 NGS data] for a brass disk near Donner Summit, in California. Given the dimensions of the ellipsoid, the conversion from lat/lon/height-above-ellipsoid coordinates to X-Y-Z is straightforward—calculate the X-Y-Z for the given lat-lon on the surface of the ellipsoid and add the X-Y-Z vector that is perpendicular to the ellipsoid there and has length equal to the point's height above the ellipsoid. The reverse conversion is harder: given X-Y-Z we can immediately get longitude, but no closed formula for latitude and height exists. &lt;!--, However, --&gt; See "[[Geodetic system#Geodetic to/from ECEF coordinates|Geodetic system]]." Using Bowring's formula in 1976 ''Survey Review'' the first iteration gives latitude correct within 10{{sup|-11}} degree as long as the point is within 10000 meters above or 5000 meters below the ellipsoid.

=== Local east, north, up (ENU) coordinates ===
[[File:ECEF ENU Longitude Latitude relationships.svg|thumb|Earth Centered Earth Fixed and East, North, Up coordinates.]]

In many targeting and tracking applications the local [[East north up|East, North, Up]] (ENU) Cartesian coordinate system is far more intuitive and practical than ECEF or Geodetic coordinates. The local ENU coordinates are formed from a plane tangent to the Earth's surface fixed to a specific location and hence it is sometimes known as a "Local Tangent" or "local geodetic" plane. By convention the east axis is labeled &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, the north &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and the up &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Local north, east, down (NED) coordinates ===

'''Also known as local tangent plane (LTP).''' In an airplane, most objects of interest are below the aircraft, so it is sensible to define down as a positive number.  The [[north east down|North, East, Down]] (NED) coordinates allow this as an alternative to the ENU local tangent plane. By convention, the north axis is labeled &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;, the east &lt;math&gt;y'&lt;/math&gt; and the down &lt;math&gt;z'&lt;/math&gt;. To avoid confusion between &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;, etc. in this article we will restrict the local coordinate frame to ENU.

==Expressing latitude and longitude as linear units==
{{main|Length of a degree of latitude|Length of a degree of longitude}}
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}
On the GRS80 or [[WGS84]] spheroid at [[sea level]] at the Equator, one latitudinal second measures ''30.715 [[metre]]s'', one latitudinal minute is ''1843&amp;nbsp;metres'' and one latitudinal degree is ''110.6&amp;nbsp;kilometres''. The circles of longitude, meridians, meet at the geographical poles, with the west-east width of a second naturally decreasing as latitude increases. On the [[Equator]] at sea level, one longitudinal second measures ''30.92&amp;nbsp;metres'', a longitudinal minute is ''1855&amp;nbsp;metres'' and a longitudinal degree is ''111.3&amp;nbsp;kilometres''. At 30° a longitudinal second is ''26.76&amp;nbsp;metres'', at Greenwich (51°28′38″N) ''19.22&amp;nbsp;metres'', and at 60° it is ''15.42&amp;nbsp;metres''.

On the WGS84 spheroid, the length in meters of a degree of latitude at latitude φ (that is, the distance along a north–south line from latitude (φ − 0.5) degrees to (φ + 0.5) degrees) is about

: &lt;math&gt;111132.92 - 559.82\, \cos 2\varphi + 1.175\, \cos 4\varphi - 0.0023\, \cos 6\varphi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=GISS&gt;[http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/75528/length-of-a-degree-where-do-the-terms-in-this-formula-come-from] Geographic Information Systems - Stackexchange&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the length in meters of a degree of longitude can be calculated as

: &lt;math&gt;111412.84\, \cos \varphi - 93.5\, \cos 3\varphi + 0.118\, \cos 5\varphi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=GISS/&gt;

(Those coefficients can be improved, but as they stand the distance they give is correct within a centimeter.)

An alternative method to estimate the length of a longitudinal degree at latitude &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\varphi}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is to assume a spherical Earth (to get the width per minute and second, divide by 60 and 3600, respectively):

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\pi}{180}M_r\cos \varphi \!&lt;/math&gt;

where [[Earth radius#Meridional Earth radius|Earth's average meridional radius]] &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{M_r}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is {{nowrap|6,367,449 m}}. Since the Earth is not spherical that result can be off by several tenths of a percent; a better approximation of a longitudinal degree at latitude &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\varphi}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{180}a \cos \beta \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where Earth's equatorial radius &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; equals ''6,378,137 m'' and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\tan \beta = \frac{b}{a}\tan\varphi}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;; for the GRS80 and WGS84 spheroids, b/a calculates to be 0.99664719. (&lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\beta}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is known as the [[Latitude#Reduced (or parametric) latitude|reduced (or parametric) latitude]]). Aside from rounding, this is the exact distance along a parallel of latitude; getting the distance along the shortest route will be more work, but those two distances are always within 0.6 meter of each other if the two points are one degree of longitude apart.

&lt;!--The Equator is the [[fundamental plane (spherical coordinates)|fundamental plane]] of all geographic coordinate systems. All spherical coordinate systems define such a fundamental plane.--&gt;

==Geostationary coordinates==
[[Geostationary]] satellites (e.g., television satellites) are over the [[Equator]] at a specific point on Earth, so their position related to Earth is expressed in [[longitude]] degrees only. Their [[latitude]] is always zero (or approximately so), that is, over the Equator.

==On other celestial bodies==
Similar coordinate systems are defined for other celestial bodies such as:
* A similarly well-defined system [[Reference ellipsoid#Ellipsoids for other planetary bodies|based on the reference ellipsoid]] for [[Mars]].
* [[Selenographic coordinates]] for the [[Moon]]

The '''Golden Mic Awards''' ([[Simplified Chinese|Chinese]]: 金唛奖; previously known as '''Singapore Radio Awards''') is an accolade by [[Singapore]]'s [[MediaCorp]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediacorp.sg]&lt;/ref&gt; to recognize excellence of presenters and producers in MediaCorp Radio. Although the moniker Singapore may suggest a representation of all radio stations in Singapore, the nominations are only open to deejay talents from MediaCorp Radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest%252BNews/Showbiz/Story/A1Story20120212-327429.html|title='Singapore' dropped from Radio Awards|date=13 February 2012|publisher=AsiaOne|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was previously known as the Singapore Radio Awards from 2005 to 2011.

==History==
Prior to the SRA, the three Chinese radio stations ([[Y.E.S. 93.3FM]], [[Capital 95.8FM]] and [[Love 97.2FM]]) under MediaCorp held their own "Golden Mike Awards" (GMA). The last GMA was held in 2004 and the SRA was born a few months later to encompass stations from all four languages that MediaCorp broadcast in: English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil.

The first SRA was held in 2005, and was renamed MRA in 2013.

==Ceremony==
The first SRA ceremony was held in 2004 at Raffles City Convention Centre.&lt;ref&gt;11 Nov 2004, Today Newspaper, Singapore&lt;/ref&gt; It was a trade event, whereby clients of MediaCorp were invited for a formal sit down dinner. Listeners were not invited to the show. 

The 2nd SRA was held in 2005 in [[Shangri La Hotel]]'s Island Ballroom. The 3rd SRA was held at the same location in 2006. Similarly, only trade clients were invited.&lt;ref&gt;29 Sep, Today Newspaper, Singapore&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1 Jul, Today Newspaper, Singapore&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 4th SRA in 2007 was held at Suntec Convention Centre. For the first time, listeners were invited to purchase tickets to attend.&lt;ref&gt;28 Nov 2007, Today Newspaper, Singapore&lt;/ref&gt; All nominees were involved in the opening sequence. 

The SRA discontinued in 2008 and 2009. 

[[Singapore Radio Awards 2010]] was held in MediaCorp's TV Theatre, with a live webcast on its official site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.singaporeradioawards.sg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919040902/http://www.singaporeradioawards.sg/ |date=2010-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Florence Lian]], former radio DJ and Singapore Idol judge, currently MediaCorp's Managing Director for Radio, opened the show with a monologue. The hosts were [[Vernon A]] and [[Justin Ang]] from [[987FM]]. Award presenters included [[Irene Ang]], Bobby Tonelli, as well as MediaCorp's senior management.&lt;ref&gt;20 Mar, Today Newspaper, Singapore&lt;/ref&gt;

987FM were the biggest winners for the night, sweeping "Best Radio Show", "Most Creative English Trailer", and "Best Radio Personality Blog".

Singapore Radio Awards 2011 was telecast live on Channel 5. 

MediaCorp Radio Awards 2013 will be held on 15 November. The show will be telecast live on Channel 5.

==Nomination==
All weekday presenters were automatically nominated for the "Most Popular DJ" Award for the respective stations. The results are based on SMS polling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.singaporeradioawards.sg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919040902/http://www.singaporeradioawards.sg/ |date=2010-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nominees for other awards were selected by a panel of professionals in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.singaporeradioawards.sg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919040902/http://www.singaporeradioawards.sg/ |date=2010-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Novo-Mihailovsky Palace (Saint Petersburg) 2012.jpg|300px|thumb|The [[Novo-Mikhailovsky Palace]] on [[Palace Quay]], the home to the Institute of Oriental Manuscripts]]
The '''Institute of Oriental Manuscripts''' ('''IOM''') of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] ('''RAS'''; {{lang-ru|Институт восточных рукописей Российской академии наук}}), formerly the St. Petersburg Branch of the [[Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences]], is a research institute in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]] that houses various collections of manuscripts and early printed material in Asian languages, including [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]], and [[Tangut language|Tangut]].

==History==
{{Main|Asiatic Museum}}
The origins of the IOM date back to 1818, when the Russian Academy of Sciences learned that Louis-Jacques Rousseau (1780–1831), the French consul at [[Aleppo]] and [[Tripoli]] (then both part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]), was selling his extensive collection of manuscripts written in the [[Arabic script]].  In November of that year, the president of the RAS, Count [[Sergey Uvarov]], wrote to the Board of the RAS requesting that a separate room be put aside in the Academy's [[cabinet of curiosities]] for storing this collection of manuscripts (which was eventually purchased by the RAS in two tranches, in 1819 and 1825), as well as other medals, manuscripts and books of oriental origin already in the Museum of the Imperial Academy of Science.  The result was the establishment of the [[Asiatic Museum]] ({{lang-ru|Азиатский музей}}) of the RAS, in Saint Petersburg.&lt;ref name="iom-history"&gt;{{Cite web | last=Popova | first=Irina F. | title=History of the Institute of Oriental Manuscripts | url=http://www.orientalstudies.ru/eng/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=46&amp;Itemid=82 | publisher=Institute of Oriental Manuscripts | date=10 June 2005 | accessdate=2012-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iom-arabic"&gt;{{Cite web | last=Khalidov | first=A. B. | title=Historical Account of the Formation of the Collection of Arabic Manuscripts and Their Study | url=http://www.orientalstudies.ru/eng/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1220 | publisher=Institute of Oriental Manuscripts | date=1 May 2006 | accessdate=2012-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Asiatic Museum quickly established itself as the main institute for the collection and study of oriental manuscripts and books in Russia, as well as a major international centre for oriental studies, and by the time of the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917, almost a hundred years after its foundation, it housed one of the most extensive collections of oriental manuscripts and printed books in the world.  Following the Russian Revolution, the Asiatic Museum continued under the same name until May 1930, when the [[Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences|Institute of Oriental Studies]] (IOS) of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR was founded, and the Asiatic Museum was incorporated into this new institute.  The IOS was originally located within the [[Library of the Russian Academy of Sciences]] in Leningrad (the name for Saint Petersburg during the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era), but in 1949 it moved to its own premises in one wing of the [[New Michael Palace]] (the other wing was occupied by the [[Institute for the History of Material Culture of the Russian Academy of Sciences|Institute for the History of Material Culture]]).  Then two years later, in 1951, the institute was relocated to its own premises in [[Moscow]].  However, for practical reasons the institute's main library and its collections of manuscripts and early printed books remained at the New Michael Palace in Leningrad as the Department of Oriental Manuscripts of the IOS.&lt;ref name="iom-history"/&gt;

Five years after the move of the IOS to Moscow, in February 1956, the Department of Oriental Manuscripts in Leningrad was reconstituted as the Leningrad Branch of the IOS.  Whereas the main Moscow branch of the IOS concentrated on modern studies, the Leningrad branch specialized in the study of ancient and medieval oriental history, literature and languages, as well as in the production of critical editions of texts in its collections.&lt;ref name="iom-history"/&gt;

After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, it continued as a branch of the IOS, albeit now renamed the Saint Petersburg Branch of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, until 2007.  In 2007 the Saint Petersburg branch separated from the IOS to become an independent institute under the RAS.  The new institute, which assumed the title of Institute of Oriental Manuscripts in late 2009, continues to occupy one wing of the New Michael Palace.&lt;ref name="archeobibliobase"&gt;{{Cite web | title=ArcheoBiblioBase: Archives in Russia: E-30: Institut vostochnykh rukopisei RAN (IVR) | url=http://www.iisg.nl/abb/rep/E-30.tab2.php | publisher=[[International Institute of Social History]] | accessdate=2012-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
The IOM has a collection of more than 100,000 manuscripts and early printed books, encompassing about 65 different languages, including [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Ge'ez language|Ethiopian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Manchu language|Manchu]], [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]], [[Tajik language|Tajik]], [[Tangut language|Tangut]], [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]], [[Old Turkic language|Turkic]], and [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]].&lt;ref name="iom-history"/&gt;

===Arabic collection===
[[Image:Shah soleiman safavi.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|Miniature]] of [[Suleiman I of Persia]] by [[Aliquli Jabbadar]] (IOM Album E 14, folio 89). The manuscript was acquired by [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]] in 1909, and transferred from the [[Russian Museum]] to the Asiatic Museum in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Lukonin | first1=Vladimir Grigorʹevich | last2=Ivanov | first2=Anatoliĭ Alekseevich | last3=Ėrmitazh | first3=Gosudarstvennyĭ | title=Lost Treasures of Persia: Persian Art in the Hermitage Museum | publisher=Mage | year=1996 | isbn=978-0-934211-49-9 | page=231 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The foundation for the manuscript collection at the Asiatic Museum were some 700 Arabic script manuscripts belonging to Jean-Baptiste Louis-Jacques Rousseau that were acquired in 1819 (500 manuscripts) and 1826 (200 manuscripts).  The first director of the Asiatic Museum, Christian Martin Frähn, augmented the museum's holdings in Arabic manuscripts, and by 1828 the museum housed some 851 Arabic, Persian and Turkic manuscripts.  However, the collection of Arabic manuscripts did not grow substantially until the early 20th century.  In 1915, [[Vladimir Alexeyevich Ivanov]] purchased some 1,057 manuscripts from [[Bukhara]], and in 1916–1917, S. V. Ter-Avetisyan, curator of the [[Simon Janashia Museum of Georgia|Caucasian Museum]] in [[Tbilisi]], sent a large number of manuscripts that he had collected to the Asiatic Museum, including more than a thousand Arabic manuscripts.&lt;ref name="iom-arabic"/&gt;

===Tibetan collection===
The IOM has one of the largest collections of Tibetan books and manuscripts in the world, comprising over 20,000 catalogued items, as well as many as yet uncatalogued items.  The history of the collection dates back to the 1720s when Tibetan texts from a ruined monastery along the [[Irtysh River]] were brought back to Saint Petersburg.  During the 18th and 19th centuries more Tibetan and Tibeto-Mongolian woodblock-printed books were collected from [[Buryats|Buryat]] monasteries in [[Siberia]].  Other Tibetan and Mongolian books were sent back to Russia by members of the Russian Spiritual Mission in China during the 19th century. By the start of the 20th century the Asiatic Museum had the largest collection of Tibetan books and manuscripts in Europe, but it was still deficient in some areas.  The remaining gaps in the collection were filled by [[Gombojab Tsybikov]] and B. Baradiyn (1878–1937) who visited Tibet in 1899–1902 and 1905–1907 respectively.&lt;ref name="iom-tibetan"&gt;{{Cite web | last=Zorin | first=Alexander | title=Manuscript Collection&amp;nbsp;— Tibetan part  | url=http://www.orientalstudies.ru/eng/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2065 | publisher=Institute of Oriental Manuscripts | date=20 April 2008 | accessdate=2012-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manuscripts from Khara-khoto===
The IOM holds the world's foremost collection of manuscripts written in the extinct [[Tangut language]], which were collected by the explorer [[Pyotr Kozlov]] from the [[Western Xia]] fortress city of [[Khara-Khoto]] in [[Inner Mongolia]] during 1907–1909.  The city had been abandoned in the late 14th century, and had been largely buried in sand for several hundred years.&lt;ref name="idp-news-02"&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Khara-Khoto&amp;nbsp;— The Black City | journal=IDP News | issue=2 | date=January 1995 | issn=1354-5914 | url=http://idp.bl.uk/archives/news02/idpnews_02.a4d }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kozlov unearthed thousands of manuscripts and woodblock prints, mostly written in the dead [[Tangut script]], which had been preserved beneath the sands of Khara-Khoto.  The manuscripts, books and archaeological artefacts that Kozlov brought back from Khara-Khoto were originally housed in the museum of [[Alexander III of Russia]] in Saint Petersburg, but the manuscripts and printed books were transferred to the Asiatic Museum in 1911.&lt;ref name="kychanov-1994"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Kychanov | first=Evgenij Ivanovich | authorlink=Evgenij Ivanovich Kychanov | title=俄藏黑水城文献 |trans-title=Heishuicheng Manuscripts Collected in the St.Petersburg Branch of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences | publisher=Shanghai Guji Chubanshe | volume=1 | chapter=preface | year=1996–2000 | isbn=7-5325-2036-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to the several thousand Tangut texts, the Kozlov Collection includes about 660 manuscripts and printed books in Chinese, mostly Buddhist texts, as well as about 120 Tibetan texts.&lt;ref name="russian-collections"&gt;{{Cite web | title=Russian Collections | url=http://idp.bl.uk/pages/collections_ru.a4d | publisher=International Dunhuang Project | accessdate=2012-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manuscripts from Turpan and Dunhuang===
[[Sergey Oldenburg]], director of the Asiatic Museum from 1916, made two expeditions to Central Asia (1909–1910 and 1914–1915).  During the first expedition Oldenburg explored a number of sites around [[Turpan]], including [[Qigexing Buddhist Temple Ruins|Shikchin]], [[Jiaohe Ruins|Yarkhoto]] and [[Kucha]], and collected murals, paintings, terracottas, and about one hundred manuscripts, mostly fragments written in the Brahmi script.  During his second expedition Oldenburg surveyed the [[Mogao Caves]] at Dunhuang, and revisited some of the sites in Turpan that he had visited during his first expedition.  He found a large number of artefacts and manuscript fragments (nearly 20,000 fragments, some of them tiny) at Dunhuang, and also purchased about 300 scrolls from local people.&lt;ref name="russian-collections"/&gt;  The IOM holds the more than 19,000 manuscript fragments and 365 manuscript scrolls collected from Dunhuang by Oldenburg, as well as about thirty manuscripts collected by [[Sergey Malov]] during an expedition to [[Khotan]] during 1909–1910, and some 183 Uyghur manuscripts collected by N. N. Krotkov, the Russian Consul in [[Urumqi]] and [[Ghulja]].&lt;ref name="russian-collections"/&gt;

The '''International Humanist and Ethical Union''' ('''IHEU''') is an umbrella organisation of [[Humanism|humanist]], [[atheist]], [[rationalist]], [[secular]], [[skeptic]], [[freethought]] and [[Ethical Culture]] organisations worldwide.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iheu.org/about |title= About IHEU|accessdate=2007-11-12 |publisher= IHEU }}&lt;/ref&gt; British philosopher and biologist [[Julian Huxley]] (also the first director of [[UNESCO]]) presided over the founding Congress of the IHEU in [[Amsterdam]], 1952; Dutch philosopher and politician [[Jaap van Praag]] became its first chairman until 1975.

The IHEU works "to build and represent the global Humanist movement that defends human rights and promotes Humanist values world-wide."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/about/about-iheu/|title=IHEU {{!}} About IHEU|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the IHEU General Assembly unanimously adopted the [[Amsterdam Declaration 2002|Amsterdam Declaration]] 2002, which presents as the "official defining statement of World Humanism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iheu.org/content/amsterdam-declaration-2002|title=Amsterdam Declaration 2002|publisher=IHEU|accessdate=2013-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Happy Human]] is the official symbol of the IHEU.

IHEU holds a [[World Humanist Congress]] usually every three years. The next is to be held in [[Miami]], [[United States]], in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://iheu.org/about/general-assembly/|title=General Assembly {{!}} IHEU|work=IHEU|access-date=2017-08-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humanism as a life stance==
In 2002 at the IHEU's 50th anniversary World Humanist Congress, delegates unanimously passed a resolution known as the [[Amsterdam Declaration]] 2002, an update of the original Amsterdam Declaration (1952).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Freethought resource guide: a directory of information, literature, art, organizations, &amp; internet sites related to secular humanism, skepticism, atheism, &amp; agnosticism|last=Vandebrake|first=Mark|publisher=CreateSpace|isbn=9781475020359|location=Austin, Texas|pages=Appendix A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amsterdam Declaration defines Humanism as a "[[Life stance|lifestance]]" that is "ethical", "rational", supportive of "democracy and human rights", insisting "that personal liberty must be combined with social responsibility"; it is "an alternative to dogmatic religion"; it values "artistic creativity and imagination" and is aimed at living lives of "fulfillment" through the powers of "free inquiry", "science" and "creative imagination".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/humanism/the-amsterdam-declaration/|title=IHEU {{!}} The Amsterdam Declaration|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the [[Amsterdam Declaration]]'s "official statement of World Humanism", the IHEU provides a "Minimum Statement on Humanism":&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/humanism/what-is-humanism/|title=IHEU {{!}} What is Humanism?|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Humanism is a [[democracy|democratic]] and [[ethical]] life stance, which affirms that human beings have the right and responsibility to give meaning and shape to their own lives. It stands for the building of a more humane society through an ethic based on human and other natural values in the spirit of reason and free inquiry through human capabilities. It is not [[theism|theistic]], and it does not accept [[supernatural]] views of reality.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Member Organisations of the IHEU are required according to IHEU's membership regulations to have objects that are "consistent" with this understanding of Humanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/newsite/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Regulations-on-membership-categories-and-dues.docx|title=Regulations on membership categories and dues|last=|first=|date=|website=Iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Humanism}}

=== Other major resolutions ===
In 2010, in an "unprecedented alliance"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/sakulare-werte-fur-europa-brusseler-erklarung-zu-wurde-gleichheit-und-freiheit-153481705.html|title=Säkuläre Werte für Europa: Brüsseler Erklärung zu Würde, Gleichheit und Freiheit /PR Newswire UK/|last=Choice|first=Catholics for a Free|website=www.prnewswire.co.uk|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the IHEU, the [[European Humanist Federation]] and [[Catholics for Choice]], launched the [[European Humanist Federation#A Vision for Europe and the Brussels Declaration|Brussels Declaration]], a secular response to a proposed [[Berlin Declaration (2007)|Berlin Declaration]], under which the [[Treaty of Lisbon|amended EU Constitution]] would have made references to "[[God]]" and the "[[Christianity|Christian]] roots of Europe".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://humanistfederation.eu/ckfinder/userfiles/files/position/Secular%20europe/The%20Brussels%20Declaration.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=10 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214104351/http://humanistfederation.eu/ckfinder/userfiles/files/position/Secular%20europe/The%20Brussels%20Declaration.pdf |archive-date=14 February 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At World Humanist Congress 2011, in Norway, the IHEU General Assembly adopted The Oslo Declaration on Peace, which concludes: "We urge each of our member organizations and Humanists globally to work for a more peaceful culture in their own nations and urge all governments to prefer the peaceful settlement of conflicts over the alternative of violence and war."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/oslo-declaration-peace/|title=IHEU {{!}} The Oslo Declaration on Peace|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At World Humanist Congress 2014, in the United Kingdom, the IHEU General Assembly adopted The Oxford Declaration on Freedom of Thought and Expression, which asserts: "Freedom of thought implies the right to develop, hold, examine and manifest our beliefs without coercion, and to express opinions and a worldview whether religious or non-religious, without fear of coercion. It includes the right to change our views or to reject beliefs previously held, or previously ascribed. Pressure to conform to ideologies of the state or to doctrines of religion is a tyranny."&lt;ref&gt;[http://iheu.org/oxford-declaration-on-freedom-of-thought-and-expression/ IHEU, ''Oxford Declaration on Freedom of Thought and Expression'', 12 August 2014]. Retrieved 18 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organisation ==

=== Founding in 1952 ===
Five Humanist organisations, the [[American Ethical Union]], [[American Humanist Association]], British Ethical Union (later the British Humanist Association and now [[Humanists UK]]), Vienna Ethical Society and the Dutch Humanist league hosted the founding congress of the IHEU in Amsterdam, 22–27 August 1952.&lt;ref name="IHEU1952"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iheu.org/content/1850-1952-road-founding-congress|title=1850-1952: The road to the founding congress|publisher=IHEU|accessdate=2 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811030040/http://iheu.org/content/1850-1952-road-founding-congress|archivedate=11 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Skepticism and humanism : the new paradigm|last=Kurtz|first=Paul|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=2001|isbn=0765800519|location=New Brunswick, NJ [u.a.]|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the last day of the congress five resolutions were passed, which included a statement of the fundamentals of "modern, ethical Humanism", a resolution which would come to be known as the [[Amsterdam Declaration]] (1952).&lt;ref name="IHEU1952" /&gt;

=== Current structure ===
[[File:IHEYO logo.png|thumb|left|150px|IHEYO logo.]]
The IHEU is a democratic organisation,&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; the Board of which is elected by representatives of the Member Organisations at annual General Assemblies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/about/general-assembly/|title=IHEU {{!}} General Assembly|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The President as of 2015 is [[Andrew Copson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://humanism.org.uk/2015/06/01/andrew-copson-elected-new-president-of-the-international-humanist-and-ethical-union/|title=Andrew Copson elected new President of the International Humanist and Ethical Union|date=2015-06-01|website=British Humanist Association|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; (who is also the Chief Executive of [[Humanists UK]] as of 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://humanism.org.uk/about/our-people/staff/|title=Senior Staff|date=2012-04-27|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IHEU headquarters is in London, sharing an office with Humanists UK.

Representatives of IHEU Member Organisations ratify new memberships annually during a General Assembly. Following the 2017 General Assembly, the IHEU listed its membership as 139 Member Organisations from 53 countries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/membership/our-members/?page=CiviCRM&amp;q=civicrm/profile&amp;page=CiviCRM&amp;gid=4&amp;force=1&amp;crmSID=4_u&amp;crmRowCount=25&amp;crmPID=1|title=IHEU {{!}} Our members|last=|first=|date=|website=iheu.org|access-date=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; from a variety of non-religious traditions.

A staff of four is headed by the current Chief Executive, Gary McLelland, and the IHEU maintains delegations to the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] in Geneva, the [[Headquarters of the United Nations|United Nations in New York]], and the [[Council of Europe]] in Strasbourg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/about/staff-and-representatives/|title=IHEU {{!}} Staff and Representatives|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IHEU is an international [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] with Special Consultative Status with the [[United Nations]], General Consultative Status at the [[Council of Europe]], Observer Status with the [[African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights]], and maintains operational relations with [[UNESCO]].

IHEU has a wing for people aged up to 35 called the [[International Humanist and Ethical Youth Organisation]] (IHEYO).

The name of the IHEU may soon change, as delegates at the organization's 2017 General Assembly passed a resolution "mandating the Board to oversee a transition to a revised identity for the organization".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://iheu.org/tears-joy-iheu-general-assembly-2017/|title=Tears and joy at IHEU General Assembly 2017|date=2017-08-10|work=IHEU|access-date=2017-08-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strategy and activities ==
The aim of the IHEU is to "build, support and represent the global humanist movement, defending human rights, particularly those of non-religious people, and promoting humanist values world-wide".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/about/vision-and-mission/|title=IHEU {{!}} Vision and mission|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a campaigning NGO the IHEU aims "to influence international policy through representation and information, to build the humanist network, and let the world know about the worldview of Humanism."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== The Freedom of Thought Report ===
[[File:Freedom of Thought Report 2016 cover image.png|thumb|Cover of the downloadable 2016 edition of the IHEU Freedom of Thought Report - Key Countries Edition]]
In 2012 the IHEU began publishing an annual report on "discrimination against humanists, atheists and the non-religious" called The Freedom of Thought Report.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/new-global-report-discrimination-against-non-religious/|title=IHEU {{!}} New global report on discrimination against the non-religious|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report centres around a "Country Index" with a textual entry for every [[sovereign state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://freethoughtreport.com/countries/|title=Country Index|last=|first=|date=|website=Freedom of Thought Report|access-date=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each country is measured against a list of 64 boundary conditions, which are categorised into four thematic categories ("Constitution and government", "Education and children's rights", "Family, community, society, religious courts and tribunals", and "Freedom of expression, advocacy of humanist values") at five levels of overall "severity" ("Free and equal", "Mostly satisfactory", "Systemic discrimination", "Severe discrimination" and "Grave violations").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://freethoughtreport.com/ratings-system/|title=The Ratings System|last=|first=|date=|website=Freedom of Thought Report|access-date=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 64 boundary conditions include for example: "‘Apostasy’ or conversion from a specific religion is outlawed and punishable by death", which is placed at the worst level of severity, and under the category "Freedom of expression", and: "There is state funding of at least some religious schools", which is a middle severity condition, under the category "Education and children's rights". The data from the report is freely available under a [[Creative Commons license]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://freethoughtreport.com/data/|title=Open Data|last=|first=|date=|website=Freedom of Thought Report|access-date=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Findings of the Freedom of Thought Report ====
In 2017, the report found that 30 countries meet at least one boundary condition at the most severe level ("Grave violations"), and a further 55 countries met at least one boundary condition in the next most severe level ("Severe discrimination").&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
[[File:Map of discrimination against the non-religious in the IHEU Freedom of Thought Report.png|alt=Map of results from the IHEU Freedom of Thought Report|center|thumb|500x500px|This composite map overlays the results from four separate categories of assessment in the IHEU Freedom of Thought Report, as to how countries discriminate against non-religious people. Countries block-filled in darker, redder colors are rated more severely in the report, while lighter, greener shades are more "free and equal".]]

==== Responses to the Freedom of Thought Report ====
The various annual editions of the Freedom of Thought Report have been reported in the media under headlines such as: "How the right to deny the existence of God is under threat globally" (the [[The Independent|Independent]], UK);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/how-the-right-to-deny-the-existence-of-god-is-under-threat-globally-9913662.html|title=The right to deny the existence of God is under threat|date=2014-12-09|newspaper=The Independent|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Most countries fail to respect rights of atheists – report" ([[Christian Today]]); and "[[Stephen Fry]]'s mockery of religion could land him the death penalty in these countries" (the [[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/02/05/stephen-frys-mockery-of-religion-could-land-him-the-death-penalty-in-these-countries/|title=Stephen Fry's mockery of religion could land him the death penalty in these countries|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report has received coverage in the national media of countries that are severely criticised, for example "Malaysia's free thought, religious expression under 'serious assault', study shows" (the [[Malay Mail]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/malaysias-free-thought-religious-expression-under-serious-assault-study-sho|title=Malaysia's free thought, religious expression under ‘serious assault’, study shows|date=2015-12-21|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forewords and prefaces to the various annual editions of report have been written by then-[[United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief|United Nations Special Rapporteurs on Freedom of Religion or Belief]], [[Heiner Bielefeldt]], in 2012; two victims of "blasphemy" accusations, [[Kacem El Ghazzali]] and [[Alber Saber]] in 2013; human rights defenders [[Gulalai Ismail]] and Agnes Ojera in 2014; humanist activist and survivor of an [[Attacks by Islamic extremists in Bangladesh#Attacks on secularists|anti-secularist machete attack in Bangladesh]], [[Rafida Ahmed Bonya]] (2015); and [[United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief|United Nations Special Rapporteurs on Freedom of Religion or Belief]], [[Ahmed Shaheed]], in 2016. In 2015 and 2016 the annual edition of the Freedom of Thought Report was launched at the [[European Parliament]] in [[Brussels]] hosted by the [[Intergroups in the European Parliament|European Parliamentary Intergroup]] on Freedom of Religion or Belief and Religious Tolerance chaired by [[Dennis de Jong|Dennis de Jong MEP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.religiousfreedom.eu/2015/12/10/forb-free-thought-report-intergroup-meeting/|title=FoRB Free Thought Report Intergroup meeting {{!}} Religious Freedom {{!}} European Parliament Intergroup|access-date=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.religiousfreedom.eu/2016/12/06/new-report-shows-persecution-of-adherents-of-non-theistic-and-atheist-beliefs-in-the-world-on-the-rise/|title=New report shows: Persecution of adherents of non-theistic and atheist beliefs in the world on the rise {{!}} Religious Freedom {{!}} European Parliament Intergroup|access-date=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his foreword to the first edition of the Freedom of Thought Report, [[Heiner Bielefeldt]] wrote: "As a universal human right, freedom of religion or belief has a broad application. However, there seems to be little awareness that this right also provides a normative frame of reference for atheists, humanists and freethinkers and their convictions, practices and organizations. I am therefore delighted that for the first time the Humanist community has produced a global report on discrimination against atheists. I hope it will be given careful consideration by everyone concerned with freedom of religion or belief."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://freethoughtreport.com/|title=Freedom of Thought Report {{!}} Documenting discrimination against the non-religious around the world|website=freethoughtreport.com|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a panel event at the [[European Parliament]] for the launch of the 2015 edition, Bielefeldt said he "unambiguously welcomed" the report and reiterated with regard to "[[freedom of religion or belief]]" that it is "only a kind of short-hand", and "Formulations such as "religious freedom" obfuscate the scope of this human right which covers the identity-shaping, profound convictions and conviction-based practices of human beings broadly."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/iheus-freedom-of-thought-report-2015-why-should-we-pamper-saudi-arabia-for-oil/|title=IHEU {{!}} IHEU's Freedom of Thought Report 2015… "Why should we pamper Saudi Arabia for oil?"|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report was the subject of a question in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] in 2013, to which [[David Lidington]] MP responded for the government asserting, "Our freedom of religion or belief policy is consistent with the key message of the International Humanist and Ethical Union's (IHEU) report: that international human rights law exists to protect the rights of individuals to manifest their beliefs, not to protect the beliefs themselves. The report records a sharp increase in the number of prosecutions for alleged criticism of religion by atheists on social media. Protecting freedom of expression online is a priority for the British Government and we have consistently argued against attempts to create a new international standard in order to protect religions from criticism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/text/131014w0005.htm#13101522000057|title=House of Commons Hansard Written Answers for 14 Oct 2013  (pt 0005)|last=Westminster|first=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Commons,|website=www.publications.parliament.uk|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Freedom of Thought Report and Islamophobia ====

The IHEU denies it is an Islamophobic organisation, and that its criticism of the tenets of Islam is an acceptable use of freedom of speech &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://iheu.org/criticism-of-islamic-tenets-not-the-same-as-islamophobia-argues-iheu/ |title=Criticism of Islamic tenets not the same as Islamophobia, argues IHEU }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The 2018 Freedom of Thought report &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://freethoughtreport.com/download-the-report/ |title=The Freedom of Thought Report 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which focuses mainly on the treatment of religious and non-religious minorities in Muslim countries, has, however, been condemned for being openly Islamophobic in its coverage of the application of ''[[Sharia]]''-based laws in the Islamic Republic of Iran &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.shiachat.com/forum/topic/235060135-humanist-organisation-iheu-publishes-islamophobic-report/ |title= Humanist organisation (IHEU) publishes Islamophobic report}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The report, which was largely unsourced, and whose research methodology is not given, cited the "testimony" of an atheist woman claiming that atheists in Iran were being sentenced to death for admitting their lack of belief: no cases involving the prosecution of persons in Iran simply for declaring their atheism have been reported by civil rights groups. The report also made a number of other spurious and dubious claims such as that members of the Baha'i sect, which is not recognised as a religion in Iran, could be killed with impunity under Islamic law and that atheists could be put to death for the crime of ''[[Moharebeh]]'' (waging war on God), even though this refers only to those who violently taken up arms against the authorities and not the non-religious or religious dissenters. Like many other human rights groups, the report confuses ''[[Sharia]]'' - the Muslim code of practice and way of life - with the implementation of corporal punishments (Hadd/Hudud) such as flogging and amputation. Muslims have repeatedly objected to the way in which the ''[[Sharia]]'' that they follow is caricatured in terms of certain physical penalties like these &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/beliefs/sharia_1.shtml |title=BBC Sharia}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Focus of advocacy and campaigns ===
Recurring themes of the IHEU's advocacy and campaigns work include [[LGBTI rights]] and [[women's rights]], [[sexual and reproductive health and rights]], laws against [[blasphemy]] and [[apostasy]], [[caste]]-based discrimination, [[slavery]], and advocacy of [[secularism]].

==== Persecuted non-religious individuals ====

Individuals persecuted for expressing their non-religious views (actual or perceived) have frequently been the subject of IHEU campaigns. Some prominent cases include:
* In the 1990s IHEU was instrumental in highlighting the threats against [[Taslima Nasrin]] who lives in exile from [[Bangladesh]], and who also acted as a representative of the IHEU at [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/taslima-nasrins-visit-india/|title=IHEU {{!}} Taslima Nasrin's Visit to India|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The IHEU and [[Amnesty International]] led the campaign in 2004 to try to obtain the release of [[Younus Shaikh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.hindu.com/2004/01/28/stories/2004012812620400.htm | title = Ethical approach to a humane cause | publisher = [[The Hindu]] | date = January 28, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who was accused of "[[blasphemy]]" in [[Pakistan]].
* In 2013 the IHEU urged the authorities in [[Egypt]] to ensure the safety of [[Alber Saber]] after he was accused of "offending religion" for allegedly linking to the [[YouTube]] video "[[Innocence of Muslims]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/iheu-urges-calm-and-safeguarding-alber-saber-while-bail/|title=IHEU {{!}} IHEU urges calm and safeguarding of Alber Saber while on bail|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2014 the IHEU blew the whistle on the case of [[Irreligion in Nigeria|Mubarak Bala]] from [[Nigeria]], who was detained in a psychiatric hospital after he talked openly about being an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-28010234|title=Nigeria atheist Bala 'deemed mentally ill' in Kano state|date=2014-06-25|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-08-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/25/nigerian-man-locked-up-atheist|title=Nigerian man is locked up after saying he is an atheist|last=Smith|first=David|date=2014-06-25|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-08-18|last2=correspondent|first2=Africa|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was freed following international media coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-28158813|title=Nigeria atheist Bala freed from Kano psychiatric hospital|date=2014-07-04|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-08-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2017, after a government minister in [[Malaysia]] said members of an atheist meetup group would be "hunted down"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/malaysia-government-minister-atheists-hunted-down-reeducated-religious-freedom-shahidan-kassim-a7884766.html|title=Government minister wants to 'hunt down' atheists in Malaysia|date=2017-08-09|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-08-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the IHEU called for respect of the atheists' human rights&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://iheu.org/iheu-deplores-backlash-hunt-atheists-malaysia/|title=IHEU deplores backlash and "hunt" against atheists in Malaysia|date=2017-08-08|work=IHEU|access-date=2017-08-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the organization's condemnation of the minister's remarks was reported in Malaysian media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/minister-violating-human-rights-by-hunting-atheists-says-humanist-group|title=Minister violating human rights by ‘hunting’ atheists, says humanist group|date=2017-08-09|access-date=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The IHEU delegation at the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] has repeatedly raised the imprisonment and corporal punishment of [[Raif Badawi]] for "insulting religion",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/?s=raif+badawi|title=IHEU {{!}} Search Results: raif badawi|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Waleed Abulkhair]] for "disrespecting the authorities",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/?s=waleed|title=IHEU {{!}} Search Results: waleed|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; both in [[Saudi Arabia]].

The IHEU similarly highlights cases where individuals are accused of "[[apostasy]]", such as the blogger [[Mohamed Cheikh Ould Mkhaitir]] currently on death row in [[Mauritania]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/iheu-condemns-death-sentence-for-apostasy-handed-to-writer-in-mauritania/|title=IHEU {{!}} IHEU condemns death sentence for "apostasy", handed to writer in Mauritania|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the poet [[Ashraf Fayadh]] currently imprisoned in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/death-for-apostasy-must-not-stand-free-ashraf-fayadh/|title=IHEU {{!}} Death for "apostasy" must not stand! Free Ashraf Fayadh|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016 at the 32nd session of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|Human Rights Council]] the IHEU's delegate took the unusual step of reading one of Ashraf Fayadh's poems during General Debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/iheu-reads-poem-banned-in-saudi-for-apostasy-to-delegates-at-un/|title=IHEU {{!}} IHEU reads poem banned in Saudi for ‘apostasy’ to delegates at UN|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bangladesh machete murders ====
{{See also|Attacks by Islamic extremists in Bangladesh}}
The IHEU complained that fundamentalists linked to the government were "terrorising" secular activists, including individuals in connection with IHEU Member Organisations, as far back as 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/bangladesh-secular-intellectuals-terrorised-islamic-fundamentalists/|title=IHEU {{!}} Bangladesh: secular intellectuals terrorised by Islamic fundamentalists|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Attacks by Islamic extremists in Bangladesh|a series of machete attacks primarily targeting secular and atheist bloggers and freethinkers in Bangladesh]] has been especially severe since 2013, and the IHEU has campaigned persistently in response&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/?s=bangladesh|title=IHEU {{!}} Search Results: bangladesh|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and highlighted the murders at the UN Human Rights Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/at-human-rights-council-iheu-raises-plight-of-bangladeshi-atheist-bloggers/|title=IHEU {{!}} At Human Rights Council, IHEU raises plight of Bangladeshi Atheist bloggers|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IHEU responded in 2013 to the murder of blogger and activist [[Ahmed Rajib Haider]] and the machete attack on his friend [[Asif Mohiuddin]], and highlighted the subsequent arrest and imprisonment of Mohiuddin and others for "hurting religious sentiments".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/arrests-atheist-bloggers-shows-bangladesh-authorities-are-walking-trap-set-fundamentalists/|title=IHEU {{!}} Arrests of "atheist bloggers" shows Bangladesh authorities are "walking into a trap set by fundamentalists"|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/prominent-atheist-blogger-remains-danger-pending-blasphemy-trial-bangladesh/|title=IHEU {{!}} Prominent atheist blogger remains in danger pending blasphemy trial in Bangladesh|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/call-action-defend-bloggers-bangladesh/|title=IHEU {{!}} Call to action: Defend the bloggers of Bangladesh|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When author and prominent leader of the Bengali freethought movement [[Avijit Roy]] was murdered, 26 February 2015, the IHEU revealed that he had been advising them on the situation in Bangladesh; the IHEU's Director of Communications commented, "This loss is keenly felt by freethinkers and humanists in South Asia and around the world. He was a colleague in humanism and a friend to all who respect human rights, freedom, and the light of reason."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/humanists-appalled-at-the-murder-of-secular-activist-and-writer-avijit-roy/|title=IHEU {{!}} Humanists appalled at the murder of secular activist and writer Avijit Roy|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the murder of [[Washiqur Rahman Babu]] (or Oyasiqur Rhaman), 30 March 2015, the IHEU republished some of his final writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/no-i-will-not-write-about-war-crimes-islamic-extremism-the-country-or-politics-anymore/|title=IHEU {{!}} "No, I will not write about war crimes, Islamic extremism, the country or politics anymore"|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the murder of [[Ananta Bijoy Das]], 12 May 2016, the IHEU leaked parts of the letter Bijoy Das had recently received from [[Sweden]] rejecting his visa application, despite his having being invited to the country by Swedish [[PEN International|PEN]]. The IHEU highlighted "the failures of the Bangladeshi authorities to bring to justice the individuals and to break the networks behind this string of targeted killings", and also criticised Sweden's rejection of his visa application, commenting, "We call on all countries to recognise the legitimacy and sometimes the urgency and moral necessity of asylum claims made by humanists, atheists and secularists who are being persecuted for daring to express those views."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/third-atheist-writer-hacked-to-death-in-bangladesh-this-year/|title=IHEU {{!}} Third atheist writer hacked to death in Bangladesh this year|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the murder of [[Niladri Chattopadhyay Niloy]] (or Niloy Chatterjee, also known by his pen name Niloy Neel), 7 August 2015, the IHEU again attacked the government and authorities, saying, "Apparent failure to pursue the most obvious lines of inquiry even when initial arrests are made, and [[media manipulation]] resulting in conflicting stories, further makes reportage difficult and police operations opaque."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/niloy-neel-fourth-atheist-activist-murdered-in-a-year-in-bangladesh/|title=IHEU {{!}} Niloy Neel – Fourth atheist activist murdered in a year in Bangladesh|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A coordinated attack against two separate publishing houses in [[Dhaka]], 31 October 2016, killed the publisher [[Faisal Arefin Dipon]] and seriously injured the publisher [[Ahmedur Rashid Chowdhury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/coordinated-machete-attack-on-publishers-of-secular-authors-in-bangladesh/|title=IHEU {{!}} Coordinated machete attack on publishers of secular authors in Bangladesh|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IHEU later published an interview with Chowdhury about the attack and his escape to [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/tutul-the-survivor-an-interview-with-the-target-of-a-bangladesh-machete-attack/|title=IHEU {{!}} Tutul: the Survivor – An interview with the target of a Bangladesh machete attack|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015 the IHEU coordinated a joint open letter in English and Bangla by a coalition of "Bloggers, free speech campaigners, humanist associations, religious and ex-Muslim groups"&lt;ref name="iheu.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/huge-alliance-protests-government-response-to-bangladesh-blogger-murders/|title=IHEU {{!}} Huge alliance protests government response to Bangladesh blogger murders|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2015/08/19/global-free-speech-campaigners-protest-against-blogger-killings-in-bangladesh|title=Global free speech campaigners protest against blogger killings in Bangladesh|newspaper=bdnews24.com|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; calling on the president and prime minister of Bangladesh to "ensure the safety and security of those individuals whose lives are threatened by Islamist extremists... instruct the police to find the killers, not to harass or blame the victims... disassociate yourself publicly from those who call for death penalties against non-religious Bangladeshis..." and repeal the laws under which secular bloggers faced arrest and imprisonment.&lt;ref name="iheu.org"/&gt;

Following the murder of a student and secular activist [[Nazimuddin Samad]], 6 April 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/atheist-student-nazimuddin-samad-killed-in-bangladesh/|title=IHEU {{!}} Atheist student Nazimuddin Samad killed in Bangladesh|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then the murder of university lecturer Professor [[Murder of A. F. M. Rezaul Karim Siddique|Rezaul Karim Siddique]], 23 April 2016, the IHEU's president Andrew Copson said "Unless the government [of Bangladesh] immediately begins to defend the right to speak and write freely, without adding the unprincipled and anti-secular qualifications that it keeps applying to freedom of expression, then very soon the only voices that will be heard will be those of murderous extremists."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/academic-hacked-to-death-in-bangladesh/|title=IHEU {{!}} Academic hacked to death in Bangladesh|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IHEU, along with the IHEU Member Organisation the [[Humanistisch Verbond|Dutch Humanist Association]], and [[Hague Peace Projects]], organised a "solidarity book fair" in The Hague, 26 February 2016, to coincide with the annual [[Ekushey Book Fair]] in Dhaka.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/europe-stands-with-bangladeshi-atheists-at-solidarity-book-fair-in-the-hague/|title=IHEU {{!}} Europe stands with Bangladeshi atheists at Solidarity Book Fair in The Hague|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The range of targets for these attacks began to broaden in the later part of 2015 and throughout 2016 to more often include minority religious individuals and foreigners, culminating in the [[July 2016 Dhaka attack]] in [[Gulshan Thana]].

==== End Blasphemy Laws campaign ====
In January 2015, in part as a response to the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting]], the IHEU alongside other transnational secular groups the [[European Humanist Federation]] and [[Atheist Alliance International]] and a two-hundred strong organisational coalition, founded the End Blasphemy Laws Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/religion-and-beliefs/end-blasphemy-laws-campaign-launched-by-international-coalition-1.2085483|title=End Blasphemy Laws campaign launched by international coalition|newspaper=The Irish Times|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/end-blasphemy-laws-a-new-campaign/|title=IHEU {{!}} End Blasphemy Laws – a new campaign|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; End Blasphemy Laws is "campaigning to repeal "blasphemy" and related laws worldwide."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://end-blasphemy-laws.org/about/|title=About {{!}} End Blasphemy Laws|website=end-blasphemy-laws.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other campaigns ====
The "First World Conference on Untouchability" was organised by the IHEU in [[London]], June 2009.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/global-initiative-against-untouchability-launched-london/|title=IHEU {{!}} Global initiative against untouchability launched in London|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anticipating the event, the [[BBC News]] quoted then-Executive Director of the IHEU [[Babu Gogineni]] as saying that legal reforms alone would not end caste discrimination: "There are Dalit politicians in India, but nothing has changed. The answer is to educate Dalits and empower them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8089287.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} UK {{!}} Is caste prejudice still an issue?|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was preceded by questions in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/parliamentary-questions-precede-first-world-conference-untouchability-london-june-9-10/|title=IHEU {{!}} Parliamentary questions precede first World Conference on Untouchability in London, June 9 &amp; 10|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and guests included [[Meghnad Desai, Baron Desai|Lord Desai]] and [[Baron Avebury|Lord Avebury]] from the UK [[House of Lords]]; [[Binod Pahadi]], Member of the [[Legislature Parliament of Nepal|Constituent Assembly, Nepal]]; and Tina Ramirez, US Congressional Fellow on International Religious Freedom.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The Second World Conference on Untouchability was held in [[Kathmandu]], in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/iheu-supports-second-world-conference-on-untouchability/|title=IHEU {{!}} IHEU supports Second World Conference on Untouchability|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the IHEU criticised the US-based [[Appeal of Conscience Foundation]] for awarding their "World Statesman Award" to then-president of [[Indonesia]] [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]]; IHEU argued that the award "is a slap in the face to prisoners of conscience across the world. While [[Alexander Aan]] suffers in an Indonesian jail for posting his beliefs to Facebook, his jailer will be honored in New York as a champion of freedom of belief."

In 2014 the IHEU as part of a "coalition of secular groups" led a campaign around the hashtag "#TwitterTheocracy" to protest the social media website [[Twitter]]'s implementation of tools blocking "blasphemous" tweets in [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iheu.org/twittertheocracy-campaign-after-social-network-blocks-blasphemy-in-pakistan/|title=IHEU {{!}} #TwitterTheocracy campaign after social network blocks "blasphemy" in Pakistan|website=iheu.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.techdigest.tv/2014/06/twitter_censors_1.html|title=Twitter censorship targeted with hashtag activism - Tech Digest|date=2014-06-10|newspaper=Tech Digest|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Society of Caricature Artists''' (previously known as the '''National Caricaturist Network''') is an international non-profit trade association founded in 1989. Its purpose is to promote the art of [[caricature]], educate the public and the media about the art of caricature and to provide its members with helpful information about caricature as an art form as well as a profession.  The ISCA  currently {{when|date=June 2018}} has close to 500 members from around the world. Members receive the quarterly magazine, Exaggerated Features, which has articles about caricaturing, featured artists tips and stories as well as other useful information about caricature illustration. The ISCA annual convention is held each year in a different location. The conventions features a guest speaker, lectures, seminars, competitions, awards and the camaraderie of your peers in the art of caricature drawing.

The quarterly newsletter, Exaggerated Features, is sent to the members and an annual convention is held for socialization as well as education and competition.

==History==
The NCN was formed by Wallace "Buddy" Rose. Buddy created a forum for caricaturists by providing a quarterly newsletter and annual convention. The original goal was to create an organization that would seek out charitable and mutual benefits for united artists. It operated briefly as a booking agency until filing its application in compliance with article 5154a making it a trade union in 1994. In 1995 the new constitution was ratified in San Antonio, TX, the NCN was granted non-profit status, and the first election was held. In 2005, the NCN was changed into a non-profit, unincorporated association.

The association boasts some of the most recognizable names in the industry as members and friends of the NCN. [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]], [[Sergio Aragones]], [[Mort Drucker]] and [[Tom Richmond (illustrator)]] of Mad Magazine, [[Jan Op De Beeck]], Maria Bolton, Sam Norkin, Rudy Cristiano, Bruce Blitz, C.F. Payne, Pancho Willmarth, Mike Peters, Steve Silver and [[Sebastian Krüger]] have all been keynote speakers and members. Many NCN members are accomplished as artists not only in caricaturing, but in other artistic fields as well.

The NCN officially changed its name to the International Society of Caricature Artists in 2009 to better reflect its international growth and presence. As of 2010 it has over 600 members worldwide. In recent years the International Society of Caricature Artists annual convention has featured guests of honor such as Sam Viviano, Dan Adel, Tom Richmond, Hermann Mejia, Mark Fredrickson and Bill Plympton. In 2011, ISCA will celebrate its 20th anniversary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9157">'''''King Rother''''' or '''''König Rother''''' {{IPA-de|ˈkøːnɪk ˈʁoːtɐ|}} is the earliest ''[[Spielmannsdichtung]]'' known to historians.&lt;ref name ="columbia1"&gt;''The Columbia Encyclopedia'': "könˈĭk rōtˈər, earliest heroic minstrel epic from the precourtly period of Middle High German literature."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="cambridge1"&gt;Luscombe, p. 682 ''The earliest, and one of the most successful, is König Rother...''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Famous First Facts International Edition (2000), {{ISBN|0-8242-0958-3}}, item 3442 ''The first minstrel tale known to historians was '''King Rother''', a medieval German romance dating from circa 1160 that was popular among wandering minstrels of central Europe.''&lt;/ref&gt; It has many of the qualities of a [[fairy tale]]. Only one complete manuscript exists from the twelfth century (Heidelberg Cpg 390). The tale was popular into the fourteenth century.&lt;ref name = "gibbs1"&gt;Gibbs, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Rother'' may have a connection to a king of the Lombards, [[Rothari]].&lt;ref name ="Britannica1910"&gt;The Encyclopædia Britannica 1910, p. 376&lt;/ref&gt; There is a possibility, however, the name Rother may have come from the Norman king, [[Roger II of Sicily]].&lt;ref name = "gibbs2"/&gt;  

The epic story is notable for its combination of Byzantine and Germanic story elements. The poem has between 5200 and 5300 lines of verse and is from the period of [[Middle High German]] literature of adventure novels. The epic tale is written in a mixture of [[Low German|Low]] and [[High German]]. It seems to be for a Bavarian audience and was perhaps written by a Bavarian priest. The reason for this is because the writer mentions two noble Bavarian families, the Tengelingen and the Diessen.&lt;ref name = "gibbs2"&gt;Gibbs, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

The medieval German romance tale was popular among wandering minstrels of central Europe and was written in popular verse style. Some historians believe ''King Rother'' was written by an unknown educated cleric [[Rhineland|Rhenish]] poet probably between 1140 and 1170.&lt;ref name ="Britannica1910"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "gibbs2"/&gt; Others suggest it was a [[Bavaria]]n priest (c.1150); few believe any longer that it was a minstrel.&lt;ref name ="cambridge1"/&gt; The author refers to "books" as his source indicating there was a written source already, however he could have just used this to authenticate his writings.&lt;ref name = "gibbs1"/&gt;

==The epic==

The epic recounts King Rother's adventurous quest to the Middle East for a bride. The King on the advice of his nobles is concerned about the royal succession. He acts on their advice to seek the hand of the beautiful daughter of King Constantine of [[Constantinople]]. The problem with this however, is that all previous suitors lost their lives in the process.&lt;ref name = "gibbs2"/&gt; 

King Rother plays it safe and sends twelve envoys to King Constantine for his daughter's hand in marriage. He sent twelve counts escorted by twelve knights in shiny armor with much treasure. They made an excellent impression, especially on the Queen. However, when King Rother's trusted count announces their purpose King Constantine refuses the hand of the royal princess. Not only that, he captures all of King Rother's men and throws them in jail. He also takes all the treasure.&lt;ref name ="Britannica1910"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "gibbs2"/&gt; 

A year passes and King Rother is concerned about his men and treasure. He doesn't dare approach King Constantine with an army because surely he would then kill his men. Instead he comes up with a ruse and disguises himself as "Dietrich", a refugee who claims that he has been forced out of King Rother's land. Dietrich (King Rother) is generous with gifts and eventually obtains an army of five thousand men. The Queen of Constantinople is especially impressed with Dietrich. She gives her opinion to her husband King Constantine that King Rother must be a powerful king if he threw out a man of such qualities off his land. She felt that the royal princess should have been given to Rother.&lt;ref name ="Britannica1910"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "gibbs2"/&gt;  

The princess's curiosity got the best of her and she arranged a secret rendezdous with Dietrich. Dietrich then reveals to her he is really King Rother and desires her hand in marriage. They then planned secretly among themselves to get Rother's messengers released from jail. Dietrich promises on his life to King Constantine that the men will not leave the city. After the men are released Dietrich reveals to everyone that he is really King Rother by playing a certain melody on his harp.&lt;ref name ="Britannica1910"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "gibbs2"/&gt; 

Then news comes that the evil King Ymelot is coming to attack King Constantine. Dietrich offers to help the king and the two armies camp on the outskirts of the city. At night Dietrich sneaks into the camp of the enemy and captures King Ymelot. He is turned over to King Constantine as a prisoner at his camp. There is much rejoicing of the defeat of the enemy. In the turmoil and excitement King Rother quickly returns to Constantinople and announces that King Constantine has been killed.&lt;ref name ="Britannica1910"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "gibbs2"/&gt;

The ladies of Constantinople asks King Rother for help. He has them brought to his ship. In the process of embarking however, he only actually takes the royal princess on board. He leaves a message to the Queen his true identity and that the story of King Constantine's demise was only a ruse to get the princess. King Rother sails off with the princess. The Queen is quite happy at the outcome, however her husband King Constantine is furious. To make matters worse for King Constantine it turns out King Ymelot escapes from the prison.&lt;ref name = "gibbs3"&gt;Gibbs, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

King Rother returns to his country of Bari and finds the need to take inventory of his lands. He travels to the north part of his country to start the inventory. While he is gone an unscrupulous minstrel sent by King 
Constantine arrives in Bari. He uses a ploy and tricks the royal princess onto his ship and takes her back to Constantinople. When King Rother returns from his inventory he is enraged. He gathers together 30,000 men and sails off to Constantinople.&lt;ref name = "gibbs3"/&gt; 

Once King Rother arrives near the city he hides in the woods with his men. The king and a few of his men secretly enter the city disguised as pilgrims. There they learn that the evil King Ymelot has not only captured King Constantine, but his daughter as well. The princess is to be married off to King Ymelot's son that evening. King Rother and his "pilgrim" men sneak into the banquet hall and hide under the table where the princess is. King Rother secretly slips her a silver ring. She is so excited about this that she gives it away to everyone that King Rother must be nearby. Since the jig was up, King Rother reveals himself at the mercy of God. King Rother is given a choice of how he would like to be executed. He persuades King Ymelot that he wishes to die in the woods (where his army is hidden out!).&lt;ref name = "gibbs3"/&gt; 

King Rother insists that all 30 of the evil kings be present at his execution. They agree to this great opportunity to see him murdered. Meanwhile, back at the city the five thousand men that Dietrich ("King Rother") helped previously armed themselves to free him. While the hanging gallows were being constructed these men attacked and freed King Rother and his two companions. The companions were two giants, Asprian and Witold, that King Rother brought with him. King Rother then blew his horn which was a signal. Then all his army hidden in the woods came out and they, along with King Rother's special giants, slaughtered the evil kings.&lt;ref name = "gibbs3"/&gt;

The city of Constantinople and King Constantine are spared the onslaught. King Constantine brings out his princess and the other ladies of the city to meet King Rother. The Queen accused her husband of arrogance and gives the princess back to King Rother. The king then returns with his new bride to Bari, where she gives birth to a son, [[Pepin the Short|Pipin]]. Pipin later becomes the father to [[Charlemagne]].&lt;ref name = "gibbs3"/&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=April 2008}}

The '''letter of the law''' versus the '''spirit of the law''' is an [[idiomatic]] [[antithesis]]. When one obeys the letter of the law but not the spirit, one is obeying the literal interpretation of the words (the "letter") of the [[law]], but not necessarily the ''intent'' of those who wrote the law.  Conversely, when one obeys the spirit of the law but not the letter, one is doing what the authors of the law intended, though not necessarily adhering to the literal wording.

"Law" originally referred to [[Statutory law|legislative statute]], but in the idiom may refer to any kind of rule. Intentionally following the letter of the law but not the spirit may be accomplished through exploiting [[Technicality|technicalities]], [[loopholes]], and ambiguous language.

== Shakespeare ==
[[Image:Portia and Shylock.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Shylock]] and [[Portia (Merchant of Venice)|Portia]]'' (1835) by [[Thomas Sully]]]]
[[William Shakespeare]] wrote numerous plays dealing with the letter versus spirit antithesis, almost always coming down on the side of "spirit", often forcing villains (who  always sided with the letter) to make concessions and remedy.
In one of the best known examples, ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', he introduces the [[Quibble (plot device)|quibble as a plot device]] to save both the spirit and the letter of the law. The moneylender [[Shylock]] has made an agreement with [[Antonio (Merchant of Venice)|Antonio]] that if he cannot repay a loan, he will have a pound of flesh from him. When the debt is not repaid in time [[Portia (Merchant of Venice)|Portia]]  at first pleads for mercy in [[The Quality of Mercy (Shakespeare quote)|a famous speech]]: ''"The quality of mercy is not strain'd, It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest: It blesseth him that gives and him that takes."'' (IV,i,185). When Shylock refuses, she finally saves Antonio by pointing out that Shylock's agreement with him mentioned no blood, and therefore Shylock can have his pound of flesh only if he sheds no blood.

== U.S. Constitutional law ==

Interpretations of the U.S. Constitution have historically divided on the "Letter versus Spirit" debate. For example, at the founding, the [[Federalist Party]] argued for a looser interpretation of the Constitution, granting Congress broad powers in keeping with the spirit of the broader purpose of some founders (notably including the Federalist founders' purposes). The Federalists would have represented the "spirit" aspect. In contrast, the [[Democratic-Republicans]], who favored a limited federal government, argued for the strict interpretation of the Constitution, arguing that the federal government was granted only those powers enumerated in the Constitution, and nothing not explicitly stated; they represented the "letter" interpretation.

Modern Constitutional interpretation also divides on these lines. Currently, [[Living Constitution]] scholars advocate a "spirit"-esque interpretative strategy, although one grounded in a spirit that reflects broad powers. [[Originalist]] or [[Textualist]] scholars advocate a more "letter"-based approach, arguing that the Amendment process of the Constitution necessarily forecloses broader interpretations that can be accomplished by passing an amendment.

== The Bible ==
{{See also|Law and Gospel}}

The [[Christian Bible]] references the letter and the spirit of the law in  2 Cor 3:6  NASB.  Though it is not quoted directly, the principle is applied using the words "spirit" and "letter" in context with the legalistic view of the [[Hebrew Bible]].  This is the first recorded use of the phrase.

In the [[New Testament]], [[Pharisees]] are seen as people who place the letter of the law above the spirit ([[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 2:3–28, 3:1–6).  Thus, "Pharisee" has entered the language as a pejorative for one who does so; the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] defines ''Pharisee'' with one of the meanings as ''A person of the spirit or character commonly attributed to the Pharisees in the New Testament; a legalist or formalist''.  Pharisees are also depicted as being lawless or corrupt ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 23:38); the Greek word used in the verse means [[Antinomianism|lawlessness]], and the corresponding Hebrew word means fraud or injustice. However, the Hebrew word "Perushim" from which "Pharisee" is derived, actually means "separatists", referencing their focus on spiritual needs versus worldly pleasures.

In the Gospels, Jesus is often shown as being critical of Pharisees. He is more like the [[Essenes]] than the other Jewish groups of the time ([[Sadducees]], Pharisees, [[Zealots]]){{citation needed|date=October 2013}}; however, the Pharisees, like Jesus, believed in the resurrection of the dead, and in divine judgment. They advocated prayer, almsgiving and fasting as spiritual practices. The Pharisees were those who were trying to be faithful to the law given to them by God. Not all Pharisees, nor all Jews of that time, were legalistic. Though modern language has used the word Pharisee in the pejorative to describe someone who is legalistic and rigid, it is not an accurate description of all Pharisees. The argument over the "Spirit of the Law" vs. the "Letter of the Law" was part of early Jewish dialogue as well
.&lt;ref&gt;Babalonian Talmud Tractate Baba Metzia 115a, Sanhedrin 21a.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]] (Luke 10:25-37) is one of the New Testament texts to address this theme. The passage concerns a dialogue between Jesus and an "expert in the law" or "lawyer". As described in verse 25 ("a certain lawyer stood up and tested Him saying, Teacher what must I do to inherit eternal life?," NKJV), the intent of the dialogue was to trap Jesus into making statements contrary to the law. Jesus responds by posing the question back to the lawyer, as already having knowledge of the law, ("What is written in the law?" verse 26) The lawyer quotes Deuteronomy 6:5 "You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind and your neighbor as yourself.", NKJV) and Leviticus 19:18. The question "Who is my neighbor?", that follows in verse 29, is described as being asked with the goal of self-justification.

It is then that Jesus responds with the story of a man beaten by robbers who is ignored by a Priest and a Levite, but then rescued and compassionately cared for by a Samaritan. Priests and Levites were Israelites whose qualifications and duties were very meticulously set forth in Mosaic law, (Leviticus 10, and Numbers 5-8)  while Samaritans were descended from Israelites who had intermarried with their Babylonian captives and had been forced to establish a sect with an alternative interpretation of the Law. In the story, both the Priest and Levite follow their prescribed regulations dutifully, yet do not help the injured traveler, even crossing to the other side of the road to avoid possible rule violations. The Samaritan, whose very existence is based on a refutation of Jewish law, (specifically those post-Pentateuchal biblical books that identify Mount Moriah as the proper place of worship specified in Deuteronomy 12; the Samaritans considered only the Pentateuch cannon, and worshipped Yahweh in their temple on Mount Gerizim) goes above and beyond simply tending to the injured man. He takes him to an inn and gives money for the man's care, promises and then actually does return to inquire about the man, and pay any overage incurred. Jesus concludes by asking the lawyer which of the men was a "neighbor" to the beaten traveller, to which the reply was "the one who showed compassion".&lt;ref&gt;The Holy Bible, New King James Version, 1982 by Thomas Nelson, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Then Jesus says to him "go and do likewise".

According to Jeremiah, "the qualities of the [[new covenant]] expounded upon  the old are : a) It will not be broken; b) Its law will be written in the heart, not merely on tablets of stone; c) The knowledge of God will deem it no longer necessary to put it into written words of instruction."&lt;ref name="NAB"&gt;"The New American Bible" Confraternity of Christian Doctrine, Nashville, Tennessee, 37202, 1976 (1970) p.949 (Jeremiah 31: 31-34). '''Note''': This bible has interpretations and references as footnotes.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Luke (Lk 22, 20), and Paul, in the first epistle to the Corinthians (1 Cor 11, 25), this prophecy was fulfilled only through the work of [[Jesus Christ]],&lt;ref name="NAB"/&gt; who said "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which will be shed for you." Christ did not come to abolish the law but to fulfill it. His purpose was to encourage people to look beyond the "letter of the law" to the "spirit of the law"...the principles behind the commandments and the law's intention. Jesus quotes the book of Deuteronomy and Leviticus: "All the Law can be summed up in this: to love God with all your heart, all your mind and all your soul, and to love your neighbor as yourself" (paraphrased).

== Gaming the system ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
{{see also|Legal loophole}}
[[Gaming the system]], also called "[[rules lawyer]]ing", is a pejorative phrase applied to someone who follows the letter of the law to obtain an outcome the speaker finds immoral or contrary to the spirit of the law.  There are two reasons why this can be possible.  A body of law may have been formulated in a way that permits ambiguity, or else there may be limitations in the law's scope or jurisdiction. For example, an offshore bank account can be used to reduce domestic tax obligations in some countries.

This is a '''list of monoliths''' organized according to the size of the largest block of stone on the site. A [[monolith]] is a large stone which has been used to build a structure or monument, either alone or together with other stones. In this list at least one colossal stone over ten tons has been moved to create the structure or monument.

In most cases the ancient civilizations had little, if any, advanced technology that would help the moving of these monoliths. The most notable exception is that of the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] who had [[Roman crane|cranes]] and [[Treadwheel crane|treadwheel]]s to help lift colossal stones (see [[List of ancient monoliths]]).

Documented in recent times, there is a list of efforts to move colossal stones that used technology that wasn't more advanced than the technology the ancient civilizations used.

Most of these weights are based on estimates by published scholars; however, there have been numerous false estimates of many of these stones presented as facts. To help recognize exaggerations, an introductory description shows how to calculate the weight of colossal stones by calculating [[volume]] and [[density]].

== Calculating the weight of monoliths ==
In the cases of the smaller monoliths it may be possible to weigh them. However, in most cases the monoliths were too large or they may have been part of an ancient structure so this method could not be used. The [[weight]] of a stone can be calculated by multiplying its [[volume]] and [[density]]. The density of most stones is between two and three tons per cubic meter. [[Basalt]] weighs about 2.8 to 3.0 tons per cubic meter;  [[granite]] averages about 2.75 metric tons per cubic meter; [[limestone]], 2.7 metric tons per cubic meter; [[sandstone]] or [[marble]], 2.5 tons per cubic meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

=== Rock density ===
[[File:Gobekli Tepe 2.jpg|thumb|120px|[[Monolith]] with [[bull]], [[fox]], and [[crane (bird)|crane]] in [[low relief]] at [[Gobekli Tepe]] ]]

The discussion above is accurate as far as it goes, which is only to the first significant figure. To go any further one needs to be relatively sophisticated about surveying the monolith (including realistic and explicit assessment of the shapes of inaccessible portions of the monolith), then about calculating the volume (and volumetric errors, which vary crudely as the cube of linear uncertainties). Finally and crucially the rock density needs to be measured with appropriate precision. Identifying the rock type is not going to be sufficient as this table (from&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthsci.unimelb.edu.au/ES304/MODULES/GRAV/NOTES/densities.html |title=Density Variations of Earth Materials |publisher=Earthsci.unimelb.edu.au |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;) illustrates:

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Densities of common rocks&lt;br&gt;in g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; / tonne/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
! Material !! Density
|- 
| [[Sediments]] || 1.7–2.3
|- 
| [[Sandstone]] || 2.0–2.6 
|- 
| [[Shale]] || 2.0–2.7 
|- 
| [[Limestone]] || 2.5–2.8 
|- 
| [[Granite]] || 2.5–2.8 
|- 
| [[Metamorphic Rock]] || 2.6–3.0 
|- 
| [[Basalts]] || 2.7–3.1 
|}

Simply identifying the monolith as being "sandstone" would allow a reasonable ± 15% uncertainty in the weight estimate.
In practice, one would measure the density of the monolith itself, and preferably document any variation in density within the monolith as they are made of natural materials, which have not been engineered for homogeneous parameters. Non-destructive methods of density measurements are available (e.g. electron back-scatter); alternatively the site may contain already-separated fragments of the monolith which can be used for laboratory measurements or on-site techniques. At the crudest, a weighing device and a bucket can obtain two significant figures for a density value.

== Quarried monoliths ==

== List of efforts to move and install stones ==

These are listed with the largest experiments first; for additional details of most experiments see related pages.

*Marinos Carburis, Greek lieutenant-colonel in the Russian Army, organized the move of an enormous boulder called the Thunder Stone (Russian, Камень-Гром) from the Gulf of Finland in 1768 to [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]] for the purpose of using it as a pedestal for the [[Bronze Horseman#Moving the Thunder Stone|Bronze Horseman]] statue. Based on the density of granite, the mass of the Thunder Stone has been estimated to be around 1500 tonnes. This was done by rolling it on bronze ball bearings on a track. It took an estimated 400 men nine months to move it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cnum.cnam.fr/CGI/fpage.cgi?4KY28.19/351/100/432/0/0 "(French) Transport du piédestal de la statue de Pierre le Grand] ''La Nature'' magazine, second semester 1882. http://cnum.cnam.fr/CGI/fpage.cgi?4KY28.19/351/100/432/0/0.

*In 1997, Julian Richards teamed up with Mark Witby and Roger Hopkins to conduct several experiments to replicate the construction at [[Theories about Stonehenge#Construction techniques and design|Stonehenge]] for NOVA's ''Secrets of Lost Empires'' mini-series. They initially failed to tow a 40-ton monolith with 130 men but after adding additional men towing as well as some men using levers to prod the megalith forward, they succeeded in inching it forward a small distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2403stone.html |title=NOVA &amp;#124; Transcripts &amp;#124; Secrets of Lost Empires &amp;#124; Stonehenge |publisher=PBS |date=1997-02-11 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Roger Hopkins and Mark Lehner teamed up with a NOVA crew to conduct an [[Obelisk#Obelisk-erecting experiments|obelisk erecting experiment]]; they successfully erected a 25-ton obelisk in 1999. They also managed to tow it a short distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/dispatches/990827.html |title=NOVA Online &amp;#124; Mysteries of the Nile &amp;#124; August 27, 1999: The Third Attempt |publisher=Pbs.org |date=1999-08-27 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/dispatches/990314.html |title=NOVA Online &amp;#124; Mysteries of the Nile &amp;#124; March 14, 1999: Pulling Together |publisher=Pbs.org |date=1999-03-14 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Time Life Lost Civilizations series: Ramses II: Magnificence on the Nile (1993) pp. 56–57&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Thor Heyerdahl]] organized an effort to pull a 10-ton [[Moai]] on a sledge with a group of 180 men. Approximately 18 men pulled each ton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/easter/move/past.html |title=NOVA Online &amp;#124; Secrets of Easter Island &amp;#124; Past Attempts |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heyerdahl, Thor ''Aku-Aku; The 1958 Expedition to Easter Island''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heyerdahl, Thor. ''Easter Island – A Mystery Solved''. 1988. {{ISBN|951-30-8952-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Charles Love experimented with a 10-ton replica of a Moai on [[Easter Island]]. His first experiment found rocking the statue to walk it was too unstable over more than a few hundred yards. He then found that by placing the statue upright on two sled runners atop log rollers, 25 men were able to move the statue {{convert|150|ft|m}} in two minutes. Approximately 2.5 men pulled each ton.&lt;ref&gt;John Flenley and Paul G. Bahn (2003). ''The Enigmas of Easter Island: Island on the Edge'', p 150. {{ISBN|0-19-280340-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Austen Henry Layard]] organized an effort to transport two 10-ton colossal statues of a winged lion and a winged bull with a group of 300 men in 1847. He loaded them on a wheeled cart and towed them from [[Nimrud]] to the river and loaded on a barge, where it was sent to London. Approximately 30 men pulled each ton.&lt;ref name="Mesopotamia 1995 pp. 112–121"&gt;Time Life Lost Civilizations series: Time Life Lost Civilizations series: Mesopotamia: The Mighty Kings.(1995) pp. 112–121&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Paul Emile Botta]] and Victor Place attempted to move two additional 30-ton colossi to Paris from [[Khorsabad]] in 1853. In order to facilitate their shipment to Paris, they were sawed in pieces and they still ran into problems. One of them fell into the [[Tigris]] river, never to be retrieved. The other made it to Paris.&lt;ref name="Mesopotamia 1995 pp. 112–121"/&gt;
*[[Giovanni Battista Belzoni]] organized an effort to pull a 7.5-ton fragment of a statue of Ramses on rollers with a group of 130 men in 1815. This statue was towed to the river and loaded on a barge, where it was sent to London. Progress increased with practice as they went along. Approximately 17 or 18 men pulled each ton.&lt;ref&gt;Time Life Lost Civilizations series: Ramses II: Magnificence on the Nile (1993) pp. 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;
*Henri Chevrier organized an effort to pull a 6-ton block on a sledge with a group of six men. Approximately one man pulled each ton.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Dr. I.E.S.: ''The Pyramids of Egypt 1986/1947'' pp. 273–74&lt;/ref&gt; Other reports claim that Chevier's experiment required three men to pull each ton.&lt;ref&gt;Lehner, Mark ''The Complete Pyramids'', London: Thames and Hudson (1997) p. 224 {{ISBN|0-500-05084-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Josh Bernstein]] and [[Julian Richards (archaeologist)|Julian Richards]] organized an effort to pull a 2-ton stone on wooden tracks with a group of about 16 men. Approximately 8 men pulled each ton.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Bernstein: Digging for the Truth pp. 133–35 book based on History Channel series&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mark Lehner]] and NOVA organized an experiment to tow stones and to build a pyramid 9 meters wide by 9 meters deep by 6 meters high. They were able to tow a 2-ton block on a sledge across wood tracks with 12 to 20 men. Approximately 6 to 10 men pulled each ton. The pyramid was 54 cubic meters total estimated weight 135 tons. It was built out of 186 stones. The average weight of each stone was almost {{convert|1500|lb|abbr=on}} (.75 tons). They found that four or five men could use levers to flip stones less than a ton and roll them to transport them. 44 men took 22 days to complete the pyramid, including the carving of the stones. They used iron to carve the stones that wasn't available to the ancient Egyptians. Egyptians had to use copper. They also used a modern front end loader to accelerate the work on the lower courses. They were unable to use the front end loader to install the capstone, since it was too high and had to use levers to raise it to {{convert|20|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;Lehner, Mark ''The Complete Pyramids'', London: Thames and Hudson (1997) pp. 202–225 {{ISBN|0-500-05084-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In a 2001 exercise in experimental archaeology, an attempt was made to transport a large stone along a land and sea route from Wales to [[Stonehenge]]. Volunteers pulled it for some miles (with great difficulty) on a wooden sledge over land, using modern roads and low-friction netting to assist sliding, but once transferred to a replica prehistoric boat, the stone sank in [[Milford Haven]], before it even reached the rough seas of the [[Bristol Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Theories about Stonehenge]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Roger Hopkins and Vince Lee both theorized about how the megalithic stones were moved at [[Baalbek#Theories about the Trilithon and other megaliths|Baalbek; these theories involved either towing them or flipping them.]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;History Channel "Mega Movers: Ancient Mystery Moves"&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''marathon''' is an event in which viewers or readers engage many hours-worth of [[Media (communication)|media]] (film, television, books, [[YouTube]] videos etc.) in a condensed time period. This phrase represents a two-fold shift from binge-watch in that it incorporates other media (not just television) and it reduces the negative connotations associated with bingeing. In the 2014 book ''Media Marathoning: Immersions in Morality,'' Lisa Perks describes media marathoning as a “comprehensive and complimentary phrase” that “connotes a conjoined triumph of commitment and stamina. This phrase also captures viewers’ or readers’ engrossment, effort, and sense of accomplishment surrounding their media interaction.” &lt;ref&gt;Perks, Lisa. (2014).

Lexington Books, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Netflix]] Executive Todd Yellin is quoted as saying "I don't like the term 'binge,' because it sounds almost pathological. 'Marathon' sounds more celebratory."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in John Jurgensen. (July 13, 2013). [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303740704577521300806686174 Binge Viewing: TV's Lost Weekends.] ''The Wall Street Journal.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Media marathons can be organized around particular series, particular artists (e.g., [[Akira Kurosawa|Kurosawa]] or [[Hitchcock]]), or genres (e.g., [[horror films]] or [[chick flicks]]). Marathons can be user-created: one person decides to undertake a marathon solo or to organize a group marathon. Marathons may also be producer-created. Producer-created marathons are usually orchestrated by movie theaters, fan sites, or by cable channels that show already-run seasons, and, more recently, with original first-run programming through streaming services (such as Netflix's ''House of Cards''). In television, a marathon is an extension of the concept of [[block programming]].

==Reasons==
The most common reasons for a network to run a marathon are:
# to celebrate the acquisition of a series,
# to lead into a highly anticipated episode of a series (such as a return from a hiatus or a series finale),
# likewise to allow viewers to catch up on a series before a season finale,
# when well known star of a show retires or dies (this is particularly popular on networks that specialize in [[rerun]]s),
# to celebrate (or to take advantage of additional viewers on) a [[holiday]],
# to [[burning off|burn off]] a contract for a television series that has proved unprofitable
# to [[stunting (broadcasting)|signal the end of a channel format and/or the start of a new one]], or 
# to inexpensively [[counterprogramming|counterprogram]] against more popular programs such as the [[Super Bowl]].&lt;ref name=usatoday-bowls2009&gt;{{cite news|title=Football not your thing?

# To celebrate the anniversary of a tv series.

Marathons are attractive to genre movie fans, or families that like watching their favourite movies/TV shows in blocks at a time.&lt;ref name="books.google.com.au"&gt;{{cite book|title=Planning Your Family Staycation: Fun Ideas for Your At-Home Summer Vacation|author=Witmer, D.D.|isbn=9781105601156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dJiiAwAAQBAJ|page=126|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On July 1st, 1985, the first TV marathons were broadcast on Nickelodeon's [[Nick at Nite]], presenting multiple episodes from ''Donna Reed'' and ''Route 66''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Slevinski|first1=Christy|title=CLASSIC MOVE: NICK AT NITE MARKS A DECADE|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/classic-move-nick-nite-marks-decade-article-1.682035|website=New York Daily News|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The idea by [[Alan Goodman]] and [[Fred Seibert]] was based on a similar concept that radio stations used, in which songs by one particular artist would be played for a prolonged period of time. While early marathons were rare and special, in modern time it is common for some networks to air a television series in three- to four-hour blocks, sometimes on a daily basis, mainly to appeal to and compete with subscription video on demand services (such as [[Hulu]] and [[Netflix]]) that have enabled voluntary "[[Binge-watching]]" of television series.

Almost all marathons primarily feature [[rerun]]s of episodes already previously broadcast, although one may be used to lead into the premiere of a new episode. On the other hand, [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] used a marathon for the series premiere of ''[[Angie Tribeca]]'', broadcasting its entire first season of 10 episodes in a 25-hour marathon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/tbs-wants-you-spend-25-hours-angie-tribeca-227988|title=TBS wants you to spend 25 hours with Angie Tribeca|last=McLevy|first=Alex|work=The A.V. Club|access-date=2018-05-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a few cases, especially with classic television, [[lost episode]]s, originally unseen [[television pilot]]s, and other programming that may not have been seen during the show's original run may be included.

Marathons have proven to be a viable way of rerunning reality television contests, which have otherwise been relatively difficult to rerun in traditional forms (e.g. daily "strip" syndication) because of the loss of the element of surprise. In December 2012, MTV announced that it would air a seven-day (168-hour) marathon of ''[[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]]'' before the series finale on December 20, 2012; this marked one of the longest marathons in television history.

It has been speculated in the early 2010s that marathon television viewing or [[binge watching]], usually done on-demand by ordering a whole season of episodes of a television series on a service such as [[Netflix]], is increasing in popularity. [[Infomercial]] blocks are generally not considered marathons beyond jocular mentions of such for networks such as [[CNBC]] which program heavy infomercial schedules on weekends or financially struggling stations which schedule them in high-profile time periods.

Perks attributes the contemporary marathoning trend to three factors: advances in content-delivery technologies, active audience behaviors, and increasing complexity of storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;Perks, Lisa (2014). ''[https://www.amazon.com/Media-Marathoning-Lisa-Glebatis-Perks/dp/073919674X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1421954322&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=media+marathoning Media Marathoning: Immersions in Morality].'' Lexington Books, pp. xv-xxxix.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 25, 2015, [[Comedy Central]] announced that it would stream a marathon online of every episode of ''[[The Daily Show]]'' hosted by [[Jon Stewart]], known as "Your Month of Zen", running between June 26 and August 6, 2015, in honor of his retirement.&lt;ref name=thewrap-jonvoyage&gt;{{cite web|title=Jon Stewart to Get Month-Long Send Off From Comedy Central|url=http://www.thewrap.com/jon-stewart-to-get-month-long-send-off-from-comedy-central/|website=TheWrap|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Length ==
Researchers have operationally defined media marathoning and binge-watching in different ways. Perks provides medium-specific definitions. Marathoners must have "viewed a television season in a week or less, watched three or more films from the same series in a week or less, or read three or more books from the same series in a month or less."&lt;ref&gt;Perks, 2014, xii.&lt;/ref&gt; A Netflix-commissioned study defined "binge-watching" as viewing 2-6 episodes of the same show in one sitting.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Stelter, “[http://money.cnn.com/2013/12/13/technology/netflix-binge/index.html Netflix Finds Plenty of Binge Watching, but Little Guilt],” CNN Money, December 13, 2013, accessed December 16, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 TiVo survey defined binge-watching as watching 3 or more episodes of the same show in one day.&lt;ref&gt;Dina Gachman, [https://www.forbes.com/sites/dinagachman/2014/06/25/breaking-bad-house-of-cards-most-binge-watched-shows/ “Breaking Bad, House of Cards Most Binge-Watched Shows,”] Forbes, June 25, 2014, accessed July 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
In extreme media marathons, such as the Simpsons Marathon (which lasted 86 hours and 37 minutes), the viewing time can last an exceptionally long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/television/Simpsons-Marathon-Winners-Tied-86-Hours-37-Minutes-39556.html|title=Simpsons Marathon Winners: Tied at 86 Hours, 37 Minutes|accessdate=2 January 2015|publisher=cinemablend.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the longest running marathons are the two ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]'' marathons that air on [[Syfy]] in the United States on [[New Years Day]] and [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]]; not counting early morning [[infomercials]], each run for roughly three days straight. Holidays are a common time for marathons; for instance, on [[Thanksgiving]] in 2010, over 40 cable networks aired marathons of various lengths.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

For a time, the longest continuous marathon in the history of television was a twelve-day marathon of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' that aired on [[FXX]], which aired non-stop from August 21, 2014 until September 2, 2014.&lt;ref name=EverySimpsonsEver&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bradley|first1=Bill|title='The Simpsons' Launches On FXX With Longest Continuous Marathon Ever|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/09/simpsons-launches-on-fxx-longest-marathon_n_5120709.html|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marathon featured the first 552 episodes of the series (every single episode that had already been released at the time) aired chronologically, including ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', which FX Networks had already owned the rights to air. The first day of the marathon was the highest rated broadcast day in the history of the network so far, the ratings more than tripled those of regular prime time programming for FXX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kissell|first1=Rick|title=‘The Simpsons’ Marathon More Than Triples Primetime Audience for FXX|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/the-simpsons-marathon-more-than-triples-primetime-audience-for-fxx-1201288542/|publisher=Variety|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ratings during the first six nights of the marathon grew night after night, with the network ranking within the top 5 networks in basic cable each night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kondolojy|first1=Amanda|title=FXX Paints Labor Day Weekend Yellow|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/08/28/fxx-paints-labor-day-weekend-yellow/297657/|publisher=[[TV By the Numbers]]|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The record was surpassed in 2015 by [[VH1 Classic]], which broadcast a fifteen-day marathon of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''-related programming from January 28 to February 15, in honour of the program's 40th season (with its end date coinciding with the [[Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special|40th anniversary special episode]] on NBC). The marathon primarily featured the series' most notable episodes in a reverse chronological order (beginning with [[Saturday Night Live (season 39)|season 39]] and concluding with its October 11, 1975 series premiere), along with blocks focusing on specific celebrities (such as [[Eddie Murphy]] and [[Justin Timberlake]]), a block of the program's retrospective episodes on February 15, as well as Saturday-night airings of films featuring alumni of the series (such as ''[[Black Sheep (1996 film)|Black Sheep]]'' and'' [[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/14/7546265/snl-marathon-vh1-classic|title=VH1 Classic will run the "longest-ever" TV marathon with 19 days of Saturday Night Live|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/vh1-classic-to-run-433-hour-saturday-night-live-marathon-1201404896/|title=VH1 Classic To Run 433-Hour ‘Saturday Night Live’ Marathon|last=Steinberg|first=Brian|date=2015-01-14|work=Variety|access-date=2018-05-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jumping beans 12.jpg|thumb|Jumping beans, each about 7 to 10 mm]]
[[File:Jumping beans 85.jpg|thumb|Jumping beans with trap door, the hole is about 8 mm deep. On one the door is separated. On the other the door is still on the bean. Both are about 10 mm. Also shown are the 2 jumping bean moths or ''Cydia deshaisiana'' as well as their pupal casings]]
'''Mexican jumping beans''' (also known as ''{{lang|es|frijoles saltarines}}'' in Spanish) are seed pods that have been inhabited by the [[larva]] of a small moth (''[[Cydia deshaisiana]]'') and are native to [[Mexico]]. The "bean" is usually tan to brown in color. It "jumps" when heated because the larva spasms in an attempt to roll the seed to a cooler environment to avoid dehydration and consequent death. They are from the [[shrub]] ''[[Sebastiania pavoniana]]'', often also referred to as "jumping bean". However, they are not related to actual [[bean]]s ([[legume]] plants), but rather to [[spurge]]s. The beans are considered non-toxic but are not generally eaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alibi.com/news/20614/The-King-and-Queen-of-Hopping-Seeds.html|title=The King and Queen of Hopping Seeds|author=Marisa Demarco|work=alibi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the moth-laid egg on the plant hatches, the larva eats away the inside of the bean (until it becomes hollow) and attaches itself to the inside of the bean with silk-like thread. The larva may live for months inside the bean with varying periods of dormancy. If the larva has adequate conditions of moisture and temperature, it will live long enough to go into a [[pupal]] stage. In the spring, the moth forces itself out of the bean through a round "trap door", leaving behind the pupal casing. After its [[metamorphosis]], the small, silver and gray-colored moth lives for no more than a few days.

==As a novelty==
[[File:Mexican Jumping Beans 1.ogv|thumb|left]]
When the bean is abruptly warmed (by being held in the palm of the hand, for example) the larva twitches and spasms, pulling on the threads and causing the characteristic hop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/botany/question265.htm|title = How do Mexican jumping beans work?|accessdate = 4 November 2013|website = HowStuffWorks|publisher = HowStuffWorks, Inc.|date = April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaving the beans in a heated environment (such as direct [[sunlight]]) for an extended period of hours can easily kill them.

The beans become energetic when one holds them in the hand (out of the box) for a few minutes. The beans should also appear to be a very slight shade of green on the side. If one shakes a bean near one's ear and hears a rattle inside, the larva has either died or entered the pupal stage where its hardened shell makes a softer rattle.

Jumping beans are still available for sale in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.jumpingbeansrus.com/shopping/shopdisplayproducts.asp?id=15&amp;id=15|title = We sell Jumping Beans, Mexican Jumping Beans, Brincadores|accessdate = 31 August 2018|website = JumpingBeansRUS.com|publisher = Oz's Enterprises}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the UK, they were a common novelty item in the 1950s.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

A plastic toy under this name is manufactured and sold in packages of around 5-10{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}. It resembles a medicine capsule and has a metal ball inside. When the surface on which the capsule was laid is tilted, the ball rolls to the other end and makes the capsule twitch. A group of several of these "beans" shaken gently will move around unpredictably.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

[[File:MexicanJumpingBeans.jpg|thumb|Mexican jumping beans]]

==Care and storage==
Beans should be stored in a cool, dry place.

Beans require periodic rehydration, mimicking the [[monsoon]] weather of their native Mexico. To rehydrate the beans, they need to be soaked, but not submerged, for about three hours in [[chlorine]]-free water once or twice a month.

==Sources==
The Mexican jumping bean comes from the mountains in the [[Political divisions of Mexico|states]] of [[Sonora]], [[Sinaloa]], and [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]]. [[Álamos, Sonora]], calls itself the "Jumping Bean Capital of the World". They can be found in an area approximately 30 by 100 miles where the ''Sebastiana pavoniana'' host tree grows. During the spring, moths emerge from last year's beans and deposit their eggs on the flower of the host tree.

'''Moshe Safdie''', [[Order of Canada|CC]], [[Fellow of the American Institute of Architects|FAIA]] (born  July 14, 1938) is an Israeli-Canadian architect, urban designer, educator, theorist, and author. He is most identified with [[Habitat 67]], which paved the way for his international career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/israeli-architecture-with-eastern-promise-1.410815|title=Israeli Architecture With Eastern Promise|last=Dvir|first=Noam|date=2012-02-03|newspaper=Haaretz|language=en|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Safdie was born in [[Haifa]], to a [[Syrian Jewish]] family. His family moved to Montreal, Canada, in 1954. In 1959, Safdie married Nina Nusynowicz. The couple had two children, a daughter and a son. His son [[Oren Safdie]] is a playwright who has written several plays about architecture including ''Private Jokes, Public Places''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703674704575234153619245116|title=Deconstructing Architecture|last=Kaufman|first=Joanne|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter Taal is an architect in San Diego, a partner of the firm [[Safdie Rabines Architects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.safdierabines.com|title=HOME|website=Safdie Rabines Architects|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, Safdie graduated from [[McGill University]] with a degree in architecture. In 1981, Safdie married Michal Ronnen, a photographer, with whom he has two daughters, Carmelle and Yasmin. Carmelle Safdie is an artist, and Yasmin Safdie is a social worker. Safdie is the uncle of [[Dov Charney]], founder and former CEO of [[American Apparel]].

==Architecture career ==
After apprenticing with [[Louis Kahn]] in Philadelphia, Safdie returned to Montreal to oversee the master plan for [[Expo 67]]. In 1964, he established his own firm to undertake [[Habitat 67]], an adaptation of his McGill thesis. Habitat 67, which pioneered the design and implementation of three-dimensional, prefabricated units for living, was a central feature of Expo 67 and an important development in architectural history. He was awarded the 1967 Construction Man of the Year Award from the Engineering News Record and the [[Governor General's Awards|Massey Medal for Architecture in Canada]] for Habitat 67.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Habitat 67 (8126687023).jpg|thumb|Habitat 67]]
In 1970, Safdie opened a branch office in [[Jerusalem]]. Among the projects he has designed in Jerusalem are [[Yad Vashem]] and the [[Mamilla|Alrov Mamilla Quarter]], which includes the [[Mamilla Mall]], David's Village luxury condominiums, and the 5-star Mamilla Hotel. In 1978, after teaching at McGill, [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev|Ben Gurion]], and [[Yale University|Yale]] universities, Safdie moved his main office to Boston and became director of the Urban Design Program at [[Harvard Graduate School of Design|Harvard University's Graduate School of Design]], until 1984. From 1984 to 1989, he was the Ian Woodner Professor of Architecture and Urban Design at Harvard. Since the early 1990s, Safdie, a citizen of Canada, Israel, and the United States, has focused on his architectural practice, Safdie Architects, which is based in [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville, MA]], and has branches in Toronto, Jerusalem, and Singapore.

Safdie has designed six of Canada's principal public institutions—including the [[National Gallery of Canada]] in Ottawa, and [[Vancouver Public Library|Vancouver Library Square]]—as well as many other notable projects around the world, including the [[Salt Lake City Public Library|Salt Lake City Main Public Library]]; the [[Virasat-e-Khalsa|Khalsa Heritage Centre]] in Punjab, India; the [[Marina Bay Sands]] integrated resort in Singapore; the [[United States Institute of Peace Headquarters]] in Washington, DC; the [[Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts]] in Kansas City, Missouri; and the [[Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art]] in Bentonville, Arkansas.

==Architectural style==
[[File:Marina_Bay_Sands_in_the_evening_-_20101120.jpg|thumb|Marina Bay Sands, Singapore]]
Moshe Safdie's works are known for their dramatic curves, arrays of geometric patterns, use of windows, and key placement of open and green spaces. His writings and designs stress the need to create meaningful, vital, and inclusive spaces that enhance community, with special attention to the essence of a particular locale, geography, and culture.

He is a self-described modernist.

==Awards and recognition==
* Gold Medal, American Institute of Architects
* Companion of the Order of Canada
* Gold Medal, Royal Architectural Institute of Canada
* Richard Neutra Award for Professional Excellence
* Mt. Scopus Award for Humanitarianism, Jerusalem

In November 2011, Punjab Chief Minister honoured Safdie at the inauguration ceremony of the Khalsa Heritage Museum. He said Safdie had studied Sikh religion for two years before designing the heritage museum. Safdie said he wanted the museum to look 300 years old and he thought he had succeeded in this objective.

The '''National Archaeological Museum''' ({{lang-es|Museo Arqueológico Nacional}}) is a museum in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]. It is located on Serrano Street beside the [[Plaza de Colón (Madrid)|Plaza de Colón]] (''Columbus Square''), sharing its building with the [[Biblioteca Nacional de España|National Library]].

The museum was founded in 1867 by a Royal Decree of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] as a depository for numismatic, archaeological, ethnographical and decorative art collections of the Spanish monarchs.

The museum was originally located in the [[Embajadores]] district of Madrid. In 1895, it moved to a building designed specifically to house it, a [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] design by architect Francisco Jareño, built from 1866 to 1892. In 1968, renovation and extension works considerably increased its area. The museum closed for renovation in 2008 and reopened in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://man.mcu.es/ Official website] (in Spanish), plus information from Madrid Tourist Office etc, as at November 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  The remodelled museum concentrates on its core archaeological role, rather than decorative arts.&lt;!-- unclear -- were these given to other museums? put in storage? --&gt;

Its collection is based on pieces from the [[Iberian Peninsula]], from [[Prehistoric Iberia|Prehistory]] to [[Early modern period|Early-Modern Age]]. However, it also has different collections coming from outside of Spain, especially from [[Ancient Greece]], both from the metropolitan and, above all, from [[Magna Graecia]], and, to a lesser extent, from [[Ancient Egypt]], in addition to "a small number of pieces" from [[Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite

The cave was most likely used by [[Mesoamerica]]n cultures such as the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] and [[Mixtec]] as well.

The cave gets its name from a natural rock bridge formation above it.  The cave functioned as a sacred entrance into the basin.  Several Coixtlahuaca [[codices]] refer to this cave.  In [[codex]] depictions, the cave was believed to be the place where [[Quetzalcoatl]] descended from heaven.

There are several pre-Columbian [[Mesoamerican writing systems|inscriptions]] at the Ndaxagua site.  These murals in the cave depict [[anthropomorphic figures]] with protruding beak-like mask.  Another mural shows a deer ready to be sacrificed by a figure holding a blades.  Another sacrificial mural is present as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12728">'''O'Rahilly's historical model''' is a theory of the history of [[prehistoric Ireland]] in the [[Iron Age]] put forward by the linguist [[T. F. O'Rahilly]] in 1946. It was based on his study of the influences on the [[Irish language]] and a critical analysis of [[Irish mythology]].

He distinguished four separate waves of [[Celts|Celtic]] invaders:

* The [[Cruthin|Cruithne]] or [[Priteni]] (c. 700 &amp;ndash; 500 BC) 
* The [[Builg]] or Érainn/[[Iverni]] (c. 500 BC) 
* The [[Laigin]], [[Fir Domnann]] and Gálioin (c. 300 BC) 
* The Goidels or [[Gaels]] (c. 100 BC)

O'Rahilly's work was and remains influential but much of his linguistic work has since been refuted by noted authors such as [[Kenneth H. Jackson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=Kenneth H.|authorlink1=Kenneth H. Jackson|title=Language and History in Early Britain|date=1953|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John T. Koch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koch|first1=J. T.|title=Eriu, Alba, and Letha: when was a language ancestral to Gaelic first spoken in Ireland?|journal=Emania|date=1991|volume=9|series=Bulletin of the Navan Research Group|location=Belfast}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is not generally the accepted model.  Irish archaeologists have fairly consistently failed to support the theory, as archaeological evidence of these waves of settlement is lacking.  

==The Pretanic colonisation==
According to O'Rahilly's model, between 700 and 500 BC, iron-wielding, [[Celtic languages|Celtic-speaking]] people first settled in [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]] from the continent. They spoke a [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic language]] and called themselves ''Priteni'' or ''Pritani''. The impact they had upon the native inhabitants can be inferred from the fact that [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] geographers were referring to these islands as the “[[Britain (place name)|Pretanic Islands]]” ({{lang|grc|αι Πρετανικαι νησοι}}) by at least 300 BC. It is also possible that the very name “Britain” is derived from Priteni. 

However, there is no hard evidence for a Pretanic invasion as such. It is much more likely that their settlement of these islands was a gradual one, spread over several centuries.

In Britain, these Priteni were absorbed by later invaders and lost their cultural identity, except in the far north where they were known to the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] as the [[Picts|''Picti'']] "painted people", on account of their practice of decorating their bodies with tattoos (a practice which by then had died out among other Celtic nations).

In Ireland, too, the Priteni were largely absorbed by later settlers; but a few pockets of them managed to retain a measure of cultural, if not political, independence well into the Christian era. By then they were identified as ''Cruithne'', a Goidelic adaptation of the Brittonic word Priteni. Both words are derived from a root meaning “to shape” or “create.” Celtic tribes generally gave themselves names which were the pluralised forms of names they gave to their deities (in this case “the Creator”). Among the Cruthin tribes that survived into the Christian era the most prominent were the [[Dál nAraidi]] in [[Ulster]], and the ''Loíges'' and ''Fothairt'' in [[Leinster]]. The name of the second of these tribes, modernized as ''Laois'', has been revived and given to [[County Laois]], Leinster (formerly "Queen's County").

==The Bolgic or Ernean invasion==
Around 500 BC the Cruthin lost their dominant position in Irish society when the country was invaded by a second wave of P-Celtic speakers. These were the Builg or Érainn. The former name (originally Bolgi) identifies them as [[Belgae]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Lavin|first=Patrick|authorlink=Patrick Lavin|title=The Shaping of the Celtic World: And the Resurgence of the Celtic Consciousness in the 19th and 20th Centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rCEaTjdryQoC&amp;pg=PA117|year=2011|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-1-4620-6088-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Poste|first=Beale|title=Celtic Inscriptions on Gaulish and British Coins: Intended to Supply Materials for the Early History of Great Britain.

Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Celtic people mentioned by [[Julius Caesar]] in ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]''.

Their other name, originally Iverni, is probably the origin of several of the early Classical names for Ireland: the Greek Ιερνη; Ιουερνια and possibly also the [[Latin]] ''[[Hibernia]]''. In Irish mythology, the name [[Fir Bolg]] obviously refers to the same people. It appears that groups of these Belgae colonised Britain and Ireland in the late sixth or early fifth century. In both islands they absorbed and subjugated most of the previous inhabitants.

Among the more prominent Ernean tribes were the following:

*The [[Uluti]] ([[Middle Irish]]: [[Ulaid]]), after whom Ulster is named. For centuries the Uluti were the dominant tribe in the north of the country. They founded [[Navan Fort]], the traditional capital of Ulster, near [[Armagh]]. In later historical times their descendants were known as the [[Dál Fiatach]] and were confined to the eastern half of [[County Down]]. 
*The [[Darini]] and Robogdii (or Reidodioi), two tribes whose territory was in Antrim and north Down. They were probably the ancestors of the historical [[Dál Riata]] or Dál Riada, who colonised [[Scotland]] in the 5th century of the common era and from whom the kings of Scotland were descended. 
*The [[Iverni]], the dominant Ernean tribe in [[Munster]] from whom the Érainn as a whole took their name. The [[Corcu Loígde]] of historical times were their descendants. 
* The Ebdani, a tribe of the east coast whose name appears as Eblani in [[Ptolemy]]'s description of Ireland in his [[Geography (Ptolemy)|''Geography'']]. He calls their settlement [[Eblana]].

==The Laginian invasion==
According to O'Rahilly, about two centuries after the Bolgic invasion, Ireland was subjected to another invasion of Brittonic speakers. Three names can be distinguished for them, but whether they were one tribe with three different names or three closely allied but separate tribes we cannot say. These names, as given in later written records, are Laigin, Domnainn and Gálioin. According to their own traditions, they came to Ireland from [[Armorica]] ([[Brittany]]). They landed in the southeast of the country and took the southeastern quarter from the Érainn. The modern name of this province, [[Leinster]] (Irish: Laighin), preserves the memory of this Laginian conquest, although in ancient times it was much smaller than the modern province. Before the Goidelic invasion, the [[River Liffey]] marked the boundary between Ulster and Leinster. The Domnainn were clearly a branch of the [[Dumnonii]], a Celtic people identified by Classical authors as inhabiting [[Dumnonia]] (the English counties of [[Cornwall]] and [[Devon]], to which they gave their name). Another branch of the Dumnonii settled in Scotland, where they founded [[Dumbarton]] and established the kingdom later known as [[Strathclyde]]. Presumably these settlements occurred at around the same time as the Laginian invasion of Ireland. It is even possible that the Dumnonii of Scotland were originally Irish Domnainn.

The Laginian invasion made little impact in Ulster or Munster, where Ernean tribes continued to be the dominant force. But the same cannot be said for [[Connacht]], the westernmost of the four provinces. Sometime in the third century (all these dates, it should be pointed out, are highly conjectural) they crossed the [[River Shannon]] and subjugated the Ernean tribes of Connacht. The decisive battle, the ''[[Cath Maige Tuired]]'', was fought in [[County Sligo]] in a place called Mag Tuired. There a Laginian king (possibly known as Cairbre) overthrew the Érainn and drove them out of Connacht. According to Irish records the defeated Érainn sought refuge in many of the islands around Ireland. The fortresses of [[Dún Aonghasa]] and [[Dún Conor]] on the [[Aran Islands]], and [[Dún Balor]] on [[Tory Island]], are thought to have been built by them.

O'Rahilly claims that it was probably as a result of the Laginian conquests that Ireland first came to be divided into four provinces. The Érainn continued to rule in Ulster and Munster, while the Lagin and their allies became the dominant force in Leinster and Connacht. Traditionally these four provinces met at the exact centre of the country, which was marked by the [[Hill of Uisneach]] (between [[Mullingar]] and [[Athlone]] in [[County Westmeath]]), a name which may mean "vertex" or "angular place". The district immediately surrounding this hill was originally called ''Medion'' "middle", and is the origin of the name of [[County Meath]]. Julius Caesar informs us that the druids of [[Gaul]] regularly assembled at a hallowed spot in the centre of the country to celebrate their rituals (''De Bello Gallico'' 6.13). Irish tradition records that a similar assembly, the Mórdáil Uisnig, periodically took place at the Hill of Uisneach on [[Beltane]], the May-day festival.

==The Goidelic invasion==
The fourth and final Celtic invasion of Ireland was the Goidelic or Gaelic invasion. Unlike the previous invaders, the Goidels spoke a Q-Celtic language, which was the forerunner of Modern Irish, [[Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Manx language|Manx]]. The P-Celtic dialects which were spoken in the country at the time of their arrival (and which they referred to as Iarnbélre, “language of the Érainn”) eventually became extinct. The Goidels originated in [[Gallia Aquitania]] in southwestern Gaul. Around 100 BC two groups of these Celts emigrated to Ireland:

The [[Connachta]] were named after [[Conn of the Hundred Battles]], a mythical ancestor who was later [[Euhemerism|euhemerized]] and given a place in Irish history. The Connachta were led by a man known to later history as [[Túathal Techtmar]]. They landed at the mouth of the [[River Boyne|Boyne]] and pushed inland to [[Tara, Ireland|Tara]], the seat of the local Ernean king, which they sacked. They soon carved out for themselves a new province between Ulster and Leinster, running from the mouth of the Liffey to the mouth of the Boyne and inland as far as the Shannon. In time, this fifth province came to be known as “Meath,” presumably for no other reason than that it contained the Hill of Uisnech.

The other group were known as the [[Eóganachta]]. Their leader is known to history as Mogh (or Mug) Nuadat. The Eoganachta landed at a place called ''Inber Scéne'', usually identified with [[Kenmare]] River in the southwest of the country. Unlike the Connachta, they did not carve out a new province for themselves. Instead, they slowly but gradually rose in power, eventually becoming the dominant force in Munster. The names Eóganachta and Mug Nuadat, which were probably adopted after their arrival, suggest that initially there were friendly relations between them and the Érainn, as both names are derived from the titles of Ernean deities. 
Early in their history, the Connachta subjugated the Laginian tribes of Leinster and reduced them to a state of vassalage. The Laginian leaders were allowed to retain possession of their territory, but a heavy tribute was imposed upon them. Known as the Bórama (or Bórú), it continued to be exacted at irregular intervals until the 8th century of the common era. According to one tradition, it was Tuathal Techtmar himself who first imposed this tribute on the Lagin.

As their name suggests, the Connachta did not stop when they reached the Shannon. At an indeterminable point in history, some of them crossed the Shannon and conquered the western province, bestowing their name on it in the process. By the late 4th century of the common era Ireland was divided politically into five provinces or "overkingdoms":

*Ulster was still dominated by Ernean tribes 
*Meath, or the Midland territory, included Tara and was ruled by Gaelic tribes 
*Leinster was held by Gaelicized tribes subject to Meath 
*Munster was ruled by Gaelic tribes 
*Connacht was ruled by Gaelic tribes

As can be seen, most of the country was in the hands of the Gael. Only Ulster remained independent, but this was not to last.

'''''Orestes and Electra''''' has been the subject and title of several works of art, including two different sculptural groups in the collections of the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]].

==Clothed==
One is a 2.1m high [[Hellenistic_civilization|Hellenistic]] sculpture, once thought to depict [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]] and [[Electra]].  It shows a heavily draped adult female on the right, looking down on and apparently beckoning a partially nude younger male or child, who looks up at her.

A marble copy was produced between 1685 and 1688 for the [[Palace of Versailles]], copied from a cast of the original entrusted to Benoît Massou then Martin Carlier and to Michel Monier. It was initially interpreted as''Peace between the Greeks and the Roman'' but was later interpreted as relating the episode in which the young [[Papirius]], known as Praetextatus, having been permitted to attend a sitting of the Roman Senate with his father, thwarts his mother's curiosity by humorously telling her that the Senate had been debating whether it were better for the State that a man have two wives or a woman have two husbands. It was placed in the Ballroom Grove in 1738, moved to the [[Tuileries Garden]] during the [[French Revolution]] and in the 19th century replaced ''Poetus and Arria on the Green Carpet'' in the Main Perspective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chateauversailles.fr/en/1_Adopt_a_statue_in_the_Park.php Chateau de Versailles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928030426/http://www.chateauversailles.fr/en/1_Adopt_a_statue_in_the_Park.php |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nude male==
The other depicts a young nude male and a young clothed female, of the same age and height, leaning on each other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.forbes.com/images/2002/03/20/conn3_201x313.jpg Image] from [https://www.forbes.com/2002/03/20/0320connguide.html Forbes.com.]&lt;/ref&gt;  This is now thought to be Orestes and Electra.

'''Phanagoria''' ({{lang-grc|Φαναγόρεια|Phanagóreia}}) was the largest [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] city on the [[Taman peninsula]], spread over two plateaus along the eastern shore of the [[Cimmerian Bosporus]].
 
The city was a large [[Emporia (ancient Greece)|emporium]] for all the traffic between the coast of the [[Maeotian Swamp|Maeotian marshes]] and the countries on the southern side of the [[Caucasus]]. It was the eastern capital of the [[Bosporan Kingdom]], with [[Panticapaeum]] being the western capital. [[Strabo]] described it as a noteworthy city which was renowned for its trade.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, ''[[Geographica]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-eng1:11.2.10 11.2.10]&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly a Catholic Metropolitan Archdiocese while a medieval Genoese colony under the name '''Matrega''', it remains a Latin Catholic [[titular see]].
 
Today the site is located at a short distance to the west of [[Sennoy, Krasnodar Krai|Sennoy]] in [[Krasnodar Krai]], [[Russia]]. Another ancient Greek city, [[Hermonassa]], lies {{convert|25|km}} to the west, on the shoreline of modern [[Taman, Russia|Taman]].

== History ==

=== Antiquity ===
[[File:Greek colonies of the Northern Euxine Sea (Black Sea).svg|left|thumb|350x350px|Phanagoria and other ancient Greek colonies along the north coast of the Black Sea, 8th to 3rd century BC]]
Phanagoria was founded ca. 543&amp;nbsp;BC by the [[Teos|Teian]] colonists who had to flee [[Asia Minor]] in consequence of their conflict with [[Cyrus the Great]]. The city took its name after one of these colonists, Phanagoras. "The unusual nature of the Taman peninsula near Phanagoria, with its ravines, crevices, hills, and low cones of active volcanoes, must have impressed the ancient colonists even more than it impresses us today", [[Yulia Ustinova]] has observed.&lt;ref&gt;Ustinova, Yulia. ''The Supreme Gods of the Bosporan Kingdom''. Brill Academic Publishers, 1999. p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 5th century BC, the town thrived on the trade with the [[Scythians]] and [[Sindi (people)|Sindi]]. Located on an island in the ancient archipelago of Corocondamitis, between the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Palus Maeotis]], Phanagoria covered an area of {{convert|75|ha}} of which one third has been submerged by the sea. In the early 4th century BC the burgeoning [[Bosporan Kingdom]] subjugated much of [[Sindica]], including the independent polis of Phanagoria. The town's importance increased with the decline of the old capital, [[Panticapaeum]], situated on the opposite shore of the Bosporus. By the first centuries AD, Phanagoria had emerged as the main centre of the kingdom.

During the [[Mithridatic Wars]], the town allied with the [[Roman Republic]] and withstood a siege by the army of [[Pharnaces II of Pontus]]. It was at Phanagoria that the insurrection broke out against [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]], shortly before his death; and his sons, who held the citadel, were obliged to surrender to the insurgents. An inscription found during excavations testifies that Queen [[Dynamis (Bosporan queen)|Dynamis]] honored [[Augustus]] as "the emperor, [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]], [[Divi filius|son of a god]], the god Augustus, the overseer of every land and sea".&lt;ref&gt;D. Kendall, G. O'Collins, S. T. Davis. ''The Trinity''. Oxford University Press, 2002. p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The loyalty to Rome allowed Phanagoria to maintain a dominant position in the region until the 4th century, when it was sacked and destroyed by the invading [[Huns]].

=== Middle Ages ===
By the 7th century, the town had recovered from a century of barbarian invasions. It served as the capital of [[Old Great Bulgaria]] between 632 and 665 under [[Kubrat]] and [[Batbayan]].
 
Afterwards Phanagoria became (at least nominally) a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] dependency. A [[Khazar]] [[tudun]] was nonetheless present in the town and ''de facto'' control probably rested in Khazar hands until the defeat of [[Georgius Tzul]] in 1016. In 704, the deposed [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Justinian II]] settled in Phanagoria (then governed by the Khazar tudun [[Balgatzin]]) with his wife Theodora, a sister of the Khazar [[Khagan]] [[Busir Glavan]], before returning to [[Constantinople]] by way of [[Bulgaria]].

In the 10th century, the town seems to have faced an invasion, supposedly by [[the Rus]]. After that, Phanagoria could not compete in significance with neighboring [[Tmutarakan]].
 
In the late [[Middle Ages]] the town of '''Matrega''' was built on its ruins; the site was part of a network of [[Genoa|Genoese]] possessions along the northern [[Black Sea]] coast. During the 15th century, it was the center of [[de Ghisolfi]] dominions. Henceforth there has been no permanent settlement on the site.

== Ecclesiastical history ==
The Genoese colony was canonically established on 1349.02.21 as '''Metropolitan Archdiocese of Matriga'''. It was suppressed around 1400 AD. 
* Recorded incumbent : Giovanni di Zechia, [[Friars Minor]] (O.F.M.) (1349.02.22 – 1363?)

=== Titular see ===
The diocese was nominally restored as a Latin Catholic [[titular bishopric]] in 1928 under the name Matriga, which was changed in 1929 already to '''Matrega'''.
 
It is vacant, having had the following incumbents, all of the lowest (episcopal) rank :
* Titular Bishop [[Teofilius Matulionis]] (1928.12.08 – 1943.01.09), as [[Auxiliary Bishop]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mohilev|Mohilev]] ([[Belarus]]) (1928.12.08 – 1943.01.09); later Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Kaišiadorys|Kaišiadorys]] ([[Lithuania]]) (1943.01.09 – 1962.08.20) and on emeritate created [[Archbishop ad personam]] (1962.02.09 – death 1962.08.20)

The location of Phanagoria was determined in the 18th century, when marble statue bases with dedications to [[Aphrodite]] were discovered there.

Tsetskhladze). Brill Academic Publishers, 2001. p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the ancient city itself, archaeologists have been interested in a vast [[necropolis]], which spreads on three sides around Phanagoria. There are thousands of burials, many with cypress or marble sarcophagi — an indication of the well-being of the ancient Phanagorians. Excavations conducted in the 19th century were for the most part amateurish; as many as twelve [[kurgan]]s would be razed each season. Some of the most intriguing finds were unearthed in the 1860s at the Bolshaya Bliznitsa tumulus, classed by [[Michael Rostovtzeff]] as a feminine necropolis with three vaults.

One of the royal kurgans near Phanagoria "has a stone stairway leading down to a rectangular passageway, the entrance to the burial chamber (3.70 × 3.75 × 4.70&amp;nbsp;m). These two areas are covered by an arch showing remains of painted decoration. The wall frescos imitate encrusted marble. On either side of the entrance to the tomb long stone boxes contain four horse burials along with rich grave gifts; saddlery and harnesses of gold and gilded bronze."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from ''The Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites.'' (eds. Stillwell, Richard. MacDonald, William L. McAlister, Marian Holland). Princeton University Press, 1976. {{ISBN|0-691-03542-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vladimir Blavatsky]] resumed excavations of Phanagoria in 1936. Among the recent finds is an inscription indicating that a [[synagogue]] existed in Phanagoria as early as 51&amp;nbsp;AD. Underwater investigation of the site has revealed multiple fragments of architectural structures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5695">'''Pirate utopias''' were defined by [[anarchist]] writer [[Peter Lamborn Wilson]], who coined the term in his 1995 book ''Pirate Utopias: Moorish Corsairs &amp; European Renegadoes'' as secret islands once used for supply purposes by [[pirate]]s. Wilson's concept is largely based on speculation, although he admits to adding a bit of fantasy to the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wilson |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Lamborn Wilson |url=http://hermetic.com/bey/pirate-utopias/pirate-utopias.html |title=Pirate Utopias: Moorish Corsairs &amp; European Renegadoes |publisher=[[Autonomedia]]|ISBN=1-57027-158-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Wilson's view, these pirate enclaves were early forms of autonomous proto-[[anarchism|anarchist]] societies in that they operated beyond the reach of [[government]]s and embraced unrestricted [[Freedom (political)|freedom]].

== On the Barbary Coast ==
Located on the [[Barbary Coast]] ([[Salé]], [[Algiers]] and [[Tunis]]), these bases were havens for renegade [[Muslim]] pirates from the 16th to the 18th century. The pirates, dubbed "[[Barbary Corsairs]]", ravaged European shipping operations and enslaved many thousands of captives. However, thousands of Europeans also converted to Islam, forming the "Renegados" and joining the pirate [[religious war|holy war]]. Wilson writes that these men and women were not only [[Apostasy|apostates]] and [[Treason|traitors]], as they were considered in their homelands, but their voluntary betrayal of [[Christendom]] can also be thought of as a [[praxis (process)|praxis]] of social resistance.  Wilson focuses on the Pirate [[Republic of Salé]], in 17th century Morocco, which may have had its own lingua franca. Like some other pirate states, it even used to pass treaties from time to time with some European countries, agreeing not to attack their fleets. Wilson/Bey's idea of [[Temporary Autonomous Zone]]s developed from his historical review of pirate utopias. When describing them Wilson says "We've certainly had to use our imagination more than a "real" historian would allow, erecting a lot of suppositions on a shaky framework of generalizations, and adding a touch of fantasy (and what [[Pirate studies|piratologist]] has ever been able to resist fantasy?). I can only say that I've satisfied my own curiosity at least to this extent: That something like a [[Renegado]] culture could have existed; that all the ingredients for it were present, and [[Contiguity (psychology)|contiguous]], and [[Synchronicity|synchronic]]."

==Libertatia==
{{mainarticle|Libertatia}}
[[Libertatia]] (also known as Libertalia) was a possibly fictional anarchist colony founded in the late 17th century in [[Madagascar]] by [[pirate]]s under the leadership of Captain James Misson. Whether or not Libertatia actually existed is disputed. It is described in the book ''[[A General History of the Pyrates]]'' by [[Charles Johnson (pirate biographer)|Captain Charles Johnson]], an otherwise unknown individual who may have been a [[pseudonym]] of [[Daniel Defoe]]. Much of the book is a mixture of fact and fiction, and it is possible the account of Libertatia is entirely fabricated.

According to Johnson's description, Libertatia lasted for about 25 years. The precise location is not known, however, most sources say it stretched from the [[Bay of Antongil]] to [[Mananjary, Fianarantsoa|Mananjary]], including [[Île Sainte Marie]] and [[Mahavelona|Foulpointe]]. [[Thomas Tew]], Misson, and an Italian Dominican priest named Caraccioli were involved in founding it.

== In literature and popular culture ==
''[[Cities of the Red Night]]'', a novel by American author [[William S. Burroughs]], revolves around a group of radical pirates who seek the freedom to live under the articles set out by [[Libertatia|Captain James Misson]].

The attempted establishment of a [[Republic of Pirates]] utopia (free from either British or Spanish rule) is a significant plot element in the [[Ubisoft]] video game ''[[Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag]]''.

In the movie ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean 3: At World's End]]'' the main characters gather at "Shipwreck Cove", a city built out of wrecked ships and constructed platforms. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://za.ign.com/pirates-of-the-caribbean-dead-men-tell-no-tales/106716/feature/pirates-of-the-caribbean-the-story-so-far|title=Pirates of the Caribbean: The Story So Far|author=|date=17 May 2017|website=ign.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Libertalia is also a central plot element and setting in the video game ''[[Uncharted 4: A Thief's End]]''. However, in this interpretation, Libertalia was founded by the pirate [[Henry Avery]] and others including Tew, [[Anne Bonny]] and [[Edward England]].

The 2015 video game ''[[Fallout 4]]'' features an area in the game called Libertalia. The area is a series of off-shore platforms (made of various debris) that has become home to a large gang of raiders.

[[File:Joke - phone books in doorway.jpg|thumb|upright|Practical joke involving completely blocking someone's doorway with [[phone book]]s]]

A '''practical joke''', or '''prank''', is a mischievous trick played on someone, generally causing the victim to experience embarrassment, perplexity, confusion, or discomfort.&lt;ref name="dictionary.reference.com"&gt;{{ cite web| url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/practical%20joke?fromAsk=true&amp;o=100074 |title= Practical joke|publisher = Dictionary.com|accessdate= 2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marsh, Moira 2015"&gt;Marsh, Moira. 2015. ''Practically Joking''. Logan: Utah State University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-87421-983-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person who performs a practical joke is called a "practical joker".&lt;ref name="dictionary.reference.com"/&gt; Other terms for practical jokes include '''gag''', '''jape''', or '''shenanigan'''.

Practical jokes differ from [[confidence trick]]s or [[hoax]]es in that the victim finds out, or is let in on the joke, rather than being talked into handing over money or other valuables. Practical jokes are generally lighthearted and without lasting impact; they aim to make the victim feel humbled or foolish, but not victimized or [[humiliation | humiliated]]. Thus most practical jokes are affectionate gestures of humour and designed to encourage [[laughter]]. However, practical jokes performed with [[cruelty]] can constitute [[bullying]], whose intent is to harass or exclude rather than reinforce social bonds through ritual humbling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Relational Rituals and Communication: Ritual Interaction in Groups|page= 156

Some countries in [[Western culture]] traditionally emphasize the carrying out of practical jokes on [[April Fools' Day]].&lt;ref name=EconJape&gt;

==Description==

A practical joke is "practical" because it consists of someone doing something physical, in contrast to a verbal or written joke. For example, the joker who is setting up and conducting the practical joke might hang a bucket of water above a [[door]]way and rig the bucket using pulleys so when the door opens the bucket dumps the water. The joker would then wait for the victim to walk through the doorway and be drenched by the bucket of water. [[practical joke device|Objects]] can also be used in practical jokes, like [[fake vomit]], [[chewing gum bug]]s, [[exploding cigar]]s, [[stink bomb]]s, [[costume]]s and [[whoopee cushion]]s.

Practical jokes often occur inside [[office]]s, usually to surprise co-workers. Covering the computer accessories with Jell-O, wrapping the desk with Christmas paper or aluminium foil or filling it with balloons are just some examples of office pranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web| url= http://www.weirdomatic.com/funny-office-pranks.html |title=Funny Office Pranks|publisher =Weirdomatic.com|accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Practical jokes are also common occurrences during [[sleepover]]s, whereby teens will play pranks on their friends as they come into the home, enter a room or even as they sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web| url= http://www.terrysblinds.co.uk/infographics/10-pranks-to-play-on-friends/ |title=Funny Sleepover Pranks|publisher =Terrysblinds.co.uk|accessdate=2014-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American humorist [[H. Allen Smith]] wrote a 320-page book in 1953 called ''The Compleat Practical Joker'' ({{ISBN|0-688-03705-4}}) that contains numerous examples of practical jokes. The book became a best seller not only in the United States but also in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|magazine=Publishers Weekly|volume=209|page=2:24
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jAtFAQAAIAAJ
|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moira Marsh has written an entire volume about practical jokes.&lt;ref name="Marsh, Moira 2015"/&gt; One of her findings is that in the USA they are more often done by males than females.

== Famous examples ==

A practical joke recalled as his favorite by the [[playwright]] [[Charles MacArthur]], concerns the American painter and [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] character [[Waldo Peirce]]. While living in [[Paris]] in the 1920s, Peirce "made a gift of a very big [[turtle]] to the woman who was the [[concierge]] of his building". The woman doted on the turtle and lavished care on it. A few days later Peirce substituted a somewhat larger turtle for the original one. This continued for some time, with larger and larger turtles being surreptitiously introduced into the woman's apartment. The concierge was beside herself with happiness and displayed her miraculous turtle to the entire neighborhood. Peirce then began to sneak in and replace the turtle with smaller and smaller ones, to her bewildered distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fun Fare: a Treasury of Reader's Digest Wit and Humor|page=36

Modern and successful pranks often take advantage of the modernization of tools and techniques. In Canada, engineering students have a reputation for annual pranks; at the [[University of British Columbia]] these usually involve leaving a Volkswagen Beetle in an unexpected location (such as suspended from the Golden Gate Bridge&lt;ref&gt;Curiel, Jonathan.

Not unlike the [[Stone Louse]] of Germany, in the American West the [[jackalope]] has become an institutionalized practical joke perennially perpetrated by ruralites (as a class) on [[tourism|tourists]], most of whom have never heard of the decades-old myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Deception|page=555

The 2003 TV movie ''[[Windy City Heat]]'', consists of an elaborate practical joke on the film's star, Perry Caravallo, who is led to believe that he is starring in a faux action film, ''Windy City Heat'', where the filming which is ostensibly for the film's DVD extras actually documents the long chain of pranks and jokes performed at Caravallo's expense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=Grantland|title=The Greatest Trick Comedy Ever Pulled|date=2013-11-12|first=Steven|last=Hyden|url=http://grantland.com/features/windy-city-heat-10-years-later-history-comedy-store/|accessdate=2015-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saang''' ({{lang-hi|सांग}}), also known as '''Swang''' (meaning "initiation")&lt;ref&gt;Sachchidananda'' Encyclopaedic Profile of Indian Tribes'' Volume 1 - 1996 817141298X p416 "DANCE DETAILS One of the major dance forms of the Saharia is 'Swang' meaning imitation. In this form of dance the Saharias imitate human beings, "&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Svang''' ({{lang|hi|स्वांग}}), is a popular [[folk dance]]–[[theatre]] form in [[Rajasthan]], [[Haryana]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Malwa]] region of [[Madhya Pradesh]]. Swang incorporates suitable theatrics and [[Impressionist (entertainment)|mimicry]] (or ''nakal'') accompanied by song and dialogue. It is dialogue-oriented rather than movement-oriented. Religious stories and folk tales are enacted by a group of ten or twelve persons in an open area or an open-air theatre surrounded by the audience.Swang as an art of imitation means Rang-Bharna, Nakal-Karna.

Swang can be considered as the most ancient folk theatre form of India. Nautanki, Saang, Tamasha originated from the Swang traditions. Old Swang traditions are: &lt;blockquote&gt;"EK MARDANA EK JANANA MANCH PAR ADE THE RAI"&lt;/blockquote&gt; means one male and one female performers start the story. &lt;blockquote&gt;"EK SAARANGI EK DHOLAKIA SAATH MEIN ADE THE RAI"&lt;/blockquote&gt;
means one saangi player and one dholak player joins the performance. This Swang/Saang performance was active at the time of Sant Kabir and Guru Nanak.

Tradition credits [[Kishan Lal Bhaat]] for laying the foundation of the present style of Swang about two hundred years ago. During Mughal period and specifically at the time of Aurangzeb women were strictly banned from public performances. Since women did not participate in the dance-drama form, men have traditionally enacted their roles.Later on different performers changed the style according to the socio-political situations.

==Features==
Stage is similar to operatic performance.The stage may consist of a clear circular open area, or at the most, a wooden platform about three and a half metre in length. There are no elaborate stage arrangements similar to modern dramatic performances. There are no backdrops, curtains or green-rooms. Typically, there are no microphones or loudspeakers either. An hour or so before the show, the musicians of the orchestra begin to sing religious or other songs connected with the play in order to create the proper atmosphere for the play. The '[[Guru]]' then appears and the artistes touch his feet to evoke his blessings. The play opens with a song ('bhait' or offering) in praise of [[Devi|Bhawani]], the Goddess of Knowledge:

''Aa re bhawani baas kar mere ghat ke parde khol''
''Rasna par basa karo maai shudh shabd mukh bol''

(Oh Goddess Bhawani, open the doors of knowledge to me. Bless my tongue so that all I sing consists of pure surs.)

After Bhawani there are Chamolas, Kafias, Savias the main ingredients of performance. Googa Dhamoda a dance form starts at the beginning. With a brief introduction about the play, the performance starts. It consists mainly of mimicry, from which the name of the theater form derives (''swaang'' means disguise or impersonation). Also featured prominently are long question and answer sessions between the actors. Much of the dialogue is improvised and the actors must be able to trade quotations, puns, proverbs and songs at the drop of a hat. There is much singing and dancing and there is always a clown character called the ''makhaulia'' (jester). Swang theatre is traditionally restricted to men, who also play the female roles, the latter often involving elaborate make-up and costumes. But female troupes are not altogether unknown.

A single presentation of ''swaang'' may continue for up to five or six hours. There is much song and music, especially the famous [[Haryanvi]] style of singing known as ''[[Haryanvi Raagni|Raagani]]''.

==Themes==
Swang themes draw variously from themes of morality, folk tales, lives of inspiring personalities, stories from Indian mythology and in recent times, more current themes like health and hygiene, literacy, AIDS awareness and [[women's empowerment]]. In temple based religious theatre, Indian epics and Puranas are the major source material for characters, while the community-based secular theatre is of lighter variety. Several themes may be mixed together - mythological love, popular history, and religious themes, all with overtones of secular values. All dramas typically end with the victory of good over evil.

Popular mythological themes include Raja Vikramaditya, Ranveer- Padmavat, Jaani Chor, [[Prahlada|Prahlad Bhagat]], Gopi Chand, [[Bharthari (king)|Bharthari]], [[Harishchandra|Harishchander]], [[Bhoja|Raja Bhoj]], [[Kichaka|Kichak]] Badh, [[Draupadi]] [[Chir Haran]], [[Jaani Chor]], [[Pingla Bharthri]] and other tales from old literature. Also popular are Punjabi romances like Pooran Bhagat, [[Heer Ranjha]], etc. Historical and semi-historical themes include Raja Rissalu, Amar Singh Rathor, Sarwar Neer, Jaswant Singh, [[Swami Ramdev|Ramdevji]], etc. Other popular tales include romances like [[Dhaj, Ror Kumar|Sorath]], Nihalde, [[Padmavat]], etc.

[[File:Swang as duet.JPG|150px|right|thumb|Swang Duet GOPI_UDDHAV by Dr. Sandhya Sharma and Dr. Satish Kashyap]]

In Haryana the most celebrated name is that of [[Dip Chand Bahman]] of village [[Khanda, Sonipat]]. He was popularly known as [[Shakespeare]] or [[Kalidas]] of Haryana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.webindia123.com/hariyana/ART/folktheatre.htm|title=Folk theatre of Haryana- State in India|work=Webindia123.com|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He polished the style of Ali Bux and gave a new color to this folk art. The Saang of that time had two categories: (i) Kirtan Style and (ii) Nautanki Style. Dip Chand's style of performance incorporated elements from music, dance, pantomime, versification, and ballad recitation.
During the First World War, when Dip Chand's capacity for improvisation and adaptation was at its peak, the British Government made him a [[Rai Sahib]] and granted him other favours. His catchy song-compositions with martial tunes attracted large recruits to the army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.webindia123.com/hariyana/ART/folktheatre.htm|title=Haryana- Folk theatre of Haryana- State in India|website=www.webindia123.com|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The origin of swang is traced to Kishan Lal Bhaat, who some two hundred years ago is said to have laid the foundation of the present style of folk theatre. Another view gives credit for this to Kavi Shankar Dass, a poet artiste, who belonged to [[Meerut]]. Another notable early pioneer was Ali Bux of [[Rewari]], who successfully staged plays titled Fasanai, Azad and Padmawat. For music and song, these early Swaang drew on [[khayal]]s and [[chambola]]s. The stage was most elementary, the actors performed from a central place among the audience. The light was provided by mashals (Roman torches).

There are five major Parnalis/traditions/gharanas prevalent during this period.
* [[Dip Chand Bahman]]
* Pt [[Lakhmi Chand]]
* [[Jat Mehar Singh]]
* [[Baje Bhagat]]
* Pt Mange Ram
Pt Surya Bhanu Shastri his disciple Dr Satish Kashyap and Dr Sandhya Sharma though belongs to Pt Lakhmi Chand gharana and staged major Swangs/saangs like Padmavat, Kichak Draupadi, Phool Singh Nautani and famous Jaani Chor but had performed in every major Gharanas breaking the orthodox Parnali/Gharana divided on the base of Brahmin/ Non- Brahmin, Caste and region based.

Hardeva polished his Chambola style and made some changes to Haryanvi ragni (folk song). Bjae Nai, a disciple of Hardeva, mixed both the styles of folk music. Pt. Nathu Ram, another well known Swaangi coached a number of talented pupils, which included Maan Singh, Bulli, Dina Lohar and Ram Singh. [[Anoop Lather]] a well known theatre person introduced Swang in Kurukshetra University and organised Swang Youth festivals and first time produced Swang Jaani Chor in proscenium with Satish Kashyap in 1999. [[Manish Joshi Bismil]] who is a noted theatre director of India belongs to Hisar is also known for developing Swang in Haryana. In year 2012 his recent production Lakhmiprem was a milestone work on Pandit Lakhmichand.Manish Joshi is recipient of Ustaad Bismillah Khan Yuva Puraskar by Sangeet Natak Akademi.He is working on Pandit Mangeram's biography.

Pt. Ramkishan Vyas of Narnaund ([[Hisar (city)|Hissar]]), formerly known as '[[Vyas ji]]', is a celebrity in the field of Haryanvi Saangs and Raagnis. He invented various concepts in presenting the raagnis to the public e.g. Soni and others. In addition, he has been deputed as Counseller and Consultants by [[Rohtak Aakashvani]] &amp; [[Kurukshetra Aakashvani]]. Haryana Government has also declared that the dominant universities of Haryana ([[Kurukshetra University]], [[Maharishi Dayanand University]], etc.) would include his autobiography and raagnis in their curriculum.

Dr. Satish Kashyap and Dr. Sandhya Sharma in the able guidance of Pandit Suraj Bhan Shastri, a disciple of Pt. [[Lakhmi Chand]] had done revolutionary changes in Swang performance. Revival of Swang traditions is utmost need to oxygen to the dying art. Dr Satish Kashyap, an internationally acclaimed Swang artist, is leading the only surviving Mandali of Swang. He performs both in Operatic as well as prosenium stage.  They performed at National and International levels viz. National School of Drama (NSD), New Delhi and in [[SPIC MACAY]] International Convention at IIT, Mumbai. They were selected in prestigious "BHARANGAM" organised by [[National School of Drama]], New Delhi. [[CCS Haryana Agricultural University]], [[Hisar (city)|Hisar]] in leadership of Dr. Satish Kashyap, also set up a unit for the promotion and preservation of Swang and produced and staged best productions, viz, [[Jaani Chor]], [[Raja Vikramaditya]], [[Phool Singh- Nautanki]] etc.

Dr. Sandhya Sharma is the sole female performer of Swang and has written and produced two new Swangs with her stage partner and mentor Dr Satish Kashyap. They are based on Mahabharata. New Swangs are GOPI-UDDAV and VEER- BARBRIK.

Towards the end of the 19th century, all-women ''Swaang'' troupes performed in western [[Uttar Pradesh]] and the adjoining ''Khaaddar'' area of [[Haryana]]. All parts in these troupes were played by women. Sardari of [[Kalayat]] ([[Jind]]), Natni of Gangaru, and Bali of Indri ([[Karnal]]) were some of the leaders of such troupes. In 1998, The Government of India has honored this renowned poet by the award from Rohtak Aakashwani for his incredible support to the rise of Haryanvi Lok Sahitya.His younger son, Satyanarayan Shastri is also continuing their task to rise the Haryanvi Lok Sahitya by his writing. Satyanarayan Shastri is a renowned singer of 'Ragnis' at aakashvani since 1983.
Pandit [[Lakhmi Chand]] of Jatti Kalan ([[Sonipat]]) is known as ''Surya Kavi'' (Sun Poet) in [[Haryanvi Raagnis]]. important Swang staged by him included [[Nala|Nal]] [[Damayanti|Damyanti]], [[Mirabai|Meera Bai]], [[Savitri and Satyavan|Satyavan Savitri]], Poorjan, Seth Tara Chand, [[Puran Bhagat]] and Shashi Lakarhara. [[Pt. Tuleram]], son of Pt Lakhmi Chand continued the tradition of performance and after him his son Vishnu is still performing in the remote villages of [[Haryana]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Rajasthan]].

'''''Science &amp; Spirit''''' is a discontinued American bimonthly magazine that covered scientific stories with an eye toward their spiritual implications. 

==History and profile==
It was launched by the [[John Templeton Foundation]] in 1989 as a newsletter, converted to a glossy magazine in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=George|title=Science and Religion: Bridging the Great Divide|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/30/science/essay-science-and-religion-bridging-the-great-divide.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|accessdate=18 October 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=30 June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; then repositioned for a general readership in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Templeton Foundation Publications|url=http://capabilities.templeton.org/2004/press03.html|work=John Templeton Foundation|accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding editor was Kevin Sharper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Michelle Roth|title=Dr. Kevin Sharpe, Union Institute &amp; University Professor, was Founding Editor of Science and Spirit Magazine|url=http://myunion.edu/2008/11/dr-kevin-sharpe-union-institute-university-professor-was-founding-editor-of-science-and-spirit-magazine/|accessdate=4 February 2016|work=Union Institute|date=18 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was published by Science &amp; Spirit Resources, Inc. five times a year during the initial period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Science &amp; Spirit Magazine to Hit Bookstores Nationwide|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/science--spirit-magazine-to-hit-bookstores-nationwide-ingram-periodicals-to-distribute-magazine-on-science-and-religion-74160377.html|accessdate=4 February 2016|work=PR Newswire|date=21 April 1999|location=Orlando}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, it was purchased by [[Heldref Publications]], though the John Templeton Foundation continued to provide editorial support.

'''Tahir Dizdari''' (1900&amp;ndash;1972) was an [[Albanians|Albanian]] [[oriental studies|orientalist]], [[folklorist]], and [[scholar]].&lt;ref name="Elsie"/&gt; He was the main orientalist in Albania, and contributed in identifying and studying oriental words borrowed from the [[Albanian language]].

==Life==
Dizdari the son of Nasuf Dizdari (1858-1940), a local folklorist and translator, and was born on 15 November 1900, in [[Shkodër]], today's Albania, back then still part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Dizdari family traces their origin from a military who had settled in Shkodër from [[İznik]] of the [[Province of Bursa]], today's [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| author=Hamdi Bushati| title=Shkodra dhe motet |trans-title=Shkoder and epochs|volume=II | page=292 |location=[[Shkodër]]| year= 1999| publisher=Idromeno | oclc=41096394}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dizdari finished his early education in the [[Turkish language]] school of his town, following later the ''Ruzdiye'' (mmiddle school) which he couldn't finish due to the outbreak of the [[First Balkan War]]. He registered later in the [[Saverian College of Shkodër]], finishing it in 1918.&lt;ref name="Elsie"/&gt; He focused on the Oriental languages and on mastering the [[French language]]. At a young age, he started working in the Albanian public administration, holding various positions in [[Vlorë]], [[Durrës]], and [[Pukë]]. One of his contributions during this time was the draft-statute ''Ligja e katundarive dhe e komunave'' (Law of villages and municipalities), being a main contributor of a work that targeted the formation, structuration, and operation of the local government, first of its kind within the newly created Albanian state of that time. In 1935, he published the manual ''Udhëhjekës për konferenca'' (Guide to conferences). He was also involved in huge projects, i.e. the general registration of the population in 1930.&lt;ref name="KMSH"/&gt;

As a monarchist and supporter of [[Zog I of Albania|King Zog I of Albania]], Dizdari participated in the armed resistance against the [[Italian invasion of Albania]] of April 1939. Due to his known pro-monarchy stance and his involvement in the skirmishes against the Italians at Gomsiqe near Pukë, he would be arrested and interned by the Italians.
&lt;br&gt;With the [[Albania under Germany|German occupation of Albania]], he resumed his research on orientalism and writing in the local Albanian press. During 1944, he wrote a separate column "Pyes vetveten" (I ask myself) in the ''Bashkimi i kombit'' (Nation's unity) newspaper, which would continue later in the ''[[Bashkimi (Democratic Front newspaper)|Bashkimi]]'' (Unity) during 1945-1946, using the pen-name "Hijekakeqi". During 1944, still in the newspaper ''Bashkimi i kombit'', he contributed to the [[linguistics]] section "Fjalë iranishte në gjuhën shqipe" (Iranian words in the Albanian language) using the pen-name "Bishtiqindija". He also published two [[toponymy]] studies: ''[[Skadarska Krajina|Kraja]]'' in the ''Bashkimi i kombit'' and ''Katër Balët'' (Four Balas) in the ''Bota e re'' (New world) magazine. He wrote also satirical articles, and religion-oriented articles in the ''Kultura islame'' (Islamic culture) and ''Bleta'' (Honeybee) magazines.&lt;ref name="Elsie"/&gt;
&lt;br&gt;In May 1945 he was affiliated with the ''Bashkimi'' newspaper of the [[Democratic Front of Albania|Democratic Front]], and in October 1945 acquired membership in the [[Albanian League of Writers and Artists]]. During 1946-1951, he focused on studying the Albanian dictionary and folklore, submitting a work of around 800 pages to the [[Institute of Folklore of Albania|Institute of Folklore]].&lt;ref name="KMSH"/&gt;

In February 1951, he got arrested and interrogated for several months due to an alleged connection with the so-called [[Massacre of 1951 in Albania|bombing of the Soviet embassy in Tirana]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8tijBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT34&amp;dq=tahir+dizdari&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9xY7by5HKAhWM5CYKHS_5BhAQ6AEIQjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=tahir%20dizdari&amp;f=false The Bomb and the Soviet Embassy in Tirana - Uran Butka]&lt;/ref&gt; but was set free since there was no incriminating evidence against him. Nevertheless, this affected his position within the Communist society, and his relations with the scholar environment. This also marked probably the most critical moment in his life, his family would be expelled from Tirana. In 1952, he opened a small bookstore which served him for lodging as well. Due to his knowledge of oriental languages, parts of the "oriental words dictionary" (which would be his most notable work later) were published in the ''Buletinin USHT (seria shkencave shoqërore)'' (Bulletin of the University of Tirana: social sciences series) of early [['60s]], and later the ''[[Studime filologjike]]'' (Philological studies) during 1964-1966. He also took part and gave speeches in three conferences on [[albanology]], held in Tirana in 1962, 1968, and 1969. The [[Institute of Linguistics of Albania|Institute of Linguistics]] ({{lang-sq|Instituti i Gjuhësisë}}), despite the previous political obstacles, decided to engage him as "senior scientific cooperator" ({{lang-sq|Bashkëpunëtor i vjetër shkencor}}), affiliated with its [[lexicology]] section, from 1965 till 9 May 1972, when Dizdari died.&lt;ref name="KMSH"/&gt;

His main work out of his active period 1941-1971 are the ''Orientalizmat në gjuhën shqipe'' (Orientalisms within the Albanian language), and ''Fjalë të pambledhura nga fjalorët e deritanishëm'' (Words not collected in the previous dictionaries), the last one being an important work on the Albanian language dictionary enrichment with "old" or obsolete words not collected until then.&lt;ref name="KMSH"/&gt; Both were handed over to the Institute of Linguistics and were published later.&lt;ref name="Elsie"&gt;{{citation| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pgf6GWJxuZgC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=tahir+dizdari&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjjg6GD0ZHKAhVCWCYKHUB7AgUQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tahir%20dizdari&amp;f=false| author=Robert Elsie|title=A Biographical Dictionary of Albanian History| page=116 | year=2012| publisher=I.B.Tauris| isbn=9781780764313}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;The ''Fjalor i orientalizmave në gjuhën shqipe'' (Dictionary of orientalisms within the Albanian language), a volumiunous work of around 1200 pages, was published in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JoVpAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=tahir+dizdari&amp;dq=tahir+dizdari&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9xY7by5HKAhWM5CYKHS_5BhAQ6AEISTAI| page=155| journal=[[Studia Albanica]]| publisher=[[Academy of Sciences of Albania]]| volume=39| year=2006| issn= 0585-5047|oclc= 1996482| title=Critique et bibliographie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Base on a proposal by the [[Academy of Sciences of Albania|Academy of Sciences]], the [[President of Albania]] [[Sali Berisha]] awarded him the order "Naim Frashëri" of 1-st Class in 1995, with the dedication "For valuable contribution in the development of Albanological studies".&lt;ref name="KMSH"&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.kmsh.al/al/2013/07/tahir-dizdari/| publisher=Muslim Community of Albania| language=Albanian| title=Tahir Dizdari| accessdate=2015-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''transparency report''' is a statement issued on a regular basis by a [[company]], disclosing a variety of [[statistics]] related to requests for user [[data]], records, or content. Transparency reports generally disclose how frequently and under what authority [[government]]s have requested or demanded data or records over a certain period of time. This form of [[corporate transparency]] allows the public to discern what private information governments have gained access to through [[search warrant]]s and court [[subpoena]]s, among other methods. Some transparency reports describe how often, as a result of government action or under [[copyright]] provisions, content was removed. Disclosing a transparency report also helps people to know about the appropriate scope and authority of content regulation for online discussions.&lt;ref name=Google&gt;{{cite web|title=transparency report introduction|url=https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Google]] first launched a transparency report in 2010, with Twitter following in 2012. Additional companies began releasing transparency reports as during the aftermath of the [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|global surveillance disclosures beginning in 2013]], and the number of companies issuing them has increased rapidly ever since. Transparency reports are issued today by a variety of technology and communications companies, including [[Google]], [[Microsoft]], [[Verizon]], [[AT&amp;T]], [[Twitter]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]], [[Facebook]], [[Yahoo]] and [[CloudFlare]]. Several companies and advocacy groups have lobbied the [[U.S. government]] to allow the number of secret data requests (requests which include a [[gag order]]s - including [[National Security Letter]]s) to be described within ranges in the report. 

==Government demand increases in years==

===Google===
[[Google Search|Google's]] latest ''(10th)'' transparency report indicates that the government demands for data are increasing in recent years.This report shows demands from government in the first six months of 2014, and the firm said that it includes demands made under the US Foreign Intelligence, Surveillance Act (FISA) and through National Security Letters (NSLs).
"FISA and NSL demands have increased by 15 percent during the six months, according to the firm, and by 150 percent over the 10 reports and the five year reporting period. That's globally. In the US the figures for the same period are 19 percent and 250 percent."
[[Google]] legal director ''Richard Salgado'' accepted that the government has to fight crime and deal with threats, but the opposition of data demands need to be considered as well.
''"This increase in government demands comes against a backdrop of ongoing revelations about government surveillance programs. Despite these revelations, we have seen some countries expand their surveillance authorities in an attempt to reach service providers outside their borders,"'' he said.
''"Governments have a legitimate and important role in fighting crime and investigating national security threats. To maintain public confidence in both government and technology, we need legislative reform that ensures surveillance powers are transparent, reasonably scoped by law, and subject to independent oversight."''
The report shows that the US makes the most demands for Google users' data, and Google said that it made 12,539 requests that affected some 22,000 accounts. It added that it provided data in 84 percent of cases.

In the UK it said there were 1,535 requests covering 1,991 users or accounts, and [[Google]] provided data for 72 percent of the requests.&lt;ref name=google&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dave|first1=Neal|title=Google’s 10th transparency report shows government requests are rising|url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2369323/google-s-10th-transparency-report-shows-government-requests-are-rising|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yahoo===
The latest Yahoo transparency report was released on 25 September 2014. The report states that 30,511 users were affected by 18,594 government data requests.,whereas 57,324 accounts were affected by 29,470 government requests.&lt;ref name=yahoo&gt;{{cite web|title=Yahoo Government data request|url=https://transparency.yahoo.com/government-data-requests/index.htm|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, both of these figures do not include those secret requests sent by the FISA court. During the last six month from ''July 1, 2013, to December 31, 2013'', it received between 0 and 1998 FISA requests for user data, affecting up to 54,997 users (including national security letters). Comparing to the first sixth month from ''January 1, 2013 to June 30, 2013'', 32,997 accounts was affected. As we can see from the figures, although the total number of data request drop, the number of data request approved from the FISA court have increased significantly.
Overall, 41 percent of accounts affected by government data requests came from requests made by the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yahoo Data requests drop, but FISA stats are worrying|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/09/25/yahoo-transparency-report-over-30k-government-data-requests-nearly-half-from-the-u-s/|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Transparency reports may be published for a variety of purposes. One purpose could be to clarify how much information governments ask for, how such requests are evaluated, and how the receiving entity chose to respond. This information may lead consumers to the conclusion that the report's publisher is more trustworthy.&lt;ref name=argument&gt;{{cite web|title=Transparency reports useful, but more info needed on 'digital searches'|url=http://www.scmagazine.com/transparency-reports-useful-but-more-info-needed-on-digital-searches/article/376751/|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is some debate about what transparency reports really reveal. Some critics argue that mere quantities of requests may mislead consumers, since most entities have little control over the number of requests they receive, the breadth of the requests they receive, or even the number of requests they ultimately comply with.&lt;ref name="transparency report"&gt;{{cite web|title=what transparency report don't tell us?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/what-transparency-reports-dont-tell-us/282529/#disqus_thread|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies such as [[Google]], [[Microsoft]], [[Yahoo]], [[Facebook]], and [[Twitter]] all release transparency reports, all of which list the type and number of government data requests each company receives. these reports include exact numbers and shed a bright light on government activity. The U.S. government will not, however, permit companies to report exact numbers for national security requests or the number of requests that came under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance (FISA) Section 702, Patriot Act Section 215, or national security letters.
Instead, they have to aggregate the numbers or provide a range. And that’s even if the government permits a company to publish that data. Google may publish national security letter information, but not FISA information. Facebook may publish FISA information, but it must lump such data in with NSL information. As a result, consumers cannot see the true figure for total government data requests.
Critics of this policy, such as the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], argue that there is no clear national security justification for blocking entities from releasing this information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why the transparency report is necessary in the fight for privacy|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/09/12/transparency-reports/|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflicts between government and company==

In June 2013, [[Google]] asked the Department of Justice for permission to disclose details about the number of FISA requests it receives. As a result, [[Microsoft]], [[Yahoo]], and [[Facebook]] followed suit immediately. However, the Department of Justice refused those requests, and they only provide the companies with a heavily redacted version of their arguments.
Here's what Google legal director Richard Salgado had to say about FISA requests:
''"We want to go even further. We believe it’s your right to know what kinds of requests and how many each government is making of us and other companies. However, the U.S. Department of Justice contends that U.S. law does not allow us to share information about some national security requests that we might receive. Specifically, the U.S. government argues that we cannot share information about the requests we receive (if any) under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. But you deserve to know."''&lt;ref name=conflicts&gt;{{cite news|title=Google slams U.S. government in latest transparency report|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2063386/google-slams-u-s-government-in-latest-transparency-report.html|accessdate=22 October 2014|agency=PC WORLD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''“Our ability to speak has been restricted by laws that prohibit and even criminalize a service provider like us from disclosing the exact number of national security letters ('NSLs') and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ('FISA') court orders received - even if that number is zero.”''avian network's veep for legal Ben Lee has blogged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twitter sues US government for right to disclose NOTHING|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/10/08/twitter_sues_us_government_for_right_to_disclose_nothing/|publisher=The register|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 October 2014, [[Twitter]] announce that there will be a lawsuit against the United States government for violating its First Amendment right to freedom of speech. The Transparency Report which would reveal how many national security letters (NSLs) and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) orders [[Twitter]] receives. They provided a draft of the transparency report to the Department of Justice and discussed it for months. [[Twitter]] was still unable to get the permission for allowing them to publish even a redacted version of the report from the government.
The response form FBI for its stance is that the information Twitter wants to publish "is classified and cannot be publicly released", they also said according to the framework provided on 27 January 2014, Twitter is only permitted to qualify its description of the total number of accounts affected by all national security legal process it has received but it cannot quantify that description with specific detail that goes well beyond what is allowed under the 27th Jan 2014 framework and that discloses properly classified information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FBI response|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/r/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/10/07/National-Security/Graphics/Exhibit%205%20-%2020140909%20FBI%20Letter%20to%20Twitter.pdf|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

===About the government===
The United States government announced on 30 August 2013 that a transparency report which is in its own form will be released. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper announced the change on his office's [[Tumblr]] blog. He said that the decision will come naturally after President Barack Obama ordered the declassification of as much intelligence information as possible. Total numbers for national security letters, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) business records requests, FISA one register/trap and trace requests will be stated in the transparency report. Beside that, the report will also include the number of targets being investigated in each of these requests. The number will reflect the 12 months prior to the date published.
The inspiration of the report comes from the recent surveillance program leaks from former NSA-contractor Edward Snowden, according to an anonymous source speaking with the ''Washington Post''.
[[Google]], [[Twitter]],and [[Facebook]] all release their own forms of transparency report, however they are not allowed to release this sort of information in their report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Meghan Kelly|title=U.S. to release transparency report with FISA and national security requests|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/08/30/us-transparency-report/|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
