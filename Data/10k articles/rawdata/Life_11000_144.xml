He is associated with the independent record label [[Visionary Music Group]].

== Work with Logic (late 2009 - Present) ==
6ix is best known for his work with [[Gaithersburg, Maryland]] rapper [[Logic (musician)|Logic]] (2010 – present) for whom he has produced over 43 songs, including eleven from [[Logic (musician)|Logic's]] latest mixtape [[YSIV]]. The first song [[Logic (musician)|Logic]] and 6ix produced together was Love Jones from Logic's first mixtape.

6ix is a native of [[Bowie, Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonian.com/2015/03/01/a-young-biracial-rapper-from-dc-is-the-next-big-thing/&lt;/ref&gt; His father is a doctor; his mother is an engineer; his older brother is an aerospace engineer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mishthimusic.com/post/137250184937/6ix-otherwise-known-as-arjun-ivatury-is-a Origins of Logic and Producer 6s Working Relationship&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://theunn.com/2017/12/arjun-ivatury-wins-grammy-nomination/&lt;/ref&gt; Before he became a full-time producer, 6ix attended the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], where he majored in neurology and physiology. In his senior year he dropped out of college in 2013 to move to Los Angeles with Logic to pursue a career in music production; he was 30 credits shy of his degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=C.M.|first1=Emmanuel|title=Behind the Boards: 6ix, Logic’s Producer|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2016/01/behind-the-boards-6ix-logics-producer/|accessdate=14 March 2017|publisher=XXL|date=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;He was nominated for Grammys for the first time for producing the song [[1-800-273-8255]] by Logic featuring [[Alessia Cara]] and [[Khalid (singer)|Khalid]].

'''Aenesidemus''' ({{lang-grc|Αἰνησίδημος}} or {{lang-grc|Αἰνεσίδημος}}) was a [[Greece|Greek]] [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonist]] philosopher, born in [[Knossos]] on the island of [[Crete]]. He lived in the 1st century BC, taught in [[Alexandria]] and flourished shortly after the life of [[Cicero]]. [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] says&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Long,D. N. Sedley, The Hellenistic Philosophers, 1987, p 469.&lt;/ref&gt; he was a member of [[Plato's Academy]], but he came to dispute their theories, adopting [[Pyrrhonism]] instead. [[Diogenes Laertius]] claims an unbroken lineage of teachers of Pyrrhonism through Aenesidemus, with his teacher being [[Heraclides of Tarentum|Heraclides]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.classicpersuasion.org/pw/diogenes/dltimon.htm&lt;/ref&gt; However, little is known about the names between [[Timon of Phlius]] and Aenesidemus, so this lineage is suspect. Whether Aenesidemus re-founded the Pyrrhonist school or merely revitalized it is unknown.

== Life ==
There is no definite evidence about the life of Aenesidemus, but his most important work, the ''Pyrrhoneia'' was known to be dedicated to Lucius Tubero, a friend of [[Cicero]] and member of [[Plato's Academy]] whom Photius described as a colleague. Based on this information, scholars have assumed that Aenesidemus himself was also a member of the Academy. Furthermore, it has been assumed that he took part under the leadership of [[Philo of Larissa]] and probably adopted Pyrrhonism either in reaction to [[Antiochus of Ascalon]] introduction of [[Stoicism|Stoic]] and [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] [[dogma]] into the [[Academy]] or  Philo's acceptance of provisional beliefs. What little we know of Aenesidemus is by way of [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] (in his ''[[Bibliotheca (Photius)|Myriobiblion]]''),  [[Sextus Empiricus]], and also to a lesser extent by [[Diogenes Laertius]] and [[Philo of Alexandria]].

== Pyrrhoneia ==
His chief work, known in Ancient Greek as ''Pyrrhôneoi logoi'' (Πυρρώνειοι λóγοι) and often rendered into English as the "Pyrrhonian Discourses" or "Pyrrhonian Principles", dealt primarily with man's need to suspend judgment due to our [[epistemology|epistemological]] limitations. It was divided into eight books, but it has not survived.  We have this summary of its contents from [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] (in his ''[[Bibliotheca (Photius)|Myriobiblion]]''). 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I read Aenesidemus' eight ''Pyrrhonist Discourses.'' The overall aim of the book is to establish that there is no firm basis for cognition, either through sense-perception, or indeed through thought. Consequently, he says, neither the Pyrrhonists nor the others know the truth in things; but the philosophers of other persuasions, as well as being ignorant in general, and wearing themselves out uselessly and expending themselves in ceaseless torments, are also ignorant of the very fact that they have cognition of none of the things of which they think that they have gained cognition. But he who philosophizes after the fashion of Pyrrho is happy not only in general but also, and especially, in the wisdom of knowing that he has firm cognition of nothing. And even with regard to what he knows, he has the propriety to assent no more to its affirmation than to its denial. The whole scheme of the book is directed towards the purpose I have mentioned. In writing the discourses Aenesidemus addresses them to Lucius Tubero, one of his colleagues from the Academy, a Roman by birth, with an illustrious ancestry and a distinguished political career. In the first discourse he differentiates between the Pyrrhonists and the Academics in almost precisely the following words. He says that the Academics are doctrinaire: they posit some things with confidence and unambiguously deny others. The Pyrrhonists, on the other hand, are aporetic and free of all doctrine. Not one of them has said either that all things are incognitive, or that they are cognitive, but that they are no more of this kind than of that, or that they are sometimes of this kind, sometimes not, or that for one person they are of this kind, for another person not of this kind, and for another person not even existent at all. Nor do they say that all things in general, or some things, are accessible to us, or not accessible to us, but that they are no more accessible to us than not, or that they are sometimes accessible to us, sometimes not, or that they are accessible to one person but not to another. Nor indeed, do they say there is true or false, convincing or unconvincing, existent or non-existent. But the same thing is, it might be said, no more true than false, convincing than unconvincing, or existent or non-existent; or sometimes the one, sometimes the other; or of such a kind for one person but not for another. For the Pyrrhonist determines absolutely nothing, not even this very claim that nothing is determined. (We put it this way, he says, for lack of a way to express the thought.) But the Academics, he says, especially those from the present-day Academy, are sometimes in agreement with Stoic beliefs, and to tell the truth turn out to be Stoics fighting with Stoics. Moreover, they are doctrinaire about many things. For they introduce virtue and folly, and posit good and bad, truth and falsity, convincing and unconvincing, existent and non-existent. They give firm determinations for many other things too. It is only about the cognitive impression that they express dissent.  Thus the followers of Pyrrho, in determining nothing, remain absolutely above reproach, whereas the Academics, he says, incur a scrutiny similar to that faced by the other philosophers. Above all, the Pyrrhonists, by entertaining doubts about every thesis, maintain consistency and do not conflict with themselves, whereas the Academics are unaware that they are conflicting with themselves. For to make unambiguous assertions and denials, at the same time as stating as a generalization that no things are cognitive, introduces an undeniable conflict: how is it possible to recognize that this is true, this false, yet still entertain perplexity and doubt, and not make a clear choice of the one and avoidance of the other?  For if it is not known that this is good or bad, or that this is true but that false, and this existent but that non-existent, it must certainly be admitted that each of them is incognitive. But if they receive self-evident cognition by means of sense-perception or thought, we must say that each is cognitive. These similar considerations are set out by Aenesidemus of Aegae at the beginning of his discourses, to indicate the difference between the Pyrrhonists and Academics. He goes on in the same discourse, the first, also to report in summary outline the entire way of life of the Pyrrhonists.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== The Ten Tropes of Aenesidemus ==
The reasons for ''epoché'' are given in what are often called the ten tropes or ten modes, which Sextus Empiricus attributed to Aenesidemus. These are as follows:

# Different animals manifest different modes of perception;
# Similar differences are seen among individual men;
# For the same man, information perceived with the senses is self-contradictory
# Furthermore, it varies from time to time with physical changes
# In addition, this data differs according to local relations
# Objects are known only indirectly through the medium of air, moisture, etc.
# These objects are in a condition of perpetual change in colour, temperature, size and motion
# All perceptions are relative and interact one upon another
# Our impressions become less critical through repetition and custom
# All men are brought up with different beliefs, under different laws and social conditions

In other words, Aenesidemus argues that experience varies infinitely under circumstances whose importance to one another cannot be accurately judged by human observers. He therefore rejects any concept of absolute knowledge of reality, since every each person has different perceptions, and they arrange their sense-gathered data in methods peculiar to themselves.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

== Heraclitean view ==
Either in the ''Pyrrhonian discourses'' or some other work that did not survive, Aenesidemus assimilated the theories of [[Heraclitus]], as is discussed in the ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'' of [[Sextus Empiricus]]. For admitting that contraries co-exist for the perceiving subject, he was able to assert the co-existence of contrary qualities in the same object. &lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

'''Bray's Cave''' is a [[solutional cave|limestone cave]] in the [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] of [[Gibraltar]]. Human remains and notable Neolithic and Bronze Age finds have been unearthed in the cave. Three almost complete skulls were recovered but the important find was that people had returned to the site to re-use it for funerals, other cranial fragments from other individuals were recovered, and it appeared that previous remains had been move aside for a more recent death.&lt;ref name="GrantFibiger2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grant|first1=Nicholas Marquez|last2=Fibiger|first2=Linda|title=The Routledge Handbook of Archaeological Human Remains and Legislation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lzi4N-74QmAC&amp;pg=PA703|accessdate=17 January 2013|date=21 March 2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-87956-2|page=703}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Bray's Cave is located at a height of {{convert|400|m}} above sea level on the western slopes of the [[Rock of Gibraltar]], within the [[Upper Rock Nature Reserve]]. It is important to note its location on the western slopes of the Rock where caves are far less common than on the eastern cliffs where [[sea cave]]s like [[Gorham's Cave]] or [[Vanguard Cave]] for example are located. Before archaeological excavations began, the cave was almost entirely infilled with carstic [[detritus]] and some [[foothills|foothill]] sediments as well as large boulders from past rockfalls, giving the cave the characteristics of a [[rock shelter]]. The arduous excavation process not only revealed its important [[archaeological sequence]] but also the true nature of this cave; the cave was formed along the [[stratigraphy|stratification]] joints of the [[limestone]] levels, in a north-south direction dipping to the west, with a varied range of [[speleothem]]s typical of closed cavities with a gallery [[geomorphology|morphology]].&lt;ref name=ERA&gt;{{cite web|title=Pastores merinies y enterramientos de la Edad del Bronce en Bray´s Cave (Gibraltar)|url=http://blog.eracultura.com/2013/09/pastores-merinies-y-enterramientos-de-la-edad-del-bronce-en-bray%C2%B4s-cave-gibraltar/|publisher=ERA Cultura|accessdate=22 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==

===Stratigraphy===
The cave's sequence features three phases of human occupation with clearly differentiated sedimentary levels, in addition to a further two levels which are archaeologically sterile:&lt;ref name=ERA/&gt;

====Level I====
Period of modern-contemporary use, ranging from the 18th to 20th centuries.&lt;ref name=ERA/&gt;

====Level II====
Period of medieval occupation. The level has been identified, through the ceramic and [[zooarchaeology|zooarchaeological]] record, as a 14th-century [[Marinid dynasty|Marinid]] occupation of a pastoral character, whereby the occupants made use of the cave as a 'refuge' leaving behind the remains of their ceramic belongings and [[hearth]]s.&lt;ref name=ERA/&gt;

====Level III====
Bronze Age occupation with funerary use. It develops around [[rimstone]] formations as well as the caves floor and walls, forming an organised and hierarchical burial area.&lt;ref name=ERA/&gt;

===Marinid shepherds===
Founded by the [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]] with the construction of [[Moorish Gibraltar|Madinat al-Fath]] ({{lang-en|City of Victory}}) in the 12th century, Gibraltar was one of the strongholds of the Marinid Protectorate in the [[Iberian Peninsula]]; this is reflected in the monumental [[Moorish Castle]] with its disproportionate [[Tower of Homage]] and the baths, which can be visited today within the [[Gibraltar Museum]], as well as in other contemporary remains found during the numerous digs carried out by the Gibraltar Museum.&lt;ref name=ERA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Giles Guzmán|first1=Francisco José|last2=Giles Pacheco|first2=Francisco|last3=Finlayson|first3=Clive|title=La Puerta de Granada de Gibraltar.

The remains at Bray's Cave are characteristic of sporadic pastoral occupations, which during the [[Middle Ages]] continued to develop in many caves. A ceramic record was discovered consisting of cooking pots and bowls, along with large amounts of goat bones, many of them young, and hearth remains.&lt;ref name=ERA/&gt;

===Bronze Age burials===
Given the lack of data available in southern Iberia in relation to the Bronze Age, the discoveries unearthed at Bray's Cave are of great importance. Previous findings, conducted by [[George Palao]] at [[Judge's Cave]], [[Pete's Paradise Cave]] and [[Devil's Fall Cave]], excavations carried out by non-specialists, suggested that some of the caves of Gibraltar had had a funerary use.&lt;ref name=ERA/&gt;

A large circular-shaped rimstone with an approximate diameter of {{convert|1.5|m}} is located towards the bottom of the cave; a significant accumulation of angular interlocked limestone clasts were documented here, constituting the closure of a burial of great archaeological interest where several secondary burials had been carried out adapting the rimstone as if it were a [[cist]] or [[niche (architecture)|niche]].&lt;ref name=ERA/&gt;

The burials are scattered throughout the cave, demonstrating burial areas and areas resulting from the removal of these to be reused.&lt;ref name=ERA/&gt;

Along with the [[paleontology|palaeontological]] remains, a ceramic record emerged consisting of common finds from this chrono-cultural period such as bowls with in-turned, straight or parabolic rims, large globular vessels and some pots. The goat and [[malacology|malacological]] remains that were documented are a reflection of the sources of nourishment of these communities.&lt;ref name=ERA/&gt;

The burials unearthed at Bray's Cave have added to the number of known burial sites of this period in southern Iberia, such as the ''[[:es:Necrópolis de los Algarbes|Necrópolis de los Algarbes]]'' in [[Tarifa]], ''La Loma del Puerco'' in [[Chiclana de la Frontera|Chiclana]], ''El Estanquillo'' in [[San Fernando, Cádiz|San Fernando]] and ''El Cerro del Berrueco'' in [[Medina-Sidonia]].&lt;ref name=ERA/&gt;

'''''Cabin in the Sky''''' is a [[Musical theater|musical]] with music by [[Vernon Duke]],  [[Musical theatre#Introduction and definitions|book]] by Lynn Root, and lyrics by [[John La Touche (lyricist)|John Latouche]]. The musical opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1940.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cabin in the Sky {{!}} IBDB: The official source for Broadway Information|url = http://www.ibdb.com/Production/View/1025|website = www.ibdb.com|accessdate = 2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show is described as a "parable of Southern Negro Life with echoes of [[Ferenc Molnár]]'s ''[[Liliom]]'' (which would be turned into the musical ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'') and [[Marc Connelly]]'s ''[[The Green Pastures]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Broadway Musicals: Show By Show|last = Green|first = Stanley|publisher = Applause Theatre &amp; Cinema Books|year = 2011|isbn = 978-1-55783-784-4|location = Milwaukee|pages = 111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Lynn Root wrote the libretto and brought it to [[George Balanchine]], "who was anxious to do it as his first assignment as director of an entire Broadway production."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book |title=The World of Musical Comedy |last=Green |first=Stanley |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=1980 |isbn=0-306-80207-4 |location=San Diego |pages=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balanchine took the script to [[Vernon Duke]] to compose the music. "On reading the script, my first impulse was to turn it down because as much as I admired the [[Black people|Negro]] race and its musical gifts, I didn't think myself sufficiently attuned to Negro folklore."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book |title=Passport to Paris |last=Duke |first=Vernon |publisher=Little, Brown, and Company |year=1955 |isbn= |location=Boston |pages=384–389}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Duke ended up taking up the project but insisted on "a lyricist with some direct contact with Southern Negroes."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Duke talked to [[Ira Gershwin]] and [[Yip Harburg|E.Y. Harburg]] but they both turned it down. (Gershwin was working on ''[[Lady in the Dark]]'' and Harburg thought the composer was "incapable of writing the kind of score the play required.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;)

Duke ended up picking [[John La Touche (lyricist)|John Latouche]] as his lyricist and the two began work in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/8604/umi-umd-5714.pdf |title=Beyond Racial Stereotypes: Subversive Subtexts in Cabin in the Sky |date=2008 |accessdate=2015-10-23 |website=Digital Repository of the University of Maryland |publisher=University of Maryland |last=Weber |first=Kate Marie}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two wanted to absorb aspects of the local Black culture but "decided to stay away from pedantic authenticity and write our own kind of 'colored' songs."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The rehearsals for the show were rather interesting between the Russian trio (Duke, Balanchine and [[Boris Aronson]] - the designer) and the all-black cast. In his book ''Passport to Paris'', Duke quotes George Ross' description from the ''Telegram:'' "Pit a threesome of turbulent Russians against a tempestuous cast of Negro players from Harlem and what have you got? Well, in this instance the result is a lingual ruckus approaching bedlam. At least half a dozen times at the rehearsal of ''Cabin in the Sky'', [[Ethel Waters]], [[Todd Duncan]], [[Rex Ingram (actor)|Rex Ingram]], [[J. Rosamond Johnson]], [[Katherine Dunham]] and her dancers have paused in puzzlement while the argumentative trio of [[Moscow|Muscovites]] disputed a difference of opinion in their native tongue. The Russian vowels and consonants fly as thick as borsht. After ten minutes of such alien harangue and retort, Miss Waters asks what it is all about. ‘George,’ Duke generally interprets, ‘just said the answer is yes!' and then rehearsals are resumed under the flag of truce until the next vocal flare-up."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Three days before the opening, Duke decided to replace the song "We'll Live All Over Again" after Waters expressed dissatisfaction with it. It was replaced with the showstopper "Taking a Chance on Love."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The song was originally "Foolin' Around with Love" which he wrote with [[Ted Fetter]]. Latouche retitled it and wrote the reprises.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[J. Rosamond Johnson]], besides taking a small role, trained the singing chorus. [[Katherine Dunham]] led her dancers through their slithering paces, assisted in the choreography by George Balanchine.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book |title=American Musical Theatre: A Chronicle |last=Bordman |first=Gerald |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1992 |isbn=0-19-507242-1 |location=New York |pages=521–522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Productions==
The musical premiered on Broadway at the [[Martin Beck Theatre]] on October 25, 1940 and closed on March 8, 1941 after 156 performances. The musical is based on the story  ''Little Joe'' by Lynn Root.

Musicals Tonight! presented a staged concert of the musical at the 14th Street YMHA, New York City in October 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simonson, Robert]] and Jones, Kenneth.

==Critical reception==
The musical was very well received. [[Gerald Bordman]] wrote "Wisely, everyone involved in the show rejected the easy excesses and crassness so many musicals resorted to. Certainly they avoided turning the evening into a black minstrel show. Throughout the production a tasteful restraint, a sense of what as appropriate to the story, was maintained. This rare display of integrity made ''Cabin in the Sky'' an attractive enough evening to keep ticket buyers coming for 20 weeks."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Thomas S. Hischak wrote, "With enthusiastic reviews, an outstanding score, and a powerhouse cast of some of the finest African Americans in the business, it was surprising the musical did not run longer than twenty weeks."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Broadway Plays and Musicals|last = Hischak|first = Thomas|publisher = McFarland &amp; Company, Inc|year = 2009|isbn = 978-0-7864-9754-6|location = Jefferson, North Carolina|pages = 64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not everyone liked the show. Critic Richard Watts, Jr. wrote in his review that the show was "merely a white man's self-conscious attempt to write a pseudo-folk fable of another race."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Pittsburgh Press - Google News Archive Search|url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19401103&amp;id=844cAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=i44EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3560,4051209&amp;hl=en|website = news.google.com|accessdate = 2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cabin in the Sky'' proved to be the last major success of Duke's career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Broadway: Its History, People, and Places|last = Bloom|first = Ken|publisher = Routledge|year = 2004|isbn = 0-4159-3704-3|location = New York|pages = 137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show was made into the 1943 film ''[[Cabin in the Sky (film)|Cabin in the Sky]]'', but as Denny Flinn stated in his book, "It is noble that Hollywood made a black musical at all, but there are too many interpolations to the John Latouche-Vernon Duke score."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Musical! A Grand Tour|last = Flinn|first = Denny|publisher = Schirmer Books|year = 1997|isbn = 0-02-864610-X|location = New York|pages = 504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2987">The '''CrustaStun''' is a device designed to administer a lethal electric shock to [[shellfish]] (such as [[lobsters]], [[crabs]], and [[crayfish]]) before cooking.  This avoids boiling a live shellfish which may be able to experience pain in a way similar to vertebrates.  The CrustaStun comprises a stainless-steel box approximately the size of a domestic [[microwave oven]] containing a tray with a wet sponge and an electrode&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.maxindustrialmicrowave.com|title=How to use Domestic Microwave Oven for CrustaStun|publisher=About.com|accessdate=July 22, 2013|date=December 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The shellfish is placed in the box and when the lid is closed, the wet sponge conducts the current which electrocutes the animal with a 110 [[volt]], 2–5 [[Ampere|amp]] charge. It is reported the CrustaStun renders the shellfish unconscious in 0.3 seconds and kills the animal in 5 to 10 seconds, compared to 3 minutes to kill a lobster by boiling or 4.5 minutes for a crab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/news/ill-have-my-lobster-electrocuted-please-1824925.html|title=I'll have my lobster electrocuted, please|author=McSmith, A.|publisher=The Independent (Newspaper)|accessdate=June 14, 2013|location=London|date=November 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1324142/CrustaStun-The-humane-gadget-kills-lobsters-single-jolt-electricity.html|title=CrustaStun: The 'humane' gadget that kills lobsters with a single jolt of electricity|author=Anon.|publisher=MailOnline (Newspaper)|accessdate=June 14, 2013|location=London|date=October 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inventor of the device, Simon Buckhaven, worked for two years with scientists from the [[University of Bristol]] to develop the device which is manufactured by a company in [[England]], at an estimated cost of £2,500 (in 2009).

There are claims that shellfish killed with the CrustaStun taste better than those killed by boiling. [[Waitrose]], [[Tesco]] and other major supermarkets in the United Kingdom have insisted that all shellfish products supplied to them are killed using this method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.selectiveseafoods.com/crustastun.htm|title=Selective Seafoods; Freshly Prepared Crabs,Lobsters and other Locally Produced Seafoods.|author1=Griffiths, G.|author2=White, M.|accessdate=June 14, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620115030/http://www.selectiveseafoods.com/crustastun.htm|archivedate=June 20, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a DJ career that spanned over 40 years, he was known for playing a blend of 60s [[rocksteady]], [[reggae]], [[ska]], [[dancehall]] and [[soul music|soul]]. He was reported missing in July 2015 and his remains were found on 10 March 2016.

==Early life==
He was born in Bristol, the second son of a carpenter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lynskey|first1=Dorian|title=The life and death of DJ Derek, an unlikely reggae legend|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/23/dj-derek-life-death-unlikely-reggae-legend-bristol|accessdate=24 March 2016|work=The Guardian|date=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and raised close to St Andrew's Park, off [[Gloucester Road, Bristol|Gloucester Road]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5002">'''Damian''' (died 924), known in Arabic as '''Damyanah''' and surnamed '''Ghulam Yazman''' ("[[ghilman|slave/page]] of Yazman"), was a [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantine Greek]] convert to [[Islam]], governor of [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] in 896–897 and one of the main leaders of naval raids against the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the early 10th century.

== Biography ==
Damian was a [[Religious conversion|convert]] servant of the [[eunuch]] governor of Tarsus [[Yazman al-Khadim]] (died 891), who had recognized the overlordship of the [[Tulunids]] of [[Egypt]] under [[Ahmad ibn Tulun|Ibn Tulun]]'s son [[Khumarawaih]]. In October 896, Damian was named governor of Tarsus by the then-governor Ahmad ibn Tughan. Yusuf al-Baghmardi was his deputy and commander of the military forces of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rosenthal|1985|p=34}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Damian and al-Baghmardi, however, were ousted from Tarsus in March/April 897 by a revolt of the pro-[[Abbasid]] faction of the city under Raghib, a former ''[[mawla]]'' of [[al-Muwaffaq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rosenthal|1985|p=41}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 900, [[al-Tabari]] reports that Damian urged the Caliph [[al-Mu'tadid]] to burn the fleet of Tarsus, of over 50 large ships, as a revenge for his ouster three years before, a fact which greatly debilitated Muslim naval power.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rosenthal|1985|p=91}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it was as an admiral that Damian most distinguished himself. In 896 or more likely in 901, he sacked and plundered the port of [[Demetrias]] in [[Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Setton|1954|p=318}}; {{Harvnb|Treadgold|1997|p=466}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Damian then participated in [[Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Katib]]'s campaign in winter 904–905 that wrested Egypt from the Tulunids and restored it to Abbasid control; he led a fleet up the river [[Nile]], raided its coasts, and prevented supplies for the Tulunid forces from being ferried over it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rosenthal|1985|p=151}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 911, he attacked [[Cyprus]], which since the 7th century had been a neutralized Arab-Byzantine [[condominium]], and ravaged it for four months because its inhabitants had assisted a Byzantine fleet under admiral [[Himerios (admiral)|Himerios]] in attacking the Caliphate's coasts the year before.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Setton|1954|p=318}}; {{harvnb|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|p=63}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in October 912, along with the fellow-renegade [[Leo of Tripoli]], he scored a decisive victory over Himerios off the island of [[Chios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|p=63}}; {{harvnb|Treadgold|1997|p=470}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of the same year, he is mentioned as accompanying the governor of the [[Cilicia]]n ''[[thughur]]'', [[Rustam ibn Baradu]], in an attack against the Byzantine frontier province of [[Lykandos]] and its [[Armenians|Armenian]] governor [[Melias]]. Melias was besieged in his fortress, but the Arabs failed to take it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rosenthal|1985|p=196}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Damian died in 924 while leading an attack against the Byzantine fortress of [[Strobilos]] in the [[Cibyrrhaeot Theme]]. His death, along with the probable death of Leo of Tripoli the year before, brought the era of Muslim naval superiority and of constant raids against the Byzantine coasts to an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|p=64}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his term of enlistment ended, Walker returned to Canada and worked as a private investigator and eventually began travelling to S.E. Asia on assignments. In the late 1980s he famously located a missing refugee girl from Cambodia whom he re-united with her refugee family in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eowibN3NnUc CTV NEWS ''W-5'' (circa)1986&lt;/ref&gt; While in Canada Walker worked with CSIS ([[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]]) identifying [[Khmer Rouge]] genocide perpetrators who had infiltrated into Canada among Cambodian refugees in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Doucette, "Canadian found dead in Cambodia provided help to intelligence agents, ''Toronto Sun'',  May 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/body-of-missing-canadian-filmmaker-dave-walker-found-in-cambodia-1.1800830  CTV News Channel, "Body of missing Canadian filmmaker Dave Walker found in Cambodia, May 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Walker trained [[Karen National Liberation Army]] insurgents on the Thailand-Myanmar border, where he met his wife in a remote northern Thai village. He brought her to Canada and after five years they divorced amicably. {{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

During the 1990s-2000s Walker worked as a freelance photo-journalist, screenwriter and movie production fixer on films like ''[[The Beach (film)]]'' and with ABC News' [[Diane Sawyer]] on her coverage of the Tsunami in 2004. He worked with Canadian filmmakers [[Peter Lynch (director)|Peter Lynch]] and [[Peter Vronsky]] in [[Toronto]] and [[Cambodia]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} In 1998, Walker published a book of love letters he co-edited from Bangkok bar girls to their foreign boyfriends, ''Hello My Big, Big Honey!''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2295540.Hello_My_Big_Big_Honey_&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=February 2018}}

In the early 1990s, Walker was co-producing an independent feature film he had written, ''The Man From Year Zero'' with actor [[Haing S. Ngor]] from the movie ''[[The Killing Fields (film)]]''. Walker's screenplay described how Cambodian refugees in Canada encounter a former Khmer Rouge executioner hiding among them and was going to feature Ngor in the role of the fugitive perpetrator. But after Ngor was murdered by Cambodian gang members in Los Angeles in 1996, the project collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20140307064225/http://www.animistfarmfilms.com:80/stories Howls From the Gang Module&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Walker earned an M.A. at York University in Toronto in the field of Augmented Reality before returning to Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;http://interdis.gradstudies.yorku.ca/alumni-spotlight/ York University Graduate Program in Interdisciplinary Studies Alumni Spotlight&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of his M.A. thesis, Walker made a short film ''The Augmented Cambodian''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otZfUdpL3tw "The Augmented Cambodian on YouTube.&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker continued to explore themes in Cambodia's history and in 2012 he returned to Cambodia to begin researching a documentary ''The Poorest Man'', the story of an "[[Oskar Schindler]]"-like former Khmer Rouge village chief who risked his life to save victims in his village from the [[Pol Pot]] regime's genocidal killings. As many of the Khmer Rouge perpetrators had returned to Cambodia in the 1990s, and re-entered government service, police, military and business, and were now claiming that they "had no choice" in perpetrating their crimes under Pol Pot, Walker's proposed film about the one Khmer Rouge functionary who demonstrated they did had a choice and survived Pol Pot just the same, was met with hostility from some sectors in Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20140302102400/http://www.animistfarmfilms.com:80/projects The Poorest Man&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance and death==
On February 14, 2014, Walker disappeared after he left his guest house in Cambodia. Hotel staff stated room service cleaning staff went to Walker's room around 2pm and he said he would leave the room so the room could be cleaned. He left with a bottle of water in hand and never returned.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifj.org/nc/news-single-view/category/blog/article/canadian-journalist-still-missing-in-cambodia/ International Federation of Journalists "Canadian Journalist Still Missing in Cambodia" 6 Mar 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Cambodian Police and Canada's foreign affairs department [[Global Affairs Canada]] bungled and obstructed the investigation of Walker's mysterious disappearance,{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} while several different private investigations began to duel with each other in bitter rivalry.&lt;ref name=globe/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phnompenhpost.com/siem-reap-insider/man-about-town-28-march-2014 Peter Olszewski, "Delving into Dave Walker's Disappearance", Phnom Pehn Post, 28 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 1, Walker's body was found at Cambodia's [[Angkor]] Temple Complex, near the "Gates of Death" at Angkor Thom, approximately 13 kilometers from where he disappeared.  Two autopsy reports, (one commissioned by Walker's family) could not determine a cause of death but indicated that Walker died many weeks before his body was discovered, probably on the day of his disappearance.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Walker's body was recovered by his ex-wife's family, cremated and his ashes enshrined in the northern Thai village where he had met his wife, as per his wishes.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

His disappearance and death remain unsolved.

The '''Santiago Maldonado case''' refers to the death of an Argentine demonstrator, who took part in a road block and was missing after the Argentine gendarmerie dispersed the demonstration. Maldonado's body was found months later in a nearby river with no signs of violence. The events took place in [[Cushamen Department|Cushamen]], located in the [[argentina|Argentine]] province of [[Chubut Province|Chubut]]. The autopsy of the body indicated that Santiago's cause of death was "drowning by immersion in the water of the [[Chubut River]], contributed by hypothermia" and that it was a "traumatic death" and there were no signs of violence. The [[autopsy]] also showed that the body had stayed underwater for at least 55 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.clarin.com/politica/caso-santiago-maldonado-penas-falso-testimonio-varios-testigos-quedan-expuestos_0_HJ4qRbK6b.html|title=Caso Santiago Maldonado: las penas por falso testimonio a las que varios testigos quedan expuestos|access-date=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law-enforcement action was carried out by the [[Argentine National Gendarmerie]], a security force that operates under the direct command of the National Security Minister, [[Patricia Bullrich]], under the control of President [[Mauricio Macri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pagina12.com.ar/54576-cuarto-dia-sin-maldonado|title=Cuarto día sin Maldonado {{!}} Silencio del Gobierno por la desaparición|date=2017-08-05|work=PAGINA12|access-date=2017-09-17|language=es-AR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pagina12.com.ar/54964-macri-ya-tiene-su-desaparecido|title=Macri ya tiene su desaparecido {{!}} El gobierno nacional pasa del negacionismo a la represión|last=Verbitsky|first=Horacio|date=2017-08-07|work=PAGINA12|access-date=2017-09-17|language=es-AR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://encuentrojudicial.com.ar/?p=10434|title=Encuentro Judicial {{!}}|website=encuentrojudicial.com.ar|language=es-ES|access-date=2017-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/2056617-entrevista-a-los-padres-de-santiago-maldonado-donde-esta-que-le-hicieron-lo-estamos-esperando|title=Entrevista a los padres de Santiago Maldonado: "¿Dónde está? ¿Qué le hicieron?

On October 20, 2017, Santiago's family confirmed that the body found floating in [[Chubut River]] was indeed his.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/2073249-caso-santiago-maldonado-cuerpo-identificacion|title=Segio Maldonado: "Estamos convencidos de que es Santiago"|access-date=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 21, a twelve-hour autopsy revealed no lesions in his body, leading experts to conclude that he had drowned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/2074332-confirman-que-el-cadaver-era-de-maldonado-y-evaluan-como-murio|title=El cadáver es de Maldonado y no tiene lesiones, reveló la autopsia|access-date=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 24, 2017 the verdict of a commission of 55 forensic experts confirmed that Santiago Maldonado died by asphyxia and hypotermia; different studies showed that the corpse at the time of the autopsy was between 55 days and 72 days old. The experts also confirmed that there were no blows or injuries. Nevertheless, the defense insists that the case is a forced disapearance.&lt;ref name="nueva"/&gt; The case was closed on November 29, 2018, when judge Gustavo Lleral ruled that there was no forced disapearance.&lt;ref name=cierran&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.lanacion.com.ar/2197521-el-juez-lleral-cerro-causa-donde-se|title= Cierran la causa por la muerte de Santiago Maldonado|trans-title= They close the Santiago Maldonado case|language= Spanish|author= Candela Ini|date= November 29, 2018|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The event==
Santiago Andrés Maldonado (born 25 July 1989) was a craftsman and [[tattoo]] artist from the town of [[Veinticinco de Mayo, Buenos Aires|Veinticinco de Mayo]], [[province of Buenos Aires]]. A few months before his disappearance he had moved to [[El Bolsón, Río Negro|El Bolsón]], province of [[Río Negro Province|Río Negro]], about 70 kilometers north of a Mapuche settlement named Cushamen. Maldonado supported the aboriginal communities in their land claims, but, according to his family, he had never before been politically active because "he does not believe in politics".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-40868877|title=Quién es Santiago Maldonado, el joven cuya desaparición tiene en vilo a Argentina|last=Smink|first=Veronica|date=2017-08-08|work=BBC Mundo|access-date=2017-09-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event took place on July 31 and August 1, 2017, at the [[Chubut Province]]. The location was the Pu Lof de la Resistencia of Cushamen, a [[mapuche]] establishment built in territories seized from the Italian clothing company [[Benetton Group]] by Facundo Jones Huala. Huala, member of the [[Resistencia Ancestral Mapuche]] group,&lt;ref name="pidio"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.lanacion.com.ar/2050635-cristina-kirchner-pidio-la-aparicion-con-vida-de-santiago-maldonado-y-responsabilizo-a-gendarmeria|title= Cristina Kirchner pidió la aparición con vida de Santiago Maldonado y responsabilizó a Gendarmería|trans-title= Cristina Kirchner asked for Santiago Maldonado to be returned alive and blamed the gendarmerie|language= Spanish|author= |date= August 6, 2018|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=October 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was jailed because of the violent protest activities including destruction of properties that undertook in several locations, and members of the Pu Lof organized a [[picketing]] protest at the [[National Route 40 (Argentina)|National Route 40]], advocating for his liberation.&lt;ref name="ruta40"/&gt; The people in the demonstration were hooded, and had completely blocked the road with trees, stones and fire, thus not allowing any transit through the road. The protest was carried out by eight people, Santiago Maldonado among them. Judge [[Guido Otranto]] instructed the [[Argentine National Gendarmerie]] to clear the blockade and disperse the protesters, who escaped. The judge had also instructed them to use minimal violence, and film the operation on video.&lt;ref name="ruta40"/&gt;

The protesters tried to block the road again some hours later, on August 1. The protesters reacted violently to the Gendarmerie this time, and attacked them with stones. Commander Juan Pablo Escola reported that two gendarmes were gravely injured in their faces during the attack. He sent a group of 30 gendarmes to the Pu Lof. Although he did not have a judicial warrant to do so, he considered that the attack could be considered as ''[[in flagrante delicto]]'', which would have allowed to skip that requirement.&lt;ref name="ruta40"/&gt;

Some protesters attempted to escape by swimming across the [[Chubut River]], and others tried to hide in a forest next to the river. Maldonado could not cross the river because he could not swim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/2062397-caso-maldonado-dos-gendarmes-avalaron-la-hipotesis-de-que-en-el-rio-hubo-un-manifestante-herido|title= Caso Maldonado: dos gendarmes avalaron la hipótesis de que en el río hubo un manifestante herido|trans-title=|language= Spanish|author= Loreley Gaffoglio|date= September 13, 2017|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=September 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whereabouts of Santiago Maldonado were unknown after that point.&lt;ref name="ruta40"/&gt;

==Judicial case==
A judicial case, led by a judge and three prosecutors, tries to determine the whereabouts of Maldonado. The national government&lt;ref name="querellante"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/caso-maldonado-gobierno-analiza-presentarse-querellante_0_ByFTly7FW.html|title= Caso Maldonado: el Gobierno analiza presentarse como querellante|trans-title=Maldonado case: the government considers to ask to be a complainant|language= Spanish|author= |date= August 29, 2017|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the provincial government of Chubut&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/caso-maldonado-gobierno-chubut-quiere-querellante_0_rkpL_bXK-.html|title= Caso Maldonado: también el Gobierno de Chubut quiere ser querellante|trans-title=Maldonado case: the government of Chubut wants to be complainant as well|language= Spanish|author= |date= August 29, 2017|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; asked to be complainants in the case. The [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] suggested that, in case of doubt about a case being a forced disappearance or not, it should be investigated as if it was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/08/24/world/americas/ap-lt-argentina-missing-activist.html|title= Rights Commission Urges Argentina to Find Missing Activist|author= |date= August 24, 2017|publisher= The New York Times|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with this suggestion, the Gendarmerie was removed from taking an active role in the investigation.&lt;ref name="querellante"/&gt; The [[International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance|United Nations Committee on Enforced Disappearances]] has requested to oversee the investigation, which was accepted by Argentina. As a result, both the judiciary and the Argentine government will have to keep the organization updated about every progress of the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.infobae.com/politica/2017/08/30/marcos-pena-lanza-la-campana-electoral-de-cambiemos-con-un-duro-mensaje-en-el-congreso/|title= Marcos Peña lanzará la campaña electoral de Cambiemos con un duro mensaje en el Congreso|trans-title=Marcos Peña launches the electoral campaign of Cambiemos with a harsh speech in the Congress|language= Spanish|author= Martín Dinatale|date= August 30, 2017|publisher= Infobae|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was initially investigated as a [[search and rescue]], and was later rebranded as a [[forced disappearance]]. However, the change was made without any new evidence that may suggest an involvement of the Gendarmeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/fiscal-pide-caso-maldonado-investigado-desaparicion-forzada-personas_0_ByLaFq2O-.html|title= Cambia la carátula del caso Maldonado a "desaparición forzada de personas"|trans-title=The Maldonado case is changed to "forced disappearance of people"|language= Spanish|author= Claudio Andrade|date= August 24, 2017|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of twenty mapuches [[Occupation (protest)|occupied]] the court on September 20, asking for the removal of judge Otranto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.clarin.com/politica/enojados-otranto-mapuches-toman-pacificamente-juzgado-esquel_0_S1jqY0JsZ.html|title= Sube la tensión en Esquel: mapuches toman el juzgado y piden que se vaya Otranto|trans-title=Tension is rising at Esquel: the court is occupied, amid requests for the removal of Otranto|language= Spanish|author= Guido Carelli Lynch|date= September 20, 2017|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maldonado family and the CELS accused the judge Otranto of not being an [[impartial jury]]. The federal chamber of appeals of [[Comodoro Rivadavia]] recused him from the case, but clarified in the sentence that they found no reason to doubt his intellectual honesty and respect to the procedures. He was recused instead because of an interview with the newspaper ''[[La Nación]]'', where he made an extrajudicial commentary about the accuracy of the theories, before formally closing the case. Otranto was then replaced by judge [[Gustavo Llerald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Desplazan al juez Otranto de la causa que investiga la desaparición de Santiago Maldonado|trans-title=They recuse judge Otranto from the case that investigates the disappearance of Santiago Maldonado|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/2065517-desplazan-al-juez-otranto-de-la-causa-que-investiga-la-desaparicion-de-santiago-maldonado|language= Spanish|date=September 22, 2017|author=Ana Tronfi|publisher=La Nación|access-date=September 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Maldonado family celebrated the removal of Otranto, but complained that their specific request had been rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/2065552-caso-maldonado-la-familia-celebro-que-apartaran-a-otranto-pero-se-quejo-de-los-fundamentos-de-la-camara|title= Caso Maldonado: la familia celebró que apartaran a Otranto, pero se quejó de los fundamentos de la Cámara|trans-title=Maldonado case: the family celebrated the removal of Otranto, but complained about the reasons of the chamber|language= Spanish|author= |date= September 22, 2017|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otranto is still in charge of the case over the road block that started the case.&lt;ref name="ruta40"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.clarin.com/politica/otranto-sigue-frente-causa-desalojo_0_rksganrjZ.html|title= A pesar de la recusación, Otranto sigue al frente de la causa por el desalojo de la ruta 40|trans-title=Despite the recusal, Otranto is still in charge of the case over the liberation of the Route 40|language= Spanish|author= Claudio Andrade|date= September 24, 2017|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 October 2017, after a 12-hour autopsy involving 52 experts, including those appointed by Maldonado's family, Judge Gustavo Lleral confirmed that Maldonado's body did not have any signs of violence and the cause of death was established as death by drowning. On November 24, 2017 the verdict of the 55 experts confirmed that Maldonado drowned and that there were no signs of violence on his body. How, when and why he died is still on investigation.&lt;ref name="lanacion.com.ar"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lanacion.com.ar/2085380-caso-maldonado-termino-la-junta-medica-conformada-para-establecer-como-y-por-que-murio-el-artesano|title=Caso Maldonado: los peritos coinciden en que murió por "asfixia por sumersión" y que el cuerpo no estuvo en tierra|access-date=2018-06-20|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.clarin.com/politica/caso-maldonado-lesiones-cuerpo-dijo-juez-autopsia_0_SkNyi4daW.html|title=Caso Maldonado: "No hubo lesiones en el cuerpo", dijo el juez tras la autopsia|date=21 October 2017|publisher=[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]|accessdate=2017-10-22|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosecutor Silvina Avila asked in December 2017 to change the folder of the case from [[forced disappearance]] to [[suspicious death]], on the grounds that the investigation did not reveal any clue that may support the forced disappearance hypothesis. There was a similar request from the Ministry of Security in May 2018. The judge Lleral rejected both requests. He pointed that the folder of the case is inconsequential, that changing it before the case was closed would be an improper advance of opinion, and that the case is not guided by the folder's name but by the results of the investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.clarin.com/politica/caso-maldonado-juez-mantuvo-caratula-causa-desaparicion-forzada_0_HJ1-dpnTf.html|title= Caso Maldonado: el juez mantuvo la carátula de la causa como "desaparición forzada"|trans-title= Maldonado case: the judge kept the folder of the case as "forced dissapearace"|language= Spanish|author= Claudio Andrade|date= May 6, 2018|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=September 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no specific members of the gendarmerie formally accused of wrongdoing or called for inquiry, which turns it into a moot point.&lt;ref name="nueva"/&gt;

==International cases==
On August 7, 2017, the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances expressed its "concern about the physical and psychological integrity" of Maldonado and requested the Argentine state to adopt "a comprehensive search strategy", taking "all the urgent measures that are necessary to search for him and find him, taking into account the information provided by the members of the Pu Lof Mapuche community that were present at the moment of the repression".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cels.org.ar/web/en/2017/08/el-comite-contra-la-desaparicion-forzada-de-la-onu-exige-la-accion-urgente/ |title=Santiago Maldonado's Disappearance in Argentina: The UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances demands urgent state action |date= August 7, 2017 |publisher= CELS - Centro de Estudios Legales y Sociales |accessdate=September 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elpaisdigital.com.ar/contenido/la-onu-pide-acciones-urgentes-para-encontrar-a-maldonado/10122|title=La ONU pide al Estado argentino acciones urgentes para encontrar a Santiago Maldonado|last=Digital|first=El País|website=El País Digital|language=es|access-date=2017-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN committee also requested that the Gendarmerie does not participate in the search and investigation of the disappearance and that the Argentine government protects all the evidence that may help to identify those responsible for the disappearance. The same day, the Minister of Security offered a reward to those who "while not having participated in the crime, offer useful information that can help find the whereabouts" of Maldonado.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.minseg.gob.ar/el-ministerio-de-seguridad-de-la-nación-informa-santiago-maldonado|title=El Ministerio de Seguridad de la Nación informa: Santiago Maldonado|date=2017-08-07|website=minseg.gob.ar|access-date=2017-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 23, the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] (IACHR), of the [[Organization of American States]], also took a precautionary measure asking the Argentine state to "adopt all the necessary measures to determine the situation and whereabouts of Mr. Santiago Maldonado" and to "inform about all the measures that have been adopted to investigate the facts".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pagina12.com.ar/58474-el-derecho-a-la-vida-se-encuentra-en-grave-riesgo|title="El derecho a la vida se encuentra en grave riesgo" {{!}} Como había adelantado PáginaI12, la CIDH le exigió al Gobierno que determine "la situación y el paradero" de Santiago Maldonado|last=Meyer|first=Adriana|date=2017-08-24|work=PAGINA12|access-date=2017-09-17|language=es-AR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 6, the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances published a document addressed to the Argentine national government in which the former expresses its concern about the lack of progress in the clarification of what happened to Santiago Maldonado. The UN demanded the Macri administration to set as a priority the clarification of the role of the Gendarmerie and to keep this force away from the investigation. It also accused the authorities of quickly rejecting the hypothesis according to which the Gendarmerie is the perpetrator of the enforced disappearance of Maldonado. The Committee expressed its concern regarding the lack of partiality of judge Guido Otranto. It finally pointed out that there are officials of the Macri administration that continue to stigmatize the members of the Pu Lof by portraying them as a threat to national security, when the government should be instead offering protection to the Mapuche community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.infobae.com/sociedad/policiales/2017/10/06/la-onu-dura-contra-el-gobierno-por-el-caso-maldonado-pidio-esclarecer-en-forma-prioritaria-la-participacion-de-gendarmeria/|title=La ONU, dura contra el Gobierno por el caso Maldonado: pidió esclarecer en "forma prioritaria" la participación de Gendarmería|work=Infobae|access-date=2017-10-12|language=es-LA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drowned==
Maldonado escaped from the Gendarmerie by trying to cross the [[Chubut River]]. A new search revealed a corpse in the river on October 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.clarin.com/politica/caso-maldonado-encontraron-cuerpo-rio-chubut_0_rkg9SdAX6W.html|title= Caso Santiago Maldonado: encontraron un cuerpo en el Río Chubut|trans-title=Maldonado case: they found a corpse at the Chubut river|language= Spanish|author= |date= October 17, 2017|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=October 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were no reports of other deaths or missing people in the area, and it was confirmed that it was a male, with light blue clothes as those that witnesses reported that Maldonado was wearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.clarin.com/politica/caso-santiago-maldonado-fiscal-avila-confirmo-cuerpo-masculino-lleva-ropa-celeste-dijeron-testigos_0_BJ52C-NTb.html|title= Caso Santiago Maldonado: la fiscal Ávila confirmó que "es un cuerpo masculino y lleva ropa celeste como la que dijeron los testigos"|trans-title=Maldonado case: prosecutor Ávila confirmed that "it is a male body and has light blue clothes, as reported by witnesses"|language= Spanish|author= Guido Braslavsky|date= October 17, 2017|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=October 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corpse was found 300 meters upstream from the area of the events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.clarin.com/politica/caso-maldonado-fiscalia-cuerpo-encontrado-300-metros-rio-arriba_0_BkpjOzVa-.html|title= Caso Maldonado: según la fiscalía, el cuerpo fue encontrado "300 metros río arriba"|trans-title=Maldonado case: according to the prosecutor, the corpse was found "300 meter upstream"|language= Spanish|author= |date= October 17, 2017|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=October 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspaper [[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarin]] said that the hypothesis of the government was that the presence of many [[River ecosystem|aquatic plants]] and strong flows could make it difficult to find the corpse.&lt;ref name="dos"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.clarin.com/politica/hipotesis-gobierno-caso-maldonado-ahogo-protesta_0_HkV71bk2-.html|title= Dos hipótesis del Gobierno en el caso Maldonado: o se ahogó o no estuvo en la protesta|trans-title=Two hypothesis of the government in the Maldonado case: he either drowned or was't in the protest|language= Spanish|author= Claudio Andrade|date= October 1, 2017|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=September 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The autopsy conducted on 21 October 2017 confirmed forensic evidence clearly pointed to drowning and hypotermia as the cause of death&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.clarin.com/politica/ahogamiento-hipotermia-detalles-autopsia-santiago-maldonado_0_HyXCuMFab.html|title=Ahogamiento, hipotermia y todos los detalles de la autopsia de Santiago Maldonado|access-date=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The autopsy, witnessed by 52 experts including that of the Maldonado family and international organizations, revealed no evidence of injuries. The corpse was acknowledged to be Maldonado's by the 52 experts witnessing the autopsy. On November 29, 2018 Judge Lleral closed the case citing no further evidence pointing towards anything different to an accidental drowning.&lt;ref name=cierran/&gt;

==Maldonado's legal plans==
Despite of the recovery of the body, and the results of the autopsy, the defense of the Maldonado family insists that the case was a forced disappearance. They consider that he had been taken and killed by the gendarmerie elsewhere, and then his body was planted into the crime scene. They say that the body presents signs of [[cryopreservation]], although the autopsy does not reveal such signs. This theory does not provide an explanation to the absence of any signs of manipulation of the body, or the way the gendarmerie could have sneaked into a location closely watched by the mapuches.&lt;ref name="nueva"/&gt; 

The Maldonado family requested a deeper autopsy study, and a new autopsy by independent people. The judge rejected both requests. He considered that the results of the autopsy were clear enough, and that an autopsy by outside people would go against the sovereignty of the judicial power. The defense asked for big number of investigations, that the judge systematically rejects as extemporaneous, pointless or impossible to perform. Those rejected investigations would be cited in later judicial stages, and even in a potential international case once all the local judicial venues are done, to argue an [[obstruction of justice]].&lt;ref name="nueva"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.infobae.com/sociedad/policiales/2018/10/21/caso-maldonado-como-es-la-nueva-estrategia-judicial-que-plantea-la-familia-para-lograr-una-condena-al-estado/|title= Caso Maldonado: cómo es la nueva estrategia judicial que plantea la familia para lograr una condena al Estado|trans-title= Maldonado case: Which is the new judicial strategy by the family to get a sentence against the state|language= Spanish|author= Loreley Gaffoglio|date= October 21, 2018|publisher= Infobae|accessdate=October 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Former hypothesis ==

=== Forced disappearance ===

According to witnesses, after the Argentine National Gendarmerie had an encounter with the Lof, agents from this security force carried somebody to a truck.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pagina12.com.ar/57776-una-historia-de-mentiras-y-encubrimiento|title=Una historia de mentiras y encubrimiento {{!}} Página/12 accedió al expediente por la desaparición forzada de Santiago Maldonado|last=Meyer|first=Adriana|date=2017-08-20|work=PAGINA12|access-date=2017-09-17|language=es-AR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later those witnesses admitted to lying to the court and are facing perjury charges. The Gendarmerie denies having detained Maldonado, so does the minister of security, Patricia Bullrich.

The witnesses made public comments, but refused to testify in court.&lt;ref name="missing"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-41066685|title= Where is Santiago Maldonado? Argentina searches for missing protester|author= |date= August 27, 2017|publisher= BBC|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They proposed to testify while concealing their identities with hoods, which was rejected by the judiciary.&lt;ref name="primeros"/&gt; Other witnesses told before justice that Maldonado was taken by Gendarmerie agents.&lt;ref name="primeros"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Devanna|first1=Cecilia|title=Los primeros testigos declararon ante fiscales|trans-title=The first witnesses declared before prosecutors|url=http://www.perfil.com/politica/los-primeros-testigos-declararon-ante-fiscales.phtml|accessdate=26 August 2017|work=[[Perfil]]|date=13 August 2017|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eighty biological samples were retrieved from the vehicles used by the Gendarmerie during the operation, and used for a DNA test. Another fourteen samples were ignored, as they were unsuitable for testing. The results were released a month later: none of them matched the DNA of Maldonado.&lt;ref name="noes"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.infobae.com/sociedad/policiales/2017/09/12/caso-maldonado-la-prueba-de-adn-en-la-camioneta-de-gendarmeria-dio-negativa/|title= El ADN hallado en las camionetas de la Gendarmería no es de Santiago Maldonado|trans-title=The DNA found at the Gendarmerie trucks do not belong to Maldonado|language= Spanish|author= |date= September 12, 2017|publisher= Infobae|accessdate=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value of this evidence has been disputed by public defender Fernando Machado, who argued that the samples would have been taken after the trucks had been washed. The judge dismissed those concerns.&lt;ref name="noes"/&gt;

The prosecutor Silvina Avila made a report that established that there are no solid evidences that link the Gendarmerie with Maldonado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/caso-maldonado-fiscal-confirma-debiles-pruebas-gendarmeria_0_r15R9PXtW.html|title= Caso Maldonado: la fiscal confirma que son débiles las pruebas contra Gendarmería|trans-title=Maldonado case: the prosecutor confirms that the proofs against the Gendarmerie are weak|language= Spanish|author= Claudio Andrade|date= August 29, 2017|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 17, the judge does not consider the theory of a forced disappearance to be likely.&lt;ref name="ahogo"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/2063758-el-juez-guido-otranto-la-hipotesis-mas-razonable-es-que-maldonado-se-ahogo|title= El juez Guido Otranto: "La hipótesis más razonable es que Maldonado se ahogó"|trans-title=The judge Guido Otranto: "The most reasonable theory is that Maldonado drowned"|language= Spanish|author= Loreley Gaffoglio|date= September 17, 2017|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=September 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audio files were taken from [[WhatsApp]] conversations held by those involved in the operation on the day. One of the files, sent by a member of the gendarmeria, states that a sergeant had "Maldonado in a truck".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/2065471-otro-audio-de-gendarmeria-dijo-que-el-que-tenia-a-maldonado-en-la-camioneta-era-la-sargento-sartirana|title=Otro audio de Gendarmería: "Dijo que el que tenía a Maldonado en la camioneta era la sargento Sartirana"|access-date=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more detailed analysis revealed that the comment was made on August 16, only as part of a private joke between members of the Gendarmerie while Bullrich explained the case to the Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.clarin.com/politica/desafortunado-chiste-gendarmes-genero-confusion-caso-maldonado_0_BJ5YeWQjW.html|title= Un desafortunado chiste entre gendarmes generó una confusión más en el Caso Maldonado|trans-title=An unfortunate joke between Gendarmerie members caused further confusion in the Maldonado case|language= Spanish|author= Claudio Andrade|date= September 22, 2017|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; All 70 cell phones of the gendarmes were investigated, and none of them had been used to discuss an actual forced disappearance operation.&lt;ref name="dos" /&gt;

Ariel Garzi, a fellow craftsman from El Bolsón, called Santiago Maldonado's cellphone on August 2. The call was answered by an unknown person. It lasted 22 seconds, during which Garzi heard the sound of steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://latinta.com.ar/2017/08/testigo-clave-ariel-garzi-llamada/|title=Testigo del caso Maldonado: una llamada, 22 segundos y el ruido de las botas|date=2017-08-22|work=La tinta|access-date=2017-10-01|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ariel Garbanz, an engineer from the Communications Security Lab of the [[National Technological University]], investigated the call and claims to know the location where the phone was answered. Judge Otranto refused to look at this evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.telam.com.ar/notas/201709/202874-especialista-asegura-tener-probado-donde-se-activo-el-celular-de-maldonado-un-dia-despues-de-su-desaparicion.html|title=Un especialista asegura tener probado dónde se activó el celular de Maldonado un día después de su desaparición|website=www.telam.com.ar|access-date=2017-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Received a mortal wound===
Maldonado could have received a mortal wound during the escape, which would have caused his death at some later point. The Mapuches may have buried the body and then made up an accusation about an alleged forced disappearance in order to advance their political agenda.&lt;ref name="hipo"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/2062433-caso-maldonado-los-tres-escenarios-que-plantean-los-investigadores|title= La desaparición de Santiago Maldonado: las tres hipótesis que plantean los investigadores|trans-title=The disappearance of Santiago Maldonado: the three hypotheses held by investigators|language= Spanish|author= Loreley Gaffoglio|date= September 13, 2017|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=September 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hiding===
A theory considered that Maldonado was still alive, hiding in Mapuche territory. A search with [[search and rescue dog]]s conducted on August 16 suggested that he would have been in the area in the previous 24 hours.&lt;ref name="hipo"/&gt;

The government also considered that Maldonado may have never been in the protest to begin with. As all people in the protest were hooded, it was not possible to properly recognize him in photos or filmings of the event. The Maldonado family reported that he was a quiet and peaceful man, which would make it unlikely that he would take part in a violent protest in a road. The mapuches Beatriz Garay Neri, Soraya Noemí Guitart and Nicolás Jones Huala reported that they talked with him on August 1, in the morning, but did not provide further details about his presence or the topics of discussion. They did not report his absence either, and ignored his full name.&lt;ref name="dos" /&gt;

===Murder===
Santiago Maldonado used his cell phone for the last time on July 21, 2017. That day, four or five hooded members of the [[Resistencia Ancestral Mapuche]] invaded the small house of Evaristo Jones, a worker for the Benetton family. Jones reported that he tried to defend himself by stabbing one of those people with a knife. As there are no cases of knife injuries treated in nearby hospitals on that day, or info about Maldonado's activities in the immediate days prior to the August 1 protest, it is suspected that he may be the stabbed thief, and that he had bled to death days before the protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/creen-artesano-uso-ultima-vez-celular-10-dias-desaparecer_0_BknB_oQuW.html|title= Creen que el artesano usó por última vez su celular 10 días antes de desaparecer|trans-title=It is considered that the craftman used his cell phone for the last time 10 days before disappearing|language= Spanish|author= Claudia Andrade|date= August 17, 2017|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family of Maldonado tried to refute this theory by providing a video of another picketing protest of the RAM that took place on July 31, which would have been attended by Maldonado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/2057718-la-familia-de-santiago-maldonado-presento-un-video-donde-se-lo-veria-cortando-la-ruta-40|title= La Justicia analiza un video aportado por la familia de Santiago Maldonado|trans-title=|language= Spanish|author= |date= |publisher= |accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also provide testimonials from numerous people who saw Santiago after the supposed attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.santiagomaldonado.com/recomendamos-leer-los-ultimos-dias-santiago-cuatro-testimonios-desmienten-la-hipotesis-del-gobierno/|title=Recomendamos leer: Los últimos días de Santiago, cuatro testimonios que desmienten la hipótesis del gobierno - Santiago Maldonado|date=2017-08-24|work=Santiago Maldonado|access-date=2017-09-17|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Evaristo Jones, the attacked worker, denied having hurt any of the attackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.laizquierdadiario.com/Santiago-Maldonado-el-puestero-niega-las-versiones-del-Gobierno|title=Santiago Maldonado: el puestero niega las versiones del Gobierno|last=Pagés|first=Gloria|work=La Izquierda Diario|access-date=2017-09-17|language=es-LA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Maldonado family also affirms that they had telephone conversations with Santiago on July 25 (his birthday) and on July 27.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.santiagomaldonado.com/las-fotos-se-estan-distribuyendo-whatsapp/|title=Sobre las fotos que se están distribuyendo por Whatsapp. - Santiago Maldonado|date=2017-09-03|work=Santiago Maldonado|access-date=2017-09-17|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through DNA tests it was proved that Santiago Maldonado was not injured in said episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cij.gov.ar/nota-27424-Caso-Santiago-Maldonado--comunicado-del-Juzgado-Federal-de-Esquel.html|title=Caso Santiago Maldonado: comunicado del Juzgado Federal de Esquel|last=Judicial|first=CIJ - Centro de Información|website=cij.gov.ar|access-date=2017-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disappearance of Maldonado took place shortly before the [[Argentine legislative election, 2017|2017 midterm elections]]. [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]], leader of one of the opposition parties, mentioned the case repeatedly during her rallies.&lt;ref name="missing"/&gt; Kirchner and several Kirchnerite politicians used it to draw controversial comparisons between the [[presidency of Mauricio Macri]] and the 1970s [[Dirty War]]. However, political analysts consider that the case is unlikely to affect the election results, and that the aggressive rhetoric of Kirchner may actually scare independent voters and increase the chances of the ''[[Cambiemos]]'' official coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/2059170-santiago-maldonado-un-salvavidas-para-cristina-kirchner|title= Santiago Maldonado, ¿un salvavidas para Cristina Kirchner?|trans-title=Santiago Maldonado, a life jacket for Cristina Kirchner?|language= Spanish|author= Fernando Laborda|date= September 3, 2017|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=September 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the corpse of Maldonado was found a few days before the elections. By the time of voting, the Maldonado family had confirmed his identity and the initial autopsy revealed no signs of violence against the body; the official results of the full autopsy would be released a pair of weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://elpais.com/internacional/2017/10/20/argentina/1508536687_321209.html|title= La autopsia certifica que Santiago Maldonado no fue disparado ni golpeado|trans-title= The autopsy confirms that Maldonado has not been shot or attacked|language= Spanish|author= Carlos Cue|date= October 21, 2017|publisher= El País|accessdate=September 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

August 30 is the [[International Day of the Disappeared]], and several teachers affiliated to the CTERA union mentioned the event during school classes. This action was rejected by groups of parents because it described the involvement of the Gendarmerie as a confirmed fact, and it was considered a case of political [[indoctrination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/caso-maldonado-escuelas-padres-indignacion-respaldo_0_ry32n84tb.html|title= Caso Maldonado en las escuelas: los padres, entre la indignación y el respaldo|trans-title=Maldonado case: parents, torn between indignation and support|language= Spanish|author= |date= August 30, 2017|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Macri administration first negated the disappearance of Maldonado.

[[File:Desde Colonia preguntamos Dónde está Santiago Maldonado?.jpg|thumb|Demonstrators in [[Uruguay]] ask for the whereabouts of Santiago Maldonado]]
On September 1, 2017, a month after Santiago Maldonado's disappearance, thousands of people expressed themselves through rallies and demonstrations asking for his appearance alive. The largest demonstration took place in [[Plaza de Mayo]] and was organized by [[Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo]], [[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo]] (Línea Fundadora), Relatives of the Disappeared and Imprisoned for Political Reasons, [[HIJOS]], the Center for Legal and Social Studies (CELS), the Argentine League for the Rights of Man, and the Permanent Assembly for Human Rights, among other organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.telam.com.ar/notas/201709/199807-marcha-santiago-maldonado.html|title=Sergio Maldonado: "A la ministra de Seguridad le pido que dé un paso al costado"|website=www.telam.com.ar|access-date=2017-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cities, such as [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]], [[Mar del Plata]], [[San Luis, Argentina|San Luis]], [[San Juan, Argentina|San Juan]], [[Neuquén]], [[Salta]], [[Posadas, Argentina|Posadas]], [[San Salvador de Jujuy|Jujuy]], [[Santiago del Estero]], [[Villaguay]], [[Concepción del Uruguay]], [[Gualeguaychú, Entre Ríos|Gualeguaychú]] and [[Concordia, Argentina|Concordia]] there were rallies and demonstrations with the same demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.telam.com.ar/notas/201709/199865-marchas-actos-pedido-aparicion-santiago-maldonado-ciudades-provincias-argentina.html|title=El pedido por Santiago Maldonado también se replicó en varias ciudades del país|website=www.telam.com.ar|access-date=2017-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Rosario and Córdoba there were rallies with an attendance of 40000 each.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lacapital.com.ar/la-ciudad/unas-40-mil-personas-se-congregaron-rosario-reclamar-la-aparicion-santiago-maldonado-n1462297.html|title=Unas 40 mil personas se congregaron en Rosario para reclamar por Santiago Maldonado|work=La Capital|access-date=2017-09-21|language=es-AR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cba24n.com.ar/content/santiago-maldonado-%C2%BFcomo-sera-la-marcha-en-cordoba|title=Córdoba marchó por la aparición de Santiago Maldonado|work=Cba24n|access-date=2017-09-21|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also protests in Spain, Brazil, France, Uruguay, Chile, Mexico, Austria and the United States which were organized through social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.telam.com.ar/notas/201709/199851-londres-manifestacion-santiago-maldonado.html|title=Argentinos y británicos se manifestaron por la aparición de Santiago Maldonado|website=www.telam.com.ar|access-date=2017-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cronica.com.ar/mundo/El-mundo-reclama-la-aparicion-de-Santiago-Maldonado-20170901-0034.html|title=El mundo reclama la aparición de Santiago Maldonado|work=Crónica|access-date=2017-09-21|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; In London,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pagina12.com.ar/60386-tambien-en-el-exterior|title=También en el exterior {{!}} El reclamo por Maldonado llegó hasta Londres|last=Justo|first=Marcelo|work=PAGINA12|access-date=2017-09-21|language=es-AR}}&lt;/ref&gt; São Paulo, Berlin, Montevideo, Rio de Janeiro, Madrid, Barcelona, Sidney, Santiago, Mexico City, Vienna, Washington DC and New York City, groups of people expressed their solidarity with the demand for the appearance of Santiago Maldonado alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://diariohoy.net/politica/la-argentina-y-el-mundo-reclamaron-su-aparicion-con-vida-104153|title=La Argentina y el mundo reclamaron su aparición con vida {{!}} Diario Hoy|access-date=2017-09-21|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eldia.com/nota/2017-9-1-20-22-0-el-pedido-por-la-aparicion-de-santiago-maldonado-traspaso-las-fronteras-el-pais|title=El pedido por la aparición de Santiago Maldonado traspasó las fronteras|last=www.eldia.com|first=Diario El Dia de La Plata|website=www.eldia.com|language=es|access-date=2017-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eldiario.com.ar/sociedad/el-pedido-de-aparicioacuten-con-vida-de-santiago-fue-internacional-1.htm|title=El pedido de aparición con vida de Santiago fue internacional - Sociedad - El diario|last=Technologies|first=Advertis Web|website=El pedido de aparición con vida de Santiago fue internacional - Sociedad - El diario|language=es-LA|access-date=2017-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deaths of '''Janson Tate Rowland''' (November 7, 1970 – July 26, 1988)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=Rowland&amp;GSiman=1&amp;GScnty=2557&amp;GRid=65667535&amp;|work=Find a Grave|title=Janson Tate Rowland|accessdate=January 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Terrie John Trosper''' (February 27, 1969 – May 30, 1991),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=trosper&amp;GSfn=terrie&amp;GSbyrel=all&amp;GSdyrel=all&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=163427277&amp;df=all&amp;|work=Find a Grave|title=Terrie Shawn Jones Trosper|accessdate=January 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; two siblings in [[Childress, Texas]], occurred in 1988 and 1991, respectively. Their deaths, though ruled a suicide and an accident, were one of several cases attributed to the [[Satanic ritual abuse#As moral panic|Satanic panic]] that occurred in the United States in the late 1980s.{{Sfn|Hollandsworth|1992|p=90}}

==Deaths==
===Tate Rowland===
On the evening of July 26, 1988, the body of seventeen-year-old Tate Rowland was discovered hanging from a horse apple tree on a dirt road outside of [[Childress, Texas]] by his friend, Chad Johnston.{{Sfn|Hollandsworth|1992|p=90}} At 6 p.m., Johnston came to Rowland's house, where he told Rowland's father and stepmother, Brenda, that he had witnessed Tate hang himself.{{Sfn|Hollandsworth|1992|P=120}} The three rushed to the tree where Chad had witnessed the suicide, and Rowland's father, Jimmie, cut him down from the tree.{{Sfn|Hollandsworth|1992|p=120}} According to Johnston, he and Rowland had been drinking beers outside their truck near the tree; he claimed that he had walked to the other side of the truck to throw a beer can away, and when he returned, he witnessed Rowland hang himself with the rope.{{Sfn|Hollandsworth|1992|p=120}} 

During a second interview with Johnston on July 28, he claimed that he witnessed Rowland attempt to hang himself twice; the first time, the rope broke, and the two returned to Rowland's home to retrieve another rope. Upon returning to the tree, Johnston claimed Rowland was able to successfully hang himself by standing on the hood of the car and jumping off.{{Sfn|Hollandsworth|1992|p=120}}

Rowland's death was officially ruled a [[suicide]],{{Sfn|Hollandsworth|1992|p=90}} attributed to personal troubles regarding the breakup between him and his girlfriend the year prior; however, on the day of his death, it was reported by friends and family that he had not exhibited any signs of being upset or depressed.{{Sfn|Hollandsworth|1992|p=121}} He had made plans to fill in as a coach at a friend's softball game that evening.{{Sfn|Hollandsworth|1992|p=121}}

===Terrie Trosper===
Three years after the suicide of her younger brother, Terrie Trosper, age 22, was found deceased in her bed on the morning of May 31, 1991.&lt;ref name=seattle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19920427&amp;slug=1488721|work=The Seattle Times|title=Texas Panhandle Lets Out A Giant `Oooops!'|author=Ivins, Molly|date=April 27, 1992|accessdate=December 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first autopsy of Trosper by pathologist Dr. Ralph Erdmann showed that Trosper had died as a result of choking on her own vomit.

According to friend Lisa Barber, Trosper had never believed her younger brother had committed suicide.{{Sfn|Hollandsworth|1992|p=124}} According to her autopsy, high levels of the [[Elavil]] were found in Trosper's blood.{{Sfn|Hollandsworth|1992|p=125}}

==Rumors of Satanism==
Rumors surrounding the possibility of a [[Satanism|Satanic cult]] being involved in the deaths began at Tate Rowlandson's funeral. According to the family, an unknown woman entered the chapel during Rowland's funeral, leaving before its conclusion; additionally, a male in attendance was reportedly chanting the word "suicide" during the funeral.{{Sfn|Hollandsworth|1992|p=122}} According to the district attorney, there were also eyewitness reports of strangers attempting to pick up children from the local schools in the fall of 1988, and multiple phone calls were received each day by the police department claiming Rowland had been murdered due to his affiliations with a Satanic cult.{{Sfn|Hollandsworth|1992|p=122}} 

In November 1988, fifteen-year-old Ray Wilks, a peer of Rowland's, was arrested for drunkedly crashing a car into a utility pole. At his booking, Wilks claimed to have been a member of the rumored Satanic cult, and also claimed to have witnessed Rowland's death.{{Sfn|Hollandsworth|1992|p=123}} According to Wilks' father, however, he couldn't have witnessed Rowland's death, as he was in a juvenile detention center the night of the hanging.{{Sfn|Hollandsworth|1992|p=123}}

After Trosper's death, the rumors were reignited after Darwin Wilks, the older brother of Ray Wilks, attempted suicide by an Elavil overdose—the same drug found in Trosper's blood.{{Sfn|Hollandsworth|1992|p=125}} On July 27, 1991, Rowland's body was exhumed due to the circulating allegations.{{Sfn|Hollandsworth|1992|p=125}} Though Rowland's body was too decomposed to make conclusive statements about the hanging as a suicide, there were levels of Elavil found in his remains, and the coroner claimed have been seventy percent sure that the death was a result of [[homicide]].{{Sfn|Hollandsworth|1992|p=125}} Trosper's body was also exhumed in late October, and the second autopsy, performed in December, revealed contusions on her thigh as well as evidence that she had been smothered to death.&lt;ref name=seattle/&gt;{{Sfn|Hollandsworth|1992|p=125}} 

After the autopsy information was made public, rumors circulated that Tate Rowland's death had actually been a cult sacrifice attended by as many as twenty people.{{Sfn|Hollandsworth|1992|p=90}} Other reports of robed cult members and animal sacrifices occurring in the town in the ensuing year.{{Sfn|Hollandsworth|1992|p=90}} The speculation surrounding the deaths of Rowland and Trosper led the [[Texas Department of Public Safety]] to distribute pamphlets to local police departments listing thirty ways to determine whether or not a death had been the result of occult ritual abuse.{{Sfn|Hollandsworth|p=93}}

[[File:Dr. Frank Drake.jpg|thumb|Dr. [[Frank Drake]]]]

The '''Drake equation''' is a [[probability theory|probabilistic argument]] used to estimate the number of active, communicative [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial civilizations]] in the [[Milky Way]] [[galaxy]].&lt;ref name="Burchell"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Glade |first1=N. |last2=Ballet |first2=P. |last3=Bastien |first3=O. |date=2012 |title=A stochastic process approach of the drake equation parameters |journal=[[International Journal of Astrobiology]] |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=103–108 |arxiv=1112.1506 |bibcode=2012IJAsB..11..103G |doi=10.1017/S1473550411000413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The equation was written in 1961 by [[Frank Drake]], not for purposes of quantifying the number of civilizations, but as a way to stimulate scientific dialogue at the first scientific meeting on the [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI).&lt;ref name='December 2002'&gt;{{cite web |date=December 2002 |title=Chapter 3 — Philosophy: "Solving the Drake Equation |url=http://www.setileague.org/askdr/drake.htm |work=Ask Dr. SETI |publisher=SETI League  |accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Drake |first=N. |date=30 June 2014 |title=How my Dad's Equation Sparked the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/06/140630-drake-equation-50-years-later-aliens-science/ |work=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equation summarizes the main concepts which scientists must contemplate when considering the question of other radio-communicative life.&lt;ref name='December 2002'/&gt;  It is more properly thought of as a [[Fermi problem]] rather than as a serious attempt to nail down a precise number.

Criticism related to the Drake equation focuses not on the equation itself, but on the fact that the estimated values for several of its factors are highly conjectural, the combined effect being that the uncertainty associated with any derived value is so large that the equation cannot be used to draw firm conclusions.

==Equation==
The Drake equation is:

:&lt;math&gt;N = R_* \cdot f_\mathrm{p} \cdot n_\mathrm{e} \cdot f_\mathrm{l} \cdot f_\mathrm{i} \cdot f_\mathrm{c} \cdot L&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:{{math|''N''}} = the number of [[civilization]]s in our galaxy with which communication might be possible (i.e. which are on our current past [[light cone]]);

and

:{{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;}} = the average rate of [[star formation]] in [[Milky Way|our galaxy]]
:{{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}} = the fraction of those stars that have [[planet]]s
:{{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}} = the average number of planets that can potentially support [[life]] per star that has planets
:{{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;}} = the fraction of planets that could support life that actually develop life at some point
:{{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} = the fraction of planets with life that actually go on to develop [[intelligence|intelligent]] life (civilizations)
:{{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}} = the fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that releases detectable signs of their existence into space
:{{math|''L''}} = the length of time for which such civilizations release detectable signals into space&lt;ref name="NOVA"&gt;

==History==
In September 1959, physicists [[Giuseppe Cocconi]] and [[Philip Morrison]] published an article in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' with the provocative title "Searching for Interstellar Communications".&lt;ref name='Cocconi 1959'&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cocconi and Morrison argued that [[radio telescope]]s had become sensitive enough to pick up transmissions that might be broadcast into space by civilizations orbiting other stars. Such messages, they suggested, might be transmitted at a [[wavelength]] of 21&amp;nbsp;cm (1,420.4&amp;nbsp;[[megahertz|MHz]]). This is the wavelength of radio emission by neutral [[hydrogen]], the most common element in the universe, and they reasoned that other intelligences might see this as a logical landmark in the [[radio spectrum]].

Two months later, Harvard University astronomy professor [[Harlow Shapley]] speculated on the number of inhabited planets in the universe, saying "The universe has 10 million, million, million suns (10 followed by 18 zeros) similar to our own. One in a million has planets around it. Only one in a million million has the right combination of chemicals, temperature, water, days and nights to support planetary life as we know it. This calculation arrives at the estimated figure of 100 million worlds where life has been forged by evolution."&lt;ref name="SydneyMorningHerald"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven months after Cocconi and Morrison published their article, Drake made the first systematic search for signals from communicative extraterrestrial civilizations. Using the 25&amp;nbsp;m dish of the [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]] in [[Green Bank, West Virginia]], Drake monitored two nearby Sun-like stars: [[Epsilon Eridani]] and [[Tau Ceti]]. In this project, which he called [[Project Ozma]], he slowly scanned frequencies close to the 21&amp;nbsp;cm wavelength for six hours per day from April to July 1960.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; The project was well designed, inexpensive, and simple by today's standards. It detected no signals.

Soon thereafter, Drake hosted a "[[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]]" meeting on detecting their radio signals. The meeting was held at the Green Bank facility in 1961. The equation that bears Drake's name arose out of his preparations for the meeting.&lt;ref name="Astrobiology Magazine"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.astrobio.net/alien-life/the-drake-equation-revisited-part-i/ | title=The Drake Equation Revisited: Part I | work=[[Astrobiology Magazine]] | date=Sep 29, 2003 | accessdate=May 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; As I planned the meeting, I realized a few day[s] ahead of time we needed an agenda. And so I wrote down all the things you needed to know to predict how hard it's going to be to detect extraterrestrial life. And looking at them it became pretty evident that if you multiplied all these together, you got a number, N, which is the number of detectable civilizations in our galaxy. This was aimed at the radio search, and not to search for primordial or primitive life forms.

Peter Pearman, Frank Drake, [[Philip Morrison]], businessman and radio amateur Dana Atchley, chemist [[Melvin Calvin]], astronomer [[Su-Shu Huang]], neuroscientist [[John C.

Within the limits of our existing technology, any practical search for distant intelligent life must necessarily be a search for some manifestation of a distant technology. After about 50 years, the Drake equation is still of seminal importance because it is a 'road map' of what we need to learn in order to solve this fundamental existential question.&lt;ref name="Burchell"/&gt; It also formed the backbone of [[astrobiology]] as a science; although speculation is entertained to give context, astrobiology concerns itself primarily with [[hypotheses]] that fit firmly into existing [[Theory#Science|scientific theories]]. Some 50 years of SETI have failed to find anything, even though radio telescopes, receiver techniques, and computational abilities have improved enormously since the early 1960s, but it has been discovered, at least, that our galaxy is not teeming with very powerful alien transmitters continuously broadcasting near the 21&amp;nbsp;cm [[Hydrogen frequencies|hydrogen frequency]]. No one could say this in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astronomynow.com/news/n1004/SETI/ SETI: A celebration of the first 50 years]. Keith Cooper. ''Astronomy Now''. 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modifications==
As many observers have pointed out, the Drake equation is a very simple model that does not include potentially relevant parameters,&lt;ref&gt;

Others note that the Drake equation ignores many concepts that might be relevant to the odds of contacting other civilizations.  For example, [[David Brin]] states: "The Drake equation merely speaks of the number of sites at which ETIs spontaneously arise. The equation says nothing directly about the contact cross-section between an ETIS and contemporary human society".&lt;ref name="GS"&gt;

 |bibcode=1983QJRAS..24..283B
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because it is the contact cross-section that is of interest to the SETI community, many additional factors and modifications of the Drake equation have been proposed.

;Colonization : It has been proposed to generalize the Drake equation to include additional effects of alien civilizations colonizing other [[star system]]s. Each original site expands with an expansion velocity {{mvar|v}}, and establishes additional sites that survive for a lifetime {{mvar|L}}.  The result is a more complex set of 3 equations.&lt;ref name="GS"/&gt;

;Reappearance factor : The Drake equation may furthermore be multiplied by ''how many times'' an intelligent civilization may occur on planets where it has happened once. Even if an intelligent civilization reaches the end of its lifetime after, for example, 10,000 years, life may still prevail on the planet for billions of years, permitting the next [[Sociocultural evolution|civilization to evolve]]. Thus, several civilizations may come and go during the lifespan of one and the same planet. Thus, if {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the average number of times a new civilization reappears on the same planet where a previous civilization once has appeared and ended, then the total number of civilizations on such a planet would be {{math|1 + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;}}, which is the actual ''reappearance factor'' added to the equation.

:The factor depends on what generally is the cause of [[civilization extinction]]. If it is generally by temporary uninhabitability, for example a [[nuclear winter]], then {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;}} may be relatively high. On the other hand, if it is generally by permanent uninhabitability, such as [[stellar evolution]], then {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;}} may be almost zero. In the case of total life extinction, a similar factor may be applicable for {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;}}, that is, ''how many times'' life may appear on a planet where it has appeared once.

;METI factor : [[Aleksandr Leonidovich Zaitsev|Alexander Zaitsev]] said that to be in a communicative phase and emit dedicated messages are not the same. For example, humans, although being in a communicative phase, are not a communicative civilization; we do not practise such activities as the purposeful and regular transmission of interstellar messages. For this reason, he suggested introducing the METI factor (messaging to extraterrestrial intelligence) to the classical Drake equation.&lt;ref&gt;

 |accessdate=2013-04-20
}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defined the factor as "the fraction of communicative civilizations with clear and non-paranoid planetary consciousness", or alternatively expressed, the fraction of communicative civilizations that actually engage in deliberate interstellar transmission.

:The METI factor is somewhat misleading since active, purposeful transmission of messages by a civilization is not required for them to receive a broadcast sent by another that is seeking first contact. It is merely required they have capable and compatible receiver systems operational; however, this is a variable humans cannot accurately estimate.

;Biogenic gases : Astronomer [[Sara Seager]] proposed a revised equation that focuses on the search for planets with biosignature gases.&lt;ref name="NYT-20161207"&gt;{{cite news |last=Jones |first=Chris |title=‘The World Sees Me as the One Who Will Find Another Earth’ - The star-crossed life of Sara Seager, an astrophysicist obsessed with discovering distant planets. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/07/magazine/the-world-sees-me-as-the-one-who-will-find-another-earth.html |date=December 7, 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=December 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These gases are produced by living organisms that can accumulate in a planet atmosphere to levels that can be detected with remote space telescopes.&lt;ref name=equation&gt;[http://www.space.com/22648-drake-equation-alien-life-seager.html?cid=51463011558824 The Drake Equation Revisited: Interview with Planet Hunter Sara Seager] Devin Powell, ''Astrobiology Magazine''  4 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

:The Seager equation looks like this:&lt;ref name=equation /&gt;{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The rendering of the equation here is slightly modified for clarity of presentation from the rendering in the cited source.&lt;ref name=equation /&gt;}}
::&lt;math display=block&gt;N = N_* \cdot F_\mathrm{Q} \cdot F_\mathrm{HZ} \cdot F_\mathrm{O} \cdot F_\mathrm{L} \cdot F_\mathrm{S}&lt;/math&gt;
:where:

::{{math|''N''}} = the number of planets with detectable signs of life
::{{math|''N''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;}} = the number of stars observed
::{{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;Q&lt;/sub&gt;}} = the fraction of stars that are quiet
::{{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;HZ&lt;/sub&gt;}} = the fraction of stars with rocky planets in the habitable zone
::{{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;}} = the fraction of those planets that can be observed

::{{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;}} = the fraction on which life produces a detectable signature gas

Seager stresses, “We’re not throwing out the Drake Equation, which is really a different topic,” explaining, “Since Drake came up with the equation, we have discovered thousands of exoplanets. We as a community have had our views revolutionized as to what could possibly be out there. And now we have a real question on our hands, one that’s not related to intelligent life: Can we detect any signs of life in any way in the very near future?”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/what-a-brand-new-equation-reveals-about-our-odds-of-fin-531575395|title=A New Equation Reveals Our Exact Odds of Finding Alien Life|publisher=[[io9]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Original estimates===
There is considerable disagreement on the values of these parameters, but the 'educated guesses' used by Drake and his colleagues in 1961 were:&lt;ref&gt;

}} Note: This reference has a table of 1961 values, claimed to be taken from Drake &amp; Sobel, but these differ from the book.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;}} = 1 yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (1 star formed per year, on the average over the life of the galaxy; this was regarded as conservative)
* {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}} = 0.2 to 0.5 (one fifth to one half of all stars formed will have planets)
* {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}} = 1 to 5 (stars with planets will have between 1 and 5 planets capable of developing life)
* {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;}} = 1 (100% of these planets will develop life)
* {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} = 1 (100% of which will develop intelligent life)
* {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}} = 0.1 to 0.2 (10–20% of which will be able to communicate)
* {{math|''L''}} = 1000 to 100,000,000 years (which will last somewhere between 1000 and 100,000,000 years)

Inserting the above minimum numbers into the equation gives a minimum N of 20 (see: [[Drake equation#Range of results|Range of results]]). Inserting the maximum numbers gives a maximum of 50,000,000. Drake states that given the uncertainties, the original meeting concluded that {{math|''N'' ≈ ''L''}}, and there were probably between 1000 and 100,000,000 civilizations in the [[Milky Way]] galaxy.

The discovery of numerous [[gas giant]]s in close orbit with their stars has introduced doubt that life-supporting planets commonly survive the formation of their stellar systems. So-called [[hot Jupiter]]s may migrate from distant orbits to near orbits, in the process disrupting the orbits of habitable planets.

On the other hand, the variety of [[star system]]s that might have habitable zones is not just limited to solar-type stars and Earth-sized planets. It is now estimated that even tidally locked planets close to [[red dwarf]] stars [[habitability of red dwarf systems|might have habitable zones]],&lt;ref&gt;

The authors of the [[rare Earth hypothesis]] propose a number of additional constraints on habitability for planets, including being in galactic zones with suitably low radiation, high star metallicity, and low enough density to avoid excessive asteroid bombardment. They also propose that it is necessary to have a planetary system with large gas giants which provide bombardment protection without a [[hot Jupiter]]; and a planet with [[plate tectonic]]s, a large moon that creates tidal pools, and moderate [[axial tilt]] to generate seasonal variation.&lt;ref name="RareEarth"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ward |first1=Peter D. |last2=Brownlee |first2=Donald |title=Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe |publisher=Copernicus Books (Springer Verlag) |date=2000 |isbn=0-387-98701-0 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fraction of the above that actually go on to develop life, {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;}}====
Geological evidence from the Earth suggests that {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;}} may be high; life on Earth appears to have begun around the same time as favorable conditions arose, suggesting that [[abiogenesis]] may be relatively common once conditions are right. However, this evidence only looks at the Earth (a single model planet), and contains [[anthropic bias]], as the planet of study was not chosen randomly, but by the living organisms that already inhabit it (ourselves). From a classical [[hypothesis testing]] standpoint, there are zero [[degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]], permitting no valid estimates to be made. If life were to be found on [[life on Mars|Mars]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Enceladus]] or [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] that developed independently from life on Earth it would imply a value for {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;}} close to 1. While this would raise the degrees of freedom from zero to one, there would remain a great deal of uncertainty on any estimate due to the small sample size, and the chance they are not really independent.

Countering this argument is that there is no evidence for abiogenesis occurring more than once on the Earth — that is, all terrestrial life stems from a common origin. If abiogenesis were more common it would be speculated to have occurred more than once on the Earth. Scientists have searched for this by looking for [[bacteria]] that are unrelated to other life on Earth, but none have been found yet.&lt;ref&gt;

Biochemists [[Francis Crick]] and [[Leslie Orgel]] laid special emphasis on this uncertainty: "At the moment we have no means at all of knowing" whether we are "likely to be alone in the galaxy (Universe)" or whether "the galaxy may be pullulating with life of many different forms."&lt;ref&gt;

====Fraction of the above that develops intelligent life, {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}====
This value remains particularly controversial. Those who favor a low value, such as the biologist [[Ernst Mayr]], point out that of the billions of species that have existed on Earth, only one has become intelligent and from this, infer a tiny value for {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref name="Ernst Mayr on SETI"&gt;

In addition, while it appears that life developed soon after the formation of Earth, the [[Cambrian explosion]], in which a large variety of multicellular life forms came into being, occurred a considerable amount of time after the formation of Earth, which suggests the possibility that special conditions were necessary. Some scenarios such as the [[snowball Earth]] or research into the [[extinction events]] have raised the possibility that life on Earth is relatively fragile. Research on any past [[life on Mars]] is relevant since a discovery that life did form on Mars but ceased to exist might raise our estimate of f&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; but would indicate that in half the known cases, intelligent life did not develop.

Estimates of {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} have been affected by discoveries that the Solar System's orbit is circular in the galaxy, at such a distance that it remains out of the spiral arms for tens of millions of years (evading radiation from [[nova]]e). Also, Earth's large moon may aid the evolution of life by [[Rare Earth hypothesis#A large moon|stabilizing the planet's axis of rotation]].

For deliberate communication, the one example we have (the Earth) does not do much explicit communication, though there are [[Active SETI|some efforts]] covering only a tiny fraction of the stars that might look for our presence. (See [[Arecibo message]], for example). There is [[Fermi paradox#They choose not to interact with us|considerable speculation]] why an extraterrestrial civilization might exist but choose not to communicate. However, deliberate communication is not required, and calculations indicate that current or near-future Earth-level technology might well be detectable to civilizations not too much more advanced than our own.&lt;ref&gt;

Another question is what percentage of civilizations in the galaxy are close enough for us to detect, assuming that they send out signals.

====Lifetime of such a civilization wherein it communicates its signals into space, {{math|''L''}}====

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using 28 civilizations more recent than the Roman Empire, he calculates a figure of 304 years for "modern" civilizations. It could also be argued from Michael Shermer's results that the fall of most of these civilizations was followed by later civilizations that carried on the technologies, so it is doubtful that they are separate civilizations in the context of the Drake equation. In the expanded version, including ''reappearance number'', this lack of specificity in defining single civilizations does not matter for the end result, since such a civilization turnover could be described as an increase in the ''reappearance number'' rather than increase in {{math|''L''}}, stating that a civilization reappears in the form of the succeeding cultures. Furthermore, since none could communicate over interstellar space, the method of comparing with historical civilizations could be regarded as invalid.

[[David Grinspoon]] has argued that once a civilization has developed enough, it might overcome all threats to its survival. It will then last for an indefinite period of time, making the value for {{math|''L''}} potentially billions of years. If this is the case, then he proposes that the Milky Way galaxy may have been steadily accumulating advanced civilizations since it formed.&lt;ref name="David Grinspoon 2004"&gt;
{{cite book

This has the advantage that {{math|''T''}} would be a relatively easy to discover number, as it would simply be some fraction of the age of the universe.

It has also been hypothesized that once a civilization has learned of a more advanced one, its longevity could increase because it can learn from the experiences of the other.&lt;ref name="GoldsmithOwen"&gt;

The astronomer [[Carl Sagan]] speculated that all of the terms, except for the lifetime of a civilization, are relatively high and the determining factor in whether there are large or small numbers of civilizations in the universe is the civilization lifetime, or in other words, the ability of technological civilizations to avoid self-destruction. In Sagan's case, the Drake equation was a strong motivating factor for his interest in environmental issues and his efforts to warn against the dangers of [[nuclear warfare]].

===Range of results===
As many skeptics have pointed out, the Drake equation can give a very wide range of values, depending on the assumptions,&lt;ref&gt;"The value of {{mvar|N}} remains highly uncertain.

===Has intelligent life ''ever'' existed?===
The Drake equation can be modified to determine just how unlikely intelligent life must be, to give the result that Earth has the only intelligent life that has ever arisen, either in our galaxy or the universe as a whole. This simplifies the calculation by removing the lifetime and communication constraints. Since star and planets counts are known, this leaves the only unknown as the odds that a habitable planet ''ever'' develops intelligent life. For Earth to have the only civilization that has ever occurred in the universe, then the odds of any habitable planet ever developing such a civilization must be less than {{val|2.5|e=-24}}. Similarly, for Earth to host the only civilization in our galaxy for all time, the odds of a habitable zone planet ever hosting intelligent life must be less than {{val|1.7|e=-11}} (about 1 in 60 billion). The figure for the universe implies that it is highly unlikely that Earth hosts the only intelligent life that has ever occurred. The figure for our galaxy suggests that other civilizations may have occurred or will likely occur in our galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://phys.org/news/2016-04-limits-uniqueness.html |title= Are we alone?

==Criticism==
Criticism of the Drake equation follows mostly from the observation that several terms in the equation are largely or entirely based on conjecture.  Star formation rates are well-known, and the incidence of planets has a sound theoretical and observational basis, but the other terms in the equation become very speculative. The uncertainties revolve around our understanding of the evolution of life, intelligence, and civilization, not physics.  No statistical estimates are possible for some of the parameters, where only one example is known.  The net result is that the equation cannot be used to draw firm conclusions of any kind, and the resulting margin of error is huge, far beyond what some consider acceptable or meaningful.&lt;ref&gt;

Hence Fermi's question "Where is everybody?".&lt;ref name="OSTI-19850301"&gt;

A large number of explanations have been proposed to explain this lack of contact; a book published in 2015 elaborated on 75 different explanations.&lt;ref&gt;

 |publisher=Springer International Publishing
 |isbn=3319132350
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of the Drake Equation, the explanations can be divided into three classes:

*Few intelligent civilizations ever arise.  This is an argument that at least one of the first few terms, {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt; · ''f''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; · ''n''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; · ''f''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; · ''f''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}, has a low value.  The most common suspect is {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}, but explanations such as the rare Earth hypothesis argue that {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the small term.
*Intelligent civilizations exist, but we see no evidence, meaning {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}} is small.  Typical arguments include [[Fermi paradox#Intelligent civilizations are too far apart in space or time|that civilizations are too far apart]], [[Fermi paradox#It is too expensive to spread physically throughout the galaxy|it is too expensive to spread throughout the galaxy]], [[Fermi paradox#Civilizations broadcast detectable radio signals only for a brief period of time|civilizations broadcast signals for only a brief period of time]], [[Fermi paradox#It is dangerous to communicate|it is dangerous to communicate]], and many others.
*The lifetime of intelligent, communicative civilizations is short, meaning the value of {{mvar|L}} is small. Drake suggested that a large number of extraterrestrial civilizations would form, and he further speculated that the lack of evidence of such civilizations may be because technological civilizations tend to disappear rather quickly. Typical explanations include [[Fermi paradox#It is the nature of intelligent life to destroy itself|it is the nature of intelligent life to destroy itself]], [[Fermi paradox#It is the nature of intelligent life to destroy others|it is the nature of intelligent life to destroy others]], [[Fermi paradox#Periodic extinction by natural events|they tend to be destroyed by natural events]], and others.

These lines of reasoning lead to the [[Great Filter]] hypothesis,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
 |last=Hanson |first=R.
 |date=15 September 1998
 |title=The Great Filter — Are We Almost Past It?
 |url=http://hanson.gmu.edu/greatfilter.html
 |accessdate=2013-08-21
}}&lt;/ref&gt; which states that since there are no observed extraterrestrial civilizations, despite the vast number of stars, then some step in the process must be acting as a filter to reduce the final value. According to this view, either it is very difficult for intelligent life to arise, or the lifetime of such civilizations, or the period of time they reveal their existence, must be relatively short.

==In fiction and popular culture==
The equation was cited by [[Gene Roddenberry]] as supporting the multiplicity of inhabited planets shown on ''[[Star Trek]]'', the television series he created. However, Roddenberry did not have the equation with him, and he was forced to "invent" it for his original proposal.&lt;ref&gt;''The Making of Star Trek'' by Stephen E. Whitfield and Gene Roddenberry, Ballantine Books, N. Y., 1968&lt;/ref&gt; The invented equation created by Roddenberry is:
::&lt;math&gt;Ff^2 (MgE)-C^1 Ri^1 \cdot M=L/So &lt;/math&gt;
However, a number raised to the first power is merely the number itself.

'''EcoSim''' is an individual-based predator-prey [[ecosystem]] simulation in which agents can evolve. It has been designed to investigate several broad ecological questions, as well as long-term evolutionary patterns and processes such as [[speciation]] and macroevolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gras|first=Robin|author2=Devaurs D. |author3=Wozniak A. |author4=Aspinall A. |title=An individual-based evolving predator-prey ecosystem simulation using a Fuzzy Cognitive Map model of behavior|journal=Artificial Life|year=2009|volume=15|issue=4|pages=423–463|doi=10.1162/artl.2009.Gras.012|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/artl.2009.Gras.012?journalCode=artl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nathalie|first=Osbore|title=Nature by numbers: Simulated ecosystems provide answers to biological questions|url=http://www.isgtw.org/feature/nature-numbers|newspaper=International Science Grid this Week|date=November 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=An|first=Li|title=Modeling human decisions in coupled human and natural systems: Review of agent-based models|journal=Ecological Modelling|year=2011|volume=229|pages=25–36|doi=10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2011.07.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McLane|first=Adam J.|author2=Christina Semeniukb |author3=Gregory J.

==Main concepts==
The agents have a behavior model which allows the evolutionary process to modify the behaviors of the predators and prey. Furthermore, there is a speciation mechanism which allows to study global patterns as well as species-specific patterns. In EcoSim, an individual's genomic data codes for its behavioral model and is represented by a [[fuzzy cognitive map]] (FCM). The FCM contains sensory concepts such as foodClose or predatorClose, internal states such as fear or hunger, and motor concepts such as escape or reproduce. The FCM is represented as an array of floating-point values which represent the extent to which one concept influences another. For example, it would be expected that the sensory concept predatorClose would positively affect the internal concept fear, which would then positively affect the escape motor concept. These relationships among concepts evolve over time, sometimes giving a new meaning to a concept. Furthermore, the FCM is heritable, meaning that a new agent is given an FCM which is a combination of that of its parents with possible mutations.

EcoSim subscribes to the “genotypic cluster” definition of a species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mallet|first=J.|title=A species definition for the modern synthesis|journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution|year=1995|volume=10|pages=294–299|doi=10.1016/0169-5347(95)90031-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speciation has been implemented using a 2-means clustering algorithm technique designed to allow the splitting of an existing species into two species, by clustering the individuals that initially belonged to the first species into one of the new two species, each one of them containing the agents that are mutually the most similar. Since EcoSim has the capacity to allow speciation events to occur, it is possible to track speciation events throughout a run of the simulation and construct the actual [[phylogenetic tree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scott|first=Ryan|author2=Gras R.|title=Comparing Distance-Based Phylogenetic Tree Construction Methods Using An Individual-Based Ecosystem Simulation, EcoSim|journal=he Thirteenth International Conference on the Synthesis and Simulation of Living Systems (Artificial Life 13)|year=2012|pages=105–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each agent also possesses several physical characteristics such as: maximum and current ages, minimum age for mating, maximum and current speeds, vision distance, maximum and current levels of energy, and the amount of energy transmitted to the offspring. Energy is provided to individuals by the resources (grass or meat) they find in their environment. An agent consumes some energy each time it performs an action and proportionally to the complexity (number of edges) of its FCM. If an individual uses all its energy, it dies.

A typical run lasts several tens of thousands of time steps. Each time step involves the time needed for each agent to perceive its environment, use its behavioral model to make a decision, perform its action as well as the time to update the species membership, including speciation events and all the world parameters. In a typical run, more than one billion of agents can be born and several thousands of species can be generated, which allows new behaviors to emerge and agents to adapt to a constantly changing environment. In addition, a food chain consisting of three levels, primary producers, predators and preys, has been implemented allowing complex interactions between agents and co-evolution to occur. All events, the mental state and action of every agent, are saved for every time step of every run. This allows a deep statistical analysis of the whole system using several dedicated tools that we have conceived to extract, measure and correlate any possible facts that could be useful to understand the underlying and emerging properties of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stephen|first=Fields|title=New resources speed up ecosystem evolution simulations for computer scientist|url=http://cms3.uwindsor.ca/takingaction/new-resources-speed-up-ecosystem-evolution-simulations-for-computer-scientist|date=August 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research publications==
Several studies have already been done using EcoSim. For example, Devaurs and Gras &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Devaurs|first=D.|author2=Gras R.|title=Species abundance patterns in an ecosystem simulation studied through Fisher’s logseries|journal=Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory|year=2010|volume=18|pages=100–123|doi=10.1016/j.simpat.2009.09.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; have analyzed the species abundance patterns observed in the communities generated by EcoSim, based on Fisher's log series. This study shows that the communities of species generated by the simulation follow the same lognormal law as natural communities and that EcoSim can help to evaluate the overall level of diversity of a given community. In other studies, the chaotic behavior of the system with multi-fractal properties has been proven in &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Golestani|first=A.|author2=Gras R.|title=Regularity analysis of an individual-based ecosystem simulation|journal=Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science|year=2010|volume=20: 043120}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it also has been observed for real ecosystems. Mashayekhi and Gras &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mashayekhi|first=M.|author2=Gras R.|title=Investigating the Effect of Spatial Distribution and Spatiotemporal Information on Speciation using Individual-Based Ecosystem Simulation|journal=Journal of Computing|year=2012|volume=2|pages=98–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigated the effect of spatial distribution and spatiotemporal information on speciation. In more recent research, Golestani et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Golestani|first=A.|author2=Gras R. |author3=Cristescu M. |title=Speciation with gene flow in a heterogeneous virtual world: can physical obstacles accelerate speciation?|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=August 2012|volume=279|issue=1740|pages=3055–3064|doi=10.1098/rspb.2012.0466|pmid=22513856|pmc=3385488}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigated how small, randomly distributed physical obstacles influence the distribution of populations and species, the level of population connectivity (e.g., gene flow), as well as the mode and tempo of speciation.

'''Elizabeth Knepp''' or '''Knipp''' (died 1681) was a British actress, singer, and dancer. The earliest theatrical reference to Knepp is from 1664, as being intended by [[Thomas Killigrew]] to play the part of Lusetta in his play ''Thomaso''. This means that she was probably in his troupe, the King's Company, by that  time. From 1666 onwards she is recorded as playing many parts, both tragic and comic, including Lady Fidget in [[William Wycherley]]'s ''[[The Country Wife]]''. In 1664, she became the first woman to perform the title role in [[Ben Jonson|Jonson's]] ''[[Epicoene, or the Silent Woman|Epicoene]]''. She also occasionally spoke [[prologue]]s and [[epilogue]]s, and often danced and sang in or between acts.

Knepp's husband was reputedly "ill-natured" and treated her badly. [[Samuel Pepys]] was fascinated by Knepp, and his diary for 1666—68 is full of references to her, including mentions of amorous encounters, and descriptions of how much he enjoyed her flirtatiousness and especially her singing. In the late 1670s she became mistress to the actor [[Joseph Haines]], and died in 1681 giving birth to his stillborn child.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1567">'''Enrique Eduardo Guillermo Salinas de Gortari''' (November 15, 1952 &amp;ndash; December 6, 2004) was the third of four brothers of former [[president of Mexico]] [[Carlos Salinas]]. 

On December 6, 2004 his [[Dead body|corpse]] was found, with a [[plastic bag]] placed over his head, inside a [[Volkswagen Passat]]. The [[vehicle]] was abandoned in the upmarket [[municipality]] of [[Huixquilucan]], [[Mexico (state)|Estado de México]], on the outskirts of [[Mexico City]]. The authorities gave [[asphyxiation]] as the cause of death. 

Unlike his brothers ex-president Carlos and convicted felon [[Raúl Salinas|Raúl]], Enrique had eschewed the world of politics in favour of the [[business]] sector. 

Salinas' widow and kids reside in [[Lausanne|Lausanne, Switzerland]]

'''Frederick II''' ({{lang-de|Friedrich II.}}; 25 April 1211 – 15 June 1246), known as '''Frederick the Quarrelsome''' (''Friedrich der Streitbare''), was [[List of rulers of Austria|Duke of Austria]] and [[Duchy of Styria|Styria]] from 1230 until his death. He was the fifth and last [[Duchy of Austria|Austrian]] duke from the [[House of Babenberg]], since the former [[Margraviate of Austria|margraviate]] was elevated to a duchy by the 1156 ''[[Privilegium Minus]]''.&lt;ref name="lingelbach"&gt;Lingelbach 1913, pp. 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt; He was killed in the [[Battle of the Leitha River]], leaving no male heirs.

==Family==
Born in [[Wiener Neustadt]], Frederick was the second surviving son of the Babenberg duke [[Leopold VI, Duke of Austria|Leopold VI of Austria]] and [[Theodora Angelina, Duchess of Austria|Theodora Angelina]], a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] princess. The death of his elder brother Henry in 1228 made him the only heir to the Austrian and Styrian duchies.

His first spouse was Byzantine princess Sophia Laskarina, probably a daughter of [[Theodore I Laskaris]] and his first wife [[Anna Komnene Angelina]], who died in 1222. Frederick secondly married [[Agnes of Merania (1215-1263)|Agnes of Merania]] in 1229, a member of the noble [[Counts of Andechs|House of Andechs]] whose [[dowry]] included large possessions in [[March of Carniola|Carniola]] and the [[Windic March]]. From 1232 Frederick called himself ''Dominus Carniolae'' ("Lord of Carniola"), however, the couple divorced due to childlessness in 1243.

==Reign==
Frederick succeeded his father in 1230. Proud of his Byzantine descent, the young duke soon was known as ''the Quarrelsome'' because of his harsh rule and frequent wars against his neighbors, primarily with [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]] and [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]]. Even the Austrian [[Burgschleinitz-Kühnring|Kuenring]] ''[[Ministerialis|ministeriales]]'', which had so far been faithful to the ruling house, started an insurgency as soon as his reign began.

According to the ''Weltchronik'' of [[Jans der Enikel]], Frederick had gone to the court of Emperor Frederick II by his summon, leading a procession of 200 knights wearing the triband colors of Austria. When he approached the Emperor, he was enthusiastically invited—by both command and request of Emperor Frederick—to eat bread with him. The Duke refused, stating he brought his own gold. But the Emperor insisted without prevailing. Thus instead he ordered that no one in the town sell the Duke firewood for his kitchen. Duke Frederick instead sought a house to buy and when the Emperor learned of this, forbade it. Duke Frederick then instructed his marshal to go out late at night and buy some nuts so that his food could be prepared. Duke Frederick had impressed the Emperor so much that he allowed him the sale of firewood and whatever he wishes. Afterwards, the Duke asked to be shown the Emperor's assassins, which he was allowed. They moved onto the town's tower, which stood 50 cubics tall, and brought out two of his assassins. The Emperor then told one to jump down and without a thought, the man leapt and fell to his death. Immediately, Duke Frederick was impressed by the sheer loyalty of these men and the Emperor stopped the other man from jumping. The experience convinced the Duke of the Emperor's power.&lt;ref&gt;Graeme 2003, pp. 157-163&lt;/ref&gt;

Most dangerous were his disputes with the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] in the course of the rebellion of the emperor's son [[Henry (VII) of Germany|Henry (VII)]], husband of Frederick's sister [[Margaret of Austria, Queen of Bohemia|Margaret]]. Not only had the duke refused to appear at the 1232 [[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|Reichstag]] diet in [[Aquileia]], appealing to the Austrian ''Privilegium Minus'' privileges, and displeased the emperor by picking quarrels with King [[Béla IV of Hungary]], he furthermore seemed to be involved in his brother-in-law Henry's conspiracy. When he again refused to attend the 1235 diet in [[Mainz]], Emperor Frederick II finally ostracized him and gave permission to King [[Wenceslaus I of Bohemia]] to invade the Austrian lands. [[Vienna]] opened its gates for the united Bohemian and Bavarian forces and during the years of Frederick's [[ban (law)|ban]] even became an [[Imperial Free City|imperial free city]], where the emperor had his son [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad IV]] elected [[King of the Romans]] in 1237. However, the expelled duke managed to maintain his position as the ruler of an Austrian rump state at his Wiener Neustadt residence. In the same year, Frederick enacted the ''Landrecht'' Law, which required all subjects to defend the country in the case of invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Gravett 1997, pp.13&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1239, in a spectacular change in imperial politics, Duke Frederick became one of the emperor's most important allies. In 1241, Duke Frederick was one of the very few Western European commanders who faced the Mongols during their [[Mongol invasion of Europe|invasion of Europe]]. When the Mongols started pillaging Hungary and Croatia, King [[Bela IV]] asked the papacy and the Western European rulers for help. Duke Frederick sent a very small expeditionary force of knights to assist the Hungarians. He and his knights managed to defeat a small Mongolian raiding party during the initial stages of the [[Battle of Mohi]], but they soon left after inter-conflicts with King Bela IV and the [[Cumans]] in the region. He would meet the Mongols again, this time in his own country. After the defeat of Hungary, the Mongols now set their sights on Vienna. A minor raiding squadron started pillaging [[Wiener Neustadt]] in Southern Vienna, but Duke Frederick together with his knights and foreign allies, defeated them and drove them out. The Austrians would again defeat the Mongols in the [[River March]] in [[Theben]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Peter. ''The Mongols and the West: 1221-1410''. Routledge; 1 edition (April 9, 2005). p. 67. {{ISBN|978-0582368965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howorth, Henry Hoyle. ''History of the Mongols from the 9th to the 19th Century: Part 1 the Mongols Proper and the Kalmyks''. Cosimo Classics (January 1, 2013). p. 152. {{ISBN|978-1605201337}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, the Mongols never again try to invade Austria.

The conflict with Bohemia was settled by the engagement of his niece [[Gertrude of Austria|Gertrude of Babenberg]] with King Wenceslaus' eldest son Margrave [[Vladislaus III of Moravia|Vladislaus of Moravia]]. Negotiations with the emperor about the elevation of Vienna to a bishopric and of Austria (including Styria) to a [[monarchy|kingdom]] were initiated, however, on condition that the duke's niece Gertrude now would have to marry the fifty-year-old emperor, who moreover had recently been banned by [[Pope Gregory IX]] and needed allies. In 1245 the terms were arranged, but the willful young girl, then in her late teens, refused to appear in the consummation ceremony at the diet of [[Verona]]. In the year before his death, Duke Frederick finally succeeded in gaining the rule over the March of Carniola from the [[Patria del Friuli|Patriarchate of Aquileia]], but upon his death it fell to the [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthian]] duke [[Bernhard von Spanheim]].

Duke Frederick's ambitious plans were dashed when he died at the [[Battle of the Leitha River]], in another border conflict he had picked with the Hungarian king Béla IV. He is buried at [[Heiligenkreuz Abbey]].

==Legacy==
[[File:Heiligenkreuz 7913.jpg|thumb|Frederick's tomb in the Heiligenkreuz chapter hall]]
As the Austrian ''Privilegium Minus'' of 1156 also allowed women to inherit, Frederick's sister [[Margaret of Austria, Queen of Bohemia|Margaret]] and his niece [[Gertrude of Austria|Gertrude]] would have been entitled to the throne. Shortly after the death of her uncle, Gertrude first married her fiancé Vladislaus of Moravia, who nevertheless died in the next year, then Margrave [[Herman VI, Margrave of Baden|Herman VI of Baden]], who did not manage to maintain his position in Austria, and finally in 1252 Prince [[Roman Danylovich]], a younger brother of Kynaz [[Lev I of Galicia|Lev I Rurik]], son-in-law of the Hungarian king, who also ended in divorce in 1253.

In the same year the Bohemian [[Přemyslid dynasty|Přemyslid]]s made a second attempt to confirm their claims to the Austrian and Styrian duchies by arranging the marriage between Gertrude's aunt Margaret of Babenberg and King Wenceslaus' son [[Ottokar II of Bohemia|Ottokar II]], more than twenty years her junior. Subsequently, Austria became a field of conflict between the Přemyslids and the Hungarian [[Árpád dynasty]], in which Ottokar at first would prevail defeating King Béla at the 1260 [[Battle of Kressenbrunn]], until finally being overthrown by the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] king [[Rudolf I of Germany]] at the [[Battle on the Marchfeld]] in 1278.

As the last Babenberg duke, Frederick the Quarrelsome signifies the end of an era in the [[history of Austria]], beginning with the enfeoffment of Margrave [[Leopold I, Margrave of Austria|Leopold I]] in 976. With his overambitious plans, which were frequently foiled by his erratic character, he somewhat resembled his later Habsburg successor Duke [[Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria|Rudolf IV]]. According to the 18th century historian [[Chrysostomus Hanthaler]], Frederick was the first Austrian duke utilizing the [[Flag of Austria|red-white-red]] coat of arms after his accession—an attempt to prevail against the reluctant local nobles and to stress his autonomy towards Emperor Frederick II. The triband is first documented in a seal on a deed issued on 30 November 1230, confirming the privileges of [[Lilienfeld Abbey]]. The medieval chronicler [[Jans der Enikel]] reports that the duke appeared in a red-white-red ceremonial dress at his 1232 [[accolade]] in the Vienna [[Schottenstift, Vienna|Schottenstift]].

'''George Adams''' (c. 1709&amp;ndash;1773) was an English instrument maker and science writer. His son [[George Adams (optician, younger)|George Adams]], who carried on the business, was also known as an instrument maker and optician.

==Life==
He was the eldest surviving son of Morris Adams, a cook, and his wife Mary, and was baptised in 1709. He was an apprentice to instrument makers, James Parker who died, and then Thomas Heath. He went into business in 1734, in [[Fleet Street]], London.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=49854|title=Adams family|first=John R.|last=Millburn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was indefinitely lent to the National Zoo as a companion for [[Dunk (elephant)|Dunk]] by the [[Adam Forepaugh]] [[Circus]].

On November 3, 1898, Gold Dust collapsed while walking to [[Rock Creek (Potomac River)|Rock Creek]] with his companion Dunk. Even with Dunk's assistance, he was unable to rise and died the following morning. A postmortem examination revealed that his intestines were inflamed and his teeth were in bad shape and could not close properly.

'''The Harris County Does''' consist of two currently unidentified youths discovered on January 12, 1981 in Houston, Harris County, Texas near Wallisville Road. Extensive investigation has been conducted with few leads.&lt;ref name=ncmec/&gt;

==Victims==

Both victims, a male and female, were found [[murder]]ed, approximately eight weeks to two months before, between November and December 1980.&lt;ref name=ncmec&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Doe 1981|url=http://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMU/1184342|website=missingkids.org|publisher=[[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]]|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=namusf/&gt;&lt;ref name=canyouidf&gt;{{cite web|title=Harris Texas Jane Doe January 1981|url=http://www.canyouidentifyme.org/HarrisTexasJaneDoeJanuary1981|website=canyouidentifyme.org|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although their weights were impossible to estimate and the faces were not recognizable due to decomposition, their [[fingerprint]]s, [[dentition|dental]] records and [[DNA]] were taken.&lt;ref name=namusf&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 701|url=https://identifyus.org/cases/701|website=identifyus.org|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons Database]]|accessdate=25 October 2014|date=15 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=canyouidm/&gt; Both of their bodies were hidden on private property in the woods around 100 yards from the road and later found by a dog.&lt;ref name="hope" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ncmec/&gt;&lt;ref name=namusf/&gt; They were both buried in indigent graves near to the then-unidentified [[murder of Michelle Garvey|Michelle Garvey]], who was later identified and transported to Connecticut in 2014.&lt;ref name=bone&gt;{{cite news|last1=Olsen|first1=Lise|title='Detective' will exhume bodies in victim identity hunt|url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Detective-will-exhume-bodies-in-victim-identity-1691577.php#ixzz1Nx3nb9AT|accessdate=8 December 2014|work=Houston Chronicle|date=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hope" /&gt;

===Female victim===

The female, who was [[White Americans|white]] with a possible [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]-[[Miscegenation|admixture]], was between the ages of eighteen and twenty five, although she may have been as young as fifteen.&lt;ref name=canyouidf/&gt; The cause of her death was ruled to be strangulation.&lt;ref name=betz1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Betz|first1=Dean|title=Cold cases: Details on 28 cold murder cases from 1952 to 1999|url=http://blog.chron.com/newswatch/2011/05/cold-cases-database/?appSession=65520750810396085794059232210142370687217307775633549589536034475383023035791506505497665530170006310369580557793064061265385052&amp;RecordID=6&amp;PageID=8&amp;PrevPageID=2&amp;cpipage=1&amp;CPIsortType=&amp;CPIorderBy=&amp;cbCurrentRecordPosition=6&amp;Mod0LinkToDetails=True|accessdate=23 December 2015|work=Houston Chronicle|publisher=[[Hearst Newspapers, LLC]]|date=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was estimated to have been around five feet four inches to five feet nine inches tall.

===Male victim===

The male was somewhat older, estimated to be twenty to thirty years old, although he could have been as young as fifteen.&lt;ref name=ncmec/&gt; Like the female, he was also white, had brown eyes and brown hair, although it was wavy and six inches long. The male was around five feet four to five feet eight inches tall at the time of his murder, which had been committed through beating.&lt;ref name=namusm/&gt;&lt;ref name=betz1/&gt; Unlike the female, he was bound and gagged.&lt;ref name="hope" /&gt; He had prominent [[eyebrow]]s and some deterioration of some of his upper [[vertebrae]] in the neck region, possibly the result of an injury in the past or the presence of an abnormal joint.&lt;ref name=canyouidm&gt;{{cite web|title=Harris Texas John Doe January 1981|url=http://canyouidentifyme.org/HarrisTexasJohnDoeJanuary1981|website=canyouidentifyme.org|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for dentals, one [[dental filling|filling]] was found in one of the [[molars]]; he also had restorations and his upper [[wisdom teeth]] were not found, as they may have been [[root canal|removed]] or they may not have developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File 753UMTX|url=http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/753umtx.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six missing men were ruled out as possible identities for the male victim.&lt;ref name=namusm&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 703|url=https://www.identifyus.org/en/cases/703|website=identifyus.org|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=25 October 2014|date=15 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Jerome Alexander''' (c.1585–1670) was an English-born [[barrister]], judge and politician who spent much of his career in [[Ireland]]  (after he had been professionally ruined in England)  and became a substantial Irish landowner. He was a noted benefactor of [[Trinity College Dublin]]. As a judge he was so ruthless in securing guilty verdicts, and in imposing the [[death penalty]], that for many years  after his  death  the saying "to be Alexandered" was an Irish [[synonym]] for being hanged.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, F. Elrington  ''The Judges in Ireland 1221–1921'' John Murray London 1926 Vol.1 p.282&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==

His  precise date of birth is uncertain, but he was stated in 1637 to be  several years older than Sir Maurice Eustace, who was born about 1590. He was born at [[Gressenhall]],  [[Norfolk]], the eldest son of Jerome Alexander senior of Thorpland, an employee of [[Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel]]; the younger Jerome was also employed for a time as steward and [[bailiff]]  to the Earl, and remained on friendly terms with him in later life. Elrington Ball  states that the Alexander family were   of [[Jewish]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;Ball p.348&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Aylsham]] school, and then  at  [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]], where he matriculated in 1609.&lt;ref&gt;''Biographical Dictionary of Gonville and Caius College 1349–1895''  (1897) Vol.1 p.203
&lt;/ref&gt; He entered [[Furnivall's Inn]] and then proceeded to [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1617, and was [[called to the bar]] in 1623.&lt;ref&gt;Ball p.348&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disgrace===

His  legal career  was destroyed  by a  finding of [[professional misconduct]] against him: unusually,  this did not arise from his services to a client. He was, unlike most barristers, very litigious on his own behalf, and in 1626 the [[Star Chamber]] found him guilty of [[tampering with evidence]] in one of his own lawsuits; he was [[disbarred]], fined and given a prison sentence. He moved to Ireland,  where he entered the [[King's Inn]] and began to  practice at the [[Irish Bar]]. It is unclear if the Benchers of the King's Inn were  then aware of his  criminal record; if not,  they certainly learned of it within   the next few years.  In 1633 he received a [[Royal pardon]], on  condition that he did not return to legal practice in England. In 1644 he published his ''Breviate'', a 100-page [[pamphlet]] in defence of his actions.&lt;ref&gt;Ball p.348&lt;/ref&gt; It gives a valuable,  if inevitably slanted picture of his early life, and describes all his misfortunes as being due to the machinations of his enemies (this was to   be a constant theme of Alexander's throughout his life).&lt;ref&gt;Ball p.266&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==

He entered politics, and sat in the [[Irish House of Commons]] as MP for [[Lifford (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Lifford]] in the [[Parliament of Ireland|Parliament]] of 1634–5 and that of 1639–49. He was a friend and client of the wealthy and influential young nobleman   [[James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde]], who granted him the impressive dwelling  [[Kilcooly Abbey]] in [[County Tipperary]]; he was also granted lands near [[Kells, County Meath]].&lt;ref&gt;Ball p.348&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also befriended by  other influential figures in Ireland, including [[James Ussher]], [[Archbishop of Armagh]]: but his hope of further  career advancement was destroyed by the arrival in Ireland of the new  [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]], [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford]], who despised Alexander and described him with contempt as "a scurvy [[puritan]]". Strafford,  who  became   almost all-powerful in Ireland,  and who was well aware that  Alexander had been  professionally  disgraced  in England,  vetoed his appointment as an extra judge of [[assize]] in 1637: &lt;ref&gt;Hart, A. R. ''History of the King's Serjeants-at-law in Ireland''  Dublin Four Courts Press 2000  pp.50-51 &lt;/ref&gt;the ostensible reason  was  that only Sir [[Maurice Eustace (Lord Chancellor)|Maurice Eustace]],  the [[Serjeant-at-law (Ireland)|King's Serjeant]] was qualified to act as an extra judge, but  Strafford's  references to Eustace as a "man of integrity"  can also  be read as  an attack on Alexander's character.&lt;ref&gt;Hart pp.50-51&lt;/ref&gt; He refused him leave to go to England, and when  Alexander went to England  anyway he was imprisoned in the [[Fleet Prison]], nor following  his release was he able to return to Ireland until after Strafford's downfall.  Given the enmity between the two men, it is not surprising that Alexander was active in the [[impeachment]]   of Strafford in 1641.&lt;ref&gt;Ball p.348&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KilcooleyTower2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Kilcooley Abbey]], which was granted to  Alexander.]]

==Civil War==

He returned briefly to Ireland after Strafford's death,  but on the outbreak of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]]  went back to England. He was an active [[Royalist]], and attempted to  raise troops to subdue Ireland; at the same time he was among those who urged [[Charles I of England|the King]], if necessary, to make an alliance with [[Confederate Ireland|the Irish Confederacy]]. For  attempting to arrange such an alliance  he was briefly imprisoned by Parliament in 1643, and on his release  he went abroad.  He was in the service of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] at the [[Hague]] in 1650, and was active in raising money for his cause, but  he returned to Ireland in 1655.&lt;ref&gt;Ball p.348&lt;/ref&gt; He made his peace with the new regime, and acquired an estate in [[County Westmeath]]; but in view of the rewards he received in 1660, (even if they were not overly generous), there is no reason to doubt that he remained a Royalist at heart.&lt;ref&gt;Ball p.279&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration==

At the [[Restoration of Charles II]], Alexander claimed to have played a major part in securing the support of the Irish Government for the new regime (in fact there was virtually  no opposition in Ireland to the Restoration),  and  he complained at length about the great losses he had suffered during the [[Interregnum (1649-1660)|Interregnum]].  He was rewarded with a [[knighthood]] and a place on the [[Court of Common Pleas (Ireland)]], no doubt largely though the influence of the Duke of  Ormonde,  who had the last word on appointments to the Irish Bench at the Restoration,  and was always loyal  (some thought  overly  so)  to old friends like Alexander. Nonetheless Alexander  was plainly dissatisfied at ranking only as second justice of the Court: he claimed that he should have been given the office of [[Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas]], and quarreled with Sir [[William Aston (Irish judge)|William Aston]], justice  of the [[Court of King's Bench (Ireland)]] over which of them had precedence. Rumour  had it that he challenged Aston to a [[duel]] on the issue, but to Alexander's  disgust Aston refused the challenge.&lt;ref&gt;Ball p.279&lt;/ref&gt; He also acted as legal adviser to the future King [[James II]] on his Irish affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Ball p.349&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judge==

He was a stern enforcer of religious conformity: in his [[will (law)|will]] he refers to the [[Church of England]] as "the best form of Government in all this world".  On the [[Ulster]] circuit, to which he was regularly assigned,  he became noted for severity against non-conforming Protestants: his ally [[John Bramhall]], [[Bishop of Derry]] wrote that if the non-conformists "could not love him, they began to fear him".&lt;ref&gt;Ball pp.282–3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious beliefs  and attitudes===

It has been suggested that he had an equally harsh attitude towards  [[Roman Catholics]], but that he  was unable to show similar severity towards them, due to the relaxed attitude of  the Duke of Ormonde, now Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Ormonde  recognised that since Catholics were a large majority of the  Irish population, a generous if  unofficial  measure of  toleration of that faith was inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, J.P.  ''The Popish Plot''  Phoenix Press reissue 2000 p.224&lt;/ref&gt; However   Alexander's attitude to Roman Catholics was perhaps more complex than this:  he was, for example, on friendly terms with the well-known Catholic barrister [[Patrick D'Arcy]], who  offered to act as his second in the  abortive duel with Sir William  Aston.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Oliver  ''Anecdotes of the Connaught Circuit''   Hodges Figgis Dublin 1885 p.64&lt;/ref&gt;  Through marriage Alexander himself had Catholic connections: his wife Elizabeth Havers belonged to  a staunchly  Roman Catholic family [http://www.catholic-history.org.uk/cfhs/catholic_ancestor_20130203.htm#V7].  Her ancestor  Mr Havers of Thelton Hall built a chapel on the grounds of Thelton Hall which became the hub of the Catholic community in and around Diss, Norfolk, before during and after the oppression. Elizabeth's elder brother William Havers, who inherited  Thelton  in  1651, and who died in  1670, was a known  [[Recusancy|recusant]]. This  suggests  that Alexander, like many  Protestants of his  time, was prepared to turn a blind eye to recusancy when it was  practiced by his  own  friends or relatives, and even to marry into an openly  Catholic family himself.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Kenyon ''Popish Plot'' p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Alexandered"==
The Duke of Ormonde, who was a merciful man by the standards of the time,  is known to have disapproved of Alexander's notorious severity in criminal trials. This attitude   was in notable contrast to the conduct of most other Irish judges of the time who were, like Ormonde, inclined to clemency. Where Ormonde would always reprieve a man  where he could, Alexander, it was said, would hang as many  men as ''he'' could : on one occasion  he sentenced  fourteen men to death at a single assize. His reputation  for severity became such that for many years after his death "to be '''Alexandered"''' was widely used in Ireland as a synonym for  "to be hanged".&lt;ref&gt;Ball p.282&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and will==

He died in the summer of 1670, and was buried in [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin]]. Much of his property, including Kilcooley Abbey, passed to his daughter Elizabeth, on condition that she did not marry an Irishman (she did not); he also  left £100 to each of  the  three children of his eldest  surviving daughter Jeromina Langham.    His law books and other texts he left to Trinity College Dublin, with enough money to pay for a librarian,&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, Colum   ''King's Inns and the Kingdom of Ireland''  Irish Academic Press Dublin 1992 p.193&lt;/ref&gt; (the King's Inns, of which he was a senior member, had no facilities for storing books at the time, and had to wait till 1788 for the foundation of its own library).&lt;ref&gt;Kenny p.193&lt;/ref&gt; His friend Sir [[Edward Massey]] received many of his personal valuables and curiosities, such as "my cane with the silver head of a [[rhinoceros]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ball pp.284–5&lt;/ref&gt; As he had already done  in his ''Breviate'', he dwelt in his will  on the machinations of his enemies, and rejoiced that God's grace had enabled him to triumph over them. More humanely,  he noted that God in return required him to help the  poor and needy.&lt;ref&gt;Ball p.284&lt;/ref&gt;

Ball suggests that he would have been most unhappy had he known that his place on the Bench would be taken by [[Oliver Jones (judge)|Oliver Jones]],  who was noted  for his impartiality towards Roman Catholics, and was widely suspected of being a secret Catholic himself. However it seems that Alexander, whose wife was a member of  a notable   Roman Catholic family,  may have been more tolerant of the Catholic faith  in private than his severe public stance suggested .&lt;ref&gt;Ball p.286&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

Alexander married Elizabeth Havers,&lt;ref&gt;The Will, dated 1651,  of John Havers of Shelfanger, names his daughter Elizabeth Alexander and his son in Law, Jerome Alexander&lt;/ref&gt; a daughter of John Havers of Shelfhanger,  a noted recusant, who like Alexander's father was an  employee of the Earl of Arundel,  and his wife Elizabeth Tindal of Banham; she died in 1667.&lt;ref&gt;Cokayne  ''The Complete Baronetage'' Reprinted Gloucester 1983 Vol. IV p.74&lt;/ref&gt; They had  sixteen children, many  of whom died young; but at  least three  of his daughters survived their father:

*Jeromina, who married Humphrey Langham, and had  at least  five children;
*Rose, who married firstly Roger Mallock of Cockington, [[Devon]], and secondly [[Thomas Gorges (Maine)|Thomas Gorges]], Deputy Governor of [[Maine]], and died in 1671, leaving a son and a daughter;
*Elizabeth, who heeded her father's warning  that he would disinherit her if she married an Irishman,   and instead married an Englishman, Sir William Barker, first of the [[Barker baronets]] of Bocking Hall, [[Essex]]. She   died in 1702, leaving issue, including Sir William Barker, 2nd Baronet.&lt;ref&gt;Cokayne p.74&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality==

Elrington Ball describes Alexander  as a "strongly complex character".&lt;ref&gt;Ball p.284&lt;/ref&gt; He was a bitter enemy but a good friend; he was merciless towards criminals,  but  charitable towards the poor.  Throughout his life he was inclined to blame his misfortunes on the machinations of his enemies, even those disasters which to any detached observer would seem to be entirely his own fault.  As a young [[barrister]] he was found guilty of misconduct, but as a judge prided himself on not taking bribes.&lt;ref&gt;Ball p.283&lt;/ref&gt; He publicly called for the  persecution of Roman Catholics, but married into an openly Catholic family. Burke called him a man of strong passions, but also a man of great integrity and public spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Burke  ''Anecdotes'' p.64&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published works==
*''A Breviate of a sentence given against Jerome Alexander, utter-barrister of Lincoln's Inn, in the Court of Star Chamber... with exceptions taken to the said sentence to unfold the iniquity thereof."   Published in [[London]]   in 1644.&lt;ref&gt;Ball p.266&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph "Joe" Barker''' (ca. 1806– August 2, 1862) &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~njm1/10-ALLEGHENY%20BUTLER%20ST.-SEC.%2029,%20LOT%20196-BARKER,%20JOSEPH%20AND%20JANE.JPG|title = Epitaph|date = August 2, 1862|accessdate = January 10, 2016|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American public and political figure of the 1800s remembered to this day for his rash, uncompromising temper, and violent tirades against corruption, often drawing large crowds, landing him in prison, and paving way for his term in office as the 17th mayor of [[Pittsburgh]].

==Early years==
The origins of Joe Barker are shrouded in mystery: nothing is known of his early years, background, or even his date of birth, as evident by its absence on his [[epitaph]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Portrait_of_Mayor_Joseph_Barker.jpg]]

== Appearance ==
Barker's appearance, in contrast to what was common of the era, was described as always cleanly shaven and well-dressed in nearly all black attire. It was said of him never to be seen without a neckcloth, black stovepipe hat, and long black cape.

== 1850 Census ==
Important, although sparse, details are provided in the information collected by the [[United States Census, 1850|Census of 1850]]. Barker is listed therein as 44 years old and living in Pittsburgh's Fifth [[Wards of the United States|Ward]] with his Irish-born wife Jane Holmes and three children, Charles Augustus, Eliza, and David. His birthplace is described as being in "Pennsylvania", and his occupation is given as "Mayor".  Contrary to propaganda spread by his enemies, and even incorrectly referenced in articles to this day, Barker was far from illiterate, as clearly indicated on the 1850 census; he was instead described as having a silver tongue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/census/census_driver.pl?searchtype=full_record&amp;key=25658&amp;database=Pittsburgh_1850|title=Historic Pittsburgh - Census 1850|website=digital.library.pitt.edu|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a perhaps sardonic nod to his opposition, Barker chose to leave the "sane" category on the census unchecked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/census/census_driver.pl?searchtype=full_record&amp;key=25658&amp;database=Pittsburgh_1850|title=Historic Pittsburgh - Census 1850|website=digital.library.pitt.edu|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arrest, Imprisonment, and Election ==
Joe Barker gained vast public attention and notoriety as a [[street preacher]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;of the violent class, vehemently attacking political corruption. In November 1849, a riot broke out following one of Barker's more extreme tirades in [[Market Square (Pittsburgh)|Market Square]], Mayor [[John Herron (Pittsburgh)|John Herron]] had him arrested on three counts:
* Inciting a riot
* Obstructing traffic
* Using lewd and indecent language in the delivery of incendiary threats&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title="The Commonwealth v Barker et al."|last=|first=|date=20 November 1849|work=Pittsburgh Daily Post|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publication-place=Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On November 19 the charges resulted in a fine and 12-month jail sentence, but Barker did not exactly display remorse, stating, "''Judge Patton made a threat two weeks ago of what he would do if I was thrown into his power. Now let him touch me if he dares. I'll hang him to a lamppost if he lays a finger on me''."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The next mayoral election was fast approaching, and Barker's nativist supporters circulated a [[write-in candidate|write-in petition]] during his imprisonment which resulted in his election as mayor to succeed Herron. Accounts of Barker's one-year 1850&amp;ndash;51 term describe it as a period of religious and nativist strife.

== Death ==
Barker lived for eleven years after leaving the mayoralty and despite a number of additional attempts, never again held public office. He was in his mid-fifties at the time of his decapitation in a train accident in the neighboring town of [[Manchester (Pittsburgh)|Manchester]] (a part of Pittsburgh since 1908). Interment was in [[Allegheny Cemetery]].

'''Lionel Alexander Tate''' (born January 30, 1987)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dc.state.fl.us/ActiveInmates/inmateaction.asp?DataAction=GetInmate&amp;DCNumber=L24475 Inmate Population Information Detail&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; is the youngest American citizen ever sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] without possibility of [[parole]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lionel-tate-gets-30-years-in-jail/&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2001, when Tate was 13, he was convicted of first-degree [[murder]] for the 1999 battering death of 6-year-old Tiffany Eunick in [[Broward County, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/10/us/sentence-of-life-without-parole-for-boy-14-in-murder-of-girl-6.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder==
On July 28, 1999 Tate was left alone with Eunick, who was being babysat by Tate's mother, Kathleen Grossett-Tate. While the children were downstairs playing, Tate's mother called to them to be quiet. Tate came up 45 minutes later to say that Eunick was not breathing. He stated that they were wrestling, he had her in a head lock and the child's head hit a table.

===Conviction===
Tate was convicted of killing Eunick by stomping on her so forcefully that her liver was lacerated.&lt;ref name="LiverLacerated"&gt;Abby Goodnough, "Youngster Given Life Term For Killing Gets New Trial," The New York Times, December 11, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Her other injuries included a fractured skull, fractured rib and swollen brain. These injuries were characterized by the prosecution as "similar to those she would have sustained by falling from a three-story building."&lt;ref name="ThreeStoryFall"&gt;Dana Canedy, "Boy Convicted of Murder in Wrestling Death," The New York Times, January 5, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In sentencing Tate to life imprisonment, Judge [[Joel T. Lazarus]] of Broward County Circuit Court said that "The acts of Lionel Tate were not the playful acts of a child [...] The acts of Lionel Tate were cold, callous and indescribably cruel."&lt;ref name="NatureOfAttacks"&gt;Dana Canedy, " Sentence of Life Without Parole For Boy, 13, in Murder of Girl, 6 ," The New York Times, March 10, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

====Felony murder rule ====
Florida Statutes required the jury to convict Tate of first-degree murder even if the jury did not believe that he intended to kill or injure anyone—all that was required was that Tate knowingly abused another child who died as a result (wherein any intentional act that could reasonably be expected to result in physical injury to a child is ''child abuse'' per Florida statutes).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0700-0799/0782/Sections/0782.04.html Statutes &amp; Constitution :View Statutes : Online Sunshine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0800-0899/0827/Sections/0827.03.html Statutes &amp; Constitution :View Statutes : Online Sunshine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0700-0799/0784/Sections/0784.045.html Statutes &amp; Constitution :View Statutes : Online Sunshine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule for such convictions is known as the [[Felony murder rule (Florida)|felony murder rule]]. The sufficient conditions of the felony murder rule were listed by the judge [[Joel T. Lazarus]] during sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0103/09/se.04.html Wrestling Death: Judge Sentences Lionel Tate, 14, to Life in Prison]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus Tate was sentenced to life in prison without the prosecution having to prove that he intended to kill or injure, or realized that his acts are likely to kill or injure, or even that a typical child of his age would or should realize this.

Critics, such as the various groups listed in the Amicus Brief attached to Tate's appeal, assert that convicting preteen children of 1st-degree murder without having to prove these children intended any harm, not to mention serious injury or death, is unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.ufl.edu/centers/childlaw/pdf/tate.pdf STATE OF FLORIDA IN THE FOURTH DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL Case No. 4D01-1306] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702183114/http://www.law.ufl.edu/centers/childlaw/pdf/tate.pdf |date=July 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2001-05-14/news/0105130340_1_felony-murder-rule-felony-murder-rule-prosecutors Rule Should Not Apply To Children]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sentence===
The sentence was controversial because Tate was 12 years old at the time of the death, and his victim was 6. He was the youngest person in modern US history to be sentenced to life imprisonment,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lionel-tate-gets-30-years-in-jail/&lt;/ref&gt; bringing broad criticism on the treatment of [[Juvenile delinquency|juvenile offender]]s in the justice system of the [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Florida]].

===Original sentence overturned===
After the conviction, the prosecution openly joined Tate's plea for leniency in sentencing, and even offered to help in his appeal. The trial judge criticized the prosecution for compromising the integrity of the [[adversarial system]], and said that if the prosecution felt that life imprisonment was not warranted, they should not have charged him with murder in the first place.

In January 2004, a state appeals court overturned his conviction on the basis that his mental [[Competency evaluation (law)|competency had not been evaluated]] before trial. This opened the way for Tate to accept the same plea deal he originally turned down, and he was released on one year's [[house arrest]] and 10 years' [[probation]].

==Probation violation==
On September 3, 2004, Tate was detained and held in prison for violating the terms of his house arrest when he was found out of his house and carrying an eight-inch knife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/free-lionel-tate-6377917 Free Lionel Tate | Miami New Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Armed robbery arrest and subsequent plea bargain==
On May 23, 2005, Tate was charged with armed burglary with battery, armed robbery and [[Probation violation|violation of probation]], the [[Broward County Sheriff's Office]] said.

Tate threatened [[Domino's Pizza]] deliveryman Walter Ernest Gallardo with a handgun outside a friend's apartment after phoning in an order. Gallardo dropped the four [[pizza]]s and fled the scene. Tate then re-entered the apartment, assaulting the occupant who did not want Tate inside.

Gallardo called [[9-1-1]] upon reaching the Domino's store and returned to identify Tate, the sheriff's office said in a statement. No gun was recovered.

On March 1, 2006, Tate accepted a plea bargain and was to be sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment in a sentencing hearing in April 2006. Tate admitted that he had violated probation by possessing a gun during the May 23 robbery that netted four pizzas worth $33.60, but he has refused to answer questions about where he got it and later disposed of the gun. He was allowed to withdraw his guilty plea for robbery, but was finally sentenced to 30 years in prison on May 18, 2006 for violating probation. On October 24, 2007, Florida's 4th District Court of Appeal upheld that sentence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003975547_ndig26.html Court upholds sentence for Tate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418132033/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003975547_ndig26.html |date=2009-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 19, 2008, Tate pleaded [[Nolo contendere|no contest]] to the pizza robbery and was sentenced to 10 years in state prison. The sentence will run concurrently with his 30-year sentence for violating his probation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamiherald.com/top_stories/story/425954.html]{{dead link|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Henry Harrison]] holds the record for shortest term served, holding the office of presidency for 31 days before his death.

==1841: William Henry Harrison==

On March 26, 1841, [[William Henry Harrison]] became ill with a cold. According to the prevailing medical misconception of that time, it was believed that his illness was directly caused by the bad weather at his inauguration; however, Harrison's illness did not arise until more than three weeks after the event. The cold worsened, rapidly turning to [[pneumonia]] and [[pleurisy]].&lt;ref&gt;Cleaves 152&lt;/ref&gt; He sought to rest in the White House, but could not find a quiet room because of the steady crowd of office seekers. His extremely busy social schedule made any rest time scarce.&lt;ref name="loc"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrison's doctors tried cures, applying [[opium]], [[castor oil]], [[leeches]], and [[Aristolochia serpentaria|Virginia snakeroot]]. But the treatments only made Harrison worse, and he became delirious. He died nine days after becoming ill,&lt;ref&gt;Cleaves 160&lt;/ref&gt; at 12:30&amp;nbsp;am on April 4, 1841, of right lower lobe [[pneumonia]], [[jaundice]], and overwhelming [[septicemia]]. He was the first United States president to die in office. His last words were to his doctor, but assumed to be directed at Vice President [[John Tyler]], "Sir, I wish you to understand the true principles of the government. I wish them carried out. I ask nothing more." Harrison served the shortest term of any American president: March 4&amp;nbsp;– April 4, 1841, 30 days, 12 hours, and 30 minutes.&lt;ref name="dyingstmt"&gt;{{cite web

On July 4, 1850, Taylor was known to have consumed copious amounts of ice water, cold milk, green apples, and cherries after attending holiday celebrations and the laying of the cornerstone of the [[Washington Monument]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Eisenhower | first1 = John S.D. | title = Zachary Taylor The American Presidents | publisher = Macmillan | year = 2008 | pages = 132–3 | isbn = 978-0805082371}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same evening, he became severely ill with an unknown digestive ailment.

Taylor died in the White House at 10:35&amp;nbsp;p.m. on July 9, five days after becoming ill.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, pp. 314–316.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary reports listed the cause of death as "[[bilious diarrhea]], or a bilious cholera".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Death of the President of the United States|accessdate=October 17, 2011|newspaper=Boston Daily Evening Transcript |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=730-AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yFkMAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=zachary%20taylor%20dead&amp;pg=6596%2C286648 |date=July 10, 1850}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by Vice President [[Millard Fillmore]].

The assassination occurred five days after the commanding [[General]] of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]], [[Robert E. Lee]], surrendered to [[General]] [[Ulysses S.

The assassination of Lincoln was planned and carried out by the well-known stage actor [[John Wilkes Booth]], a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sympathizer, vehement in his denunciation of Lincoln, and a strong opponent of the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]] of [[slavery in the United States]].&lt;ref name="NYTltr"&gt;{{cite news|title=The murderer of Mr. Lincoln|work=The New York Times|date=April 21, 1865|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1865/04/21/78997175.pdf | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Booth and a group of co-conspirators originally plotted to kidnap Lincoln, but later planned to kill him, [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Andrew Johnson]], and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William H.

{{main|Assassination of James A. Garfield}}
The [[assassination]] of [[James A. Garfield]] took place in [[Washington, D.C.]] on July 2, 1881. Garfield was shot by [[Charles J. Guiteau]] at 9:30&amp;nbsp;am, less than four months into Garfield's term as the 20th [[President of the United States]]. Garfield died eleven weeks later on September 19, 1881. His [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], [[Chester A. Arthur]], succeeded Garfield as President. Garfield also lived the longest after the shooting, compared to other assassinated Presidents. Garfield was scheduled to leave Washington on July 2, 1881 for his summer vacation.&lt;ref&gt;Peskin 581&lt;/ref&gt; On that day, Guiteau lay in wait for the President at the [[Baltimore and Potomac Railroad]] station, on the southwest corner of present-day Sixth Street and Constitution Avenue NW, [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name="Conwell"&gt;{{cite book | author=George Stinson Conwell | title=The life, speeches, and public services of James A. Garfield, twentieth President of the United States : including an account of his assassination, lingering pain, death and burial | location=Portland, Maine | oclc=2087548 | pages=349 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Garfield came to the Sixth Street Station on his way to his [[alma mater]], [[Williams College]], where he was scheduled to deliver a speech. Garfield was accompanied by two of his sons, [[James Rudolph Garfield|James]] and [[Harry Augustus Garfield|Harry]], and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[James G. Blaine|Blaine]]. [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Robert Todd Lincoln]] waited at the station to see the President off.&lt;ref name="Vowell 160"&gt;Vowell 160&lt;/ref&gt; Garfield had no bodyguard or security detail; with the exception of Abraham Lincoln during the [[United States Civil War|Civil War]], early U.S. presidents never used any guards.&lt;ref name="Peskin 593"&gt;Peskin 593&lt;/ref&gt;

As President Garfield entered the waiting room of the station Guiteau stepped forward and pulled the trigger from behind at point-blank range. "My God, what is that?" Garfield cried out, flinging up his arms. Guiteau fired again and Garfield collapsed.&lt;ref name="Peskin 596"&gt;Peskin 596&lt;/ref&gt; One bullet grazed Garfield's shoulder; the other hit him in the back, passing the first [[Lumbar vertebrae|lumbar vertebra]] but missing the [[spinal cord]] before coming to rest behind his pancreas.&lt;ref&gt;Millard 189, 312&lt;/ref&gt;

Garfield, conscious but in shock, was carried to an upstairs floor of the train station.&lt;ref&gt;Peskin 596–597&lt;/ref&gt; One bullet remained lodged in his body, but doctors could not find it.&lt;ref name="Peskin 597"&gt;Peskin 597&lt;/ref&gt; Young Jim Garfield and James Blaine both broke down and wept. Robert Todd Lincoln, deeply upset and thinking back to the death of his father, said "How many hours of sorrow I have passed in this town."&lt;ref name="Peskin 597" /&gt;

Garfield was carried back to the White House. Although doctors told him that he would not survive the night, the President remained conscious and alert.&lt;ref&gt;Peskin 598&lt;/ref&gt; The next morning his vital signs were good and doctors began to hope for recovery.&lt;ref&gt;Peskin 599&lt;/ref&gt; A long vigil began, with Garfield's doctors issuing regular bulletins that the American public followed closely throughout the summer of 1881.&lt;ref&gt;Peskin 600&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vowell 124&lt;/ref&gt; His condition fluctuated. Fevers came and went. Garfield struggled to keep down solid food and spent most of the summer eating little, and that only liquids.&lt;ref&gt;Peskin 601&lt;/ref&gt;

Garfield had been a regular visitor to the shore town of [[Long Branch, New Jersey]], one of the nation's premier summer vacation spots until World War I. In early September, it was decided to bring him to [[Elberon, New Jersey|Elberon]], a quiet beach town just to the south of Long Branch, in hopes that the beach air would help him recover. When they heard that the president was being brought to their town, local citizens built more than half a mile of tracks in less than 24 hours, enabling Garfield to be brought directly to the door of the oceanfront Franklyn cottage, rather than being moved by carriage from the local Elberon train station. However, Garfield died 12 days later. A granite marker on Garfield Rd identifies the former site of the cottage, which was demolished in 1950.

Chester Arthur was at his home in New York City on the night of September 19, when word came that Garfield had died. After first getting the news, Arthur said "I hope—my God, I do hope it is a mistake." But confirmation by telegram came soon after. Arthur took the presidential oath of office, administered by a [[New York Supreme Court]] judge, then left for Long Branch to pay his respects before traveling on to Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Peskin 608&lt;/ref&gt; Garfield's body was taken to Washington, where it lay in state for two days in the Capitol Rotunda before being taken to Cleveland, where the funeral was held on September 26.&lt;ref&gt;Peskin 608–609&lt;/ref&gt;

When the tracks that had been hastily built to the Franklyn cottage were later torn up, actor Oliver Byron bought the wooden ties, and had local carpenter William Presley build them into a small tea house, in commemoration of the president. The red &amp; white (originally red, white &amp; blue) "Garfield Tea House" still survives, resting a couple of blocks away from the site of the cottage on the grounds of the Long Branch Historical Museum, a former Episcopal Church. The church is nicknamed "The Church of the Presidents", as it had been attended by, in addition to Garfield, Presidents Chester A. Arthur, Ulysses S. Grant, Benjamin Harrison, Rutherford Hayes, William McKinley, and Woodrow Wilson, during their own visits to Long Branch.

==1901: William McKinley==

{{main|Assassination of William McKinley}}
[[William McKinley]] was assassinated on September 6, 1901, inside the [[Temple of Music]] on the grounds of the [[Pan-American Exposition]] in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], New York. [[William McKinley|McKinley]] was shaking hands with the public when he was shot by [[Leon Czolgosz]], an [[Anarchism|anarchist]]. The President died eight days later on September 14 from [[gangrene]] caused by the bullet wounds.&lt;ref name=McKinley&gt;Leech 594-600&lt;/ref&gt;

McKinley had been [[United States presidential election, 1900|elected for a second term in 1900]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Cortelyou]], feared an [[assassination]] attempt would take place during a visit to the Temple of Music, and twice took it off the schedule.  McKinley restored it each time.&lt;ref&gt;Leech 584&lt;/ref&gt;

Czolgosz had lost his job during the economic [[Panic of 1893]] and turned to anarchism, a political philosophy whose adherents had killed foreign leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 56-60&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding McKinley as a symbol of oppression, Czolgosz felt it was his duty as an anarchist to kill him.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 301–302&lt;/ref&gt;   Unable to get near McKinley during the earlier part of the presidential visit, Czolgosz shot McKinley twice as the President reached to shake his hand in the reception line at the temple. One bullet grazed McKinley; the other entered his abdomen and was never found.&lt;ref name=McKinley/&gt;

McKinley initially appeared to be recovering, but took a turn for the worse on September 13 as his wounds became gangrenous, and died early the next morning; [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] succeeded him. Roosevelt was hiking near the top of [[Mt. Marcy]], in New York State's [[Adirondacks|Adirondack]] region, when a runner located him to convey the news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==1923: Warren G. Harding==
[[Image:HardingFuneral.jpg|thumb|alt=A black-and-white photograph of a procession of people in uniforms, some of whom are riding horses, all standing in front of a white building|Funeral procession for President Harding passes by the front of the [[White House]]]]
[[Warren G. Harding]] died from a sudden heart attack in his hotel suite while visiting [[San Francisco]] at around 7:35 p.m. on August 2, 1923. His death quickly led to theories that he had been poisoned&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnsspectrums.com/aspx/articledetail.aspx?articleid=605|title=Presidential Stroke: United States Presidents and Cerebrovascular Disease (Warren G. Harding) |author=Jeffrey M. Jones |author2=Joni L. Jones |work=CNS Spectrums |accessdate=July 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or committed suicide. Rumors of poisoning were fueled, in part, by a book called ''The Strange Death of President Harding,'' in which the author (convicted criminal, former Ohio Gang member, and detective [[Gaston Means]], hired by Mrs. Harding to investigate Warren Harding and his mistress) suggested that Mrs. Harding had poisoned her husband after learning of his infidelity. Mrs. Harding's refusal to allow an autopsy on President Harding only added to the speculation. According to the physicians attending Harding, however, the symptoms in the days prior to his death all pointed to [[congestive heart failure]]. Harding's biographer, Samuel H. Adams, concluded that "Warren G. Harding died a natural death which, in any case, could not have been long postponed".&lt;ref&gt;Adams (1939, 1964), ''Incredible Era'', pp. 377–384&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after President Harding's death, Mrs. Harding returned to [[Washington, D.C.]], and briefly stayed in the White House with the new President [[Calvin Coolidge]] and First Lady.  For a month, former First Lady Harding gathered and destroyed by fire President Harding's correspondence and documents, both official and unofficial. Upon her return to [[Marion, Ohio]], Mrs. Harding hired a number of secretaries to collect and burn President Harding's personal papers. According to Mrs. Harding, she took these actions to protect her husband's legacy. The remaining papers were held and kept from public view by the ''Harding Memorial Association'' in Marion.&lt;ref&gt;Russell (April 1963), ''The Four Mysteries Of Warren Harding''&lt;/ref&gt;

==1945: Franklin D. Roosevelt==
On March 29, 1945, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] went to the [[Little White House]] in [[Warm Springs, Georgia]], to rest before his anticipated appearance at the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization|founding conference]] of the [[United Nations]] in late April in San Francisco. On the afternoon of April 12, Roosevelt said, "I have a terrific pain in the back of my head." He then slumped forward in his chair, unconscious, and was carried into his bedroom. The president's attending cardiologist, Dr. Howard Bruenn, diagnosed a massive [[cerebral hemorrhage]] (stroke).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cnsspectrums.com/aspx/articledetail.aspx?articleid=605|title=Presidential Stroke: United States Presidents and Cerebrovascular Disease (Franklin D. Roosevelt)| first=Jeffrey M.|last=Jones |author2=Joni L. Jones |work=CNS Spectrums |accessdate= July 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 3:35&amp;nbsp;pm that day, Roosevelt died without regaining consciousness. As [[Allen Drury]] later said, "so ended an era, and so began another." After Roosevelt's death, an editorial by ''The New York Times'' declared, "Men will thank God on their knees a hundred years from now that Franklin D. Roosevelt was in the White House".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Person of the Century Runner-Up: Franklin Delano Roosevelt|publisher=Time|url=http://www.time.com/time/time100/poc/magazine/franklin_delano_rooseve9a.html|accessdate=October 9, 2008|date=March 1, 2000|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091110120453/http://www.time.com/time/time100/poc/magazine/franklin_delano_rooseve9a.html|archivedate=November 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his later years at the White House, when Roosevelt was increasingly overworked, his daughter [[Anna E. Roosevelt|Anna Roosevelt Boettiger]] had moved in to provide her father companionship and support. Anna had also arranged for her father to meet with his former mistress, the now widowed [[Lucy Page Mercer Rutherfurd|Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd]]. A close friend of both Roosevelt and Mercer who was present, [[Elizabeth Shoumatoff]], rushed Mercer away to avoid negative publicity and implications of infidelity. When Eleanor heard about her husband's death, she was also faced with the news that Anna had been arranging these meetings with Mercer and that Mercer had been with Franklin when he died.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Companion to Franklin D. Roosevelt|author=William D. Pederson|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=2011|isbn=1444395173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of April 13, Roosevelt's body was placed in a flag-draped coffin and loaded onto the presidential train. After a White House funeral on April 14, Roosevelt was transported back to Hyde Park by train, guarded by four servicemen, one each from the Army, Navy, Marines, and Coast Guard. As was his wish, Roosevelt was buried in the Rose Garden of the [[Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site|Springwood estate]], the Roosevelt family home in Hyde Park on April 15. Eleanor died in November 1962 and was buried next to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|page=999|title=Roosevelt, Eleanor|author=Margaret Prentice Hecker|journal=Encyclopedia of African American History|volume=1|editor=Leslie Alexander|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2010|isbn=1851097694}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roosevelt's death was met with shock and grief&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|year=1945|title=Video: Allies Overrun Germany (1945)|url=https://archive.org/details/gov.archives.arc.39165|publisher=[[Universal Newsreel]]|accessdate=February 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; across the U.S. and around the world. His declining health had not been known to the general public. Roosevelt had been president for more than 12 years, longer than any other person, and had led the country through some of its greatest crises to the impending defeat of Nazi Germany and within sight of the defeat of Japan as well.

Less than a month after his death, on May 8, the war in Europe ended. President [[Harry S. Truman]], who turned 61 that day, dedicated [[Victory in Europe Day]] and its celebrations to Roosevelt's memory, and kept the flags across the U.S. at half-staff for the remainder of the 30-day mourning period. In doing so, Truman said that his only wish was "that Franklin D. Roosevelt had lived to witness this day."&lt;ref&gt;McCullough 345, 381&lt;/ref&gt;

==1963: John F. Kennedy==
[[File:John F. Kennedy motorcade, Dallas crop.png|thumb|JFK, Jackie, and the Connallys in the presidential limousine minutes before the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]]]]
{{main|Assassination of John F. Kennedy}}
[[John F. Kennedy]] was assassinated at 12:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. Central Standard Time (18:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on Friday, November 22, 1963, in [[Dealey Plaza]], [[Dallas]], Texas.&lt;ref name="aarclibrary.org"&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh4/html/WC_Vol4_0078a.htm Warren Commission Testimony of Nellie Connally], vol. 4, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh4/html/WC_Vol4_0070a.htm Warren Commission Testimony of John B.

The ten-month investigation by the [[Warren Commission]] of 1963–1964 concluded that President Kennedy was assassinated by [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] and that Oswald had acted entirely alone. It also concluded that [[Jack Ruby]] acted alone when he killed Oswald in police custody. Nonetheless, polls conducted from 1966 to 2004 found that as many as 80 percent of Americans have suspected that there was a plot or [[cover-up]].&lt;ref name="langer20031116"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/images/pdf/937a1JFKAssassination.pdf|author=Gary Langer|title=John F.

Most current [[John F.

=== Tuscaloosa County Jane Doe ===
Tuscaloosa County Jane Doe is a white female aged between 34 and 38 whose body was found in Slaughter Creek, near the Sipsey River in [[Romulus, Alabama|Romulus, Tuscaloosa County]] on April 18, 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1 = Reynolds, Kelvin |author2 = Britzius, Brianne |title = Tuscaloosa authorities exhume body in hopes of solving 1982 murder |url = http://www.myfoxal.com/story/24036804/tuscaloosa-authorities-exhume-body-in-hopes-of-solving-1982-murder |accessdate = December 4, 2014 |work = My Fox Local |agency = Fox News |date = November 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She had been beaten, [[strangulation|strangled]] and sexually assaulted.

She was 5 feet 4 inches tall, weighed approximately 110 to 115 pounds, had a ruddy complexion (indicating that she regularly engaged in outdoor activity), wore an upper partial denture and had dark-brown, shoulder-length hair and brown eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File 108UFAL |url = http://doenetwork.org/cases/108ufal.html |website = doenetwork.org |publisher = [[The Doe Network]] |accessdate = December 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She also had a visible scar beneath her right eyebrow. This decedent wore tennis shoes, knitted blue pants, a long-sleeved blue shirt, and white undergarments.

It is possible that she was fishing at the area and was killed at the scene, as disturbances upon the earth were discovered at the location of her discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Cold Cases |url = http://www.tcsoal.org/help-solve-crime/cold-cases |website = www.tcsoal.org |publisher = Tuscaloosa County Police Department |accessdate = December 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, she may have given birth to at least one child in her lifetime, and her body showed evidence of her having performed manual labor.

The skull of a girl of African heritage was discovered on January 28, 2012 in Opelika, Alabama. Several other bones of this decedent were also subsequently recovered. The victim was concealed in the woods near a trailer park. Examiners concluded that she was between four and seven years old at the time of her death and had black hair.

=== "One-Eyed Jack" ===
On August 20, 1979, the skeletal remains of a man were discovered in [[Tok, Alaska]]. The decedent had apparently [[Hitchhiking|hitchhiked]] to Alaska in 1978 with another man and was then murdered by his companion. He was 6 feet tall, weighed approximately 185 pounds, and was less than 40 years old when he was murdered. The man's left eye was missing, and he wore a distinctive leather eye patch, which may play a crucial role in his future identification. Another feature pertaining to his identity is that he had long brown hair worn with a [[headband]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Case Report – NamUs UP # 12375 |url = https://identifyus.org/en/cases/full_report/12375 |website = identifyus.org |publisher = [[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]] |accessdate = September 23, 2014 |date = April 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[skeletonization|skeletonized]] remains of a girl, nicknamed "Little Miss X," were found on a desolate road 10 miles southeast of the [[Grand Canyon]] in [[Coconino County, Arizona]] on October 31, 1958. Although no [[cause of death]] could be determined, the case has always been considered to be a homicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://azdailysun.com/blogs/criminal-justice-beat/cold-case-close-up----file-little-miss/article_1abf60ae-3133-11e3-b651-0019bb2963f4.html |title = Cold Case Close-up -- File: Little Miss X (1958) |first = LARRY HENDRICKS News Team |last = Leader |date =  |website = azdailysun.com |accessdate = December 15, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The girl was a [[white American]] with possible [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic or Latino ancestry]], and she is estimated to have been between 11 and 14 years old at the time of her death. She was between {{nowrap|5 ft}} and {{nowrap|5 ft 3 in}} ({{convert|60|and|63|in|cm|disp=out}}) in height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = NamUs UP # 9859 |url = https://identifyus.org/en/cases/9859 |website = identifyus.org |publisher = [[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]] |accessdate = January 24, 2015 |date = April 30, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was determined that she had died 9 to 14 months before her bones were found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://azdailysun.com/file-little-miss-x/article_5105c695-5685-5f6a-910f-365c10b2dc78.html |title = File: Little Miss X (1958) |first = LARRY HENDRICKS  News Team |last = Leader |date =  |website = azdailysun.com |accessdate = December 15, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The victim had received good dental care during her life, having seven fillings in four of her teeth.

No clothing was found upon the remains. However, a white wool cardigan short-sleeved sweater, a white cotton size 34C [[bra]], and brown [[Capri pants]] with a green and red plaid design were found at the scene. Investigators deduced that the victim had been stripped naked prior to, or shortly after, being killed. A pair of white panties was also found, although they appeared to be too large for the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File: 1193UFAZ |url = http://doenetwork.org/cases/1193ufaz.html |website = doenetwork.org |publisher = [[The Doe Network]] |accessdate = January 24, 2015 |date = October 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hend&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Hendricks |first1 = Larry |title = Cold Case Close-up – File: Little Miss X (1958) |url = http://azdailysun.com/blogs/criminal-justice-beat/cold-case-close-up----file-little-miss/article_1abf60ae-3133-11e3-b651-0019bb2963f4.html |accessdate = January 24, 2015 |work = Arizona Daily Sun |date = October 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Valentine Sally 003.jpg|150px|thumb|right|[[Forensic facial reconstruction|Facial reconstruction]] of Valentine Sally]]
The body of a white female, aged between 15 and 24, was discovered under a cedar tree in [[Williams, Arizona|Williams]], [[Coconino County, Arizona|Coconino County]], on February 14, 1982. She was discovered approximately 25 feet from Westbound Interstate 40.

Her death had occurred on or around February 1,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Hendricks |first1 = Larry |title = Cold Case Close-up – File: Valentine Sally |url = http://azdailysun.com/blogs/criminal-justice-beat/cold-case-close-up----file-valentine-sally/article_60c6aa7c-101c-11e3-9c62-0019bb2963f4.html |accessdate = September 15, 2014 |agency = Arizona Daily Sun |date = August 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the area of her discovery area was a place where trucks were known to have regularly pulled over to cool their brakes. Because these remains were located on [[Valentine's Day]], the victim was nicknamed "Valentine Sally."

Valentine Sally was approximately five feet five inches in height and weighed 120 pounds; she had blue eyes and strawberry blond hair which was straight and approximately ten inches in length. Distinctive marks upon her body were scars upon her right thigh and her left foot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Jane Doe 1982 |url = http://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMU/1184503/1#poster |website = www.missingkids.org |publisher = [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]] |accessdate = September 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the decedent appeared to have incomplete [[root canal]] surgery upon one of her [[Molar (tooth)|molars]], which may have been related to a notably discomforting infection.This surgery had been performed approximately one week prior to her murder. She also wore an earring in her left ear. It is unknown if her right ear was also pierced, as her right ear was not recovered. Due to decomposition and the activity of scavenging animals, her [[fingerprint]]s could not be obtained (although her DNA and [[Forensic dentistry|dental charts]] were).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File: 585UFAZ |url = http://www.coconino.az.gov |website = doenetwork.org |publisher = [[The Doe Network]] |accessdate = September 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Case Report – NamUs UP # 9864 |url = https://identifyus.org/cases/full_report/9864 |website = identifyus.org |publisher = [[National Missing and Unidentified Persons Database]] |accessdate = September 15, 2014 |date = February 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The victim had been murdered by either [[suffocation]] or [[strangulation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Cold Cases In Flagstaff &amp; Coconino County |url = http://www.coconino.az.gov/DocumentCenter/View/451 |website = www.coconino.az.gov |publisher = Coconino County Sheriff Department |accessdate = September 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and wore ''Seasons'' brand jeans with a handkerchief in one pocket. A distinctive white sweater with thin red stripes and a bra were also found near her remains, which may have also belonged to the victim.

It is possible Valentine Sally had been seen by [[Witness|eyewitnesses]] at a truck stop in [[Ash Fork, Arizona]] in early February, as a waitress at a truck stop named Patty Wilkins recalled a young girl matching her description and aged 16 or 17 who had asked her for [[aspirin]] because of a tooth ache. This girl did not want any food. She was in the company of an older male—possibly a father or uncle—who had expressed concern over her teeth. Wilkins believed the girl was with a relative as normally, had a runaway entered the premises, she would call the sheriff. The pair had entered the premises at 3&amp;nbsp;a.m. and left approximately one hour later.

The partially buried body of a female child was discovered by a schoolteacher in [[Congress, Arizona]] on July 31, 1960.

A local radio host gave the decedent the name "Little Miss Nobody."  He would also initiate a local campaign to raise funds for the child's burial.

One of the legs was severed from the body, which may have been caused due to animal activity. The victim had an overbite, which has been described as fairly noticeable. Jewelry found at the scene included a necklace with rhinestones and three earrings. Burned clothing was also found; a light blue sequin top, jeans and a shoe were all recovered, but were fragmented. A lipstick container, an electric razor, a purse, and a man's ring were also at the scene. She was believed to have been hit on the head with a bloody stick nearby before being burned, although it is not known if she was killed after the blow. The stick and one of the earrings were later found by a woman who visited the scene after hearing about the case.

The individual who discovered these remains, Charles Damoth, was initially believed by authorities to be the killer, although his daughter believes otherwise. At least five others were ruled out as possible perpetrators. Damoth admitted to finding the body days before reporting the killing, which some have found suspicious. He claimed he also had cut wood in the area, including the log found on her body. One person also stated they had seen Damoth's truck near the scene around the time the victim was estimated to have died. Polygraph tests used on the suspect never revealed additional evidence. This murder is also referred to as the "Pyre Case," and the victim has also been nicknamed as "Maria."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Mitchell |first1 = Kirk |title = Woman's charred skeleton found under funeral pyre near Black Hawk |url = http://blogs.denverpost.com/coldcases/2013/11/30/woman-burned-on-pyre-hidden-in-gilpin-county-forest/7534/ |accessdate = December 3, 2014 |work = Denver Post |date = November 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Rainbow Falls Doe" ===
Approximately two to three days after her death, the body of a female aged between 13 and 25 years old (most likely under 20 years of age) was found in Douglas County, Colorado on June 15, 1993. Although she had recently expired, these remains were in an advanced state of decomposition and largely unrecognizable, which made her eye color impossible to distinguish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Carlos IllescasThe Denver Post |url = http://www.denverpost.com/ci_22395930/fingerprints-no-match-body-found-20-years-ago |title = No fingerprint match for body found 20 years ago in Douglas County |publisher = The Denver Post |date = January 17, 2013 |accessdate = November 28, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that this decedent had died from [[blunt-force trauma]] before her body was abandoned in a campsite in the Rainbow Falls Campground (located in the [[San Isabel National Forest]]). Her shoulder-length hair—possibly dyed—was blond or light brown in color. She wore a black [[Harley Davidson]] shirt and several pieces of jewelry: a yellow metal ring on her pinky finger; a yellow metal necklace with a black crystal pendant; and a necklace depicting hands clasping a [[tiger eye]] crystal ball. Her ears were also pierced, her left contained a stud with a clear stone. Her fingernails had been either cut or chewed very short. She was stocky with large breasts and hips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Jane Doe 1993 |url = http://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMU/1106923/1#poster |website = missingkids.org |publisher = [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]] |accessdate = November 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The girl's body was partially clothed but she had not been raped, although she could still have been [[Sexual abuse|molested]]. It is possible that she may have come to Colorado to a Vietnam Vets motorcycle club convention or may have been a runaway teenager from Louisiana.

Rainbow Falls Doe was between five feet six to five feet eight inches in height, and weighed 140 pounds, as she was of a stocky build.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File: 154UFCO |url = http://doenetwork.org/cases/154ufco.html |accessdate = November 25, 2014 |date = May 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The victim had had her [[spleen]] removed in life, which left a visible vertical scar upon her abdomen. She had very healthy teeth. Two [[wisdom tooth|wisdom teeth]] were removed and two teeth were [[Tooth impaction|impacted]]. There is evidence that at some stage in her life she was very well cared for.

The body of a male was discovered on October 12, 2002 in Saguache, Saguache County, Colorado. He had been shot in the head twice at a minimal distance and left in a ravine. He had been wrapped in a handmade, antique quilt, and wrapped again in black plastic secured with duct tape. He is believed to have been asleep when killed. The victim was six feet five inches tall and was estimated to weigh between 235 and 240 pounds. Although he was toothless, no dentures were found at the scene of his discovery. He was estimated to have been between the ages of 30 and 40. He wore a motorcycle jacket with the words "Fort Washington, Maryland" and black shorts. It is possible that he was attending a motorcycle-related gathering at the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File 1550UMCO |url = http://doenetwork.org/cases/1550umco.html |website = doenetwork.org |publisher = [[The Doe Network]] |accessdate = February 18, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Haven County Jane Doe ===
On August 16, 1975, the body of a white female between 18 and 28 years of age was discovered in East Haven, New Haven County, Connecticut. The victim was bound and gagged, nude, and floating in a drainage ditch behind a building. This woman was killed by [[strangulation]] at least five days prior to her discovery, although her face was recognizable. Antenna wires were visible around her neck, waist and legs and her body was wrapped in a tarp, which had been secured with an electrical cord. It is believed that the decedent was not murdered at the location where her body was discovered. The victim was around five feet six inches in height and weighed approximately 125 pounds. She had dark brown hair and either hazel or brown eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = New Haven Connecticut Jane Doe August 1975 |url = http://canyouidentifyme.org/NewHavenConnecticutJaneDoeAugust1975 |website = canyouidentifyme.org |accessdate = September 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She may have undergone [[rhinoplasty]] (which is a cosmetic surgery to reshape a person's nose). This may be a contributing factor for this woman remaining unidentified, as those who knew her in life before this possible surgery would be less likely to recognize the constructed [[facial composite]] released to the public.

This decedent may also have worn braces at one point in her life and had both ears pierced; she wore silver-colored earrings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = NamUs UP # 10796 |url = https://identifyus.org/en/cases/10796 |website = identifyus.org |publisher = [[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]] |accessdate = September 27, 2014 |date = November 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No evidence of her murderer was left behind, save for white spots of paint discovered upon the tarp used to conceal her body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File 93UFCT |url = http://doenetwork.org/cases/93ufct.html |website = doenetwork.org |publisher = [[The Doe Network]] |accessdate = September 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her murder could possibly be linked to that of a man who was murdered and disposed of in a similar manner, as well as serial killings in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Newton |first1 = Michael |title = The Encyclopedia of Unsolved Crimes |date = 2004 |publisher = Infobase Publishing |location = New York City |isbn = 0-8160-6988-3 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=hqgtyeQQLn8C&amp;pg=PA219 |accessdate = September 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Yaremich |first1 = Marissa |title = Cold cases frustrate cops and families, but scientific advances may help |url = http://www.doenetwork.org/media/news70.html |accessdate = September 27, 2014 |agency = New Haven Register |date = October 10, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She is buried in an unmarked grave in the State Street Cemetery in Hamden, Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Jane Hamden Doe |url = http://canyouidentifyme.blogspot.com/2011/06/jane-hamden-doe.html |website = canyouidentifyme.org |accessdate = September 27, 2014 |date = June 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Castle County Jane Doe ===
{{anchor|New Castle County Jane Doe}}
A possible victim of serial killer [[Henry Lee Lucas]] was found in a field in [[Townsend, Delaware|Townsend]], [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]], [[Delaware]] on June 27, 1977. Examination of the bones concluded that she was a middle aged woman, the mother of approximately two children and had various dental problems, as well as a spinal condition, at the age of thirty-three to sixty-three. Her dental problems may have been due to smoking, as a large amount of tar was found in her mouth, which also had a removable plate and many fillings. Despite the various types of dental work, the quality of the procedures was of fairly low quality. One of the bones of one of her right fingers was broken, possibly from defending herself from the killer. She may have been native to [[Michigan]], which has led investigators to believe that Lucas had been involved, as he had given statements in prison describing a similar crime scene as well as claiming he had murdered a Michigan woman in the same area.&lt;ref name="Case File 132UFDE"&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File 132UFDE |url = http://doenetwork.org/cases/132ufde.html |publisher = The Doe Network |accessdate = May 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The woman's DNA profile was analyzed by the [[Parabon NanoLabs]] in 2018. Traits such as blue eyes, a fair complexion and Northern European ancestry were suggested by their examination. A computer generated image was also produced, depicting an approximation of the woman at age 48.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Snapshot Prediction Results |url=https://www.namus.gov/api/CaseSets/NamUs/UnidentifiedPersons/Cases/2170/Documents/2553 |publisher=[[Parabon Nanolabs]] |accessdate=August 14, 2018 |date=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their [[skeletonization|skeletonized]] bodies were discovered buried upon Gacy's property between December 26, 1978, and March 9, 1979. Due to the advanced state of decomposition, in most instances, the causes of death of the victims could not be discovered (although the vast majority of Gacy's victims were killed by [[strangulation]] or [[asphyxiation]]).&lt;ref name="Case File 954UMIL"&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File 954UMIL |url = http://doenetwork.org/cases/954umil.html |publisher = The Doe Network |accessdate = May 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Case File 956UMIL"&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File 956UMIL |url = http://doenetwork.org/cases/956umil.html |publisher = The Doe Network |accessdate = May 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 27, 1993, the severed head of a woman, aged thirty to fifty was discovered in the Wayne Fitzgerrell State Park in Ina, Jefferson County, Illinois. The woman's head may have been thrown from a vehicle, as her head was discovered hanging in brush, close to a road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Case Report – NamUs UP # 11091 |url = https://identifyus.org/en/cases/full_report/11091 |website = identifyus.org |publisher = [[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]] |accessdate = August 16, 2014 |date = March 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because no other parts of her body were found, the height and weight were impossible to determine. Examination of the skull suggested she suffered from [[wry neck]] syndrome, which would have caused her head to be in an awkward position when she was alive. This deformity may have been caused from previous trauma, possibly from a car accident. Her hair was a reddish-brown color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File 166UFIL |url = http://doenetwork.org/cases/166ufil.html |website = doenetwork.org |publisher = [[The Doe Network]] |accessdate = August 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE |url = http://www.isp.state.il.us/crime/unsolveddetails.cfm?ID=24 |publisher = Illinois State Police |accessdate = August 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A woman's body was found in a creek off of [[Interstate 70]] in [[Salina, Kansas|Salina]], [[Saline County, Kansas]] on January 25, 1986. The victim appeared to have been beaten and then thrown over a bridge where she subsequently died of drowning approximately two days before her body was found. The victim, nicknamed as "Miss Molly," was estimated to be between twenty and thirty-five when she died, at a height of five feet five and a weight of 125 pounds. The female wore clothing that originated from France: a bra, bikini underwear, stockings and purple sweatpants. These were sold in large U.S. cities or outside of the country. Other items, such as a nylon bag and a pillow case were found near the body, but it is unknown if they were owned by Miss Molly.

This decedent had possibly carried a child before her death, as she had stretch marks on her stomach. Her hair was brown with blond highlights, and she had gray or blue eyes and several visible scars upon her jaw. She had also had an appendectomy, had pierced ears, and wore false fingernails that were painted red.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = NamUs UP # 5066 |url = https://identifyus.org/en/cases/5066 |website = identifyus.org |publisher = [[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]] |accessdate = February 23, 2015 |date = April 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her teeth showed signs of some extractions and braces, some of which had taken place recently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File 184UFKS |url = http://doenetwork.org/cases/184ufks.html |website = doenetwork.org |accessdate = February 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 19, 1986, the body of a white female aged between 20 and 30 was found in [[Slidell, Louisiana|Slidell]], [[Saint Tammany Parish, Louisiana|Saint Tammany Parish]], [[Louisiana]], in [[Lake Pontchartrain]]. She had been murdered around one to two days prior to her discovery, and her body had already begun to decompose. The cause of her death was ruled to be a combination of [[asphyxiation]] and stabbing, as wounds were visible on her face. Her hair was either a light brown or red, which was shoulder length. She also had freckles and had received breast implants. It is believed this decedent had been married, as her left ring finger showed that a ring had been worn at one time, but had been recently removed, likely by her killer. She was also three months pregnant.

The decedent was of a petite stature, standing at five feet two to four inches, and weighed an estimated 126 pounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Bishop |first1 = Alex |title = Unsolved Murder Spotlight: The Slidell Jane Doe |url = http://www.crimelibrary.com/blog/2013/05/07/unsolved-murder-spotlight-the-slidell-jane-doe/index.html |publisher = Crime Library |accessdate = September 2, 2014 |date = May 7, 2013 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141006085949/http://www.crimelibrary.com/blog/2013/05/07/unsolved-murder-spotlight-the-slidell-jane-doe/index.html |archivedate = October 6, 2014 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her body was nude with a plastic bag that had been placed over her head and a weight was tied to her neck to ensure her remains would not surface.

After her autopsy, examiners concluded that the victim may have been involved in an automobile accident prior to her murder, as evidence on her hips showed signs of healed fractures. It was also possible that a [[rhinoplasty]] was performed on her nose, which may have been due to the same reason. Scars were also found upon her abdomen, her knee and one wrist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Case Report – NamUs UP # 852 |url = https://identifyus.org/cases/full_report/852 |website = identifyus.org |publisher = [[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]] |accessdate = September 2, 2014 |date = February 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her teeth were excellently cared for, although some were possibly congenitally missing and all of her wisdom teeth had been removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File 16UFLA |url = http://doenetwork.org/cases/16ufla.html |website = doenetwork.org |publisher = [[The Doe Network]] |accessdate = September 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The body of a man of African heritage, 25 to 40 years old, was found on January 4, 1993 in Bancroft, Beauregard Parish, Louisiana. Examiners believe he had been killed within three to four weeks before, as the state of decomposition was severe in some areas of the body, resulting in partial [[skeletonization]]. His remains were disposed of in the woods, located in proximity to Highway 389. He wore tan shoes, blue jeans, had short hair and very healthy teeth and had broken his nose once in his life.

The victim had died about three days before and was [[dump job|dumped]] at the scene following his murder. His body was in an advanced stage of decomposition. A scar, possibly from an open heart surgery was present on his chest. His height was estimated to be about 5'10.

The body of a full-term baby girl with an attached [[umbilical cord]] was found December 7, 1985, in [[Frenchville, Maine]]. Her body was found by a dog, which then brought it to its owners. The infant had died of [[Hypothermia|exposure]] within a half hour of her birth, due to extremely cold temperatures. She had been abandoned in a [[gravel pit]]. Examiners determined that the dog had not caused injury to the baby.

At the location, several bloody footprints were found, believed to have been left there by the infant's mother. Investigators suspect the baby's mother may be [[Canadian people|Canadian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Baby Jane Doe |url = http://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/index.php?topic=state_police_unsolved&amp;id=22478&amp;v=Article-homicides |website = main.gov |publisher = Maine State Police |accessdate = November 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File: 1067UFME |url = http://doenetwork.org/cases/1067ufme.html |website = doenetwork.org |publisher = [[The Doe Network]] |accessdate = November 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 24, 1982, the [[skeletonization|skeletonized]] remains of a young woman were discovered concealed inside a footlocker in [[Frederick, Maryland]] by two hikers. The decedent is estimated to have died between 1972 and 1982, with pathologists determining she had most likely died at least three years prior to the discovery of her body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/431ufmd.html ''doenetwork.org| case 431UFMD'']&lt;/ref&gt; Her age is estimated to have been anywhere between 17 and 45 years old, although the most likely age range of this decedent is between 18 and 25 years old.

=== Harford County John Doe ===
The body of an Asian male, aged between 20 and 30, was located on January 9, 1987 in [[Abingdon, Maryland|Abingdon, Harford County]]. He was murdered just days prior to the discovery of his body and had been killed by a gunshot wound to the chest. His body was abandoned at the side of a highway and was bound, wrapped in plastic and then covered with a sheet. He was around five feet five to five feet seven inches  in height and weighed approximately 134 pounds. The man had several scars on his face, one near his upper lip and four on the top of his head, which had healed. The victim had black, straight hair and brown eyes. He wore a pair of reddish and white nylon swim trunks that had a blue stripe and brown lining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = NamUs UP # 1863 |url = https://identifyus.org/en/cases/1863 |website = identifyus.org |publisher = [[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]] |accessdate = December 4, 2014 |date = May 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By studying the teeth of the decedent (which displated no signs of dental care) it is presumed that he had a habit of using tobacco products.

The victim was between five feet and five feet two inches tall, weighing 110-120 pounds. The hair was described to be dark and wavy and a tooth protruded from her upper set of teeth. A [[Sleeveless shirt|tank top]] and several pieces of [[jewelry]] were found on her arms, hands, neck and ankle. A silver and gold colored [[wristwatch]] was also worn by the girl.

The decedent had been beaten to death, and may have been a victim of a sexual crime, as no clothing below her waist was present upon her body. The female had brown eyes and black hair accompanied with hair extensions which were approximately a foot long.

In New Bedford, Bristol County, Massachusetts, the body of a woman aged between 30 and 45 years old was recovered from the Popes Island marina on October 30, 1996. The victim had been placed inside two garbage bags and then wrapped in a white and teal-colored blanket. She had suffered a blow to the head and was shot twelve times. By examining the condition of her body, she had been deceased for less than two days and her body had been in the water for less than a day.

The decedent was five feet two inches tall and approximately 127 pounds. The decedent had naturally light brown hair (which was dyed strawberry blond) and had brown eyes. She wore a yellow shirt, a white pullover with rectangular shapes and high heeled boots. She wore a gold ring with an emerald stone which experts say comes from [[Belarus]], a part of the old [[Soviet Union]]. She had also received dental work that is believed to have been performed outside of the country. However, one instance of [[root canal surgery]] had been performed inside the United States. The woman did not shave beneath her arms or shave her legs, also indicating she was likely European.

Because of the lack of identification and fingerprint matches, the woman may entered the United States without documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File 174UFMA |url = http://doenetwork.org/cases/174ufma.html |website = www.doenetwork.org |publisher = [[The Doe Network]] |accessdate = September 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Unidentified Female Found in New Bedford, MA |url = http://www.mass.gov/eopss/law-enforce-and-cj/law-enforce/missing-and-wanted/unidentified-bodies/unidentified-female-in-new-bedford.html |website = www.mass.gov |publisher = New Bedford Police Department |accessdate = September 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jackson County John Doe (2001) ===
A "middle aged" man's body was found wrapped in carpeting and a blanket along a road in Pascagoula, Jackson County, Mississippi on June 18, 2001. He was of white or Hispanic ethnicity and was estimated to be five feet five to five feet seven inches in height and weighed about 250 pounds. He had brown hair that was cut very short and had some tattoos, including the name "John" upon his chest. He also had an elaborate tattoo of a bird upon his shoulder and the letter "E" or "F" upon the inside of his left arm. The victim also had distinctive scars. One was a crescent shape above his left eye, another on his forehead, on the side of his nose and a possible gunshot scar on one of the wrists.

He was clothed in a white T-shirt, jogging shorts and pants and was murdered about two days before the discovery. The murder of the victim has been solved, as a subject was apprehended in 2004. However, the victim remains unidentified, although he may have been native to Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File: 429UMMS |url = http://doenetwork.org/cases/429umms.html |website = doenetwork.org |publisher = [[The Doe Network]] |accessdate = March 4, 2015 |date = March 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== St. Charles County Jane Doe ===
The body of a white girl aged two to three years was discovered inside a suitcase that had been thrown into Lake Alton in [[West Alton, Missouri]], in [[St. Charles County]] on February 1, 1968. This decedent is also known Jane Doe West Alton.

The child's remains were recovered by two fishermen who had hooked their line on the suitcase, which had been wrapped in blue clothesline and weighted with two 10-pound [[barbell]]s found inside the suitcase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File: 1282UFMO |url = http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/1282ufmo.html |website = doenetwork.org |publisher = [[The Doe Network]] |accessdate = September 24, 2015 |date = September 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinctive features noted upon her remains were an abnormally large tooth and a scar above one of her eyes. She had long, blond hair, although due to decomposition, her eye color could not be determined. She was approximately 2 feet 8 inches tall and weighed between 35 and 40 pounds. The sole item of clothing upon her remains was a pair of white underwear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Jane Doe 1968 |url = http://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMU/1253098/1/screen |website = missingkids.org |publisher = [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]] |accessdate = September 24, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The child had been dead for up to one month before her body was discovered. She was identified as a homicide victim, although authorities declined to reveal the precise method used to kill her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Madden |first1 = Roche |title = Body of 'Jane Doe West Alton' to be exhumed Thursday |url = http://fox2now.com/2015/09/24/body-of-jane-doe-west-alton-to-be-exhumed-thursday/ |accessdate = September 24, 2015 |work = Fox 2 Now |agency = Fox News |date = September 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was laid to rest on February 7 in an unmarked grave in the children's section of Oak Grove Cemetery.

After an image of the child was constructed by the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]] in September 2015, the body was [[burial|exhumed]] on September 24 from her unmarked grave in an effort to obtain a [[Genetic testing|DNA sample]]. Investigators later announced that the DNA testing conducted upon her remains was unsuccessful. Nonetheless, the exhumation would yield a more accurate estimation of the girl's age at the time of her death. Her skull was studied to create a more accurate composite image of her appearance in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Body of child murdered in 1968 exhumed by police, FBI |url = http://www.11alive.com/story/news/crime/2015/09/25/body-child-murdered-1968-exhumed-police-fbi/72833230/ |accessdate = September 27, 2015 |work = 11 Alive Atlanta |publisher = NBC |date = September 25, 2015 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Grace Doe" ===
The decomposing body of a woman aged between 21 and 31 was found on December 2, 1990 in McDonald County, Missouri. The woman was possibly of mixed ancestry, having characteristics of both white and Native Americans. She had been tied with several different types of rope, her hands behind her back and fastened to one of her legs, which led some to presume she was a victim of rape or another form of sexual assault. One of the ropes was identified to be from a parachute, which may have originated from some sort of military branch. She was possibly killed at the scene, as a witness reported that he "heard a woman scream" around the time the Jane Doe would have died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File: 784UFMO |url = http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/784ufmo.html |website = doenetwork.org |publisher = [[The Doe Network]] |accessdate = January 28, 2015 |date = June 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== St. Louis John Doe (1992) ===
On March 7, 1992, the skeleton of a white male aged between 15 and 25 was located in St. Louis, Missouri in an abandoned building that had previously burned down. He was approximately five feet seven to five feet ten inches tall at a weight around 145 pounds. His hair was either blond or brown and was two inches in length. The decedent had received a fracture to his arm that had healed before his death, indicating some sort of injury was sustained when he was alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = John Doe 1992 |url = http://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMU/1107687/1#poster |website = missingkids.org |publisher = [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]] |accessdate = November 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His dentition was good and he did have some crooked teeth on the top set; four of his molars were repaired. The clothing he wore included a pink shirt, a white shirt with an embossed logo of Myrtle Beach, a black coat, boxers with stripes, jeans, socks and size eight shoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = NamUs UP # 7385 |url = https://identifyus.org/cases/7385 |website = identifyus.org |publisher = [[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]] |accessdate = November 13, 2014 |date = July 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case is considered a homicide, as evidence of numerous stab wounds were discovered on his ribs. He was originally believed to have been a black male as old as forty-five. After his remains were exhumed for additional physical information, his skull was absent and his coffin was subjected to damage. He could have been deceased from the years 1989 to 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File: 1781UMMO |url = http://doenetwork.org/cases/1781ummo.html |website = doenetwork.org |publisher = [[The Doe Network]] |accessdate = November 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bullet hole on her head had been covered with men's underwear.

The victim wore a light yellow pair of tennis shoes, a sleeveless blue shirt, jeans with a blue bikini bottom in its pocket and a blue swimsuit underneath.

After examination, it was determined that she had used both alcohol and [[marijuana]] prior to her death, possibly given birth to a child in the past, and had very healthy teeth. Isotope analysis showed her recent place of residence to the city of [[Afton, Wyoming]].

The decedent had straight, light brown or auburn hair of approximately shoulder length, although her hair may have actually been a wig, as her hair bore evidence of artificial coloration and had various shades of color with the presence of coloring additive. Also found in her possession was a motel key; this key belonged to a nearby motel on the [[Garden State Parkway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File: 668UFNJ |url = http://doenetwork.org/cases/668ufnj.html |website = doenetwork.org |publisher = [[The Doe Network]] |accessdate = December 29, 2014 |date = May 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gloucester County Jane Doe (2004) ===
On March 2, 2004, a woman's remains were found in Logan Township, Gloucester County, New Jersey. She is believed to have been multiracial, as traits from Caucasian, Hispanic and Asian races were found during her autopsy, which led to several reconstructions being made to illustrate her potential likeness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = GLOUCESTER COUNTY Unidentified Deceased Female |url = http://www.njsp.org/miss/ui_glouces_u170007495.html |website = njsp.org |publisher = New Jersey State Police |accessdate = January 13, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The woman was aged between 18 and 30 when she was murdered by an undetermined cause. The victim had long dark hair with light highlights and was believed to be at a height between four feet eleven to five feet two inches at a weight between 80 and 110 pounds. Her body was partially disrobed and had also been burned, along with evidence that animals had scavenged the body, after it was [[dump job|dumped]] alongside interstate 295. Her teeth were in natural condition and she also had possibly borne a child during her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File 41UFNJ |url = http://doenetwork.org/cases/41ufnj.html |website = doenetwork.org |publisher = [[The Doe Network]] |accessdate = January 13, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her clothing consisted of two blue shirts with different colored stripes, black pants and pink panties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = NamUs UP # 1779 |url = https://identifyus.org/en/cases/1779 |website = identifyus.org |publisher = [[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]] |accessdate = January 13, 2015 |date = April 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hudson County Jane Doe ===
On October 18, 2007, the body of a black female was discovered in Bayonne, Hudson County, New Jersey. She was believed to be at the age of 16 to 20 years old when she died, although it was initially presumed that she could have been as old as thirty-five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Fink |first1 = Jason |title = Police seek help in identifying body found in Bayonne |url = http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2008/03/police_seek_help_in_identifyin.html |accessdate = October 17, 2014 |agency = The Jersey Journal |date = March 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the cause of the young woman's death was not discovered, it has been listed as suspicious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Fink |first1 = Jason |title = Dead body found on Route 440 in Bayonne |url = http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2007/10/dead_body_found_on_route_440_i.html |accessdate = October 17, 2014 |agency = The Jersey Journal |date = September 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was believed that she had been deceased for approximately three weeks prior to her discovery. Because of this fact, her remains were in an advanced state of decomposition, which may have erased any signs of trauma that she could have endured. In her long, black and braided hair, red and copper-colored extensions were found, which could be a vital clue in determining her identity. The decedent also wore camouflage pants, boy's underwear, a pink halter top and a black bra with red lace.&lt;ref name=networkhudson&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File 664UFNJ |url = http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/664ufnj.html |website = doenetwork.org |publisher = [[The Doe Network]] |accessdate = August 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; White socks with orange on the toe area with a green [[teddy bear]] design on their side were found on her feet and no shoes were reported to have been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Conty |first1 = Michaelangelo |title = Five years later, police still trying to identify decomposed body found in Bayonne |url = http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2012/10/five_years_later_police_still_1.html |accessdate = October 17, 2014 |agency = The Jersey Journal |date = October 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The jewelry found upon the body included a metal body chain was worn around her waist as well as a plastic brown ring on her right thumb.

===Doña Ana County Jane Doe===
On March 10, 1985, the skeleton of a female aged 16 to 20 was discovered by a group of hunters, hidden under plastic and buried in a shallow grave in [[Doña Ana County, New Mexico]]. The decedent had died approximately three to six months before her body was discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Doe 1985|url=http://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMU/1184548/1/screen|website=missingkids.org|publisher=[[National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]]|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is believed to have been white and had blonde or light brown hair, which was likely her natural color, as the presence of pubic hair of the same color indicated. She had painted at least two of her fingernails pink and her skeletal structure bore evidence of abnormalities, some specific conditions of which were noted by a [[forensic anthropologist]] to be unusual to occur in someone of the subject's age. The remains were clothed in pink undergarments and a white jersey with the letter "W." Some of the supports in the Jane Doe's bra were noted to have separated from the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 8314|url=https://identifyus.org/cases/8314|website=identifyus.org|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=28 July 2015|date=22 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also appeared to have possibly suffered a healed injury to the right side of her nose.

Her height was believed to be between five feet and five feet four inches tall (152–162&amp;nbsp;cm). Although her weight could not be determined, she was most likely of a slim build.

Authorities determined the girl was a victim of homicide but declined to release details of how she was murdered, as the case is currently open.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cutris|first1=Genevieve|title=Somebody's Daughter|url=http://kfoxtv.com/news/special-assignments/somebodys-daughter|accessdate=17 January 2018|work=KFOX 14|date=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was approximately five feet eight inches tall with light brown hair and a graying beard. He also had green stitches in his knee. The victim wore an undershirt, a green shirt, jeans, and Nike shoes. The victim was estimated to be between 30 and 50 and was presumed to have been set afire after being chained to the pole, which was burnt halfway. The lighter presumably used to light the fire was found near the man's remains. The chain itself had been fastened with a lock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File 1588UMNM |url = http://doenetwork.org/cases/1588umnm.html |website = doenetwork.org |publisher = [[The Doe Network]] |accessdate = December 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hillsborough Jane Doe ===
[[File:NC Jane Doe 1990 composite.jpg|150px|thumb|left|An official [[FBI]] reconstruction of the Hillsborough Jane Doe]]
The decomposed body of a female, estimated to have been deceased for between three and six days, was discovered by construction workers on September 19, 1990 at a location known as "Chapel Hill" in Hillsborough, Orange County, North Carolina. As the remains were found near the New Hope Church Exit, the victim was nicknamed "Hope." The victim was a Caucasian female, aged between 14 and 25—most likely between 18 and 22—at the time of her death. She was found clothed in only a pink shirt decorated with three cartoon-style rabbits, two riding bicycles and one riding a unicycle; a bra; and white socks that were noticeably clean, indicating that she had worn shoes, likely around size six, but they had been removed either before or after death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = NamUs UP # 2224 |url = https://identifyus.org/cases/2224 |website = identifyus.org |publisher = [[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]] |accessdate = July 2, 2015 |date = July 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was between five feet three and five feet five inches in height and weighed between 110 and 115 pounds. Jewelry on the body included a ring and a bracelet both made from metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Jane Doe 1990 |url = http://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMU/1106716/1/screen |website = missingkids.org |publisher = [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]] |accessdate = July 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decedent had shoulder-length brown or strawberry-blond hair with streaks that appeared to have been frosted blond and was cut in layers. She had also undergone surgery to remove her [[Appendix (anatomy)|appendix]] at some point in life, as a scar was noted on her abdomen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = 8 years, 11 miles, 2 children |url = http://blog.missingkids.org/post/62806504042/8-years-11-miles-2-children |website = blog.missingkids.org |publisher = [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]] |accessdate = July 2, 2015 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=Checkingfax |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dental cavities were found upon the victim's teeth, yet she had undergone dental treatment in life, as some "restorations" were visible. The victim's [[wisdom teeth]] had yet to erupt. Other examinations of the remains indicated she did not appear to have ever broken or fractured a bone, or borne a child.

Days before the remains were found, a female matching the description of the deceased was seen walking along [[Interstate 85]], near the city of Burlington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File 558UFNC |url = http://doenetwork.org/cases/558ufnc.html |website = doenetwork.org |publisher = [[The Doe Network]] |accessdate = July 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that this female was hitchhiking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Tips sought in 1990 Chapel Hill 'Jane Doe' case |url = http://www.wral.com/news/local/video/9814416/ |accessdate = July 2, 2015 |work = WRAL |date = July 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Damage to the victim's neck indicated she was likely strangled to death. The case was ruled as murder; one which has yet to be solved.

=== "Baby Michael" ===
The body of a newborn male infant was discovered on March 3, 1999 near Fayetteville, Cumberland County, North Carolina. The child was murdered; having received extensive blunt trauma to his head and much of his body. After the child's death, he was placed inside of a distinctive large garbage bag, which had beccome undone and was covering only his legs at the time of discovery. His [[umbilical cord]] and several pubic hairs—likely sourcing from his mother—were still present on his body. DNA from the child's mother was also found. The boy's body had been disposed of by being accidentally dropped or thrown from a passing vehicle. This method of body disposal did not cause the damage to the child, as his wounds were considered to have been too severe and had evidently occurred before death. His mother may have been a white or Native American (possibly from the [[Lumbee]] tribe).

The day prior to the boy's discovery, a pregnant female was observed to have acted unusually after she was informed that she was required to take a maternity test. Later that night, a pregnant woman and a man were seen in a truck that was parked close to the area where the body was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File: 387UMNC |url = http://doenetwork.org/cases/387umnc.html |website = doenetwork.org |publisher = [[The Doe Network]] |accessdate = August 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, a memorial placed at the location of Baby Michael's discovery was discovered to have been damaged.

=== "Lime Lady" ===
[[File:225UFOK - Lime Lady.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Reconstruction of the "Lime Lady"]]
On April 18, 1980, the [[mummy|mummified]] corpse of a woman was discovered on the banks of the [[North Canadian River]] close to [[Jones, Oklahoma|Jones]] in [[Oklahoma County, Oklahoma|Oklahoma County]], Oklahoma. The presence of three gunshot wounds upon her body clearly indicated her death was a homicide.&lt;ref name="Case File: 255UFOK"&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File: 255UFOK |url = http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/255ufok.html |publisher = The Doe Network |accessdate = April 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these wounds contained clothing fibers and a [[Dime (United States coin)|dime]] that had been driven into the body by a [[.45 ACP|.45 caliber bullet]]. Due to the fact [[calcium oxide|quicklime]] that had been poured onto her remains in a likely attempt to accelerate decomposition, the woman became known as "Lime Lady". (The [[quicklime]] had actually helped preserve her corpse.)

She was between the ages of 18 and 25, five feet six inches tall and weighed approximately 115 to 120 pounds. She had a heart [[tattoo]] on her chest as well as an [[appendectomy]] scar. It is believed that she may have been murdered by a biker gang earlier in the year or in 1979, although some contemporary reports indicate she may have been deceased for as little as ten days. Multiple [[forensic facial reconstruction|facial reconstructions]] of the decedent have been created, and her DNA has extracted for profiling in 2014.&lt;ref name="NamUs UP # 4897"&gt;{{cite web |title = NamUs UP # 4897 |url = https://identifyus.org/en/cases/4897 |accessdate = April 26, 2014 |date = March 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Corbin"&gt;{{cite news |last = Corbin |first = Cristina |title = DNA profile of Oklahoma's murdered 'lime lady' emerges after three decades |url = http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/02/28/police-use-dna-preserved-by-lime-juice-to-help-identify-woman-in-decades-old/ |accessdate = April 26, 2014 |newspaper = Fox News |date = February 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 11, 1963, the remains of an infant or toddler were discovered near [[Ashland, Oregon|Ashland]], [[Jackson County, Oregon|Jackson County]], [[Oregon]] after one of the blankets he was wrapped in was hooked by a fisherman. His remains were concealed in a blue blanket, a patchwork quilt with several red designs.

The child's autopsy indicated he likely died in the autumn of 1962 and he possibly had [[Down syndrome]] or a similar disability.

What is unique about the boy's dentition is that one of his front bottom teeth was split in two, having two roots and an uncommon groove at its top. In efforts to identify the child, examiners took his footprints and compared them to those taken from other children from a local hospital and none apparently matched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File 1144UMOR |url = http://doenetwork.org/cases/1144umor.html |website = doenetwork.org |publisher = [[The Doe Network]] |accessdate = August 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A forensic examination of his remains indicated he may have been Hispanic, aged between 25 and 35, with brown hair and brown eyes. He was five feet five inches tall and weighed approximately 122 pounds. The decedent wore a mustache and beard, and his hairline was receding.

On November 16, 1987, the remains of a mixed-race woman of predominantly African and possibly Asian or East Indian heritage were found in Aiken County, South Carolina. The cause of death was not determined, but the bodies of two homicide victims were found within a half-mile of the same location, one in 1991 and one in 1993. The deceased had a visible overbite and analysis of her hair indicated that she used cocaine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File 7UFSC |url = http://doenetwork.org/cases/7ufsc.html |website = doenetwork.org |publisher = [[The Doe Network]] |accessdate = August 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was estimated to have been dead for between one and five years, and to have been between the ages of 17 and 25 at death.

On January 25, 1993, the body of another unidentified woman was found in the same vicinity. She was aged between twenty-five and thirty-two, between 5 feet 4 and 5 feet 7 inches tall, and died from a stab wound to the back of the neck. Like the previous victim, she had protruding teeth and wore no clothing; unlike the previous victim, her body had been burned. She was estimated to have been dead for around one to three years. Convicted serial killer [[Henry Louis Wallace]] has been questioned in relation to these deaths, as he confessed to murdering black women in North and South Carolina in the relevant timeframe. However, no charges have been brought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File 46UFSC |url = http://doenetwork.org/cases/46ufsc.html |website = doenetwork.org |publisher = [[The Doe Network]] |accessdate = August 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 1975, the virtually skeletonized remains of a black woman between the ages of 15 and 25 years were discovered in [[Maury County, Tennessee]]. Her body was found near a highway, leading investigators to believe that she may not have been a native of Tennessee.

An examination of the decedent's body indicated she  most likely died six to nine months prior to the discovery of her body, thus making the most likely time of her death in the spring or summer of 1974. She was 5 feet 3 inches to 5 feet 5 inches in height, and weighed between 127 and 137 pounds. She wore a red top decorated with a seashell design, blue pants with a floral design, undergarments, and [[Wedge (footwear)|wedgie shoes]]. Her hair was black and kinky; her eye color could not be determined. Her autopsy also noted a distinctive dental trait: she had an extra tooth in her upper jaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File: 907UFTN |url = http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/907uftn.html |website = doenetwork.org |publisher = [[The Doe Network]] |accessdate = December 16, 2014 |date = February 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The victim had received several bone fractures during her life; two of which were fully healed at the time of her death.

=== Davidson County Jane Doe (1998) ===
On March 19, 1998, the body of a white female between the ages of 45 and 55 was discovered in the [[Cumberland River]] in Nashville. She had been shot twice in the head approximately one day before her body was located, and her body was dressed in athletic pants, underwear and one Reebok shoe. She wore jewelry, including a gold necklace with a [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]] zodiac pendant and two rings; one of which was gold and the other black.&lt;ref name="NamUs UP # 10155"&gt;{{cite web |title = NamUs UP # 10155 |url = https://identifyus.org/en/cases/10155 |website = identifyus.org |publisher = [[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]] |accessdate = October 14, 2014 |date = April 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The victim was overweight for her height, weighing 167 pounds at her height of five feet two inches. Her teeth had been extensively cared for in life: dental work valued at approximately $10,000 was visible upon her teeth, indicating she likely hailed from a higher socioeconomic class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Nashville, Tennessee Jane Doe |url = http://www.hellbeasts.com/?p=7974 |website = hellbeasts.com |accessdate = October 14, 2014 |date = October 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her hair was brown with highlights and her eyes were green.&lt;ref name="NamUs UP # 10155"/&gt;

A man had been seen in the company of this woman prior to her death inside a store; he had worn the same pendant as she. This individual was never located.

=== Rockbridge County John Doe ===
The decomposing body of a white male was found on May 27, 1987 in [[Rockbridge County, Virginia]]. He was estimated to be between 20 and 40 years of age (most likely being aged in his early twenties). The decedent's hair was brown and he was approximately five feet four inches tall. He was presumed to have been nearsighted, as he wore plastic-framed glasses to treat the condition, issued by a [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]]. The decedent's possessions included a switchblade along with a cross necklace, ten dollars and twelve cents, a cassette tape, memo pad, a lighter, and a pen. His clothing included a short-sleeved shirt, blue jeans, white socks with yellow and green stripes, a brown belt with paint-spattering, brown shoes, and a coat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = NamUs UP # 6248 |url = https://identifyus.org/cases/6248 |website = identifyus.org |publisher = [[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]] |accessdate = January 6, 2015 |date = November 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The man had been killed by two gunshot wounds by a man named John Swartz, who has since been convicted of his murder. The victim had allegedly been picked up at a truck stop by Swartz and had informed Swartz his name was Chris.

Swartz had paid the decedent assist him with unloading cargo, which he then used to buy several items. After Swartz had picked up a second shipment, the Swartz requested more money along with some of the items in the vehicle, threatening Swartz with the knife he had purchased with his initial payment. This physical threat was accompanied by a verbal threat of informing authorities he had an "unauthorized passenger" inside his vehicle. After he had taken contact information that was later discovered in his pockets, Swartz eventually killed the man and proceeded with his shipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File 149UMVA |url = http://doenetwork.org/cases/149umva.html |website = doenetwork.org |publisher = [[The Doe Network]] |accessdate = January 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|the child found in 2001, also nicknamed "Precious Doe"|Murder of Erica Green}}
Snohomish County Jane Doe is the name given to an unidentified female aged between 15 and 21 who was picked up hitchhiking in August 1977. The man that accepted her request for a ride eventually strangled and shot the victim seven times in the head after she refused to engage in intercourse after the pair had spent the day together. Her decomposed body was discovered five days afterward, on August 14, 1977 in [[Everett, Washington]].

The decedent was determined to be a white female with un-dyed brown, shoulder-length hair. She was five feet ten inches in height and weighed between 150 and 160 pounds. She had a suntan, restorations on her upper front teeth (that protruded somewhat), and appeared to be a smoker, as she had a packet of [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] cigarettes in her possession.

In 1979, the man that killed her was convicted of her murder after [[Ballistics|ballistic testing]] confirmed that bullets recovered at the scene of her discovery had been fired from his gun. He was released 26 years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File: 516UFWA |url = http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/516ufwa.html |publisher = [[The Doe Network]] |accessdate = October 19, 2016 |date = October 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 1, 1980, the partially skeletalized remains of a girl between the ages of 13 and 18 were discovered in woodland near Amboy, Clark County, Washington (although her [[NamUs]] profile states the remains were discovered on February 24). She is estimated to have died circa 1978, and was the victim of a homicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Medical Examiner Needs Public's Help Identifying Teen Found IN 1980 |url = https://www.clark.wa.gov/home/medical-examiner-needs-publics-help-identifying-teen-found-1980 |website = Clark County Medical Examiner |accessdate = December 21, 2016 |date = December 19, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The girl's weight and height could not be estimated because the bones of her torso were never found. One or both of her hands were also not found at the crime scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = NamUs UP # 10799 |url = https://identifyus.org/en/cases/10799 |website = identifyus.org |publisher = [[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]] |accessdate = December 14, 2014 |date = November 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her exact race is not known, but she may have been biracial.

Soon after a 2016 review of the case, internet users began referring to her case as the "Fly Creek Jane Doe" case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.darksleuth.com/2017/01/fly-creek-jane-doe-clark-county.html?m=1|title="Fly Creek" Jane Doe - Clark County, Washington 1980|website=www.darksleuth.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, an independent group led by Jason Futch began active research on the Clark County Jane Doe case. Futch had previously ran an independent study on Florida's Lake City John Doe case, with which some of his information had been useful in identifying the John Doe as Fred Paul Laster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lakecityjohndoe.com/|title=THE LAKE CITY JOHN DOE CASE|website=THE LAKE CITY JOHN DOE CASE|language=en|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Putting in some hours and trips to the crime scene, this independent group are currently building a profile on the decedent and a potential suspect in her murder. Additionally, Futch announced that $500 would be rewarded to an individual who could successfully identify this Jane Doe or provide information to Law Enforcement that ultimately leads to her positive identification. Futch is considering raising the reward to $1000 by the end of 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/flycreekjanedoe|title=Who is Fly Creek Jane Doe|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 20, 1984, the nude remains of a woman were found in the [[Spokane River]] in [[Spokane County, Washington]]. Initially believed to be aged between 16 and 30, a further examination conducted in 1998 indicated that she was actually aged between 16 and 35 years old at the time of her death.&lt;ref name="Case File 296UFWA"&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File 296UFWA |url = http://doenetwork.org/cases/296ufwa.html |accessdate = May 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decedent was white, around five feet five inches in height and weighed approximately 130 pounds. She had two prominent moles on her neck, and is known to have suffered from a minor case of [[spina bifida]]. She also had a scar on both her left arm and upon one of her knees. Her body was extensively dismembered, with her head, hands and feet being severed from her body. A separate hand was located around the time of the discovery of her torso, but was determined not to have belonged to the decedent. She is known to have borne at least one child during her life.&lt;ref name="Spokane County Jane Doe"&gt;{{cite web |title = Spokane County Jane Doe |url = http://www.hellbeasts.com/?p=6335 |accessdate = April 30, 2014 |date = February 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her head was not located until 1998, which was matched with the DNA of the victim. She had suffered a blow to the face, which had caused fractures to her skull. Additionally, sharp force trauma was found on the side of the head.

Several reconstructions have been created of Spokane County Jane Doe's face.&lt;ref name="Spokane County Jane Doe"/&gt;

She was estimated to be between the ages of 35 and 50 at the time of her death.

The victim had reddish hair in a perm and her height was approximately five feet five inches. Her weight was between 125 and 135 pounds. The victim had several distinctive scars upon her body; one shaped like the letter "w" on her forehead; and another shaped like the letter "y" on one of her wrists.

It is believed that she had died elsewhere and was disposed of at that location. The victim and her murderer may not have been local to the area where the body was discovered as her body was found near a highway, indicating that her body may have been transported to the location from elsewhere in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Kliese |first1 = Jennifer |title = Columbia County detectives reopen 1982 cold case |url = http://www.wkow.com/story/25537664/2014/05/16/columbia-county-detectives-re-open-1982-cold-case |accessdate = July 3, 2015 |issue = WKOW 21 |publisher = ABC |date = May 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The victim, aged 45 to 65 and most likely white, had been killed by [[blunt-force trauma]] to the skull. She had likely borne at least one child before her death. There was evidence of [[arthritis]] in her neck and back, and this may have affected the way she walked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = NamUs UP # 12533 |url = https://identifyus.org/cases/12533 |website = identifyus.org |publisher = [[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]] |accessdate = July 3, 2015 |date = May 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the degree of decomposition of the body, the hair color, eye color, weight, and complexion of the victim are unknown. However, some details could be assessed. Her height is estimated to be 5 feet 5 to 5 feet 7 inches tall. The victim's dental characteristics were fairly unusual, as the partial denture and crowns in her mouth were said to have been out of the ordinary. No clothing was found at the body disposal site except for a multicolored blouse and size 12 brown pants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File: 1188UFWI |url = http://doenetwork.org/cases/1188ufwi.html |website = doenetwork.org |publisher = [[The Doe Network]] |accessdate = July 3, 2015 |date = October 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was buried in [[Wyocena, Wisconsin]], on September 1, 1987, after her case went cold but her body was later exhumed in April 2014. The remains were transported to [[Virginia]] for additional testing, including [[DNA profiling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Green |first1 = Shannon |title = 1982 town of Caledonia homicide case reopened |url = http://www.wiscnews.com/news/local/article_c4b5e94f-6fd3-5328-8fcb-1095622f63b7.html |accessdate = July 3, 2015 |work = WiscNews |date = May 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the case was reopened and reintroduced to the public eye, tips as to her identity have been submitted to the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Kliese |first1 = Jennifer |title = Tips come in about Columbia Co.

=== Barron County John Doe ===
The skeleton of a young man was discovered by loggers on September 21, 1982, in [[Dallas, Barron County, Wisconsin]]. This decedent is estimated to be between 18 and 24 years old at the time of his death. Basic estimations, such as the height, weight and hair color were later calculated. He was about 5 feet 7 to 5 feet 9 inches tall and likely weighed 180 to 195 pounds, with a large build. Hair found with the body was light brown.

It is believed that the decedent had been [[stabbed]] to death; this was indicated by tears in his western-style plaid shirt. He was also wearing jeans, a denim jacket, and blue shoes with white stripes.

Some distinctive elements as to the victim were also noted. It is possible that he wore glasses, although none were found at the scene. He had received a large amount of dental work in life; this had been performed shortly before he died. He had also had some kind of surgery on his left knee that involved a screw and staple in the [[tibia]]. This kind of surgery would have required an extensive hospitalization period that could have lasted up to six months. Serial numbers on the screw and staple were traced, but this did not lead to the location where they had been purchased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File 168UMWI |url = http://doenetwork.org/cases/168umwi.html |website = doenetwork.org |publisher = [[The Doe Network]] |accessdate = February 18, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vernon County Jane Doe ===
{{Main|Vernon County Jane Doe}}

Vernon County Jane Doe is a woman aged between 50 and 65 years old who was murdered in 1984. She had been killed by [[blunt-force trauma]] to her head. Her hands had been severed from her arms to prevent [[fingerprinting]] and identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Catching her killer: Justice for Jane Doe – Part 1 |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqLMVSHBGOo |accessdate = September 30, 2014 |agency = WKBT TV |date = May 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== St. Croix County Jane Doe ===
The skull of a woman aged 35 to 60 years was found in an advanced stage of decomposition on October 21, 2002. She had been dead for approximately one year before her skull was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File: 406UFWI |url = http://doenetwork.org/cases/406ufwi.html |website = doenetwork.org |publisher = [[The Doe Network]] |accessdate = February 18, 2015 |date = January 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The skull had been placed in a garbage bag, which was disposed of near Anderson Scout Camp Road, where it was later discovered by [[Scouting|Boy Scouts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = NamUs UP # 9106 |url = https://identifyus.org/cases/9106 |website = identifyus.org |publisher = [[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]] |accessdate = February 18, 2015 |date = August 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The woman had dark brown hair, no teeth, and may have been of [[mixed race]]. Examination of the skull indicated that she may have had a mental disability. She may also have had "different looking" features, such as wide-set eyes and a flat nose. She may have been living in a [[group home]], as her condition may have been severe.

The nude body of a white female was discovered on March 1, 1992 in [[Sweetwater County, Wyoming]]. The decedent's body is believed to have been discarded at the location of her discovery approximately one month prior, although due to the cold weather, her body was well preserved. She was between 24 and 32 years of age, and between five feet six and five feet eight inches in height.&lt;ref name="leb.fbi.gov"&gt;{{cite web |title = Unidentified Human Remains – Sweetwater County, Wyoming |url = http://leb.fbi.gov/2014/may/vicap-alert |publisher = [[FBI Victims Identification Project]] |accessdate = June 30, 2014 |date = May 6, 2014 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140714145742/http://leb.fbi.gov/2014/may/vicap-alert |archivedate = July 14, 2014 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; She had a scar from a [[Caesarean section]] on her abdomen as well as a tattoo of a rose beneath one of her breasts. At the crime scene, a golden-appearing necklace and ring, sweatpants and pink underwear were found.&lt;ref name="Case File: 213UFWY"&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File: 213UFWY |url = http://doenetwork.org/cases/213ufwy.html |publisher = [[The Doe Network]] |accessdate = June 30, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (After images of the victim's tattoo were published throughout the United States, a man came forward claiming that he had performed the tattoo on the woman. This man claimed that she was Hispanic, lacking any discernible accent, and was likely a drifter who hitchhiked frequently around the country.)

Later [[genetic testing]] would also determine the woman was of possible Hispanic and European descent.&lt;ref name="Wyoming Bureau of Investigation"&gt;{{cite web |title = The Wyoming Missing and Unidentified |url = http://wymissingandunidentified.com/featuredcase.html |publisher = Wyoming Bureau of Investigation |accessdate = June 30, 2014 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://archive.is/20140702112230/http://wymissingandunidentified.com/featuredcase.html |archivedate = July 2, 2014 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This unidentified decedent is also known as "Rose Doe".

The woman had died from being stabbed through one of the nostrils, having also been strangled and beaten, likely at another location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Sweetwater Wyoming Jane Doe March 1992 |url = http://canyouidentifyme.org/SweetwaterWyomingJaneDoeMarch1992 |website = canyouidentifyme.org |accessdate = June 30, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Unidentified Female"&gt;{{cite web |title = Unidentified Female |url = http://wymissingandunidentified.com/poster/poster03011992.jpg |publisher = Wyoming Bureau of Investigation |accessdate = June 30, 2014 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140714151400/http://wymissingandunidentified.com/poster/poster03011992.jpg |archivedate = July 14, 2014 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; She had also been sexually assaulted both anally and vaginally prior to her murder.

Multiple missing persons have been ruled out as possible identities of Bitter Creek Betty. Apart from this victim, two other decedents from the area also remain unidentified.

=== Sheridan County Jane Doe ===
A female aged 16 to 21 was discovered murdered on April 13, 1992 in [[Sheridan County, Wyoming]]. DNA from the scene was eventually matched to that found at the site of Bitter Creek Betty's body. Unlike the previous victim, the body of this decedent was too decomposed to identify visually and her eye color could not be determined. The cause of her death was ruled as [[blunt force trauma]] to the head. She was white, five feet five to five feet six inches tall, 110 to 115 pounds and had brown hair with a wavy texture. It is believed that she was murdered at a different area than where her body was discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Case File: 390UFWY |url = http://doenetwork.org/cases/390ufwy.html |website = doenetwork.org |publisher = [[The Doe Network]] |accessdate = July 13, 2015 |date = March 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The victim's clothing consisted of a patterned white and light blue top that had ties underneath the bust, with pearl and jewel-like buttons. The female also wore a bra, blue jeans, pink underwear and brass earrings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = NamUs UP # 9970 |url = https://identifyus.org/cases/9970 |website = identifyus.org |publisher = [[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]] |accessdate = July 13, 2015 |date = March 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saint Lorenzo Ruiz''' ({{lang-fil|San Lorenzo Ruiz ng Maynila}}; {{lang-es|San Lorenzo Ruiz de Manila}}; {{lang-la|Laurentius Ruiz Manilensis}}; ca. 1600 – 29 September 1637) is a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[saint]] venerated in the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. A [[Chinese-Filipino]], he became the country's [[protomartyr]] after his execution in [[Japan]] by the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]] during its persecution of [[Kirishitan|Japanese Christians]] in the 17th century.

Saint Lorenzo is [[patron saint]] of, among others, the Philippines and the Filipino people.

==Early life==
[[File:001-binondochurch.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Binondo Church, the main shrine of St Lorenzo Ruiz]]
Lorenzo Ruiz was born in [[Binondo]], [[Manila]], to a [[China|Chinese]] father and a Filipino mother who were both [[Roman Catholicism in the Philippines|Catholic]]. His father taught him [[Chinese language|Chinese]] while his mother taught him [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]].&lt;ref name=Press&gt;"Visit of Her Excellency President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] to Participate in the [[2005 World Summit]] - High Level [[plenary session]] of the 60th Session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]], New York, [[United States of America]], 12–15 September 2005", [[Mass media|Press]] Kit, Office of the President, Government Mass Media Group, Bureau of Communications Services, [[Manila]], September, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dominguez&gt;[http://religion-cults.com/saints/september29.htm Religion-Cults.com Dominguez, J, M.D., September 29: Saints of the Day, Saint Lorenzo Ruiz and Companions, 1600-1637, Religion-Cults.com], retrieved on: 10 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruiz served as an [[altar boy]] at the Binondo Church. After being educated by the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friars for a few years, Ruiz earned the title of ''escribano'' ([[calligraphy|calligrapher]]) because of his skillful [[penmanship]]. He became a member of the ''Cofradia del Santísimo Rosario'' ([[Confraternity of the Rosary|Confraternity of the Most Holy Rosary]]). He married Rosario, a native, and they had two sons and a daughter.&lt;ref name=foley&gt;[http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Saints/saint.aspx?id=1146 Foley O.F.M., Leonard. ''Saint of the Day, Lives, Lessons and Feast'', (revised by Pat McCloskey O.F.M), Franciscan Media]&lt;/ref&gt; The Ruiz family led a generally peaceful, religious and content life.

In 1636, whilst working as a clerk for the Binondo Church, Ruiz was falsely accused of killing a [[Spaniard]]. Ruiz sought [[right to asylum|asylum]] on board a ship with three [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] priests: Saint [[Antonio Gonzalez]], Saint Guillermo Courtet, and Saint Miguel de Aozaraza; a [[Japan]]ese priest, Saint Vicente Shiwozuka de la Cruz; and a [[layman|lay]] [[leper]] Saint Lázaro of Kyoto. Ruiz and his companions sailed for [[Okinawa]] on 10 June 1636, with the aid of the Dominican fathers.&lt;ref name=Press/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dominguez/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lorenzo&gt;[http://www.chapelofsanlorenzoruiz.org Filipino Apostolate/Archdiocese of New York, Chapel of San Lorenzo Ruiz, ChapelofSanLorenzoRuiz.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120120844/http://www.chapelofsanlorenzoruiz.org/ |date=2008-11-20 }}, retrieved on: 9 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Martyrdom==
[[File:Lorenzojf.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Image of Ruiz, with a red sash indicating his status as a martyr, in the ''[[parish house|convento]]'' of St James the Apostle Parish, [[Plaridel, Bulacan]].]]

The [[Tokugawa Shogunate]] was [[Martyrs of Japan|persecuting Christians]] by the time Ruiz had arrived in Japan. The missionaries were arrested and thrown into prison, and after two years, they were transferred to [[Nagasaki]] to face trial by torture. The group endured many and various cruel methods of torture.&lt;ref name=foley/&gt;

On 27 September 1637, Ruiz and his companions were taken to Nishizaka Hill, where they were tortured by being hung upside-down over a pit. This form of torture was known as ''[[tsurushi]]'' (釣殺し) in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] or ''horca y hoya'' ("[[gallows]] and pit") in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The method, alleged to have been extremely painful, had the victim bound; one hand was always left free so that the individual may signal their desire to recant, leading to their release. Despite his suffering, Ruiz refused to renounce Christianity and died from eventual [[exsanguination|blood loss]] and suffocation. His body was cremated, with the ashes thrown into the sea.&lt;ref name=Press/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dominguez/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lorenzo/&gt;

According to Latin missionary accounts sent back to Manila, Ruiz declared these words upon his death:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;''Ego Catholicus sum et animo prompto paratoque pro Deo mortem obibo.
Si mille vitas haberem, cunctas ei offerrem.''

(I am a Catholic and wholeheartedly do accept death for God;
Had I a thousand lives, all these to Him shall I offer.)&lt;ref name=foley/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

=== Cause of beatification and canonization===
The ''Positio Super Introductione Causae'' or the cause of beatification of Saint Lorenzo Ruiz was written by respected historian, Fr. [[Fidel Villarroel]], O.P.  Ruiz was beatified during [[Pope John Paul II]]'s papal visit to the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azheepineda.skyrock.com/2743815476-UST-Archives-director-Fr-Fidel-Villarroel-O-P-Master-key-to-UST-s-past.html|title=UST Archives director Fr.

San Lorenzo Ruiz was [[canonized]] by the same pope in the Vatican City on 18 October 1987, making him the first Filipino saint.&lt;ref name=Press/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dominguez/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lorenzo/&gt;

====Miracle====
His canonization was supported by a miracle in October 1983, when Cecilia Algeria Policarpio of [[Calinog, Iloilo]], was cured of brain atrophy ([[hydrocephalus]]) at the age of two, after her family and supporters prayed to Ruiz for his intercession. She was diagnosed with the condition shortly after birth and was treated at [[University of the East Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Medical Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepinoycatholic.blogspot.com/2009/06/st-lorenzo-ruiz.html|title=The Pinoy Catholic: St. Lorenzo Ruiz|author=The Pinoy Catholic|work=thepinoycatholic.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The face of Marjorie Bruce on her tomb, Paisley Abbey.jpg|thumb|265px|The face of Marjorie Bruce on her tomb, [[Paisley Abbey]]]]
'''Marjorie Bruce''' or '''Marjorie de Brus''' (probably 1296&amp;ndash;1316) was the eldest daughter of [[Robert the Bruce]], [[List of Scottish monarchs|King of Scots]] by his first wife, [[Isabella of Mar]]. (Six years after Isabella's death, Robert married [[Elizabeth de Burgh]].)

Marjorie's marriage to [[Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland|Walter, High Steward of Scotland]] gave rise to the [[House of Stuart|House of Stewart]]. Her son was the first Stewart monarch, King [[Robert II of Scotland]].

==Early life==
[[File:Robert I and Isabella of Mar.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Marjorie's parents, as depicted in the 1562 Forman Armorial]]
Her mother, Isabella, was a noblewoman from the [[Clan Mar]]. Soon after giving birth to Marjorie, at the age of 19, Isabella died.&lt;ref name=alba&gt;[http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandshistory/warsofindependence/elizabethdeburgh/index.asp "Elizabeth de Burgh and Marjorie Bruce". Foghlam Alba] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711203416/http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandshistory/warsofindependence/elizabethdeburgh/index.asp |date=11 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marjorie's father was at that time the [[Earl of Carrick]], and Marjorie was named after her father's mother, [[Marjorie, Countess of Carrick]].

According to legend, Marjorie's parents had been very much in love, and Robert the Bruce did not remarry until Marjorie was 6 years old. In 1302, a [[courtier]] named [[Elizabeth de Burgh]] became her [[stepmother]].

On 27 March 1306, her father was crowned King of Scots at [[Scone, Perthshire]],&lt;ref name=alba/&gt; and Marjorie, then 9 years old, became a [[Princess of Scotland]].

==Imprisonment (1307–1314)==
[[File:Watton Abbey.jpg|thumb|The Priory of [[Watton, East Riding of Yorkshire|Watton]], where Marjorie was imprisoned under [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]]]
Three months after the coronation, in June, 1306, her father was defeated at the [[Battle of Methven]]. He sent his wife, two sisters, and Marjorie north with his supporter [[Isabella MacDuff, Countess of Buchan]], but by the end of June they were captured by [[Uilleam II, Earl of Ross]], a [[John Balliol|Balliol]] supporter, who handed them over to the English.&lt;ref name=alba/&gt;

As punishment, [[Edward I of England]] sent his hostages to different places in [[Kingdom of England|England]]. Princess Marjorie went to the [[convent]] at [[Watton, East Riding of Yorkshire|Watton]]; her aunt [[Christina Bruce]] was sent to another convent; Queen Elizabeth was placed under [[house arrest]] at a [[manor house]] in [[Yorkshire]] (because Edward I needed the support of her father, the powerful [[Richard Óg de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster|Earl of Ulster]], her punishment was lighter than the others'); and Marjorie's aunt [[Mary Bruce]] and the Countess of Buchan were imprisoned in wooden cages, exposed to public view, at [[Roxburgh Castle]] and [[Berwick Castle]], respectively. For the next four years, Marjorie, Elizabeth, Christina, Mary, and Isabella endured [[solitary confinement]], with daily public humiliation for the latter two. A cage was built for Marjorie at the [[Tower of London]], but Edward I reconsidered and instead sent her to the convent.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Ronald McNair, Robert the Bruce, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=traquair&gt;Traquair, Peter ''Freedom's Sword&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Seton, Christina's husband, was executed.

Edward I died on 7 July 1307. He was succeeded by his son, [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], who subsequently held Marjorie captive in a convent for about seven more years. She was finally set free around 1314, probably in [[Hostage exchange|exchange]] for English noblemen captured after the [[Battle of Bannockburn]].

==Marriage and death==
[[File:Paisley abbey.jpg|thumb|175px|Paisley Abbey]]
[[Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland]] distinguished himself in the battle and was rewarded the hand of the adolescent princess. Her [[dowry]] included the [[Baron]]y of [[Bathgate]] in [[West Lothian]]. &lt;ref name=traquair/&gt;

The traditional story is that two years later, on 2 March 1316, Marjorie was [[Equestrianism|riding]] in Gallowhill, [[Paisley, Scotland|Paisley]], [[Renfrewshire]] while heavily [[pregnant]]. Her horse was suddenly startled and threw her to the ground.  She went into [[premature labour]] and her child, Robert, was born. Marjorie died soon afterward at the age of around 20, like her mother, who was roughly the same age when she died in childbirth.  However, it is not clear that this traditional story is correct; some accounts indicate that she may have survived into 1317. &lt;ref&gt;Broadman, Stephen ''The Early Stewart Kings''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Penman, Michael, ''Robert the Bruce, King of the Scots''&lt;/ref&gt; (She may still have died in a riding accident, but this could have taken place after the birth of her son.)

At the junction of Renfrew Road and Dundonald Road in Paisley, a [[cairn]] marks the spot called "the Knock", near where Marjorie reputedly fell from her horse. Bruce Road and Marjorie Drive are named in her honour. She is buried at Paisley Abbey.

Her son succeeded his childless uncle [[David II of Scotland]] in 1371 as [[Robert II of Scotland|King Robert II]]. Her descendants include the [[House of Stuart]] (or Stewart) and all their successors on the throne of [[Scotland]], [[England]]  and the [[United Kingdom]].

As defined by the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]], '''military sexual trauma''' ('''MST''') are experiences of [[sexual assault]], or repeated threatening [[sexual harassment]] that occurred while a person was in the [[United States Armed Forces]].

== Use and definition ==
Military sexual trauma is used by the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA) and defined in [[federal law]]&lt;ref&gt;Counseling and treatment for sexual trauma, 38 U.S.C. § 1720D(a)(1), https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/1720D (defining "sexual trauma").&lt;/ref&gt; as "[[psychological trauma]], which in the judgment of a VA [[mental health professional]], resulted from a physical assault of a sexual nature, battery of a sexual nature, or sexual harassment which occurred while the Veteran was serving on active duty, active duty for training, or inactive duty training".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women at war|last=Ritchie|first=Elspeth Cameron|last2=Naclerio|first2=Anne L|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=0199344558|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual harassment "... means repeated, unsolicited verbal or physical contact of a sexual nature which is threatening in character".&lt;ref&gt;38 U.S.C. § 1720D(f), https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/1720D#f&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The behavior may include physical force, threats of negative consequences, implied promotion, promises of favored treatment, or intoxication of either the perpetrator or the victim or both.

{{Further|Sexual harassment in the military}}

==Prevalence==

Military sexual trauma is a serious issue faced by the [[United States armed forces]]. In 2012, 13,900 men and 12,100 women who were active duty service members reported unwanted sexual contact&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Department of Defense (2012) http://www.ncdsv.org/images/DoD_Active-duty-service-members-reporting-unwanted-sexual-contact.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; while in 2016, 10,600 men and 9,600 women reported being sexually assaulted.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Department of Defense Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military Fiscal Year 2015 (2016). Retrieved from http://www.sapr.mil/public/docs/reports/FY15_Annual/FY15_Annual_Report_on_Sexual_Assault_in_the_Military.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Further, there were 5,240 official reports of sexual assault involving service members as victims in 2016; however, it is estimated that 77% of service member sexual assaults go unreported.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  More specifically, prevalence of MST among veterans returning from [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] (OEF) in Afghanistan and [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] (OIF) in Iraq, was reported to be as high as 15.1% among females and 0.7% among males.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Department of Defense Task Force on Sexual Violence. (2004) Sexual Harassment Survey of Reserve Component Members. Available at http://www.ncdsv.org/images/DOD_SexualHarassmentSurveyReserveComponentMembers_2004.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted in 2014, 196 female veterans who had deployed to OIF and/or OEF were interviewed and 41% of them reported experiencing MST.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Defense (2014). Demographics. Profile of the Military Community. Retrieved from http://download.militaryonesource.mil/12038/MOS/Reports/2014-Demographics-Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of these and similar findings, 17 former service members filed a lawsuit in 2010 accusing the Department of Defense of allowing a military culture that fails to prevent rapes and sexual assaults.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  According to the Department of Defense Task Force on Sexual Violence (2004)&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; perpetrators of sexual assault were often male, serving in the military, and knew the victim well.

==Reporting==

Currently, the U.S. military allows victims of MST to make either restricted or unrestricted reports of sexual assault. This two tier system includes restricted (anonymous) and unrestricted reporting. A restricted report, allows victims to receive access to counseling and medical resources without disclosing their assault to authorities or seeking litigation against the perpetrator(s). This is different from an unrestricted report which involves seeking criminal charges against the perpetrator, eliminating anonymity.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Conrad, P.L., Young, C., Hogan, L., &amp; Armstrong, M.L. (2014). Encountering women veterans with military sexual trauma. Perspectives in Psychiatric Care, 50, 280-286&lt;/ref&gt; The restricted reporting option is meant to reduce negative social consequences suffered by MST survivors, increase MST reporting and in doing so improve the accuracy of information concerning MST prevalence.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;
According to the DOD Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military (2016)&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; in 2015, there were 4,584 Unrestricted Reports involving Service members as either victims or subjects and 1,900 Restricted Reports involving Service members as either victims or subjects. The Services do not investigate Restricted Reports and do not record the identities of alleged perpetrators.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Service members who experience MST are eligible for medical care, mental healthcare, legal services, and spiritual support related to MST through the VA.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; 

U.S. military members appear to fear repercussions, retaliation, and the stigma associated with reporting MST.  The reasons service members do not report military sexual assaults include concerns about confidentiality, wanting to "move on", not wanting to seem "weak", fear about career repercussions, fear of [[Social stigma|stigmatization]], and worry about retaliation by superiors and fellow service members.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Greene-Shortridge, T.M., Britt, T..W., &amp; Castro, C.A. (2007). The stigma of mental health problems in the military. Military Medicine, 172(2), 157-161&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, survivors of MST may believe that nothing will be done if they report a sexual assault, they may blame themselves, and/or they may fear for their reputation.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; 

===Effects of stigma on reporting rates===

Stigma is a significant deterrent to reporting MST. Many military service members do not report sexual abuse due to fear about not being believed, worry about career impact, fear of retribution, or because their victimization will be minimized with comments such as "suck it up".&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;Valente, S. &amp; Wright, C. (2007). Military Sexual Trauma: Violence and Sexual Abuse. Military Medicine, 172 (3), 259-265&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, perceived stigma associated with seeking mental health treatment after experiencing MST affects reporting.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;  Service members often do not disclose any type of trauma (sexual assault or battlefield trauma) until asked specifically by a mental health professional due to mental health stigma, worry about career difficulties, or because they wish to preserve their masculine image.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, N. B., &amp; Bruce, S. E. (2015). Stigma, Career Worry, and Mental Illness Symptomatology: Factors Influencing Treatment-Seeking for Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom Soldiers and Veterans. Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, And Policy, doi:10.1037/tra0000082.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;  

Additionally, reporting MST sometimes results in an individual being diagnosed with a personality disorder, resulting in a discharge other than honorable, and reducing access to benefits from the VA or state.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;Human Rights Watch. Booted. Lack of Recourse for wrongfully discharged US military rape survivors. (2016). https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/report_pdf/us0516_militaryweb_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A diagnosis of a personality disorder also discounts or minimizes the credibility of the victim and may result in stigmatization by the civilian community. Many survivors of MST report that they experience rejection from the military and feel incompetent after an Unrestricted Report.&lt;ref name="auto7"&gt;Northcut, T.B., &amp; Kienow, A. (2014). The trauma trifecta of military sexual trauma: A case study illustrating the integration of mind and body in clinical work with survivors of MST. Clinical Social Work, 42, 247-259. DOI 10.1007/s10615-014-0479-0&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consequences of reporting===

In spite of increased access to medical and mental health resources there are also important drawbacks to unrestricted reports of MST. MST survivors often report a loss of professional and personal identity. They are also at increased risk of re-traumatization and retaliation through the process of getting help. Service members may experience re-traumatization through blame, misdiagnosis, and being questioned about the validity of their experience.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;  Retaliation from reporting a sexual complaint may have distressing consequences for the victim and weakens the respectful culture of the military. Retaliation can refer to reprisal, ostracism, maltreatment or abusive behavior by co-workers, exclusion by peers, or disruption of their career. The Department of Defense Task Force on Sexual Violence (2004)&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; reported that unkind gossip was the most common problem that members experienced at work in response to a MST report. In 2015, 68% of survivors reported at least one negative experience associated with their report of sexual assault.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
The Department of Defense Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military (2016)&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; indicates that approximately 61% of retaliation reports involved a man or multiple men as alleged retaliators, while nearly 27% of reports included multiple men and women as retaliators. The majority (73%) of retaliators were not the alleged perpetrator of the associated sexual assault or sexual harassment. More than half (58%) of the alleged retaliators were in the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] of the reporter, followed by peers, co-workers, friends, or family members of the reporter, or a superior not in the reporters chain of command. Infrequently (7%), the alleged sexual perpetrator was also the alleged retaliator.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

85% of the members of the military are active duty and male. Although more men than women in the military experience sexual assault, a larger proportion of female victims report their assault to military authorities.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; In 2004, of service members who said they reported their experiences, 33% of women and 28% of men were satisfied with the complaint outcome, meaning approximately two thirds of women and men were dissatisfied.  Service members who felt satisfied with the outcome of their report indicated that the situation was corrected, the outcome of the report was explained to them, and some action was taken against the offender. Service members who were dissatisfied with the outcome reported that nothing was done about their complaint.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Since changes in reporting standards were implemented in 2012, military sexual assault reporting has increased significantly.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Since this change, most service members report instances of MST to their direct supervisor, another person in their chain of command, or the offender's supervisor, rather than to a military special office or civilian authority.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

Individuals who make a report and deny mental health evaluations could be given a dishonorable discharge for making false allegations. Therefore, victims are sent the message to "keep quiet and deal with it" rather than reporting the assault and possibly losing their career and military benefits.  In fact, 23% of women and 15% of men reported that action was taken against them because of their complaint.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Additionally, according to an investigation by the Human Rights Watch in 2016,&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt; many survivors reported they received more disciplinary notices, were seen as "troublemakers", assigned undesirable shift assignments, were intimidated by [[drill sergeant]]s, were threatened by peers with comments such as "you got what you deserved", and were socially isolated and further assaulted due to fear of more retaliation after an initial report. 

==Psychological/physiological difficulties==
===General===
Service members who experiencing a MST may experience increased emotional and physical distress as well as feelings of shame, hopelessness, and betrayal. Some of the psychological experiences of both male and female survivors include: [[depression (mood)|depression]], symptoms of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), [[mood disorder]]s, [[dissociative reaction]]s, isolation from others, and self-harm. Medical symptoms survivors have experienced include sexual difficulties, [[chronic pain]], weight gain, and gastrointestinal problems.&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto8"&gt;U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs National Center for PTSD. (2015). Military Sexual Trauma. Retrieved from http://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/types/violence/military-sexual-trauma-general.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; 

===Sexual minorities===
According to research, reports of MST have been shown to be higher among veteran populations compared to current active duty personnel and DoD estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suris|first=Alina|last2=Lind|first2=Lisa|date=2008|title=Military Sexual Trauma|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1524838008324419|journal=Trauma, Violence, &amp; Abuse|volume=9|issue=4|pages=250–269|doi=10.1177/1524838008324419|issn=1524-8380|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically within the lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) veteran community, who are significantly more likely to have experienced military sexual assault (MSA) (32.7% of combined female and male veterans) than non-LGB veterans (16.4%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lucas|first=Carrie L.|last2=Goldbach|first2=Jeremy T.|last3=Mamey|first3=Mary Rose|last4=Kintzle|first4=Sara|last5=Castro|first5=Carl Andrew|date=2018|title=Military Sexual Assault as a Mediator of the Association Between Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Depression Among Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Veterans|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jts.22308|journal=Journal of Traumatic Stress|language=en|volume=31|issue=4|pages=613–619|doi=10.1002/jts.22308|issn=0894-9867|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Jen|date=2017|title=Mental health and military service by sexual orientation among young Swiss men|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckx187.047|journal=European Journal of Public Health|volume=27|issue=suppl_3|pages=|doi=10.1093/eurpub/ckx187.047|issn=1101-1262|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpersonal difficulties==

MST is a significant predictor of interpersonal difficulties post-deployment.&lt;ref name="auto9"&gt;Mondragon, S.A., Wang, D., Pritchett, L., Graham, D.P., Plasencia, M.L., Teng, E.J. (2015). The influence of military sexual trauma on returning OEF/OIF male veterans. Psychological Services, 12(4), 402-411&lt;/ref&gt; Holland and colleagues (2015)&lt;ref name="auto10"&gt;Holland, K.J., Rabelo, V.C., &amp; Cortina, L.M. (2015). Collateral damage: Military sexual trauma and help-seeking barriers. Psychology of Violence, 1-9.  doi: https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0039467&lt;/ref&gt; found that survivors who perceived greater logistical barriers to obtaining mental health care reported more symptoms of depression and PTSD. Particularly for women veterans, PTSD and suicide are major concerns.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Males experiencing MST are associated with greater PTSD symptom severity, greater depression symptom severity, higher suicidality, and higher outpatient mental health treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Schry, A.R., Hibberd, R., Wagner, H.R., Turchik, J.A., Kimbrel, N.A., Wong, M.,…&amp; Strauss, J.L. (2015). Veterans Affairs Mid-Atlantic Mental Illness Research, Education and Clinical Center Workgroup, &amp; Brancu, M&lt;/ref&gt; In general, male veterans who report experiencing MST are younger, less likely to be currently married, more likely to be diagnosed with a mood disorder, and more likely to have experienced non-MST sexual abuse either as children or adults than military members who have not been victimized.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt; However, the strongest predictor of any of these negative mental health outcomes, for either gender, includes anticipating public stigma (i.e., worrying about being blamed for the assault).&lt;ref name="auto10"/&gt;

== Treatment services ==

'''Oliver Hillhouse Prince''' (1787{{spaced ndash}}October 9, 1837) was an editor, attorney and politician, elected as [[United States Senator]] by the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] state legislature in 1828. Born in Connecticut, he had migrated as a child with his parents to Georgia, where he grew up. After working as a journalist and attorney, he was elected to the state senate. He prepared ''A Digest of the Laws of the State of Georgia'' (1822), for 30 years the most important collection of the laws.

In 1830 Prince left the law to become editor of the ''Georgia Journal,'' returning to early work in journalism. With his multi-faceted career, he was describe as "one of the brilliant figures of Georgia in the first half of the nineteenth century".&lt;ref name="northen"/&gt; He and his wife died on October 9, 1837 in the wreck of the ''[[SS Home]],'' grounded near [[Ocracoke Inlet]], [[North Carolina]], during [[Racer's Storm]]. This was the first hurricane recorded as attacking both the Gulf and Atlantic coasts.&lt;ref name="wilkes"/&gt;

==Early life, education and marriage==
Born in [[Montville, Connecticut]] in 1787, Oliver Hillhouse Prince completed his first studies locally. In 1796 he moved with his parents to Georgia, where they settled in [[Washington, Georgia|Washington]], [[Wilkes County, Georgia|Wilkes County]]. His mother's Hillhouse family included ancestors who were judges and her brother [[James Hillhouse]] was a US Senator. Oliver's maternal uncle David Hillhouse had already settled in the state when his parents moved there.&lt;ref name="northen"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Rg8ZD0XhkRMC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Men of Mark in Georgia''], Volume 2, edited by William J. Northen, John Temple Graves, Georgia: A. B. Caldwell, 1910/1974 reprint&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince later engaged in newspaper work as an assistant editor for ''The Monitor,'' a Wilkes County newspaper, from 1803 to 1806.&lt;ref name="wilkes"/&gt; Tradition has it that Prince wrote many humorous articles as a young man during this period. But in files of the Monitor, there are no humorous articles attributed to Prince. In fact, nowhere in the surviving issues of the paper is there any other item that might fairly be described as a "humorous sketch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rachels|first1=David A.|title=Oliver Hillhouse Prince, Augustus Baldwin Longstreet, and the birth of American literary realism[a]|journal=Mississippi Quarterly|date=1998|volume=51|issue=4|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=f5h&amp;AN=1859760&amp;site=eds-live|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was described by 20th-century historians as "remarkably gifted with the literary instinct which he possessed with the most delicious sense of humor."&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Coleman and Charles Currin, editors, ''Dictionary of Georgia Biography'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he "read the law." At age 19 in 1806, he gained admission to the [[bar (law)|bar]] by special act of the legislature, as he was under age.&lt;ref name="northen"/&gt; He began his practice in [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]].

In 1817 Prince married Mary Ross Norman of [[Lincoln County, Georgia]], who was eighteen,&lt;ref name="wilkes"&gt;[http://digitalcommons.law.uga.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1035&amp;context=fac_pm Donald E. Wilkes Jr., "The Eponymous Mr. Prince, Parts 1 and 2"], ''Popular Media,'' Paper 35, Digital Commons, University of Georgia Law (2000), accessed 19 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; a typical age of marriage for young Georgia women. Their first two children died young in 1822, and they moved to newly established [[Bibb County, Georgia]]. They had three more children: Virginia (b. 1825), another daughter and son Oliver H. Prince, Jr.&lt;ref name="wilkes"/&gt;

==Legal and political career==
Prince became active in politics as an adult. As an attorney, he traveled around Georgia's Northern Circuit for 16 years with circuit judges for court sessions in log cabins and other makeshift sites throughout the state. His work helped him establish a broad network.

In 1819 he was commissioned by the state legislature to compile a digest of Georgia law. After two years of research and work, he produced ''A Digest of the Laws of the State of Georgia'' (1822). It quickly was put into use and is considered a classic, filled with notes, a list of repealed statutes and a valuable discussion of ''[[habeas corpus]]''. A second and larger edition was published in 1837 after his death.&lt;ref name="wilkes"/&gt; His work was considered a landmark achievement. It was the "most important collection of Georgia laws until 1851," when [[Thomas R.R. Cobb]] published a new compilation.&lt;ref name="wilkes"/&gt;

In early 1823 Prince was one of five [[commissioner]]s selected to lay out the town of Macon.&lt;ref name="wilkes"/&gt; He was elected to the [[Georgia Senate|State senate]] in 1824.

In 1828 he was elected by the state legislature to the U.S. Senate in a special election to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of [[Thomas W. Cobb]]. He served from November 7, 1828 to March 3, 1829 as a [[Jacksonian Democrat]], supporting the president in the [[Indian Removal Act]] of 1830. This authorized the government to remove the tribes especially from the Southeast to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. All the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] were affected in this removal, and they lost many members in the harsh conditions of their journeys.

==Later years==
Prince later worked again as an editor. He presided over the first railroad convention in Georgia, and was one of the first stockholders and directors of the [[Georgia Railroad]], critical to developing infrastructure in the state.&lt;ref name="wilkes"/&gt;

He abandoned the practice of law in 1832 and moved with his wife to [[Milledgeville, Georgia|Milledgeville]], then the state capital. He purchased and became the editor of the ''[[Georgia Journal]],'' an influential newspaper.&lt;ref name="wilkes"/&gt;

He sold the journal in 1835, retiring with his family at the age of 48 to a 450-acre farm he bought in [[Athens, Georgia]]. Their son Oliver, Jr. attended a preparatory school in [[Gwinnett County, Georgia]].&lt;ref name="wilkes"/&gt;

Prince and his wife left in May 1837 for a trip to New York and Boston, where he worked with his publisher for some months preparing the second edition of his ''Law Digest'' for publication. They missed their children and were looking forward to their return. After sailing from New York on October 7, 1837, both Prince and his wife died in the wreck of the steam [[packet ship]] ''[[SS Home]],'' which was caught in [[Racer's Storm]], a destructive hurricane that hit both the Gulf and Atlantic coasts. Although the ship had been converted for ocean going, it carried only three lifeboats and two life preservers. It grounded near [[Ocracoke Inlet]], [[North Carolina]] on October 8, 1837 and broke up the next day. The ship was 537 tons, 220 feet long and 22 feet wide. The remains of the estimated 90 victims, mostly women and children, were never recovered.&lt;ref name="wilkes"/&gt; Years later, the three Prince children erected a cenotaph in [[Rose Hill Cemetery (Macon, Georgia)|Rose Hill Cemetery]] in Macon in their parents' honor.&lt;ref name="wilkes"/&gt;

==Legacy and honors==
*Prince's most famous sketch was published anonymously in ''The Monitor'' on June 6, 1807, but it was reprinted, translated into several foreign languages, and published in [[Augustus Baldwin Longstreet]]'s ''Georgia Scenes'' (1835), which went through several editions in the 19th century. Most famously, the sketch of Captain Clodpole and his Georgia militia recruits is believed to have been plagiarized by the British author [[Thomas Hardy]] in his ''The Trumpet Major'' (1888), in a chapter on an English rural militia. Such charges were ignored and then denied by Hardy but critics think the similarities are too strong to be coincidence.&lt;ref name="wilkes"/&gt; 
*In 1859 Prince Avenue, the section of the [[Federal Road (Cherokee lands)|Federal Road]] west of downtown in Athens, Georgia, was named for him. It had led from town to his plantation. Later in the road's development, it was described as "once one of the nation's finest boulevards."&lt;ref&gt;Frances Taliaferro Thomas, ''A Portrait of Historic Athens and Clarke County'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Personality systematics''' is a contribution to the psychology of [[personality theory|personality]] and to [[psychological counselling|psychotherapy]] summarized by Jeffrey J. Magnavita in 2006 and 2009.&lt;ref name="rfs"&gt;Magnavita, Jeffrey J. (2009) Psychodynamic Family Psychotherapy: Toward Unified Relational Systematics. In Bray, James H., Stanton, Mark (Eds.) ''The Wiley-Blackwell Handbook of Family Psychology''. John Wiley and Sons, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-6994-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magnavita, Jeffrey J. (2006) ''Treating personality disorders'' [American Psychological Association Videotape]. Washington, DC: American Psychological Association&lt;/ref&gt; It is the study of the interrelationships among [[subsystems]] of personality as they are embedded in the entire [[ecological systems|ecological system]]. The model falls into the category of complex,  [[biopsychosocial model|biopsychosocial]] approaches to personality. The term personality systematics was originally coined by [[William Grant Dahlstrom]] in 1972.&lt;ref name="rfsa"&gt;Dahlstrom, William Grant (1972) ''Personality systematics and the problem of types''. General Learning Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
Systems psychology has emerged here as a new approach in which groups and individuals, are considered as [[systems]] in [[homeostasis]]. Within [[Open system (systems theory)|open system]]s they have an active method of remaining stable through the dynamic relationship between parts.&lt;ref name="rfs" /&gt; A classic example of this homeostatic dynamic is the "problem behavior" of a bed wetting child having a stabilizing function of holding a troubled marriage together because the attention of the parents is drawn away from their conflict towards the "problem" child.

More recent developments in systems psychology have challenged this understanding of homeostasis as being too focused on causal understanding of systems. This change in thought from 1st order [[cybernetics]] to [[Second-order cybernetics|2nd order cybernetics]] involved a [[postmodern]] shift in understanding of reality as [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] to being socially and linguistically [[Constructivist epistemology|constructed]].

[[Family systems therapy]] received an important boost in the mid-1950s through the work of anthropologist [[Gregory Bateson]] and colleagues – [[Jay Haley]], [[Donald D. Jackson]], [[John Weakland]], William Fry, and later, [[Virginia Satir]], [[Paul Watzlawick]] and others – at Palo Alto in the US, who introduced ideas from cybernetics and general systems theory into social psychology and psychotherapy, focusing in particular on the role of communication. This approach eschewed the traditional focus on individual psychology and historical factors – that involve so-called linear causation and content – and emphasized instead feedback and homeostatic mechanisms and “rules” in here-and-now interactions – so-called circular causation and process – that were thought to maintain or exacerbate problems, whatever the original cause(s).

[[Relational psychoanalysis]]&lt;ref name="rfsm"&gt;Greenberg, Jay R., Mitchell, Stephen A. (1983) ''Object relations in psychoanalytic theory.'' Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; began in the 1980s as an attempt to integrate [[interpersonal psychoanalysis]]'s emphasis on the detailed exploration of interpersonal interactions with British [[object relations theory]]'s sophisticated ideas about the psychological importance of internalized relationships with other people.  Relationalists argue that [[personality psychology|personality]] emerges from the matrix of early formative relationships with parents and other figures. Philosophically, relational psychoanalysis is closely allied with [[social constructionism]].&lt;ref name="rfs" /&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Personality systematics.jpg|thumb|Personality systematics|450px|right]]
Personality systematics seeks to establish the underlying processes within the domains of the larger system. The domains range from what can be observed from the microlevel to the macrolevel domains.

Personality can be conceptualized as an emergent phenomena of the convergent forces and their expressions which can be compared to a holographic representation. Personality systematics is based on a holistic model of functioning which considers part-whole relationships as being essential to understanding complex self-organizing systems.

The model describes four levels of the personality system:
*Level I, intrapsychic-biological, including cognitive and affective experiences;
*Level II, interpersonal-dyadic (the two-person system), regulating the tension between intimacy and separateness, and including past, current, and expected relationships;
*Level III, relational-triadic matrix, representing the relations among a primary dyad and a third person;
*Level IV, sociocultural familial triangle, depicting the synergy between the individual personality system, the family system, and the cultural system, and shaping how genetic predispositions and vulnerabilities will be expressed.&lt;ref name="rfs" /&gt;

==Applications in treatment==
This model has been used in treating complex clinical syndromes, personality dysfunction, and relational disturbances. To enhance efficacy and range, new methods are used, such as audiovisual recording and [[physiological]] measurements, [[galvanic skin response]], [[heart rate]] variability, and other forms of [[Biofeedback|bio]]- and [[Neurofeedback|neuro-feedback]].&lt;ref name="rfs" /&gt;

'''David Michael Krueger''' (March 5, 1939 – March 5, 2010), best known by his birth name, '''Peter Woodcock''', was a Canadian [[serial killer]], [[child sexual abuse|child rapist]] and diagnosed [[Psychopathy|psychopath]]. He gained notoriety for the murders of three young children in [[Toronto]] in the late 1950s, as well as for a murder in 1991 on his first day of unsupervised release from the psychiatric institution in which he was incarcerated for his earlier crimes.

An adopted child, Krueger lived in numerous foster homes as an infant, and showed signs of severe emotional trauma when he found a permanent foster home at the age of 3. Unable to adjust to social situations, he was bullied by his peers. He would often wander from his home by foot, bicycle or train to parts of Toronto where he would molest dozens, and ultimately murder three young children. Found [[insanity plea|not guilty by reason of insanity]] for his crimes, he was sent to a psychiatric facility. Experimental treatment programs for psychopathy tried with him proved ineffective when he murdered a fellow psychiatric patient in 1991; after his death in 2010, he was described in the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' as "the serial killer they couldn't cure."&lt;ref name="star"&gt;{{citenews |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/ontario/article/776986--the-serial-killer-they-couldn-t-cure-dies-behind-bars#article|title=The serial killer they couldn't cure dies behind bars|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=March 9, 2010|accessdate=July 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Peter Woodcock was born in [[Peterborough, Ontario]] to a 17-year-old factory worker, Waita Woodcock, who gave him up for adoption after breastfeeding him for a month. Adoption agency records report that the newborn, Peter, showed feeding problems and cried constantly.&lt;ref name="bourrie"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Bourrie|title=By reason of insanity: the David Michael Krueger story|publisher=Dundurn Press Ltd.|isbn=978-0-88882-196-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an infant, he stayed in various foster homes, unable to bond with any of his foster parents.&lt;ref name="vronsky249"&gt;{{harvnb|Vronsky|2004|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his first birthday, he became terrified of anybody approaching him, and his speech was incoherent—described as strange whining animal noises.&lt;ref name="vronsky250"&gt;{{harvnb|Vronsky|2004|p=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also physically abused by at least one of his early foster parents, with a 2-year-old Woodcock having to be given medical treatment for an injured neck after receiving a beating.&lt;ref name="vronsky250"/&gt; He was placed into a stable home at the age of 3, to foster parents Frank and Susan Maynard – an upper-middle-class couple with another son. Susan Maynard, who was described as a "forceful woman with an exaggerated sense of propriety",&lt;ref name="vronsky250"/&gt; became strongly attached to the maladjusted child who would still scream when someone approached him. By the age of 5, Woodcock would no longer scream when approached, but he remained a strange child and became the target of neighbourhood bullies. He often wandered far away from his neighbourhood, once being found cowering in some bushes, in an attempt to hide from other children.&lt;ref name="vronsky250"/&gt;

Worried about the child's fragile emotional state, Frank and Susan Maynard would regularly bring him to the [[The Hospital for Sick Children|Hospital for Sick Children]], where Woodcock received extensive treatment. Woodcock was sent to a private school, but again failed to make friends or interact successfully with his peers and remained isolated.&lt;ref name="vronsky251"&gt;{{harvnb|Vronsky|2004|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the age of 11, he was described as an "angry little boy"; a [[Children's Aid Society (Ontario)|Children's Aid Society]] report on him from that time read:

{{quote|Slight in build, neat in appearance, eyes bright, and wide open, worried facial expression, sometimes screwing up of eyes, walks briskly and erect, moves rapidly, darts ahead, interested and questioning constantly in conversation ... He attributes his wandering to feeling so nervous that he just has to get away. In some ways, Peter has little capacity for self-control. He appears to act out almost everything he thinks and demonstrates excessive affection for his foster mother. Although he verbalizes his resentment for other children, he has never been known to physically attack another child ... Peter apparently has no friends. He plays occasionally with younger children, managing the play. When with children his own age, he is boastful and expresses determinedly ideas which are unacceptable and misunderstood.&lt;ref name="vronsky251"/&gt;}}

Signs of Woodcock's violent fantasies were present at this time also, seen when a social worker was walking with him at the [[Canadian National Exhibition]] and Woodcock muttered, "I wish a bomb would fall on the Exhibition and kill all the children".&lt;ref name="vronsky251"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nydn"&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/justice-story/subhed-article-1.1533175|title=Psycho Peter Woodcock murdered three children in late 1950s, underwent cutting-edge LSD therapy at mental hospital and killed again in 1991 when given day of freedom|publisher=nydailynews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woodcock was sent to a school for emotionally disturbed children in [[Kingston, Ontario]], and began acting on his strong sexual urges with other children – with Woodcock stating that here he had consensual intercourse with a 12-year-old girl when he was 13.&lt;ref name="vronsky251"/&gt; When he turned 15, he was discharged from this school and returned to live with his foster parents, but was soon re-enrolled at his original private school, where he again failed to connect with his peers.&lt;ref name="vronsky251"/&gt; At the age of 16, he left the private school again and was sent to a public high school, where children from the neighborhood instantly recognized him and resumed the bullying; he transferred to a private high school six weeks later.&lt;ref name="vronsky251"/&gt; While his peers again shunned him, his teachers there remembered him as a very bright student who excelled in science, history, and English, and who frequently scored 100 percent on his tests.&lt;ref name="vronsky252"&gt;{{harvnb|Vronsky|2004|p=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early crimes==
Peter Woodcock's prized possession was a red and white [[Schwinn Bicycle Company|Schwinn bicycle]] on which he satisfied his continuing compulsion to wander. He rode the bike to the far reaches of the city—even during the deep, cold Toronto winters—and evolved a fantasy in which he led a gang of 500 invisible boys on bikes called the 'Winchester Heights Gang'.&lt;ref name="vronsky252"/&gt; His foster parents were aware of this fantasy and his compulsion to wander, but they were unaware that he had begun traveling around Toronto on his bike and [[sexual assault|sexually assaulting]] children.&lt;ref name="star"/&gt;

===Murder of Wayne Mallette===
On September 15, 1956, Woodcock was riding his bike around the grounds of the [[Exhibition Place]] when he met 7-year-old '''Wayne Mallette'''. He lured the boy out of sight and then proceeded to strangle him to death.&lt;ref name="star"/&gt; Mallette's body was found in the early hours of September 16. He was dressed in a British schoolboy blazer, shirt and plaid trousers. It appeared that his clothing had been removed and he had then been re-dressed. His face was pushed into the dirt and two bite marks were found on the body — one on the boy's calf and the other on his buttock. There was no evidence of [[rape]], however. Pennies were found ritualistically scattered near the body and someone had defecated next to the victim as well.&lt;ref name="vronsky252"/&gt;

===Murder of Gary Morris===
On October 6, 1956, Woodcock was riding his bike around [[Cabbagetown, Toronto|Cabbagetown]] when he picked up 9-year-old '''Gary Morris'''. He then drove the boy to [[Cherry Beach]], where he strangled and beat him to death - with a coroner later determining that Morris had died from a ruptured liver.&lt;ref name="star"/&gt; Morris' body was found with a bite mark on his throat and this time paper clips seemed to have been ritualistically sprinkled near the corpse. Again, the clothing had been removed from the victim and then he had been re-dressed.&lt;ref name="vronsky253"&gt;{{harvnb|Vronsky|2004|p=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Murder of Carole Voyce===
On January 19, 1957, Woodcock was riding his bike when he approached 4-year-old '''Carole Voyce''' and offered her a ride. He then drove her under the [[Bloor Viaduct]] and murdered her.&lt;ref name="star"/&gt; When she was found, her clothes had been pulled off. It appeared that she had been choked into unconsciousness and sexually molested, and that her death was caused by a tree branch being forcibly inserted into her [[vagina]].&lt;ref name="vronsky253"/&gt;

==Apprehension and trial==
Witnesses saw a teenager cycling away from Carole Voyce's crime scene, and an accurate [[composite sketch]] was created based on those witnesses' descriptions. This sketch ran on the front page of the ''Toronto Star'' and would lead to Woodcock's arrest on January 21, 1957, and his subsequent confession to all three murders.&lt;ref name="star"/&gt; He recalled upon his arrest: "My fear was that Mother would find out. Mother was my biggest fear. I didn't know if the police would let her at me."&lt;ref name="vronsky254"&gt;{{harvnb|Vronsky|2004|p=254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Woodcock was tried only for the murder of Carole Voyce.&lt;ref name="nydn"/&gt; On April 11, 1957, after a four-day trial, he was found [[Insanity defense|not guilty by reason of insanity]] and was sent to the Oak Ridge division of the maximum-security [[Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre]] in [[Penetanguishene]], [[Ontario]].&lt;ref name="star"/&gt;

==Imprisonment==
While imprisoned, Woodcock was diagnosed as a [[Psychopathy|psychopath]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mind of a Murderer: Mask of Sanity |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=2002 |quote=(38 minutes in) In 1957, he was found not guilty by reason of insanity, and was sent to a secure mental hospital. He has since been diagnosed as a psychopath. |url=http://www.bbcactive.com/BroadcastLearning/MediaSupportFiles/Mind%20of%20a%20Murderer%20synopsis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; He underwent various forms of psychiatric therapy, including [[LSD]] treatments when they were popular in the 1960s. He was also given other personality-breaking drugs: [[Hyoscine hydrobromide|scopolamine]], [[sodium amytal]], [[methedrine]] and [[dexamyl]].&lt;ref name="vronsky255"&gt;{{harvnb|Vronsky|2004|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subjected to [[Dyad (sociology)|"dyads"]] — a personality-breaking therapy in which inmates challenged each other's belief systems — which inmates referred to as "The Hundred-Day Hate-In".&lt;ref name="star"/&gt; Dyads were developed in the late 1950s to early 1960s by a [[Harvard University|Harvard]] psychologist and former [[CIA]] interrogation and [[psychological warfare]] expert, [[Henry A. Murray]]. In the 1960s, one of Murray's volunteer personality-destruction subjects had been a young Harvard student—[[Ted Kaczynski]], the future Unabomber.&lt;ref name="vronsky255"/&gt; Woodcock did not respond well to these treatments, and was not an ideal prisoner. He engaged in coercive sexual acts and exploited his fellow inmates, who were often less intelligent or less sane than he was. He formed an imaginary gang, the Brotherhood. He convinced inmates that he had contact with the mythical group on the outside, and that in order to be initiated, inmates had to perform [[oral sex]] on him and bring him gifts of cigarettes.&lt;ref name="vronsky255"/&gt;

Woodcock was eventually transferred to less restrictive institutions, and ultimately arrived at the Brockville Psychiatric Hospital. Here, staff indulged his passion for trains by taking him to the Smiths Falls Railway Museum, and even took him to see ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]''. During this time, he legally changed his name to '''David Michael Krueger''' and rekindled a relationship with Bruce Hamill, an Ottawa killer who had been released from Oak Ridge and was working as a security guard at the Ottawa courthouse.&lt;ref name="star"/&gt; Krueger convinced Hamill an alien brotherhood would solve his problems if he helped kill another Brockville inmate, Dennis Kerr.&lt;ref name="star"/&gt;

===Murder of Dennis Kerr===
On July 13, 1991, Bruce Hamill went to a hardware store, bought a plumber's wrench, hatchet, knives and a sleeping bag, then went to the Brockville hospital and signed out Krueger on his first publicly escorted day pass. During the first hour of his first weekend pass (unsupervised release) in 34 years,&lt;ref name="nydn"/&gt; Krueger arranged to meet Dennis Kerr in the woods near Brockville where Krueger would loan Kerr five hundred dollars.&lt;ref name="vronsky256"&gt;{{harvnb|Vronsky|2004|p=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Dennis Kerr arrived as instructed, Krueger struck him in the head with the pipe wrench and continued to beat him into unconsciousness. Krueger and Hamill then seized the hatchet and knife they had hidden in the bushes while waiting for Kerr's arrival and hacked and stabbed Kerr, mutilating his body, cutting it open, and nearly severing his head. Drenched in Kerr's blood, they then stripped themselves naked and [[sodomy|sodomized]] the corpse.&lt;ref name="vronsky257"&gt;{{harvnb|Vronsky|2004|p=257}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krueger then left the scene, walked to a police station about two miles away, and turned himself in.&lt;ref name="vronsky257"/&gt;

===Death===
For the murder of Dennis Kerr, Krueger was transferred back to the Oak Ridge division of the [[Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre]], where he had spent the majority of his 34 preceding years in custody. In the years after Kerr's murder, he was the focus of a biography and several documentary films and sometimes tried to explain why he killed, but he never came up with rational reasons. He said in a 1993 interview: "I'm accused of having no morality, which is a fair assessment, because my morality is whatever the system allows."&lt;ref name="star"/&gt; On March 5, 2010, his 71st birthday, Krueger died of [[Death by natural causes|natural causes]].&lt;ref name="star"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nydn"/&gt;

'''Protein poisoning''' (also referred to colloquially as '''rabbit starvation''', '''''mal de caribou''''', or '''fat starvation''') is a rare form of acute [[malnutrition]] thought to be caused by a near complete absence of [[fat]] in the diet.

Excess protein is sometimes cited as the cause of this condition, however when meat and fat are consumed in the correct ratio, such as that found in [[pemmican]] (which is 50% fat by volume), the diet is considered nutritionally complete and can support humans for months or more. Other stressors, such as severe cold or a dry environment, may intensify symptoms or decrease time to onset. Symptoms include [[diarrhea]], headache, fatigue, [[low blood pressure]], [[slow heart rate]], and a vague discomfort and hunger (very similar to a [[food craving]]) that can be satisfied only by the consumption of fat.

Protein poisoning was first noted as a consequence of eating rabbit meat exclusively, hence the term, "rabbit starvation". Rabbit meat is very lean; commercial rabbit meat has 50–100 g dissectable fat per 2&amp;nbsp;kg (live weight). Based on a carcass yield of 60%, rabbit meat is around 8.3% fat&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/t1690e/t1690e03.htm
|title=FAO: The Rabbit, Husbandry, Health and Production
}}&lt;/ref&gt; while beef and pork are 32% fat and lamb 28%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=FAO: Guidelines for slaughtering meat cutting and further processing
|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/004/t0279e/t0279e05.htm}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible mechanisms==
Given the lack of scientific data on the effects of high-protein diets, the US Food and Nutrition Board does not set a [[tolerable upper intake level]] nor upper [[acceptable macronutrient distribution range]] for protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10490&amp;page=694 | title = Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids (Macronutrients) |author1=US Food |author2=Nutrition Board | publisher = The National Academies Press | accessdate = 2010-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observations==
In U.S. Military [[Arctic Light Infantry Training]] (ALIT), it is taught that rabbit takes more vitamins to digest than it returns.  It is recommended in survival situations to refrain from eating at all if rabbit is the only thing to eat. {{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Though, instead of eating the meat (which consumes your fat and vitamins), you could simply boil the rabbit meat to extract the fat and some minerals and vitamins (some vitamins will be destroyed by temperature).  

The Arctic explorer [[Vilhjalmur Stefansson]], who experienced rabbit starvation himself, wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The groups that depend on the blubber animals are the most fortunate in the hunting way of life, for they never suffer from fat-hunger. This trouble is worst, so far as North America is concerned, among those forest Indians who depend at times on rabbits, the leanest animal in the North, and who develop the extreme fat-hunger known as rabbit-[[starvation]]. Rabbit eaters, if they have no fat from another source—beaver, moose, fish—will develop diarrhea in about a week, with headache, lassitude and vague discomfort. If there are enough rabbits, the people eat till their stomachs are distended; but no matter how much they eat they feel unsatisfied. Some think a man will die sooner if he eats continually of fat-free meat than if he eats nothing, but this is a belief on which sufficient evidence for a decision has not been gathered in the North. Deaths from rabbit-starvation, or from the eating of other skinny meat, are rare; for everyone understands the principle, and any possible preventive steps are naturally taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rabbit Starvation |url=http://www.medbio.info/Horn/Time%201-2/vilhjalmur_stefansson1.htm}}{{self-published inline|date=April 2015}}{{MEDRS|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the [[Lady Franklin Bay Expedition|Greely Arctic Expedition]] 1881–1884, a harrowing experience of 25 expedition members, of whom 19 died, Stefansson refers to "'rabbit starvation' which is now to me the key to the Greely problem," which was why "only six came back." He concludes that one of the reasons for the many deaths was cannibalism of the lean flesh of members who had already died. Stefansson likens this to rabbit starvation, which he explains somewhat as in the above quoted observation.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

[[Charles Darwin]], in ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]'', wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We were here able to buy some biscuit. I had now been several days without tasting any thing besides meat: I did not at all dislike this new regimen; but I felt as if it would only have agreed with me with hard exercise. I have heard that patients in England, when desired to confine themselves exclusively to an animal diet, even with the hope of life before their eyes, have hardly been able to endure it. Yet the [[Gaucho]] in the [[Pampas]], for months together, touches nothing but beef. But they eat, I observe, a very large proportion of fat, which is of a less animalized nature; and they particularly dislike dry meat, such as that of the [[agouti]]. Dr. Richardson, also, has remarked, “that when people have fed for a long time solely upon lean animal food, the desire for fat becomes so insatiable, that they can consume a large quantity of unmixed and even oily fat without nausea:” this appears to me a curious physiological fact. It is, perhaps, from their meat regimen that the Gauchos, like other carnivorous animals, can abstain long from food. I was told that at [[Tandil|Tandeel]], some troops voluntarily pursued a party of Indians for three days, without eating or drinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Charles |first=Darwin |editor1-first=Edward |editor1-last=Wilson |date=2006 |chapter=Voyage of the Beagle: Bahia Blanca to Buenos Ayres |title=From So Simple a Beginning: The Four Great Books of Charles Darwin |url= |location=London, New York |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |page=121 |isbn=978-0-393-06134-5 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[Into the Wild (book)|Into the Wild]]'' (1996), [[Jon Krakauer]] conjectured that [[Chris McCandless]] might have suffered from rabbit starvation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9872">'''Religious stratification'''  is the division of a society into hierarchical layers on the basis of [[religious belief]]s, affiliation, or [[faith]] practices.  

According to [[Kingsley Davis]] and [[Wilbert E. Moore]], "[t]he reason why religion is necessary is apparently to be found in the fact that human society achieves its unity primarily through the possession by its members of certain ultimate values and ends in common".&lt;ref&gt;*Davis, Kingsley and Wilbert E Moore, 1945.  "Some Principles of Stratification," ''American Sociological Review 10''(April): 242-49.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, Davis and Moore contend that it is "the role of religious belief and ritual to supply and reinforce this appearance of reality" that these "certain ultimate values" have. This is one possible explanation for why [[religion]] is one of the underlying factors which links various forms of [[Social inequality|inequality]] into a chain of [[Social stratification|stratification]].

==Critical overview==
Broadly defined, [[social stratification]] is constituted by the division of a society into hierarchical layers of wealth, power, and prestige. These layers, or strata, have been related to a variety of social categories, such as:

*[[Race (classification of humans)|Race]]
*[[Social class|Class]]
*[[Gender]]
*[[Ethnicity]]
*[[Religion]]

[[Sociologist]]s have paid attention to stratification based on race, class, gender, and ethnicity.  Religion is closely tied to ethnic affiliation. Research suggests that religious stratification deserves more attention than it usually gets. It is a common development in religiously diverse societies. Once it becomes embedded in societies' laws, customs, and ideologies, it tends to persist. It also has societal consequences. Thus, it is important in its own right, but also in relation to other forms of stratification.

==In the United States==

Sociologists James D. Davidson and Ralph E. Pyle (2011) argue that religious stratification emerged during America's colonial period, as a result of religious [[ethnocentrism]], religious competition, and unequal resources. They show that Anglicans, Congregationalists, and Presbyterians were over-represented among the economic, political, and educational elites. Other Protestant groups, Catholics, Jews, and people with no religious preference ranked much lower in status. 

The ranking of religious groups has changed in some ways over the course of U.S. history (Davidson and Pyle 2011, Pyle 1996). Most notably, Jews have risen into the upper stratum, while Catholics have climbed into the upper-middle stratum. However, religious stratification persists. For example, Anglicans (now Episcopalians), Congregationalists (now United Church of Christ), and Presbyterians remain in the upper stratum, and other Protestants groups such as Baptists (who ranked low in the colonial period) still have not experienced much upward mobility. 

These developments are linked to inter-religious power struggles related to membership size, organizational capacity, and resources. The struggles affect societal laws, ideologies, and customs. In the colonial period, religious stratification was justified by law: Congregationalists were the "established" church in New England colonies; Anglicans were the "established" church in southern colonies. The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] Amendments, along with other civil rights laws, have knocked the legal foundation out from under religious stratification. The pro-Protestant ideology that emerged in the colonial period has been tempered somewhat by [[multiculturalism]], but it remains an integral part of American culture. Religious groups that have adapted most to this ideology have experienced more mobility than other groups. Colonial elites also have developed a number of customs, such as church-sponsored preparatory schools, private colleges, universities, and [[legacy preferences|legacy admission]]s that have perpetuated their prominence (Coe and Davidson 2011). Another custom has been the tendency to appoint other religious elites to political office (Davidson, Kraus, and Morrissey 2005). Jews and Catholics have developed customs of their own, such as parochial schools and business ownership, that have contributed to improvements in their social status.

Contrary to Davis and Moore's argument that stratification is functional for society, Davidson and Pyle (2011) argue that religious stratification destabilizes society. It produces social problems, like religious hate crimes, that would not otherwise exist.

==Stratification as the result of the social implications of religion==

According to Evelyn L. Lehrer religion has a significant impact on marital stability, the choice of marital partner, fertility, women's work at home and in the labor market, education, wages and wealth, and the timing of entry into first union and the choice of whether to cohabit.&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn L. Lehrer ''Religion as a Determinant of Economic and Demographic Behavior''&lt;/ref&gt;  In her research there are many instances in which stratification is the byproduct of religious faith practices.  Stratification based on religion is evident specifically in the realm of economics.
  
One case in point is the presence of women in the work force. Lehrer explains "The Mormon and conservative Protestant faiths make a sharp distinction between male and female social and economic roles, encouraging the traditional division of labor within the household when young children are present" (713).  Depending on the socioeconomic class of the family, the expectation of the woman to adhere to these traditional social roles could be a factor by which the economic advancement of the family is limited. 
 
Cited within Lehrer's book are studies which examine levels of education, wages, and wealth among different religious faiths.  Lehrer writes in her book, "A conservative Protestant upbringing may be associated with an authoritarian approach to knowledge and a rejection of critical inquiry and unconventional modes of thinking, implying lower levels of certain types of home investments in child quality" (716).  This was derived from the work of Sherkat and Darnell published in 1999.  Also based on the work of Sherkat and Darnell published in 1997, is Lehrer's assertion that conservative Protestant parents "often discourage their children from taking college preparatory courses, out of a concern that such courses may be harmful to them" (716).  Lehrer, as a result, contends that children raised by conservative Protestant parents "often acquire less human capital in their formative years and may thus be less able to benefit from college" (716).   So, as the topic is quite well developed, educational inequality is well researched and there is much evidence concerning the impact that an individual's level of education can have in terms of the hierarchy of stratification.  It seems however that there can be seen another factor which should be allowed for in terms of determining the lines of stratification.  Perhaps the significant impact that education plays in inequality can be even better understood when religion is controlled for.  

Other works which have investigated religious stratification include that of Gaetano Mosca whose research was published in his The Ruling Class.  Although this work was published in the late 1930s the concept that is brought forth is interesting to note and is perhaps still quite relevant in contemporary times.  Mosca states that "In societies in which religious beliefs are strong and ministers of the faith form a special class a priestly aristocracy almost always arises and gains possession of a more or less important share of the wealth and the political power."

'''Father Robert Abercromby''' (1536 – 27 April 1613), whose surname was also spelled as '''Abrecromby''' and '''Abercrombie''', and was known by such pseudonyms as '''Robert Sandiesoun''' and '''Sanders Robertson''', was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[missionary]].

==Early life==
He was born and educated in [[Scotland]], and studied in the [[Collegium Romanum]] in [[Rome]], where on 19 August 1563 he became a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]]. From 1564 he lived in Braunsberg (then in [[Royal Prussia]]; present-day [[Braniewo|Braniewo, Poland]]) where he was professor of grammar in the biggest Polish Jesuit ''[[collegium]]'' (where teaching was in [[Latin language|Latin]]) and a [[novice master]].

In 1565 he was ordained a [[Catholic priest|priest]]. In Braniewo he was in constant contact with Cardinal [[Stanislaus Hosius]]. He was considered a good priest, but learning [[Polish language|Polish]] was difficult for him, and he had some problems with the finances of the school. Due to these problems he was permitted to leave Poland in 1580, when he met the Scottish king for the first time. In September 1580 he went back to Poland - from 1580–87 he performed similar tasks in [[Kraków]], [[Poznań]] and [[Wilno]].

In 1587 he left Poland and returned to Scotland. During the journey to Scotland in 1580 and during his second stay there he was organizing transports of Scottish [[Catholicism|Catholic]] novices to be trained in Polish schools and [[Catholic seminary|seminaries]].&lt;ref&gt;Biegańska, Anna. ''The learned Scots in Poland from the mid-sixteenth to the close of the eighteenth century'', "Canadian Slavonic Papers", March 2001, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3763/is_200103/ai_n8948825/pg_3 online version]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grzebień, Father Ludwik (SJ), ''Encyklopedia wiedzy o jezuitach na ziemiach Polski i Litwy, 1564-1995'', Kraków 1996, [http://jezuici.krakow.pl/cgi-bin/rjbo?b=enc&amp;q=ABERCROMBIE&amp;f=1 online version with additional bibliography]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contact with Anne of Denmark==
Abercromby claimed that he had reconciled [[Anne of Denmark]], queen of [[James VI of Scotland]], to the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of Christian Biography|editor=Michael Walsh|publisher=Continuum|isbn=0826452639|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; James apparently allowed Abercromby to meet her at [[Holyroodhouse]] circa 1599. She made no outward sign of a change of religion.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

==Later life==
Abercromby remained in Scotland for some time, but a price of 10,000 [[Crown (British coin)|crowns]] was put upon his head. He spent the period 1601–06 under the protection of [[George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly]].&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=46|title=Abercromby, Robert|first=G. Martin|last=Murphy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abercromby went back to Braunsberg in 1606. His name was connected to the [[allegiance oath controversy]] when a pamphlet "[[pasquil]]", ''Exetasis epistolæ nomine regis'', written under the pseudonym Bartholus Pacenius against James I was traced to Braunsberg;&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; but the investigation by [[Patrick Gordon (diplomat)|Patrick Gordon]] was inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/1979/796/1/DefDoctmetindex.pdf ''William Trumbull: A Jacobean diplomat at the court of the Archdukes in Brussels, 1605/9-1625'' (PDF), p. 193].&lt;/ref&gt; He died there on 27 April 1613.

'''Rouvaun''' (1932–1975) was born Jim Haun in [[Bingham, Utah|Bingham]], [[Utah]]. A child singer with the [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]] in [[Salt Lake City]], he went on to study voice at the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music and perform with the Beverly Hills Opera Company. Nonetheless, he remained a struggling woodworker studying voice. Rouvaun was a virtual unknown until February 5, 1967, when he appeared in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]] as the headline singer leading the 100-person Frederick Apcar French stage review Casino De Paris at the [[Dunes (hotel and casino)|Dunes Hotel]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} His first record label, KALAMO, described him on his debut album cover as "The World's Greatest Singer".

Nicknamed "The Vocal Vesuvius", Rouvaun continued performing on stage to sellout crowds and recorded a number of albums (see below). His career seemed to be blossoming until tragedy struck in 1975, when Rouvaun collapsed and died at age 43 due to massive internal hemorrhaging. Apparently the strain on his [[Vocal folds|vocal cords]] had caused his [[esophagus]] to rupture.

Rouvaun's rise to stardom was not by accident. His first vocal coach was [[Mario Chamlee]], a famed tenor among the many who tried to succeed [[Enrico Caruso]] at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in the 1920s. Rouvaun then studied with Mario Silva, acclaimed voice coach of [[Mario Lanza]]. His singing career led to big city and foreign concerts. His hobbies included foreign cars, riding his [[motorcycle]], target shooting, listening to [[jazz]], and painting landscapes and seascapes in oil. He was marketed and promoted by [[Alamo Christian Foundation|Tony Alamo]], who later became a notorious Christian minister. Rouvaun had a potential movie contract in the works to star in the life story of Mario Lanza and had the approval of the Lanza family, although the movie with Rouvaun never happened. Rouvaun's RCA Victor contract called for several long play records and singles to be recorded and released yearly.

He left behind a wife and children. One son, [[Jimmy Haun]], went on to become guitarist with the rock group [[Air Supply]]. Jimmy Haun's daughter and Rouvaun's granddaughter is the television actress [[Lindsey Haun]] (born 1984). Rouvaun can be seen and heard here on television and audio clips. An official Rouvaun website put up by Rouvaun's family no longer exists, but a Rouvaun tribute website can still be found on [[Myspace]] featuring Rouvaun's music, biography and many photographs from his career (including his stint at the Dunes).

A Rouvaun Fan Club existed with many chapters, and comedian [[Jack Benny]] was President of the Burbank Chapter, according to program notes on the Rouvaun Album ''From the Heart of a Man''.

The meaning of '''spirituality''' has developed and expanded over time, and various connotations can be found alongside each other.{{sfn|McCarroll|2005|p=44}}{{sfn|Koenig|2012|p=36}}{{sfn|Cobb|2012|p=213}}{{refn|group=note|name="definition"}} 

Traditionally, spirituality referred to a [[Religion|religious]] process of re-formation which "aims to recover the original shape of man",{{refn|group=note|name=Waaijman|Waaijman{{sfn|Waaijman|2000|p=460}}{{sfn|Waaijman|2002}} uses the word "omvorming", "to change the form". Different translations are possible: transformation, re-formation, [[Alchemy|trans-mutation]].}} oriented at "the image of God"{{sfn|Waaijman|2000|p=460}}{{sfn|Waaijman|2002}} as exemplified by the founders and sacred texts of the religions of the world. The term was used within early Christianity to refer to a life oriented toward the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]]{{sfn|Wong|2009}} and broadened during late medieval times to include mental aspects of life.

In modern times the term both spread to other religious traditions{{sfn|Gorsuch|1999}} and broadened to refer to a wider range of experience, including a range of esoteric traditions and religious traditions. Modern usages tend to refer to a subjective experience of a sacred dimension{{sfn|Saucier|2006|p=1259}} and the "deepest values and meanings by which people live",{{sfn|Sheldrake|2007|p=1–2}}{{sfn|Griffin|1988}} often in a context separate from organized religious institutions,{{sfn|Wong|2008}} such as a belief in a [[supernatural]] (beyond the known and observable) realm,{{sfn|Schuurmans-Stekhoven|2014}} [[personal growth]],{{sfn|Houtman|2007}} a quest for an ultimate or sacred [[Meaning of life|meaning]],{{sfn|Snyder|2007|p=261}} [[religious experience]],{{sfn|Sharf|2000}} or an encounter with one's own "inner dimension".{{sfn|Waaijman|2002|p=315}}

==Etymology==
The term [[spirit]] means "animating or vital principle in man and animals".&lt;ref group=web name="OED-Spirit" /&gt; It is derived from the Old French ''espirit'', which comes from the Latin word ''spiritus'' ([[soul]], courage, vigor, breath) and is related to ''spirare'' (to breathe). In the [[Vulgate]] the Latin word ''spiritus'' is used to translate the Greek ''[[pneuma]]'' and Hebrew ''[[Ruach|ruah]]''.&lt;ref group=web name="OED-Spirit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=spirit&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |title=Online Etymology Dictionary, '&amp;#39;Spirit'&amp;#39; |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "spiritual", matters "concerning the spirit", is derived from Old French ''spirituel'' (12c.), which is derived from Latin ''spiritualis'', which comes from ''spiritus'' or "spirit".&lt;ref group=web name="OED-Spiritual"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=spiritual&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |title=Online Etymology Dictionary, '&amp;#39;Spiritual'&amp;#39; |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "spirituality" is derived from Middle French ''spiritualité'', from Late Latin "spiritualitatem" (nominative spiritualitas), which is also derived from Latin ''spiritualis''.&lt;ref group=web name="OED-Spirituality"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=spirituality&amp;searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary, '&amp;#39;Spirituality'&amp;#39; |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no single, widely agreed upon definition of spirituality.{{sfn|Koenig|2012|p=36}}{{sfn|Cobb|2012|p=213}}{{refn|group=note|name="definition"|See:&lt;br /&gt;* Koenig e.a.: "There is no widely agreed on definition of spirituality today".{{sfn|Koenig|2012|p=36}}&lt;br /&gt;* Cobb e.a.: "The spiritual dimension is deeply subjective and there is no authoritative definition of spirituality".{{sfn|Cobb|2012|p=213}}}} Surveys of the definition of the term, as used in scholarly research, show a broad range of definitions with limited overlap.{{sfn|McCarroll|2005|p=44}} A survey of reviews by McCarroll each dealing with the topic of spirituality gave twenty-seven explicit definitions, among which "there was little agreement."{{sfn|McCarroll|2005|p=44}} This impedes the systematic study of spirituality and the capacity to communicate findings meaningfully. Furthermore, many of spirituality's core features are not unique to spirituality; for example self-[[Transcendence (religion)|transcendence]], asceticism and the recognition of one's connection to all were regarded by the atheist [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] as key to ethical life.&lt;ref&gt;''The Academy of Ideas'', [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypOtX1kEo8U The Ethics of Schopenhauer]&lt;/ref&gt;{{better|date=August 2018}}

According to Kees Waaijman, the traditional meaning of spirituality is a process of re-formation which "aims to recover the original shape of man, the image of God. To accomplish this, the re-formation is oriented at a mold, which represents the original shape: in [[Judaism]] the [[Torah]], in [[Christianity]] there is [[Christ]], for [[Buddhism]], [[Buddha]], and in [[Islam]], [[Muhammad]]."{{refn|group=note|name=Waaijman}} Houtman and Aupers suggest that modern spirituality is a blend of humanistic psychology, mystical and esoteric traditions and Eastern religions.{{sfn|Houtman|2007}}

In modern times the emphasis is on subjective experience{{sfn|Saucier|2006|p=1259}}  and the "deepest values and meanings by which people live,"{{sfn|Sheldrake|2007|p=1-2}}{{sfn|Griffin|1988}} incorporating [[Personal growth|personal growth or transformation]], usually in a context separate from organized religious institutions.{{sfn|Wong|2008}}

==Development of the meaning of spirituality==

===Classical, medieval and early modern periods===
Words translatable as 'spirituality' first began to arise in the 5th century and only entered common use toward the end of the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, L. G., "A thirst for god or consumer spirituality? Cultivating disciplined practices of being engaged by god," in L. Gregory Jones and James J. Buckley eds., Spirituality and Social Embodiment, Oxford: Blackwell, 1997, 3-28, p4, n4.&lt;/ref&gt; In a Biblical context the term means being animated by God,{{sfn|Waaijman|2000|p=359-360}} to be driven by the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]], as opposed to a life which rejects this influence.{{sfn|Wong|2009}}

In the 11th century this meaning changed. Spirituality began to denote the mental aspect of life, as opposed to the material and sensual aspects of life, "the ecclesiastical sphere of light against the dark world of matter".{{sfn|Waaijman|2000|p=360}}{{refn|group=note|In Dutch: "de hemelse lichtsfeer tegenover de duistere wereld van de materie". {{sfn|Waaijman|2000|p=360}}}} In the 13th century "spirituality" acquired a social and psychological meaning. Socially it denoted the territory of the clergy: "The ecclesiastical against the temporary possessions, the ecclesiastical against the secular authority, the clerical class against the secular class"{{sfn|Waaijman|2000|p=360-361}}{{refn|group=note|In Dutch: "de kerkelijke tegenover de tijdelijke goederen, het kerkelijk tegenover het wereldlijk gezag, de geestelijke stand tegenover de lekenstand".{{sfn|Waaijman|2000|p=360-361}}}} Psychologically, it denoted the realm of the inner life: "The purity of motives, affections, intentions, inner dispositions, the psychology of the spiritual life, the analysis of the feelings".{{sfn|Waaijman|2000|p=361}}{{refn|group=note|In Dutch: "Zuiverheid van motieven, affecties, wilsintenties, innerlijke disposities, de psychologie van het geestelijk leven, de analyse van de gevoelens".{{sfn|Waaijman|2000|p=361}}}}

In the 17th and 18th century a distinction was made between higher and lower forms of spirituality: "A spiritual man is one who is Christian 'more abundantly and deeper than others'."{{sfn|Waaijman|2000|p=361}}{{refn|group=note|In Dutch: "Een spiritueel mens is iemand die 'overvloediger en dieper dan de anderen' christen is".{{sfn|Waaijman|2000|p=361}}}} The word was also associated with mysticism and quietism, and acquired a negative meaning.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===Modern spirituality===
{{See also|Western esotericism#18th, 19th and early 20th centuries|l1=History of Westerm esotericism|New Age|l2=New Age}}

Modern notions of spirituality developed throughout the 19th and 20th century, mixing Christian ideas with [[Western esotericism|Western esoteric]] traditions and elements of Asian, especially Indian, religions. Spirituality became increasingly disconnected from traditional religious organisations and institutions. It is sometimes associated today with philosophical, social, or political movements such as [[liberalism]], [[feminist theology]], and [[green politics]].{{sfn|Snyder|2007|p=261-261}} 
====Transcendentalism and Unitarian Universalism====
[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] (1803–1882) was a pioneer of the idea of spirituality as a distinct field.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Leigh Eric. ''Restless Souls : The Making of American Spirituality''. San Francisco: Harper, 2005. {{ISBN|0-06-054566-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the major figures in [[Transcendentalism]], an early 19th-century [[Liberal Christianity|liberal Protestant]] movement, which was rooted in English and German [[Romanticism]], the Biblical criticism of [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]], the [[skepticism]] of [[David Hume|Hume]],&lt;ref group=web name="Stanford-Transcendentlism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/transcendentalism/ |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, '&amp;#39;Transcendentalism'&amp;#39; |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Neo-Platonism]].{{sfn|Remes|2014|p=202}}{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=35}}
The Transcendentalists emphasised an intuitive, experiential approach of religion.&lt;ref group=web name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jone Johnson Lewis |url=http://www.transcendentalists.com/what.htm |title=Jone John Lewis, '&amp;#39;What is Transcendentalism? |publisher=Transcendentalists.com |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Schleiermacher,{{sfn|Sharf|1995}} an individual's intuition of truth was taken as the criterion for truth.&lt;ref group=web name="Lewis" /&gt; In the late 18th and early 19th century, the first translations of Hindu texts appeared, which were also read by the Transcendentalists, and influenced their thinking.&lt;ref group=web name="Lewis" /&gt; They also endorsed [[Universalism|universalist]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarianist]] ideas, leading to [[Unitarian Universalism]], the idea that there must be truth in other religions as well, since a loving God would redeem all living beings, not just Christians.&lt;ref group=web name="Lewis" /&gt;&lt;ref group=web name="Andrews"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.uua.org/re/other/andrews.html |title=Barry Andrews, '&amp;#39;The Roots Of Unitarian Universalist Spirituality In New England Transcendentalism '&amp;#39; |publisher=Archive.uua.org |date=1999-03-12 |accessdate=2014-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054734/http://archive.uua.org/re/other/andrews.html |archivedate=2013-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Theosophy, Anthroposophy, and the Perennial Philosophy====
{{See also|Western esotericism}}

A major influence on modern spirituality was the [[Theosophical Society]], which searched for 'secret teachings' in Asian religions.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} It has been influential on modernist streams in several Asian religions, notably [[Neo-Vedanta]], the revival of [[Theravada Buddhism]], and [[Buddhist modernism]], which have taken over modern western notions of [[Religious experience|personal experience]] and [[universalism]] and integrated them in their religious concepts.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} A second, related influence was [[Anthroposophy]], whose founder, [[Rudolf Steiner]], was particularly interested in developing a genuine Western spirituality, and in the ways that such a spirituality could transform practical institutions such as [[Waldorf education|education]], [[biodynamic agriculture|agriculture]], and [[anthroposophical medicine|medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McDermott|first=Robert|title=The Essential Steiner|year=2007|publisher=Lindisfarne|isbn=1584200510}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''William James and Rudolf Steiner'', Robert A. McDermott, 1991, in ReVision, vol.13 no.4
[http://www.ciis.edu/Documents/Academic%20Departments/PCC/McDermott_William%20James%20and%20Rudolf%20Steiner.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|Asian traditions]] on western modern spirituality was also furthered by the [[Perennial Philosophy]], whose main proponent [[Aldous Huxley]] was deeply influenced by [[Swami Vivekananda|Swami Vivekananda's]] [[Neo-Vedanta]] and [[Universalism]],{{sfn|Roy|2003}} and the spread of social welfare, education and mass travel after [[World War Two]].

====Neo-Vedanta====
{{main article|Neo-Vedanta}}

An important influence on western spirituality was [[Neo-Vedanta]], also called ''neo-Hinduism''{{sfn|King|2002|p=93}} and ''Hindu Universalism'',&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bharatabharati.wordpress.com/2012/02/15/neo-vedanta-the-problem-with-hindu-universalism-frank-gaetano-morales/ |title=Frank Morales, '&amp;#39;Neo-Vedanta: The problem with Hindu Universalism'&amp;#39; |publisher=Bharatabharati.wordpress.com |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; a modern interpretation of [[Hinduism]] which developed in response to western [[colonialism]] and [[orientalism]]. It aims to present Hinduism as a "homogenized ideal of Hinduism"{{sfn|Yelle|2012|p=338}} with Advaita Vedanta as its central doctrine.{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} Due to the colonisation of Asia by the western world, since the 19th century an exchange of ideas has been taking place between the western world and Asia, which also influenced western religiosity.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} Unitarianism, and the idea of Universalism, was brought to India by missionaries, and had a major influence on neo-Hinduism via [[Ram Mohan Roy]]'s [[Brahmo Samaj]] and [[Brahmoism]]. Roy attempted to modernise and reform Hinduism, from the idea of Universalism.{{sfn|King|2002}} This universalism was further popularised, and brought back to the west as neo-Vedanta, by [[Swami Vivekananda]].{{sfn|King|2002}}

===="Spiritual but not religious"====
{{main article|Spiritual but not religious}}
After the Second World War, spirituality and theistic religion became increasingly disconnected,{{sfn|Waaijman|2000|p=361}} and spirituality became more oriented on subjective experience, instead of "attempts to place the self within a broader ontological context."{{sfn|Saucier|2007|p=1259}} A new discourse developed, in which (humanistic) psychology, mystical and esoteric traditions and eastern religions are being blended, to reach the [[True self and false self|true self]] by [[self-disclosure]], free expression and meditation.{{sfn|Houtman|2007}}

The distinction between the spiritual and the religious became more common in the popular mind during the late 20th century with the rise of [[secularism]] and the advent of the [[New Age]] movement.  Authors such as [[Chris Griscom]] and [[Shirley MacLaine]] explored it in numerous ways in their books. [[Paul Heelas]] noted the development within New Age circles of what he called "seminar spirituality":&lt;ref&gt;Paul Heelas, ''The New Age Movement: The Celebration of the Self and the Sacralization of Modernity''. Oxford: Blackwell, 1996, page 60. Cited in [[Anthony Giddens]]: ''Sociology''. Cambridge: Polity, 2001, page 554.&lt;/ref&gt; structured offerings complementing [[consumerism|consumer]] choice with spiritual options.

Among other factors, declining membership of organized religions and the growth of secularism in the [[Western culture|western world]] have given rise to this broader view of spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hogan (2010). ''The Culture of Our Thinking in Relation to Spirituality''. Nova Science Publishers: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Even the secular are finding use for spiritual beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elkins | first1 = D. N. | last2 = Hedstrom | first2 = L.

Asheville, NC: Somagni Publishing, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Mamas, "Angels, Einstein and You". Wilsonville, OR: BookPartners, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "spiritual" is now frequently used in contexts in which the term "religious" was formerly employed.{{sfn|Gorsuch|1999}} Both theists and atheists have criticized this development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hollywood|first1=Amy|title=Spiritual but Not Religious: The Vital Interplay between Submission and Freedom|journal=Harvard Divinity Bulletin|date=Winter–Spring 2010|volume=38|issue= 1 and 2|url=http://www.hds.harvard.edu/news-events/harvard-divinity-bulletin/articles/spiritual-but-not-religious|accessdate=4 January 2014|publisher=Harvard Divinity School}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=David |first=Rabbi |url=http://ideas.time.com/2013/03/21/viewpoint-the-problem-with-being-spiritual-but-not-religious |title=Viewpoint: The Limitations of Being 'Spiritual but Not Religious' |publisher=Ideas.time.com |accessdate=2014-01-04 |date=2013-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional spirituality==

===Abrahamic faiths===

====Judaism====
{{refimprove section|date=November 2018}}
Rabbinic Judaism (or in some Christian traditions,{{which|date= November 2018}} Rabbinism) (Hebrew: "Yahadut Rabanit" - יהדות רבנית) has been the mainstream form of Judaism since the 6th century CE, after the codification of the [[Talmud]]. It is characterised by the belief that the [[Written Torah]] ("Law" or "Instruction") cannot be correctly interpreted without reference to the [[Oral Torah]] and by the voluminous literature specifying what behavior is sanctioned by the law (called [[halakha]], "the way").

[[Judaism]] knows a variety of [[Judaism#Jewish observances|religious observances]]: ethical rules, prayers, religious clothing, holidays, shabbat, pilgrimages, Torah reading, dietary laws, etc.

[[Kabbalah]] (literally "receiving"), is an [[esoteric]] method, discipline and school of thought of Judaism. Its definition varies according to the tradition and aims of those following it,&lt;ref&gt;''Kabbalah: A very short introduction'', Joseph Dan, Oxford University Press, Chapter 1 "The term and its uses"&lt;/ref&gt; from its religious origin as an integral part of [[Judaism]], to its later [[Christian Kabbalah|Christian]], [[New Age]], or [[Hermetic Qabalah|Occultist]] [[Syncretism|syncretic]] adaptations. Kabbalah is a set of esoteric teachings meant to explain the relationship between an unchanging, eternal and mysterious [[Ein Sof]] (no end) and the mortal and finite universe (his creation). While it is heavily used by some denominations,{{which|date= November 2018}} it is not a [[religious denomination]] in itself. Inside Judaism, it forms the foundations of mystical religious interpretation. Outside Judaism, its [[scriptures]] are read outside the traditional canons of organised religion. Kabbalah seeks to define the nature of the universe and the human being, the nature and purpose of existence, and various other [[Ontology|ontological]] questions. It also presents methods to aid understanding of these concepts and to thereby attain spiritual realisation.

[[Hasidic Judaism]], meaning "piety" (or "[[Chesed|loving kindness]]"), is a branch of [[Orthodox Judaism]] that promotes spirituality through the popularisation and internalisation of [[Jewish mysticism]] as the fundamental aspect of the faith. It was founded in 18th-century Eastern Europe by Rabbi Israel [[Baal Shem Tov]] as a reaction against overly [[Talmud|legalistic]] Judaism. His example began the characteristic veneration of [[Rebbe|leadership]] in Hasidism as embodiments and intercessors of [[Tzadik|Divinity]] for the followers.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Opposite to this, Hasidic teachings cherished the sincerity and concealed holiness of the unlettered common folk, and their equality with the scholarly elite. The emphasis on the [[Divine immanence|Immanent]] Divine presence in everything gave new value to prayer and deeds of kindness, alongside Rabbinic supremacy of [[Torah study|study]], and replaced historical [[Kabbalah|mystical (kabbalistic)]] and [[Musar literature|ethical (musar)]] [[Asceticism in Judaism|asceticism]] and [[Maggid|admonishment]] with optimism,{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} encouragement, and daily [[devekut|fervour]]. This populist emotional revival accompanied the elite ideal of nullification to paradoxical Divine [[Panentheism]], through intellectual articulation of inner dimensions of mystical thought.

====Christianity====
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
{{Main article|Catholic spirituality|Christian mysticism}}
[[File:Mystic Marriage.jpg|thumb|miniature|Union with Christ is the purpose of Christian mysticism.]]
Catholic spirituality is the spiritual practice of living out a personal [[Faith in Christianity#Roman Catholicism|act of faith]] (''fides qua creditur'') following the acceptance of [[Credo|faith]] (''fides quae creditur''). Although all [[Catholics]] are expected to pray together at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], there are many different forms of spirituality and private prayer which have developed over the centuries. Each of the major [[religious order]]s of the [[Catholic Church]] and other [[laity|lay]] groupings have their own unique spirituality - its own way of approaching God in prayer and in living out the [[Gospel]].

Christian mysticism refers to the development of [[mysticism|mystical practices and theory]] within [[Christianity]]. It has often been connected to [[mystical theology]], especially in the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] traditions. The attributes and means by which Christian mysticism is studied and practiced are varied and range from [[Religious ecstasy|ecstatic]] visions of the soul's [[Bridal theology|mystical union with God]] to simple prayerful [[contemplation]] of Holy Scripture (i.e., ''[[Lectio Divina]]'').

[[Progressive Christianity]] is a contemporary movement which seeks to remove the supernatural claims of the faith and replace them with a post-critical understanding of biblical spirituality based on historical and scientific research. It focuses on the lived experience of spirituality over historical dogmatic claims, and accepts that the faith is both true and a human construction, and that spiritual experiences are psychologically and neurally real and useful.

====Islam====

=====Five pillars=====
{{Main article|Five Pillars of Islam}}
The Pillars of Islam (''arkan al-Islam''; also ''arkan ad-din'', "pillars of religion") are five basic acts in Islam, considered obligatory for all believers. The [[Quran]] presents them as a framework for worship and a sign of commitment to the faith. They are (1) the creed (''[[shahadah]]''), (2) daily prayers (''[[salat]]''), (3) almsgiving (''[[zakah]]''), (4) [[fasting during Ramadan]] and (5) the pilgrimage to Mecca (''[[hajj]]'') at least once in a lifetime. The [[Shia]] and [[Sunni]] sects both agree on the essential details for the performance of these acts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1859?_hi=32&amp;_pos=3 Pillars of Islam], Oxford Islamic Studies Online&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Sufism=====
{{Main article|Sufism}}
The best known form of Islamic mystic spirituality is the [[Sufi]] tradition (famous through [[Rumi]] and [[Hafiz Shirazi|Hafiz]]) in which a spiritual master or ''[[Pir (Sufism)|pir]]'' transmits spiritual discipline to students.&lt;ref&gt;
Azeemi, K.S., "Muraqaba: The Art and Science of Sufi Meditation". Houston: Plato, 2005. ({{ISBN|0-9758875-4-8}}), Pg. xi&lt;/ref&gt;

Sufism or {{transl|ar|DIN|taṣawwuf}} ({{lang-ar|تصوّف}}) is defined by its adherents as the inner, [[mystical]] dimension of [[Islam]].&lt;ref name="Godlas"&gt;Alan Godlas, University of Georgia, ''Sufism's Many Paths'', 2000, [http://www.uga.edu/islam/Sufism.html University of Georgia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nuh Ha Mim Keller, "How would you respond to the claim that Sufism is Bid'a?", 1995.

[http://www.islamicacademy.org/html/Articles/English/Tasawwuf.htm Islamicacademy.org]&lt;/ref&gt; A practitioner of this tradition is generally known as a ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ṣūfī}}'' ({{lang|fa|صُوفِيّ}}). Sufis believe they are practicing [[ihsan]] (perfection of worship) as revealed by [[Gabriel]] to [[Muhammad]], 
{{quote|Worship and serve [[Allah]] as you are seeing Him and while you see Him not yet truly He sees you.}}

Sufis consider themselves as the original true proponents of this pure original form of Islam. They are strong adherents to the principal of tolerance, peace and against any form of violence. The Sufi have suffered severe persecution by more rigid and fundamentalist groups such as the [[Wahhabi]] and [[Salafi movement]]. In 1843 the [[Senussi]] Sufi were forced to flee Mecca and Medina and head to Sudan and Libya.&lt;ref name="FirstDynasty"&gt;{{cite book| last = Hawting| first = Gerald R.| authorlink =G. R.

Classical Sufi scholars have defined Sufism as "a science whose objective is the reparation of the heart and turning it away from all else but God".&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed Zarruq, Zaineb Istrabadi, Hamza Yusuf Hanson—"The Principles of Sufism". Amal Press. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, in the words of the [[Darqawa|Darqawi]] Sufi teacher [[Ahmad ibn Ajiba]], "a science through which one can know how to travel into the [[Divine presence|presence of the Divine]], purify one's inner self from filth, and beautify it with a variety of praiseworthy traits".&lt;ref&gt;An English translation of [[Ahmad ibn Ajiba]]'s biography has been published by Fons Vitae.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Jihad=====
{{Main article|Jihad}}
Jihad is a religious duty of [[Muslim]]s. In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], the word ''jihād'' translates as a noun meaning "struggle". There are two commonly accepted meanings of jihad: an inner spiritual struggle and an outer physical struggle.{{sfn|Morgan|2010|87}} The "greater jihad" is the inner struggle by a believer to fulfill his religious duties.{{sfn|Morgan|2010|87}}&lt;ref name=BBCjihad&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/beliefs/jihad_1.shtml|title= Jihad|accessdate= 20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This non-violent meaning is stressed by both Muslim&lt;ref&gt;[http://rissc.jo/index.php/english-publications.html Jihad and the Islamic Law of War] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818180319/http://rissc.jo/index.php/english-publications.html |date=August 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and non-Muslim&lt;ref&gt;Rudolph Peters, ''Islam and Colonialism.

=====Four paths=====
Traditionally, Hinduism identifies three ''mārga'' (ways)&lt;ref&gt;John Lochtefeld (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Rosen Publishing New York, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|See also [[Bhagavad Gita]] (The Celestial Song), Chapters 2:56-57, 12, 13:1-28}} of spiritual practice,&lt;ref&gt;D.

In the 19th century [[Vivekananda]], in his [[neo-Vedanta]] synthesis of Hinduism, added [[Rāja yoga]], the way of contemplation and meditation, as a fourth way, calling all of them "yoga."{{sfn|Michelis|2005}}{{refn|group=note|George Feuerstein: "Yoga is not easy to define. In most general terms, the Sanskrit word yoga stands for spiritual discipline in Hinduism, Jainism, and certain schools of Buddhism. (...). Yoga is the equivalent of Christian mysticism, Moslem Sufism, or the Jewish Kabbalah. A spiritual practitioner is known as a yogin (if male) or a yogini (if female)."&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, Georg (2003), The deeper dimension of yoga: Theory and practice, Shambhala, {{ISBN|1-57062-935-8}}, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jñāna marga is a path often assisted by a ''guru'' (teacher) in one's spiritual practice.&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, Georg (2003), The deeper dimension of yoga: Theory and practice, Shambhala, {{ISBN|1-57062-935-8}}, Chapter 55&lt;/ref&gt; Bhakti marga is a path of faith and devotion to deity or deities; the spiritual practice often includes chanting, singing and music - such as in ''[[kirtan]]s'' - in front of idols, or images of one or more deity, or a devotional symbol of the holy.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Varenne (1976), Yoga and the Hindu Tradition, University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|0-226-85116-8}}, pp 97-130&lt;/ref&gt; Karma marga is the path of one's work, where diligent practical work or ''vartta'' (Sanskrit: वार्त्ता, profession) becomes in itself a spiritual practice, and work in daily life is perfected as a form of spiritual liberation and not for its material rewards.&lt;ref&gt;See discussion of Hinduism and karma yoga in two different professions in these journal articles:

*Klostermaier discusses examples from Bhagavata Purana, another ancient Hindu scripture, where a forest worker discovers observing mother nature is a spiritual practice, to wisdom and liberating knowledge. The Purana suggests that "true knowledge of nature" leads to "true knowledge of Self and God." It illustrates 24 gurus that nature provides. For example, earth teaches steadfastness and the wisdom that all things while pursuing their own activities, do nothing but follow the divine laws that are universally established; another wisdom from earth is her example of accepting the good and bad from everyone. Another guru, the honeybee teaches that one must make effort to gain knowledge, a willingness and flexibility to examine, pick and collect essence from different scriptures and sources. And so on. Nature is a mirror image of spirit, perceptive awareness of nature can be spirituality.&lt;/ref&gt; Rāja marga is the path of cultivating necessary virtues, self-discipline, ''[[Tapas (Sanskrit)|tapas]]'' (meditation), contemplation and self-reflection sometimes with isolation and renunciation of the world, to a pinnacle state called ''[[samadhi|samādhi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Vivekananda, S.

There is a rigorous debate in Indian literature on relative merits of these theoretical spiritual practices. For example, [[Chandogya Upanishad|Chandogyopanishad]] suggests that those who engage in ritualistic offerings to gods and priests will fail in their spiritual practice, while those who engage in ''tapas'' will succeed; [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad|Svetasvataropanishad]] suggests that a successful spiritual practice requires a longing for truth, but warns of becoming 'false ascetic' who go through the mechanics of spiritual practice without meditating on the nature of Self and universal Truths.&lt;ref name=crp&gt;See:

These four paths of spirituality are also known in Hinduism outside India, such as in [[Balinese Hinduism]], where it is called ''Catur Marga'' (literally: four paths).&lt;ref&gt;Murdana, I.

=====Schools and spirituality=====
Different schools of Hinduism encourage different spiritual practices. In [[Tantra#Hinduism|Tantric]] school for example, the spiritual practice has been referred to as ''[[sādhanā]]''. It involves initiation into the school, undergoing rituals, and achieving moksha liberation by experiencing union of cosmic polarities.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Flood (1996), An Introduction to Hinduism, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-43878-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] school emphasizes bhakti yoga as spiritual practice.&lt;ref&gt;Rochford, E. B. (1985), Hare Krishna in America, Rutgers University Press; {{ISBN|978-0813511146}}, page 12&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Advaita Vedanta]] school, the spiritual practice emphasizes jñāna yoga in stages: samnyasa (cultivate virtues), sravana (hear, study), manana (reflect) and dhyana (nididhyasana, contemplate).&lt;ref&gt;See:

===African spirituality===
{{Main article|Traditional African religion}}
In some African contexts,{{which|date= November 2018}} spirituality is considered a belief system that guides the welfare of society and the people therein, and eradicates sources of unhappiness occasioned by evil.{{citation needed|date= November 2018}}

==Contemporary spirituality==
{{See also|New Age}}

The term "spiritual" is now frequently used in contexts in which the term "religious" was formerly employed.{{sfn|Gorsuch|1999}} Contemporary spirituality is also called "post-traditional spirituality" and "[[New Age]] spirituality".{{sfn|Otterloo|2012|p=239, 240}} Hanegraaf makes a distinction between two "New Age" movements: [[New Age]] in a restricted sense, which originated primarily in mid-twentieth century England and had its roots in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and [[Anthroposophy]], and "New Age" in a general sense, which emerged in the later 1970s
{{quote|when increasing numbers of people ... began to perceive a broad similarity between a wide variety of "alternative ideas" and pursuits, and started to think of them as part of one "movement"".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=97}}}}

Those who speak of spirituality outside of religion often define themselves as ''[[SBNR|spiritual but not religious]]'' and generally believe in the existence of different "spiritual paths," emphasizing the importance of finding one's own individual path to spirituality. According to one 2005 poll, about 24% of the United States population identifies itself as spiritual but not religious.&lt;ref group=web&gt;http://www.beliefnet.com/News/2005/08/Newsweekbeliefnet-Poll-Results.aspx#spiritrel&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characteristics===
Modern spirituality is centered on the "deepest values and meanings by which people live."&lt;ref name=Sheldrake&gt;Philip Sheldrake, ''A Brief History of Spirituality'', Wiley-Blackwell 2007 p. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; It embraces the idea of an ultimate or an alleged immaterial [[reality]].&lt;ref&gt;Ewert Cousins, preface to Antoine Faivre and Jacob Needleman, ''Modern Esoteric Spirituality'', Crossroad Publishing 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; It envisions an [[Involution (philosophy)|inner path]] enabling a person to discover the essence of his/her being.

Not all modern notions of spirituality embrace transcendental ideas. [[Secular spirituality]] emphasizes [[humanistic]] ideas on [[moral character]] (qualities such as love, [[compassion]], patience, tolerance, forgiveness, contentment, responsibility, harmony, and a concern for others).&lt;ref name=Dalai/&gt;{{rp|22}} These are aspects of life and human experience which go beyond a purely materialist view of the world without necessarily accepting belief in a supernatural reality or divine being. Nevertheless, many humanists (e.g. [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]) who clearly value the non-material, communal and virtuous aspects of life reject this usage of the term spirituality as being overly-broad (i.e. it effectively amounts to saying "everything and anything that is good and virtuous is ''necessarily'' spiritual").&lt;ref name="Schuurmans-Stekhoven, J. B. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schuurmans-Stekhoven | first1 = J. B. | year = 2011 | title = Is it God or just the data that moves in mysterious ways? How well-being research might be mistaking faith for virtue? | url = | journal = Social Indicators Research | volume = 100 | issue = 2| pages = 313–330 | doi = 10.1007/s11205-010-9630-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930 Russell, a renowned atheist, wrote "... one's ego is no very large part of the world. The man [sic.] who can center his thoughts and hopes upon something transcending self can find a certain peace in the ordinary troubles of life which is impossible to the pure egoist." &lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell ''The conquest of happiness" Horace Liveright Inc. 1930, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Aristotle—one of the first known Western thinkers to demonstrate that morality, virtue and goodness can be derived without appealing to supernatural forces—even argued that "men create Gods in their own image" (not the other way around). Moreover, theistic and atheistic critics alike dismiss the need for the "secular spirituality" label on the basis that appears to be nothing more than [[obscurantism]] in that i) the term "spirit" is commonly taken as denoting the existence of unseen / otherworldly / life-giving forces and ii) words such as morality, [[philanthropy]] and [[humanism]] already efficiently and succinctly describe the prosocial-orientation and civility that the phrase [[secular spirituality]] is meant to convey but without risk of potential confusion that one is referring to something supernatural. 
 
Although personal well-being, both physical and [[Emotional well-being|psychological]], is said to be an important aspect of modern spirituality, this does not imply spirituality is ''essential'' to achieving happiness (e.g. [http://pcl.missouri.edu/jeff/sites/pcl.missouri.edu.jeff/files/Diener.pdf see]).  Free-thinkers who reject notions that the numinous/non-material is important to living well can be just as happy as more spiritually-oriented individuals ([http://www.scienceonreligion.org/index.php/news-research/research-updates/306-does-spirituality-help-well-being-or-do-we-just-need-to-be-good-to-each-other see])&lt;ref&gt;Maisel, E. (2009). The atheist's way: Living well without gods, New World Library, Novato)&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary spirituality theorists ''assert'' that spirituality develops [[inner peace]] and forms a foundation for [[happiness]].

Yet such spiritually-informed treatment approaches have been challenged as [[pseudoscience]], are far from uniformly curative and may for non-believers cause harm (see [[iatrogenesis]]).

===Spiritual experience===
{{Main article|Religious experience}}
"Spiritual experience" plays a central role in modern spirituality.{{sfn|Sharf|1995-B}} This notion has been popularised by both western and Asian authors.{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}}{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}} Important early 20th century western writers who studied the phenomenon of spirituality, and their works, include [[William James]], ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'' (1902), and [[Rudolph Otto]], especially ''[[The Idea of the Holy]]'' (1917). James' notions of  "spiritual experience" had a further influence on the modernist streams in Asian traditions, making them even further recognisable for a western audience.{{sfn|Sharf|1995}}

William James popularized the use of the term "religious experience" in his The Varieties of Religious Experience.{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}} It has also influenced the understanding of mysticism as a distinctive experience which supplies knowledge.&lt;ref group=web name="Stanford"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mysticism/ |title=Gellman, Jerome, "Mysticism", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wayne Proudfoot]] traces the roots of the notion of "religious experience" further back to the German theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768–1834), who argued that religion is based on a ''feeling'' of the infinite. The notion of "religious experience" was used by Schleiermacher to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique. It was adopted by many scholars of religion, of which William James was the most influential.{{sfn|Sharf|2000|p=271}}

Major Asian influences were Vivekananda{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=191}} and D.T. Suzuki.{{sfn|Sharf|1995-B}} [[Swami Vivekananda]] popularised a modern [[Syncretism|syncretitistic]] Hinduism,{{sfn|Sinari|2000}}{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}} in which the authority of the scriptures was replaced by an emphasis on personal experience.{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}}{{sfn|Comans|1993}} [[D.T. Suzuki]] had a major influence on the popularisation of [[Zen in the United States|Zen in the west]] and popularized the idea of enlightenment as insight into a timeless, transcendent reality.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/CriticalZen/whose%20zen_sharf.pdf |title=Robert H.

Its History and Method |publisher=Thezensite.com |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} Another example can be seen in [[Paul Brunton]]'s ''A Search in Secret India'', which introduced [[Ramana Maharshi]] and [[Meher Baba]] to a western audience.

Spiritual experiences can include being connected to a larger reality, yielding a more comprehensive [[self]]; joining with other individuals or the [[human]] [[community]]; with [[nature]] or the [[cosmos]]; or with the [[Divinity|divine]] realm.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret A. Burkhardt and Mary Gail Nagai-Jacobson, ''Spirituality: living our connectedness'', Delmar Cengage Learning, p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spiritual practices===
{{Main article|Spiritual practice}}
Waaijman discerns four forms of spiritual practices:{{sfn|Waaijman|2000|p=644-645}}
# Somatic practices, especially deprivation and diminishment. Deprivation aims to purify the body. Diminishment concerns the repulsement of ego-oriented impulses. Examples include fasting and poverty.{{sfn|Waaijman|2000|p=644-645}}
# Psychological practices, for example meditation.{{sfn|Waaijman|2000|p=645}}
# Social practices. Examples include the practice of obedience and communal ownership, reforming ego-orientedness into other-orientedness.{{sfn|Waaijman|2000|p=645}}
# Spiritual. All practices aim at purifying ego-centeredness, and direct the abilities at the divine reality.{{sfn|Waaijman|2000|p=645}}

Spiritual practices may include [[meditation]], [[mindfulness]], [[prayer]], the contemplation of [[sacred text]]s, [[ethic]]al development,&lt;ref name=Dalai&gt;Dalai Lama, ''Ethics for the New Millennium'', NY:Riverhead Books, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; and spiritual retreats in a convent. Love and/or compassion are often{{quantify|date=December 2015}} described as the mainstay of spiritual development.&lt;ref name=Dalai/&gt;

Within spirituality is also found "a common emphasis on the value of thoughtfulness, tolerance for breadth and practices and beliefs, and appreciation for the insights of other religious communities, as well as other sources of authority within the social sciences."&lt;ref&gt;

Social bonds available via secular sources (i.e.,  not unique to spirituality or faith-based groups) might just as effectively raise well-being.

==High school career==
Burfict attended [[Centennial High School (Corona, California)|Centennial High School]] in [[Corona, California]], where he was part of an undefeated Huskies team that won a [[California Interscholastic Federation|CIF]] title, a state championship with the help of quarterback [[Taylor Martinez]], and was ranked second in the nation by ''[[USA Today]]'' in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |date=December 22, 2008 |title=Fort Lauderdale's Aquinas finishes season atop Super 25 |newspaper=USA Today |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/preps/football/poll/2008-super25.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Burfict led the Huskies with 159 [[Tackle (football move)|tackles]], two [[quarterback sack]]s, two [[interception]]s and two [[Fumble (American football)|fumble]] recoveries. Burfict participated in the [[US Army All-American Bowl]] and was the third-leading tackler for the West team. He also earned numerous All-American honors, including ''Parade''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=O'Shea |first=Michael |date=January 25, 2009 |title=Meet PARADE's All-America High School Football Team |newspaper=Parade |url=http://www.parade.com/news/all-america/2009/parade-all-america-high-school-football-team.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a junior, Burfict collected a team-high 130 tackles and added four sacks, two interceptions and one fumble recovery.

On October 6, 2010, Burfict was benched by Arizona State head coach Dennis Erickson. The reason given was Burfict's unusually high number of personal foul penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.azcentral.com/sports/asu/articles/2010/10/05/20101005arizona-state-football-burfict-benched.html |title=Dennis Erickson takes Vontaze Burfict out of Arizona State starting lineup vs. Washington |first=Jeff |last=Metcalfe |date=October 5, 2010 |newspaper=The Arizona Republic }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a game against [[2010 Stanford Cardinal football team|Stanford]], Burfict was called for grabbing the facemask of [[Doug Baldwin]], and—after complaining to the referee—charged with a personal foul for unsportsmanlike conduct that gave Stanford a first down at the ASU 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Youtube|sjxxWFNJN-U|Highlights: (6) Stanford - ASU}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two plays later, Stanford scored what turned out to be the winning touchdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.azcentral.com/sports/asu/articles/2010/11/13/20101113asu-vontaze-burfict-mistakes.html |title=ASU football team sees spirited effort derailed by Vontaze Burfict's mistakes |work=The Arizona Republic |date=November 13, 2010 |first=Paola |last=Boivin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==

===2012 NFL Draft===
When he entered his junior season, Burfict was regarded as one of the best linebackers available in the [[2012 NFL Draft]], projected to go as high as the fifth pick.&lt;ref name="Prisco2012early"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/15014424/flash-forward-top-32-picks-for-the-2012-nfl-draft |title=Flash forward: Top 32 picks for the 2012 NFL Draft |date=May 1, 2011 |work=[[CBSSports.com]] |first=Pete |last=Prisco }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pauline2012early"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/football/nfl/05/03/2012.prospects/ |title=Stanford's Luck headlines early look at top 2012 draft prospects |work=Sports Illustrated |date=May 3, 2011 |first=Tony |last=Pauline}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuter2012early"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/story/15029593/mock-draft-first-look-with-luck-and-heels |title=2012 mock draft: First look with Luck and Heels |work=CBSSports.com |date=May 4, 2011 |first=Chad |last=Reuter }}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems on and off the field at Arizona State, however, caused his draft stock to plummet. In October 2011, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''′s Tony Pauline still ranked him as the No. 20 prospect on his midseason draft board, but noted that he has been "a loose cannon on and off the field, which has raised red flags."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/tony_pauline/10/24/top.50/ |title=Andrew Luck, Trent Richardson high in midseason NFL draft rankings |date=October 24, 2011 |work=SI.com |first=Tony |last=Pauline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burfict entered the [[NFL Combine]] rated as the third best inside linebacker, behind [[Luke Kuechly]] and [[Dont'a Hightower]], but his "disappointing" performance—including a 5.09 sec in the [[40-yard dash]], slowest among linebackers—caused some analysts to project him as a third day (Rd. 4-7) draft pick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rob-rang.blogs.cbssports.com/mcc/blogs/entry/13682485/35011522 |title=Lackluster Combine could push Burfict to Day 3 |work=CBS Sports |first=Rob |last=Rang |date=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/don_banks/02/29/combine.awards/index.html?xid=si_nfl |title=Andrew Luck, Stephen Hill, Vontaze Burfict make their mark on NFL combine |first=Don |last=Banks |work=SI.com |date=February 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NFL scouts also faulted him for his interview process, in which he blamed the Arizona State coaching staff for his mediocre junior season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bruce-feldman.blogs.cbssports.com/mcc/blogs/entry/31626208/35006810 |work=CBS Sports |first=Bruce |last=Feldman |date=February 27, 2012 |title=Burfict from yellow flags to red ones?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later it was also reported that Burfict tested positive for [[marijuana]] at the combine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/arizona|title=Arizona|first=Fox|last=Sports|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 season===
An undrafted rookie, Burfict managed to make the Cincinnati Bengals' roster. He played in all 16 games and started 14 of those, finishing the seasons as the Bengals' top tackler with 127 combined tackles, including 18 tackles in their final game of the year against their divisional rival [[2012 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]].

Burfict also topped the list for the NFL'Performance-Based Pay' program with earning $299,465.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000152307/article/vontaze-burfict-earns-top-figure-in-performancebased-pay|title=Vontaze Burfict earns top figure in 'Performance-Based Pay'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Æthelwold''', also known as '''Æthelwald''' or '''Æþelwald''' ([[Old English]]: ''Æþelwald'' "noble ruler"; reigned c. 654–664), was a 7th-century king of [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]], the long-lived [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdom which today includes the English counties of [[Norfolk]] and [[Suffolk]]. He was a member of the [[Wuffingas]] dynasty, which [[List of monarchs of East Anglia|ruled East Anglia]] from their ''regio'' (centre of royal authority) at [[Rendlesham]]. The two Anglo-Saxon cemeteries at [[Sutton Hoo]], the monastery at [[Iken]], the East Anglian [[Episcopal see|see]] at [[Dommoc]] and the emerging port of [[Ipswich]] were all in the vicinity of Rendlesham.

Æthelwold lived during a time of political and religious upheaval in East Anglia, whose Christian kings in the decades prior to his succession all died violent deaths, having proved unworthy of the task of defending the newly converted kingdom against attacks from its neighbouring kingdom, [[Mercia]], led by its pagan king, [[Penda of Mercia|Penda]].  Æthelwold was the last of the nephews of [[Rædwald of East Anglia|Rædwald]] to rule East Anglia. He died in 664 and was succeeded by [[Ealdwulf of East Anglia|Ealdwulf]], the son of his brother Æthelric.

Few records relating to East Anglia have survived and almost nothing is known of Æthelwold's life or reign.  He succeeded his elder brother [[Æthelhere of East Anglia|Æthelhere]], after Æthelhere was killed with Penda of Mercia at the [[Battle of the Winwaed|Battle of the Winwæd]] in about 655. During his rule he witnessed a setback in the aspirations of Mercia to dominate its neighbours, following the Battle of the Winwæd and the murder of Penda's son, [[Peada of Mercia|Peada]].

He was king during the last decade of the co-existence in England of the Christian [[Roman rite]], centred at [[Canterbury]], and the [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic rite]] based in [[Northumbria]].  At the [[Synod of Whitby]], in 664, the Roman cause prevailed and the division of ecclesiastical authorities ceased. In 662, [[Swithelm of Essex]] was persuaded to adopt Christianity and was [[baptised]] at Rendlesham, with Æthelwold present as his sponsor. East Anglia became more closely allied to Northumbria, [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]] and lands in the [[Fens]] by means of royal marriages such as that between the Northumbrian [[Hereswitha]] and the East Anglian Æthilric.

==Historical context==
[[File:England green top.svg|250px|thumb|right|A map of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]], including places relevant to Æthelwold's reign]]

===The emergence of the Kingdom of the East Angles===
The history of [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]] and its kings is known from ''[[The Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', compiled by the [[Northumbrian]] monk [[Bede]] in 731, and a genealogical list from the ''[[Anglian collection]]'', dating from the 790s, in which the ancestry of [[Ælfwald of East Anglia]] was traced back through fourteen generations to [[Wōden]].&lt;ref&gt;Warner, ''The Origins of Suffolk'', p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

East Anglia was a long-lived [[Anglo-Saxon]] kingdom in which a duality of a northern and a southern part existed, corresponding with the modern English counties of [[Norfolk]] and [[Suffolk]].&lt;ref&gt;Lapidge, ''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; It was formed during the 5th century, following the ending of [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman power in Britain]] in 410.&lt;ref&gt;Plunkett, ''Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times'', pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; The east of Britain became settled at an early date by [[Saxons]] and [[Angles]] from the continent. During the 5th century, groups of settlers of mixed stock migrated into [[the Fens]] and up the major rivers inland.&lt;ref&gt;Warner, ''The Origins of Suffolk'', pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; From Bede it is known that the people who settled in what became East Anglia were Angles, originally from what is now part of [[Denmark]]. By the 6th century, new settlements had also appeared along the river systems of the east coast of East Anglia, including the [[River Deben|Deben]], the [[River Alde|Alde]] and the [[River Orwell|Orwell]].&lt;ref&gt;Warner, ''The Origins of Suffolk'', p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; The settlers were unaffected by Roman urban civilisation and had their own [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|religion]] and language. As more of the region fell under their control, new kingdoms were formed, replacing the function of the Roman ''territoria''.&lt;ref&gt;Warner, ''The Origins of Suffolk'', pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt; Surrounded by sea, fenland, large defensive earthworks such as the [[Devil's Dyke, Cambridgeshire|Devil's Dyke]] and wide rivers, all of which acted to disconnect it from the rest of Britain, the land of the East Angles eventually became united by a single ruling dynasty, the Wuffingas.

===Rædwald and his successors===
The first king of the East Angles of whom more than a name is known was [[Rædwald of East Anglia|Rædwald]], described by Bede as 'the son of Tytil, whose father was Wuffa',&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, ''The Earliest English Kings'', p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; who reigned from about 599 until approximately 624. According to Bede, he was converted to [[Christianity]] at the court of his overlord [[Æthelberht of Kent]] in about 604. Later in his reign he was powerful enough to hold ''imperium'' over several [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]]. In 616, he defeated [[Æthelfrith of Northumbria]] and installed the exiled [[Edwin of Northumbria|Edwin]] as the new king.&lt;ref&gt;Lapidge, ''The Blackwall Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt;  He is thought to have been given a [[ship burial]] and interred amongst a magnificent array of personal treasures and symbols of regal power that were discovered under Mound 1 at [[Sutton Hoo]], in Suffolk.&lt;ref&gt;Plunkett, ''Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times'', p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; His son [[Eorpwald of East Anglia|Eorpwald]] succeeded him and reigned briefly before he was killed soon after his baptism, by a heathen named [[Ricberht of East Anglia|Ricberht]], after which the East Angles reverted to paganism.&lt;ref&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Ricberht was replaced by [[Sigeberht of East Anglia|Sigeberht]], whose Christian education ensured that Christianity was reestablished. During Sigeberht's joint reign with [[Ecgric of East Anglia|Ecgric]], the East Anglian [[Episcopal see|see]] at [[Dommoc]] was established.&lt;ref&gt;Plunkett, ''Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times'', pp. 100–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

During 632 or 633, Edwin of Northumbria was overthrown and slain and his kingdom was ravaged by [[Cadwallon ap Cadfan]], supported by [[Penda of Mercia]].&lt;ref&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt; The Mercians then turned on the East Angles and their king, Ecgric. In 640 or 641, they routed the East Anglian army in a battle in which Ecgric and his predecessor [[Sigeberht of East Anglia|Sigeberht]] both perished.&lt;ref name="W110-13"&gt;Warner, ''The Origins of Suffolk'', pp. 110–13. See Kirby, ''The Early English Kings'', p. 207 for a discussion of the problematic dating of the battle in which Ecgric was killed.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecgric's successor, Æthelwold's brother [[Anna of East Anglia|Anna]], who was renowned for his devout Christianity and the saintliness of his children, proved ineffective in preventing East Anglia from being invaded by the Mercians. Following a Mercian attack in 651 on the monastery at [[Cnobheresburg]], Anna was exiled by Penda, possibly to the kingdom of the [[Magonsæte]]. After his return, East Anglia was attacked again by Penda, Anna's forces were defeated and he was killed. During the reign of his successor, [[Æthelhere of East Anglia|Æthelhere]] (another brother of Æthelwold), East Anglia was eclipsed by Mercia. In 655, after the Battle of the Winwæd, near [[Leeds]], in which Æthelhere was slain fighting beside Penda,&lt;ref name="Y63"&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; a new political situation arose. Penda's son [[Peada of Mercia|Peada]], who had ruled the [[Mercia]]n province of the [[Middle Angles]] as a Christian king from 653,&lt;ref name="Y63"/&gt; now succeeded Penda as king of Mercia, but he was murdered a year later.&lt;ref&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Peada's death dealt a severe blow to Mercian aspirations of dominion over the other kingdoms of England.

=== The sphere of Rendlesham ===
The royal seat of Rendlesham, specified by Bede,&lt;ref&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', pp. 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt; seals the evident importance of the Deben estuary headwaters as a centre of royal power, demonstrated for an earlier period by the royal cemetery of [[Sutton Hoo]].&lt;ref&gt;Plunkett, ''Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times'', pp. 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt; Rendlesham, a short distance from [[Iken]], the site of Botolph's monastery, stands at a strategic point between the rivers [[River Deben|Deben]] and [[River Alde|Alde]] at the headwaters of the [[River Butley|Butley]] estuary, which intersects the peninsula between the two major rivers. The dedication of Rendlesham's church to [[Pope Gregory I|St Gregory]] suggests its early, perhaps primary connection with the royal dwelling mentioned by Bede. If the [[Dommoc]] bishopric was at [[Walton, Suffolk|Walton]], as [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] claimed in the thirteenth century, then this was also immediately within the sphere of Rendlesham. Archaeologists have revealed that the quay of Gipeswic (now modern [[Ipswich]]), at a ford of the [[River Orwell]] estuary, was then growing in importance as a centre of seaborne trade to the continent, under direct royal patronage.&lt;ref&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descent, family and accession==
Æthelwold, ([[Old English]] 'noble ruler')&lt;ref&gt;Bosworth, ''A dictionary of the Anglo-Saxon language'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=WRkAAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA286&amp;ots=F27Sijc9yr&amp;dq=wald%20ruler%20raed%20counsel&amp;pg=PA12#v=onepage&amp;q=ethel&amp;f=false pp. 12, 438.]&lt;/ref&gt; was a member of the Wuffingas dynasty, the youngest son of [[Eni of East Anglia|Eni]] and a nephew of Rædwald of East Anglia. Two of his brothers, Anna and Æthelhere, ruled in succession before him.&lt;ref&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

His accession is mentioned by the 12th-century historian [[William of Malmesbury]], in ''[[Gesta Regum Anglorum]]'': 
:"''To Anna succeeded his brother Ethelhere, who was justly slain by Oswy king of the Northumbrians, together with Penda, because he was an auxiliary to him, and was actually supporting his brother and his kinsman. His brother Ethelwald, in due succession, left the kingdom to Adulf and Elwold, the sons of Ethelhere''."&lt;ref&gt;William of Malmesbury, ''Gesta regum Anglorum'' Book 1, chp. 5, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=quote&gt;''"Successit Annæ frater ejus Ethelhere, occisusque est a rege Northanhimbrorum Oswio cum Penda merito, quod ei concurreret in auxilium, et fulciret exercitum qui pessum dedisset fratrem et cognatum. Hujus successor frater Ethelwaldus continuatis successionibus regnum reliquit ejusdem Ethelherii filiis Aldnlfo."'' ([https://archive.org/stream/willelmimalmesb00unkngoog#page/n169/mode/2up William of Malmesbury, Book 1, §97])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dynastic alliances bound Æthelwold's kingdom strongly to the Christian [[kingdom of Kent]], where [[Seaxburh of Ely|Seaxburh]], the eldest daughter of Æthelwold's elder brother Anna, was [[Eorcenberht of Kent]]'s queen.&lt;ref name="Yorke, p. 37"&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; East Anglia's western stronghold in the [[The Fens|Fens]] was held by Seaxburh's sister [[Æthelthryth]] and, like Kent, it was devoutly attached to the Roman Church. There was also an important Northumbrian connection: in 657, [[Hilda of Whitby|Hilda]] established the monastery of Streoneshalh (identified with [[Whitby]]), which later became the burial-place of Edwin and other Northumbrian kings. Hilda's sister [[Hereswitha]] married Æthelwold's youngest brother Æthelric in around 627–629.&lt;ref&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reign ==

=== Christianity in East Anglia under Æthelwold ===
[[File:Williamson p16 3.svg|thumb|250px|right|The kingdom of East Anglia during the early Saxon period]]
The influence of the [[Celtic rite]] in East Anglia had been strong whilst the monastery of [[Saint Fursey]] and [[Foillan|Saint Foillan]] at [[Burgh Castle|Cnobheresburg]] had existed. The authority of East Anglian Christianity still resided in the East Anglian [[Episcopal see|see]] at Dommoc, obedient to [[Province of Canterbury|Canterbury]]. [[Saint Botolph]] began to build his monastery at [[Iken]], on a tidal island site in the [[River Alde]], [[Suffolk]], in about 653, the year that [[Anna of East Anglia]] was killed at the Battle of Bulcamp.&lt;ref&gt;Plunkett, ''Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times'', p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;!--  If the legend that Botolph came to East Anglia through contact with the daughters of Anna at [[Faremoutiers Abbey]] is true, he may have received Celtic teaching there, since the abbess [[Burgundofara]] was reputedly instructed by [[Columbanus|Saint Columbanus]], the Irish missionary to [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]. Anna's daughter [[Æthelburh of Faremoutiers]] succeeded Burgundofara as abbess at Faremoutiers at about this time. --&gt;

Oswiu successfully persuaded [[Sigeberht the Good|Sigeberht II of the East Saxons]] to receive baptism&lt;ref&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cedd]], a Northumbrian disciple of Aidan's, was diverted from the Northumbrian mission to the Middle Angles under Peada to become Bishop of the East Saxons and re-convert the people. Cedd built monasteries at [[East Tilbury|Tilbury]] in the south and at [[Othona|Ythancæster]], where there was an old Roman fort, at what is now [[Bradwell-on-Sea]], in north-east [[Essex]].&lt;ref&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Sigebert was assassinated by his own thegns and was succeeded by the pagan [[Swithelm of Essex]]. Cedd persuaded him to accept the faith and, according to Bede, his baptism by Cedd took place at [[Rendlesham]], in the presence of King Æthelwold:&lt;ref name="Y63"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Sigebert was succeeded in the kingdom by Suidhelm, the son of Sexbald, who was baptized by the same Cedd, in the province of the East Angles, at the king's countryseat, called Rendelsham, that is, Rendil's Mansion; and Ethelwald, king of the East Angles, brother to Anna, king of the same people, was his godfather."''&lt;ref&gt;Bede, ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', [[:s:Ecclesiastical History of the English People/Book 3#22|iii, p. 22]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=quote&gt;''"Successit autem Sigbercto inregnum Suidhelm, filius Sexbaldi, qui baptizatus est ab ipso Cedde in prouincia Orientalium Anglorum, in uico regio, qui dicitur Rendlasham, id est mansio Rendili; suscepitque eum ascendentem de fonto sancto Aediluald rex ipsius gentis Orientalium Anglorum, frater Anna regis eorundem."'' ([http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bede/bede3.shtml#22 Bede, iii, 22])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== East Anglian marriage alliances ===
In the early 660s, two important marriages took place. [[Ecgfrith of Northumbria]], the fifteen-year-old son of Oswiu, married Æthelthryth of [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]], the daughter of Anna of East Anglia, (who was about fourteen years older than him), and moved to live with him at his Northumbrian court. She had remained a virgin for Christ during her first marriage: she continued in this resolve as Ecgfrityh's bride, with the result that he could not expect to father an heir. Æthelthryth retained Ely as her own possession during this marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', pp. 66, 81, 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, [[Wulfhere of Mercia]], a brother of Peada, emerged from safe retreat and was proclaimed king. He was not Christian, but was soon converted and subsequently married Eormenhilda, daughter of [[Eorcenberht of Kent]] and Seaxburh.&lt;ref name="Yorke, p. 37"/&gt; Soon afterwards he founded the monastery of [[Medeshamstede]], which later became known as [[Peterborough]], under abbot Seaxwulf.

== Synod of Whitby ==
{{main|Synod of Whitby}}
Following the death of [[Finan of Lindisfarne|Finan]], bishop of Lindisfarne, [[Alhfrith of Deira]], in collusion with [[Wilfrid|Wilfred of York]], [[Agilbert]] of Wessex and others, were determined to persuade Oswiu to rule in favour of the Roman rite of Christianity within the kingdoms over which he had ''imperium''. The case was debated in Oswiu's presence at the [[Synod of Whitby]] in 664, with [[Colmán of Lindisfarne|Colmán]], [[Hilda of Whitby|Hild]] and [[Cedd]] defending the Celtic rite and the tradition inherited from [[Aidan of Lindisfarne|Aidan]], and Wilifred speaking for the Roman position.&lt;ref&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman cause prevailed and the former division of ecclesiastical authorities was set aside. Those who could not accept it, including Colmán, departed elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;
