{{hatnote|This article deals primarily with Acquired characteristics by humans. You can improve this article by adding information about Acquired characteristics by plants and non-human animals.}}
An '''acquired characteristic''' is a [[Heredity|non-heritable]] change in a function or structure of a living [[biotic material]] caused after birth by disease, injury, accident, deliberate modification, variation, repeated use, disuse, or misuse, or other environmental influences. Acquired traits, which is [[synonym]]ous with acquired characteristics, are not [[August Weismann#Experiments on the inheritance of mutilations|passed on]] to offspring through reproduction alone.

The changes that constitute acquired characteristics can have many manifestations and degrees of visibility but they all have one thing in common: they change a facet of a living organisms' function or structure after the organism has left the womb.

*The children of former [[bodybuilder]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] may have highly developed or otherwise above average musculature.{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; acquired characteristics do not change the inheritable genes in gametes.|date=August 2015}}
*"Lucky", an adult, three-legged dog who got her name after surviving being hit by a car when she was a pup, just gave birth to five puppies. None had [[limp]]s, malformed/abnormal legs, or were missing a leg.
*[[Bonsai]] are normal plants that have been grown to remain small through [[Bonsai cultivation and care|cultivation]] techniques.

Acquired characteristics can be minor and temporary like bruises, [[blister]]s, shaving body hair, and body building. Permanent but inconspicuous or invisible ones are [[LASIK|corrective]] eye surgery and organ [[Transplant surgery|transplant]] or [[List of surgical procedures|removal]].
Semi-permanent but inconspicuous or invisible traits are [[vaccination]]s and [[laser hair removal]]. [[Perm (hairstyle)|Perms]], [[tattoo]]s, [[scar]]s, and [[amputation]]s are semi-permanent and highly visible.

Applying [[Cosmetics|makeup]] and nailpolish, [[Hair coloring|dying]] one's hair or applying [[henna]] to the skin, and [[tooth whitening]] are  '''not''' examples of acquired traits. They change the appearance of a facet of an organism, but do not change the structure or functionality.

[[Inheritance of acquired characters]] was historically proposed by renowned [[theorist]]s such as [[Hippocrates]], [[Aristotle]], and French [[naturalist]] [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]. Conversely, this [[hypothesis]] was denounced by other renowned theorists such as [[Charles Darwin]].
Today, although [[Lamarckism]] is generally discredited, there is still debate on whether ''some'' acquired characteristics in organisms are actually inheritable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc = 1320859|title=The Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics |

Acquired characteristics, by definition, are characteristics that are gained by an organism after birth as a result of external influences or its own activities that change its structure or function and cannot be inherited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/acquired+characteristic |title=Acquired characteristic - definition of acquired characteristic by The Free Dictionary |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/acquired+characteristic?qsrc=2446 |title=Acquired characteristic &amp;#124; Define Acquired characteristic at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Acquired+characteristics |title=Acquired characteristics &amp;#124; definition of Acquired characteristics by Medical dictionary |publisher=Medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, every condition an organism is born with must be considered an inherited characteristic.

[[Heredity|Inherited characteristics]], by definition, are characteristics that are gained or predisposed to by an organism as a result of genetic transmission from its parents and will be passed to the organism's offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Inherited+trait |title=Inherited trait - definition of Inherited trait by The Free Dictionary |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/inherited+character?qsrc=2446T |title=Inherited character &amp;#124; Define Inherited character at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Inherited+trait |title=Inherited trait &amp;#124; definition of inherited trait by Medical dictionary |publisher=Medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, every condition an organism does not gain or develop because of inheritance of its parents' genetic [[Gene|information]] must be considered an acquired characteristic.

===Eye color===
It is fairly common for [[mammal]]ian eyes to [[Eye color#Changes in eye color|change]] color in the first years of life. This happens, with human infants and kittens being some well-known examples, because the eyes of the baby, just like the rest of its body, are still developing. This change can be as simple as blue to brown, or can involve multiple color changes in which neither the child's parents nor his/her doctors know when the changes will stop and what the final eye color will be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/ask-heidi/baby-eye-color.aspx |title=Baby's Eye Color |website=What To Expect|date= |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in [[eye color]] signal changes in the arrangement and concentration of [[pigment]] in the [[iris (anatomy)|iris]], which is an example of [[structural color]]. Even though this change happens after birth, it is strictly as result of genes. While changes in eye appearance (and function, and structure) that occur because of acquired characteristics like injury, illness, old age, or malnutrition are definitely acquired characteristics, the infantile color change as described above is ''usually'' considered inherited.

=== Certain genetic conditions ===
When diseases are caused by environmental influences, such as [[iodine deficiency]] or [[lead poisoning]], their resultant symptoms are [[Wiktionary:unequivocal|unequivocally]] agreed to be acquired characteristics. However, it is debatable whether changes in bodily functions due to disorders that are [[Genetic predisposition|partly]] or wholly [[Genetic disorder|genetic]] in origin are actually "acquired".

Wholly genetic disorders, such as [[Huntington's disease|Huntingtons]], are ticking time-bombs that are inherited from parents' genes and are present before birth but the symptoms that develop, aka are "acquired", after birth are simply delayed manifestations of the inherited trait.

Disorders that are partially genetic, such as [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]] and [[Allergy|allergies]], mean the organism has inherited a [[Genetic predisposition|predisposition]] to develop, aka "acquire", a certain condition but that inherited increased likelihood can be reduced or further increased [[sufficient causes|depending]] on acquired [[Host factor|characteristics]] of the organism.

===De novo mutations===
New mutations, (often [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]], spontaneous and sporadic), not inherited from either parent are called [[:wikt:de novo|de novo]] mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zhao |first1=Xiaoyue |last2=Leotta |first2=Anthony |last3=Kustanovich |first3=Vlad |last4=Lajonchere |first4=Clara |last5=Geschwind |first5=Daniel H. |last6=Law |first6=Kiely |last7=Law |first7=Paul |last8=Qiu |first8=Shanping |last9=Lord |first9=Catherine |last10=Sebat |first10=Jonathan |last11=Ye |first11=Kenny |last12=Wigler |first12=Michael |title=A unified genetic theory for sporadic and inherited autism |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=104 |issue=31 |pages=12831–6 |year=2007 |pmid=17652511 |pmc=1933261 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0705803104 |bibcode=2007PNAS..10412831Z |jstor=25436390 |laysummary=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070724113757.htm |laysource=ScienceDaily |laydate=July 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The consensus on whether certain prenatal spontaneous [[mutation]]s and [[genetic disorder]]s that occur as a result of [[Meiosis|meiotic]] and [[Chromosome abnormality|chromosome]] errors&lt;ref name="New Genetic Risk Factor"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/11/101104154221.htm |title="New Genetic Risk Factor for Both Autism and Schizophrenia" |quote="Researchers have uncovered a prominent genetic risk factor for autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia.

Mutations and meiotic errors can be considered inherited since the organism is [[Non-communicable disease#Inherited diseases|born]] with them ''in its genes'', but they can also be seen as [[Prenatal development|prenatal]] acquired characteristics since they are ''not actually inherited'' from its parents.&lt;ref name="New Model For Autism"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070724113757.htm |title="New Model For Autism Suggests Women Carry The Disorder And Explains Age As A Risk Factor" |quote="Spontaneous mutations are changes in a chromosome that alter genes. Germ-line mutations are newly acquired in a germ cell of a parent, and sometimes are transmitted to offspring at conception. ... "The fact that germ-line mutations increase with age places older parents at a higher risk of having children with autism..." said CSHL co-author of the study [Dr.] Michael Wigler. ... Wigler suggests that "what we now know about spontaneous mutations and autism offers an alternative to traditional thinking about genetic disorders as purely heritable from a parent."|website=ScienceDaily|date=July 24, 2007|accessdate=May 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prenatal conditions===
The definitions of inherited and acquired characteristics leave a [[Wiktionary:gray area|gray area]] for [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]], pre-existing and gestational maternal conditions that affect the fetus, as well as chemical and [[pathogen]] exposures and trauma that happen before and [[Birth trauma (physical)|while]] an organism is [[childbirth|born]], such as [[AIDS]], [[syphilis]], [[Hepatitis B]], [[chickenpox]], [[rubella]], unregulated [[gestational diabetes]], and [[fetal alcohol syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noah-health.org/en/pregnancy/problems/problems/disorders/index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501043359/http://www.noah-health.org/en/pregnancy/problems/problems/disorders/index.html |date=May 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most infections won't affect a fetus if the pregnant mother contracts it, but some can be transmitted to babies via the [[placenta]] or during birth, and others cause more severe symptoms in pregnant women or can cause complications to the pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.babycenter.com/0_infections-that-can-affect-pregnancy_9223.bc |title=Infections that can affect pregnancy |website=BabyCenter |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
The [[World Health Organization]] defines [[health]] as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|WHO Maternal health}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Acquired characteristics don't need to affect the health of an organism, (a scar, [[Sun tanning|suntan]], or [[Perm (hairstyle)|perm]]) but examples that do are often the first that come to mind when thinking of acquired characteristics since they are the easiest to observe and the ones that we, ourselves, are most familiar with.

=== Physical ===
Physical acquired characteristics can stem from various environmental influences such as disease, [[Body modification|modification]], injury, and regular or infrequent use of body parts.

=== Mental ===
Mental traits are acquired by learning and adapting native traits to the environment of the individual.

=== Mind-body correlation ===
Many acquired characteristics, such as injuries and diseases, directly affect only the [[Mental health|mind]] but indirectly affect the body or directly affect only the body but indirectly affect the mind.

Suppose you develop an [[Speech and language pathology in school settings#Articulation disorders|articulation disorder]] [[Component causes|after being hit]] in the head with a [[fastball]] from a [[Minor league baseball|Pro]] baseball pitcher. Once your [[concussion]] wears off, this is your ''only'' [[symptom]]. There's nothing wrong with your body, and nothing wrong with most of your mind but you [[stutter]] and [[Slur (phonology)|slur]] and mispronounce your words so that people have a very hard time understanding you.

How would such a condition affect your life if you were a child?
A child would be teased mercilessly by peers and have trouble communicating with friends and family.

A student would not be able to communicate easily with classmates ([[Collaboration|collaborative]] assignments), teachers, tutors, and certain classes (choir, public speaking).

What if you had a job where you needed to be able to talk to people? You wouldn't be able to easily talk to customers, other employees, or your boss. You couldn't answer phones or make calls, greet customers, do presentations.
You couldn't call your pet's name. You wouldn't even be able to use a [[fast food]] [[drive-through]] or tell your waitress what you wanted to order! You couldn't say, "I love you," to your child, parent, or [[significant other]].

How would you [[Coping (psychology)|cope]] with the [[functional disorder]]? With the changes and the stress those changes caused?

The example in the above link deals with the loss of a single mental function. Imagine what would happen if a part of your [[Physical fitness|body]] stopped [[functional disorder|working]]. Even something as simple as a broken [[Phalanx bone|finger]] causes many changes in lifestyle to compensate for the difference in function: writing, typing, drawing, driving, [[hobby|hobbies]] like gardening, fishing, or sports, using video game and TV controls, texting and dialing phone numbers, using [[cutlery]] to eat, opening a bag of chips or soda can, preparing food for yourself or your family, playing with your child or pet, unlocking and opening doors, bathing, brushing your teeth and hair, dressing yourself, typing your shoes, and more.

The person unable to pronounce words clearly would suffer additional stress, [[anxiety]], [[frustration]], and emotional upset from his functional limitation. There would be anxiety over financial hardships like bills from medical [[Physical examination|exams]] and [[Medical test|tests]], and a possible [[leave of absence]] or [[Involuntary termination|termination]] from work.
Physical effects of your articulation disorder could be paper cuts from your notepad, headaches over the stress, stubbed toes and sprained ankles from rushing to where you accidentally left you notepad, pulling a muscle from hauling a laptop around, etc. Worry could induce [[ulcer]]s.
If you have to cut back on [[Consumption (economics)|spending]], your (and your family's) nutrition could suffer. There would be less money for fine dining, going out with friends, and indulging in toys and hobbies.

Those close to you - family, friends, lovers - would be negatively affected by your limitation and your relationship with them would suffer as well.

== Origin ==
There are four main types of disease: pathogenic disease, deficiency disease, hereditary disease, and physiological disease.

=== Prenatal ===
[[Congenital disorder]]s, known more commonly as birth defects, are DEFINITION.

It is possible for an unborn child to contract [[fetal disease]]s and [[perinatal infection]]s.

[[:Category:Disorders originating in the perinatal period]]

==== Trauma ====
Suppose a pregnant woman is shot in her [[abdomen]] and the bullet hits the [[Fetus (biology)|fetus]], causing a non-[[death|fatal]] injury. Depending on the length of time between injury and birth, the baby could be born either with a still-healing wound or with a fully healed scar.
Regardless of its state of [[healing]], the gunshot wound could be considered an inherited characteristic, since the baby is born with the condition, or could be considered an acquired characteristic, since the condition did not happen as a result of genes inherited from its parents.

The gray area is that a prenatal gunshot wound obviously isn't an inherited, ''genetic'' condition but it can't be an acquired trait because it didn't happen ''after'' the baby's birth.
{{See also|Acquired disorder|:Category:Birth trauma|Prenatal and perinatal psychology}}

==== Chemical exposure ====
{{main|Prenatal exposure#Exposure to toxins}}
'''[[Hormone]]s''' are chemicals released by a cell or a gland in one part of the body that affect cells in other parts of the organism.

{{Details|topic=how hormones can affect fetal development|Prenatal testosterone transfer|Freemartin|Endocrine disruptor|s, Psychoneuroendocrinology|Prenatal hormones and sexual orientation}}

'''[[Chemical substance|Chemical]]s''' are substances with distinct molecular compositions that are produced by or used in a chemical process.

'''[[Drug]]s''' are any substance that, when absorbed into the body of a living organism, alter normal bodily function. Drugs can be legal and be used as is medically [[Pharmaceutical drug|prescribed]] by a doctor or be [[Illegal drug trade|illegal]] to buy, sell, possess, and administer. They can be naturally occurring (such as [[caffeine]] and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]) or man-made (such as [[Chlorpromazine]]). Both legal and illegal drugs can be [[Recreational drug use|misused]] and [[Substance abuse|abused]]. They have varying levels of [[Substance dependence|dependence]] and some can cause [[addiction]].

=== Disease ===
[[Disease]] is any condition that impairs the normal [[Physical fitness|physical]] or [[Mental disorder|mental]] (or both) function of an [[organism]]. (Though this definition includes [[Injury|injuries]], it will not be discussed here). Diseases can arise from [[infection]], [[environmental disease|environmental conditions]], [[accident]]s, and [[Genetic disorder|inherited diseases]].

It is not always easy to classify the source of a health problem. For instance, people can develop [[gout]], which is known to cause permanent or near permanent changes to the human body,&lt;ref&gt;{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|000353|Hypothyroidism}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of [[malnutrition|diet]], inherited [[genetic predisposition]], as a [[Complication (medicine)|secondary]] condition from other diseases, or as an unintended [[Adverse effect|side effect]] of certain medications.

[[Infectious disease]]s can be caused by [[pathogen]]s and [[microorganism]]s such as [[virus]]es, [[prion]]s, [[bacteria]], [[Parasitism|parasite]]s, and [[Fungus|fungi]].

For infectious, environmental, and genetically predisposed conditions,
[[Lifestyle disease|lifestyle]] [[Lifestyle (sociology)|choices]] such as exercise, nutrition, [[Stress (biology)|stress]] level, [[hygiene]], home and [[Occupational disease|work]] [[Environmental factor|environments]], use or abuse of [[Pharmaceutical drug|legal]] and [[Recreational drug use|illegal]] drugs, and access to [[healthcare]] (including an individual's financial ability and personal willingness to seek medical attention) especially in the early stages of an illness all combine to determine a person's '''[[risk factor]]s''' for developing a disease or condition.

{{quote|"[[North Korea]]ns are on average three inches shorter than their [[cousin]]s in the [[South Korea|South]]."
This statistic, or versions of it, have been quoted for some time. In 2010, the late [[Christopher Hitchens]] put the difference at six inches in an article in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', titled "A Nation of [[Racism|Racist]] [[Insular dwarfism|Dwarfs]]".
Martin Bloem is head of nutrition at the World Food Programme, which has been providing food [[aid]] to North Korea since [[North Korean famine|1995]]. He says poor diet in the [[Child development stages|early]] years of life leads to stunted growth. "Food and what happens in the first two years of life is actually critical for people's height later," he says.
Today, according to the World Food Programme, "one in every three children [in North Korea] remains chronically malnourished or 'stunted', meaning they are too short for their age".|Knight, Richard. 4-22-2012.

=== Injury ===
[[Trauma (medicine)|Trauma]] is "a body wound or shock produced by sudden physical injury, as from violence or accident,"&lt;ref name=Dictionary&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Trauma|encyclopedia=Dictionary.com|year=2010|publisher=Dictionary.com, LLC|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/trauma|accessdate=2010-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, more simply put, is "a physical wound or injury, such as a fracture or blow."&lt;ref name=conmed&gt;{{cite dictionary|title=Concise Medical Dictionary|edition=Eighth|editor=Elizabeth Martin|year=2010|publisher=Market House Books Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Accident]]al injuries, most of which can be predicted and thus prevented, are the unintentional negative outcomes of unforeseen or unplanned events or circumstances which may have been avoided or prevented if reasonable [[Injury prevention|measures]] had been taken or if the [[risk]]s involving the [[Attendant circumstance|circumstance]]s leading up to the accident been recognized and acted upon (minimized).

[[Battery (crime)|Battery]] is a criminal offense involving the use of force against another that results in harmful or offensive contact.&lt;ref&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]] Garner, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Assault]] is fear/belief of impending battery.)
[[Violence]] is defined by the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] as the [[Intention (criminal law)|intentional]] use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself or others that either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, [[maldevelopment]] or deprivation.&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; World report on violence and health |publisher=Who.int |date=2002-10-03 |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|List of preventable causes of death|Risk management|Asphyxia}}

==== Head trauma ====
[[Head injury|Head trauma]] in the form of a traumatic brain injury, [[stroke]], drug or alcohol abuse, and infection have been known in some cases to cause changes to a person's mental processes, the most common being [[amnesia]], ability to deal with stress and changes in aggression.  There have also been documented cases of a person's [[personality]] changing more drastically, the best-known case being [[Phineas Gage]], who in 1848 who survived a 1.1 meter long tamping iron being driven through his skull (though almost all presentations of Gage's subsequent personality changes are grossly exaggerated).

There is also the rare condition called [[Foreign Accent Syndrome]] in which someone who has suffered a brain injury will appear to speak in a new language or [[dialect]].  This is typically thought to be due to an injury to the linguistic center of the brain causing speech impairment that just happens to sound like a persons non-native language.  This is thought to be the reasoning behind the [[urban legend]] where someone wakes from a coma or surgery and suddenly speaks a new language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2011/06/01/136824428/a-curious-case-of-foreign-accent-syndrome |title=A Curious Case Of Foreign Accent Syndrome : Shots - Health News |publisher=NPR |date=2011-06-01 |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Dementia pugilistica}}

==== Body modification ====
[[Body modification]] is the deliberate altering of the human body for any non-medical reason, such as aesthetics, sexual enhancement, a [[rite of passage]], religious [[ritual|reasons]], to display group membership or affiliation, to create [[body art]], shock value, or self-expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essortment.com/all/whatisbodymod_pdv.htm |title=What Is Body Modification? |publisher=Essortment.com |date=1986-05-16 |accessdate=2015-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128093431/http://www.essortment.com/all/whatisbodymod_pdv.htm |archivedate=2016-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wiktionary:frequency|frequency]] of occurrence depends on the location, [[Wiktionary:extent|extent]], and number of modifications, and, perhaps most importantly, on the mind of each individual being asked to accept the modifications on another.

{{further2|[[Social acceptance]]|[[Peer pressure]]|[[Toleration]]|[[Controversial#Psychological bases of controversy|Controversy]]|[[Taboo]]}}

The change can be extreme but still be [[Social acceptance|accepted]] or at least [[toleration|tolerated]] by the majority ([[Cosmetic surgery|cosmetic]] surgery), or be extreme and opposed by most people ([[neck ring]]s). [[Ear piercing]] is a minor aesthetic alteration that is widely accepted (on females' ears). The [[Controversial#Psychological bases of controversy|acceptance]] of highly diverse [[tattoo]]s and [[body piercing]]s depends on location, size, and number and, perhaps most importantly, on the mind of each individual being asked to accept it.

Also known as maiming, [[mutilation]] is any form of physical [[injury]] aimed at [[Wiktionary:degrade|degrading]] the bodily appearance or function of a living organism's body. Examples, include [[amputation]], [[foot binding]], and [[genital modification and mutilation|genital cutting]].
The reasons for these changes can be [[rite of passage]],

Like other acquired characteristics, body modification results in permanent physiological changes that cannot be passed on to offspring genetically alone.

=== Use and disuse of body parts ===
Constant physical exercise such as swimming, running, and weight lifting can cause muscles to develop. However, muscles and other body parts can also waste away through [[atrophy]] due to disuse of said body parts. Both of these phenomena occur most of the time due to the living style of the organism and their effects on the physiology of the organism constitute of acquired characteristics such as either stronger muscles or disintegrated tissue.

Many repetitive activities (sports, [[manual labor]], [[Horse teeth#Typical wear patterns|chewing]]) create wear patterns and leave impressions on the [[bone]]s and [[fascia]] that are highly [[Forensic anthropology|specialized]] (sometimes even unique) to the activity. Over a lifetime, even such simple activities as [[Neutral spine|posture]] and [[Gait (human)|gait]] leave telltale impressions on our bodies.

'''Anthrozoology''' (also known as '''human–non-human-animal studies''', or''' HAS''') is the subset of [[ethnobiology]] that deals with interactions between humans and other animals. It is an [[interdisciplinary]] field that overlaps with other disciplines including [[anthropology]], [[ethnology]], [[medicine]], [[psychology]], [[veterinary medicine]] and [[zoology]]. A major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human-animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Daniel S. [https://books.google.com/books?id=vrueZDfPUzoC&amp;pg=PA28 "Anthrozoology"], ''The Encyclopedia of Applied Animal Behaviour and Welfare''. CABI 2010, pp. 28–30.&lt;/ref&gt; It includes scholars from fields such as anthropology, sociology, biology, history and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;DeMello, Margo. ''Teaching the Animal: Human–Animal Studies Across the Disciplines''. Lantern Books, 2010, p. xi. and Hurn, Samantha. ''Humans and Other Animals''. Pluto Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animalsandsociety.org/content/index.php?pid=41 Animals &amp; Society Institute.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625044717/http://www.animalsandsociety.org/content/index.php?pid=41 |date=June 25, 2013 }} Accessed February 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: the term should not be confused with "animal studies," which often refers to [[animal testing]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthrozoology scholars, such as [[Pauleen Bennett]] recognize the lack of scholarly attention given to non-human animals in the past, and to the relationships between human and non-human animals, especially in the light of the magnitude of animal representations, symbols, stories and their actual physical presence in human societies. Rather than a unified approach, the field currently consists of several methods adapted from the several participating disciplines to encompass human-nonhuman animal relationships and occasional efforts to develop ''[[sui generis]]'' methods.

== Growth of the field ==
There are currently 23 college programs in HAS or a related field in the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Germany, Israel and the Netherlands, as well as an additional eight veterinary school programs in North America, and over thirty HAS organizations in the US, Canada, Great Britain, Australia, France, Germany, New Zealand, Israel, Sweden, and Switzerland.

In the UK, the University of Exeter runs an MA in Anthrozoology which explores human-animal interactions from anthropological (cross-cultural) perspectives. Human animal interactions (HAI) involving companion animals are also studied by the [[Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition]], which partners with the US [[National Institutes of Health]] to research HAI in relation to child development and aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Processes in Social &amp; Affective Development: Human-Animal Interaction (HAI) Research|url=https://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/org/der/branches/cdbb/programs/psad/HAI|website=Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)|accessdate=7 April 2018|date=December 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are now three primary lists for HAS scholars and students—H-Animal, the Human-Animal Studies listserv, and NILAS, as well as the Critical Animal Studies list.

There are now over a dozen journals covering HAS issues, many of them founded in the last decade, and hundreds of HAS books, most of them published in the last decade (see for example, ''Humanimalia''). Brill, Berg, Johns Hopkins, Purdue, Columbia, Reaktion, Palgrave-McMillan, University of Minnesota, University of Illinois, and Oxford all offer either a HAS series or a large number of HAS books.

In addition, in 2006, Animals and Society Institute (ASI) began hosting the Human-Animal Studies Fellowship, a six-week program in which pre- and post-doctoral scholars work on a HAS research project at a university under the guidance of host scholars and distance peer scholars. Beginning in 2011, ASI has partnered with Wesleyan Animal Studies, who will be hosting the fellowship in conjunction with ASI. There are also a handful of HAS conferences per year, including those organized by ISAZ and NILAS, and the Minding Animals conference, held in 2009 in Australia. Finally, there are more HAS courses being taught now than ever before. The ASI website lists over 300 courses (primarily in North America, but also including Great Britain, New Zealand, Australia, Germany, and Poland) in twenty-nine disciplines at over 200 colleges and universities, not including over 100 law school courses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1856">The '''Associated Colleges of the Twin Cities''' ('''ACTC''') is a consortium of private [[liberal arts college]]s in the [[Twin Cities]] ([[Minneapolis–Saint Paul]]) of [[Minnesota]] dedicated to providing cooperative programs, services, and opportunities for their respective students, faculty, staff, and administrators. The ACTC is located in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]]. The five members of the ACTC are:
*[[Augsburg University]]
*[[Hamline University]]
*[[Macalester College]]
*[[St. Catherine University]]
*[[University of St. Thomas (Minnesota)|University of St. Thomas]]

The ACTC was officially incorporated in 1975 in order to share and enrich academic offerings for the students of the five institutions. The consortium continues to promote student exchange between its member campuses and to develop and share academic programs. The opportunity for cross-registration makes possible a range and depth of course offerings and majors unavailable at any single institution.

According to the ACTC's official website (see link below), "this partnership combines the benefits of our campuses' small, liberal arts atmospheres with the diverse opportunities of a large university. Students enrolled at one institution are able to experience the strengths and benefits of each school."

Central Soil Salinity Research Institute (CSSRI) had its origin in [[Hisar (city)|Hisar]], [[Haryana]], on 1 March 1969, as per recommendations of an Indo-American team, employed to assist the [[Indian Council of Agricultural Research]] in developing a comprehensive [[water management]] program for India.  However, by October, 1969, the Institute was shifted to its present premises in Karnal and a year later, the ''Central Rice Research Station'', [[Canning Town]], West Bengal was merged with CSSRI.

The institute has a satellite unit in Bharuch, which was originally started in Anand in 1989, but moved to [[Bharuch]] in 2003 and hosts the coordinating unit of AICRP on ''Management of Salt Affected Soils and Use of Saline Water in Agriculture'' with a network of eight research centres located in different agro ecological regions of the country at [[Agra]], Bapatala, [[Bikaner]], [[Gangawati]], [[Hisar (city)|Hisar]], [[Indore]], [[Kanpur]] and [[Tiruchirapalli]]. The coordinating unit of AICRP on Water Management was a part of CSSRI from early seventies till 1990 when it was moved to [[Rahuri]] in Maharashtra.

The main achievements of CSSRI may be listed as:
* Reclamation of [[alkaline]] soils with the addition of chemical amendments.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Central Soil Salinity Research Institute — 1.

* Reclamation of [[Saline soil|saline]] soils through subsurface drainage.
* Development and release of salt tolerant crop varieties of [[rice]], [[wheat]] and [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
* Reclamation of salt affected soils through salt tolerant trees.
* Development of for the salt affected areas of [[vertisols]] and coastal regions. The Institute has reclaimed nearly 1.5 million hectares of salt affected land for productive use, producing approximately 15 million tons of food grains annually.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
* Development of subsurface drainage technology for waterlogged saline soils. Reclamation has been completed on approximately 50,000 hectares of land in Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
* Replenishment of depleting [[water table]]s by artificial [[ground water]] recharge.

CSSRI manages an International Training Centre under an Indo-Dutch collaboration since 2001. It offers post graduate level programs in association with State Agricultural Universities (SAUs), [[Indian Institute of Technology]] (IIT) and other Universities.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The Institute has undertaken several national and international projects.

[[File:Chain_of_trust.svg|lang=en|thumb|400px|The roles of root certificate, intermediate certificate and end-entity certificate as in the chain of trust.]]
In computer security, a '''chain of trust''' is established by validating each component of [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[software]] from the end entity up to the root certificate.  It is intended to ensure that only trusted software and hardware can be used while still retaining flexibility.

==Introduction==
A chain of trust is designed to allow multiple users to create and use software on the system, which would be more difficult if all the keys were stored directly in hardware. It starts with hardware that will only boot from software that is [[Digital signature|digitally signed]].  The signing authority will only sign boot programs that enforce security, such as only running programs that are themselves signed, or only allowing signed code to have access to certain features of the machine. This process may continue for several layers.

This process results in a chain of trust. The final software can be trusted to have certain properties, because if it had been illegally modified its signature would be invalid, and the previous software would not have executed it. The previous software can be trusted, because it, in turn, would not have been loaded if its signature had been invalid. The trustworthiness of each layer is guaranteed by the one before, back to the [[trust anchor]].

It would be possible to have the hardware check the suitability (signature) for every single piece of software. However, this would not produce the flexibility that a "chain" provides. In a chain, any given link can be replaced with a different version to provide different properties, without having to go all the way back to the trust anchor. This use of multiple layers is an application of a general technique to improve scalability, and is analogous to the use of multiple certificates in a [[Root certificate|certificate chain]].

==Computer security==
In computer security, digital certificates are verified using a chain of trust. The trust anchor for the digital certificate is the root [[certificate authority]] (CA).

The certificate hierarchy is a structure of certificates that allows individuals to verify the validity of a certificate's issuer. Certificates are issued and signed by certificates that reside higher in the certificate hierarchy, so the validity and trustworthiness of a given certificate is determined by the corresponding validity of the certificate that signed it.

The chain of trust of a certificate chain is an ordered list of certificates, containing an end-user subscriber certificate and [[intermediate certificate authority|intermediate certificates]] (that represents the intermediate CA), that enables the receiver to verify that the sender and all intermediate certificates are trustworthy. This process is best described in the page ''[[Intermediate certificate authority]]''. See also [[X.509#Certificate chains and cross-certification|X.509 certificate chains]] for a description of these concepts in a widely used standard for digital certificates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5779">In [[astrophysics]] the '''chirp mass''' of a compact binary system determines the [[leading-order]] orbital evolution of the system as a result of energy loss from emitting [[gravitational waves]]. Because the gravitational wave frequency is determined by orbital frequency, the chirp mass also determines the frequency evolution of the gravitational wave signal emitted during a binary's [[Orbital decay|inspiral]] phase. In [[gravitational-wave astronomy|gravitational wave data analysis]] it is easier to measure the chirp mass than the two component masses alone.

==Definition from component masses==

A two-body system with component masses &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_2&lt;/math&gt; has a chirp mass of

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}=\frac{(m_1 m_2)^{3/5}}{(m_1+m_2)^{1/5}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="cf1994"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Gravitational waves from merging compact binaries: How accurately can one extract the binary's parameters from the inspiral waveform? |first1=Curt |last1=Cutler |first2=Éanna E. |last2=Flanagan |journal=Physical Review D |volume=49 |issue=6 |pages=2658–2697 |year=1994 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.49.2658 |arxiv=gr-qc/9402014 |bibcode=1994PhRvD..49.2658C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=L.

The chirp mass may also be expressed in terms of other common mass parameters:	

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M} = \mu^{3/5} M^{2/5} &lt;/math&gt;	
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M} = \left( \frac{q}{(1+q)^2} \right)^{3/5} M &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M} = \eta^{3/5} M &lt;/math&gt;
	
where &lt;math&gt;M = m_1 + m_2&lt;/math&gt; is the total mass of the system, &lt;math&gt;\mu = \frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[reduced mass]] of the system, &lt;math&gt;q = m_1/m_2&lt;/math&gt; is the mass ratio, and &lt;math&gt;\eta = \frac{m_1 m_2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2}&lt;/math&gt; is the symmetric mass ratio.

==Orbital evolution==

In [[general relativity]], the phase evolution of a [[Two-body problem in general relativity|binary orbit]] can be computed using a [[post-Newtonian expansion]], a perturbative expansion in powers of the orbital velocity &lt;math&gt;v/c&lt;/math&gt;.  The first order gravitational wave frequency, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, evolution is described by the [[differential equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}t}=\frac{96}{5}\pi^{8/3}\left(\frac{G\mathcal{M}}{c^{3}}\right)^{5/3}f^{11/3}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name="cf1994"/&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; are the [[speed of light]] and [[gravitational constant|Newton's gravitational constant]], respectively.

If one is able to measure both the frequency &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and frequency derivative &lt;math&gt;\dot{f}&lt;/math&gt; of a gravitational wave signal, the chirp mass can be determined.&lt;ref name="a+2018"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Properties of the Binary Black Hole Merger GW150914 |first1=B.

To disentangle the individual component masses in the system one must additionally measure higher order terms in the post-Newtonian expansion.&lt;ref name="cf1994"/&gt;

'''Codevelopment''' is a trend of thought and a development strategy in [[development studies]]
which considers [[Immigration|migrants]] to be a developing factor for their countries of origin.

Although it is widely accepted that it was [[France|French]] scholar [[Sami Naïr]] who first coined the word codevelopment, it is believed this phenomenon has existed alongside migrations since they exist. Traditionally, immigrants (especially those who migrate for economic reasons) have, collectively or individually, supported their communities of origin.

In 1997 Sami Naïr, while directing the Interministerial Mission on Migration/Codevelopment, defined this last concept as ''a proposal for integrating immigration and development in a way that migration fluxes will benefit both the country of origin and the country of destination. This is, a consensual relationship between two countries that will allow migration to the country of destiny not to imply an equivalent loss in the country of origin''.

Adherents to this model believe that it fosters mutual collaboration among countries in a way that traditional and hierarchical north-south development focus did not.
In this context, immigrant initiatives enrich the countries of origin both from a cultural and a [[human resources]] perspective. Their condition as transnational citizens would allow them a better understanding of the needs of both the communities of origin and destination.
For this reason, their participation in projects involving members of their communities, in both “their” countries would be more effective, as priorities and needs would be correctly identified.
On the other hand, this participation would also work as an integrating force in the destination countries, as they would be perceived as an enriching factor by the public opinion and institutions.

== Codevelopment and migration control ==

In countries receiving immigration, codevelopment has been implemented by the institutions in a different way. Since they were first implemented in France, codevelopment initiatives in Europe have been frequently linked to control of the migration fluxes, often promoting the return of immigrants.

At a European level, codevelopment was first mentioned during the [[Tampere Summit]] held in October 1999, when the [[European Council]] defined 5 guidelines for the new European migration policy aimed at a common space of ''"Liberty, Security and Justice".''
Anyhow, critics consider that Tampere quickly shifted towards a [[Fortress Europe]] mentality, limiting [[development aid]] to those countries willing to implement migration control measures and accepting repatriations.

An example of this tendency may be found in the imbalance between de 23 million euro budget that the [[European Union|EU]] plans on investing in the [[Schengen Information System]] and the [[Visa Information System]] (aimed at a further immigrant identification and control) with the 3 million euro budget (4 million in its second year) granted to codevelopment projects.

== Codevelopment in Spain ==

Since the late nineties, codevelopment has been the subject of postgraduate studies, specialist courses, discussions and forums among multiple stakeholders, as well as calls for project grants by some local and regional administrations, beginning with the Municipality of Madrid.  These authorities quickly became aware of the local impact of the presence of new immigrant communities, the importance of the links that bind them with their communities of origin, and the desirability of relating them in any future action to support the policies of cooperation. Codevelopment policies had a much stronger presence and development in the regional and local levels.

At the state level, in accordance with Tampere Summit on Migration, the GRECO Plan on migration management (Programa Global de Regulación y Coordinación de la Extranjería y la Inmigración 2000-2004), was launched by the Interior Ministry in 2001. This Plan devoted an important space for “joint development”, in line with the policies of Tampere and the French government. GRECO insisted on technical and educational cooperation, the voluntary return of migrants, the channelling of migrants’ remittances to development projects, and finally, on the cooperation with those governments that were ready to accept the returned illegal migrants, as well as to control the exit of their citizens with destination Spain. However, codevelopment was not even mentioned as a policy line in the Immigration law passed in 2000, and did not receive proper funding within the GRECO’s framework.

Since ending 2004, codevelopment policies have been open to discussion, including the contents, limits, and plans. Two state agencies claimed their space in codevelopment actions: the State Secretary for International Cooperation, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the brand new General Directorate of Immigrants’ Integration, at the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.

===Codevelopment policy ===

During 2005 there has been progress in the search for a consensus on competences and actors. A codevelopment line was mainstreamed in the Master Plans on Development Cooperation, and two years later, also in the new Integration Plan, called Strategic Plan on Citizenship and Integration 2007-2010, which was finally implemented in 2007, by the Ministry of Labour and Migration.

Regional and local authorities soon adopted this win/win approach and consequently launched several codevelopment guidelines within their Integration Plans and Development Cooperation Strategies. Ending 2009, most of the Spanish Regions (Comunidades Autónomas) had considered codevelopment and had set up budget lines both for migrants' associations and Development NGOs. Graciela Malgesini argues that codevelopment and migrants' remittances partly redirect the decentralized cooperation funds to their countries of origin.

===Current definitions of codevelopment ===

In the last ten years, academic research on codevelopment increased, as a result of the strong immigration process experienced by the Spanish society from 2000 onwards (which represented nearly 80% of Spain’s demographic growth). Many universities decided to open up new learning courses on the matter, following the steps of the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid. Several doctoral thesis are currently being carried out, focusing diverse aspects of codevelopment, including the impact of migration and remittances in the sending countries, mainly Ecuador, Colombia and Morocco. Migrants living in Spain remitted nearly €10 billion, in 2007 (while the overall Spanish OAD summed only half of this amount).

According to Graciela Malgesini, spontaneous codevelopment could be defined as the win/win effect, the linkage between migration and development, which generates mostly positive impacts on both the society of origin of immigrants, and the host society. This definition presumes the role of immigrants as actors and vectors of development, in "both sides", and the understanding of the relations between host countries (North) and sending countries (South) in a horizontal way. Codevelopment is directly related to Transnationalism.

Carlos Gimenez pinpointed other two characteristics of codevelopment: (1) The multiplicity of stakeholders (a network of participants that surpasses both quantitatively and qualitatively the traditional agents in the traditional development cooperation projects, as it includes authorities, social organizations, trade unions, universities, training institutes, businesses and immigrant associations). (2) Transnational citizenship (immigrants acting in codevelopment activities, embedded in a transnational dynamic, are also transnational citizens, to the extent that they have a dual presence. This dual space of belonging, in turn, encourages decision making, influences on the economic, political and social development, and allows the formation of a separate identity, based on two geographical areas, the country of origin and the country of destination).

===Codevelopment in practice ===

Transnationalism and codevelopment are spreading.In Latin America, covedelopment is a relatively new idea, but it has been embraced by grassroots organizations. For example, on November 25, 2010, FAMIGRANTES—the Federation of associations gathering migrants' family members in South America—gathered in their 4th Meeting on Migration and Codevelopment, in Rosario, Argentina. They stated that the codevelopment approach was the best way of understanding the contribution that their relatives were making both in the reception countries and in their homelands (www.famigrantes.org and www.famisur.org). At the same time, more than 100 migrants' associations launched FEDACOD (Federation of Associations for Codevelopment) in Valencia, Spain, on September 24, 2010 (www.fedacod.com).

{{cosmology}}
A '''cyclic model''' (or '''oscillating model''') is any of several [[cosmological model]]s in which the [[universe]] follows infinite, or indefinite, self-sustaining cycles. For example, the oscillating universe theory briefly considered by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1930 theorized a universe following an [[eternity|eternal]] series of oscillations, each beginning with a [[big bang]] and ending with a [[big crunch]]; in the interim, the universe would [[metric expansion of space|expand]] for a period of time before the gravitational attraction of matter causes it to collapse back in and undergo a [[Big Bounce|bounce]].

==Overview==
In the 1920s, theoretical physicists, most notably [[Albert Einstein]], considered the possibility of a cyclic model for the universe as an (everlasting) alternative to the model of an [[metric expansion of space|expanding universe]]. However, work by [[Richard C. Tolman]] in 1934 showed that these early attempts failed because of the cyclic problem: according to the [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]], entropy can only increase.&lt;ref name="Tolman 1934"&gt;

 |lccn=34032023
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that successive cycles grow longer and larger. Extrapolating back in time, cycles before the present one become shorter and smaller culminating again in a Big Bang and thus not replacing it. This puzzling situation remained for many decades until the early 21st century when the recently discovered [[dark energy]] component provided new hope for a consistent cyclic cosmology.&lt;ref name="Frampton 2006"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, a five-year survey of 200,000 galaxies and spanning 7 billion years of cosmic time confirmed that "dark energy is driving our universe apart at accelerating speeds."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/05/110519113152.htm Dark Energy Is Driving Universe Apart: NASA's Galaxy Evolution Explorer Finds Dark Energy Repulsive]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/0911/0911.5347v4.pdf The WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey: Direct constraints on blue galaxy intrinsic alignments at intermediate redshifts]&lt;/ref&gt;

One new cyclic model is  [[brane cosmology]] model of the [[Big Bang|creation of the universe]], derived from the earlier [[ekpyrotic]] model. It was proposed in 2001 by [[Paul Steinhardt]] of [[Princeton University]] and [[Neil Turok]] of [[Cambridge University]]. The theory describes a universe exploding into existence not just once, but repeatedly over time.&lt;ref name="Steinhardt, Turok 2001a"&gt;

A different cyclic model relying on the notion of [[phantom energy]] was proposed in 2007 by Lauris Baum and [[Paul Frampton]] of the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].&lt;ref name="Baum, Frampton 2007"&gt;

Other cyclic models include [[Conformal cyclic cosmology]] and [[Loop quantum cosmology]].

==The Steinhardt&amp;ndash;Turok model==
In this cyclic model, two parallel [[orbifold]] planes or [[Membrane (M-Theory)|M-branes]] collide periodically in a higher-dimensional space.&lt;ref name="Paul J. Steinhardt, Neil Turok 2004"&gt;

|bibcode = 2005NewAR..49...43S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The visible four-dimensional universe lies on one of these [[branes]]. The collisions correspond to a reversal from contraction to expansion, or a [[big crunch]] followed immediately by a [[big bang]]. The matter and radiation we see today were generated during the most recent collision in a pattern dictated by [[quantum fluctuation]]s created before the branes. After billions of years the universe reached the state we observe today; after additional billions of years it will ultimately begin to contract again. [[Dark energy]] corresponds to a force between the branes, and serves the crucial role of solving the [[monopole problem|monopole]], [[horizon problem|horizon]], and [[flatness problem|flatness]] problems. Moreover, the cycles can continue indefinitely into the past and the future, and the solution is an [[attractor]], so it can provide a complete history of the universe.

As [[Richard C. Tolman]] showed, the earlier cyclic model failed because the universe would undergo inevitable [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] [[heat death of the universe|heat death]].&lt;ref name="Tolman 1934" /&gt; However, the newer cyclic model evades this by having a net expansion each cycle, preventing [[entropy]] from building up. However, there remain major open issues in the model. Foremost among them is that colliding [[Membrane (M-Theory)|branes]] are not understood by string theorists, and nobody knows if the [[scale invariance|scale invariant]] spectrum will be destroyed by the big crunch. Moreover, as with [[cosmic inflation]], while the general character of the forces (in the [[ekpyrotic]] scenario, a force between branes) required to create the [[quantum fluctuation|vacuum fluctuation]]s is known, there is no candidate from [[particle physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It assumes '''w''' &lt; −1 (a condition called [[phantom energy]]) throughout a cycle, including at present. (By contrast, Steinhardt–Turok assume '''w''' is never less than −1.) In the Baum–Frampton model, a septillionth (or less) &lt;!-- Use 10&lt;sup&gt;−X&lt;/sup&gt; notation please--&gt; of a second (i.e. 10&lt;sup&gt;−24&lt;/sup&gt; seconds or less) before the would-be [[Big Rip]], a turnaround occurs and only one causal patch is retained as our universe. The generic patch contains no [[quark]], [[lepton]] or [[force carrier]]; only [[dark energy]] – and its entropy thereby vanishes. The [[adiabatic process]] of contraction of this much smaller universe takes place with constant vanishing entropy and with no matter including no [[black holes]] which disintegrated before turnaround.

The idea that the universe "comes back empty" is a central new idea of this cyclic model, and avoids many difficulties confronting matter in a contracting phase such as excessive [[structure formation]], proliferation and expansion of [[black holes]], as well as going through [[phase transition]]s such as those of QCD and electroweak symmetry restoration. Any of these would tend strongly to produce an unwanted premature bounce, simply to avoid violation of the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. The surprising '''w''' &lt; −1 condition may be logically inevitable in a truly infinitely cyclic cosmology because of the entropy problem. Nevertheless, many technical back up calculations are necessary to confirm consistency of the approach. Although the model borrows ideas from [[string theory]], it is not necessarily committed to strings, or to [[higher dimensions]], yet such speculative devices may provide the most expeditious methods to investigate the [[internal consistency]]. The value of '''w''' in the Baum–Frampton model can be made arbitrarily close to, but must be less than, −1.

== Other cyclic models ==
* [[Conformal cyclic cosmology]]—a general relativity based theory due to [[Roger Penrose]] in which the universe expands until all the matter decays and is turned to light—so there is nothing in the universe that has any time or distance scale associated with it. This permits it to become identical with the Big Bang, so starting the next cycle.
* [[Loop quantum cosmology]] which predicts a "quantum bridge" between contracting and expanding cosmological branches.

'''David Vaughan Icke'''  ({{IPAc-en|aɪ|k}}; born 29 April 1952) is an English writer and public speaker. A former [[Association football|footballer]]&lt;ref name="stuff"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stufftheydontwantyoutoknow.com/podcasts/david-icke-lizard-people.htm|title=David Icke and the Rise of the Lizard People|date=10 February 2017|work=Stuff They Don't Want You to Know|access-date=3 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sports broadcaster, Icke has been known since the 1990s as a professional [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorist]].&lt;ref&gt;For "professional conspiracy theorist", Michael Barkun, ''Chasing Phantoms: Reality, Imagination, and Homeland Security Since 9/11'', Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2011, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XAMYE8OLzu0C&amp;pg=PA72 72].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the quote, David Icke, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110619122640/http://davidickebooks.co.uk/index.php?act=viewDoc&amp;docId=1 "Biography 1"], davidickebooks.co.uk, accessed 8 June 2011 ([https://www.webcitation.org/66tnkaCvp?url=http://www.davidickebooks.co.uk/index.php?act%3DviewDoc%26docId%3D1 webcite]).&lt;/ref&gt; He is the author of over 20 books and numerous DVDs, and has lectured in over 25 countries, speaking for up to 10 hours to audiences.&lt;ref name=Lewis2010p75&gt;Tyson E. Lewis, Richard Kahn, ''Education Out of Bounds: Reimagining Cultural Studies for a Posthuman Age'', New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2010, 75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David G. Robertson, ''UFOs, Conspiracy Theories and the New Age'', London: Bloomsbury Publishing, 2016, 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Icke was a [[BBC]] television sports presenter and spokesman for the [[Green Party (UK)|Green Party]] when, he claims, a [[psychic]] told him, in 1990, that he had been placed on Earth for a purpose and would begin to receive messages from the spirit world.&lt;ref name=Barkun2003p103&gt;Michael Barkun, ''A Culture of Conspiracy: Apocalyptic Visions in Contemporary America'', Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA103 103].&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he announced that he was a "Son of the Godhead",&lt;ref name="stuff"/&gt; and that the world would soon be devastated by [[Tsunami|tidal waves]] and [[earthquakes]], a prediction he repeated on the BBC's primetime show ''[[Wogan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;David Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', London: Warner Books, 1993, 192–194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jon Ronson, ''Them: Adventures with Extremists'', London: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2001, 152–154.&lt;/ref&gt; The show changed his life, turning him from a respected household name into someone who was laughed at whenever he appeared in public.&lt;ref name="Channel 5 12 Dec 2006 00:02:20"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcQzOZmJykk "David Icke: Was He Right?"], [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]], 12 December 2006, from 00:02:20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next 11 years he wrote ''The Robots' Rebellion'' (1994), ''And the Truth Shall Set You Free'' (1995), ''The Biggest Secret'' (1999), and ''Children of the Matrix'' (2001), where he developed his worldview of [[New Age]] conspiracism.&lt;ref&gt;For the four books over seven years, Barkun 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA103 103].&lt;/ref&gt; His endorsement of the [[antisemitic]] forgery ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' in ''The Robots' Rebellion'', and in ''And the Truth Shall Set You Free'', led his publisher to refuse to publish his books, which were [[Self-publishing|self-published]] thereafter.&lt;ref name=holocaust/&gt; Icke has gone on to lecture around the world, frequently selling out venues, and his books have been translated into eleven languages.&lt;ref name=Alexander4Dec2011/&gt; 

At the heart of Icke's theories lies the idea that [[the universe]] is made up of "vibrational" energy, and consists of an [[Infinity|infinite]] number of [[Multiverse|dimensions]] that share the same space.&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Doyle17Feb2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Biggest26&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that an [[Interdimensional hypothesis|inter-dimensional]] race of [[Reptilian humanoid|reptilian]] beings called the [[Archon (Gnosticism)|Archons]] (or [[Anunnaki]]), have hijacked the [[Earth]], and that a [[Genetic engineering|genetically modified]] human/Archon [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] race of [[Shapeshifting|shape-shifting]] reptilians, also known as the "[[#reptoid|Babylonian Brotherhood]]", the [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)#Illuminati|Illuminati]], or the '[[Global elite|elite]]', manipulate global events to keep humans in a constant state of fear, so the Archons can feed off the 'negative energy' this creates.&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewis2010p82&gt;Lewis and Kahn 2010, 82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 19–25, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; He claims many prominent figures belong to the Babylonian Brotherhood, and are propelling [[Human beings|humanity]] towards an [[Orwellian]] global [[Fascism|fascist]] state, or [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]]; a [[post-truth]] era where [[freedom of speech]] is ended.&lt;ref name=Barkun2003p103/&gt;&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Neil20May2016/&gt;&lt;ref name="LEPredpilled"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Henry Widdas |title=Being 'red-pilled' by David Icke has never been so entertaining...and terrifying |url=https://www.lep.co.uk/whats-on/theatre/being-red-pilled-by-david-icke-has-never-been-so-entertaining-and-terrifying-1-9120860 |website=[[Lancashire Evening Post]] |accessdate=15 June 2018 |date=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Icke believes that the only way this 'Archontic' influence can be defeated is by humanity waking up to 'the truth', and filling their hearts with [[love]].&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt; Critics have accused Icke of being a [[Holocaust denier]] and his "reptilians" and other theories of being antisemitic, claims he denies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lizard conspiracist David Icke not wanted in Berlin|url=http://www.dw.com/en/lizard-conspiracist-david-icke-not-wanted-in-berlin/a-37693384|accessdate=26 May 2018|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Henry|last=Widdas|title=Icke: Reports of my madness have been greatly exaggerated|url=https://www.lep.co.uk/news/politics/icke-reports-of-my-madness-have-been-greatly-exaggerated-1-9253395|accessdate=9 August 2018|work=Lancashire Post|date=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
===Family and education===
The middle son of three boys born seven years apart, Icke was born in [[Leicester General Hospital]] to Beric Vaughan Icke and Barbara J. Icke, née Cooke, who were married in Leicester in 1951. Beric had wanted to be a doctor, but the family had no money, so he joined the [[Royal Air Force]] as a medical orderly.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 28–30.&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded a [[British Empire Medal]] for gallantry in 1943 after an aircraft crashed into the [[Chipping Warden]] air base in Northamptonshire. Along with a [[squadron leader]], Beric ran into the burning aircraft, without protective clothing, and saved the life of a crew member who was trapped inside.{{refn|group=n|1479714 Leading Aircraftman Beric Vaughan Icke, Royal Air Force, ''[[The London Gazette]]'', 14 May 1943:{{pb}} "One night in March, 1943, an aircraft crashed on a Royal Air Force station and immediately burst into flames. Squadron Leader Moore (the duty medical officer) saw the accident and, accompanied by [[Leading Aircraftman]] Icke, a medical orderly, proceeded to the scene. Squadron Leader Moore directed the removal of the rear gunner, who was dazed and sitting amongst the burning wreckage, to a place of safety. The aircraft was now enveloped in flames and ammunition was exploding. Nevertheless, despite the intense heat and the danger from exploding oxygen bottles this officer and airman entered the burning wreckage in an attempt to rescue another member of the crew who was pinned down. Without any protective clothing they lifted aside the burning wreckage and, with great difficulty, succeeded in extricating the injured man. Squadron Leader Moore rendered first aid to the rescued man. Squadron Leader Moore sustained burns to his chest and hands in carrying out the operation. This officer and airman both displayed courage and devotion to duty in keeping with the highest traditions of the Royal Air Force.{{pb}}"Acting Squadron Leader Frederick Thomas Moore, B.S., F.R.C.S., L.R.C.P. (23417), Reserve of Air Force Officers, was awarded the MBE for his part in this action."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080302090432/http://www.rafweb.org/BEM_Holders2.htm "1479714 Leading Aircraftman Beric Vaughan Icke, Royal Air Force"], ''The London Gazette'', 14 May 1943.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the war Beric became a clerk in the [[Gents' of Leicester|Gents]] clock factory. The family lived in a [[terraced house]] on Lead Street in the centre of [[Leicester]],&lt;ref name=Icke1993pp29,33/&gt; an area that was demolished in the mid-1950s as part of the city's [[slum clearance]].&lt;ref name=Hewitt2013p153&gt;Ned Newitt, ''The Slums of Leicester'', JMD Media Ltd, 2013, 153 (for demolition, 159–160).&lt;/ref&gt; When Icke was three, in around 1955, they moved to the Goodwood estate, one of the [[council estate]]s the [[Attlee ministry|post-war Labour government]] built. "To say we were skint," he wrote in 1993, "is like saying it is a little chilly at the North Pole."&lt;ref name=Icke1993pp29,33&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 29, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; He recalls having to hide under a window or chair when the council man came for the rent; after knocking, the rent man would walk around the house peering through windows. His mother never explained that it was about the rent; she just told Icke to hide. He wrote in 2003 that he still gets a fright when someone knocks on the door.&lt;ref name=Icke2003p2&gt;David Icke, ''Tales from the Time Loop'', Ryde: Bridge of Love Publications, 2003, 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Always a loner, he spent hours playing with toy trains, preferring to cross the street rather than speak to anyone. He attended Whitehall Infant School, then Whitehall Junior School, feeling nervous and shy to the point of feeling faint during morning assembly and having to leave before he passed out. The family doctor suggested a referral to a child psychologist, but his father disagreed.&lt;ref name=Light36&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 36, 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Icke2003p2/&gt;

Icke made no effort at school, but when he was nine, he was chosen for the junior school's third-year football team. It was the first time he had succeeded at anything, and he came to see football as his way out of poverty. He played in goal, which he wrote suited the loner in him and gave him a sense of living on the edge between hero and villain.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

After failing his [[Eleven plus exam|11-plus exam]] in 1963, he was sent to the city's Crown Hills Secondary Modern (rather than the local [[grammar school]]), where he was given a trial for the Leicester Boys Under-Fourteen team.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 44, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; He left school at 15 after being talent-spotted by [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], who signed him up in 1967 as their youth team's goalkeeper. He also played for [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]]'s reserve team and [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]], on loan from Coventry.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 54, 58 (for Oxford).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rheumatoid arthritis]] in his left knee, which spread to the right knee, ankles, elbows, wrists and hands, stopped him from making a career out of football. Despite often being in agony during training, he managed to play part-time for [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]], including in the first team when they were in the [[Football League Fourth Division|fourth]], and later in the [[Football League Third Division|third]], division of the English [[The Football League|Football League]].&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 66–69.&lt;/ref&gt; He was earning up to £33 a week.&lt;ref&gt;David Icke, ''Remember Who You Are: Remember 'Where' You Are and Where You 'Come' From'', Ryde: David Icke Books, 2012, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; But in 1973, at the age of 21, the pain in his joints became so severe that he was forced to retire.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 69–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First marriage===
Icke met his first wife, Linda Atherton, in May 1971 at a dance at the Chesford Grange Hotel near [[Leamington Spa]]; she was working as a van driver for a garage. Shortly after they met, Icke had another of the huge rows he had started having with his father—always a domineering man, his father was upset that Icke's arthritis was interfering with his football career—so he packed his bags and left home. He moved into a bedsit and worked in a travel agency, travelling to Hereford twice a week in the evenings to play football.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 61–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

He and Atherton were married on 30 September that year, four months after they met.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Their daughter was born in March 1975, followed by one son in December 1981 and another in November 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 82, 96, 253–254.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple divorced in 2001 but remained good friends, and Atherton continued to work as Icke's business manager.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 139–140, 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Journalism, sports broadcasting===

The loss of Icke's position with Hereford meant that he and his wife had to sell their home, and for several weeks they lived apart, each moving in with their parents. In 1973 Icke found a job as a reporter with the weekly ''Leicester Advertiser'', through a contact who was a sports editor at the ''[[Daily Mail]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 72, 75.&lt;/ref&gt; He moved on to the Leicester News Agency, and through it did some work for [[BBC Radio Leicester]] as its football reporter,&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 78.&lt;/ref&gt; then worked his way up through the ''Loughborough Monitor'', the ''[[Leicester Mercury]]'' and [[Free Radio Birmingham|BRMB Radio]] in Birmingham.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 79, 81, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

He worked for two months in [[Saudi Arabia]] in 1976, helping with the national football team. It was supposed to be a longer-term position, but he missed his wife and new daughter and decided not to return after his first holiday back to the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt; BRMB gave him his job back, after which he successfully applied to ''[[Midlands Today]]'' at the BBC's [[Pebble Mill Studios]] in Birmingham, a job that included on-air appearances.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 88–91.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest stories he covered there was the murder of [[Bridgewater Four|Carl Bridgewater]], the paperboy who was shot during a robbery in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981 Icke became a sports presenter for the BBC's national programme, ''[[Newsnight]]'', which had begun the previous year. Two years later, on 17 January 1983, he appeared on the first edition of the BBC's ''[[Breakfast Time]]'', British television's first national breakfast show, and presented the sports news there until 1985, which meant getting up at two o'clock in the morning five days a week. In the middle of 1983 he achieved his ambition when he co-hosted ''[[Grandstand (TV series)|Grandstand]]'', at the time the BBC's flagship national sports programme.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 93–95, 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt; He also published his first book that year, ''It's a Tough Game, Son!'', about how to break into football.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Icke and his family moved in 1982 to [[Ryde]] on the [[Isle of Wight]].&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 109.&lt;/ref&gt; His relationship with ''Grandstand'' was short lived – he wrote that a new editor arrived in 1983 who appeared not to like him – but he continued working for [[BBC Sport]] until 1990, often on [[bowls]] and [[snooker]] programmes, and at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 104.&lt;/ref&gt; He was by then a household name, but a career in television began to lose its appeal; he wrote that he found television workers insecure, shallow and sometimes vicious.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''Tales from the Time Loop'', 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1990, his contract with the BBC was terminated when he initially refused to pay the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Community Charge]] (also known as the "poll tax"), a local tax introduced that year by [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s government. He ultimately paid it, but his announcement that he was willing to go to prison rather than pay prompted the BBC, by charter an impartial public-service broadcaster, to distance itself from him.&lt;ref&gt;"Protester David Icke finally pays community charge," ''The Guardian'', 14 November 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kennedy20March1991&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Maev |authorlink=Maev Kennedy|title=Icke resigns Green Speaker and parliamentary roles |work=The Guardian |date=20 March 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Icke had begun to flirt with [[alternative medicine]] and New Age philosophies in the 1980s, in an effort to relieve his arthritis, and this encouraged his interest in Green politics. Within six months of joining the [[Green Party (UK)|Green Party]], he was given a position as one of its four [[principal speaker]]s, positions created in lieu of a single leader.&lt;ref&gt;David Icke, ''Truth Vibrations'', London: Gateway, 1991, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

His second book, ''It Doesn't Have To Be Like This'', an outline of his views on the environment, was published in 1989, and he was regularly invited to high-profile events. That year he discussed animal rights during a televised debate at the [[Royal Institution]], alongside [[Tom Regan]], [[Mary Warnock]] and [[Germaine Greer]],&lt;ref&gt;David Icke, [http://www.all-creatures.org/articles/video-flv-human.html "Does the Animal Kingdom need a Bill of Rights?"], Royal Institute of Great Britain, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1990 his name appeared on advertisements for a children's charity, along with [[Audrey Hepburn]], [[Woody Allen]] and other celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;''Weekend Guardian'', 22–23 September 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his successful media career, Icke wrote that 1989 was a time of considerable personal despair, and it was during this period that he said he began to feel a presence around him.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''Days of Decision'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt; He often describes how he felt it while alone in a hotel room in March 1990, and finally asked: "If there is anybody here, will you please contact me because you are driving me up the wall!" Days later, in a [[Newsagent's shop|newsagent's]] in Ryde, he felt a force pull his feet to the ground, he wrote, and heard a voice guide him toward some books. One of them was ''Mind to Mind'' (1989) by [[Betty Shine]], a psychic healer in [[Brighton]]. He read the book, then wrote to her requesting a consultation about his arthritis.&lt;ref&gt;David Icke, ''Phantom Self'', Ryde: David Icke Books, 2016, 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bio1&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110619122640/http://davidickebooks.co.uk/index.php?act=viewDoc&amp;docId=1 "Biography 1"], davidickebooks.co.uk, accessed 8 June 2011 ([https://www.webcitation.org/66tnkaCvp?url=http://www.davidickebooks.co.uk/index.php?act=viewDoc&amp;docId=1 archived]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2003/jan/12/features.sportmonthly "The 10 worst decisions in the history of sport"], ''The Observer'', 12 January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''The Truth Vibrations'', 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Icke visited Shine four times. During the third meeting, on 29 March 1990, Icke claims to have felt something like a spider's web on his face, and Shine told him she had a message from Wang Ye Lee of the spirit world.&lt;ref&gt;Kay 2011, 179.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David G. Robertson, "David Icke’s Reptilian Thesis and the Development of New Age Theodicy," ''International Journal for the Study of New Religions'', 4(1), 2013 (27–47), 33. {{doi|10.1558/ijsnr.v4i1.27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Icke had been sent to heal the Earth, she said, and would become famous but would face opposition. The spirit world was going to pass ideas to him, which he would speak about to others. He would write five books in three years; in 20 years a new flying machine would allow us to go wherever we wanted and time would have no meaning; and there would be earthquakes in unusual places, because the inner earth was being destabilised by having oil taken from under the seabed.&lt;ref name=bio1/&gt;&lt;ref name=bio2&gt;For the date and predictions, [http://www.davidickebooks.co.uk/index.php?act=viewDoc&amp;docId=6 "Biography 2"], davidickebooks.co.uk, accessed 12 December 2010 ([https://www.webcitation.org/66tnr47yM?url=http://www.davidickebooks.co.uk/index.php?act%3DviewDoc%26docId%3D6 archived]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Icke 2016, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1991, Icke visited a pre-[[Inca]] [[Sillustani]] burial ground near [[Puno]], [[Peru]], where he says he felt drawn to a particular circle of waist-high stones. As he stood in the circle, he had two thoughts: that people would be talking about this in 100 years, and that it would be over when it rained. His body shook as though plugged into an electrical socket, he wrote, and new ideas poured into him. Then it started raining and the experience ended. He described it as the [[Kundalini energy|kundalini]] (a term from Hindu [[yoga]]) activating his [[chakra]]s, or energy centres, triggering a [[Higher consciousness|higher level of consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''Tales from the Time Loop'', 12–13, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Barkun2003p103/&gt;

===Turquoise period===
[[File:Sillustani Archaeological Site (7640965048).jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|alt=photograph|Icke's turquoise period followed an experience by a burial site in [[Sillustani]], Peru, in 1991.]]
There followed what Icke called his "turquoise period". He had been [[Mediumship|channelling]] for some time, he wrote, and had received a message through [[automatic writing]] that he was a "Son of the Godhead", interpreting "Godhead" as the "Infinite Mind".&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 190, 208.&lt;/ref&gt; He began to wear only [[Turquoise (color)|turquoise]], often a turquoise [[shell suit]], a colour he saw as a conduit for positive energy.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jonson17March2001&gt;Jon Ronson, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/17/features.weekend "Beset by lizards (part one)"]; [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/17/features.weekend1 "Beset by lizards (part two)"], ''The Guardian'', 17 March 2001, edited extracts from Jon Ronson, ''Them: Adventures with Extremists''.&lt;/ref&gt; He also started working on his third book, and the first of his New-Age period, ''The Truth Vibrations''.

In August 1990, before his visit to Peru, Icke had met Deborah Shaw, an English psychic living in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. When he returned from Peru they began a relationship, with the apparent blessing of Icke's wife. In March 1991 Shaw began living with the couple, a short-lived arrangement that the press called the "turquoise triangle". Shaw changed her name to Mari Shawsun, while Icke's wife became Michaela, which she said was an aspect of the [[Archangel]] [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]].&lt;ref name=Taylor1997&gt;Sam Taylor, "So I was in this bar with the son of God&amp;nbsp;...," ''The Observer'', 20 April 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship with Shaw led to the birth of a daughter in December 1991, although she and Icke had stopped seeing each other by then. Icke wrote in 1993 that he decided not to visit his daughter and had seen her only once, at the request of Shaw. Icke's wife gave birth to the couple's second son in November 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 223, 254.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 134–135.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Press conference===
In March 1991, Icke resigned from the Green Party during a party conference, telling them he was about to be at the centre of "tremendous and increasing controversy", and winning a standing ovation from delegates after the announcement.&lt;ref name=Kennedy20March1991/&gt; A week later, shortly after his father died, Icke and his wife, Linda Atherton, along with their daughter and Deborah Shaw, held a press conference to announce that Icke was a son of the Godhead.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 188 for his father; 192–193 for the press conference.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 130–131.&lt;/ref&gt; He told reporters the world was going to end in 1997. It would be preceded by a hurricane around the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and [[New Orleans]], eruptions in [[Cuba]], disruption in China, a hurricane in Derry, and an earthquake on the [[Isle of Arran]].  The information was being given to them by voices and [[automatic writing]], he said. [[Los Angeles]] would become an island, [[New Zealand]] would disappear, and the cliffs of Kent would be under water by Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;John Ezard, "'Son and daughter of God' predict apocalypse is nigh," ''The Guardian'', 28 March 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Wogan'' interview===
The headlines attracted requests for interviews from [[Nicky Campbell]]'s [[BBC Radio One]] programme, for [[Terry Wogan]]'s prime-time ''[[Wogan]]'' show, and [[Fern Britton]]'s ITV chat show.&lt;ref name=Robertson2016p131&gt;Robertson 2016, 131.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Wogan'' interview, on 29 April 1991, was the most damaging.

Wogan introduced the 1991 segment with "The world as we know it is about to end". Amid laughter from the audience, Icke prevaricated when asked if he was the son of God, replying that Jesus would have been laughed at too, and repeating that Britain would soon be devastated by tidal waves and earthquakes. Without these, "the Earth will cease to exist". When Icke said laughter was the best way to remove negativity, Wogan replied of the audience: "But they're laughing ''at'' you. They're not laughing with you."&lt;ref name=Robertson2016p131/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronson 2001, 154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/only-in-britain/david-icke-terry-wogan-interview/ "The day David Icke told Terry Wogan 'I'm the son of God'"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 29 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The interview proved devastating for Icke. The BBC was criticised for allowing it to go ahead; Des Christy of ''The Guardian'' called it a "media crucifixion".&lt;ref name=Christy&gt;Des Christy, "Crucifixion, courtesy of the BBC," ''The Guardian'', 6 May 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Icke disappeared from public life for a time.&lt;ref name="Channel 5 12 Dec 2006 00:02:20"/&gt; In May 1991, police were called to the couple's home after a crowd of over 100 youths gathered outside, chanting "[[Monty Python's Life of Brian|We want the Messiah]]" and "Give us a sign, David".&lt;ref&gt;"Icke taunted," ''The Times'', 27 May 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Icke told [[Jon Ronson]] in 2001:

{{quote|
"One of my very greatest fears as a child was being ridiculed in public. And there it was coming true. As a television presenter, I'd been respected. People come up to you in the street and shake your hand and talk to you in a respectful way. And suddenly, overnight, this was transformed into "Icke's a nutter." I couldn't walk down any street in Britain without being laughed at. It was a nightmare. My children were devastated because their dad was a figure of ridicule."&lt;ref name=Jonson17March2001/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronson 2001, 173.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2006 Wogan re-interviewed Icke for a special 'Now &amp; Then' series. Wogan apologised for his conduct in the earlier 1991 interview.&lt;ref name="Robertson2"&gt;{{cite book |author1=David G. Robertson |title=UFOs, Conspiracy Theories and the New Age |date=25 February 2016 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1474253208 |pages=147 |edition=First |language=English |chapter=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing and lecturing==
===Publishing===
The ''Wogan'' interview separated Icke from his own previous life, he wrote in 2003, although he considered it the making of him in the end, giving him the courage to develop his ideas without caring what anyone thought.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''Tales from the Time Loop'', 14, 17, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; His book ''The Truth Vibrations'', inspired by his experience in Peru, was published in May 1991, and he continued to write, turning himself into a popular author and speaker.&lt;ref name=Channel52006/&gt;

Between 1992 and 1994, he wrote five books, all published by mainstream publishers, four in 1993. ''Love Changes Everything'' (1992), influenced by the "channelling" work of Deborah Shaw, is a [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] work about the origin of the planet, in which Icke writes with admiration about Jesus. ''Days of Decision'' (1993) is an 86-page summary of his interviews after the 1991 press conference; it questions the [[historicity of Jesus]] but accepts the existence of the Christ spirit. Icke's autobiography, ''In the Light of Experience'', was published the same year,&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, pp. 133–135.&lt;/ref&gt; followed by ''Heal the World: A Do-It-Yourself Guide to Personal and Planetary Transformation'' (1993).

====''The Robots' Rebellion''====
[[File:Antisemiticroths.jpg|thumb|1alt=cartoon|In his 2001 documentary about Icke, Jon Ronson cited this cartoon, "Rothschild" (1898), by [[Charles Lucien Léandre|Charles Léandre]], arguing that Jews have long been depicted as lizard-like creatures out to control the world.&lt;ref&gt;Ronson (Channel 4) 2001, 06:12 mins.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Icke's fifth book of that period, ''The Robots' Rebellion'' (1994), published by Gateway, attracted allegations that his work was [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]]. According to [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]], the book contains "all the familiar beliefs and paranoid clichés" of the US conspiracists and militia.&lt;ref name=Clarke2003p291&gt;Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, ''Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity'', New York University Press, 2003, 291.&lt;/ref&gt; It claims that a plan for world domination by a shadowy cabal, perhaps extraterrestrial, was laid out in ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' (c. 1897). 

''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'' is a notorious antisemitic [[literary forgery]], probably written under the direction of the [[Okhrana|Russian secret police]] in Paris, that purported to reveal a conspiracy by the Jewish people to achieve global domination. It was exposed as a forgery in 1920 by [[Lucien Wolf]] and the following year by [[Philip Graves]] in ''The Times''.&lt;ref name=Barkunprotocols&gt;Barkun 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA50 50], [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA145 145–146].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007058 "Protocols of the Elders of Zion"] ([https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007244 timeline]), United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; Once exposed, [[Michael Barkun]] argues, it disappeared from mainstream discourse, until interest in it was renewed by the American far right in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=Barkun49&gt;Barkun 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA50 50], [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA145 145–146].&lt;/ref&gt; Its use was spread further by conspiracy groups on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;Juliane Wetzel, "''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'' on the internet: How radical political groups are networked via antisemitic conspiracy theories," in Esther Webman (ed.), ''The Global Impact of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion: A Century-Old Myth'', New York: Routledge, 2012 (147–160), 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Barkun states that Icke's reliance on the ''Protocols'' in ''The Robots' Rebellion'' is "the first of a number of instances in which Icke moves into the dangerous terrain of anti-Semitism".&lt;ref name=Barkun2003p104/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also see Norman Simms, "Anti-Semitism: A Psychopathological Disease," in Jerry S. Piven, Chris Boyd, Henry W. Lawton (eds.),  ''Judaism and Genocide: Psychological Undercurrents of History'', Volume IV, Lincoln, NE: Writers Club Press, 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=eFFsEYvBEZgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA30 30ff].&lt;/ref&gt;

Icke took both the extraterrestrial angle and the focus on the ''Protocols'' from ''Behold a Pale Horse'' (1991) by [[Milton William Cooper]], who was associated with the American militia movement; chapter 15 of Cooper's book reproduces the ''Protocols'' in full.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Clarke2003p291/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Cooper: Ed Vulliamy, Bruce Dirks, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/1997/nov/03/mcveigh.usa "New trial may solve riddle of Oklahoma bombing"], ''The Guardian'', 3 November 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Robots' Rebellion'' refers repeatedly to the ''Protocols'', calling them the ''Illuminati protocols'', and defining ''Illuminati'' as the "Brotherhood elite at the top of the pyramid of secret societies world-wide". Icke adds that the ''Protocols'' were not the work of the Jewish people, but of [[Zionism|Zionists]].&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''The Robots' Rebellion'', London: Gateway, 1992, 114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Honigsbaum&gt;Mark Honigsbaum, [https://web.archive.org/web/19990428140350/http://www2.ca.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/orgs/british/combat-18/press/evening-standard.052695 "The Dark Side of David Icke"], ''London Evening Standard'', 26 May 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; 

''The Robots' Rebellion'' was greeted with dismay by the Green Party's executive. Despite the controversy over the press conference and the ''Wogan'' interview, they had allowed Icke to address the party's annual conference in 1992—a decision that led one of its principal speakers, [[Sara Parkin]], to resign—but after the publication of ''The Robot's Rebellion'' they moved to ban him.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/greens-bar-icke-1448269.html "Greens bar Icke"], ''The Independent'', 12 September 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vivek Chaudhary, "Greens see red at 'Son of God's anti-Semitism'," ''The Guardian'', 12 September 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Goodwin, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130602074558/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4678912.html "Icke factor could thwart Greens' serious message"], ''The Independent'', 29 September 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F.

===Self-Publishing===
{{Rquote|right|&lt;small&gt;Why do we play a part in suppressing alternative information to the official line of the [[Second World War]]? How is it right that while this fierce suppression goes on, free copies of the [[Steven Spielberg|Spielberg]] film, ''[[Schindler's List]]'', are given to schools to indoctrinate children with the unchallenged version of events. And why do we, who say we oppose tyranny and demand freedom of speech, allow people to go to prison and be vilified, and magazines to be closed down on the spot, for suggesting another version of history.&lt;/small&gt;|''And the Truth Shall Set You Free'' (1995)&lt;ref name=holocaust/&gt;}}
Icke's next manuscript, ''And the Truth Shall Set You Free'' (1995), contained a chapter questioning aspects of the Holocaust, which caused a rift with his publisher, Gateway.&lt;ref name=Honigsbaum/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Icke, [http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/biggestsecret/andtruthfreebook/truthfree07.htm "Chapter Seven: Master races"], ''And the Truth Shall Set You Free'', Ryde: Bridge of Love Publications, 1995, 127–146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=off&gt;Will Offley, [http://www.publiceye.org/Icke/Ickequotes.htm "Selected Quotes Of David Icke"], Political Research Associates, 23 February 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

After borrowing £15,000 from a friend, Icke set up Bridge of Love Publications, later called David Icke Books. He self-published ''And the Truth Shall Set You Free'', and all his work thereafter. Icke wrote in 2004 that ''And the Truth'' was one of his proudest achievements.&lt;ref name=IckeTruthintro&gt;Icke, ''And the Truth Shall Set You Free'', Introduction to 21st century edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Channel52006/&gt; 

According to Lewis and Kahn, Icke set about consolidating all conspiracy theories into one project with unlimited explanatory power. His books sold 140,000 copies between 1998 and 2011, at a value of over £2 million.&lt;ref name=Alexander4Dec2011/&gt; Thirty thousand copies of ''The Biggest Secret'' (1999) were in print months after publication, according to Icke,&lt;ref name=Barkun2003p106&gt;Barkun 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA106 106].&lt;/ref&gt; and it was reprinted six times between 1999 and 2006. His 2002 book, ''Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster'', became a long-standing top-five bestseller in South Africa.&lt;ref name=Lewis2010p75/&gt; By 2006, his website was getting 600,000 hits a week, and by 2011 his books had been translated into 11 languages.&lt;ref name=Channel52006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Alexander4Dec2011/&gt;

===Lecturing===
[[File:David Icke, 7 June 2013 (2).jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Icke speaking in June 2013]]
Icke became known, in particular, for his lengthy lectures. By 2006, he had lectured in at least 25 countries, attracting audiences of several thousand each time.&lt;ref name=Channel52006/&gt; He lectured for seven hours to 2,500 people at the [[Brixton Academy]], London, in 2008,&lt;ref name=Doyle17Feb2006/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2250650/ "David Icke: ''Beyond the Cutting Edge'' (2008)"], IMDb.&lt;/ref&gt; and the same year addressed the [[University of Oxford]]'s debating society, the [[Oxford Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Evans, [http://www.newstatesman.com/life-and-society/2008/03/icke-world-conspiracy "Interview: David Icke"], ''New Statesman'', 3 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Marre, [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/7days/story/0,,2243708,00.html "Pendennis"], ''The Observer'', 20 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Icke, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCwAcJ78a8A "David Icke Live at the Oxford Union Debating Society"], produced by Linda Atherton, Commonage, February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; His book tour for ''Human Race Get Off Your Knees: The Lion Sleeps No More'' (2010) included a sell-out talk to 2,100 in [[New York City|New York]] and £83,000 worth of ticket sales in [[Melbourne, Australia]]. In October 2012, he delivered a 10-hour lecture to 6,000 people at London's [[Wembley Arena]].&lt;ref name=Alexander4Dec2011&gt;Harriet Alexander, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/8933565/David-Icke-would-you-believe-it.html "David Icke – would you believe it?"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 4 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For London, Susie Mesure, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/david-icke-is-not-the-messiah-or-even-that-naughty-but-boy-can-he-drone-on-8229433.html "David Icke is not the Messiah. Or even that naughty. But boy, can he drone on"], ''The Independent'', 27 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second marriage, politics, television===
In 1997, Icke met his second wife, Pamela Leigh Richards, in [[Jamaica]]. He and Linda Atherton divorced in 2001,&lt;ref name=Robertson2016p139-140&gt;Robertson 2016, 139–140.&lt;/ref&gt; and he and Richards were married the same year.&lt;ref name=Channel52006/&gt; However, the couple separated in 2008 and divorced in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Icke stood for parliament in the [[Haltemprice and Howden by-election, 2008|2008 by-election]] for [[Haltemprice and Howden (UK Parliament constituency)|Haltemprice and Howden]] (an [[East Yorkshire]] constituency), on the issue of "Big Brother—The Big Picture". He came 12th out of 26 candidates, with 110 votes (0.46%), resulting in a lost [[Deposit (politics)|deposit]].&lt;ref name="Robertson2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7501046.stm "Haltemprice and Howden: Result in full"], BBC News, 11 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wainwright, Allegra Stratton and agencies, [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jul/11/haltemprice.byelections1 "Haltemprice and Howden byelection: Davis sees off Loonies and claims victory in 42-day detention battle"], ''The Guardian'', 11 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He explained that he was standing because "if we don't face this now we are going to have some serious explaining to do when we are asked by our children and grandchildren what we were doing when the global fascist state was installed. 'I was watching ''[[EastEnders]]'', dear' will not be good enough."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120213180350/http://www.votewise.co.uk/index.php?pg=show&amp;c=1076&amp;eid=MP0003-0&amp;this=1076 "David ICKE stood for the None (No Party)"], VoteWise, accessed 12 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Naughton, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4226273.ece "Reptilians beware – David Icke is back!"], ''The Times'', 27 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, Icke launched an internet television station, [[The People's Voice (internet TV station)|The People's Voice]], broadcast from London. He founded the station after crowdsourcing over £300,000 and worked for it as a volunteer until March 2014. As of that year, the station had stopped broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;Tomas Jivanda, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/david-icke-launches-internet-tv-station-the-people-s-voice-8962731.html "David Icke launches internet TV station The People's Voice"], ''The Independent'', 25 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thepeoplesvoice.tv/ ''The People's Voice 2.0''] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160518144619/http%3A//thepeoplesvoice.tv/ |date=18 May 2016 }}, thepeoplesvoice.tv.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/user/TheTPVchannel ''The People's Voice''], YouTube.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key ideas==
===Overview===
Icke combines New Age philosophical discussion about the universe and consciousness with conspiracy theories about public figures being reptilian humanoids and [[paedophilia|paedophiles]]. He argues in favour of [[reincarnation]]; a collective consciousness that has [[intentionality]]; [[modal realism]] (that other possible worlds exist alongside ours); and the [[Law of attraction (New Thought)|law of attraction]] (that good and bad thoughts can attract experiences).&lt;ref&gt;For law of attraction, Icke, ''Children of the Matrix'', 291ff, and ''The Biggest Secret'', 30–40. For other possible worlds, Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt;

In ''The Biggest Secret'' (1999), he introduced the idea that many prominent figures derive from the [[Anunnaki]], a reptilian race from the [[Draco (constellation)|Draco constellation]].&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 5–9.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Human Race Get Off Your Knees: The Lion Sleeps No More'' (2012), he identified the [[Moon]] (and later [[Saturn]]) as the source of [[holographic]] experiences, broadcast by the reptiles, that humanity interprets as reality.&lt;ref name=Icke2012/&gt;&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt; David Icke also thinks that [[global warming|climate change]] is a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2016/dec/06/more-terrifying-than-trump-the-booming-conspiracy-culture-of-climate-science-denial|title=More terrifying than Trump? The booming conspiracy culture of climate science denial|year=2016|newspaper=The Guardian|last1=Readfearn|first1=Graham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infinite dimensions===
Icke believes that the universe is made up of "vibrational" energy, and consists of an infinite number of dimensions that share the same space, just like television and radio frequencies, and that some people can tune their consciousness to other wavelengths.&lt;ref name=Biggest26&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WardNH"&gt;{{cite web |author1=James Ward |title=Mocked prophet: what is David Icke's appeal? |url=https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/4797/mocked-prophet-what-is-david-ickes-appeal |website=New Humanist |accessdate=15 June 2018 |date=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated in an interview with [[The Guardian]] that:

{{cquote|
Our five senses can access only a tiny frequency range, like a radio tuned to one station. In the space you are occupying now are all the radio and television stations broadcasting to your area. You can't see them and they can't see each other because they are on different wavelengths. But move your radio dial and suddenly there they are, one after the other. It is the same with the reality we experience here as 'life'. What we call the 'world' and the 'universe' is only one frequency range in an infinite number sharing the same space.&lt;ref name=Doyle17Feb2006/&gt;
}}

Icke believes that time is an illusion; there is no past, or future, and only the "infinite now" is real, and that humans are an aspect of consciousness, or infinite awareness, which he describes as "all that there is, has been, and ever can be".&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt;

===Reptoid hypothesis{{anchor|reptoid}}===
{{further|New World Order (conspiracy theory)}}
[[File:Draco Hevelius.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|alt=drawing|The [[Draco (constellation)|Draco constellation]] from ''Firmamentum Sobiescianum sive Uranographia'' (1690)  by [[Johannes Hevelius]]. Icke's "reptoid hypothesis" posits that humanity is ruled by descendants of reptilians from Draco.&lt;ref&gt;Barkun 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA105 105].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Icke proposes that an inter-dimensional race of reptilian beings called the [[Archon (Gnosticism)|Archons]], have hijacked the earth, and are stopping humanity from realising its true potential.&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt; He claims they are the same beings as; the [[Anunnaki]] [[deities]] from the [[Babylonia]]n creation myth, the ''[[Enûma Eliš]]'', and the fallen angels, or [[Watcher (angel)|Watchers]], who mated with human women in the [[Biblical apocrypha]].&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 19–25, 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Archons--&gt; Icke believes that a genetically modified human/Archon hybrid race of shape-shifting reptilians, known as the "Babylonian Brotherhood", or the [[Illuminati]], manipulate global events to keep humans in a constant state of fear, so the Archons can feed off the 'negative energy' this creates.&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 52ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Biggest Secret'' (1999), Icke identified the Brotherhood as descendants of reptilians from the constellation [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]], and said that they live in caverns inside the earth.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 140ff.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Icke said in an interview:

&lt;blockquote style="background:none; margin-right:5em; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 3px #ccc; padding:1.5em;"&gt;
"When you get back into the ancient world, you find this recurring theme of a union between a non-human race and humans—creating a hybrid race."

"From 1998, I started coming across people who told me they had seen people change into a non-human form. It's an age-old phenomenon known as shape-shifting. The basic form is like a scaly humanoid, with reptilian rather than humanoid eyes."&lt;ref name="Scotsman2006"&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/the-royal-family-are-bloodsucking-alien-lizards-david-icke-1-1103954 "The Royal Family are bloodsucking alien lizards – David Icke"], ''The Scotsman'', 30 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Icke claims the first reptilian-human breeding programmes took place 200,000–300,000 years ago (perhaps creating [[Adam]]),&lt;ref name=Icke1999p40/&gt; and the third (and latest) 7,000 years ago. Icke claims the hybrids of the third programme, which are more Anunnaki than human, currently control the world. He writes in ''The Biggest Secret'' that: "The Brotherhood which controls the world today is the modern expression of the Babylonian Brotherhood of reptile-[[Aryan]] priests and 'royalty'". Icke states that they came together in [[Sumer]] after [[Genesis flood narrative|'the flood']], but originated in the [[Caucasus]].&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Icke1999p52&gt;Icke, ''Biggest Secret'', 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Icke1999p43&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Explaining that when he uses the term "Aryan" he is referring to "the white race."&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Icke states that the reptilians not only come from another planet, but also from another dimension, the lower level of the fourth dimension (the "lower [[Astral plane|astral dimension]]"), the one nearest the physical world.&lt;ref name=Biggest26/&gt; It is from this dimensions that they control the planet, although just as fourth-dimensional reptilians control us, they in turn are controlled by a fifth dimension.&lt;ref name=Biggest26&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Barkun argues that Icke's introduction of different dimensions allowed him to skip awkward questions about how the reptilians got here.&lt;ref name=Barkun2003p106/&gt; 

Icke believes that the only way this 'Archontic' influence can be defeated is by humanity waking up to 'the truth', and filling their hearts with love.&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt;

Icke briefly introduced his [[Ancient astronaut hypothesis|ancient-astronaut hypothesis]] in ''The Robot's Rebellion'' (1994), citing [[Milton William Cooper|Bill Cooper]]'s ''Behold a Pale Horse'' (1991), and expanded it in ''And the Truth Shall Set You Free'' (1995), citing Barbara Marciniak's ''Bringers of the Dawn'' (1992).&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Clarke2003p291/&gt;{{refn|group=n|Barbara Marciniak wrote that ''Bringers of the Dawn'' was a [[Mediumship|channelled]] book dictated from the [[Pleiades in folklore and literature|Pleiades]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Marciniak, ''Bringers of the Dawn'', Rochester: Bear &amp; Company, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Robertson writes that Icke's reptilian idea is adapted from [[Zecharia Sitchin]]'s ''The 12th Planet'' (1976), combined with material from [[Vusamazulu Credo Mutwa|Credo Mutwa]], a [[Zulu people|Zulu]] healer.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2013, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Sitchin suggested that the Anunnaki came to Earth for its precious metals. Icke has said that they came for what he refers to as 'mono-atomic gold', which he claims, can increase the capacity of the [[nervous system]] ten thousandfold, and that after ingesting it, the Anunnaki can process vast amounts of information, speed up trans-dimensional travel, and [[Shapeshifting|shapeshift]] from reptilian to human.&lt;ref name=Icke1999p30&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewis2010p81&gt;Lewis and Kahn 2010, 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis and Kahn argue that Icke is using [[allegory]] to depict the alien, and alienating, nature of global capitalism.&lt;ref name=Lewis2010p82/&gt; Icke has said he is not using allegory.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 150–151.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2003, the reptilian bloodline is claimed to encompassed 43 American presidents, three British and two Canadian prime ministers, several Sumerian kings and Egyptian pharaohs, and a smattering of celebrities. Key bloodlines include the [[Rockefeller family|Rockefeller]]s, [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]]s, various European aristocratic families, the establishment families of the Eastern United States, and the British [[House of Windsor]].&lt;ref name=Barkun2003p104/&gt; Icke confirmed to [[Andrew Neil]] in May 2016 that he believes the British Royal Family are shape-shifting lizards.&lt;ref name=Neil20May2016&gt;Andrew Neil, [https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36339298 "David Icke on 9/11 and lizards in Buckingham Palace theories"], ''This Week'', BBC (video), 20 May 2016, 00:04:02.&lt;/ref&gt; He identified the [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Mother]] in 2001 as "seriously reptilian",&lt;ref name=Barkun2003p104/&gt; and said he had seen [[Ted Heath]]'s eyes turn black while the two waited for a Sky News interview in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;David Icke, [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jan/22/broadcasting.observermagazine "This much I know"], interviewed by Ben Mitchell, ''The Observer'', 22 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Doyle17Feb2006&gt;Paul Doyle, [https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/feb/17/smalltalk.sportinterviews "David Icke"], ''The Guardian'', 17 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Brotherhood aims and institutions====
At the apex of the Babylonian Brotherhood stand the Global Elite, and at the top of the Global Elite are what Icke refers to as the 'Prison Wardens'. Icke claims the goal of the Brotherhood, or their "Great Work of Ages", is a microchipped population, a world government, and a global [[Orwellian]] [[Fascism|fascist]] state, or [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]], which he claims will be a [[post-truth]] era where [[freedom of speech]] is ended.&lt;ref name=Barkun2003p103/&gt;&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Neil20May2016/&gt;&lt;ref name="LEPredpilled" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Clarke2003p291/&gt;&lt;ref name=Barkun2003p104&gt;Barkun 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA104 104].&lt;/ref&gt;

Icke believes that the "Brotherhood" use human anxiety as energy, and that the Archons keep humanity trapped in a "five sense reality", so they can feed off the negative energy created by fear and hate.&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewis2010p82&gt;Lewis and Kahn 2010, 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Claiming the more of these emotions that can be stimulated the more energy the reptilians have to work with, Icke wrote in 1999: "Thus we have the encouragement of wars, human genocide, the mass slaughter of animals, sexual perversions which create highly charged negative energy, and black magic ritual and sacrifice which takes place on a scale that will stagger those who have not studied the subject."&lt;ref name=Icke1999p40&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Icke proposes that human sacrifice 'to the gods' in the ancient world was for the benefit of the reptilians, especially sacrifice of children, because "at the moment of death by sacrifice a form of adrenalin surges through the body, accumulating at the base of the brain and is, apparently more potent in children", claiming "this is what the reptilians and their crossbreeds want". Icke suggests that these sacrifices continue to this day.&lt;ref name=Icke1999p40&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 40.&lt;/ref&gt; He also claims the reptilians and their hybrid bloodlines engage in [[pedophilia]] and [[cannibalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 152.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is claimed that the Brotherhood either created, or controls; the [[United Nations]], [[International Monetary Fund]], [[Round Table (club)|Round Table]], [[Council on Foreign Relations]], [[Chatham House]], [[Club of Rome]], [[Royal Institute of International Affairs]], [[Trilateral Commission]] and [[Bilderberg Group]], as well as the media, military, [[CIA]], [[MI6]], [[Mossad]], science, religion, and the [[Internet]], with witting or unwitting support from the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref name=Jonson17March2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clarke2003p291/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''Children of the Matrix'', 339. For London School of Economics, Icke, ''Human Race Get off Your Knees, 134, 646, and Jonathan Kay, ''Among the Truthers: A Journey Through America's Growing Conspiracist Underground'', HarperCollins, 2011, 180.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewis2010p83&gt;Lewis and Kahn 2010, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Controversy of antisemitism ====

David Icke has been accused of antisemitism on numerous occasions. After Icke's talk in Vancouver on Sept. 2 2017, the Canadian Jewish News called Icke "a controversial conspiracy theorist, anti-Semite and Holocaust denier" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gindin |first1=Matthew |title=Anti-Semitic Conspiracy Theorist David Icke Gives Talk in Vancouver |url=http://www.cjnews.com/news/canada/anti-semitic-conspiracy-theorist-david-icke-gives-talk-vancouver |website=[[The Canadian Jewish News]] | publisher=The Canadian Jewish News |accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following complaints from the [[Canadian Jewish Congress]] in 2000, Icke was briefly detained by immigration officials in Canada where he was booked for a speaking tour,&lt;ref name=Jonson17March2001/&gt; and his books were removed from [[Indigo Books]], a Canadian chain. Several stops on the tour were cancelled by the venues, as was a lecture in London.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Kraft, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070301204725/http://www.cjnews.com/pastIssues/99/oct7-99/front2.htm "New Age speaker set to talk in Toronto"], ''The Canadian Jewish News'', 7 October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jason Cowley, [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-5116145.html "The Icke Files"], ''The Independent on Sunday'', 1 October 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Two venues in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]], cancelled live events scheduled to be hosted by Icke in 2017 following accusations of antisemitism. The Maritim hotel did not give a reason for the cancellation, but The Carl Benz Arena stated on its [[Facebook]] page that it was due to the "contentious nature and the contradictory statements, which for us as a politically neutral event venue do not give a clear picture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lizard conspiracist David Icke not wanted in Berlin|url=http://www.dw.com/en/lizard-conspiracist-david-icke-not-wanted-in-berlin/a-37693384|accessdate=26 May 2018|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An event to be held at [[Manchester United]]'s [[Old Trafford]] was also cancelled in 2017, with the venue stating it was due to Icke's "objectionable views."&lt;ref name="GuardianManU"&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Jackson |first1=Jamie |title=Manchester United cancel David Icke show at Old Trafford after backlash |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/17/manchester-united-cancel-david-icke-show-at-old-trafford-social-media-backlash |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=11 June 2018|date=2017-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Icke repeatedly denies he is an anti-Semite and many of the people Icke has publicly named as reptilian are not Jewish. In 2001, when questioned by [[Jon Ronson]], Icke declared that the Protocols of Zion is evidence not of a Jewish plot, but of a reptilian plot. Icke also stated: "the families in positions of great financial power obsessively interbreed with each other. But I'm not talking about one earth race, Jewish or non-Jewish. I'm talking about a genetic network that operates through all races, this bloodline being a fusion of human and reptilian genes....let me make myself clear - this does not in any way relate to an earth race." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ronson |first1=Jon| authorlink=Jon Ronson |title=Beset by Lizards |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/17/features.weekend |website=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate= 6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His message is consistent over time.  However, he tends to refer to the reptilian plot as the "unseen".  After Icke's 2018 talk in Southport, UK, [[Michael Marshall (skeptic)|Michael Marshall]] reported:

{{quote|
"The appearance of the ‘unseen’ in the Middle East 6,000 years ago seems to be no coincidence, and it’s little wonder that Icke’s work is so often accused of anti-Semitism. However, if we were to accept that Icke himself does not hold such views, and that his work is merely co-opted by groups who undeniably are anti-Semitic, we also have to acknowledge that Icke often does his case no favours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Marshall |first1=Michael | authorlink=Michael Marshall (skeptic) |title=David Icke Live: What I Learned From Spending Four Hours With The World's Most Famous Conspiracy Theorist |url=http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2018/05/david-icke-live-what-i-learned-from-spending-four-hours-with-the-worlds-most-famous-conspiracy-theorist/ |website=Gizmodo - UK |accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Problem–reaction–solution===
Icke uses the phrase 'problem–reaction–solution' to explain how he believes the Illuminati agenda advances. They guide the population in the direction they desire by creating false problems, which then creates a reaction from the target population, which then allows them to give their desired solution to the problem they created.&lt;ref name=Robertson2016p139&gt;Robertson 2016, 139.&lt;/ref&gt; He also refers to this process as "order out of chaos".&lt;ref name=IckeNov152009&gt;David Icke, [https://web.archive.org/web/20101206225716/http://www.newsforthesoul.com/icke-2.htm "Problem-reaction-solution"], ''News for the Soul'', accessed 12 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Incidents and issues Icke attributes to the Illuminati, or 'Global Elite', include the [[Oklahoma City bombing]], [[Dunblane school massacre|Dunblane]], [[Columbine High School massacre|Columbine]], [[9/11 conspiracy theories|9/11]] (which Icke believes was an '[[False flag|inside job]]' to provide an excuse to advance an agenda of [[regime change]] across the world), [[7/7]], [[global warming]], [[Chemtrail conspiracy theory|chemtrails]], [[water fluoridation]], the death of [[Princess Diana]], the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Agenda 21]].&lt;ref name="Scotsman2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''Human Race Get Off Your Knees: The Lion Sleeps No More''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For 9/11, Icke, ''Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For global warming and Agenda 21, Icke, ''Phantom Self'', 303.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LEP911"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Henry Widdas |title=David Icke: My unanswered 9/11 questions |url=https://www.lep.co.uk/news/opinion/david-icke-my-unanswered-9-11-questions-1-9196768 |website=[[Lancashire Evening Post]] |accessdate=19 June 2018 |language=English |date=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These incidents then allow them to respond in whatever way they intended to act in the first place.&lt;ref name=IckeNov152009&gt;David Icke, [https://web.archive.org/web/20101206225716/http://www.newsforthesoul.com/icke-2.htm "Problem-reaction-solution"], ''News for the Soul'', accessed 12 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the methods Icke claims they use is creating fake opposites, or what he calls "opposames", such as the [[Axis powers|Axis]] and [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]] of World War II, which he believes were used to provoke the creation of the [[European Union]] and the state of [[Israel]].&lt;ref name=Robertson2016p139&gt;Robertson 2016, 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Icke argues that to ensure the outcome they want, they have to control both sides.&lt;ref name="LEPredpilled" /&gt; He believes that the [[President of the United States|US presidents]] [[George W. Bush]], [[Barack Obama]] and [[Donald Trump]] are part of a false [[Right-wing politics|right]] and [[Left-wing politics|left]] political divide. Despite the presidency belonging to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] then the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], then going back to the Republicans, Icke claims they are all pushing the same agenda of regime change in the [[Middle East]], a goal which was set out in the early [[2000s (decade)|2000s]] in a document called [[The Project for the New American Century]].&lt;ref name="LEPredpilled" /&gt; Icke claims that this [[Hegelian Dialectic|dialectic]] allows the Illuminati to gradually move societies toward [[totalitarianism]] without challenge, a process he refers to as the "totalitarian tiptoe".&lt;ref name=Robertson2016p139/&gt;

In ''Tales From The Time Loop'' (2003), Icke argues that the Illuminati create religious, racial, ethnic and sexual division to [[divide and rule]] humanity but believes that the many can only be controlled by the few if they allow themselves to be, and that the power the Illuminati have is the power the people give away to them.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 157.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=David Icke |title=Tales from the Time Loop: The Most Comprehensive Expose of the Global Conspiracy Ever Written and All You Need to Know to be Truly Free |date=30 September 2003 |publisher=Bridge of Love |isbn=978-0953881048 |page=447 |edition=First |language=0953881040}} &lt;/ref&gt; Writing: "Divide and rule is the bottom line of all dictatorships...Arab is turned against Jew, black against white, Right against Left. Unplugging from the Matrix means refusing to recognise these illusory fault lines. We are all One. I refuse to see a Jew as different from an Arab and vice versa. They are both expressions of the One and need to be observed and treated the same, none more or less important than the other. I refuse to see black people in terms that I would not see white, nor to see the ‘Left’ as I would not see the ‘Right’. How could it be any different, except when we believe the illusion of division is real? If we do that, the Matrix has us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=David Icke |title=Tales from the Time Loop: The Most Comprehensive Expose of the Global Conspiracy Ever Written and All You Need to Know to be Truly Free |date=30 September 2003 |publisher=Bridge of Love |isbn=978-0953881048 |page=447 |edition=First |language=0953881040}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Icke's solution is peaceful [[non-compliance]], which he believes will disempower 'the elite'.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Red Dresses===
[[File:Red Dress Programmes by Neil Hague.jpg|thumb|alt=drawing|Image by Neil Hague from Icke's ''Infinite Love is the Only Truth'' (2005), showing [[Queen Elizabeth II]], [[George W. Bush]] and [[Tony Blair]] as ''Red Dresses'', the highest level of the Brotherhood.]]
In ''Infinite Love is the Only Truth'' (2005), Icke introduces his three categories of people. The Brotherhood are "interactive software programs", or "Red Dresses". They lack consciousness and free will, and their human bodies are holographic veils.&lt;ref&gt;David Icke, ''Infinite Love is the Only Truth: ''Everything'' Else is Illusion'', Wildwood, MO: Bridge of Love Publications, 2005, 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; A second group, the "[[sheeple]]" (the vast majority of humanity), are conscious, but do as they are told and are the Brotherhood's main energy source. They include the "repeaters", people in positions of influence who repeat what other people tell them; he cites doctors, teachers and journalists as examples.&lt;ref name=Love78/&gt;

The third and smallest group are those who see through the illusion; they are usually dubbed dangerous or mad. The Red Dress genetic lines interbreed obsessively to make sure their bloodlines are not weakened by the second or third levels of consciousness, because consciousness can rewrite the software.&lt;ref name=Love78&gt;Icke, ''Infinite Love is the Only Truth'', 78–81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Channel52006&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcQzOZmJykk "David Icke: Was He Right?"], [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]], 12 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saturn–Moon Matrix===
The Moon Matrix is introduced in ''Human Race Get Off Your Knees: The Lion Sleeps No More'' (2010), in which Icke suggests that the Earth and collective human mind are manipulated from the Moon, a [[hollow moon|spacecraft]] and inter-dimensional portal controlled by the reptilians. The Moon Matrix is a broadcast from that spacecraft to the human body–computer, specifically to the [[Lateralization of brain function|left hemisphere]] of the brain, which gives us our sense of reality: "We are living in a dreamworld within a dreamworld—a Matrix within the virtual-reality universe—and it is being broadcast from the Moon. Unless people force themselves to become fully conscious, their minds are the Moon's mind."&lt;ref&gt;David Icke, ''Human Race Get Off Your Knees: The Lion Sleeps No More'', Ryde: David Icke Books, 2010, 618, 627, 632.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Liam O'Brien |title=Prize-winning author Alice Walker gives support to David Icke on Desert Island Discs |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/prize-winning-author-alice-walker-gives-support-to-david-icke-on-desert-island-discs-8622648.html |website=Independent |accessdate=19 June 2018 |language=English |date=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This idea is further explored in Icke's ''Remember Who You Are: Remember 'Where' You Are and Where You 'Come' From'' (2012), where he introduces the concept of the "Saturn–Moon Matrix". In this more recent conceptualization, the rings of Saturn (which Icke believes were artificially created by reptilian spacecraft) are the ultimate source of the signal, while the Moon functions as an amplifier.&lt;ref name=Icke2012&gt;David Icke, ''Remember Who You Are: Remember 'Where' You Are and Where You 'Come' From'', Ryde: David Icke Books, 2012.&lt;!--page number--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 157.&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that frequencies broadcast from the [[Saturn's hexagon|hexagonal storm on Saturn]] are amplified through the hollow structure of our artificial moon keeping humanity trapped in a holographic projection.&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt;

Icke's has considerable popular appeal, cutting across political, economic, and religious divides. His audiences hold a wide range of beliefs, uniting individuals, and left and right wing groups; from [[New Age]]rs, and [[Ufologists]],&lt;ref name=Lewis2010p75/&gt;&lt;ref name=Barkun2003p106&gt;Barkun 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA106 106].&lt;/ref&gt; to far-right [[Christian Patriot]]s, and the UK [[neo-Nazi]] group [[Combat 18]], which supports his writings.&lt;ref name=Lewis2010p75/&gt; He has emerged as a professional [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorist]]&lt;ref&gt;Barkun 2011, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XAMYE8OLzu0C&amp;pg=PA72 72].&lt;/ref&gt; within a global [[counter-cultural]] movement that combines [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order conspiracism]], the [[9/11 Truth movement|truther]] movement and [[Anti-globalization movement|anti-globalization]], with an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] conspiracist subculture ([[Roswell UFO incident|Roswell]], [[alien abduction]], [[crop circles]], [[men in black]], ''[[The X-Files]]'').&lt;ref name=Lewis2010p75/&gt; 

Critics view  Icke's "reptilians" and other theories as [[antisemitic]],&lt;ref name="DW Berlin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RothInstitute2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephen Roth Institute|authorlink=Stephen Roth Institute|title=Antisemitism Worldwide, 2000/1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Db7i1y806WUC&amp;pg=PA146|date=1 September 2002|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-5945-4|pages=146–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accuse him of [[Holocaust denial]].&lt;ref name="DW Berlin"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lizard conspiracist David Icke not wanted in Berlin|url=http://www.dw.com/en/lizard-conspiracist-david-icke-not-wanted-in-berlin/a-37693384|accessdate=26 May 2018|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have claimed that Icke's reptilians were really code for Jews, which Icke called "total friggin' nonsense", and stated: "this is not a plot on the world by Jewish people".&lt;ref&gt;Jon Ronson, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2ypYcZ7qfw "David Icke, the Lizards, and the Jews"], Channel 4, 6 May 2001, 00:16:30.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Icke states in ''And the truth shall set you free'' (1996):{{quote|why do we play a part in suppressing alternative information to the official line of the Second World War? How is it right that while this fierce suppression goes on, free copies of the Spielberg film, Schindler's List, are given to schools to indoctrinate children with the unchallenged version of events. And why do we, who say we oppose tyranny and demand freedom of speech, allow people to go to prison and be vilified, and magazines to be closed down on the spot, for suggesting another version of history.&lt;ref name=holocaust/&gt;}}

Icke claims that the antisemitic forgery ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' is genuine, explaining in ''And the truth shall set you free'': {{quote|I strongly believe that a small Jewish clique which has contempt for the mass of Jewish people worked with non-Jews to create the First World War, the Russian Revolution, and the Second World War....They then dominated the Versailles Peace Conference and created the circumstances which made the Second World War inevitable. They financed Hitler to power in 1933 and made the funds available for his rearmament.&lt;ref name=holocaust/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.smh.com.au/opinion/dont-waste-your-money-to-see-conspiracy-theorist-david-icke-20160711-gq3gaa.html | title=Don't waste your money to see conspiracy theorist David Icke| date=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Icke claims that Jews themselves are to blame for antisemitism (a classic Nazi claim that can be traced to [[Adolf Hitler]]): {{quote|Thought patterns in the collective Jewish mind have repeatedly created that physical reality of oppression, prejudice and racism which matches the pattern—the expectation—programmed into their collective psyche. They expect it; they create it.&lt;ref name=nazi&gt;{{cite web |title=From Green Messiah to New Age Nazi |url=http://social-ecology.org/wp/1996/01/left-green-perspectives-35/ |publisher=[[Institute for Social Ecology]] |accessdate=18 August 2018|date=January 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Political Research Associates]] described Icke's politics as "a mishmash of most of the dominant themes of contemporary neofascism, mixed in with a smattering of topics culled from the U.S. militia movement."  He opposes [[gun control]], and claims that many [[mass shooting]]s were orchestrated in order to increase public opposition to guns. He accuses the U.S. government of carrying out the [[Oklahoma City bombing]].&lt;ref name=holocaust&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publiceye.org/Icke/IckeBackgrounder.htm |title=David Icke And The Politics Of Madness Where The New Age Meets The Third Reich |last=Offley |first=Will |publisher=[[Political Research Associates]] |date=29 February 2000|accessdate=2 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He endorses or recommends antisemitic and [[far-right]] publications such as ''[[The Spotlight|Spotlight]]'' and ''On Target'', the magazine of the [[white supremacist]] group the "[[British League of Rights]]", and he has been closely associated with antisemitic "New Age" periodicals such as ''[[Nexus (magazine)|Nexus]]'' and ''Rainbow Ark'', a "New Age" magazine financed by far-right activists and affiliated with the neo-Nazi [[National Front (UK)|National Front]].&lt;ref name=nazi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rainbow Ark magazine |url=https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Rainbow_Ark_magazine |publisher=[[Center for Media and Democracy]] |accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The neo-Nazi terrorist group Combat 18 promotes Icke's lectures in its internal journal ''Putsch''; at one such event, the journal states approvingly, Icke {{quote|spoke of "the sheep" and how the Zionist-operated government, sorry, "Illuminati", uses them for its own ends. He began to talk about the big conspiracy by a group of bankers, media moguls, etc. - always being clever enough not to mention what all these had in common.&lt;ref name=holocaust/&gt;}}

David G. Robertson in his book, ''UFOs, Conspiracy Theories and the New Age'', stated that Icke was not anti-Semitic. Saying that in order to believe that when Icke said reptilians he really meant Jews, was just easier for some to accept than that he literally means extraterrestrial reptilians control world politics. Pointing out that in order to believe the accusations of antisemitism you must ignore numerous things. Such as, the many high profile people he names as reptilian who are not Jewish, a point which was also made by [[Jon Ronson]] in his 2001 documentary ''Secret Rulers Of The World''. You must also ignore the frequent statements by Icke that he is speaking literally and not metaphorically. And you must ignore the fact he identifies the supposedly reptilian ruling elite as '[[Aryan]]' in several places, which specifically contradicts the idea that reptilian is code for 'Jew'. Also noting that Icke denounces racism calling it "the ultimate idiocy"&lt;ref name="Robertson1" /&gt;

[[Michael Barkun]] has described Icke's position as New Age [[conspiracism]], writing that Icke is the most fluent of the genre,&lt;ref&gt;Barkun 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA98 98]; [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA103 103ff], 163.&lt;/ref&gt; describing his work as "improvisational [[millennialism]]", with an end-of-history scenario involving a final battle between good and evil. Barkun defines improvisional [[millennialism]] as an "act of [[bricolage]]": because everything is connected in the conspiracist world view, every source can be mined for links.&lt;ref&gt;Barkun 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA10 10–11], [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA107 107–108], 184.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Add that 9/11 made conspiracism and therefore Icke more popular--&gt; Barkun argues that Icke has actively tried to cultivate the radical right stating that "There is no fuller explication of [their] beliefs about ruling elites than Icke's." He also notes that Icke regards Christian patriots as the only Americans who understand the "New World Order".&lt;ref&gt;Barkun 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA106 106], [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA108 108].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barkun 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA107 107].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Icke spoke to a conference in [[Reno, Nevada]], alongside opponents of the [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act]], including Kirk Lyons, a lawyer who has represented the [[Ku Klux Klan]].&lt;ref name=Barkun2003p106/&gt; But it has been pointed out that Icke has never been a member of any right wing group, and has criticised them.&lt;ref name="Robertson1"&gt;{{cite book |author1=David G. Robertson |title=UFOs, Conspiracy Theories and the New Age |date=25 February 2016 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1474253208 |pages=150–151 |edition=First |language=English |chapter=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relying on [[Douglas Kellner]]'s distinction between clinical [[paranoia]] and a "critical paranoia" that confronts power, Richard Kahn and Tyson Lewis argue that Icke displays elements of both, and that his reptilian hypothesis and "postmodern metanarrative" may be [[Allegory|allegorical]], a [[Jonathan Swift|Swiftian]] [[satire]] used to give ordinary people a narrative with which to question what they see around them and to alert them to the alleged emergence of a global fascist state.&lt;ref name=Lewis2010p75/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis and Kahn 2010, 73ff, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tyson Lewis, Richard Kahn, "The Reptoid Hypothesis: Utopian and Dystopian Representational Motifs in David Icke's Alien Conspiracy Theory," ''Utopian Studies'', 16(1), Spring 2005 (45–74), 52, 55–56. {{jstor|20718709}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis and Kahn 2010, 88ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to Icke's prominence, public figures are regularly asked whether they are lizards. An [[Official Information Act 1982|Official Information Act]] request was filed in New Zealand in 2008 to ask this of [[John Key]], the then prime minister, and Facebook's [[Mark Zuckerberg]] was asked the same during a Q&amp;A in 2016. (Both men said they were not lizards. Key added that he had taken the unusual step of consulting not only a doctor but a vet.)&lt;ref&gt;Ben Guarino, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/06/15/i-am-not-a-lizard-mark-zuckerberg-is-latest-celebrity-asked-about-reptilian-conspiracy/ "‘I am not a lizard’: Mark Zuckerberg is latest celebrity asked about reptilian conspiracy"], ''The Washington Post'', 15 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 survey in the United States by [[Public Policy Polling]], 4% believed that "'lizard people' control our societies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2013/04/conspiracy-theory-poll-results-.html "Conspiracy Theory Poll Results"], Public Policy Polling, 2 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Harris, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/02/americans-obama-anti-christ-conspiracy-theories "One in four Americans think Obama may be the antichrist, survey says"], ''The Guardian'', 2 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olga Oksman, [https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/07/conspiracy-theory-paranoia-aliens-illuminati-beyonce-vaccines-cliven-bundy-jfk "Conspiracy craze: why 12 million Americans believe alien lizards rule us"], ''The Guardian'', 7 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

James Ward states that "In some ways, you could say [Icke's] been vindicated. For years he has claimed that people operating at the highest levels of the establishment were members of secret paedophile networks, claims that now routinely appear on the front pages of our newspapers. Many of the people at the centre of these stories were even specifically named by Icke in print years ago." Except that, "even on this issue Icke’s credibility is compromised by his habit of naming more or less everyone and claiming they are all part of the same network. Inevitably, he’s going to be right once in a while – after all, if you throw enough shit at a stopped clock, some of it will stick. And throw shit he does." Adding that, Icke's underlying message is positive, which "might hint at why it appeals to some": as Icke said at Wembley in 2012, "If we want a world of love and peace, we have to be loving and peaceful with everyone, even people we don't like."&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt;

Their discovery by Galileo Galilei supported one bundle of hypotheses concerning the nature of the Solar System, which the papal authorities denied in favour of a different bundle.]]

The '''Duhem–Quine thesis''', also called the '''Duhem–Quine problem''', after [[Pierre Duhem]] and [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], is that it is impossible to test a [[scientific hypothesis]] in isolation, because an [[empirical method|empirical]] test of the hypothesis requires one or more background assumptions (also called ''auxiliary assumptions'' or ''auxiliary hypotheses''). In recent decades the set of associated assumptions supporting a thesis sometimes is called a ''bundle of hypotheses''.

==The substance of the thesis==
The Duhem–Quine thesis argues that no scientific hypothesis is by itself capable of making predictions.&lt;ref name="Harding1976"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sandra Harding|title=Can theories be refuted?: essays on the Duhem-Quine thesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uwit8JTcLfAC&amp;pg=PR9|year=1976|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-90-277-0630-0|pages=9–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, deriving predictions from the hypothesis typically requires background assumptions that several other hypotheses are correct; for example, that an experiment works as predicted or that previous scientific theory is sufficiently accurate. For instance, as evidence against the idea that the [[Earth]] is in motion, some people objected that birds did not get thrown off into the sky whenever they let go of a tree branch. Later theories of physics and astronomy, such as [[classical mechanics|classical]] and [[relativistic mechanics]] could account for such observations without positing a fixed Earth, and in due course they replaced the static-Earth auxiliary hypotheses and initial conditions.

Although a bundle of hypotheses (i.e. a hypothesis and its background assumptions) ''as a whole'' can be tested against the empirical world and be falsified if it fails the test, the Duhem–Quine thesis says it is impossible to isolate a single hypothesis in the bundle.  One solution to the dilemma thus facing scientists is that when we have rational reasons to accept the background assumptions as true (e.g. explanatory scientific theories together with their respective supporting evidence) we will have rational—albeit nonconclusive—reasons for thinking that the theory under test probably is wrong in at least one respect if the empirical test fails.

==Example from Galilean astronomy== 
The pioneering work of [[Galileo Galilei]] in the application of the [[telescope]] to astronomical observation met with rejection from influential sceptics. They denied the truth of his most startling reports, such as that there were [[Galileo Galilei|mountains on the moon]] and [[satellite]]s around Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;Galilei, Galileo. Sidereus nuncius. 1610. [https://archive.org/details/Sidereusnuncius00Gali]&lt;/ref&gt; In particular some prominent philosophers, most  notoriously [[Cesare Cremonini (philosopher)|Cesare Cremonini]], refused to look through the telescope, arguing in effect that the instrument might have introduced [[Artifact (error)|artefacts]] producing illusions of mountains or satellites invisible to the unencumbered eye. To neglect such possibilities amounted to [[underdetermination]] in which argument for optical artefacts could be urged as being of merit equal to arguments for observation of new celestial effects, whether the latter were more parsimonious or not. On a similar principle in modern times a prevalent view is that [[Marcello Truzzi#.22Extraordinary claims.22|extraordinary claims demand extraordinary proof]].

In the early 17th century the modern version&lt;ref name="Harding1976"/&gt; of the Duhem–Quine thesis had not been formulated, but commonsense objections to such elaborate and ad hoc implicit auxiliary assumptions certainly could be urged. To begin with, the mechanism of the (Galilean) telescopes had been explained in terms of [[geometrical optics]] and the nature of the objects that they imaged was consistent; for example a distant lake would not resemble a tree when seen through a telescope. The behaviour of telescopes on Earth denied any basis for arguing that they could create systematic artefacts in the sky, such as apparent satellites that behaved in the predictable manner of Jovian moons. Evidence also offered no basis to suggest that they could present yet other, more elaborate artefacts, fundamentally different from the satellites, such as Lunar mountains that cast shadows varying consistently with the direction of Solar illumination. 

In practice of course, the [[Galileo affair|politics and theology]] of the day trumped common sense, but the nature of the controversy was a clear example of how different bundles of (usually implicit) auxiliary assumptions could support mutually inconsistent hypotheses concerning a single topic. In terms of either version of the Duhem–Quine thesis it therefore is necessary to study the defensibility of the auxiliary assumptions together with the primary hypotheses if one is to select the most viable working hypotheses.

==Pierre Duhem==
As popular as the Duhem–Quine thesis may be in [[philosophy of science]], in reality [[Pierre Duhem]] and [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] stated very different theses.  Duhem believed that ''only in the field of [[physics]]'' can a single individual hypothesis not be isolated for testing.  He says in no uncertain terms that experimental theory in physics is not the same as in fields like [[physiology]] and certain branches of [[chemistry]]. Also, Duhem's conception of "theoretical group" has its limits, since he states that not all concepts are connected to each other logically. He did not include at all ''a priori'' disciplines such as [[logic]] and [[mathematics]] within the theoretical groups in physics, since they cannot be tested.

== Willard Van Orman Quine ==
{{See also|Confirmation holism}}
Quine, on the other hand, in "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]", presents a much stronger version of [[underdetermination]] in science.  His theoretical group embraces ''all'' of human knowledge, including mathematics and logic. He contemplated the entirety of human knowledge as being one unit of empirical significance.   Hence all our knowledge, for Quine, would be [[epistemological]]ly no different from [[Ancient history|ancient]] [[Greek gods]], which were posited in order to account for experience.

Quine even believed that logic and mathematics can also be revised in light of experience, and presented [[quantum logic]] as evidence for this.  Years later he retracted this position; in his book ''Philosophy of Logic'', he said that to revise logic would be essentially "changing the subject". In classic logic, connectives are defined according to [[truth value]]s. The connectives in a multi-valued logic, however, have a different meaning than those of classic logic. As for [[quantum]] logic, it is not even a logic based on truth values, so the logical connectives lose the original meaning of classic logic. Quine also notes that [[deviant logic]]s usually lack the simplicity of classic logic, and are not so fruitful.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3420">{{short description|The literal consumption of an ecosystem}}
{{more footnotes|date=April 2008}}

'''Ecophagy''' is a term coined by [[Robert Freitas]] that means the literal consumption of an [[ecosystem]]. It derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] "οικος" (oikos) or  [[Late Latin]] "oeco-", which refers to a "house" or "household", and the Greek "φᾰγεῖν" (phagein), "to eat".

Freitas used the term to describe a scenario involving [[molecular nanotechnology]] gone awry. In this situation (called the [[grey goo]] scenario) out-of-control [[Self-replicating machine|self-replicating nanorobots]] consume entire ecosystems, resulting in global ecophagy.&lt;br/&gt;
However, the word "ecophagy" is now applied more generally in reference to any event{{dubious|date=April 2012}}—nuclear war, the spread of [[monoculture]], massive species extinctions—that might fundamentally alter the planet. Scholars suggest that these events might result in [[ecological collapse|ecocide]] in that they would undermine the capacity of the Earth's biological population to repair itself. Others suggest that more mundane and less spectacular events—the [[human overpopulation|unrelenting growth of the human population]], the steady transformation of the natural world by human beings—will eventually result in a planet that is considerably less vibrant, and one that is, apart from humans, essentially lifeless. These people believe that the current human trajectory puts us on a path that will eventually lead to ecophagy.
In the paper in which Freitas coined the term he wrote:&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Freitas]], (2000) ''Some Limits to Global Ecophagy by Biovorous Nanoreplicators, with Public Policy Recommendations''&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Perhaps the earliest-recognized and best-known danger of molecular nanotechnology is the risk that self-replicating nanorobots capable of functioning autonomously in the natural environment could quickly convert that natural environment (e.g., "biomass") into replicas of themselves (e.g., "nanomass") on a global basis, a scenario usually referred to as the "grey goo problem" but perhaps more properly termed "global ecophagy".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:ECN-terrein Petten.jpg|thumb|right|ECN in Petten]]
The '''Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands''' ('''ECN''') is one of the largest [[energy]] research institute in Europe and holds a strong international position. With and for the market, ECN develops knowledge and technology that enable a transition to a sustainable energy system. The main office is located in [[Petten]]. ECN also has offices in [[Amsterdam]], [[Eindhoven]], [[Wieringermeer]], [[Brussels]] and [[China]]. ECN has a staff of about 550 employees.

==Activities==
ECN’s research and technology development focuses on:
* [[Solar Energy]]
* [[Wind Energy]]
* [[Biomass]]
* Environmental research
* Energy efficiency
* Policy Studies

The total package of sustainable energy generation, clean use of fossil fuels and reduction of total energy use are key topics. ECN also conducts research on future opportunities and economic backgrounds in the field of energy.

==Publications==
ECN researchers disseminate their results in publications such as reports, peer reviewed articles in scientific and professional journals, conference contributions and books and chapters in books. In 2011, ECN published 481 reports (public and confidential) and 176 articles in scientific journals.

==International position==
ECN participates in international projects, advises authorities and collaborates with the industry in the Netherlands, Europe and worldwide. A number of examples:
* EERA: together with nine other research organisations in Europe, ECN founded the European Energy Research Alliance (EERA). The aim is to harmonise the research programmes through joint research and optimal deployment of facilities. 
* ADEM: an initiative of ECN and three collaborating Technical Universities ([[Delft University of Technology]], [[Eindhoven University of Technology]], and the [[University of Twente]]). They wish to give strong impetus to Dutch materials research in relation to energy technology.
* FLOW: the FLOW programme enables Dutch businesses to take a leading position on the international market for offshore wind farms. The programme was initiated by RWE, Eneco, TenneT, Ballast Nedam, Van Oord, IHC Merwede, 2-B Energy, XECM Darwind, ECN and Delft University of technology. 
* Solliance: Solliance is a collaboration of TNO, Eindhoven University of Technology, ECN and IMEC, focusing on research and development in the field of thin film solar panels (PV) in the ELAT region (Eindhoven-Louvain-Aachen triangle).
* CARENA ('''CA'''talytic '''RE'''actors based on '''N'''ew m'''A'''terials): a European collaborative project coordinated by ECN. The project aim to create possibilities for the use of cheaper, less reactive, raw materials by using membrane reactor technology. CARENA brings together companies and institutes from 8 European countries. European chemical companies as Akzo Nobel and Arkema ensure a strong industrial leadership to the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecn.nl/fileadmin/ecn/units/ei/images/IEG/Public_project_summary_CARENA_-_negotiation_phase.pdf |title=Public project summary CARENA - negotiation phase |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, ECN participates in the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] and the [[International Energy Agency]].

==History==
ECN received its current name in 1976. Before that time, the centre, which was founded in 1955, was solely focused on the peaceful deployment of nuclear energy  under the name of Reactor Centre Netherlands (RCN). In 1976 it became clear that the energy supply of the future should not rely on nuclear energy alone. Alternative forms of energy were called for. RCN was appointed as the institute that should conduct the largest part of this research.

==Subsidiary company==
The [[Nuclear Research and Consultancy Group]] (NRG) is a full subsidiary of ECN and the most important manufacturer of radio-active isotopes for medical use in Europe. NRG manages the nuclear reactors in Petten, which are owned by the European Union.
Admatec Europe is partially owned by ECN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3dprintingmaterialsconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/20140620_Admatecprintconf_publ.pdf |title=Presentation Admatec Europe 2014 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Admatec Europe manufactures ceramic components via 3D printing.

==Board of directors and Supervisory Board==
The Board of directors of ECN consists of one statutory director (chairman of the board of directors) and two deputy directors. The Supervisory Board consists of six members. It is the duty of the Supervisory Board to supervise the administration of the foundation by the Board of directors as well as the general affairs. The members of the Supervisory Board are appointed by the Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs, Agriculture and Innovation.

== Controversies == 
A former director of ECN, Wim Stam, made headlines with his private investment in four windmills. In his role as public servant, Wim Stam also advised the Dutch Government on the placement, quality and efficiency of wind mills.
Wim made over one million Euros with his private investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/economie/belangenverstrengeling-bij-adviseur-windenergie~a4230597/ |title=Conflict of Interest Article Volkskrant 2016 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his actions, ECN changed its regulations so conflict of interests would be prevented in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/ecn-scherpt-regels-aan-na-schijn-van-belangenverstrengeling~a4242972/ |title=ECN changes regulations after conflict of Interest Wim Stam, Volkskrant 2016 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3138">'''EuroNanoForum 2009''' was the fourth conference in a set of [[Europe]]an [[nanotechnology]] conferences organized within the framework of national presidencies and promoted by DG research, Directorate G.

==Previous Conferences==

The EuroNanoForum 2009 conference built up on the success of EuroNanoForum 2003, EuroNanoForum 2005 and EuronanoForum 2007 and addressed “Nanotechnology for sustainable economy”. The focus was to grow opportunity and responsibility to leveraging nanotechnology to reduce [[pollution]], conserve resources and, ultimately, build a "clean" environmentally sustainable economy as well as to address concerns for the safe and responsible the development of nanotechnology.

The EuroNanoForum 2009 was organized as a four-day conference taking place from June 2–5, 2009 at [[Prague]] Conference Centre (CCP) within the frame of the Czech presidency, which ran from January to June 2009. The conference was conceived as an accompanying event of the presidency, under the auspices of the Czech Ministry for Education Youth and Sports (MEYS) as a support action of NMP programme of FP7. The EuroNanoForum 2009 focused on the “Nanotechnology for sustainable economy” exploring environmental as well as societal impact of the industrial applications of nanotechnology. This issue involves not only very broad and diverse areas of nanotechnology R&amp;D such as nanomaterials, nanoelectronics and [[photonics]], and bionanotechnologies but also energetics, [[environmental engineering]], [[toxicology]] and even [[climatology]]. This created a unique opportunity for researches and industrial experts coming from diverse fields of science and technology to meet each other and get involved in inspiring and fruitful dialogue or start cross-fertilising collaboration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21691">'''Functional integration''' is the study of how brain regions try work together to process information and effect responses. Though functional integration frequently relies on anatomic knowledge of the connections between brain areas, the emphasis is on how large clusters of neurons – numbering in the thousands or millions – fire together under various stimuli. The large datasets required for such a whole-scale picture of brain function have motivated the development of several novel and general methods for the statistical analysis of interdependence, such as dynamic causal modelling and statistical linear parametric mapping. These datasets are typically gathered in human subjects by non-invasive methods such as [[Electroencephalography|EEG]]/[[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]], [[fMRI]], or [[Positron emission tomography|PET]]. The results can be of clinical value by helping to identify the regions responsible for psychiatric disorders, as well as to assess how different activities or lifestyles affect the functioning of the brain.

A study's choice of imaging modality depends on the desired spatial and temporal resolution. fMRI and PET offer relatively high spatial resolution, with [[voxel]] dimensions on the order of a few millimeters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Luca|first=M. |last2= Beckmann|first2= CF|last3=De Stefano |title=fMRI resting state networks define distinct modes of long-distance interactions in the human brain |url= |journal=NeuroImage |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=1359–67 |doi= 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.08.035 |pmid= 16260155 |first3= N |last4=Matthews |first4= PM |last5=Smith |first5= SM|year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but their relatively low sampling rate hinders the observation of rapid and transient interactions between distant regions of the brain. These temporal limitations are overcome by MEG, but at the cost of only detecting signals from much larger clusters of neurons.&lt;ref name = "BB"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hamalainen, M.|title=Magnetoencephalography-theory, instrumentation, and applications to noninvasive studies of the working human brain|journal=Rev.

Phys. |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=413–97 |year=1993 |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.65.413 |first2=Riitta |last3=Ilmoniemi|first3=Risto J. |last4=Knuutila|first4=Jukka |last5=Lounasmaa|first5=Olli V.|last2=Hari |bibcode=1993RvMP...65..413H|url=https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi:443/bitstream/123456789/18757/1/A1_h%c3%a4m%c3%a4l%c3%a4inen_matti_1993.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===fMRI===
{{Main|Functional magnetic resonance imaging}}

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a form of MRI that is most frequently used to take advantage of a difference in magnetism between [[Hemoglobin|oxy-]] and [[Hemoglobin|deoxyhemoglobin]] to assess blood flow to different parts of the brain. Typical sampling rates for fMRI images are in the tenths of seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Nikos Logothetis|Logothetis, N. K.]]|title=What we can do and what we cannot do with fMRI|journal=Nature |volume=453 |issue=7197 |pages=869–78 |year=2008 |doi=10.1038/nature06976|url=http://kyb.mpg.de/fileadmin/user_upload/files/publications/attachments/NikosNatureJune2008_%5B0%5D.pdf |pmid=18548064|bibcode = 2008Natur.453..869L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MEG===
{{Main|Magnetoencephalography}}

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is an imaging modality that uses very sensitive magnetometers to measure the magnetic fields resulting from ionic currents flowing through neurons in the brain. High-quality MEG machines allow for sub-millisecond sampling rates.&lt;ref name = "BB" /&gt;

===PET===
{{Main|Positron emission tomography}}

PET works by introducing a radiolabeled biologically active molecule. The choice of molecule dictates what is visualized: by using a radiolabeled analog of glucose, for example, one can obtain an image whose intensity distribution indicates metabolic activity. PET scanners offer sampling rates in the tenths of seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bailey |first=DL |year=2005 |title=Positron Emission Tomography: Basic Sciences |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-1-84628-007-8 |oclc=209853466|doi=10.1007/b136169 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multimodal imaging===
{{Main|History of neuroimaging|l1=Multimodal imaging}}

Multimodal imaging frequently consists of the coupling of an electrophysiologic measurement technique, such as EEG or MEG, with a hemodynamic one such as fMRI or PET. While the intention is to use the strengths and limitations of each to complement the other, current approaches suffer from experimental limitations.&lt;ref name = "CC"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rosa, MJ|title=EEG-fMRI integration: a critical review of biophysical modeling and data analysis approaches|journal=Journal of Integrative Neuroscience |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=453–76 |year=2010 |pmid=21213414 |doi=10.1142/S0219635210002512 |first2=J |last3=Friston|first3=KJ|last2=Daunizeau}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some previous work has focused on attempting to use the high spatial resolution of fMRI to determine the (spatial) origin of EEG/MEG signals, so that in future work this spatial information could be extracted from a unimodal EEG/MEG signal. While some studies have seen success in correlating signal origins between modalities to within a few millimeters, the results have not been uniformly positive. Another current limitation is the actual experimental setup: taking measurements using both modalities at once yields inferior signals, but the alternative of measuring each modality separately is confounded by trial-to-trial variability.&lt;ref name = "CC" /&gt;

== Modes of analysis==
In functional integration, there is a distinction drawn between ''functional'' connectivity, and ''effective'' connectivity. Two brain regions are said to be functionally connected if there is a high correlation between the times that the two are firing, though this does not imply causality. Effective connectivity, on the other hand, is a description of the causal relationship between various brain regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Friston, K. |year=2002 |title=Functional integration and inference in the brain|journal=Progress in Neurobiology |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=113–43 |doi= 10.1016/s0301-0082(02)00076-x|pmid=12450490|citeseerx=10.1.1.318.4536 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While statistical assessment of the functional connectivity of multiple brain regions is non-trivial, determining the causality of which brain regions influence which to fire is much thornier, and requires solutions to ill-posed optimization problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Friston, K. |year=2003 |title=Dynamic causal modelling|journal=NeuroImage   |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=1273–302 |pmid = 12948688 |doi =10.1016/S1053-8119(03)00202-7 |first2 =L |last3=Penny |first3 =W|last2=Harrison }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dynamic causal modelling===
{{Main|Dynamic causal modelling}}

Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) is a Bayesian method for deducing the structure of a neural system based on the observed hemodynamic (fMRI) or electrophysiologic (EEG/MEG) signal. The first step is to make a prediction as to the relationships between the brain regions of interest, and formulate a system of ordinary differential equations describing the causal relationship between them, although many parameters (and relationships) will be initially unknown. Using previous results on how neural activity is known to translate into fMRI or EEG signals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Buxton, RB |year=1998 |title=Dynamics of blood flow and oxygenation changes during brain activation: the balloon model |journal=Magnetic Resonance in Medicine |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=855–64 |pmid=9621908 |doi =10.1002/mrm.1910390602 |first2 =EC |last3=Frank |first3 =LR |last2=Wong }}&lt;/ref&gt; one can take the measured signal and determine the likelihood that model parameters have particular values. The elucidated model can then be used to predict relationships between the considered brain regions under different conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Stephan, KE |year=2010 |title=Ten simple rules for dynamic causal modeling  |journal=NeuroImage |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=3099–109 |pmid=19914382 |doi =10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.11.015 |first2 =WD |last3=Moran |first3 =RJ |last4=Den Ouden |first4 =HE |last5=Daunizeau |first5 =J |last6=Friston |first6 =KJ |pmc =2825373|last2=Penny }}&lt;/ref&gt; A key factor to consider during the design of neuroimaging experiments involving DCM is the relationship between the timing of tasks or stimuli presented to the subject and the ability of DCM to determine the underlying relationships between brain regions, which is partially determined by the temporal resolution of the imaging modality in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Daunizeau, J. |year=2011 |title=Optimizing experimental design for comparing models of brain function |journal=PLOS Computational Biology |volume=7 |issue=11 |pages= e1002280|pmid=22125485 |doi =10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002280 |first2 =K |last3=Friston |first3 =K |last4=Stephan |first4 =K |pmc =3219623 |editor1-last =Sporns |editor1-first =Olaf |last2=Preuschoff |bibcode = 2011PLSCB...7E2280D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistical parametric mapping===
{{Main|Statistical parametric mapping}}

Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) is a method for determining whether the activation of a particular brain region changes between experimental conditions, stimuli, or over time. The essential idea is simple, and consists of two major steps: first, one performs a univariate statistical test on ''each individual voxel'' between each experimental condition.&lt;ref name = "AA"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Friston, K. |year=1995 |title=Statistical parametric maps in functional imaging: a general linear approach |journal=Human Brain Mapping |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=189–210 |doi=10.1002/hbm.460020402 |url=http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/Statistical%20parametric%20maps%20in%20functional%20imaging.pdf |first2 = A. P. |last3=Worsley |first3 = K. J. |last4=Poline |first4 = J.-P. |last5=Frith |first5 = C. D. |last6=Frackowiak |first6 = R. S. J.|last2=Holmes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, one analyzes the clustering of the voxels that show [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] differences, and determines which brain regions exhibit different levels of activation under different experimental conditions.

There is great flexibility in the choice of statistical test (and thus the questions that an experiment can be designed to answer), and common choices include the [[Student's t-test|Student's t test]] or [[linear regression]]. An important consideration with SPM, however, is that the large number of comparisons requires one to control the false positive rate with a more stringent significance threshold. This can be done either by modifying the initial statistical test to decrease the α value so as to make it harder for a particular voxel to exhibit a significant difference, or by modifying the clustering analysis in the second step by only considering a brain region's activation to be significant if it contains a certain number of voxels that exhibit a statistical difference.&lt;ref name = "AA" /&gt;

===Voxel-based morphometry===
{{Main|Voxel-based morphometry}}

Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is a method that allows one to measure brain tissue composition differences between subjects. To do so, one must first register all images to a standard coordinate system, by mapping them to a reference image. This is done by use of an affine transformation that minimizes the sum-of-squares intensity difference between the experimental image and the reference. Once this is done, the proportion of [[Grey matter|grey]] or [[white matter]] in a voxel can be determined by intensity. This allows one to compare the tissue composition of corresponding brain regions between different subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Ashburner, J.|year=2000 |title=Voxel-Based Morphometry-The Methods |journal=NeuroImage |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=805–21 |pmid=10860804 |doi = 10.1006/nimg.2000.0582 |first2 = KJ |last2=Friston |citeseerx=10.1.1.114.9512 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The ability to visualize whole-brain activity is frequently used in comparing brain function during various sorts of tasks or tests of skill, as well as in comparing brain structure and function between different groups of people.

===Changes in resting-state brain activation===
Many previous fMRI studies have seen that spontaneous activation of functionally connected brain regions occurs during the resting state, even in the absence of any sort of stimulation or activity. Human subjects presented with a visual learning task exhibit changes in functional connectivity in the resting state for up to 24 hours and [[dynamic functional connectivity]] studies have even shown changes in functional connectivity during a single scan. By taking fMRI scans of subjects before and after the learning task, as well as on the following day, it was shown that the activity had caused a resting-state change in [[Hippocampus|hippocampal]] activity.  Dynamic causal modeling revealed that the hippocampus also exhibited a new level of effective connectivity with the [[striatum]], though there was no learning-related change in any visual area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Urner, M.|year= 2013|title= Early visual learning induces long-lasting connectivity changes during rest in the human brain|journal=NeuroImage |volume=77|pages=148–56 |pmid=23558105 |doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.03.050 |first2 = DS |last3= Friston|first3 = K |last4= Rees|first4 = G |pmc = 3682182 |issue = 100 |last2= Schwarzkopf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combining fMRI with DCM on subjects performing a learning task allows one to delineate which brain systems are involved in various sorts of learning, whether implicit or explicit, and document for long these tasks lead to changes in resting-state brain activation.

===IQ estimation===
Voxel-based morphometric measurements of grey matter localization in the brain can be used to predict components of IQ. A set of 35 teenagers were tested for [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] and were fMRI scanned over the course of 3.5 years, and had their IQ predicted by the level of grey matter localization. This study was well-conducted, but studies of this sort frequently suffer from "double-dipping," where a single dataset is used both to identify the brain regions of interest ''and'' to develop a predictive model, which leads to overtraining of the model and an absence of real predictive power.&lt;ref name = "DD"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Price, CJ|year= 2013|title=Predicting IQ change from brain structure: a cross-validation study |journal=Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=5|pages=172–84 |pmid=23567505 |doi = 10.1016/j.dcn.2013.03.001 |first2 = S |last3= Hope|first3 = TM |last4= Friston|first4 = KJ |last5= Seghier|first5 = ML |pmc = 3682176 |issue = 100 |last2= Ramsden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study authors avoided double-dipping by using a "leave-one-out" methodology, that involves building a predictive model for each of the n members of a sample based on data from the other n-1 members. This ensures that the model is independent of the subject whose IQ is being predicted, and resulted in a model capable of explaining 53% of the change in verbal IQ as a function of grey matter density in the left motor cortex. The study also observed the previously-reported phenomenon that a ranking of young subjects by IQ does not stay constant as the subjects age, which confounds any measurement of the efficacy of educational programs.&lt;ref name = "DD" /&gt;

These studies can be cross-validated by attempting to locate and assess patients with lesions or other damage in the identified brain region, and examining whether they exhibit functional deficits relative to the population. This methodology would be hindered by the lack of a "before" baseline measurement, however.

===Phonological loop===
The [[Baddeley's model of working memory|phonological loop]] is a component of working memory that stores a small set of words that can be maintained indefinitely if not distracted. The concept was proposed by the psychologists Alan Baddeley and Graham Hitch to explain how phrases or sentences can be internalized and used to direct action.
By using statistical parametric mapping to assess differences in cerebral blood flow between participants performing two different tasks, Paulescu et al.&lt;ref name="Paulesu 1993"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paulesu E, Frith CD, Frackowiak RS |title=The neural correlates of the verbal component of working memory |journal=Nature |volume=362 |issue=6418 |pages=342–5 |date=March 1993 |pmid=8455719 |doi=10.1038/362342a0 |url=|last2=Frith |last3=Frackowiak |bibcode = 1993Natur.362..342P }}&lt;/ref&gt; were able to identify the storage of the phonological loop as in the [[Supramarginal gyrus|supramarginal gyrii]]. Human subjects were first split into a control and experimental group. The control group was presented with letters in a language they did not understand, and non-linguistic visual diagrams. The experimental group was tasked with two activities: the first activity was to remember a string of letters, and was intended activate all elements of the phonological loop. The second activity asked participants to assess whether given phrases rhymed, and was intended to only activate certain sub-systems involved in vocalization, but specifically not the phonological storage.

By comparing the first experimental task to the second, as well as to the control group, the study authors observed that the brain region most significantly activated by the task requiring phonological storage was the supramarginal gyrii. This result was backed up by previous literature observations of functional deficits in patients with damage in this area.

Though this study was able to precisely localize a specific function anatomically and the methods of functional integration and imaging are of great value in determining the brain regions involved in certain information processing tasks,  the low-level neural circuitry that gives rise to these phenomena remains mysterious.

===Psychiatric disorders===
Although fMRI studies of [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] and [[Bipolar disorder|bipolar]] patients have yielded some insight into the changes in effective connectivity caused by these diseases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Calhoun, V.|year= 2011|title=Exploring the psychosis functional connectome: aberrant intrinsic networks in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder |journal=Frontiers in Psychiatry |volume=2 |issue= 75|pmid=22291663 |first2 = J |last3= Kiehl|first3 = K |last4= Turner|first4 = J |last5= Allen|first5 = E |last6= Pearlson|first6 = G |page = 75 |doi = 10.3389/fpsyt.2011.00075 |pmc = 3254121 |last2= Sui}}&lt;/ref&gt; a comprehensive understanding of the functional remodelling that occurs has not yet been achieved.

Montague et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Montague, P.|year= 2012|title= Computational psychiatry|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=72–80 |pmid= 22177032 |doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2011.11.018 |first2 = RJ |last3= Friston|first3 = KJ |last4= Dayan|first4 = P |pmc = 3556822 |last2= Dolan}}&lt;/ref&gt; note that the almost "unreasonable effectiveness of psychotropic medication" has somewhat stymied progress in this field, and advocate for a large-scale "computational phenotyping" of psychiatric patients. Neuroimaging studies of large numbers of these patients could yield brain activation markers for specific psychiatric illnesses, and also aid in the development of therapeutics and animal models. While a true baseline of brain function in psychiatric patients is near-impossible to obtain, reference values can still be measured by comparing images gathered from patients before and after treatment.

In [[theoretical physics]], '''functional renormalization group''' ('''FRG''') is an implementation of the [[renormalization group]] (RG) concept which is used in quantum and statistical field theory, especially when dealing with strongly interacting systems. The method combines functional methods of [[quantum field theory]] with the intuitive renormalization group idea of [[Kenneth G. Wilson]]. This technique allows to interpolate smoothly between the known microscopic laws and the complicated macroscopic phenomena in physical systems. In this sense, it bridges the transition from simplicity of microphysics to complexity of macrophysics. Figuratively speaking, FRG acts as a microscope with a variable resolution. One starts with a high-resolution picture of the known microphysical laws and subsequently decreases the resolution to obtain a coarse-grained picture of macroscopic collective phenomena. The method is nonperturbative, meaning that it does not rely on an expansion in a small [[coupling constant]]. Mathematically, FRG is based on an exact functional differential equation for a scale-dependent [[effective action]].

==The flow equation for the effective action ==
In [[quantum field theory]], the [[effective action]] &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is an analogue of the [[classical physics|classical]] [[Action (physics)|action functional]] &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and depends on the fields of a given theory. It includes all quantum and thermal fluctuations. Variation of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; yields exact quantum field equations, for example for [[cosmology]] or the [[electrodynamics]] of superconductors. Mathematically, &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the generating functional of the one-particle irreducible [[Feynman diagram]]s. Interesting physics, as propagators and effective couplings for interactions, can be straightforwardly extracted from it. In a generic interacting field theory the effective action &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, however, is difficult to obtain. FRG provides a practical tool to calculate &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; employing the [[renormalization group]] concept.

The central object in FRG is a scale-dependent effective action functional &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{k}&lt;/math&gt; often called average action or flowing action. The dependence on the RG sliding scale &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is introduced by adding a [[Regularization (physics)|regulator]] (infrared cutoff) &lt;math&gt;R_{k}&lt;/math&gt; to the full inverse propagator &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^{(2)}_{k}&lt;/math&gt;. Roughly speaking, the regulator &lt;math&gt;R_k&lt;/math&gt; decouples slow modes with momenta &lt;math&gt;q\lesssim k&lt;/math&gt; by giving them a large mass, while high momentum modes are not affected. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{k}&lt;/math&gt; includes all quantum and statistical fluctuations with momenta &lt;math&gt;q\gtrsim k&lt;/math&gt;. The flowing action &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k&lt;/math&gt; obeys the exact functional flow equation

&lt;math&gt;\partial_k \Gamma_k = \frac{1}{2} \text{STr} \,
  \partial_k R_k \, (\Gamma^{(2)}_k + R_k)^{-1},&lt;/math&gt;

derived by [[Christof Wetterich]] and [[Tim R. Morris]] in 1993. Here &lt;math&gt;\partial_k&lt;/math&gt; denotes a derivative with respect to the RG scale &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; at fixed values of the fields.
The functional differential equation for &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{k}&lt;/math&gt; must be supplemented with the initial condition &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{k\to\Lambda}=S&lt;/math&gt;, where the "classical action" &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; describes the physics at the microscopic ultraviolet scale &lt;math&gt;k=\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;. Importantly, in the [[infrared limit]] &lt;math&gt;k\to 0&lt;/math&gt; the full [[effective action]] &lt;math&gt;\Gamma=\Gamma_{k\to 0}&lt;/math&gt; is obtained. In the Wetterich equation &lt;math&gt;\text{STr}&lt;/math&gt; denotes a supertrace which sums over momenta, frequencies, internal indices, and fields (taking bosons with a plus and fermions with a minus sign). The exact flow equation for &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k&lt;/math&gt; has a one-loop structure. This is an important simplification compared to [[perturbation theory]], where multi-loop diagrams must be included. The second functional derivative &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^{(2)}_{k}&lt;/math&gt; is the full inverse field propagator modified by the presence of the regulator &lt;math&gt;R_k&lt;/math&gt;.

The renormalization group evolution of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k&lt;/math&gt; can be illustrated in the theory space, which is a multi-dimensional space of all possible running couplings &lt;math&gt;\{c_{n} \}&lt;/math&gt; allowed by the symmetries of the problem. As schematically shown in the figure, at the microscopic ultraviolet scale &lt;math&gt;k=\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; one starts with the initial condition &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{k=\Lambda}=S&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:theoryspace.png|300px]]

As the sliding scale &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is lowered, the flowing action &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k&lt;/math&gt; evolves in the theory space according to the functional flow equation. The choice of the regulator &lt;math&gt;R_k&lt;/math&gt; is not unique, which introduces some scheme dependence into the [[renormalization group]] flow. For this reason, different choices of the regulator &lt;math&gt;R_k&lt;/math&gt; correspond to the different paths in the figure. At the infrared scale &lt;math&gt;k=0&lt;/math&gt;, however, the full effective action &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{k=0}=\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is recovered for every choice of the cut-off &lt;math&gt;R_k&lt;/math&gt;, and all trajectories meet at the same point in the theory space.

In most cases of interest the Wetterich equation can only be solved approximately. Usually some type of expansion of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{k}&lt;/math&gt; is performed, which is then truncated at finite order leading to a finite system of ordinary differential equations. Different systematic expansion schemes (such as the derivative expansion, vertex expansion, etc.) were developed. The choice of the suitable scheme should be physically motivated and depends on a given problem. The expansions do not necessarily involve a small parameter (like an interaction [[coupling constant]]) and thus they are, in general, of nonperturbative nature.

==Aspects of functional renormalization==

* The Wetterich flow equation is an exact equation. However, in practice, the functional differential equation must be truncated, i.e. it must be projected to functions of a few variables or even onto some finite-dimensional sub-theory space. As in every nonperturbative method, the question of error estimate is nontrivial in functional renormalization. One way to estimate the error in FRG is to improve the truncation in successive steps, i.e. to enlarge the sub-theory space by including more and more running couplings. The difference in the flows for different truncations gives a good estimate of the error. Alternatively, one can use different regulator functions &lt;math&gt;R_k&lt;/math&gt; in a given (fixed) truncation and determine the difference of the RG flows in the infrared for the respective regulator choices. If bosonization is used, one can check the insensitivity of final results with respect to different bosonization procedures.
* In FRG, as in all RG methods, a lot of insight about a physical system can be gained from the topology of RG flows. Specifically, identification of [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]] of the renormalization group evolution is of great importance. Near fixed points the flow of running couplings effectively stops and RG &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-functions approach zero. The presence of (partially) stable infrared fixed points is closely connected to the concept of [[universality (dynamical systems)|universality]]. Universality manifests itself in the observation that some very distinct physical systems have the same critical behavior. For instance, to good accuracy, [[critical exponents]] of the liquid–gas phase transition in water and the ferromagnetic phase transition in magnets are the same. In the renormalization group language, different systems from the same universality class flow to the same (partially) stable infrared fixed point. In this way macrophysics becomes independent of the microscopic details of the particular physical model.
* Compared to the [[perturbation theory]], functional renormalization does not make a strict distinction between renormalizable and nonrenormalizable couplings. All running couplings that are allowed by symmetries of the problem are generated during the FRG flow. However, the nonrenormalizable couplings approach partial fixed points very quickly during the evolution towards the infrared, and thus the flow effectively collapses on a hypersurface of the dimension given by the number of renormalizable couplings. Taking the nonrenormalizable couplings into account allows to study nonuniversal features that are sensitive to the concrete choice of the microscopic action &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and the finite ultraviolet cutoff &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;.
* The Wetterich equation can be obtained from the [[Legendre transformation]] of the Polchinski functional equation, derived by Joseph Polchinski in 1984. The concept of the effective average action, used in FRG, is, however, more intuitive than the flowing bare action in the Polchinski equation. In addition, the FRG method proved to be more suitable for practical calculations.
* Typically, low-energy physics of strongly interacting systems is described by macroscopic degrees of freedom (i.e. particle excitations) which are very different from microscopic high-energy degrees of freedom. For instance, [[quantum chromodynamics]] is a field theory of interacting quarks and gluons. At low energies, however, proper degrees of freedom are baryons and mesons. Another example is the BEC/BCS crossover problem in [[condensed matter physics]]. While the microscopic theory is defined in terms of two-component nonrelativistic fermions, at low energies a composite (particle-particle) dimer becomes an additional degree of freedom, and it is advisable to include it explicitly in the model. The low-energy composite degrees of freedom can be introduced in the description by the method of partial bosonization ([[Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation]]). This transformation, however, is done once and for all at the UV scale &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;. In FRG a more efficient way to incorporate macroscopic degrees of freedom was introduced, which is known as flowing bosonization or rebosonization. With the help of a scale-dependent field transformation, this allows to perform the [[Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation]] continuously at all RG scales &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.

==Functional renormalization-group for Wick-ordered effective interaction==
Contrary to the flow equation for the effective action, this scheme is formulated for the [[effective interaction]]

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}[\eta ,\eta ^{+}] =-\ln Z[G_{0}^{-1} \eta , G_{0}^{-1}\eta ^{+}]-\eta G_{0}^{-1}\eta ^{+}&lt;/math&gt;

which generates n-particle interaction vertices, amputated by the bare propagators &lt;math&gt;G_{0}&lt;/math&gt;;
&lt;math&gt;Z[\eta ,\eta ^{+}]&lt;/math&gt; is the "standard" generating functional for the n-particle Green functions.

The Wick ordering of effective interaction with respect to Green function &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; can be defined by

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W}[\eta ,\eta ^{+}]=\exp(-\Delta _D)\mathcal{V}[\eta ,\eta ^{+}]&lt;/math&gt;.

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta=D \delta^2 /(\delta \eta \delta \eta^ {+})&lt;/math&gt; is the Laplacian in the field space. This operation is similar to [[Normal order]] and excludes from the interaction all possible terms, formed by a convolution of source fields with respective Green function D. Introducing some cutoff &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; the Polchinskii equation

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial }{{\partial \Lambda }}{{V}_\Lambda }(\psi ) = -{\dot \Delta _{{G_{0,\Lambda }}}}{{V}_\Lambda }(\psi ) + \Delta _{{{\dot G}_{0,\Lambda }}}^{12}\mathcal {V}_\Lambda ^{(1)}\mathcal {V}_\Lambda ^{(2)}&lt;/math&gt;

takes the form of the Wick-ordered equation

&lt;math&gt;{\partial _\Lambda }{\mathcal {W}_\Lambda } = -{\Delta _{{{\dot D}_\Lambda } + {{\dot G}_{0,\Lambda }}}}{\mathcal { W}_\Lambda } + {e^{-\Delta _{{D_\Lambda }}^{12}}}\Delta _{{{\dot G}_{0,\Lambda }}}^{12}\mathcal {W}_\Lambda ^{(1)}\mathcal {W}_\Lambda ^{(2)}&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;\Delta _{{{\dot G}_{0,\Lambda }}}^{12}\mathcal {V}_\Lambda ^{(1)}\mathcal {V}_\Lambda ^{(2)}=\frac{1}{2}\left( {\frac{{\delta {{V}_\Lambda }(\psi )}}{{\delta \psi }},{{\dot G}_{0,\Lambda }}\frac{{\delta {{V}_\Lambda }(\psi )}}{{\delta \psi }}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==

The method was applied to numerous problems in physics, e.g.: 
* In [[statistical field theory]], FRG provided a unified picture of [[phase transitions]] in classical linear &lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt;-symmetric scalar theories in different dimensions &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, including critical exponents for &lt;math&gt;d=3&lt;/math&gt; and the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition for &lt;math&gt;d=2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;N=2&lt;/math&gt;.
* In gauge quantum field theory, FRG was used, for instance, to investigate the chiral phase transition and infrared properties of QCD and its large-flavor extensions.
* In [[condensed matter physics]], the method proved to be successful to treat lattice models (e.g. the [[Hubbard model]] or frustrated magnetic systems), repulsive Bose gas, BEC/BCS crossover for two-component Fermi gas, [[Kondo effect]], disordered systems and nonequlibrium phenomena.
* Application of FRG to gravity provided arguments in favor of nonperturbative renormalizability of [[quantum gravity]] in four spacetime dimensions, known as the [[asymptotic safety]] scenario.
* In mathematical physics FRG was used to prove renormalizability of different field theories.

==A==
*'''[[Abrasion (mechanical)|Abrasion]]''' – is the process of scuffing, scratching, wearing down, marring, or rubbing away.  It can be intentionally imposed in a controlled process using an abrasive. Abrasion can be an undesirable effect of exposure to normal use or exposure to the elements. 
*'''[[Accelerated life testing]]''' – is the process of testing a product by subjecting it to conditions ([[Stress (mechanics)|stress]], [[Strain (mechanics)|strain]], temperatures, voltage, vibration rate, pressure etc.) in excess of its normal service parameters in an effort to uncover faults and potential modes of failure in a short amount of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nelson | first1 = W. | doi = 10.1109/TR.1980.5220742 | title = Accelerated Life Testing - Step-Stress Models and Data Analyses | journal = IEEE Transactions on Reliability | issue = 2 | page = 103 | year = 1980 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Spencer | first1 = F.

*'''[[Acceleration]]''' – In [[physics]], '''acceleration''' is the [[Rate (mathematics)|rate]] of change of [[velocity]] of an object with respect to time. An object's acceleration is the net result of any and all [[force]]s acting on the object, as described by [[Newton's Second Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Principles of Mechanics |first=Henry |last=Crew |publisher=BiblioBazaar, LLC |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-559-36871-4 |pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit for acceleration is [[metre per second squared]] {{nowrap|(m s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;).}} Accelerations are [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantities (they have [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] and [[Direction (geometry)|direction]]) and add according to the [[parallelogram law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Relativity and Common Sense |first=Hermann |last=Bondi |pages=3 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-486-24021-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Physics the Easy Way |pages=27 |first=Robert L. |last=Lehrman |publisher=Barron's Educational Series |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-7641-0236-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a [[Vector space|vector]], the calculated net [[force]] is equal to the product of the object's mass (a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity) and its acceleration.
*'''[[Accelerometer]]''' – is a device that measures [[proper acceleration]].&lt;ref name="Tinder"&gt;{{cite book |title=Relativistic Flight Mechanics and Space Travel: A Primer for Students, Engineers and Scientists |first1=Richard F. |last1=Tinder |publisher=Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-59829-130-8 |page=33 |url=}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=-uMRwLaNbC8C&amp;pg=PA33 Extract of page 33]&lt;/ref&gt; Proper acceleration, being the [[acceleration]] (or [[rate of change (mathematics)|rate of change]] of [[velocity]]) of a body in its own instantaneous [[rest frame]],&lt;ref name="Rindler"&gt;{{cite book |title=Essential Relativity: Special, General, and Cosmological |edition=illustrated |first1=W. |last1=Rindler |publisher=Springer |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-4757-1135-6 |page=61 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WTfnBwAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=WTfnBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61 Extract of page 61]&lt;/ref&gt; is not the same as coordinate acceleration, being the acceleration in a fixed [[coordinate system]]. 
*'''[[Accuracy and precision]]''' –
*'''[[Ackermann steering geometry]]''' – is a geometric arrangement of linkages in the [[steering]] of a [[automobile|car]] or other [[vehicle]] designed to solve the problem of wheels on the inside and outside of a turn needing to trace out [[circles]] of different [[radius|radii]]. It was invented by the German carriage builder [[Georg Lankensperger]] in Munich in 1817, then patented by his agent in England, [[Rudolph Ackermann]] (1764–1834) in 1818 for horse-drawn carriages. [[Erasmus Darwin]] may have a prior claim as the inventor dating from 1758.&lt;ref &gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/532121 Erasmus Darwin's Improved Design for Steering Carriages] by Desmond King-Hele , 2002, The Royal Society, London. Accessed April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Acoustic droplet ejection]]'''– (ADE) uses a pulse of ultrasound to move low volumes of fluids (typically nanoliters or picoliters) without any physical contact.  This technology focuses acoustic energy into a fluid sample in order to eject droplets as small as a [[Litre|picoliter]].  ADE technology is a very gentle process. This feature makes the technology suitable for a wide variety of applications including [[proteomics]] and cell-based assays.
*'''[[Active cooling]]''' – An '''active cooling''' system is one that involves the use of energy to cool something, as opposed to [[passive cooling]] that uses no energy.  Such systems circulate a [[coolant]] to [[Heat transfer|transfer heat]] from one place to another. The coolant is either a gas, such as in [[air cooling]] of [[Computer cooling|computers]], or a liquid such as in a  [[Radiator (engine cooling)|car engine]]. In the latter case, liquid is pumped to transfer heat from the engine to the radiator, which in turn is cooled by passing air over it.  Other active cooling systems make use of a [[Heat pump and refrigeration cycle|refrigeration cycle]]. 
*'''[[Actual mechanical advantage]]''' – The '''actual mechanical advantage''' (AMA) is the mechanical advantage determined by physical measurement of the input and output forces. Actual mechanical advantage takes into account energy loss due to deflection, friction, and wear.
*'''[[Adjoint equation]]''' – is a [[linear differential equation]], usually derived from its primal equation using [[integration by parts]].  Gradient values with respect to a particular quantity of interest can be efficiently calculated by solving the adjoint equation. Methods based on solution of adjoint equations are used in [[wing shape optimization]], fluid flow control and [[uncertainty quantification]]. For example &lt;math&gt; dX_t = a(X_t)dt + b(X_t)dW&lt;/math&gt; this is an [[Itō calculus|Itō]] stochastic differential equation. Now by using Euler scheme, we integrate the parts of this equation and get another equation, &lt;math&gt; X_{n+1} = X_n  +  a \Delta t + \zeta b \sqrt{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;, here &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; is a random variable, later one is an adjoint equation.
*'''[[Aerodynamics]]''' – is the study of the motion of [[air]], particularly its interaction with a solid object, such as an [[airplane]] wing. It is a sub-field of [[fluid dynamics]] and [[gas dynamics]], and many aspects of aerodynamics theory are common to these fields.
*'''[[Agitator (device)]]''' –
*'''[[Air handler]]''' – An '''air handler''', or '''air handling unit''' (often abbreviated to '''AHU'''), is a device used to regulate and circulate air as part of a heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning ([[HVAC]]) system.&lt;ref name=ASHRAE&gt;{{cite book|title=2008 ASHRAE handbook : heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems and equipment|year=2008|publisher=ASHRAE American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers|location=Atlanta, Ga.|isbn=9781933742335|edition=Inch-Pound}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Air compressor]]''' –  is a device that [[energy conversion|converts power]] (using an electric motor, diesel or gasoline engine, etc.) into [[potential energy]] stored in pressurized air (i.e., [[compressed air]]). By one of several methods, an air compressor forces more and more air into a storage tank, increasing the pressure. When tank pressure reaches its engineered upper limit the air compressor shuts off. The compressed air, then, is held in the tank until called into use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/how-to/a151/how-air-compressors-work/|title=How Do Air Compressors Work?|date=2015-03-18|newspaper=Popular Mechanics|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''[[Air conditioner]]''' – '''Air conditioning''' (often referred to as '''AC''', '''A/C''', or '''air con''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/air-con|title=air con Definition in the Cambridge English Dictionary |website=dictionary.cambridge.org |accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the process of removing heat and moisture from the interior of an occupied space, to improve the comfort of occupants.  Air conditioning can be used in both domestic and commercial environments.
*'''[[Air preheater]]''' – (APH) is any device designed to heat [[air]] before another process (for example,  [[combustion]] in a [[boiler]]) with the primary objective of increasing the thermal efficiency of the process. They may be used alone or to replace a [[recuperator|recuperative]] heat system or to replace a steam coil.
*'''[[Airflow]]''' –  '''Airflow,''' or '''air flow''' is the movement of air from one area to another. The primary cause of airflow is the existence of [[pressure gradient]]s. Air behaves in a [[fluid]] manner, meaning particles naturally flow from areas of higher pressure to those where the pressure is lower. [[Atmospheric pressure|Atmospheric air pressure]] is directly related to altitude, temperature, and composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/winds-and-the-pressure-gradient-force-1434440|title=How Do Air Pressure Differences Cause Winds?|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;ASHRAE, ed. ''ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals 2017''. Atlanta, GA: American Society of Heating, Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Engineers, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[engineering]], airflow is a measurement of the amount of [[air]] per unit of time that flows through a particular device.
*'''[[Allowance (engineering)|Allowance]]''' – is a planned deviation between an exact dimension and a [[Real versus nominal value|nominal]] or [[theoretical]] dimension, or between an intermediate-stage dimension and an intended final dimension. The unifying abstract concept is that a certain amount of difference ''allows for'' some known factor of compensation or interference. For example, an area of excess metal may be left because it is needed to complete subsequent machining. Common cases are listed below. An ''allowance,'' which is a ''planned'' deviation from an ideal, is contrasted with a ''[[Engineering tolerance|tolerance]],'' which accounts for expected but unplanned deviations.
*'''[[American Machinists' Handbook]]''' –
*'''[[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]]''' – The '''American Society of Mechanical Engineers''' ('''ASME''') is a [[professional association]] that, in its own words, "promotes the art, science, and practice of multidisciplinary engineering and allied sciences around the globe" via "[[continuing education]], training and [[professional development]], codes and [[technical standard|standards]], [[research]], conferences and publications, government relations, and other forms of outreach."&lt;ref name="ASME_dot_org_slash_about-asme"&gt;{{Cite web |author=ASME|title=ASME.org &gt; About ASME |url=http://www.asme.org/about-asme |accessdate=2011-12-27 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''[[Ampere]]''' – is the [[SI base unit|base unit]] of [[electric current]] in the  [[International System of Units]] (SI).&lt;ref name="BIPMdefinition"&gt;{{Citation|chapter= 2.1.

Retrieved on 2010-09-28.&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after [[André-Marie Ampère]] (1775–1836), French mathematician and physicist, considered the father of [[electrodynamics]].
*'''[[Applied mechanics]]''' –  describes the behavior of a body, in either a beginning state of rest or of motion, subjected to the action of forces.&lt;ref&gt;''Engineering Mechanics (statics and dynamics)'' - Dr.N.Kottiswaran {{ISBN|978-81-908993-3-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applied mechanics, bridges the gap between physical theory and its application to [[technology]].  It is used in many fields of [[engineering]], especially [[mechanical engineering]] and [[civil engineering]]. In this context, it is commonly referred to as '''Engineering Mechanics'''.
*'''[[Archimedes' screw]]''' – also known by the name the '''Archimedean screw''' or '''screw pump''', is a [[machine]] used for [[pump|transferring water]] from a low-lying body of water into [[irrigation]] ditches. Water is pumped by turning a screw-shaped surface inside a pipe.  The [[screw pump]] is commonly attributed to [[Archimedes]],&lt;ref name="Oleson 2000 242–251"&gt;{{harvnb|Oleson|2000|pp=242–251}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''[[Artificial intelligence]]''' – ('''AI'''), sometimes called '''[[machine]] intelligence''', is [[intelligence]] demonstrated by [[machine]]s, in contrast to the '''[[natural]] intelligence'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; displayed by humans and other animals.  In [[computer science]]  AI research is defined as the study of "[[intelligent agent]]s": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.&lt;ref name="Definition of AI"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clocks like these were built from the 1st century BC through to [[Victorian era|Victorian]] times in [[Europe]]. A [[Cuckoo clock]] is a simple form of this type of clock.
*'''[[Automobile]]''' – is a wheeled [[motor vehicle]] used for [[transportation]].  Most definitions of ''car'' say they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four [[tyre (wheel)|tires]], and mainly transport people rather than goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pocket Oxford Dictionary |year=1976 |publisher=Oxford University Press  |isbn=978-0198611134 |editor-last=Fowler |editor-first=H.W. |editor-last2=Fowler |editor-first2=F.G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OEDmotrcar"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/122742#eid35698343 | title=motor car, n. | publisher=Oxford University Press | work=OED Online | date=September 2014 | accessdate=2014-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Automotive engineering]]''' – '''Automotive engineering''', along with [[aerospace engineering]] and [[Naval architecture|marine engineering]], is a branch of [[vehicle engineering]], incorporating elements of [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[Electrical engineering|electrical]], [[Electronic engineering|electronic]], [[Software engineering|software]] and [[safety engineering]] as applied to the design, manufacture and operation of [[motorcycles]], [[automobile]]s and [[truck]]s and their respective engineering subsystems. It also includes modification of vehicles. Manufacturing domain deals with the creation and assembling the whole parts of automobiles is also included in it.The automotive engineering field is research -intensive and involves direct application of mathematical models and formulas. The study of automotive engineering is to design, develop, fabricate, and testing vehicles or vehicle components from the concept stage to production stage. Production, development, and manufacturing are the three major functions in this field.
*'''[[Axle]]''' – is a central shaft for a [[rotation|rotating]] wheel or gear. On wheeled vehicles, the axle may be fixed to the wheels, rotating with them, or fixed to the vehicle, with the wheels rotating around the axle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mechanical Engineering design|date=2010|publisher=McGraw Hill|isbn=0073529281|pages=360|edition=9th|url=https://www.bookdepository.com/Shigleys-Mechanical-Engineering-Design-Richard-G-Budynas/9780073529288}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the former case, [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]] or [[Bushing (bearing)|bushings]] are provided at the mounting points where the axle is supported.  In the latter case, a bearing or bushing sits inside a central hole in the wheel to allow the wheel or gear to rotate around the axle.  Sometimes, especially on bicycles, the latter type axle is referred to as a ''[[spindle (tool)|spindle]]''.

==B==
*'''[[Babbitt (alloy)|Babbitt]]''' – also called '''Babbitt metal''' or '''bearing metal''', is any of several [[alloy]]s used for the [[bearing surface]] in a [[plain bearing]]. The original Babbitt alloy was invented in 1839 by [[Isaac Babbitt]]&lt;ref&gt;{{The Timetables of Science|pages=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Taunton, Massachusetts|Taunton]], [[Massachusetts]], United States.
*'''[[Backdrive]]''' – is a component used in reverse to obtain its input from its output. This extends to many concepts and systems from thought based to practical mechanical applications.
*'''[[Backlash (gear)|Backlash]]''' –  sometimes called '''lash''' or '''play''', is a clearance or lost motion in a mechanism caused by gaps between the parts. It can be defined as "the maximum distance or angle through which any part of a [[mechanical system]] may be moved in one direction without applying appreciable force or motion to the next part in mechanical sequence",&lt;ref name=bag09&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bagad|first1=V.S.|title=Mechatronics|date=2009|publisher=Technical Publications|location=Pune|isbn=9788184314908|edition=4th revised|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NCEeONKWzX4C&amp;pg=SA1-PA8&amp;dq=backlash|accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p. 1-8&lt;!--section 1 page 8--&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
*'''[[Balancing machine]]''' – is a measuring tool used for balancing rotating machine parts such as rotors for [[electric motor]]s, [[Fan (mechanical)|fans]], [[turbine]]s, [[disc brake]]s, [[disk storage|disc drives]], [[propeller]]s and [[pump]]s. 
*'''[[Ball detent]]''' – is a simple mechanical arrangement used to hold a moving part in a temporarily fixed position relative to another part. Usually the moving parts slide with respect to each other, or one part rotates within the other.
*'''[[Ball screw]]''' – is a mechanical [[linear actuator]] that translates rotational motion to linear motion with little [[friction]].  A threaded shaft provides a helical raceway for [[ball bearing]]s which act as a precision screw. As well as being able to apply or withstand high thrust loads, they can do so with minimum internal friction. 
*'''[[Ball spline]]''' – '''Ball splines''' (Ball Spline [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s) are a special type of [[linear motion bearing]] that are used to provide nearly frictionless linear motion while allowing the member to transmit torque simultaneously. There are [[Groove (engineering)|grooves]] ground along the length of the shaft (thus forming [[Rotating spline|splines]]) for the recirculating ground balls to run inside. The outer shell that houses the balls is called a nut rather than a [[Bushing (bearing)|bushing]], but is not a nut in the traditional sense—it is not free to rotate about the shaft, but is free to travel up and down the shaft. 
*'''[[Beale Number]]''' – is a parameter that characterizes the performance of [[Stirling engine]]s.  It is often used to estimate the power output of a Stirling engine design.  For engines operating with a high temperature differential, typical values for the Beale number range from ( 0.11 ) to ( 0.15 ); where a larger number indicates higher performance.
*'''[[Bearing (mechanical)|Bearing]]''' – is a [[machine element]] that constrains relative motion to only the desired motion, and reduces [[friction]] between [[moving parts]].
*'''[[Bearing pressure]]''' – is a particular case of [[contact mechanics]] often occurring in cases where a convex surface (male cylinder or sphere) contacts a concave surface (female cylinder or sphere: [[Boring (manufacturing)|bore]] or [[Spherical bearing|hemispherical cup]]). Excessive contact pressure can lead to a typical bearing failure such as a plastic deformation similar to [[peening]]. This problem is also referred to as '''bearing resistance'''.&lt;ref name="Eurocode3"&gt;EN 1993-1-8:2005 ''[[Eurocode 3]]: Design of steel structures - Part 1-8: Design of joints''&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Bearing surface]]''' – is the [[area]] of contact between two objects. It usually is used in reference to [[bolted joint]]s and [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], but can be applied to a wide variety of engineering applications. On a [[screw]] the bearing area loosely refers to the underside of the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1990|p=38}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Strictly speaking, the bearing area refers to the area of the screw head that directly bears on the part being fastened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Fastener terms | url = http://www.canadianstainless.ca/page9.html | accessdate = 2009-06-29}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For a cylindrical bearing it is the [[projected area]] perpendicular to the applied force.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Low|Bevis|1908|p=115}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  On a [[spring (device)|spring]] the bearing area refers to the amount of area on the top or bottom surface of the spring in contact with the constraining part.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Helical Compression Spring Terminology | url = http://www.masterspring.com/technical_resources/helical_compression_spring_terminology/default.html | accessdate = 2009-06-29}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ways of [[machine tool]]s, such as dovetail slides, box ways, prismatic ways, and other types of machine slides are also bearing surfaces. 
*'''[[Belt (mechanical) |Belt]]''' –  is a loop of flexible material used to link two or more rotating [[Drive shaft|shafts]] mechanically, most often parallel. Belts may be used as a source of motion, to [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmit power]] efficiently or to track relative movement. Belts are looped over [[pulley]]s and may have a twist between the pulleys, and the shafts need not be parallel.
*'''[[Belt friction]]''' –  is a term describing the friction forces between a [[Belt (mechanical)|belt]] and a surface, such as a belt wrapped around a [[bollard]]. When one end of the belt is being pulled only part of this force is transmitted to the other end wrapped about a surface. The friction force increases with the amount of wrap about a surface and makes it so the [[tension (physics)|tension]] in the belt can be different at both ends of the belt. Belt friction can be modeled by the [[Capstan equation|Belt friction equation]].&lt;ref name=Attaway&gt;{{cite conference | last = Attaway | first = Stephen W. | title = The Mechanics of Friction in Rope Rescue | url = http://www.jrre.org/att_frict.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = February 1, 2010 | conference = International Technical Rescue Symposium | year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pioneer Helmet.jpg|thumb|alt=Colour photograph of the Pioneer Helmet|The 100–200 fragments of the [[Pioneer Helmet|Pioneer helmet]] were adhered using HMG.]]
'''HMG Heat and Waterproof Adhesive''' (also known as '''HMG''' or '''HMG adhesive''') is a brand of [[Nitrocellulose|cellulose nitrate]] adhesive manufactured by H Marcel Guest Ltd. It is one of the most popular cellulose nitrate adhesives used in [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation and restoration]] work, and is used on materials such as metal, wood, glass, and pottery.{{sfn|Shashoua|Bradley|Daniels|1992|p=114}}{{sfn|HMG product page}}{{sfn|MFA CAMEO|2016}} It is sometimes referred to as "the blue tube", in contrast to "the purple tube", the acrylic B72 Restoration Adhesive also manufactured by the company.{{sfn|HMG Adhesives|2011}}

HMG was invented during [[World War II]] by the company's founder, Herbert Falder.{{sfn|HMG Adhesives|2011}} Today it is broadly used, including by the [[British Museum]] and the [[York Archaeological Trust]]. In 1997, HMG was used to adhere pieces of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[Pioneer Helmet|Pioneer helmet]], which was found broken into between 100 and 200 fragments.{{sfn|Meadows|2004|pp=24–27}}{{sfn|Read|2006|pp=39–42}} Particularly fragile areas had their cracks injected with a solution of HMG diluted 50% with [[acetone]], to consolidate them and prevent them from collapsing; holes made while cleaning away corrosion were likewise injected with pigmented HMG.{{sfn|Meadows|2004|pp=25–26}}{{sfn|Read|2006|p=40}} Stronger areas, such as the [[Dexter and sinister|sinister]] cheek guard, found in eighteen pieces, and the [[nasal helmet|nasal]], were joined directly with the adhesive.{{sfn|Meadows|2004|pp=24–25}} Finally, HMG was also used to adhere glass fibre matting on the inside of the helmet, strengthening weak joins and covering gaps, the latter to provide backing against which gapfill could be applied.{{sfn|Meadows|2004|pp=27}}{{sfn|Read|2006|p=42}}

==Technical properties==
HMG is advertised with a {{convert|-18|C|F|abbr=on}} [[flash point]], and a {{convert|100|C|F|abbr=on}} temperature resistance.{{sfn|HMG product page}} It is insoluble in water and soluble in acetone, and is composed of 70% amyl acetate solvent, 25% cellulose nitrate, approximately 5% of the plasticizer dibutyl phthalate,{{sfn|Shashoua|Bradley|Daniels|1992|p=115}} and a small amount of a phenolic resin leveling agent.{{sfn|MFA CAMEO|2016}} The adhesive is touch dry in five minutes, and hard dry in ten.{{sfn|HMG Adhesives|2011}}

'''Hepatotoxicity''' (from ''hepatic toxicity'') implies chemical-driven [[liver]] damage. '''Drug-induced liver injury''' is a cause of acute and chronic liver disease.

The liver plays a central role in transforming and clearing chemicals and is susceptible to the toxicity from these agents. Certain medicinal agents, when taken in overdoses and sometimes even when introduced within [[Therapeutic index|therapeutic ranges]], may injure the organ. Other chemical agents, such as those used in laboratories and industries, natural chemicals (e.g., [[microcystin]]s) and [[Herbalism|herbal remedies]] can also induce hepatotoxicity. Chemicals that cause liver injury are called [[hepatotoxin]]s.

More than 900 drugs have been implicated in causing liver injury&lt;ref name="isbn0-8385-1551-7"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Friedman, Scott E. |author2=Grendell, James H. |author3=McQuaid, Kenneth R. |title=Current diagnosis &amp; treatment in gastroenterology |publisher=Lang Medical Books/McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2003 |pages=664–679 |isbn=0-8385-1551-7 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see LiverTox, external link, below) and it is the most common reason for a drug to be withdrawn from the market. Hepatotoxicity and drug-induced liver injury also account for a substantial number of compound failures, highlighting the need for drug screening assays, such as [[stem cell]]-derived hepatocyte-like cells, that are capable of detecting toxicity early in the drug development process.&lt;ref name="stem2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Greenhough S, Hay DC |title=Stem Cell-Based Toxicity Screening: Recent Advances in Hepatocyte Generation |journal=Pharm Med |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=85–89 |year=2012 |doi=10.1007/BF03256896}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemicals often cause [[subclinical]] injury to the liver, which manifests only as abnormal [[Liver function tests|liver enzyme tests]].

Drug-induced liver injury is responsible for 5% of all hospital admissions and 50% of all [[acute liver failure]]s.&lt;ref name="isbn1-56053-618-7"&gt;{{cite book |author=McNally, Peter F. |title=GI/Liver Secrets: with STUDENT CONSULT Access |publisher=C.V.

== Cause ==
[[Image:Drug-induced hepatitis low mag.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Drug-induced hepatitis with [[granulomata]]. Other causes were excluded with extensive investigations. [[Liver]] [[biopsy]]. [[H&amp;E stain]].]]
[[Adverse drug reaction]]s are classified as type A (intrinsic or pharmacological) or type B (idiosyncratic).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Davies, D. |title=Textbook of adverse drug reactions |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1985 |pages= 18–45|isbn=0-19-261479-7 |oclc=12558288 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Type A drug reaction accounts for 80% of all toxicities.&lt;ref name="pmid9554902"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pirmohamed M, Breckenridge AM, Kitteringham NR, Park BK |title=Adverse drug reactions |journal=BMJ |volume=316 |issue=7140 |pages=1295–8 |year=1998 |pmid=9554902 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.316.7140.1295|pmc=1113033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Drugs]] or toxins that have a pharmacological (type A) hepatotoxicity are those that have ''predictable'' [[dose-response curve]]s (higher concentrations cause more liver damage) and well characterized mechanisms of toxicity, such as directly damaging liver tissue or blocking a metabolic process. As in the case of [[acetaminophen]] overdose, this type of injury occurs shortly after some threshold for toxicity is reached.

[[Idiosyncratic drug reaction|Idiosyncratic]] (type B) injury occurs without warning, when agents cause ''non-predictable'' hepatotoxicity in susceptible individuals, which is not related to dose and has a variable latency period.&lt;ref name="pmid352664"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zimmerman HJ |title=Drug-induced liver disease |journal=Drugs |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=25–45 |year=1978 |pmid=352664|doi=10.2165/00003495-197816010-00002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of injury does not have a clear dose-response nor temporal relationship, and most often does not have predictive models. Idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity has led to the withdrawal of several drugs from market even after rigorous clinical testing as part of the FDA approval process; [[Troglitazone]] (Rezulin) and [[trovafloxacin]] (Trovan) are two prime examples of idiosyncratic hepatotoxins pulled from market.

Oral use of ketoconazole has been associated with hepatic toxicity, including some fatalities;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ketoconazole Tablets|url=https://www.drugs.com/pro/ketoconazole-tablets.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, such effects appear to be limited to doses taken over a period longer than 7 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Banankhah|first=Peymaan S.|last2=Garnick|first2=Kyle A.|last3=Greenblatt|first3=David J.|date=2016-02-01|title=Ketoconazole-Associated Liver Injury in Drug-Drug Interaction Studies in Healthy Volunteers|journal=Journal of Clinical Pharmacology|doi=10.1002/jcph.711|issn=1552-4604|pmid=26829173|volume=56|pages=1196–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acetaminophen (Paracetamol)===
{{Main article|Acetaminophen toxicity}}

[[Image:Paracetamol-rod-povray.png|thumb|Acetaminophen (3D structure) overdose is the most common cause of drug-induced liver disease]]
[[Acetaminophen]] (in the US and Japan), paracetamol (INN), also known by the brand name Tylenol and Panadol, is usually well tolerated in prescribed dose, but overdose is the most common cause of drug-induced liver disease and [[acute liver failure]] worldwide.&lt;ref name="isbn0-443-06633-7"/&gt;  Damage to the liver is not due to the drug itself but to a toxic metabolite (''N''-acetyl-''p''-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI)) produced by cytochrome P-450 enzymes in the liver.&lt;ref name="pmid15345657"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wallace JL |title=Acetaminophen hepatotoxicity: NO to the rescue |journal=Br. J. Pharmacol. |volume=143 |issue=1 |pages=1–2 |year=2004 |pmid=15345657 |doi=10.1038/sj.bjp.0705781 |pmc=1575258}}&lt;/ref&gt; In normal circumstances, this metabolite is detoxified by conjugating with [[glutathione]] in phase 2 reaction. In an overdose, a large amount of NAPQI is generated, which overwhelms the detoxification process and leads to liver cell damage.   [[Nitric oxide]] also plays a role in inducing toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=James LP, Mayeux PR, Hinson JA |title=Acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity |journal=Drug Metab. Dispos. |volume=31 |issue=12 |pages=1499–506 |year=2003 |pmid=14625346 |doi=10.1124/dmd.31.12.1499}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of liver injury is influenced by several factors including the dose ingested, concurrent alcohol or other drug intake, interval between ingestion and antidote, etc. The dose toxic to the liver is quite variable from person to person and is often thought to be lower in chronic alcoholics.&lt;ref name="pmid12006215"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Riordan SM, Williams R |title=Alcohol exposure and paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity |journal=Addict Biol |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=191–206 |year=2002 |pmid=12006215 |doi=10.1080/13556210220120424 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Prescott |first1=Laurie F. |title=Paracetamol, alcohol and the liver |journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=291–301 |year=2000 |pmid=10759684 |pmc=2014937 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2125.2000.00167.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurement of blood level is important in assessing prognosis, higher levels predicting a worse prognosis. Administration of [[Acetylcysteine]], a precursor of glutathione, can limit the severity of the liver damage by capturing the toxic NAPQI. Those that develop [[acute liver failure]] can still recover spontaneously,  but may require transplantation if poor [[prognostic]] signs such as [[encephalopathy]] or [[coagulopathy]] is present (see [[King's College Criteria]]).

=== Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ===
Although individual analgesics rarely induce liver damage due to their widespread use, NSAIDs have emerged as a major group of drugs exhibiting hepatotoxicity. Both dose-dependent and idiosyncratic reactions have been documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Manov I, Motanis H, Frumin I, Iancu TC |title=Hepatotoxicity of anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs: ultrastructural aspects |journal=Acta Pharmacol. Sin. |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=259–72 |year=2006 |pmid=16490160|doi=10.1111/j.1745-7254.2006.00278.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspirin and [[phenylbutazone]] are associated with intrinsic hepatotoxicity; idiosyncratic reaction has been associated with ibuprofen, sulindac,  phenylbutazone, piroxicam, diclofenac and indomethacin.

=== Glucocorticoids ===
Glucocorticoids are so named due to their effect on the carbohydrate mechanism. They promote glycogen storage in the liver. An enlarged liver is a rare side-effect of long-term steroid use in children.&lt;ref name="pmid3944744"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Iancu TC, Shiloh H, Dembo L |title=Hepatomegaly following short-term high-dose steroid therapy |journal=J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=41–6 |year=1986 |pmid=3944744 |doi=10.1097/00005176-198601000-00008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classical effect of prolonged use both in adult and [[paediatric]] population is [[steatosis]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Isoniazid ===
Isoniazide (INH) is one of the most commonly used drugs for tuberculosis; it is associated with mild elevation of liver enzymes in up to 20% of patients and severe hepatotoxicity in 1-2% of patients.&lt;ref name="pmid10215642"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sarich TC, Adams SP, Petricca G, Wright JM |title=Inhibition of isoniazid-induced hepatotoxicity in rabbits by pretreatment with an amidase inhibitor |journal=J.

Drugs continue to be taken off the market due to late discovery of hepatotoxicity. Due to its unique metabolism and close relationship with the [[gastrointestinal tract]], the liver is susceptible to injury from drugs and other substances. 75% of blood coming to the liver arrives directly from gastrointestinal organs and then spleen via [[Hepatic portal vein|portal vein]]s that bring drugs and xenobiotics in near-undiluted form. Several mechanisms are responsible for either inducing hepatic injury or worsening the damage process.
Many chemicals damage  [[mitochondria]], an intracellular organelle that produces energy. Its dysfunction releases excessive amount of oxidants that, in turn, injure hepatic cells. Activation of some enzymes in the cytochrome P-450 system such as  [[CYP2E1]] also lead to oxidative stress.&lt;ref name="pmid11812920"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jaeschke H, Gores GJ, Cederbaum AI, Hinson JA, Pessayre D, Lemasters JJ |title=Mechanisms of hepatotoxicity |journal=Toxicol.

=== Drug metabolism in liver ===
[[Image:Hepatic drug metabolism.svg|thumb|Drug metabolism in liver: transferases are : glutathione, sulfate, acetate, glucoronic acid. P-450 is cytochrome P-450 enzymes. 3 different pathways are depicted for Drugs A, B and C.]]
The human body identifies almost all drugs as foreign substances (i.e. [[xenobiotics]]) and subjects them to various chemical processes (i.e. [[metabolism]]) to make them suitable for elimination. This involves chemical transformations to (a) reduce fat solubility and (b) to change biological activity. Although almost all tissues in the body have some ability to metabolize chemicals, [[smooth endoplasmic reticulum]] in the liver is the principal "metabolic clearing house" for both [[endogenous]] chemicals (e.g., [[cholesterol]], steroid hormones,  [[fatty acids]], [[proteins]]) and [[exogenous]] substances (e.g., drugs, alcohol).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Donald Blumenthal |author2=Laurence Brunton |author3=Keith Parker |author4=Lazo, John S. |author5=Iain Buxton |title=Goodman and Gilman's Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics Digital Edition |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |location= |year= 2006|pages= |isbn=0-07-146804-8 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central role played by liver in the clearance and transformation of chemicals makes it susceptible to drug-induced injury.

[[Drug metabolism]] is usually divided into two phases: ''phase 1'' and ''phase 2''. Phase 1 reaction is thought to prepare a drug for phase 2. However many compounds can be metabolized by phase 2 directly. Phase 1 reaction involves [[oxidation]], [[Reduction (chemistry)|reduction]], [[hydrolysis]], [[hydration reaction|hydration]] and many other rare chemical reactions. These processes tend to increase water solubility of the drug and can generate metabolites that are more chemically active and potentially toxic. Most of phase 2 reactions take place in  [[cytosol]] and involve conjugation with endogenous compounds via [[transferase]] enzymes. Chemically active phase 1 products are rendered relatively inert and suitable for elimination by this step.

A group of [[enzyme]]s located in the endoplasmic reticulum, known as [[cytochrome P-450]], is the most important family of metabolizing enzymes in the liver. Cytochrome P-450 is the terminal [[oxidase]] component of an [[electron transport chain]]. It is not a single enzyme, but rather consists of a closely related family of 50 [[isoform]]s; six of them metabolize 90% of drugs.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7487-6011-3"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Skett, Paul |author2=Gibson, G. Gordon |title=Introduction to drug metabolism |publisher=Nelson Thornes Publishers |location=Cheltenham, UK |year=2001 |pages= |isbn=0-7487-6011-3 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17708140"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lynch T, Price A |title=The effect of cytochrome P450 metabolism on drug response, interactions, and adverse effects |journal=American Family Physician |volume=76 |issue=3 |pages=391–6 |year=2007 |pmid=17708140 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a tremendous diversity of individual P-450 gene products, and this heterogeneity allows the liver to perform oxidation on a vast array of chemicals (including almost all drugs) in phase 1. Three important characteristics of the P-450 system have roles in drug-induced toxicity:
:'''1. Genetic diversity:'''
Each of the P-450 proteins is unique and accounts (to some extent) for the variation in drug metabolism between individuals. Genetic variations ([[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]) in P-450 metabolism should be considered when patients exhibit unusual sensitivity or resistance to drug effects at normal doses. Such polymorphism is also responsible for variable drug response among patients of differing ethnic backgrounds.

:'''2. Change in enzyme activity:'''
Many substances can influence the P-450 enzyme mechanism. Drugs interact with the enzyme family in several ways.&lt;ref name="pmid9469685"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Michalets EL |title=Update: clinically significant cytochrome P-450 drug interactions |journal=Pharmacotherapy |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=84–112 |year=1998 |pmid=9469685 |doi=10.1002/j.1875-9114.1998.tb03830.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drugs that modify cytochrome P-450 enzyme are referred to as either inhibitors or inducers. Enzyme inhibitors block the metabolic activity of one or several P-450 enzymes. This effect usually occurs immediately. On the other hand, inducers increase P-450 activity by increasing its synthesis. Depending on the inducing drug's half life, there is usually a delay before enzyme activity increases.&lt;ref name="pmid17708140"/&gt;

:'''3. Competitive inhibition:'''
Some drugs may share the same P-450 specificity and thus competitively block their bio transformation. This may lead to accumulation of drugs metabolized by the enzyme. This type of drug interaction may also reduce the rate of generation of toxic substrate.

Chemicals produce a wide variety of clinical and [[pathological]] hepatic injury. Biochemical markers (e.g. [[alanine transferase]], [[alkaline phosphatase]] and [[bilirubin]]) are often used to indicate liver damage. Liver injury is defined as a rise in either (a) [[alanine transferase|ALT]] level more than three times of upper limit of normal (ULN), (b) [[alkaline phosphatase|ALP]] level more than twice ULN, or (c) total bilirubin level more than twice ULN when associated with increased ALT or ALP.&lt;ref name="pmid16710915"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bénichou C |title=Criteria of drug-induced liver disorders. Report of an international consensus meeting |journal=J. Hepatol. |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=272–6 |year=1990 |pmid=2254635 |doi=10.1016/0168-8278(90)90124-A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liver damage is further characterized into hepatocellular (predominantly initial [[Alanine transferase]] elevation) and [[cholestatic]] (initial alkaline phosphatase rise) types. However they are not mutually exclusive and mixed types of injuries are often encountered.

Specific [[Morphology (biology)|histo-pathological]] patterns of liver injury from drug-induced damage are discussed below.

====Zonal Necrosis====

This is the most common type of drug-induced liver cell [[necrosis]] where the injury is largely confined to a particular zone of the [[liver lobule]]. It may manifest as a very high level of [[Alanine transaminase|ALT]] and severe disturbance of liver function leading to [[acute liver failure]].
:Causes include:
:[[Paracetamol]], [[carbon tetrachloride]]

====Hepatitis====

In this pattern, [[hepatitis|hepatocellular necrosis]] is associated with infiltration of inflammatory cells. There can be three types of drug-induced hepatitis. (A) viral hepatitis is the most common, where histological features are similar to acute viral hepatitis. (B) in focal or non-specific hepatitis, scattered foci of cell necrosis may accompany [[lymphocyte|lymphocytic]] infiltration. (C) chronic hepatitis is very similar to [[autoimmune hepatitis]] clinically, serologically, and histologically.
:Causes:
:(a) Viral hepatitis: [[Halothane]], [[isoniazid]], [[phenytoin]]
:(b) Focal hepatitis: [[Aspirin]]
:(c) Chronic hepatitis: [[Methyldopa]], [[diclofenac]]

====[[Cholestasis]]====

Liver injury leads to impairment of bile flow and cases are predominated by itching and jaundice. Histology may show inflammation (cholestatic hepatitis) or it can be bland (without any [[parenchymal]] inflammation). On rare occasions, it can produce features similar to primary biliary cirrhosis due to progressive destruction of small bile ducts ([[Vanishing Bile Duct Syndrome|Vanishing duct syndrome]]).
:Causes:
:(a) Bland: [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|Oral contraceptive pills]], [[anabolic steroid]], [[androgens]]
:(b) Inflammatory: [[Allopurinol]], [[co-amoxiclav]], [[carbamazepine]]
:(c) Ductal: [[Chlorpromazine]], [[flucloxacillin]]

====[[Steatosis]]====

Hepatotoxicity may manifest as triglyceride accumulation, which leads to either small-droplet (microvesicular) or large-droplet (macrovesicular) fatty liver. There is a separate type of steatosis by which phospholipid accumulation leads to a pattern similar to the diseases with inherited phospholipid metabolism defects (e.g., [[Tay-Sachs disease]])
:Causes:
:(a) Microvesicular: [[Aspirin]] ([[Reye's syndrome]]), [[ketoprofen]], [[tetracycline]] (especially if expired)
:(b) Macrovesicular: [[Acetamenophen]], [[methotrexate]]
:(c) Phospholipidosis: [[Amiodarone]], [[total parenteral nutrition]]
:(d) [[Antiviral]]: [[nucleoside analogue]]s
:(e) [[Corticosteroid]]
:(f) Hormonal: [[Tamoxifen]]

====[[Granuloma]]====

Drug-induced hepatic granulomas are usually associated with granulomas in other tissues and patients typically have features of systemic vasculitis and hypersensitivity. More than 50 drugs have been implicated.
: Causes:
:[[Allopurinol]], [[phenytoin]], [[isoniazid]], [[quinine]], [[penicillin]], [[quinidine]]

====Vascular lesions====

These result from injury to the vascular endothelium.
:Causes:
:[[Venoocclusive disease]]: Chemotherapeutic agents, bush tea
:[[Peliosis hepatis]]: Anabolic steroids
:[[Budd-Chiari syndrome|Hepatic vein thrombosis]]: Oral contraceptives

====[[Neoplasm]]====

Neoplasms have been described with prolonged exposure to some medications or toxins. Hepatocellular carcinoma, angiosarcoma, and liver adenomas are the ones usually reported.
:Causes:
:[[Vinyl chloride]], [[combined oral contraceptive pill]], [[anabolic steroid]], [[arsenic]], [[thorotrast]]

== Diagnosis ==
[[Image:Assessment of hepatotoxicity.svg|thumb|Algorithm for suspected drug induced hepatic toxicity]]
This remains a  challenge in clinical practice due to a lack of reliable markers.&lt;ref name="pmid17230599"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Andrade RJ, Robles M, Fernández-Castañer A, López-Ortega S, López-Vega MC, Lucena MI |title=Assessment of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in clinical practice: a challenge for gastroenterologists |journal=World J. Gastroenterol. |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=329–40 |year=2007 |pmid=17230599 |doi=10.3748/wjg.v13.i3.329}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other conditions lead to similar clinical as well as pathological pictures. To diagnose hepatotoxicity, a causal relationship between the use of the toxin or drug and subsequent liver damage has to be established, but might be difficult, especially when idiosyncratic reaction is suspected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Arundel C, Lewis JH |title=Drug-induced liver disease in 2006 |journal=Curr. Opin. Gastroenterol. |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=244–54 |year=2007 |pmid=17414839 |doi=10.1097/MOG.0b013e3280b17dfb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneous use of multiple drugs may add to the complexity. As in acetaminophen toxicity, well established, dose-dependent, pharmacological hepatotoxicity is easier to spot. Several clinical scales such as [[Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences|CIOMS]]/RUCAM scale and Maria and Victorino criteria have been proposed to establish causal relationship between offending drug and liver damage. [[CIOMS/RUCAM scale]] involves a scoring system that categorizes the suspicion into "definite or highly probable" (score &gt; 8), “probable” (score 6-8), “possible” (score 3-5), “unlikely” (score 1-2) and “excluded” (score ≤ 0). In clinical practice, physicians put more emphasis on the presence or absence of similarity between the biochemical profile of the patient and known biochemical profile of the suspected toxicity (e.g., cholestatic damage in  [[Co-amoxiclav|amoxycillin-clauvonic acid]] ).&lt;ref name="pmid17230599"/&gt;

== Treatment and prognosis ==
In most cases, liver function will return to normal if the offending drug is stopped early. Additionally, the patient may require supportive treatment. In [[acetaminophen toxicity]], however, the initial insult can be fatal. Fulminant hepatic failure from drug-induced hepatotoxicity may require liver transplantation. In the past, glucocorticoids in allergic features and ursodeoxycholic acid in cholestatic cases had been used, but there is no good evidence to support their effectiveness.

An elevation in serum bilirubin level of more than 2 times ULN with associated transaminase rise is an ominous sign. This indicates severe hepatotoxicity and is likely to lead to mortality in 10% to 15% of patients, especially if the offending drug is not stopped ([[Hy's Law]]).&lt;ref name="pmid14768020"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Reuben A |title=Hy's law |journal=Hepatology |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=574–8 |year=2004 |pmid=14768020 |doi=10.1002/hep.20081}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16618822"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Arora N, Goldhaber SZ |title=Anticoagulants and transaminase elevation |journal=Circulation |volume=113 |issue=15 |pages=e698–702 |year=2006 |pmid=16618822 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.603100}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because it requires significant damage to the liver to impair bilirubin excretion, hence minor impairment (in the absence of biliary obstruction or [[Gilbert syndrome]]) would not lead to jaundice. Other poor predictors of outcome are old age, female sex, high [[Aspartate transaminase|AST]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Andrade RJ, Lucena MI, Kaplowitz N, etal |title=Outcome of acute idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury: Long-term follow-up in a hepatotoxicity registry |journal=Hepatology |volume=44 |issue=6 |pages=1581–8 |year=2006 |pmid=17133470 |doi=10.1002/hep.21424}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Björnsson E, Olsson R |title=Outcome and prognostic markers in severe drug-induced liver disease |journal=Hepatology |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=481–9 |year=2005 |pmid=16025496 |doi=10.1002/hep.20800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hexazinone''' is an [[organic compound]] that is used as a broad spectrum [[herbicide]].  It is a colorless solid.  It exhibits some solubility in water but is highly soluble in most organic solvents except alkanes.  A member  of the [[triazine]] class herbicides, it is manufactured by [[DuPont]] and sold under the trade name '''Velpar'''.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold P. Appleby, Franz Müller, Serge Carpy "Weed Control" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a28_165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It functions by inhibiting photosynthesis and thus is a nonselective herbicide.  It is used to control grasses, broadleaf, and woody plants. Approximately 33% is used on alfalfa, 31% in forestry, 29% in industrial areas, 4% on rangeland and pastures, and &lt; 2% on sugarcane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/profiles/herb-growthreg/fatty-alcohol-monuron/hexazinone/herb-prof-hexazinone.html Hexazinone], Herbicide Profile, Pesticide Management Education Program, [[Cornell University]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hexazinone is a pervasive groundwater contaminant, due to its high water solubility

== History ==
Hexazinone is widely used as a herbicide. It is a non-selective herbicide from the triazine family. It's is used among a broad range of places. It is used to control weeds within all sort of applications. From sugarcane plantations, forestry field nurseries, pineapple plantations to high- and railway grasses and industrial plant sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Huili|last2=Xu|first2=Shuxia|last3=Tan|first3=Chengxia|last4=Wang|first4=Xuedong|date=2009-05-30|title=Anaerobic biodegradation of hexazinone in four sediments|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389408012752|journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials|volume=164|issue=2–3|pages=806–811|doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2008.08.073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hexazinone was first registered in 1975 for the overall control of weeds and later for uses in crops.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.epa.gov/pesticides/reregistration/web/pdf/0266fact.pdf|title=Hexazinone: Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) Fact Sheet|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure and reactivity ==
Triazines like hexazinone can bind to the D-1 quinone protein of the electron transport chain in photosystem II to inhibit the photosynthesis. These diverted electrons can thereby damage membranes and destroy cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://agron-www.agron.iastate.edu/Courses/Agron317/Photosynthesis_Inhibitors.htm|title=Agronomy 317 - Iowa State University|website=agron-www.agron.iastate.edu|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synthesis ==
Hexazinone can be synthesized in two different reaction processes. One process starts with a reaction of [[methyl chloroformate]] with [[cyanamide]], forming hexazinone after a five-step pathway:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/470787466|title=Ullmann's agrochemicals.|date=2007-01-01|publisher=Wiley-VCH|isbn=9783527316045|oclc=470787466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hexazinon1.svg|border|frameless|520x520px]]

A second synthesis starts with methyl[[thiourea]].:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Hexazinon2.svg|border|frameless|618x818px]]

== Degradation ==
The degradation of hexazinone has long been studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Helling|first=C. S.|last2=Kearney|first2=P. C.|last3=Alexander|first3=M.|year=1971|title=Behavior of pesticides in soil|url=|journal=Adv.

However, degradation in natural waters can be three to seven times greater. Surprisingly, the [[pH]] and the temperature of the water do not affect the [[photodegradation]] significantly.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rhodes|first=R.

== Mechanism of action ==
Hexazinone is a broad-spectrum residual and contact [[herbicide]], rapidly absorbed by the leaves and roots. It is tolerated by conifers, and therefore it is a very effective [[herbicide]] for the control for [[Annual plant|annual]] and [[Perennial plant|perennial]] [[Broad-leaved tree|broadleaf]] weeds, some grasses, and some woody species. Hexazinone works as rain or snowmelt makes it possible for the [[herbicide]] to move downward into the soil. There the hexazinone is absorbed from the soil by the roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental fates and impacts of major forest use pesticides|last=Ghassemi|first=M., et al.|publisher=|year=1981|isbn=|location=Washington D.C.|pages=169–194}}&lt;/ref&gt; It moves through the conductive tissues to the leaves, where it blocks the [[photosynthesis]] of the plant within the [[chloroplast]]s. Hexazinone binds to a protein of the [[photosystem II]] complex, which blocks the electron transport. The result are multiple following reactions. First triplet-state [[chlorophyll]] reacts with [[oxygen]] to form [[singlet oxygen]]. Both [[chlorophyll]] and [[singlet oxygen]] then remove [[hydrogen ion]]s from the unsaturated [[lipid]]s present in de cells and the organelle membranes, forming lipid radicals. These radicals will oxydize other lipids and proteins, eventually resulting in loss of the membrane integrity of the cells and organelles. This will result in a loss of [[chlorophyll]], leakage of cellular contents, cell death, and eventually death of the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wssa.net/|title=Weed Science Society of America|website=wssa.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woody plants first show yellowing of the leaves before they start to defoliate, eventually they will die.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sidhu|first=S.

== History ==
At the late of 1970s, Egypt was motivated to build eight [[nuclear power plant]]s and to develop experience at the back end of a [[nuclear fuel cycle]] and was concluded several contracts with an unnamed foreign company to build the Hydrometallurgy Pilot Plant (HPP).&lt;ref name=nti /&gt;&lt;ref name=globalsecurity /&gt;

HPP was originally designed as a [[nuclear reprocessing]] facility,&lt;ref name=globalsecurity /&gt;&lt;ref name=ffi&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gabrielsen|first1=Andreas|title=Drivers of nuclear weapons proliferation in Egypt and Saudi Arabia|url=http://www.ffi.no/no/Rapporter/13-02307.pdf|website=[[Norwegian Defence Research Establishment]]|accessdate=4 May 2015|date=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1982, the second laboratory became operational.&lt;ref name=nti /&gt;

== Overview ==
The HPP consists of three laboratories, the first laboratory consists of three hot cells (modules 1-3)&lt;ref name=nti /&gt; with the first module, is [[radiation protection|shielded]] [[alpha particle]] cell dedicated for mechanical shearing of research reactor fuel, it was unfinished due to the inability to secure the necessary export licence for the shearing equipment from the foreign vendor. The second module, is dissolver and [[mixer-settler]]s for first stage fission product separation. The third module, was designed for [[radioactive waste#Vitrification|waste vitrification]] with no equipment had been installed.&lt;ref name=globalsecurity /&gt;

The second laboratory contains two modules, module 4, whish is a [[Lead shielding|lead shielded]] [[glove box]] for second stage fission product separation using mixer settlers, while module 5, is an unshielded glove box for the separation of plutonium from uranium.&lt;ref name=nti /&gt;&lt;ref name=globalsecurity /&gt;

The third laboratory consists of two connected glove box lines suitable for plutonium chemistry but which contain no equipment.&lt;ref name=globalsecurity /&gt;

HPP possess a minor plutonium processing capacity and unable to reprocess and extract [[weapons-grade#Weapons-grade plutonium|weapons-grade plutonium]] from the spent fuel of the research reactors due to the inability to complete the facility,&lt;ref name=nti /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blanc|first1=Alexis|last2=Roberts|first2=Brad|title=Nuclear Proliferation: A Historical Overview|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA482642|publisher=[[Institute for Defense Analyses]]|accessdate=5 May 2015|date=March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Egypt decided to use one cell of the HPP within the framework of a project for the management of unused and orphan radioactive sealed sources,&lt;ref name=globalsecurity /&gt; which provides Egypt with the research capabilities on the back-end of nuclear fuel cycle.&lt;ref name=nti /&gt;

== Undeclared nuclear materials and activities ==
{{main|Nuclear program of Egypt#Undeclared nuclear activity}}
In early 2001, the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) detected particles of [[actinides]] and [[nuclear fission product|fission products]] near the HPP facility, which shed light on the existence of the HPP.&lt;ref name=nti /&gt;&lt;ref name=mef /&gt;

In November 2004 and January 2005, Egypt declared that, in 1987, it had carried out [[acceptance test]]s in the HPP using unirradiated [[uranyl nitrate]] in chemical reagents purchased from the local market while the uranyl nitrate had been mixed with a solution obtained from the dissolution of domestically produced scrap [[UO2]] pellets (with 1.9&amp;nbsp;kg of uranium compounds). Egypt rationalized that it did not inform the IAEA about the facility, materials nor their use in the tests as the HPP never completed and it was designed for bench scale radiochemistry experiments, while Egypt should declared the HPP to the Agency as early as possible prior to the introduction of nuclear material into the facility, according to the [[IAEA safeguards|Safeguards Agreement]] which came into forece in 1982.&lt;ref name=globalsecurity /&gt; Therefore, Between 2004 and 2006, Egypt had submitted design information for the HPP and had provide inventory change reports (ICRs) with respect to the acceptance tests.&lt;ref name=wikileaks /&gt;

In 2009, The IAEA's Safeguards Implementation Report (SIR) for 2008, concludes that earlier issues of undeclared nuclear activities and material reported to the [[Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency|Board of Governors]] in February 2005 are no longer outstanding.&lt;ref name=wikileaks /&gt;

The '''Ising model''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|s|ɪ|ŋ}}; {{IPA-de|ˈiːzɪŋ|lang}}), named after the physicist [[Ernst Ising]], is a [[mathematical models in physics|mathematical model]] of [[ferromagnetism]] in [[statistical mechanics]]. The model consists of [[discrete variables]] that represent [[Nuclear magnetic moment|magnetic dipole moments of atomic ''spins'']] that can be in one of two states (+1 or −1). The spins are arranged in a graph, usually a [[lattice (group)|lattice]], allowing each spin to interact with its neighbors. The model allows the identification of [[phase transition]]s, as a simplified model of reality. The two-dimensional [[square-lattice Ising model]] is one of the simplest statistical models to show a [[phase transition]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvtxt|Gallavotti|1999}}, Chapters VI-VII.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ising model was invented by the physicist {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Wilhelm Lenz|first=Wilhelm|last=Lenz|year=1920}}, who gave it as a problem to his student Ernst Ising. The one-dimensional Ising model has no phase transition and was solved by {{harvtxt|Ising|1925}} himself in his 1924 thesis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/anglica/Chronology/20thC/Ising/isi_fm00.html Ernst Ising, ''Contribution to the Theory of Ferromagnetism'']&lt;/ref&gt; The two-dimensional square lattice Ising model is much harder, and was given an analytic description much later, by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Lars Onsager|first=Lars |last=Onsager|year=1944}}. It is usually solved by a [[transfer-matrix method]], although there exist different approaches, more related to [[quantum field theory]].

In dimensions greater than four, the phase transition of the Ising model is described by [[mean field theory]].

==Definition==
Consider a set Λ of lattice sites, each with a set of adjacent sites (e.g. a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]) forming a ''d''-dimensional lattice.  For each lattice site ''k''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;Λ there is a discrete variable σ&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; such that σ&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;{+1,&amp;nbsp;−1}, representing the site's spin. A ''spin configuration'', σ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(σ&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''k''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;Λ&lt;/sub&gt; is an assignment of spin value to each lattice site.

For any two adjacent sites ''i'',&amp;nbsp;''j''&amp;nbsp;∈ Λ there is an ''interaction'' ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;. Also a site ''j''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;Λ has an ''external magnetic field'' ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; interacting with it. The ''energy'' of a configuration σ is given by the [[Hamiltonian function]]

:&lt;math&gt;H(\sigma) = - \sum_{\langle i~j\rangle} J_{ij} \sigma_i \sigma_j -\mu \sum_{j} h_j\sigma_j&lt;/math&gt;

where the first sum is over pairs of adjacent spins (every pair is counted once). The notation ⟨''ij''⟩ indicates that sites ''i'' and ''j'' are nearest neighbors. The [[magnetic moment]] is given by µ. Note that the sign in the second term of the Hamiltonian above should actually be positive because the electron's magnetic moment is antiparallel to its spin, but the negative term is used conventionally.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvtxt|Baierlein|1999}}, Chapter 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''configuration probability'' is given by the  [[Boltzmann distribution]] with [[inverse temperature]] β ≥ 0:

:&lt;math&gt;P_\beta(\sigma) ={e^{-\beta H(\sigma)} \over Z_\beta},&lt;/math&gt;

where β&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T'')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and the normalization constant

:&lt;math&gt; Z_\beta = \sum_\sigma e^{-\beta H(\sigma)}&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]]. For a function ''f'' of the spins ("observable"), one denotes by

:&lt;math&gt; \langle f \rangle_\beta = \sum_\sigma f(\sigma) P_\beta(\sigma) \,&lt;/math&gt;

the expectation (mean value) of ''f''.

The configuration probabilities ''P''&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;(σ) represent the probability that (in equilibrium) the system is in a state with configuration σ.

===Discussion===
The minus sign on each term of the Hamiltonian function ''H''(σ) is conventional. Using this sign convention, the Ising models can be classified according to the sign of the interaction: if, for all pairs ''i'',''j''
::&lt;math&gt;J_{ij} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, the interaction is called [[ferromagnetic]]
::&lt;math&gt;J_{ij} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, the interaction is called [[antiferromagnetic]]
::&lt;math&gt;J_{ij} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, the spins are ''noninteracting''

otherwise the system is called '''nonferromagnetic'''.

In a ferromagnetic Ising model, spins desire to be aligned: the configurations in which adjacent spins are of the same sign have higher probability. In an antiferromagnetic model, adjacent spins tend to have opposite signs.

The sign convention of ''H''(σ) also explains how a spin site ''j'' interacts with the external field. Namely, the spin site wants to line up with the external field. If:
::&lt;math&gt;h_j&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, the spin site ''j'' desires to line up in the positive direction
::&lt;math&gt;h_j&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;, the spin site ''j'' desires to line up in the negative direction
::&lt;math&gt;h_j=0&lt;/math&gt;, there is no external influence on the spin site.

===Simplifications===
Ising models are often examined without an external field interacting with the lattice, that is, ''h''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 for all ''j'' in the lattice Λ. Using this simplification, our Hamiltonian becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;H(\sigma) = - \sum_{\langle i~j\rangle} J_{ij} \sigma_i \sigma_j. &lt;/math&gt;

When the external field is everywhere zero, ''h''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, the Ising model is symmetric under switching the value of the spin in all the lattice sites; a non zero field breaks this symmetry.

Another common simplification is to assume that all of the nearest neighbors &lt;''ij''&gt; have the same interaction strength. Then we can set ''J&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''J'' for all pairs ''i'',''j'' in Λ. In this case our Hamiltonian is further simplified to:

:&lt;math&gt;H(\sigma) = -J\sum_{\langle i~j\rangle}\sigma_i \sigma_j. &lt;/math&gt;

===Questions===
A significant number of statistical questions to ask about this model are in the limit of large numbers of spins:
*In a typical configuration, are most of the spins +1 or −1, or are they split equally?
*If a spin at any given position ''i'' is 1, what is the probability that the spin at position ''j'' is also 1?
*If ''β'' is changed, is there a phase transition?
*On a lattice Λ, what is the fractal dimension of the shape of a large cluster of +1 spins?

==Basic properties and history==
[[File:Ising-tartan.png|thumb|right|Visualization of the translation-invariant probability measure of the one-dimensional Ising model.]]

The most studied case of the Ising model is the translation-invariant ferromagnetic zero-field model on a ''d''-dimensional lattice, namely, Λ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, ''h''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

In his 1924 PhD thesis, Ising solved the model for the ''d''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 case, which can be thought of as a linear horizontal lattice where each site only interacts with its left and right neighbor.  In one dimension, the solution admits no [[phase transition]].&lt;ref&gt;http://users-phys.au.dk/fogedby/statphysII/no-PT-in-1D.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Namely, for any positive β, the correlations &lt;σ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;σ&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&gt; decay exponentially in |''i''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''j''|:

:&lt;math&gt; \langle \sigma_i \sigma_j \rangle_\beta \leq C \exp(-c(\beta) |i-j|),\,&lt;/math&gt;

and the system is disordered. On the basis of this result, he incorrectly concluded that this model does not exhibit phase behaviour in any dimension.

The Ising model undergoes a [[phase transition]] between an [[ordered phase|ordered]] and a [[disordered phase]] in 2 dimensions or more. Namely, the system is disordered for small β, whereas for large β the system exhibits ferromagnetic order:

:&lt;math&gt; \langle \sigma_i \sigma_j \rangle_\beta \geq c(\beta) &gt; 0.\,&lt;/math&gt;

This was first proven by [[Rudolf Peierls]] in 1936,&lt;ref&gt;http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=2027260&lt;/ref&gt; using what is now called a '''Peierls argument'''.

The Ising model on a two-dimensional square lattice with no magnetic field was analytically solved by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Lars Onsager|first=Lars |last=Onsager|year=1944}}. Onsager showed that the [[correlation function]]s and [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] of the Ising model are  determined by a noninteracting lattice fermion. Onsager announced the formula for the [[spontaneous magnetization]] for the 2-dimensional model in 1949 but did not give a derivation. {{harvtxt|Yang|1952}} gave the first published proof of this formula, using a [[Szegő limit theorems|limit formula]] for [[Fredholm determinant]]s, proved in 1951 by [[Gábor Szegő|Szegő]] in direct response to Onsager's work.&lt;ref name="Montroll 1963 pages=308-309"&gt;{{harvnb|Montroll|Potts|Ward|1963|pages=308–309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical significance==
One of [[Democritus]]' arguments in support of [[atomism]] was that atoms naturally explain the sharp phase boundaries observed in materials{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}, as when ice melts to water or water turns to steam. His idea was that small changes in atomic-scale properties would lead to big changes in the aggregate behavior. Others believed that matter is inherently continuous, not atomic, and that the large-scale properties of matter are not reducible to basic atomic properties.

While the laws of chemical binding made it clear to nineteenth century chemists that atoms were real, among physicists the debate continued well into the early twentieth century. Atomists, notably [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], applied Hamilton's formulation of Newton's laws to large systems, and found that the [[statistical mechanics|statistical behavior]] of the atoms  correctly describes room temperature gases. But classical statistical mechanics did not account for all of the properties of liquids and solids, nor of gases at low temperature.

Once modern [[quantum mechanics]] was formulated, atomism was no longer in conflict with experiment, but this did not lead to a universal acceptance of statistical mechanics, which went beyond atomism.  [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] had given a complete formalism to reproduce the laws of thermodynamics from the laws of mechanics. But many faulty arguments survived from the 19th century, when statistical mechanics was considered dubious. The lapses in intuition mostly stemmed from the fact that the limit of an infinite statistical system has many [[Zero–one law (disambiguation)|zero-one law]]s which are absent in finite systems: an infinitesimal change in a parameter can lead to big differences in the overall, aggregate behavior, as Democritus expected.

===No phase transitions in finite volume===
In the early part of the twentieth century, some believed that the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] could never describe a phase transition, based on the following argument:

# The partition function is a sum of ''e''&lt;sup&gt;−β''E''&lt;/sup&gt; over all configurations.
# The exponential function is everywhere [[analytic function|analytic]] as a function of β.
# The sum of analytic functions is an analytic function.

This argument works for a finite sum of exponentials, and correctly establishes that there are no singularities in the free energy of a system of a finite size. For systems which are in the thermodynamic limit (that is, for infinite systems) the infinite sum can lead to singularities. The convergence to the thermodynamic limit is fast, so that the phase behavior is apparent already on a relatively small lattice, even though the singularities are smoothed out by the system's finite size.

This was first established by [[Rudolf Peierls]] in the Ising model.

Shortly after Lenz and Ising constructed the Ising model, Peierls was able to explicitly show that a phase transition occurs in two dimensions.

To do this, he compared the high-temperature and low temperature limits. At infinite temperature, β = 0, all configurations have equal probability. Each spin is completely independent of any other, and if typical configurations at infinite temperature are plotted so that plus/minus are represented by black and white, they look like [[noise (video)|television snow]]. For high, but not infinite temperature, there are small correlations between neighboring positions, the snow tends to clump a little bit, but the screen stays random looking, and there is no net excess of black or white.

A quantitative measure of the excess is the '''magnetization''', which is the average value of the spin:

::&lt;math&gt;M= {1\over N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sigma_i.&lt;/math&gt;

A bogus argument analogous to the argument in the last section now establishes that the magnetization in the Ising model is always zero.
# Every configuration of spins has equal energy to the configuration with all spins flipped.
# So for every configuration with magnetization ''M'' there is a configuration with magnetization −''M'' with equal probability.
# The system should therefore spend equal amounts of time in the configuration with magnetization ''M'' as with magnetization −''M''.
# So the average magnetization (over all time) is zero.

As before, this only proves that the average magnetization is zero at any finite volume. For an infinite system, fluctuations might not be able to push the system from a mostly-plus state to a mostly minus with a nonzero probability.

For very high temperatures, the magnetization is zero, as it is at infinite temperature. To see this, note that if spin A has only a small correlation ε with spin B, and B is only weakly correlated with C, but C is otherwise independent of A, the amount of correlation of A and C goes like ε&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. For two spins separated by distance L, the amount of correlation goes as ε&lt;sup&gt;''L''&lt;/sup&gt; but if there is more than one path by which the correlations can travel, this amount is enhanced by the number of paths.

The number of paths of length L on a square lattice in ''d'' dimensions is
::&lt;math&gt;N(L) = (2d)^L&lt;/math&gt;
since there are 2d choices for where to go at each step.

A bound on the total correlation is given by the contribution to the correlation by summing over all paths linking two points, which is bounded above by the sum over all paths of length L divided by
::&lt;math&gt;\sum_L (2d)^L \varepsilon^L  &lt;/math&gt;
which goes to zero when ε is small.

At low temperatures, β ≫ 1, the configurations are near the lowest energy configuration, the one where all the spins are plus or all the spins are minus. Peierls asked whether it is statistically possible at low temperature, starting with all the spins minus, to fluctuate to a state where most of the spins are plus. For this to happen, droplets of plus spin must be able to congeal to make the plus state.

The energy of a droplet of plus spins in a minus background is proportional to the perimeter of the droplet L, where plus spins and minus spins neighbor each other. For a droplet with perimeter L, the area is somewhere between (''L''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2)/2 (the straight line) and (''L''/4)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (the square box). The probability cost for introducing a droplet has the factor ''e''&lt;sup&gt;−β''L''&lt;/sup&gt;, but this contributes to the partition function multiplied by the total number of droplets with perimeter ''L'', which is less than the total number of paths of length ''L'':
:&lt;math&gt;N(L)&lt; 4^{2L}.&lt;/math&gt;
So that the total spin contribution from droplets, even overcounting by allowing each site to have a separate droplet, is bounded above by
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_L L^2 4^{-2L} e^{-4\beta L}&lt;/math&gt;

which goes to zero at large β. For β sufficiently large, this exponentially suppresses long loops, so that they cannot occur, and the magnetization never fluctuates too far from&amp;nbsp;−1.

So Peierls established that the magnetization in the Ising model eventually defines [[superselection sector]]s, separated domains which are not linked by finite fluctuations.

===Kramers–Wannier duality===
{{main|Kramers–Wannier duality}}
Kramers and Wannier were able to show that the high temperature expansion and the low temperature expansion of the model are equal up to an overall rescaling of the free energy. This allowed the phase transition point in the two-dimensional model to be determined exactly (under the assumption that there is a unique critical point).

===Yang–Lee zeros===
{{main|Lee–Yang theorem}}
After Onsager's solution, Yang and Lee investigated the way in which the partition function becomes singular as the temperature approaches the critical temperature.

==Monte Carlo methods for numerical simulation==
[[File:Ising quench b10.gif|framed|right|Quench of an Ising system on a two dimensional square lattice (500x500) with inverse temperature ''β''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10 starting from a random configuration.]]

===Definitions===
The Ising model can often be difficult to evaluate numerically if there are many states in the system. Consider an Ising model with

*''L'' = |Λ|: the total number of sites on the lattice,
*σ&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ {−1, +1}: an individual spin site on the lattice, ''j''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, ..., ''L'',
*''S'' ∈ {−1, +1}&lt;sup&gt;''L''&lt;/sup&gt;: state of the system.

Since every spin site has ±1 spin, there are ''2''&lt;sup&gt;''L''&lt;/sup&gt;  different states that are possible.&lt;ref name = "Newman"&gt;Newman MEJ, Barkema GT, "Monte Carlo Methods in Statistical Physics, Clarendon Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; This motivates the reason for the Ising model to be simulated using [[Monte Carlo methods]].&lt;ref name="Newman" /&gt;

The [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] that is commonly used to represent the energy of the model when using Monte Carlo methods is:
:&lt;math&gt;H(\sigma) = - J\sum_{\langle i~j\rangle}\sigma_i \sigma_j -h\sum_{j}\sigma_j.&lt;/math&gt;
Furthermore, the Hamiltonian is further simplified by assuming zero external field (''h'') since many questions that are posed to be solved using the model can be answered in absence of an external field. This leads us to the following energy equation for state σ:
:&lt;math&gt;H(\sigma) = - J\sum_{\langle i~j\rangle}\sigma_i \sigma_j.&lt;/math&gt;
Given this Hamiltonian, quantities of interest such as the specific heat or the magnetization of the magnet at a given temperature can be calculated.&lt;ref name="Newman" /&gt;

===Metropolis algorithm===

====Overview====
The [[Metropolis–Hastings algorithm]] is the most commonly used Monte Carlo algorithm to calculate Ising model estimations.&lt;ref name="Newman" /&gt; The algorithm first chooses '''selection probabilities''' ''g''(μ, ν), which represent the probability that state ν is selected by the algorithm out of all states, given that one is in state μ. It then uses acceptance probabilities ''A''(μ, ν) so that [[detailed balance]] is satisfied. If the new state ν is accepted, then we move to that state and repeat with selecting a new state and deciding to accept it. If ν is not accepted then we stay in μ. This process is repeated until some stopping criterion is met, which for the Ising model is often when the lattice becomes [[ferromagnetic]], meaning all of the sites point in the same direction.&lt;ref name="Newman" /&gt;

When implementing the algorithm, one must ensure that ''g''(μ, ν) is selected such that [[ergodicity]] is met. In [[thermal equilibrium]] a system's energy only fluctuates within a small range.&lt;ref name="Newman" /&gt; This is the motivation behind the concept of '''single-spin-flip dynamics''', which states that in each transition, we will only change one of the spin sites on the lattice.&lt;ref name="Newman" /&gt;  Furthermore, by using single- spin-flip dynamics, one can get from any state to any other state by flipping each site that differs between the two states one at a time.

The maximum amount of change between the energy of the present state, ''H''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt; and any possible new state's energy ''H''&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt; (using single-spin-flip dynamics) is 2J between the spin we choose to "flip" to move to the new state and that spin's neighbor.&lt;ref name="Newman" /&gt; Thus, in a 1D-Ising model, where each site has two neighbors (left, and right), the maximum difference in energy would be 4J.

Let ''c'' represent the '''lattice coordination number'''; the number of nearest neighbors that any lattice site has.  We assume that all sites have the same number of neighbors due to [[periodic boundary conditions]].&lt;ref name="Newman" /&gt; It is important to note that the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm does not perform well around the critical point due to critical slowing down. Other techniques such as multigrid methods, Niedermayer's algorithm, Swendsen–Wang algorithm, or the Wolff algorithm are required in order to resolve the model near the critical point; a requirement for determining the critical exponents of the system.

====Specification====
Specifically for the Ising model and using single-spin-flip dynamics, one can establish the following.

Since there are ''L'' total sites on the lattice, using single-spin-flip as the only way we transition to another state, we can see that there are a total of ''L'' new states ν from our present state μ. The algorithm assumes that the selection probabilities are equal to the ''L'' states: ''g''(μ, ν) = 1/''L''. [[Detailed balance]] tells us that the following equation must hold:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{P(\mu,\nu)}{P(\nu,\mu)} = \frac{g(\mu,\nu)A(\mu,\nu)}{g(\nu,\mu)A(\nu,\mu)} = \frac{A(\mu,\nu)}{A(\nu,\mu)} = \frac{P_\beta(\nu)}{P_\beta(\mu)} = \frac{\frac{1}{Z}e^{-\beta(H_\nu)}}{\frac{1}{Z}e^{-\beta(H_\mu)}} = e^{-\beta(H_\nu-H_\mu)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, we want to select the acceptance probability for our algorithm to satisfy:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{A(\mu,\nu)}{A(\nu,\mu)}=e^{-\beta(H_\nu-H_\mu)}.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''H''&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''H''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;  then ''A''(ν, μ) &gt; ''A''(μ, ν) Metropolis sets the larger of ''A''(μ, ν) or ''A''(ν, μ) to be 1. By this reasoning the acceptance algorithm is:&lt;ref name="Newman" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A(\mu,\nu)=\begin{cases}
 e^{-\beta(H_\nu-H_\mu)}, &amp; \text{if }H_\nu-H_\mu&gt;0 \\
 1, &amp; \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The basic form of the algorithm is as follows:
#Pick a spin site using selection probability ''g''(μ, ν) and calculate the contribution to the energy involving this spin.
#Flip the value of the spin and calculate the new contribution.
#If the new energy is less, keep the flipped value.
#If the new energy is more, only keep with probability &lt;math&gt; e^{-\beta(H_\nu-H_\mu)}.&lt;/math&gt;
#Repeat.

The change in energy ''H''&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;−''H''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt; only depends on the value of the spin and its nearest graph neighbors. So if the graph is not too connected, the algorithm is fast. This process will eventually produce a pick from the distribution.

===Viewing the Ising model as a Markov chain===
It is possible to view the Ising model as a [[Markov chain]], as the immediate probability ''P''&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;(ν) of transitioning to a future state ν only depends on the present state μ. The Metropolis algorithm is actually a version of a [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] simulation, and since we use single-spin-flip dynamics in the Metropolis algorithm, every state can be viewed as having links to exactly ''L'' other states, where each transition corresponds to flipping a single spin site to the opposite value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Teif V.B. |title=General transfer matrix formalism to calculate DNA-protein-drug binding in gene regulation|journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |year=2007|volume=35|issue=11|pages=e80|doi=10.1093/nar/gkm268|pmid=17526526|pmc=1920246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, since the energy equation ''H''&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt; change only depends on the nearest-neighbor interaction strength ''J'', the Ising model and its variants such the [[Sznajd model]] can be seen as a form of a [[Contact process (mathematics)#Voter model|voter model]] for opinion dynamics.

Therefore, ''T'' = 0 is the critical temperature of this case. Scaling formulas are satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Baxter | first1=Rodney J. | title=Exactly solved models in statistical mechanics* | url=http://tpsrv.anu.edu.au/Members/baxter/book | publisher=Academic Press Inc.

===Ising's exact solution===
In the nearest neighbor case (with periodic or free boundary conditions) an exact solution is available. The energy of the one-dimensional Ising model on a lattice of ''L'' sites with periodic boundary conditions is
:&lt;math&gt;H(\sigma)=-J\sum_{i=1,\ldots,L-1} \sigma_i \sigma_{i+1} - h \sum_i \sigma_i&lt;/math&gt;
where ''J'' and ''h'' can be any number, since in this simplified case ''J'' is a constant representing the interaction strength between the nearest neighbors and ''h'' is the constant external magnetic field applied to lattice sites. Then the
[[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] is
:&lt;math&gt;f(\beta, h)=-\lim_{L\to \infty} \frac{1}{\beta L} \ln (Z(\beta))=-\frac{1}{\beta} \ln\left(e^{\beta J} \cosh \beta h+\sqrt{e^{2\beta J}(\sinh\beta h)^2+e^{-2\beta J}}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
and the spin-spin correlation is
:&lt;math&gt;\langle \sigma_i \sigma_j\rangle-\langle \sigma_i \rangle\langle\sigma_j\rangle=C(\beta)e^{-c(\beta)|i-j|}&lt;/math&gt;
where C(β) and ''c''(β) are positive functions for ''T'' &gt; 0. For ''T'' → 0, though, the inverse correlation length, ''c''(β), vanishes.

====Proof====
The proof of this result is a simple computation.

If ''h'' = 0, it is very easy to obtain the free energy in the case of free boundary condition, i.e. when
:&lt;math&gt;H(\sigma)=-J(\sigma_1\sigma_2+\cdots+\sigma_{L-1}\sigma_L).&lt;/math&gt;
Then the model ''factorizes'' under the ''change of variables''
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma'_j=\sigma_j\sigma_{j-1} \qquad j\ge 2.&lt;/math&gt;
That gives

:&lt;math&gt; Z(\beta) =\sum_{\sigma_1,\ldots, \sigma_L} e^{\beta J\sigma_1\sigma_2}\; e^{\beta J\sigma_2\sigma_3}\; \cdots e^{\beta J\sigma_{L-1}\sigma_L}= 2\prod_{j=2}^L \sum_{\sigma'_j}  e^{\beta J\sigma'_j} =2\left[ e^{\beta J}+e^{-\beta J}\right]^{L-1}. &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the free energy is

:&lt;math&gt;f(\beta,0)=-\frac{1}{\beta } \ln\left[e^{\beta J}+ e^{-\beta J}\right]. &lt;/math&gt;

With the same change of variables

:&lt;math&gt;\langle \sigma_{j}\sigma_{j+N}\rangle=\left[\frac{e^{\beta J}- e^{-\beta J}}{e^{\beta J}+ e^{-\beta J}}\right]^N&lt;/math&gt;

hence it decays exponentially as soon as ''T'' ≠ 0; but for ''T'' = 0, i.e. in the limit β → ∞ there is no decay.

If ''h'' ≠ 0 we need the transfer matrix method. For the periodic boundary conditions case is the following.  The partition function is
:&lt;math&gt;Z(\beta)=\sum_{\sigma_1,\ldots, \sigma_L} e^{\beta h \sigma_1}e^{\beta J\sigma_1\sigma_2}\; e^{\beta h \sigma_2}e^{\beta J\sigma_2\sigma_3}\; \cdots e^{\beta h \sigma_L}e^{\beta J\sigma_L\sigma_1}=  \sum_{\sigma_1,\ldots, \sigma_L} V_{\sigma_1,\sigma_2}V_{\sigma_2,\sigma_3}\cdots V_{\sigma_L,\sigma_1}. &lt;/math&gt;
The coefficients &lt;math&gt;V_{\sigma, \sigma'}&lt;/math&gt;'s can be seen as the entries of a matrix. There are different possible choices: a convenient one (because the matrix is symmetric) is
:&lt;math&gt; V_{\sigma, \sigma'} = e^{\frac{\beta h}{2} \sigma} e^{\beta J\sigma\sigma'} e^{\frac{\beta h}{2} \sigma'}&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;V=\begin{bmatrix} e^{\beta(h+J)}&amp;e^{-\beta J}\\ e^{-\beta J}&amp;e^{-\beta(h-J)} \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
In matrix formalism
:&lt;math&gt; Z(\beta)={\rm Tr} \left(V^L\right)= \lambda_1^L + \lambda_2^L= \lambda_1^L\left[1+ \left(\frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1}\right)^L\right]&lt;/math&gt;
where λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the highest eigenvalue of ''V'', while λ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the other eigenvalue:
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_1=e^{\beta J} \cosh \beta h+ \sqrt{e^{2\beta J} (\sinh\beta h)^2  +e^{-2\beta J}} &lt;/math&gt;
and |λ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;| &lt; λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. This gives the formula of the free energy.

====Comments====
The energy of the lowest state is −''JL'', when all the spins are the same. For any other configuration, the extra energy is equal to 2''J'' times the number of sign changes that are encountered when scanning the configuration from left to right.

If we designate the number of sign changes in a configuration as ''k'', the difference in energy from the lowest energy state is 2''k''. Since the energy is additive in the number of flips, the probability ''p'' of having a spin-flip at each position is independent. The ratio of the probability of finding a flip to the probability of not finding one is the Boltzmann factor:

:&lt;math&gt;{p \over 1-p} = e^{-2\beta J}.&lt;/math&gt;

The problem is reduced to independent biased [[coin toss]]es. This essentially completes the mathematical description.

From the description in terms of independent tosses, the statistics of the model for long lines can be understood. The line splits into domains. Each domain is of average length exp(2β). The length of a domain is distributed exponentially, since there is a constant probability at any step of encountering a flip. The domains never become infinite, so a long system is never magnetized. Each step reduces the correlation between a spin and its neighbor by an amount proportional to ''p'', so the correlations fall off exponentially.

:&lt;math&gt;\langle S_i S_j \rangle \,\propto\, e^{-p|i-j|}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] is the volume of configurations, each configuration weighted by its Boltzmann weight. Since each configuration is described by the sign-changes, the partition function factorizes:

:&lt;math&gt;Z = \sum_{\mathrm{configs}} e^{\sum_k S_k} = \prod_k (1 + p ) = (1+p)^L.&lt;/math&gt;

The logarithm divided by ''L'' is the free energy density:

:&lt;math&gt;\beta f = \log(1+p)  = \log\left( 1 + {e^{-2\beta J}\over 1+e^{-2\beta J}} \right),&lt;/math&gt;

which is [[Analytic function|analytic]] away from β = ∞. A sign of a [[phase transition]] is a non-analytic free energy, so the one-dimensional model does not have a phase transition.

===One-dimensional solution with transverse field===

To express the Ising Hamiltonian using a quantum mechanical description of spins, we replace the spin variables with their respective Pauli matrices.  However, depending on the direction of the magnetic field, we can create a transverse-field or longitudinal-field Hamiltonian.  The transverse-field Hamiltonian is given by

:&lt;math&gt;H(\sigma)=-J\sum_{i=1,\ldots,L} \sigma_i^z \sigma_{i+1}^z - h \sum_i \sigma_i^x.&lt;/math&gt;

The transverse-field model experiences a phase transition between an ordered and disordered regime at J~h.  This can be shown by a mapping of Pauli matrices

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_n^z = \prod_{i=1}^nT_i^x,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_n^x = T_n^zT_{n+1}^z.&lt;/math&gt;

Upon rewriting the Hamiltonian in terms of this change-of-basis matrices, we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;H(\sigma)=-h\sum_{i=1,\ldots,L} T_i^z T_{i+1}^z - J\sum_i T_i^x.&lt;/math&gt;
Since the roles of h and J are switched, the Hamiltonian undergoes a transition at J = h.&lt;ref name="Chakra"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Suzuki|first1= Sei|last2= Inoue|first2= Jun-ichi|last3= Chakrabarti|first3= Bikas K.|title=Quantum Ising Phases and Transitions in Transverse Ising Models |publisher=Springer|year=2012|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-33039-1|isbn=978-3-642-33038-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two dimensions==
* In the ferromagnetic  case there is a phase transition. At low temperature, the [[Peierls argument]] proves positive magnetization for the nearest neighbor case and then, by the [[Griffiths inequality]], also when longer range interactions are added. Meanwhile, at high temperature, the [[cluster expansion]] gives analyticity of the thermodynamic functions.
* In the nearest-neighbor case, the free energy was exactly computed by Onsager, through the equivalence of the model with free fermions on lattice. The spin-spin correlation functions were computed by McCoy and Wu.

===Onsager's exact solution===
{{main|square-lattice Ising model}}
{{harvtxt|Onsager|1944}} obtained the following analytical expression for the free energy of the Ising model on the anisotropic square lattice when the magnetic field &lt;math&gt;h=0&lt;/math&gt; in the thermodynamic limit as a function of temperature and the horizontal and vertical interaction energies &lt;math&gt;J_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;J_2&lt;/math&gt;, respectively

:&lt;math&gt; -\beta f = \ln 2 + \frac{1}{8\pi^2}\int_0^{2\pi}d\theta_1\int_0^{2\pi}d\theta_2 \ln[\cosh(2\beta J_1)\cosh(2\beta J_2) -\sinh(2\beta J_1)\cos(\theta_1)-\sinh(2\beta J_2)\cos(\theta_2)]. &lt;/math&gt;

From this expression for the free energy, all thermodynamic functions of the model can be calculated by using an appropriate derivative. The 2D Ising model was the first model to exhibit a continuous phase transition at a positive temperature. It occurs as the temperature &lt;math&gt;T_c&lt;/math&gt; which is a solution of the following equation

:&lt;math&gt; \sinh\left(\frac{2J_1}{kT_c}\right)\sinh\left(\frac{2J_2}{kT_c}\right) = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

In the isotropic case when the horizontal and vertical interaction energies are equal &lt;math&gt;J_1=J_2=J&lt;/math&gt;, the critical temperature &lt;math&gt;T_c&lt;/math&gt; occurs at the following point

:&lt;math&gt; T_c = \frac{2J}{k\ln(1+\sqrt{2})} &lt;/math&gt;

When the interaction energies &lt;math&gt;J_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;J_2&lt;/math&gt; are both negative, the Ising model becomes an antiferromagnet. Since the square lattice is bi-partite, it is invariant under this change when the magnetic field &lt;math&gt;h=0&lt;/math&gt;, so the free energy and critical temperature are the same for the antiferromagnetic case. For the triangular lattice, which is not bi-partite, the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Ising model behave notably differently.

====Transfer matrix====
Start with an analogy with quantum mechanics. The Ising model on a long periodic lattice has a partition function

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_S \exp\biggl(\sum_{ij} S_{i,j} S_{i,j+1} + S_{i,j} S_{i+1,j}\biggr).&lt;/math&gt;

Think of the ''i'' direction as ''space'', and the ''j'' direction as ''time''. This is an independent sum over all the values that the spins can take at each time slice. This is a type of [[path integral formulation|path integral]], it is the sum over all spin histories.

A path integral can be rewritten as a Hamiltonian evolution. The Hamiltonian steps through time by performing a unitary rotation between time ''t'' and time ''t'' + Δ''t'':
:&lt;math&gt; U = e^{i H \Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;

The product of the U matrices, one after the other, is the total time evolution operator, which is the path integral we started with.

:&lt;math&gt; U^N = (e^{i H \Delta t})^N = \int DX e^{iL}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is the number of time slices. The sum over all paths is given by a product of matrices, each matrix element is the transition probability from one slice to the next.

Similarly, one can divide the sum over all partition function configurations into slices, where each slice is the one-dimensional configuration at time 1. This defines the [[Transfer-matrix method|transfer matrix]]:
:&lt;math&gt;T_{C_1 C_2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The configuration in each slice is a one-dimensional collection of spins. At each time slice, ''T'' has matrix elements between two configurations of spins, one in the immediate future and one in the immediate past. These two configurations are ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and they are all one-dimensional spin configurations. We can think of the vector space that ''T'' acts on as all complex linear combinations of these. Using quantum mechanical notation:
:&lt;math&gt;|A\rangle = \sum_S A(S) |S\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

where each basis vector &lt;math&gt;|S\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a spin configuration of a one-dimensional Ising model.

Like the Hamiltonian, the transfer matrix acts on all linear combinations of states.  The partition function is a matrix function of T, which is defined by the sum over all histories which come back to the original configuration after ''N'' steps:
:&lt;math&gt;Z= \mathrm{tr}(T^N).&lt;/math&gt;

Since this is a matrix equation, it can be evaluated in any basis. So if we can diagonalize the matrix ''T'', we can find ''Z''.

====''T'' in terms of Pauli matrices====
The contribution to the partition function for each past/future pair of configurations on a slice is the sum of two terms. There is the number of spin flips in the past slice and there is the number of spin flips between the past and future slice. Define an operator on configurations which flips the spin at site i:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^x_i.&lt;/math&gt;

In the usual Ising basis, acting on any linear combination of past configurations, it produces the same linear combination but with the spin at position i of each basis vector flipped.

Define a second operator which multiplies the basis vector by +1 and −1 according to the spin at position ''i'':

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^z_i.&lt;/math&gt;

''T'' can be written in terms of these:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_i A \sigma^x_i + B \sigma^z_i \sigma^z_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' and ''B'' are constants which are to be determined so as to reproduce the partition function. The interpretation is that the statistical configuration at this slice contributes according to both the number of spin flips in the slice, and whether or not the spin at position ''i' has flipped.

====Spin flip creation and annihilation operators====
Just as in the one-dimensional case, we will shift attention from the spins to the spin-flips. The σ&lt;sup&gt;''z''&lt;/sup&gt; term in ''T'' counts the number of spin flips, which we can write in terms of spin-flip creation and annihilation operators:

:&lt;math&gt; \sum C \psi^\dagger_i \psi_i. \,&lt;/math&gt;

The first term flips a spin, so depending on the basis state it either:
#moves a spin-flip one unit to the right
#moves a spin-flip one unit to the left
#produces two spin-flips on neighboring sites
#destroys two spin-flips on neighboring sites.

Writing this out in terms of creation and annihilation operators:
:&lt;math&gt; \sigma^x_i = D {\psi^\dagger}_i \psi_{i+1} + D^* {\psi^\dagger}_i \psi_{i-1} + C\psi_i \psi_{i+1} + C^* {\psi^\dagger}_i {\psi^\dagger}_{i+1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Ignore the constant coefficients, and focus attention on the form. They are all quadratic. Since the coefficients are constant, this means that the ''T'' matrix can be diagonalized by Fourier transforms.

Carrying out the diagonalization produces the Onsager free energy.

====Onsager's formula for spontaneous magnetization====
Onsager famously announced the following expression for the [[spontaneous magnetization]] ''M'' of a two-dimensional Ising ferromagnet on the square lattice at two different conferences in 1948, though without proof&lt;ref name="Montroll 1963 pages=308-309"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M = \left(1 - \left[\sinh 2\beta J_1 \sinh 2\beta J_2\right]^{-2}\right)^{\frac{1}{8}}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;J_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;J_2&lt;/math&gt; are horizontal and vertical interaction energies.

A complete derivation was only given in 1951 by {{harvtxt|Yang|1952}} using a limiting process of transfer matrix eigenvalues. The proof was subsequently greatly simplified in 1963 by Montroll, Potts, and Ward&lt;ref name="Montroll 1963 pages=308-309"/&gt; using [[Gábor Szegő|Szegő]]'s [[Szegő limit theorems|limit formula]] for [[Toeplitz determinant]]s by treating the magnetization as the limit of correlation functions.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method currently yields the most precise information about the structure of the critical theory (see [[Ising critical exponents]]).

In dimensions near four, the critical behavior of the model is understood to correspond to the [[renormalization group|renormalization]] behavior of the [[Quartic interaction|scalar phi-4 theory]] (see [[Kenneth G. Wilson|Kenneth Wilson]]).

==More than four dimensions==
In any dimension, the Ising model can be productively described by a locally varying mean field. The field is defined as the average spin value over a large region, but not so large so as to include the entire system. The field still has slow variations from point to point, as the averaging volume moves. These fluctuations in the field are described by a continuum field theory in the infinite system limit.

===Local field===
The field ''H'' is defined as the long wavelength Fourier components of the spin variable, in the limit that the wavelengths are long. There are many ways to take the long wavelength average, depending on the details of how high wavelengths are cut off. The details are not too important, since the goal is to find the statistics of ''H'' and not the spins. Once the correlations in ''H'' are known, the long-distance correlations between the spins will be proportional to the long-distance correlations in ''H''.

For any value of the slowly varying field ''H'', the free energy (log-probability) is a local analytic function of ''H'' and its gradients. The free energy ''F''(''H'') is defined to be the sum over all Ising configurations which are consistent with the long wavelength field. Since ''H'' is a coarse description, there are many Ising configurations consistent with each value of ''H'', so long as not too much exactness is required for the match.

Since the allowed range of values of the spin in any region only depends on the values of ''H'' within one averaging volume from that region, the free energy contribution from each region only depends on the value of ''H'' there and in the neighboring regions. So ''F'' is a sum over all regions of a local contribution, which only depends on ''H'' and its derivatives.

By symmetry in ''H'', only even powers contribute. By reflection symmetry on a square lattice, only even powers of gradients contribute. Writing out the first few terms in the free energy:

:&lt;math&gt;\beta F  =  \int d^dx \left[ A H^2 + \sum_{i=1}^d Z_i (\partial_i H)^2 + \lambda H^4 +\cdots \right].&lt;/math&gt;

On a square lattice, symmetries guarantee that the coefficients ''Z&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the derivative terms are all equal. But even for an anisotropic Ising model, where the ''Z&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''s in different directions are different, the fluctuations in ''H'' are isotropic in a coordinate system where the different directions of space are rescaled.

On any lattice, the derivative term
:&lt;math&gt;Z_{ij} \, \partial_i H \, \partial_j H &lt;/math&gt;
is a positive definite [[quadratic form]], and can be used to ''define'' the metric for space. So any translationally invariant Ising model is rotationally invariant at long distances, in coordinates that make ''Z&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' = δ&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;. Rotational symmetry emerges spontaneously at large distances just because there aren't very many low order terms. At higher order multicritical points, this [[accidental symmetry]] is lost.

Since β''F'' is a function of a slowly spatially varying field, the probability of any field configuration is:

:&lt;math&gt;P(H) \propto e^{ - \int d^dx \left[ AH^2 + Z |\nabla H|^2 + \lambda H^4 \right]}.&lt;/math&gt;

The statistical average of any product of ''H'' terms is equal to:

:&lt;math&gt;\langle H(x_1) H(x_2)\cdots H(x_n) \rangle = { \int DH \, P(H) H(x_1) H(x_2) \cdots H(x_n) \over \int DH \, P(H) }.&lt;/math&gt;

The denominator in this expression is called the ''partition function'', and the integral over all possible values of ''H'' is a statistical path integral. It integrates exp(β''F'') over all values of ''H'', over all the long wavelength fourier components of the spins. ''F'' is a Euclidean Lagrangian for the field ''H'', the only difference between this and the [[quantum field theory]] of a scalar field being that all the derivative terms enter with a positive sign, and there is no overall factor of ''i''.

:&lt;math&gt;Z = \int DH \, e^{ - \int d^dx \left[ A H^2 + Z  |\nabla H|^2 + \lambda H^4 \right]}&lt;/math&gt;

===Dimensional analysis===
The form of ''F'' can be used to predict which terms are most important by dimensional analysis. Dimensional analysis is not completely straightforward, because the scaling of ''H'' needs to be determined.

In the generic case, choosing the scaling law for ''H'' is easy, since the only term that contributes is the first one,

:&lt;math&gt;F = \int d^dx \, A H^2.&lt;/math&gt;

This term is the most significant,  but it gives trivial behavior. This form of the free energy is ultralocal, meaning that it is a sum of an independent contribution from each point. This is like the spin-flips in the one-dimensional Ising model. Every value of ''H'' at any point fluctuates completely independently of the value at any other point.

The scale of the field can be redefined to absorb the coefficient ''A'', and then it is clear that ''A'' only determines the overall scale of fluctuations. The ultralocal model describes the long wavelength high temperature behavior of the Ising model, since in this limit the fluctuation averages are independent from point to point.

To find the critical point, lower the temperature. As the temperature goes down, the fluctuations in ''H'' go up because the fluctuations are more correlated. This means that the average of a large number of spins does not become small as quickly as if they were uncorrelated, because they tend to be the same. This corresponds to decreasing ''A'' in the system of units where ''H'' does not absorb ''A''. The phase transition can only happen when the subleading terms in ''F'' can contribute, but since the first term dominates at long distances, the coefficient ''A'' must be tuned to zero. This is the location of the critical point:

:&lt;math&gt;F= \int d^dx  \left[ t H^2 + \lambda H^4  + Z (\nabla H)^2 \right],&lt;/math&gt;

where ''t'' is a parameter which goes through zero at the transition.

Since ''t'' is vanishing, fixing the scale of the field using this term makes the other terms blow up. Once ''t'' is small, the scale of the field can either be set to fix the coefficient of the ''H''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; term or the (∇''H'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; term to 1.

===Magnetization===
To find the magnetization, fix the scaling of ''H'' so that λ is one. Now the field ''H'' has dimension −''d''/4, so that ''H''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;''d&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;x'' is dimensionless, and ''Z'' has dimension 2&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''d''/2. In this scaling, the gradient term is only important at long distances for ''d'' ≤ 4. Above four dimensions, at long wavelengths, the overall magnetization is only affected by the ultralocal terms.

There is one subtle point. The field ''H'' is fluctuating statistically, and the fluctuations can shift the zero point of ''t''. To see how, consider ''H''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; split in the following way:

:&lt;math&gt;H(x)^4 = -\langle H(x)^2\rangle^2  + 2\langle H(x)^2\rangle H(x)^2 + \left(H(x)^2 - \langle H(x)^2\rangle\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

The first term is a constant contribution to the free energy, and can be ignored. The second term is a finite shift in ''t''. The third term is a quantity that scales to zero at long distances. This means that when analyzing the scaling of ''t'' by dimensional analysis, it is the shifted ''t'' that is important. This was historically very confusing, because the shift in ''t'' at any finite ''λ'' is finite, but near the transition ''t'' is very small. The fractional change in ''t'' is very large, and in units where ''t'' is fixed the shift looks infinite.

The magnetization is at the minimum of the free energy, and this is an analytic equation. In terms of the shifted ''t'',

:&lt;math&gt;{\partial \over \partial H } \left( t H^2 + \lambda H^4 \right ) = 2t H + 4\lambda H^3 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

For ''t'' &lt; 0, the minima are at ''H'' proportional to the square root of ''t''. So Landau's [[catastrophe theory|catastrophe]] argument is correct in dimensions larger than 5. The magnetization exponent in dimensions higher than 5 is equal to the mean field value.

When ''t'' is negative, the fluctuations about the new minimum are described by a new positive quadratic coefficient. Since this term always dominates, at temperatures below the transition the flucuations again become ultralocal at long distances.

===Fluctuations===
To find the behavior of fluctuations, rescale the field to fix the gradient term. Then the length scaling dimension of the field is 1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''d''/2. Now the field has constant quadratic spatial fluctuations at all temperatures. The scale dimension of the ''H''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; term is 2, while the scale dimension of the ''H''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; term is 4&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''d''. For ''d'' &lt; 4, the ''H''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; term has positive scale dimension. In dimensions higher than 4 it has negative scale dimensions.

This is an essential difference. In dimensions higher than 4, fixing the scale of the gradient term means that the coefficient of the ''H''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; term is less and less important at longer and longer wavelengths. The dimension at which nonquadratic contributions begin to contribute is known as the critical dimension. In the Ising model, the critical dimension is 4.

In dimensions above 4, the critical fluctuations are described by a purely quadratic free energy at long wavelengths. This means that the correlation functions are all computable from as [[Gaussian distribution|Gaussian]] averages:

:&lt;math&gt;\langle S(x)S(y)\rangle \propto \langle H(x)H(y)\rangle = G(x-y)  = \int {dk \over (2\pi)^d} { e^{ik(x-y)}\over k^2 + t }&lt;/math&gt;

valid when ''x''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''y'' is large. The function ''G''(''x''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''y'') is the analytic continuation to imaginary time of the [[propagator|Feynman propagator]], since the free energy is the analytic continuation of the quantum field action for a free scalar field. For dimensions 5 and higher, all the other correlation functions at long distances are then determined by [[S-matrix#Wick's theorem|Wick's theorem]]. All the odd moments are zero, by ± symmetry. The even moments are the sum over all partition into pairs of the product of ''G''(''x''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''y'') for each pair.

:&lt;math&gt;\langle S(x_1) S(x_2) \cdots S(x_{2n})\rangle = C^n \sum G(x_{i1},x_{j1}) G(x_{i2},X_{j2}) \ldots G(x_{in},x_{jn})&lt;/math&gt;

where ''C'' is the proportionality constant. So knowing ''G'' is enough. It determines all the multipoint correlations of the field.

===The critical two-point function===
To determine the form of ''G'', consider that the fields in a path integral obey the classical equations of motion derived by varying the free energy:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
                 &amp;&amp;\left(-\nabla_x^2 + t\right) \langle H(x)H(y) \rangle &amp;= 0 \\
  \rightarrow {} &amp;&amp;                                \nabla^2 G(x) + tG(x) &amp;= 0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This is valid at noncoincident points only, since the correlations of ''H'' are singular when points collide. ''H'' obeys classical equations of motion for the same reason that quantum mechanical operators obey them—its fluctuations are defined by a path integral.

At the critical point ''t'' = 0, this is [[Laplace's equation]], which can be solved by [[Gaussian surface|Gauss's method]] from electrostatics. Define an electric field analog by

:&lt;math&gt;E = \nabla G&lt;/math&gt;

Away from the origin:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot E = 0&lt;/math&gt;

since ''G'' is spherically symmetric in ''d'' dimensions, and ''E'' is the radial gradient of ''G''. Integrating over a large ''d''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 dimensional sphere,

:&lt;math&gt;\int d^{d-1}S E_r = \mathrm{constant}&lt;/math&gt;

This gives:

:&lt;math&gt;E = {C \over r^{d-1} }&lt;/math&gt;

and ''G'' can be found by integrating with respect to ''r''.

:&lt;math&gt;G(r) = {C \over r^{d-2} }&lt;/math&gt;

The constant ''C'' fixes the overall normalization of the field.

===''G''(''r'') away from the critical point===
When ''t'' does not equal zero, so that ''H'' is fluctuating at a temperature slightly away from critical, the two point function decays at long distances. The equation it obeys is altered:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 G  + t G = 0 \to {1 \over r^{d - 1}} {d \over dr} \left( r^{d-1} {dG \over dr} \right) + t G(r) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

For ''r'' small compared with &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{t}&lt;/math&gt;, the solution diverges exactly the same way as in the critical case, but the long distance behavior is modified.

To see how, it is convenient to represent the two point function as an integral, introduced by Schwinger in the quantum field theory context:

:&lt;math&gt;G(x) = \int d\tau  {1 \over \left(\sqrt{2\pi\tau}\right)^d} e^{-{x^2 \over 4\tau} - t\tau}&lt;/math&gt;

This is ''G'', since the Fourier transform of this integral is easy. Each fixed τ contribution is a Gaussian in ''x'', whose Fourier transform is another Gaussian of reciprocal width in ''k''.

:&lt;math&gt;G(k) = \int d\tau  e^{-(k^2 - t)\tau} = {1 \over k^2 - t}&lt;/math&gt;

This is the inverse of the operator ∇&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''t'' in ''k''-space, acting on the unit function in ''k''-space, which is the Fourier transform of a delta function source localized at the origin. So it satisfies the same equation as ''G'' with the same boundary conditions that determine the strength of the divergence at 0.

The interpretation of the integral representation over the ''proper time'' τ is that the two point function is the sum over all random walk paths that link position 0 to position ''x'' over time τ. The density of these paths at time τ at position ''x''  is Gaussian, but the random walkers disappear at a steady rate proportional to ''t'' so that the Gaussian at time τ is diminished in height by a factor that decreases steadily exponentially. In the quantum field theory context, these are the paths of relativistically localized quanta in a formalism that follows the paths of individual particles. In the pure statistical context, these paths still appear by the mathematical correspondence with quantum fields, but their interpretation is less directly physical.

The integral representation immediately shows that ''G''(''r'') is positive, since it is represented as a weighted sum of positive Gaussians. It also gives the rate of decay at large r, since the proper time for a random walk to reach position τ is r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and in this time, the Gaussian height has decayed by &lt;math&gt;e^{-t\tau} = e^{-tr^2}&lt;/math&gt;. The decay factor appropriate for position ''r'' is therefore &lt;math&gt;e^{-\sqrt t r}&lt;/math&gt;.

A heuristic approximation for ''G''(''r'') is:

:&lt;math&gt;G(r)  \approx { e^{-\sqrt t r} \over r^{d-2}}&lt;/math&gt;

This is not an exact form, except in three dimensions, where interactions between paths become important. The exact forms in high dimensions are variants of [[Bessel functions]].

===Symanzik polymer interpretation===
The interpretation of the correlations as fixed size quanta travelling along random walks gives a way of understanding why the critical dimension of the ''H''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; interaction is 4. The term ''H''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; can be thought of as the square of the density of the random walkers at any point. In order for such a term to alter the finite order correlation functions, which only introduce a few new random walks into the fluctuating environment, the new paths must intersect. Otherwise, the square of the density is just proportional to the density and only shifts the ''H''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; coefficient by a constant. But the intersection probability of random walks depends on the dimension, and random walks in dimension higher than 4 do not intersect.

The [[fractal dimension]] of an ordinary random walk is 2. The number of balls of size ε required to cover the path increase as ε&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. Two objects of fractal dimension 2 will intersect with reasonable probability only in a space of dimension 4 or less, the same condition as for a generic pair of planes. [[Kurt Symanzik]] argued that this implies that the critical Ising fluctuations in dimensions higher than 4 should be described by a free field. This argument eventually became a mathematical proof.

===4&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''ε'' dimensions – renormalization group===
The Ising model in four dimensions is described by a fluctuating field, but now the fluctuations are interacting. In the polymer representation, intersections of random walks are marginally possible. In  the quantum field continuation, the quanta interact.

The negative logarithm of the probability of any field configuration ''H'' is the [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] function

:&lt;math&gt;F= \int d^4 x  \left[ {Z \over 2} |\nabla H|^2 + {t\over 2} H^2  + {\lambda \over 4!} H^4 \right] \,&lt;/math&gt;

The numerical factors are there to simplify the equations of motion. The goal is to understand the statistical fluctuations. Like any other non-quadratic path integral, the correlation functions have a [[Feynman diagram|Feynman expansion]] as particles travelling along random walks, splitting and rejoining at vertices. The interaction strength is parametrized by the classically dimensionless quantity λ.

Although dimensional analysis shows that both λ and ''Z'' are dimensionless, this is misleading. The long wavelength statistical fluctuations are not exactly scale invariant, and only become scale invariant when the interaction strength vanishes.

The reason is that there is a cutoff used to define ''H'', and the cutoff defines the shortest wavelength. Fluctuations of ''H'' at wavelengths near the cutoff can affect the longer-wavelength fluctuations. If the system is scaled along with the cutoff, the parameters will scale by dimensional analysis, but then comparing parameters doesn't compare behavior because the rescaled system has more modes. If the system is rescaled in such a way that the short wavelength cutoff remains fixed, the long-wavelength fluctuations are modified.

====Wilson renormalization====
A quick heuristic way of studying the scaling is to cut off the ''H'' wavenumbers at a point λ. Fourier modes of ''H'' with wavenumbers larger than λ are not allowed to fluctuate. A rescaling of length that make the whole system smaller increases all wavenumbers, and moves some fluctuations above the cutoff.

To restore the old cutoff, perform a partial integration over all the wavenumbers which used to be forbidden, but are now fluctuating. In Feynman diagrams, integrating over a fluctuating mode at wavenumber ''k'' links up lines carrying momentum ''k'' in a correlation function in pairs, with a factor of the inverse propagator.

Under rescaling, when the system is shrunk by a factor of (1+''b''), the ''t'' coefficient scales up by a factor (1+''b'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by dimensional analysis. The change in ''t'' for infinitesimal ''b'' is 2''bt''. The other two coefficients are dimensionless and do not change at all.

The lowest order effect of integrating out can be calculated from the equations of motion:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 H + t H = - {\lambda \over 6} H^3.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation is an identity inside any correlation function away from other insertions.  After integrating out the modes with Λ &lt; ''k'' &lt; (1+''b'')Λ, it will be a slightly different identity.

Since the form of the equation will be preserved, to find the change in coefficients it is sufficient to analyze the change in the ''H''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; term. In a Feynman diagram expansion, the ''H''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; term in a correlation function inside a correlation has three dangling lines. Joining two of them at large wavenumber ''k'' gives a change ''H''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; with one dangling line, so proportional to ''H'':

:&lt;math&gt;\delta H^3 = 3H \int_{\Lambda&lt;|k|&lt;(1 + b)\Lambda} {d^4k \over (2\pi)^4}  {1\over (k^2 + t)}&lt;/math&gt;

The factor of 3 comes from the fact that the loop can be closed in three different ways.

The integral should be split into two parts:

:&lt;math&gt;\int dk {1 \over k^2} - t \int dk { 1\over k^2(k^2 + t)} = A\Lambda^2 b + B  b t&lt;/math&gt;

The first part is not proportional to ''t'', and in the equation of motion it can be absorbed by a constant shift in ''t''. It is caused by the fact that the ''H''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; term has a linear part. Only the second term, which varies from ''t'' to ''t'', contributes to the critical scaling.

This new linear term adds to the first term on the left hand side, changing ''t'' by an amount proportional to ''t''. The total change in ''t'' is the sum of the term from dimensional analysis and this second term from [[operator product expansion|operator products]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta t = \left(2 - {B\lambda \over 2} \right)b t&lt;/math&gt;

So ''t'' is rescaled, but its dimension is [[anomalous dimension|anomalous]], it is changed by an amount proportional to the value of λ.

But λ also changes. The change in λ requires considering the lines splitting and then quickly rejoining. The lowest order process is one where one of the three lines from ''H''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; splits into three, which quickly joins with one of the other lines from the same vertex. The correction to the vertex is

:&lt;math&gt;\delta \lambda = - {3 \lambda^2 \over 2} \int_k dk {1 \over (k^2 + t)^2} = -{3\lambda^2 \over 2} b&lt;/math&gt;

The numerical factor is three times bigger because there is an extra factor of three in choosing which of the three new lines to contract. So

:&lt;math&gt;\delta \lambda = - 3 B \lambda^2 b&lt;/math&gt;

These two equations together define the renormalization group equations in four dimensions:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
              {dt \over t} &amp;= \left(2  - {B\lambda \over 2}\right) b \\
  {d\lambda \over \lambda} &amp;= {-3 B \lambda \over 2} b
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The coefficient ''B'' is determined by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;B b  = \int_{\Lambda&lt;|k|&lt;(1+b)\Lambda} {d^4k\over (2\pi)^4} {1 \over k^4}&lt;/math&gt;

and is proportional to the area of a three-dimensional sphere of radius λ, times the width of the integration region ''b''Λ divided by Λ&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;B= (2 \pi^2 \Lambda^3) {1\over (2\pi)^4} { b \Lambda} {1 \over b\Lambda^4} = {1\over 8\pi^2} &lt;/math&gt;

In other dimensions, the constant ''B'' changes, but the same constant appears both in the ''t'' flow and in the coupling flow. The reason is that the derivative with respect to ''t'' of the closed loop with a single vertex is a closed loop with two vertices. This means that the only difference between the scaling of the coupling and the ''t'' is the combinatorial factors from joining and splitting.

====Wilson–Fisher point====
To investigate three dimensions starting from the four-dimensional theory should be possible, because the intersection probabilities of random walks depend continuously on the dimensionality of the space. In the language of Feynman graphs, the coupling does not change very much when the dimension is changed.

The process of continuing away from dimension 4 is not completely well defined without a prescription for how to do it. The prescription is only well defined on diagrams. It replaces the Schwinger representation in dimension 4 with the Schwinger representation in dimension 4&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;ε defined by:
:&lt;math&gt; G(x-y) = \int d\tau {1 \over t^{d\over 2}} e^{{x^2 \over 2\tau} + t \tau} &lt;/math&gt;

In dimension 4&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;ε, the coupling λ has positive scale dimension ε, and this must be added to the flow.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  {d\lambda \over \lambda} &amp;= \varepsilon - 3 B \lambda \\
              {dt \over t} &amp;= 2 - \lambda  B
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The coefficient ''B'' is dimension dependent, but it will cancel.  The fixed point for λ is no longer zero, but at:
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = {\varepsilon \over 3B} &lt;/math&gt;
where the scale dimensions of ''t'' is altered by an amount λ''B'' = ε/3.

The magnetization exponent is altered proportionately to:
:&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2} \left( 1 - {\varepsilon \over 3}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

which is .333 in 3 dimensions (ε = 1) and .166 in 2 dimensions (ε = 2). This is not so far off from the measured exponent .308 and the Onsager two dimensional exponent .125.

===Infinite dimensions – mean field===
{{main|Mean field theory}}

The behavior of an Ising model on a fully connected graph may be completely understood by [[mean field theory]]. This type of description is appropriate to very-high-dimensional square lattices, because then each site has a very large number of neighbors.

The idea is that if each spin is connected to a large number of spins, only the average ratio of + spins to − spins is important, since the fluctuations about this mean will be small. The [[mean field]] ''H'' is the average fraction of spins which are + minus the average fraction of spins which are&amp;nbsp;−. The energy cost of flipping a single spin in the mean field ''H'' is ±2''JNH''. It is convenient to redefine ''J'' to absorb the factor ''N'', so that the limit ''N'' → ∞ is smooth. In terms of the new ''J'', the energy cost for flipping a spin is ±2''JH''.

This energy cost gives the ratio of probability ''p'' that the spin is + to the probability 1−''p'' that the spin is&amp;nbsp;−. This ratio is the Boltzmann factor:
:&lt;math&gt;{p\over 1-p} = e^{2\beta JH}&lt;/math&gt;

so that
:&lt;math&gt;p = {1 \over 1 + e^{-2\beta JH} }&lt;/math&gt;

The mean value of the spin is given by averaging 1 and −1 with the weights ''p'' and 1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p'', so the mean value is 2''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1. But this average is the same for all spins, and is therefore equal to ''H''.
:&lt;math&gt; H = 2p - 1 = { 1 - e^{-2\beta JH} \over 1 + e^{-2\beta JH}} = \tanh (\beta JH)&lt;/math&gt;

The solutions to this equation are the possible consistent mean fields. For β''J'' &lt; 1 there is only the one solution at ''H'' = 0. For bigger values of β there are three solutions, and the solution at ''H'' = 0 is unstable.

The instability means that increasing the mean field above zero a little bit produces a statistical fraction of spins which are + which is bigger than the value of the mean field. So a mean field which fluctuates above zero will produce an even greater mean field, and will eventually settle at the stable solution. This means that for temperatures below the critical value β''J'' = 1 the mean field Ising model undergoes a phase transition in the limit of large ''N''.

Above the critical temperature, fluctuations in ''H'' are damped because the mean field restores the fluctuation to zero field. Below the critical temperature, the mean field is driven to a new equilibrium value, which is either the positive ''H'' or negative ''H'' solution to the equation.

For β''J'' = 1 + ε, just below the critical temperature, the value of ''H'' can be calculated from the Taylor expansion of the hyperbolic tangent:
:&lt;math&gt;H = \tanh(\beta J H) = (1+\varepsilon)H - {(1+\varepsilon)^3H^3\over 3}&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing by ''H'' to discard the unstable solution at ''H'' = 0, the stable solutions are:
:&lt;math&gt;H = \sqrt{3\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt;

The spontaneous magnetization ''H'' grows near the critical point as the square root of the change in temperature. This is true whenever ''H'' can be calculated from the solution of an analytic equation which is symmetric between positive and negative values, which led [[Lev Landau|Landau]] to suspect that all Ising type phase transitions in all dimensions should follow this law.

The mean field exponent is [[Universality (dynamical systems)|universal]] because changes in the character of solutions of analytic equations are always described by [[catastrophe theory|catastrophes]] in the Taylor series, which is a polynomial equation. By symmetry, the equation for ''H'' must only have odd powers of ''H'' on the right hand side. Changing β should only smoothly change the coefficients. The transition happens when the coefficient of ''H'' on the right hand side is 1. Near the transition:
:&lt;math&gt;H = {\partial (\beta F) \over \partial h} = (1+A\varepsilon) H + B H^3 + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

Whatever ''A'' and ''B'' are, so long as neither of them is tuned to zero, the sponetaneous magnetization will grow as the square root of ε. This argument can only fail if the free energy β''F'' is either non-analytic or non-generic at the exact β where the transition occurs.

But the spontaneous magnetization in magnetic systems and the density in gasses near the critical point are measured very accurately. The density and the magnetization in three dimensions have the same power-law dependence on the temperature near the critical point, but the behavior from experiments is:
:&lt;math&gt;H \propto \varepsilon^{0.308}&lt;/math&gt;

The exponent is also universal, since it is the same in the Ising model as in the experimental magnet and gas, but it is not equal to the mean field value. This was a great surprise.

This is also true in two dimensions, where
:&lt;math&gt;H \propto \varepsilon^{0.125}&lt;/math&gt;

But there it was not a surprise, because it was predicted by [[Lars Onsager|Onsager]].

===Low dimensions&amp;nbsp;– block spins===
In three dimensions, the perturbative series from the field theory is an expansion in a coupling constant λ which is not particularly small. The effective size of the coupling at the fixed point is one over the branching factor of the particle paths, so the expansion parameter is about 1/3. In two dimensions, the perturbative expansion parameter is 2/3.

But renormalization can also be productively applied to the spins directly, without passing to an average field. Historically, this approach is due to [[Leo Kadanoff]] and predated the perturbative ε expansion.

The idea is to integrate out lattice spins iteratively, generating a flow in couplings. But now the couplings are lattice energy coefficients. The fact that a continuum description exists guarantees that this iteration will converge to a fixed point when the temperature is tuned to criticality.

====Migdal–Kadanoff renormalization====
Write the two-dimensional Ising model with an infinite number of possible higher order interactions. To keep spin reflection symmetry, only even powers contribute:
:&lt;math&gt;E = \sum_{ij} J_{ij} S_i S_j + \sum J_{ijkl} S_i S_j S_k S_l \ldots.&lt;/math&gt;

By translation invariance,''J&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' is only a function of i-j. By the accidental rotational symmetry, at large i and j its size only depends on the magnitude of the two-dimensional vector ''i''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''j''. The higher order coefficients are also similarly restricted.

The renormalization iteration divides the lattice into two parts – even spins and odd spins. The odd spins live on the odd-checkerboard lattice positions, and the even ones on the even-checkerboard. When the spins are indexed by the position (''i'',''j''), the odd sites are those with ''i''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''j'' odd and the even sites those with ''i''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''j'' even, and even sites are only connected to odd sites.

The two possible values of the odd spins will be integrated out, by summing over both possible values. This will produce a new free energy function for the remaining even spins, with new adjusted couplings. The even spins are again in a lattice, with axes tilted at 45 degrees to the old ones. Unrotating the system restores the old configuration, but with new parameters. These parameters describe the interaction between spins at distances &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; larger.

Starting from the Ising model and repeating this iteration eventually changes all the couplings. When the temperature is higher than the critical temperature, the couplings will converge to zero, since the spins at large distances are uncorrelated. But when the temperature is critical, there will be nonzero coefficients linking spins at all orders. The flow can be approximated by only considering the first few terms. This truncated flow will produce better and better approximations to the critical exponents when more terms are included.

The simplest approximation is to keep only the usual ''J'' term, and discard everything else. This will generate a flow in ''J'', analogous to the flow in ''t'' at the fixed point of λ in the ε expansion.

To find the change in ''J'', consider the four neighbors of an odd site. These are the only spins which interact with it. The multiplicative contribution to the partition function from the sum over the two values of the spin at the odd site is:
:&lt;math&gt; e^{J (N_+ - N_-)} + e^{J (N_- - N_+)} = 2 \cosh(J[N_+ - N_-])&lt;/math&gt;

where ''N''&lt;sub&gt;±&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of neighbors which are ±. Ignoring the factor of 2, the free energy contribution from this odd site is:
:&lt;math&gt; F = \log(\cosh[J(N_+ - N_-)]).&lt;/math&gt;

This includes nearest neighbor and next-nearest neighbor interactions, as expected, but also a four-spin interaction which is to be discarded. To truncate to nearest neighbor interactions, consider that the difference in energy between all spins the same and equal numbers + and – is:
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta F = \ln(\cosh[4J]).&lt;/math&gt;

From nearest neighbor couplings, the difference in energy between all spins equal and staggered spins is 8''J''. The difference in energy between all spins equal and nonstaggered but net zero spin is 4''J''. Ignoring four-spin interactions, a reasonable truncation is the average of these two energies or 6''J''. Since each link will contribute to two odd spins, the right value to compare with the previous one is half that:
:&lt;math&gt;3J' =  \ln(\cosh[4J]).&lt;/math&gt;

For small ''J'', this quickly flows to zero coupling. Large ''J'''s flow to large couplings. The magnetization exponent is determined from the slope of the equation at the fixed point.

Variants of this method produce good numerical approximations for the critical exponents when many terms are included, in both two and three dimensions.

==Applications==

===Magnetism===
The original motivation for the model was the phenomenon of [[ferromagnetism]]. Iron is magnetic; once it is magnetized it stays magnetized for a long time compared to any atomic time.

In the 19th century, it was thought that magnetic fields are due to currents in matter, and [[André-Marie Ampère|Ampère]] postulated that permanent magnets are caused by permanent atomic currents. The motion of classical charged particles could not explain permanent currents though, as shown by [[Joseph Larmor|Larmor]]. In order to have ferromagnetism, the atoms must have permanent [[magnetic moment]]s which are not due to the motion of classical charges.

Once the electron's spin was discovered, it was clear that the magnetism should be due to a large number of electrons spinning in the same direction. It was natural to ask how the electrons all know which direction to spin, because the electrons on one side of a magnet don't directly interact with the electrons on the other side. They can only influence their neighbors. The Ising model was designed to investigate whether a large fraction of the electrons could be made to spin in the same direction using only local forces.

===Lattice gas===
The Ising model can be reinterpreted as a statistical model for the motion of atoms. Since the kinetic energy depends only on momentum and not on position, while the statistics of the positions only depends on the potential energy, the thermodynamics of the gas only depends on the potential energy for each configuration of atoms.

A coarse model is to make space-time a lattice and imagine that each position either contains an atom or it doesn't. The space of configuration is that of independent bits ''B&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', where each bit is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the position is occupied or not. An attractive interaction reduces the energy of two nearby atoms. If the attraction is only between nearest neighbors, the energy is reduced by −4''JB''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''B''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; for each occupied neighboring pair.

The density of the atoms can be controlled by adding a [[chemical potential]], which is a multiplicative probability cost for adding one more atom. A multiplicative factor in probability can be reinterpreted as an additive term in the logarithm – the energy. The extra energy of a configuration with ''N'' atoms is changed by ''μN''. The probability cost of one more atom is a factor of exp(−''βμ'').

So the energy of the lattice gas is:
:&lt;math&gt;E = - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} 4 J B_i B_j + \sum_i \mu B_i&lt;/math&gt;

Rewriting the bits in terms of spins, &lt;math&gt;B_i = (S_i + 1)/2. &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E = - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} J S_i S_j - \frac{1}{2} \sum_i (4 J - \mu) S_i&lt;/math&gt;

For lattices where every site has an equal number of neighbors, this is the Ising model with a magnetic field ''h'' = (''zJ''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''μ'')/2, where ''z'' is the number of neighbors.

In biological systems, modified versions of the lattice gas model have been used to understand a range of binding behaviors.

===Application to neuroscience===
The activity of [[neuron]]s in the brain can be modelled statistically. Each neuron at any time is either active + or inactive&amp;nbsp;−. The active neurons are those that send an [[action potential]] down the axon in any given time window, and the inactive ones are those that do not. Because the neural activity at any one time is modelled by independent bits, [[J. J. Hopfield|Hopfield]] suggested that a dynamical Ising model would provide a [[Hopfield net|first approximation]] to a neural network which is capable of [[learning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| author= J. J. Hopfield| title = Neural networks and physical systems with emergent collective computational abilities| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA| volume= 79 | pages= 2554–2558| year= 1982| doi = 10.1073/pnas.79.8.2554| pmid = 6953413| issue= 8| pmc= 346238| postscript= .|bibcode = 1982PNAS...79.2554H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the general approach of Jaynes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| author=Jaynes, E. T.| title= Information Theory and Statistical Mechanics | journal= Physical Review| volume = 106 | pages= 620–630 | year= 1957| doi=10.1103/PhysRev.106.620| postscript=.|bibcode = 1957PhRv..106..620J| issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| author= Jaynes, Edwin T.| title = Information Theory and Statistical Mechanics II |journal = Physical Review |volume =108 | pages = 71 | year = 1957| doi= 10.1103/PhysRev.108.171| postscript= .|bibcode = 1957PhRv..108..171J| issue= 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a recent interpretation of Schneidman, Berry, Segev and Bialek,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author1=Elad Schneidman |author2=Michael J. Berry |author3=Ronen Segev |author4=William Bialek | title= Weak pairwise correlations imply strongly correlated network states in a [[neural population]]| journal=Nature| volume= 440 | pages= 1007–1012| year=2006| doi= 10.1038/nature04701| pmid= 16625187| issue= 7087| pmc= 1785327| postscript= .|arxiv = q-bio/0512013 |bibcode = 2006Natur.440.1007S }}&lt;/ref&gt;
is that the Ising model is useful for any model of neural function, because a statistical model for neural activity should be chosen using the [[principle of maximum entropy]]. Given a collection of neurons, a statistical model which can reproduce the average firing rate for each neuron introduces a [[Lagrange multiplier]] for each neuron:
:&lt;math&gt;E = - \sum_i h_i S_i&lt;/math&gt;
But the activity of each neuron in this model is statistically independent. To allow for pair correlations, when one neuron tends to fire (or not to fire) along with another, introduce pair-wise lagrange multipliers:
:&lt;math&gt;E= - \tfrac{1}{2} \sum_{ij} J_{ij} S_i S_j - \sum_i h_i S_i&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;J_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; are not restricted to neighbors. Note that this generalization of Ising model is sometimes called the quadratic exponential binary distribution in statistics.
This energy function only introduces probability biases for a spin having a value and for a pair of spins having the same value. Higher order correlations are unconstrained by the multipliers. An activity pattern sampled from this distribution requires the largest number of bits to store in a computer, in the most efficient coding scheme imaginable, as compared with any other distribution with the same average activity and pairwise correlations. This means that Ising models are relevant to any system which is described by bits which are as random as possible, with constraints on the pairwise correlations and the average number of 1s, which frequently occurs in both the physical and social sciences.

===Spin glasses===
With the Ising model the so-called [[spin glasses]] can also be described, by the usual Hamiltonian
&lt;math&gt;\hat H=-\frac{1}{2}\,\sum J_{i,k}\,S_i\,S_k,&lt;/math&gt;
where the ''S''-variables describe the Ising spins, while the ''J&lt;sub&gt;i,k&lt;/sub&gt;'' are taken from a random distribution.  For spin glasses a typical distribution chooses antiferromagnetic bonds with probability ''p'' and ferromagnetic bonds with probability 1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p''.  These bonds stay fixed or "quenched" even in the presence of thermal fluctuations. When ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 we have the original Ising model. This system deserves interest in its own; particularly one has "non-ergodic" properties leading to strange relaxation behaviour. Much attention has been also attracted by the related bond and site dilute Ising model, especially in two dimensions, leading to intriguing critical behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author= J-S Wang, [[Walter Selke|W Selke]], VB Andreichenko, and VS Dotsenko| title= The critical behaviour of the two-dimensional dilute model|journal= Physica A|volume= 164| issue= 2| pages= 221–239 |year= 1990|doi=10.1016/0378-4371(90)90196-Y|bibcode = 1990PhyA..164..221W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MZES Uni Mannheim A5.jpg|thumb|Main building of the MZES in the square A 5]]
The '''Mannheim Centre for European Social Research (MZES)''' is an interdisciplinary research institute of the [[University of Mannheim]], founded in 1989. It is located in the square A5 of the city of Mannheim nearby the [[Mannheim Palace]].

The institute devotes itself to research on societal and political developments in [[Europe]]. Research focus is located in comparative research on Europe and the investigation of the [[European integration]]. The MZES mainly carries out basic research, financed by external funds from the German national research foundation (''Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft''), foundations promoting scientific research, and research funds from the [[European Union]]. Furthermore, the MZES, closely related to the ''School of Social Sciences'' of the University of Mannheim, gives training and support to young social scientists, when starting their scientific careers. At present, approximately 80 social scientists and 60 students are working at the MZES. Thus, the MZES is the largest institute of the University of Mannheim, and the largest research institute of a German university in the field of the social sciences.

From 1989–1998 the institute was composed of four work units:
* I Social structure and the Welfare State
* II Elections and Policy Research
* III Political and Social Integration
* IV German Democratic Republic / East Europe (1992 to 1998)

In 1999, these four work units were reduced to two research departments:
* Research Department A, ''The European Societies and their Integration'': since February 2017 directed by the sociologist ''Henning Hillmann''.
* Research Department B, ''The European Political Systems and their Integration '': since February 2017 directed by the political scientist ''Harald Schoen''.

The director and the heads of the research departments together form the executive board of the institute. The activity of the executive board and the institute is controlled by a supervisory board. The institute's research program is outlined for three years and evaluated by an international scientific advisory board. An ''annual report'' informs about the institute's activity.

== Directors ==
The director is elected by the supervisory board for a period of three years.
* [[Peter Flora]] 1989–1992 founding director, sociology
* Franz Urban Pappi 1993–1995, political science
* [[Peter Flora]] 1996–1998, sociology
* Jan W. van Deth 1999–2001, political science
* Walter Müller 2002–2004, sociology
* Wolfgang C. Müller 2005–2007, political science
* [[Bernhard Ebbinghaus]] 2008–2011, sociology
* Rüdiger Schmitt-Beck 2011-2014, political science
* Frank Kalter 2014-2017, sociology
* Marc Debus 2017-, political science

A managing director supports the director in his/her work. This position was held from 1989–1997 by Andreas Weber, and from 1998–2009 by Reinhart Schneider. Since 2010 Philipp Heldmann is managing director of the institute.

In [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and related fields, '''master equations''' are used to describe the time evolution of a system that can be modelled as being in a [[probability|probabilistic]] combination of states at any given time and the switching between states is determined by a [[transition rate matrix]]. The equations are a set of [[differential equations]] over time of the probabilities that the system occupies each of the different states.

==Introduction==
A master equation is a phenomenological set of first-order [[differential equations]] describing the time evolution of (usually) the [[probability]] of a system to occupy each one of a discrete [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[Classical mechanics|states]] with regard to a continuous time variable ''t''. The most familiar form of a master equation is a matrix form:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d\vec{P}}{dt}=\mathbf{A}\vec{P},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\vec{P}&lt;/math&gt; is a column vector (where element ''i'' represents state ''i''), and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is the matrix of connections. The way connections among states are made determines the dimension of the problem; it is either
*a d-dimensional system (where d is 1,2,3,...), where any state is connected with exactly its 2d nearest neighbors, or
*a network, where every pair of states may have a connection (depending on the network's properties).

When the connections are time-independent rate constants, the master equation represents a [[kinetic scheme]], and the process is [[Markov process|Markovian]] (any jumping time probability density function for state ''i'' is an exponential, with a rate equal to the value of the connection). When the connections depend on the actual time (i.e. matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; depends on the time, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}\rightarrow\mathbf{A}(t)&lt;/math&gt; ), the process is not stationary and the master equation reads
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d\vec{P}}{dt}=\mathbf{A}(t)\vec{P}.&lt;/math&gt;

When the connections represent multi exponential [[jumping time]] [[probability density function]]s, the process is [[Semi-Markov process|semi-Markovian]], and the equation of motion is an [[integro-differential equation]] termed the generalized master equation:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d\vec{P}}{dt}= \int^t_0 \mathbf{A}(t- \tau )\vec{P}( \tau )d \tau . &lt;/math&gt;

The matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; can also represent [[Birth-death process|birth and death]], meaning that probability is injected (birth) or taken from (death) the system, where then, the process is not in equilibrium.

===Detailed description of the matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;, and properties of the system===
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; be the matrix describing the transition rates (also known as kinetic rates or reaction rates). As always, the first subscript represents the row, the second subscript the column. That is, the source is given by the second subscript, and the destination by the first subscript. This is the opposite of what one might expect, but it is technically convenient.

For each state ''k'', the increase in occupation probability depends on the contribution from all other states to ''k'', and is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_\ell A_{k\ell}P_\ell, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; P_\ell &lt;/math&gt; is the probability for the system to be in the state &lt;math&gt; \ell &lt;/math&gt;, while the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is filled with a grid of transition-rate [[Constant (mathematics)|constant]]s.  Similarly, &lt;math&gt;P_k&lt;/math&gt; contributes to the occupation of all other states &lt;math&gt; P_\ell, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_\ell A_{\ell k}P_k, &lt;/math&gt;

In probability theory, this identifies the evolution as a [[continuous-time Markov process]], with the integrated master equation obeying a [[Chapman–Kolmogorov equation]].

The master equation can be simplified so that the terms with ''ℓ'' = ''k'' do not appear in the summation.  This allows calculations even if the main diagonal of the &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is not defined or has been assigned an arbitrary value.

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dP_k}{dt}
        =\sum_\ell(A_{k\ell}P_\ell)
        =\sum_{\ell\neq k}(A_{k\ell}P_\ell) + A_{kk}P_k
        =\sum_{\ell\neq k}(A_{k\ell}P_\ell - A_{\ell k}P_k). &lt;/math&gt;

The final equality arises from the fact that 
:&lt;math&gt;  \sum_{\ell, k}(A_{\ell k}P_k) = \frac{d}{dt} \sum_\ell(P_{\ell}) = 0 &lt;/math&gt; 
because the summation over the probabilities &lt;math&gt; P_{\ell} &lt;/math&gt; yields one, a constant function. Since this has to hold for any probability &lt;math&gt;\vec{P}&lt;/math&gt; (and in particular for any probability of the form &lt;math&gt; P_{\ell} = \delta_{\ell k}&lt;/math&gt; for some k) we get
:&lt;math&gt;  \sum_{\ell}(A_{\ell k}) =  0 \qquad \forall k.&lt;/math&gt; 
Using this we can write the diagonal elements as
:&lt;math&gt; A_{kk} = -\sum_{\ell\neq k}(A_{\ell k}) \Rightarrow A_{kk} P_k = -\sum_{\ell\neq k}(A_{\ell k} P_k) &lt;/math&gt;.

The master equation exhibits [[detailed balance]] if each of the terms of the summation disappears separately at equilibrium—i.e. if, for all states ''k'' and ''ℓ'' having equilibrium probabilities &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\pi_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\pi_\ell&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;A_{k \ell} \pi_\ell = A_{\ell k} \pi_k .&lt;/math&gt;

These symmetry relations were proved on the basis of the [[time reversibility]] of  microscopic dynamics ([[microscopic reversibility]]) as [[Onsager reciprocal relations]].

===Examples of master equations===
Many physical problems in [[classical mechanics|classical]], [[quantum mechanics]] and problems in other sciences, can be reduced to the form of a ''master equation'', thereby performing a great simplification of the problem (see [[mathematical model]]).

The [[Lindblad equation]] in [[quantum mechanics]] is a generalization of the master equation describing the time evolution of a [[density matrix]].  Though the Lindblad equation is often referred to as a ''master equation'', it is not one in the usual sense, as it governs not only the time evolution of probabilities (diagonal elements of the density matrix), but also of variables containing information about [[quantum coherence]] between the states of the system (non-diagonal elements of the density matrix).

Another special case of the master equation is the [[Fokker-Planck equation]] which describes the time evolution of a continuous probability distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Honerkamp|first1=Josef|title=Statistical physics : an advanced approach with applications ; with 7 tables and 57 problems with solutions|date=1998|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin [u.a.]|isbn=978-3-540-63978-7|pages=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complicated master equations which resist analytic treatment can be cast into this form (under various approximations), by using approximation techniques such as the [[system size expansion]].

Stochastic chemical kinetics are yet another example of the Master equation. A chemical Master equation is used to model a set of chemical reactions when the number of molecules of one or more species is small (of the order of 100 or 1000 molecules).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gupta|first=Ankur|last2=Rawlings|first2=James B.|date=Apr 2014|title=Comparison of Parameter Estimation Methods in Stochastic Chemical Kinetic Models: Examples in Systems Biology|journal=AIChE Journal|volume=60|issue=4|pages=1253–1268|doi=10.1002/aic.14409|issn=0001-1541|pmc=4946376|pmid=27429455}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quantum master equations ==

A [[quantum master equation]] is a generalization of the idea of a master equation. Rather than just a system of differential equations for a set of probabilities (which only constitutes the diagonal elements of a [[density matrix]]), quantum master equations are differential equations for the entire density matrix, including off-diagonal elements. A density matrix with only diagonal elements can be modeled as a classical random process, therefore such an "ordinary" master equation is considered classical. Off-diagonal elements represent [[quantum coherence]] which is a physical characteristic that is intrinsically quantum mechanical.

The [[Redfield equation]] and [[Lindblad equation]] are examples of approximate [[quantum master equation]]s assumed to be [[Markov process|Markovian]]. More accurate quantum master equations for certain applications include the polaron transformed quantum master equation, and the [[VPQME]] (variational polaron transformed quantum master equation).&lt;ref name=McCutcheon&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McCutcheon |first1=D. |last2=Dattani |first2=N.

The '''missionary position''' or '''man-on-top position''' is a [[sex position]] in which generally&lt;!--NOTE: The word "generally" adds neutrality to the sentence, as the sources (which are what we defer to with WP:Due weight) usually describe this sex position as heterosexual.

The missionary position may involve [[sexual penetration]] or [[non-penetrative sex]] (for example, [[intercrural sex]]), and its penile-vaginal aspect is an example of ventro-ventral (front-to-front) [[Reproduction|reproductive]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dixson |first=Alan F. |year=1998 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r56ov450wbEC&amp;dq=dorso-ventral+copulation&amp;q=page+113#v=snippet&amp;q=missionary&amp;f=false |title=Primate Sexuality: Comparative Studies of the Prosimians, Monkeys, Apes, and Human Beings |publisher= ([[Oxford University Press]] |location= Oxford, England| page=113 |isbn= 978-0-19-850182-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variations of the position allow varying degrees of [[Clitoris|clitoral stimulation]], depth of penetration, participation on the part of the woman, and the likelihood and speed of [[orgasm]].

It is commonly believed that the term ''missionary position'' arose in connection with English-speaking [[Christian]] [[Mission (Christianity)|missionaries]], who supposedly encouraged the sexual position in new [[conversion to Christianity|converts]] in the [[History of colonialism|colonial era]].&lt;ref name="RobertsPadgett-Yawn1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Amanda|last2=Padgett-Yawn|first2=Barbara|title=Reader's Digest Guide to Love &amp; Sex|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gY_15m_TKdAC|accessdate=27 July 2015|year=1998|publisher=Reader's Digest Association|isbn=9780762100439|quote=The missionary position is so called because it was allegedly the sexual position recommended by Christian missionaries to their Polynesian converts in the era of European colonialism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term probably originated from [[Alfred Kinsey]]'s ''[[Kinsey Reports|Sexual Behavior in the Human Male]]'' through a confluence of misunderstandings and misinterpretations of historical documents.&lt;ref name="Cecil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/050617.html |title=Assuming the missionary position… again |date=2005-06-17 |work=The [[Straight Dope]] |publisher=[[Cecil Adams]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid14992209"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Priest |first=Robert J. |title=Missionary Positions: Christian, Modernist, and Postmodernist |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=42 |issue=1 |year=2001 |doi=10.1086/318433 |pages=29–68 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |pmid=14992209}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French refer to it as the 'classical' position.

''Human Sexuality, Ethnoculture, and Social Work''. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the [[romance (love)|romantic aspects]] of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction.&lt;ref name="shr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sexual-health-resource.org/sex_positions/missionary_position.html |title=Sex Position – Missionary / The Man-on-Top Position |publisher=sexual-health-resource.org |accessdate=February 2, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511214239/http://www.sexual-health-resource.org/sex_positions/missionary_position.html |archivedate=May 11, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of [[pelvic thrusting]]. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs. The position is less suitable for late stages of [[pregnancy]], or when it is desired for the woman to have greater control over rhythm and depth of penetration.

==Etymology and other usage==
Before the release of Alfred Kinsey's work, the missionary position was known by several names, including ''the matrimonial'', ''the Mama-Papa position'', ''the English-American position'', and ''the male superior position''.&lt;ref name="Priest, 31"&gt;Priest, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, Kinsey published the male volume of the [[Kinsey Reports]], ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Male''. He described the American preference for the position and called it ''the English-American position''. Discussing [[Bronisław Malinowski|Malinowski's]] ''The Sexual Life of Savages in North-Western Melanesia'', Kinsey wrote, "It will be recalled that Malinowski (1929) records the nearly universal use of a totally different position among the [[Trobrianders]] ... [and] ... that caricatures of the English-American position are performed around ... campfires, to the great amusement of the natives who refer to the position as the 'missionary position.'"&lt;ref name="Priest, 31"/&gt; To date, lexicographers and sexologists have not found use of the term ''missionary position'' before Kinsey.&lt;ref&gt;Priest, 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Robert Priest examined the origins of the term and concluded that Kinsey had confused several factors in accidentally coining the term.&lt;ref name="Priest, 31"/&gt; First, according to Malinowski, Trobrianders played and sang mocking songs under the full moon, and not around a campfire. In ''Sexual Behaviors'', Kinsey wrote that the Trobrianders mocked face-to-face man-on-top woman-below intercourse, but does not give context. He mentioned that the position was learned from "white traders, planters, or officials", but does not discuss missionaries. Kinsey also recalled that the medieval Catholic Church taught the position, and upon seeing the natives mocking it, assumed that missionaries had taught it to them. Finally, Malinowski wrote that he saw an engaged Trobriand couple holding hands and leaning against each other, which the natives described as ''misinari si bubunela''—the ''missionary fashion''. Upon accidentally combining these similar facts, Kinsey invented a new phrase despite believing that he was reporting an old one.&lt;ref name="Priest, 31"/&gt;

From then on, the story of the name's origin may have been retold until it became largely accepted, with its connection to Kinsey and Malinowski having faded. Writers began using the expression for sexual intercourse in the late 1960s, and as [[Alex Comfort]]'s bestseller ''[[The Joy of Sex]]'' (1972) and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (1976) spread the term ''missionary position'', it gradually replaced older names.&lt;ref&gt;Priest, 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1990s, it had spread to other languages: ''Missionarsstellung'' ([[German language|German]]), ''postura del misionero'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]), ''missionarishouding'' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]) and ''position du missionaire'' ([[French language|French]]).&lt;ref name="Priest, 31"/&gt;

In [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Othello]]'' (Act 1, Scene 1), the missionary position was [[euphemism|euphemistically]] called [[Beast with two backs|"the beast with two backs"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/play_view.php?WorkID=othello&amp;Act=1&amp;Scene=1&amp;Scope=scene|title=Othello, Act I, Scene 1 :-: Open Source Shakespeare|website=www.opensourceshakespeare.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
[[File:Wiki-missionary.png|thumb|Basic position involves [[ventral]]-ventral contact]]
Though there are a number of variations and adoptions of the missionary position, the classic missionary position involves a man and a woman, with the woman lying on her back and the man on top. Variations in the positions may vary the angle and depth of penile penetration.

===Basic position===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2014}}
In the missionary position, a woman lies on her back on a bed or other surface with her legs comfortably spread with the soles of the feet resting. The penetrating partner may approach the woman on his knees between her spread legs; and either uses his arms to hold himself up, or lets his weight rest on her. When the woman's vagina is sufficiently lubricated, which may involve [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]] her [[vulva]] or [[clitoris]] in particular, the man will level his erect penis with her vagina for [[sexual penetration|penetration]], and may use fingers to open the woman's labia and guide the penis in.

With the penis inside the woman's vagina, the man can control the force, depth, pace, and rhythm of [[Pelvic thrust|thrusts]], and can also control to some extent the female partner's movements. Subject to the man's weight and position, the woman may have some control by pushing her feet and legs against the mattress and by side movements in her pelvis as well as by clutching onto and moving with her partner.&lt;ref name="Kar"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Nilamadhab |last1=Kar |first2=Gopal Chandra |last2=Kar| title = Comprehensive Textbook of Sexual Medicine | publisher = [[Jaypee Brothers| Jaypee Brothers Publishers]]|pages=107–108| isbn = 8180614050|year=2005| accessdate = February 10, 2014 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=YxcjMPbGHQIC&amp;pg=PA107}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A woman can increase the force of a man's thrust by moving against the man's rhythm.

The man may straddle the woman, taking the woman's legs between his. This restricts and further controls the woman's movements, and the man can increase the tightness on the penis by pressing the woman's thighs together. However, this increases vaginal friction and makes thrusting more difficult.

During sexual intercourse, most women experience involuntary [[vaginal contraction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8174183 |year=1994 |last1=Kratochvíl |first1=S |title=Vaginal contractions in female orgasm |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=28–33 |journal=Ceskoslovenska psychiatrie}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contraction causes the [[pelvic muscles]] to tighten around the penis, which increases the level of her partner's arousal and sexual frenzy and results in the man increasing the pace and force of thrusts as he approaches orgasm, which in turn further increases the woman's vaginal contraction. After a man has achieved orgasm, he will normally collapse onto the woman and will normally not be capable of further thrusting. Some men try to control their orgasm until their female partner also orgasms, but this is not always achieved. At times, a woman can achieve orgasm after the man has ceased thrusting by contracting her vaginal muscles and with pelvic movements, or the couple may change to another position that enables the woman to continue thrusting until she has reached orgasm, such as a [[woman on top]] position.

During sexual intercourse in the missionary position, the penis is in preferential contact with the [[Anterior#Superior and inferior|anterior]] wall of the vagina and the tip of the penis reaches the [[Fornix of the vagina|anterior fornix]], while in the rear-entry position it is in preferential contact with the posterior wall of the vagina and probably reaches the posterior fornix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of Sexual Intercourse: Second Experience in Missionary Position and Initial Experience in Posterior Position |journal=Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy |volume=28 |pages=63–76 |year=2002 |doi=10.1080/00926230252851203 |author1=A.

===Position of legs===
[[File:Édouard-Henri Avril (13).jpg|left|thumb|Raising legs allows for deep penetration]]
A receiving woman's legs and arms are generally free to move about, though her position and movement may be constrained by the penetrating partner's weight and in some other way. A woman can adjust the position of her legs for comfort, variety and to control the angle and depth of penetration. Generally, the higher a woman's legs, the deeper is the penetration. When the legs are raised in any way, the woman has less control of the rhythm of thrusts. Also, raising the legs raises the woman's pelvis, reduces the angle of penetration, and lowers the level of clitoral stimulation.

A woman's legs can remain flat or raised toward her chest, or wrapped around the penetrating partner at various heights: at the back of the legs, at the buttocks or back or over the shoulders, in a position called the ''Wiener Auster'' or Viennese oyster.&lt;ref&gt;''Lexikon der Erotik'' by Lykke Aresin and Kurt Starke. Droemer-Knaur, 1996. {{ISBN|3-426-77174-8}}, p.597.&lt;/ref&gt; In the higher leg positions the woman's legs may need some support, which may be achieved by crossing the ankles behind the partner or resting on his shoulders. She may also hold them with her hands or cross her arms around them at the knees. Some are flexible enough to cross the legs behind their heads. Alternatively, her partner may hold her legs up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.babymed.com/sex-positions/viennese-oyster-sex-position|title=Viennese Oyster - Sex Position - BabyMed.com|date=18 November 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separating straight legs carry the risk of [[muscle pull]] of thigh muscles. The laying by the partner on raised legs puts excessive pressure on the woman's back.

A pillow or [[sex pillow]] (especially a firm one) can be used,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hutcherson |first=Hilda |title=What Your Mother Never Told You About Sex |publisher=Perigee Trade |year=2003 |isbn=0-399-52853-9 |page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; to alter the depth and angle of penetration. A wedge- or ramp-shaped pillow can relieve pressure on the top person's hands and arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blowfish.com/catalog/toys/cushions.html |title=Blowfish Sex Cushions |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Placing a pillow under the woman's buttocks can lift her pelvis—a ''[[Playboy]]'' article suggested placing it under her hips to increase pressure on the clitoris.&lt;ref name="MissionaryRevival"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jones, Kelly |url=http://www.playboy.com/sex/featuresLL/missionary/missionary.html |title=The Missionary Revival |publisher=Playboy |accessdate=2008-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026095344/http://www.playboy.com/sex/featuresLL/missionary/missionary.html |archivedate=2007-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these methods can increase the depth of penetration. Raising the clitoris generally allows easier access to it in this position. Using a pillow can also help the woman arch her back and avoid backache.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.have-better-sex.com/Sex-Positions-1 |title=Variations on a Theme - Him on Top Sex Positions |publisher=Better Sex |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one variant, the woman may lift and slightly bend her legs, resting her feet flat on the mattress. This shortens the distance between the [[vagina]] and [[cervix]], and may apply more friction to the area termed the ''[[G-Spot]].''{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} The woman may find this more comfortable than the standard position,&lt;ref name="AddSpice"&gt;{{cite web |author=Strovny, David |url=http://www.askmen.com/dating/love_tip/47_love_tip.html |title=Add Spice to the Missionary Position |publisher=AskMen |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it can allow her to push against the man's thrust, giving her some control over the rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wright, Susan |title=Driving Your Woman Wild in Bed: A Man's Guide to Satisfying Women |isbn=0-8065-2430-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Placing the woman's legs on or over the man's shoulders provides the deepest possible penetration. This variant is sometimes called ''the anvil''.&lt;ref name="LoversGuide"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loversguide.com/man-on-top-sex-positions-enhancing-the-missionary-position.html |title=Man-on-top sex positions: enhancing the missionary position |publisher=The Lovers' Guide |accessdate=2008-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This position aims the head of the penis at the [[vaginal fornix]] (posterior fornix). When the legs are held mid-level in this way, the penis can achieve significant depth while attempting to stimulate the G-Spot and achieving more friction on the top of its shaft.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

===Viennese oyster position===
[[File:Wiki-Wiener-auster.png|right|thumb|A woman in the ''Wiener Auster'' (Viennese oyster) position]]
The Viennese oyster position requires great flexibility from the woman to perform. The female lies on her back and moves her legs behind her head, with the groin area being completely exposed. The male partner penetrates the vagina from the top. This is a deep penetrating position and may not be suitable for men with larger than average penis size. However, in most cases, the female will not be flexible enough to achieve this position fully, and will need to stop well before the legs are behind the head. If that is the case, the male partner can help hold the legs in a comfortable position and continue on with intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;BabyMed [http://www.babymed.com/sex-positions/viennese-oyster-sex-position Viennese Oyster - Sex Position]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Butterfly position===
[[File:Édouard-Henri Avril (12).jpg|thumb|A woman in the butterfly position]]
The woman can lie on her back with her hips on the edge of a platform such as a bed, table, kitchen bench, desk, etc.&lt;ref name="coville"&gt;Nafzawi, Muhammad ibn Muhammad al, and Jim Colville (trans.). ''The Perfumed Garden of Sensual Delight''. The Kegan Paul Arabia library, vol. 7. London: Kegan Paul, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; while the man penetrates her while standing. The woman can move her body freely. She can dangle her legs over the edge or raise them to any height or manner mentioned above. The woman can rest her legs on the man or he can hold them or separate them. The woman has a greater ability to move her pelvis and to arch her back, and the man can raise, support or  restrict the movement of her pelvis. The woman is not weighed down by the man's weight. This position, sometimes called the ''butterfly position'', adds variety to the angle and depth of penetration and generally enables the man to withdraw and then fully thrust the penis, with faster and more forceful thrusts. The downside of this position is that the angle of penetration results in reduced [[Sexual stimulation|clitoral stimulation]], and the woman may need direct clitoral [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]], either by herself or by the man, to achieve orgasm. Alternatively, the woman may either arch her back or raise her torso onto her elbows or arms to reduce the angle and enhance clitoral stimulation. Also, prior to and after the man's orgasm, the man may need to lie down on the woman.

===Riding high===
{{See also|Coital alignment technique}}
In the riding high missionary variant, the man enters the woman and then shifts his body up and forward toward her head. He then rocks back and forth, stimulating her clitoris with his pelvic bone, or base of his penis. This results in more consistent clitoral stimulation at the cost of a man's deep thrusting; accordingly, some men prefer to use it during only part of sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Moore |first=Kira |url=http://www.savvymiss.com/love-advice/sex-advice/sex-sex-sex-archive/article/rethink-the-missionary-position-three-ways-to-spice-up-a-classic-4383/page-browse/1/sspn//8ac9f9dfdf.html |title=Rethink the Missionary Position: Three Ways to Spice up a Classic |publisher=Savvy Miss |accessdate=2008-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20071224001208/http://www.savvymiss.com/love-advice/sex-advice/sex-sex-sex-archive/article/rethink-the-missionary-position-three-ways-to-spice-up-a-classic-4383/page-browse/1/sspn//8ac9f9dfdf.html |archivedate=2007-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anal sex, tribadism and other aspects===
&lt;!-- NOTE: This section combines these matters because, per MOS:PARAGRAPHS, "Short paragraphs and single sentences generally do not warrant their own subheading."  --&gt;
{{Double image|right|Wiki-anal missionary.png|180|Wiki-tribadism02.png|180|Two men engaged in the missionary position during anal sex; two women engaged in the missionary position during tribadism}}
Penetrative [[anal sex]] may be performed on a partner in the missionary position.&lt;ref name="Alice"/&gt; The legs may be raised high, with the knees drawn towards their chest, and with some sort of support (such as a pillow) under the receiver's hips for comfort and to raise the receiver's buttocks. The penetrating partner positions himself between the receiver's legs and aligns his penis with the anus for anal penetration. Instead of penetration, an active partner may perform [[anilingus]] on the partner with raised legs.

[[Tribadism]] between women may be performed in the missionary position.&lt;ref name="Hite, Tribadism"&gt;{{cite book | first = Shere| last = Hite |author-link=Shere Hite | title = The Hite Report: A Nationwide Study of Female Sexuality | publisher = [[Seven Stories Press]] | year = 2004 | location=New York, NY | isbn = 1583225692| page=322 | accessdate = 2 March 2012 | url =https://books.google.com/?id=s3OZaVn2wfkC&amp;pg=PA322&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schell"&gt;{{cite book|author =Jude Schell|title =Lesbian Sex: 101 Lovemaking Positions|isbn =0-495-60274-4|publisher=[[Random House|Random House Digital]]|year=2008|pages=224 pages|accessdate=November 4, 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JHVndzmgDmYC&amp;pg=PP18&amp;dq=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice involves women rubbing their vulvas against each other.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"&gt;{{cite book|title =Exploring the Dimensions of Human Sexuality|id = 9780763741488|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|year=2007|page=429|accessdate=2010-12-19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZdYh_iFZvbkC&amp;pg=PA429&amp;dq=Lesbians+and+tribadism#v=onepage&amp;q=Lesbians%20and%20tribadism&amp;f=false|isbn =0-7637-4148-5|author1=Jerrold S.

==Perceived advantages and disadvantages==

===Psychological===

There are many appealing psychological aspects of the missionary position. It is often regarded as a romantic position because the two partners face each other and may maintain eye contact; there is potentially a greater amount of skin-to-skin contact than in any other position; and the couple can hold each other in their arms, which can easily segue into cuddling when sex is over.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Partners may engage in other intimate contact, such as kissing, or guiding each other's hips with their hands.&lt;ref name="BestLove"&gt;{{cite web |author=Cynthia Perkins |url=http://www.smolderingembers.com/missionary-sex-position.html |title=The Missionary Sex Position |publisher=Best Love Making Positions and Techniques |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sextherapyinphiladelphia.com/sexual-positions/ |title=Sexual Positions |publisher=Sex Therapy in Philadelphia |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Aly Walansky |url=http://www.askmen.com/dating/love_tip/59_love_tip.html |title=Sexual Positions Women Enjoy |publisher=AskMen |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the woman needs a high level of trust in the man on top who is in a dominant position vis-a-vis the woman below. Once the man is in place, he is very difficult to dislodge without his co-operation. With the man's weight on the woman, especially on her pelvis, the man has control of the rhythm and depth of his thrusts, in the most sexually sensitive part of her body.&lt;ref name="Colombia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colombialink.com/01_INDEX/index_sexualidad/sexuality/sexual_positions/21_missionary_position.html |title=The Missionary Position |publisher=Sexual Health Center |accessdate=2008-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020052524/http://www.colombialink.com/01_INDEX/index_sexualidad/sexuality/sexual_positions/21_missionary_position.html |archivedate=2007-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical===
The missionary position is commonly used the first time a couple has sex. Thomas Stuttaford notes that it may be more comfortable to do so: "The discomfort of early penetrative sex, if there is any, is usually related to tension in the pelvic or thigh muscles and/or anxiety that has prevented the usual vaginal lubrication. Muscles of the pelvic floor are more relaxed if, initially, the missionary position is chosen and a couple of pillows are arranged under the woman's bottom so her hips are tilted upwards."&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;Stuttaford, Thomas (October 6, 2007).

On the other hand, Sacha Tarkovsky advises women to not use the missionary position when having sex for the first time, stating, "You are not in control, and it will be more painful and you cannot do anything but lay {{sic}} there and take it." Tarkovsky recommends positions such as [[woman on top]] that allow the woman to control the speed and pressure at which she loses her [[hymen]].&lt;ref&gt;Tarkovsky, Sascha.

According to Sexual Health Resource, "The man-on-top sex positions are very good for couples who are trying to have a baby, because penetration can be very deep. If the woman holds on to her legs behind her knees and draws her thighs right back, sperm can be deposited deep in the vagina—at the neck of the womb. This provided the best chance of conception occurring."&lt;ref name="shr"/&gt; ''Getting Pregnant Tips'' notes the importance of not using too large a sex pillow while in the missionary position as it can cause the sperm to pool behind the cervix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getting-pregnant-tips.com/best-position-to-get-pregnant.html |title=What is the best position to get pregnant? |publisher=Getting Pregnant Tips |accessdate=2008-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703183013/http://www.getting-pregnant-tips.com/best-position-to-get-pregnant.html |archivedate=2008-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Francoeur states that "male-above sex promotes fertility by keeping the opening of the vagina higher than the seminal pool, which, in turn, helps sperm get into the womb and find the egg."&lt;ref name="Francoeur"/&gt; However, according to BabyCenter, "There is no evidence that any particular sexual position is more likely to lead to conception."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=BabyCenter |date=May 2007 |url=http://www.babycenter.com/0_sex-positions-for-baby-making_1812.bc |title=Sexual positions for baby-making |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donnica Moore]] agrees, stating that while there are no scientific studies regarding the best sexual positions for reproduction, the missionary (man on top) position is typically considered optimal for conception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mann, Denise |year=2005 |url=http://www.webmd.com/infertility-and-reproduction/features/truth-about-sexual-positions-getting-pregnant |title=The Truth About Sexual Positions and Getting Pregnant |publisher=[[WebMD]] |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a woman should avoid lying flat on her back after the fourth month of pregnancy, because the weight of the growing uterus puts pressure on major blood vessels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marchofdimes.org/pregnancy/sex-during-pregnancy.aspx |title=Sex During Pregnancy |publisher=March of Dimes |accessdate=2014-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Port states, "Beginning early in the second trimester, doctors tend to discourage pregnant women from supine exercise.

The deep penetration and large hip thrusts of the missionary position can cause the man to reach orgasm quickly compared to other positions, which can be problematic if the couple seeks to reach simultaneous orgasm.&lt;ref name="PregnantStore"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pregnantstore.com/SexualPositionsGuide-ManOnTop.html |title=Man on Top Sexual Positions |publisher=Pregnant Store |accessdate=2008-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715143950/http://www.pregnantstore.com/SexualPositionsGuide-ManOnTop.html |archivedate=July 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The male reaching orgasm first can be disruptive to sex, as 50% of penile erection is lost immediately after ejaculation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mckinley.illinois.edu/Handouts/male_function_dysfunction.html |title=Male Sexual Function/Dysfunction |publisher=McKinley Health Center |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; making him more likely to inadvertently slip out of the vagina, especially during the strong pelvic contractions of female orgasm. In addition to the standard [[Premature ejaculation#Treatment|methods for treating premature ejaculation]], Zachary Veilleux notes that this problem can be overcome by workarounds such as changing positions frequently (which studies have shown delays male orgasm by a factor of 2-3), using lubrication to reduce friction (friction stimulates the male but is not as important in female orgasm), or switching to cunnilingus for a while when close to ejaculation, and then switching back when ejaculation is no longer imminent.&lt;ref name="Synch"&gt;{{cite web|author=Veilleux, Zachary |url=http://www.menshealthsa.co.za/index.php?cat=1186&amp;art_id=908 |title=Sychronized Schwinging |publisher=Men's Health |accessdate=2008-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416182848/http://www.menshealthsa.co.za/index.php?cat=1186 |archivedate=April 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The missionary position is sometimes mocked as a plain [[vanilla sex]] position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saferinjecting.net/sex-kinky.htm |title=But isn't that kinky?: sex in the animal kingdom |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archer stated, "To all the sex gymnasts, this kind of banal preference looks lazy, unimaginative and uninformed," but she rebuts this by pointing out the existence of variations: "Missionary is kind of like tofu: You have to add your own flavor."&lt;ref name="Archer"&gt;{{cite web |author=Archer, Rebecca |year=2002 |url=http://www.nerve.com/PersonalEssays/Archer/MissionaryPosition/ |title=In Praise of the Missionary Position |publisher=Nerve |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps due to the ubiquity of this position, its typical role as the first position used by couples, its tendency to put the man in control of speed, tempo and depth, its ability to cause him to quickly reach orgasm, and the fact that it is literally a "male-superior" position with the man on top, missionary is sometimes associated with men who are dominating and uncreative and selfish about sex. According to Gina Ogden, "the cultural missionary position—man on top" is not conducive to romance since "If a relationship is based on authoritarian control, keeping one person on top and the other underneath, it gets old pretty fast—for both partners, really".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Peres, Judy |date=2008-11-17 |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-11-17/news/0711170033_1_sexual-satisfaction-satisfaction-and-greater-relationship-stronger-romantic-relationships |title=Study: Feminists are better mates |publisher=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Women Who Love Sex'', Ogden writes, "Think what will happen to the missionary position when women, en masse, opt for pleasures that stir body and soul instead of continuing to do good-girl intercourse by the book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ogden, Gina |date=September 1999 |title=Women Who Love Sex |publisher=Womanspirit Press |isbn=978-0-9672705-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Chinua Achebe's ''[[Things Fall Apart]]'', the main character ridicules the idea of women making decisions by saying that one might as well say that the woman lies on top of the man when they are making the baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Achebe, Chinua |title=Things Fall Apart |isbn=0-7660-2831-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The missionary position has potential for clitoral stimulation in several ways. Christakos assures, "This position can give the woman plenty of clitoral stimulation if the man leans forward thus rubbing his pelvic bone against her clitoris."&lt;ref name="Christakos"&gt;Christakos, Caterina.

Sexual activity in the missionary position, as a form of physical exercise, may be slightly more vigorous for the man than in other positions. A study conducted by Bohlen et al. found that "man-on-top coitus required more metabolic expenditure than woman-on-top coitus" and that the heart rate during man-on-top sex was higher than in self-stimulation, partner stimulation, or woman-on-top.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Rerkpattanapipat, P. |date=February 2001 |url=http://eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org/content/ehj/22/3/201.full.pdf |format=PDF |title=Sex and the heart: what is the role of the cardiologist? |publisher=Oxford Journals |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, one study showed that there was no difference in heart rate or blood pressure when comparing these two basic positions, while another showed only a minor decrease in oxygen consumption or exertion with the 'man-on-bottom' technique during orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Schwarz |first1=E.R. |last2=Rodriguez |first2=J. |year=2005 |url=http://www.nature.com/ijir/journal/v17/n1s/full/3901422a.html |title=Sex and the heart |publisher=International Journal of Impotence Research |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canongate. Retrieved on January 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; But Francoeur states that the ancient Chinese preferred male-on-top because of their belief that males are born face down and women face up. Kagaba natives in Colombia preferred missionary because of the stability it offers; they believed that if the woman moved during intercourse, the earth would slip off the shoulders of the four giants who held it up above the waters.&lt;ref name="Francoeur"/&gt; Some [[Kerala]] tribes believe that the male-on-top position is the only way to conceive warriors.&lt;ref name="Francoeur"/&gt;

In ancient Greece, the missionary position was originally an unpopular position. Beds existed, yet not as we know them today, and men married girls 14 or 15 years of age, which created a height differential. These factors made the rear-entry standing position more convenient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tarkovsky, Sacha|title=Sex in Ancient Greece Views Towards Sex Positions}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, circa the second century, Artemidos popularized the missionary position among Greco-Roman Stoics, declaring it "the only proper and natural" position due to the flow of [[semen]].

Although the Bible does not mention sexual positions, from the 6th to 16th centuries, some Church authorities taught that intercourse should be face-to-face, man-on-top, primarily because they believed that semen flows with gravity, leading to conception.&lt;ref name="pmid14992209"/&gt; Exceptions were made for couples dealing with illness, obesity, or pregnancy. According to John Bancroft's ''Human Sexuality and Its Problems'', [[Thomas Aquinas]] believed that crimes against nature included intercourse in "unnatural" ways. Protestants did not communicate proper sex positions, and the Catholic Church eventually abandoned its discourse on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;Priest, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simon Hardy]] wrote that the missionary position was used to distinguish "bestial and civilized sex."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hardy |first=Simon |title=The Greeks, Eroticism and Ourselves |journal=Sexualities |volume=7 |issue=2 |year=2004 |issn=1363-4607 |doi=10.1177/1363460704042164 |page =201 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others who held that missionary was the only permitted position included [[Alexander of Hales]] and the author of ''De secretis mulierum'',{{Clarify|date=March 2008}} who suggested that nonstandard positions might result in birth defects.&lt;ref&gt;Brundage, James A. ''Law, sex, and Christian society in medieval Europe''.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruth Mazo Karras states that [[William Peraldus]]' treatise ''Summa de virtutibus et vitiis'' distinguished between sins against nature that were "according to the substance" (intercourse other than vaginal) and "according to the manner, as when a woman mounts."&lt;ref&gt;Karras, Ruth Mazo. ''Sexuality in Medieval Europe: Doing Unto Others''. p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas Venette's 1770s-era sex manual praised the missionary position as the "common posture...which is most allowable and most voluptuous."&lt;ref&gt;Trumbach, Randolph. ''Sex and the Gender Revolution''. p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous sources have reported that in the [[United States]], some states had outlawed positions other than missionary between husband and wife, or will grant a divorce to a woman whose husband makes love to her in another position. While many states formerly outlawed [[oral sex]], [[anal sex]], [[buggery]], or other "unnatural" acts, no US law has banned dorso-ventral heterosexual sex, or specified which partner needed to be on top.&lt;ref&gt;Priest, 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John D'Emilio|D'Emilio]] and [[Estelle Freedman|Freedman]], who are historians of sexuality, note that historical use of the missionary position in the US is marked by social class as well as ethnicity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/783150238|title=Intimate matters : a history of sexuality in America|last=D'Emilio|first=John|last2=Freedman|first2=Estelle|publisher=University of Chicago Press|others=|year=2012|isbn=9780226923802|edition= Third|location=Chicago, IL|pages=|at=|oclc=783150238}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, white settlers and Protestant missionaries who moved West attempted to assimilate Native American, Mexican, and immigrant peoples into the sexual values held by the middle classes in the American north. These authors also note that the Kinsey studies revealed social class influences, with working class men preferring to use the missionary position over other sexual positions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Molecular processors are currently in their infancy and currently only a few exist. At present a basic molecular processor is any biological or chemical system that uses a [[complementary DNA]] (cDNA) template to form a long chain [[amino acid]] molecule. A key factor that differentiates molecular processors is "the ability to control output" of [[protein]] or [[peptide]] concentration as a function of time. Simple formation of a molecule becomes the task of a chemical reaction, bioreactor or other polymerization technology. Current molecular processors take advantage of cellular processes to produce amino acide based proteins and peptides. The formation of a molecular processor currently involves integrating cDNA into the [[genome]] and should not replicate and re-insert, or be defined as a [[virus]] after insertion. Current molecular processors are replication incompetent, non-communicable and cannot be transmitted from cell to cell, animal to animal or human to human. All must have a method to terminate if implanted. The most effective methodology for insertion of cDNA (template with control mechanism) uses capsid technology to insert a payload into the genome. A viable molecular processor is one that dominates cellular function by re-task and or reassignment but does not terminate the cell. It will continuously produce protein or produce on demand and have method to regulate dosage if qualifying as a "drug delivery" molecular processor. Potential applications range from up-regulation of functional [[Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator|CFTR]] in [[Cystic Fibrosis]] and Hemoglobin in Sickle Cell Anemia to [[angiogenesis]] in cardiovascular [[stenosis]] to account for protein deficiency (used in gene therapy.)

==Example==
A vector inserted to form a molecular processor is described in part. The objective was to promote angiogenesis, blood vessel formation and improve cardiovasculature. [[Vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.2479986|title=Vascular endothelial growth factor is a secreted angiogenic mitogen|pmid=2479986|year=1989|last1=Leung|first1=D.|last2=Cachianes|first2=G|last3=Kuang|first3=W.|last4=Goeddel|first4=D.|last5=Ferrara|first5=N|journal=Science|volume=246|issue=4935|pages=1306–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and enhanced [[green fluorescent protein]] (EGFP) cDNA was ligated to either side of an internal ribosomal re-entry site (IRES) to produce inline production of both the VEGF and EGFP proteins. After in vitro insertion and quantification&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0166-0934(98)00166-9|pmid=10204701|title=Rapid feline immunodeficiency virus provirus quantitation by polymerase chain reaction using the TaqMan fluorogenic real-time detection system|first9=H|last9=Lutz|first8=WH|last8=Guenzburg|first7=F|last7=Boretti|first6=J|last6=Böni|first5=U|last5=Hummel|first4=C|last4=Mislin|first3=R|last3=Hofmann-Lehmann|first2=D|year=1999|last2=Klein|last1=Leutenegger|first1=C|journal=Journal of Virological Methods|volume=78|issue=1–2|pages=105–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; of integrating units (IUs), engineered cells produce a bioluminescent marker and a chemotactic growth factor. In this instance, increased fluorescence of EGFP is used to show VEGF production in individual cells with active molecular processors. The production was exponential in nature and regulated through use of an integrating promoter, cell numbers, the number of integrated units (IUs) of molecular processors and or cell numbers. The measure the molecular processors efficacy was performed by FC/FACS to indirectly measure VEGF through fluorescence intensity. Proof of functional molecular processing was quantified by ELISA to show VEGF effect through chemotactic and angiogenesis models. The result involved directed assembly and coordination of [[Endothelium|endothelial]] cells for tubule formation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10049660|year=1999|last1=Vernon|first1=RB|last2=Sage|first2=EH|title=A novel, quantitative model for study of endothelial cell migration and sprout formation within three-dimensional collagen matrices|volume=57|issue=2|pages=118–33|doi=10.1006/mvre.1998.2122|journal=Microvascular research}}&lt;/ref&gt; by engineered cells on endothelial cells. The research goes on to show implantation and VEGF with dosage capabilities to promote revascularization, validating mechanisms of molecular processor control.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Auger, PhD., Mesenchymal stromal cells as angiogenic cellular vectors for revascularizing the heart., 08.2006: PhD Thesis Publication available at Tulane University Library and through UMI Copyright 2006–2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''National Astronomical Observatory of Japan'''|国立天文台|kokuritsu tenmondai}} ('''NAOJ''') is an [[astronomy|astronomical]] research organisation comprising several facilities in [[Japan]], as well as an observatory in [[Hawaii]].  It was established in 1988 as an amalgamation of three existing research organizations - the [[Tokyo Astronomical Observatory]] of the [[University of Tokyo]], [[International Latitude Observatory of Mizusawa]], and a part of [[Research Institute of Atmospherics]] of [[Nagoya University]].

In the 2004 reform of national research organizations, NAOJ became a division of the [[National Institutes of Natural Sciences, Japan|National Institutes of Natural Sciences]].

An '''ootheca''' {{IPAc-en|oʊ|.|ə|ˈ|θ|iː|k|ə}} (pl. ''oothecae''  {{IPAc-en|oʊ|.|ə|ˈ|θ|iː|s|iː}}) is a type of [[Egg (biology)|egg]] mass made by any member of a variety of species including [[Mollusca|mollusks]] (such as ''[[Turbinella laevigata]]''), [[Mantidae|mantises]], and [[cockroach]]es.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=BRUNET|first=P.

The word is a Latinized combination of ''oo-'', meaning "egg", from the Greek word ''ōon'' (cf. Latin ''[[ovum]]''), and ''theca'', meaning a "cover" or "container", from the Greek ''theke''. Ootheke is Greek for [[ovary]].

Oothecae are made up of structural [[protein]]s and tanning agents that cause the protein to harden around the eggs, providing protection and stability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The production of ootheca convergently evolved across numerous insect species due to a selection for protection from parasites and other forms of predation, as the complex structure of the shell casing provides an evolutionary reproductive advantage&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; (although the fitness and lifespan also depend on other factors such as the temperature of the incubating ootheca&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tee|first=Hui-Siang|last2=Lee|first2=Chow-Yang|date=2017-02-01|title=Influences of Temperature and Ootheca Age on the Life History of the Cockroach Ootheca Parasitoid Aprostocetus hagenowii (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae)|url=https://academic.oup.com/jee/article/110/1/213/2744810|journal=Journal of Economic Entomology|volume=110|issue=1|pages=213–220|doi=10.1093/jee/tow287|issn=0022-0493}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Oothecae are most notably found in the orders [[Blattodea]] (Cockroaches) and [[Mantodea]] (Praying mantids), as well as in the subfamilies [[Cassidinae]] (Coleoptera) and [[Korinninae]] (Phasmatodea). &lt;ref&gt;https://www.amentsoc.org/insects/glossary/terms/ootheca&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nature.com/articles/srep07825&lt;/ref&gt;

The ootheca protects the eggs from [[microorganisms]], [[parasitoids]], [[Predation|predators]], and weather; the ootheca maintains a stable water balance through variation in its surface, as it is porous in dry climates to protect against [[desiccation]], and smooth in wet climates to protect against oversaturation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keller|first=Laurent|date=1998-03-01|title=The Evolution of Social Behavior in Insects and Arachnids.

The '''plateau effect''' is a force of nature that lessens the effectiveness of once effective measures over time. An example of the plateau effect is when someone's exercise fails to be as effective as in the past, similar to the concept of [[diminishing returns]]. A person enters into a period where there is no improvement or a decrease in performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Honeybourne|first=John, Michael Hill &amp; Helen Moors|title=Physical Education and Sport for AS-level|year=2000|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=0-7487-5303-6|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nitti|first=Joseph T., Kimberlie Nitti|title=The Interval Training Workout: Build Muscle and Burn Fat with Anaerobic Exercise|year=2001|publisher=HunterHouse|isbn=0-89793-328-1|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The plateau effect may appear in [[learning]], when students experience a dwindling (less steady) benefit from their learning effort. Studies of elementary school students have found there is a plateau effect in reading level during the upper elementary years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hattie|first=John|title=Visible Learning: A Synthesis of Over 800 Meta-Analyses Relating to Achievement|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-47617-8|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyster, R.: ''Differential effects of prompts and recasts in form-focused instruction.'' In: ''Studies in Second Language Acquisition'' #26 (2004), pp. 399-432.&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is shown in the [[forgetting curve]] developed by [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]], who established the hypothesis of the exponential nature of forgetting. Ebbinghaus hypothesized that the use of the ancient mnemonic device, [[Method of Loci]], and [[spaced repetition]] can help overcome the plateau effect.

The plateau effect is also experienced in [[acclimation]], which is the process that allows organisms to adjust to changes in its environment. In humans, this is seen when the nose becomes acclimated to a certain smell. This immunity is the body's natural defense to distraction from stimulus. This is similar to [[drug tolerance]], when a person's reaction to a specific drug is progressively reduced, requiring an increase in the amount of the drug they receive. Over the counter medications, in particular, have a maximum possible effect, regardless of dose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanson|first=Glen, Peter Venturelli &amp; Annette Fleckenstein|title=Drugs and Society|year=2009|publisher=Jones and Bartlett|isbn=978-0-7637-5642-0|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doweiko|first=Harold E.|title=Concepts of Chemical Dependency|year=2011|publisher=Cengage learning|isbn=0-8400-3390-7|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health and fitness==
In fitness, the Exercise Plateau Effect refers to when a body becomes accustomed to a certain stimulus and thus ceases to respond to it.&lt;ref name=seattle&gt;{{cite web|last=Fontanilla|first=Kamila|title=Overcoming the Exercise Plateau Effect|url=http://sacng.com/ng/blog/?p=783|publisher=Seattle Athletic Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overcoming the plateau usually involves a change in the person's workout, including adding periods of rest, changing volume of exercises, or increasing/decreasing the weight used in strength exercises.&lt;ref name=ms&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawrenson|first=Doug|title=9 Steps to Eliminating a Plateau|url=http://www.muscleandstrength.com/articles/9-steps-to-eliminating-a-plateau.html|publisher=Muscle and Strength}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television ratings==
According to industry consultant Gary Kahan, a television show's ratings plateau after the show reaches a "crescendo" and then slowly decline over time. This view is disputed by mediocre technical directors all over New York City, but supported by the city's top lighting director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Romanowski | first=William | date=2007 | title=Eyes Wide Open: Looking for God in Popular Culture | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q7hzBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA223 |location= |publisher=Brazos Press |page=223 |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paradox of the pesticides==
An example of the plateau effect is found in the [[paradox of the pesticides]]. The paradox states that applying pesticide to a pest may end up increasing the abundance of the pest if the pesticide upsets natural predator–prey dynamics in the ecosystem.

==The "deliberate practice" theory==
In the book ''[[Moonwalking with Einstein]]'' by [[Joshua Foer]], a theory called "deliberate practice" is brought up. The theorist that came up with this theory was [[K. Anders Ericsson]] who said: “Our civilization has always recognized exceptional individuals, whose performance in sports, the arts, and science is vastly superior to that of the rest of the population.” &lt;ref&gt;(Ericsson, The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance)http://projects.ict.usc.edu/itw/gel/EricssonDeliberatePracticePR93.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This quote coincides with the three stages because these would be the main topics or ideas that would come in mind to reach the plateau effect in many of people.  When these conditions are met, practice improves accuracy and speed of performance on cognitive, perceptual, and motor tasks. &lt;ref&gt;(Fitts &amp; Posner; Gibson; Welford, The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance.)http://projects.ict.usc.edu/itw/gel/EricssonDeliberatePracticePR93.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Three stages==
The plateau effect was mentioned in the book ''Moonwalking With Einstein'' by Joshua Foer. The book mentions the three stages that lead up to "The Plateau Effect"; the theory of the threes stages was created by Fitts and Posner. These men base the stages on the theory created by K. Anders Ericsson. The first stage of the plateau effect is the cognitive stage which means “You’re intellectualizing the task and discovering new strategies to accomplish it more proficiently.”&lt;ref name="blog.supplysideliberal.com"&gt;http://blog.supplysideliberal.com/post/51204513930/joshua-foer-on-deliberate-practice&lt;/ref&gt; The second stage is the associative stage which means “You’re concentrating less, making fewer major errors, and generally becoming more efficient.”&lt;ref name="blog.supplysideliberal.com"/&gt; The last and final stage is autonomous stage (aka the plateau effect) which means as “When you figure that you’ve gotten as good as you need to get at the task and you’re basically running on autopilot.”&lt;ref name="blog.supplysideliberal.com"/&gt; Reaching the final stage of the plateau effect starts the mental exercises to keep the mind guessing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4682">'''Policy advocacy''' is defined as active, covert, or inadvertent support of a particular [[policy]] or class of policies.&lt;ref&gt;Lackey (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Whether it is proper for [[scientists]] and other technical experts to act as advocates for their personal policy preferences is contentious.  In the scientific community, much of the controversy around policy advocacy involves precisely defining the proper role of [[science]] and scientists in the political process.&lt;ref&gt;Shannon (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scientists choose to act as policy advocates, while others regard such a dichotomous role as inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Lackey (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Providing technical and scientific information to inform policy deliberations in an objective and relevant way is recognized as a difficult problem in many scientific and technical professions.&lt;ref&gt;Rykiel (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;  The challenge and conflicts have been studied for those working as stock analysts in brokerage firms,&lt;ref&gt;Boni (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; for medical experts testifying in malpractice trials,&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; for funding officers at international development agencies,&lt;ref&gt;Béné (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; and for intelligence analysts within governmental national security agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  The job of providing accurate, relevant, and policy neutral information is especially challenging if highly controversial policy issues (such as [[climate change]]) that have a significant scientific component.&lt;ref&gt;Pielke (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of [[normative science]] by scientists is a common method used to subtly advocate for preferred policy choices.&lt;ref&gt;Scott (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Primary Care Behavioral Health Consultation model (PCBH)''' is a psychological approach to population-based clinical health care that is simultaneously co-located, collaborative, and integrated within the primary care clinic.  The goal of PCBH is to improve and promote overall health within the general population. This approach is important because approximately half of all patients in primary care present with psychiatric comorbidities, and 60% of psychiatric illness is treated in [[primary care]].&lt;ref name="Pirl"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pirl | first1 = W.F. | last2 = Beck | first2 = B.J. | last3 = Safren | first3 = S. A. | last4 = Kim | first4 = H | year = 2001 | title = A descriptive study of psychiatric consultations in a community primary care center | url = | journal = Primary Care Companion Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 3 | issue = 5| pages = 190–194 | doi = 10.4088/PCC.v03n0501 | pmc = 181214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary Care practice has traditionally adopted a generalist approach whereby physicians are trained in the medical model and solutions to problems typically involve medications, procedures, and advice. Appointment times are short, with the goal of seeing a large number of patients in a day. Many patients present with mental health care needs whose symptomology may overlap with medical disorders and which may exacerbate, complicate, or masquerade as physical symptoms. In addition, many medical problems present with associated psychological sequelae (e.g. stress, emotional reactions, dysfunctional lifestyle behaviors), that are amenable to change, through behavioral intervention, that can improve outcomes for these health problems. Over 50% of medical visits to primary care clinics today are related to chronic medical conditions (e.g. chronic pain, diabetes, COPD, hypertension, obesity). As we learn more and more about the contributing factors to the development and maintenance of these medical problems, there is growing evidence that the PCBH model affords us the opportunity for early identification and behavioral/medical intervention that can prevent some acute problems from becoming chronic health care problems. Behavioral Health Consultants (BHCs) work side-by-side with all members of the clinical care team (including primary care providers (PCPs) and nursing staff) to enhance preventive and clinical care for mental health problems that have traditionally been treated solely by physicians. The role of the BHC is to facilitate systemic change within primary care that facilitates a multidisciplinary approach both from a treatment and reimbursement standpoint.  BHCs typically collaborate with physicians to develop treatment plans, monitor patient progress, and flexibly provide care to meet patients’ changing needs&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;Robinson, P.J. and Reiter, J.T. (2007). Behavioral Consultation and Primary Care (pp 1-16). N.Y.: Springer Science + Business Media.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this review the terms Primary Care Behavioral Health Consultation and Behavioral Health Consultation will be used interchangeably.

== Associated Terms ==
Primary Care Psychology: Provision of clinical mental health services through a population-based focus on the common problems confronting a majority of individuals. Such issues treated in primary care may include response to physical illness, stress, affective concerns, substance use and abuse, and developmental and situational issues among others. Primary care psychologists are co-located with primary care providers and usually share the same physical space in practice. [[Primary Care Psychologist|Primary care psychologists]] may retain the traditional session length of specialty care or may adhere to a brief, consultative approach that is solution-focused.&lt;ref name="Garcia"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garcia-Shelton | first1 = P. | year = 2006 | title = Meeting U.S. health care needs: A challenge to psychology | url = | journal = Professional Psychology: Research and Practice | volume = 37 | issue = 6| pages = 676–682 | doi = 10.1037/0735-7028.37.6.676 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary Care Psychologists may often be trained in [[health psychology]] programs, but not exclusively so.

Behavioral Health Consultant: Behavioral Health Consultants and [[Primary care physician|Primary Care Physicians]] collaborate within the same system. The behavioral health provider works as part of the medical team to meet the wide range of needs with which patients present.&lt;ref name="Hunter"&gt;Hunter, C.L., Goodie, J.L., Oordt, M.S., &amp; Dobmeyer A.C., (2009), Integrated behavioral health in primary care: Step-by-step guidance for assessment and intervention. Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Collaborative Care]]: This model uses databases or what are known as registries to track and monitor patients with certain conditions. Typical examples in primary care include diabetes and depression. Often the person managing the registry is a nurse or mental health professional who performs follow-up phone calls and assists the primary care team in following evidence-based protocols. There is often also a consulting psychiatrist who oversees the provision of care in primary care.&lt;ref name="Hunkeler"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hunkeler | first1 = E. | last2 = Katon | first2 = W. | last3 = Tang | first3 = L. | last4 = Williams | first4 = J. | last5 = Kroenke | first5 = K. | last6 = Lin | first6 = E. | last7 = Harpole | first7 = L.| year = 2006 | title = Long term outcomes from the IMPACT randomised trial for depressed elderly patients in primary care | url = | journal = BMJ | volume = 332 | issue = 7536| pages = 259–63 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.38683.710255.BE | pmid=16428253 | pmc=1360390|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
Primary care has often been termed the "De Facto" mental health system in the United States.&lt;ref name="Cummings"&gt;Cummings, N.A., O’Donohue, W., Hays, S.C., &amp; Follette, V. (2001). Integrated behavioral healthcare: Positioning mental health practice with medical/surgical practice. San Diego: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Research shows that approximately half of all mental health care services are provided solely by primary care providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Narrow | first1 = W. | last2 = Reiger | first2 = D. | last3 = Rae | first3 = D. | last4 = Manderscheid | first4 = R. | last5 = Locke | first5 = B. | year = 1993 | title = Use of services by persons with mental and addictive disorders: Findings from the Institute of Mental Health Epidemiologic Catchment Area Program | url = | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 50 | issue = 2| pages = 95–107 | doi = 10.1001/archpsyc.1993.01820140017002 | pmid = 8381266 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, primary care practitioners prescribe about 70% of all [[psychotropic medications]] and 80% of [[antidepressants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beardsley | first1 = R. | last2 = Gardocki | first2 = G. | last3 = Larson | first3 = D. | last4 = Hidaldo | first4 = J. | year = 1988 | title = Prescribing of psychotropic medication by primary care physicians and psychiatrists | url = | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 45 | issue = 12| pages = 1117–1119 | doi = 10.1001/archpsyc.1988.01800360065009 | pmid = 2904248 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, while it seems there are various "specialty" mental health clinics and psychiatrists alike, the primary care environment continues to lend itself to an array of psychiatric issues. One reason is that physical health problems can contribute to psychological dysfunction and vice versa.  Examples of the frequent comorbity between medical and psychological problems include: chronic pain can cause depression; panic symptoms can lead to complaints of heart palpitations; and stress can contribute to irritable bowl syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;O’Donohue, W.T., Cummings, N.A., Cucciare, M.A., Runyan, C.N., &amp; Cummings, J.L. (2006). Integrated behavioral health care: A guide to effective intervention. Amherst, NY: Humanities Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  While these mind-body relationships may seem obvious, often the presenting problem is far less clear, with the physical health problem being masked by psychosocial concerns.  In fact, of the 10 most common complaints in primary care, less than 16% had a diagnosable physical etiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kroenke | first1 = K. | last2 = Mangelsdorff | first2 = A. | year = 1989 | title = Common symptoms in ambulatory care: Incidence, evaluation, therapy, and outcome | url = | journal = American Journal of Medicine | volume = 86 | issue = 3| pages = 262–266 | doi = 10.1016/0002-9343(89)90293-3 | pmid = 2919607 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychosocial impact on primary care is tremendous (approximately 70% of all visits); however, it is curious that few mental health providers have traditionally placed themselves where the demand for their services is arguably the greatest. 
 
Despite the availability of outpatient mental health resources, research indicates that patients are still driven to the primary care setting. In fact, studies show that as little as 10% of patients actually follow through when being referred by a physician to receive outpatient mental health treatment.&lt;ref name="Slay"&gt;Slay, J.D., &amp; McCleod, C. (1997) Evolving an integration model: The Healthcare Partners experience.  In N.A. Cummings, J.L. Cummings, and J. Johnson (Eds.) Behavioral health in primary care: A guide for clinical integration (pp 121-144).  New York: International Universities Press.&lt;/ref&gt;   Many experts believe this low completion rate is tied to the stigma that often surrounds mental health care, causing patients to deny or refuse to seek help for psychiatric needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mak | first1 = W.W.S. | last2 = Poon | first2 = C.Y.M. | last3 = Pun | first3 = L.Y.K. | last4 = Cheung | first4 = S.F. | year = 2007 | title = Meta-analysis of stigma and mental health | url = | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 65 | issue = 2| pages = 245–261 | doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.03.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a general rule, patients who do choose to address their mental health concerns express a preference for services in primary care likely due to its familiarity and less stigmatizing environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lang | first1 = A.J. | year = 2005 | title = Mental health treatment preferences of primary care patients | url = | journal = Journal of Behavioral Medicine | volume = 28 | issue = 6| pages = 581–586 | doi = 10.1007/s10865-005-9019-2 | pmid = 16228695 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, as many medical providers will admit, their training has left them ill-prepared to appropriately treat the psychiatric sequalae that presents in their clinic.  The PCBH model has sought to address this dilemma by providing access to mental health services on site to more effectively target the biological, psychological, and social aspects of patient care.  Resulting from close collaboration between physicians and mental health providers, the patients’ needs are more adequately met by care that is more comprehensive and collaborative between physicians and mental health providers.  Furthermore, the patients are more likely to follow through with primary care services, with referral rates around 80-90%.&lt;ref name="Slay"/&gt;

==The Behavioral Health Consultant Model==
Behavioral Health Consultants are culturally competent generalists who provide treatment for a wide variety of mental health, psychosocial, motivational, and medical concerns, including management of anxiety, depression, substance abuse, smoking cessation, sleep hygiene, and diabetes among others.  BHCs also provide support and management for patients with severe and persistent mental illness and tend to be familiar with psychopharmacological interventions.&lt;ref name="Hunter"/&gt; Paralleling general medicine, patients who require more extensive mental health treatment are typically referred to specialty care. BHC appointments are typically 15–30 minutes long with the goal of utilizing brief interventions to reduce functional impairment for the population as a whole.  BHCs tend to provide focused feedback to PCPs with succinct, action oriented recommendations to help effectively manage patients’ needs.  BHC interventions tend to be more cost effective&lt;ref name="James"&gt;James, L.C. (2009)  What administrators should know about the primary care setting. In L.C. James &amp; W.T. O’Donohue (Eds.). The primary care toolkit (pp 13-19).  N.Y.: Springer Science + Business Media&lt;/ref&gt; and offer increased access to care, with improved patient and provider satisfaction.

===Evidence Base For The BHC Model===
A comparison of an enhanced-referral system to a BHC model found that more than 80% of medical providers rated communication between themselves and the BHC as occurring "frequently," relative to less than 50% in an enhanced-referral model of care. Providers strongly preferred an integrated care model to the enhanced-referral model.&lt;ref name="Gallo"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gallo | first1 = J.J. | last2 = Zubritsky | first2 = C. | last3 = Maxwell | first3 = J. | last4 = Nazar | first4 = M. | last5 = Bogner | first5 = H.R. | last6 = Quijano | first6 = L.M | year = 2004 | title = Primary care clinicians evaluate integrated and referral models of behavioral health care for older adults: Results from a multisite effectiveness trial (PRISM-E) | url = | journal = Annals of Family Medicine | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 305–309 | display-authors = 6 | doi = 10.1370/afm.116 | pmid = 15335128 | last7 = Syropoulos | first7 = HJ | last8 = Cheal | first8 = KL | last9 = Chen | first9 = H | pmc = 1466686 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another single-site study at an urban community health center found that embedding BHCs resulted in reduced referrals to specialty mental health (8% of depressed patients were referred) along with improved adherence to evidence-based guidelines for the care of depression and reduced prescriptions for antidepressants.&lt;ref name="Serrano"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Serrano | first1 = N | last2 = Monden | first2 = K. | year = 2011 | title = The effect of behavioral health consultation on the care of depression by primary care clinicians | url = | journal = Wisconsin Medical Journal | volume = 110 | issue = 3| pages = 113–118 | pmid = 21748995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, a recent literature review revealed that improved outcomes in mental health care were associated with several fundamental characteristics, including collaboration and co-location with PCP and mental health providers, as well as systematic follow-up, medication compliance, patient psycho-education, and patient input into treatment modality.&lt;ref name="Craven"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Craven |first1=MA|last2= Bland |first2=R |title=Better practices in collaborative mental health care: an analysis of the evidence base |journal=Can J Psychiatry |volume=51 |issue=6 Suppl 1 |pages=7S–72S |date=May 2006 |pmid=16786824 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general the number of empirical investigations that have examined the clinical impact and cost-offset of the BHC model is still limited, although a growing body of evidence supports the utility of other integrated behavior health programs (with varying degrees of integration) in academic settings, Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, and community health care settings.

====Depression Care====
Specifically targeting depression, Schulberg, Raue, &amp; Rollman (2002)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schulberg | first1 = H. C. | last2 = Raue | first2 = P. J. | last3 = Rollman | first3 = B. L. | year = 2002 | title = The effectiveness of psychotherapy in treating depressive disorders in primary care practice: clinical and cost perspectives | url = | journal = General Hospital Psychiatry | volume = 24 | issue = 4| pages = 203–212 | doi = 10.1016/S0163-8343(02)00175-5 | pmid = 12100831 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reviewed 12 randomized controlled trials (RCT's) that examined evidence-based treatments for major depression (interpersonal psychotherapy &amp; cognitive-behavior therapy) and problem-solving therapy, compared to usual care by PCP's (i.e. antidepressant medication, drug placebo, or unspecified control). The authors concluded that evidence-based psychotherapies adapted for the primary care setting are comparable to pharmacotherapy alone and superior to PCP's usual care. The use of brief evidence-based psychotherapies, such as those reviewed by Schulberg et al., 2002, are fundamental within the PCBH model.  The PCBH model emphasizes a problem-focused and functional-contextual approach to assessment and treatment of behavioral health and mental disorders.&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt; Wolf and Hopko's (2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wolf | first1 = N. J. | last2 = Hopko | first2 = D. R. | year = 2008 | title = Psychosocial and pharmacological interventions for depressed adults in primary care: a critical review | url = | journal = Clinical Psychology Review | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 131–161 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2007.04.004 | pmid = 17555857 }}&lt;/ref&gt; recent review of treatments for depression in primary care concluded that adaptations of CBT for depression in primary care are "probably efficacious."  Research also shows that providing basic training in CBT to PCPs is not enough to produce robust clinical outcomes (King et al., 2002);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Michael King | first1 = O. D. F. T. A. H. D.

With respect to the impact of behavioral health consultation on pharmacological treatment of major and minor depression, compared to usual care Katon et al. (1995)&lt;ref name="Katon1995"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Katon | first1 = W. | last2 = Korff | first2 = Von | last3 = Lin | first3 = E. | last4 = Walker | first4 = E. | last5 = Simon | first5 = G.

====Anxiety Care====
Although less empirical attention has been directed toward improving treatment of anxiety disorders in primary care, Stanley et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stanley | first1 = M. | last2 = Beck | first2 = J. | last3 = Novy | first3 = D. | year = 2003| title = (2003).

====Health Behavior Change====
In regard to other health behaviors, strict utilization of the BHC model has shown significant improvements in sleep difficulties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goodie | first1 = J.

L., Johnson, D. J., Cole, B. F., Hanscom, B., et al. (2006). A controlled trial of methods for managing pain with or without co-occurring psychological problems. Annals of Family Medicine, 3, 1–13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whitlock et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whitlock | first1 = E. P. | last2 = Orleans | first2 = C.

However, they also suggested that within a population-based model of care modest changes in behavioral health "translate to significant effects."

====Alternative Models Of Care====
Traditional Outpatient Psychotherapy: Commonly called "Specialty" care, traditional outpatient psychotherapy usually involves treatment of mental health concerns in an outpatient clinic or another setting independent of medical care.  Sessions are usually 50 minutes in length and the duration of treatment may vary from weeks to years depending on the mental health concern. Typically, little contact occurs between therapists and patients’ physicians or psychiatrists, and coordination of care may be difficult, time consuming, and expensive. The payment and access systems for specialty mental health are also usually distinct from and more cumbersome than that for primary care treatment.

Co-located Care Model: Behavioral health providers and PCPs practice within the same office or building but maintain separate care delivery systems, including records and treatment plans. However, behavioral health providers and PCPs may consult one another for enhanced treatment outcomes.&lt;ref name="Hunter"/&gt;

==Policy==
Funding has been a barrier to the implementation of the Primary Care Behavioral Health Consultant model.  The cost of treatment and lack of affordable health care has been a barrier for many people with mental illness to receive treatment.  In the private sector insurance market mental health treatment is often segregated from other medical care, isolated in separate systems of care and payment.  Typically this makes it more difficult for patients to access services readily, if at all.  For uninsured patients the United States federal government can provide (depending on eligibility criteria) Medicaid which provides insurance coverage for a large number of individuals with severe and persistent mental illness.  The federal government provides money to each state to fund Medicaid programs and provides general mandates on how the money must be spent.  Because the federal government has special relationships with [[Veteran's Administration]] hospitals and clinics and [[Federally Qualified Health Center|federally qualified health centers]] and because [[Bureau of Primary Health Care|several federal agencies]] have identified integrated care as key targets for improved primary care, the PCBH model has been able to take root in these systems whereas only a few PCBH programs exist in private insurance environments. One major barrier in some states (states can set some of their own rules with regard to Medicaid) is the prohibition of same-day billing.  This makes it impossible for a PCBH program since the fundamental concept behind PCBH is the provision of services (medical and mental health visit) on the same day.  Typically eligible professionals for Medicaid reimbursement in federally qualified health centers include psychiatrists, psychologists and licensed clinical social workers.  Access to care and payment tends to be less restrictive with Medicare, another federal program for persons without private insurance.

The other major issue impacting the development of the PCBH model is the dearth of well-trained mental health workers. At present professional training programs with an emphasis in primary care are limited in number which has led to the growth of internships of varying kinds to train students and retrain professionals (see training programs below).

===PCBH and Health Disparities In The United States===
As the population of the United States becomes more diverse, the approach to population-based care must also adjust accordingly.  Projections published by the U.S. Census Bureau estimate that by the year 2042 White, non-Hispanic people will no longer be the majority of the population in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

(2011, March).  Overview of Race and Hispanic Origin: 2010 [Census brief]. Retrieved from:  https://www.census.gov/ prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-02.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The changing population of the United States is generating a need to incorporate cultural competence into the way primary care services are delivered. These changes in the population are concurrent with increasing evidence of disparities in the quality of care that is provided to historically underserved populations within the United States.  Underserved populations have low levels of access and utilization based on economic, cultural, and systemic barriers to care.

Behavioral Health providers in Primary Care settings have an opportunity to directly impact health care disparities by designing "…strategies to enhance cooperative or healthy behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haley | first1 = W.E. | last2 = McDaniel | first2 = S.H. | last3 = Bray | first3 = J.H. | last4 = Frank | first4 = R.G. | last5 = Heldring | first5 = M. | last6 = Johnson | first6 = S.B. | last7 = Lu | first7 = E.G. | year = 1998 | title = Psychological practice in primary care settings: Practical tips for clinicians | url = | journal = Professional Psychology: Research and Practice | volume = 29 | issue = 3| pages = 237–244 | display-authors = 7 | doi = 10.1037/0735-7028.29.3.237 | last8 = Reed | first8 = Geoffrey M. | last9 = Wiggins | first9 = Jack G. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  "The premise is that mismatches in models (i.e., expectations about illness and health interactions) between the patient and the health provider may render medical care ‘psychologically’ inaccessible to ethnic minorities, resulting in poorer health outcomes for these populations (possibly via noncompliance)."&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, T., &amp; Swartzman, L. (2001), Cross-cultural differences in illness models and expectations for the health care provider-client/patient interaction. In S. Kazarian and D. Evans (Eds.), Cultural health psychology, (pp. 45-61). San Diego, CA: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Strategies that help bridge mismatches improve treatment outcomes and make care more accessible for underserved populations.

By establishing a role in primary care, the front-line of health-care delivery, Behavioral Health providers gain direct access to patients and providers.  Healthy People 2010, published in 2007, recommended "that early intervention efforts to protect and promote mental health, including screening and the promotion of mental health awareness, become an essential component of primary care visits and school health assessments.".&lt;ref&gt;Wright, D., (2007). Progress Review: Mental Health and Mental Disorders.

(2004). Primary care, psychology, and primary care psychology. In Haas, L.J. (Ed.), Handbook of Primary Care Psychology, (pp. 5-19). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of the difference in how patients, particularly those from underserved groups, may express their distress and respond to the stigma of mental illness providing Behavioral Health services through primary care will likely make services more psychologically and physically accessible.

Providing culturally-competent, population based care can difficult to conceptualize, particularly in the context of the fast-paced environment of primary care.  Hunter ''et al.'' propose "a patient-centered, culturally competent approach for effective communication and care…that includes the Explanatory model of health and illness, Social and environmental factors affecting adherence, Fears and concerns about medication and side effects, Treatment understanding model of culturally competent practice".&lt;ref name="Hunter"/&gt;  By adopting this kind of approach, Behavioral Health providers can help primary care providers meet the medical, psychological, and cultural needs of the patient.

==History==
In the early 1960s, Kaiser Permanente, an early Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), uncovered that 60% of physician visits were either individuals who were somatizing stress or whose physical condition was exacerbated by emotional factors.&lt;ref name="Cummings"/&gt; These findings prompted Kaiser to explore various strategies to better manage psychosocial complaints, with ultimate goal of cost reduction.  Psychotherapy, which was offered as a prepaid benefit, was studied as a method to reduce primary care visits while also more properly (and less expensively) addressing the problem at hand. Studies revealed that by participating in brief psychotherapy, medical utilization reduced by 65%.&lt;ref name="Cummings"/&gt;  The initiatives at Kaiser Permanent set in motion a large body of research on medical cost-offset, a term for the reduction in medical costs that occurs as a result of a patient receiving appropriately designed behavior health services in lieu of more expensive medical services.  The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) funded several replications examining medical cost offset in the years to follow, with reductions of cost around 30 to 65%.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, K.R., &amp; Vischi, T.R. (1980). The Bethesda Consensus Conference on Medical Offset. Alcohol, drug abuse, and mental health administration report. Rockville, MD: Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration.&lt;/ref&gt;   One important trend that emerged in this literature was the greater the collaboration between primary care, the better the cost offset.  Likewise, the more "traditional" the behavioral interventions, the less the medical cost offset.
 
In 1981, The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) sponsored the Hawaii Medicaid Project, a seven-year prospective study examining the impact of a new, collaborative behavioral health system among 36,000 Medicaid beneficiaries and 91,000 federal employees in Honolulu. This landmark trial compared the medical cost-offset among patients who received brief and targeted interventions, those who received a 52-session annual psychotherapy benefit, and those who received no treatment. The results showed that the brief, targeted interventions reduced saved $350 per patient per year while psychotherapy actually increased costs by $750 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pallack | first1 = M.S. | last2 = Cummings | first2 = N.A. | last3 = Dorken | first3 = H. | last4 = Henke | first4 = C.J. | year = 1994 | title = Medical costs, Medicaid, and managed mental health treatment: The Hawaii study | url = | journal = Managed Care Quarterly | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 64–70 |pmid=10134004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hawaii Medicaid Project became the prototype for cost offset research and spawned future projects among managed care organizations, with goal of reducing costs.  In 1987, Humana followed suit by studying brief behavioral intervention among Medicare recipients in Florida, with the intention of reducing medical utilization among recent widows and widowers.  Known as the Bereavement Program, Humana learned after 2 years $1400 could be saved per patient via brief group intervention for bereavement.&lt;ref&gt;Cummings, N.A. (1997). Approaches in prevention in the behavioral health of older adults. In P. Hartman-Stein (Eds.) Innovative behavioral healthcare for older adults: A guide-for changing times (pp. 1-23). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, other HMOs and regional group practices began to integrate behavioral health services into primary care, including Kaiser Permanente, Healthcare partners, Group Health Cooperative of the Puget Sound,  Kaiser Group Health of Minnesota, and Duke University Medical Center.&lt;ref name="Cummings"/&gt;

In the years to follow, behavioral health integration started to gain support from a federal level, as VA systems began to conduct research around the impact of primary care psychologists, beginning with the Healthcare Network of Upstate New York (VISN2).  In the last decade, additional VA systems have followed suit with primary care behavioral health programs of their own to meet the increasing mental health demands of soldiers returning from war.  More recently, federal support has begun to take hold by increasing funding for integrated behavioral health services for various federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) in the United States. Primary care behavioral health was seen as a solution in FQHCs to address the mental health needs of the Medicaid and uninsured populations, with the goal of better treatment and reduced overall costs.

The '''Railway Technical Centre''' (RTC) in London Road, [[Derby]], England, was built by the [[British Railways Board]] in the early 1960s to be its technical headquarters. [[British Rail]] was able to announce that "The Railway Technical Centre at Derby is the largest railway research complex in the world."

The RTC centralised most of the technical services provided by the regional Chief Mechanical &amp; Electrical Engineers (CM&amp;EE) to form the Department of Mechanical &amp; Electrical Engineering (DM&amp;EE). In addition, it housed the newly formed [[British Rail Research Division]] which reported directly to the Board. The latter is well known for its work on the experimental [[Advanced Passenger Train]] (APT-E). At that early stage this was a concept vehicle, and in time the DM&amp;EE applied the new knowledge to existing practice in the design of the [[InterCity 125|High Speed Train]] (HST), the later prototype APT-P and other high-speed vehicles.

==History==
===Opening===
The Research Division was the first to move into the purpose-built accommodation on London Road. This was formed initially with personnel from other departments around the country, including the Electrical Research Division from [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]], the Mechanical Engineers Research Section,  the Civil Engineering Research Unit (Track Lab), and the Chemical Research Unit, while the Scientific Services Division occupied the former [[LMS Scientific Research Laboratory]] building across the road known as Hartley House. The embryo RTC site (mainly Kelvin House and the Research Test Hall) was officially opened by the [[Duke of Edinburgh]] in May 1964.&lt;ref&gt;"British Railways Research Department Expanded" ''[[Railway Gazette International|Railway Gazette]]'' 5 June 1964 page 425&lt;/ref&gt; Later additional buildings were added: Trent House and Derwent House, the Advanced Projects lab, then Stephenson House, Lathkill House and finally Brunel House. 

===Department of Mechanical &amp; Electrical Engineering===
In addition to the research employees, the RTC became the headquarters of the DM&amp;EE. This brought together engineers from the regional departments, together with its Drawing Offices, the Testing &amp; Performance Section and the Engineering Development Unit workshop (EDU) from [[Darlington]], the Workshops Division (which later became [[British Rail Engineering Limited]]) and it was also home to the Board's Central Purchasing Department. Strange to relate but the layout of equipment within the new workshop was as near as possible the same as the original. Following this came the Plastics Development Unit from [[Eastleigh]], which, among other innovations, was responsible for the design of the High Speed Train's streamlined cabs as well as the prototype [[British Rail Mark 3|Mark 3]] coach doors.

===Test tracks===
When research and testing required stretches of real railway line, the Research Division used the [[Old Dalby Test Track]], and at [[Mickleover]] in Derby and The High Marnham Test Track, the former LD&amp;ECR from Shirebrook to Tuxford where one of Network Rail's RIDC is located.

== RTC today ==
At [[Privatisation of British Rail|privatisation]], most of the facilities were taken over by commercial railway engineering companies, and it was marketed as the "rtc Business Park" renting space to a range of small consultancy firms. 

===Research===
The only facility which is still used for railway research is the moving-model aerodynamic test facility. 

===Repairs===
The former RTC site is also used by [[LORAM Maintenance of Way, Inc.#United Kingdom|LORAM]] to carry out repairs and maintenance on railway vehicles. It was also used by Rampart Carriage &amp; Wagon Services (RC&amp;WS) which went into liquidation in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/notice/L-60495-1816069 |title=Rampart Carriage &amp; Wagon Services Ltd |publisher=Thegazette.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storage===
A large part of the site is used as storage and an operating base by LORAM and [[Network Rail]], whose rolling stock on site forms part of Network Rail testing trains. Usual traction on these trains is either [[Colas Rail]] [[British Rail Class 37|class 37s]] or [[British Rail class 67|class 67s]]. The [[New Measurement Train]] and LORAM C21 Grinding/Rail Profile Trains are also maintained at this facility.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saybolt universal viscosity is specified by the [[ASTM]]{{nbsp}}D2161. Both tests are considered obsolete to other measures of kinematic viscosity, but their results are quoted widely in technical literature.

In both tests, the time taken for 60{{nbsp}}ml of the liquid, held at a specific temperature, to flow through a calibrated tube, is measured, using a Saybolt viscometer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spectro-oils.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Viscosity-conversion-tables.pdf Viscosity By Different Instruments] Retrieved 2015-11-27&lt;/ref&gt; The Saybolt universal viscosity test occurs at {{convert|100|F|C|abbr=on}}, or more recently, {{convert|40|C|F|abbr=on}}. The Saybolt FUROL viscosity test occurs at {{convert|120|F|C|abbr=on}}, or more recently, {{convert|50|C|F|abbr=on}}, and uses a larger calibrated tube. This provides for the testing of more viscous fluids, with the result being approximately {{frac|1|10}} of the universal viscosity.

The test results are specified in seconds (s), more often than not referencing the test: Saybolt universal seconds (SUS); seconds, Saybolt universal (SSU); seconds, Saybolt universal viscosity (SSUV); and Saybolt FUROL seconds (SFS); seconds, Saybolt FUROL (SSF). The precise temperature at which the test is performed is often specified as well.

'''Skills Development Scotland''' (SDS) is the national skills agency of Scotland. It is an [[executive non-departmental public body]] of the [[Scottish Government]].

==History==
Created on 1 April 2008, SDS is a merger of former organisations and services which delivered skills related services across Scotland.

The former organisations or services that now make up SDS are:

*  Careers Scotland
*  Elements of [[Scottish Enterprise]]'s skills function
*  Elements of [[Highlands &amp; Islands Enterprise]]'s skills function
*  Scottish University for Industry (learndirect Scotland, learndirect Scotland for business, ILA Scotland and [[#The Big Plus|The Big Plus]])
*  Training for Work
*  Skillseekers
*  Modern Apprenticeships

In 2010, the agency found itself facing funding cuts of more than £20{{nbsp}}million and needing to find 125 voluntary redundancies, one tenth of its workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-12016425 |title=Redundancies at Skills Development Scotland |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=17 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Skills Development Scotland has a presence in most major towns across Scotland.

==The Big Plus==
The Big Plus is an awareness raising campaign in [[Scotland]] targeting adults who might be unable to achieve their aspirations due to a lack of literacy and/or numeracy skills. Formerly part of the Scottish University for Industry, it is now part of Skills Development Scotland.

Adults who respond to the media promotion are put in touch with a local learning provider where they are invited to participate in a program of personal, dedicated learning activities at a local centre. The program aims to help participants reach a level of skills that will enable them to actively engage, with confidence, in personal, family, community and work life. Learning programs are provided by Scottish [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local authorities]] and are free to resident applicants.

'''Southern Nazarene University''' ('''SNU''') is a Christian [[liberal arts college]] located in [[Bethany, Oklahoma]], United States.

==History==
[[File:Centennial Plaza, Southern Nazarene University (2007).jpg|thumb|left|Centennial Plaza]]

The history of the institution is one of various mergers and, therefore, one of differing institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.premierstudios.com/nazarene/docs/Why%20These%20Schools%20%20Historical%20Perspectives%20on%20Nazarene%20Higher%20Education.pdf "Why These Schools? Historical Perspectives on Nazarene Higher Education," by Stan Ingersol] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624230418/http://media.premierstudios.com/nazarene/docs/Why%20These%20Schools%20%20Historical%20Perspectives%20on%20Nazarene%20Higher%20Education.pdf |date=June 24, 2008 }}. Ingersol treats each of these institutions separately in his historical overview of the Nazarene schools.&lt;/ref&gt; While SNU claims its founding date as 1899, that founding date refers to an institution that merged with what is now SNU: [[Texas Holiness University]]. As an Oklahoman institution, SNU dates back to 1906, with the founding of the Beulah Heights Academy and Bible School.

The roots of the original Southern Nazarene University are primarily in an orphanage of downtown [[Oklahoma City]], founded by Miss Mattie Mallory. Mallory used her [[inheritance]] to buy property north of the city, which she named Beulah Heights, and relocated the orphanage there. Then, in 1906, the Beulah Heights Academy and Bible School opened. In 1909, the school was renamed Oklahoma Holiness College&lt;ref name="hunt"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Raser|first1 = Harold E.|author2 = Thomas C. Hunt, James C.

Cameron| title = Eastern Nazarene College—The First Fifty Years, 1900-1950| publisher = Nazarene Publishing House| year = 1968| location = Kansas City| page = 131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Peniel College]] merged with Oklahoma Nazarene College in 1920, the name changed to Bethany-Peniel College.&lt;ref name="change"/&gt; Peniel was the first of four fellow Nazarene institutions that would be absorbed by the Oklahoma school. The second institution was [[Central Nazarene College]], another Nazarene school in [[Texas]], in 1929. Two years later, [[Arkansas Holiness College]] was absorbed by Bethany-Peniel. The last merger was [[Bresee Theological College]], in 1940. As historian [[Timothy L. Smith]] wrote, "It eventually outdistanced and absorbed the schools at Hutchinson, Kansas, Peniel and Hamlin, Texas, Vilonia, Arkansas, and Des Arc, Missouri. Bethany became the Nazarene center for the whole [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Timothy L. Smith]], ''Called Unto Holiness'', pp. 226–227. found in [http://media.premierstudios.com/nazarene/docs/Why%20These%20Schools%20%20Historical%20Perspectives%20on%20Nazarene%20Higher%20Education.pdf "Why These Schools?

In 1955, the name changed again from Bethany-Peniel College to Bethany Nazarene College (BNC) to avoid confusion with the term "[[penal system|penal]]" or "[[penal colony]]",&lt;ref name="snu"/&gt; and again in 1986, from Bethany Nazarene College to Southern Nazarene University (SNU).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncahlc.org/index.php?option=com_directory&amp;Itemid=192&amp;Action=ShowBasic&amp;instid=1615 HLC of NAC: SNU profile]. Changed after the re-arrangement of educational regions in the late 1960s, but reflects neither locale nor regional affiliation. [[Trevecca]] is the Nazarene college for the traditional American "South" and, by [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'s definition, SNU is located in the "West".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
The main campus is located in [[Bethany, Oklahoma]]. Since 1990, SNU has also maintained a presence in [[Tulsa]], providing adult and professional programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Omer | last = Gillham | title = Southern Nazarene expands Tulsa site | date = March 13, 2001 | url = http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=13&amp;articleid=010312_Ne_a10south&amp;archive=yes | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120303131516/http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=13&amp;articleid=010312_Ne_a10south&amp;archive=yes | dead-url = yes | archive-date = March 3, 2012 | work = [[Tulsa World]] | accessdate = September 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Robert | last = Evatt | title = School means business: Regal Plaza expects boost from SNU | date = September 1, 2010 | url = http://www.tulsaworld.com/business/article.aspx?subjectid=46&amp;articleid=20100901_32_E1_CUTLIN381749 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20121005103359/http://www.tulsaworld.com/business/article.aspx?subjectid=46&amp;articleid=20100901_32_E1_CUTLIN381749 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = October 5, 2012 | work = [[Tulsa World]] | accessdate = September 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SNU provides students [[undergraduate]] degree options in several different fields of interest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110720044457/https://my.snu.edu/catalog/catalog.asp?ContentCode=135-109&amp;CatalogYear=2008 2008 SNU Traditional Undergraduate Catalog]&lt;/ref&gt; It also offers three [[graduate student|graduate]] degrees&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110720045626/https://my.snu.edu/catalog/catalog.asp?ContentCode=102-308&amp;CatalogYear=2009 2009 SNU Graduate Catalog]&lt;/ref&gt; and seven professional programs for adults.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110720045651/https://my.snu.edu/catalog/catalog.asp?ContentCode=9-143&amp;CatalogYear=2009 2009 SNU Adult Studies Catalog]&lt;/ref&gt; Southern Nazarene is an [[open admissions]] college,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.jsp?collegeId=79&amp;profileId=1|title=Southern Nazarene University - SNU - The College Board|work=collegeboard.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that all who apply with a high school diploma are accepted without regard to course grades or standardized test scores; the 2007 acceptance rate for students who applied to the college was 47 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Southern Nazarene University| work = Guide to Best Colleges| publisher = U.S. News and World Report

===AAUP censure list===
In 2005, the [[American Association of University Professors]] took SNU off its censure list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/pubsres/academe/2005/JA/AW/AnMeet.htm ''Academe'' Online. July-August 2005.

Discrepancies in the reasons for their termination led the AAUP to investigate: the initial reason given was that of financial difficulty on the part of the institution, due to a decline in student retention and the resulting drop in enrollment, while the reason given later was one of unspecified performance deficiencies in the terminated faculty members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaup.org/NR/rdonlyres/78150091-FFC0-4DB4-B43E-FAC9A9ECF5E6/0/SNazarene.pdf AAUP Report on Southern Nazarene University]&lt;/ref&gt; SNU eventually offered some of the terminated faculty members monetary compensation but remained on the list for 18 years, until its administration had drafted [[academic tenure]] procedures that met AAUP standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/comm/rep/A/2004-05Comm-A-rept.htm AAUP Committee A Report 2004-2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817050518/http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/comm/rep/A/2004-05Comm-A-rept.htm |date=August 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graduation reports===
A report released in April 2008 found that, of the U.S. institutions surveyed based on data provided under the 1990 Student Right-to-Know Act, SNU had the 17th-largest gap between the average [[graduation]] rate for [[White people|white students]] and the average graduation rate for [[Black people|black students]]. White students had an average graduation rate of 50 percent, 7 points below the national average for all students, while black students at SNU were found to have an average graduation rate of 14 percent, 35 points below their white peers. 11 percent of the student population at SNU is black.&lt;ref name="gap"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/04/21/gradrates|title=News Archive|work=insidehighered.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a separate report issued in 2009 by the [[American Enterprise Institute]], SNU was found to have the 8th-highest graduation rate among noncompetitive institutions in the U.S., with an average graduation rate of 54 percent. Noncompetitive institutions were defined in the report as institutions that "require only evidence of graduation from an accredited high school" for admission.&lt;ref name="top"&gt;[http://www.insidehighered.com/content/download/304231/4001878/version/1/file/FINAL+FULL+REPORT.pdf InsideHigherEd.com: "Diplomas and Dropouts, Which Colleges Actually Graduate Their Students and Which Don’t"; American Enterprise Institute; June 2009; Frederick M.

==Student life==
There were 2,090 students at SNU in 2007, 1,656 of whom were undergraduates.&lt;ref name="nces"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/globallocator/|title=Search for Schools, Colleges, and Libraries|publisher=U.S. Department of Education National Center for Education Statistics|accessdate=April 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; SNU provides on-campus apartments and various dormitories. All students under the age of 22 must live on-campus, although exceptions are made for local students living with families. The housing options include Bracken Hall and Chapman Apartments for upperclassmen,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snu.edu/housing-faqs SNU: Housing Changes 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408120500/http://www.snu.edu/housing-faqs |date=April 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Oklahoma! 2006 019.jpg|thumb|right|Oklahoma! in 2006]]
As at most [[Christian]] colleges, there is an emphasis on spiritual development at SNU. The Office of Spiritual Development is presided over by a Vice President (VP) of Spiritual Development and [[Chapel]] services take place each Tuesday and Thursday in Herrick Auditorium. Students are required to go to 27 of 30 chapels offered. There are also alternative chapel credit opportunities available to students: missions trips, community service projects, and regular church attendance. Chapel speakers and musical groups are arranged by the VP of Spiritual Development. The Office of Spiritual Development work with the SGA Campus Ministries leaders to provide special class chapels and spiritual life retreats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snu.edu/chapel|title=Chapel @ SNU|work=Southern Nazarene University, Bethany &amp; Tulsa, Oklahoma - Character - Culture - Christ}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Herrick Auditorium, Southern Nazarene University (interior).jpg|thumb|right|Inside Herrick Auditorium]]
The Student Government Association (SGA) coordinates events and services for students. The SGA is broken up into four councils executives: Campus Ministries, Athletic Relations, Publicity, and Social Life, as well as the Office Administrator and Student Body President, along with the editors for the two SNU publications the campus newspaper, ''The Echo'', formerly ''The Reveille Echo'', and the campus [[yearbook]], ''The Arrow''. Each SGA "exec", save the Office Administrator and the Student Body President, preside over sub-councils and have a representative on the class level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snusga.com|title=SNU sga|work=SNU sga}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SGA councils are responsible for hosting school activities, including the SNL (Southern Nazarene Live) talent contest, T.W.I.R.P., Heart-Pal Banquet, Junior-Senior Banquet, class chapels, and class parties.

===Motto===
The motto of SNU is "Character, Culture, Christ".  This was first used in 1931 in a student publication called ''The Reflector.''  In 1948, under the presidency of Roy H. Cantrell the motto was officially revised and adopted by the staff.  This change is detailed in this excerpt from Dr. Cantrell's thesis ''The History of Bethany Nazarene College'' : "Character...Culture...Christ. These three words have ever been basic in the program and in the administration of Bethany-Peniel College. The noble founders of this college and their successors have consistently maintained that sound moral CHARACTER is the most insistent need in the world of men, that true CULTURE makes such moral character attractive and effective, and that the transforming power of CHRIST and the refining operation of the Spirit are indispensable in the building of the truest manhood and womanhood. This standard has ever required that the students in this college be provided with the best in educational procedure and the finest in spiritual atmosphere."

===Alma Mater===
The lyrics for SNU's current Alma Mater were written by a committee in 1940.  This committee was composed of Alice Crill, Hoyle Thomas, Marjorie Crooks, Kyle Crist, Dave McKibbon, and Madge Posey. The lyrics were revised by J. Michael Crabtree, Class of 1972, in 1986 to reflect the university's name change from Bethany Nazarene College to Southern Nazarene University. The tune used to accompany the lyrics is [[Annie Lisle]], an 1857 ballad composed by [[H.S. Thompson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snu.edu/Websites/snu/Images/Academic%20Affairs/Program%20Dec%202009-Web%20version.pdf|title=SNU Commencement Program |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304131843/http://www.snu.edu/Websites/snu/Images/Academic%20Affairs/Program%20Dec%202009-Web%20version.pdf|archivedate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Star hopping''' is a technique that [[amateur astronomy|amateur astronomers]] often use to locate [[astronomical object]]s in the [[night sky]]. It can be used instead of or in addition to [[setting circle]]s.

==The problem==
Many [[astronomical object|celestial objects]] of interest are too faint to be visible to the unaided eye. [[optical telescope|Telescopes]] or [[binoculars]] collect much more light, making faint objects visible, but have a smaller field of view, thus complicating orientation on the sky. 

The field of view of binoculars is rarely more than eight degrees, while that of typical amateur telescopes may be substantially less than one degree, depending on the magnification used. Many objects are best observed using higher magnifications, which inevitably go along with narrow fields of view.
 
==The technique==
Star hopping uses bright [[star]]s as a guide to finding fainter objects. A knowledge of the relative positions of bright stars and target objects is essential. After planning the star hop with the aid of a [[star chart]], the observer first locates one or more bright stars in a [[finderscope]], [[reflex sight]], or, at a low magnification, with the instrument to be used for observation. The instrument is then moved by one or more increments, possibly using a [[reticle]] to identify specific [[angular distance]]s, to follow identified patterns of stars in the sky, until the target object is reached.

Using a telescope equipped with a properly aligned [[equatorial mount]], the observer may also follow the [[equatorial coordinate system]] on a star map to "hop" or "slide" along the lines of [[right ascension]] or [[declination]] from a well known object to find a target. This can be assisted using setting circles.

Once an instrument is centered on the target object, higher magnifications may be used for observation.

==Example==
[[Image:Hercules constellation map.png|right|thumb|300 px|Star chart showing the constellation Hercules]]
A simple example of star hopping would be finding [[Messier 13]], a [[globular cluster]] in the constellation [[hercules (constellation)|Hercules]], which is too faint to be seen by the unaided eye under most conditions. As shown on the star chart, M 13 lies on a line connecting the stars ζ Herculis and η Herculis. Using star hopping techniques an observer would first identify these two by the naked eye and then point an instrument (binocular or telescope) two thirds of the way up from ζ, one third down from η to site M 13. An observer using a telescope equipped with an equatorial mount would pan down from η in declination to site M 13.

The '''Staten Island boat graveyard''' is a [[Ship graveyard|marine scrapyard]] located in the [[Arthur Kill]] in [[Rossville, Staten Island|Rossville]], near the [[Fresh Kills Landfill]] on the northern shore of [[Staten Island]], [[New York City|New York]]. The place has been recognized as an official dumping ground for old wrecked [[tugboats]], [[barges]] and decommissioned [[Ferry|ferries]]. It is known by many other names including the Witte Marine Scrap Yard, the Arthur Kill Boat Yard, and the "Tugboat Graveyard." Its official name as of 2014 is the Donjon Iron and Metal Scrap Processing Facility.&lt;ref name = "huff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/staten-island-boat-graveyard_n_5544746.html?section=india|title=The Bizarre Attraction That Is New York City's Boat Graveyard|last=Mathias|first=Christopher|date=4 July 2014|newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The scrapyard was founded in the 1930s by John J. Witte and managed by him until his death in 1980. It was then taken over by his son-in-law, Joe Coyne, who described it as similar to an automobile [[Wrecking yard|salvage yard]], with the boats serving as a source of parts to sell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/31/nyregion/a-lesson-in-history-of-old-ships.html|title=A Lesson In History Of Old Ships|last=Meyers|first=Keith|date=December 31, 1990|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is now managed by John Witte's son Arnold. It contains about 100 boats and ships, down from an earlier high of 400.&lt;ref name = "Witte"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/99670-the-witte-boneyard-different-kind-graveyard/|title=The Witte Boneyard: A Different Kind of Graveyard|publisher=[[WNYC]]|date=30 October 2010|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The site==
The abandoned and decomposing vessels, mostly cargo ships and tugboats, come from "all decades of the 20th century".&lt;ref name = "forgotten"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forgotten-ny.com/2010/01/ship-graveyard-rossville-staten-island/|title=Sea of Dead Ships|date=January 27, 2010|work=Forgotten New York|accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They sit in the mud and shallow water until they are dismantled or salvaged. Some of them are historic, so that the place has been called an "accidental marine museum".&lt;ref name = "huff"/&gt; Vessels of historic interest include the submarine chaser {{USS|PC-1264||6}}, the first [[World War II]] US Navy ship to have a predominantly African-American crew; and the [[New York City Fire Department]] [[fireboat]] ''[[Abram S. Hewitt (fireboat)|Abram S.

The site is hard to reach and posted with "No trespassing" signs.&lt;ref name = "wired" /&gt; Nevertheless, visitors do come. Marine historians explore the area via boats or kayaks. The decaying ships are a popular subject for photographers and artists.&lt;ref name = "Witte"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oboylephoto.com/boatyard/by8.htm|title=The Boatyard - Shaun O'Boyle|work=oboylephoto.com|accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The place, because of its eerie environment, has become a tourist attraction,&lt;ref name = "huff" /&gt; despite its remote location and difficult accessibility via "a makeshift path of street signs and wood planks into muddy marshland and to the edge of the water where the boats are visible."&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140321/st-george/history-of-staten-islands-boat-graveyard-explored-documentary|title=History of Staten Island's Boat Graveyard Explored in Documentary|work=DNAinfo New York|last=Rizzi|first=Nicholas|date=21 March 2014|accessdate=25 January 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204030300/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140321/st-george/history-of-staten-islands-boat-graveyard-explored-documentary|archivedate=4 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[chemical engineering]], a '''Stefan tube''' is a device that was devised by [[Josef Stefan]] in 1874.{{sfn|Lienhard|2011|p=651}}  It is often used for measuring [[diffusion coefficient]]s.{{sfn|Lienhard|2011|p=651}}{{sfn|Taylor|Krishna|1993|p=21}}  It comprises a vertical tube, over the top of which a gas flows and at the bottom of which is a pool of [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] liquid that is maintained in a constant-temperature bath.{{sfn|Lienhard|2011|p=651}}{{sfn|Duong|1998|p=343}}{{sfn|Kirwan|1987|p=88}}  The liquid in the pool [[evaporation|evaporates]], [[diffusion|diffuses]] through the gas above it in the tube, and is carried away by the gas flow over the tube mouth at the top.{{sfn|Lienhard|2011|p=651}}{{sfn|Duong|1998|p=343}}  One then measures the fall in the level of the liquid in the tube.{{sfn|Kirwan|1987|p=88}}

The tube conventionally has a narrow diameter, in order to suppress [[convection]].{{sfn|Kirwan|1987|p=88}}

The way that a Stefan tube is modelled, mathematically, is very similar to how one can model the diffusion of [[perfume]] fragrance molecules from (say) a drop of perfume on skin or clothes, evaporating up through the air to a person's nose.  There are some differences between the models.  However, they turn out to have little effect on results at highly dilute vapour concentrations.{{sfn|Teixeira|Rodriguez|Gomes|Mata|2012|pp=75&amp;ndash;77}}

== Analysis ==
{{expand section|date=April 2016}}
In the analysis of the system, various assumptions are made.  The liquid, conventionally denoted '''A''', is neither [[solubility|soluble]] in the gas in the tube, conventionally denoted '''B''', nor [[chemical reaction|react]]s with it.{{sfn|Duong|1998|p=343}}  The decrease in volume of the liquid '''A''' and increase in volume of the gas '''B''' over time can be ignored for the purposes of solving the equations that describe the behaviour, and an assumption can be made that the instantaneous flux at any time is the steady state value.{{sfn|Kirwan|1987|p=88}}{{sfn|Taylor|Krishna|1993|p=21}}  There are no radial or circumferential components to the [[concentration gradient]]s, resulting from convection or turbulence caused by excessively vigorous flow at the upper mouth of the tube, and the diffusion can thus be treated as a simple one-dimensional flow in the vertical direction.{{sfn|Lienhard|2011|p=651}}{{sfn|Taylor|Krishna|1993|p=22}}  The [[mole fraction]] of '''A''' at the upper mouth of the tube is zero, as a consequence of the gas flow.{{sfn|Taylor|Krishna|1993|p=21}}  At the interface between '''A''' and '''B''' the flux of '''B''' is zero (because it is insoluble in '''A''') and the mole fraction is the equilibrium value.{{sfn|Taylor|Krishna|1993|p=22}}{{sfn|Kirwan|1987|p=88}}

The flux of '''B''', denoted '''N&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''', is thus zero throughout the tube,{{sfn|Kirwan|1987|p=88}} its diffusive flux downward (along its concentration gradient) is balanced by its convective flux upward caused by '''A'''.{{sfn|Duong|1998|p=343}}{{sfn|Taylor|Krishna|1993|p=22}}

Applying these assumptions, the system can be modelled using [[Fick's laws of diffusion]]{{sfn|Lienhard|2011|p=653}} or as [[Maxwell–Stefan diffusion]].{{sfn|Taylor|Krishna|1993|p=22}}

'''''The News Letter of the LXIVmos''''' was a near-monthly publication edited by book collector James D. Henderson (writing as "The Scrivener") that ran from 1927 to 1929.{{refn|name=Edison}}  The twenty-one issues focused on [[miniature books]], of which Henderson's collection was already considered to be "the finest ... in the world" when he displayed it at Harvard University as an undergraduate in 1933.{{refn|name=Crimson}} The name comes from the book trade and is read "[[Book size|sixty-four-mos]]", meaning a sheet of paper folded 64 times to form a book with pages of three inches or smaller.{{refn|name=Edison}}  Henderson regularly printed answers from his readers to the question "Why collect miniature books since they are too small to read?", with responses ranging from saving space, to pedagogy, to "Everyone should have a hobby."{{refn|name=Pascoe}}

The editions were printed in a number of different cities around the world, including a special issue{{refn | name=BlackSun}} published by the [[Black Sun Press]] in Paris.{{refn|name=Minkoff}}  Robert Massmann and Ruth Adomeit published an index to the periodical in 1962.{{refn|name=Massmann}}  A [[facsimile]] edition of the complete run was issued in 1968.{{refn|name=facs}} LXIVmos inspired the creation of the later ''Miniature Book News''{{refn|name=Edison}} and is listed, along with several other works by Henderson, in the Miniature Book Society's ''Essential References for a Miniature Book Collector.''{{refn|name=MBS}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17439">[[File:Small Forest Gap.JPG|thumb|Treefall Gap]]

A '''treefall gap''' is a distinguishable hole in a [[forest]] with vertical sides extending through all levels down to an average height of {{cvt|2|m|ft}} above ground.&lt;ref name="brokaw"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brokaw |first=N. |year=1982 |title=The Definition of Treefall Gap and Its Effect on Measures of Forest Dynamics |work=Biotropica |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=158-60}}&lt;/ref&gt; These holes occur as result of a fallen tree or large limb. The [[ecologist]] who developed this definition used two meters because believed that "a regrowth height of 2 m was sufficient" for a gap to be considered closed, but not all scientists agreed.&lt;ref name="sman" /&gt; For example, Runkle believed that regrowth should be {{cvt|10–20|m|ft}} above the ground.&lt;ref name="sman" /&gt; Alternatively, a treefall gap as "the smallest gap [that must] be readily distinguishable amid the complexity of forest structure."&lt;ref name="brokaw" /&gt;

There is no upper limit in gap size. However, it must be caused by a tree or a large limb.&lt;ref name="brokaw" /&gt; For example, a field would not be considered a treefall gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jansen |first=D. H. |year=1990 |title=An abandoned field is not a tree fall gap |publisher=Vida Silvestre Neotropical |volume=2 |pages=64–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tree falls are commonly caused by old age, [[natural hazard]]s, or [[parasitic plant]]s (e.g. certain [[epiphyte]]s).

== Measurement ==
Scientists have not been able to come to a conclusion on one absolute method for measuring a treefall gap. However, there are two types of measurements that are commonly used:

;Two-dimensional
This method does not necessarily take into account irregularity in gap shapes.&lt;ref name="sman"&gt;Schliemann, S., &amp; Bockheim, J. (2011). Methods For Studying Treefall Gaps: A Review. Forest Ecology and Management,2011,1143-1151.&lt;/ref&gt; Most gaps do not conform to one particular shape or another, so assumptions must be made.&lt;ref name="sman" /&gt; Gaps that are uniformly shaped (e.g. ellipse, triangle, etc.) can be quantified by measuring the length and width of each gap.&lt;ref name="sman" /&gt; Commonly, however, the gap is irregularly (i.e. not uniform) shaped and must be divided into smaller sections to be measured individually in order to obtain higher accuracy.&lt;ref name="sman" /&gt;

;Three-dimensional
This method provides a more accurate measurement as it takes into account differences in structure of the gap descending from the canopy to the forest floor.&lt;ref name="sman" /&gt; One of the most recent strategies, pioneered by K. and S.I. Yamamoto, "utilized two photographs of the canopy gap, taken at different heights, and a series of geometric calculations to calculate the gap area." &lt;ref name="sman" /&gt; By doing this, the scientists were able to obtain a more accurate measurement as they are now accounting for differences in structure around the periphery of the gap.

== Gap regeneration ==

=== Length of gap-phase regeneration ===
Recovery time can be rapid (5–7 meters per year) or much slower depending upon the vegetation present in the gap.&lt;ref name="carson"&gt;Carson, W., Mascaro, J., &amp; Schnitzer, S. (2008). TREEFALL GAPS AND THE MAINTENANCE OF PLANT SPECIES DIVERSITY IN TROPICAL FORESTS (CHAPTER 12). In Tropical forest community ecology. Chichester: Wiley-Blackwell Pub.&lt;/ref&gt; Some vegetation can impede growth (see Alternative Pathway of Regeneration below). Gap-phase regeneration is not completed until the intact canopy’s height is met by new growth.&lt;ref name="carson" /&gt;

=== Common regeneration of pathways ===
# Seed: soil contains a number of seeds ([[seed bank]]) that are ready to sprout once they receive sunlight as a result of the gap formed in the canopy.&lt;ref name="carson" /&gt;
# Advanced regeneration: young plants that were originally present prior to the tree fall will quickly grow after being exposed to additional sunlight.&lt;ref name="carson" /&gt;
# Vegetative reproduction: As the tree falls, it will pull other vegetation with it that can begin to reproduce within the newly formed gap.&lt;ref name="carson" /&gt; This is especially true for [[Liana]]s (see Alternative Pathway of Regeneration below).
# Spreading laterally into the gap from the surrounding forest.&lt;ref name="carson" /&gt;

=== Alternative pathway of regeneration ===
[[Lianas]] are a common woody vine found in tropical forests. These vines utilize trees to venture into the canopy in search of sunlight and nutrients. Thus, when a tree falls, it brings all the Liana growth with it. Following a tree fall, Lianas have a high survival rate (~90%) and they can quickly begin sprouting.&lt;ref name="schnitzer"&gt;Schnitzer, S., Dalling, J., &amp; Carson, W. (2000). The impact of lianas on tree regeneration in tropical forest canopy gaps: Evidence for an alternative pathway of gap-phase regeneration.Journal of Ecology, 88(4), 655-666.&lt;/ref&gt; This causes potential problems as new trees begin to grow but are unable or are limited by the presence of Lianas. Many gaps have been found to enter a state where growth has been halted due to Lianas. Therefore, scientists have begun looking into their effects on gap regeneration. A study conducted on [[Barro Colorado Island]] found that lianas play a likely role in slowing gap-regeneration time.&lt;ref name="schnitzer" /&gt; Lianas have been able to keep a gap in a low-canopy state, and this is especially true for gaps that are thirteen plus years old.&lt;ref name="schnitzer" /&gt; Further studies by Schnitzer et al. have shown that as Lianas increase in density, species richness and [[Pioneer species|pioneer tree]] density decrease for all gaps (i.e. low and high canopy gaps).&lt;ref name="schnitzer" /&gt; This data suggests that Lianas play a significant role in gap-regeneration time.

== Intermediate disturbance hypothesis and species abundance ==
Treefall gaps are important in maintenance of some plant species diversity.  Disturbance is important in tropics as a mechanism for maintaining diversity. According to the [[intermediate disturbance hypothesis]] (IDH), some disturbance is critical and the maximum number of species will be found where the “frequency and intensity” of disturbances are at an intermediate scale.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Connell, J. (1978). Diversity of Tropical Rainforests and Coral Reefs. Science,4335, 1302-1310.&lt;/ref&gt; IDH helps explain the Gap Hypothesis which postulates that more light and more diverse resources caused by the falling of a canopy tree may aid in more species abundance.&lt;ref name="carson" /&gt; Although treefall gaps have been shown to promote species diversity among a variety of species, a gap’s effect on different species is likely to produce mixed results (i.e. some species will experience more diversity due to gaps while others will not).

== Light penetration ==
[[File:Treefall gap in Institute Woods.jpg|thumb|A felled tree allows direct sunlight to reach the forest floor.]]
The creation of a treefall gap causes a break in the canopy to form, allowing light to penetrate through to the understory. This light can now reach [[shrub]]s and treelet species, which under normal circumstances never grow tall enough to reach the canopy.&lt;ref name="puerta" /&gt; Under a normal canopy (i.e. one where there is no treefall gap), there is very little light that filters through, placing a light limitation on the understory plant community.&lt;ref name="canham"&gt;Canham, C., Denslow, J., Platt, W., Runkle, J., Spies, T., &amp; White, P. (1990). Light regimes beneath closed canopies and tree-fall gaps in temperate and tropical forests. Canadian Journal of Forest Research-Revue Canadienne de Recherche Forestiere, 20(5), 620-631. {{doi|10.1139/x90-084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This light limitation often restricts a plant’s reproduction and growing ability.&lt;ref name="canham" /&gt; When a treefall gap forms, there is a distinguishable difference in the amount of light that penetrates through to the lower levels of the forest;&lt;ref name="canham" /&gt; however, the amount of light that is now able to penetrate depends on how big the gap actually is.&lt;ref name="canham" /&gt; A treefall gap that is only 5 meters in diameter will allow less light to reach the understory than a larger gap that is 10 meters wide. In addition, a smaller gap will receive more direct radiation from the sun, whereas a larger gap will receive high amounts of diffuse radiation.&lt;ref name="canham" /&gt; The increased amount of light that is now available to the understory community will release them from their previous light limitation.&lt;ref name="canham" /&gt;

== Seed dispersal ==
[[Seed dispersal]] in treefall gaps is significantly reduced compared to normal understory areas.&lt;ref name="puerta"&gt;Puerta-Piñero, C., Muller-Landau, H. C., Calderón, O., &amp; Wright, S. J. (2013). Seed arrival in tropical forest tree fall gaps. Ecology, 94(7), 1552-1562. {{doi|10.1890/12-1012.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study suggested that within the first three years after the gaps formed, the seed dispersal rate was 72% lower than the rates in nearby understory.&lt;ref name="puerta" /&gt; Most forms of dispersal, such as wind and animal dispersal, show a reduction in the number of seeds dispersed.&lt;ref name="puerta" /&gt;  However, explosive dispersion shows an increase &lt;ref name="puerta" /&gt; Explosive dispersion describes a mechanism by which the parent plant ejects its seeds using pressure, ensuring that they land far from the parent plant.&lt;ref name="puerta" /&gt; This type of dispersal is used in several shrub species. The increase shows that treefall gaps have a positive effect on the seed dispersal of shrubs.&lt;ref name="puerta" /&gt; These shrubs either survived the creation of the gap or migrated in soon after it was created.&lt;ref name="puerta" /&gt; Due to their unique method of dispersal, these plants have an advantage when colonizing the gap. As the treefall gap ages and the canopy layer begins to return to normal, other forms of seed dispersal begin to increase in frequency, eventually returning to their pre-gap values years after its formation.&lt;ref name="puerta" /&gt;	

== Species diversity ==

=== Flora ===

It is proposed that treefall gaps maintain plant species diversity in tropical forests in three main ways. First of all, they create habitats that have a lot of light.&lt;ref name="carson" /&gt; Being in an area that now contains a high amount of light allows species that cannot grow in total or partial shade to develop rapidly. Due to the new levels of light, competition between the shade intolerant species and the species that prefer low levels of light would be eliminated.&lt;ref name="carson" /&gt; This release from competition would allow the number of shade intolerant species to increase. Second, species may be able to survive on resources that spread from the middle of the gap all the way to the surrounding denser forest.&lt;ref name="carson" /&gt; Tree or plant diversity may be maintained by the distribution and sharing of resources over a gradient if species are uniquely adapted to the resources available in a specific treefall gap.&lt;ref name="carson" /&gt; Lastly, the rate of regeneration of different species may differ based on the size of the gap. While species diversity may vary when the treefall gaps differ greatly in size, it has been argued that it is highly unlikely.&lt;ref name="carson" /&gt; This is due to the fact that the relationship between gap size and the microclimate is irregular because of the large spatial and temporal deviation in microclimate.&lt;ref name="carson" /&gt; Support for these three hypotheses is mixed, but there is evidence that supports the fact that some species of plants benefit from being in gaps more than others. In tropical forests, gaps maintain the diversity of some plant groups, which could possibly contain much of the vascular plant community in these areas.&lt;ref name="carson" /&gt;

=== Insects ===

Treefall gaps, like the rest of tropical forests, contain an abundant number of animal species. As with all tropical habitats, insects make up the majority of the animal biomass.

==== Leaf litter ant assemblages ====

It has been thought that the development of treefall gaps would cause harm to the development of leaf litter ant assemblages, but that is not the case according to one study. Species of ants that are found in treefall gaps are the same species that are found in the actual densely wooded forests that surround them.&lt;ref name="patrick"&gt;Patrick, M., Fowler, D., Dunn, R., &amp; Sanders, N. (n.d.). Effects of Treefall Gap Disturbances on Ant Assemblages in a Tropical Montane Cloud Forest. Biotropica, N/a-N/a.&lt;/ref&gt;
The formations of these gaps seem to have little to no effect on the ant species living there.&lt;ref name="patrick" /&gt;

==== Fruit-feeding nymphalid butterfly assemblages ====

There have been studies that show a noticeable difference in the species diversity of butterflies in treefall gaps and those in the surrounding understory. The type of vegetation present in the gaps play a key role in determining which species of butterfly lived there.&lt;ref name="pardonnet"&gt;Pardonnet, S., Beck, H., Milberg, P., &amp; Bergman, K. (2013). Effect of Tree-Fall Gaps on Fruit-Feeding Nymphalid Butterfly Assemblages in a Peruvian Rain Forest. Biotropica, 612-619.&lt;/ref&gt; This supports the hypothesis that in a natural forest, treefall gaps will promote species diversity.&lt;ref name="pardonnet"/&gt;

== Treefall gaps, blow-downs, and the carbon cycle ==
Where treefall gaps are usually formed by falling trees or branches due to old age or disease, large-scale blow-downs are caused by squall lines, which generate heavy rain and strong winds.&lt;ref name="Negron"&gt;Negrón‐Juárez, R. I., Chambers, J. Q., Guimaraes, G., Zeng, H., Raupp, C. F. M., Marra, D. M., Ribeiro, G. H. P. M., et al.(2010). Widespread Amazon forest tree mortality from a single cross‐basin squall line event. Geophysical Research Letters. {{doi|10.1029/2010GL043733}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have measured the downburst speed of these winds to be between 26 and 41&amp;nbsp;m/s, which is enough force to cause large-scale blow-downs.&lt;ref name="Negron" /&gt; Studies have shown that small-scale disturbances, such as treefall gaps forming after tree deaths, have a higher reoccurrence rate than do large-scale disturbances, such as blow-downs.&lt;ref name="Santo"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Espírito-Santo|first1=Fernando D.B.|last2=Gloor|first2=Manuel|last3=Keller|first3=Michael|last4=Malhi|first4=Yadvinder|authorlink4=Yadvinder Malhi|last5=Saatchi|first5=Sassan|last6=Nelson|first6=Bruce|last7=Junior|first7=Raimundo C. Oliveira|last8=Pereira|first8=Cleuton|last9=Lloyd|first9=Jon|last10=Frolking|first10=Steve|last11=Palace|first11=Michael|last12=Shimabukuro|first12=Yosio E.|last13=Duarte|first13=Valdete|last14=Mendoza|first14=Abel Monteagudo|last15=López-González|first15=Gabriela|last16=Baker|first16=Tim R.|last17=Feldpausch|first17=Ted R.|last18=Brienen|first18=Roel J.W.|last19=Asner|first19=Gregory P.|last20=Boyd|first20=Doreen S.|last21=Phillips|first21=Oliver L.|title=Size and frequency of natural forest disturbances and the Amazon forest carbon balance|journal=[[Nature Communications]]|year=2014|issn=2041-1723|doi=10.1038/ncomms4434|pmid=24643258 |pmc=4273466 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the fact that small-scale disturbances are more frequent, they account for about 88% of carbon emissions from the Amazon and for more biomass loss then do large-scale disturbances.&lt;ref name="Santo" /&gt; These small disturbances add carbon into the environment and back into the carbon cycle; however, it is not a significant amount when compared to how much carbon is being sequestered in the above ground biomass. Because of this, the Amazon is considered to be a [[carbon sink]].&lt;ref name="Santo" /&gt;

== Use of satellite technology in research ==

When researchers attempt to locate treefall gaps on a broad scale, it can be difficult to do so on the ground. This is due to the large scale of the forests that they are generally focusing on. Satellite imagery has proven quite useful for large-scale disturbances such as blow-downs, but remains difficult for small-scale disturbances such as treefall gaps. In some instances [[Global Positioning System]]s (GPS) are used to map the centers of treefall gaps in order to determine their frequency.&lt;ref name="Santo2"&gt;Espírito-Santo, F., Keller, M., Linder, E., Oliveira Junior, R., Pereira, C., 
&amp; Oliveira, C. (2013). Gap formation and carbon cycling in the Brazilian Amazon: Measurement using high-resolution optical remote sensing and studies in large forest plots. Plant Ecology &amp; Diversity, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Pictures taken by these satellites are radiometrically changed from numbers into physical units.&lt;ref name="Santo2" /&gt; Light Detection and Ranging ([[Lidar|LiDAR]]) is used to distinguish canopy gaps on spatial scales for separating the different types of gaps.&lt;ref&gt;Ashner, G., Kellner, J., Kennedy-Bowdoin, T., Knapp, D., &amp; Anderson, C. (2013). 
Forest Canopy Gap Distributions in the Southern Peruvian Amazon.&lt;/ref&gt; With satellite imaging, steps have to be implemented to remove extraneous details such as seas, rivers, clouds, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Thevand, A., Gond, V., &amp; De Alcantara, E. (n.d.). Detection 
Of Gaps In An Atlantic Mangrove Forest Using Optical Satellite Imagery&lt;/ref&gt; These can interfere with the results. Overall, the mapping of treefall gaps has progressed greatly since the development of satellite technology.
