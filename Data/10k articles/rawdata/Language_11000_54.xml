'''Abu Bashar Mohammad Ishaque''' (1 November 1926 – 2003) was a Bangladeshi novelist.

==Life==
Ishaque was born in the village Shirangol of [[Naria Upazila]] in [[Shariatpur]] District on 1 November 1926.

[[File:Paddington basement.jpg|thumb|Area railing and steps on a [[terraced house]] in Australia]]
In [[architecture]], an '''area''' ('''areaway''' in North America) is an excavated, [[Subterranea (geography)|subterranean]] space around the walls of a building, designed to admit light into a [[basement]]. Also called a [[lightwell]], it often provides access to the house for [[tradesmen]] and deliveries to vaults under the pavement; it stores coal and ash.

==Function==
The term is most commonly applied to urban houses of the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] period in the [[UK]], where it was normal for the service rooms, such as the [[kitchen]], [[Scullery (room)|scullery]] and [[laundry]], to be in the basement. Areas were commonly enclosed for safety reasons by wrought iron or cast iron railings, which became one of the principal decorative features of the [[astylar]] [[terraced house]]s of this period. Areas are also found in the English and French [[country house]], where basements were popular in the 18th century as a way of accommodating service functions while allowing all four faces of a symmetrical Classical building to relate directly to its landscape setting, as at [[Mereworth Castle]] in [[Kent]] or [[The Abbey, Skirwith]] in [[Cumberland]]. Basements, and consequently areas, decreased in popularity in the 19th century, as attitudes to servants changed, although they continued to be constructed as service accommodation in urban settings where land was at a premium until the early 20th century.  A suburban residential application can be seen at the [[Gamble House (Pasadena, California)|Gamble House]] in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], California, to light the laundry and service areas of the expansive basement.

In early 18th-century house descriptions, the area was usually called the "airy", which suggests that its primary function was ventilation, needed to prevent cooking smells from percolating upstairs to the rooms above.  This implies that the term "area" was a corruption of "airey" rather than vice versa.&lt;ref name=candb&gt;D. Cruickshank and N. Burton, ''Life in the Georgian city'', 1990, pp.52-53, 83-85&lt;/ref&gt;

==Airey==
In [[North London]], it was known colloquially as "the airey". It is a subject of an old-time children's ball-bouncing rhyme, which begins: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"One, two, three, alairy &lt;br&gt;
My ball is down the airey &lt;br&gt;
Don't forget to give it to Mary&lt;br&gt;
Early in the morning".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Baale''' language, ''Baleesi'' or ''Baalesi'', is an [[Eastern Sudanic languages|Eastern Sudanic language]] of [[Ethiopia]] and [[South Sudan]], spoken by the Baale or Zilmamo people of Ethiopia, and by the [[Kichepo people|Kachepo]] of South Sudan.&lt;ref name="Dim"&gt;Dimmendaal, Gerrit. 2002. "Sociolinguistic Survey Report on Tirma, Chai, Baale, and Mursi" ''SIL Electronic Survey Reports'' 2002-033.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a member of the [[Surmic]] cluster and is also known as [[Suri language|Suri]], evoking an [[ethnonym]] that  embraces the [[Tirma]], Chai (or T'id), and Baale communities.&lt;ref name="Dim" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moller"&gt;Möller, Mirjam. 2009. ''Vowel Harmony in Bale - A Study of ATR Harmony in a Surmic Language of Ethiopia''. BA thesis. University of Stockholm. [http://su.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:233078/FULLTEXT01.pdf Online access]&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently 9,000 native speakers of Baleesi, 5,000 in South Sudan and {{sigfig|4,120|2}} in Ethiopia; almost all of these are monolingual.&lt;ref name="e18"/&gt;

==General information==
Baleesi can be alternately referred to as Baalesi, Baale, Bale, Baaye, Dok, Kacipo-Balesi, Kachepo, Silmamo, Tsilmano, Zelmamu, Zilmamu and Zulmamu.&lt;ref name="Dim" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moller" /&gt;&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt;
:"The Baale call their language Baalesi. They are also referred to as Zilmamo, which is the name of their country, situated west and south of Jeba town, towards the border with Sudan. The Gimira call the Baale people and their language Baaye, whereas the Anywak refer to them as Dok. The Baale people call the neighboring Dizi people Saara, and the Amhara are referred to as Goola. Baale is also spoken across the border in Sudan, in an area known as Kachepo, which is the name used by the neighboring Toposa, Juje, and Murle for the Baale people and their country."&lt;ref name="Dim" /&gt;

There are no known dialects of Baleesi, but it is closely related to the Didinga-Murle cluster,&lt;ref name="Dim" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moller" /&gt; which consists of [[Didinga language|Didinga]], [[Tennet language|Tennet]], and [[Narim language|Larim]] in Sudan, and [[Murle language|Murle]] in both Sudan and Ethiopia.&lt;ref name="Dim" /&gt; It shares 40%-54% lexical similarity with Murle and 35% lexical similarity with [[Mursi language|Mursi]].&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt;

It is spoken in Rumeat, Upper Boma, and Mewun villages, [[Pibor County]], [[Boma State]], located near the Ethiopian border.&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt; It is also spoken in the northwestern corner of [[East Equatoria]] State.&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt;

The Baleesi counting system is based on twenty and uses the same [[quinary]] system as does the Didinga-Murle cluster. The word for "1,000" literally means "plenty," and everything greater than 100 is referred to as "a lot."&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Eugene S. L. 2013. [http://lingweb.eva.mpg.de/numeral/Baalesi.htm "Baalesi"] at [http://lingweb.eva.mpg.de/numeral/ ''Numeral Systems of the World's Languages''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421165028/http://lingweb.eva.mpg.de/numeral/ |date=2014-04-21 }}. Leipzig, Germany: The Department of Linguistics, Max Planck Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Tirma, Chai, and Baale people form an ethnic unit called [[Surma people|Suri]], sharing similar age-set systems, common ceremonies, and material cultures, their languages are only distantly related.&lt;ref name="Dim" /&gt;

There is no known writing system for Baleesi and it is regarded as an unwritten language. The language status is classified as vigorous, meaning that it is unstandardized and in use by all ages.&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt; However, it may still be considered an endangered language due to the relatively small population of native speakers in existence.

==Speakers==
The Baale have a positive attitude towards their language, and use it in most areas of life besides the market.&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt; Some Baale people can speak Tirma or Chai along with Baleesi, and a few also speak [[Dizin language|Dizi]] or [[Amharic]].&lt;ref name="Dim" /&gt; 

Speakers of Baleesi include non-native individuals as well. In Jeba town, there are [[Dizi people|Dizi]] people who speak Baleesi as a second language, and often serve as intermediaries between local or regional traders and the Baale people when they come to the market.&lt;ref name="Dim" /&gt; 

The literacy rate of both [[first-language]] and [[second language|second-language]] speakers is below 1%.&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt;

===Culture===
The Baale share many aspects of culture with their fellow [[Surma people|Suri people]]. For example, a practice common among the tribes of the Surma (including the Baale), is the insertion of a [[Lip plate|clay plate]] into the bottom lip of young girls and women.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFxewHax_ow Video depicting Surma women wearing lip plates]&lt;/ref&gt;
Another ritual the Suri take part in is called the [[Stick fighting|Donga]], which involves champions of teams from different clans and villages fighting in pairs using long wooden sticks. The ritual is used as a way to resolve conflicts on either an individual or higher level.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR0h9ncCl9Q Video depicting the Donga stick fighting festival]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''book hand''' was any of several stylized [[handwriting]] [[Penmanship|script]]s used during ancient and medieval times. It was intended for legibility and often used in transcribing official documents (prior to the development of [[printing]] and similar technologies).

In [[palaeography]] and [[calligraphy]] the term ''hand'' is still used to refer to a named style of writing, such as the ''[[chancery hand]]''.

In oil drilling, a '''casing head'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=casinghead Schumberger: Oilfield Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt; is a simple metal [[flange]] welded or screwed onto the top of the [[conductor pipe]] (also known as ''drive-pipe'') or the [[casing (borehole)|casing]] and forms part of the [[wellhead]] system for the well.

This is the primary interface for the surface pressure control equipment, for example [[blowout preventer]]s (for well drilling) or the [[christmas tree (oil well)|Christmas tree]] (for well production).

The casing head, when installed, is typically tested to very strict pressure and leak-off parameters to insure viability under [[Blowout (well drilling)|blowout]] conditions, before any surface equipment is installed.

==Early campaigns==
In 1971 Maher founded the UK's first community newspaper, the ''Tuebrook Bugle'',&lt;ref name="ldp-inspiration"&gt;{{cite news  | url = http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/regional-news/2010/07/16/phil-redmond-chrissie-maher-a-story-of-inspiration-and-aspiration-92534-26864566/  | title = Chrissie Maher—a story of inspiration and aspiration  | last = Redmond  | first = Phil  | date = 16 July 2010  | accessdate = 30 September 2010  | newspaper = Liverpool Daily Post  | location = Liverpool  | publisher = Trinity Mirror North West &amp; North Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt; which gave her the chance to write articles demanding that organisations start using [[plain language|plain English]]. In 1974 Maher started ''The Liverpool News'',&lt;ref name="ljmu-speech"/&gt; the UK's first newspaper for adults with reading difficulties. She was also a member of the UK's [[National Consumer Council]].

==Plain English Campaign==
Maher officially launched Plain English Campaign at a demonstration in London in 1979.
In 1994, as an example of the linguistic issues she found objectionable, Maher pointed out that Britain's [[National Health Service]] published a definition of the term ''bed'' that used 229 words.&lt;ref name="ldp-inspiration"/&gt;
[[Tom McArthur (linguist)|Tom McArthur]], editor of the Oxford Companion to the English Language said, "In all the history of the language, there has never been such a powerful grassroots movement to influence it as the Plain English Campaign."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/38503.stm  | title = Plain speaking is no joke  | work = BBC News  | date = 10 December 1997  | accessdate = 30 September 2010  | publisher = BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, an industrial tribunal found that the Plain English Campaign had [[constructive dismissal|constructively dismissed]] two employees, Martin Nobbs and Jill Cushway, who resigned from the Campaign after unfounded rumors were spread that they had an affair. In their action, Nobbs and Cushway alleged that Maher had started the rumors.  Maher denied starting the rumor, calling the tribunal's decision "a miscarriage of justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/how-to-slag-off-your-old-boss-in-plain-english-1292977.html  | title = How to slag off your old boss, in plain English  | newspaper = The Independent  | last = Sengupta  | first = Kim  | date = 9 November 1997  | accessdate = 30 September 2010  | publisher = Independent Print  | location = London }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Plainly+speaking%2c+my+office+affair+is+just+a+rumour.-a0110771367  | title = Plainly speaking, my office affair is just a rumour  | last = Oldfield  | first = Stephen  | newspaper = The Daily Mail  | location = London  | date = 4 November 1997  | accessdate = 4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10438">'''Contrastive rhetoric''' is the study of how a person's first language and his or her culture influence [[second language writing|writing in a second language]] or how a common language is used among different cultures. The term was first coined by the American [[applied linguistics|applied linguist]] Robert Kaplan in 1966 to denote eclecticism and subsequent growth of collective knowledge in certain languages.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Robert. (1966). Cultural thought patterns in intercultural education. ''[[Language acquisition|Language Learning]]'' 16(1): 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt; It was widely expanded from 1996 to today by [[Finns|Finnish]]-born, US-based applied linguist Ulla Connor,&lt;ref name="Connor 1996"&gt;Connor, Ulla. (1996). ''Contrastive rhetoric: Cross-cultural aspects of second-language writing''. Cambridge, UK: [[Cambridge University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; among others. Since its inception the area of study has had a significant impact on the exploration of intercultural discourse structures that extend beyond the target language's native forms of discourse organization. The field brought attention to cultural and associated linguistic habits in expression of English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nordquist|first=Robert|title=Contrastive Rhetoric on About.com|publisher=[[About.com]]|url=http://grammar.about.com/od/c/g/Contrastive-Rhetoric.htm|accessdate=2015-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This acceptance of dialect geography was especially welcomed in the United States on ESL instruction, as an emphasis on particular style in [[Spoken language|spoken-language]] and writing skills was previously dominated in both [[English language learning and teaching|English as a second language]] (ESL) and [[English as a foreign language]] (EFL) classes.&lt;ref&gt;Cai, Guanjun. (1998). "Contrastive Rhetoric." ''Theorizing Composition: A Critical Sourcebook of Theory and Scholarship in Contemporary Composition Studies'', ed. by Mary Lynch Kennedy. Greenwood.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends==

Since 1966, when Kaplan’s original work on contrastive rhetoric appeared, and 1996, when Ulla Connor’s book on contrastive rhetoric reinvigorated interest in the area, new trends have appeared in research approaches and methods.&lt;ref&gt;Connor, Ulla., Nagelhout, E., &amp; Rozycki, W. (Eds.) (2008). "Introduction" ''Contrastive Rhetoric: Reaching to Intercultural Rhetoric'', John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt;  The change has been affected by three major developments—the acknowledgment of more genres with specific textual requirements, increased awareness of the social contexts of writing, and the need for an alternative conceptual framework that takes a more critical perspective of contrastive rhetoric—have motivated scholars of contrastive rhetoric to adjust and supplement research approaches in their work.

===EAP and other genres===
First, there was a marked increase in the types of written texts considered the purview of [[second language writing]] around the world.&lt;ref&gt;ETIC (1975). English for academic study: Problems and perspectives. ETIC Occasional Paper. London: The British Council.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Connor, Ulla. (2004). Introduction. ''Journal of English for Academic Purposes'' 3: 271-276.&lt;/ref&gt; [[English for Academic Purposes]] (EAP) classes teach other types of writing besides the student essay required in college classes.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, R.R. (1997). ''English for academic purposes: A guide and resource book for teachers''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Connor, Ulla. (2004). Intercultural rhetoric research: Beyond texts. ''Journal of English for Academic Purposes'' 3: 291-304&lt;/ref&gt;  Other important genres are the academic research article, research report, and grant proposal.  Writing for professional purposes, such as business, is also now considered a legitimate type of second language writing and worthy of research and teaching.&lt;ref name="Intercultural Rhetoric"&gt;{{cite web|last=Connor|first=Ulla|title=Intercultural Rhetoric and EAP/ESP|publisher=[[National University of Singapore]]|url=http://nus.edu.sg/celc/symposium/Keynote%20Address%20-%20Ulla%20Connor.pdf|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
===Socially situated writing===
Second, in addition to the expansion of the genre, textual analysis has moved contrastive rhetoric to emphasize the social situation of writing.&lt;ref&gt;Bazerman, Charles, &amp; Prior, Paul. (Eds.). (2004). ''What writing does and how it does it: An introduction to analyzing texts and textual practices''. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, writing is increasingly regarded as being socially situated; each situation may entail special consideration to audience, purposes, level of perfection, and correspondingly may require varying amounts of revision, collaboration, and attention to detail.&lt;ref&gt;McCool, Matthew. (2009). Writing around the world: a guide to writing across cultures. London: Continuum.&lt;/ref&gt; The expectations and norms of discourse communities or communities of practice (cultural and disciplinary) may shape these situational expectations and practices. This is where contrastive rhetoric overlaps with [[social constructionism]], which sees approaches to textual meaning as dynamic, socio-cognitive activities.  Instead of analyzing what texts "mean," the interest is to understand how they construct meaning.  Bazerman and Prior (2004, p.&amp;nbsp;6) pose three questions to guide the analysis of writing:

* “What does the text talk about?”
* “How do texts influence audiences?”
* “How do texts come into being?”

===Critical contrastive rhetoric===
Third, in response to criticisms that challenge traditional contrastive rhetoric, an alternative conceptual framework known as ''critical contrastive rhetoric'' has been established that maintains a critical understanding of the politics of cultural difference.  Critical contrastive rhetoric explores issues such as critical thinking&lt;ref name="McKinley"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKinley|first1=Jim|title=Displaying critical thinking in EFL academic writing: A discussion of Japanese to English contrastive rhetoric|journal=RELC Journal|date=2013|volume=44|issue=2|pages=195-208|url=http://www.englishappliedlinguistics.com/uploads/2/4/1/9/2419477/relc_mckinley_contrastive_rhetoric_2013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; in teaching situations that challenge essentialism. It takes into consideration [[poststructuralist]], [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial]], and [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] critiques of language and culture, in order to reconceptualize cultural difference in rhetoric. In practice, it "affirms multiplicity of languages, rhetorical forms, and students’ identities, while problematizing the discursive construction of rhetoric and identities, and thus allowing writing teachers to recognize the complex web of rhetoric, culture, power, and discourse in responding to student writing."&lt;ref name="Kubota"&gt;Kubota, Ryuko &amp; Lehner, Al. (2004). Toward critical contrastive rhetoric. ''Journal of Second Language Writing'', 13, 7–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Questions of relevance==

In the early 2000s, some postmodern and [[critical pedagogy]] writers in the [[second language writing]] field, began referring to contrastive rhetoric as if it had been frozen in space.&lt;ref name="Kubota" /&gt;  Over the years, the term contrastive rhetoric had started to gain a negative connotation, even negatively affecting writing in a second language.&lt;ref name="Connor 1996" /&gt;  Understood by many as Kaplan’s original work, contrastive rhetoric was increasingly characterized as static, and linked to [[contrastive analysis]], a movement associated with [[Structuralism|structural linguistics]] and [[behavioralism]].  Many of the contributions made to contrastive rhetoric from the late 1960s to the early 1990s have been ignored.  In a 2002 article, Connor&lt;ref&gt;Connor, Ulla. (2002). New directions in contrastive rhetoric. [[English as a Foreign or Second Language|TESOL]] Quarterly 36: 493-510.&lt;/ref&gt; attempted to address these criticisms and to offer new directions for a viable contrastive rhetoric.  In addressing the critiques, she aimed to draw attention to the broad scope of contrastive rhetoric and determined that a new term would better encompass the essence of contrastive rhetoric in its current state.  To distinguish between the often-quoted “static” model and the new advances that have been made, Connor suggests it may be useful to begin using the term '''intercultural rhetoric''' instead of contrastive rhetoric to refer to the current models of cross-cultural research.&lt;ref name="Intercultural Rhetoric" /&gt;

According to Connor, the term ''intercultural rhetoric'' better describes the broadening trends of expression across languages and cultures.  It preserves the traditional approaches that use [[textual analysis]], [[genre analysis]], and [[corpus linguistics|corpus analysis]], yet also introduces [[ethnographic]] approaches that examine language in interactions.  Furthermore, it connotes the analysis of texts that allows for dynamic definitions of culture and the inclusion of smaller cultures (e.g., disciplinary, classroom) in the analysis.

While Connor continues to use the term ''intercultural rhetoric'', scholars outside the United States looking at specific language differences (e.g. English and Japanese&lt;ref name="McKinley" /&gt; and English and Spanish&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jiménez Ramirez|first=Jorge.|title=Cómo aumentar la calidad de la escritura en la enseñanza de español" (How to improve texts in Spanish as a Second Language)|publisher=Actas XXI Congreso Internacional ASELE. Cáceres (Spain): Ediciones de la Universidad de Extremadura|url=http://es.scribd.com/doc/50447552/MEJORA-ESCRITURA-CON-LA-RETORICA-CONTRASTIVA-ESPANOL-INGLES-Jorge-Jimenez|date=2010|accessdate=2015-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanchez-Escobar, Ángel F. (2012). ''A Contrastive Analysis of the Rhetorical Patterns of English and Spanish Expository Journal Writing''. CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform.&lt;/ref&gt;) consider this to be a loaded label and continue to use the term ''contrastive rhetoric'' for the distinctiveness the theory shows and for the freedom of using tools to assess and understand the field in a non-restrictive manner.

==Background==
Data over signalling was designed as a solution to the problem of transceiving [[simultaneous voice and data]].

Data over signalling can be utilized when the signalling channel is either [[Channel Associated Signaling|channel associated]] or [[Common Channel Signaling|common]].  However, it is easier to implement when the signalling channel is channel associated, as the system does not have to demultiplex the data and signalling between multiple subscribers.

DoS was designed so that mobile telephony subscribers could maintain a voice session on their bearer channel while still accessing data related services, such as [[text messaging]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1146">'''Duplicity''' is the [[Error (law)|error]] committed when the charge (known as a ''count'') on an [[indictment]] describes two different [[offense (law)|offences]].

An indictment may contain more than one count, but each count must allege only one offence, so that the [[defendant]] (and the [[jury]]) can know precisely what offences he or she is accused of. If a count is poorly drafted so that it alleges two offences, it is said to be "duplicitous". A duplicitous count is defective and must be [[Motion to quash|quashed]] by the [[judge]], unless the judge permits the count to be amended so that it only alleges one offence, or is split into two counts. If a duplicitous count is not noticed until after the defendant has been convicted on it, the [[verdict]] may be [[Void (law)|void]].

Duplicity is a completely different situation from when two different counts each allege the same offence, which is sometimes wrongly referred to as duplicity.

'''Eva Gabrielsson''' (born 17 November 1953) is a Swedish architect, author, political activist, feminist, and the long-time partner of the late Swedish mystery novelist [[Stieg Larsson]].

==Life with Larsson==
Gabrielsson and Stieg Larsson lived together from 1974 until his death in 2004. Larsson was one of the foremost experts in Sweden on anti-democratic, extreme right-wing, and neo-Nazi movements. Gabrielsson says she and Larsson never married because he had believed his anti-fascist work could have put her at risk if there was a paper trail linking them legally or financially.&lt;ref&gt;Esther Addley [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/02/stieg-larsson-partner-sweden-inheritance "The Girl in the £20m Inheritance Battle – partner of late novelist Stieg Larsson fights for share of fortune"], ''The Guardian'', 2 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Because they were never married and Larsson died without leaving a will, his estate went to his father and brother, in accordance with Swedish law. Larsson was somewhat estranged from his father Erland and his brother Joakim because nine years of his childhood were spent happily living with his grandparents in the northern country of Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;David J. Fuller [http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/books/real-life-stieg-larsson-tale-like-a-norse-saga-124532494.html "Real-life Stieg Larsson Tale like a Norse Saga"], ''Winnipeg Free Press'', 25 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deirdre  Donahue [http://books.usatoday.com/book/eva-gabrielsson-with-marie-francoise-colomban-there-are-things-i-want-you-to-know-about-stieg-larsson-and-me/r765648 "'There Are Things I Want You To Know' About Stieg Larsson and Me' by Eva Gabrielsson with Marie-Francoise Colombani"], ''USA Today'' 20 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; “It is as if my identity has been erased. It’s like being dispossessed,” Gabrielsson said to a reporter in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Porter [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/books/article1737265.ece "Exclusive: Anna Porter talks to Stieg Larsson’s life partner"], ''Globe and Mail'' (Toronto), 10 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Since shortly after his death, Gabrielsson has been negotiating with Joakim and Erland Larsson over control of Larsson's work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/27292/20100617/ "Eva Gabrielsson refuses Larsson family offer"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625232251/http://www.thelocal.se/27292/20100617/ |date=June 25, 2011 }}, ''The Local'' (Sweden), 17 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, Larsson's father and brother offered Gabrielsson roughly $3.3 million, but she continues to fight for the literary rights of Larsson's work. One source interviewed a friend who said that Gabrielsson "will not be bought".&lt;ref&gt;Gary Yerkey [http://www.csmonitor.com/Books/chapter-and-verse/2011/0614/Stieg-Larsson-s-companion-prepares-for-the-book-tour-he-never-took "Stieg Larsson's Companion Prepares for the Book Tour He Never Took"], ''Christian Science Monitor'', 14 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Gabrielsson's memoir, ''[["There Are Things I Want You to Know" About Stieg Larsson and Me]]'', chronicles their life together and puts Larsson's often chaotic life into context. Gabrielsson, in one interview, explains that she did not start the memoir with the intention of writing a book; rather, it all stemmed from diary entries that Gabrielsson was writing in order to deal with the grief of losing her partner.&lt;ref&gt;Geoff Pevere [http://www.toronto.com/article/690733 "Life after Larsson"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928050828/http://www.toronto.com/article/690733 |date=September 28, 2011 }}, Toronto.com, 27 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The title of her [[book]] comes from a love letter that Larsson wrote to Gabrielsson when he thought he might die during a trip to Africa in 1977. The letter is included in the memoir along with the details of Larsson's trip to Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Vibhuti Patel [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303339904576406102208883590 "Interview With Eva Gabrielsson: Straight Talk on Stieg Larsson"], ''Wall Street Journal'', 25 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Her partner, she says, was a feminist, a hopeless businessman, a journalist who could not hold down a staff job, and a passionate fighter and investigator for social causes and against the Far Right.&lt;ref&gt;John Lichfield [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/my-role-in-stieg-larssons-success-by-partner-who-was-left-with-nothing-2217144.html "My role in Stieg Larsson's success, by partner who was left with nothing"], ''The Independent'', 17 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The memoir also details how the couple met and their struggles together at ''[[Expo (magazine)|Expo]]'', the anti-fascist publication Larsson founded in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Benedicte Page [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/14/stieg-larsson-partner-finish-millennium-novel "Stieg Larsson's partner plans to complete final Millennium novel"], ''The Guardian'', 14 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gabrielsson, Larsson had written 200 pages of a fourth novel in his internationally successful [[Millennium series|''Millennium'' series]] before he died; she has been seeking the legal authority to be in charge of what will happen to these 200 pages, as well as to exercise control over all Larsson's literary work, although so far Larsson's family has refused to give her such rights.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Sciolino [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/a-word-from-stieg-larssons-partner-and-would-be-collaborator/ "A Word From Stieg Larsson's Partner and Would-Be Collaborator"], ''New York Times'' (blog), 17 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; If granted the literary rights of the series, however, Gabrielsson explains that she is not sure that it is fair for a ghostwriter to complete the work that Larsson had started.&lt;ref&gt;Geoff Pevere [http://www.toronto.com/article/690733 "Life after Larsson"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928050828/http://www.toronto.com/article/690733 |date=September 28, 2011 }}, ''Toronto Star'', 27 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writer, activist and architect==
As a writer, in addition to working with Stieg Larsson on his literary projects, she is the coauthor of several books, including a monograph on the subject of cohabitation in Sweden, a Swedish government study on how to create more sustainable housing, and a forthcoming study on the Swedish urban planner Per Olof Hallman. She has also translated [[Philip K. Dick]]'s ''[[The Man in the High Castle]]'' into Swedish. As an activist, she works to end violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stiegandeva.com/author/ "About the author"], StiegandEva.com&lt;/ref&gt;

People who knew Stieg Larsson, such as his friend Kurdo Baksi and Anders Hellberg, a colleague of Larsson's in the 1970s and 1980s, were surprised that he wrote the Millennium novels. Hellberg went so far as to suspect that Larsson is not the sole author of the series, reasoning that Larsson was simply not a good enough writer. Gabrielsson has been named as the most likely candidate, due to her chosen wording during at least one interview that seemed to imply co-authorship, although she later claimed she had been misquoted.&lt;ref name="mcgrath"&gt;{{cite news| date = 23 May 2010| first =  Charles | last = McGrath| title = The Afterlife of Stieg Larsson| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/23/magazine/23Larsson-t.html?ref=general&amp;src=me&amp;pagewanted=all| newspaper = The New York Times Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 Gabrielsson expressed anger at such accusations and clarified "The actual writing, the craftsmanship, was Stieg's. But the content is a different matter. There are a lot of my thoughts, ideas and work in there." As an example she said he used her unfinished book about architect Per Olof Hallman to research locations for the Millennium series and that the two of them physically checked places together and discussed where the characters would live.&lt;ref name="Gabrielsson"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sequel announced to Stieg Larsson's Girl With the Dragon Tattoo trilogy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/04/stieg-larsson-partner-eva-gabrielsson|accessdate=29 November 2014|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her architectural practice is currently involved in housing and office construction and heading a European Union initiative to create sustainable architecture in the [[Dalecarlia]] region.

'''Flaccid dysarthria''' is a motor speech disorder resulting from damage to peripheral nervous system (cranial or spinal nerves) or [[lower motor neuron]] system.  Depending on which nerves are damaged, flaccid dysarthria affects respiration, phonation, resonance, and articulation. It also causes weakness,  [[hypotonia]] (low-muscle tone), and diminished reflexes.,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Duffy|first1=Joseph|title=Motor Speech Disorders: Substrates, Differential Diagnosis, and Management|date=June 6, 2013|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manasco, H. (2014). Introduction to neurogenic communication disorders. Burlington, MA: Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; Perceptual effects of flaccid dysarthria can include hypernasality, imprecise consonant productions, breathiness of voice, and affected nasal emission.&lt;ref&gt; University of Minnesota Duluth. (2014). Dysarthria. http://www.d.umn.edu/~mmizuko/2230/msd.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

[[File:GelPen stub.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of the tip of a gel pen]]
A '''gel pen''' uses ink in which [[pigment]] is [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] in a [[water]]-based [[gel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://pubs.acs.org/subscribe/archive/ci/31/i09/html/09lw.html |title=The Last Word: Just for the gel of it|date=September 2001|volume= 31|issue= 9|page= IBC|first=Debra A. |last=Schwartz|journal=Chemical Innovation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the ink is thick and [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]], it shows up more clearly on dark or slick surfaces than the typical inks used in [[ballpoint pen|ballpoint]] or [[marker pen|felt tip]] pens. Gel pens can be used for many types of writing and illustration.

The general design of a gel pen is similar to that of a regular [[ballpoint|ink based pen]], with a barrel containing the writing mechanism and a cap, and a reservoir filled with ink. The barrels can be created in many different sizes and designs; some have finger grips of rubber or plastic. The size of the [[nib (pen)|nib]] or pen tip ranges from {{Convert|0.18|mm|in}} to {{Convert|1.5|mm|in}}.

==Inks==
[[File:A bunch of gel pens.jpg|thumb|Gel pens]]

Compared to other inks, gel ink has higher [[viscosity]], which supports a higher proportion of pigments in the medium. The pigments are typically [[copper phthalocyanine]] and [[iron oxide]]s, and the gel is made up of water and [[biopolymer]]s, such as [[xanthan gum]] and [[tragacanth gum]], as well as some types of [[polyacrylate]] [[thickener]]s. The pigments are opaque, and gel pens are available in several bright and pastel colours, as well as [[opalescence|opalescent]], [[Metallic color|metallic]], and [[glitter]]y colours which show up clearly on dark paper. Many gel inks are water resistant, and are not washed away by water once the ink has dried. Fraud resistant gel ink is unaffected by solvents such as acetone, and resists check washing.

==Comparisons==

[[Ballpoint pen]]s use a paste ink based on a [[dye]] solute in an [[alcohol]] [[solvent]]. Compared to ballpoint pens, gel pens:

* Create a bolder, more opaque line{{cn|date=April 2017}}
* Smudge more, due to ink being more liquified{{cn|date=October 2015}}
* Use more ink, leading to more frequent refills or replacements{{cn|date=October 2015}}
* Are more likely to leak ink when the stopper fluid drains out{{cn|date=October 2015}}

[[Fountain pen]]s and liquid-ink [[rollerball pens]] use a dye solute in a water-based [[solvent]]. Compared to these pens, gel pens:

* Are less prone to bleed through to the other side of a piece of paper
* Create finer, more controlled lines
* Can create white or brightly coloured opaque lines on dark surfaces
* May be able to write on smooth materials

[[Paint marker]]s use an oil-based paint/ink that is very opaque and overlays all other colours beneath it. Compared to paint markers, gel pens:

* Are smaller, with finer tips
* Have no odour and do not require shaking to mix pigment with solvent

[[India ink]] (based on [[Soot|carbon black]] pigment) is perhaps the ink closest to gel ink in opacity, although it is usually made with an alcohol and [[shellac]]-based binder:

Another trait of gel ink is that it resists an analytical method commonly used to assess the potential age of ink for [[forensic chemistry|forensic purposes]]. The [[United States Secret Service]] has maintained the
International Ink Library for many decades. Because manufacturers change their ink formulas slightly from year to year, [[Thin-Layer Chromatography|thin-layer chromatography]] (TLC) can be used on ink from traditional pens to trace the manufacturer and date of manufacture of most inks. The pigments in gel ink do not dissolve, and therefore cannot be analyzed with TLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Gerald | last1 = LaPorte |date=May 2006 | title = An Evaluation of Matching Unknown Writing Inks with the United States International Ink Library | journal = Journal of Forensic Science | volume = 51 | issue = 3 | pages = 689–92 | doi = 10.1111/j.1556-4029.2006.00144.x | pmid = 16696723 | last2 = Arredondo | first2 = MD | last3 = McConnell | first3 = TS | last4 = Stephens | first4 = JC | last5 = Cantu | first5 = AA | last6 = Shaffer | first6 = DK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3222">{{unsolved|computer science|Can all [[regular language]]s be expressed using generalized regular expressions with a limited nesting depth of [[Kleene star]]s?}}
The '''generalized star-height problem''' in [[formal language theory]] is the open question whether all [[regular language]]s can be expressed using generalized regular expressions with a limited nesting depth of [[Kleene star]]s.  Here, generalized regular expressions are defined like [[Regular_expression#Formal_language_theory|regular expressions]], but they have a built-in complement operator. For a regular language, its [[Star height|generalized star height]] is defined as the minimum nesting depth of Kleene stars needed in order to describe the language by means of a generalized regular expression, hence the name of the problem. 

More specifically, it is an open question whether a nesting depth of more than 1 is required, and if so, whether there is an [[algorithm]] to determine the minimum required star height.&lt;ref name=Sak171&gt;Sakarovitch (2009) p.171&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Regular language]]s of star-height 0 are also known as [[star-free language]]s. The theorem of [[Marcel-Paul Schützenberger|Schützenberger]] provides an algebraic characterization of star-free languages by means of aperiodic [[syntactic monoid]]s. In particular star-free languages are a proper decidable subclass of regular languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6297">The '''Georgetown–IBM experiment''' was an influential demonstration of [[machine translation]], which was performed during January 7, 1954. Developed jointly by the [[Georgetown University]] and [[IBM]], the experiment involved completely automatic translation of more than sixty [[Russian language|Russian]] sentences into [[English language|English]].&lt;ref name="Nye"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nye|first1=Mary Jo|title=Speaking in Tongues: Science's centuries-long hunt for a common language|journal=Distillations|date=2016|volume=2|issue=1|pages=40–43|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/speaking-in-tongues|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Babel"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gordin|first1=Michael D.|title=Scientific Babel: How Science Was Done Before and After Global English|date=2015|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=9780226000299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{refimprove|section|date=January 2018}}
Conceived and performed primarily in order to attract governmental and public interest and funding by showing the possibilities of machine translation, it was by no means a fully featured system: It had only six grammar rules and 250 lexical items in its vocabulary (of stems and endings). This complete dictionary was never fully shown (only the extended one from Garvin's article). Apart from general topics, the system was specialised in the domain of [[organic chemistry]]. The translation was carried out using an [[IBM 701]] mainframe computer (launched in April 1953). Sentences had to be punched onto cards.

The Georgetown-IBM experiment is the best-known result of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] conference in June 1952 to which all active researchers in the machine translation field were invited. At the conference, [[Duncan Harkin]] from [[United States Department of Defense|US Department of Defense]] suggested that his department would finance a new machine translation project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The conference on mechanical translation.|last = Reynolds|first = A. Craig|date = 1954|journal = Mechanical Translation  |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=47–55|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jerome Weisner supported the idea and offered finance from the Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT. [[Leon Dostert]] had been invited to the project for his previous experience with the automatic correction of translations (back then 'mechanical translation'); his interpretation system had a strong impact on the [[Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal]]. The linguistics part of the demonstration was carried out for the most part by linguist [[Paul Garvin]] who had also good knowledge of [[Russian language|Russian]].

Over 60 [[Romanization of Russian|Romanized Russian]] statements from a wide range of political, legal, mathematical, and scientific topics were entered into the machine by a computer operator who knew no Russian, and the resulting English translations appeared on a printer.

The sentences to be translated were carefully selected. Many operations for the demonstration were fitted to specific words and sentences. In addition, there was no relational or sentence analysis which could recognize the sentence structure. The approach was mostly 'lexicographical' based on a dictionary where a specific word had a connection with specific rules and steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The solution of MT linguistic problems through lexicography.|last = Reifler|first = Erwin|date = February 2–5, 1960|journal = Proceedings of the National Symposium on Machine Translation|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Six rules ==
* Operation 0 – An exact equivalent for an translated item exists. Any further steps needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Georgetown–I.B.M. experiment, 124–135|last = Dostert|first = Leon E.|date = 1955|journal = Locke and Booth|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Operation 1 – Rearrangement of the position of the words. AB &gt; BA
* Operation 2 – The several choices problem. The result is based on the consecutive words (maximum of three).
* Operation 3 – Also several problems. But the result depends on the previous words (maximum of three).
* Operation 4 – Omissions of the lexical (morphological) item. The source item would be redundant.
* Operation 5 – Insertion of the lexical (morphological) item. The item is not present in the output language.

==Translation Examples==

|}

==Reception==
Well publicized by journalists and perceived as a success, the experiment did encourage governments to invest in [[computational linguistics]]. The authors claimed that within three or five years, machine translation could well be a solved problem. However, the real progress was much slower, and after the [[ALPAC]] report in 1966, which found that the ten years of long research had failed to fulfill the expectations, funding was reduced dramatically.

The demonstration was given widespread coverage in the foreign press, but only a small fraction of journalists drew attention to previous machine translation attempts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = From first conception to first demonstration: the nascent years of machine translation, 1947-1954.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2706">A '''government policy statement''' is a declaration of a government's [[politics|political]] activities, plans and intentions relating to a concrete cause or, at the assumption of office, an entire [[legislative session]]. In certain countries they are announced by the [[head of government]] or a [[minister (government)|minister]] of the [[parliament]]. In [[constitutional monarchies]] this function may be fulfilled by the [[Speech from the Throne]].

In [[Germany]] and [[Austria]] the [[Bundeskanzler (disambiguation)|Chancellor]] submits a government policy statement (''Regierungserklärung'') at the beginning of the session of the [[Bundestag]] (in Austria: [[National Council of Austria|Nationalrat]]), in which he announces the intended policies of the government during the next legislative session. The statement is not legally binding, but is a significant [[constitution]]al commitment for the parliament and the government. During the legislative period the federal government, through the Chancellor and the ministers, can give statements to the parliament through the chancellor or the ministers concerning current political themes. It cannot however be obliged to give such statements.

In [[Belgium]], the federal government holds its policy statement (''Beleidsverklaring'') on the second Wednesday in October; its northern region of [[Flanders]] states its [[September Declaration]] (''Septemberverklaring'') on the fourth Monday of September. In the [[Netherlands]], every third Tuesday in September is [[Prinsjesdag]]: the king holds the Speech from the throne (''Troonrede'') and the government will state its policy and budget plans in the [[Budget Memorandum (Netherlands)|Budget Memorandum]] (''Miljoenennota'') for the next year. When a new government coalition has been formed after elections, the Prime Minister will make a similar statement (''Regeringsverklaring'') for the four year legislative period it intends to run the country.

In [[Sweden]], the Prime Minister holds the government's statement (''Regeringsförklaring'') at the start of their government's legislative session and at the start of each parliamentary year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7184">{{Grammatical categories}} 
A '''grammatical category''' is a property of items within the [[grammar]] of a [[language]]; it has a number of possible values (sometimes called [[grammeme]]s), which are normally mutually exclusive within a given category.  Examples of frequently encountered grammatical categories include [[grammatical tense|tense]] (which may take values such as [[present tense|present]], [[past tense|past]], etc.), [[grammatical number|number]] (with values such as singular, [[plural]], and sometimes [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]], trial and paucal) and [[grammatical gender|gender]] (with values such as masculine, feminine and neuter).

Although terminology is not always consistent, a distinction should be made between these grammatical categories (tense, number, etc.) and [[lexical category|lexical categories]], which are closely synonymous with the traditional ''parts of speech'' (noun, verb, adjective, etc.), or more generally [[syntactic category|syntactic categories]]. Grammatical categories are also referred to as (grammatical) [[feature (linguistics)|feature]]s.

The name given to a grammatical category (as an [[uncountable noun]]) is generally also used (as a countable noun) to denote any of the possible values for that category. For example, the values available in a given language for the category "tense" are called "tenses", the values available for the category "gender" are called "genders", and so on.

A [[phonology|phonological]] manifestation of a category value (for example, a word ending that marks plurality on a noun) is sometimes called an [[exponent (linguistics)|exponent]].

==Assignment and meaning==
A given [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituent]] of an expression can normally take only one value from a particular category. For example, a noun or [[noun phrase]] cannot be both singular and plural, since these are both values of the category  of number. It can, however, be both plural and feminine, since these represent different categories (number and gender).

Categories may be described and named with regard to the type of [[semantics|meaning]]s that they are used to express. For example, the category of [[grammatical tense|tense]] is considered to serve to express time of occurrence (as in past, present or future). However, purely grammatical features do not always correspond simply or consistently to elements of meaning, and different authors may take significantly different approaches in their terminology and analysis. For example, the meanings associated with the categories of tense, [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] and [[grammatical mood|mood]] are often bound in up verb [[conjugation (grammar)|conjugation]] patterns that do not have separate grammatical elements corresponding to each of the three categories; see [[Tense–aspect–mood]].

==Manifestation of categories==
Categories may be marked on [[word]]s by means of [[inflection]]. In [[English grammar|English]], for example, the number of a [[noun]] is usually marked by leaving the noun uninflected if it is singular, and by adding the suffix ''-s'' if it is plural (although some nouns have [[English plural|irregular plural forms]]). On other occasions, a category may not be marked overtly on the item to which it pertains, being manifested only through other grammatical features of the sentence, often by way of grammatical [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]].

For example:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;The bird can sing.
The bird'''s''' can sing.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the above sentences, the number of the noun is marked by the absence or presence of the ending ''-s''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;The sheep '''is''' running.
The sheep '''are''' running.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the above, the number of the noun is not marked on the noun itself (''sheep'' does not inflect according to the regular pattern), but it is reflected in agreement between the noun and verb: singular number triggers ''is'', and plural number ''are''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;The bird '''is''' singing.
The bird'''s''' '''are''' singing.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In this case the number is marked overtly on the noun, and is also reflected by verb agreement.

However:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The sheep can run.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In this case the number of the noun (or of the verb) is not manifested at all in the [[surface form]] of the sentence, and thus ambiguity is introduced (at least, when the sentence is viewed in isolation).

Exponents of grammatical categories often appear in the same position or "slot" in the word (such as [[prefix]], [[suffix]] or [[enclitic]]). An example of this is the [[Latin declension|Latin cases]], which are all suffixal: ''ros'''a''', ros'''ae''', ros'''ae''', ros'''am''', ros'''ā''''' ("rose", in the [[nominative]], [[genitive]], [[dative]], [[accusative]] and [[ablative]]).

Categories can also pertain to sentence constituents that are larger than a single word ([[phrase (grammar)|phrase]]s, or sometimes [[clause (grammar)|clause]]s). A phrase often inherits category values from its [[head (linguistics)|head]] word; for example, in the above sentences, the [[noun phrase]] ''the birds'' inherits plural number from the noun ''birds''. In other cases such values are associated with the way in which the phrase is constructed; for example, in the [[coordination (linguistics)|coordinated]] noun phrase ''Tom and Mary'', the phrase has plural number (it would take a plural verb), even though both the nouns from which it is built up are singular.

== Theory ==

In traditional structural grammar, grammatical categories are semantic distinctions; this is reflected in a morphological or syntactic paradigm. But in [[generative grammar]], which sees meaning as separate from grammar, they are categories that define the distribution of syntactic elements.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joan Bybee]] "Irrealis" as a Grammatical Category. Anthropological Linguistics , Vol. 40, No. 2 (Summer, 1998), pp. 257-271&lt;/ref&gt; For structuralists such as [[Roman Jakobson]] grammatical categories were lexemes that were based on binary oppositions of "a single feature of meaning that is equally present in all contexts of use". Another way to define a grammatical category is as a category that expresses meanings from a single conceptual domain,  contrasts with other such categories, and is expressed through formally similar expressions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOflinguisticTerms/WhatIsAGrammaticalCategory.htm What is a grammatical category?] - SIL.org&lt;/ref&gt; Another definition distinguishes grammatical categories from lexical categories, such that the elements in a grammatical category have a common grammatical meaning – that is, they are part of the language's grammatical structure.&lt;ref&gt;"grammatical category"  The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Linguistics. P. H. Matthews. Oxford University Press, 2007. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press.  Brown University.  31 March 2012  &lt;http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t36.e1391&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Halmidi OldKannada inscription.JPG|right|thumb|180px|A replica of the original Halmidi inscription at [[Halmidi]] village]]

The '''Halmidi inscription''' is the oldest known [[Kannada language]] inscription in the [[Kannada script]]. While estimates vary slightly, the inscription is often dated to between 450 CE - 500 CE. The inscription was discovered in 1936 by Dr. [[M. H. Krishna]], the Director of Archaeology of the (princely) State of Mysore (present-day [[Karnataka]] region of India), in [[Halmidi]], a village in the [[Hassan,_Karnataka|Hassan district]].

The original inscription is kept in the Office of the Director of Archaeology and Museums, Govt. of Karnataka, Mysore,&lt;ref name="Gai 1992 297"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gai|1992|p=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[fibreglass]] replica has been installed in Halmidi.

==Discovery and dating ==

In a report published in a Mysore Archaeological Department Report (MAR) in 1936, Krishna dated the inscription to 450 AD, on paleographical grounds.&lt;ref name="Gai 1992 297"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|M. A. R.| 1936|pp=72–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later scholars have variously dated the inscription to 450 AD,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramesh|1984b|pp=55&amp;ndash;58}}&lt;/ref&gt; 470 AD,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Master|1944|pp=297–307}}&lt;/ref&gt; 500 AD,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mugali|1975|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; "about 500",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pollock|2006|pp=331–332}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "end of the fifth century A. D. or the beginning of the 6th century A.D."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gai|1992|pp=300–301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epigraphist, [[D. C. Sircar]] has dated the inscription to "about the end of the 6th century."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sircar|1965|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epigraphist, K. V. Ramesh has written about the differing estimates:
{{Quotation|And I attribute the origin of this doubt in their minds to the fact that scholars, even the reputed ones, have held differing views, mostly to prop up their preconceived notions, on the palaeographical dating of any given undated or insufficiently dated inscriptions. ... The undated Halmidi (Hassan District, Karnataka) inscription, allegedly written during the reign of Kadamba Kakusthavarman, is taken by some scholars to belong, on palaeographical grounds, to the middle of the 5th century AD, while a few other scholars have held, on the same grounds of palaeography, that it is as late as the second half of the 6th century A.D.|K. V. Ramesh&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramesh|1984b|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
He also hypothesized that, compared to possibly contemporaneous Sanksrit inscriptions,  "Halmidi inscription has letters which are unsettled and uncultivated, no doubt giving an impression, or rather an illusion, even to the trained eye, that it is, in date, later than the period to which it really belongs, namely the fifth century A.D."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramesh|1984b|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epigraphist [[G. S. Gai]] however disagrees with the view that Halmidi is a record of the Kadamba dynasty identified with King Kadamba Kakusthavarman.  According to {{Harv|Gai|1992}}, the inscription, which is dedicated to, "Kadambapan Kakustha-Bhaṭṭōran," refers to another ruler, Kakustha of the Bhaṭāri family, who is explicitly identified in line 13, "baṭāri-kuladōn=āḷu-kadamban;" in addition, the inscription does not "include any of the epithets like ''Mānavya-gōtra'', ''Hāritī-putra'', and most important ''Dharma-maharājā''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gai|1996|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; that are a part of all Kadamba inscriptions.

== Textual analysis ==

[[File:Halmidi oldKannada inscription mounted.JPG|right|thumb|150px|The replica of the Halmidi inscription mounted on a pedestal]]

The inscription is in [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] form indicating the authors of the inscription had a good sense of the language structure.&lt;ref name="verse"&gt;{{Harvnb|Datta|1988|p=1474}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription is written in pre-old Kannada (''Puruvada-hala Kannada''), which later evolved into old Kannada, middle Kannada and eventually modern Kannada.&lt;ref&gt;[[M. Chidananda Murthy]], ''Inscriptions (Kannada)'' in {{Harvnb|Datta|1988|p=1717}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Halmidi inscription is the earliest evidence of the usage of Kannada as an administrative language.&lt;ref name="admin"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1717&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="87309">The '''history of advertising''' can be traced to ancient civilizations. It became a major force in [[capitalist]] economies in the mid-19th century, based primarily on [[newspaper]]s and magazines. In the 20th century, [[advertising]] grew rapidly with new technologies such as [[direct mail]], [[radio]], [[television]], the internet and mobile devices.

[[File:Advertising as a percent of Gross Domestice Product in the United States.svg|thumb|Advertising as a percent of Gross Domestic Product in the United States, 1919 to 2007 per Douglas Galbi.]]

Between 1919 and 2007 advertising averaged 2.2 percent of [[Gross Domestic Product]] in the United States.

==Pre-modern history==

[[File:Bronze printing plate for an advertisement.jpg|thumb|Bronze plate for printing an advertisement for the Liu family needle shop at [[Jinan]], [[Song dynasty]] China. It is considered the world's earliest identified printed advertising medium.]]
Egyptians used [[papyrus]] to make sales messages and wall posters. [[Advertising campaign|Commercial messages]] and political campaign displays have been found in the ruins of [[Pompeii]] and  [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]]. [[Lost and found]] advertising on papyrus was common in [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]]. Wall or rock painting for commercial advertising is another manifestation of an ancient advertising form, which is present to this day in many parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. The tradition of wall painting can be traced back to Indian [[rock art]] paintings that date back to 4000 BC.&lt;ref name= Bhatia&gt;Bhatia (2000). ''Advertising in Rural India: Language, Marketing Communication, and Consumerism'', 62+68&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient China, the earliest advertising known was oral, as recorded in the [[Classic of Poetry]] (11th to 7th centuries BC) of bamboo flutes played to sell candy. Advertisement usually takes in the form of calligraphic signboards and inked papers. A copper printing plate dated back to the [[Song dynasty]] used to print posters in the form of a square sheet of paper with a rabbit logo with "[[Jinan]] Liu's Fine Needle Shop" and "We buy high quality steel rods and make fine quality needles, to be ready for use at home in no time" written above and below.&lt;ref&gt;Eckhardt, G. and Bengtsson, A., "Pulling the White Rabbit Out of the Hat: Consuming Brands in Imperial China," ''Advances in Consumer Research,'' [European Conference Proceedings] Vol. 8, 2008; Eckhardt, G. and Bengtsson, A., "A Brief History of Branding in China," ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 30, No. 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; is considered the world's earliest identified printed advertising medium.&lt;ref&gt;Hong Liu, ''Chinese Business: Landscapes and Strategies'' (2013), p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edo period advertising in Japan.jpg|thumb|[[Edo period]] LEL flyer from 1806 for a traditional medicine called ''Kinseitan'']]

In Europe, as the towns and cities of the [[Middle Ages]] began to grow, and the general populace was unable to read, instead of signs that read "cobbler", "miller", "tailor", or "blacksmith" would use an image associated with their trade such as a boot, a suit, a hat, a clock, a diamond, a horse shoe, a candle or even a bag of flour. Fruits and vegetables were sold in the city square from the backs of carts and wagons and their proprietors used street callers ([[town crier]]s) to announce their whereabouts for the convenience of the customers. The first compilation of such advertisements was gathered in ''Les Crieries de Paris'' ([[Street cries]] of Paris), a thirteenth-century poem by Guillaume de la Villeneuve.&lt;ref&gt;Aimeé Boutin, "Sound Memory: Paris Street Cries in Balzac's Pere Goriot," ''French Forum,'' Volume 30, Number 2, Spring 2005, pp. 67–78, DOI:10.1353/frf.2005.0029&lt;/ref&gt; 

Three major forms of advertisement existed during the pre-printing period (before the 15th-century); those forms were trademarks (moon, stars etc.), town criers and [[signage|sign boards]]:

* '''Trademarks''': The practice of attaching seals or marks to products was widespread in antiquity. Around 4,000 years ago, producers began by attaching simple stone seals to products which, over time, were transformed into clay seals bearing impressed images, often associated with the producer's personal identity.&lt;ref&gt;Wengrow, D., "Prehistories of Commodity Branding," ''Current Anthropology,''Vol. 49, No. 1, 2008, pp. 7-34&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the earliest use of maker's marks, dating to about 1,300 BCE, have been found in India.&lt;ref&gt;Khan, M. and Mufti, S.U., ''The Hot History &amp; Cold Future of Brands'', ''Journal of Managerial Sciences'', vol. 1, no. 1, 2007, pp 75–87, http://qurtuba.edu.pk/jms/default_files/JMS/1_1/5_saif_ullah.pdf Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; By the medieval period, [[hallmark]]s were applied to high value goods such as precious metals, and assayers were appointed by governments to administer the system and ensure product quality.&lt;ref&gt;Dodd, E.C., ''Byzantine Silver Stamps'', [Dumbarton Oaks Studies] Vol. 7, Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection, 1961, pp 23–35&lt;/ref&gt; 

* '''Town criers''': In ancient towns and cities, where the majority of citizens were illiterate, town-criers were appointed to call out official announcements and general news. Before long, private individuals began to employ public criers to act as an auctioneer.&lt;ref&gt;Sampson, S., ''A History of Advertising from the Earliest Times'', Chatto and, Windus, 1875, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, itinerant [[Hawker (trade)|hawkers]] developed a system of [[street cries]] to promote their goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, V., "The Streets for the People: London's Street Markets 1850–1939, ''Urban History'', June, 2015, pp. 1–21,&lt;/ref&gt; These street cries provided an essential public service before the advent of mass media.&lt;ref&gt;Garrioch, D., "Sounds of the City: the soundscape of early modern European towns," ''Urban History,'' 2003, Vol. 30, no. 1, pp 5&amp;ndash;25, [http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0963926803001019 abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Saracens Head pub sign.jpg|thumb|left|Saracens Head pub sign, Bath, England]]
*'''Sign-boards''':  The use of commercial signage has a very ancient history. Retail signage and promotional signs appear to have developed independently in the East and the West. In antiquity, the ancient Egyptians, Romans and Greeks were known to use signage for shop fronts as well as to announce public events such as market days.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, F.K.,  "The Ancient History of Advertising: Insights and Implications for Practitioners: What Today's Advertisers and Marketers Can Learn from Their Predecessors," ''Journal of Advertising Research,'' vol. 57 no. 3, pp 239-244 DOI: 10.2501/JAR-2017-033&lt;/ref&gt; China also exhibited a rich history of early retail signage systems.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, K. and Reid., S., "The Birth of the Brand: 4000 years of Branding," ''Business History,'' Vol. 50, 2008. pp. 419–32.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Medieval Britain and France and much of Europe, innkeepers were compelled to erect a sign-board&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manton|first=Dafydd|title=Ale and Arty in Sheffield: The Disappearing Art of Pub Signs|year=2008|publisher=Arc Publishing and Print|location=Sheffield, England|isbn=978-1906722005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roth.

==16th-18th centuries==

Modern advertising began to take shape with the advent of newspapers and magazines in the 16th and 17th centuries. The very first weekly [[gazette]]s appeared in Venice in the early 16th-century. From there, the concept of a weekly publication spread to Italy, Germany and Holland.&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre, J., "The 'Avvisi' of Venice: Toward an Archaeology of Media Forms." ''Journalism History'' 14#2, 1987, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, the first weeklies appeared in the 1620s, and its first daily newspaper was the ''[[The Daily Courant]]'' published from 1702 to 1735.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, B., ''From Grub Street to Fleet Street: An Illustrated History of English Newspapers to 1899'' (Ashgate, 2004; Hunt, M., "Hawkers, Bawlers, and Mercuries: Women and the London Press in the Early Enlightenment", ''Women &amp; History'', Vol. 3, no. 9, 1984 pp 41-68; Maxted, U., 'Mallet, Elizabeth (fl. 1672–1706)', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford University Press, 2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/66880, accessed 27 May 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Almost from the outset, newspapers carried advertising to defray the cost of printing and distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Barrès-Baker, M.C., ''An Introduction to the Early History of Newspaper Advertising'', [Brent Museum and Archive Occasional Publications, No. 2], Brent Heritage Services,   2006, &lt;/ref&gt; The earliest commercial advertisements were for books and quack medicines, but by the 1650s, the variety of products being advertised had increased markedly.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, E.E., ''The Shocking History of Advertising'', New York, Ballantine Books, 1980, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in printing allowed retailers and manufacturers to print [[Flyer (pamphlet)|handbills]] and [[trade card]]s. For example, Jonathon Holder, a London haberdasher in the 1670s, gave every customer a printed list of his stock with the prices affixed. At the time, Holder's innovation was seen as a "dangerous practice" and an unnecessary expense for retailers.&lt;ref&gt;Sampson, S., ''A History of Advertising from the Earliest Times'', Chatto and, Windus, 1875, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest trade cards were not cards at all, instead they were printed on paper and did not include illustrations. By the 18th century, however, they were printed on the more substantial card and typically bore the tradesmen's name and address, and before street numbering was in common use, often included a long-winded set of directions on how to locate the store or premises. With the advent of commercial engraving and lithography, illustrations became a standard feature of even the most humble trade card. Eventually trade cards evolved into business cards, which are still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;"Trade Cards," in ''The Encyclopedia of Ephemera: A Guide to the Fragmentary Documents of Everyday Life for the Collector, Curator, and Historian,'' Maurice Rickards (ed), Psychology Press, 2000, pp 334-335, pp 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th century==
In June 1836, [[Émile de Girardin]] editor of the Paris newspaper ''[[La Presse (France)|La Presse]]'' was the first to rely on paid advertising to lower its price, extend its readership and increase its profitability. His formula was soon copied by all titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Clyde Thogmartin|title=The National Daily Press of France|year=1998|isbn=978-1-883479-20-6|pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early print advertisements were used mainly to promote books and newspapers, which became increasingly affordable with advances in the [[printing press]]; and medicines, which were increasingly sought after as modern people rejected traditional cures. However, [[false advertising]] and "[[Quackery]]" became common. British newspapers in the 1850s and 1860s appealed to the increasingly affluent middle-class that sought out a variety of new products. The advertisements announced new health remedies as well as fresh foods and beverages. The latest London fashions were featured in the regional press. The availability of repeated advertising permitted manufacturers to develop nationally known brand names that had a much stronger appeal than generic products.&lt;ref&gt;Beverley Ann Tudor, "Retail Trade Advertising in the 'Leicester Journal' and the 'Leicester Chronicle' 1855-71." ''European Journal of Marketing'' 20#9 (1986) pp: 41-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

A leadership position in British advertising was held by [[Cope Bros &amp; Co]] tobacco company, founded in Liverpool in 1848 by Thomas and George Cope. Smoking, of course, had been common for centuries, but the innovations consisted in brand names, heavy advertising, and market segmentation according to class. An innovative appeal was to health consciousness; the ads directed at the middle-class men promised that  "smoke not only checks disease but preserves the lungs."   A rugged heavy taste was pitched to working men, soldiers and sailors,  while "delicately fragrant" was part of the appeal to the upper-class. The packaging was attractive, posters were omnipresent to show that smoking was a normal part of English life;  lobbying was used to undercut the anti-tobacco lobby.&lt;ref&gt;A. V. Seaton,"Cope's and the Promotion of Tobacco in Victorian England." ''European Journal of Marketing''  (1986) 20#9 pp: 5-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advertising agencies===

====Great Britain====
{{main article|History of advertising in Britain}}
[[Image:Parrywatercolour.jpg|right|thumb|390px|In Britain, outdoor advertising was based on hoardngs (billboards): England 1835, by [[John Orlando Parry]]]]
In London [[Thomas J. Barratt]] was hailed as "the father of modern advertising".&lt;ref&gt;He was first described as such in T F G Coates, 'Mr Thomas J Barratt, "The father of modern advertising"', Modern Business, September 1908, pp. 107–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "mat"&gt;Matt Haig, ''Brand failures: the truth about the 100 biggest branding mistakes of all time'', Kogan Page Publishers, 2005, pp. 219, 266.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "nick"&gt;Nicholas Mirzoeff, ''The visual culture reader'', Routledge, 2002, p. 510.&lt;/ref&gt; Working for the [[Pears Soap]] company, Barratt created an effective advertising campaign for the company products, which involved the use of targeted slogans, images and phrases. One of his slogans, "Good morning. Have you used Pears' soap?" was famous in its day and into the 20th century.&lt;ref name = "obit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1914/04/27/100310554.pdf |title=Obituary, Thomas J. Barratt Dead: Chairman of the Firm of A. &amp; F. Pears an Advertising Genius|work=New York Times| page= 11 |publisher=New York Times |date=1914-04-27 |accessdate=2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "part"&gt;Eric Partridge, Paul Beale, ''A Dictionary of Catch Phrases: British and American, from the Sixteenth Century to the Present Day'', Routledge, 1986, p.164.&lt;/ref&gt;

An advertising tactic that he used was to associate the Pears brand with high culture and quality. Most famously, he used the painting ''[[Bubbles (painting)|Bubbles]]'' by [[John Everett Millais]] as an advertisement by adding a bar of Pears soap into the foreground. Barratt continued this theme with a series of adverts of well groomed middle-class children, associating Pears with domestic comfort and aspirations of high society.

[[File:Pears Soap 1900.jpg|right|thumb|A 1900 British ad for soap]]

Barratt introduced many of the crucial ideas that lie behind successful advertising and these were widely circulated in his day. He constantly stressed the importance of a strong and exclusive brand image for Pears and of emphasizing the product's availability through saturation campaigns. He also understood the importance of constantly reevaluating the market for changing tastes and mores, stating in 1907 that "tastes change, fashions change, and the advertiser has to change with them. An idea that was effective a generation ago would fall flat, stale, and unprofitable if presented to the public today. Not that the idea of today is always better than the older idea, but it is different – it hits the present taste."&lt;ref name = "mat"/&gt;

====United States====
In the United States around 1840, Volney B. Palmer set up the first [[advertising agency]] in [[Philadelphia]]. In 1842 Palmer bought large amounts of space in various newspapers at a discounted rate then resold the space at higher rates to advertisers. The actual ad – the copy, layout, and artwork – was still prepared by the company wishing to advertise; in effect, Palmer was a space broker. The situation changed in the late 19th century when the advertising agency of [[N.W. Ayer &amp; Son]] was founded in New York. It planned, created, and executed complete advertising campaigns for its customers. It created a number of memorable slogans for firms such as [[De Beers]], [[AT&amp;T]] and the [[U.S. Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Hower, ''The History of an Advertising Agency: N. W. Ayer &amp; Son 1869-1949'' (1949) p 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:J. Walter Thompson Advertisement 1903.JPG|thumb|left|275px|J. Walter Thompson Co. promotes high-powered advertisement, 1903]]

By 1900 the advertising agency had become the focal point of creative planning, and advertising was firmly established as a profession.
&lt;ref name="eskilson-pg58"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Graphic Design: A New History |last=Eskilson |first=Stephen J. |year=2007 |publisher=Yale University Press |page=58 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, agencies were brokers for advertisement space in newspapers.  [[N. W. Ayer &amp; Son]] was the first full-service agency to assume responsibility for advertising content. N.W. Ayer opened in 1869, and was located in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="eskilson-pg58"/&gt;

The amount of space available in newspapers grew rapidly. The ''Boston Transcript'' published in 19,000 "agate lines" Of advertising in 1860,  87,000 in 1900, and 237,000 in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Starch, ''Advertising Principles'' (1927)  p 485&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, 104 companies spent over $50,000 each on national advertising; most sold patent medicines, which faded away after the federal food and drug legislation of the early 20th century. Seven innovators had emerged in the big time: [[Quaker Oats]], Armour meat, Cudahy meat, American Tobacco Company, P. Lorillard tobacco, Remington Typewriters, and [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] soap.  By 1914, two thirds of the top advertisers came from just five industries: 14 food producers, 13 in automobiles and tires,  nine in soap and cosmetics, and four in tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Pope, ''The making of modern advertising'' (1983) pp 42-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Agencies were forever breaking up and reforming, especially when one executive would split taking with him a major client and his team of [[copywriter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hower, ''The History of an Advertising Agency '' (1949) pp 58-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
In the late 19th century in France, [[Charles-Louis Havas]] extended the services of his news agency, [[Havas]] to include advertisement brokerage, making it the first French group to organize.

== Since 1900:  Global==
Advertising in the developing world was dominated by agencies in the imperial powers, especially from London and Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Ciochetto, ''Globalisation and Advertising in Emerging Economies: Brazil, Russia, India and China'' (2013) p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;  [[J. Walter Thompson]] became the first American agency to expand internationally with the opening of J. Walter Thompson London in 1899.  It expanded across the globe, becoming one of the first American agencies in Egypt, South Africa and Asia.  Much of the pressure to expand came from General Motors, which wanted to export its automobiles worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Dawn Spring,  "The Globalization of American Advertising and Brand Management: A Brief History of the J. Walter Thompson Company, Proctor and Gamble, and US Foreign Policy." ''Global Studies Journal'' (2013). 5#4&lt;/ref&gt;  Ford turned to N.W. Ayer, which began its expansion in Europe and Latin America in the 1930s.  The typical policy was to put an American manager in charge, and hire a staff drawn from locals who had a better understanding of the language and the culture.  In 1941-42, however, Ayer closed its foreign offices and decided to concentrate on the American market.&lt;ref&gt;Hower, 'The History of an advertising agency: N.W. Ayer &amp; Son at work, 1869-1949." (1949) pp 140-46, 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, spending on advertising reached $143 billion in the United States and $467 billion worldwide.&lt;ref name="WPP Group Forecasts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpp.com/wpp/press/2011/dec/05/groupm-forecasts-global-ad-spending-to/ |title=GroupM forecasts 2012 global ad spending to increase 6.4% |publisher=WPP |date=2011-12-05 |accessdate=2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, internationally, the largest ("big four") advertising conglomerates are [[Interpublic]], [[Omnicom]], [[Publicis]], and [[WPP Group|WPP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Parekh |first=Rupal |url=http://adage.com/article/agency-news/big-holding-firms-adland-anymore-big/236001/ |title=Not the 'Big Four' Holding Firms in Adland Anymore – Now It's the Big Five &amp;#124; Agency News – Advertising Age |publisher=Adage.com |date=July 12, 2012 |accessdate=January 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Since 1900: United States and Canada==

Advertising increased dramatically in the United States after 1870 as industrialization expanded the supply of manufactured products to a very large market. In order to profit from this higher rate of production, industry needed to recruit workers as consumers of factory products. It did so through the invention of mass marketing designed to influence the population's economic behavior on a larger scale.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen, ''Captains of Consciousness'' (1976), p. 33. "As Ford's massive assembly line utilized 'extensive single-purpose machinery' to produce automobiles inexpensively and at a rate that dwarfed traditional methods, the costly machinery of advertising that Coolidge had described set out to produce consumers, likewise inexpensively and at a rate that dwarfed traditional methods."&lt;/ref&gt; Total advertising volume in the United States grew from about $200 million in 1880 to nearly $3 billion in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Pope|title=The making of modern advertising|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bElPAAAAMAAJ|year=1983|publisher=Basic Books|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1910s and 1920s, many ad men believed that human instincts could be targeted and harnessed – "[[sublimation (psychology)|sublimated]]" into the desire to purchase commodities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stuart Ewen|title=Captains Of Consciousness: Advertising and the Social Roots of the Consumer Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v1R5S1DSC9kC&amp;pg=PA34|year=2008|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Bernays]], a nephew of [[Sigmund Freud]], promoted the approach making him [[Tobacco advertising|a pioneer of modern cigarette advertising.]]  Glantz argues, "it was really the tobacco industry, from the beginning, that was at the forefront of the development of modern, innovative, advertising techniques."&lt;ref name="GlantzModernAds"&gt;Stanton Glantz in ''[[Mad Men]] Season 3 Extra – Clearing the Air – The History of Cigarette Advertising'', part 1, min 3:38&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, under [[Secretary of Commerce]] [[Herbert Hoover]], the American government promoted advertising. Hoover himself delivered an address to the Associated Advertising Clubs of the World in 1925 called 'Advertising Is a Vital Force in Our National Life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leach|first=William|title=Land of Desire|year=1993|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|pages=375|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHZ6UAudSiUC&amp;pg=375}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1929, the head of the U.S. [[Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce]], Julius Klein, stated "Advertising is the key to world prosperity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leach|first=William|title=Land of Desire|year=1993|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|pages=367|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHZ6UAudSiUC&amp;pg=367}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was part of the "unparalleled" collaboration between business and government in the 1920s, according to a 1933 European economic journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leach|first=William|title=Land of Desire|year=1993|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|pages=373|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHZ6UAudSiUC&amp;pg=373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising was a vehicle for [[cultural assimilation]], encouraging immigrants to exchange their traditional habits and tastes in favor of a modern American lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Ewen|title=Captains Of Consciousness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v1R5S1DSC9kC&amp;pg=PA56|year=2008|pages=56–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important tool for influencing immigrant workers was the [[American Association of Foreign Language Newspapers]] (AAFLN). The AAFLN was primarily an advertising agency but also gained heavily centralized control over much of the immigrant press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeanne D. Petit|title=The Men and Women We Want: Gender, Race, and the Progressive Era Literacy Test Debate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sTubHqECr84C&amp;pg=PA66|year=2010|publisher=U of Rochester Press|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canadian media market===
In 1900, most Canadian newspapers were local affairs, designed primarily to inform local partisans about the provincial and national political scene. The publishers depended on loyal partisan subscribers, as well as  contracts for public printing  controlled by the political parties. With the rise of national advertising agencies after 1900, a major transformation was underway. The advertisers wanted them to reach the maximum possible circulation, regardless of partisanship. The result was a series of consolidations yielding much larger, largely nonpartisan newspapers, which depended more heavily on advertising revenue than on subscriptions from loyal party members. By 1900, three-fourths of the revenue of Toronto newspapers came from advertising. About two thirds of the newspapers' editorial pages loyally supported either the Conservative or the Liberal party, while the remainder were more independent. Across the board, the news pages increasingly featured more objectivity and bipartisanship, and the publishers were mostly focused on advertising revenues that were proportionate to overall circulation. A newspaper that appealed only to one party cut its potential audience in half. Simultaneously, the rapid growth of industry in Ontario and Quebec, coupled with the rapid settlement of the prairies, produced a large more affluent newspaper-reading population. The result was a golden age for Canadian newspapers peaking about 1911.  Many papers failed during the war era. Advertising agencies in 1915 gained a major advantage with the arrival of the [[Audit Bureau of Circulations]], which for the first-time provided reliable data on circulation, as opposed to the partisan boasting and exaggeration that had been the norm. the agencies now had a stronger hand in bargaining for lower advertising rates. The 1920s became a time of consolidation, budget-cutting and dropping of traditional party affiliation. By 1930 only 24% of Canada's dailies were partisan, 17% were "independent" partisan, and the majority, 50%, had become fully independent.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Johnston, "Partisan Politics, Market Research, and Media Buying in Canada, 1920," '' Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly'' (2006) 83#4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex and psychology===
{{main article|Sex in advertising}}
[[File:1916-skin-touch-soap-ad.jpg|thumb|300px|1916 ''Ladies' Home Journal'' version of the famous ad]]

At the turn of the 20th century, there were few career choices for women in business; however, advertising was one of the few. Since women were responsible for most of the purchasing done in their household, advertisers and agencies recognized the value of women's insight during the creative process. [[Helen Lansdowne Resor]]  at J. Walter Thompson Agency, was one of the pioneers.

In 1911, the [[Woodbury Soap Company]] became the first to use images of sexual contact to sell a product. Their ad slogan, created by Helen Lansdowne, claimed that women who used the soap would have "Skin You Love To Touch". Her copy promised the soap would increase the beauty of one's skin; it offered a color print and a week's supply of the soap for 10 cents. The slogan became so popular that Woodbury used it until the 1940s. Albert Lasker said the ad's use of sex appeal made it one of three great landmarks in advertising history. It was ranked 31st on ''Advertising Age's'' list of the top 100 campaigns of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://adage.com/article/adage-encyclopedia/resor-helen-lansdowne-1886-1964/98850/ "Resor, Helen Lansdowne (1886-1964)" in ''Advertising Age'' Sept 15, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nudity===
In 1936, Woodbury was one of the first companies to use nudity in its advertisements. The ad, known as "The Sun Bath", was photographed by [[Edward Steichen]] and showed a nude woman lying on stairs on her side with her back to the camera. The text advertised that Woodbury Soap was now enriched with "filter sunshine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sherrow|first=Victoria |title=For Appearance' Sake: The Historical Encyclopedia of Good Looks, Beauty, and Grooming|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=1-573-56204-1|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many celebrities appeared in advertisements for Woodbury Soap.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger Streitmatter, ''Sex sells!: The media's journey from repression to obsession'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

In international perspective, a 2008 comparison of nudity in advertising in Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, South Korea, Thailand, and the United States reveals that China and the United States have the most demure ads, while Germany and Thailand exposed more of the female body. There is little variation in male undress.&lt;ref&gt;Michelle R. Nelson and Hye-Jin Paek, "Nudity of female and male models in primetime TV advertising across seven countries," ''International Journal of Advertising'' (2008) 27#5 pp 715-744&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychology===
In the early 20th century, psychologists Walter D. Scott and [[John B. Watson]] contributed applied psychological theory to the field of advertising. Scott said, "Man has been called the reasoning animal but he could with greater truthfulness be called the creature of suggestion. He is reasonable, but he is to a greater extent suggestible".&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, L.T., &amp; Baker, D.B. 2004. Industrial-organizational psychology: The new psychology and the business of advertising. ''From Séance to Science: A History of the Profession of Psychology in America''. 118-121. California: Wadsworth/Thomson Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; He demonstrated this through his advertising technique of a direct command to the consumer. The former chair at [[Johns Hopkins University]], John B. Watson was a highly recognized psychologist in the 1920s. After leaving the field of academia he turned his attention towards advertising where he implemented the concepts of [[behaviorism]] into advertising. This focused on appealing to the basic emotions of the consumer: love, hate, and fear. This type of advertising proved to be extremely effective as it suited the changing social context which led to heavy influence of future advertising strategy and cemented the place of psychology in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;T. Jackson Lears,  "From salvation to self-realization: Advertising and the therapeutic roots of the consumer culture, 1880-1930."

''Journal of Advertising'' 19#2 (1990): 49-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albert Lasker:  Salesmanship in print===
{{main article|Albert Lasker}}
Chicago, along with New York, was the center of the nation's advertising industry. Albert Lasker, known as the "father of modern advertising," made Chicago his base 1898–1942. As head of the [[Draftfcb|Lord and Thomas agency]], Lasker devised a copywriting technique that appealed directly to the psychology of the consumer. Women seldom smoked cigarettes; he told them if they smoked [[Lucky Strikes]] they could stay slender. Lasker's use of radio, particularly with his campaigns for [[Palmolive (soap)|Palmolive]] soap, [[Pepsodent]] toothpaste, [[Kotex]] products, and Lucky Strike cigarettes, not only revolutionized the advertising industry but also significantly changed popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur W. Schultz, "Albert Lasker's Advertising Revolution," ''Chicago History,'' Nov 2002, Vol. 31#2 pp. 36–53&lt;/ref&gt;

Lasker had an inquiring mind about what advertising was and how it worked. Lasker believed that advertising consisted of news and information was news, He changed his mind when a colleague Johnny Kennedy told him, "News is a technique of presentation, but advertising is a very simple thing. I can give it to you in three words, it is 'salesmanship in print'".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey L. Cruikshank &amp; Arthur W. Schultz, ''The Man Who Sold America,'' pp. 54–56&lt;/ref&gt;  Lasker and Kennedy used this concept with [[Whirlpool Corporation|the 1900 Washer Co.]] (later Whirlpool). Their campaign was so successful that, within four months of running the first ad, they attracted additional clients and their "advertising spend" went from $15,000 a year to $30,000 a month. Within six months, their firm was one of the three or four largest advertisers in the nation.

In 1908 Lasker recruited [[Claude C. Hopkins]] to the firm, specifically to work on the Van Camp Packaging Company ([[Van Camp's]]) account. The relationship lasted for 17 years. Lasker helped create America's infatuation with orange juice. Lord &amp; Thomas acquired the [[Sunkist Growers, Incorporated]] account in 1908, when the citrus industry was in a slump. Lasker created campaigns that not only encouraged consumers to eat oranges, but also to drink orange juice.&lt;ref&gt;John Gunther, ''Taken at the Flood'' (1960) p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Lasker's pioneering contributions was the introduction into public schools of classes that explained to young girls about puberty and [[menstruation]] (done to promote [[Kotex]] [[tampons]]). He is also credited as the creator of the [[soap opera]] genre, and using radio and television as media driven by advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heinrich|first1=Thomas|last2=Batchelor|first2=Bob|title=Kotex, Kleenex, Huggies: Kimberly-Clark and the Consumer Revolution in American Business|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xlPNB5HpRDIC&amp;pg=PA83|year=2004|publisher=Ohio State University Press|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cruikshank|first1=Jeffrey L.|last2=Schultz|first2=Arthur|title=The Man Who Sold America: The Amazing (but True!)

Morello, ''Selling the President, 1920: Albert D. Lasker, Advertising, and the Election of Warren G. Harding'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

===On the radio from the 1920s===
{{main article|History of broadcasting}}
[[File:1930.05.06 Advertisement for Radio Broadcast With Lisa Roma.gif|thumb|Advertisement for a live radio broadcast, sponsored by a milk company and published in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' on May 6, 1930]]

In the early 1920s, the first radio stations were established by radio equipment manufacturers and retailers who offered programs in order to sell more radios to consumers. Madison Avenue early on recognized the importance of radio as a new advertising medium. Advertising provided the major funding for most stations. United States, never had a licensing fee for set users.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Smulyan]], ''Selling radio: The commercialization of American broadcasting, 1920-1934'' (Smithsonian Inst Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;  Great Britain Use the mandatory fee on set owners to fund the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]], Which to this day operates without commercials or advertising.  However, the government permitted
commercial television in 1954 and commercial radio in 1972.

[[Public service advertising]], [[non-commercial advertising]], public interest advertising, [[cause marketing]], and [[social marketing]] are different terms for (or aspects of) the use of sophisticated advertising and marketing communications techniques (generally associated with commercial enterprise) on behalf of non-commercial, public interest issues and initiatives.

In the United States, the granting of television and radio licenses by the FCC is contingent upon the station broadcasting a certain amount of [[public service ad]]vertising. To meet these requirements, many broadcast stations in America air the bulk of their required public service announcements during the late night or early morning when the smallest percentage of viewers are watching, leaving more day and prime time commercial slots available for high-paying advertisers.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Public service advertising in the United States reached its height during the world wars.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Creel]], ''How we advertised America: The first telling of the amazing story of the Committee on Public Information that carried the gospel of Americanism to every corner of the globe'' (1920).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Hollihan, "Propagandizing in the interest of war: A rhetorical study of the committee on public information." ''Southern Journal of Communication'' 49#3 (1984): 241-257.&lt;/ref&gt; During WWII President Roosevelt commissioned the creation of The War Advertising Council (now known as the [[Ad Council]]) which is the United States' largest developer of PSA campaigns on behalf of government agencies and non-profit organizations, including the longest-running public service campaign, [[Smokey Bear]].&lt;ref&gt;Dannagal Goldthwaite Young, "Sacrifice, consumption, and the [[American way]] of life: Advertising and domestic propaganda during World War II." ''The Communication Review'' 8#1 (2005) pp: 27-52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Griffith, "The Selling of America: The Advertising Council and American Politics, 1942–1960." ''Business History Review'' 57#3 (1983): 388-412 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3114050 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1930s and World War II===
Advertising came under heavy pressure in the 1930s. The [[Great Depression]] forced businesses to drastically cut back on their advertising spending. Layoffs and reductions were common at all agencies. The [[New Deal]] furthermore aggressively promoted [[consumerism]], and minimized the value or need of advertising.  Historian Jackson Lears argues that "By the late 1930s, though, corporate advertisers had begun a successful counterattack against their critics." They rehabilitated the concept of consumer sovereignty by inventing scientific public opinion polls, and making it the centerpiece of their own [[market research]], as well has the key to understanding politics. [[George Gallup]], the vice president of [[Young and Rubicam]], and numerous other advertising experts, led the way.  Moving into the 1940s, the industry played a leading role in the ideological mobilization of the American people for fighting the Nazis and Japanese in World War II. As part of that effort, they redefined the "American Way of Life" in terms of a commitment to free enterprise. "Advertisers," Lears concludes, "played a crucial hegemonic role in creating the consumer culture that dominated post-World War II American society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jackson Lears|title=Fables Of Abundance: A Cultural History Of Advertising In America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RgoXBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA235|year=1995|publisher=Basic Books|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean M. Converse," ''Survey Research in the United States: Roots and Emergence 1960'' (1987) pp: 114-24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postwar era===
In the prosperous postwar era, millions of Americans moved into new housing, especially in the rapidly growing suburbs. They spent heavily on housing, appliances, furniture, clothing and automobiles. The coming of television in the 1950s dramatically enlarged the arena for advertising. With most families having automobiles, and more leisure time, travel holidays became much more common, and the motel and [[tourism]] industries eagerly supported large-scale advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Richard K. Popp, ''The Holiday Makers: Magazines, Advertising and Mass Tourism in Postwar America'' (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the public service arena, the Ad Council aggressively promoted [[Americanism (ideology)|Americanism]] as a [[Cold War]] strategy, with campaigns such as the Freedom Train, the Crusade for Freedom, Religion in American Life, Adams for Piece, and Peoples Capitalism.  The new Brand Names Foundation sponsored conferences, local campaigns, and educational programs to promote brand loyalty, as well as free enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Dawn Spring, ''Advertising in the Age of Persuasion: Building Brand America, 1941-1961'' (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Hidden Persuaders'' (1957) popular writer [[Vance Packard]] exposes the use of consumer [[motivational research]] and other psychological techniques, including depth psychology and [[subliminal message|subliminal]] tactics. They had been used to manipulate expectations and induce desire for products since the 1920s, but the popular audience was caught by surprise. He identified eight "compelling needs" that advertisers promise products will fulfill. According to Packard these needs are so strong that people are compelled to buy products to satisfy them. The book questions the [[morality]] of using these techniques.&lt;ref name=DiRenzo&gt;Gordon Di Renzo (1958) ''The American Catholic Sociological Review'', Vol. 19, No. 4 (Dec., 1958) (Review)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Racial themes====
Before the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s, black people were largely missing from mainstream white advertising. Those who did appear typically followed the long-standing "hierarchy of skin color" whereby those with lighter skin tones were seen as being more socially and culturally acceptable than dark-skinned black people.&lt;ref&gt;Julia M. Bristor, Renee Gravois Lee, and Michelle R. Hunt. "Race and ideology: African-American images in television advertising." ''Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing'' (1995): 48-59. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30000378 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jannette Lake Dates and William Barlow, eds., ''Split image: African Americans in the mass media'' (Howard University Press, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most national corporations before the 1960s ignored the black market, and paid little attention to working with black merchants or hiring blacks for responsible positions. [[Pepsi|Pepsi-Cola]] was a major exception, as the number two brand fought for parity with [[Coca-Cola]].  The upstart soda brand hired black promoters who penetrated into black markets across the South and the urban North. Journalist Stephanie Capparell interviewed six men who were on the team in the late 1940s: 
:The team members had a grueling schedule, working seven days a week, morning and night, for weeks on end. They visited bottlers, churches, "ladies groups," schools, college campuses, YMCAs, community centers, insurance conventions, teacher and doctor conferences, and various civic organizations. They got famous jazzmen such as Duke Ellington and Lionel Hampton to give shout-outs for Pepsi from the stage. No group was too small or too large to target for a promotion.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Capparell, "How Pepsi Opened Door to Diversity." ''CHANGE'' 63 (2007): 1-26 [http://www.comlabgames.com/45-870N/instructor/01_day/How_Pepsi_Opened_Door_to_Diversity.pdf online].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:New-York tribune., November 07, 1909, Page 20, Image 44 Aunt Jemima.jpg|right|thumb|Quaker Oats 1909 newspaper ad directed at white consumers with stereotypical images and dolls.]]

Pepsi advertisements avoided the stereotypical images common in the major media that depicted  one-dimensional [[Aunt Jemima]]s and [[Uncle Ben's|Uncle Bens]] whose role was to draw a smile from white customers. Instead it portrayed black customers as self-confident [[middle-class]] citizens who showed very good taste in their soft drinks. They were economical too, as Pepsi bottles were twice the size.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Capparell, ''The Real Pepsi Challenge: The Inspirational Story of Breaking the Color Barrier in American Business'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1960s, more than a few token blacks were hired at advertising agencies, and the sensitivity to the problem increased.  The leading black  magazines [[Essence (magazine)|''Essence'']] and [[Jet (magazine)|''Jet'']] routinely deplored racism in mainstream media, especially in the negative depictions of black men and women. However ''Essence'' and ''Jet'' in the 21st century themselves ran about a dozen ads a year, especially for skin lighteners, that were pervaded with "racism and White supremacy."&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa Hazell and Juanne Clarke, "Race and Gender in the Media: A Content Analysis of Advertisements in Two Mainstream Black Magazines" ''Journal of Black Studies'' (2008) 39#1 pp 5-21. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40282545 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tobacco====
By the 1950s, fears of [[cancer]] from tobacco [[smoking]] caused consternation in the [[tobacco industry]], which turned to advertisers for help in avoiding falling consumer [[demand]] and increased regulation. British and American agencies separately arrived at similar solutions.  The Tobacco Industry Research Committee in the United States and the Tobacco Manufacturers' Standing Committee in Britain each assuaged public anxieties and encouraged the misperception that the cigarette makers were resolving the issues through filters and low tar formulations. The public relations approach was successful in the short run, but the accumulation of medical evidence led to a fall in smoking, heavier taxation, and increased regulation. The agencies responded with sophisticated advertising strategies designed to encourage adolescent smokers as well as to recruit new smokers in [[developing countries|less-developed foreign markets]].&lt;ref&gt;David T. Courtwright,  "'Carry on Smoking': Public Relations and Advertising Strategies of American and British Tobacco Companies since 1950," ''Business History'' (2005) 47#3 pp 421-432. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00076790500056044?journalCode=fbsh20 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cable television from the 1980s===
The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the introduction of cable television and particularly [[MTV]]. Pioneering the concept of the music video, MTV ushered in a new type of advertising: the consumer tunes in ''for'' the advertising message, rather than it being a [[by-product]] or afterthought. As cable and satellite television became increasingly prevalent, [[specialty channel]]s emerged, including channels entirely [[Shopping channel|devoted to advertising]], such as [[QVC]], [[Home Shopping Network]], and [[ShopTV Canada]].

===On the Internet from the 1990s===
{{main article|Online advertising}}
With the advent of the [[ad server]], marketing through the Internet opened new frontiers for advertisers and contributed to the "[[dot-com bubble|dot-com]]" boom of the 1990s. Entire corporations operated solely on advertising revenue, offering everything from [[coupon]]s to free Internet access. At the turn of the 21st century, a number of websites, including the [[Web search engine|search engine]] [[Google]], started a change in [[online advertising]] by emphasizing contextually relevant ads based on an individual's browsing interests. This has led to a plethora of similar efforts and an increasing trend of [[interactive advertising]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The share of advertising spending relative to GDP has changed little across large changes in media. For example, in the US in 1925, the main advertising media were newspapers, magazines, signs on [[Tram|streetcars]], and outdoor [[poster]]s. Advertising spending as a share of GDP was about 2.9 percent. By 1998, television and radio had become major advertising media. Nonetheless, advertising spending as a share of GDP was slightly lower – about 2.4 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galbithink.org/ad-spending.htm |title=Annual U.S. Advertising Expenditure Since 1919 |publisher=Galbithink.org |date=September 14, 2008 |accessdate=April 20, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090401205848/http://galbithink.org/ad-spending.htm| archivedate= April 1, 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advertising business model has also been adapted since the 1990s.  In [[media for equity]], advertising is not sold, but provided to start-up companies in return for [[equity (finance)|equity]]. If the company grows and is sold, the media companies receive cash for their shares.

Chinese advertising is moving heavily to the smartphone, leaving television behind. Companies in China are increasingly more focused on mobile advertisements than on television advertisements. Central roles are played by Chinese-based social networking sites Weixin (also known as WeChat), and Sina Weibo, and the efforts of Western companies, including Coca-Cola, Burberry, and North Face, to market to Chinese consumers through their smartphones.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Stevenson and Shanshan Wang. "A Jump to Mobile Ads in China." ''New York Times'', 22 Dec 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Restrictions on advertising====
Since the 1950s, the industry itself, or the government, has imposed some restrictions on advertising certain types of products, especially liquor and cigarettes. Tobacco bans exist in many major countries across the world and cover 2.3 billion people.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, ''WHO report on the global tobacco epidemic, 2013: enforcing bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship'' (World Health Organization, 2013) [http://www.who.int/tobacco/global_report/2013/en/ online]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1990s Quebec banned some advertising directed at children. The restrictions have hindered competition in the breakfast cereal market when compared with the rest of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;C. Robert Clark, "Advertising Restrictions and Competition in the Children's Breakfast Cereal Industry," ''Journal of Law &amp; Economics'' (2007) 50#4 pp 757-780.

===France===
[[Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet]] (1906-1996) was the most prominent leader of French advertising in the 20th century. He founded [[Publicis]]. After 1945 his little-known Paris-based advertising agency grew rapidly, becoming the world's fourth largest agency. It was a leader in promoting France's post-war economic boom, especially the expansion of the advertising industry. It was successful because of its close ties with top officials of the French government, its clever use of symbols to promote itself, and its ability to attract clients from widely diverse growing industries.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Lorin, ''5 Giants of Advertising'' (Assouline Pub., 2001). pp 82-95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark Hultquist, "Publicis and the French advertising world, 1946--1968" ''Essays in Economic &amp; Business History'' (2009) 27: 61-76&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of whether advertising reflects society or shapes society, can be seen in European models that diverged from the American style.  In France, [[Michelin]] dominated the tire industry and was one of the leading advertisers; to this day [[Michelin Guide|its famous guidebooks]] are very widely used by upscale travelers.  From 1894 to the present its symbol was [[Bibendum]] (the "Michelin Man" made of tires). He was a lord of industry, a master of all he surveyed, and a patriotic expounder of the French spirit. In the 1920s, Bibendum urged Frenchmen to adopt America's superior factory system, but to patriotically avoid using the "inferior" products of those factories.  As automobiles diffused to the middle classes, Michelin advertising likewise shifted downscale, and its restaurant and hotel guides covered a broader range of price categories.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen L. Harp, ''Marketing Michelin. Advertising and Cultural Identity in Twentieth-Century France'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marc Martin,  "Le marché publicitaire Français et les grands médias 1918-1970." ''Vingtieme siecle. Revue d'histoire'' (1988): 75-90. [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/xxs_0294-1759_1988_num_20_1_2796 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

J Walter Thompson expanded successfully in many countries, but France was not one of them.  French businessmen did not like the American tone, and were fearful of Americanization. The French market was heavily regulated and protected to repel foreign interests, and the American admen in Paris were not good at hiding their condescension and insensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;Clark Eric Hultquist,  "Americans in Paris: The J. Walter Thompson Company in France, 1927–1968." ''Enterprise and Society'' 4#03 (2003): 471-501.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain===
As millions of American soldiers passed through  Britain during the Second World War, there were fearsof an "Americanization" of British commerce and culture. The Marshall Plan explicitly required and upgrading of the marketing and organizational skills of British industry. There were fears among the leaders of the  London advertising world of what the brash, rich Americans would do to them.    Radio and television was off limits to advertising, because BBC relied on fees paid by owners of radio receivers.  The question was whether the heavily funded American methods would prove irresistible. JWT London was an American owned  advertising agency controlled by J. Walter Thompson in New York City.   JWT London avoided being  the bold apostle of the American style. Instead  it is relied on soft persuasion, shedding its Americanness to adapt to the British understated style.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Nixon,  "Apostles of Americanization? J. Walter Thompson Company Ltd, Advertising and Anglo-American Relations 1945-67," ''Contemporary British History'' (2008) 22#4 pp 477-499.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In the 1920s, most advertising was handled by manufacturing companies in-house. Numerous small advertising agencies handled purchase of space in the media, but did not design campaigns or the ads themselves. An important role was played by travelling salesmen in promoting products to wholesalers and retailers and providing feedback from the market to the producer.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela E. Swett, ''Selling under the Swastika: Advertising and Commercial Culture in Nazi Germany'' (2014) ch 1&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Nazi era (1933–45), the advertising industry expelled its Jews, and came under the supervision of the "Ad Council for the German Economy," a department of the propaganda ministry of [[Joseph Goebbels]]. The relationship was friendly, For the industry learned a great deal from the Nazi propaganda techniques. The industry promoted Hitler's favorite products, such as the promised Volkswagen automobile for the people, and the construction of autobahns. It emphasized the availability of trusted brands despite growing shortages after the war began in 1939. It helped support the regime, articulating a vision of consumption that was well aligned with the Nazi spirit. In some environments and social movements, such as with post-WW2 East Germany Stasi's [[zersetzung]], criminology theorists estimated advertisement was used as a means to crime, the nature of the crime was the intentional exploitation of an individual to cause damage to the individual's ability to form social bonds and appropriate perceptions of the world. This is especially true in the case of manipulation, people take advantage of their underdeveloped social skills and exploit them for selfish gain, this was later criticized to be adopted by turpitude agents of modern advertising. Many major brands were off the market by 1944, because of severe shortages. When they returned after the war, they were welcomed as an index of normality and were not associated with Nazism.&lt;ref&gt;Swett, ''Selling under the Swastika'' (2014) ch 2-6&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1950s, German advertising agencies were starting to mimic American methods.&lt;ref&gt;Harm G. Schröter, "Die Amerikanisierung der Werbung in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland," ["The Americanization of advertising in West Germany."] ''Jahrbuch für Wirtschaftsgeschichte'' (1997), Issue 1, pp 93-115, dates the Americanization to the 1960s.&lt;/ref&gt;  Coca-Cola was advising  "Mach mal Pause" ("Take a Rest!), and conservative Chancellor Konrad Adenauer was running for reelection with the slogan "Keine Experimente!" ("No Experiments!").&lt;ref&gt;Gries, Rainer et al. "Die Ära Adenauer: Zeitgeschichte im Werbeslogan. 'Mach Mal Pause,' 'Keine Experimente!'" ''Journal Geschichte'' (1989)  Issue 3, pp 9-15.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The German agencies have always remained small and limited in scope,&lt;ref&gt;"German agencies often overlooked on global scene." ''Marketing News'' (Aug 29, 1986) v. 20 p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; even after the unification of East Germany and West Germany in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Cote and Dagmar Mussey, "German advertising growing together: unification of Germany, EC electrify market," ''Advertising Age'' (Feb. 11 1991), V. 62, pp 25-26&lt;/ref&gt; After unification, Germany became the third largest ad market in the world, with $18 billion in total ad spending in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;''Advertising Age'' (March 21, 1994) v. 65 p. I-14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
The American influence became strong in Italy after 1945.  The high risk of communist success led the American government to invest heavily in propaganda activities.&lt;ref&gt;Simona Tobia. ''Advertising America: The United States Information Service in Italy (1945–1956)'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  Several American firms opened offices, including Young &amp; Rubicon and Ogilvy &amp; Mather. Italian graphic designers, most prominently [[Armando Testa]], were inspired by modernist aesthetics and thinking brought in by the American advertising agencies and techniques in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Simona De Iulio,  and Carlo Vinti, "La publicité italienne et le modèle américain: le débat entre les artistes et techniciens, 1948-1960," [Italian advertising and the American model: the debate between artists and technicians, 1948-60] ''Vingtième Siecle'' (2009), Issue 101, pp 61-80.&lt;/ref&gt;  The advertising industry helped transform Italy into a consumer-oriented society.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Arvidsson, "Pubblicita E Consumi Nell'Italia Del Dopoguerra" [Advertising and consumerism in postwar Italy] ''Contemporanea: Rivista di Storia dell '800 e del '900'' (2001) 4#4 pp 649-672.&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Oliviero Toscani International Journalism Festival 3.jpg|thumb|200px|Oliviero Toscani]]

A dramatic example of how advertising nudged the Italian middle-class into modern consumer society appears in the heavily advertised automatic washing machine. It appeared on the Italian market in 1958 and by 1965, 23% of families had purchased one, reaching 42% by 1970. Advertisers hailed the  mechanization of domestic tedium as the advent of a new women's "liberation."  Commentary appeared everywhere, from advertisements to the specialized press, to women's reviews. Architects and designers made room for the new marvel, as the promotional language celebrating the device became a chorus of praise for domestic appliances as the secret of  "progress" and "freedom" and "liberation."  On the other hand, husbands still insisted on driving the family automobile; it was off-limits to the liberated female.&lt;ref&gt;Enrica Asquer, "La Signora Candy e la sua lavatrice: storia di un'intesa perfetta nell'Italia degli anni Sessanta." [Mrs. Candy and her washing machine: a perfect love story in 1960s Italy] ''Genesis'' 1 (2006) pp: 1000-1022.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Armando Testa Set up a full-service advertising agency in 1956, specializing in the new medium of television advertising.  He was inspired by Eastern European animation techniques, and often use simple graphics like the blue hippo. His son Marco Testa, trained at Benton &amp; Bowles in New York, and maintained the fast-paced, witty style.&lt;ref&gt;Tungate, ''Adland: A Global History of Advertising'' pp 138-43&lt;/ref&gt; Emmanuelle Pirella, who trained at the Italian offices of Young &amp; Rubicon and Ogilvy &amp; Mather, emerged as a leading copywriter.

[[Benetton Group|Benetton]] gained worldwide attention for its saucy advertising, inspired by its art director [[Oliviero Toscani]]. He started with multicultural themes, tied together under the campaign "United Colors of Benetton" then became increasingly provocative with interracial groupings, and unusual sexual images, such as a nun kissing a priest.&lt;ref&gt;Tungate, ''Adland: A Global History of Advertising'' pp 146-49&lt;/ref&gt;

== Since 1900: Asia and Africa==

===Japan===
[[Dentsu]] is the dominant firm in Japan thanks to its origins as a media representative. It produced Japan's first newspaper advertisements as well as the first television commercials. It was established in 1901 as Japan Advertising Ltd. and Telegraphic Service Co. by Hoshiro Mitsunaga. In 1936, it sold off its news division to Doumei News Agency, to focus on advertising. In 1946, it purchased 16 small companies and set up operational bases in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, and Kyūshū. Dentsu company now offers a range of services, from traditional and creative marketing to specialty disciplines such as sports marketing, investing in feature film production and acquiring broadcasting rights, PR, digital contents, and a growing range of communications services.&lt;ref&gt;Kotaro Sugiyama and Tim Andree. ''The Dentsu Way: Secrets of Cross Switch Marketing from the World's Most Innovative Advertising Agency'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
In the first 20 years of communist control of China (1947 to 1966) Mao Zedong tried to reverse the long-standing advertising practices of Chinese newspapers, considering it a capitalist infringement on the goals of socialism. Consumerism, which had been highly developed in Shanghai, was anathema, to Mao's peasant-based communist perspective. The regime emphasized maximum production rather than optimal consumption. The approach worsened the massive famines that happened when national resources were devoted to a highly inefficient factory production at the cost of basic food output. On the other hand, propaganda was highly developed art in the Communist Party, and so a sort of  compromise was reached. Socialist-oriented advertising emphasized the collective good, rather than the benefits of products for the individual consumer.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Gerth, "Compromising with Consumerism in Socialist China: Transnational Flows and Internal Tensions in 'Socialist Advertising'", ''Past &amp; Present'' (2013 Supplement)  pp 203-232  [http://karl-gerth.pubs-hub.ucsd.edu/mm_uploads/gerth-past-y-present-2013.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1980, the strength of the private economy, and advertising, has grown dramatically.  By the 1980s much emphasis was placed on the role of advertising in promoting [[Chinese economic reform|the Four Modernizations]] emphasized by [[Deng Xiaoping]].  Lip service is still paid to old Maoist ideals by recycling images of historic places and episodes, but it does not inhibit the growth of consumerism.&lt;ref&gt;Xin Zhao and Russell W. Belk, "Politicizing Consumer Culture: Advertising's Appropriation of Political Ideology in China's Social Transition," ''Journal of Consumer Research'' (2008) 35#2 pp 231-244&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Chinese entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2002, its advertising industry has fundamentally changed. It has become the world's fastest-growing advertising market and the country with the largest pool of netizens.  Major changes have come in terms of shifting cultural values, the growing role of brand names,  the attractiveness of English-language titles to the younger generation,  the redefinition of  acceptable/offensive advertising,  the very rapid growth of new media (especially the Internet and smart phones),  the emergence of on-line shopping in a country with an underdeveloped system of department stores in shopping centers, and much more advanced techniques of managing advertising agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Kineta Hung, et al.  "Advertising Research in the Post-WTO Decade in China," ''Journal of Advertising'' (2012) 41#3 pp 121-146&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
Many elements of Indian culture and industry have British roots, so that British advertising models usually work well. In 1991, the government dramatically liberalized Indian economy, opening it to international business. The emergence of a moderately affluent middle-class numbering in the hundreds of millions attracts multinational corporations and international advertisers.&lt;ref&gt;William M. O'Barr, "Advertising in India." ''Advertising &amp; Society Review'' 9#.3 (2008) pp: 1-33. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/advertising_and_society_review/v009/9.3.o-barr.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aruna Chandra, David A. Griffith, and John K. Ryans, "Advertising standardisation in India: US multinational experience" ''International Journal of Advertising'' (2002) 21#1 pp47-66&lt;/ref&gt;  Advertising in India operates at two levels. Ads for high-value products appear in English-language papers such as ''The Hindu'' and ''The Madras Mail,'' which targeted Europeans and high-status Indians. By contrast, ads for low-value products are typically placed in vernacular papers and are aimed at a lower middle class with highly restricted spending power. The working class and peasant populations, with very low disposable incomes, are seldom targeted by the advertising agencies. Local merchants might use signs and posters to reach them.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas E. Haynes, "Advertising and the History of South Asia, 1880–1950" p 363&lt;/ref&gt;  Cricket is one sport where the Indians have had an international success, so that cricket stars are prominent endorsers in national advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Sumit Sharma, "Indian cricket players are becoming big winners for many advertisers," ''Asian Wall Street Journal'' (May 11, 1998) p 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Subtle cultural norms can be easily transgressed. In 2002, widespread protests forced Hindustan Lever Ltd. (the Indian subsidiary of London-based Unilever) to cancel  a television ad campaign for its fairness cream because of its portrayal of women. The campaign was built around the theme of a father lamenting "If only I had a son" while showing his problem: a dark-skinned, unattractive daughter.  Fast-forward.  She uses the Fair &amp; Lovely cream and has become a gorgeous light-skinned beauty.  Clad in a stylish miniskirt, she is a successful airline flight attendant and takes her proud father to dine at a five-star hotel.  The All India Women's Democratic Association ([[AIDWA]]), a far left political organization, lodged a complaint with the National Human Rights Commission in New Delhi. It argued endorsing the traditional preference for sons strengthens gender discrimination, which is a major problem in India. Furthermore, said AIDWA, the ad perpetuated a culture of discrimination in a society where "fair skin" is synonymous with "beautiful."  The government's Ministry of Information and Broadcast sided with AIDWA and directed stations not to air the ads because they violated the Cable and Television Networks Act of 1995 which states that no advertisement shall be permitted which "derides any race, caste, color, creed and nationality" and furthermore states that, "Women must not be portrayed in a manner that emphasizes passive, submissive qualities and encourages them to play a subordinate secondary role in the family and society."  The minister told Parliament that if broadcasters do not regulate ad content the government will be forced to do so. The Mumbai-based Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI), a body of advertisers and media agencies, insisted that it should do the regulating not the government. ASCI had already told Hindustan Lever that its ad campaign was offensive and it was ended.&lt;ref&gt;Arundhati Parmar, "Objections to Indian ad not taken lightly" ''Marketing News'' (June 9, 2003) 37#12 pp 4-9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developing world===
During the decolonization era from the late 1940s to the 1970s, British and French firms operating  in Africa and Asia at first largely ignored local, nationalistic aspirations.  However they learned to  adjust to exploit  the new spirit of independence that was shaping consumer attitudes.  The new emergence of a middle class was the target audience.  Their advertising abandoned the traditional  paternalistic attitude toward the natives. Instead there was a portrayal of locals as up-and-coming middle class men  in control of developing their nations. These more positive images assisted business operations  during spells of military dictatorship, economic nationalism, and expropriation of foreign assets.&lt;ref&gt;Sephanie Decker, "Corporate Legitimacy and Advertising: British Companies and the Rhetoric of Development in West Africa, 1950-1970," ''Business History Review'' (2007) 81#1 pp 59-86&lt;/ref&gt; Tobacco advertising was especially important. For example, in Egyptian popular culture the cigar was associated with elites, the water pipe with a lower-class and traditional lifestyle, and the cigarette with the new middle class which was striving to make the transition to modernity.  It was the third group that the cigarette industry targeted.&lt;ref&gt;Relli Shechter, "Reading advertisements in a colonial/development context: Cigarette advertising and identity politics in Egypt, c1919-1939." ''Journal of social history'' 39#2 (2005): 483-503. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3790779 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil is the largest country in Latin America, and number five in the world in terms of population. Its economy grew rapidly in the 21st century, until it began to stall in 2010. At that time it was the world's sixth-biggest advertising market, at $US 14.2 billion.  Brazil in 2010 ranks #1 in deodorants, #2 in children's products, #3 in cosmetics, and #4 in automobile sales&lt;ref&gt;Laurel Wentz and Claudia Penteado, "Why so many agencies are storming road to Sao Paulo" ''Advertising Age'' (Dec. 6 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mexico====
The start in 1994 of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] had a dramatic impact on the adveritising industry in Mexico, with its 130 full service agencies and 270 smaller operations under the auspisces of the Mexican Association of Advertising Agencies.  The flood of American brand-name products greatly expanded the scope of the advertising industry, and the Mexican agencies faced new competition from branch offices of international firms.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick McCurry, "Advertising in transition: agencies change their image to meet market demand" ''Business Mexico'' (Sept. 1992) 2#4, Vol. 2, p4+&lt;/ref&gt;

A key to the new market was that upscale consumers in Mexico typically display [[Malinchism|"malinchismo"]], which is a preference for imported American brands rather than local Mexican brands. As a result, American products are sold mostly to the middle class market, and their advertising agencies generally avoid working class and rural areas. They concentrate their efforts instead on Mexico City, Monterrey, and Guadalajara, which purchase 70 percent of the American imports.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Ueltschy, and John K. Ryans, Jr., "Employing standardized promotion strategies in Mexico: the impact of language and cultural differences," ''International Executive'' (July 1997) 39#4 pp 479+&lt;/ref&gt;  Advertising battles in Mexico, include not only issues of quality, but issues of national authenticity. For example, in Mexico in the 1990s, two American exporters Procter &amp; Gamble and Frito-Lay fought an advertising battle concerning whose potato chips are tastier, more natural, and more Mexican. Procter &amp; Gamble challenged Frito-Lay's Sabritas which controls 80 percent of the $1 billion chip market.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Friedland, "P&amp;G, Frito-Lay in Mexican—ad standoff," ''Wall Street Journal'' (March 19, 1999).

'''Jointness''' is a term ([http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=psc.046.0337a R. Solan 1991]) in [[psychoanalysis]] and [[psychodynamic]] theory, describing a new look at normal [[object relation]] that takes place from the beginning of life. Till nowadays [[symbiosis]] (propounded by [[Margaret Mahler]] 1968, 1975) is the common term for a normal object relation, while Ronnie Solan emphasizes that symbiosis represents impairment in object relation.

'''Jointness''' is defined as a dynamic process representing an emotional system for [[attachment theory|attachment]] and for [[communication]] between separate individuals who jointly approach each other in a third, joint, [[transitional object|virtual space]]. Jointness represents an encounter between mother and [[infant]], [[psychotherapy|psychotherapist]] and patient, or any partners experiencing simultaneously mutual [[intimacy]], while concomitantly safeguarding separateness.

The [[newborn]], very early in life, perceives the [[Other (philosophy)|other]], even his mother, as a "not-I" (it indicates a psychic process to safeguard one's own self), and is attached to the "not-I mother" by an intimate acquaintance with her through his/her senses. When both, mother and baby, devote themselves to intimacy, that temporarily blurs the boundaries between them, separateness can be safeguarded. As a result, baby might gradually develop his/her own boundaries and acknowledge those of his or her object and might invest their own innate abilities to participate in human interactions and enjoy relationships ("motivational systems," Emde, 1988).

The development of this basic process of jointness between baby and mother depends on mother's capacity to tolerate separateness. It is the mother who imprints the quality and the intensity of the rapprochement-separation balancing process in their relationship, while both of them are fully invested in each other.

The unique jointness and the unique communication, in a unique psychic virtual space are created by the sharing of interests (emotional or cognitive), and by the mutual investment of partners in a joint phenomenon, object, or idea, meaningful to both. All vital human communication represents both the separateness of the two (or more) individuals and their joining in a third virtual space. Thus, "jointness" elicits the '''triadic''' (triangulation) object relations (mother's space – "virtual transitional space" – baby's space).

In this type of [[transitional object|transitional space]] baby and mother, lovers, or partners of a common task, are jointly determine the extent of [[rapprochement]] between themselves, the extent of safeguarding separateness and also the moment to separate. Each of them is sensorily attentive to the strangeness and the separateness of the “non-I” that the other represents for him. Such a [[psychodynamics|dynamic]] process of jointness, represents healthy [[Developmental psychology|development]] from birth, paves the way to a sense of individuation and culminates to establish the valuable communication with others relating to their otherness, while preserving separateness and self integrity.

It is important to distinguish between '''jointness''' and '''symbiosis'''. Both may commence with the beginning of life; they may seem similar, and yet they are widely different experiences. In symbiosis, baby and mother behave and function as though they were "an omnipotent system - a dual unity within one common boundary" (Margaret Mahler, 1968, p.&amp;nbsp;201). Partners of symbiosis can be fully satisfied as long as there is no hint of separateness. Jointness, on the other hand, represents both the separateness of the two (or more) individuals and their joining in a third virtual space.

The development of this basic process (between baby and mother) in '''symbiosis''' depends on mother's inability to endure separateness while both of them are fully invested in each other. It is the mother who imprints on their encounter her need to contain herself with her baby in one unit and to prevent the encouragement of separateness in favor of the boundaries of their unity. Both partners will be motivated, through life, by a powerful need for merging and they will remain almost addicted to finding another object to merge with and attach their symbiotic needs, even at the expense of sacrificing their individuation, their true-self and their self-esteem. Such an encounter fosters only a dyadic relation where the "transitional virtual space" between them is missing.

Hence, '''symbiosis''' is a dyadic pathological process, even from the beginning of life that results in self fragility, [[narcissistic]] disturbances and in an immature personality; while '''jointness''' represents a triadic healthy development that depends on [[healthy narcissism]] and generates separation-individuation, communication and relationship.

'''José Craveirinha''' (28 May 1922 - 6 February 2003) was a Mozambican journalist, story writer and poet, who is today considered the greatest [[poet]] of Mozambique.&lt;ref name="b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enc"/&gt; His poems, written in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], address such issues as [[racism]] and the Portuguese [[colonialism|colonial]] domination of Mozambique. A supporter of the anti-Portuguese group [[FRELIMO]] during the colonial wars, he was imprisoned in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="b"/&gt; He was one of the [[Africa]]n pioneers of the [[Négritude]] movement, and published six books of poetry between 1964 and 1997.&lt;ref name="enc"/&gt; Craveirinha also wrote under the pseudonyms '''Mário Vieira''', '''José Cravo''', '''Jesuíno Cravo''', '''J. Cravo''', '''J.C.''', '''Abílio Cossa''', and '''José G. Vetrinha'''.

==Biography==
Born in [[Maputo]], [[Mozambique]] (then Lourenço Marques, [[Portuguese Mozambique]]), the child of a Portuguese father and a black mother of the [[Ronga]] ethnicity, Craveirinha was raised in the language and culture of [[Portugal]].

As a journalist, he contributed to numerous Mozambican magazines and newspapers, including ''[[O Brado Africano]]'' (1918–74), ''Notícias'', ''Tribuna'', ''Notícias da Tarde'', ''Voz de Moçambique'', ''Notícias da Beira'', ''Diário de Moçambique'', and ''Voz Africana''. He became familiar with other poets of the period through his journalism, notably [[Rui de Noronha]] (1909–1943), [[Marcelino dos Santos]] (1929– ), and [[Noemia de Sousa]] (1926–2003).&lt;ref name="a"/&gt; His works were primarily political in nature. Consistent themes in his work were African self-determination, images of the African landscape, and writing that reflected the influence of African languages.&lt;ref name="b"/&gt;

Craveirinha began his political activity at the [[Lourenço Marques African Association]] in the 1950s, an organization tolerated by the colonial Portuguese government, and later became its chairperson. He became involved in clandestine politics in this period, and became a member of a cell of [[FRELIMO]], the leading movement for the liberation of Mozambique from Portuguese rule. He was imprisoned in solitary confinement by the fascist Portuguese [[PIDE]] régime in 1965, a year after his publication of his first collection of poetry, ''Chigubo''.{{Ref|A|A}}&lt;ref name="l"/&gt; He was released from prison in 1969.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="b"/&gt;

When FRELIMO seized power in 1974, was appointed vice-director of the national press. He was the first president of [[Association of Mozambican Writers]] (''Associação dos Escritores Moçambicanos''), and served from 1982 and 1987. The association established the [[José Craveirinha Prize for Literature]] (''Prémio José Craveirinha de Literatura'') in 2003. Craveirinha was awarded the [[Prémio Camões]], the world's highest honour for Lusophone literature, in 1991. He is noted as the first African writer to win the prize.&lt;ref name="enc"/&gt; He was considered several times for the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. In 2003, Craveirinha was declared a "national hero" by President [[Joaquim Chissano]] of Mozambique, who praised Craveirinha's literary contribution to the fight against colonialism.

Despite his literary acclaim, Craveirinha was hesitant to have his works appear in print, and a large body of his work from the pre- and post-colonial periods remains unpublished. His wife Maria died in October 1977. Craveirinha wrote numerous poems after her death that were first published under the title ''Maria'' in 1988, and in a much fuller form in a second edition in 1998.&lt;ref name="l"/&gt;

Craveirinha also played [[football (soccer)|football]] and coached other athletes.  He arranged an athletic scholarship in the [[United States]] for [[Maria de Lurdes Mutola]], who won a gold medal in [[track and field]] at the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] in 2000, and his son Stelio also held the national long jump record.

Craveirinha died at the age of 80 while undergoing treatment in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]], in 2003.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;

'''Kim Tu-bong''' (February 16, 1889 – March 1958 or later) was the first [[Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea|Chairman]] of the [[Workers' Party of North Korea]] from 1946 to 1949. He was known in [[Koreans|Korean]] history as a [[linguist]], scholar and [[politician]]. His most famous work was under [[Ju Sigyeong]]; later, after participating in the [[March 1st Movement]], he with other Korean leaders of the time established a provisional [[government-in-exile]] in China, and because of his communist beliefs he played an important role in the early North Korean communist government. 

He and other members of the [[Yan'an faction]] formed the [[New People's Party of Korea|New People's Party]] when they returned from exile. After the New People's Party merged into the [[Workers Party of North Korea]] (WPNK) in 1946 at the [[1st Congress of the Workers' Party of North Korea|1st WPNK Congress]], he became WPNK Chairman. He was the first head of state ([[Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly]]) of [[North Korea]] from 1948 to 1957. He is most remembered in South Korea for his efforts in establishing the Korean linguistic field and especially that of [[Hangul]]. Much of his work both political and linguistically was done while living in China with the exiled government of Korea. He is also known by his pen name Baekyeon. He was [[purge]]d by [[Kim Il-sung]] in 1957.

==Early childhood and education==
Born on February 2, 1889, in South Korea's South Gyeongsang Province, near modern-day [[Pusan]], he spent his early years being homeschooled during the time of imperial rule. He would move to [[Seoul]] at the age of 20 (1908) to attend both Geho School and Baechae School and in that same year graduate from Bogo High School. While he was in [[Seoul]] he would join the Korea Youth organization in 1913 and the following year (1914) leave Baechae School. He was also an editor for the So nyoun magazine.

==Early linguistic work==
After graduating from [[Korea University|Bosungkobo]] (Bosung College) in 1908, Kim Tu-bong worked closely with a Linguistic professor from Bosungkobo named [[Ju Sigyeong]] who was at that time beginning his work in the study of [[Hangul]] for which his name would later be known for as he would dedicate his life to bring it about (the Korean script made by King Sae Jeong during the 15th century). He also worked as a teacher. In 1916 he spent a majority of his time working on compiling MalMooe, the first Korean dictionary.

==Shanghai and the exiled Korean Government==
[[FIle:28.08.1946 Labour Party North Korea.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Kim Tu-bong's portrait (right) hanging next to Stalin's portrait (left)]]
After the [[March 1st Movement]] (March 1, 1919) he and other members of the independence club fled into China and in April 1919 set up a provisional government in Shanghai. During which he was first exposed to [[Communism]] and eventually accepted it in 1920 after first supporting the Democratic Party. In 1924 he was entrusted with the department of children education and schooling where he served as the president and also taught both [[Koreans|Korean]] and Korean History. After the Japanese invaded [[China]] he and other members of the Korean government in [[Shanghai]] fled to [[Yan'an]], and there Kim would become the head of the independence club and became a very important figure in combining the conflicting views of both communist and democratic ideas.

==Return home and the new government==

The December following [[World War II]] and the Japanese's surrender (August 15, 1945) Kim Tu-bong and other members returned to the then-divided Korea. Like many other Communist-minded people of the time, Kim Tu-bong and other Communist leaders took residence in what is now [[North Korea]] under the Soviet occupation. In February 1946 Kim Tu-bong became the chairman of the new People's Party. Later that year in August it merged to form the Workers' Party. He would become the chairman in 1948, though from the outset the real power was held by Premier Kim Il-sung. Kim Tu-bong designed the new flag that is still used in North Korea today in an effort to throw off what he saw as feudal rule.

Kim Il-sung became chairman of the Workers' Party after it merged with its [[Workers' Party of South Korea|southern counterpart]] in 1949, thus becoming in name as well as in fact the country's leader. In most Communist states, the party leader is understood to be the most powerful man in the country. {{cn span|Kim Tu-bong remained as chairman of the SPA Presidium, and thus nominal head of state.|date=September 2018}}

==Disappearance and death==
After the [[Korean War]] Kim Tu-bong had served his usefulness in the government, and, whether real or imagined, many scholars believe at this point he now became a perceived threat to Kim Il-sung's dictatorship. Rumors began that it had to do with a scandal, as he had married a much younger woman later in life. Whatever the reason, he was purged in March 1958,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=Zow0AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=kim+tu+bong+1960&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22kim+tu+bong%22|title=Journal of Korean Affairs|date=22 May 1975|publisher=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; accused of involvement in the 1956 [[August Faction Incident]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=23PRnGPxSd0C&amp;pg=PT165&amp;dq=kim+tu+bong+1960&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjkn6zftpnbAhXqLsAKHSXuAgYQ6AEIQTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22kim+tu+bong%22&amp;f=false|title=Tyranny of the Weak: North Korea and the World, 1950–1992|first=Charles K.|last=Armstrong|date=18 June 2013|publisher=Cornell University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like many others of Kim Il-sung's political opponents, he disappeared with no records to indicate whether he had been sentenced to hard labor or exile. He is believed to have either been executed, or to have died some time in the 1960s in [[internal exile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=ua8NK2-F3KYC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=kim+tu+bong+1960&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjkn6zftpnbAhXqLsAKHSXuAgYQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=kim+tu+bong+1960&amp;f=false|title=From Stalin to Kim Il Song: The Formation of North Korea, 1945-1960|first=Andreĭ Nikolaevich|last=Lanʹkov|date=22 May 2018|publisher=Hurst &amp; Company|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manny Pacquiao knocks out Ricky Hatton in the second round to win the light welterweight championship.jpg|thumb|[[Manny Pacquiao]] knocks out [[Ricky Hatton]] in the second round to become the [[light welterweight]] world champion (May 2, 2009).]]

A '''knockout''' (abbreviated to '''KO''' or '''K.O.''') is a fight-ending, winning criterion in several [[full-contact]] [[combat sport]]s, such as [[boxing]], [[kickboxing]], [[Muay Thai|muay thai]], [[mixed martial arts]], [[karate]], some forms of [[World Taekwondo Federation#Sparring|taekwondo]], and other sports involving [[strike (attack)|striking]], as well as [[fighting game|fighting]]-based [[video game]]s. A full knockout is considered any legal strike or combination thereof that renders an opponent unable to continue fighting.

The term is often associated with a sudden traumatic [[loss of consciousness]] caused by a physical blow. Single powerful blows to the head (particularly the jawline and temple) can produce a [[cerebral concussion]] or a [[carotid sinus reflex]] with [[Syncope (medicine)#Blood pressure|syncope]] and cause a sudden, dramatic KO. Body blows, particularly the [[liver punch]], can cause progressive, debilitating pain that can also result in a KO.

In boxing and kickboxing, a knockout is usually awarded when one participant falls to the canvas and is unable to rise to their feet within a specified period of time, typically because of exhaustion, pain, disorientation, or [[unconsciousness]]. For example, if a boxer is knocked down and is unable to continue the fight within a ten-second count, they are counted as having been knocked out and their opponent is awarded the KO victory.

In mixed martial arts (MMA) competitions, no time count is given after a knockdown, as the sport allows [[submission grappling]] as well as [[ground and pound]]. If a fighter loses consciousness ("goes limp") as a result of legal strikes it is declared a KO.&lt;ref name=ufc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ufc.com/discover/sport/rules-and-regulations#17|title=Rules and Regulations - Unified Rules and Other MMA Regulations|website=www.ufc.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416102122/http://www.ufc.com/discover/sport/rules-and-regulations#17|archivedate=2016-04-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if the fighter loses consciousness for a brief moment and wakes up again to continue to fight, the fight is stopped and declared a KO.&lt;ref&gt;http://mixedmartialarts.com/mma-news/341856/Herb-Dean-The-fight-is-over-when-hes-unconscious{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=SheriffIsInTown |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As many MMA fights can take place on the mat rather than standing, it is possible to score a KO via ground and pound, a common victory for [[grapplers]]. 

In fighting-based video games, such as ''[[Street Fighter]]'' and ''[[Tekken]]'', a player scores a knockout by fully depleting the opponent's [[health bar]], which awards the round to the winning player. The player who wins the most rounds (by scoring the most knockouts or by having more vitality remaining when time expires during each round) wins the match. This is different from real-life combat sports, where a knockout would end the match immediately.

==Technical knockout==
A '''technical knockout''' ('''TKO''' or '''T.K.O.'''), or '''stoppage''', is declared when the referee or official ring [[physician]] decides during a round that a fighter cannot safely continue the match for any reason, without the need for an intervening count. In most regions, a TKO is declared when a fighter is knocked down three times in one round.&lt;ref&gt;Sugar, Bert. [http://www.owingsmillsboxingclub.com/boxing.htm Boxing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619215358/http://www.owingsmillsboxingclub.com/boxing.htm |date=2006-06-19 }}. ''www.owingsmillsboxingclub.com''. URL last accessed March 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Other reasons for stopping a fight include severe facial lacerations and a fighter's inability to put up a sufficient defense following a knockdown. 

A TKO only occurs if the fight is stopped during a round. If a fighter or his/her [[cornerman]] decides to end the fight between rounds, it is ruled a [[corner retirement]] or "referee technical decision" (RTD). Both TKO's and corner retirements are counted as knockouts in a fighter's record. 

In MMA bouts, the referee may declare a TKO if a fighter cannot intelligently defend him/herself while being repeatedly struck.&lt;ref name=ufc/&gt; 

==Double knockout== 
A '''double knockout''', in both real life [[combat sports]] and [[fighting game|fighting]]-based [[video game]]s, is when both fighters trade blows and knock each other out simultaneously, and are both unable to continue fighting. In such cases, the match is declared a draw. In fighting games such as ''[[Street Fighter]]'' and ''[[Tekken]]'', a draw is counted as a loss for both players. 

==Physical characteristics==
[[File:SingletonBox-knockout.jpg|thumb|275px|A knockout can be characterized by unconsciousness.]]
Little is known about what exactly causes one to be knocked unconscious, but many agree it is related to trauma to the brain stem. This usually happens when the head rotates sharply, often as a result of a strike. There are three general manifestations of such trauma:
* a typical knockout, which results in a sustained (three seconds or more) loss of consciousness (comparable to general anesthesia, when the recipient emerges and has lost memory of the event),
* a "flash" knockout, when a very transient (less than three seconds) loss of consciousness occurs (in the context of a knock-down), and the recipient often maintains awareness and memory of the combat
* a "stunning," a "dazing" or a fighter being "KO'ed on his feet", is when basic consciousness is maintained (and the fighter never leaves his feet) despite a general loss of [[awareness]] and extreme distortions in [[proprioception]], balance, visual fields, and auditory processing. Referees are taught specifically to watch for this state, as it cannot be improved by sheer willpower and usually means the fighter is already [[concussion|concussed]] and unable to safely defend themselves.

A basic principle of boxing and other combat sports is to defend against this vulnerability by keeping both hands raised about the face and the chin tucked in. That could still be ineffective if the opponent punches effectively to the [[Celiac_plexus|solar plexus]].

A fighter who becomes unconscious from a [[strike (attack)|strike]] with sufficient [[knockout power]] is referred to as having been ''knocked out'' or ''KO'd'' (''kay-ode''). Losing balance without losing consciousness is referred to as being ''knocked down'' ("down but not out"). Repeated blows to the head, regardless whether they cause loss of consciousness, are known to gradually cause permanent [[brain damage]]. In severe cases this may cause [[stroke]]s or [[paralysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mmafighting.com/2017/9/8/16279100/boxer-gets-record-22-million-settlement-from-new-york-in-brain-injury-case|title=Boxer gets record $22 million settlement from New York in brain injury case|author=|date=|website=mmafighting.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918064225/https://www.mmafighting.com/2017/9/8/16279100/boxer-gets-record-22-million-settlement-from-new-york-in-brain-injury-case|archivedate=2017-09-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This loss of consciousness is commonly known as becoming "[[Chronic traumatic encephalopathy|punch drunk]]" or "shot". Because of this, many physicians advise against sports involving knockouts.&lt;ref&gt;Lieberman, Abraham. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060515025923/http://www.liebermanparkinsonclinic.com/content/view/48/31/ Causing Parkinson: Boxing, Brain Injury].

Fighters who lose by knockout (either by ten count or technical) are automatically suspended for 30 days, three months if it is the second knockout within three months, or one year if it is the third knockout within one year.&lt;ref&gt;''Florida Administrative Weekly - Volume 15, Issues 45–52'', p. 5233.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Official Compilation of the Codes, Rules and Regulations of the State of New York'', p. 907.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Washington Administrative Code - Volume 1'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Knockdown==
[[File:Box24-knock-down.jpg|thumb|right|275px|A boxer is knocked down and receives the 10 count.]]
A '''knockdown''' occurs when a fighter touches the floor of the ring with any part of the body other than the feet following a hit, but is able to rise back up and continue fighting. The term is also used if the fighter is hanging on to the ropes, caught between the ropes, or is hanging over the ropes and is unable to fall to the floor and cannot protect himself. A knockdown triggers [[Mandatory eight count|a count]] by the referee (normally to 10); if the fighter fails the count, then the fight is ended as a KO.&lt;ref name="Boxing Terminology"&gt;[http://www.ringsidebygus.com/boxing-terms.html#k Boxing Terminology] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/68YeSZOCU?url=http://www.ringsidebygus.com/boxing-terms.html |date=2012-06-20 }} ''Ringside by Gus''. URL last accessed June 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''flash knockdown''' is a knockdown where the fighter hits the canvas but recovers quickly enough that a count is not started.&lt;ref name="Boxing Terminology"/&gt;

The '''Koma language''' is a member of the [[Duru languages|Duru]] branch of [[Savanna languages]] of Cameroon. Blench (2004) includes three varieties separated in ''Ethnologue'', Koma Ndera, Gɨmne, and Gɨmnɨme; within Koma Ndera, speakers of the marginal dialects, Gomnome and Ndera, can scarcely understand one another, though both understand the central dialect, Gomme.&lt;ref name="e18"/&gt;

[[Mali]] is a multilingual country. The languages spoken there reflect ancient settlement patterns, migrations, and its long history. ''Ethnologue'' counts more than 80 languages. Of these, [[French language|French]] is the [[official language]] and [[Bambara language|Bambara]] is the most widely spoken. Altogether 13 of the indigenous languages of Mali have the legal status of [[national language]].

==Language usage==
[[File:Statue de Patrice Émérite Lumumba - Bamako.jpg|thumb|400px|A sign in French at a monument in [[Bamako]].]]

[[French language|French]], which was introduced during the colonial period, was retained as the official language at independence and is used in government and formal education. Estimates of the number of people who actually speak French are low. Figures estimated in 1986 give a number of 386,000 speakers of French in Mali, derived from the numbers of school attendees.&lt;ref name=lafage&gt;Anne Lafage. French in Africa. Carol Sanders (ed.) French Today: Language in Its Social Context. pp 215-238. Cambridge University Press (1993) {{ISBN|0-521-39695-6}} p. 217.  This cites a report by the Haut Council du Francophonie, Bull. du FIPF (1986), pp. 10-12.&lt;/ref&gt; This would mean roughly 21% of the population speak French, by 1986 figures, a number considerably lower than those who speak Bambara.&lt;ref&gt;386,000 in a population of ~ 8.2 Million in 1986, according to Data FAOSTAT, year 2005 : http://faostat.fao.org/faostat/help-copyright/copyright-e.htm (last updated 11 February 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Almost all people who speak French in Mali speak it as a second language. '''1993''' estimates are that there are only around 9,000 Malian speakers of French as a first language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=ML ethnologue.com], cites: Johnstone (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; French is more understood in urban centres, with 1976 figures showing a 36.7% "Francophone" rate in urban areas, but only an 8.2% rate in rural areas. French usage is gender weighted as well, with '''1984''' figures showing 17.5% percent of males speaking French, but only 4.9% of women.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Lafage (1993), p. 219, citing Perrot: 1985 for both 1974 and 1984 figures.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bambara ({{lang-bm|Bamanankan}}), a [[Manding languages|Manding]] language (in the [[Mande language|Mande]] family) is said to be spoken by 80% of the population as a first or second language. It is spoken mainly in central and Southern Mali. Bambara and two other very closely related Manding languages [[Maninka language|Malinke]] or Maninkakan in the southwest and [[Xaasongaxango language|Kassonke]] (in the region of [[Kayes]] in the west), are among the 13 national languages. Bambara is used as a trade language in Mali between language groups.

(Bambara is also very close to the [[Dyula language|Dyula]] language ({{lang-dyu|Jula}} or {{lang|dyu|Julakan}}; {{lang-fr|Dioula}}), spoken mainly in [[Côte d'Ivoire|Ivory Coast]] and [[Burkina Faso]]. The name "Jula" is actually a Manding word meaning "trader.") 

Other Mande languages (not in the Manding group) include [[Soninke language|Soninke]] (in the region of [[Kayes]] in western Mali), [[Dogon languages|Dogon]] languages (of ''Pays Dogon'' or Dogon country in central Mali), the [[Bozo languages]] (along the middle [[Niger River|Niger]]).

Other languages include [[Senufo language|Senufo]] in the [[Sikasso]] region (south), [[Fula language|Fula]] ({{lang-ff|Fulfulde}}; {{lang-fr|Peul}}) as a widespread trade language in the [[Mopti]] region and beyond, the [[Songhay languages]] along the Niger, [[Tuareg languages|Tamasheq]] in the eastern part of Mali's [[Sahara]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in its western part. 

Thirteen of the most widely spoken indigenous languages are considered "[[national language]]s." &lt;!--(See Language Policy, below)--&gt;

Most formal education for the deaf in Mali uses [[American Sign Language]], introduced to West Africa by the deaf American missionary [[Andrew Foster (educator)|Andrew Foster]]. There are two other sign languages in Mali. One, [[Tebul Sign Language]], is found in a village with a high incidence of congenital deafness. Another, [[Bamako Sign Language]], developed in the after-work tea circles of the cities; it is threatened by the educational use of ASL.

== Language descriptions ==
Most of the languages of Mali are among the [[Mande languages]], which is generally accepted as a branch of [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo]], Africa's largest [[language family]]. Non-Mande languages include the [[Dogon languages]], perhaps another Niger–Congo branch, and the [[Senufo languages]], which are unquestionably part of that family. 

Mande, Senufo, and Dogon stand out among Niger–Congo because of their deviant [[subject–object–verb|SOV]] basic word order. The [[Gur languages]] are represented by [[Bomu language|Bomu]] on the [[Bani River]] of Mali and Burkina Faso. Fulfulde, spoken throughout West Africa, is a member of the [[Senegambian languages|Senegambian]] branch.

Other language families include [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]], represented by the [[Berber languages|Berber]] language Tamasheq and by Arabic, and the [[Songhay languages]], which have traditionally been classified as  [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] but may constitute an independent language family.

 * The "national languages" in some cases are actually listed at the [[macrolanguage]] or [[Language cluster|cluster]] level: Bozo, Dogon, Fula, and Songhay. (More information needed.)
 ** [[First language]] / mother tongue speakers. Figures from ''Ethnologue''.
 *** [[Second language|Second]] or additional language speakers. It is difficult to get accurate figures for this category.

==Language Policies &amp; Planning==
===General===
French is the official language. According to the Loi 96-049 of 1996  thirteen indigenous languages are recognised by the government as [[national languages]]: [[Bambara language|Bamanankan]], [[Bomu language|Bomu]], [[Bozo language|Bozo]], [[Dogon languages|Dɔgɔsɔ]], [[Fulfulde]], [[Hassaniya Arabic]], [[Mamara Senoufo language|Mamara]], [[Maninka language|Maninkakan]], [[Soninke language|Soninke]], [[Songhay languages|Soŋoy]], [[Syenara Senoufo language|Syenara]], [[Tamasheq]], [[Xaasongaxango|Xaasongaxanŋo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/axl/afrique/mali.htm Leclerc, Jacques. L'aménagement linguistique dans le monde, "Mali," Laval University, Canada].  Citing: GAUTHIER, François, Jacques LECLERC et Jacques MAURAIS. Langues et constitutions, Montréal/Paris, Office de la langue française / Conseil international de la langue française, 1993, 131 p&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loi 96-049 Portant modalités de promotion des langues nationales&lt;/ref&gt; This superseded the Decree 159 PG-RM of 19 July 1982 (Article 1).

===Education===
French is part of the standard school curriculum. There is a new policy to use Malian languages in the first grades and transition to French.

'''Luis Ángel Sánchez Pereiro''' alias '''Lois Pereiro''' (born [[Monforte de Lemos]], February 16, 1958-died [[A Coruña]], May 24, 1996) was a [[Galician people|Galician]] poet and writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://vieiros.com/nova.php?Ed=1&amp;id=50151 | title=Dez anos da morte de Lois Pereiro | publisher=Vieiros | date=May 25, 2006 | accessdate=April 28, 2011 | language=galician}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Galician Literature Day]] was dedicated to him in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://elprogreso.galiciae.com/nova/56847.html | title=O Día das Letras do 2011 irá dedicado ao poeta monfortino Lois Pereiro | publisher=El Progreso | date=June 26, 2010 | accessdate=April 28, 2011 | language=galician | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517100652/http://elprogreso.galiciae.com/nova/56847.html | archivedate=May 17, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vieiros.com/nova/80123/o-dia-das-letras-2011-estara-adicado-ao-poeta-lois-pereiro |title=O Día das Letras 2011 estará adicado ao poeta Lois Pereiro |publisher=Vieiros |date=June 26, 2010 | accessdate=April 28, 2011 | language=galician}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
He was born in Monforte de Lemos, into a family from [[O Incio]]. He studied in the school of the ''Escolapios'', and began to write at 15 years of age. After finalising the COU (pre-university course) he left for [[Madrid]], where he started his university studies of Political Sciences and Sociology. After a stay in Monforte working in the family company, devoted to the glass industry, he returned to Madrid to study English, French and German. There he founded the magazine ''Loia'' with {{Interlanguage link multi|Antón Patiño Pérez|gl}}, [[Manuel Rivas]] and his brother Xosé Manuel Pereiro.

In 1981 he went to live in [[A Coruña]], where he joined the magazine ''La Naval''. At that time he came into contact with a group of poets: {{Interlanguage link multi|Xavier Seoane|gl}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Francisco Salinas Portugal|gl}} and {{Interlanguage link multi|Xulio López Valcárcel|gl}}, participating in several anthologies such as ''De amor e desamor'' (1984) and ''De amor e desamor II'' (1985), and collaborating in magazines like ''La Naval'', ''Trilateral'', ''Anima+l'' and ''Luzes of Galiza''. He published in 1997, in the magazine ''Luzes of Galiza'', the eight chapters of the short novel ''Náufragos do Paradiso''.

Between 1983 and 1987 he travelled with Fernando Saco in Europe. He worked translating German, French and English for cinema [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] and, especially, in television, dubbing as much conventional series (episodes of ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' and ''[[Kung fu (TV series)|Kung fu]]'') as [[pornographic film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.laopinioncoruna.es/cultura/2011/03/20/vida-conspiracion/478369.html | title=Una vida de conspiración |publisher=La Opinión Coruña| author=Mato, M. | date=March 20, 2011 | accessdate=April 29, 2011|language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.galiciae.com/nova/75333.html | publisher=Galiciaé | title=Unha discográfica de Sarria publica a vida de Lois Pereiro en fotos e sons | date=3/2/2011 | author=Jaureguizar | language=galician | accessdate=April 29, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515040946/http://www.galiciae.com/nova/75333.html | archivedate=May 15, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He only published two collections of poems in his life, ''Poemas 1981/1991'' (1992) and ''Poesía última de amor e enfermidade'' (1995). In 1996, the year of his death, ''Poemas para unha Loia'', came to light which collected together works of his Madrid period, published in the magazine ''Loia'', and included the essay ''Modesta proposición para renunciar a facer xirar a roda hidráulica dunha cíclica historia universal da infamia'', published in the 27th volume of ''Luzes de Galiza''.

With regard to the cause of the death of Pereiro, in spite of suffering AIDS, it was an accumulation of illnesses that finished with [[liver failure]]. Officially and in accordance with a sentence of the Provincial Audience of Lugo, after a lawsuit so that the State paid the burial, the reason of his death was intoxication by [[Toxic oil syndrome|denatured rapeseed oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mundolois.gl/quen-somos | title=Quen somos | publisher=Mundo Lois | accessdate=April 29, 2011 | language=galician | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519144937/http://mundolois.gl/quen-somos | archivedate=May 19, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition ==
Over the years he demanded that [[Galician Literature Day]] be dedicated to him. To this end a new edition of his poetic work was released translated to the Spanish, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Basque language|Basque]], together with the original texts in [[Galician language|Galician]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vieiros.com/nova/74063/todo-o-que-desprezamos-na-literatura-galega-ponemolo-fronte-a-lois-pereiro-para-que-el-o-ataque-rdquo | title=Todo o que desprezamos na literatura galega poñémolo fronte a Lois Pereiro para que el o ataque |publisher=Vieiros |author1=Marcos S.

Finally, on June 26, 2010 the [[Royal Galician Academy]] published its decision to devote [[Galician Literature Day]] 2011 to him. The Academy appreciated:

{{Quote|The evident expressionist traces, references to Germanic literature and certain strokes of counterculture [...] an image and an aesthetic that made him a cult author. Like no-one else he found his way through the contemporary world, combining a sceptical individualism with a devastating tradition of Central European [[Expressionism]].}}

In words of the writer and member of the Royal Galician Academy [[Manuel Rivas]]:

{{Quote|To devote [[Galician Literature Day]] 2011 to Lois was a brave decision by the Academy because he is a cult author, but as soon as his work becomes widespread he will become a very popular author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/Galicia/Dia/das/Letras/Lois/Pereiro/poeta/punk/elpepuespgal/20100627elpgal_1/Tes |title=El Día das Letras, para Lois Pereiro, poeta punk| publisher=El País | author=Obelleiro, P. |date=June 27, 2010| accessdate=April 29, 2011| language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

== Example of his lyric ==
A verse from one of his poems, carved as an [[epitaph]] on his gravestone at Santa Cristina do Viso (O Incio), gives a sample of the rawness and nakedness of his poetry:

{{columns|width=auto
| col1 = &lt;poem&gt;''Cuspídeme enriba cando pasedes por diante do lugar onde eu repouse, enviándome unha húmida mensaxe de vida e de furia necesaria''.&lt;/poem&gt;
| col2 = &lt;poem&gt;Spit on me when you go past of the place where I rest, sending me a humid message of life and of necessary fury.&lt;/poem&gt;

A '''mason's mark''' is a [[symbol]] often found on dressed [[Rock (geology)|stone]] in buildings and other public structures.

==In stonemasonry==
Regulations issued in Scotland in 1598 by [[James VI and I|James VI]]'s Master of Works, [[William Schaw]], stated that on admission to the [[guild]], every [[Masonry|mason]] had to enter his name and his mark in a register.

There are three types of marks used by [[Stonemasonry|stonemasons]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marking Well: Essays on the Occasion of the 150th Anniversary of the Grand Lodge of Mark Master Masons of England and Wales and its Districts and Lodges Overseas|last=Alexander|first=Jennifer|publisher=Lewis Masonic|year=2006|isbn=0853182663|editor-last=Prescott|editor-first=Andrew|location=Hersham|pages=43–5|chapter=A History of Stonemasons' Marks and Stone Bonding Methods}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Banker marks were made on stones before they were sent to be used by the walling masons. These marks served to identify the banker mason who had prepared the stones to their paymaster. This system was employed only when the stone was paid for by measure, rather than by time worked. For example, the 1306 contract between Richard of Stow, mason, and the Dean and Chapter of Lincoln Cathedral, specified that the plain walling would be paid for by measure, and indeed banker marks are found on the blocks of walling in this cathedral. Conversely, the masons responsible for walling the eastern parts of Exeter Cathedral were paid by the week, and consequently few banker marks are found on this part of the cathedral. Banker marks make up the majority of masons' marks, and are generally what are meant when the term is used without further specification.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Assembly marks were used to ensure the correct installation of important pieces of stonework. For example, the stones on the window jambs in the chancel of North Luffenham church in Rutland are each marked with a Roman numeral, directing the order in which the stones were to be installed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Quarry stones were used to identify the source of a stone, or occasionally the quality. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==In Freemasonry==
[[Freemasonry]], a fraternal order that uses an analogy to stonemasonry for much of its structure, also makes use of marks.  A Freemason who takes the degree of [[Order of Mark Master Masons|Mark Master Mason]] will be asked to create his own Mark, as a type of unique signature or identifying badge.  Some of these can be quite elaborate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3043">A '''maximum retail price''' ('''MRP''') is a manufacturer calculated price that is the highest price that can be charged for a product sold in [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fullstopindia.com/mrp-maximum-retail-price/|publisher=fullstopindia|title=MRP: Maximum Retail Price for Packaged Goods in India|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://print.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/2014/11/27/68117/print |title=VAT on commissions for drug sales raised |quote=The NBR policy guidelines say the drug administration will set the maximum retail price of drugs based on the trade price}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, retailers may choose to sell products for less than the MRP. MRP differs from systems using a [[recommended retail price]] because in those systems the price calculated by the manufacturer is only a recommendation, not enforceable by law.

All retail products in India must be marked with MRP. Shops cannot charge customers over the MRP. Some shops may charge slightly below MRP to draw more customers to their stores. In some remote areas, tourist spots, and in situations where a product is difficult to obtain, consumers are often charged illegally over the MRP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/new-law-in-making-to-punish-vendors-charging-over-mrp/|publisher=The Indian Express|title=New law in making to punish vendors charging over MRP|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, it was reported that milk vendors in [[Mumbai]] were threatening a boycott after it was discovered they had been charging above MRP and the [[Maharashtra]] state government threatened to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Milk-vendors-charging-more-than-MRP-threaten-boycott/articleshow/47033402.cms|publisher=Times of India|title=Milk vendors charging more than MRP threaten boycott|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of Maximum Retail Price has been criticised as incompatible with the [[Free market|free market system]], because it involves manufacturers deciding what profit retailers will make.&lt;ref name=thehindumrp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/maximum-retail-price-is-an-archaic-dysfunctional-mechanism/article7452745.ece|title=Time to abolish the MRP|date=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is easy to get around the MRP by charging for 'services' on top of the item price, such as a 'cooling charge' for cold drinks, or by manufacturers setting the MRP at up to ten times the expected sale price. The MRP also hurts consumers in rural areas because if retailers cannot charge a higher price to make up for the higher price of transportation and distribution to those areas, they may simply not stock many items.&lt;ref name=thehindumrp/&gt;

map=Languages of Alpes-Maritimes Department, France.svg|mapsize=250px|mapcaption={{legend|#d40055|Occitan: mentonasc}}|isoexception=dialect }}'''Mentonasc''' ('''Mentonasco'''  in Italian, '''Mentonnais''' or '''Mentonasque''' in French) is a Romance dialect historically spoken in and around [[Menton]], [[France]]. It is classified as a dialect of [[Occitan]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;and a sub-dialect of [[Vivaro-Alpine dialect|Vivaro-Alpine]], with some strong influence from the neighbouring [[Intemelio|Intemelian]] [[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian]] dialect spoken from [[Ventimiglia]] to [[Sanremo|San Remo]].&lt;ref&gt;Dalbéra (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Mentonasc is considered to be a transitional language; it is an intermediate language between [[Occitan language|Occitan]] and [[Ligurian language (ancient)|Ligurian]], which is why the classification of Mentonasc is often debated. However, it is traditionally assigned to the [[Occitan language|Occitan]] language.

The Mentonasc dialect bears strong similarities with the common alpine dialects, such as, [[Royasque]] or [[Pignasque]]. It differs quite significantly especially in the ear from Ligurian coastal dialects [[Northern Italian languages|(Northern Italian)]], like those of [[Ventimiglia]] ([[Intemelio dialect]]) or [[Monaco]].

==History==
When the area of Menton was part of the [[Republic of Genoa]] and later of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], Mentonasc was used in all of the coastal area between Monaco and [[Ventimiglia, Italy|Ventimiglia]], and in the hinterland. [[Image:Frontiere Monaco.gif|thumb|right|250px|Map of the territory of the "Free cities of Menton &amp; Roquebrune in 1848&lt;ref&gt;Ermanno Amicucci. ''Nizza e l'Italia''. Mondadori editore. Milan, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the 19th century Mentonasc was used in the territories of the ''Free Cities of Menton &amp; Roquebrune'', an independent statelet created in connection with the Italian [[Risorgimento]].

When [[France]] annexed the Free Cities in 1861, Mentonasc began its decline, substituted by the [[French language]].

==Geographic distribution==
The Mentonasc dialect is currently spoken by about 10% of the population in [[Menton]], [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin|Roquebrune]], and the surrounding villages ([[Castellar, Alpes-Maritimes|Castellar]], [[Castillon, Alpes-Maritimes|Castillon]], [[Gorbio]], [[Sainte-Agnès, Alpes-Maritimes|Sainte-Agnès]], [[Moulinet, Alpes-Maritimes|Moulinet]] and [[Sospel]]). Now the language is being taught within the [[French educational system]], as a variety of [[Niçard dialect|Niçard]] (i.e. [[Provençal dialect|Provençal]] and [[Occitan language|Occitan]]), so this may change.

===Official status===
No countries currently have Mentonasc as an official language.

'''Mercè Rodoreda i Gurguí''' ({{IPA-ca|məɾˈsɛ ruðuˈɾɛðə}}; 10 October 1908 – 13 April 1983) was a Spanish novelist, who wrote in [[Catalan language|Catalan]].

She has been called the most important Catalan novelist of the postwar period.{{by who?|date=June 2018}} Her novel ''La plaça del diamant'' ('The diamond square', translated as ''[[The Time of the Doves]]'', 1962) has become the most popular Catalan novel to date and has been translated into over 30 languages. Some critics consider it to be one of the best novels published in Spain after the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=García Márquez|first=Gabriel|title=''¿Sabe usted quién era Mercè Rodoreda?''|url=http://elpais.com/diario/1983/05/18/opinion/422056813_850215.html|work=[[El País]]|accessdate=29 March 2014|authorlink=Gabriel García Márquez|language=spanish|date=18 May 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
She was born at 340 ''[[carrer de Balmes, Barcelona]]'', in 1908. Her parents were Andreu Rodoreda, from [[Terrassa]] and Montserrat Gurguí, from [[Maresme]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvcatalunya.com/aleph/rodoreda/cronolog.htm tvcatalunya.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708232433/http://www.tvcatalunya.com/aleph/rodoreda/cronolog.htm |date=July 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents' financial problems prompted her to leave school at age nine. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vosburg |first1=Nancy |editor1-last=Gould Levine |editor1-first=Linda |editor2-last=Engelson Marson |editor2-first=Ellen |editor3-last=Feiman Waldman |editor3-first=Gloria |title=Merce Rodoreda |date=1993 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Connecticut |isbn=9780313268236 |page=413 |edition=1st |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RGcbAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=spanish+women+writers+a+bio+bibliographical+source+book&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjciO7dhP_dAhVJbK0KHZqMDR4Q6AEIJzAA |accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, just 20 years old, she married her uncle Joan Gurguí, 14 years her senior, and in 1929 she had her only child, Jordi. She began her writing career with short stories in magazines, as an escape from her unhappy marriage. She then wrote psychological novels, including ''Aloma'' which won the Crexells Prize, but even with the success this novel enjoyed, Rodoreda decided to remake and republish it some years later since she was not fully satisfied with this period of her life and her works at that time.

At the start of the [[Spanish Civil War]], she worked for the ''[[Generalitat de Catalunya]]'', the autonomous Government of Catalonia.

She was exiled in France and later Switzerland, where in 1957 she broke her silence with the publication of her book ''Twenty-Two short stories'', which earned her the Víctor Català Prize. With ''Camelia Street'' (''El Carrer de les Camèlies'') (1966) she won several prizes. In the 1970s, she returned to [[Romanyà de la Selva]] in [[Catalonia]] and finished the novel ''Mirall trencat'' (Broken Mirror) in 1974.

Amongst other works came ''Viatges i flors'' (Travels and flowers) and ''Quanta, quanta guerra'' (How much War) in 1980, which was also the year in which she won the ''[[Premi d'Honor de les Lletres Catalanes]]''. During the last period of her lifetime, her works developed from her usual psychologic style to become more akin to [[symbol]]ism in its more cryptic form.

In 1998 a literature prize was instituted in her name: the Mercè Rodoreda prize for short stories and narratives.

She was made a Member of Honour of the ''[[Associació d'Escriptors en Llengua Catalana]]'',  the Association of Writers in Catalan Language. The library in [[Platja d'Aro]] is named in her honor.

She died in [[Girona]] of [[liver cancer]], and was [[burial|interred]] in the [[cemetery]] of Romanyà.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.es/preview/1983/04/16/pagina-25/32965515/pdf.html Article in ''[[La Vanguardia]]'' of 1983/04/16]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Broader|Earthquake engineering}}
'''Mitigation of seismic motion''' is an important factor in [[earthquake engineering]] and [[construction]] in [[earthquake]]-prone areas. The destabilizing action of an earthquake on constructions may be direct (seismic motion of the ground) or indirect (earthquake-induced [[landslide]]s, [[soil liquefaction|liquefaction of the foundation soils]] and waves of [[tsunami]]).

Knowledge of local [[Amplifier|amplification]] of the seismic motion from the bedrock is very important in order to choose the suitable design solutions.  Local amplification can be anticipated from the presence of particular  stratigraphic conditions, such as soft soil overlapping the [[bedrock]], or where morphological settings (e.g. crest zones, steep slopes, valleys, or endorheic basins) may produce focalization of the seismic event.

The identification of the areas potentially affected by earthquake-induced [[landslides]] and by [[soil liquefaction]] can be made by geological survey and by analysis of historical documents.  Even quiescent and stabilized landslide areas may be reactivated by severe earthquake.&lt;ref name=Reitherman&gt;{{cite book|last=Reitherman|first=Robert|title=Earthquakes and Engineers: An International History|year=2012|publisher=ASCE Press|location=Reston, VA|isbn=9780784410714|url=http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147487208&amp;productid=154097877|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726183407/http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147487208&amp;productid=154097877|archivedate=2012-07-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Young soil may be particularly susceptible to liquefaction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2966">A '''noun string''' is a term for a series of nouns or other words, all of which modify the '''final noun'''. For example, in the noun string “U.S. energy consumption” the nouns "U.S." and "energy" modify the final noun "consumption." Noun strings are frequently used in technical writing but appear in other general business contexts as well.

== As a usage problem ==
Since connecting elements such as prepositions or apostrophes are omitted from noun strings, readers must infer the relationship between the words. If the string is fairly short and the reader is already familiar with the field, he or she will probably be able to interpret a noun string without too much difficulty. When strings become longer than three words, they can make readers labor. This is particularly true when the reader is not already familiar with the subject or technical domain. 

Because of this problem, overly long noun strings are increasingly recognized as a problem in technical and business writing. For instance, a noun string like "Municipal Solid Waste Classification Methodology" &lt;!--"municipal" is an adjective--&gt; though not incomprehensible, is at least irritating to most readers.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} According to Burnett,&lt;ref name="BurnettRebecca"&gt;Burnett, Rebecca (2001). ''Technical Communication'', p. 450. Harcourt, Fort Worth. {{LCCN|00106794}}.&lt;/ref&gt; strings of five words or more are open to several different interpretations and can be indecipherable. Because of these problems, most guides to technical writing advise writers to either limit the length of nouns strings or to avoid them altogether.

== Fixing problems with noun strings ==
To make long noun strings easier to understand, hyphenation can often help, as can using prepositions to show the relationship between the words, and converting the noun that hides the key action to a verb. Often, the string can be shortened by removing unnecessary words as well. Here are several examples:

'''Peretz Hirshbein''' (7 November 1880, Melnik, [[Kleszczele]], [[Grodno Governorate]] &amp;ndash; 16 August 1948, [[Los Angeles]]) was a [[Yiddish language|Yiddish-language]] playwright, novelist, journalist, travel writer, and theater director.  Because his work focused more on mood than plot, he became known as "the Yiddish [[Maurice Maeterlinck|Maeterlinck]]". His work as a playwright and through his own short-lived but influential troupe, laid much of the groundwork for the second golden age of Yiddish theater that began shortly after the end of [[World War I]].  The dialogue of his plays is consistently vivid, terse, and naturalistic. Unusually for a Yiddish playwright, most of his works have pastoral settings: he had grown up the son of a miller, and made several attempts at farming.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Grodno Governorate]] (present-day [[Podlaskie Voivodeship]], [[Poland]]) where he was educated initially by local tutors, before he eventually made his way to Grodno and then [[Vilna]], where he joined a circle of yeshiva students who studied the Bible, Hebrew grammar, and Jewish history together. Hirshbein began giving Hebrew lessons to support himself while publishing Hebrew poetry and writing Yiddish stories. He also began to shift from writing lyrical poetry to naturalist drama, starting with ''Miryam'' (1905), which he first wrote in Hebrew, later translated into Yiddish, and later still revised in Yiddish under the title ''Barg arop'' (Downhill).  During the early 1900s, Hirshbein continued writing naturalist dramas in Hebrew, including ''Nevelah'' (Carcass), which in Yiddish (''Di neveyle'') became one of Hirshbein's most successful works. ''Olamot bodedim'' (Lonely Worlds; 1906) marked a new symbolist phase in his career, as well as the end of his practice of writing originally in Hebrew. His symbolist Yiddish plays of this period include the one-act ''Kvorim-blumen'' (Grave Blossoms), ''Di erd'' (The Earth), ''In der finster'' (In the Dark), and ''Der tkies-kaf'' (The Handshake).  He was instrumental in the revival of [[Yiddish theater]] in [[Russia]] shortly after the 1904 lifting of the 1883 ban on theatrical performances in that language. Prior to his involvement in Yiddish theater, he wrote several plays in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]; these were published in the periodical ''[[Hazman]]'', but there was no audience at that time for Hebrew-language theater.

In 1908 Hirshbein moved to [[Odessa]], where he wrote the drama ''Yoyel'' (Joel). Soon afterward, ''Af yener zayt taykh'' (On the Other Side of the River), his first Yiddish drama, was produced in Russian in Odessa. In autumn of the same year, Hirshbein, encouraged by [[Bialik]] and by students from an acting conservatory in Odessa, founded the theater company that became known as the Hirshbein Troupe. It was the first Yiddish company to devote itself exclusively to "better" Yiddish theater. The troupe toured through [[Imperial Russia]] for two years, staging his own plays, as well as works by [[Sholem Asch]], [[David Pinski]], [[Sholem Aleichem]], and [[Jacob Gordin]], as well as translations of plays by [[Semyon Yushkevich|Semen Iushkevich]] and [[Herman Heijermans]].  The troupe's high literary standards and high standards of ensemble acting strongly influenced the later [[Vilna Troupe]] and [[Maurice Schwartz]]'s [[New York City|New York]]-based [[Yiddish Art Theater]].

[[File:Di Chaliastre Mendel Elkin Perec Hirszbajn Uri Cwi Grinberg Perec Markisz Melech Rawicz Izrael Jehoszua Singer 1922.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Peretz Hirschbein (second from left), with Mendl Elkin, [[Uri Zvi Greenberg]], [[Peretz Markish]], [[Melech Ravitch]] and [[Israel Joshua Singer|I. J. Singer]] in 1922.]]
The troupe disbanded in 1910 for financial reasons, at which point Hirschbein published what Jacob Glatshteyn (''In tokh genumen'' [Sum and Substance], 1976, p.&amp;nbsp;77) has called "the four greatest plays in the Yiddish repertoire": ''A farvorfn vinkl'' (A Forsaken Corner; 1912), ''Di puste kretshme'' (The Empty [Deserted] Inn; 1913, written in America), ''Dem shmids tekhter'' (The Blacksmith's Daughters; 1918) and ''Grine felder'' (Green Fields; 1916). In these and other dramas, Hirshbein abandoned symbolism and returned to his rural roots, dramatizing the lives and loves of rural Jews. The understated quality of these works appealed to directors including [[Maurice Schwartz]] and [[Jacob Ben-Ami]], and they became regular productions in the repertoire of artistically ambitious Yiddish theaters.  His popularity extended to other cultures and genres, and his plays were performed in Russian, Hebrew, English, German, Spanish, and French. Indeed, the 1937 American film ''[[Green Fields (film)|Grine felder]]'' (Green Fields), based on Hirshbein's play, is among the most beloved of all Yiddish films, and the play continues to be often anthologized and staged.

Hirshbein traveled extensively; in 1911 alone, he visited [[Vienna]], [[Paris]], [[London]], and [[New York City]]. For a while in 1912, he tried farming in [[New York State|New York]]'s [[Catskills]] (later, home to the [[Borscht Belt]]); he then returned briefly to Russia, and went from there to [[Argentina]] for another attempt at farming, this time in a Jewish agricultural colony. At the start of [[World War I]] he was ''en route'' to New York on a [[United Kingdom|British]] ship, which was sunk by a [[Germany|German]] cruiser. He was briefly taken captive, then let off in [[Brazil]], from where he eventually reached New York.  He spent the succeeding decades traveling, accompanied by his wife, Yiddish poet [[Esther Shumiatcher-Hirschbein]], and publishing both fiction and nonfiction based on his trips.

Hirschbein's son, Omus Hirschbein, a classical music administrator, was born in New York in 1934 just before the family moved to Los Angeles.  Hirschbein suffered from [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (Lou Gehrig's Disease) for the last three years of his life. He died August 16, 1948 in Los Angeles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28272">'''Proto-Algonquian''' (commonly abbreviated '''PA''') is the [[proto-language]] from which the various [[Algonquian languages]] are descended. It is generally estimated to have been spoken around 2,500 to 3,000 years ago,{{sfn|Goddard|1978|p=587}} but on the question of where it was spoken, there is less agreement. The Algonquian family, which is a branch of the larger [[Algic languages|Algic language family]], is usually divided into three subgroups: [[Eastern Algonquian languages|Eastern Algonquian]], which is a [[historical linguistics|genetic]] subgroup, and [[Central Algonquian languages|Central Algonquian]] and [[Plains Algonquian languages|Plains Algonquian]], both of which are [[Sprachbund|areal]] groupings. In the historical linguistics of North America, Proto-Algonquian is one of the best studied, most thoroughly reconstructed proto-languages.{{sfn|Campbell|2004|p=185}}{{sfn|Goddard|1979|p=70}} It is descended from [[Proto-Algic]].

==History of research==
Most Algonquian languages are similar enough that their relatedness has been recognized for centuries and was commented on by the early English and French colonists and explorers. For example, in 1787 (over a decade before [[William Jones (philologist)#Scholarly contributions|Sir William Jones' famous speech]] on Indo-European), the theologian and linguist [[Jonathan Edwards (the younger)|Jonathan Edwards Jr.]] deduced that the Algonquian languages of the eastern and central United States were "radically the same" ('radically' meaning having a common 'root', since ''radix'' is Latin for 'root'), and contrasted them with the neighboring [[Iroquoian languages]].{{sfn|Campbell|1997|pp=29-30}} The earliest work on reconstructing the Algonquian proto-language was undertaken by the linguists [[Truman Michelson]] and [[Leonard Bloomfield]]. In 1925 Bloomfield reconstructed what he called "Primitive Central Algonquian", using what were at the time the four best-attested Algonquian languages: [[Fox language|Fox]], [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]], [[Menominee language|Menominee]], and [[Plains Cree language|Plains Cree]].{{sfn|Thomason|2006|pp=190-191}} Following his initial reconstructions, investigations of other languages revealed that his "Primitive Central Algonquian" was essentially equivalent to Proto-Algonquian.{{sfn|Bloomfield|1946|pp=85-86}} Bloomfield wrote a refinement and expansion of his reconstruction in 1946, and his two papers remain the starting point for all research and reconstructions of Proto-Algonquian.{{sfn|Thomason|2006|pp=190-191}}{{sfn|Goddard|1979|p=70-71}} In the years since there has been an enormous amount of comparative work undertaken on the Algonquian family.{{sfn|Goddard|1990|p=99}}

==Urheimat==
There remains some disagreement over the Algonquian ''[[Urheimat]]'' (homeland of the protolanguage). The initial theory, first put forth by [[Frank T. Siebert, Jr.]] in 1967 based on examining of the ranges of numerous species of plants and animals for which reliable Algonquian [[cognate]]s existed, holds that Proto-Algonquian was spoken between [[Georgian Bay, Ontario|Georgian Bay]] and [[Lake Ontario]], in [[Ontario]], Canada, and at least as far south as [[Niagara Falls]]. Research a generation later suggests that in fact it was spoken farther west than this, perhaps "somewhere immediately west of [[Lake Superior]]."{{sfn|Goddard|1994|p=207}}

==Phonology==
===Vowels===
Proto-Algonquian had four basic vowels, ''*i'', ''*e'', ''*a'', ''*o'', each of which had a [[Vowel length|long]] counterpart (commonly written ''*i·'', ''*e·'', ''*a·'', ''*o·''), for a total of eight vowels. The same inventory of eight vowels was found in Proto-Algic, but Proto-Algonquian did not inherit its inventory directly from Proto-Algic. Rather, several sound changes left pre-Proto-Algonquian without short *''i'' and *''o''.&lt;ref name="Proulx 2004 vowels"&gt;Paul Proulx, ''Proto-Algic VI: Conditioned Yurok reflexes of Proto-Algic vowels'', ''Kansas Working Papers in Linguistics'' 27:124–138 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear that they had redeveloped by the time of Proto-Algonquian. All instances in which Bloomfield reconstructed ''*o'' can now be reconstructed as ''*we'' based on evidence from some of the Eastern languages (for example, Bloomfield's ''*nekotwi'' "one" is now reconstructed as ''*nekwetwi'' based on forms like [[Munsee language|Munsee]] ''nkwúti'').{{sfn|Goddard|1979|p=75}} There are still a handful of instances where ''*o'' can be reconstructed, usually as the result of a [[Morphophonology|morphophonological]] process of vowel shortening. Goddard concludes that "an independent phoneme ''*o'' is of no great antiquity in Proto-Algonquian",{{sfn|Goddard|1979|p=75}} but recommends continuing to use it in reconstructions. Likewise, Berman states that "PA ''*i'' is probably also of recent origin", derived from earlier (pre-Proto-Algonquian) ''*ye'' sequences and morphophonological shortening.{{sfn|Berman|1982|p=414}}

===Consonants===
Proto-Algonquian had a smaller number of consonants than Proto-Algic. The reconstructed consonants are as follows (given in the [[Americanist phonetic notation]] common in the literature):{{sfn|Thomason|2006|p=191}}

The phoneme given in the table as ⟨r⟩ was reconstructed by Bloomfield as ''*l'', but Goddard has more recently argued that it should be reconstructed as ''*r'', largely because the earliest attestations of the majority of languages show some sort of rhotic as its reflex, which in many languages subsequently changed to a lateral within the historical period.{{sfn|Goddard|1994|p=204-205}} The precise pronunciation of the phoneme written ⟨θ⟩ is unknown. It has merged with the reflex of ''*r'' in all Algonquian languages except for [[Cree language|Cree]] and the [[Arapahoan languages]].{{sfn|Bloomfield|1946|p=87}}{{sfn|Pentland|2006|p=163}} [[Leonard Bloomfield]] originally suggested that it could have been either an [[interdental]] fricative or a [[Voiceless lateral fricative|lateral fricative]]. One piece of evidence for the interdental fricative is that this is the reflex it has in Arapaho.{{sfn|Goddard|1994|p=204-205}} However, other researchers have argued for its reconstruction as a lateral fricative, {{IPA|*/ɬ/}}, in part because of the aforementioned merger in most languages with the phoneme traditionally reconstructed as ''*l''.{{sfn|Picard|1984|p=}}

As with ''*i'' and ''*o'', it is unclear whether ''*č'' was an independent phoneme in Proto-Algonquian. Almost all instances where ''*č'' is reconstructed are before ''*i'', ''*i·'', or ''*y'', where it does not contrast with ''*t'' (see below), or are cases of diminutive consonant symbolism.{{sfn|Pentland|2006|p=163}} However, Goddard recommends continuing to write it in reconstructions, since it seems to have been present in the clusters ''*čp'' and ''*čk''; since it can be reconstructed before ''*a'' in the term ''*čapo·nk-'' "splash"; and since ''*t'' does appear before ''*i·'' in some reconstructions of the onomatopoeic noun ''ti·nti·wa'' "blue jay" (however, see [[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Algonquian/ti·nti·wa|Wiktionary]] for more).{{sfn|Goddard|1979|pp=73-74}}

===Clusters===
Reconstruction of the consonant clusters has been relatively difficult, and the paths the clusters take in their evolutions to the daughter languages have been complex. The current view is that the permissible consonant clusters were (first member on the left, second member across the top):{{sfn|Thomason|2006|p=191}}

In several cases the actual phonetic identity of the first member of the clusters was unknown, and Bloomfield's choice of symbols to represent them was purely arbitrary.{{sfn|Bloomfield|1946|p=88}} Thus, ⟨x⟩ does not represent *[x], ⟨ç⟩ does not represent *[ç], and ⟨ʔ⟩ does not necessarily represent *[{{IPA|ʔ}}]. Goddard argues that Bloomfield's arbitrary symbol ⟨x⟩ be reconstructed as ''*s'', and Bloomfield's ⟨ç⟩ be reconstructed as ''*r''.{{sfn|Goddard|1994b|pp=205-206}} While a glottal stop phoneme is not otherwise reconstructed, given that Bloomfield's ⟨ʔ⟩ in clusters seems to represent the neutralization of ''*p'' and ''*k'' and its realization in Menominee and Cheyenne is a glottal stop, it probably was indeed phonetically {{IPA|[ʔ]}}.{{sfn|Goddard|1979|pp=77-78}}{{sfn|Thomason|2006|p=191}} The cluster written ⟨Hm⟩ shows up as ''p'' or ''m'' in most of the daughter languages, but as ''hm'' in [[Munsee language|Munsee]] (for example, PA ''*wi·kiwa·Hmi'' "house" becomes Ojibwe ''wiigiwaam'', Fox ''wîkiyâpi'', and Munsee ''wíikwahm'').{{sfn|Goddard|1967|p=87}}{{sfn|Goddard|1974b|pp=326-327}} The first member of the cluster may have been either *h or {{IPA|*ʔ}}.{{sfn|Goddard|1974b|pp=322}}

The clusters ''*št'' and ''*hr'' are each reconstructed on the basis of only a single correspondence set (''*št'' in ''*weštikwa·ni'', "his/her head"; and ''*hr'' in ''*re·hre·wa'', "s/he breathes"){{sfn|Goddard|1979|pp=71-72}}{{sfn|Pentland|1977|p=}} and may not have been part of Proto-Algonquian. David Pentland, for example, argued that Ojibwe ''oshtigwaan'', claimed as the only form requiring the reconstruction of ''*št'', is a borrowing from Cree.{{sfn|Pentland|1977|p=}} However, evidence from Munsee and [[Blackfoot language|Blackfoot]] seem to also point toward ''*št'' as a valid separate cluster in PA (Munsee ''wìilùshtíikan'', Blackfoot ''mo’tokááni'', "head, hair").{{sfn|Goddard|1979|p=107}}{{sfn|Berman|2006|p=282}}

Finally, all consonants and consonant clusters could be followed by ''*w'' or ''*y'' (although the sequences ''*čw'' and ''*hy'' did not occur; and ''*t'' and ''*θ'' were regularly replaced before ''*y'', for which see below).{{sfn|Goddard|1979|p=72}}

===Phonological processes===
Several [[Allophone|allophonic]] processes, [[Morphophonology|morphophonemic]] processes, and [[Phonotactics|phonological constraints]] can be reconstructed. Among the most significant of these processes was that ''*t'' and ''*θ'' became ''*č'' and ''*š'' respectively before ''*i'', ''*i·'', and ''*y''.{{sfn|Bloomfield|1946|p=92}} For example, the initial ''*went-'' "from there" (as in ''*wentenamwa'' "s/he takes it from there") is realized as ''*wenč-'' in the word ''*wenči·wa'' "s/he comes from there", since it precedes ''*i·''.{{sfn|Bloomfield|1946|pp=86, 89, 92}}

There were several restrictions on phonotactics and the shape of the PA word that can be reconstructed. All words began with a single consonant (other than ''*h'') or vowel, or with a consonant plus ''*w'' or ''*y''; there were no sequences of consecutive vowels; and the word always ended in a short vowel. The vowels ''*i'' and ''*o'' never occurred in initial syllables.{{sfn|Goddard|1979|p=72}} A sequence of consonant+semivowel could not be followed by ''*o'' or ''*o·''.{{sfn|Goddard|1974a|p=}} There was also a restriction which prevented two-syllable nouns from ending in a sequence of short vowel + consonant + short vowel.{{sfn|Berman|1992|p=}}

In most cases, when the pronominal prefixes ''*ne-'' (first person), ''*ke-'' (second person), and ''*we-'' (third person) were added to a vowel-initial stem, an [[Epenthesis|epenthetic]] ''*-t-'' was inserted between the prefix and the stem. Thus, the prefixes became ''*net-'', ''*ket-'', and ''*wet-'' respectively.{{sfn|Bloomfield|1946|p=95}} For example, ''*ne-'' + ''*-ehkwa-'' = ''*netehkwa-'' "my louse". This feature goes back to [[Proto-Algic]] (compare [[Wiyot language|Wiyot]] ''du-'' + ''híkw'' = ''dutíkw'' "my louse").{{sfn|Campbell|Poser|2008|p=178}} There were a handful of irregular exceptions to this pattern, however. For example, the prefixes lost their vowels before several kinship terms, as in ''*ne-'' + ''*-o·hkomehsa'' = ''*no·hkomehsa'' "my grandmother."{{sfn|Bloomfield|1946|pp=91, 96}}

[[File:Algic langs.png|thumb|360px|Approximate distribution of the Algonquian languages when first encountered by Europeans]]
Several rules for [[Sandhi|internal sandhi]] in morpheme combinations can be reconstructed. The most basic was the insertion of a "connective i" between two consonants. For example, ''*po·n-'' "cease" + ''*-m'' "act by speech on an animate object" = ''*po·n'''i'''me·wa'' "s/he stops talking to him/her." {{sfn|Bloomfield|1946|pp=90-91}}{{sfn|Thomason|2006|p=192}} In a few idiosyncratic cases, however, this rule did not operate, and instead the consonants were changed in various ways. For instance, the combination ''θ+p'' produced when the root ''*eθ-'' "thither, thus" was added to the final ''*-pahto·'' "run" simplified to ''*xp'': ''*expahta·wa'' "s/he runs thither." One regular exception to the "connective i" rule was when the conjunct suffix ''*-ki'' was added to a verb stem ending in a consonant, for example ''*ki·šekat-'' "be day" + ''*-ki'' = ''*ki·šekaxki'' "when it is day." {{sfn|Bloomfield|1946|p=91}} Note that Bloomfield here actually reconstructed this word as ''*ki·šekaθki'', but evidence from other Algonquian languages has shown that the cluster should be reconstructed as ''*xk''.{{sfn|Proulx|1984a|p=168, note 2}} When two vowels became contiguous, if one was a long vowel and one was short, the short vowel dropped: ''*naka·-'' "stop" + ''*-en'' "by hand" = ''*naka·ne·wa'' "s/he stops him/her by hand." If both were long, an epenthetic ''*y'' was inserted between the two.{{sfn|Bloomfield|1946|p=93}}

==Grammar==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2011}}
Proto-Algonquian nouns had an [[Animacy|animate/inanimate]] contrast: nouns representing animate beings (and some traditional items viewed as having spiritual powers) were classed as ''animate'', while all other nouns were ''inanimate''. The plural marker differed in form depending on whether the noun was animate or inanimate: animate nouns took a plural suffix ''*-aki'', while inanimate nouns took a plural suffix ''*-ari''. Another important distinction involved the contrast between nouns marked as ''proximate'' and those marked as ''[[obviative]]''. Proximate nouns were those deemed most central or important to the discourse, while obviative nouns were those less important to the discourse. When two third person participants appeared in a sentence, one was marked as proximate and the other as obviative, in order to distinguish which one was the subject and which was the object (since verbs inflected for whether they had a proximate or obviative subject and a proximate or obviative object).  In a given stretch of discourse, there will not be two proximate or two obviative participants.{{sfn|Hockett|1966|p=60}}

There were personal pronouns which distinguished three persons, two numbers (singular and plural), [[Clusivity|inclusive and exclusive first person plural]], and proximate and obviative third persons. Demonstrative pronouns have been more difficult to reconstruct, as many of the daughter languages have innovated a great deal.

PA had four classes of verbs: [[Transitive verb|transitive]] verbs with an animate object (abbreviated TA), transitive verbs with an inanimate object (TI), [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]] verbs with an animate subject (AI), and intransitive verbs with an inanimate subject (II). Transitive verbs had two paradigms, termed ''objective'' and ''absolute''. Objective verbs were used when the object of the verb was not present as an overt noun elsewhere in the sentence, while absolute verbs were used when the object of the verb ''was'' marked with an overt noun in the sentence. Objective verbs could also be used when an object was present, and in such cases indicated that the object was [[Definiteness|definite]], as opposed to indefinite.&lt;ref&gt;The verb system is surveyed by Hockett (1966) with particular reference to [[Potawatomi]];  see also Teeter (1965) and Weggelaar (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1490">In [[theoretical computer science]] and [[formal language theory]], a '''ranked alphabet''' is a pair of an [[Alphabet (computer science)|ordinary alphabet]] ''F'' and a function ''Arity'': ''F''→ℕ. Each letter in ''F'' has its [[arity]] so it can be used to build [[Term (logic)|terms]]. Nullary elements (of zero arity) are also called '''constants'''. Terms built with unary symbols and constants can be considered as [[string (computer science)|strings]]. Higher arities lead to proper [[Tree (automata theory)|trees]].

For instance, in the term 
:&lt;math&gt;f(a,g(a),f(a,b,c))&lt;/math&gt;,
''a,b,c'' are constants, ''g'' is unary, and ''f'' is ternary.

Contrariwise,  
:&lt;math&gt;f(a,f(a))&lt;/math&gt;
cannot be a valid term, as the symbol ''f'' appears once as binary, and once as unary, which is illicit, as ''Arity'' must be a function.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9759">A '''release print''' is a copy of a [[film]] that is provided to a [[movie theater]] for exhibition.

==Definitions==
Release prints are not to be confused with other types of print used in the photochemical post-production process:

* '''[[Dailies|Rush prints]]''' are one-light, contact-printed copies made from an unedited roll of [[original camera negative]] immediately after [[Film laboratory|processing]] and screened to the cast and crew in order to ensure that the takes can be used in the final film.
* '''[[Workprint]]s''', sometimes called cutting copies, are, like rush prints, copies of a camera negative roll.  They are used for editing before the negative itself is [[Negative cutting|conformed]], or cut to match the edited workprint.
* An '''[[answer print]]''' is made either from the cut camera negative or an [[interpositive]], depending on the production workflow, in order to verify that the [[Color grading|grading]] ("timing" in US English) conforms to specifications, so that final adjustments can be made before the main batch of release prints is made.
* A '''Showprint''' is a very high quality projection print made for screening at special events such as gala premieres.  It is usually printed directly from the composited camera negative, with each shot individually timed as a duplicate intermediate element would normally be, onto a higher quality of print stock than is usual for mass-production release prints (e.g. Eastman 2393 for showprints, and the standard 2383 for mass-production release prints).  As a showprint is at least two generations closer to the composited camera negative than a typical release print, the definition and saturation in the projected image is significantly higher.  Showprints have been colloquially referred to as "EKs" (for Eastman Kodak), since "Showprint" is a tradename of DeLuxe, although it is not a registered trademark.

==Workflow==

===Photochemical===
In the traditional photochemical post-production workflow, release prints are usually copies, made using a high-speed continuous contact printer, of an [[internegative]] (sometimes referred to as a 'dupe negative'), which in turn is a copy of an [[interpositive]] (these were sometimes referred to as 'lavender prints' in the past), which in turn is a copy, [[Optical printer|optically printed]] to incorporate special effects, fades, etc., from the cut camera negative.  In short, a typical release print is three generations removed from the cut camera negative.

===Digital intermediate===
The post-production of many feature films is now carried out using a [[digital intermediate]] workflow, in which the uncut camera negative is [[film scanner|scanned]], editing and other post-production functions are carried out using computers, and an internegative is [[film recorder|burnt out]] to film, from which the release prints are struck in the normal way.  This procedure eliminates at least one generation of analogue duplication and usually results in a significantly higher quality of release prints.  It has the further advantage that a [[Digital Cinema Package]] can be produced as the final output in addition to or instead of film prints, meaning that a single post-production workflow can produce all the required distribution media.

==Release print stocks==
As of March 2015, [[Eastman Kodak]] is the only remaining manufacturer of colour release print [[film stock|stock]] in the world.  Along with Kodak, [[ORWO]] of Germany also sells black-and-white print stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmotec.de/?cat=26&amp;lang=en&amp;lang=en |title=OrWo Positive Print Film PF-2; |accessdate=2013-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other manufacturers, principally [[DuPont]] of the United States, [[Fujifilm]] of Japan (the penultimate company to discontinue colour print stock&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fujifilm.com/news/n120913.html |title=Announcement on Motion Picture Film Business of Fujifilm; |date=2012-09-13 |accessdate=2013-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127083551/http://www.fujifilm.com/news/n120913.html |archivedate=2013-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Agfa-Gevaert#Agfa photographic products|Agfa-Gevaert]] of Germany, [[Ilford Photo|Ilford]] of the United Kingdom and [[Tasma]] of the Soviet Union competed with Kodak in the print stock market throughout most of the twentieth century.

The person operating the printer on which the release print is struck must take several factors into consideration in order to achieve accurate color.  These include the stock manufacturer, the color temperature of the bulbs in the printer, and the various color filters which may have been introduced during initial filming or subsequent generation of duplicates.

==Theatrical projection==
At the theater, release prints are projected through an [[Movie projector#Imaging lens and aperture plate|aperture plate]], placed between the film and the projector's light source.  The aperture plate in combination with a prime lens of the appropriate focal distance determines which areas of the frame are magnified and projected and which are masked out, according to the [[Aspect ratio (image)#Previous and presently used aspect ratios|aspect ratio]] in which the film is intended to be projected.  Sometimes a [[Hard matte#Mattes and widescreen filming|hard matte]] is used in printing to ensure that only the area of the frame shot in the camera that is intended to be projected is actually present on the release print.  Some theaters have also used aperture plates that mask away part of the frame area that ''is'' supposed to be projected, usually where the screen is too small to accommodate a wider ratio and does not have a masking system in front of the screen itself.  The audience may be confused when significant action appears on the masked-off edges of the picture. Director [[Brad Bird]] expressed frustration at this practice, which some theaters applied to his film ''[[The Incredibles]]''[https://web.archive.org/web/20110716050126/http://sfist.com/2005/04/27/sfiff_brad_birds_state_of_cinema_address.php].

==Production and disposal==
{{refimprove|section|date=June 2016}}
Release prints are generally expensive. For example, in the United States, it is not unusual for each one to cost around $1,500 to print and ship to theaters around the country.  The cost of a release print is determined primarily by its length, the type of print stock used and the number of prints being struck in a given run.  Laser subtitling release prints of foreign language films adds significantly to the cost per print.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Ivarsson]] and Mary Carroll, ''Subtitling'', Simrishamn, 1998, pp. 33-37.&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the fear of piracy, [[film distributor|distributors]] try to ensure that prints are returned and destroyed after the movie's theatrical run is complete.&lt;ref&gt;Kerry Segrave, ''Piracy in the Motion Picture Industry'', Jefferson, NC, McFarland (2003), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, small numbers of release prints do end up in the hands of private collectors, usually entering this market via [[projectionist]]s, who simply retain their prints at the end of the run and do not return them.  A significant number of films have been [[film preservation|preserved]] this way, via prints eventually being donated to film archives and preservation masters printed from them.  The polyester film base is often recycled. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

EKs (showprints) are even more expensive as they are almost completely made by hand and to much higher quality standards.  Perhaps only five EKs will be made of a widely distributed feature, compared to thousands of standard prints.  They are intended primarily for first-run and [[Oscars|Academy]]-consideration theatrical runs in Los Angeles and New York City.  This accounts for two of the typically five produced.  Two EKs are usually reserved for the film's producer.  The remaining EK is usually archived by the film's distributor.

Conventional release prints, which are made from timed internegatives, usually contain black motor and changeover cue marks as the printing internegatives are "punched" and "inked" for this specific purpose.  Showprints, being made from the composited camera negatives, which are never "punched" or "inked", have white motor and changeover cue marks as these marks are punched (or scribed) directly on the prints by hand, in the lab.

The weight of the film stock, steel reels and shipping containers make the cost of shipping significant, and is a major reason why the format has been in decline since the early 1990s.

Russian belongs to the family of [[Indo-European languages]], one of the four living members of the East Slavic languages, and part of the larger [[Balto-Slavic language|Balto-Slavic]] branch. Written examples of [[Old East Slavic|Old East Slavonic]] are attested from the 10th century onward.

It is the most widely spoken of the Slavic languages and the largest [[native language]] in Europe, with 144 million speakers in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. Russian is the eighth most spoken language in the world [[List of languages by number of native speakers|by number of native speakers]] and the seventh [[List of languages by total number of speakers|by total number of speakers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World's Most Widely Spoken Languages |url=http://www2.ignatius.edu/faculty/turner/languages.htm |work=Saint Ignatius High School |access-date=17 February 2012 |location=Cleveland, Ohio |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927062910/http://www2.ignatius.edu/faculty/turner/languages.htm |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The language is one of the [[Official languages of the United Nations|six official languages]] of the [[United Nations]]. Russian is also the third most widespread language on the [[Languages used on the Internet|Internet]] after [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_language/all Usage Statistics and Market Share of Content Languages for Websites, August 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian distinguishes between [[consonant]] [[phoneme]]s with [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatal]] [[secondary articulation]] and those without, the so-called ''soft'' and ''hard'' sounds. Almost every consonant has a hard or a soft counterpart, and the distinction is a prominent feature of the language. Another important aspect is the [[vowel reduction|reduction]] of [[stress (linguistics)|unstressed]] [[vowel]]s. Stress, which is unpredictable, is not normally indicated [[Orthography|orthographically]]{{sfn|Timberlake|2004|p=17}} though an optional [[acute accent]] may be used to mark [[stress (linguistics)|stress]], such as to distinguish between [[homograph]]ic words, for example [[:ru:Замок (устройство)|замо́к]] (zamók, meaning ''a lock'') and [[:ru:Замок (строение)|за́мок]] (zámok, meaning ''a castle''), or to indicate the proper pronunciation of uncommon words or names.

== Classification ==

Russian is an [[East Slavic language]] of the wider [[Indo-European Languages|Indo-European family]]. It is a lineal{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} descendant of the language used in [[Kievan Rus']], a loose conglomerate of [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] tribes from the late 9th to the mid 13th centuries. From the point of view of [[spoken language]], its closest relatives are [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], and [[Rusyn language|Rusyn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Most similar languages to Russian | url=http://www.ezglot.com/most-similar-languages.php?l=rus | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525141518/http://www.ezglot.com/most-similar-languages.php?l=rus | archivedate=2017-05-25 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the other three languages in the East Slavic languages. In many places in eastern and southern [[Ukraine]] and throughout [[Belarus]], these languages are spoken interchangeably, and in certain areas traditional bilingualism resulted in language mixtures such as [[Surzhyk]] in eastern Ukraine and [[Trasianka]] in [[Belarus]]. An East Slavic [[Old Novgorod dialect]], although vanished during the 15th or 16th century, is sometimes considered to have played a significant role in the formation of modern Russian. Also Russian has notable lexical similarities with Bulgarian due to a common [[Church Slavonic]] influence on both languages, as well as because of later interaction in the 19th and 20th centuries, although Bulgarian grammar differs markedly from Russian.{{sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=477–478, 480}} In the 19th century (in Russia until 1917), the language was often called "[[Great Russian language|Great Russian]]" to distinguish it from Belarusian, then called "White Russian" and Ukrainian, then called "Little Russian".

The [[vocabulary]] (mainly abstract and literary words), principles of word formations, and, to some extent, inflections and literary style of Russian have been also influenced by [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]], a developed and partly russified form of the [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] [[Old Church Slavonic]] language used by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. However, the East Slavic forms have tended to be used exclusively in the various dialects that are experiencing a rapid decline. In some cases, both the East Slavic and the [[Church Slavonic]] forms are in use, with many different meanings. ''For details, see [[Russian phonology]] and [[History of the Russian language]].''

Over the course of centuries, the vocabulary and literary style of Russian have also been influenced by Western and Central European languages such as [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[English language|English]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911| wstitle=Russian Language |first=Ellis Hovell |last=Minns |authorlink=Ellis Minns|volume=23 |pages=912–914}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to a lesser extent the languages to the south and the east: [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Turkic languages|Turkic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/610442?uid=3738736&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21106689665463|title=The Turkic Languages of Central Asia: Problems of Planned Culture Contact by Stefan Wurm|access-date=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://roa.rutgers.edu/files/491-0102/491-0102-GOUSKOVA-0-0.PDF|title=Falling Sonoroty Onsets, Loanwords, and Syllable contact|access-date=4 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505092913/http://roa.rutgers.edu/files/491-0102/491-0102-GOUSKOVA-0-0.PDF|archivedate=5 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Persian language|Persian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|author=Aliyeh Kord Zafaranlu Kambuziya|author2=Eftekhar Sadat Hashemi|url=http://roa.rutgers.edu/content/article/files/1317_hashemi_1.pdf|title=Russian Loanword Adoptation in Persian; Optimal Approach|publisher=roa.rutgers.edu|date=2010|access-date=4 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505092721/http://roa.rutgers.edu/content/article/files/1317_hashemi_1.pdf|archivedate=5 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Iraj Bashiri|url=https://www.academia.edu/10442551/Russian_Loanwords_in_Persian_and_Tajiki_Languages|title=Russian Loanwords in Persian and Tajiki Language|publisher=academia.edu|date=1990|access-date=4 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530193133/http://www.academia.edu/10442551/Russian_Loanwords_in_Persian_and_Tajiki_Languages|archivedate=30 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], as well as [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].&lt;ref&gt;Colin Baker, Sylvia Prys Jones [https://books.google.com/books?id=YgtSqB9oqDIC&amp;pg=PA219&amp;dq=russian+loanwords+in+hebrew&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y75GVbmtKomuUe25gbAJ&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=russian%20loanwords%20in%20hebrew&amp;f=false ''Encyclopedia of Bilingualism and Bilingual Education''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320151848/https://books.google.com/books?id=YgtSqB9oqDIC&amp;pg=PA219&amp;dq=russian+loanwords+in+hebrew&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y75GVbmtKomuUe25gbAJ&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw |date=2018-03-20 }} pp 219 Multilingual Matters, 1998 {{ISBN|1-85359-362-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Defense Language Institute]] in [[Monterey, California]], Russian is classified as a level III language in terms of learning difficulty for native [[English language|English]] speakers, requiring approximately 1,100 hours of immersion instruction to achieve intermediate fluency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson|first=Irene|title=Language Learning Difficulty|url=http://aboutworldlanguages.com/language-difficulty|access-date=25 May 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140527094808/http://aboutworldlanguages.com/language-difficulty|archivedate=27 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also regarded by the [[United States Intelligence Community]] as a "hard target" language, due to both its difficulty to master for English speakers and its critical role in [[American foreign policy|U.S. world policy]].

== Standard Russian ==
{{Main|Moscovian dialect}}

The standard form of Russian is generally regarded as the ''modern Russian literary language'' ({{lang|ru|современный русский литературный язык}}). It arose in the beginning of the 18th century with the modernization reforms of the Russian state under the rule of [[Peter the Great]], and developed from the Moscow ([[Central Russian dialects|Middle or Central Russian]]) dialect substratum under the influence of some of the previous century's Russian chancellery language.

[[Mikhail Lomonosov]] first compiled a normalizing grammar book in 1755; in 1783 the [[Russian Academy]]'s first explanatory Russian dictionary appeared. During the end of the 18th and 19th centuries, a period known as the "Golden Age", the grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation of the Russian language was stabilized and standardized, and it became the nationwide literary language; meanwhile, Russia's world-famous literature flourished.

Until the 20th century, the language's spoken form was the language of only the upper noble classes and urban population, as Russian peasants from the countryside continued to speak in their own dialects. By the mid-20th century, such dialects were forced out with the introduction of the compulsory education system that was established by the [[Soviet government]]. Despite the formalization of Standard Russian, some nonstandard dialectal features (such as fricative {{IPA|[ɣ]}} in [[Southern Russian dialects]]) are still observed in colloquial speech.

Russian is one of the [[Official languages of the United Nations|six official languages]] of the [[United Nations]].

In [[Ukraine]], Russian is seen as a language of inter-ethnic communication, and a minority language, under the 1996 [[Constitution of Ukraine]].&lt;ref name="fundeh1" /&gt; According to estimates from Demoskop Weekly, in 2004 there were 14,400,000 native speakers of Russian in the country, and 29 million active speakers.&lt;ref name="demoscope251"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2006/0251/tema01.php|title=Падение статуса русского языка на постсоветском пространстве|website=demoscope.ru|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025204352/http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2006/0251/tema01.php|archivedate=2016-10-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 65% of the population was fluent in Russian in 2006, and 38% used it as the main language with family, friends, or at work.&lt;ref name="demoscope329" /&gt;

In the 20th century, Russian was a mandatory language taught in the schools of the members of the old [[Warsaw Pact]] and in other [[Communist state|countries]] that used to be satellites of the USSR. According to the Eurobarometer 2005 survey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/languages/pdf/doc631_en.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521033643/http://ec.europa.eu/education/languages/pdf/doc631_en.pdf|archivedate=2009-05-21|title=Europeans and their Languages|date=2006|work=europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; fluency in Russian remains fairly high (20–40%) in some countries, in particular those where the people speak a [[Slavic language]] and thereby have an edge in learning Russian (namely, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Bulgaria).

Significant Russian-speaking groups also exist in [[Western Europe]]. These have been fed by several waves of immigrants since the beginning of the 20th century, each with its own flavor of language. The [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], [[Finland]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Belgium]], [[Greece]], [[Norway]], and [[Austria]] have significant Russian-speaking communities.

=== Asia ===

In [[China]], Russian has no official status, but it is spoken by the small Russian communities in the Northeastern [[Heilongjiang]] province.

In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], Russian has no official status, but it is recognized as a minority language under the [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]].&lt;ref name="fundeh1" /&gt; Russian is the language of 9% of the population according to the World Factbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{CIA World Factbook link|gg|Georgia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnologue cites Russian as the country's de facto working language.&lt;ref name="ethn"&gt;{{Ethnologue21|rus|Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Russian language in the United States}}
The language was first introduced in [[North America]] when [[Russian explorers]] voyaged into [[Alaska]] and claimed it for Russia during the 18th century. Although most Russian colonists left after the United States bought the land in 1867, a handful stayed and preserved the Russian language in this region to this day, although only a few elderly speakers of this unique dialect are left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://languagehat.com/ninilchik/ |title=Ninilchik |publisher=languagehat.com |date=2009-01-01 |access-date=2013-06-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107112220/http://languagehat.com/ninilchik/ |archivedate=2014-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sizable Russian-speaking communities also exist in [[North America]], especially in large urban centers of the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Canada]], such as [[Russian Americans in New York City|New York City]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Boston]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[San Francisco]], [[Seattle]], [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]], [[Toronto]], [[History of the Russians in Baltimore|Baltimore]], [[Miami]], [[Chicago]], [[Denver]], and [[Cleveland]]. In a number of locations they issue their own newspapers, and live in [[ethnic enclave]]s (especially the generation of immigrants who started arriving in the early 1960s). Only about 25% of them are ethnic Russians, however. Before the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the overwhelming majority of [[Russophone]]s in [[Brighton Beach, Brooklyn]] in New York City were Russian-speaking [[Jews]]. Afterward, the influx from the countries of the former [[Soviet Union]] changed the statistics somewhat, with ethnic Russians and Ukrainians immigrating along with some more Russian Jews and Central Asians. According to the [[United States Census]], in 2007 Russian was the primary language spoken in the homes of over 850,000 individuals living in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/language/data/acs/ACS-12.pdf |title=Language Use in the United States: 2007, census.gov |format=PDF |access-date=2013-06-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614060228/http://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/language/data/acs/ACS-12.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian language is also one of two official languages aboard the [[International Space Station]] – [[NASA]] astronauts who serve alongside Russian cosmonauts usually take Russian language courses. This practice goes back to the [[Apollo-Soyuz]] mission, which first flew in 1975.

In March 2013 it was announced that Russian is now the second-most used language on the Internet after English. People use the Russian language on 5.9% of all websites, slightly ahead of German and far behind English (54.7%). Russian is used not only on 89.8% of [[.ru]] sites, but also on 88.7% of sites with the former Soviet Union domain [[.su]]. The websites of former Soviet Union nations also use high levels of Russian: 79.0% in Ukraine, 86.9% in Belarus, 84.0% in Kazakhstan, 79.6% in Uzbekistan, 75.9% in Kyrgyzstan and 81.8% in Tajikistan.

Russian is a rather homogeneous language, in terms of dialectal variation, due to the early political centralization under Moscow's rule, compulsory education, mass migration from rural to urban areas in the 20th century, as well as other factors. The standard language is used in written and spoken form almost everywhere in the country, from Kaliningrad and Saint Petersburg in the West to Vladivostok and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the East, notwithstanding the enormous distance in between.

Despite leveling after 1900, especially in matters of vocabulary and phonetics, a number of dialects still exist in Russia. Some linguists divide the dialects of Russian into two primary regional groupings, "Northern" and "Southern", with [[Moscow]] lying on the zone of transition between the two. Others divide the language into three groupings, [[Northern Russian dialects|Northern]], [[Central Russian dialects|Central]] (or Middle) and [[Southern Russian dialects|Southern]], with Moscow lying in the Central region.&lt;ref&gt;David Dalby. 1999–2000. ''The Linguasphere Register of the World's Languages and Speech Communities''. Linguasphere Press.  Pg. 442.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=521–526}} All dialects also divided in two main chronological categories: the dialects of ''primary formation'' (the territory of [[Muscovy]], roughly consists of the modern [[Central Federal District|Central]] and [[Northwestern Federal District|Northwestern]] Federal districts); and ''secondary formation'' (other territory). [[Dialectology]] within Russia recognizes dozens of smaller-scale variants. The dialects often show distinct and non-standard features of pronunciation and intonation, vocabulary and grammar. Some of these are relics of ancient usage now completely discarded by the standard language.

The [[Northern Russian dialects]] and those spoken along the [[Volga River]] typically pronounce unstressed {{IPA|/o/}} clearly, a phenomenon called [[vowel reduction in Russian#Back vowels|okanye]] ({{lang|ru|оканье}}).{{sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=521–526}} Besides the absence of vowel reduction, some dialects have [[high vowel|high]] or [[diphthong]]al {{IPA|/e⁓i̯ɛ/}} in the place of {{proto|slavic|ě}} and {{IPA|/o⁓u̯ɔ/}} in stressed closed syllables (as in Ukrainian) instead of Standard Russian {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}.{{sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=521–526}} An interesting morphological feature is a post-posed definite article ''-to'', ''-ta'', ''-te'' similarly to that existing in Bulgarian and Macedonian.{{sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=521–526}}

In the [[Southern Russian dialects]], instances of unstressed {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/a/}} following [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] consonants and preceding a stressed syllable are not reduced to {{IPA|[ɪ]}} (as occurs in the Moscow dialect), being instead pronounced {{IPA|[a]}} in such positions (e.g. {{wikt-lang|ru|несл'''и'''}} is pronounced {{IPA|[nʲaˈslʲi]}}, not {{IPA|[nʲɪsˈlʲi]}}) – this is called [[yakanye]] ({{lang|ru|яканье}}).{{sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=521–526}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Language of the Russian Village|language=Russian|url=http://www.gramota.ru/book/village/map13.html|access-date=2011-11-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68V4oz1bd?url=http://www.gramota.ru/book/village/map13.html|archivedate=2012-06-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Consonants include a [[Voiced velar fricative|fricative {{IPA|/ɣ/}}]], a [[semivowel|semivowel {{IPA|/w⁓u̯/}}]] and {{IPA|/x⁓xv⁓xw/}}, whereas the Standard and Northern dialects have the consonants {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, {{IPA|/v/}}, and final {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/f/}}, respectively.{{sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=521–526}}
The morphology features a palatalized final {{IPA|/tʲ/}} in 3rd person forms of verbs (this is unpalatalized in the Standard and Northern dialects).{{sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=521–526}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Language of the Russian Village|language=Russian|url=http://www.gramota.ru/book/village/map14.html|access-date=2011-11-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/657ohJW4R?url=http://www.gramota.ru/book/village/map14.html|archivedate=2012-02-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these features such as akanye and yakanye, a [[debuccalized]] or [[lenited]] {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, a [[semivowel|semivowel {{IPA|/w⁓u̯/}}]] and palatalized final {{IPA|/tʲ/}} in 3rd person forms of verbs are also present in modern [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and some dialects of [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] (Eastern [[Polesia]]n), indicating a linguistic continuum.

The city of [[Old Novgorod dialect|Veliky Novgorod]] has historically displayed a feature called [[chokanye]] or [[tsokanye]] ({{lang|ru|чоканье}} or {{lang|ru|цоканье}}), in which {{IPA|/tɕ/}} and {{IPA|/ts/}} were switched or merged. So, {{wikt-lang|ru|'''ц'''апля}} ('heron') has been recorded as {{lang|ru|чапля}}. Also, the [[Slavic second palatalization|second palatalization]] of [[Velar consonant|velars]] did not occur there, so the so-called '''ě²''' (from the [[Proto-Slavic]] diphthong *ai) did not cause {{IPA|/k, ɡ, x/}} to shift to {{IPA|/ts, dz, s/}}; therefore, where Standard Russian has {{wikt-lang|ru|'''ц'''епь}} ('chain'), the form {{lang|ru|'''к'''епь}} {{IPA|[kʲepʲ]}} is attested in earlier texts.

Among the first to study Russian dialects was [[Mikhail Lomonosov|Lomonosov]] in the 18th century. In the 19th, [[Vladimir Dal]] compiled the first dictionary that included dialectal vocabulary. Detailed mapping of Russian dialects began at the turn of the 20th century. In modern times, the monumental ''Dialectological Atlas of the Russian Language'' ({{lang|ru|Диалектологический атлас русского языка}} {{IPA-ru|dʲɪɐˌlʲɛktəɫɐˈɡʲitɕɪskʲɪj ˈatɫəs ˈruskəvə jɪzɨˈka|}}), was published in three folio volumes 1986–1989, after four decades of preparatory work.

While these older letters have been abandoned at one time or another, they may be used in this and related articles. The [[yer]]s {{angbr|{{lang|ru|ъ}}}} and {{angbr|{{lang|ru|ь}}}} originally indicated the pronunciation of ''ultra-short'' or ''reduced'' {{IPA|/ŭ/}}, {{IPA|/ĭ/}}.

=== Transliteration ===
{{Further|Romanization of Russian|Informal romanizations of Russian}}

Because of many technical restrictions in computing and also because of the unavailability of Cyrillic keyboards abroad, Russian is often transliterated using the Latin alphabet. For example, {{wikt-lang|ru|мороз}} ('frost') is transliterated ''moroz'', and  {{wikt-lang|ru|мышь}} ('mouse'), ''mysh'' or ''myš'''. Once commonly used by the majority of those living outside Russia, transliteration is being used less frequently by Russian-speaking typists in favor of the extension of [[Unicode]] [[character encoding]], which fully incorporates the Russian alphabet.  Free programs leveraging this Unicode extension are available which allow users to type Russian characters, even on Western 'QWERTY' keyboards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Caloni |first=Wanderley |title=RusKey: mapping the Russian keyboard layout into the Latin alphabets |url=http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/11940/RusKey-mapping-the-Russian-keyboard-layout-into-th |date=2007-02-15 |access-date=2011-01-28 |publisher=[[The Code Project]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301121842/http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/11940/RusKey-mapping-the-Russian-keyboard-layout-into-th |archivedate=2012-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Computing ===
The Russian alphabet has many systems of [[character encoding]]. [[KOI8-R]] was designed by the Soviet government and was intended to serve as the standard encoding. This encoding was and still is widely used in UNIX-like operating systems. Nevertheless, the spread of [[MS-DOS]] and [[OS/2]] ([[Code page 866|IBM866]]), traditional Macintosh ([[ISO/IEC 8859-5]]) and [[Microsoft Windows]] (CP1251) created chaos and ended by establishing different encodings as de facto standards, with Windows-1251 becoming a [[de facto standard]] in Russian Internet and e-mail communication during the period of roughly 1995–2005.

All the obsolete 8-bit encodings are rarely used in the communication protocols and text-exchange data formats, having been mostly replaced with [[UTF-8]]. A number of encoding conversion applications were developed. "[[iconv]]" is an example that is supported by most versions of [[Linux]], [[Macintosh]] and some other [[operating system]]s; but converters are rarely needed unless accessing texts created more than a few years ago.

In addition to the modern Russian alphabet, Unicode (and thus UTF-8) encodes the [[Early Cyrillic alphabet]] (which is very similar to the [[Greek alphabet]]), as well as all other Slavic and non-Slavic but Cyrillic-based alphabets.

=== Orthography ===
{{Main|Russian orthography}}

Russian spelling is reasonably phonemic in practice. It is in fact a balance among phonemics, morphology, etymology, and grammar; and, like that of most living languages, has its share of inconsistencies and controversial points. A number of rigid [[spelling rule]]s introduced between the 1880s and 1910s have been responsible for the former whilst trying to eliminate the latter.

The current spelling follows the major reform of 1918, and the final codification of 1956. An update proposed in the late 1990s has met a hostile reception, and has not been formally adopted. The punctuation, originally based on [[Byzantine Greek]], was in the 17th and 18th centuries reformulated on the French and German models.

According to the Institute of Russian Language of the Russian Academy of Sciences, an optional [[acute accent]] ({{lang|ru|знак ударения}}) may, and sometimes should, be used to mark [[stress (linguistics)|stress]]. For example, it is used to distinguish between otherwise identical words, especially when context does not make it obvious: {{lang|ru|замо́к}} – {{lang|ru|за́мок}} ("lock" – "castle"), {{lang|ru|сто́ящий}} – {{lang|ru|стоя́щий}} ("worthwhile" – "standing"), {{lang|ru|чудно́}} – {{lang|ru|чу́дно}} ("this is odd" – "this is marvelous"), {{lang|ru|молоде́ц}} – {{lang|ru|мо́лодец}} ("attaboy" – "fine young man"), {{lang|ru|узна́ю}} – {{lang|ru|узнаю́}} ("I shall learn it" – "I recognize it"), {{lang|ru|отреза́ть}} – {{lang|ru|отре́зать}} ("to be cutting" – "to have cut"); to indicate the proper pronunciation of uncommon words, especially personal and family names ({{lang|ru|афе́ра}}, {{lang|ru|гу́ру}}, {{lang|ru|Гарси́я}}, {{lang|ru|Оле́ша}}, {{lang|ru|Фе́рми}}), and to show which is the stressed word in a sentence ({{lang|ru|Ты́ съел печенье? – Ты съе́л печенье? – Ты съел пече́нье?}} "Was it ''you'' who ate the cookie? – Did you ''eat'' the cookie? – Was it the ''cookie'' that you ate?"). Stress marks are mandatory in lexical dictionaries and books for children or Russian learners.

== Phonology ==
{{Main|Russian phonology}}

The phonological system of Russian is inherited from [[Common Slavonic]]; it underwent considerable modification in the early historical period before being largely settled around the year 1400.

The language possesses five vowels (or six, under the St.{{nbsp}}Petersburg Phonological School), which are written with different letters depending on whether the preceding consonant is [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]]. The consonants typically come in plain vs. palatalized pairs, which are traditionally called ''hard'' and ''soft.'' (The ''hard'' consonants are often [[velarization|velarized]], especially before front vowels, as in [[Irish language|Irish]]). The standard language, based on the Moscow dialect, possesses heavy stress and moderate variation in pitch. Stressed vowels are somewhat lengthened, while unstressed vowels tend to be reduced to near-close vowels or an unclear [[schwa]]. (See also: [[vowel reduction in Russian]].)

The Russian [[syllable]] structure can be quite complex, with both initial and final consonant clusters of up to four consecutive sounds. Using a formula with V standing for the nucleus (vowel) and C for each consonant, the structure can be described as follows:

(C)(C)(C)(C)V(C)(C)(C)(C)

Clusters of four consonants are not very common, however, especially within a morpheme. Some examples are: {{wikt-lang|ru|взгляд}} ({{IPA|[vzglʲat]}}, 'glance'), {{wikt-lang|ru|государств}} ({{IPA|[gəsʊˈdarstf]}}, 'of the states'), {{wikt-lang|ru|строительств}} ({{IPA|[strɐˈitʲɪlʲstf]}}, 'of the constructions').

Russian is notable for its distinction based on [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]] of most of the consonants. While {{IPA|/k, ɡ, x/}} do have palatalized [[allophone]]s {{IPA|[kʲ, ɡʲ, xʲ]}}, only {{IPA|/kʲ/}} might be considered a phoneme, though it is marginal and generally not considered distinctive. The only native [[minimal pair]] that argues for {{IPA|/kʲ/}} being a separate phoneme is {{lang|ru|это {{wikt-lang|ru|ткать|ткёт}}}} ({{IPA|[ˈɛtə tkʲɵt]}}, 'it weaves'){{snd}}{{lang|ru|этот {{wikt-lang|ru|кот}}}} ({{IPA|[ˈɛtət kot]}}, 'this cat'). Palatalization means that the center of the tongue is raised during and after the articulation of the consonant. In the case of {{IPA|/tʲ/}} and {{IPA|/dʲ/}}, the tongue is raised enough to produce slight frication (affricate sounds; cf. Belarusian ць, дзь, or Polish ć, dź). The sounds {{IPA|/t, d, ts, s, z, n, rʲ/}} are [[dental consonant|dental]], that is, pronounced with the tip of the tongue against the teeth rather than against the [[alveolar ridge]].

== Grammar ==
{{expand section|date=August 2014}}
{{Main|Russian grammar}}

Russian has preserved an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[Synthetic language|synthetic]]-[[inflection]]al structure, although considerable levelling has taken place.
Russian grammar encompasses:
* a highly [[Fusional language|fusional]] '''morphology'''
* a '''syntax''' that, for the literary language, is the conscious fusion of three elements:{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}
** a polished [[vernacular]] foundation;{{clarify|What is this supposed to mean?|date=August 2014}}
** a [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]] inheritance;
** a [[Western Europe]]an style.{{clarify|What is this supposed to mean?|date=August 2014}}

The spoken language has been influenced by the literary one but continues to preserve characteristic forms. The dialects show various non-standard grammatical features, {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} some of which are archaisms or descendants of old forms since discarded by the literary language.

The [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]] language was introduced to [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Moskovy]] in the late 15th century and was adopted as official language for correspondence for convenience. Firstly with the newly conquered south-western regions of former Kyivan Rus and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], later, when Moskovy cut its ties with the [[Golden Horde]], for communication between all newly consolidated regions of [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Moskovy]].

In terms of actual grammar, there are three [[tenses]] in Russian - past, present and future - and each verb has two [[Grammatical aspect in Slavic languages|aspects]] (perfective and imperfective).  Russian nouns each have a gender - either feminine, masculine or neutral, indicated by spelling at the end of the word.  Words change depending on both their gender and function in the sentence. Russian has six [[Grammatical case|cases]]: Nominative (for the subject of the sentence), Accusative (for direct objects), Dative (for indirect objects), Genitive (to indicate possession), Instrumental (to indicate 'with' or 'by means of') and Prepositional (used after a preposition).  Verbs of motion in Russian - such as 'go', 'walk', 'run', 'swim' and 'fly' - use the imperfective or perfective form to indicate a single or return trip, and also use a multitude of [[prefix]]es to add more meaning to the verb.

== Vocabulary ==

Judging by the historical records, by approximately 1000 AD the predominant ethnic group over much of modern European [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]] was the Eastern branch of the [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], speaking a closely related group of dialects. The political unification of this region into [[Kievan Rus']] in about 880, from which modern Russia, Ukraine and Belarus trace their origins, established [[Old East Slavic]] as a literary and commercial language. It was soon followed by the adoption of [[Christianity]] in 988 and the introduction of the South Slavic [[Old Church Slavonic]] as the liturgical and official language. Borrowings and [[calque]]s from [[Byzantine Greek]] began to enter the Old East Slavic and spoken dialects at this time, which in their turn modified the Old Church Slavonic as well.

[[File:Ostromirovo.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Ostromir Gospels]] of 1056 is the second oldest [[East Slavic languages|East Slavic]] book known, one of many medieval [[illuminated manuscript]]s preserved in the [[Russian National Library]].]]
Dialectal differentiation accelerated after the breakup of Kievan Rus' in approximately 1100. On the territories of modern Belarus and Ukraine emerged [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] and in modern Russia [[History of the Russian language|medieval Russian]]. They became distinct since the 13th century, i.e. following the division of that land between the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], Poland and Hungary in the west and independent Novgorod and Pskov feudal republics plus numerous small duchies (which came to be vassals of the Tatars) in the east.

The official language in Moscow and Novgorod, and later, in the growing Muscovy, was [[Church Slavonic]], which evolved from Old Church Slavonic and remained [[Diglossia|the literary language]] for centuries, until the [[Peter I of Russia#Early reign|Petrine age]], when its usage became limited to biblical and liturgical texts. Russian developed under a strong influence of Church Slavonic until the close of the 17th century; afterward the influence reversed, leading to corruption of liturgical texts.

The political reforms of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] (Пётр Вели́кий, ''Pyótr Velíkiy'') were accompanied by a reform of the alphabet, and achieved their goal of secularization and Westernization. Blocks of specialized vocabulary were adopted from the languages of Western Europe. By 1800, a significant portion of the gentry spoke [[French language|French]] daily, and [[German language|German]] sometimes. Many Russian novels of the 19th century, e.g. [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s (Лев Толсто́й) ''[[War and Peace]]'', contain entire paragraphs and even pages in French with no translation given, with an assumption that educated readers would not need one.

The modern literary language is usually considered to date from the time of [[Alexander Pushkin]] ({{lang|ru|Алекса́ндр Пу́шкин}}) in the first third of the 19th century. Pushkin revolutionized [[Russian literature]] by rejecting archaic grammar and vocabulary (so-called {{lang|ru|высо́кий стиль}} — "high style") in favor of grammar and vocabulary found in the spoken language of the time. Even modern readers of younger age may only experience slight difficulties understanding some words in Pushkin's texts, since relatively few words used by Pushkin have become archaic or changed meaning. In fact, many expressions used by Russian writers of the early 19th century, in particular Pushkin, [[Mikhail Lermontov]] ({{lang|ru|Михаи́л Ле́рмонтов}}), [[Nikolai Gogol]] ({{lang|ru|Никола́й Го́голь}}), [[Aleksander Griboyedov]] ({{lang|ru|Алекса́ндр Грибое́дов}}), became proverbs or sayings which can be frequently found even in modern Russian colloquial speech.

The political upheavals of the early 20th century and the wholesale changes of political ideology gave written Russian its modern appearance after the spelling reform of 1918. Political circumstances and Soviet accomplishments in military, scientific and technological matters (especially [[cosmonaut]]ics), gave Russian a worldwide prestige, especially during the mid-20th century.

During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, the policy toward the languages of the various other ethnic groups fluctuated in practice. Though each of the constituent republics had its own official language, the unifying role and superior status was reserved for Russian, although it was declared the [[official language]] only in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal-ussr.narod.ru/data01/tex10935.htm "Закон СССР от 24 April 1990 О языках народов СССР"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508201331/http://legal-ussr.narod.ru/data01/tex10935.htm |date=8 May 2016 }} (The 1990 USSR Law about the Languages of the USSR) {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|break-up of the USSR]] in 1991, several of the newly independent states have encouraged their native languages, which has partly reversed the privileged status of Russian, though its role as the language of post-Soviet national discourse throughout the region has continued.

The Russian language in the world declined after 1991 due to the collapse of the Soviet Union and decrease in the number of [[Russians]] in the world and diminution of the total population in [[Russia]] (where Russian is an official language), however this has since been reversed.&lt;ref name="demoscope.ru" /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated20130215-1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mof.gov.cy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2008/0329/tema04.php |title=журнал "Демоскоп".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9125">In [[number theory]] and [[algebraic geometry]], the '''Tate conjecture''' is a 1963  [[conjecture]] of [[John Tate]] that would describe the [[algebraic cycle]]s on a [[algebraic variety|variety]] in terms of a more computable invariant, the [[Galois module|Galois representation]] on [[étale cohomology]]. The Tate conjecture is a central problem in the theory of algebraic cycles. It can be considered an arithmetic analog of the [[Hodge conjecture]].

==Statement of the conjecture==
Let ''V'' be a [[smooth scheme|smooth]] [[projective variety|projective]] variety over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''k'' which is finitely generated over its [[prime field]]. Let ''k''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; be a [[algebraic closure|separable closure]] of ''k'', and let ''G'' be the [[absolute Galois group]] Gal(''k''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;/''k'') of ''k''. Fix a [[prime number]] ℓ which is invertible in ''k''. Consider the [[l-adic cohomology|ℓ-adic cohomology]] groups (coefficients in the [[p-adic integer|ℓ-adic integer]]s '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt;, scalars then extended to the [[l-adic number|ℓ-adic number]]s '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt;) of the base extension of ''V'' to ''k''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;; these groups  are [[group representation|representations]] of ''G''. For any ''i'' ≥ 0, a [[codimension]]-''i'' subvariety of ''V'' (understood to be defined over ''k'') determines an element of the cohomology group

:&lt;math&gt; H^{2i}(V_{k_s},\mathbf{Q}_{\ell}(i)) = W &lt;/math&gt;

which is fixed by ''G''. Here '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt;(''i''&amp;thinsp;) denotes the ''i''th [[Tate twist]], which means that this representation of the Galois group ''G'' is tensored with the ''i''th power of the [[cyclotomic character]].

The '''Tate conjecture''' states that the subspace ''W''&lt;sup&gt;''G''&lt;/sup&gt; of ''W'' fixed by the Galois group ''G'' is spanned, as a '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt;-vector space, by the classes of codimension-''i'' subvarieties of ''V''. An '''algebraic cycle''' means a finite linear combination of subvarieties; so an equivalent statement is that every element of ''W''&lt;sup&gt;''G''&lt;/sup&gt; is the class of an algebraic cycle on ''V'' with '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt; coefficients.

==Known cases==
The Tate conjecture for [[divisor (algebraic geometry)|divisors]] (algebraic cycles of codimension 1) is a major open problem. For example, let ''f'' : ''X'' → ''C'' be a morphism from a smooth projective surface onto a smooth projective curve over a finite field. Suppose that the generic fiber ''F'' of ''f'', which is a curve over the [[function field of an algebraic variety|function field]] ''k''(''C''), is smooth over ''k''(''C''). Then the Tate conjecture for divisors on ''X'' is equivalent to the [[Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture]] for the [[Jacobian variety]] of ''F''.&lt;ref&gt;D. Ulmer. Arithmetic Geometry over Global Function Fields (2014), 283-337. Proposition 5.1.2 and Theorem 6.3.1.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the Hodge conjecture for divisors on any smooth complex projective variety is known (the [[Lefschetz theorem on (1,1)-classes|Lefschetz (1,1)-theorem]]).

Probably the most important known case is that the Tate conjecture is true for divisors on [[abelian variety|abelian varieties]]. This is a theorem of Tate for abelian varieties over finite fields, and of [[Gerd Faltings|Faltings]] for abelian varieties over number fields, part of Faltings's solution of the [[Mordell conjecture]]. Zarhin extended these results to any finitely generated base field. The Tate conjecture for divisors on abelian varieties implies the Tate conjecture for divisors on any product of curves ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; × ... × ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;J. Tate. Motives (1994), Part 1, 71-83. Theorem 5.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The (known) Tate conjecture for divisors on abelian varieties is equivalent to a powerful statement about homomorphisms between abelian varieties. Namely, for any abelian varieties ''A'' and ''B'' over a finitely generated field ''k'', the natural map

:&lt;math&gt; \text{Hom}(A,B)\otimes_{\mathbf{Z}}\mathbf{Q}_{\ell} \to \text{Hom}_G \left (H_1 \left (A_{k_s},\mathbf{Q}_{\ell} \right), H_1 \left (B_{k_s},\mathbf{Q}_{\ell} \right) \right )&lt;/math&gt;

is an isomorphism.&lt;ref&gt;J. Tate. Arithmetical Algebraic Geometry (1965), 93-110. Equation (8).&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, an abelian variety ''A'' is determined up to [[isogeny]] by the Galois representation on its [[Tate module]] ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''A''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt;).

The Tate conjecture also holds for [[K3 surface]]s over finitely generated fields of characteristic not 2.&lt;ref&gt;K. Madapusi Pera. Inventiones Mathematicae. Theorem 1.&lt;/ref&gt; (On a surface, the nontrivial part of the conjecture is about divisors.) In characteristic zero, the Tate conjecture for K3 surfaces was proved by André and Tankeev. For K3 surfaces over finite fields of characteristic not 2, the Tate conjecture was proved by Nygaard, [[Arthur Ogus|Ogus]], Charles, Madapusi Pera, and Maulik.

==Related conjectures==

Let ''X'' be a smooth projective variety over a finitely generated field ''k''. The '''semisimplicity conjecture''' predicts that the representation of the Galois group ''G'' = Gal(''k''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;/''k'') on the ℓ-adic cohomology of ''X'' is semisimple (that is, a direct sum of [[irreducible representation]]s). For ''k'' of characteristic 0, {{harvtxt|Moonen|2017}} showed that the Tate conjecture (as stated above) implies the semisimplicity of &lt;math&gt;H^i(X \times_k \overline k, \mathbb Q_\ell(n)).&lt;/math&gt; For ''k'' finite of order ''q'', Tate showed that the Tate conjecture plus the semisimplicity conjecture would imply the '''strong Tate conjecture''', namely that the order of the pole of the [[Hasse-Weil zeta function|zeta function]] ''Z''(''X'', ''t'') at ''t'' = ''q''&lt;sup&gt;−''j''&lt;/sup&gt; is equal to the rank of the group of algebraic cycles of codimension ''j'' modulo [[numerical equivalence]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Tate. Motives (1994), Part 1, 71-83. Theorem 2.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the Hodge conjecture, the Tate conjecture would imply most of Grothendieck's [[standard conjectures on algebraic cycles]]. Namely, it would imply the Lefschetz standard conjecture (that the inverse of the Lefschetz isomorphism is defined by an algebraic correspondence); that the Künneth components of the diagonal are algebraic; and that numerical equivalence and homological equivalence of algebraic cycles are the same.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2332">'''Titus Lewis''' (21 February 1773 – 1 May 1811) was a [[Wales|Welsh]] [[Baptist]] minister and author. Lewis is notable for several important works, including the publication of ''A Welsh-English Dictionary'' (1805) and several volumes of [[hymn]]s and biblical commentaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=John |editor1-last=Davies|editor1-link=John Davies (historian)|editor2-first=Nigel |editor2-last=Jenkins | editor2-link=Nigel Jenkins| editor3-first=Baines |editor3-last=Menna|editor4-first=Peredur I. |editor4-last=Lynch|title=The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales |year=2008 |publisher=University of Wales Press |location=Cardiff|page=459 |isbn=978-0-7083-1953-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bibliography==
Lewis was born in [[Cilgerran]] to Lewis Thomas, a minister at [[Cilfowyr]]. He was baptised at [[Blaen-y-waun]] and was preaching by 1794, and was  ordained there in 1798.&lt;ref name="NLoW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-LEWI-TIT-1773.html |title=Biography of Titus Lewis|author=Rhys, William Joseph|publisher=National Library of Wales|date= |accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married in 1800, but his wife's dislike of the area saw them move to [[Carmarthen]], where he became minister of Dark Gate Baptist Church.&lt;ref name="NLoW" /&gt; In 1805 he published ''A Welsh-English Dictionary'', and in 1806 with the aid of [[Joseph Harris (Gomer)|Joseph Harris]], he published the journal ''Y Drysorfa Efangylaidd'', Lewis using the pseudonyms 'Obadiah' and 'Gaius' while Harris wrote under the name 'Adelphos o Abertawe'.&lt;ref name="NLoW"/&gt; In 1810 Lewis published  ''Hanes … Prydain Fawr'', a 624-page volume and his most significant work.&lt;ref name="NLoW"/&gt; He then, along with [[Christmas Evans]], and Harris, decided to translate [[John Gill (theologian)|Gill's]] commentary on the New Testament into [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. It is believed that the published work of this project was primarily Lewis', based on the evidence that after his death in 1811, no further translations appeared.&lt;ref name="NLoW"/&gt;

'''Urdu Wikipedia''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|{{#property:P1448}}}}}}), started in January 2004, is the [[Urdu]] language edition of [[Wikipedia]], a free, open-content encyclopedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.karachiupdates.com/v1.5/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1938:2009-10-19-10-28-43&amp;catid=2:2009-07-03-13-16-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430014030/http://www.karachiupdates.com/v1.5/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1938%3A2009-10-19-10-28-43&amp;catid=2%3A2009-07-03-13-16-07|dead-url=yes|archive-date=April 30, 2014|title=کراچی میں وکی پیڈیا صارفین کا تاریخی اجلاس|date=October 19, 2009|publisher=Karachi Updates|language=Urdu|accessdate=2009-10-23|location=Karachi|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsurdu.net/2009/10/wikipedia-2/|title=Wikipedians meetup in Pakistan|date=October 19, 2009|publisher=News Urdu|language=Urdu|accessdate=2009-10-23|location=Karachi|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091023062531/http://newsurdu.net/2009/10/wikipedia-2/|archivedate=October 23, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of {{Currentmonth}} {{Currentyear}}, it has {{NUMBEROF|ARTICLES|ur|N}} articles, {{NUMBEROF|USERS|ur|N}} registered users and {{NUMBEROF|FILES|ur|N}} files and it is the [[List of Wikipedias|49th largest]] edition of Wikipedia by article count.

== History ==
Wikipedia started being multilingual in May 2001. As of December 2007, [[Wikipedia]] had approximately 9.25 million articles in 253 languages.

At first, Urdu Wikipedia faced technical problems with the Urdu script font, but now this matter is mostly settled; some unsolved areas remain. Urdu is written in [[Perso-Arabic script]], a right-to-left [[writing system]]. As a result, users sometimes need to configure their operating systems and web browsers accordingly.

Currently Urdu Wikipedia uses "Urdu Naskh Asiatype" font, which was introduced and is freely distributed by [[BBC]] at BBC Urdu Service website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/urdu/ |title=BBC Urdu - صفحۂ اول |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The font is primarily used for article bodies and headings. Urdu variation of [[Times New Roman]] is used for navigation links. Both of these fonts are variations of [[Naskh (script)|Naskh]] style.

Some [[Pakistan]]i variations of complex [[Nasta'liq script]] are also supported only as a secondary choice in [[HTML|class]] definitions of [[CSS]], i.e. if default font is not found on client system, then Nasta'liq script is used.

The translation of the Wikipedia interface and project information pages into Urdu is still in progress. Some pages about how to edit have been translated.

These dialects can furthermore be split into north-western dialects
(''Nordvestlandske dialekter''),  south-western dialects (''Sørvestlandske dialekter'') and southern dialects (''Sørlandske dialekter'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   https://snl.no/dialekter_i_Norge|title=dialekter i Norge|publisher = Store norske leksikon|author=     Martin Skjekkeland|accessdate= February 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Nordvestlandske dialekter''' ('''North-Western dialects''') have e-infinitive, and extends from the middle of [[Sogn og Fjordane]] to [[Romsdal]]. Of these, one can mention:
** Jølstramål - centering on [[Jølster]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   https://lokalhistoriewiki.no/index.php/J%C3%B8lster_kommune |title=Jølster kommune|publisher = lokalhistoriewiki.no|accessdate= February 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Sørvestlandske dialekter''' ('''South-western dialects''') have a-infinitive, and extends from the inner [[Sogn og Fjordane]], through [[Hordaland]] and [[Rogaland]] and parts of [[Vest-Agder]]. Of these, one can mention:
** Bergensk, Haugesundsk, [[Stavangersk]] - these are city dialects (''bymål''). They have strong ''simplification'',{{fix|text=of what?|date=May 2017}} which is characteristic for all urban dialects (''bydialekter''), but originate from the dialects of the area with which they have much in common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=      https://snl.no/dialekter_i_Bergen|title=dialekter i Bergen|publisher =  Store norske leksikon|author=  Martin Skjekkeland|accessdate= February 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=     https://snl.no/dialekter_i_Rogaland|title=dialekter i Rogaland|publisher =  Store norske leksikon|author=      Kjell Venås|accessdate= February 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wolof Wikipedia''' is the edition of [[Wikipedia]] in the [[Wolof language]]. It currently has {{NUMBEROF|ARTICLES|wo|N}} articles.

The Wikipedia was started in the beginning of 2005, along with the [[Bambara Wikipedia]] and the [[Fula Wikipedia]]. [[Kasper Souren]], a Dutchman who worked with [[Geekcorps]], wrote in a report to an open source conference that until 2006 "not much happened" on the Wolof Wikipedia.&lt;ref name=Lihp158&gt;[[Andrew Lih|Lih, Andrew]]. ''[[The Wikipedia Revolution: How a Bunch of Nobodies Created the World's Greatest Encyclopedia]]''. [[Hyperion Books|Hyperion]], [[New York City]]. 2009. First Edition. {{ISBN|978-1-4013-0371-6}} (alkaline paper). p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Up until that year, many small articles with very little content were posted.

In April 2007 Ibrahima Fall (username Ibou), a [[Senegal]]ese student living in [[Italy]], began adding substantial content to the Wolof Wikipedia.&lt;ref name=Lihp158/&gt; It had 500 articles in November 2007, 543 articles in June 2008, and 1028 articles in August 2015.&lt;ref name=Lihp158/&gt;&lt;ref name="wikimedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias|title=List of Wikipedias|website=Meta|accessdate=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2784">The '''''écorcheurs''''' ({{IPA-fr|ekɔʁʃœʁ|lang}}, {{lit}} "flayers") were armed bands who desolated [[France]] in the reign of [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]], stripping their victims of everything, often to their very clothes.&lt;ref name="Nuttall"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12342/12342-h/12342-h.htm#E Nuttal Encyclopedia at Project Guttenburg. ''Article - Ecorcheurs'']&lt;/ref&gt;

They were [[mercenary|mercenaries]] without employment since the [[Treaty of Arras (1435)|Treaty of Arras]] which ended disputes between the [[Armagnacs]] and [[Burgundian (party)|Burgundians]] in 1435. [[Rodrigo de Villandrando]] was known as the "Emperor of Pillagers" (''empereur des brigands'') and "L'Écorcheur" (the slaughterer).

==History==
From the mid-[[14th century]] the French royal forces, whether voluntary or ''semoncées'' had become institutionalized.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Contamine, La Guerre au Moyen Âge, Nouvelle Clio, Puf&lt;/ref&gt; The permanence of conflicts during the [[Hundred Years War]] (1337-1453) had created career soldiers, paid by the king or nobles. These however, were not mercenaries, as their vassals and clientelistic ties remained parallel to their economic interest in war.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Contamine, Guerre, État et société à la fin du Moyen Âge. Études sur les armées des rois de France (1337-1494), vol. 1 et 2, Paris, Éditions de l'École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales (EHESS), coll. « Ré-impressions », 2004 (1re éd. 1972), p450 &amp; p334.&lt;/ref&gt; 
During times of peace or truce, these unemployed warriors gathered in bands and lived on pillage and ransoms. In the [[14th century]], after the [[Peace of Brétigny]]-Calais (1360), large armies of  mercenaries armies were disbanded, on occasion without receiving their pay.

Those who did not have the financial means to go home or wanted to continue their martial lifestyle which was highly profitable, then formed ''[[Routiers|autonomous bands of the road]]'' which exert pressure on the regions of France.&lt;ref&gt;Boris Bove, Le temps de la guerre de Cent ans : 1328-1453, (Paris, Belin, coll. « Histoire de France », 2009), Vol1&amp;2 p669.&lt;/ref&gt;  these are the [[Free company|Great Companies]] and not be confused with the [[Grandes companies]], which are rather the result of political instability in fifteenth century France that peace and are mercenaries in the strict sense.
