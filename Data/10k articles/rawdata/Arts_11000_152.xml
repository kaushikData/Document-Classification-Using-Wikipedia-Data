The '''Abingdon Monks' Map''' (commonly known as '''The Monks' Map''') is a 16th-century map of the [[River Thames]] around the town of [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire]] (formerly in [[Berkshire]]), [[England]].&lt;ref name="steane"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Steane | first=John | url=http://oxoniensia.org/volumes/2008/steane.pdf |title=The Abingdon Monks' Map | journal=[[Oxoniensia]] | publisher=[[Oxfordshire Architectural &amp; Historical Society]] | volume=LXXII | pages=17–32 | year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is held in the collection of the [[Abingdon County Hall Museum]].
The map covers the stretch of river between Abingdon and [[Radley]]. It is {{convert|265.5|cm}} long and {{convert|41.5|cm}} wide, consisting of four pieces of [[vellum]] that are glued together.

==History==
The map was preserved in the archives of the [[Verney family]], having been inherited by [[Mary Blacknall]] (1616–1650), who married [[Sir Ralph Verney, 1st Baronet, of Middle Claydon]] (1613–1696). In 1907, it was given to the Corporation of Abingdon and was framed and held in the Guildhall at Abingdon. The map was restored for a reopening of [[Abingdon Museum]], where it was put on display in 2012. As part of the investigation during this process, the map was x-rayed at the [[National Gallery]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehorsedc.gov.uk/services-and-advice/sports-and-leisure/libraries-and-museums/abingdon-abbey-booklet |title=Abingdon Abbey booklet |publisher=[[Vale of White Horse]] District Council, Oxfordshire, UK |accessdate=5 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411184259/http://www.whitehorsedc.gov.uk/services-and-advice/sports-and-leisure/libraries-and-museums/abingdon-abbey-booklet |archivedate=11 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blacknall Map==
Another smaller map of the river, known as the '''Blacknall Map''' (or '''Claydon Map'''), is held at [[Claydon House]], the Verney family home, in [[Buckinghamshire]] to the north of Abingdon.&lt;ref name="steane" /&gt; This was produced for William Blacknall in support of his mill-owning and fishery rights during a lawsuit in 1570. The Monks' Map itself may well have been produced for a similar purpose rather than by monks at [[Abingdon Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-13879363 | title=Monks' map was commissioned by Abingdon landowner | publisher=[[BBC News]] | work=Oxford | date=23 June 2011 | accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Abuelas'' is Weis [[directorial debut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TCD.ie - Weis' Introduction |url=http://www.tcd.ie/Hispanic_Studies/TCTconference/assets/docs/Noemi%20Weis%206.pdf|publisher=Trinity College Dublin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three decades later the grandmothers or "[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp/realfile/www.unaids.org/en/story.asp?NewsID=37683&amp;Cr=unesco&amp;Cr1=#.UoKrulPYHME Abuelas]" continue the mission to find their grandchildren who survived, were kidnapped, and illegally adopted by families within the regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations News Centre |url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp/realfile/www.unaids.org/en/story.asp?NewsID=37683&amp;Cr=unesco&amp;Cr1=#.UoKrulPYHME }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Noemi Weis' new short documentary, ''Abuelas: Grandmothers on a Mission''[http://www.filmblanc.com] &lt;ref name=filmblanc&gt;{{cite web|title=Abuelas: Grandmothers on a Mission|url=http://www.filmblanc.com/films/abuelas/|publisher=Filmblanc}}&lt;/ref&gt; follows on their struggles three decades later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Latina Lista|url=http://latinalista.com/2013/02/intrnl-video-abuelas-on-a-mission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weis developed this film as an educational tribute to the grandmothers who dedicated their lives to the search for a generation lost due to Argentina's "dirty war." Sandrine Crisostomo of Femcine describes the film as "an impressive testimony of dictatorships' impact on families and on the strength of women's hope through decades."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WMM Film Catalog|url=http://www.wmm.com/filmcatalog/pages/c860.shtml|publisher=Women Make Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Annette  Lemieux''' (born 1957 in Norfolk, Virginia) is an American artist who emerged in the early 1980s along with the “picture theory” artists ([[David Salle]], [[Jack Goldstein]], [[Cindy Sherman]], [[Barbara Kruger]], [[Richard Prince]]). Lemieux brought to the studio a discipline equally based on introspection, and the manifestations of an ideological [[minimalism]].  Process is a key component in the execution of her works over the past three decades, creating the lure to the confrontation of issues of social and historical urgency.
Lemieux has been the recipient of awards from the [[National Endowment of the Arts]] and the Keiser Wilhelm Museum, Germany and an honorary Doctorate in Fine Arts from [[Monserrat College]] of Art.  Presently, in addition to her studio and exhibition schedule, she is a senior lecturer at [[Harvard University]] in the area of visual and environmental studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2007/07/annette-lemieux-html|title=Annette Lemieux|date=1 July 2007|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lemieux is represented by Elizabeth Dee Gallery in [[New York City|New York]].

==Early life==

Annette Rose Lemieux was born in Norfolk, Virginia. Her father Joseph was in the Marines, and the family lived in a house close to the base. When Lemieux's father was called overseas, her mother, Margaret, moved with their two daughters – Annette and Suzette – to her hometown of Torrington, Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lemieux|first1=Annette|title=The Strange Life of Objects|date=2010|publisher=Krannert Art Museum and Kinkead Pavilion|location=Champaign, Illinois|isbn=978-1-883015-45-9|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, she received her [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] in painting from Hartford Art School University of Hartford in Connecticut.&lt;ref name="oxfordartonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/view/10.1093/gao/9781884446054.001.0001/oao-9781884446054-e-7002021784|title=Lemieux, Annette – Grove Art|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

In early works like ''[[It’s a Wonderful Life]]'', 1986 [named after the 1946 [[Frank Capra]] film], Lemieux incorporated multiple forms of popular media to create a narrative in the form of self-doubt, personal vulnerability, along with an awareness of the absurdist political/religious/economic histories we accumulate as a civilization in a never-ending current.&lt;ref name="oxfordartonline.com"/&gt;  Following the legacies of [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[John Cage]], she works to narrow the gap between “art” and “life”.  Lemieux's works resist the traps of a “signature style,” and she has referred to her shows looking more like group shows rather than a single artist's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Amalfitano|first1=Lelia|last2=Hoos Fox|first2=Judith|title=The Strange Life of Objects: The Art of Annette Lemieux|date=2010|publisher=Krannert Art Museum and Kinkead Pavilion|location=Seattle, WA|isbn=978-1-883015-45-9|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work surprises us, challenges her audience to keep up, and resists the conformity of the brand.  As stated by Peggy Phelan, “For Lemieux, the art object offers her thoughts and feelings a way to travel . . . Art is her way of responding, both publicly and intimately, to the ongoing predicament of our lives”.&lt;ref&gt;Lemieux, Annette, Lelia Amalfitano, Judith H. Fox, Rosetta Brooks, Peggy Phelan, Robert Pincus-Witten, and Lucy Flint-Gohlke. The Strange Life of Objects: The Art of Annette Lemieux. Champaign, Ill: Krannert Art Museum and Kinkead Pavilion, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lemieux works from a repertoire of real objects and images from films and books featuring reproductions of historical photographs from the forties and fifties, which she calls her “landscape.” Her practice reflects a deep commitment to content and well as process, incorporating intellectual analyses of social codes with an emphasis on psychological and emotional content. Fundamentally interdisciplinary in content and form, Lemieux’s work is a continual exploration and explication of our cultural constructs and how objects that reflect the self define the self within the culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kam.illinois.edu/pr/lemieux/index.html|title=Traveling Exhibitions – Krannert Art Museum|website=www.kam.illinois.edu|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In her review of Lemieux's major retrospective "The Strange Life of Objects," Elizabeth Michelman explains that, "[In] addressing her content-laden material systematically, not sentimentally, Lemieux places objects and images in predicaments that are highly structured and memorable. In both two- and three-dimensional formats, she appropriates and wittily recontextualizes furnishings, texts and photographs rescued from history, popular culture and personal records."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artscopemagazine.com/asdyn/index.wr?is=32&amp;a=2|title=Elizabeth Michelman. "The Strange Life of Objects: The Art of Annette Lemieux." artscope New England.|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her recent show entitled ''Unfinished Business'' at the [[Carpenter Center]], Harvard University, Lemieux explored the territory between object, mediated memory, personal experience and cultural history that has informed her practice for three decades.  Lemieux’s objects and imagery derive directly from the world as it exists, not from the recesses of a private imagination that must search itself to produce the substance of invented images.
With representative examples of her work in over 50 public collections, Lemieux has been the focus of two recent exhibitions organized by the [[Krannert Art Museum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kam.illinois.edu/pr/lemieux/checklist.cfm.html|title=Traveling Exhibitions - Krannert Art Museum|website=www.kam.illinois.edu|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Harvard University.

==Collections==
Lemieux's work can be found in the permanent collections of numerous art museums, including [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York; [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art|Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York; [[The Whitney Museum of American Art|Whitney Museum of American Art]]; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Hirshhorn Museum, Washington;  [[Walker Art Center]], Minneapolis;  [[Yale University Art Gallery]], New Haven; Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University; Worcester Art Museum, Worcester MA; [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts Boston]]; The Art Institute Chicago, as well as many other museums throughout the world. Additionally, she has received awards and grants from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Museum]], the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, as well as other institutions. In 2009,  received an honorary Doctorate in Fine Arts from [[Montserrat College of Art]] as well.&lt;ref name=Harvard&gt;{{cite web|title=Annette Lemieux- Senior Lecturer on Visual and Environmental Studies|url=http://www.ves.fas.harvard.edu/lemieux.html|publisher=[[Harvard University]]|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ashley''''' is a 2013 film directed by Dean Ronalds.

== Plot summary ==
Ashley Collins ([[Nicole Fox]]) a 17-year-old high school student is sitting smoking in a park playing with her gold lighter, then she deliberately burns her hand using the lit cigarette. Later she has an appointment with the school [[therapist]] Vincent ([[Tom Malloy]]) who sees the burn and questions how it happened but she refuses to talk. During class she begins to fantasize about kissing the Red Headed Girl (Mallory Moye) who is sitting in the front row. After class, the girl approaches Ashley asking why she is always looking at her during class and calls her weird. As she is leaving, a boy named Steve approaches her, but she ignores him and leaves.

At home, Ashley has a fight with her mother Stacy Collins ([[Jennifer Taylor (actress)|Jennifer Taylor]]) because Vincent had called her and requested she take Ashley to group therapy at the hospital. Ashley attends the group therapy sessions, but refuses to participate in the discussion. Things become worse when one member becomes aggressive and is dragged away by hospital attendants. Ashley returns to the park to smoke where she meets Vickey (Danielle Morrow), who asks for a smoke. Asking if her lighter is real gold, Vickey suggests that she should try to scratch it like in the movies. Ashley hands Vickey her [[switchblade]]. Impressed, Vickey invites Ashley to her house. Vickey tells Ashley she can contact her under the username "SapphoGirl13" on her computer. Vickey and Ashley begin kissing when Vickey notices [[Self-harm|cuts]] along Ashley’s wrists. Ashley becomes [[Turn-on|turned on]] when Vickey touches her wrists, but Vickey becomes disturbed when Ashley wants to use the switchblade and asks her to leave. At home, Ashley contacts Vickey on her computer using the alias "HomeStarch99" and they begin to have [[cybersex]] however Ashley quickly becomes uninterested, turns off the computer and cuts herself instead.

With the group therapy not working, Vincent informs Ashley and Stacy that a social worker will visit them. Stacy threatens to confiscate Ashley’s computer, but eventually lets her keep it after she begs her not to take it. The next day at the park, Ashley meets Randall ([[Luke Eberl]]) and the Red Headed Girl from her class in a car [[Alcohol consumption|drinking]]. They invite Ashley to join them and the girl begins to give Ashley alcohol using [[mouth-to-mouth resuscitation|mouth to mouth]] and then offers to reward her with a kiss every time she takes a drink. Initially starting off well, the girl becomes angry when Ashley scratches her nails hard onto her back and they ask her to get out of the car. Ashley is waiting at a [[bus stop]] to return home when she meets Chico (Brennan Murray) after talking to her. She does not reply so he decides to try holding her hand and she does not resist. Arriving home, she meets Stacy’s new boyfriend Bill ([[Michael Madsen]]) and instantly does not like him. After an awkward meal, she retreats to her room and proceeds to play loud music to distract her from the sexual sounds coming from her mother’s room. She goes on her computer and begins to chat with "Candid33," a 33-year-old woman called Candice (Nicole Buehrer). They exchange phone numbers and talk about their hobbies.

The social worker arrives to meet Ashley and Stacy, however, Stacy becomes angry when she feels that she thinks Stacy is a bad mother. Ashley leaves for school and meets Chico again at the bus stop. He once again tries to hold hands, but this time she refuses. When he asks why, she tells him she [[lesbian|likes girls]]. Chico becomes angry and leaves. At school, Ashley goes to her appointment with Vincent who decides to try a new approach, but Ashley is reminded of her dad who had died years before and she begins to cry. Ashley reveals her dad Michael Collins (Bill Lippincott) hurt her, but before going into detail, the session ends and she gets up and leaves for class. After class, she again meets Steve who asks her out, but is rejected. Ashley is at home watching TV when Stacy and Bill come home from the market, but Stacy has to go back because she forgot her [[debit card]]. Alone in the house with Ashley, Bill sits next to her and tries to initiate a conversation. Continually ignored, Bill forces a kiss on Ashley just as Stacy returns home. Stacy kicks Bill out of the house and questions Ashley on what was happening. But when Ashley won't talk, Stacy slaps her and sends her to her room. Ashley sits on her bed, takes out her switchblade and cuts her wrists. As she watches the blood coming from her wrists, she decides to call Candice and they proceed to have [[phone sex]].

At school, Carly (Deanna Moore), Sammy (Anne Elisabeth) and Summer (Reid Cox) invite Ashley to join them skipping class. However, when they are outside the school, the three girls all attack Ashley because she is a lesbian. The social worker returns, this time speaking to Stacy in private. Still initially unwilling to answer and questions, she eventually breaks down crying and reveals that Ashley’s dad Michael [[Child sexual abuse|sexually abused]] Ashley when she was a child.

After school, Steve once again approaches Ashley who again ignores him and enters the women’s bathroom. Angry at constantly being rejected, Steve follows her into the bathroom and forces a kiss on her, however she retaliates by biting his lip. Enraged, he throws her to the ground and begins to [[rape|force himself on her]] when she slashes his chest with the switchblade and runs away. Ashley goes to meet Candice at her house. Ashley is initially very shy, so Candice decides that to break the awkward silence, they should get dressed up and go out for dinner. Their date is a success and Candice even manages to get Ashley to smile, something she almost never does. Returning to Candice's house, they meet her roommate Clair (Sarah Schreiber) and photographer Laura (Ilea Matthews). After introducing themselves to each other, Laura asks Ashley if she could take some pictures of her. Ashley is having fun until they notice the scars on her wrists and she once again becomes silent. However, she gets her confidence back when Laura reveals she also used to cut her wrists. That night, Ashley and Candice spend the night together.

In the morning, Candice points out that Ashley should leave or she will be late for her train. Ashley becomes disheartened however Candice quickly reassures her that she does want to continue their relationship together. When Ashley arrives home, she finds Stacy waiting up for her and worrying where she had been, After talking together, they are finally able to reconcile their relationship. Back at school, Ashley has her appointment with Vincent as usual and he is surprised to see her happy and smiling for the first time. On the way home, she meets Chico again and they decide to be friends again. That night, Ashley goes to her room and merrily calls Candice.

Kopple grew up on a vegetable farm in [[Scarsdale, New York]], the daughter of a textile executive.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theattic.space/home-page-blogs/2018/2/23/back-to-harlan-county-usa|title=BACK TO "HARLAN COUNTY, USA"|work=The Attic|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She studied psychology at [[Northeastern University]], where she opted to make her first film instead of writing a term paper for a clinical psychology course.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC14folder/KoppleInt.html|title=text template|website=www.ejumpcut.org|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This experience began Kopple's interest in filmmaking. Kopple's political involvement started in college with her participation in antiwar protests against the Vietnam War.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1977/4/21/a-talk-with-barbara-kopple-pyou/|title=A Talk With Barbara Kopple {{!}}

== Career ==
Kopple attended the [[School of Visual Arts]] soon thereafter, where Kopple met documentary filmmakers [[Albert and David Maysles]] through a classmate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She would assist them on their documentary ''[[Salesman (1969 film)|Salesman]]'', before doing camera work for their film on the Rolling Stones, ''[[Gimme Shelter (1970 film)|Gimme Shelter]]''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Reflecting on her time working with the Maysles, Kopple said “the wonderful thing about working for Alan and David Maysles was that they were the first company that treated women as equals...everybody attended all the meetings; everybody's opinion was important.”&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.documentary.org/feature/politics-and-passion-barbara-kopples-american-dream|title=Of Politics and Passion: Barbara Kopple's American Dream|date=1991-12-01|work=International Documentary Association|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She subsequently worked as an editor, camera operator, and sound operator on numerous documentaries before starting production on ''Harlan County, USA'' in 1972. 

=== Harlan County, USA ===
Kopple first became aware of the plights of the Appalachia miners while studying at Northeastern University.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1972, Kopple started up her own production company, Cabin Creek Films. It was during this time that miners walked off the job in Harlan County,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and Kopple began the filming Miners for Democracy movement led by Arnold Miller. When Tony Boyle was ousted from the union leadership and miners began striking for union recognition, Kopple moved to Harlan with a crew of five&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and a loan of $12,000.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Citation|last=The Canadian Press|title=How Barbara Kopple funded her first Oscar-winning documentary|date=2018-05-03|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMbvhZgKg3Y|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kopple and her crew lived with the miners, filming even when they ran out of film because the presence of a camera “kept down violence.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The film took four years to make and costed over $200,000.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Continuing production was financially demanding on Kopple and her small crew, who regularly moved back-and-forth between Harlan and New York to collect financial backing from grant proposals and odd jobs, even writing letters for money from miners’ homes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When she ran out of money, Kopple would “come back to New York and take whatever job I could, editing, sound, until I got enough to go back.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Kopple also accepted donated money from her parents, friends and others in order to continue financing the project; she eventually placed herself into great debt for the film, utilizing her personal credit card for many expenses.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Kopple was threatened by mine owners during filming, being told that “if I was ever caught alone at night I'd be killed.”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; She reportedly carried two pistols while filming in Harlan.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

''Harlan County, USA'' debuted at the New York Film Festival in October, 1976, where it received a standing ovation. The film would go on to win the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, Kopple accepting the award “on behalf of the miners of Harlan County who took us into their homes, trusted us, and shared their love with us.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

After ''Harlan County, USA'', Kopple wouldn't officially finish another documentary until 1990. Kopple instead would take her political focus on unions to television, directing the 90-minute television drama ''Keeping On''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1983/02/08/stark-keeping-on/0b584e13-b5db-4b12-8001-c0e9505d0461/?utm_term=.13fefa6a7467|title=Stark 'Keeping On'|last=Kernan|first=Michael|date=February 8, 1983|website=Washington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American Dream ===
Kopple's next feature-length documentary would capture the rise and fall of a two-year-long workers strike against Hormel Foods. Kopple was first turned onto the subject matter in the early 1980s while working on starting a different documentary project. While driving in Worthington, Minn., Kopple heard a new radio broadcast on developing strikes amongst workers in meatpacking plants of Austin. Kopple reportedly started driving towards Austin immediately; “that was the beginning,” said Kopple, “And I never left."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.austindailyherald.com/2010/08/%E2%80%98american-dream%E2%80%99-still-rings-true-today/|title=‘American Dream’ still rings true today - Austin Daily Herald|date=2010-08-14|work=Austin Daily Herald|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''American Dream'' proved to be even more difficult for Kopple to produce than ''Harlan County, USA,'' despite her previous documentary's success.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdalCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT98&amp;lpg=PT98&amp;dq=The+subject+matter+of+the+film+also+made+it+difficult+to+get+funding,+because+it+was+the+Reagan+era+and+nobody+seemed+interested+in+workers+and+unions+any+more+kopple&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3privcycxA&amp;sig=yvkBX5RcGTmx-NOTg7on5AOrM4A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjthfyK-vPeAhWhh1QKHZiBBkwQ6AEwAHoECAsQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20subject%20matter%20of%20the%20film%20also%20made%20it%20difficult%20to%20get%20funding,%20because%20it%20was%20the%20Reagan%20era%20and%20nobody%20seemed%20interested%20in%20workers%20and%20unions%20any%20more%20kopple&amp;f=false|title=Barbara Kopple: Interviews|last=Brown|first=Gregory|date=2015-10-14|publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi|isbn=9781626745698|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Budget for the film was tight,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; and Kopple found it difficult to obtain funding due to its subject matter.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Unlike ''Harlan County'', which had Kopple very much on one side of the battle, Kopple intentionally aimed to be much more objective in depicting the differing perspectives of the Hormel Strike in ''American Dream''. “I cared about the people in Austin, Minn., very much,” Kopple reflected, “but if we were ever to look back at [the film], we had to have the full story.”&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

''American Dream'' premiered at the New York Film Festival on October 6, 1990. It would eventually earn Kopple her second Academy Award the following year. Kopple continued to exclusively make documentaries for nearly the next decade and a half, exploring new subject matters such as crime procedurals and the lives of celebrities. 

=== 2004 - Present ===
Her first non-documentary feature film to play in theaters, [[Havoc (2005 film)|''Havoc'']], starred [[Anne Hathaway]] and [[Bijou Phillips]] as wealthy suburbanites who venture into [[East Los Angeles (region)|East Los Angeles]] Latino gang territory, and was released straight to [[DVD]] in 2005. Kopple has recently ventured into advertising work that includes documentary-style commercials for [[Target Stores]]. 

She was also among the 19 filmmakers who worked together anonymously (under the rubric [[Winterfilm Collective]]) to produce the film [[Winter Soldier (film)|''Winter Soldier'']], an anti-war documentary about the [[Winter Soldier Investigation]]. She has also done films for The Working Group, directing the 30-minute short documentary ''Locked Out in America: Voices From Ravenswood'' for the ''We Do the Work'' series. (''We Do the Work'' aired in the mid-1990s on the [[PBS]] television series "[[P.O.V.]]", and Kopple's segment was based on the book ''[[Ravenswood: The Steelworkers' Victory and the Revival of American Labor]]''.)

In the fall of 2006, she released a documentary, ''[[Dixie Chicks: Shut Up and Sing]]'', about the [[Dixie Chicks]]' [[George W. Bush]]-related controversy.

In 2012 Kopple released two films. One is about [[Mariel Hemingway]], the granddaughter of [[Ernest Hemingway]], and the other is concerning the 150th Anniversary of ''[[The Nation]]'' magazine. The film on Hemingway, ''[[Running from Crazy]]'', was shown at the 2013 [[Sundance Film Festival]] and on the [[Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel)|Oprah Winfrey Network]].

In 2014 the UK's ''[[Sight and Sound]]'' magazine published a "Greatest Documentaries of All Time" list, in which Kopple's film ''[[Harlan County, USA]]'' (1976) was ranked 24th, tied with two other movies.&lt;sup&gt;[3][4]&lt;/sup&gt;

When beginning to make the film ''Harlan County, USA'' Kopple was promised a $9,000 grant then was later denied. This happened countless times before she eventually secured the necessary funds. The moving image collection of Barbara Kopple is held at the Academy Film Archive, which preserved ''Harlan County, USA''.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;    

== Style and Themes ==
Kopple's documentaries are in the style of [[Cinéma vérité|cinema vérité]]. Reflecting on her documentaries in 1991, Kopple said “...the kind of films that influenced me have more to do with watching people, letting scenes come alive so you actually see people change through the course of the film...almost like you're right there.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Her work typically consist of observational footage, minimal voice-overs and intimate interviews with her subjects. She has listed the Maysle brothers and [[D. A. Pennebaker|D.A. Pennebacker]] as notable influences on her technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/features/barbara-kopple-reflects-on-harlan-county-usa-documentary-1201547157/|title=Barbara Kopple Reflects on Joys and Dangers of Filming ‘Harlan County, USA’|last=Gaydos|first=Steven|date=2015-07-24|work=Variety|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; “I absolutely loved [''[[Dont Look Back|Don't Look Back]]''] because he got so close to Dylan,” Kopple said of Pennebacker, “I wanted to make films that were as intimate as that.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Kopple's work is often politically-driven. She has made several films on U.S. labor issues, as well as worker's unions, and has been a longtime advocate for the American labor movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-03-15/entertainment/ca-6818_1_strike-union-label-barbara-kopple|title=MOVIES :  Without the Union Label :  Barbara Kopple told the story of 'Harlan County, USA' in black-and-white terms, but with 'American Dream,' about a strike that put a union local in conflict with its international, as well as the company, the coloring is gray|last=McKENNA|first=KRISTINE|date=1992-03-15|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of her documentaries revolve around political subject matters, but her more recent work has taken a shift towards music documentary and celebrity portraiture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://povmagazine.com/articles/view/aint-that-america-the-films-of-barbara-kopple|title=Ain’t that America: The Films of Barbara Kopple – Point of View Magazine|website=povmagazine.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For her documentaries Kopple works in small crews of 2 to 5, almost always acting as her own sound operator.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

[[File:The Bard.jpg|thumb|''The Bard'' (ca. 1817), by [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]]]]
In medieval [[Gaels|Gaelic]] and [[Britons (historical)|British]] culture, a '''bard''' was a professional [[Storytelling|story teller]], verse-maker and music composer, employed by a patron (such as a monarch or noble), to commemorate one or more of the patron's ancestors and to praise the patron's own activities.

Originally a specific, lower class of poet, contrasting with the higher rank known as ''[[fili]]'' in Ireland and Highland Scotland, with the decline of living [[bardic tradition]] in the modern period the term "bard" acquired generic meanings of an author or [[minstrel]], especially a famous one. For example, [[William Shakespeare]], and [[Rabindranath Tagore]], are known as "the Bard of Avon" and "the Bard of Bengal" respectively.&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionary of English"&gt;Oxford Dictionary of English&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Work of Rabindranath Tagore celebrated in London - BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-33543786|website=BBC News|accessdate=15 July 2015|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Beowulf - Beardna.jpg|thumb|left|230px|'Beardna,' a loanword of Celtic origin]]
The word is a Celtic [[loan word]] from [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''bàrd'', Irish ''bard'', Welsh ''bardd''. In 16th-century Scotland, it was a derogatory term for an [[wikt:itinerant|itinerant]] musician; nonetheless it was later romanticised by Sir [[Walter Scott]].&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionary of English"/&gt;

==Origin==
In medieval [[Gaels|Gaelic]] and [[Wales|Welsh]] society, a ''bard'' ([[Scottish Gaelic|Scottish]] and Irish Gaelic) or ''bardd'' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]) was a professional poet, employed to compose [[Eulogy|eulogies]] for his [[lord]] (see [[Planxty#Etymology|planxty]]). If the employer failed to pay the proper amount, the bard would then compose a satire (c.f. ''[[fili]]'', ''[[fáith]]''). In other Indo-European societies, the same function was fulfilled by [[skald]]s, [[rhapsode]]s, [[minstrel]]s and ''[[scop]]s'', among others. A hereditary caste of professional poets in [[Proto-Indo-European society]] has been reconstructed by comparison of the position of poets in medieval Ireland and in ancient India in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Litchfield West, ''Indo-European poetry and myth'', Oxford University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-19-928075-9}}, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bards (who are not the same as the Irish 'filidh' or 'fili') were those who sang the songs recalling the tribal warriors' deeds of bravery as well as the genealogies and family histories of the ruling strata among [[Celt]]ic societies. The pre-Christian Celtic peoples recorded no written histories; however, Celtic peoples did maintain an intricate oral history committed to memory and transmitted by bards and filid. Bards facilitated the memorisation of such materials by the use of [[Metre (poetry)|metre]], [[Rhyme#Function of rhyme|rhyme]] and other formulaic poetic devices.

One of the most notable bards in Irish Mythological was [[Amergin Glúingel]], he was bard, druid and judge for the [[Milesians (Irish)|Milesians]].

==History==

===Ireland===
{{expand section|date=April 2014}}
{{See also|Bardic poetry}}
In medieval Ireland, bards were one of two distinct groups of poets, the other being the ''[[fili]]''. According to the [[Early Irish law]] text on status, ''[[Uraicecht Becc]]'', bards were a lesser class of poets, not eligible for higher poetic roles as described above. However, it has also been argued that the distinction between ''filid'' (pl. of ''fili'') and bards was a creation of Christian Ireland, and that the ''filid'' were more associated with the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/articles/onbards.html|title=On Bards, And Bardic Circles|website=www.pbm.com|access-date=2017-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Breatnach"&gt;Breatnach, Liam. ''[[Uraicecht na Ríar]]'', ca. p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- this should have some publication data or a URḶ if at all possible --&gt; By the Early Modern Period, these names came to be used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bergin|first1=Osborn|title=Irish Bardic Poetry|publisher=Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies|location=Dublin|pages=3–5|url=http://www.ucc.ie/celt/bardic.html|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish bards formed a professional hereditary [[caste]] of highly trained, learned poets. The bards were steeped in the history and traditions of [[clan]] and country, as well as in the technical requirements of a verse technique that was [[Syllabic verse|syllabic]] and used [[assonance]], [[half rhyme]] and [[alliteration]], among other conventions. As officials of the court of king or chieftain, they performed a number of official roles. They were [[chronicle]]rs and [[Satire|satirists]] whose job it was to praise their employers and damn those who crossed them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://irishempire.org/news/travel-roots/druids-filid-bards-custodians-of-celtic-tradition/25|title=Druids, Filid &amp; Bards: Custodians of Celtic Tradition|last=Empire|first=Irish|website=irishempire.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was believed that a well-aimed bardic satire, ''glam dicenn'', could raise boils on the face of its target.

The bardic system lasted until the mid-17th century in Ireland and the early 18th century in Scotland. In Ireland, their fortunes had always been linked to the Gaelic aristocracy, which declined along with them during the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|Tudor Reconquest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.historyireland.com/early-modern-history-1500-1700/divided-gaels-gaelic-cultural-identities-in-scotland-and-ireland-c-1200-c-1650/|title=Divided Gaels: Gaelic cultural identities in Scotland and Ireland c. 1200–c. 1650|date=2013-02-22|work=History Ireland|access-date=2017-07-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early history of the bards can be known only indirectly through mythological stories. The first mention of the bardic profession in Ireland is found in the [[Lebor Gabála Érenn|Book of Invasions]], in a story about the Irish colony of [[Tuatha De Danann]] (Peoples of Goddess Danu), also called Danonians. They became the ''[[aos sí]]'' (folk of the mound), comparable to Norse ''[[alfr]]'' and British [[fairy]]. During the tenth year of the reign of the last Belgic monarch, the people of the colony of Tuatha De Danann, as the Irish called it, invaded and settled in Ireland. They were divided into three tribes—the tribe of Tuatha who were the nobility, the tribe of De who were the priests (those devoted to serving God or De) and the tribe of Danann, who were the bards. This account of the Tuatha De Danann must be considered legendary; however the story was an integral part of the oral history of Irish bards themselves.

===Scotland===
{{Further information|MacMhuirich bardic family}}
The best-known group of bards in Scotland were the members of the MacMhuirich family, who flourished from the 15th to the 18th centuries. The family was centred in the [[Hebrides]], and claimed descent from a 13th-century Irish bard who, according to legend, was exiled to Scotland. The family was at first chiefly employed by the [[Lords of the Isles]] as poets, lawyers, and physicians.&lt;ref name="Clancy-453"/&gt; With the fall of the Lordship of the Isles in the 15th century, the family was chiefly employed by the [[Scottish clan chief|chiefs]] of the [[Clan Macdonald of Clanranald|MacDonalds of Clanranald]].

A number of bards in [[Welsh mythology]] have been preserved in [[medieval Welsh literature]] such as the [[Red Book of Hergest]], the [[White Book of Rhydderch]], the [[Book of Aneirin]] and the [[Book of Taliesin]]. The bards [[Aneirin]] and [[Taliesin]] may be legendary reflections of historical bards active in the 6th and 7th centuries.
Very little historical information about [[Dark Age Wales|Dark Age Welsh]] court tradition survives, but the Middle Welsh material came to be the nucleus of the [[Matter of Britain]] and [[Arthurian legend]] as they developed from the 13th century. The (Welsh) Laws of Hywel Dda, originally compiled around 900 A.D, identify a bard as a member of a king's household. His duties, when the bodyguard were sharing out booty, included the singing of the sovereignty of Britain—possibly why the genealogies of the British high kings survived into the written historical record.

The royal form of bardic tradition ceased in the 13th century, when the 1282 [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I|Edwardian conquest]] permanently ended the rule of the Welsh princes. The legendary suicide of ''The Last Bard'' (c. 1283), was commemorated in the poem ''[[The Bards of Wales]]'' by the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] poet [[János Arany]] in 1857, as a way of encoded resistance to the suppressive politics of his own time. However, the poetic and musical traditions were continued throughout the Middle Ages, e.g., by noted 14th-century poets [[Dafydd ap Gwilym]] and [[Iolo Goch]]. The tradition of regularly assembling bards at an [[eisteddfod]] never lapsed, and was strengthened by formation of the [[Gorsedd]] by [[Iolo Morganwg]] in 1792, establishing Wales as the major Celtic upholder of bardic tradition in the 21st century. Many regular ''eisteddfodau'' are held in Wales, including the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]] which was instituted in 1861 and has been held annually since 1880. Many Welsh schools conduct their own annual versions at which bardic traditions are emulated.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., [http://stjulians.realsmartcloud.com/our-eisteddfod/ Our Eisteddfod] at St Julian's School, Newport, 19 March 2013. Accessed 20 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The musical and poetic traditions of the Welsh bards are perpetuated by the [[Gorsedd|Gorsedd of bards]] and through the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]] (''Eisteddfod Genedlaethol Cymru'').

From its frequent use in Romanticism, 'The Bard' became attached as a title to various  poets,
* 'The Bard of Armagh' is [[Martin Hearty]]
* 'The Bard of Avon,' 'The Immortal Bard' (or in England, simply 'The Bard') is [[William Shakespeare]]
* 'The Bard of Ayrshire' (or in Scotland, simply 'The Bard') is [[Robert Burns]]
* 'The Bard of Bengal' is [[Rabindranath Tagore]]
* 'The Bard of Olney' is [[William Cowper]]
* 'The Bard of Rydal Mount' is [[William Wordsworth]]
* 'The Bard of Salford' is [[John Cooper Clarke]]
* 'The Bard of Twickenham' is [[Alexander Pope]]
* Australian [[bush poet]]s such as [[Henry Lawson]] and [[Banjo Paterson]] are referred to as "bush bards"
* [[Bob Dylan]], [[Jim MacCool]] and the band [[Blind Guardian]] have also been termed 'bards'

From its Romanticist usage, the notion of the bard as a minstrel with qualities of a priest, magician or seer also entered the [[fantasy]] genre in the 1960s to 1980s, for example as the 'Bard' class (Dungeons &amp; Dragons),"Bard" class (Pathfinder RPG - Paizo), ''Bard'' by [[Keith Taylor (author)|Keith Taylor]] (1981), ''[[Bard: The Odyssey of the Irish]]'' by [[Morgan Llywelyn]] (1984), and in video games in fantasy settings such as ''[[The Bard's Tale (1985 video game)|The Bard's Tale]]'' (1985).

The '''Bartholdi Fountain''' is a monumental public [[fountain]], designed by [[Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi]], who later created the [[Statue of Liberty]]. The fountain was originally made for the [[1876 Centennial Exposition]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], and is now located at the corner of [[Independence Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Independence Avenue]] and First Street, [[Southwest, Washington, D.C.|SW]], in the [[United States Botanic Garden]], on the grounds of the [[United States Capitol]], in [[Washington D.C.]].&lt;ref name=siris&gt;[https://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=1J02H177103Y5.5404&amp;menu=search&amp;aspect=Keyword&amp;npp=50&amp;ipp=20&amp;spp=20&amp;profile=ariall&amp;ri=1&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;index=.TW&amp;term=Bartholdi+Fountain+&amp;aspect=Keyword&amp;x=12&amp;y=14 "The Bartholdi Fountain, (sculpture)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916235543/https://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=1J02H177103Y5.5404&amp;menu=search&amp;aspect=Keyword&amp;npp=50&amp;ipp=20&amp;spp=20&amp;profile=ariall&amp;ri=1&amp;source=%257E%2521siartinventories&amp;index=.TW&amp;term=Bartholdi+Fountain+&amp;aspect=Keyword&amp;x=12&amp;y=14|date=2012-09-16}}.

== History ==
[[File:Bartholdi fountain, by Centennial Photographic Co..png|thumb|left|Stereoscopic albumen print of the Bartholdi fountain, by Centennial Photographic Co., 1876, from the [[New York Public Library]] ]]

The '''''Fountain of Light and Water''''',&lt;ref name=usbg /&gt;  commonly called  the Bartholdi fountain, was created for the 1876 Philadelphia Exposition which celebrated the 100th birthday of the United States.  It was designed by French sculptor [[Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi]], and it was cast by the Durenne foundry in France, which had won awards for its cast-iron fountains at earlier international expositions in 1862, 1867 and 1873.&lt;ref&gt;Frances R. Kowsky, ''The Bartholdi Fountain: A Model for All Our Cities'', Gazette des Beaux Arts, sec. 6, volume 94, December 1979. pp. 231-237.&lt;/ref&gt; Bartholdi offered the fountain to the Exposition for free; he intended to sell it afterwards, and to sell others of the same design to other cities. The fountains stood at the center of the esplanade, near the main entrance to the exposition.

When the exposition ended in 1877, Bartholdi did not find any buyers for his fountain. One year later it was purchased by the United States Congress, which offered him only six thousand dollars, half the sum he had originally asked. In 1878, it was placed at the base of Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.   In 1926 it was removed and stored to facilitate completion of the [[George Gordon Meade Memorial]], and for landscaping improvements around the Grant Memorial.&lt;ref name=siris /&gt;  In 1932, the sculpture was placed at its current location in the [[United States Botanic Garden]], on the grounds of the [[United States Capitol]],&lt;ref name=usbg&gt;{{cite web|title=Bartholdi Park|url=http://www.usbg.gov/bartholdi-park|work=United States Botanic Garden|publisher=Architect of the Capitol|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Bartholdi Fountain in Washington, D.C. 2012.JPG|thumb|The restored Bartholdi Fountain in Washington, D.C., 2012]]

In 2008 the Architect of the Capitol began a complete restoration of the fountain and its basin, the first complete deconstruction and restoration since 1927. The restoration repaired deterioration to the metals inside and out, and also provided modern pumps and motors, a new water treatment and filtration system, and a zinc coating to preserve the original cast-iron of the fountain.   The fountain was returned to [[Bartholdi Park]] in spring 2011.&lt;ref name=aoc&gt;{{cite web|title=Bartholdi Fountain and Park|url=http://www.aoc.gov/capitol-buildings/bartholdi-fountain-and-park|work=Explore Capitol Hill|publisher=Architect of the Capitol|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==

The fountain is composed of a series of basins, supported by sculptures of classical figures. The cast iron is coated with bronze, stands thirty feet high, and weighs thirty thousand pounds.  It stands in the center of a large circular marble pool. 

Three figures of women, standing on a triangle pedestal with an ornamental design of seas shells and three reptiles spouting water, support the lower cast iron vasque, which is adorned with a circle of twelve lamps. In the center, three kneeling tritons support another, smaller and higher vasque. Water spouts from a crown at the top, cascades down into the smaller vasque, and then down into the larger vasque before spilling into the main basin. The cascade of water was illuminated by the gas lamps (later replaced with electric globes), making it one of the first monuments in Washington, D.C. to be lit at night, and therefore a popular evening destination in the 1880s.&lt;ref name=siris /&gt;

{{Distinguish|Taschen Bibliotheca Universalis}}

'''''Bibliotheca universalis''''' (1545&amp;ndash;49) was the first truly comprehensive "universal" listing of all the books of the [[History of printing|first century of printing]]. It was an alphabetical [[bibliography]] that listed all the known books printed in [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], or [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].{{sfn|Eisenstein|1980||p=97–98}}

== ''Bibliotheca'' (1545) ==

The [[Swiss]] scholar [[Conrad Gessner]] started to compile his extensive work on ''Bibliotheca universalis''{{sfn|Gessner|1545}} at the age of 25. He first visited as many of the [[Italy|Italian]] and [[Germany|German]] [[libraries]] as he could find. His motivation was partly a fear of the loss of precious manuscripts, such as the destruction of the library at [[Buda]], by the Turks in 1526.{{sfn|Raven|2004}} He described the project in its title, as involving works "extant and not, ancient and more recent down to the present day, learned and not, published and hiding in libraries".{{sfn|Blair|2010}} He published the completed work in 1545 in Zurich, after some four years of research. At the time, he wrote "In truth I rejoice and thank God because I have finally gotten out of the labyrinth in which I was trapped for almost three years".{{sfn|Norman|2014}}&lt;ref name=Anzovin/&gt; It included his own bio-bibliography.{{sfn|Wellisch|1975}} ''Bibliotheca universalis'' was the first modern bibliography of importance published since the invention of printing,{{sfn|Norman|2014}} and through it, Gessner became known as the "father of bibliography."&lt;ref name=Anzovin/&gt;

The work attempted to be an exhaustive survey of known writing in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, and included approximately three thousand authors {{sfn|Blair|2010}} The authors’ forenames were listed alphabetically according to [[mediaeval]] usage, with a reverse index of their surnames.{{sfn|Norman|2014}}{{sfn|Eisenstein|1980||p=97–98}} It was intended as an index by subject of all known authors. Gessner listed the writers together with the titles of their works, short biographies, and publication details including place of printing, printers and editors. He added his own annotations, comments, and evaluations of the nature and merit of every entry.&lt;ref name=Anzovin/&gt; It included about twelve thousand titles.{{sfn|Wellisch|1975}}{{sfn|Blair|2010}}{{sfn|Norman|2014}}{{sfn|Eisenstein|1980||p=97–98}}

Gessner followed [[Johannes Trithemius]]’s work of placing works in systems of cataloging. Gessner admired Trithemius’s systems and used them as guidelines and templates; however Gessner carried the idea of cataloging and systems a step further. [[Theodore Besterman]], in ''The Beginnings of Systematic Bibliography'',   suggests that Gessner’s work to organize knowledge was the forerunner of [[Francis Bacon]]’s works and other [[encyclopedias]] that followed.{{sfn|Eisenstein|1980||p=97–98}} Though called "universal", it was intended to be selective.{{sfn|Norman|2014}}

== ''Pandectae'' (1548) ==

In 1548, Gessner followed this with a companion thematic index to ''Bibliotheca universalis'', a large [[folio]], ''Pandectarum sive Partitionum universalium Conradi Gesneri Tigurini, medici &amp; philosophiae professoris, libri xxi'' (''Pandectae'').{{efn|From [[Pandectae]], a compendium}}{{sfn|Gessner|1548}}
{{sfn|Norman|2014}} This contained thirty thousand topical entries. Each of these entries were cross-referenced to the appropriate author and book, arranged under headings and sub-headings, which were associated with various branches of learning.{{sfn|Norman|2014}}{{sfn|Eisenstein|1980||p=97–98}}

The ''Pandectae'' had nineteen sections, each devoted to a scholarly discipline and contained dedications to the best scholar printers of Gessner's time. He listed their publications and accomplishments. The planned scope of 21 books was never completed, since part 20 ''De re medica''. was never published, and part 21 ''De theologia Christiana'' was published separately as ''Partitiones theologicae'' in 1549.{{sfn|Blair|2010}} A further supplement ''Appendix bibliothecae'' containing additions previously published separately by [[Lycosthenes]] (1551) and [[Josias Simmler|Simmler]] (1555) appeared in 1555.{{sfn|Wellisch|1975}}

Gessner made full use of any publishers' catalogues and booksellers' lists which were available in the 16th century that were printed when he was doing his research. These included use of printed catalogues supplied by firms like [[Aldus Manutius]] of [[Venice]] and [[Henri Estienne]] of [[Paris]].{{sfn|Wellisch|1975}}

== ''Bibliotheca selecta'' (1593) ==

Gessner's work, with its heterodox principles and advanced [[Protestant]] scholarship was a direct challenge to the authority of the [[Catholic Church]] which soon banned the work in the [[Index librorum prohibitorum]]. The [[Counter Reformation]]'s response took another generation of Catholic scholarship to produce and appeared on the [[Holy See|Vatican]] press in Rome in 1593 under the programmatic title, ''[[Bibliotheca selecta]]''. This updated "Anti-Gessner" was assembled in 18 books covering the bibliography of the traditional scientific disciplines (Theology, 1-11, Law, 12, Philosophy, 13, Medicine, 14) and the liberal arts, 15-18, by the [[Mantuan]] [[Jesuit]] [[humanism|humanist]] and bibliographer [[Antonio Possevino]].{{fact|date=February 2016}}

'''CREW''' is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] performance group, founded in [[Brussels]] in 1991 by [[Eric Joris]]. CREW operates on the border between art and science, between performance art and new technology. Artist [[Eric Joris]] develops his live-art projects in close collaboration with scientists and other artists

CREW's shows range from one-to-one performances, staged performances and [[visual arts]] installations to scientific research set-ups and interventions in public spaces. CREW's work has been presented on stages across Europe, at large public events from Brussels to the [[Shanghai World Expo]], and at scientific conferences in Europe, China and the U.S. In 13 years CREW has immersed thousands of people.

CREW is artistic partner in the EU-funded multidisciplinary research consortium Dreamspace, which develops tools that enable creative professionals to combine live performances, video and computer generated imagery in real time.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

=='AltR'==
CREW creates [[immersion (virtual reality)|immersion]]-based performance and was the first to combine 360° Omni Directional Video (ODV) and [[Head-mounted display]] (HMD) for delivering an 'Alternative Reality' ('AltR'). Unlike sitting and standing [[Virtual Reality]] applications, CREW's work delivers 'AltR' which is anchored in the physical: by moving, walking and running the 'immersant' experiences the virtual world from within his own body. This resulted in the 2004 ''Crash'', a performance piece in which embodiment was a key element. A playful use of real time versus prerecorded material typified the work of this period and turned the 'immersants' into real protagonists. 'Headswap' sessions allowed integration of out-of-body phenomena into performances like ''Double U'' (2008).
''Terra Nova'' gave fifty-five people an immersive experience in the course of a ninety-minute show.

==From CAVE to C.a.p.e.==

In 2000 CREW built a performance [[Cave automatic virtual environment]] large enough to include actors, artists, technicians and an audience of fifty. CREW's inspiration came from a theatre technician, Paul Antipoff, who was paralysed from the neck down and survived through a symbiosis with technology. The [[University of Hasselt]] developed a [[Personal computer|PC]]-driven CAVE, with a [[3D projection|3D]] real-time painting tool, and a robotic leg. Antipoff was able to 'handle' his computer, electric wheelchair and robotic leg with tools attached to his head and mouth. Immersed with the audience in the CAVE, Antipoff started to paint and to interact with a live virtual actor and with the audience.

In 2002 [[Eric Joris]] and Kurt Vanhoutte ([[University of Antwerp]]) wanted to create a medium ‘like a prosthesis’ based upon Joris' work with the paraplegic actor.{{who|date=August 2018}} Eric Joris sought to combine 360° Omni Directional Video (ODV) with a [[Head-mounted display]] (HMD) and a tracking system instead of using computer graphics or ‘virtual reality’ tools (as in Computer Caves). EDM/[[University of Hasselt]] developed not only the camera but the whole system and software around. Their collaboration resulted in immersive performance like ''Crash'',''U'', ''EUX'' and ''Terra Nova''. Their system proved to be ahead of its time and led to many new applications. Ever since Omni Directional Video (360°) grew popular and the [[University of Hasselt]] made a first spin-off, centering on a 16head camerasystem for sports events.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:C.a.p.e.Anima.2014.jpg|thumb|right|400px|''C.a.p.e. Anima'', 2014, CREW_Eric Joris]] --&gt;

Because the live performances were technically, financially and logistically very demanding CREW and EDM/[[University of Hasselt]] developed a new configuration: '''C.a.p.e.''' / Computer Assisted Personal Environment. It is a lightweight version consisting of a backpack with a [[Personal computer|PC]], a [[Head-mounted display]] using prerecorded material for 15 minute walks or experiences of fictional, documentary and musical nature. Premièred at the [[Shanghai World Expo]] in 2010, this participatory format offers a radically new way to engage with a narrative. C.a.p.e. comes in many versions: ''C.a.p.e. Brussels'', ''C.a.p.e. Tohoku'', ''C.a.p.e. KIT'', ''C.a.p.e. Horror'', ''C.a.p.e. Vooruit'' and ''C.a.p.e. Anima''.

A new version of fully navigable 'AltR' (Alternative Reality), making use of lightfield capture is being investigated by CREW and [[University of Hasselt]]/iMinds with the FP7 ICT Dreamspace consortium.

The '''Castle of Alva''' ({{lang-pt|Castelo de Alva}}) is a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[castle]] located in the [[Freguesia (Portugal)|civil parish]] of [[Viade de Baixo e Fervidelas]], in the [[Concelho|municipality]] of [[Freixo de Espada à Cinta]], [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Bragança District|district of Bragança]].

==History==
As part of the [[Kingdom of León|Leonese]] invasion, in June 1212, the first reference to the castle between Freixo de Espada à Cinta and Urros.&lt;ref name="SIPA"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=477 |title=Castelo de Alva (IPA.00000477/PT010404060006) |publisher=SIPA – Sistema de Informação para o Património Arquitectónico |editor=SIPA |location=Lisbon, Portugal |language=Portuguese |first=Ernesto |last=Jana |first2=Marisa |last2=Costa |year=2001 |accessdate=19 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220152317/http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=477 |archivedate=20 December 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1236 it was occupied by Leonese forces with the consent of its habitants.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt; Shortly after, King D. [[Sancho II of Portugal|Sancho II]] donated the place to the municipality of Freixo "como sua aldeia" (''with its village''), ordering the expulsion of the residents who lived there during the Leonese occupation.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt; At the time of the 1258 ''Inquirições'' (''Inquiries'') indicated that King Sancho had transferred the title to Freixo.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

During the reign of King D. [[Denis of Portugal|Dinis]], the municipality of Alva requested that King ''expand its settlement of 400 residents''.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; But, by 1311, in a letter, the King refused the request, owing to opposition from the municipality of Freixo.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

Between 1527 and 1532, the village of Alva was not listed in the ''Numeramento'', suggesting that the settlement no longer existed by the end of the 16th century.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

During the 17th century, António Coelho Gasco, external judge and captain-major of the town of Freixo, described the state of abandonment that the structure, which he referred to as the ''"Antiquario"'' (''antiquary''), during a presentation on his visit to the Archbishop of Braga, D. Rodrigo da Cunha.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; By the end of the same century, Father Carvalho da Costa, referring to the limits of Poiares in the ''Corografia Portuguesa'', included a small list of landmarks; this included the Hermitage of Nossa Senhora de Alva and ''"alongside it the ruined Castle with its walls, where in the past, was founded the Town of Alva"'', remembering that D. Sancho II had deprived the village of its residents.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Continuing, that he:
:''"gave the village to Freixo and later, depopulated and ruined it, remaining only the boat, that navigated the river, with the name of Alva, and the referred Hermitage of Santa Maria, where is annexed a simple benefit of the Royal Patronage"''.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

==Architecture==
The castle is situated in an area of abundant archaeological vestiges; the parish of Poiares is located between the Serra do Marão and Serra de Avões, along the Couro and Douro Rivers in a rural area, situated on a {{convert|700|m|ft}} hilltop dominating the Douro valley.&lt;ref name="IGESPAR"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.patrimoniocultural.pt/pt/patrimonio/patrimonio-imovel/pesquisa-do-patrimonio/classificado-ou-em-vias-de-classificacao/geral/view/72908 |title=Castelo de Alva |publisher=IGESPAR – Instituto de Gestão do Património Arquitectónico e Arqueológico (Portuguese Institute of Architectural and  Archaeological Heritage) |year=2013 |first=A. |last=Martin |accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actually location is covered in vegetation and olive orchards.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

'''''Cauchemar Blanc''''' ([[English language|English]]: '''''White Nightmare''''') is a 1991 [[short film]] by [[Matthieu Kassovitz]], based on the comic written for the screen by [[Jean Giraud|Moebius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cauchemar Blanc|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/518888/White-Nightmare/|publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies|TCM.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
One winter's night in France, four [[racism|racists]], J.P., Berthon, Barjout, and René, set out to [[assault]] a local [[Arab]] man. The four follow him to a [[vacant]] [[parking lot]] outside of an [[apartment building]], but the [[car]] they are in suddenly starts smoking, causing them to crash into a [[phone booth]]. Barjout is knocked [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]], but the others are unharmed. As the remaining three are about to attack the quite fearless (albeit defenseless) Arab, a woman in the building threatens to call the [[police]].

Impersonating a police-officer, J.P. heads into the building to assuage the situation. When an [[Afro-French]] denizen accuses J.P. of lying, he becomes angered and begins insulting him, only to discover that the [[black people|black]] man is a police [[commissioner]]. Meanwhile, Berthon and Rene are keeping watch of the Arab man. When René begins showing off his "skills" with [[nunchucks]], one of the sticks detaches and hits Berthon in the head, knocking him out cold. 

As René tries to resuscitate Berthon, Barjout regains consciousness and decides to investigate what has happened. Upon seeing an apprehended J.P., Barjout threatens the black man at gunpoint. When J.P. tries to tell him that he is a commissioner, Barjout accidentally opens fire and kills J.P. Suddenly, he hears the disembodied voices of Berthon and J.P., and now the Arab man is speaking in René's voice. Barjout awakens, realizing the events were nothing more than a [[nightmare]] he had while waiting in the car. The film ends with the four men beating and presumably killing the helpless Arab man.

'''''Chances: The Women of Magdalene''''' is a 2006 [[documentary film]] produced and directed by [[Tom Neff]], and written by Neff and [[Barry Rubinow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0809417|title=Chances: The Women of Magdalene}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary features the socially conscious organization known as "[[Magdalene program|Magdalene]]," located in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].  The system of recovery practiced at Magdalene is based on the twelve steps and twelve traditions of [[Narcotics Anonymous]].

==Interviews==
* Rev. Becca Stevens—Chaplain of St. Augustine's Chapel at [[Vanderbilt University]]
* Clemmie Greenlee

==Critical reception==
''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine film critic [[Joe Leydon]] lauded the film, and wrote, "Inspiring uplift abounds in ''Chances: The Women of Magdalene,'' a slickly produced but unmistakably sincere docu about a femme Episcopalian priest's outreach program to rehabilitate Nashville prostitutes. Theatrical potential is limited, but pic could find appreciative auds through tube and nonprofit exposure...Pic touches briefly yet respectfully on Rev. Stevens' background and motivation -- she was sexually abused at an early age -- but focuses primarily on her program's clients, who prove remarkably candid while describing past ordeals and future plans. Feisty Clemmie Greenlee emerges as first among equals, and her response to tragedy provides of one the pic's many emotional highlights. High-def video lensing enhances the pic's intimacy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117930693.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0 Leydon, Joe]. ''Variety,'' film review, May 30, 2006. Last accessed: April 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Nashville Scene]]'' film critic Jim Ridley gave the film a more mixed review, and wrote, "The women’s blunt personal stories form the most compelling parts of Tom Neff’s earnest, polished profile, which amounts to promotion for the program and its good works. As documentary, it’s limited: we see very little of the day-to-day life inside the shelters, while a project pairing Magdalene House residents with [[Music Row]] songwriters takes up too much of the movie’s focus—it comes as an intrusion when a son’s funeral turns into a music montage. But the Magdalene women interviewed on camera have fought for their second chances, and the hard-won hope on their faces can make you forgive a lot."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nashvillescene.com/Stories/Cover_Story/2006/04/20/Reel_Nashville_2006/index.shtml Ridley, Jim].

[[Image:Az istvánfalvi templom a dombtetőn.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Church of St. Stephen Harding in Apátistvánfalva]]
The '''Church of St. Stephen Harding in Apátistvánfalva''' or '''Apátistvánfalvian Church''' ({{lang-hu|Apátistvánfalvai Harding Szent István templom,}} {{lang-sl|Cerkev Svetega Štefana v Števanovci}} [[Prekmurje dialect]]: ''Števanovska cerkev Svétoga Števana Hardinga'') is a [[Baroque]] [[Roman Catholic Church]] in the village of [[Apátistvánfalva]] (Števanovci), [[Hungary]]. It is near the Hungarian-Slovenian border, in the [[Vendvidék]] region. Its patron saint [[Stephen Harding]] was an English saint and the founder of the [[Cistercians|Cistercian Order]].

Because this area is traditionally ethnically Slovenian, in the past mass was offered only in [[wends dialect|Prekmurje Slovenian]]. Today mass is offered in Hungarian and in the local Prekmurje Slovenian dialect.

==History of the church==
The church was built in 1785. The bishop of [[Vas]], [[János Szily]], aided in the construction and also supported building a school in the village. The first priest was János Marits. The new parish included Permise (now [[Kétvölgy]]), Börgölin/Újbalázsfalva (now Apátistvánfalva), [[Orfalu]], [[Rábatótfalu]] (now [[Szentgotthárd]]), [[Szakonyfalu]], and sometimes [[Markovci]], now in [[Slovenia]].

By the 12th century, Apátistvánfalva was a Cistercian lordship. In 1183 [[Béla III of Hungary]] founded a Cistercian abbey in [[Szentgotthárd]]. The monks arrived from the [[Trois-Fontaines Abbey]], [[Champagne, France]].

For many years, the [[Hungarian Slovenes]] had attended church in Rábakethely (near Szentgotthárd), [[Felsőszölnök]], or [[Dolenci, Slovenia|Great Dolenci]] (Slovenia). In [[Alsószölnök]] where German, Slovenian and Hungarian people lived, the believers went to [[Sankt Martin an der Raab]] in [[Austria]] (a church was also built in Alsószölnök built in 1816).
[[Image:Az istvánfalvi főoltár az orgonakarzatról nézve.jpg|thumb|right|200px|In the choir]]
[[Image:Istvánfalvi főoltár.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The High Altar (Legend of [[Stephen Harding]]-Mural).]]
Bishop Szily supported masses being offered in the local language ([[Croatian language|Croatian]], the [[Prekmurje dialect]], or [[German language|German]]), and therefore he appointed Marits.

In 2005 [[Jožef Smej]], the bishop of [[Maribor]], and few Hungarian and Slovenian priests blessed a memorial tablet in the church listing the names of Apátistvánfalvian priests and chaplains.

==Building==
The walls of the church are {{Convert|2|m|ft}} thick and it can hold 2,000 people. The baroque murals were created by an unknown painter. The High Altar shows the Legend of St. Stephen Harding. The Trinity is depicted above the mural.

There is an organ in the choir. The organ was made in 1894 and restored in 2007. Prior to the restoration a small organ was used. The steeple has two bells.

Near the church are a school, cemetery, and parish office, war memorial, and statue of the Virgin Mary.

The '''conservation and restoration of textiles''' refers to the processes by which [[textile]]s are cared for and maintained to be [[preservation (library and archival science)|preserved]] from future damage.  The field falls under the category of [[art conservation]] as well as [[Preservation (library and archival science)|library preservation]], depending on the type of collection.  In this case, the concept of textile preservation applies to a wide range of artifacts, including [[tapestry|tapestries]], [[carpet]]s, [[quilt]]s, [[clothing]], [[flag]]s and [[curtain]]s, as well as objects which ‘’contain’’ textiles, such as upholstered [[furniture]], dolls, and accessories such as fans, [[umbrella|parasols]], [[glove]]s and [[hat]]s or [[bonnet (headgear)|bonnets]].  Many of these artifacts require specialized care, often by a professional conservator.  The goal of this article is to provide a general overview of the textile preservation process, and to serve as a jumping-off point for further research into more specialized care.  Always contact a professional conservator if you are unsure of how to proceed in the preservation process.

==Collections==
Historic textile collections can largely be divided into three categories:  [[museum]]s, historic societies/locations, and [[private collection]]s.  The needs of each of these locations will vary.  A private collection, for instance, is less likely to have as high a traffic flow as a museum, and may thus be able to take preservation steps that a working museum cannot (such as keeping lights to a minimum for longer periods of time).  The different venues may also have different problems that arise, such as the fact that many historic homes do not have climate control, and rely strongly on natural light to display their furnishings, both of which may contribute to textile decay.

==Environment==
[[Image:Crochet linen collar damaged.jpg|left|thumb|Deterioration and discoloration due to poor storage on a crocheted linen collar of the 1920s or 1930s.]]
The chief cause for decay in textiles is almost always the environment in which they are stored.  Light, temperature, and humidity can all contribute to a textile’s health or deterioration, depending on their intensity.  Additionally, pests, chemicals, and pollutants may also cause damage to an antique fabric.  Airborne chemicals, such as smog or cigarette smoke are also harmful to the textiles, and should be avoided if at all possible:  high-efficiency air filters should be installed throughout the building to reduce the presence of airborne chemicals that may stain, discolor, or weaken fabrics.

===Light===
[[Light]] can have a variety of effects on textiles over time.  In some cases, it may contribute to fading or discoloration, but of more concern is the damage which the fibers may suffer under prolonged exposure to non-visible light, such as [[ultraviolet]] and [[infrared]] lighting.  Ideally, textiles should be stored or displayed in as little light as possible, and preferably in total darkness.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam and Finch 26&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as this is impractical for display and care of the piece, knowing the limits of lighting as well as the safest amounts of lighting, become important.

[[Sunlight|Natural light]] is the most common source of ultraviolet light, and as such, care should be taken to avoid exposure to direct sunlight at all costs, and indirect sunlight whenever possible.  This may mean storing or displaying textiles in an area without windows, or with blackout curtains, which can be pulled whenever the room is not in use.  If a room relies on natural light, UV screens or coatings can be applied to the windows to block harmful rays while still allowing light to pass through.  These filters should be checked periodically, however, as they have a limited lifespan and may need to be replaced every few years.&lt;ref&gt;Mailand 7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fluorescence|Fluorescent]] and halogen-produced light can also produce large amounts of UV radiation, though filters which fit over the bulbs are available to limit the damaging light.&lt;ref&gt;Mailand and Alig 21&lt;/ref&gt; These filters will need to be replaced when the bulbs are changed, so maintenance staff should be aware of them and their use.

One advantage of fluorescent lights is that they produce little [[heat]], which may also be harmful to textiles.  [[Incandescent light bulb|Incandescent lights]] produce a large amount of heat in addition to large quantities of infrared radiation, which is likewise damaging to the fibers in antique textiles.  If incandescent lights must be used, they should be placed far enough away from display cases that their heat does not affect the contents.&lt;ref&gt;Mailand and Alig 21-22&lt;/ref&gt;  	

In the case of particularly delicate textiles, display organizers might consider [[motion detection|motion-activated]] or timed lighting, or lighting controlled though a visitor-activated switch, which would allow the textiles to remain in darkness when they are not under view.&lt;ref&gt;Mailand and Alig 23&lt;/ref&gt;  All textiles should be displayed on a rotating schedule, allowing them a few months of display, then the rest of the year in dark storage, to prolong their life.

===Climate===

[[Image:Embroidery Victorian Altar Frontal Berkshire.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Damaged [[embroidery|embroidered]] [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[altar frontal]], [[Berkshire]], [[England]].]]
Heat and [[humidity]] can both contribute and a textile’s deterioration.  However, excessive dryness may also cause damage, especially to elastic fibers, such as [[wool]], which rely on some amount of [[moisture]] to maintain their flexibility (Putnam and Finch).  Additionally, [[temperature]] and humidity should be kept as constant as possible; changes in either of these may cause the textile fibers to expand and contract, which, over time, can also cause damage and deterioration to the textile.  For this reason, both storage and display areas should be fitted with [[hygrometer|monitoring equipment]] to gauge the temperature and humidity of rooms, display cases, enclosed storage facilities, and work areas.

Ideally, temperature should be kept around 70 degrees [[Fahrenheit]],&lt;ref name="Fahey"&gt;Fahey&lt;/ref&gt; though some slight fluctuation in either direction is permissible, as long as it occurs gradually.&lt;ref name="Mailand 6"&gt;Mailand 6&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, temperature may be slightly lower in winter to save energy costs, but the change should be effected slowly, so as not to place the fibers under undue stress.

As for humidity, the preservationist or conservator should aim for a relative humidity of 50%, though, as with temperature, some small fluctuation is allowable, as long as it occurs gradually (Mailand).  In enclosed display or storage cases, humidity can be somewhat maintained through the use of [[silica gel]] crystals.  These crystals should not be placed in contact with the textiles, but may be placed in breathable muslin bags and hung inside the case to maintain a constant humidity;&lt;ref name="Mailand 6"/&gt; they should be monitored periodically, however, to be sure that they are working.

In areas where [[HVAC|climate control]] is unavailable (such as in historic buildings), the conservator can still moderate the temperature and relative humidity through use of fans, [[humidifiers]] and [[dehumidifiers]], and portable heating or cooling units.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam and Finch 28&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to temperature and humidity, air flow is also a concern for textile preservation.  Textiles should never be sealed in plastic or other air-tight casing unless it is part of a treatment or cleaning process.  Proper circulation, combined with the suggested humidity, will help to prevent the growth of [[mold]] and [[mildew]], which may [[stain]] or weaken antique textiles.&lt;ref&gt;Mailand 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pests===

Pests are another significant threat to textile collections, as there are a number of creatures which can cause damage to fibres.  Among the most common are [[tineidae|clothes moths]], [[dermestidae|carpet beetles]], [[silverfish]], [[firebrat]]s and rodents.

Clothes moths are attracted to [[protein]] fibres, and so are especially drawn to [[silk]], wool, and [[feather]]s.  An infestation might be identified through the evidence of white [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoon]]s (or the remnants thereof) on the textiles, or of sighting the insects themselves.  They are roughly 8 centimetres long and white in colour.&lt;ref name="Fahey"/&gt;

Like clothes moths, carpet beetles are likewise drawn to proteins, and can be quite destructive.  Evidence of an infestation may take of the form of chewed holes, carcasses, or larvae, which appear as small pale worm-like insects.&lt;ref name="Fahey"/&gt;

Silverfish and firebrats are related insects which consume [[starch]], usually found in [[Sizing#Textile warp sizing|sizing]] or other treatments applied to fabrics, as well as plant-based textiles such as [[linen]] and [[cotton]].  Both are attracted to dark, moist climates, though silverfish prefer cooler temperatures, while firebrats tend towards warmer.  Both are about 12 millimetres in length and either light or dark in colouring, depending on which type is present.&lt;ref name="Fahey"/&gt;

Rodent infestations can be identified in the usual ways, such as seeing droppings, nests, or comparatively large chewed areas of textile where they have caused damage.
	
In all cases, [[chemical]] means of [[pest control]] should be avoided if possible, not only due to harm to humans who come in contact with them, but because the chemicals may cause damage to the very textiles the conservator is trying to save.  For rodents, [[mousetrap|snap traps]] may be effective, and if needed, a professional [[Pest control|exterminator]] should be called.  Poison baited traps should be avoided, as the rodent could die somewhere inaccessible, and provide a breeding ground for further pests.&lt;ref name="Mailand and Alig 27"&gt;Mailand and Alig 27&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, in the case of a rodent infestation, all access points to the room (such as cracks or holes) through which they might be entering should be located and sealed if possible.&lt;ref&gt;Mailand 11&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[insect]]s, keeping clean storage, display, and work environment is the best method of prevention.  Also, sticky [[insect trap|traps]] (replaced often) around doors, windows, and display cases may be useful for monitoring the insect population.  Furthermore, the population of carnivorous insects, such as [[spider]]s, should be observed.  While such insects are not harmful to textiles by themselves, they may indicate another population of insects which are.&lt;ref name="Mailand and Alig 27"/&gt;

If the infestation can be limited to one or a few pieces, the insects may be killed through [[freezing]] of the object.  The textile should be wrapped in plastic and [[vacuum packing|vacuum-sealed]], then brought to a freezing temperature as quickly as possible, to prevent the insects from adjusting to the cold.  The object may be left frozen for several days, but should be brought slowly back up to room temperature to avoid further damage.&lt;ref name="Fahey"/&gt;  Note that while this method should kill adults, it may not destroy any eggs that are present.

If chemical means must be employed, it would be best to consult with a 	professional conservator to be certain that the treatment will not harm the textiles themselves.

Even if no signs of an infestation are present, textiles should still be inspected periodically to be certain that there is no outbreak that has gone unobserved.  Additionally, when dealing with a new acquisition which shows signs of insect damage, the specimen should be [[quarantine]]d until it can be determined whether the insects are still present before introducing it to the rest of the collection.

==Textile instability==
In some cases, the textiles are weakened not by outside causes such as light or pests, but by [[chemical reaction]]s taking place within the fabric itself, such as the [[redox|oxidation]] of iron-based [[mordant]]s over time, which can cause darkening and discolouration in the surrounding fibres.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam and Finch 18&lt;/ref&gt;

One example which is cited frequently throughout the literature is the case of “shattered silk.”  During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, many silk manufacturers treated their fabrics with [[metal]]lic salts (usually containing [[tin]] and [[iron]]) to give them a heavier, more luxurious feel.  However, as these fabrics have aged, the metals in the fibres have accelerated their decay and caused them to become extremely [[brittleness|brittle]].  The shredded or “shattered” effect this causes is the reason for the name.  In this case, the environment of the textile contributes very little to the deterioration from the metallic salts, though exposure to light may accelerate it even further.&lt;ref name="Putnam and Finch 19"&gt;Putnam and Finch 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Textile preservationists should be familiar with their collections and the history and [[provenance]] of their pieces.  Chemical tests can reveal the types of dyes and mordants used, as well as any other treatments applied to the fabric.&lt;ref&gt;Schweppe 153&lt;/ref&gt;  Such knowledge can lead to the prevention of further decay by learning which pieces need to be handled with particular care.

==Handling==

It goes without saying that fragile and/or valuable textiles should be handled with care, and as little as necessary in any given circumstance.  However, should handling be necessary, there are precautions &lt;ref&gt;Taken from Fahey&lt;/ref&gt; which can be taken to ensure the safety of the textile.

Because our hands contain [[oil]]s and [[acid]]s in the [[skin]], clean cloth gloves should be worn when handling textiles.  If gloves are unavailable, then frequent hand-washing should be undertaken to ensure that no damage is caused.  For similar reasons, the working, display, and storage areas should be free of food, drink, and cigarette smoke, which can also stain or damage the fabric.  Finally, to avoid ink stains, only pencils should be used for writing or sketching in the work space.

To avoid snags and pulls, remove any jewelry that may catch in the fabric’s weave, and wear clothing free of large buckles or other objects which may snag the textile.  Long hair should also be tied back to allow a clear view of the working area, even when the head is bent over the table.

When working with the textiles, it should be placed on a clean, flat surface which is larger than the textile itself, so that the whole piece is supported evenly.  Although it is supported, never place anything on top of the textile while it is in the flat position.

When moving the textile, it is important to maintain the flat, even support of the work space.  If the piece is small enough (a [[handkerchief]] or [[sampler (needlework)|sampler]], for instance), it may be placed on an [[acid-free paper|acid-free board]] or similar support and carried as if on a tray.  If the piece is too large for this (a carpet or tapestry, for example), the piece may be rolled around an acid-free tube and carried by two people to its new location.
 
Finally, antique [[costume]]s and clothing should never be worn, as the mere process of putting the clothes on and taking them off will cause damage.   Additionally, the model may not fit the costume precisely&amp;nbsp;– clothing was for a long time made to fit a specific person, not mass-produced in approximate sizes&amp;nbsp;– causing strain where there should be none and slack where there likewise should be none.

==Cleaning==

===Vacuuming===

One of the safest and easiest ways to clean textiles is to [[vacuum cleaner|vacuum]] them.  The fabric is placed on a clean, flat work surface.  If the specimen is particularly delicate, or simply as a precaution, a [[fibreglass]] [[window screen|screen]] edged with [[twill tape]] may be placed over the textile.  The screen allows dirt and [[dust]] to pass through, but prevents individual threads from being pulled loose or unravelled further by the suction.  Using a vacuum attachment and the lowest power setting, move the suction over the screen until the entire area has been cleaned.  If needed, move the screen to a new area and begin again.  Always remember to vacuum both sides of the textile, as dirt may filter through to the other side.&lt;ref name="Putnam and Finch 48"&gt;Putnam and Finch 48&lt;/ref&gt;  Hanging textiles will need to be vacuumed less often than horizontal pieces, as there are fewer places where dust can collect.

===Wet cleaning===

One of the key standards of preservation is that of reversibility:  anything done to preserve a piece should be able to be undone with minimal damage to the piece itself.  Because wet cleaning is a chemical process, it is not reversible, and so should be used only when absolutely necessary.

Before cleaning a textile, certain questions&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Rice, page 32&lt;/ref&gt; should be asked to determine both the best treatment for that particular combination of textile and soil, and to ascertain whether the piece is able to be cleaned, or may sustain damage during the process.

'''What is the chemical composition of the textile?'''  In other words, does it have a high acid content?  Were there chemicals used in its production that might contribute to how it reacts to water?  Or how it may react to cleaning chemicals?

'''What are the characteristics of the fibres?'''  For instance, cotton and linen, being [[fibre crop|plant fibers]], are both stronger wet than dry, and so may be able to withstand a more mechanical stress than something like silk.  Wool can absorb large amounts of water, but mats if washed in high temperatures.  All silks become brittle with age, but weighted silks (see Textile Instability above) decay more quickly, and thus must be handled with extreme care.&lt;ref name="Putnam and Finch 19"/&gt;  Additionally, some silks, once wet, can be permanently spotted.  Learn the basic characteristics of the type of fibres you have, and how they have been treated before undertaking any kind of cleaning.

'''What [[colourant]]s have been used, and how will they react to cleaning?'''  This can apply not only to [[dye]]s but to mordants as well.  Different parts of the world may have different dye processes, so here is where knowledge of when and where a textile originated, as well as a working knowledge of [[chemistry]], can come in handy.  If in doubt as to the wash ability of a dye, apply a drop or two of water to an inconspicuous place and blot with a clean white cloth.  If the dye transfers to the cloth, even in small amounts, the textile should not be washed.&lt;ref name="Mailand 8"&gt;Mailand 8&lt;/ref&gt;
 
'''Are there finishes or surface treatments that must be preserved?'''  For example, is the fabric [[paint]]ed?  If so, it should never be washed; some other cleaning method should be used.&lt;ref name="Putnam and Finch 47"&gt;Putnam and Finch 47&lt;/ref&gt;

'''What kinds of soils are there?'''  The older the stain, the more difficult it is to remove.  After a certain point, it may be best to leave the stain or soil, or remove it only partially, in order to preserve the rest of the piece.  Additionally, soils which may not be detectable to the naked eye might be present in the textile; flags, for instance, may be highly acidic due to long exposure to [[air pollution|air pollutants]], and should be treated by a professional conservator.&lt;ref name="Putnam and Finch 47"/&gt;

'''What cleaner is safest and most effective?'''  Commercial [[detergent]]s should never be used on [[antique]] textiles, whatever their claims of gentleness:  the chemicals used in most clothes detergents are too harsh for old fibres to withstand.  A wide range of speciality detergents are available from conservation suppliers, though most sources suggest [[Ivory (soap)|Ivory dish soap]] as a last-minute substitution if needed.  Never use chemical spot cleaners, as they are likewise too harsh for old fibres to tolerate.  This is especially important for pieces [[in situ]], as this may endanger other nearby pieces as well (the wooden part of an upholstered piece of furniture, for instance).&lt;ref&gt;Putnam and Finch 45&lt;/ref&gt;

'''What additives and cleaning aids are needed?'''  This can include physical supplies ([[water]], screens, a vacuum cleaner), as well as chemical ([[water softening|water softener]], cleaning agents, etc.).

'''How long can the specimen be exposed to the cleaner?'''  Prolonged exposure may cause additional damage to the fibres.

'''What mechanical action can be used?'''  The older and more fragile a textile, the less movement it will be able to tolerate during the cleaning process, so this should be considered before undertaking a cleaning.

Once the best cleaning process has been determined, the piece should be prepared for [[washing]].  Usually, this involves vacuuming to remove any surface dirt.  [[Lining (sewing)|Linings]] and backing should also be removed, vacuumed, and washed separately.  This is not only to prevent colour bleeding, but to avoid trapping dirt between the layers, which may cause discolouration from the inside.  Additionally, different fibres react to cleaning in different ways, and fabrics may shrink or stretch, which, if they are still attached together, may cause rippling and [[distortion]] in the lining and outer layer of the textile.&lt;ref name="Putnam and Finch 48"/&gt;

As with moving or working with dry pieces, the textile should be washed in a flat, fully supported position.  Usually this is achieved through the use of screens like the ones used in vacuuming, though these may be supported in a frame of some kind for added stability.  The textile should be sandwiched between two screens.  If the piece is particularly delicate or fragile, it may be wrapped in [[net (textile)|netting]], then placed between the screens.&lt;ref name="Putnam and Finch 48"/&gt;  	

The cleaning [[solution]] should be prepared using [[distilled water]].  If that is unavailable, softened water may be substituted.  The main concern is to avoid [[hard water]], which will leave deposits of [[mineral]]s in the fibres.&lt;ref name="Mailand 8"/&gt;  The solution should be placed in a container large enough for the textile to lie flat in.  For large pieces, it may be necessary to construct a temporary basin outside or in a large room:  Putnam and Finch suggest using boards or bricks to constrict a frame, then lining it with a large piece of [[plastic]], weighted on the sides, and strong enough to support the water that will be poured into it.  If a smaller basin is used, it should be of [[ceramic]], [[stainless steel]] or a stable plastic.

The screen-encased textile is lowered into the solution.  The textile can then be washed by pressing a soft [[sponge]] directly down onto the fibres.  DO NOT RUB the sponge, as this will cause unnecessary [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]] at a moment when the textile is already weak from the water.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam and Finch 50&lt;/ref&gt;  The textile may be submerged for no more than an hour, and should be rinsed at least four times after it is cleaned (Mailand).  The final rinse should always be with distilled water.  The textile should be placed to dry on a flat surface or screen, in a well-ventilated room away from heat.

===Dry cleaning===

[[Dry cleaning]] is generally only used for oil stains, as it is a very stressful process of the textile.  Commercial dry cleaners should never be used, as the chemicals used in the process are too strong for old fabrics to withstand without damage.  If dry cleaning is absolutely necessary, consult a professional conservator.&lt;ref name="Mailand 9"&gt;Mailand 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steaming and ironing===

[[Steam]]ing and [[ironing]] textiles should be done with caution, as the heat may affect the viability of the fibres.  More importantly, the fabric should always be cleaned before either of these processes is used, since heat may trap dirt and stains in the fibres to such an extent that the stain becomes permanent.  Always use the lowest setting for either of these procedures.&lt;ref name="Mailand 9"/&gt;  If a garment relies on folds to maintain its proper shape (such as [[pleat]]s), it may be better to finger-press the folds into place when the garment is damp and allow it to dry that way, rather than subject it to the added stress of ironing.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam and Finch 54-55&lt;/ref&gt;

===One alternative to ironing===

If a textile item is relatively thin and light, and is safe to wet, it can be laid out flat on a piece of glass which is larger than the item.  Before each use, the glass surface should be cleaned with 'safe' cleaners, as for the textile itself (see 'Wet Cleaning,' above), even if the glass has been kept in a clean place.  The last rinse of the glass should ideally be with a very clean cotton cloth and distilled water.

Lay the textile out as flat as possible on the dry glass.  Do not let the textile touch any metal or other casing that protects the edge of the glass.  Old storm-windowpanes and glass shower doors are often used for this task, and they usually have their original edging left on, if it's not too bulky, for reasons of safety in handling.  If the textile is known to be clean, it can be laid out dry and gently wetted to full saturation.  As sections are wetted, any crumples, folds, or details (such as fringes, the picots on the edges of lace, or fine pleats) can be gently teased into place with clean fingertips so that they lie as flat as possible on the glass.

Some old textiles can be flattened on glass just after washing, though it may be best to transfer to the glass fully supported, as on a netting screen or similar.  The supporting fabric can be removed by rolling it out from under the textile item as it is laid out on the glass, bit by bit.  Just be aware that this can stress the fibres:  do not use this method on any old textile that is likely to be damaged by the handling.  Let such fabrics dry first, then lay them on the glass and wet them in place.

Let dry completely in a darkened place with good air-flow.  The textile can be gently lifted from the glass when it's completely dry, and will usually look just as smooth as if a hot iron had been used on it.

Restoration can be done with techniques like [[Clothing#Mending|mending]] and [[darning]].&lt;ref name=darn1&gt;[https://www.deccanherald.com/content/325696/rafoogari-art-darning.html Rafoogari: Art of darning], [[Deccan herald]], 13 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=darn2&gt;[https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/8LxZYCbNJemRy3h1DwQGYN/New-Delhi-Mapping-a-forgotten-tradition.html New Delhi: Mapping a forgotten tradition], [[LiveMint]], 28 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=darn3&gt;[https://www.thestatesman.com/features/journey-of-a-shawl-1502624308.html Journey of a shawl ], The Statesman, 19 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=darn4&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/art/The-fabric-of-hope/article14588954.ece The fabric of hope], [[The Hindu]], 25 Aug 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storage==

As stated in the Climate section, the best storage environment for textiles is clean, dark, cool, and moderately dry, with a constant temperature and relative humidity.  Ideally, there should be no strain on any one particular area of cloth.  There are three basic kinds of storage for textiles, and the choice of which to use relies on the type of textile and the space available.  The three types are:  Flat, Rolled, and Hanging storage.

===Flat storage===

Flat storage is the best option for exceptionally fragile pieces because it provides the most even support for the fibres.  Enamelled metal shelves or drawers may be used, or acid-free boxes.  The textiles may be placed in the boxes or drawers flat, if at all possible.  If folding becomes necessary, acid-free [[tissue paper]] should be used to form soft rolls around which the folds can be shaped, to prevent creases from forming.  Even so, folded textiles should be removed and refolded differently every few months, to allow even wear on the piece.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam and Finch 40&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rolled storage===

For exceptionally large textiles, such as tapestries, draperies, carpets and quilts, rolled storage is the best option.  Like the upholstery section of a fabric store, the rolled storage area should consist of racks, each containing horizontally suspended acid-free or fabric-covered tubes around which the fabrics can be wrapped, being sure to line the [[selvage]]s up with the edges of the roll.  Textiles with a decorative side (such as [[velvet]]s and [[embroidery|embroidered]] textiles) should always be rolled with the decorative side facing out.  This is because the inner layer, especially if there is a lining, may crease, stretch, or fold while it is on the roll.  The rolled textiles can then be covered with a [[muslin]] wrapper to protect it from dust.&lt;ref&gt;Mailand and Alig 41&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hanging costume storage===

For costumes, flat storage may create more problems than it solves, since it is impossible to store them in this manner without forming folds and creases.  Therefore, unless the costume is so weakened that it cannot support its own weight, hanging storage is perhaps the best option.  Costumes which are unusually heavy (heavily [[bead]]ed [[gown]]s, for instance), or those whose fabric may distort easily (such as some [[stretch fabric]]s, or those cut on the bias) should also be stored in flat storage.  Garments suitable for hanging should be placed on plastic hangers which have been padded to mimic the shape of human shoulders, and covered with a plastic or cloth cover with an open bottom to allow air circulation while keeping the costume clean.&lt;ref name="Fahey"/&gt;  Wooden hangers may have a high acid content, which may cause discolouration or decay to the costume.  Likewise, metal hangers do not provide sufficient support, and may lead to distortion of the garments’ shoulders.  Therefore, both forms of hanging should be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;Mailand and Alig 44&lt;/ref&gt;

If sufficient space is available, selected garments may be stored on [[mannequin|dummies]] to better keep their shape.  If this method is used, dummies should be fitted out with the proper [[undergarment]]s, such as [[bustle]]s or [[pannier (clothing)|panniers]], to provide adequate support for the garments as they were intended to be worn.  However, while the main concern of a display may be to make the garment look attractive on the dummy, storage need have no such considerations.  Loose, unsupported parts of the garment (such as sleeves or shirts) should be loosely stuffed with acid-free tissue paper to provide additional support.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam and Finch 41-42&lt;/ref&gt;

Costume [[fashion accessory|accessories]] can be stored in a variety of ways.  Generally, bonnets and gloves should be loosely stuffed with acid-free tissue and placed in archival-quality boxes or under cover.  Fans and parasols may be stored in half-open positions, which provide the least amount of stress on the fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam and Finch 42&lt;/ref&gt;

==Display==

The conditions required for display of textiles are largely those that have already been discussed in the Storage and Environment sections.  Dry, cool, and dark, are to be preferred, with clean surroundings and frequent checks to be certain that the textiles are remaining in good condition.  Lighting should be kept to a minimum, and textiles should be rotated through display, so that each is only exposed to light for a few months at a time before being returned to darkness or taken for cleaning/conservation work.  Textiles should be vacuumed before and after display.

== Education and training ==
In France, conservators specialized in textiles arts are trained at the [[Institut national du patrimoine|Institut National du Patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage). Their mission is to intervene when heritage resources are threatened or deteriorated for several reasons. The conservator prevents works of art from disappearing or loses its purpose whilst analyzing the complex stage of its material history and the cause of alteration.

The [[navel]] has been historically subject to many [[customs]], [[fashion]]s and taboos. Various cultures view the sexual and cultural significance of the navel differently, and these views have changed over time, which has shaped social mores relating to the navel in [[fashion design|design of clothing]] and social traditions and practices.

==Western culture==
The public exposure of the male and female [[midriff]] and bare navel has been [[taboo]] at times in [[Western culture]]s, being considered [[Modesty|immodest]] or [[indecent]]. It was banned in some jurisdictions,&lt;ref name="news"&gt;{{cite news|title=New code may reveal navel|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eLtPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gFMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3939,2026891&amp;dq=navel+reveal&amp;hl=en|accessdate=20 April 2012|newspaper=Mohave Daily Miner|date=24 March 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some arguing that it simulated an "[[erogenic]] [[Body orifice|orifice]]". Eventually, only female navel exposure was banned and not male because, it was argued, the simulation or upward displacement from vagina to navel was commonplace and obvious in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Elaine Perez Zickler|title=Elizabeth Bronfen, The Knotted Subject: Hysteria and Its Discontents |url=http://www.brynmawr.edu/bmrcl/Spring2001/Bronfen.html |volume=2 |number=2 |date=Spring 2001 |journal=Bryn Mawr Review of Comparative Literature |accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Community perceptions have changed and exposure of female midriff and navel is more accepted today and in some societies or contexts it is both fashionable and common, though not without its critics. The exposure of the male navel has not been as controversial nor as common, and is usually in the context of barechestedness. Exposure of the navel by females is commonly associated with the popularization of the [[bikini]], of the [[crop top]] and [[Low-rise (fashion)|low-rise clothing]].

===Film===
In the United States, the [[Motion Picture Production Code]], or Hays Code, enforced after 1934, banned the exposure of female navel in Hollywood films.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |last1=Moseley |first1=Rachel |title=Fashioning Film Stars: Dress, Culture, Identity |date=2005 |publisher=British Film Institute |isbn=978-1-8445-7067-6 |page=136 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7dVkAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=navel }}

During the 1950s, [[Joan Collins]] was prohibited by the [[censorship in the united states|censors]] from exposing her navel in ''[[Land of the Pharaohs]]'' (1955).

By the 1960s, community standards had changed. Marilyn Monroe was allowed to expose her navel in ''[[Something's Got to Give]]'' (1962) and later commented, "I guess the censors are willing to recognize that everybody has a navel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bob Thomas|title=Mystique endears 30 years after death|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cSdZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CUcNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5273,3224419&amp;dq=navel+reveal&amp;hl=en|accessdate=20 April 2012|newspaper=The Union Democrat|date=24 July 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ursula Andress]], appearing as [[Honey Rider]] in the 1962 [[James Bond]] film, ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', wore her iconic [[White bikini of Ursula Andress|white bikini]], which exposed her midriff and navel. However, when [[Annette Funicello]] was cast in her first beach movie ''[[Beach Party]]'' (1963), [[Walt Disney]], who held her contract, insisted that she only wear modest bathing suits and keep her navel covered, to preserve her wholesome persona, though she was the only one of the ample number of young women in the film not bikini-clad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Myth of the Hidden Navel | url=http://www.beachpartymoviemusic.com/TheMythoftheHiddenNavel.html | accessdate=20 February 2012 | publisher=Beachpartymoviemusic.com | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103012357/http://www.beachpartymoviemusic.com/themythofthehiddennavel.html# | archive-date=3 January 2014 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1967 film ''[[Follow That Camel]]'', actress [[Anita Harris]] wore a jewel on her navel for a belly dance sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lenika Cruz|title=Taylor Swift and the Fraught History of Navel-Gazing|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/01/taylor-swift-and-the-fraught-history-of-navel-gazing/384811/|accessdate=7 February 2015|work=The Atlantic|date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Should You Believe?|url=http://www.shira.net/costuming/costuming-fact-or-fiction.htm|website=Shira.net|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hays Code was abandoned soon after, and with it the prohibition of female navel exposure, as well as other restrictions. The influence of the National Legion of Decency had also waned by the 1960s. With the withdrawal of the Code and the change to a classification regime, the ban on the exposure of parts of the human body that had previously been regarded as immodest or indecent was withdrawn; and with it there was an increasing level of body exposure over time. The exposure of the navel ceased to be controversial in the context of a general increase in nudity.

During the late 1980s, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s heroines began exposing more skin as well. In the 1989 animated film ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', the animated lead protagonist, [[Ariel (Disney)|Ariel]], flashed her navel while wearing only fins and seashells, a first in Disney's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Deborah Bradley |agency=Dallas Morning News |title=Disney animators give Pocahantas the sexiest cartoon image ever |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DyJVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hDsNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3796,2488695&amp;dq=navel+sexuality&amp;hl=en |newspaper=Beaver County Times |location=Beaver, Pennsylvania |date=12 July 1995 |quote=And in 1989's "The Little Mermaid," rebellious teenager Ariel flashed her navel (a Disney first) wearing little more than fins, a couple of seashells, and some cleavage. |accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of the navel is such that for Czech model [[Karolína Kurková]], who does not have a navel, the magazine and catalogue art directors routinely airbrush one in for her during post-production. They keep a collection of belly button shots in different positions, and Photoshop them on to her whenever she's doing a bikini picture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1086567/Victorias-Secret-model-Karolina-Kurkova-riddle-missing-belly-button.html Victoria's Secret model Karolina Kurkova and the riddle of her missing belly button].

{{see also|History of the bikini}}
Displays of the female navel commenced with the introduction of the [[bikini]] in 1946, designed by [[Louis Réard]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glamoursurf.com/articles/article/4918259/114188.htm |title=The Evolution of the Two Piece Swimsuit |date=1 December 2008 |publisher=Glamoursurf Vintage Swimwear and Lingerie}}&lt;/ref&gt; though two-piece swimsuits that exposed the midriff but covered the navel appeared in the 1930s. Réard could not find a model who would dare wear his brief design, so he hired [[Micheline Bernardini]], a 19-year old [[striptease|nude dancer]] from the [[Casino de Paris]], as his model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.bikiniscience.com/chronology/1945-1950_SS/LR4601_S/LR4601.html |title = Michele Bernadini: The First Bikini |first = Judson |last = Rosebush |work = Bikini Science |accessdate = 17 September 2008 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927084552/http://www.bikiniscience.com/chronology/1945-1950_SS/LR4601_S/LR4601.html |archivedate = 27 September 2007 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emily Mitchell, [http://www.time.com/time/international/1996/960701/fashion.html "The Bikini Turns 50"], 1 July 1996, Volume 148, No. 1, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The uptake of the new-style swimsuit was very slow, and even then the bikini was not regarded as suitable clothing beyond the beach or pool. During the 1960s, [[Mary Quant]]'s designs featured exposed navels and bare midriffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Nadeane Walker|title=Quant Fashions Don't Reveal Everything|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1hwrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6p8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2095,4915935&amp;dq=navel+reveal&amp;hl=en|accessdate=20 April 2012|newspaper=Reading Eagle|date=21 October 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Exposure of the male navel was limited well into the 1960s. The swimwear covered the lower abdomen and usually the navel. Occasionally the swimwear would be worn immediately below the navel. The swimwear evolved to longer legs and lower waist line. Male swimwear could not be worn above the navel nor below the knee in events of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Michael Popke |date=November 2009 |url=http://www.athleticbusiness.com/high-school/high-school-swimming-moves-forward-after-suit-ban.html |title=High School Swimming Moves Forward After Suit Ban |publisher=AthleticBusiness}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Males often wear no shirt with lower rise shorts during practice.

The navel is mentioned as an important element of a woman's beauty in the [[Song of Songs]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;Murphy Ronald E (1992) "Song of songs, Book of", in The Anchor Bible Dictionary, vol 6. p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Annotation"&gt;Dobbs-Allsopp F. W. (2001) Annotation and commentary on "Song of Solomon" in 'The New Oxford Annotated Bible' (with the Apocrypha. Third Edition (Ed) Coogan, M.D. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001. page 966 from pages 959–968&lt;/ref&gt; It contains imagery similar to that in the love songs of [[ancient Egyptian literature]].&lt;ref name="Murphy"/&gt; Song of Songs 7:2 states, "Your navel is a rounded bowl."&lt;ref name="NRSV"&gt;''The New Oxford Annotated Bible''. New Revised Standard Version. Oxford: Oxford University Press 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The verse preceding the line mentioning the navel (Song of Songs 7:1) states, "your rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of a master hand",&lt;ref name="NRSV"/&gt; ) and the verse following states, "Your belly is a heap of wheat."&lt;ref name="NRSV"/&gt; Thus, the description of the navel is placed textually in between the description of the curves of a woman through [[thigh]] and the [[stomach]] or [[midriff]].&lt;ref name="Annotation"/&gt; "Belly" also suggests the womb, and the combination of the imagery of the womb with that of wheat suggests the link between eroticism and fertility through the imagery of the navel and curvaceous thighs.&lt;ref name="Annotation"/&gt; These passages also celebrate a curvaceous stomach and midriff and plumpness as aspects of female [[physical attractiveness]].&lt;ref name="Annotation"/&gt;

In the ancient Mediterranean, [[Hebrew]], [[Israelites|Israelite]] and [[Middle Eastern]] [[worldview]], it was a common belief that shrines, important places such as cities or capitals, or other such places of prominence had a position of centrality to the world and hence equated to the child-bearing, life-giving navel of a mother.&lt;ref name="Sperling"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sperling |first=D |year=1976 |chapter=Navel of the earth |title=The Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible: An Illustrated Encyclopedia (Supplementary Volume) |editor=Keith Crim |editor2=Victor Paul Furnish |editor3=Lloyd Richard Bailey Sr. |display-editors = 3 |editor4=Emory Stevens Bucke |location=Nashville |publisher=Abingdon Press |pages=622–623 |isbn=978-0687192694}}&lt;/ref&gt; These domains constituted what could be regarded as important [[Maternal bond|bond]] that linked the universe.&lt;ref name="Sperling"/&gt; Thus [[Nippur]], the ancient city of the [[Mesopotamian people]], was often described as the "navel".&lt;ref name="Sperling"/&gt; This suggested to the prominence of the location and the way it was seen to function as a place of centrality and as a link between earth and the heavens and the Universe.&lt;ref name="Sperling"/&gt; The [[Greeks]] thought that the conical stone ''[[Omphalos]]'' ("navel") located at [[Delphi]] was the center of the earth.&lt;ref name="Sperling"/&gt;

In a similar vein, in the [[Jewish]] ''[[Midrashim]]'' it is stated, "God created the world like an [[embryo]]. Just as the embryo begins at the navel and continues to grow from that point, so too the world. The Holy One, blessed be he, began the world from its navel. From there it was stretched hither and yon. Where is its navel? [[Jerusalem]]. And its (Jerusalem's) navel itself?

[[File:Figurine Dogu Jomon Musée Guimet 70608 4.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Dogū]] figurine of the late [[Jōmon period]] with the navel indicated with a deep indentation.]]

===Early times===
Japan has long had a special regard for the navel. During the early [[Jōmon period]] in northern Japan, three small balls indicating the breasts and navel were pasted onto flat clay objects to represent the female body. The navel was exaggerated in size, informed by the belief that the navel symbolizes the center of where life begins. On many middle Jomon figurines, the significance of the navel was emphasized with an indentation or hole. Sometimes, the importance of the navel was further enhanced by connecting with a line from the navel towards the chest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Nelly Naumann]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yrla4QyhFasC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;dq=navel+japan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=l-7kTsmJEaX50gHu_YiGBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAjgK#v=snippet&amp;q=navel%20chest&amp;f=false |title=Japanese prehistory: the material and spiritual culture of the Jōmon period |publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag |year=2000 |isbn=9783447043298 |page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Japanese poems feature many references to the female navel.

A similar type festival is held at [[Shibukawa]], north of Tokyo. The idea was formed based on the location of Shibukawa, which is also referred to as the "Belly Button of Japan". The festival is based on a traditional Japanese form of entertainment where revelers paint a face on their torsos and stomachs to appear as a head. A ''[[kimono]]'' is wrapped around the waist, and the person's real head is hidden by a large cloth hat. The belly button is traditionally painted into a mouth. In recent years, modern motifs and Japanese anime designs have appeared in the festival.&lt;ref&gt;Muramoto, Hiroyuki.

In the 1980s and 1990s, a visible navel was very rare.

In 2004, the [[President of Indonesia]] [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] spoke out against exposed navels, saying, "Indonesian women, who are known for their courtesy, should refrain from exposing their midriffs or belly buttons, which now seems to be taken for granted. There are many ways to express beauty, as part of aesthetics, and to express freedom but not by showing things that lead to pornography." He further added that while the state could not dictate dress codes, citizens were expected to respect the country's moral values and courtesy. A week later, a cabinet minister quoted Yudhoyono as saying that he felt "disturbed and uneasy" to see television shows in which women exposed their navels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartafpost.com/news/2004/12/22/contemplating-susilo039s-navel-fixation.html "Contemplating Susilo's navel fixation"]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

In 2006, Agus Suwage, an Indonesian artist, installed his Pinkswing Park exhibit at [[Jakarta]]'s international biennale.The exhibit was surrounded by massive panels with multiple pictures of a near-naked man and woman frolicking in a park. Within days of the exhibition's launch, Islamic fundamentalists had descended on the biennale, forcing its closure and demanding prosecutions. At first police claimed his work blasphemed the story of [[Adam and Eve]]; a few weeks later they told Suwage he faced five years in jail for producing pornography. The Indonesian parliament decided to introduce a sweeping anti-pornography law. The law imposes a rigid social template; couples who kiss in public will face up to five years' jail, as would anyone flaunting a "sensual body part"—including their navel—and tight clothing will be outlawed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2006/02/24/1140670261932.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap3 Navel gazing ruled out as Indonesians button up].

'''Dekh Le''' is a [[viral video]] dealing with the subject of men ogling women in India.  It was produced by [[film studies]] students at [[Mumbai]]-based [[Whistling Woods International Institute|Whistling Woods International Institute of Film, Fashion &amp; Media]] and released on 16 December 2013, the first anniversary of the [[2012 Delhi gang rape]].  It garnered one million hits in its first week on [[YouTube]].

==Background==
On 16 December 2012, a [[2012 Delhi gang rape|horrific gang-rape]] of an Indian girl took place in a moving bus in [[New Delhi]], the national capital of India. The event was followed by various [[protest]]s in which masses took to the streets in various Indian states, demanding the government to form stricter laws regarding women safety. The media industry voiced its concern in its own way. One such way was the women-empowerment [[ad campaign]] 'Dekh Le', launched one year after the incident.

==Content==
The 90 second video shows four different scenarios where women are made to feel uneasy and uncomfortable by male gaze in everyday life situations. It shows women at a red light, in a bus, on a train and at a cafe, being subjected to staring male eyes. In order to retaliate, these women show mirrors to the men; on seeing how bad they look while staring at a girl, realize their mistake and are forced to take their eyes off.  The video concludes with the four empowered women going about their business, free from prying eyes.

Strictly, '''digital theatre''' is a hybrid art form, gaining strength from [[theatre]]’s ability to facilitate the imagination and create human connections and [[Digital data|digital]] technology’s ability to extend the reach of communication and visualization. (However, the phrase is also used in a more generic sense by companies such as [[Evans and Sutherland]] to refer to their [[fulldome]] projection technology products.)

==Description== 
Digital theatre is primarily identified by the coexistence of “live” performers and digital [[Electronic media|media]] in the same unbroken(1) space with a co-present audience. In addition to the necessity that its performance must be simultaneously “live” and digital, the event’s secondary characteristics are that its content should retain some recognizable theatre roles (through limiting the level of [[interactivity]]) and a narrative element of spoken language or text. The four conditions of digital theatre are:

#It is a “live” performance placing at least some performers in the same shared physical space with an audience.(2)
#The performance must use digital technology as an essential part of the primary artistic event.(3)
#The performance contains only limited levels of [[interactivity]],(4) in that its content is shaped primarily by the artist(s) for an audience.(5)
#The performance’s content should contain either spoken language or text which might constitute a [[narrative]] or story, differentiating it from other events which are distinctly [[dance]], [[art]], or [[music]].

==”Live,” digital media, interactivity, and narrative==
A brief clarification of these terms in relation to digital theatre is in order. The significance of the terms “live” or “liveness” as they occur in [[theatre]] can not be over-emphasized, as it is set in opposition to [[Digital data|digital]] in order to indicate the presence of both types of communication, human and computer-created. Rather than considering the real-time or temporality of events, digital theatre concerns the interactions of people (audience and actors) sharing the same physical space (in at least one location, if multiple audiences exist). In the case of mass broadcast, it is essential that this sharing of public space occurs at the site of the primary artistic event.(6) The next necessary condition for creating digital theatre is the presence of digital media in the performance. [[Digital media]] is not defined through the presence of one type of technology hardware or software configuration, but by its characteristics of being flexible, mutable, easily adapted, and able to be processed in real-time. It is the ability to change not only sound and light, but also images, [[video]], [[animation]], and other content into triggered, manipulated, and reconstituted data which is relayed or transmitted in relation to other impulses which defines the essential nature of the digital format.  Digital information has the quality of pure computational potential, which can be seen as parallel to the potential of human imagination.

The remaining characteristics of limited interactivity and narrative or spoken word are secondary and less distinct parameters.  While [[interactivity]] can apply to both the interaction between humans and machines and between humans, digital theatre is primarily concerned with the levels of interactivity occurring between audience and performers (as it is facilitated through technology).(7)  It is in this type of interactivity, similar to other types of heightened audience participation,(8) that the roles of message sender and receiver can dissolve to that of equal conversers, causing theatre to dissipate into conversation.  The term “[[interactive]]” refers to any mutually or reciprocally active communication, whether it be a human-human or a human-machine communication.

The criteria of having [[narrative]] content through spoken language or text as part of the theatrical event is meant not to limit the range of what is already considered standard theatre (as there are examples in the works of [[Samuel Beckett]] in which the limits of verbal expression are tested), but to differentiate between that which is digital theatre and the currently more developed fields of digital dance9 and Art Technology.(10)  This is necessary because of the mutability between art forms utilizing technology.  It is also meant to suggest a wide range of works including dance theatre involving technology and spoken words such as [[Troika Ranch]]’s [[Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz|The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz]] (Troika Ranch, 2000), to the creation of original text-based works online by performers like the Plain Text Players or collaborations such as Art Grid’s Interplay: Hallucinations, to pre-scripted works such as the classics (''[[A Midsummer Night’s Dream]]'', ''[[The Tempest]])'' staged with technology at the [[University of Kansas]] and the [[University of Georgia]].

The Participatory Virtual Theatre efforts at the Rochester Institute of Technology take a different approach by have live actors use motion capture to control avatars on a virtual stage.  Audience responses are designed into the software that supports the performance.  In the 2004 production, "What's the Buzz?" (17), a single node motion capture device controlled the performance of a swarm of bees. Later performances use two motion capture systems located in different buildings controlling the performance on a single virtual stage (18).

These criteria or limiting parameters are flexible enough to allow for a wide range of theatrical activities while refining the scope of events to those which most resemble the hybrid “live”/mediated form of theatre described as digital theatre.  digital theatre is separated from the larger category of digital performance (as expressed in the overabundance of a variety of items including installations, dance concerts, [[Compact disc]]s, robot fights and other events found in the Digital Performance Archive).

==History==
In the early 1980s, video, satellites, fax machines, and other communications equipment began to be used as methods of creating art and performance. The groups [[Fluxus]] and [[John Cage]] were among the early leaders in expanding what was considered art, technology, and performance.  With the adaptation of personal computers in the 1980s, new possibilities for creating performance communications was born.  Artists like Sherrie Rabinowitz and Kit Galloway began to transition from earlier, more costly experiments with satellite transmission to experiments with the developing internet.  Online communities such as [[WELL (virtual community)|The Well]] and [[interactive writing]] offered new models for artistic creativity.  With the ‘Dot Com’ boom of the 1990s, telematic artists including [[Roy Ascott]] began to develop greater significance as theatre groups like [[George Coates|George Coates Performance Works]] and Gertrude Stein Repertory Theatre established partnerships with software and hardware companies encouraged by the technology boom.In Australia in the early 1990s Julie Martin's Virtual Reality Theatre presented works at the Sydney Opera House, featuring the first hybrid human digital avatars, in 1996 "A Midsummer Nights Dream featured Augmented Reality Stage sets designed and produced by her company.  Researchers such as Claudio Pinanhez at [[MIT]], David Saltz of The Interactive Performance Laboratory at the University of Georgia, and Mark Reaney head of the Virtual Reality Theatre Lab at the [[University of Kansas]], as well as significant [[dance technology]] partnerships (including Riverbed and Riverbed’s work with [[Merce Cunningham]]) led to an unprecedented expansion in the use of digital technology in creating media-rich performances (including the use of [[motion capture]], 3D stereoscopic animation, and [[virtual reality]] as in The Virtual Theatricality Lab‘s production of ''The Skriker'' at [[Henry Ford Community College]] under the direction of Dr. George Popovich. Another example is the [http://www.stenslie.net/?page_id=69 sense:less] project by [[Stahl Stenslie|Stenslie]]/Mork/Watz/Pendry using virtual actors that users would engage with inside a VR environment. The project was shown at ELECTRA, Henie Onstad Art Center, Norway,  [http://www.v2.nl/archive/works/sense-less DEAF 1996] in Rotterdam and the Fifth Istanbul Biennial (1997).

Early use of mechanical and projection devices for theatrical entertainments have a long history tracing back to mechanicals of [[ancient Greece]] and medieval [[magic lantern]]s.  But the most significant precursors of digital theatre can be seen in the works of the early 20th century.  It is in the ideas of artists including [[Edward Gordon Craig]], [[Erwin Piscator]] (and to a limited degree [[Bertolt Brecht]] in their joint work on [[Epic Theatre]]), [[Josef Svoboda]], and the [[Bauhaus]] and [[Futurists]] movements that we can see the strongest connections between today’s use of digital media and live actors, and earlier, experimental theatrical use of non-human actors, broadcast technology, and filmic projections.

The presence of these theatrical progenitors using analog media, such as filmic projection, provides a bridge between [[Theatre]] and many of today’s vast array of computer-art-performance-communication experiments.  These past examples of theatre artists integrating their modern technology with theatre strengthens the argument that theatrical entertainment does not have to be either purist involving only “live” actors on stage, or be consumed by the dominant televisual [[mass media]], but can gain from the strengths of both types of communication.

==Other terminology==
Digital theatre does not exist in a vacuum but in relation to other terminology.  It is a type of [[Digital Performance]] and may accommodate many types of “live”/mediated theatre including “VR Theatre”(11) and “Computer Theatre,”(12) both of which involve specific types of computer media, “live” performers, story/words, and limited levels of interactivity.  However, terms such as “Desktop Theatre,”(13) using animated computer avatars in online chat-rooms without co-present audiences falls outside digital theatre into the larger category of digital performance.  Likewise, digital dance may fall outside the parameters of digital theatre, if it does not contain elements of story or spoken words.

"[[Cyberformance]]" can be included within this definition of Digital theatre, where it includes a proximal audience: "Cyberformance can be created and presented entirely online, for a distributed online audience who participate via internet-connected computers anywhere in the world, or it can be presented to a proximal audience (such as in a physical theatre or gallery venue) with some or all of the performers appearing via the internet; or it can be a hybrid of the two approaches, with both remote and proximal audiences and/or performers."

==Notes==

#Space not divided by visible solid interfaces such as walls, glass screens, or other visible barriers which perceptually divide the audience from the playing space making two (or more) rooms rather than a continuous place including both stage and audience.
#It is suggested that a minimal audience of two or more is needed to keep a performance from being a conversation or art piece.  If additional online or mediated audiences exist, only one site need have a co-present audience/performer situation.
#Digital technology may be used to create, manipulate or influence content. However, the use of technology for transmission or archiving does not constitute a performance of digital theatre.
#Interactivity is more than choices on a navigation menu, low levels of participation or getting a desired response to a request.  [[Sheizaf Rafaeli]] defines it as existing in the relay of a message, in which the third or subsequent message refers back to the first.   “Formally stated, interactivity is an expression of the extent that in a given series of communication exchanges, any third (or later) transmission (or message) is related to the degree to which previous exchanges referred to even earlier transmissions” (Sheizaf Rafaeli, “[https://www.academia.edu/download/44162252/Rafaeli_interactivity.pdf Interactivity, From New Media to Communication]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }},” pages 110-34 in ''Advanced Communicational Science:  Merging Mass and Interpersonal Processes'', ed. Robert P. Hawkins, John M. Wiemann, and Suzanne Pingree [Newbury Park:  Sage Publications, 1988] 111).
#Though some of the content may be formed or manipulated by both groups, the flow of information is primarily from message creator or sender to receiver, thus maintaining the roles of author/performer and audience (rather than dissolving those roles into equal participants in a conversation). This also excludes gaming or VR environments in which the (usually isolated) participant is the director of the action which his actions drive.
#While TV studio audiences may feel that they are at a public “live” performance, these performances are often edited and remixed for the benefit of their intended primary audience, the home audiences which are viewing the mass broadcast in private.  Broadcasts of “Great Performances” by PBS and other theatrical events broadcast into private homes, give the TV viewers the sense that they are secondary viewers of a primary “live” event.  In addition, archival or real-time web-casts which do not generate feedback influencing the “live” performances are not within the range of digital theatre.  In each case, a visible interface such as TV or monitor screen, like a camera frames and interprets the original event for the viewers.
#An example of this is the case of internet chat which becomes the main text of be read or physically interpreted by performers on stage.  Online input including content and directions can also have an effect of influencing “live” performance beyond the ability of “live” co-present audiences.
#E.g. [[happenings]].
#Such as the stunning visual media dance concerts like ''Ghostcatching'', by Merce Cunningham and Riverbed, accessible online via the revamped/migrated Digital Performance Archive ''[http://www.ahds.ac.uk/ahdscollections/docroot/dpa/authorsearch.do?string=D&amp;searchbox=merce]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'' and ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20050323232028/http://merce.org/home.html Merce Cunningham Dance]''; cf. Isabel C. Valverde, “Catching Ghosts in ''Ghostcatching'':  Choreographing Gender and Race in Riverbed/Bill T. Jones’ Virtual Dance,” accessible in a pdf version from ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20051102005319/http://www.wac.ucla.edu/extensionsjournal/v2/pdf/valverde.pdf Extensions: The Online Journal of Embodied Teaching]''.
#Such as ''Telematic Dreaming'', by Paul Sermon, in which distant participants shared a bed through mixing projected video streams; see [http://www.hgb-leipzig.de/~sermon/dream/ "Telematic Dreaming - Statement."]
#Mark Reaney, head of the Virtual Reality Theatre Lab at the University of Kansas, investigates the use of virtual reality (“and related technologies”) in theatre.  “VR Theatre” is one form or subset of digital theatre focusing on utilizing virtual reality immersion in mutual concession with traditional theatre practices (actors, directors, plays, a theatre environment).  The group uses image projection and stereoscopic sets as their primary area of digital investigation.
#Another example of digital theatre is Computer Theatre, as defined by Claudio S. Pinhanez in his work '''Computer Theatre'' (in which he also gives the definition of “hyper-actor” as an actor whose expressive capabilities are extended through the use of technologies).  “Computer Theatre, in my view, is about providing means to enhance the artistic possibilities and experiences of professional and amateur actors, or of audiences clearly engaged in a representational role in a performance”  (''Computer Theater'' [Cambridge:  Perceptual Computing Group -- MIT Media Laboratory, 1996] (forthcoming in a revised ed.); Pinhanez also sees this technology being explored more through dance than theatre.  His writing and his productions of ''I/IT'' suggest that ''Computer Theatre'' is digital theatre.
#On the far end of the spectrum, outside of the parameters of digital theatre, are what are called Desktop Theater and Virtual Theatre.  These are digital performances or media events which are created and presented on computers utilizing intelligent agents or synthetic characters, called avatars.  Often these are interactive computer programs or online conversations.  Without human actors, or group audiences, these works are computer multimedia interfaces allowing a user to play at the roles of theatre rather than being theatre.  Virtual Theatre is defined by the Virtual Theatre Project at Stanford on their website as a project which “aims to provide a multimedia environment in which user can play all of the creative roles associated with producing and performing plays and stories in an improvisational theatre company.”
#For more information, see ''Multimedia:  From Wagner to Virtual Reality'', ed. Randall Packer and Ken Jordan; ''Telepresence and Bio Art'', by Eduardo Kac; and ''Virtual Theatres:  An Introduction'', by Gabriella Giannachi (London and New York: Routledge, 2004).
#Media, in this sense, indicates the broadcast and projection of film, video, images and other content which can, but need not be digitized.  These elements are often seen as additions to traditional forms of theatre even before the use of computers to process them.  The addition of computers to process visual, aural and other data allows for greater flexibility in translating visual and other information into impulses which can interact with each other and their environments in real-time.  Media is also distinguished from mass media, by which primarily means TV broadcast, Film, and other communications resources owned by multi-national media corporations.  Mass media is that section of the media specifically conceived and designed to reach a very large audience (typically at least as large as the majority of the population of a nation state).  It refers primarily to television, film, internet, and various news/entertainment corporations and their subsidiaries.
#Here the use of quotations signals a familiarity with the issues of mediation vs. real-time events as expressed by Phillip Auslander, yet choosing to use the term in its earlier meaning, indicating co-present human audience and actors in the same shared breathing space unrestrained by a physical barrier or perceived interface.  This earlier meaning is still in standard use by digital media performers to signify the simultaneous presence of the human and the technological other.  It is possible also to use the term (a)live to indicate co-presence.

==Undated==
The bulk of [[Sanskrit literature|literature in Classical Sanskrit]] dates to the Early Medieval period, but in most cases cannot be dated to a specific century.

The vocalized [[Masoretic Text]] of the Hebrew Bible developed during the 7th to 10th centuries.

The Old English ''[[Beowulf]]'' is dated to anywhere between the 8th and early 11th centuries.

'''''Ethics''''' (German: '''{{lang|de|Ethik}}''') is an [[Unfinished_creative_work#Literature|unfinished book]] by [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] that was edited and published after his death by [[Eberhard Bethge]] in 1949.{{sfn|de Gruchy|1991|p=221}} Bonhoeffer worked on the book in the early 1940s{{sfn|Muers|2007|p=173}} and intended it to be his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''.{{sfn|Metaxas|2015|p=179}} At the time of writing, he was a [[double agent]]; he was working for {{lang|de|[[Abwehr]]}}, [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[military intelligence]] organization, but was simultaneously involved in the [[20 July plot]] to [[Assassination attempts on Adolf Hitler|assassinate Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[National Review]]|title=The Awe-Inspiring Heroism of Dietrich Bonhoeffer|author=Karnick, S.T.|date=April 10, 2015|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/416760/dietrich-bonhoeffers-heroism-awe-inspring-st-karnick|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central theme of ''Ethics'' is Christlikeness.{{sfn|Kelly &amp; Nelson|2003|p=112}} The arguments in the book are informed by [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Christology]]{{sfn|DeJonge|2012|p=140}} and are influenced by Bonhoeffer's participation in the [[German resistance to Nazism]].{{sfn|Green|1999|p=301}} ''Ethics'' is commonly compared to Bonhoeffer's earlier book ''[[The Cost of Discipleship]]'', with scholars debating the extent to which Bonhoeffer's views on [[Christian ethics]] changed between his writing of the two books.{{sfn|Plant|2014|p=97}} In ''The Cambridge Companion to Dietrich Bonhoeffer'', [[John W. de Gruchy]] argues that ''Ethics'' evinces more nuance than Bonhoeffer's earlier writings.{{sfn|de Gruchy|1999|p=170}} In 2012, [[David P.

'''''Evil Come, Evil Go''''' is a 1972 [[Softcore pornography|softcore pornographic]] [[horror film]] written and directed by Walt Davis.

== Plot ==

"Sister" Sarah Jane Butler, a [[hymn]]-humming religious fanatic who believes God has chosen her to cleanse the world of those who have sex for pleasure, seduces a bar patron, and guts him after the two leave together. Sarah then drives to [[Los Angeles]], and lures another man to his death, scrawling "God is Love, not Sex" on a mirror afterward. While [[Street performance|busking]] and preaching on the street, Sarah befriends Penelope von Prut, a [[Naivety|naive]] lesbian who is being supported by her wealthy and ashamed parents. Sarah moves in with Penny, who she takes on as a [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciple]], and inducts into "Sister Sarah's Sacred Order of the Sisters of Complete Subjugation" by tying her to a bed, stripping her, and teasing her with a knife as they sing "[[Glory, Glory (Lay My Burden Down)|Glory, Glory, Hallelujah]]".

Sarah and Penny sing in the streets, make plans to create a television series that Sarah will use as a platform for her views, and intimidate Penny's [[Leasehold estate|tenant]]s. Sarah has Penny lure a man home, and as he and Penny have sex, Sarah stabs him to death. Penny is horrified by the murder, but continues to obey Sarah. As Sarah and Penny prepare to dispose of the man's body, Penny's ex-girlfriend Junie visits, and becomes another victim when Sarah [[garrote]]s her with a scarf as she is having sex with Penny. Sarah and Penny dump their victims in the woods, where they spot a couple having sex. After the woman leaves, the man approaches Sarah and Penny, and after chatting with them, leaves with the duo, who will presumably kill him as well. A [[guitarist]] who had appeared throughout the film follows the group from afar, and sings "Evil Come, Evil Go" as the credits roll.

== Reception ==

Bill Gibron of [[DVD Verdict]] wrote "Wildly uneven, funny as Hell and occasional as disturbed as an actual [[Psychopathy|psychopath]], ''Evil Come Evil Go'' joins the ranks of other ridiculous [[Exploitation film|exploitation]] romps, trying to hide their carnality with nonsensical narrative misdirection. And it kind of works." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/evilcomeevilgo.php|title = ''Evil Come, Evil Go / Terror at Orgy Castle / Hand of Pleasure''|last = Gibron|first = Bill|publisher = DVD Verdict|date = 15 September 2005|website = dvdtalk.com|accessdate = 29 January 2014|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140202131000/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/evilcomeevilgo.php|archivedate = 2 February 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Daily Grindhouse's Paul Freitag-Fey called the film "a bizarre blend of ugly sex and ugly gore" that was nonetheless "a genuinely fascinating piece of work" due primarily to Cleo O'Hara's over-the-top performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://dailygrindhouse.com/thewire/dvd-review-films-walt-davis/|title = DVD Review - The Films of Walt Davis|last = Fey|first = Paul|publisher = Daily Grindhouse|date = 5 January 2014|website = dailygrindhouse.com|accessdate = 29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Hara's performance was also praised by Ian Jane of Rock! Shock! Pop!, who stated "Throw in an inexplicable guitar player who seems to pop up at random and serenade Sarah, a few great scenes where O'Hara’s crazed preacher interrupts a few couples in the midst of coitus and some great footage capturing the seedier side of early seventies [[Hollywood]] and it's easy to see why this one would have the [[cult following]] that it does." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.rockshockpop.com/forums/content.php?3441-Evil-Come-Evil-Go-Widow-Blue-Oh-You-Beautiful-Doll!|title = ''Evil Come, Evil Go/Widow Blue/Oh, You Beautiful Doll!''|last = Jane|first = Ian|publisher = Rock!

The '''Galva Opera House''' is a historic [[theater]] located at 334-348 Front Street in [[Galva, Illinois|Galva]], [[Illinois]]. Built in 1878, the theater opened as the ''Blue Ribbon Temperance Hall''; by 1886, it had lost its association with the [[temperance movement]] and was known by its present name. Galva's location on two major [[Glossary of rail transport terms#Railway line|railroad lines]] allowed traveling theatrical troupes to visit the theater; shows produced by local talent performed in the building as well. Local schools also used the building for their graduation ceremonies, sporting events, and school plays until [[Galva High School]] opened its own auditorium in 1932. The building was used as a [[roller skating]] rink in the 1920s and 1930s and hosted [[Lions Club]] events in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kenyon|first1=Leslie H.|last2=Davis|first2=Larry D.|last3=Ulrich|first3=Amy|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form: Galva Opera House / Blue Ribbon Temperance Hall|url=http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/200329.pdf|publisher=Illinois Historic Preservation Agency|accessdate=February 28, 2016|date=July 8, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4095">'''Historiographic metafiction''' is a term coined by Canadian literary theorist [[Linda Hutcheon]] in the late 1980s. The term is used for works of fiction which combine the literary devices of [[metafiction]] with [[historical fiction]]. Works regarded as historiographic metafiction are also distinguished by frequent allusions to other artistic, historical and literary texts (i.e. [[intertextuality]]) in order to show the extent to which works of both literature and [[historiography]] are dependent on the history of discourse.&lt;ref name=bolland&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bolland|first1=John|title=Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient: A Reader's Guide|date=2002|publisher=Continuum|location=London, UK|isbn=978-0-8264-5243-6|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is closely associated with works of [[postmodern literature]], usually novels. According to Hutcheon, in "A Poetics of Postmodernism", works of historiographic metafiction are "those well-known and popular novels which are both intensely self-reflexive and yet paradoxically also lay claim to historical events and personages".&lt;ref name = Hutcheon5&gt; Hutcheon 5&lt;/ref&gt; Works often described as examples of historiographical metafiction include: [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]'' (c.1608), [[John Fowles]]' ''[[The French Lieutenant's Woman]]'' (1969), [[E. L. Doctorow]]'s ''[[Ragtime (novel)|Ragtime]]'' (1975), [[William Kennedy (author)|William Kennedy]]'s ''[[Legs (novel)|Legs]]'' (1975), [[Salman Rushdie]]'s ''[[Midnight's Children]]'' (1981), [[A. S. Byatt]]'s ''[[Possession (Byatt novel)|Possession]]'' (1990), [[Michael Ondaatje]]'s ''[[The English Patient]]'' (1992), [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s ''[[Mason &amp; Dixon]]'' (1997) and many others. By seeking to represent both ''actual historical events'' from [[World War Two]] while, at the same time, ''problematizing'' the very notion of doing exactly that, [[Kurt Vonnegut|Kurt Vonnegut's]] ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'' (1969) features a metafictional, "[[Janus|Janus-headed]]" perspective.&lt;ref name="jensen"&gt;Jensen, Mikkel (2016) "[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00144940.2015.1133546 Janus-Headed Postmodernism: The Opening Lines of ''Slaughterhouse-Five'']" in ''[[The Explicator]]'', 74:1, 8-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6589">'''KISS''' is an [[Acronym and initialism|acronym]] for "'''Keep it simple, stupid'''" as a design principle noted by the [[U.S. Navy]] in 1960.&lt;ref name=TDal/&gt;&lt;ref name=EPar/&gt; The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore [[simplicity]] should be a key goal in [[design]], and that unnecessary complexity should be avoided. The phrase has been associated with aircraft engineer [[Kelly Johnson (engineer)|Kelly Johnson]].&lt;ref name=BRich/&gt; The term "KISS principle" was in popular use by 1970.&lt;ref name=Pit/&gt; Variations on the phrase include: "Keep it simple, silly", "keep it short and simple", "keep it simple and straightforward",&lt;ref name="monash"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.monash.edu/business/marketing/marketing-dictionary/k/kiss-principle |title=Kiss principle definition by MONASH Marketing Dictionary| date=1994-11-18 | accessdate=2016-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; "keep it small and simple" and "keep it stupid simple".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://people.apache.org/~fhanik/kiss.html| title=Kiss Principle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The acronym was reportedly coined by [[Kelly Johnson (engineer)|Kelly Johnson]], lead engineer at the [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed]] [[Skunk Works]] (creators of the [[Lockheed U-2]] and [[SR-71 Blackbird]] spy planes, among many others).&lt;ref name=BRich/&gt;

While popular usage has transcribed it for decades as "Keep it simple, stupid", Johnson transcribed it as "Keep it simple stupid" (no comma), and this reading is still used by many authors.&lt;ref name=misra&gt;Ram B. Misra (2004), "Global IT Outsourcing: Metrics for Success of All Parties", ''Journal of Information Technology Cases and Applications'', volume 6 issue 3, page 21. [http://web.njit.edu/~jerry/Outsourcing/out-JITCA-6-3-2004-2.pdf Online version]. Retrieved 2009-12-19.&lt;/ref&gt; There was no implicit meaning that an engineer was stupid; just the opposite.&lt;ref name=BRich/&gt;

The principle is best exemplified by the story of Johnson handing a team of design engineers a handful of tools, with the challenge that the jet aircraft they were designing must be repairable by an average mechanic in the field under combat conditions with only these tools. Hence, the "stupid" refers to the relationship between the way things break and the sophistication available to repair them.

The acronym has been used by many in the [[List of military slang terms|U.S. military]], especially the [[List of U.S. Navy acronyms and expressions|U.S. Navy]] and [[United States Air Force]], and in the field of [[software developer|software development]].

==Variants==
The principle most likely finds its origins in similar [[Minimalism|minimalist]] concepts, such as [[Occam's razor]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication", [[Mies Van Der Rohe]]'s "[[Less is more (architecture)|Less is more]]", [[Bjarne Stroustrup]]'s "Make Simple Tasks Simple!", or [[Antoine de Saint Exupéry]]'s "It seems that perfection is reached not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away". [[Colin Chapman]], the founder of [[Lotus Cars]], urged his designers to "Simplify, then add lightness". [[Heath Robinson]] machines and [[Rube Goldberg machine|Rube Goldberg's machines]], intentionally overly-complex solutions to simple tasks or problems, are humorous examples of "non-KISS" solutions. Also Shakespeare's "Brevity is the soul of wit".

A variant — "Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler" — is attributed to [[Albert Einstein]], although this may be an editor's paraphrase of a lecture he gave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/#more-2363|title=Everything Should Be Made as Simple as Possible, But Not Simpler|publisher=Quote Investigator}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In film animation==
Master animator [[Richard Williams (animator)|Richard Williams]] explains the KISS principle in his book ''[[The Animator's Survival Kit]]'', and [[Disney's Nine Old Men]] write about it in ''[[Disney Animation: The Illusion of Life]]'', a considerable work of the genre. The problem faced is that inexperienced animators may "over-animate" in their works, that is, a character may move too much and do too much.  Williams urges animators to "KISS".

'''''Mommie Dearest''''' is a [[memoir]] and exposé written by [[Christina Crawford]], the [[adoption|adopted]] daughter of actress [[Joan Crawford]]. Published in 1978, it described the author's upbringing by an unbalanced alcoholic mother, who she judged unfit to raise children. The book attracted much controversy regarding [[child abuse]] and [[child trafficking]], with many family friends denouncing it as fiction, but others claiming that it was a broadly accurate, if exaggerated, account of Christina’s troubled childhood. It was turned into [[Mommie Dearest (film)|a film]] starring [[Faye Dunaway]].

==Claims==
In the book, Christina contends that Joan used to hit her with objects because of [[alcoholism]] and that Joan placed more importance on being famous and ignored being a parent. Christina suggests that Joan may have adopted children as a [[publicity stunt]] to support her career. She implies Joan had a long list of affairs with men, who Christina was required to call "Uncle" and rarely "Daddy", and that Joan also had many affairs with women. Christina suggests that as she grew older and more difficult to control, Joan found excuses to remove Christina from the home by sending her to various boarding schools and strict religious academies, often specifying in her instructions that Christina must be allowed no contact with the outside world. Often, the schools were used to punish Christina for defying her mother or fighting back against abusive behavior.

Christina recounts several evenings on which Joan's behavior was unbalanced, and at least one encounter with her mother where Joan attempted to strangle her. In another encounter, Joan reportedly discovered Christina's clothes hanging in a closet on wire hangers, instead of higher-quality crochet hangers, and reprimanded her harshly. In an incident in which Christina refused to eat very rare beef, Joan ordered the meat returned to the refrigerator and refused to allow Christina any other food for several days until she finished the meal, but Christina managed to hold out until her mother gave up and allowed her regular meals again. Joan allegedly disposed of her children's possessions to punish them for minor transgressions. Joan also supposedly strapped Christina's younger adopted brother, Christopher, to his bed each night until he was twelve, ostensibly to control his [[sleepwalking]].

Christina reported that Joan's controlling and erratic behavior continued throughout Christina's adulthood. She asserts that Joan was jealous of her daughter's burgeoning acting career to the point of taking over Christina's role in the soap opera ''[[The Secret Storm]]'' while Christina was in the hospital recovering from an [[ovarian cyst]]. (Christina's character was twenty-eight years old; Joan was then in her sixties.) She also used money to control the adult Christina's behavior by taking her out for expensive meals and paying for taxis while refusing to give Christina money for basic living expenses. This culminated in Christina learning that she and her brother Christopher had been left out of Joan's will, even though Christina believed that they had reconciled with their mother.

== Reactions ==
The book's publication in 1978 created an enormous amount of attention.

Some of Joan's friends disputed the version of events presented in ''Mommie Dearest''. Among them were [[Van Johnson]], [[Cesar Romero]], [[Bob Hope]], [[Barbara Stanwyck]], [[Sydney Guilaroff]], [[Ann Blyth]], [[Gary Gray (actor)|Gary Gray]], and particularly [[Myrna Loy]],&lt;ref&gt;"....f ever there was a girl who needed a good whack it was spoiled, horrible Christina. Believe me, there were many times I wanted to smack her myself." - Myrna Loy in: [https://books.google.com/books?id=skmnEUj3C84C&amp;pg=PA261&amp;lpg=PA261&amp;dq=if+ever+there+was+a+girl+who+needed+a+good+whack+it+was+spoiled,+horrible+Christina++Believe+me,+there+were+many+times+I+wanted+to+smack+her+myself.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ihiTq1IChc&amp;sig=NCBfHymicmZwxBtDajF1RlaTqRA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjmnqL2x8nOAhUG0WMKHaUcCBcQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=if%20ever%20there%20was%20a%20girl%20who%20needed%20a%20good%20whack%20it%20was%20spoiled%2C%20horrible%20Christina%20%20Believe%20me%2C%20there%20were%20many%20times%20I%20wanted%20to%20smack%20her%20myself.&amp;f=false Joan Crawford: The Essential Biography By Lawrence J. Quirk, William Schoel. University Press of Kentucky.]&lt;/ref&gt; Joan's friend since 1925. While acknowledging that Joan was highly ambitious and an [[alcoholic]] for much of her life, critics have suggested that Christina embellished her story. [[Douglas Fairbanks Jr.]], Crawford's first husband, described the book by stating, "The Joan Crawford that I've heard about in ''Mommie Dearest'' is not the Joan Crawford I knew back then." The two younger Crawford children, Cindy and Cathy, born 1947 and both adopted by Crawford, have stated categorically many times that they did not witness or experience any of the events that were described in the book. However, Christopher always staunchly defended Christina's claims, saying of their mother in 1978, "I honestly to this day do not believe that she ever cared for me."&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Jerry (October 1, 1978). "Like Daughter, Like Son Chris". ''Newsday''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Liz Smith (journalist)|Liz Smith]], writing in the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'', said, "I was inclined to believe Joan was misguided in her attempts to 'mold' her children—and was vain and self-absorbed like most great stars—but the stories of beatings and near-madness were over the top."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2008-02-06/features/0802060054_1_joan-crawford-charlotte-chandler-christina |first=Liz |last=Smith |authorlink=Liz Smith (journalist) |title=New book gives another view of Joan Crawford as a `Mommie' |publisher=Baltimore Sun |work=baltimoresun.com |date=February 6, 2008 |accessdate=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford's secretary for nearly 50 years, Betty Barker, also stated that while Joan was strict, Christina and Christopher were never abused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Elizabeth |last=Day |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/25/biography.film |title=I'll never forgive Mommie: Joan Crawford's daughter gives first interview in 10 years |work= The Observer |publisher=Guardian |date=May 25, 2008 |accessdate=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Joan's friends [[Helen Hayes]],&lt;ref name="Hayes"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hayes|first1=Helen|authorlink1=Helen Hayes|last2=Hatch|first2=Katherine |title=My Life in Three Acts|year=1990 |publisher=Harcourt, Brace Jovanovich|isbn=0-15-163695-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James MacArthur]],&lt;ref name="Redbook"/&gt; [[June Allyson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allyson|first1=June|authorlink1=June Allyson |last2= Leighton|first2=Frances Spatz|title=June Allyson|year=1983|publisher=Berkley|location=New York| isbn=0-425-06251-1| pages=77–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rex Reed]],&lt;ref name="Redbook"&gt;''Redbook'' v. 165, Redbook Publishing, Inc. p. 25. OCLC 1763595.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Betty Hutton]]&lt;ref name=op[qaw /&gt; have verified some of the stories in Christina's book and claimed they also witnessed some of the abuse in person. Hutton had previously lived near Crawford's [[Brentwood, Los Angeles, California|Brentwood]] home and has stated that she saw the children during or after various moments of abuse.&lt;ref name=op[qaw&gt;{{cite web|author=Meredy |url=http://www.meredy.com/joancrawford/bio.html |title=Joan Crawford - Movie Star - Biography |publisher=Meredy.com |date= |accessdate=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hutton stated she would often encourage her own children to play with Christina and Christopher to draw them away from their challenges at home.&lt;ref name=op[qaw /&gt; Joan's ''[[Mildred Pierce]]'' co-star, actress [[Eve Arden]], sided with Christina about Joan's parenting abilities and said that she suffered from [[bipolar disorder]] and was a good woman in many ways but as an alcoholic with a violent temper, she was simply unfit to be a mother. In the book ''Understanding the Borderline Mother'', author Christine Ann Lawson suggests that Joan may have had [[borderline personality disorder]] (BPD),&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, Christine Ann. ''Understanding the borderline mother: helping her children transcend the intense, unpredictable, and volatile relationship," (Jason Aronson, 2002), [https://books.google.com/books?id=8LwgAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Borderline+personality+disorder%22+%2B+%22Joan+crawford%22&amp;dq=%22Borderline+personality+disorder%22+%2B+%22Joan+crawford%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-WtzT-WGB4rL0QGMg7T-Ag&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAg p. 5 (at Google Books)]. {{ISBN|0-7657-0331-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7657-0331-6}} Accessed March 28, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; along with an obsessive compulsion with cleanliness.

== Epilogue ==
The last pages of Christina's book suggest that she was not about to let her mother have the "last word" by omitting her daughter from her will. Later biographers&lt;ref name=iopqa&gt;Guiles, Fred Laurence. ''Joan Crawford: The Last Word'', Carol Publishing Corporation (1995), {{ISBN|1-55972-269-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; have reported that Christina began writing her book before Crawford's death and have suggested that Joan's knowledge of its contents may have been a factor in Joan Crawford cutting her daughter from her will.&lt;ref name=iopqa /&gt;

Christina has stood by her story and later released a "20th Anniversary Edition", which includes 100 pages of new material and omits about 50 pages of original material. The second edition names certain individuals not named in the original book and focuses more on Christina's relationship with her mother from her high school graduation until the 1970s. It also reveals what became of her brother and describes several incidents involving him.

Released by a smaller publishing company, the second edition included some unconventional promotional methods. In 1981, the book had been adapted as a [[Mommie Dearest (film)|movie]] starring [[Faye Dunaway]] to which the shocked Christina gave negative feedback and lectures on the new edition at screenings of the film. Christina also appeared at readings with [[drag (clothing)|drag]] entertainer [[John Epperson|Lypsinka]], who has made numerous appearances as Joan Crawford during stage acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metroweekly.com/feature/?ak=2536 |title=Lypsinka Dearest: John Epperson, as icon Lypsinka, recreates Hollywood legend, Joan Crawford, at Studio Theatre|website=Metroweekly.com |date=February 8, 2007 |accessdate=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2017 Crawford worked with lyricist and composer [[David Nehls]] on a stage musical adaptation of ''Mommie Dearest'', which was produced by Out of the Box Theatrics in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/off-broadway/article/Out-of-the-Box-Theatrics-Presents-Reading-of-MOMMIE-DEAREST-20170901|title=Out of the Box Theatrics Presents Reading of MOMMIE DEAREST|last=Desk|first=BWW News|work=BroadwayWorld.com|access-date=2017-09-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mormon Literature &amp; Creative Arts''' is a database of [[Latter-day Saint]] media and creators. It contains entries on film, music, and writings, as well as directors, composers, and writers. It is "an important critical resource that seeks to comprehensively list literary writings and associated artistic works by and about Mormons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.mormonletters.org/?p=960 |title=Mormon LitCrit: Help Us Get It Right? |first=Chris |last=Bigelow |work=Dawning of a Brighter Day |publisher=[[Association for Mormon Letters]] |date=January 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As evidenced by its name, it launched as a catalogue of Mormon authors and literature in the mid-1990s by Gideon Burton, a [[BYU]] English professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mormonlit.lib.byu.edu/html/credits.html |title=Mormon Literature Database – Credits and History |publisher=[[Brigham Young University]] |accessdate=2014-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was further expanded as a [[relational database]] called the '''Mormon Literature Database''' in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Announcing the Mormon Literature Database |journal=Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought |volume=36 |number=2 |date=Summer 2003 |pages=231–233 |url=http://dialoguejournal.metapress.com/app/home/content.asp?referrer=contribution&amp;format=2&amp;page=1&amp;pagecount=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2007 was expanded to include other forms of media, and was newly christened Mormon Literature &amp; Creative Arts (MLCA). It is currently sponsored by BYU's [[Harold B. Lee Library]].

A '''music executive''' or '''record executive''' is a person within a [[record label]] who works in senior management, making executive decisions over the label's artists. Their role varies greatly but in essence, they can oversee one, or many, aspects of a record label, including [[A&amp;R]], [[Recording contract|contract]]s, [[music management|management]], [[Music publisher (popular music)|publishing]], [[record producer|production]], [[manufacturing|manufacture]], [[marketing]]/[[Promotion (marketing)|promotion]], [[Record distributor|distribution]], [[copyright]], and [[concert tour|touring]]. Although music executives work in senior management, a number of music executives have gone on to establish their own record labels as owners themselves, sometimes being involved in the music industry initially as artists, A&amp;Rs, or producers for a number of years and building a strong reputation.

Music executives work in a variety of settings for "major" record labels such as [[Universal Music Group]], [[Sony Music Entertainment]], or [[Warner Music Group]]. However, many choose to work with, or start their own [[independent record labels]] such as [[Sub Pop]], [[Block Starz Music]], [[Ironworks (record label)|Ironworks]] and [[Jagjaguwar]].

{{nihongo|'''Renhō Murata'''|村田 蓮舫|Murata Renhō|extra=born 28 November 1967}}, commonly called just {{Nihongo4|'''Renhō'''|蓮舫}}, is a [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] [[Japanese people|Japanese]] politician and former journalist who is a current member of [[House of Councillors (Japan)|House of Councillors]]. She was the leader of the major Japanese political party, the [[Democratic Party (Japan, 2016)|Democratic Party]].

== Early and personal life==
Born '''Hsieh Lien-fang''' ({{cjkv|c=謝蓮舫|p=Xiè Liánfǎng|r=Sha Renhō}}) in [[Tokyo]] to a [[Taiwan]]ese father ({{nihongo4||謝哲信|Xiè Zhéxìn}}) and Japanese mother ({{nihongo4||斉藤圭子|Saitō Keiko}}), she studied at [[Aoyama Gakuin]] in Tokyo from kindergarten through university. She enrolled in the law faculty of [[Aoyama Gakuin University]] and graduated in 1990 with the [[Bachelor of Laws|B.L.]] degree in [[public law|Public Law]]. Born as a citizen of the Republic of China , she did not become a citizen of Japan until 1985 when the [[Japanese nationality law|Nationality Law]] was amended to allow Japanese mothers to pass Japanese nationality to their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://ukinjapan.fco.gov.uk/en/help-for-british-nationals/living-in-japan/marriage-birth-death/how-register-birth| title = Birth Registration| accessdate = 10 June 2010| publisher = British Embassy in Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://renho.jp/profile| title = Renho Profile| accessdate = 10 June 2010
| publisher = Official Renho Website| language = Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was legally a [[Multiple citizenship|dual citizen]] until 2016.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201707190042.html|title=It's official ... opposition leader Renho is 100% Japanese|last=|first=|date=2017-07-19|work=The Asahi Shimbun|access-date=2017-10-10|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; She adopted her mother's surname, {{nihongo4||斉藤|Saitō}}, when she acquired Japanese citizenship; to avoid name confusion in her career, she began to go simply by '''Renhō'''.

After her debut as a [[Clarion Girl]] in 1988, Renhō appeared on several television and radio programs as a commentator. In 1993, she became a newscaster on [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] and [[TV Asahi]], covering several historical events including the [[Great Hanshin earthquake]].&lt;ref name=" Cabinet Profiles "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/cabinet/cabinet.html?formed=20100608_01&amp;date=20100608&amp;member=17|title=Renho, Cabinet Profiles, Kan Cabinet (Formed 8 June 2010|publisher=The Japan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was married in 1993 and studied the [[Chinese language]] at [[Peking University]] from 1995 to 1997. Renhō returned to television in 2000, anchoring and reporting on several TBS programs.&lt;ref name="Cabinet Profiles "/&gt; She reported from Taiwan during [[Chen Shui-bian]]'s presidential campaign, which brought her to the attention of Taiwanese political leaders.&lt;ref name="taipeitimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2004/08/16/2003198960 |title=Japanese politician with roots in Taiwan latest media darling |work=Taipei Times |date=16 Aug 2004 |page=3 |author=Su, Joy}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite news |author=Huang Tai-lin |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2004/08/17/2003199064 |title=President wants Ren Hou to be bridge |work=Taipei Times |date=17 Aug 2004 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Taiwan, she is often referred to as '''Lien-fang''', the [[Standard Chinese]] pronunciation of her given name.

==Political career==
In July 2004, Renhō was elected to the House of Councillors representing Tokyo as a member of the [[Democratic Party (Japan, 1998)|Democratic Party of Japan]]. Since election, she has been heavily involved in parenting issues and policies.&lt;ref name="Cabinet Profiles "/&gt; Renhō has criticized Japan's diplomacy with China and its refusal to recognize Taiwan, stating that "Japan is too polite when dealing with China, taking a low profile" and "Taiwan is my father's country. Why isn't Taiwan a country?"&lt;ref name="taipeitimes"/&gt; Since taking office, she has traveled to Taiwan several times on official and unofficial business, garnering extensive public and media attention, and has become close to senior members of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]].&lt;ref name="taipeitimes" /&gt;

=== DPJ government (2009-12) ===
After the DPJ assumed the reins of government in September 2009, she received much public attention for her stern stance and direct questions to bureaucrats during special [[finance|fiscal]] screening committees of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Government Revitalization Unit|ja|3=行政刷新会議}} established under [[Yukio Hatoyama]].&lt;ref name="Cabinet Profiles "/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20100605p2g00m0fp031000c.html PROFILE: Renho spotlighted in waste-cutting debate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611063914/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20100605p2g00m0fp031000c.html |date=2010-06-11 }}, [[Mainichi]], 5 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, then Prime Minister [[Naoto Kan]] appointed her as Minister for Administrative Reforms.&lt;ref name=pesek&gt;{{cite news|last=Pesek|first=William|title=Ex-Model Gives Economic Change New Meaning|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-06-09/former-model-gives-meaning-to-economic-change-commentary-by-william-pesek.html|accessdate=12 January 2013|newspaper=Bloomberg L.P.|date=9 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon taking the post, Renhō stated that she would be giving particular attention to eliminating waste in the 21 government account.&lt;ref&gt;Hongo, Jun, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100609x2.html Renho beats drum against waste]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 10 June 2010, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; She lost her seat in Cabinet in a subsequent reshuffle, but was retained as a special advisor to the Prime Minister.

In the [[Japanese House of Councillors election, 2010|2010 House of Councillors election]], she garnered a record 1,710,734 constituency votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/election/sangiin/2010/profile/ye13004.htm |title=蓮 舫 : プロフィル : 参院選2010 : 参院選 : 選挙 : YOMIURI ONLINE（読売新聞） |publisher=Yomiuri.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also served as a member of the [[Cabinet of Japan]] from 2010 to 2012, serving as Minister for Government Revitalisation and [[Minister of State for Consumer Affairs and Food Safety]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In September 2011, she was re-appointed as State Minister of Government Revitalization (responsible for administrative reforms) in the cabinet of then prime minister [[Yoshihiko Noda]]. Her new portfolio also included responsibility for civil service reform, gender equality and Japan's declining birthrate. She served in this post until a cabinet reshuffle in January 2012.

The DPJ was ousted from government in the [[Japanese general election, 2012|2012 general election]], following which Renhō returned to the opposition bench. She retained her seat in the [[Japanese House of Councillors election, 2016|2016 House of Councillors Election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/07/10/national/politics-diplomacy/dps-renho-wins-third-upper-house-term/#.V465srgrJeV |title=DP's Renho wins third Upper House term |publisher=The Japan Times |date=2016-07-10 |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Head of the Democratic Party (2016-17) ===
In [[Democratic Party (Japan, 2016) leadership election, 2016|September 2016, she was elected as the leader of Japan's Democratic Party]], making her the first woman elected as their leader and the first person with mixed ethnic heritage and dual-citizenship to head a major political party in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Japan’s Democratic Party Elects Renho as New Leader |date=September 15, 2016 |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/japans-democratic-party-elects-renho-as-new-leader-1473918605}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/782214/japans-opposition-party-just-elected-renho-murata-to-be-its-leader-the-first-time-a-woman-will-fill-the-role/ |title=Japan’s opposition party just elected Renho Murata to be its leader—the first time a woman will fill the role — Quartz |publisher=Qz.com |date=2016 |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon her election as president of the Democratic Party, ''[[The Japan Times]]'' reported on several of her policies. They reported that she is opposed to revisions of [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution|Article 9 of the Constitution]], but is willing to join debates with the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] on other constitutional revisions. They also reported that she views [[Abenomics]] to be a partial success, but pushes for greater investment in education, child-rearing and nursing care. She has also ruled out forming a coalition government with the [[Japanese Communist Party]] and opposes the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/09/15/national/politics-diplomacy/renho-elected-leader-of-main-opposition-democratic-party/ "Renhō elected leader of main opposition Democratic Party"]. ''[[The Japan Times]]''. Published 15 September 2016. &lt;br&gt; Retrieved 28 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the presidential election, Renhō claimed that she had given up her Taiwanese citizenship. However, reports emerged that her Taiwanese citizenship had not been properly renounced. In response to doubts regarding her legal status, she took steps to renounce her Taiwanese citizenship beginning in late 2016.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In July 2017, the Democratic Party suffered a very poor showing in the [[Tokyo prefectural election, 2017|Tokyo prefectural election]]. Some senior party members blamed the results, in part, on the ongoing questions surrounding Renhō's citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20170719/p2a/00m/0na/021000c|title=Renho's nationality disclosure raises discrimination concerns, fails to unite DP|date=2017-07-19|work=Mainichi Daily News|access-date=2017-10-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to these concerns, she provided evidence of her renunciation of Taiwanese citizenship at a press conference later that month.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Days after her press conference, and days following the resignation of former prime minister [[Yoshihiko Noda]] as party secretary-general, Renhō resigned as head of the party, stating that she had not shown sufficient ability to lead it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-27/japan-s-main-opposition-leader-resigns-amid-turmoil-in-her-party|title=Japan's Main Opposition Leader Resigns Amid Turmoil in Her Party|date=2017-07-27|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/japan-opposition-leader-renho-steps-down/news-story/820fb972025906d96374f68a9df289dc|title=Japan opposition leader Renho steps down|date= 27 July 2017|accessdate=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the CDP (2017-) ===
Dissatisfied with the ambiguous direction of the DP leadership post the [[Japanese general election, 2017|2017 election]], Renho expressed interest in joining the new progressive [[Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan|Constitutional Democratic Party]] and had an exploratory talk with CDP leader [[Yukio Edano]] in mid-December.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/12/15/national/politics-diplomacy/frustrated-ex-dp-chief-renho-wants-know-kind-party-cdp|title=Frustrated ex-DP chief Renho wants to know ‘what kind of party’ CDP is|author=[[Jiji Press]] via [[Japan Times]]|date=2017-12-15|access-date=2017-12-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She applied to join the CDP on December 26, 2017 citing the DP's lack of policy directions and the CDP's conversely clear policy directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20171226-00000050-jij-pol|title=蓮舫元代表も立憲入りへ＝民進、混迷深まる|author=[[Jiji Press]] via [[Yahoo!

'''''Santa Cristina al Tiverone Altarpiece'''''  is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter [[Lorenzo Lotto]], executed around 1504-1506. It is still housed in its original location, the parish church of Santa Cristina in Quinto di Treviso, a ''[[frazione]]'' of [[Treviso]], northern [[Italy]]. 

Measuring 90x179&amp;nbsp;cm ([[lunette]]) and 177x162&amp;nbsp;cm (central panel), it is signed "Laurentius / Lotus / P.[inxit]" at the base of the throne. It was perhaps commissioned around 1505 by bishop [[Bernardo de' Rossi]], in whose court Lotto worked at the time. It was released on 14 May 1507, just before the artists' move to [[Recanati]].

==Description==
The main panel, of rectangular shape, shows a [[sacred conversation]] with ''Madonna and Child'' sitting on a large throne. Around her are the saints Peter, Christine, Liberalis and Jerome, all enclosed within a classical style architecture. 

The composition derives from [[Giovanni Bellini]]'s [[San Zaccaria Altarpiece]], as testified by the niche in the throne with Byzantine mosaics, and the oriental carpet at Mary's feet. Perhaps inspired by [[Giorgione]]'s ''[[Castelfranco Madonna]]'' is the figure of Liberalis, the patron saint of Treviso, as a knight holding a model of the city in a hand.

The baby Jesus holds a [[Carduelis|goldfinch]], an allegory of his future Passion. The right side opens on an external wall covered by grass. 

The lunette shows instead a ''[[Pietà]]'', also based on Bellini, with the dead Christ supported by two angels.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2624">'''Serial imagery''' is the repeating of one image in many variations or forms. It is a central idea in modern and contemporary art. It can take several forms. A portrait can painted in differing hues and backgrounds with subtle changes to the subject as in Van Gogh's L'Arlésienne and Claude Monet’s [[Rouen Cathedral (Monet)|Rouen Cathedral]] Another type is where the same subject is painted at different times of day or seasons of the year for example [[Claude Monet]] in his [[Poplar Series (Monet)|Poplars]], [[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks]].  The same subject may also be rendered in different mediums, and in different poses, thus, the practice of underpainting may be considered a form of serial imagery even if the image is lost in the completed work. It is common in photography where multiple exposures at varies angles are taken with different lenses etc. in search of the desired effect. It is also used in literature, especially poetry.

	Some say the [[Impressionists]] and their contemporaries were the first to use it, but this is not the case. It was used by [[Francisco Goya]] with his La maja desnuda and La maja vestida (1797-1800).  It is seen in classical art whenever studies were made and used to produce a finished work. This was a common practice for [[Leonardo da Vinci]]', Michelangelo and most of the other classical artists although most of their studies and sketches did not survive.

	Here is an example from literature.


    What Say You? 
   (By Eric Ericson)
 
 What say you faithful tree?
 In summer’s glory standing tall 
 while autumn’s minions sneak 
 to steal your green,
 so you go necked into winter.
 
 What say you faithful tree? 
 In golden robes resplendent, 
 your arm’s reach skyward 
 showing off your finery,
 knowing this to shall pass. 
 
 What say you faithful tree
 standing necked in the snow?
 I would pity you,
 as winter’s icy breath bites
 your fingers and tears your flesh,
 but you don’t want me to.
 
 What say you faithful tree?
 As the sun turns warm
 all clad in white blossoms
 with velvet leaves
 just beginning to show.
 What say you?

'''Sir Edward Seymour Hicks''' (30 January 1871 – 6 April 1949), better known as '''Seymour Hicks''', was a British actor, [[music hall]] performer, playwright, screenwriter, [[actor-manager]] and producer. He became known, early in his career, for writing, starring in and producing [[Edwardian musical comedy]], often together with his famous wife, [[Ellaline Terriss]]. His most famous acting role was that of [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] in [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[A Christmas Carol]]''.

Making his stage début at the age of nine and performing professionally by sixteen, Hicks joined a theatrical company and toured America before starring in ''Under the Clock'' in 1893, the first musical [[revue]] ever staged in London. Following this, he starred in a revival of ''[[Little Jack Sheppard]]'' at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London]] which brought him to the attention of impresario [[George Edwardes]]. Edwardes cast Hicks in his next show, ''[[The Shop Girl]]'', in 1894. Its success led to his participation in two more of Edwardes's hit "girl" musicals, ''[[The Circus Girl]]'' (1896) and ''[[A Runaway Girl]]'' (1898), both starring Terriss. He first played the role of Ebenezer Scrooge in 1901 and eventually played it thousands of times onstage. Hicks, along with his wife, joined the producer [[Charles Frohman]] in his theatre company and wrote and starred in a series of extraordinarily successful musicals, including ''[[Bluebell in Fairyland]]'' (1901), ''[[Quality Street (play)|Quality Street]]'' (1902), ''[[The Earl and the Girl]]'' (1903) and ''[[The Catch of the Season]]'' (1904).

Hicks used his fortune from these shows to commission the building of the [[Aldwych Theatre]] in 1905 and the [[Gielgud Theatre|Hicks Theatre]] in 1906, opening the latter with a new hit show, ''[[The Beauty of Bath]]''. His stage performances were less successful in later years, and he opted instead to star in music hall tours, including ''Pebbles on the Beach'' (1912). He continued to write light comedies, the most popular of which was ''[[The Happy Day]]'' (1916). On film, he first appeared in ''[[Scrooge (1913 film)|Scrooge]]'' and ''[[David Garrick (1913 film)|David Garrick]]'' both from 1913. Later notable films included ''[[The Lambeth Walk (film)|The Lambeth Walk]]'' (1939) and ''[[Busman's Honeymoon (film)|Busman's Honeymoon]]'' (1940), and his last film was in the year of his death, 1949.

==Life and career==
Hicks was born in [[Saint Helier|St. Hélier]] on the island of [[Jersey]]. At the age of nine, he appeared as Little Buttercup in [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' at his school in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. After that, he was determined to be an actor.

===Early career===
[[File:1917c.jpg|thumb|upright|Hicks in "A Court Scandal", 1899]]
Hicks first appeared professionally on stage at the age of sixteen in a production of ''In the Ranks'' at the Grand, Islington. In 1889, he joined the theatrical company of [[William Hunter Kendal|Mr.]] and [[Madge Kendal|Mrs. Kendal]] for an American tour where they presented a repertory of contemporary plays. Hicks starred as Dr. Watson in the first revue show ever staged in London, ''Under the Clock'' (1893), a parody of [[Sherlock Holmes]] and Watson written by Hicks with [[Charles Brookfield]] (who played Holmes), at the Royal Court Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://special.lib.umn.edu/rare/ush/10E1.html Special Collections: K Plays], University of Minnesota, 8 April 2005, accessed 18 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he married [[Ellaline Terriss]].&lt;ref name=TerrissDNB&gt;Taylor, C.M.P. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/40483 Terriss, Ellaline. ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''], Oxford University Press, accessed 7 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; After that, he starred in a revival of ''[[Little Jack Sheppard]]'' at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London]]. This brought him to the attention of the impresario [[George Edwardes]]. In 1894, Hicks joined his wife in the successful "Fairy [[pantomime]]", ''[[Cinderella]]'', produced by [[Henry Irving]] with music by Oscar Barrett, where she had been playing the title role. He played Thisbe, one of Cinderella's half-sisters who, in this version, were "[[Girton College]] girls who can jabber Greek and Latin, read French, play golf, and indulge in manly exercises. Thisbe has an affectation for intellectuality – Ibsen, Spooks, and the new humor."

Edwardes gave Hicks the chance to star in his next show, ''[[The Shop Girl]]'' (1894), which became a hit at the Gaiety in 1894, playing for 546 performances. Hicks's wife joined Edwardes's company during the run of the show, replacing the star in the title role, and together they made the musical an even bigger hit. The following year, Hicks transferred with the show to [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] for a short run&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Green| first=Stanley| title=Encyclopedia of the Musical Theatre|year=1991|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=978-0-306-80113-6|pages=378|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWIRAljCR7oC&amp;pg=PA378}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then toured in America in 1895 with his wife, where they befriended the American novelist [[Richard Harding Davis]]. At the instance of [[W. S. Gilbert]], Hicks wrote a drama called ''One of the Best'', a vehicle for his father-in-law [[William Terriss]] at the [[Adelphi Theatre]], based on the famous [[Dreyfus Trial]]. The Hickses were frequent guests of Gilbert at his estate in [[Grim's Dyke]]. Hicks hurried back from America for the opening in December 1895. It ran for over a year.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, pp. 307–08&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early success for the young couple was ''[[The Circus Girl]]'' (1896). Hicks and Terriss both had a comedy background, and they transformed the "lovers" roles in the new genre of Edwardian musicals from overly sentimental to mischievous and light-hearted characters exchanging witty banter. Hicks then worked as co-author on ''[[The Yashmak]]'' and then on one of the Gaiety Theatre's most successful shows, ''[[A Runaway Girl]]'' (1898), in which Terriss played the title role. This was followed by ''With Flying Colours'' (1899). Also in 1899, Hicks starred as the Duc De Richelieu in ''A Court Scandal'', a comedy adapted by Aubrey Boucicault and Osmond Shillingford from ''Les Premières Armes de Richelieu'' by [[Dumanoir]], at the Court Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lafayette.150m.com/hic1918.html ''A Court Scandal''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210183354/http://lafayette.150m.com/hic1918.html |date=10 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, he and Terriss adopted a daughter, Mabel, and Terriss gave birth to their second child, Elizabeth ("Betty), in 1904.&lt;ref name=TerrissDNB/&gt;

===Frohman years===
[[File:Cover of the Vocal Score of Seymour Hicks' The Earl and the Girl.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Cover of Vocal Score]]
In early 1900, the Hickses played in their only Broadway show together, ''My Daughter-in-law'', at the Frohman brothers' [[Lyceum Theatre (New York, 1885–1902)|old Lyceum Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=5154 ''My Daughter-in-law''], IBDB, accessed 11 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; They then joined forces with producer [[Charles Frohman]] and, in his company, over a period of seven years, they played the leads in a series of musicals written by Hicks, including ''[[Bluebell in Fairyland]]'' (1901 with music by [[Walter Slaughter]] and lyrics by [[Charles H. Taylor (lyricist)|Charles Taylor]] – this Christmas show for children was continually revived for the next four decades) and ''[[The Cherry Girl]]'' (1902). Hicks and Terriss also starred in ''[[Quality Street (play)|Quality Street]]'' in 1902. At that time, they moved to a new home, The Old Forge, at Merstham, Surrey. Their cul-de-sac was renamed "Quality Street".

Hicks also wrote the highly successful ''[[The Earl and the Girl]]'' (1903) and the successful ''[[The Catch of the Season]]'' (1904 with [[Herbert Haines]] and Taylor). Ellaline was pregnant with Betty, and so [[Zena Dare]] originated the leading role in ''The Catch of the Season'' until Terriss could assume the role. Hicks wrote, and Frohman produced, ''The Talk of the Town'' (1905 with Haines and Taylor),&lt;ref&gt;Moss, Simon. [http://www.c20th.com/GSarchiveother.htm Programme and description of ''The Talk of the Town'',] ''Gilbert &amp; Sullivan, a selling exhibition of memorabilia, Archive: Other items''&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Beauty of Bath]]'' (1906 with Haines and Taylor; the show included additional lyrics by newcomer [[P. G. Wodehouse]] and additional music by [[Jerome Kern]]), ''My Darling'' (1907 with Haines),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guidetomusicaltheatre.com/shows_m/MyDarling.html ''My Darling''], the Guide to Musical Theatre, accessed 25 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Gay Gordons (musical)|The Gay Gordons]]'' (1907). Hicks used some of the fortune he received from these shows to build the [[Aldwych Theatre]] in 1905 and the [[Gielgud Theatre|Hicks Theatre]] in 1906, which was renamed the "Globe Theatre" in 1909 and then the "Gielgud Theatre" in 1994. ''The Beauty of Bath'' was the first production at the theatre.

===Later stage work===
[[File:Hicks1.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Drawing of Hicks in ''[[Quality Street (play)|Quality Street]]'']]
In ''The Dashing Little Duke'' (1909; with [[C. Hayden Coffin]], [[Courtice Pounds]] and [[Louie Pounds]]), produced by Hicks at the Hicks Theatre, which was less successful, Hicks' wife played the title role (a woman playing a man).&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Colin. [http://www.gsarchive.net/british/dashing/index.html Information about, and MIDI files for, ''The Dashing Little Duke''], 2003, The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 31 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt; When she missed several performances due to illness, Hicks played the role – possibly the only case in the history of a musical where a husband succeeded to his wife's role. The piece was based on ''A Court Scandal'', in which Hicks had played in 1899. Hicks then wrote and starred in ''Captain Kidd'' (1910), an adaptation with music and lyrics by [[Leslie Stuart]] and [[Adrian Ross]], of the American farce ''The Dictator'' (1904 by [[Richard Harding Davis]]).&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; This flopped, bringing an end to the era of supremacy in London's musical theatre of Hicks and Terriss.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/british/authors/hicks.html Seymour Hicks], British Musical Theatre, 31 August 2004 Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 2 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Hicks appeared in his first [[Shakespeare]] play that year, ''Richard III''. The same year, he penned the first of several autobiographies. The following year, he took a company on a tour of South Africa. After the outbreak of [[World War I]], Hicks was the first British actor to bring a tour to France (with Terriss), giving concerts to British troops at the front. Because of this, he was awarded the [[Croix de Guerre 1914–1918 (France)|French Croix de Guerre]]. Hicks was briefly declared bankrupt in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;"Mr. Seymour Hicks", ''Western Times'', 3 December 1915, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Mr Seymour Hicks and his Creditors", ''The Glasgow Herald'', 19 October 1915, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Hicks and Terriss concentrated on comedy roles and music hall tours in later years, including ''Pebbles on the Beach'' (1912), singing and dancing 'Alexander's Ragtime Band'. Their one return to musical comedy, ''Cash on Delivery'' (1917), confirmed the public's preference for comedy revues and music hall. Hicks continued to write light, escapist comedies, such as ''[[The Happy Day]]'' (1916), ''Sleeping Partners'' (1917) and, after the war, satiric farces, such as ''Good Luck'' and ''Head Over Heels'' (1923) and adaptations of French farces (''The Man in Dress Clothes'').

===Film career, Scrooge and later years===

[[File:Mr&amp;Mrs Semour Hicks.jpg|thumb|upright|Hicks with Terriss and their daughter Betty]]
Hicks appeared in three early silent films: ''[[Scrooge (1913 film)|Scrooge]]'' and ''[[David Garrick (1913 film)|David Garrick]]'' in 1913, and ''A Prehistoric Love Story'' in 1915.&lt;ref name=BFI&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/individual/11959?view=credit "Hicks, Seymour"], British Film Institute, accessed 1 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He decided in 1923 to produce his own films. His first film, in which he starred, was ''[[Always Tell Your Wife]]'', which was based on one of his plays. While making that film, Hicks fired the director and hired an unknown young director to make his debut: [[Alfred Hitchcock]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/52225 ''Always Tell Your Wife''], British Film Institute, accessed 1 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Hicks directed ''Sleeping Partners'' (1930) and ''[[Glamour (1931 film)|Glamour]]'' (1931). In addition, over a dozen films were made either from his plays or his scripts, and he starred in about twenty films, many with his wife. One of his early films was ''[[Money for Nothing (1932 film)|Money for Nothing]]'' (1932)&lt;ref name=BFI/&gt;

In 1931, he was awarded the [[Legion d'honneur|Legion of Honour]] for his promotion of French drama on the English stage. In 1934, he had taken over [[Daly's Theatre]] in London, where he produced and appeared in a series of successful plays including ''Vintage Wine'' that he and [[Ashley Dukes]] adapted from a novel.

Hicks's most famous role was that of [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] in [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[A Christmas Carol]]''. He first played this role in 1901 and eventually played it thousands of times onstage, often at benefits, and twice on film: the 1913 [[silent film]] ''[[Scrooge (1913 film)|Scrooge]]'' and the 1935 film ''[[Scrooge (1935 film)|Scrooge]]'', produced in England. In 1926, [[Pathé Pictures]] released the 1913 film in America under the title ''Old Scrooge''. This 1926 print has been released on DVD. The 1935 ''Scrooge'' was the first feature-length film version of the story with sound. The film has been praised for its vivid atmosphere, but most of the ghosts in the film are not seen on screen, except for the [[Ghost of Christmas Present]] ([[Oscar Asche]]). [[Donald Calthrop]] portrays Bob Cratchit, and [[Maurice Evans (actor)|Maurice Evans]] has a bit part as one of Scrooge's debtors. Most prints in circulation are of the abridged, six-reel (hour-long) version. The film was seldom seen due to the popularity of the 1938 and the 1951 film versions of Dickens's novel. Poor-quality prints were shown on television in the 1980s, but in 2002 the film was restored to its original eight-reel length and issued on DVD. In 2007 the hour-long version was issued in a colourised edition.

Among his other film appearances, Hicks starred in the film version of his show ''[[Vintage Wine]]'' (1935) and as Sir John Tremayne in ''[[The Lambeth Walk (film)|The Lambeth Walk]]'' (1939), the film version of the stage musical ''[[Me and My Girl]]'', ''[[Young Man's Fancy (film)|Young Man's Fancy]]'' (1939), ''[[Pastor Hall]]'' (1940) and ''[[Busman's Honeymoon (film)|Busman's Honeymoon]]'' (1940).&lt;ref name=BFI/&gt; Hicks wrote for films until 1941 (''Kisses for Breakfast'', in which he starred, based on the French play ''The Matrimonial Bed'' by [[André Mouëzy-Éon]] and [[Yves Mirande]]). When World War II began, he acted, on 12 November 1939, as the master of ceremonies at the first concert given in France by the newly formed ENSA (Entertainment National Service Association). For this action, Hicks was awarded his second Croix de Guerre.

Hicks was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1934. Later films included ''[[Fame is the Spur (film)|Fame is the Spur]]'' (1947) and ''[[Silent Dust]]'' (1949).&lt;ref name=BFI/&gt; He continued appearing on stage and in films until a year before his death in [[Hampshire]], England, at the age of 78.

'''''The Great Sirens''''' ({{Lang-fr|'''Les grandes sirènes'''}}) is a large 1947 painting by the Belgian painter [[Paul Delvaux]] in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name="met"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/481994|title=The Great Sirens|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The picture depicts a group of partially nude women in moonlight, sitting motionless before a hill bearing two Greco-Roman style buildings. According to the description from the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], the setting "reveals the painter's admiration of the work of [[Giorgio de Chirico]]". The women in the foreground are unashamedly, if not threateningly, seductive and in the distance mermaids are working their magic on a lone individual in a bowler hat. The whole composition evokes fantasies of erotic love.&lt;ref name="met"/&gt;

The work is currently (2018) not on view.

==Provenance==
The painting was first exhibited at the Galerie René Drouin in Paris on 5 March 1948. It was bought by the dramatist Claude Spaak in 1949, after which it was sold several times to different collectors in Brussels. The American music producer [[Jean Aberbach]] bought it in 1967. He then traded it with his brother [[Julian Aberbach]], who wanted this painting and works by [[René Magritte]] in exchange for some sculptures by [[Alberto Giacometti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Biszick-Lockwood|first=Bar|year=2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uAwGCtXPvMgC&amp;pg=PA282|title=Restless Giant: The Life and Times of Jean Aberbach and Hill and Range Songs|location=[[Urbana, Illinois]]|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|p=282|isbn=978-0-252-03507-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julian Aberbach gave ''The Great Sirens'' to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in 1979.&lt;ref name="met" /&gt;

'''''The Silmarillion''''' &lt;small&gt;(pronounced: [[Sindarin|/sɪlmaˈrɪljɔn/]])&lt;/small&gt; is a collection of [[Mythopoeia|mythopoeic]] works by English writer [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], edited and published posthumously by his son, [[Christopher Tolkien]], in 1977, with assistance from [[Guy Gavriel Kay]].&lt;ref name="Silf"&gt;{{Harv|Silmarillion|1977|loc=Foreword|Ref=Silmarillion}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Silmarillion'', along with J. R. R. Tolkien's other works, forms an extensive, though incomplete, narrative that describes the universe of [[Eä]] in which are found the lands of [[Valinor]], [[Beleriand]], [[Númenor]], and [[Middle-earth]], within which ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' take place.

After the success of ''The Hobbit'', Tolkien's publisher requested a sequel. Tolkien sent them an early draft of ''The Silmarillion'' but they rejected the work as being obscure and "too Celtic". The result was that Tolkien began work on "A Long Expected Party", the first chapter of what he described at the time as "a new story about [[Hobbit]]s", which became ''The Lord of the Rings''.&lt;ref name=beleriand&gt;{{Citation|title=The Lays of Beleriand|last=Tolkien |first=J.R.R.|publisher=Ballantine|editor=Christopher Tolkien|pages=433–4|isbn=0-345-38818-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Silmarillion'' comprises five parts. The first part, ''[[Ainulindalë]]'', tells of the creation of Eä, the "world that ''is''". ''[[Valaquenta]]'', the second part, gives a description of the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]] and [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maiar]], the supernatural powers in Eä. The next section, ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', which forms the bulk of the collection, chronicles the history of the events before and during the [[First Age]], including the wars over the [[Silmaril]]s that gave the book its title. The fourth part, ''[[Akallabêth]]'', relates the history of the Downfall of Númenor and its people, which takes place in the [[Second Age]]. The final part, ''[[Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age]]'', is a brief account of the circumstances which led to and were presented in ''The Lord of the Rings''.

The five parts were initially separate works, but it was the elder Tolkien's express wish that they be published together.&lt;ref name="Silf" /&gt; Because J. R. R. Tolkien died before he finished revising the various legends, Christopher gathered material from his father's older writings to fill out the book. In a few cases, this meant that he had to devise completely new material in order to resolve gaps and inconsistencies in the narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=My father's "eviscerated" work – son of Hobbit scribe J.R.R. Tolkien finally speaks out|last=Rérolle|first=Raphaëlle|date=5 December 2012|publisher=Le Monde|url=http://www.worldcrunch.com/culture-society/my-father039s-quotevisceratedquot-work-son-of-hobbit-scribe-jrr-tolkien-finally-speaks-out}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
''The Silmarillion'', like Tolkien's other [[Middle-earth writings]], was meant to have taken place at some time in Earth's past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#165, 211}}&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with this idea, ''The Silmarillion'' is meant to have been translated from [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]]'s three-volume ''[[Red Book of Westmarch|Translations from the Elvish]]'', which he wrote while at [[Rivendell]].&lt;ref name="BoLTF"&gt;{{ME-ref|BolT|Foreword}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapters in the book include:
*"The [[Music of the Ainur]]"
*"Quenta Silmarillion" (the history of the [[Silmaril]]s and the war of the [[Noldor]] against [[Morgoth]])
*"Of [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]]"
*"[[Túrin Turambar]]" (closely associated with "[[Narn i Hîn Húrin|Narn i Chîn Húrin: The Tale of the Children of Húrin]]" in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' and ''[[The Children of Húrin]]'') &lt;!-- please note Chîn is the correct spelling --&gt;
*"Of [[Tuor]] and The Fall of [[Gondolin]]"
*"Of the Voyage of [[Eärendil]] and the [[War of Wrath]]"

The inside title page contains an inscription written in [[Tengwar]]. In the common script, it reads "The tales of the [[First Age]] when [[Morgoth]] dwelt in Middle-earth and the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] made war upon him for the recovery of the Silmarils to which are appended the downfall of Númenor and the history of the [[Rings of Power]] and the Third Age in which these tales come to their end."

==Synopsis==
{{Silmarillion}}

===''Ainulindalë'' and ''Valaquenta''===
{{Main article|Ainulindalë|Valaquenta}}

The first section of ''The Silmarillion'', ''Ainulindalë'' ("The Music of the [[Ainu (Middle-earth)|Ainur]]"&lt;ref name="SilNameIndex"&gt;{{Harv|Silmarillion|1977|loc=Index of Names|Ref=Silmarillion}}&lt;/ref&gt;), takes the form of a primary creation narrative. Eru ("The One"&lt;ref&gt;(Silmarillion 1977, pp. 15, 329)&lt;/ref&gt;), also called [[Eru Ilúvatar|Ilúvatar]] ("Father of All"), first created the Ainur, a group of eternal spirits or [[demiurge]]s, called "the offspring of his thought". Ilúvatar brought the Ainur together and showed them a theme, from which he bade them make a great music. [[Morgoth|Melkor]] – whom Ilúvatar had given the "greatest power and knowledge" of all the Ainur – broke from the harmony of the music to develop his own song. Some Ainur joined him, while others continued to follow Ilúvatar, causing discord in the music. This happened thrice, with Eru Ilúvatar successfully overpowering his rebellious subordinate with a new theme each time. Ilúvatar then stopped the music and showed them a vision of [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]] and its peoples. The vision disappeared after a while, and Ilúvatar offered the Ainur a chance to enter into Arda and govern over the new world.

Many Ainur descended, taking physical form and becoming bound to that world. The greater Ainur became known as the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]], while the lesser Ainur were called the [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maiar]]. The Valar attempted to prepare the world for the coming inhabitants (Elves and [[Men (Middle-earth)|Men]]), while Melkor, who wanted Arda for himself, repeatedly destroyed their work; this went on for thousands of years until, through waves of destruction and creation, the world took shape.

''Valaquenta'' ("Account of the Valar"&lt;ref name="SilNameIndex" /&gt;) describes Melkor and each of the 14 Valar in detail, as well as a few of the Maiar. It also reveals how Melkor seduced many Maiar – including those who would eventually become [[Sauron]] and the [[Balrog]]s – into his service.

===''Quenta Silmarillion''===
{{Main article|Quenta Silmarillion}}

''Quenta Silmarillion'' ("The History of the [[Silmaril]]s"&lt;ref name="SilNameIndex" /&gt;), which makes up the bulk of the book, is a series of interconnected tales set in the First Age that make up the tragic saga of the three jewels, the Silmarils.

The Valar had attempted to fashion the world for [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] and [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]], but Melkor continually destroyed their handiwork. After he destroyed the two lamps that illuminated the world, the Valar moved to [[Aman (Middle-earth)|Aman]], a continent to the west of Middle-earth, where they established their home called [[Valinor]]. [[Yavanna]] created [[Two Trees of Valinor|Two Trees]] that illuminated Valinor and left Middle-earth to darkness and Melkor. Soon after, stars created by [[Varda]] began to shine and the [[Awakening of the Elves|Elves awoke]]. The elves originally formed three groups: the [[Vanyar]], the [[Noldor]], and the [[Teleri]], though some elves were captured and enslaved by Melkor, eventually to be bred into [[orc]]s. Knowing the danger the Elves were in, the Valar decided to fight Melkor to keep the Elves safe. After defeating and capturing Melkor, they invited the Elves to live in Aman. Many Elves travelled to Aman, while others refused and still others stopped along the way, including the Elves who later became the [[Sindar]], ruled by the Elf King [[Thingol]] and [[Melian]], a Maia. Of the three tribes that set out, all of the [[Vanyar]] and [[Noldor]], and many of the [[Teleri]] reached Aman.

In Aman, [[Fëanor]], son of [[Finwë]], King of the Noldor, created the Silmarils, jewels that glowed with the light of the Two Trees. Melkor, who had been held in captivity by the Valar, was eventually released after feigning repentance. Upon release, Melkor deceived Fëanor into believing that his eldest half-brother [[Fingolfin]] was attempting a coup against [[Finwë]]. This rift led to the banishment of [[Fëanor]] from the Noldor city [[Tirion]], and Fëanor thereafter created the fortress Formenos to the North of [[Tirion]]. Finwë moved to Formenos to live with Fëanor, his favourite of three sons, and there they safely kept the Silmarils. After many years, Fëanor travelled to Tirion to make amends with Fingolfin, while Finwë stayed at Formenos. While making amends, Melkor destroyed the Two Trees with the help of [[Ungoliant]], a dark spider spirit Melkor found in Avathar, on the Southeast side of Aman. Together, Melkor and Ungoliant then escaped to Formenos, killed Finwë, stole the Silmarils, and fled to Middle-earth. Melkor kept the Silmarils and banished Ungoliant, later attacking the Elvish kingdom of [[Doriath]], ruled by the Elf King [[Thingol]] and his wife [[Melian]]. He was defeated in the [[Battles of Beleriand|first of five battles of Beleriand]], however, and barricaded himself in his northern fortress of [[Angband]].

Fëanor and his sons swore an oath of vengeance against Melkor – and against anyone who withheld the Silmarils from them, even the Valar. Fëanor persuaded most of the Noldor to pursue Melkor, whom [[Fëanor]] renamed as [[Morgoth]], into Middle-earth. Fëanor's sons seized ships from the Teleri, attacking and killing many of them, and left the other Noldor to make the voyage by foot. Upon arriving in Middle-earth, the Noldor under Fëanor attacked Melkor and defeated his host, though Fëanor was slain by Balrogs. After a period of peace, Melkor attacked the Noldor but was again defeated and besieged. Nearly 400 years later, he broke the siege and drove the Noldor back.

After the destruction of the Trees and the theft of the Silmarils, the Valar created the moon and the sun. At the same time, Men awoke, some of whom later arrived in Beleriand and allied themselves with the Elves. [[Beren]], a man who had survived the latest battle, wandered to Doriath, where he fell in love with the elf [[Lúthien]], the king's daughter. The king sought to prevent their marriage by imposing what he believed an impossible task: retrieving one of the Silmarils from Melkor. But together, Beren and Lúthien embarked on this quest. [[Sauron]], a powerful servant of Melkor, imprisoned Beren along the way; but with Lúthien's help he escaped, crept into Melkor's fortress, and stole a Silmaril from Melkor's crown. Having achieved the task, the first union of man and elf was formed, though Beren was soon mortally wounded and Lúthien also died of grief. However she convinced the Vala [[Mandos]] to revive Beren and herself, choosing to sacrifice her immortality in favour of a mortal life with her beloved.

The Noldor, seeing that a mortal and an elf-woman could infiltrate Angband, perceived that Melkor was not invincible. They attacked again with a great army of Elves, [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] and Men. But they were deceived by Melkor, who had secretly darkened the hearts of many of the men. Thus it was that the Elvish host were utterly defeated, due in part to the treachery of some Men. However, many Men remained loyal to the Elves and were honoured thereafter.

None received more honour than the brothers [[Húrin]] and [[Huor]]. Huor died in battle, but Melkor captured Húrin, and cursed him to watch the downfall of his kin. Húrin's son, [[Túrin Turambar]], was sent to Doriath, leaving his mother and unborn sister behind in his father's kingdom (which had been overrun by the enemy). Túrin achieved many great deeds of valour, the greatest being the defeat of the [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]] [[Glaurung]]. Despite his heroism, however, Túrin was plagued by the curse of Melkor, which led him unwittingly to murder his friend [[Beleg]] and to marry and impregnate his sister [[Nienor Níniel|Nienor]], whom he had never met before, and who had lost her memory through Glaurung's enchantment. Before their child was born, the bewitchment was lifted as the dragon lay dying. Nienor, realizing what grew within her, took her own life. Upon learning the truth, Túrin threw himself on his sword.

Huor's son, [[Tuor]], became involved in the fate of the hidden Noldorin kingdom of Gondolin. He married the elf [[Idril]], daughter of [[Turgon]], Lord of [[Gondolin]] (the second union between Elves and Men). When Gondolin fell, betrayed from within by [[Maeglin]], Tuor saved many of its inhabitants from destruction. All of the Elvish kingdoms in Beleriand eventually fell, and the refugees fled to a haven by the sea created by Tuor. The son of Tuor and Idril, [[Eärendil]] the [[Half-elven]], was betrothed to [[Elwing]], herself descended from Beren and Lúthien. Elwing brought Eärendil the Silmaril of Beren and Lúthien, and using its light Eärendil travelled across the sea to Aman to seek help from the Valar. The Valar obliged; they attacked and defeated Melkor, completely destroying his fortress [[Angband]] and sinking most of [[Beleriand]]; and they expelled Melkor from Arda. This ended the First Age of Middle-earth. The last two Silmarils were taken by [[Fëanor]]'s surviving sons [[Maedhros]] and Maglor. However, Maedhros killed himself by leaping into a fiery chasm with a Silmaril while Maglor threw his into the sea and spent the rest of his days wandering along the shores of the world, singing his grief.

Eärendil and Elwing had two children: [[Elrond]] and [[Elros]]. As descendants of immortal elves and mortal men, they were given the choice of which lineage to belong to: Elrond chose to belong to the Elves, his brother to Men. Elros became the first king of Númenor and lived to 500 years old, being given an extended life in return for choosing to be a Man.

===''Akallabêth''===
{{Main article|Akallabêth}}

''Akallabêth'' ("The Downfallen"&lt;ref name="SilNameIndex" /&gt;) comprises about 30 pages, and recounts the rise and fall of the island kingdom of [[Númenor]], inhabited by the [[Dúnedain]]. After the defeat of Melkor, the Valar gave the island to the [[Edain|three loyal houses of Men]] who had aided the Elves in the war against him. Through the favour of the Valar, the Dúnedain were granted wisdom and power and life more enduring than any other of mortal race had possessed, making them comparable to the High-Elves of [[Aman (Middle-earth)|Aman]]. Indeed, the isle of Númenor lay closer to Aman than to Middle-earth. But their power lay in their bliss and their acceptance of mortality. The fall of Númenor came about in large measure through the influence of the corrupted Maia [[Sauron]] (the chief servant of Melkor), who arose during the Second Age and tried to conquer Middle-earth.

The Númenóreans moved against Sauron, who saw that he could not defeat them by force and allowed himself to be taken as a prisoner to Númenor. There he quickly enthralled the king, [[Ar-Pharazôn]], urging him to seek out the immortality that the Valar had apparently denied him, thus nurturing the seeds of envy that the Númenóreans had begun to hold against the Elves of the West and the Valar. So it was that all the knowledge and power of Númenor was turned towards seeking an avoidance of death; but this only weakened them and sped the gradual waning of the lifespans to something more similar to that of other Men. Sauron urged them to wage war against the Valar themselves to win immortality, and to worship his master Melkor, whom he said could grant them their wish. Ar-Pharazôn created the mightiest army and fleet Númenor had seen, and sailed against Aman. The Valar and Elves of Aman, stricken with grief over their betrayal, called on [[Ilúvatar]] for help. When Ar-Pharazôn landed, Ilúvatar destroyed his fleet and drowned Númenor itself as punishment for the rebellion against the rightful rule of the Valar. Ilúvatar created a great wave, such as had never before been seen, which utterly destroyed and submerged the isle of Númenor, killing all but those Dúnedain who had already sailed east, and changing the shape of all the lands of Middle-earth.

Sauron's physical manifestation was also destroyed in the ruin of Númenor, but as a Maia, his spirit returned to Middle-earth, no longer able to take upon himself the fair form he once had. Some Númenóreans who had remained loyal to the Valar were spared and were washed up on the shores of Middle-earth. Among these survivors were [[Elendil]] their leader, a descendant of Elros, and his two sons [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]] who had also saved a seedling from Númenor's white tree, the ancestor of that of Gondor. They founded the Númenórean Kingdoms in Exile:  [[Arnor]] in the north and [[Gondor]] in the south.  Elendil reigned as High-king of both kingdoms, but committed the rule of Gondor jointly to Isildur and Anárion.  The power of the kingdoms in exile was greatly diminished from that of Númenor, "yet very great it seemed to the wild men of Middle-earth".

At the end, it is mentioned that the sunken Númenor came to be called "Atalantë", a name not used when it existed. This led many readers to the conclusion that Númenor is [[Atlantis]]; this direct link was, however, denied by Tolkien himself, who asserted that it's a natural word following the constructs of [[Quenya]].

===''Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age''===
{{Main article|Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age}}

The concluding section of the book, comprising about 20 pages, describes the events that take place in Middle-earth during the Second and [[Third Age]]s. In the Second Age, Sauron emerged as the main power in Middle-earth, and the Rings of Power were forged by Elves led by [[Celebrimbor]]. Sauron secretly forged [[One Ring|his own ring]] to control the others, which led to war between the peoples of Middle-earth and Sauron, culminating in the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men|War of the Last Alliance]], in which Elves and the remaining Númenóreans united to defeat Sauron, bringing the Second Age to an end. The Third Age began with the passing of the [[One Ring]] to [[Isildur]], who was ambushed at the [[Gladden Fields]] shortly afterwards, and lost the ring in the [[Anduin|River Anduin]]. This section also gives a brief overview of the events leading up to and taking place in ''The Lord of the Rings'', including the waning of Gondor, the re-emergence of Sauron, the [[White Council]], [[Saruman]]'s treachery, and Sauron's final destruction along with the One Ring, after which the ages of magic end.

==Concept and creation==

===Development of the text===
Tolkien first began working on the stories that would become ''The Silmarillion'' in 1914,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#115}}&lt;/ref&gt; intending them to become an English mythology that would explain the origins of English history and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#131, 180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this early work was written while Tolkien, then a British officer returned from France during World War I, was in hospital and on sick leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#165, 180, 282}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed the first story, "[[The Fall of Gondolin]]", in late 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#163, 165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He called his collection of nascent stories ''The Book of Lost Tales''.&lt;ref name="BoLTF" /&gt; This became the name for the first two volumes of ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', which include these early texts. The stories employ the narrative device of a mariner named Eriol (in later versions, an Anglo-Saxon named [[Ælfwine of England|Ælfwine]]) who finds the island of [[Tol Eressëa]], where the Elves live; and the Elves tell him their history.&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|BolT|Chapter I, "The Cottage of Lost Play"}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Tolkien never completed ''The Book of Lost Tales''; he left it to compose the poems "[[The Lay of Leithian]]" and "[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]".&lt;ref name="BoLTF" /&gt;

The first complete version of ''The Silmarillion'' was the "Sketch of the Mythology" written in 1926&lt;ref name="LoB1"&gt;{{ME-ref|LoB|Chapter I, "The Lay of the Children of Húrin"}}&lt;/ref&gt; (later published in Volume IV of ''The History of Middle-earth''). The "Sketch" was a 28-page synopsis written to explain the background of the story of [[Túrin]] to R. W. Reynolds, a friend to whom Tolkien had sent several of the stories.&lt;ref name="LoB1" /&gt; From the "Sketch" Tolkien developed a fuller narrative version of ''The Silmarillion'' called ''Quenta Noldorinwa''&lt;ref name="SoMEP"&gt;{{ME-ref|SoME|Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also included in Volume IV). The ''Quenta Noldorinwa'' was the last version of ''The Silmarillion'' that Tolkien completed.&lt;ref name="SoMEP" /&gt;

In 1937, encouraged by the success of ''The Hobbit'', Tolkien submitted to his publisher [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] an incomplete but more fully developed version of ''The Silmarillion'' called ''Quenta Silmarillion'',&lt;ref name="BoLTF" /&gt; but they rejected the work as being obscure and "too [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]]".&lt;ref name="Letter19"&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publisher instead asked Tolkien to write a sequel to ''The Hobbit''.&lt;ref name="Letter19" /&gt; Tolkien began to revise ''The Silmarillion'', but soon turned to the sequel, which became ''The Lord of the Rings''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|LRoW|Part II, Chapter VI, "Quenta Silmarillion"}}&lt;/ref&gt; He renewed work on ''The Silmarillion'' after completing ''The Lord of the Rings'',&lt;ref name="MRF"&gt;{{ME-ref|MR|Foreword}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he greatly desired to publish the two works together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#124}}&lt;/ref&gt; But when it became clear that would not be possible, Tolkien turned his full attention to preparing ''The Lord of the Rings'' for publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1950s Tolkien returned to ''The Silmarillion'', but much of his writing from this time was concerned more with the theological and philosophical underpinnings of the work than with the narratives themselves. By this time, he had doubts about fundamental aspects of the work that went back to the earliest versions of the stories, and it seems that he felt the need to resolve these problems before he could produce the "final" version of ''The Silmarillion''.&lt;ref name="MRF" /&gt; During this time he wrote extensively on such topics as the nature of evil in Arda, the origin of [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]], the customs of the Elves, the nature and means of Elvish rebirth, and the "flat" world and the story of the Sun and Moon.&lt;ref name="MRF" /&gt; In any event, with one or two exceptions, he wrought little change to the narratives during the remaining years of his life.&lt;ref name="MRF" /&gt;

===Posthumous publication===

For several years after his father's death, Christopher Tolkien compiled a ''Silmarillion'' narrative. Christopher's intentions seem to have been mostly to use the latest writings of his father's that he could,{{citation needed&lt;!--ME-fact--&gt;|date=November 2007}} and to keep as much internal consistency (and consistency with ''The Lord of the Rings'') as possible,&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|UT|Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he admitted that a complete consistency was impossible.&lt;ref name="Silf" /&gt; As explained in ''The History of Middle-earth'', Christopher drew upon numerous sources for his narrative, relying on post-Lord of the Rings works where possible, but ultimately reaching back as far as the 1917 ''Book of Lost Tales'' to fill in portions of the narrative which his father had planned to write but never addressed. In one later chapter of ''Quenta Silmarillion'', "Of the Ruin of Doriath", which had not been touched since the early 1930s, he had to construct a narrative practically from scratch.&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|WotJ|Part Three, Chapter V "The Tale of Years"}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final result, which included genealogies, maps, an index, and the first-ever released Elvish word list, was published in 1977.
Because of Christopher's extensive explanations (in ''The History of Middle-earth'') of how he compiled the published work, much of ''The Silmarillion'' has been debated by readers. Christopher's task is generally accepted as very difficult given the state of his father's texts at the time of his death: some critical texts were no longer in the Tolkien family's possession, and Christopher's task compelled him to rush through much of the material. Christopher reveals in later volumes of ''The History of Middle-earth'' many divergent ideas which do not agree with the published version. Christopher Tolkien has suggested that, had he taken more time and had access to all the texts, he might have produced a substantially different work. But he was compelled by considerable pressure and demand from his father's readers and publishers to produce something publishable as quickly as possible{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}.

In October 1996, Christopher Tolkien commissioned illustrator [[Ted Nasmith]] to create full-page full-colour artwork for the first illustrated edition of ''The Silmarillion''. It was published in 1998, and followed in 2004 by a second edition featuring corrections and additional artwork by Nasmith.

During the 1980s and 1990s, Christopher Tolkien published most of his father's Middle-earth writings as the 12-volume ''The History of Middle-earth'' series. In addition to the source material and earlier drafts of several portions of ''The Lord of the Rings'', these books greatly expand on the original material published in ''The Silmarillion'', and in many cases diverge from it. There is much that Tolkien intended to revise but only sketched out in notes, and some new texts surfaced after the publication of ''The Silmarillion''. These books also make it clear just how [[Unfinished work|unfinished]] the later parts of ''The Silmarillion'' really were: some parts were never rewritten after the early versions in ''Lost Tales''.

===Influences===
{{Main article|J. R. R. Tolkien's influences}}
''The Silmarillion'' is a complex work exhibiting the influence of many sources. A major influence was the [[Finnish mythology|Finnish]] epic ''[[Kalevala]]'', especially the tale of [[Kullervo]]. Influence from [[Greek mythology]] is also apparent. The island of [[Númenor]], for example, recalls [[Atlantis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#154, 227}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, Tolkien later described in a letter to Christopher Bretherton as merely a "curious chance".

Greek mythology also colours the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]], who borrow many attributes from the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian gods]].&lt;ref name="Olympian"&gt;{{Citation

Influence of the Bible and traditional Christian narrative are seen in ''The Silmarillion'' in the conflict between Melkor and Eru Ilúvatar, a parallel of the polarity of Lucifer and God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Chance|2001|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, ''The Silmarillion'' tells of the creation and fall of the Elves, as ''Genesis'' tells of the creation and fall of Man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Medieval Christian cosmology shows its influence especially in the account of the creation of the universe as the manifestation of a sort of song sung by God with which the angels harmonize until the fallen angel introduces discord. St. Augustine's writings on music, as well as the extensive medieval tradition of the divine harmony—more familiar to us today in the notion of the "[[music of the spheres]]"—served as bases for this telling of creation.

[[Celtic mythology]] show its influence in the exile of the [[Noldor]]in Elves, for example, that borrow elements from the story of [[Irish legend]]s of the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]].&lt;ref name="Celtic"&gt;Fimi, Dimitra (August 2006). {{"'}}Mad' Elves and 'Elusive Beauty': Some Celtic Strands of Tolkien's Mythology". ''Folklore'', '''117'''(2), 156–170 . {{JSTOR|30035484}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Welsh influence is seen in the Elvish language [[Sindarin]], that Tolkien gave "a linguistic character very like (though not identical with) [[Welsh language|British-Welsh]] ... because it seems to fit the rather 'Celtic' type of legends and stories told of its speakers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical response==
At the time of release, reviews of ''The Silmarillion'' were generally mixed to negative. ''The Silmarillion'' was criticized for being too serious, lacking the light-hearted moments that were found in ''The Lord of the Rings'' and especially ''The Hobbit''.&lt;ref name="TIME"&gt;{{Citation

Robert M. Adams of ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' called ''The Silmarillion'' "an empty and pompous bore", "not a literary event of any magnitude", and even claimed that the main reason for its "enormous sales" was the "Tolkien cult" created by the popularity of ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'', predicting that more people would buy ''The Silmarillion'' than would ever read it.&lt;ref name="NYRB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert M. "The Hobbit Habit". ''New York Review of Books'', 24 November 1977. Quoted in Johnson ''J.R.R. Tolkien: six decades of criticism'' (1986), p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[School Library Journal]]'' called it "only a stillborn postscript" to Tolkien's earlier works.&lt;ref name="SLJ" /&gt; [[Peter Conrad (academic)|Peter Conrad]] of the ''[[New Statesman]]'' even went so far as to say that "Tolkien can't actually write".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Nonetheless, a few reviewers praised the scope of Tolkien's creation. ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' acknowledged that "what is finally most moving is … the eccentric heroism of Tolkien's attempt".&lt;ref name="NYTBR" /&gt; ''TIME'' described ''The Silmarillion'' as "majestic, a work held so long and so powerfully in the writer's imagination that it overwhelms the reader".&lt;ref name="TIME" /&gt; The ''[[Horn Book Magazine]]'' even lauded the "remarkable set of legends conceived with imaginative might and told in beautiful language".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Influence in music==
*The Dutch [[progressive rock]] guitarist [[Jan Akkerman]] recorded a track called "The Silmarillion" on his 1977 album ''Meditation''.
*The British [[neo-progressive rock]] band [[Marillion]] were formed in Aylesbury, England, in 1979 as Silmarillion but shortened their name in 1981 to avoid any trademark conflict.
*The Austrian [[black metal]] band [[Summoning (band)|Summoning]] formed in 1993 and have also released numerous concept albums based on this and other works by Tolkien.
*The German [[power metal]] band [[Blind Guardian]] released ''[[Nightfall in Middle-Earth]]'' in 1998, a [[concept album]] based upon ''The Silmarillion''. The album contains not only songs but also spoken passages narrating parts of the story.
*The German [[Drum &amp; Bass]] [[DJ]] [[Mathis Mootz]] released ''War of Sound'' in 2003, a [[glitch music|clicks n' cuts]] side project as m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which contains spoken word samples from an adaptation of ''The Silmarillion''.
*The Irish [[Celtic metal]] band [[Cruachan (band)|Cruachan]] released a song called the "Fall of Gondolin" on their 2004 album ''[[Pagan (album)|Pagan]]''.
*The Australian [[independent music|indie]] band [[The Middle East (band)|The Middle East]] incorporate many elements from ''The Silmarillion'' in their song "Beleriand" from their 2009 album ''[[The Recordings of the Middle East]]''.
*The Swedish a cappella group [[Riltons Vänner]] incorporates loose influences of ''The Silmarillion'' in the lyrics of their song "Folket från Eä" (English: "The people from Eä"), written by Peter Sydén, from their 2005 album ''Här är passion''.
*The Norwegian classical composer [[Martin Romberg]] has written three full-scale symphonic poems, Quendi (2008), Telperion et Laurelin (2014), and Fëanor (2017), inspired by passages from ''The Silmarillion''. The works were premiered by orchestras in [[Southern France]] between 2009 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/provence-alpes-cote-d-azur/alpes-maritimes/nice/orchestre-philharmonique-nice-fete-ses-70-ans-1337143.html|title= Concert Review Orchestre Philharmonique de Nice 2017, Fëanor|publisher=France 3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orchestre-avignon.com/artistes/martin-romberg/|title= Martin Romberg at Orchestre régional Avignon-Provence|publisher=Orchestre régional Avignon-Provence.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Young Friends Society of African Diasporan Institutions''' (YFS) exists to support, serve and promote [[African diaspora|African Diasporan]] cultural, historical, economic, educational, and community-based institutions through fundraising, event planning, educational and social programming. YFS also serves as a vehicle to promote networking opportunities and leadership development among its members to further strengthen the communities where these institutions are located. YFS is composed of individuals in their twenties, thirties and forties.&lt;ref name="The Young Friends Society of African Diasporan Institutions"&gt;[http://www.youngfriendssociety.org Official website of The Young Friends Society of African Diasporan Institutions]&lt;/ref&gt;

==African diasporan institutions==
African Diasporan Institutions are cultural, historic, educational, and economic institutions and organizations that are located in cities around the world that have large populations of people African descent. These institutions include but are not limited to museums, historical societies, theatre companies, dance companies, libraries and archives and performing arts groups.

==YFS history==
YFS began as an auxiliary group at the [[African American Museum in Philadelphia|African American Museum of Philadelphia]] (AAMP). While working as the educational coordinator at AAMP, [[Shantrelle P. Lewis]] witnessed a lack of young adult visitors. Following in the tradition of other arts and cultural organizations, Lewis developed a plan to attract a younger demographic that could inject a new energy into the museum.  YFS held its inaugural event, Soul Simpatico, in October 2005, and within a year it had brought in 100 new members to AAMP.

As the organization grew, it became apparent that similar institutions in Philadelphia needed innovative ways to engage young adults looking for alternatives to the conventional nightlife scene of clubs and bars. In January 2007, YFS incorporated as a Pennsylvania non-profit organization and secured 501(c)3 status by June of the same year. Over the next two years, YFS partnered with various cultural organizations in Philadelphia, grew its membership base and held several successful events. YFS also started chapters in New Orleans and New York City, with plans to expand domestically and internationally.

==Vision of YFS==

1) Institution Building: YFS will help to ensure the survival and growth of important institutions. Through the development of a young core of members, supporters and sponsors, YFS will assist in sustaining African Diasporan Institutions for future generations. Each YFS chapter will invite up to 7 institutions in its geographic area to become a partner institution. These institutions will receive direct support and benefits as a partner institution of the Young Friends Society.

2) Cross-cultural association: Over the next decade, YFS will establish chapters in major cities around the [[African Diaspora]]. This will serve as a link between the various people and cultures that exist within the African World. It serves to educate people about the similarities and variations of people of African descent. Chapters will be established in the [[United States|U.S.]], [[Caribbean]], [[South America]], [[Europe]] and the Continent of [[Africa]].

3) Individual Support: YFS serves as a major catalyst for leadership development and interaction amongst like-minded individuals who are passionate about achieving their own unique potential and developing a global society. Unlike other networking forums that tend to serve individuals from a narrow demographic, YFS will bridge positive young people from diverse socio-economic, political, cultural, intellectual and religious backgrounds to support culture. In the process, it will also provide support for its members and their respective endeavors.

The '''Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin''' is a venerable theatre and opera house at 18, Boulevard Saint-Martin in the [[10th arrondissement of Paris]].  

== History == 
[[File:Porte Saint-Martin XVIII.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin c.1790]]It was first built very rapidly in 1781 under the direction of {{Interlanguage link multi|Nicolas Lenoir|fr}} (1726–1810) to house the [[Paris Opéra]], whose previous home, the second [[Salle du Palais-Royal]], had burned down on 8 June 1781. The new theatre had a capacity of about 2,000 spectators and included a parterre with the lowest-priced tickets sold only to males who stood throughout the performances, an amphitheatre, and four rows of boxes. The Opéra used the theatre from 27 October 1781 until August 1794.&lt;ref&gt;"Paris" '''3''': 862, 867. Sadie, Stanley, ed. (1992). ''The new Grove dictionary of opera'' (4 volumes).

The theatre was destroyed by fire during the [[Paris Commune]] of 1871 and replaced in 1873 with a building designed by the architect Oscar de la Chardonnière (d. 1881), who enlisted the aid of the sculptor Jacques-Hyacinthe Chevalier (1825–1895) in the design of the new facade. The new interior was designed by H. Chevalier.&lt;ref name=MairieDeParis/&gt;  With relatively brief interruptions, the theatre has been in continuous operation since.

== Early female writers ==

''Cai'', loosely translated as "literary talent", is an attribute describing profound lyricism, deep intellectuality and analytic skill.&lt;ref name=lar&gt;Larson, W. (1998). Women and Writing in Modern China. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was acknowledged that both women and men possessed ''cai'', the phrase ''nuren wucai bian shi de'' 女人無才便是德 (for women, lack of literary talent is a virtue)&lt;ref name=lar/&gt; summarizes the dominant sentiment that the literary field was traditionally a domain for men.  Despite this belief, works authored by women play an integral part throughout Chinese history. There were a number of women writers prior to the 20th century who were respected by the intelligentsia of their era, even if much of their work was considered less important than men's work in general.&lt;ref name = chang&gt;Chang. K.S. &amp; Saussy. H. (Eds.). (1999). Women writers of traditional China: An anthology of poetry and criticism. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press.  pp. 1–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Female writers helped to bring forth themes such as romance, marriage, gender roles and the politics surrounding women.

The [[Women in ancient and imperial China#Zhou dynasty|first women recorded]] in biography and bibliography were poets.&lt;ref name = chang/&gt; The aesthetic nature of poetry was highly regarded, while fiction was viewed as an avenue taken because of a failed career or commercial venture.&lt;ref name = chang/&gt; A marked increase in female literacy took place during the Late Imperial Era. One of the more notable poets of this time was [[Mao Xiuhui]], a 16th-century poet that used the plight of her husband's failed attempt at gaining a position as civil servant to write a poem that draws parallels between the male and female as they suffer hardships in the political and domestic arenas respectively. Other notable female poets in Chinese history were [[Gao Zhixian]], [[Xue Tao]], and [[Li Qingzhao]].

== 20th-century writers and feminism ==
The beginning of the century marked a period of growing unrest for women as the feminist movement took hold.  Women of this period were faced with the dilemma of protesting oppressive ideals stemming from Confucian ideology or remaining true to their family and maintaining peace and order. Literary discourse at the time was highly influenced by this social movement. Women writers of the time authored works reflecting the feminist sentiment and the issues that came with revolution.&lt;ref name=sch&gt;Schaeffer, Kay &amp; Xianlin, Song. (2007). Unruly Spaces: Gender, Women'’ Writing and Indigenous Feminism in China. Journal of Gender Studies, 16 (1), 17–30&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eileen Chang]], [[Lu Yin (writer)|Lu Yin]], [[Shi Pingmei]] and [[Ding Ling]], were four of the most influential feminist writers of the time.  In the 1920s and 1930s, [[Freudian]] [[psychoanalysis]] gained favor with Chinese feminists looking to study gender relationships, thus becoming a topic of many feminist writers throughout the early and mid portions of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=sch/&gt;

When Mao came to power in 1949, he addressed the issue of women's rights and tried to establish women's equality through the "iron girls" of national development ideal.&lt;ref name=sch/&gt; Through this philosophy, long-standing practices such as [[foot binding]], [[prostitution]] and trafficking of women were abolished. Women were given the opportunity to own land, divorce, and join the military and other employment fields.&lt;ref name = Laurence&gt;Laurence, S. (2008.) Mao’s ghost. The Boston Phoenix. Retrieved from the web December 8, 2009. http://thephoenix.com/boston/news/66069-maos-ghost/.&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of this ideology, however, did not liberate women; instead, it undermined the feminine voice by forcing women to take a male-oriented stance on public and domestic policy.&lt;ref name=sch/&gt;   Literature authored during this time reflects the restrictive and masculine perspective of women writers during this period.&lt;ref name=sch/&gt; This "[[Mulan]]ian" style of writing submerged true feminine identity, rendering the female perspective neglected and hidden in the male dominated political and aesthetic arenas.&lt;ref name=Jin&gt;Jinhua, Z. (2009). Women's Culture and Writing in the 1990s: Illusions and Breakout. (Y. Qinfa &amp; J. Shan, Trans.). About.com http://chineseculture.about.com/library/weekly/aa101000a.htm. Retrieved November 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  There were some exceptions to this rule, such as [[Yuan Chiung-chiung]], who wrote about women’s issues and how much women could accomplish without men.

== Variations Within The Series ==

There are many variations within the WBR series.  The most common variations include cloth boards versus smooth boards, patterned end papers with ribbon bookmarks versus plain colored end papers without ribbon bookmarks, different colored covers but retaining the same embossed cover image, and books that have completely different cover art than other editions.

One example of cloth boards versus plain boards is ''Far From The Madding Crowd''.  Both the cloth and the plain editions are the same color with the same artwork, only the material of the boards is different.  Other examples include ''Moby Dick, Treasure Island, O Pioneers, The Sea Wolf,'' and ''Uncle Tom’s Cabin''.

An example of the variation of patterned end papers with ribbon bookmarks versus plain colored end papers without bookmarks is ''Silas Marner''.  Both books have the same artwork on the outside cover, but on the inside one edition has plain white end papers and the other has marble patterned end papers and a colored ribbon bookmark.  Other titles with this variation are ''Pride And Prejudice, The Call of the Wild/White Fang, The Scarlet Letter, The House of Seven Gables, The Last Of The Mohicans, A Tale Of Two Cities, Tess of the D’Urbervilles, A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur’s Court, Little Women, Jane Eyre, Great Expectations, Twice-Told Tales,'' and ''The Innocents Abroad.''

An example of a title having different colored covers but retaining the same embossed artwork image is ''A Tale Of Two Cities''.  Cover variations of ''A Tale of Two Cities'' include a blue cloth cover, a brown cloth cover, and a red cover.  Other editions with this variation include ''The Innocents Abroad, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, A Tale of Two Cities, Tales of Suspense, Silas Marner, Wuthering Heights'' (old cover style), ''Ben Hur, The Adventures Of Tom Sawyer'', and ''The Return of Sherlock Holmes''.

''Tess of the D’Urbervilles'' is an example where in two editions the boards are the same color (gray) but the embossed parts of the cover and the faux quarter leather covering are different colors.  The artwork and faux leather is red in one edition and blue in the other edition.

Some books have been printed with completely different cover artwork from other editions.  Examples include ''Barchester Towers, The Jungle Books, Captains Courageous, Beau Geste'', and ''Wuthering Heights''.  For some books, such as ''The Jungle Books'' and ''Barchester Towers'', the UK edition was published with illustrations where the American version was not.

A spelling variation in a book title occurs with ''A Journey to the Center of the Earth''.  In the UK, the edition was published under the title ''A Journey to the Centre of the Earth''.

In the United States, the James Hilton titles (''Lost Horizon, Good-bye Mr. Chips and Other Stories'') were printed in two separate volumes whereas in the UK edition, they were combined into one book.

Each edition in the WBR series includes a sheet folded in half numbered with page numbers one through four with a synopsis of the history of how the book came to be published and a short biography of the author and perhaps some information about the artist in illustrated editions.  ''On Our Selection/Our New Selection'' is different from the rest of the books because not only is the author biography insert included, but also a folder containing six 5.5" x 8.5" prints of artwork by artist Lionel Lindsay.  The prints included are titled ''Judy Wasn’t Frightened Of Jew-Lizards'', ''Sarah Thought It A Fine Effect'', ''‘It’s A Lie!’ Dad roared'', ''Daniel Damascus Rudd, Sir!'', and ''Dad Come to See the Great Metropolis.''  These are illustrations found in the actual book.  One print is not from the book.  It is not given a title and depicts the father scratching his bare head riding a horse in the woods at a walk towards the lower right hand foreground.

Reader’s Digest also issued a book safe as part of the WBR series, ''Paradise Lost'' by John Milton.  The outside of the book safe is designed to look like other editions in the series, but inside the safe are two separated compartments.  The interior of the safe is lined with light gray velvet and is kept closed with velcro strips on the back of the cover and on the middle divider between the two compartments.

Vivat Direct Limited, t/a Reader's Digest, a publishing company in the UK that usually prints Reader's Digest Select Editions,&lt;ref name="Reader's Digest UK"&gt;{{cite web|title=Reader's Digest UK|url=http://www.readersdigest.co.uk/|publisher=Vivat Direct Limited, ta Reader's Digest}}&lt;/ref&gt; has published World's Best Reading books starting in 2010: ''Kidnapped/Treasure Island'' ({{ISBN|0276446585}}), ''Wuthering Heights'' ({{ISBN|0276446518}}), ''Oliver Twist'', ''Pride &amp; Prejudice'', ''A Study In Scarlet/The Hound Of The Baskervilles''({{ISBN|9780895772541}}), ''Moonstone'', ''Robinson Crusoe'', ''The War of the Worlds/The Time Machine'', ''Jo's Boys'', ''Three Men in a Boat/Three Men on the Bummel'', and ''Ivanhoe'' ({{ISBN|9781780201184}}).  These editions were published with insert pages like the other World's Best Reading books with the World's Best Reading logo at the top of the first page just like the other inserts.  However, the inserts have the initials WBR above the spelled out World's Best Reading on the insert pages and the WBR initials on the spine of the books.  These books are different from the original World's Best Reading books because they are bound in cloth and do not have the faux quarter leather binding over the spine.  They also have illustrations on the front and back covers, unlike the rest of the series which have illustrations on the front cover board only.
