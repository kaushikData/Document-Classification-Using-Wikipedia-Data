On the night of 1 July 2002, '''Bashkirian Airlines Flight 2937''', a [[Tupolev Tu-154]] [[passenger jet]], and '''DHL Flight 611''', a [[Boeing 757]] [[cargo jet]], collided in mid-air over [[Überlingen]], a southern German town on [[Lake Constance]]. All 69 passengers and crew aboard the Tupolev and the two crew members of the Boeing were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aktuell.ru/russland/hintergrund_information/passagierliste_flug_2937_der_verunglueckten_tu_154_der_bashkirian_airlines_5.html |title=Passenger List |access-date=21 November 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081029064630/http://www.aktuell.ru/russland/hintergrund_information/passagierliste_flug_2937_der_verunglueckten_tu_154_der_bashkirian_airlines_5.html| archivedate= 29 October 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official investigation by the [[German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident Investigation]] ({{lang-de|Bundesstelle für Flugunfalluntersuchung}}, (BFU))  identified as the main cause of the collision a number of shortcomings on the part of the Swiss [[air traffic control]] service in charge of the sector involved, and also ambiguities in the procedures regarding the use of [[TCAS]], the on-board aircraft collision avoidance system.&lt;ref group=BFU&gt;Section 3.2 "Causes", page 110&lt;/ref&gt;

A year and a half after the crash, on 24 February 2004, Peter Nielsen, the air traffic controller on duty at the time of the collision, was murdered in an apparent act of revenge by [[Vitaly Kaloyev]], a Russian citizen who had lost his wife and two children in the accident.&lt;ref name="Indep"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bott|first1=Martin|last2=Paterson|first2=Tony|title=Father of air-crash victims guilty of revenge killing|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/father-of-air-crash-victims-guilty-of-revenge-killing-322535.html|access-date=4 November 2017|work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=Independent Digital News &amp; Media|date=26 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Father killed air traffic chief over fatal crash |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article582890.ece |work=The Sunday Times |location=London |access-date=28 December 2010 |first=Roger |last=Boyes |date=26 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thescot-3"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=455&amp;id=2146352005 |title=Father 'saw black' as he killed air traffic controller |access-date=18 January 2007 |last=Wolfsteller |first=Pilar |work=The Scotsman|location=Edinburgh |date=26 October 2005}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NothingToLose"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Luke |last1=Harding |first2=Nick |last2=Paton Walsh |date=28 February 2004 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/russia/article/0,2763,1158361,00.html |title=Nothing left to lose: grief-crazed murder suspect haunted by family's air deaths |work=The Guardian |location=London | access-date=8 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aircraft, a Tupolev Tu-154M [[Aircraft registration|registered]] as {{Airreg|RA|85816|,}} was piloted by an experienced Russian crew: 52-year-old [[Pilot in command|Captain]] Alexander Mihailovich Gross (Александр Михайлович Гросс) and 40-year-old [[First Officer (civil aviation)|First Officer]] Oleg Pavlovich Grigoriev (Олег Павлович Григорьев). The captain had more than 12,000 flight hours to his credit. Grigoriev, the chief pilot of Bashkirian Airlines, had 8,500 hours of flying experience and his task was to evaluate Captain Gross's performance throughout the flight. 41-year-old Murat Ahatovich Itkulov (Мурат Ахатович Иткулов), a seasoned pilot with close to 7,900 flight hours who was normally the first officer, did not officially serve on duty due to this being the captain's assessment flight. 50-year-old Sergei Gennadyevich Kharlov (Сергей Геннадьевич Харлов), a flight navigator with approximately 13,000 flight hours, and 37-year-old Flight Engineer Oleg Irikovich Valeev (Олег Ирикович Валеев), who had almost 4,200 flight hours, joined the three pilots in the cockpit.&lt;ref name="Deadly Crossroads" /&gt;

The two aircraft were flying at [[flight level]] 360 (36,000 feet, 10,973 m) on a collision course.  Despite being just inside the German border, the airspace was controlled from [[Zürich]], Switzerland, by the private Swiss airspace control company [[Skyguide]].
The only [[air traffic controller]] handling the airspace, Peter Nielsen, was working two workstations at the same time. Partly due to the added workload, and partly due to delayed radar data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Plane Crash Remembered; One Mourner Not Welcome |publisher= The New York Times | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/world/europe/killer-of-air-traffic-controller-barred-from-crash-memorial.html | access-date = 30 April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he did not realise the problem in time and thus failed to keep the aircraft at a safe distance from each other. Less than a minute before the accident he realised the danger and contacted Flight 2937, instructing the pilot to descend by a thousand feet to avoid collision with crossing traffic (Flight 611). Seconds after the Russian crew initiated the descent, their [[traffic collision avoidance system]] (TCAS) instructed them to climb, while at about the same time the TCAS on Flight 611 instructed the pilots of that aircraft to descend.&lt;ref group="BFU"&gt;Section 4 "Safety Recommendations", pages 111–113&lt;/ref&gt; Had both aircraft followed those automated instructions, the collision would not have occurred.&lt;ref group="BFU"&gt;Section 1.16.2 "ACAS/TCAS II analysis", page 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Flight 611's pilots on the Boeing jet followed the TCAS instructions and initiated a descent, but could not immediately inform Nielsen because the controller was dealing with Flight 2937. About eight seconds before the collision, Flight 611's descent rate was about {{convert|2400|ft/min|m/s}}, not quite as rapid as the {{convert|2500|to|3000|ft/min|m/s|abbr=on}} range advised by that jet's TCAS; as for the Tupolev, the pilot disregarded his jet's TCAS instruction to climb, having already commenced his descent as instructed by the controller.&lt;ref group=BFU&gt;Section 2.7 "Analysis summary", pages 104–106&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, both planes were now descending.

Unaware of the TCAS-issued alerts, Nielsen repeated his instruction to Flight 2937 to descend, giving the Tupolev crew incorrect information as to the position of the DHL plane (telling them that the Boeing was to the right of the Tupolev when it was in fact to the left).&lt;ref group=BFU&gt;Section 2.4.1 "ATC Zurich", page 76&lt;/ref&gt;

The aircraft collided at 23:35:32 [[Central European Summer Time|local time]], at almost a right angle at an altitude of {{convert|34890|ft|m}}, with the Boeing's vertical stabiliser slicing completely through Flight 2937's fuselage just ahead of the Tupolev's wings. The Tupolev broke into several pieces, scattering wreckage over a wide area. The nose section of the aircraft fell vertically, while the tail section with the engines continued, stalled, and fell. The crippled Boeing, now with 80% of its vertical stabiliser lost, struggled for a further seven kilometres (four miles) before crashing into a wooded area close to the village of [[Owingen|Taisersdorf]] at a 70-degree downward angle. Each engine ended up several hundred metres away from the main wreckage, and the tail section was torn from the fuselage by trees just before impact.&lt;ref group=BFU&gt;Section 1.12 "Wreckages and impacts information", pages 19–33&lt;/ref&gt; All 69 people on the Tupolev, and the two on board the Boeing, died.&lt;ref group=BFU&gt;Section 1.2 "Injuries to persons", page 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other factors in the crash==
Only one air traffic controller, Peter Nielsen of ACC Zurich, was controlling the airspace through which the aircraft were flying. The other controller on duty was resting in another room for the night. This was against SkyGuide's regulations but had been a common practice for years and was known and tolerated by management. Maintenance work was being carried out on the main radar image processing system, which meant that the controllers were forced to use a fallback system.&lt;ref group=BFU&gt;Section 1.17.1 "ATC Zurich", pages 35–42&lt;/ref&gt; The ground-based optical collision warning system, which would have alerted the controller to the pending collision approximately 2½ minutes before it happened,&lt;ref group=BFU&gt;Section 2.6.1.4 "Warning systems", page 88&lt;/ref&gt; had been switched off for maintenance;&lt;!--Not quite true - it was still operating, but its output was not being fed to the controller's workstation--&gt; Nielsen was unaware of this.&lt;ref group=BFU&gt;page 89&lt;/ref&gt; There still was an aural [[Short Term Conflict Alert|STCA]] warning system, which released a warning addressed to workstation RE SUED at 23:35:00 (32 seconds before the collision); this warning was not heard by anyone present at that time, although no error in this system could be found in a subsequent technical audit — however, whether or not this audible warning is functional is not something which is technically logged. Even if Nielsen had heard this warning, at that time finding a useful resolution order by the [[air traffic controller]] is impossible.&lt;ref group=BFU&gt;page 89&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deviating statements in the official report===
[[File:Memorial for victims at Ub.jpg|thumb|upright|Temporary memorial at Uberlingen's Sosa Fountain.]]
All countries involved could add additional "deviating" statements to the official report. The [[Bahrain|Kingdom of Bahrain]], Switzerland, and the [[Russian Federation]] did submit positions that were published with the official report. The U.S. did not submit deviating positions. The deviating statements were published verbatim as an appendix to the report by the [[Bundesstelle für Flugunfalluntersuchung|German federal investigators]].&lt;ref name="report-annex"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfu-web.de/EN/Publications/Investigation%20Report/2002/Report_02_AX001-1-2_Ueberlingen_Appendix_2-10.pdf?__blob=publicationFile,templateId=raw,property=publicationFile.pdf/Report_02_AX001-1-2_%C3%9Cberlingen_Appendix_2-10.pdf |title=Appendices/Deviating positions for Investigation Report AX001-1-2/02 MAY 2004 |access-date=5 May 2008|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statement by the Kingdom of Bahrain, the home country of the DHL plane, mostly agrees with the findings of the report. It says that the report should have put less emphasis on the actions of individuals and more on the faults within Skyguide's organisation and management. Bahrain's statement also mentions the lack of [[crew resource management]] in the Tupolev's cockpit as a factor in the crash.&lt;ref name="report-annex"/&gt;

The Russian Federation states that the Russian pilots were unable to obey the TCAS advisory to climb; the advisory was given when they were already at {{convert|35500|ft}} while the controller wrongly stated there was conflicting traffic above them at {{convert|36000|ft}}.  Also, the controller gave the wrong position of the DHL plane (2 o'clock instead of the actual 10 o'clock). Russia asserts that the DHL crew had a "real possibility" to avoid a collision since they were able to hear the conversation between the Russian crew and the controller.&lt;ref name="report-annex"/&gt;

Switzerland notes that the Tupolev was about {{convert|33|m}} below the flight level ordered by the Swiss controller, and still descending at {{convert|1900|ft/min}}. The Swiss say that this was also a cause of the accident. Switzerland also requested that the BFU make a formal finding that the TCAS advisories would have been useful if obeyed immediately; the BFU declined to do so.&lt;ref name="report-annex"/&gt;

== Aftermath ==
[[File:Skyguide Memorial.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Skyguide memorial to the aviation accident and murder of Peter Nielsen.]]
Nielsen needed medical attention due to [[traumatic stress]] caused by the accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/europe/2087253.stm|title=Air crash safety device switched off|publisher=BBC NEWS|access-date=14 July 2009|date=3 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Skyguide, his former colleagues maintained a vase with a white rose over Nielsen's former workstation.&lt;ref name=skyguide&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skyguide.ch/en/Dossiers/DossierUeberlingen/ |title=Information regarding the air accident at Überlingen on 1 July 2002 |publisher=[[Skyguide]] |access-date=14 July 2009 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091110144925/http://www.skyguide.ch/en/Dossiers/DossierUeberlingen |archive-date=10 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Skyguide, after initially having blamed the Russian pilot for the accident, accepted full responsibility and asked relatives of the victims for forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Plane crash killing trial starts|publisher=BBC News| date = 25 October 2005| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4375338.stm | access-date=8 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to news reports, Skyguide did pay out compensations to the families of the dead children. Under international aviation laws,{{failed verification|date=February 2018}} the compensation amount was about SFr30,000 ($34,087) to SFr36,000. The Swiss Federal Court turned down appeals from some relatives for higher compensation in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/court-upholds-skyguide-compensation/30259716|title=Court upholds Skyguide compensation|work=SWI swissinfo.ch|access-date=19 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 July 2006, a court in [[Konstanz]] decided that the Federal Republic of Germany should pay compensation to Bashkirian Airlines. The court found that Germany was legally responsible for the actions of Skyguide. The government appealed the ruling,&lt;ref name="stuttgarter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/stz/page/detail.php/1688427 |title=Katastrophe von Überlingen – Flugunglück beschäftigt Landgericht |publisher=''[[Stuttgarter Zeitung]]'' |date=20 April 2008 |access-date=7 June 2009 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421192754/http://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/stz/page/detail.php/1688427 |archive-date=21 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but in late 2013 Bashkirian Airlines and the Federal Republic of Germany reached a tacit agreement, ending the court case before a decision on the legal issues was reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=12 Jahre nach dem Flugzeugunglück bei Überlingen: Wer verantwortet den Himmel über Südbaden? |author=Nils Köhler |url=http://www.suedkurier.de/nachrichten/baden-wuerttemberg/12-Jahre-nach-dem-Flugzeugunglueck-bei-Ueberlingen-Wer-verantwortet-den-Himmel-ueber-Suedbaden;art417930,7194240 |newspaper=[[Südkurier]] |date=23 August 2014 |access-date=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another case before the court in Konstanz, Skyguide's liability insurance is suing Bashkirian Airlines for 2.5 million euro in damages. The case was opened in March 2008; the legal questions are expected to be difficult, as the airline has filed for bankruptcy under Russian law.&lt;ref name="stuttgarter" /&gt;

A criminal investigation of Skyguide began in May 2004. On 7 August 2006, a Swiss prosecutor filed manslaughter charges against eight employees of Skyguide. The prosecutor called for prison terms of up to 15 months if found guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6656487.stm |title=Swiss go on trial over air crash|publisher=BBC|date=15 May 2007|access-date=15 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The verdict was announced in September 2007. Three of the four managers convicted were given suspended prison terms and the fourth was ordered to pay a fine. Another four Skyguide employees were cleared of any wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=4 September 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6977136.stm |title=Four guilty over Swiss air crash|publisher=BBC| access-date=8 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Murder of Peter Nielsen ===
Devastated by the loss of his wife and two children aboard flight 2937, [[Vitaly Kaloyev]], a Russian architect, held Peter Nielsen responsible for their deaths. He tracked down and stabbed Nielsen to death, in the presence of his wife and three children, at his home in [[Kloten]], near Zürich, on 24 February 2004.&lt;ref name=skyguide /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20040226025158/http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/02/25/swiss.stabbing/index.html Swiss air crash controller killed]." [[CNN]]. Wednesday 25 February 2004. Retrieved on 29 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Swiss police arrested Kaloyev at a local motel shortly after, and in 2005 he was sentenced to prison for the murder. He was released in November 2007 because his mental condition was not sufficiently considered in the initial sentence. In January 2008, he was appointed deputy construction minister of [[North Ossetia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/russia-hails-vitaly-kaloyev-a-hero-tnjz3nswr9h|archive-url=https://archive.is/20170908152828/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/russia-hails-vitaly-kaloyev-a-hero-tnjz3nswr9h|dead-url=yes|archive-date=8 September 2017|title=Russia hails Vitaly Kaloyev a hero|last=Franchetti|first=Mark|date=10 February 2008|work=The Sunday Times|access-date=8 September 2017|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Kaloyev was awarded the highest state medal by the government, the medal "To the Glory of Ossetia".

==TCAS and conflicting orders==
The accident raised questions as to how pilots must react when they receive conflicting orders from the [[TCAS]] and from [[air traffic control]] (ATC). TCAS was a relatively new technology at the time of the accident, having been mandatory&lt;ref group=Note&gt;TCAS was mandatory for aircraft with a maximum certified take-off weight of over 30 tonnes or a seating capacity of over thirty passengers. Both aircraft involved in this accident met the criteria for mandatory TCAS installation.&lt;/ref&gt; in Europe since 2000.&lt;ref group=BFU&gt;page 45&lt;/ref&gt; When the TCAS issues a resolution advisory (RA), the pilot flying should respond immediately by direct attention to RA displays and maneuver as indicated, unless doing so would jeopardise the safe operation of the flight, or unless the flight crew can assure separation with the help of definitive visual acquisition of the aircraft causing the RA.&lt;ref name="faa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/TCAS%20II%20V7.1%20Intro%20booklet.pdf|title=Introduction to TCAS II Version 7.1|work=Federal Aviation Administration|date=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In responding to a TCAS RA that directs a deviation from assigned altitude, the flight crew should communicate with ATC as soon as practicable after responding to the RA. When the RA is removed, the flight crew should advise ATC that they are returning to their previously assigned clearance or should acknowledge any amended clearance issued.&lt;ref name="faa.gov"/&gt;

While the TCAS is programmed to assume that both crews will promptly follow the system's instructions, the operations manual did not clearly state that TCAS should always take precedence over any ATC commands.&lt;ref group=BFU&gt;page 103:  "Paragraph 6.1 of the TCAS Pilot's Guide states "TCAS 2000 is intended as a back-up to visual collision avoidance, application of 'right-of-way' rules, and ATC separation services", and leaves a degree of ambiguity over the interpretation of the term 'back-up'."&lt;/ref&gt; The manual described TCAS as "a backup to the ATC system", which could be wrongly interpreted to mean that ATC instructions have higher priority.&lt;ref group=BFU&gt;page 80 "The wording "TCAS is a backup to the ATC system..." could be interpreted that ATC takes priority to TCAS"&lt;/ref&gt; This ambiguity was replicated in the Tu-154 Flight Operations Manual, which contained contradictory sections. On the one hand, chapter 8.18.3.4 emphasised the role of the ATC and describes the TCAS as an "additional aid",&lt;ref group=BFU&gt;page 53 "For the avoidance of in-flight collisions is the visual control of the situation in the airspace by the crew and the correct execution of all instructions issued by the Air Traffic Controller to be viewed as the most important tool. [[TCAS]] is an additional instrument that ensures the timely determination of oncoming traffic, the classification of the risk and, if necessary, planning of an advice for a vertical avoidance manoeuvre." – TU154M Flight Operations Manual&lt;/ref&gt; while chapter 8.18.3.2 forbade manoeuvers contrary to the TCAS.&lt;ref group=BFU&gt;page 103&lt;/ref&gt; The BFU recommended that this ambiguity should be resolved in favor of obeying TCAS advisories even when these were in conflict with ATC instructions.&lt;ref group=BFU&gt;page 111 "Safety Recommendation 18/2003"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prior incident===
Seventeen months before the Bashkirian Airlines-DHL collision there had already been another incident involving confusion between conflicting TCAS and ATC commands. In 2001, two Japanese airliners [[2001 Japan Airlines mid-air incident|nearly collided]] with each other in Japanese skies. One of the aircraft had received conflicting orders from the TCAS and ATC; one pilot followed the instructions of the TCAS while the other did not. A collision was only averted because one of the pilots made evasive maneuvers based on a visual judgement. The aircraft missed each other by about {{convert|135|m|ft}}, and the abrupt maneuver necessary to avert disaster left 100 occupants injured on one aircraft, some seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlit.go.jp/jtsb/eng-air_report/JA8904.pdf|title=Aircraft Accident Investigation Report JAL907/JAL958|work=Aircraft and Railway Accidents Investigation Commission|date=12 July 2002|access-date=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pages=2,176,134,22}} In its report, published eleven days after the Überlingen accident, Japan called on the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) to make it clear that TCAS advisories should always take precedence over ATC instructions. ICAO accepted this recommendation and amended its regulations in November 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Flight Safety Digest, March 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical solutions===
Before this accident a change proposal (CP 112)&lt;ref name=CP112E&gt;[http://adsb.tc.faa.gov/TCAS/CPs/CP112E.pdf Change proposal CP112E] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109091211/http://adsb.tc.faa.gov/TCAS/CPs/CP112E.pdf |date=9 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the TCAS II system had been issued. This proposal would have created a "reversal" of the original warning – asking the DHL plane to climb and the Tupolev crew to descend.&lt;ref name=BFUp15 group=BFU&gt;page 35&lt;/ref&gt; According to an analysis by [[Eurocontrol]] this would have avoided the collision if the DHL crew had followed the new instructions and the Tupolev had continued to descend.&lt;ref name=BFUp15 group=BFU /&gt; All TCAS II equipped aircraft have been upgraded to support RA reversal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbaa.org/ops/cns/tcas/20120330-version-7-1.php|title=TCAS II Version 7.1 Requirements Coming to European Union|work=National Business Aviation Association|date=30 March 2012|access-date=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, an automatic downlink for the TCAS – which would have alerted the controller that a TCAS advisory had been issued to the aircraft under his control, and notified him of the nature of that advisory – had not been deployed worldwide at the time of the accident.&lt;ref group=BFU&gt;page 50&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2015}}

===Recommendations after the accident===
The investigation report contains a number of recommendations concerning TCAS, calling for upgrades and for better training and clearer instructions to the pilots.&lt;ref group=BFU&gt;Section 4 "Safety Recommendations", pages 111–113&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
* The collision featured in "Deadly Crossroads", a [[List of Mayday episodes#Season 2 (2004)|Season 2 (2004)]] episode of the Canadian TV series ''[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]]''&lt;ref name="Deadly Crossroads"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Deadly Crossroads|series=[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]]|network=[[Discovery Channel Canada]] / [[National Geographic Channel]]|season=2|number=4|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; (called ''Air Emergency'' and ''Air Disasters'' in the U.S. and ''Air Crash Investigation'' in the UK and elsewhere around the world). The dramatisation was broadcast in the United States with the title "A Father's Revenge"; and with the title "Mid-Air Collision" in the United Kingdom, Australia and Asia. The flight was also included in a ''Mayday'' [[List of Mayday episodes#Season 8 (2009) Special|Season 8 (2009) ''Science of Disaster'' special]] titled "System Breakdown",&lt;ref name="Mayday System Breakdown"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=System Breakdown|series=[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]]|network=[[Discovery Channel Canada]] / [[National Geographic Channel]]|season=8|number=1|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which looked at the role of air traffic controllers in aviation disasters.
* The [[National Geographic Channel]] documentary series ''[[Seconds From Disaster]]'' featured this mid-air collision in the episode entitled "Collision at 35,000 feet", released on 26 September 2011.
* The crash and the subsequent killing of the air traffic controller were used as the basis of a 2009 motion picture produced by German and Swiss TV stations [[Südwestrundfunk|SWR]] and [[Schweizer Fernsehen|SF]], called ''Flug in die Nacht – Das Unglück von Überlingen (Flight into the night – the accident at Überlingen)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1370431|Flug in die Nacht – Das Unglück von Überlingen}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 2018 Russian film ''[[Unforgiven (2018 film)|Unforgiven]]'' is based on the Überlingen mid-air collision with [[Dmitry Nagiyev]] portraying Kaloyev.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7394636/ IMDB Movie Page for "Unforgiven 2018" Film]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 2017 American film ''[[Aftermath (2017 film)|Aftermath]]'' is loosely based on the aftermath of the disaster, with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] portraying a character largely based on Kaloyev.&lt;ref name="Jun2015ECartelera"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ecartelera.com/noticias/23825/arnold-schwarzenegger-padre-vengativo-478|title=Arnold Schwarzenegger se convertirá en un padre vengativo en el drama '478' (Arnold Schwarzenegger will become a vengeful father in the drama '478')|last1=Da Costa|first1=Diego|date=24 June 2015|work=ecartelera.com|access-date=23 June 2015|archive-url=https://archive.is/20160201225534/http://www.ecartelera.com/noticias/23825/arnold-schwarzenegger-padre-vengativo-478/|archive-date=1 February 2016|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abraham Pais''' ({{IPAc-en|p|eɪ|s}}; May 19, 1918 – July 28, 2000) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]]-born [[United States|American]] [[physicist]] and [[science historian]]. Pais earned his Ph.D. from [[University of Utrecht]] just prior to a [[Nazi]] ban on [[Jews|Jewish]] participation in Dutch universities during [[World War II]]. When the Nazis began the forced relocation of [[Dutch Jews]], he went into hiding, but was later arrested and saved only by the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.humboldt.edu/rescuers/book/Strobos/BramPais/BramPaisStory1.html | title=Bram Pais Tells His Story (1986)| publisher=[[Humboldt State University]] | work=To Save A Life: Stories Of Holocaust Rescue | date=1986 | accessdate=2011-11-02 | author=Land-Weber, Ellen}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then served as an assistant to [[Niels Bohr]] in Denmark and was later a colleague of [[Albert Einstein]] at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]. Pais wrote books documenting the lives of these two great physicists and the contributions they and others made to [[modern physics]]. He was a physics professor at [[Rockefeller University]] until his retirement.

==Early life==
Pais was born in [[Amsterdam]], the first child of middle-class [[Dutch Jews|Dutch Jewish]] parents. His father, Isaiah "Jacques" Pais, was the descendant of [[Sephardic Jews]] who migrated from [[Portugal]] to the [[Low Countries]] around the beginning of the 17th century. His mother, Kaatje "Cato" van Kleeff, was the daughter of an [[Ashkenazi]] diamond cutter. His parents met while studying to become elementary-school teachers. They both taught school until his mother quit when they married on December 2, 1916. His only sibling, Annie, was born on November 1, 1920. During Pais's childhood his father was an elementary schoolmaster, headmaster, and later the headmaster of the [[Sephardic Hebrew]] school.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Pais was a bright student and a voracious reader during his early education and said he had a happy childhood and felt integrated in Dutch society.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pais|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age twelve he passed examinations to enter a higher burgher school and attended a school in Amsterdam with a five-year curriculum of basic subjects. He passed his final examinations as number one in his class. He graduated with a working knowledge of English, French, and German.

==Higher education==
In the fall of 1935 Pais began his studies at the [[University of Amsterdam]] without a clear idea regarding his desired career. With an interest in the exact sciences, he gradually gravitated to chemistry and physics as major subjects, and mathematics and astronomy as minor subjects. In the winter of 1936/1937 his career goals were defined by two guest lectures by [[George Uhlenbeck]], professor of theoretical physics at [[University of Utrecht]]. Pais was fascinated by Uhlenbeck's discussion of [[Enrico Fermi]]'s incorporation of the [[neutrino]] into the theory of [[beta radiation]].

On February 16, 1938, Pais was awarded two Bachelor of Science degrees in physics and mathematics, with minors in chemistry and astronomy. He began attending graduate courses in Amsterdam, including those in physics. He soon became disappointed by the only professor there in theoretical physics, {{Interlanguage link multi|Johannes Diderik van der Waals, Jr.|nl|3=Johannes Diderik van der Waals Jr}} (the son of the 1910 Nobel laureate [[Johannes Diderik van der Waals]]), whom he found dull and averse to the new developments in physics. Pais soon wrote to Uhlenbeck at Utrecht and was granted an interview. During the remainder of the spring term he discontinued attending classes in Amsterdam and made several trips to visit Uhlenbeck in his laboratory.

In the fall of 1938 Pais enrolled for graduate classes at [[University of Utrecht]]. Uhlenbeck, however, spent that term as a visiting professor at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]]. He left Pais with the use of his laboratory and a list of topics to study and work on. Pais was soon exposed to other prominent Dutch physicists and areas of research in experimental physics. He became well-acquainted with [[Hendrik Casimir]], a physics professor at [[Leiden University]] who lectured at Utrecht twice a week on [[quantum physics]]. When Uhlenbeck returned from America, he brought news of a meeting he had attended in [[Washington, D.C.]], in which [[Niels Bohr]] and [[Enrico Fermi]] had first made public their news about [[nuclear fission]]. Uhlenbeck also announced that he would be leaving in the summer of 1939 for a professorship at [[University of Michigan|University of Michigan, Ann Arbor]].

In the fall of 1939 Pais dedicated himself to preparing for his master's degree. Utrecht experimental physicist [[Leonard Salomon Ornstein]] provided him guidance in his independent physics studies. Uhlenbeck, in anticipation of his departure, introduced Pais to physicist [[Hendrik Anthony Kramers]] at Leiden University, who became his mentor and friend. He was also influenced then by discussions with [[Léon Rosenfeld]] of the [[University of Liège]], who was invited to Utrecht to give a colloquium in an effort to find a successor for Uhlenbeck and reported on the work he was then doing with [[Christian Møller]] on the meson theory of nuclear forces.

Pais successfully passed the examination for his master's degree on April 22, 1940. On May 7 the Dutch minister of education appointed Rosenfeld to succeed Uhlenbeck at the University of Utrecht. On May 8 Pais wrote to Rosenfeld at Liège to ask if he might continue his studies under him if his appointment came through, and again on May 9 to congratulate him on his appointment. On May 10, 1940, the Germans invaded the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, disrupting the mail between Utrecht and Liège for months.

After mail service was restored, Pais again wrote to Rosenfeld in Liège. In the meantime Pais had been appointed as Rosenfeld's assistant — Kees van Lier, who had been Uhlenbeck's assistant and was to continue as such under Rosenfeld, had committed suicide following the German invasion. Rosenfeld approved of his appointment and arrived at Utrecht in September 1940 and Pais began working on his doctoral dissertation.

Rosenfeld proposed that for his thesis Pais should formulate Rosenfeld and Møller's meson theory in terms of the five-dimensional space known as projective relativity theory, and then to use this theory to calculate the probability for the disintegration of deuterons when irradiated by energetic photons. Pais set to work studying projective relativity, meson theories, and nuclear physics related to the deuteron.

In November 1940 the German authorities issued a decree banning Jews from all civil service positions, including academic posts. Pais therefore lost his assistant professorship, though Rosenfeld secretly arranged for his successor to unofficially share the responsibilities and salary of the position with Pais. Professor Leonard Ornstein, however, lost his directorship of and access to the laboratory and died a broken man on May 20, 1941. A subsequent German decree ordered that doctorate degrees could not be issued to Jews after June 14, 1941. Pais worked feverishly to complete his dissertation and meet other requirements for his doctorate. He obtained his doctoral degree in [[theoretical physics]] on June 9, just five days before the deadline. His was the last Ph.D. issued to a Dutch Jew until after the war.

==German occupation==
During his student years Pais had been involved in the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]], through which he became acquainted with Trusha (Tirtsah) van Amerongen and [[Tina Strobos|Tina (Tineke) Strobos]], and developed a close friendship with these two women and their families.

The Germans began to gradually restrict the activities of the Dutch Jews and in early 1942 required them to wear yellow stars. At first Pais felt safe because his former university status exempted him from being sent to a labor camp. In early 1943, however, the Dutch secretary general of internal affairs, Frederiks, made arrangements for the university Jews to report to [[Barneveld (town)|Barneveld]] for their own safety, where they would be housed in a chateau. Pais did not trust that and instead went into hiding. Those who reported to Barneveld were later sent to the [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]] where most of them did survive.

His friend [[Tina Strobos]] was not Jewish and thus was free of restrictions and threat of incarceration. She arranged hiding places for Pais and other Jews in Amsterdam. When the Germans began forcing the Dutch Jews into a ghetto in the [[old Jewish quarter of Amsterdam]], his sister Annie and her husband Hermann complied. Tina found them a place to hide, but despite Pais's urgent pleas for them to take advantage of it, they did not think it necessary. Annie was later killed at the [[Sobibór extermination camp]]. Tina had found refuge for Pais's parents on a farm outside Amsterdam where they survived the war. She also acted as a courier between Pais and his parents during the war, though neither knew of the other's specific location.

His last hiding place was in an apartment with his university friend Lion Nordheim, his wife Jeanne, and her sister Trusha van Amerongen. In the course of his hiding he kept in touch with the scientific community through visits at his hiding place by [[Hendrik Kramers|Hendrik Anthony Kramers]] and [[Lambertus Johannes Folkert Broer|Lambertus Broer]]. Jeanne and Trusha had blond hair and blue eyes and ventured out in public as non-Jews, while Lion and Pais hid in the apartment. In March 1945, however, they were betrayed and all four were arrested. The same week the Americans had crossed the Rhine and cut the rail lines, making impossible their transfer to a concentration camp. The women were soon released. After a month of interrogation by the Gestapo, Pais was released several days before the end of the war. Nordheim was executed ten days before the end of the war.

==Career in particle physics==
During World War II, Pais's doctoral dissertation had attracted the attention of [[Niels Bohr]], who invited him to come to Denmark as his assistant. Pais was forced into hiding before he could leave the Netherlands. In 1946, following the war, Pais was able to accept that invitation and served as a personal assistant to Bohr at his country home in [[Tisvilde]] for a year.

In 1947 he accepted a position at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in the United States and thus became a colleague of [[Albert Einstein]].

In 1949 he became corresponding member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00002213 |title=Abraham Pais (1918 - 2000) |publisher=[[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] |date= |accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next 25 years he worked on [[elementary particle]] theory with a primary interest in [[quantum field theory]] and [[symmetry in physics|symmetry]]. The technical contributions for which he is recognized include a precise definition of [[G-parity]] with [[Res Jost]], and his treatment of [[SU(6)]] [[symmetry breaking]].

He is primarily associated with two concepts that directly contributed to major breakthroughs in his field. The first was the idea of "associated production" to explain the puzzling properties of [[strange particle]]s. His ideas and those of [[Murray Gell-Mann]] resulted in the idea of a [[quantum number]] called [[strangeness]]. The second concept was Pais's and Gell-Mann's theory regarding the composition of the neutral [[kaon]]s, proposing that the observed states were admixtures of particles and antiparticles, having different lifetimes; this was experimentally confirmed in the following year by Lederman and collaborators.
In 1956, Pais became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States.

In 1963 Pais accepted a position at [[Rockefeller University]] to head the theoretical physics group while Rockefeller was in transition from being a medical institute to a university. He finished his career there as the  [[Detlev W. Bronk]] professor emeritus.

In 1979, Pais was awarded the [[J. Robert Oppenheimer Memorial Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= Winners, the blue ribbon encyclopedia of awards |last=Walter |first=Claire |year=1982 |page= 438|publisher=Facts on File Inc.|isbn=9780871963864 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Abraham Pais wins Oppenheimer prize |url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/article/32/4/10.1063/1.2995507 |journal=[[Physics Today]] |publisher=[[American Institute of Physics]] |date=April 1979 |page= |doi=10.1063/1.2995507 |access-date=1 March 2015 |bibcode = 1979PhT....32d..70. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science historian==
In the late 1970s Pais became interested in documenting the [[history of modern physics]]. He felt he was in a unique position to do so, having known many of the key people and with his knowledge of the language, culture, and science.

Pais was perhaps best known for his biography of [[Albert Einstein]], ''"Subtle is the Lord—": The science and the life of Albert Einstein'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 1982),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Goldberg, Stanley|title=Review of ''Subtle Is the Lord...'' by Abraham Pais|journal=[[American Journal of Physics]]|year=1984|volume=52|issue=10|pages=951–953|doi=10.1119/1.13801|bibcode = 1984AmJPh..52..951P }}&lt;/ref&gt; and its sequel, ''Einstein Lived Here'' (Clarendon Press/Oxford University Press, 1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Parsegian, V. Adrian|title=Review of ''Einstein Lived Here'' by Abraham Pais|journal=[[Biophysical Journal]]|volume=69|issue=3|date=September 1995|pmc=1236348|page=1193–1194|bibcode = 1995BpJ....69.1193P |doi = 10.1016/S0006-3495(95)79994-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''"Subtle is the Lord—"'' won the 1983 U.S. [[National Book Award]] in Science.&lt;ref name=nba1983&gt;
[https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1983 "National Book Awards – 1983"]. [[National Book Foundation]]. Retrieved 2012-03-07.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;
This was the [[List of winners of the National Book Award#Science|award for hardcover Science]].
&lt;br /&gt;From 1980 to 1983 in [[National Book Awards#History|National Book Awards history]] there were dual hardcover and paperback awards in most categories, and [[National Book Award for Nonfiction#nonfiction categories|several nonfiction subcategories]] including General Nonfiction. Most of the paperback award-winners were reprints, including the 1983 Science.&lt;/ref&gt;

His ''Inward Bound: Of matter and forces in the physical world'' ([[Clarendon Press]]/Oxford University Press, 1988) describes the events in physics during the preceding 100 years, and tries to explain why they happened as they did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|author=Heilbron, John|authorlink=John L. Heilbron|title=Review of ''Inward Bound'' by Abraham Pais|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=25 May 1986|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-05-25/books/bk-7072_1_physicists}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Pippard, Brian]]|title=Review of ''Inward Bound'' by Abraham Pais|journal=[[London Review of Books]]|date=4 September 1986|volume=8|issue=15|pages=17–18|url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/v08/n15/brian-pippard/magnetic-moments}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hacking, Ian|authorlink=Ian Hacking|date=26 February 1987|title=Review of ''Inward Bound'' by Abraham Pais|journal=[[The New York Review of Books]]|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1987/02/26/when-the-atom-broke-down/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 he published ''Niels Bohr's Times: In physics, philosophy, and polity'' (Clarendon Press/Oxford University Press, 1991) which describes the life and scientific contributions of Bohr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|author=Rhodes, Richard|authorlink=Richard Rhodes|title=Review of ''Niels Bohr's Times'' by Abraham Pais|newspaper=New York Times|date=26 January 1992|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/26/books/the-philosopher-physicist.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 he teamed with [[Laurie M. Brown]] and Sir [[Brian Pippard]] to compile a three-volume reference collection of articles portraying the scientific and cultural development of modern physics in ''Twentieth Century Physics'' ([[American Institute of Physics]] and the [[Institute of Physics]], U.K., 1995). That same year Rockefeller University awarded him the [[Lewis Thomas Prize|Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing about Science]].

''A Tale of Two Continents: A physicist's life in a turbulent world'' ([[Princeton University Press]], 1997) was his autobiography. It refers to the '[[Perception#Reality|esemplastic power of the imagination]]'.

His book ''The Genius of Science: A portrait gallery'' (Oxford University Press, 2000) contains biographies of seventeen distinguished physicists he had known personally:  [[Niels Bohr]],  [[Max Born]], [[Paul Dirac]], [[Albert Einstein]],  [[Mitchell Feigenbaum]], [[Res Jost]], [[Oskar Klein]],  [[Hans Kramers]],  [[Tsung-Dao Lee]] and [[Chen Ning Yang]],  [[John von Neumann]], [[Wolfgang Pauli]], [[Isidor Isaac Rabi]], [[Robert Serber]],  [[George Uhlenbeck]],  [[Victor Frederick Weisskopf]], and [[Eugene Wigner]].

Pais was working on a biography of [[Robert Oppenheimer]] at the time of his death. It was finished by [[Robert P. Crease]] and published posthumously as ''J. Robert Oppenheimer: A life'' (Oxford University Press, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Herken, Gregg|title=Review of ''J. Robert Oppenheimer'' by Abraham Pais and Robert P.

The [[American Physical Society]] has awarded an [[Abraham Pais Prize for History of Physics]] annually since 2005.

==Later life==
After his retirement Pais and his third wife Ida Nicolaisen spent half their time in Denmark where he worked at the [[Niels Bohr Institute]]. His son [[Josh Pais]] is an American actor. Pais died of heart failure in [[Copenhagen]].

'''Academic fencing''' (German '''akademisches Fechten''') or '''''Mensur''''' is the traditional kind of [[fencing]] practiced by some [[Corporation (university)|student corporations]] (''[[Studentenverbindung]]en'') in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[Latvia]], [[Estonia]], and, to a minor extent, in [[Belgium]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]]. It is a traditional, strictly regulated épée/rapier fight between two male members of different fraternities with sharp weapons. The German technical term ''Mensur'' (from Latin, ''dimension'') in the 16th century referred to the specified distance between each of the fencers.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Paschke: Corpsstudentisches Wörterbuch.

Modern academic fencing, the ''Mensur'', is neither a [[duel]] nor a [[sport]]. It is a traditional way of training and educating character and personality; thus, in a mensur bout, there is neither winner nor loser.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} In contrast to sport fencing, the participants stand their ground at a fixed distance. At the beginning of the tradition, duelers wore only their normal clothing (as duels sometimes would arise spontaneously) or light-cloth armor on arm, torso, and throat. In recent years, fencers are protected by [[Mail (armour)|mail]] or padding for the body, fencing arm, fencing hand ([[gauntlet (gloves)|gauntlet]]) and the throat, completed by steel goggles with a nose guard. In Austria and Switzerland a nose guard is uncommon. They fence at arm's length and stand more or less in one place, while attempting to hit the unprotected areas of their opponent's face and head. Flinching or dodging is not allowed, the goal being less to avoid injury than to endure it stoically. Two physicians are present (one for each opponent) to attend to injuries and stop the fight if necessary.

The participants, or ''Paukanten'', use specially developed swords. The so-called ''Mensurschläger'' (or simply ''Schläger''), exists in two versions. The most common weapon is the ''Korbschläger'' with a basket-type [[Guard (weapon)#Guard|guard]]. Some universities use the so-called ''Glockenschläger'', which is equipped with a bell-shaped guard. These universities are [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]], [[University of Greifswald|Greifswald]], [[Technische Universität Dresden|Dresden]], Tharandt (in the Forestry College, which is now part of Technische Universität Dresden), [[University of Halle|Halle on the Saale]], [[Viadrina University|Frankfurt-an-der-Oder]], and [[Freiberg University of Mining and Technology|Freiberg]]. In [[University of Jena|Jena]], both ''Korbschläger'' and ''Glockenschläger'' are used. ''Studentenverbindungen'' from some western cities use ''Glockenschläger'' because their tradition had its origin in one of the eastern universities but moved to West Germany after [[World War II]].

The [[scar resulting from a hit]] is called a "smite" ([[German language|German]] ''Schmiss''), and was seen as a badge of honour, especially in the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th. Today, it is not easy for an outsider to identify Mensur scars due to better medical treatment. Also the number of mandatory Mensuren were reduced in the second half of the 20th century. Most Mensur scars are located on the left temple of the forehead. Scars on the cheek and chin are rather uncommon today and sometimes due to accidents.

[[File:Small sword.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Typical smallsword of the 1740s]]
Starting in Spain at the end of the 15th century, the dueling sword ([[rapier]]) became a regular part of the attire of noblemen throughout Europe. In the [[Holy Roman Empire]], this became usual among students, as well. Brawling and fighting were regular occupations of students in the German-speaking areas during the [[early modern period]]. In line with developments in the aristocracy and the military, regulated duels were introduced to the academic environment, as well. The basis of this was the conviction that being a student meant being something different from the rest of the population. Students wore special clothes, developed special kinds of festivities, sang student songs, and fought duels, sometimes spontaneously (so called ''rencontre'', French "meeting" or "combat"), sometimes according to strict regulations called ''comment'' (French "how"). The weapons used were the same as those employed in civilian [[dueling]], being at first the [[rapier]] and later the [[smallsword]] (court sword, dress sword, French ''l'épée de cour'', German ''Kostümdegen'', ''Galanteriedegen''), which was seen as part of the dress and always at hand as a [[side arm]].

Student life was quite unsafe in these years, especially in the 16th and 17th centuries during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] wars and the [[Thirty Year War|Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648), when a major part of the German population was killed. Public life was brutal and students killing each other in the street was not uncommon.

A major step towards civilization was the introduction of the "regulated" [[duel]], of which the first recordings exist from the 17th century. The fight was not decided on the spot, but the time and location were appointed and negotiations were done by officials. A so-called ''Kartellträger'' did the arrangements and a "second" represented the interests of the fighter during the duel and could even give physical protection from illegal actions. A kind of referee was present to make decisions, and eventually the practice of having an attending doctor became normal so as to give medical help in case of an injury.

At the end of the 18th century (after the [[French Revolution]]), wearing of weapons in everyday life fell out of fashion and was more and more forbidden, even for students. This certainly reduced the number of spontaneous duels dramatically. The regulated duel remained in use, though still forbidden.

[[File:Pariser.jpg|thumb|left|''Pariser'' small sword, derived from the French [[foil (fencing)|foil]]]]

The [[Foil (fencing)|foil]] was invented in France as a training weapon in the middle of the 18th century to practice fast and elegant thrust fencing. Fencers blunted the point by wrapping a foil around the blade or fastening a knob on the point ("blossom", French ''fleuret''). In addition to practising, some fencers took away the protection and used the sharp foil for duels. German students took up that practice and developed the ''Pariser'' ("Parisian") thrusting small sword for the ''Stoßmensur'' ("thrusting mensur"). After the dress sword was abolished, the ''Pariser'' became the only weapon for academic thrust fencing in Germany.

Since fencing on thrust with a sharp point is quite dangerous, many students died from their lungs being pierced (''Lungenfuchser''), which made breathing difficult or impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q0YABAAAQBAJ|title=Dueling: The Cult of Honor in Fin-de-Siecle Germany|last=McAleer|first=Kevin|date=2014-07-14|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400863877|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the counter movement had already started in Göttingen in the 1760s. Here the ''Göttinger Hieber'' was invented, the predecessor of the modern ''Korbschläger'', a new weapon for cut fencing. In the following years, the ''Glockenschläger'' was invented in east German universities for cut fencing as well.

Thrust fencing (using ''Pariser'') and cut fencing using ''[[Korbschläger]]'' or ''[[Glockenschläger]]'') existed in parallel in Germany during the first decades of the 19th century—with local preferences. Thrust fencing was especially popular in [[Jena]], [[Erlangen]], [[Würzburg]], and [[Ingolstadt]]/[[Landshut]], two towns where the predecessors of Munich University were located. The last thrust ''Mensur'' is recorded to have taken place in Würzburg in 1860.

Until the first half of the 19th century, all types of academic fencing can be seen as duels, since all fencing with sharp weapons was about honour. No combat with sharp blades took place without a formal insult. Compared to pistol duels, these events were quite harmless.{{fact|date=August 2018}} The fight regularly ended when a contestant received a wound at least one inch long that produced at least one drop of blood. It was not uncommon for students to have fought approximately 10 to 30 duels of that kind during their university years. The German student Fritz Bacmeister is the 19th century record holder, due to his estimated 100 mensur bouts fought in [[Göttingen]], [[Jena]], and [[Würzburg]] between 1860 and 1866.&lt;ref&gt;In Göttingen only, 51 mensur bouts of Bacmeister are historically recorded, in Jena and Würzburg, 15 bouts per student are regarded as average - and Bacmeister is seen as above average, so the number of 100 appears realistic. See also Frank Huss: ''Fritz Bacmeister – Corpsstudent und Abenteurer''. In: ''Einst und Jetzt. Jahrbuch 2008 des Vereins für corpsstudentische Geschichtsforschung''. Volume 53, Neustadt an der Aisch 2008, pages 366f.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 20th and 21st century it was Alexander Kliesch (Landsmannschaft Brandenburg Berlin) with 70.

For duels with nonstudents, e.g., military officers, the "academic sabre" became usual, apparently derived from the military [[sabre]]. It was a heavy weapon with a curved blade and a hilt similar to the ''Korbschläger''.

During the first half of the 19th century and some of the 18th century, students believed the character of a person could easily be judged by watching him fight with sharp blades under strict regulations. Academic fencing was more and more seen as a kind of personality training by showing countenance and fairness even in dangerous situations. Student corporations demanded their members fight at least one duel with sharp blades during their university time. The problem was that some peaceful students had nobody to offend them. The solution was a kind of formal insult that did not actually infringe honour, but was just seen as a challenge for fencing. The standard wording was ''dummer Junge'' (German for "young fool.")

In the long term, this solution was unsatisfying. Around 1850, the ''Bestimmungsmensur'' (German ''bestimmen'' means "ascertain", "define" or "determine") was developed and introduced throughout Germany. This meant the opponents of a ''Mensur'' were determined by the fencing official of their corporations. These officials were regularly vice-chairmen (''Consenior'') and responsible for arranging ''Mensur'' bouts in cooperation with their colleagues from other corporations. Their objective was to find opponents of equal physical and fencing capabilities to make the event challenging for both participants. That is the way it is still done today, and is the concept of the ''Mensur'' in the modern sense of the word.

Before the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Communist revolution]] in [[Russia]] and before [[World War II]], academic fencing was known in most countries of [[Eastern Europe]], as well.

==Modern Mensur==

By the end of the 19th century, the dueling form evolved into the modern Mensur.  In 1884, the British [[Saturday Review (London)|Saturday Review]] described the dueling as follows:&lt;ref&gt;''The Saturday Review,'' "German Students' Duels," in E. Littell and R. S. Littell, eds.,''Littell's Living Age, Vol. 160'', pp. 512-513,  Jan.-Mar. 1884.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the German Schläger combat the position is the same as in [[Backsword|back-swording]], save that the left arm is kept, as in sabre play, behind the body; commonly the waistband of the trousers is grasped by the left hand. The weapon is a long, narrow blade, like a pointless rapier, but much more flexible. It is sharpened for a length of twenty centimetres (say eight inches) on the true edge, and five on the false edge. For practice and instruction blunt and rather stouter blades are used. The mask is like an English [[Singlestick|single-stick]] mask, but stronger and heavier. A padded leather vest, coming almost down to the knees, covers the body, and the right arm is encased in a sleeve attached to a gauntlet, which may be compared to an elongated Rugby football. In the actual duel there is an even more elaborate system of defense ; the right wrist is guarded with a ring of mail, and the arm with folds of silk, which, like the turban of the East, are enough to stop any ordinary cut. Practically, though not according to strict rule, the body is altogether covered. The eyes are protected by iron spectacles, with strong wire net instead of glasses. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the times of the [[Third Reich]], the national socialist leadership chose to forbid academic fencing. They had recognized that Mensur fencing was an integral part to the internal strength of the last still-existing independent [[Studentenverbindung]] fraternities  during the later 1930s. As Nazi pressure increased and fraternities were forced to officially suspend their activities, so-called comradeships were founded. These provided means for practicing and organizing the Mensur among former fraternities while remaining undetected to the Nazi secret police. One such example was the SC-Comradeship ''[[Hermann Löns]]'' initiated by members of the [[Corps Hubertia Freiburg]] and other fraternities in [[Freiburg]], Germany. There, fencing Mensur "duels" continued and even intensified from 1941 on, with over 100 of such duels happening during World War II in Freiburg alone.&lt;ref&gt;Leo Alexander Ricker: ''Freiburger Mensuren in der nationalsozialistischen Verbotszeit''. Einst und Jetzt 10 (1968), S. 70–82&lt;/ref&gt; Following the war, most of the formerly suspended fraternities were reactivated and resumed the traditions of Mensur fencing, if they had not continued throughout the time of Nazi occupation.

Today, the Mensur is practiced by about 400 traditional ''Studentenverbindung'' fraternities in Germany, including all the [[German Student Corps|Corps]] and several of the [[Burschenschaft]]en, [[Landsmannschaft]]en, [[Turnerschaft]]en and [[Sängerschaft]]en. Menzura, as the Mensur is known in Poland, is still practised although its popularity declined after the World War II. 

==In literature==
[[File:Menzura-Korporacja Sarmatia 2004.jpg|thumb|Preparations for a mensur; here between members of a Polish Corporation Sarmatia and a German fraternity ([[Freiburg im Breisgau]], 2004)]]
American traveller [[Mark Twain]] devoted several chapters of ''[[A Tramp Abroad]]'' (1880) to [[Heidelberg]] students' fencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Tramp Abroad|last=Twain|first=Mark|publisher=|year=1880|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Chapter V. At The Students' Dueling Ground|chapter-url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/A_Tramp_Abroad/V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Three Men on the Bummel]]'' (1900), [[Jerome K. Jerome]] devoted a chapter to German student life, and describes the "German Mensur" in detail. While much of the book has a tone of admiration for the German people, he expressed extreme disapproval for this tradition.

In [[George MacDonald Fraser]]'s ''[[Royal Flash]]'' (1970), the protagonist [[Harry Flashman]] is scarred with a ''Schläger'' as part of his disguise as a Danish prince.

Mensur is featured in [[Heinrich Mann]]'s novel ''Man of Straw'' (''[[Der Untertan]]'').

Mensur scars are repeatedly noted and described as a sign of beauty and manliness by German characters in [[Katherine Anne Porter]]'s novel [[Ship of Fools (Porter novel)|''Ship of Fools'']].

Mensur scars are mentioned in passing in [[Robert Heinlein]]'s ''[[Starship Troopers]]'' when two German recruits are asked at the beginning of boot camp where they got their scars. The drill sergeant even uses the term ''Korpsbruder'' (as spelled in modern German). E. C. Gordon, the hero of Heinlein's ''[[Glory Road]]'', mentions his desire for a degree from Heidelberg and the dueling scars to go with it.

The opening scene of "The Mystery of the Spanish Chest," in season three of ''[[Agatha Christie's Poirot]]'', features two men fighting in the mensur style. The episode's dialogue implies that the fencers are English, rather than German, and that one fencer has challenged the other to a duel over a woman.

In the [[James Bond]] books by [[Ian Fleming]], the [[supervillain]] [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] has a dueling scar below his eye.

==In film==
The Mensur is featured in a number of [[Cinema of Germany|German film]]s, notably:
* ''[[Hans Westmar | Hans Westmar - Einer von Vielen]]'' ("Hans Westmar - One of Many"), 1933
*''[[Der Untertan (film)|Der Untertan]]'', 1951

and less commonly in films outside Germany, such as
*''[[The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp]]'', 1943
*''[[Royal Flash (film)|Royal Flash]]'', 1975

==In television==
*"The Mystery of the Spanish Chest" in series 3 of ''[[Agatha Christie's Poirot]]'' begins with a mensur.
* In Roald Dahl's ''Tales of the Unexpected'', "The Vorpal Blade", the story revolves around duelling in this period

The '''anti-gag statute''' is a little-known legal boundary in the long struggle in the United States between Executive Branch secrecy and the [[United States Congress]] and the public’s right to know.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Justice Department Opens NSA Leak Probe |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,180190,00.html |date=2005-12-30 |work=Fox News |accessdate=2006-12-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209193140/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C180190%2C00.html |archivedate=9 December 2006 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1988, the statute has been an annual appropriations restriction drawing the line on Executive branch efforts to limit whistleblowing disclosures to information that is specifically identified in advance as classified.{{Clarify me|date=May 2008}} The anti-gag statute requires a mandatory, specifically worded addendum on any nondisclosure policy, form or agreement to legally spend money to implement or enforce the gag order. 

The addendum states that the [[Whistleblower Protection Act]] of 1989 (protecting public disclosures) and the [[Lloyd–La Follette Act]] of 1912 (protecting congressional communications) supersede any restrictive language in the gag order. The addendum even incorporates by reference the language of those and other related good government and national security laws into every federally enforced gag order, as a prerequisite to be legally enforceable. It has been unanimously renewed every year since 1988.

==Background==
The anti-gag statute was first passed in response to Reagan administration nondisclosure agreements, primarily known as SF 189 and SF 312, which employees had to sign as a prerequisite to keep or obtain their security clearances. The forms were gag orders that would have effectively created a back door [[Official Secrets Act]] for 2.4 million clearance holders if implemented as planned.  The agreements were to be enforced through loss of clearance and felony prosecution for releasing any “classifiable” information without advance approval.  

What did “classifiable” mean? Steve Garfinkel, President [[Ronald Reagan]]’s chief of the Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO) that implemented SF 189, informed Congress that it meant anything that could or should have been classified, or “virtually anything.” In other words, without advance permission, whistleblowers could be prosecuted based on an after-the-fact call that almost any information they released was classified. “Classifiable” would have created a new hybrid secrecy, or “pseudo-classification” category that imposed sweeping prior restraint for admittedly less sensitive information.   

After 1.7 million federal employees and contractors acquiesced by signing SF 189, Pentagon whistleblower [[A. Ernest Fitzgerald|Ernie Fitzgerald]] sparked a legislative and legal counterattack by refusing to do so.  At one of numerous congressional hearings on the matter, Sen. Charles Grassley (R-IA) characterized the administration’s non-disclosure policy as an effort to “place a blanket of silence over all information generated by the government.”3 As a counter-attack, in 1988, Congress banned spending on SF 189. The Administration withdrew the form and substituted a new one, but the only change was to replace “classifiable” with “unmarked but classified.” Critics rejected the impact as disingenuous and meaningless, because whistleblowers still would have to seek advance approval from their supervisors to know for certain whether making a disclosure would be a crime. 

After Congress enacted the spending ban, the Administration filed a constitutional challenge that went to the Supreme Court, arguing that the law infringed on the Commander in Chief's powers. After the Supreme Court temporarily ducked the issue, Congress in 1989 rewrote the spending ban in its current language, which has not been challenged.  The final anti-gag statute circumvents the Administration’s constitutional challenge by requiring the President to obey the relevant good government and national security laws he already signed. Although the law’s roots involve a national security controversy, its language sets the terms for lawful-spending to enforce any Executive branch restriction on free speech rights.

==Renewed threat==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2008}}
{{POV-check|date=May 2008}}
The campaign to put enforcement teeth in the anti-gag statute has become even more significant, due to two recent factors.  First, there has been an increasing number of national security and non-national security gag orders during the last few years.  Critics have called these illegally broad.  Gag orders have been used in attempts to silence America’s top government scientists on matters ranging from the secret additional $800 million in the prescription drug bill, to U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) cover-ups of knowledge about dangerous drugs such as [[Vioxx]], to the most alarming scientific research on the imminent threat from [[global warming]].  Second, while the term "classifiable" was removed from executive gag orders in 1989, new designations similar to "classifiable" have developed.  These include "Sensitive, but Unclassified," "Sensitive Security Information," and "Critical Infrastructure Information" (a congressionally created version from the [[Patriot Act]]). They all have the same characteristics – employment and criminal liability for non-classified disclosures of arguably anything without prior permission. In fact, their threat is greater than the original Reagan-era nondisclosure policy, because these restrictions impose an Official Secrets Act on every federal employee or contractor, not just those with security clearances. 

The new hybrid secrecy categories also have been used to camouflage phony announcements of free speech reform. To illustrate, [[NASA]] recently issued a new media policy to quell the controversy around an unsuccessful attempt to gag its top [[climate change]] scientist, Dr. [[James Hansen]]. The policy appears to respect employees' free speech rights as private citizens, but there is an all-encompassing loophole: the policy defies the WPA by requiring prior approval for all whistleblower disclosures that are "Sensitive But Unclassified" (SBU). The legal definition of SBU is overly broad and vague, and potentially can sweep in any information. Illustrative definitions include the Energy Department’s ("information for which disclosure … could adversely affect national security or government interests") and the State Department’s ("information which, if released, could result in or harm or unfair treatment to any individual or group"). NASA’s own procedures do not define the term explicitly, but explain that it replaces the broad category "For Official Use Only."

==Impact==
Like the Lloyd–Lafollete Act protecting communications with Congress, the anti-gag statute has been an effective weapon for lawyers to discredit, negotiate and generally call repressive government bluffs. On the micro level, it is a resource that the [[Government Accountability Project]] (GAP) has consistently used in challenging gag orders and retaliatory investigations to enforce them.{{cn|date=July 2013}}  

On the macro level, however, the anti-gag statute suffers from the same defect as the Lloyd Lafollette Act: it is a right without a remedy. Those victimized by its violation do not have any formal legal access to enforce the right. Further, because it is an annual appropriations rider, it will expire unless specifically passed each year.

==Relevance of pending whistleblower legislation==
Pending Senate and House legislation, S.494 and H.R. 1317 respectively, would permanently codify the anti-gag statute’s provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=S. 1358, the Federal Employee Protection of Disclosures Act: Amendments to the Whistleblower Protection Act | url=http://hsgac.senate.gov/index.cfm?Fuseaction=Hearings.Testimony&amp;HearingID=129&amp;WitnessID=452 |date=2003-12-03 | work=Official website of the U.S. Senate | accessdate=2006-12-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061130092207/http://hsgac.senate.gov/index.cfm?Fuseaction=Hearings.Testimony&amp;HearingID=129&amp;WitnessID=452| archivedate= 30 November 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bills also make issuing a gag order without the law’s mandatory addendum/notification requirement a prohibited personnel practice under the CSRA. S. 494 bars Critical Infrastructure Information status from canceling whistleblower rights. H.R. 1317 does not, although H.R. 5112 has an alternate approach to control all pseudo-classification categories.

'''Vaux's Law''' (as labelled by Avery &amp; Idsardi 2001, Iverson &amp; Salmons 2003), which he first formulated in a 1998 article in ''Linguistic Inquiry'', states that [[Larynx|laryngeally]] unspecified – i.e. [[voiceless]] – [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]] become [GW]/[sg] ([Glottal Width]/[spread glottis]) in systems contrasting fricatives without reference to [GW]/[sg]; thus they are to be [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] or, more technically, to be pronounced with a spread [[glottis]].&lt;ref name="Avery"&gt;Avery, Peter and William J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3965">'''Boston Schoolyard Initiative''' (BSI) is a public private partnership that works to transform the conditions of public schoolyards of [[Boston Public Schools]]. BSI, in collaboration with private funders, the City of Boston and Boston Public Schools, uses a community [[participatory design]] process to change neglected and unwelcome schoolyards into centers for active school and community use. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eric.ed.gov:80/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED443266&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED443266 Approach to sustainable schoolyard development]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Boston Schoolyard Initiative was created in 1995, following community concern and complaint about the conditions in neglected schoolyards. After comprehensive site assessments and outreach to stakeholders including community residents, environmental groups, educators and city officials, a Task Force under leadership of Mayor [[Thomas Menino]] recommended the establishment of BSI. The private sector part of the BSI partnerships is a group of philanthropies called the Boston Schoolyard Funders Collaborative. 

As a result of this collaborative effort, BSI has renovated 74 schoolyards into places for active play with modern and safe play equipment and play surfaces. In 2004, observing the need and opportunity to create stronger connections between everyday curriculum and the outdoor environment, the BSI began developing, through a pilot program, concepts and designs for Outdoor Classrooms within schoolyards. The BSI has designed and created 26 Outdoor Classrooms for K-5 schools and 2 in High Schools.

==Educational use of schoolyards==
Teachers unfamiliar with working with students outside the school classroom may be concerned that if they take students outside they will lose control of student attention and focus. Through evaluation of student and teacher use of renovated schoolyards and Outdoor Classrooms, the BSI has developed methods to enhance the use of the outdoors in schoolyards to support required school curriculum. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rwjf.org/reports/grr/053705.htm Study of BSI Schoolyard Renovations]&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional development workshops and the writing of curriculum are used by BSI to connect programs in science and literacy to the Schoolyard and Outdoor Classroom. Both the schoolyard and Outdoor Classroom have been shown to be a valuable expansion of the learning environment in Boston Public Schools. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peecworks.org/PEEC/PEEC_Research/S03665430-03665451 Research]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Boston Schoolyard Initiative supports the design process with a community based Schoolyard Design Workbook, and protocols for maintenance and sustainable use of schoolyards. BSI works with school communities to help schoolyards to become places for [[Environmental education]]; summer educational programs; health, fitness and wellness programs; and in some cases sites for [[Community gardening|community gardening]].

Officially the '''Center for the Advancement of Natural Discoveries using Light Emission''', more commonly '''CANDLE Synchrotron Research Institute''', is a project and a research  center-institute in [[Yerevan]], [[Armenia]]. CANDLE is a project of 3 [[gigaelectronvolt]]s energy, third generation [[synchrotron]] [[light source]] for fundamental, industrial and applied research in [[biology]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[medicine]], [[Materials science|material]] and [[environmental science]]s.

Overall the facility is expected to serve more than 40 [[research group]]s simultaneously supporting the [[spectroscopy]], scattering, imaging and [[time resolved experiment]]s.

The project is claimed to be demanded by international scientific community and is expected to have a vast impact on development of science in Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = |  first = | title = Armenia with CANDLE project and without it: two different countries (in Russian) | publisher = Golos Aarmenii | date = 2010-02-04 | url = http://www.golosarmenii.am/ru/19943/society/1490/ | accessdate = 2011-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of Armenia allocated an area of 20 ha near the town of [[Abovyan]] for the upcoming projects of the center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediamax.am/am/news/society/8820/ New land allocated for the CANDLE project]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''COPE''' is an acronym for '''Challenging Outdoor Personal Experience''', a program in the [[Boy Scouts of America]]. It consists of group initiative games, trust events, and high and low [[ropes course]].  Some activities involve a group challenge, while others develop individual skills and agility.  Participants climb, swing, balance, jump, rappel, and devise solutions to a variety of problems.&lt;ref name="COPE manual"&gt;{{cite book| title=Project COPE| year=2011| edition=2004| publisher=[[Boy Scouts of America]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also jokingly called '''C'''hildren '''O'''n '''P'''layground '''E'''quipment because of the activities the scouts participate in.

==History==
In 1920, [[Kurt Hahn]] established the Salem School, based on principles personal responsibility, kindness, and justice towards developing the fitness and confidence of participants.&lt;ref name="COPE manual"/&gt;  After being imprisoned in Germany then exiled to Great Britain in 1933, in 1941 Hahn established the [[Outward Bound]] program to train people for life by using the challenges of the sea and mountains.  The program includes rescue technique and service to people with the motto being, "Training through the body, not of the body."&lt;ref name="COPE manual"/&gt;  In 1970, [[Project Adventure]] began as a curriculum program in Massachusetts, since becoming a clearinghouse for adventure-based programs.  In 1975, Scouts from the [[Pony Express Council]] experienced [[NORJAM]], the Ropes Course at the [[14th World Scout Jamboree]] in Norway, including Scout executive Parvin Bishop.  In 1981, the Pony Express Council built the BSA's first COPE course at the council's [[Camp Geiger (Boy Scouts of America)|Camp Geiger]] near [[St. Joseph, Missouri]].  When Bishop became Director of Program at the [[BSA National Office]], he took the program national and in 1983, the BSA National Council made Project COPE part of the BSA camping program and began offering training through the National Camping School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usscouts.org/boyscouts/cope.html |title=C.O.P.E. |accessdate=2007-06-09 |publisher=[[U.S. Scouting Service Project]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scouting.org/Media/FactSheets/02-543.aspx |title=Fact Sheet:Project COPE |accessdate=2007-06-09 |publisher=Boy Scouts of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980 a team of staff and volunteers in Pony Express Council developed a Rope Course and Orienteering program under then Scout Executive Parvin Bishop as part of the council's long range planning. Bishop named the new program Project COPE. The following professionals worked with Bishop on building and marketing the Project COPE program in its first few years:  Al Vasey, Rich Cole, Curt Palmer,  Bill Pennistion and Warren Wenner. The first two years of the Pony Express Council's Project COPE program had two days of ropes course programs and low course events and one day of  Orienteering programs.   After two years the Project  COPE program cut the day of orienteering program.   Warren Wenner then a staff member  served as the 1st Project COPE Director for the Council's Project  program from 1980 to 1983 and also  served as the 1st Course Director for National  Camp School Camp Project COPE section held at Camp  Jayhawk in Kansas. Wenner moved to Heart of America Council and  was also the 1st Project COPE director for  the Council at Camp Naish in 1984.  Bill Penniston another staff member wrote the 1st Program COPE handbook that was edited by both Penniston and Wenner.  Both helped national write the 1st national camping standards and national guide book as Project COPE became a national program.  Council Staff member Rich Cole served as the Summer Camp COPE in 1980 which was the 1st summer that Project COPE was a program at Camp Gieger. Wenner worked with Rich that first summer serving as Camp Gieger Camp Director.  Curt Palmer Council staff member worked across the central region working with councils on building Project COPE courses.  He also served on Project COPE National Camp School Staff  ( staff member from 1979 to 1983 and ''Scouting'' magazine story Jan-Feb 1983 titled "Learning to COPE" ).

==Goals==
Each Project COPE program emphasizes eight goals.&lt;ref name="COPE manual"/&gt;

'''Carleton Wolsey Washburne''' (December 2, 1889 – November 28, 1968) &lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=gL9scSG3K_gC&amp;dat=19681129&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en "Educator Washburn Dies at 78"], ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', November 29, 1968, p5&lt;/ref&gt;
was an American educator and education reformer. He served as the superintendent of schools in [[Winnetka, Illinois]], United States from 1919 to 1943 and is most notably associated with the [[Winnetka Plan]] that he developed for his district.

==Early life and education==
Carleton Wolsey Washburne was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] in 1889 to an [[obstetrician]] father. His mother was active in political affairs, especially education, and was a friend of innovative educator [[John Dewey]]. The family was well-educated, though not particularly wealthy. Washburne was raised Protestant and attended the [[Francis W. Parker School (Chicago)|Francis W. Parker School]].&lt;ref name=SA&gt;{{cite book|last=Graham|first=Patricia Albjerg|title=Schooling America|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|place=New York City, NY|isbn=978-0195315844|pp=68–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Late in his childhood, his family moved to [[Elkhart, Indiana]] where Washburne attended a traditional school. During his high school years, Washburne moved back to Chicago to live with his maternal grandfather and study at [[John Marshall Metropolitan High School]]. When his immediate family moved to [[Elgin, Illinois]], Washburne followed and finished his high school education there.&lt;ref name=Gazette&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meuer|first1=William|last2=Tubergen|first2=Jan|title=Carleton W. Washburne|publisher=''Winnetka Gazette''|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; He initially followed in the family footsteps and studied medicine at the [[University of Chicago]]. However, he found little interest in the material and transferred to [[Stanford University]] in [[California]], graduating in 1912.&lt;ref name=SA/&gt; Washburne married Heliuz Bigelow Chandler in the same year.&lt;ref name=Gazette/&gt;

==Career==
Washburne originally set out on a business venture, but was unsuccessful. Unable to otherwise support his family, he took a position as a teacher in low-income [[La Puente, California]]. Seeing the shortcomings of then-prevalent style of instruction, he combined the ideas of Dewey with his experiences at the Francis W. Parker school to create a [[progressive education]] curriculum. His work caught the attention of Frederic Burk, the president of the [[San Francisco State University|San Francisco State Teachers College]], who hired him to teach at the institution's affiliated elementary school. Washburne taught there for five years, serving as head of the science department.&lt;ref name="brit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/636285/Carleton-W-Washburne|title=Carleton W. Washburne|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there, he conducted research on preadolescence and studied at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], becoming one of the first recipients of a doctorate in education.&lt;ref name=SA/&gt;&lt;ref name=ChicagoReader&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/a-school-fit-for-children/Content?oid=877158 |title=A School Fit for Children |first=Grant |last=Pick |date=February 28, 1991 |newspaper=Chicago Reader}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burk heard of an opening for a superintendent for [[Winnetka School District 36]] in [[Winnetka, Illinois]], and recommended Washburne for the job. Washburne oversaw Winnetka schools from 1919 to 1943.&lt;ref name=SA/&gt;&lt;ref name=ChicagoReader/&gt; The district only had elementary schools, so Washburne was able to focus on that age group. It was here that he developed the Winnetka Plan, a system of individualized instruction in an ungraded setting.&lt;ref name = "Toronto" /&gt; The Winnetka Plan, based on the principles of progressive education, aimed to develop the "whole child"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winnetka36.org/sites/default/files/5/ProgressiveEducation2012.pdf |title=A History of Progressive Education |work=Progressive Education 2012 |publisher=The Winnetka Public Schools, District 36 |accessdate=5 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106040444/http://www.winnetka36.org/sites/default/files/5/ProgressiveEducation2012.pdf |archivedate=6 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and included physical, emotional, social, and intellectual education. The curriculum included both "common essentials" (reading, writing, number skills, history, and geography) and "creative group activities" such as art, music, literature, and physical education.&lt;ref name="Toronto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/legacy/research/edu20/moments/1919winnetka.html?cms_page=edu20/moments/1919winnetka.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130101091243/http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/legacy/research/edu20/moments/1919winnetka.html?cms_page=edu20/moments/1919winnetka.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1 January 2013 |title=1919: Winnetka Plan |work=History of Education: Selected Moments of the 20th Century |publisher=University of Toronto |accessdate=5 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Washburne collaborated with Francis W. Parker and the [[North Shore Country Day School]] to share faculty and curricula.&lt;ref name=SA/&gt; Among his other innovations in Winnetka, he instituted guidance programs in elementary schools, created middle schools, and promoted early childhood education. He served as chairman of the Winnetka Summer School for Teachers and the Winnetka Graduate Teachers College.&lt;ref name = "brit" /&gt;

Starting in 1928 Washburne led a study, in collaboration with [[University of Chicago]] graduate student Mabel Morphett, that attempted to determine the age when a child could reasonably be expected to learn to read. Examining first-grade students in Winnetka schools, they found that children with a [[mental age]] of 6.5 years could read successfully. Their findings were published in an education journal in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Elementary School Journal |volume=31 |issue= 7 |date=March 1931 |title= When Should Children Begin to Read? |first1=Mabel Vogel |last1=Morphett |first2=Carleton |last2=Washburne |jstor=995974 |pages=496–503 |doi=10.1086/456609}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ruddell&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Vinson|editor-first1=Kevin D.|editor-last2=Ross|editor-first2=E.

Washburne was one of the founding members of the [[John Dewey Society]] in 1935. He served as president of the [[Progressive Education Association]] and of the New Education Fellowship.&lt;ref name = "brit" /&gt; He oversaw the design and completion of the [[Crow Island School]] in 1940, which was heralded for its teaching concepts and unique architecture, and is now a [[National Historic Landmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=2078&amp;ResourceType=Building |title=Crow Island School |work=National Historic Landmarks program |accessdate=5 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103134222/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=2078&amp;ResourceType=Building |archivedate=3 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Washburne resigned from the Winnetka School District in 1943 to help the [[U.S. Army]] reopen educational facilities in occupied [[Italy]] during [[World War II]]. He remained there until 1949, playing an important role in reorganizing the Italian public school system.&lt;ref name = "brit" /&gt; He then accepted an offer to become the director of teacher education at [[Brooklyn College]]. In 1961, he joined the [[Michigan State University College of Education]] as a distinguished professor, where he taught for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=Gazette/&gt;

The '''Cowles Center for Dance and the Performing Arts''' (formerly the '''Minnesota Shubert Performing Arts and Education Center''') is a performing arts center and flagship for dance in downtown [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], United States. The Cowles Center was developed as an incubation project by [[Artspace Projects, Inc]] and includes the refurbished 500-seat '''Goodale Theater''' (formerly the '''Sam S. Shubert Theater'''); the [[Hennepin Center for the Arts]], home to 20 leading dance and performing arts organizations; a state-of-the-art education studio housing a distance learning program; and an atrium connecting the buildings. The Cowles Center is a catalyst for the creation, presentation and education of dance in the Twin Cities.

Both the Goodale Theater and the Hennepin Center for the Arts (formerly the Minneapolis Masonic Temple) are on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

The distance learning program began teaching students in 2002. Using IP [[videoconferencing]] technologies, it brings artists into classrooms throughout Minnesota, nationally and internationally, creating two-way interactive, real-time teaching environments.

==Original Samuel S. Shubert Theater==
{{Original research|section|date=April 2015}}
The Shubert Theatrical Company, run by brothers Levi, Samuel, and Jacob, entered the New York theater scene in 1900 and had become the largest theater owning and producing organization in America by 1920.

When Samuel Shubert died in a train wreck in 1905, his brothers memorialized him by naming a few of their new theaters after him. Two of these new theaters opened on the same day in 1910: [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]]’s Shubert Theater, which became the Fitzgerald Theater in 1994, and The Samuel S. Shubert Theater in Minneapolis, which reopened as The Cowles Center for Dance and the Performing Arts in September 2011, after a long and dramatic history.

The Samuel S. Shubert Theater was designed by William Albert Swasey (1864–1940).  For its time it was a mid-sized house, consisting of 1,500 seats with two shallow balconies. The front of the building had a Classical Revival façade featuring four pairs of bas-relief columns framing three arched windows at the second-story level. As with many of Swasey’s other buildings, the decorative elements of the façade were made of glazed terra cotta.

The opening show at Minneapolis’ new Samuel S. Shubert Theatre was ''The White Sister'' starring Viola Allen. Ticket prices ranged from $2.50 to 50 cents.

[[A. G. Bainbridge|Alexander G. “Buzz” Bainbridge]], a former press agent for Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show and general manager for a Chicago producer of touring shows, became the Shubert's manager in 1910, at the age of 25.

The Shubert had been conceived as a venue for touring Broadway shows, but those tours stopped in the summer, leaving the theater empty, so, the Shuberts tasked Bainbridge with creating a resident acting ensemble. The Bainbridge Players became a popular year-round attraction. Several of its actors, such as Victory Jory, Gladys George, and Johnny Dilson, went on to successful film careers.

In 1915, The Shubert began to play movies, accompanied by a 40-piece pit orchestra. In 1918 the flu epidemic closed all Minneapolis theaters. The Shubert remodeled; new lights were installed, the orchestra pit was expanded, and the theater was repainted.

Throughout the 1920s the prevalence and popularity of films began to push out live theater. While the Shubert held on until 1933, it could not withstand the changing of the tides. Bainbridge disbanded his company, and became mayor of Minneapolis from 1933 to 1935.&lt;ref&gt;The Many Lives of the Schubert Theater&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Alvin==
{{Original research|section|date=April 2015}}
The Shubert came back to life as “The Alvin” in 1935, named after its new owner William Alvin Steffes. Steffes added an [[Art Deco]] marquee and split the stage time between movies and touring Broadway shows until December 1940, when the theater went under for two months before reincarnating as a burlesque theater.

Despite a fire on July 6, 1941, which necessitated a five-month-long renovation, The Alvin theater kept its doors open as a burlesque theater until 1953. Some of the best known strip-tease artists of the day including Tempest Storm, Candy Barr, and Gypsy Rose Lee performed there. A typical burlesque show offered not only titillation, but entertainment by jugglers, comedians, and variety acts. One of the most noteworthy of these performers was Dudley Riggs, a comedian juggler who went on to found Brave New Workshop, now housed only a few blocks from The Cowles Center.

In November 1953, the Alvin underwent yet another change when the Reverend Russell H. Olson turned the building into the Minneapolis Evangelistic Auditorium. The church closed only three years later.

==The Academy==

The Shubert came back in 1957 when Ted Mann bought it, converted it into a movie theater, and renamed it The Academy. On July 12, 1957, The Academy hosted the Minneapolis premiere of Minnesota native Michael Todd's ''Around the World in Eighty Days''. Todd, who used to be a candy vendor in the old Shubert Theater, attended the opening with his wife, Elizabeth Taylor.

The Academy began to struggle as suburban multiplexes replaced single-screen houses, and 1983 brought yet another closing of the theater's doors.

==Closed doors and new projects==
{{Original research|section|date=April 2015}}
In 1987, 25% of reported crimes in downtown Minneapolis were committed on Block E, where the Shubert was located. In an effort to combat the increasing crime, the Minneapolis City Council approved guidelines for a redevelopment project. However, the project brought The Shubert under threat of the wrecking ball.

Block E was razed in 1988 and 1989 except for the Shubert. In 1990, the Heritage Preservation Commission convinced city officials not to demolish the Shubert unless it proved prohibitively expensive to develop Block E with the theater in place. Save Our Shubert wrote letters to editors and held candlelight vigils outside the theater. The Shubert was added to the National Register of Historic places in 1996, leaving Brookfield Development to find a way to incorporate the Shubert into their Block E proposal.

Artspace Vice President Tom Nordyke had the idea to move the Shubert out of the way, solving the issue in a way that benefited preservationists, developers, and the arts community. Bakke Kopp Ballou and McFarlin Inc of Minneapolis concluded that the option of moving a 6-million-pound building a few blocks was, in fact, feasible.

It took twelve days to move the theater from Block E to its new Hennepin Avenue location in February 1999. At 5.8 million pounds, it was the heaviest building ever moved on rubber tires, and holds a Guinness World Record for this accomplishment.

The Shubert was too large to be moved on city streets, but the only things between it and its new home were parking lots. Renovation of the building at its new location created The Cowles Center for the Performing Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.youngassociates.net/downloads/client-references/ref-Artspace-1998.pdf | title=Artspace | date=November 2, 1998 | accessdate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goodale Theater==
[[Image:Minnesota Shubert-Groundbreaker Battle-20081004.JPG|thumb|right|Watching ''Groundbreaker Battle 2008'' at Minnesota Shubert's month-long ''Hip-Hop Dance: From the Street to the State''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Traudes, Cristof|title=Shubert goes hip-hop for month-long event|url=http://www.downtownjournal.com/index.php?&amp;story=12430&amp;page=65&amp;category=86|date=September 23, 2008|work=Downtown Journal|publisher=Minnesota Premier Publications|accessdate=2008-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The refurbished Goodale Theater with 505 seats (216 orchestra level, 289 Grand Tier level) offer guests intimate, unobstructed views of the entire stage with no seat further than 65 feet from center stage. Each row of seats arcs semi-circularly to face center stage.

Ornate columns of cherrywood and historic architectural details frame the proscenium arch. Floors throughout the backstage area are covered with a special linoleum that allows ballet performers to walk from dressing rooms to the stage without removing their toe shoes. The spacious backstage spaces and dressing rooms allow maximum flexible space to support a wide variety of companies and performance needs. The orchestra pit accommodates up to 42 musicians and adds the dimension of live orchestral music. The orchestra pit can also be adjusted to add two additional rows of seating in the house. The stage is large enough to provide choreographers with ample space in the wings to perform large-scale productions. The stage also includes a full-size stage house with 52 riggings that can support extensive and elaborate set designs.

==U.S. Bank Atrium==

The main entrance to The Cowles Center houses the box office and information desk, concession space, donor wall, and entrances to the Goodale Theater and The Hennepin Center for the Arts.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Glass Sculpture Cowles.jpg|thumb|right|Rites of Spring in Glass]] --&gt;
A [[Labanotation]] wall art piece inspired by Rites of Spring hangs above the concession area. Developed by dance artist and theorist Rudolf Laban (1878–1958), Labanotation is a way of writing down dance which is analogous to the way music notation is a way of writing down music. Labanotation uses symbols to represent points on a dancer's body, the direction of the dancer's movements, the tempo, and the dynamics.

==Target Education Studio==

The studio was designed specifically for dance with a sprung maple floor, studio lighting and a wall of mirrors. It houses the center's long distance learning program. Using video conferencing technology, the center brings artists into classrooms to create two-way, interactive, real-time teaching environments. Thanks to generous funding, the center is also able to provide free sessions to Minnesota schools.

==Inaugural season==

The Cowles Center inaugural season spanned the fall of 2011 and the spring of 2012 and brought a variety of Minnesota dance companies to the same venue. Dance companies which performed in the 2011–12 season included:
* Ragamala Dance
* [[Minnesota Dance Theatre]]
* Beyond Ballroom Dance Company
* Black Label Movement
* Zorongo Flamenco
* Native Pride Dancers
* [[James Sewell Ballet]]
* Matthew Janczewski's Arena Dance
* Stuart Pimsler Dance and Theater
* Katha Dance Theater
* Shapiro and Smith Dance Company
* Zenon Dance Company
* Breaking Boundaries Dance Company
* Tu Dance

The inaugural season also included [[Cantus (vocal ensemble)|Cantus]], and a performance by New York-based dancers Kegwin + Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/collections/special/columns/state-of-the-arts/archive/2011/05/cowles-center-announces-inaugural-season.shtml|title=Cowles Center announces inaugural season|author=Marianne Combs|work=State of the Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3557">The '''Davis Waldorf School''' is a [[Waldorf education|Waldorf school]] located in [[Davis, California]], United States. It was founded in 1986 by a group of parents who wanted a [[Waldorf education]] for their children. The school offers classes and programs serving 205 students in preschool through eighth grade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=WDDB&amp;p_theme=wddb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=1086245FAFAA386E&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM Waldorf School Offers New Program], ''The Daily Democrat'', February 19, 2005. Accessed 2008-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://daviswaldorf.org/about.html Davis Waldorf School: About Us]. Accessed 2008-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site and buildings==
In the fall of 1992, the school was able to move from its first rural site to its current campus in [[Davis, California|North Davis]]. The new classroom buildings were designed to support the principles of Waldorf education and include many environmentally sound features such as rammed-earth walls formed of native [[California]] clays, natural [[cork (material)|cork]] flooring, natural lighting, passive solar and radiant heating and the use of plant-based paint where possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SB&amp;p_theme=sb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB0D9E4AF97B72A&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM A Stonehenge For Students: Rammed Earth Walls Link New Davis School With Nature], ''The Sacramento Bee'', June 21, 1992. Accessed 2008-04-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2010, the school added several new buildings. A two classroom [[kindergarten]] building, a multi-purpose building, and a new office building. The buildings are prefabricated purpose built buildings, rather than the 'portables' that are in use in many schools in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacbee.com/2010/10/07/3085805/zeta-communities-to-build-green.html Zeta Communities to Build Green School Buildings]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curriculum and activities==
The school follows a typical [[Curriculum of the Waldorf schools|curriculum]] for Waldorf schools in California. Due to the agricultural nature of the Davis area, and the number of [[organic farms]] in the area, gardening and field trips to work on farms are a natural program. Davis Waldorf students raised money to start a kindergarten in [[Tanzania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ucdavismagazine.ucdavis.edu/issues/sp06/feature_3.html Camp Davis, Tanzania], ''UC Davis Magazine'', Spring 2006. Accessed 2008-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://visibleworld.net/development.html VisibleWorld.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

The school has a music program, that includes workshops for the broader community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacbee.com/122/story/1143811.html Davis workshop focuses on fine art of fiddling]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classes==
The schedule of classes is different every day of the week, and the schedule repeats each week. Because of the small number of students in each class, all students share all their classes with all the other children in their grade, with the exception of the different levels of Spanish, Algebra, and Orchestra/Band.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4296">'''Deschooling''', a term rooted in the beliefs of Ivan Illich, is the shift from a traditional, government-influenced institution of schooling to a less-restricted method of learning that focuses on being educated by one's natural curiosities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/deschooling|title=deschooling {{!}} Definition of deschooling in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Deschooling is mainly accredited to [[Ivan Illich]], who felt that the traditional schooling children received needed to be reconstructed&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.davidtinapple.com/illich/1970_deschooling.html|title=DESCHOOLING SOCIETY|last=|first=|date=|website=David Tinapple|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He believed that schools contained a "hidden curriculum" that caused learning to align with grades and accreditation rather than important skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weston|first=Anthony|date=1996-01-01|title=Deschooling Environmental Education|url=https://cjee.lakeheadu.ca/article/view/491|journal=Canadian Journal of Environmental Education (CJEE)|language=en-US|volume=1|issue=1|pages=35–46|issn=1205-5352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illich believed that the modern school is grounded on a foundation that is focused on growing schools as an industrialized system. Rather than focusing on the needs of the children, it is more heavily focused on the aggrandizement of the school system&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Illich communicated that the school system has formed a toxic industry that specializes in what families should be capable of forming themselves, namely education. According to Illich, schools align success on paper with academic excellence. He presumed that schools, grades, and diplomas gave false assumptions that the students have become knowledgeable in a certain educational concept. 

[[John Holt (educator)|John Holt]] was another thinker who believed in deschooling. His thoughts were closely aligned with Illich because neither were convinced that school was the place that taught students everything they needed to know&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Instead, they communicated that school was not the sole avenue for learning because students learn consistently through other facets, such as exposure to the natural world&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. As a result, Illich and Holt saw schools as being insufficient because of their focus on strictly doing "skill drill" instead of other methods of learning&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Additionally,  theorist of deschooling saw education as maintaining the social order&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zaldívar|first=Jon|date=March 2016|title=Social Imaginaries and Deschooling|url=https://rd.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-981-287-532-7_384-1|journal=Encyclopedia of Educational Philosophy and Theory|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Therefore, they wanted to "denounce the monopoly that traditional education institutions held on education and learning."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;   

==Deschooling society==
"Deschooling" a person does not mean disregarding the act of learning or studying in schools. Illich and Holt's image of a deschooling society would ensure that everybody has his or her own decision as to whether or not they go to school. Rather than being forced to go to school, taking a test before entering a school, being denied the opportunity to learn a desired topic, people would be free to choose how they learn.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to John Holt, an advocate for deschooling, "a deschooled society would be a society in which everyone shall have the widest and freest possible choice to learn whatever he wants to learn, whether in school or in some altogether different way."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Routray|first=Sailen|date=2012|title=‘Deschooling Society’|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/097318491100900105?journalCode=ceda|journal=Contemporary Education Dialogue|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=85–104|doi=10.1177/097318491100900105|issn=0973-1849|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Economic Warfare School''' (EGE in French) is a French academic curriculum dedicated to [[competitive intelligence]].

== History ==
The Economic Warfare School was created in October 1997 by General Officer Jean Pichot-Duclos, former head of the [[French Army]] Intelligence Training Centre and Christian Harbulot Chief Operating Officer for [[competitive intelligence]] at [[Défense conseil international|DCI group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberation.fr/economie/1997/05/08/-_206297|title=La guerre économique, un art qui s'enseigne|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Economic Warfare School offers [[Master of Business Administration|MBA program]] specialized in [[Competitive intelligence]] and [[Strategy]] for students who have graduated from prestigious schools and universities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4417">'''The Estonian Academy of Music and Theatre''' (''Eesti Muusika- ja Teatriakadeemia'') began as a mixed choir of the [[Estonia]] Society Musical Department (EMD) on the eve of [[World War I]]. The assembly of the Estonia Society created the [[Tallinn]] Higher Music School on November 17, 1918. The opening ceremony took place on September 28, 1919. In 1923 the educational institution was renamed the [[Tallinn]] [[Conservatoire]].  In 1938 the State Drama School was opened. In 1993 the school was renamed the “Estonian Academy of Music”. In 1995 the Drama Faculty was renamed the Higher Theatre School.

Some prominent graduates of the Estonian Academy of Music include singers [[Aile Asszonyi]], [[Heli Lääts]], and [[Ain Anger]], conductors [[Roman Matsov]], [[Tõnu Kaljuste]], [[Olari Elts]], [[Eri Klas]], and [[Kristiina Poska]], composers [[Arvo Pärt]], [[Lepo Sumera]], [[Erkki-Sven Tüür]] and [[Ardo Ran Varres]], director [[Andres Puustusmaa]], and actors [[Tõnu Aav]], [[Heino Mandri]], [[Elmo Nüganen]], [[Ain Lutsepp]], [[Margus Oopkaup]], [[Jan Uuspõld]] and [[Taavi Eelmaa]].

The Tallinn Higher Music School was the predecessor of the current EAMT, with the opening ceremony taking place on September 28, 1919, in the Estonia Concert Hall. From 1919–1923 the Principal of the school was Mihkel Lüdig.

In 1923 it was renamed to Tallinn Conservatoire. The academic level of the Conservatoire can be considered to have been relatively high, as many of its students participated in international competitions in the 1930s. The most successful of them was Tiit Kuusik, who was awarded the first prize at the International Singing Competition in Vienna in 1938.

The Conservatoire became nationalised in 1935. In 1938 the State Drama School was opened.

Following the arrival of German occupation powers, the Conservatoire struggled to restore its earlier teaching activities. During the March 9, 1944 air raid, the building of the Conservatoire, as well as most of its equipment, was almost completely destroyed. In November 1944, following another change of power, the Conservatoire was reopened.

The Conservatoire’s creative environment began to see revival in the mid-1950s. In 1957 the Drama Faculty was established at the Conservatoire, with Voldemar Panso becoming its first head. 

In 1989, its former name – the “Tallinn Conservatoire” – was restored. Four years later the school was renamed the “Estonian Academy of Music” (Eesti Muusikaakadeemia).

In 1992 an extensive reform of the study structure was introduced and the school adopted a subject-based study system. Degree studies were introduced enabling students of the four-year program would receive a bachelor’s degree. In 1993, a two-year master´s degree program was added. In 1996 a four-year doctoral program in musicology was introduced, whereas in 2000 specific curricula were designed for performers and composers.  In 2006 a new program for dramatic art was added, which also has a creative emphasis.

Since 1999 the Estonian Academy of Music is based in a building located in the center of Tallinn. 

Since 2002, it offers a Joint MA in Cultural Management in collaboration with the [[Estonian Academy of Arts]] and [[Estonian Business School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ema.edu.ee/en/departments/cultural-management-and-humanities/|title=Cultural Management and Humanities {{!}} Eesti Muusika- ja Teatriakadeemia|website=www.ema.edu.ee|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The present name of the academy – Estonian Academy of Music and Theatre – was adopted in 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13992">'''Antonio di Pietro Averlino''' ({{IPA-it|anˈtɔːnjo di ˈpjɛːtro averˈliːno}}; c. 1400 – c. 1469), also "Averulino", known as '''''Filarete''''' ({{IPA-it|filaˈrɛːte}}; from {{lang-el|φιλάρετος}}, meaning "lover of excellence"), was a [[Florentine Renaissance]] [[architect]], [[sculpture|sculptor]], [[medallist]], and architectural theorist. He is perhaps best remembered for his design of the ideal city of [[Sforzinda]], the first ideal city plan of the Renaissance.

==Biography==
Antonio di Pietro Averlino was born c. 1400 in [[Florence]] where he probably trained as a craftsman. Sources suggest that he worked in Florence under the Italian painter, architect, and biographer [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]], who gave him his more famous name “Filarete” which means “a lover of virtue”. In the mid 15th century, Filarete was expelled from [[Rome]] after being accused of attempting to steal the head of [[John the Baptist]] and he moved to [[Venice]] and then eventually to [[Milan]]. There he became a ducal engineer and worked on a variety of architectural projects for the next fifteen years. According to his biographer, [[Vasari]], Filarete died in Rome c. 1469.&lt;ref&gt;'Il Filarete.' ''International Dictionary of Architects and Architecture.'' St. James Press, 1993.

Forrer|volume=Volume VII|year=1923|pages=302–304}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Bronze doors of Old St. Peter's Basilica===
A commission granted by [[Pope Eugene IV]] meant that Filarete, over the course of twelve years, cast the [[bronze]] central doors for [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]], which were completed in 1445.&lt;ref&gt;Ghiberti's great bronze doors for the [[Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence)|Baptistery of Florence]] preceded this. In the following century, Filarete's doors were preserved when Old St Peter's was demolished and they were later reinstalled in the new [[St. Peter's Basilica]].&lt;/ref&gt; Although they were created during the Renaissance, the doors have distinct Byzantine influences and seem tied to the Medieval era. Some critics have noted that the doors offer a glimpse into the mind of Filarete, claiming that they show his “mind of medieval complexity crammed full of exciting but not quite assimilated classical learning”.&lt;ref&gt;Roeder, Helen. 'The Borders of Filarete's Bronze Doors to St. Peters'. ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'', Vol. 10, (1947), pp. 150-153.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architectural works===
[[Image:Milano Castello 1.jpg|150pz|thumb|Milan]][[Image:Idealstadt.jpg|thumb|Filarete: ''Sforzinda'']]
In Milan Filarete built the [[Ospedale Maggiore]] (c. 1456), the overall form of which was rationally planned as a cross within a square, with the hospital church at the center of the plan. Some of the surviving sections of the much-rebuilt structure show the Gothic detail of Milan's ''[[quattrocento]]'' craft traditions, which are at odds with Filarete's design ''all'antica'' or "after the Antique".&lt;ref&gt;Murray 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; Filarete also worked on the [[Castello Sforzesco]] or Sforza Castle and on the [[Duomo di Milano]] or Milan Cathedral.

===Filarete's treatise on architecture and the ideal city of Sforzinda===
Filarete completed his substantial book on architecture sometime around 1464, which he referred to as his ''Libro architettonico'' ("Architectonic book").  Neither he nor his immediate contemporaries ever referred to it as a ''Trattato'' ("Treatise"), though it is usually now called such.  The ''Libro'', which comprises twenty-five volumes, enjoyed a fairly wide circulation in manuscript form during the Renaissance. The most well known and best preserved copy of the ''Libro'' is a profusely illustrated manuscript known as the ''Codex Magliabechiano'' (probably drafted c. 1465; now held in the archives of the [http://www.bncf.firenze.sbn.it Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Firenze]). The fact that the ''Codex Magliabechiano'' is dedicated to [[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici|Piero de' Medici]] and was conserved in Florence suggests that Filarete was well regarded in his native Florence despite his loyalty to Milan. The book, which is written as a fictional narrative, consists principally of a detailed account of the technical aspects of architecture (e.g., site and material selection, drawing, construction methods, and so on) and a sustained polemic against the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]] of Northern Italy, which Filarete calls the "barbarous modern style." Filarete argues instead for the use of [[Romanesque architecture|classical Roman]] models.

The most famous part of his book is his plan for Sforzinda, an [[ideal city]] named after [[Francesco Sforza]], then Duke of Milan.  Although Sforzinda was never built, certain aspects of its design are described in considerable detail. The basic layout of the city is an eight-point star, created by overlaying two squares so that all the corners were equidistant. This shape is then inscribed within a perfect circular moat. This shape is iconographic and probably ties to Filarete’s interest in magic and astrology.&lt;ref&gt;Kostof, Spiro. ''The City Shaped: Urban Patterns and Meanings.'' London: Thames and Hudson Ltd. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with ''Quattrocento'' or fifteenth century notions concerning the talismanic power of geometry and the crucial importance of astrology, Filarete provides, in addition to pragmatic advice on materials, construction, and fortifications, notes on how to propitiate celestial harmony within Sforzinda. His architectonical drawings and even more his allegorical drawings traced on the margins of the Codex Magliabechianus - such as the Allegory of Vertue and the Allegory of the Reason and Will - Filarete shows a remarkable possession of classical sources, maybe known also through the advice of his friend Francesco Filelfo da Tolentino, the main humanist then at the court of Milan.&lt;ref&gt;P. Coen, "La allegoria della Virtù di Antonio Averlino, detto il Filarete" in Le due Rome del Quattrocento, ed. S. Rossi and S. Valeri, Rome, 1994; P. Coen, Il problema della Ragione e della Volontà: il contributo di un'allegoria di Antonio Averlino, detto il Filarete", in Arte Lombarda, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of planning, each of the outer points of the star had towers, while the inner angles had gates. Each of the gates was an outlet of radial avenues that each passed through a market square, dedicated to certain goods. All the avenues finally converged in a large square which was centrally located. The town contained three squares – one for the prince’s palace, one for the cathedral, and one for the market. Because the Renaissance was much taken with the idea of the canal town, in Filarete's Sforzinda every other street had a canal for cargo transport.&lt;ref&gt;Kostof, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; The canal system also connected with the river, and thus the outside world, for the import and export of goods. The city also contained many buildings, including parishes and separate schools for boys and girls. An example of a building that appears in the treatise is Filarete’s House of Vice and Virtue, a ten-storey structure with a brothel on the bottom and an academy of learning on the higher levels. Filarete did much study on representation of Vices and Virtues, and there are suggestions that his radial design for the city was inspired by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]’s Earthly City, whose circular shape was divided into sections, each of which had its own Vice and Virtue.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, S. 'The Ideal City from Plato to Howard', ''Architectural Review'' 112. Aug. 1952, pp 95-96&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of Sforzinda may have been in part a direct response to the Italian cities of the Medieval period, whose growth did not necessarily depend on city planning as such, which meant they could be difficult to navigate.&lt;ref&gt;Madanipour, Ali. ''Designing the City of Reason: Foundation and Frameworks.'' New York: Routledge, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In part, the Renaissance humanist interest in classical texts may have stimulated preoccupations with geometry in city layouts, as for example, in [[Plato]]'s description of [[Atlantis]]. Filarete’s ideal plan was meant to reflect on society – where a perfect city form would be the image of a perfect society, an idea that was typical of the humanist views prevalent during the High Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Kostof, 1991, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; The Renaissance ideal city implied the centralized power of a prince in its organization, an idea following closely on the heels of [[Dante]]’s that “The human race is at its best under a monarch.”&lt;ref&gt;Alighieri, Dante. ''De Monarchia'', c. 1312&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it could be argued that the Renaissance ideal city form was tensioned between the perceived need for a centralized power and the potential reality of tyranny.

==Influence on architecture and urbanism==
Filarete's plan of Sforzinda was the first ideal city plan of the Renaissance and his thorough organization of its layout embodied a greater level of conscious city planning than anyone before him. Despite the many references to medieval symbolism incorporated into Sforzinda's design, the city's principles became the archetype for the humanist city during the High Renaissance. The treatise gained interest from many important leaders such as Giangaleazzo Sforza and [[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici|Piero de' Medici]] and later when [[Francesco di Giorgio]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] began to plan their ideal cities they borrowed ideas from Filarete.&lt;ref&gt;"Il Filarete." ''International Dictionary of Architects and Architecture.'' St. James Press, 1993. Reproduced in Biography Resource Center. Farmington Hills, Mich.: Gale, 2009. http://0-galenet.galegroup.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/servlet/BioRC{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it was never built, Sforzinda served as an inspiration for many future city plans. For example, in the 16th century, Renaissance military engineers and architects combined Filarete's ideal city schemes with defensive fortifications deriving from a more sociopolitical agenda. This notion of combining the ideal and the fortified city became widely disseminated throughout Europe and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Kostof, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fle3''' is a [[World Wide Web|Web]]-based learning environment or [[virtual learning environment]]. More precisely Fle3 is [[Server (computing)|server]] [[software]] for [[Computer Supported Collaborative Learning|computer supported collaborative learning]] (CSCL).

Fle3 is designed to support learner and group centered work that concentrates on creating and developing expressions of knowledge (i.e. knowledge artefacts). Fle3 supports study groups to implement [[knowledge building]], [[creative problem solving]] and [[scientific method]] in an inquiry learning process, for example the&amp;nbsp;[[progressive inquiry]] method.

Fle3 user interface is translated to more than 20 languages including most of the European languages and Chinese. Fle3 is used in more than 70 countries.

Fle3 is a [[Zope]] product, written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]]. Fle3 is [[open-source software|open-source]] and [[free software]] released under the [[GNU General Public Licence]] (GPL).

==Origin of the name==

The abbreviation FLE comes from the words '''F'''uture '''L'''earning '''E'''nvironment. The number 3 in the name refers to the number of times the software has been built from scratch.

When Fle3 was released in 2002 the developers were claiming that the name comes from "'''F'''le3 is a '''L'''earning '''E'''nvironment", with intertextual reference to the name [[GNU]] ('''G'''NU is '''N'''ot '''U'''nix).

==Components==

Fle3 provides various tab-accessed screens &lt;ref&gt;http://fle3.uiah.fi/papers/fle3_guide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; affording functionality considered important for [[progressive inquiry]].

'''Fle3 WebTops''' the interface that scaffolds students' storing, organizing and sharing their own knowledge resources including documents, files, links and notes.

'''Fle3 Knowledge Building''' the interface that scaffolds students' knowledge building (and associated) discourse. Knowledge Building tool provides Knowledge Types to scaffold and structure the process.

'''Fle3 Jamming tool''' is the interface that scaffolds members of a group to collaboratively construct and improve digital artifacts such as pictures, text, audio and videos. Key features of this include the ability of a user to upload the artifact, assign sharing permission and finally the graphical representation of the versioning history of the artifact.

There are also interfaces that scaffold teachers and administrators to manage users and analyze student/project activity.

==Knowledge type sets==
An important feature of the Knowledge Building tool is the knowledge type sets that are scaffolding and structuring the discussions. For instance, for a progressive inquiry learning teachers may use knowledge type set designed for this purpose. Progressive Inquiry knowledge type set contains the following five knowledge types:  ''Problem'', ''My Explanation'', ''Scientific Explanation'', ''Evaluation of the Process'' and ''Summary''. Every time a pupil is posting something to the discussion, she must choose what knowledge type her note represents.

The knowledge types guides pupils to think adequate and important things related to the process, and this way helps them to write more substantial notes to the discussion forum. As an aid for users to follow the knowledge building discourse, users may take different views to the knowledge building discussion by sorting the notes as a discussion thread, by writer, by knowledge type, or by date.

The Knowledge Building tool contains two default knowledge type sets: (1) Progressive Inquiry, and (2) Design Thinking. Depending on the selected knowledge types set, users get guidelines and a checklist on how to write their notes to the discussion forum. Each knowledge type is also color-coded making them fast to recognize and learn.

==History==
Development of Fle3 software was started in 1998 in a Future Learning Environment (https://archive.is/20130213114740/http://fle.uiah.fi/) research and development project in [[Media Lab Helsinki|Media Lab]], Helsinki, Finland. Fle3 software is based on the Future Learning Environment concept promoting learning process, which differs from traditional teacher and didactic-based teaching by emphasising students active role in a learning process.

The objective was to study alternative approaches of using information and communication technologies (ICT) in teaching and learning, and to design alternative learning practices and tools. At that time, the strong e-learning movement was seen to promote rather naïve conception of human learning. The acquisition metaphor of learning, which emphasizes learning as a process where students are supplied with pieces of knowledge (Sfard 1998), was getting stronger.

The researchers of the FLE project brought to the discussion more advanced conceptions of learning, such as participation metaphor (Sfard 1998) and knowledge creation metaphor (Paavola et al. 2002). However, the objective of the FLE project was not only to bring new theoretical approaches to the discussion, but also to design learning practices and technology based on the theories. The results of this work culminated in the progressive inquiry learning model (Hakkarainen et al. 2001; Muukkonen et al. 1999; 2005) and in the Fle3 software (http://fle3.uiah.fi).

The [[history of virtual learning environments]] shows how the e-learning and Learning Management Systems (LMS), with course-centred outlook and focus on delivery of learning content, was, and is probably still, the mainstream approach to use of ICT in education. Although in mid-2000 the growing popularity of [[blogs]] and [[wikis]] and the consideration how they could be used in teaching and learning has led the mainstream research and development community of virtual learning to re-consider the existing e-learning paradigms.

===Fle-Tools (1998–1999)===
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Fle-tools-webtop.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Fle-Tools (1999) Webtop.]]  --&gt;

In the late 1990s the research, development and design team members of the first FLE project were greatly influenced by the work of [[Carl Bereiter]] and [[Marlene Scardamalia]], and their concept of [[Knowledge building]]. In the design of FLE software, Bereiter's and Scardamalia's Computer-Supported Intentional Learning Environment (CSILE) was used as a reference.

However, there are also many differences between the two software. For instance, already in the early design specifications of FLE there was the idea of shared artefacts that are collaboratively constructed alongside the knowledge building activities. In FLE vocabulary the activity, and the tool supporting it, is called “jamming”. Also the idea of archiving the results of the study work and to make them then available for other study groups makes FLE very different from the CSILE, which was primary designed to be a system used in a classroom. Another difference is related to the Web. From the very beginning FLE has been web-based system, and has taken in use all the advantages the flexible platform is offering, whereas the original CSILE was a client-server system.

The first prototype server with FLE software was set up in 1998 and announced in early 1999. The software was named to be Fle-Tools. The software was designed in [[Media Lab Helsinki|Media Lab]] in Helsinki but programmed by a Finnish company called NSD Consulting Oy.

Fle-Tools was developed in a Future Learning Environment project funded by [[Tekes (agency)|Tekes]] - the National Technology Agency of Finland. The project partners were [[Media Lab Helsinki|Media Lab]] of the [[University of Art and Design Helsinki]] (coordinator), [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/networkedlearning Centre for Research on Networked Learning and Knowledge Building] in the Department of Psychology of the [[University of Helsinki]], Finnish Ministry of Education, Finnish new media company Grey Interactive, Finnish teleoperator [[Sonera]], and Finnish educational publisher [[SanomaWSOY]].

Fle-Tools was described to be: (1) www-based service for computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL); (2) on-line learning community and teamwork environment; (3) collection of server-based applications and databases and (4) cross-platform for end users (www-browser in Linux, Mac, Win PC, WebTV, Nokia Communicator, etc.). The tools of Fle3-Tools were:

* WebTop: Personal open desk top in the web to store and share digital materials;
* Knowledge Building: Asynchronous conferencing system with 'Categories of Inquiry' and different searching capabilities (by date, person, category of inquiry, users own notes, answers to own notes);
* Jam Session: Asynchronous multi-user environment for collaborative design, writing, software development, etc.;
* Library: Adaptive medium to publish and browse multimedia course materials
* Administration: Tools for administer users, groups, courses and course materials.

In 1999 Fle-Tools was tested in several university course at the University of Helsinki and the University of Art and Design Helsinki. The results form the pilots were published in scientific conferences and journals.

In the end of 1999, The Finnish operator [[Sonera]], who was a key partner in the Future Learning Environment project, decided to draw back from the project and started to develop their own product based on Fle-Tools. This resulted as a breakdown of the original Future Learning Environment research and development project.

===Fle2 (1999–2001)===
[[File:Fle2-KB-ansering-note.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Fle2 (2001) Knowledge Building - Add note view.]] The next generation FLE software was developed during the years 1999–2001. Because of the collapse of the original Future Learning Environment project consortium in 1999 the research and design partners felt that they must continue the FLE development on their own.

In 2000 the Fle2 project got funding from the Nordic Council of Ministers NordUnet 2 program. The partners of the project were Media Lab in Helsinki, Department of Communication, Journalism and Computer Science of Roskilde University in Denmark, and Department of Psychology of the University of Helsinki.

The new software was named Fle2 and released online for free downloading in April 2001. Fle2 was based on the design of Fle-Tools, but this time the software development and programming was carried-out in Media Lab Helsinki. The Fle2 was built on top of the [[BSCW|BSCW - Basic Support for Cooperative Work]] software developed by the [[Fraunhofer Society]] in Germany.

The tools of Fle2 were personal WebTops and Knowledge Building. Th Fle2 did not have Jam Session or Library tools of the earlier Fle-Tools. In the Fle2 WebTop there were two new features compared to the earlier Fle-Tools: (1) "yellow notes" made it possible to add notes to other people WebTops when visiting them, and (2) chat with whiteboard for chating and drawing with other users online.

In 2002 the design and development team in Helsinki realized that BSCW was not the right  platform for developing the FLE software. The main reason for giving up the development of Fle2 on top of the BSCW was the fact that BSCW was not an Open Source / Free Software.

===Fle3 (2002–2006)===

[[File:Fle3-jamming.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Fle3 (2001) Jamming tool.]]
Fle3 is the third and the latest version of FLE software. The first version of Fle3 was released on February 15, 2002. The latest version 1.5 was released in April 2005.

Fle3 was largely developed in the Innovative Technology for Collaborative Learning and Knowledge Building (ITCOLE) project, funded by the [[European Commission]] in the Information Society Technologies (IST) framework's 'School of Tomorrow' program.

The ITCOLE project was coordinated by the Media Lab in Helsinki. The technical development partners included the developers of [[BSCW|BSCW&amp;nbsp;– Basic Support for Cooperative Work]] in [[Fraunhofer Society]] and Department of Computer Science of the University of Murcia in Spain. Testing of different software in schools was coordinated by Helsinki City Education Department and pedagogical research was carried out by researcher from University of Helsinki, University of Amsterdam, University of Salerno, University of Rome La Sapienza, University of Athens and University of Utrecht.

In the ITCOLE project there were several parallel software development projects. At first Fle3 was developed in Media Lab in Helsinki as a user interface and interaction demonstration for the main software development taking place in Fraunhofer and based on their BSCW system. The University of Murcia's main task was to develop the synchronous communications tools, which were then integrated experimentally to BSCW and Fle3. The software based on BSCW was named at first Synergeia and later BSCL (Basic Support for Collaborative Learning).

During the course of the project Fle3 was found user friendly, accessible, and technically reliable for a wider use. This way it ended up to be not only a UI and interaction prototype but also software of its own. Finally Fle3 became one of the main results of the ITCOLE project.

There has been no noticeable development in the Fle3 project since 2006.

===Fle4 (2009–2015)===

The core component of FLE3, the scaffolded knowledge-building discussion board, was re-created as a [https://wordpress.org/plugins/knowledge-building/ simple plugin] in WordPress, the ubiquitous open source web server system. FLE4 was not intended to be a new system, but instead a re-implementation of the most important element of the previous system in a very user-friendly technology. Two sets of scaffolds are available in FLE4: Knowledge Building with its 5 knowledge types and de Bono's Six Hat Thinking with its 6 knowledge types.

In 2013, a map view was added, providing an automatically generated 2D view of the discussion in which users can both view and post. While FLE4 is not under active development (2015), occasional updates and bug fixes are released.

In 2008, [[Forbes|Forbes.com]] began publishing an annual list of "America's Best Colleges".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = America's Top Colleges|publisher = Forbes|url = https://www.forbes.com/top-colleges/|accessdate = October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Post-graduate success''' (self-reported salaries of alumni from [[PayScale]], and data from the federal Department of Education) constitutes 35% of the score. '''Student debt loads''' constitute 20% of the score. '''Student experience''' (retention rates reported by the Department of Education, and data from [[Niche (company)|Niche]]) constitutes 20% of the score. '''Graduation rates''' constitute 12.5% of the score. '''Academic success''' (using both the percentage of a school's student body that goes on to obtain doctorate degrees, and those students who have won one of a diverse array of prestigious academic awards) constitutes 12.5%. Public [[reputation]] is not considered, which causes some colleges to score lower than in other lists. A three-year [[moving average]] is used to smooth out the scoring.

Starting in 2013, four schools that had admitted to misreporting admissions data were removed from the list for two years. The four removed colleges were [[Bucknell University]], [[Claremont McKenna College]], [[Emory University]], and [[Iona College (New York)|Iona College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Inside Higher Ed]] |url=http://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2013/07/25/forbes-boots-4-colleges-its-rankings |title='Forbes' Boots 4 Colleges From Its Rankings |date=July 25, 2013 |accessdate=May 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10407">The '''Getty Vocabulary Program''' is a department within the [[Getty Research Institute]] at the [[Getty Center]] in [[Los Angeles, California]]. It produces and maintains the Getty [[controlled vocabulary]] databases, [[Art and Architecture Thesaurus]], [[Union List of Artist Names]], and [[Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names]]. They are compliant with ISO and NISO standards for thesaurus construction. The Getty vocabularies are the premiere references for categorizing works of art, architecture, material culture, and the names of artists, architects, and geographic names. They have been the life work of many people and continue to be critical contributions to cultural heritage information management and documentation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oclc.org/news/releases/20642.htm Online Computer Library Center, Inc. (OCLC) news release about Getty Vocabularies]{{dead link|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They contain terms, names, and other information about people, places, things, and concepts relating to art, architecture, and material culture. They can be accessed online free of charge on the Getty website.

==Usage==
The Getty vocabularies can be used in three ways: at the data entry stage, by catalogers or indexers who are describing works of art, architecture, material culture, archival materials, visual surrogates, or bibliographic materials; as knowledge bases, providing information for researchers; and as search assistants to enhance end-user access to online resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/|title=Getty Vocabularies (Getty Research Institute)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Getty vocabularies are available in MARC format for easy mapping.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jodi.tamu.edu/Articles/v04/i04/Vizine-Goetz/ Journal of Digital Information, vol. 4, no. 4 (2004)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910185528/http://jodi.tamu.edu/Articles/v04/i04/Vizine-Goetz/ |date=September 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Getty Vocabulary Program has been active within the library community, offering training on thesaurus construction and training on contributing via Getty online webforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vocabcontrib.getty.edu/login.aspx|title=Web-Form for Getty|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These opportunities are held during annual conferences of organizations such as [[Art Libraries Society of North America]] (ARLIS), [[Visual Resources Association]] (VRA), [[American Library Association]] (ALA), [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA), [[NFAIS]], [[Society of American Archivists]] (SAA), and [[Museum Computer Network]] (MCN).

==History==
Editorial work has been managed by the Getty since 1983. In 1987 the Getty created a department dedicated to compiling and distributing terminology called the Vocabulary Coordination Group, now known as the '''Getty Vocabulary Program''', which was within the Getty Information Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlib.org/dlib/march99/fink/03fink.html|title=The Getty Information Institute: A Retrospective|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data is compiled and edited in an editorial system that was custom-built by Getty technical staff to meet the unique requirements of compiling data from many contributors, building complex and changing polyhierarchies, merging, moving, and publishing in various formats. Final editorial control of the Vocabularies are maintained by the Getty Vocabulary Program, using well-established editorial rules. They are now published in automated formats only, in both a searchable online Web interface and in data files available for licensing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/aat/about.html |title=Getty Vocabularies (Getty Research Institute) |publisher=Getty.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1998, Getty Information Technology Services and Web Services have worked closely with the '''Getty Vocabulary Program''' to conceive, develop, deploy, and continuously enhance the technologies necessary to support the growth and usage of the vocabulary databases. Three major projects comprise the work completed to date. First, the Vocabulary Coordination System (VCS) project created a single production system that replaced three separate, outdated and disparate data collection and editorial systems that had been used to produce the three vocabularies. The new, more powerful production engine allows Getty staff to efficiently collect, analyze, edit, merge and distribute terminology from Getty departments, as well as from external collaborating institutions. Second, the Vocabularies on the Web project produced unified Web-based access to the three Getty vocabularies and made them available to hundreds of thousands of researchers, scholars, and members of the general public who are interested in the subject areas covered by the vocabularies. This project also enhanced security to protect the Getty’s intellectual property, and added measurement metrics to allow the Getty to gauge the usage volume, usage patterns, and the success of these efforts. Finally, the Vocabulary Contributions project created processes and procedures for making use of and contributing to the vocabulary databases an integral part of the work in all relevant Getty and external projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwhonors.org/viewCaseStudy.asp?NominationID=112 Computerworld Honors Case Study 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the '''Getty Vocabulary Program''' was moved from its Santa Monica office to its current location within the [[Getty Research Institute]] at the [[Getty Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifla.org/VII/s30/news/4601.htm#6|title=no. 46 (2000, no 1)  - Newsletter of the Section of Art Libraries (Web edition)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and recognition==
The Getty Vocabulary Program won the [[Computerworld]] Honors for 2007 in the category of Media Arts and Entertainment for Web-Based Global Art Resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwhonors.org/laureates/recipients2007.htm|title=Computerworld Honors Program - 2007 Recipients|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Iran Research Institute of Philosophy''' ('''IRIP''') ([[Persian language|Persian]]: مؤسسه پژوهشی حکمت و فلسفه ایران) is a [[Public university|Public]] research institute in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]].

[[Image:John Franklin Botume.jpg|thumb|alt=John Franklin Botume as an older man.|John Franklin Botume as an older man.]]'''John Franklin Botume''' (November 21, 1855 – October 17, 1917) was a [[singing|singer]], [[conducting|choir director]] and [[vocal pedagogy|vocal pedagogist]].  He is the author of several books on singing including ''Modern Singing Methods: Their Use and Abuse'' (1885).

==Life and career==
John Franklin Botume was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] on November 21, 1855 to Elizabeth Augusta (Lord) Botume and John Botume, Jr., a successful businessman with the Baldwin, Botume &amp; Co. packing company.  John Franklin was the only son and had two sisters.
Coming from a well-to-do family, Frank (as he frequently went by) attended the [[Boston Latin School]] and then entered [[Harvard College]].  While Frank's parents had him cut out for a career in [[lawyer|law]], he started deviating from their plans and began pursuing singing.  He studied many years under the Italian [[voice teacher]] Vincenzo Cirillo.

[[Image:John Franklin Botume (young).jpg|thumb|alt=John Franklin Botume as a young man.|John Franklin Botume as a young man.]]After graduating from Harvard in 1876, he attended [[Harvard Law School]] for a year and he later taught music in Boston and [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] as he read law. In 1881 Frank was admitted to the [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk County]] Bar and began dividing his time between practicing law and teaching the [[music]] he enjoyed.  Finally, four years later, Frank broke for good with the law profession and dedicated all of his time to singing.

For the rest of his life, Frank was heavily involved in both [[music education|teaching]] and [[performing arts|performing]] music in and around Boston and [[New York City]].  In 1883 he was listed in the [https://books.google.com/books?id=-OcsAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA4-PA50&amp;dq=Boston+Musical+Yearbook+botume&amp;ei=j2TdSpLKEZnUkgS2w-iKAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Boston Musical Yearbook''] as the director and [[Accompaniment|accompanist]] of the "Gounod Quartet" and a [[bass (voice type)|bass singer]] in the "Cecilia" Club.&lt;ref&gt;G. H. Wilson. ''Boston Musical Yearbook''. Boston: [unknown publisher], 1883-4, pp. 48, 50.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the summers of 1889 and 1891, he traveled to [[Paris]], [[London]] and [[Munich]] to study with well-known singing teachers.

From 1891 to 1892 Frank was the resident [[director of music|director]] of the Boston branch of the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts|American Academy of the Dramatic Arts]], and from 1892 to 1893 Principal of the opera department of American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City.  Soon after, he left that position to become the choirmaster at the historic St. James Church Episcopal Church in Roxbury, a post he would hold for 20 years.  There, his duties included training and directing the vested [[choir]] and soloist [[quartet]].  All the time, he continued to teach voice privately.

About a year prior to his death, Frank retired from his job as choirmaster, continuing to teach privately.  By this time he had lost one eye due to a fishing accident and was in poor health. The accident occurred sometime before 18 June 1891, which was the date of Frank's U.S. Passport application listing that he had "1 artificial eye".  John Franklin Botume died suddenly of a [[bleeding|hemorrhage]] October 17, 1917 in Boston at age 61.  He was never married nor had any children.&lt;ref&gt;''Harvard College-The Class of 1876 Seventh Report of the Secretary Covering the Class history for Twenty-five Years to MDCCCCI''. Compiled by Secretary, Harvard College. Boston: Merrymount Press, 1901, p. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Harvard Graduates Magazine'', Vol. 26 1917-1918. Boston: Harvard Graduates' Magazine Association, 1917, 1918, pp. 286-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Additional biographical information obtained through personal correspondence with J. F. Botume's great great niece Martha Winters and from her [http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=mswinters&amp;id=I2252 webpage on John Franklin Botume].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Obituary Notice]. ''Boston Evening Transcript''. Thursday, October 18, 1917.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Order for Interment in the Cemetery of Mount Auburn" [unpublished].&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Modern Singing Methods''==
In his ''Modern Singing Methods'', John Franklin Botume was perhaps the first published vocal pedagogue to bridge the substantial gap between the "old Italian school" and the "modern school" of singing, showing the strengths and weaknesses of each method alone and how they could support each other combined.  Botume believed that one great strength of the "old Italian school" is its regimen of developing the [[human voice|voice]] over a long period of training and exercise.  He also found this to be a weakness in the "modern school" training:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The teacher of the future will […] follow the old process. He will attempt little the first or the second year, and will go gradually, carefully, regularly and, above all, slowly to the end. […] Nature is a hard task-mistress. What you steal from her today, she will exact with compound interest tomorrow. The end of these "short-cuts" is, that every quick result which the pupil gains is attended either with some physical weakness or disease, or else with an accompanying fault; such as a tremolo, a tendency to sing "off the key," a nasal, sharp, foggy, hard or weak tone, a lack of flexibility, a premature decay of the voice, or some other disagreeable thing, which, like Banquo's ghost, is apt to pop up at the very moment you wish to display yourself on some festal occasion.&lt;ref&gt;p. 22-23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another strength Botume identified of the "old" method is its viewpoint on what the singer feels.  While modern science can tell us what a good singer's vocal folds are doing while they are singing, it has been at a loss to help inexperienced singers achieve the same technique.  In the "old Italian school", singers would listen to the proper execution of a vocalization and attempt to emulate it.  The teacher would then use their experienced ears to inform the student when they had achieved the desired results and the student would memorize the sensations accompanying the correct technique.  Botume recommends that this process be continued in modern voice training, describing five different [[vocal register]]s by the region of the body they are felt to vibrate.

Botume did not, however, discount the "modern school" completely.  Indeed, he praised it for bringing a level of "intellectualism" into singing, allowing a method of scientifically based techniques to be taught ("how to sing"), whereas in the "old Italian school" only the desired results were taught ("what one should sound like").   He also praised the "modern school" for dispelling the myth that voice teachers possess some mystical power for transforming common voices into magnificent ones:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It cannot be too strongly insisted that the art of singing is not an occult thing. It is very much like the carpenter's trade: one must have some aptitude for it to begin with; next he must learn how to use the tools of his craft; finally, he must acquire mechanical dexterity by practice.&lt;ref&gt;p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Botume's ''Modern Singing Methods'' is a ground-breaking work that held influence over several later vocal pedagogical works.  In his ''Psychology of Singing'' (MacMillan, 1917), David Taylor said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Probably the best summary of the old Italian method offered by any modern teacher is contained in a little booklet by J. Frank Botume, entitled Modern Singing Methods. […] This sums up beautifully the external aspects of the old Italian method, and of modern methods as well.&lt;ref&gt;p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The work was also cited in ''Resonance in Singing and Speaking'' by Thomas Fille-Brown (Oliver Ditson &amp; Co, 1911), as well as the modern books ''Secrets of Singing'' by Jeffry Allen (Alfred, 1994, 2005) and ''The Singer's Companion'' by Brent Monahan (Limelight Editions, 2007).

* ''Exercises in Vocal Technique'' (1894)
* ''Respiration for Advanced Singers'' (1897)
* ''Voice Production Today'' (1916)

Botume also published several songs for both solo voice and choir, including "Morning Love Song" (1896) and "The Trill," (date unknown), and an arrangement of scenes from the earliest opera still extant, [[Jacopo Peri]]'s ''[[Euridice (opera)|Euridice]]'' (1895).

'''Mary Lowe Dickinson''' (née Mary Caroline Underwood, 1839–1914) was a 19th and early 20th-century American fiction writer, poet, editor, and educator who also became an advocate for women’s rights and anti-war activist.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Katherine H.

Asked later in life about her decision to pursue the writing life, she observed, “Talent uses us…. If I had had a spark of it, I could not have waited for circumstances to force me to use it.”&lt;ref&gt;Emerson, William A. ”[https://archive.org/stream/fitchburgmassach00emer#page/n129/search/Lowe Mary Caroline Dickinson]”, in ''Fitchburg Massachusetts, Past and Present'', pp. 101-105. Fitchburg, Massachusetts: Press of Blanchard &amp; Brown, 1887.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formative years==
Born in [[Fitchburg, Massachusetts]] on January 23, 1839, Mary Caroline Underwood (later known as Mary Lowe Dickinson) was a daughter of Ruth (Burgess) Underwood (1805–1869), a native of [[Warren, Rhode Island]], and Timothy Underwood (1803–1863), a native of [[Swanzey, New Hampshire]] who had become the owner-operator of a livery and stage coach route based in Fitchburg.&lt;ref&gt;Underwood, Lucien Marcus, compiler, and Howard J. Banker, editor. ''[https://archive.org/details/underwoodfamilie01unde The Underwood Family in America]'', Vol. I: 90. Timothy Underwood, pp. 60-64. Lancaster, Pennsylvania: The New Era Printing Company, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Fitchburg Massachusetts, Past and Present'', p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

She was raised in Fitchburg with her siblings: Harriet Alice (1825–1887), who later married Luke Wellington; Ann Elizabeth (1827–1844); Charlotte Hoar (1829–1891); Hannah Fidelia (1831–1882), who later wed Charles James Frye; James Burgess (born 1833), who died in the Utah Territory while in service with the 2nd California Cavalry; Abby Sophia (1835–1914), who later married Joel Willard Sheldon; Edward Monroe (1837–1921); George Henry (1841–1894); William Waldo (1843–1880); and Albert Greenwood (born 1845), who died on November 11, 1845 at the age of 7 months, and was laid to rest at the Laurel Hill Cemetery in Fitchburg.&lt;ref&gt;''The Underwood Family in America'', pp. 60-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her father was described as a laborer on 1850 federal and 1855 Massachusetts census records and as a hostler on the federal census of 1860.&lt;ref&gt;Underwood, Mary C., Timothy, Ruth, et. al., in U.S. Census (Fitchburg, Worcester County, Massachusetts, 1850). Washington, D.C.: U.S. National Archives and Records Administration.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Underwood, Mary C. Timothy, Ruth, et. al., in Massachusetts State Census (Fitchburg, Worcester County, Massachusetts, 1855). Boston, Massachusetts: Massachusetts State Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Underwood, Mary C., Timothy, Ruth, et. al., in U.S. Census (Fitchburg, Worcester County, Massachusetts, 1860). Washington, D.C.: U.S. National Archives and Records Administration.&lt;/ref&gt;

Educated in the common schools of her community&lt;ref&gt;''Fitchburg, Massachusetts, Past and Present'', p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; she became a teacher in the small school of a neighboring village in 1854 when she was just 15 years old. As she became more adept as an educator, she was appointed as the head assistant of a school in [[Boston]], and then was awarded the job of assistant principal at the [[Hartford Female Seminary]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Underwood Family in America'', p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 3, 1858, she wed George P. Lowe in Fitchburg, [[Worcester County, Massachusetts|Worcester County]]. A seaman and fellow Fitchburg native, he was a son of Stephen and Susan Lowe.&lt;ref&gt;Mary C. Underwood, George P. Lowe, Timothy &amp; Ruth Underwood, and Stephen &amp; Susan Lowe, in “Massachusetts Marriage Records” (Fitchburg, Worcester County, 1858). Boston, Massachusetts: Massachusetts State Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; Widowed by him soon thereafter while he was traveling abroad,&lt;ref&gt;''Fitchburg, Massachusetts, Past and Present'', p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;, she also sustained another loss in 1863 when her father passed away in Fitchburg at the age of 60 on September 30, and was laid to rest at the same cemetery – Laurel Hill – where her youngest brother had been interred 18 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;''The Underwood Family in America'', p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Already greatly respected for her abilities as an educator and administrator by the time she was 24 years old, she was offered the job of vice-principal of the newly-established [[Vassar College]] in 1863, which she declined, choosing instead to pursue further training in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;''The Underwood Family in America'', p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Traveling as a tutor with a female student and her family, she wrote regularly for thirteen publications, including the ''New York Tribune''. After her term of service ended due to her student's marriage, she was then hired as a tutor by a family from Chicago, becoming so close that she was treated as a member of that family for many years thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;''Fitchburg, Massachusetts, Past and Present'', pp. 101-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon her return to New York during the fall of 1867, she was awarded the position of acting principal of the Van Norman Institute, one of the city’s elite and most successful boarding schools.&lt;ref&gt;''The Underwood Family in America'', p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Fitchburg, Massachusetts, Past and Present'', p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mary Lowe Dickinson, 1870 (from a portrait by Theodore Pine).jpg|thumb|Mary Lowe Dickinson's portrait was painted by Theodore Pine in 1870 (black and white version of the original; ''Heaven, Home and Happiness'', 1901).]] Around this same time, she became the second wife of John B. Dickinson (1814–1875), a New York native who had become a highly successful and wealthy businessman.&lt;ref&gt;''The Underwood Family in America'', p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1871, the couple embarked on an extended trip overseas.&lt;ref&gt;”Mary Lowe Dickinson”, in “[https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84029853/1895-08-08/ed-1/seq-3/#date1=1895&amp;index=5&amp;rows=20&amp;searchType=advanced&amp;language=&amp;sequence=0&amp;words=Dickinson+Lowe+Mary&amp;proxdistance=5&amp;date2=1895&amp;ortext=&amp;proxtext=&amp;phrasetext=%22Mary+Lowe+Dickinson%22&amp;andtext=&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1 Coming Congress: Some New Faces of the Lower House].” Dodge City, Kansas: ''The Globe-Republican'', August 8, 1895.&lt;/ref&gt; Making Italy their home base for three years, they ventured forth on periodic excursions, including a voyage along the [[Nile river|Nile River]] aboard a [[Dahabeah|Dahabeah]] during the winter of 1872–1873, during which she wrote her poem, “If We Had But a Day.”&lt;ref&gt;''Fitchburg, Massachusetts, Past and Present'', p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tragically, she was widowed a second time when her husband, John B. Dickinson, died suddenly of a stroke on March 16, 1875&lt;ref&gt;”John B. Dickinson”, in “New York Deaths and Burials, 1795–1952 (FHL microfilm 1,671,687)”. Salt Lake City, Utah: Family History Library (FHL microfilm 1,671,687, March 16, 1875, Chicago Deaths).&lt;/ref&gt; while on a stopover in [[Chicago]] en route to San Francisco. According to the ''Fitchburg Sentinel'':&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/65091413/ Obituary of John B. Dickinson]. Fitchburg, Massachusetts: ''The Fitchburg Sentinel'', March 20, 1875.&lt;/ref&gt; 
		
&lt;blockquote&gt;John B. Dickinson, the senior member of the firm of Dickinson &amp; Co., bankers of New York city, died on Tuesday last in Chicago, of [[Apoplexy|apoplexy]], while on his way to visit his daughter, Mrs. Sherwood, in [[San Francisco]]. Mr. Dickinson was born in New York in 1814, but lived with an uncle in [[North Carolina]] until he was sixteen years old. He then returned to New York…. He was a director in the National Shoe and Leather Bank, the Union Mutual Insurance Company, the Broadway Insurance Company and the Brooklyn Dry Dock Company. He was also at one time president of the [[Tenth National Bank]]. Mr. Dickinson amassed a large fortune by his industry and business capacity. He was twice married and is survived by his second wife, four sons and four daughters. Mr. Dickinson was known to some of our citizens, having married for his second wife Mrs. Mary C. Lowe, formerly of this city.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following funeral services at St. Paul’s Methodist Episcopal Church, located at the corner of New York City's Twenty-second Street and Fourth Avenue, her husband was laid to rest at the Green-Wood Cemetery in [[Brooklyn, New York]]. According to ''The New York Times'', “The ceremony [at the church] was witnessed by a congregation of relatives, friends, and business associates that crowded the building in every part. Exceptionally rich and costly floral offerings decorated the altar and chancel. The services were begun with the singing of the hymn, ‘Nearer My God to Thee.’”&lt;ref&gt;”[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1875/03/22/91671232.pdf The Funeral of John B. Dickinson].” New York, New York: ''The New York Times'', March 22, 1875.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly thereafter, she began work as head of a Brooklyn school's department of literature and composition, but then resigned that position in favor of work as a private tutor.&lt;ref&gt;''Fitchburg, Massachusetts, Past and Present'', p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, she entered a period of her life throughout which she battled serious financial hardships. Multiple biographers and newspapers have documented that, two years after being widowed, the fortune she had inherited from her late husband was gone. Howard J. Banker described her savings as “suddenly swept away.” The contacts she had built as an educator and advocate for women, however, helped her survive. According to Banker, “She was offered important positions in [[Wellesley College|Wellesley]], [[Northwestern University]], Vassar, the [[University of Denver]], and the [[University of Southern California]]." In 1888, she chose to become “the Chair of Literature in the University of Denver, where she labored for two years with such zeal and earnestness that her health became impaired and she was compelled to retire.”&lt;ref&gt;''The Underwood Family in America'', pp. 61-62.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Gazette'' of Fort Worth, Texas, she was paid “the same salary as a man in a corresponding position” during her time there.&lt;ref&gt;Mrs. [https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86064205/1888-12-16/ed-1/seq-4/#date1=1850&amp;index=14&amp;rows=20&amp;searchType=advanced&amp;language=&amp;sequence=0&amp;words=Dickinson+Low+Mary&amp;proxdistance=5&amp;date2=1963&amp;ortext=&amp;proxtext=&amp;phrasetext=%22Mary+Low+Dickinson%22&amp;andtext=&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1 Mary Lowe Dickinson], in “News and Notes.” Fort Worth, Texas: ''The Gazette'', December 16, 1888, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;”[https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1898-03-22/ed-1/seq-10/#date1=1850&amp;sort=relevance&amp;rows=20&amp;searchType=advanced&amp;language=&amp;sequence=0&amp;index=3&amp;words=Dickinson+Low+Mary&amp;proxdistance=5&amp;date2=1963&amp;ortext=&amp;proxtext=&amp;phrasetext=%22Mary+Low+Dickinson%22&amp;andtext=&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=2 Mrs. Mary Lowe Dickinson]” (illustrated image with caption).

==Editorial and writing life==
According to biographer William Emerson, Mary Lowe Dickinson “wrote leaders for dailies, editorials for weeklies, serials, short travels, poems, articles on education and philanthropy, and Sunday School lessons, never free enough to work in any favorite line, but always shaping her work to suit the demand of the hour.”&lt;ref&gt;''Fitchburg, Massachusetts, Past and Present'', p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, she wrote about the lives and work of: [[Charles Kingsley]], [[Harriet Martineau]], [[George Sand]], and others; edited ''The Open Window'', a magazine produced by convalescing patients and other invalids by the Shut-In Society; served as an associate editor for the philanthropic magazine published by [[Edward Everett Hale]] and his Lend a Hand Society;&lt;ref&gt;''Fitchburg, Massachusetts, Past and Present'', pp. 103-104.&lt;/ref&gt; contributed “A Tour Around the World" to the November 1882 edition of ''Chautauquan''; and &lt;ref&gt;Hoganson, Kristin L.

==Philanthropic and community service efforts==
[[File:Mary Lowe Dickinson (Pacific Commercial Advertiser, April 18, 1895).jpg|thumb|Announcement of Mary Lowe Dickinson's appointment as president, National Council of Women of the United States (''Pacific Commercial Advertiser'', April 18, 1895).]] During the mid-1880s, Mary Lowe Dickinson became active with other prominent women in the planning and launch of a new philanthropic organization, the [[International Order of the King’s Daughters and Sons]]. Appointed in 1887 as general secretary – a post which she held for the remainder of her life – she also edited the group’s magazine, ''The Silver Cross'', beginning in 1888, and penned the lyrics for the group’s hymn, ''Lead Now as Forth We Go'', which were set to the music of ''Nearer My God to Thee''.&lt;ref&gt;Buck, Sue. “[https://iokds.org/home/a-brief-history/ A Brief History].” Chautauqua, New York: International Order of the King’s Sons and Daughters, retrieved online August 1, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually garnering national attention for the organization and for herself in newspapers nationwide, she was invited to speak at the Dansville Water Cure during the late 1800s. According to historian Susan Cayleff, this health spa became known as “Our Home” to many of those who became involved with it as patrons or patients. In addition to serving “as a training ground for women physicians”, this facility was propelled to “the center of national reform politics” when James Caleb Jackson assumed leadership – due to his interest in abolition, temperance, women’s rights, the cooperative union of labor and capital, and mental therapeutics.” Other prominent women and men who lectured or received care here included: Bronson Alcott, Susan B. Anthony, Clara Barton, Frederick Douglass, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Sojourner Truth.&lt;ref&gt;Cayleff, Susan E. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PtpyJgRT5gcC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;dq=%22Mary+Low+Dickinson%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6GrB3DFaw5&amp;sig=TgeN6KxuhA1DwSUz-npWhlvM7b8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjH4e-bqszcAhUFKqwKHW6pB08Q6AEwA3oECAMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Mary%20Low%20Dickinson%22&amp;f=false Wash and Be Healed: The Water-Cure Movement and Women’s Health]''.

After advocating for uniform [[Divorce in the United States|divorce]] laws for men and women in the United States in 1892,&lt;ref&gt;”Have Gained a Point,” ''Grand Rapids Herald''.&lt;/ref&gt; she was elected president, in 1895, of the [[National Council of Women of the United States]]. One of the oldest, nonsectarian women’s organizations in America, NCW was at the forefront, during the late 1890s, of efforts to ensure [[Equal pay for women|equal pay for women]] and reform dress codes. During her tenure as president, she oversaw revisions to the NCW’s constitution and structure, including the division of the organization into an “upper and lower council.”&lt;ref&gt;”[https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85042461/1895-02-27/ed-1/seq-1/#date1=1850&amp;index=7&amp;rows=20&amp;searchType=advanced&amp;language=&amp;sequence=0&amp;words=Dickinson+Low+Mary&amp;proxdistance=5&amp;date2=1963&amp;ortext=&amp;proxtext=&amp;phrasetext=%22Mary+Low+Dickinson%22&amp;andtext=&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1 The Women of the Nation: Changes Made in the National Council’s Constitution].” Los Angeles, California: ''The Herald'', February 27, 1895.&lt;/ref&gt; During this era, she also issued an appeal (in 1898) for clothing and supplies to relieve “the suffering women and children of Cuba.”&lt;ref&gt;”[https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1898-03-22/ed-1/seq-10/#date1=1850&amp;sort=relevance&amp;rows=20&amp;searchType=advanced&amp;language=&amp;sequence=0&amp;index=3&amp;words=Dickinson+Low+Mary&amp;proxdistance=5&amp;date2=1963&amp;ortext=&amp;proxtext=&amp;phrasetext=%22Mary+Low+Dickinson%22&amp;andtext=&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=2 Free Transportation of Supplies].” Washington, D.C.: ''The Evening Star'', March 22, 1898, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional service included appointments as secretary of the [[American Bible Society|American Bible Society’s]] Women’s Branch, national superintendent of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union|Women’s Christian Temperance Union’s]] higher education department, and president of the [[Women's National Indian Association|Women’s National Indian Association]].&lt;ref&gt;“Coming Congress: Some New Faces of the Lower House,” ''The Globe-Republican''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-war activism==
Three years before the turn of the century, she co-signed a letter with [[Maud Ballington Booth|Maud D. Ballington-Booth]] (Salvation Army), Mary Louise Beebe, [[Elizabeth Bacon Custer]] (the widow of George Armstrong Custer), [[Grace Hoadley Dodge]] (Y.W.C.A. and Travelers Aid Society of New York), [[Mary Mapes Dodge]] (renowned children’s author), Hannah B. Einstein (National Federation of Temple Sisterhoods and Federation of Jewish Women’s Organizations), [[Jeannette Leonard Gilder]] (editor, ''Scribner’s Monthly'' and drama and music critic, ''The New York Herald''), [[Ellen Martin Henrotin]] (president of the General Federation of Women’s Clubs), [[Josephine Shaw Lowell]] (founder, New York Consumer’s League), [[Alice Freeman Palmer]] (former president, Wellesley College, and dean of women, University of Chicago), Julia H. Percy, [[Margaret Elizabeth Sangster]] (editor, ''Harper’s Bazaar''), [[Louisa Lee Schuyler]] (founder, New York State Charities Aid Association), Mary E. Trautman, and [[Candace Wheeler]] (founder, the Society of Decorative art in New York, and co-founder, New York Exchange for Women’s Work) to prevent America’s entry into armed conflict. It ran in newspapers on February 10, 1897, and read as follows:&lt;ref&gt;”An Appeal to Women”, ''Twice-a-week Plain Dealer''.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;To the Women of the United States: We ask your earnest and prompt cooperation in urging upon the senate of the United States that after full consideration it should ratify the arbitration treaty between this country and Great Britain, and without amendments  which will cripple its efficiency. The mothers, the wives and the homes of our land have the deepest interest in the substitution of law for war. In times of conflict they are the keenest sufferers, and while the nation’s honor is dear to them, whatever tends to settle disputes by reason and law, rather than by warfare, demands their heartiest indorsement. It is absolutely necessary that the universal public opinion of the country, in favor of this treaty, should find expression. Therefore, we ask you, without delay, to write personally to your senators, to hold meetings, to send petitions and to aid by all means in your power, the completion of this great act of Christian civilization.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The treaty referred to in this letter was an agreement between [[Great Britain]] and [[Venezuela]] “to provide for an amicable settlement of the question which has arisen between their respective Governments concerning the boundary between the Colony of British Guiana and the United States of Venezuela.”&lt;ref&gt;”[https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/GB-VE_970202_Treaty%20of%20Arbitration.pdf Treaty of Arbitration between Great Britain and the United States of Venezuela: Washington D.C., 2 February 1897]”, in “UN Peacemaker.” New York, New York: United Nations, retrieved online August 1, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal challenges and illness==
During the opening decade of the new century, Mary Low Dickinson suffered another series of financial and legal setbacks, this time resulting from her agreement in 1904 to purchase an expensive set of books due to a mistaken belief that she was creating a sound investment opportunity. Refusing to remit payment after realizing her error, she then fell ill in June of 1909 after being harassed and sued by creditors. Newspapers nationwide chronicled the state of her affairs, including ''The Topeka State Journal'', which noted that:&lt;ref&gt;”[https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82016014/1909-06-19/ed-1/seq-12/#date1=1850&amp;index=0&amp;rows=20&amp;searchType=advanced&amp;language=&amp;sequence=0&amp;words=Dickinson+Low+Mary&amp;proxdistance=5&amp;date2=1963&amp;ortext=&amp;proxtext=&amp;phrasetext=%22Mary+Low+Dickinson%22&amp;andtext=&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1 Mrs. Dickinson Ill: Founder of Kings Daughters Worries Over a Lawsuit].” Topeka, Kansas: ''The Topeka State Journal'', June 19, 1909, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mrs. Mary Low Dickinson, the venerable authoress and founder of the International Order of Kings Daughters, is quite ill at her home here, it was announced today, following a lawsuit in which a judgment of $10,000 was given against her recently in favor of a Boston publishing house. The friends of Mrs. Dickinson, learning of her illness, because of worry over the lawsuit, took up the matter and as a result a rehearing of the case has been granted by the courts and is scheduled to start on Monday, but it is not likely that Mrs. Dickinson will be able to leave her home then.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

According to ''The Sun'' of New York:&lt;ref&gt;”[https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030272/1909-06-19/ed-1/seq-7/#date1=1850&amp;index=11&amp;rows=20&amp;searchType=advanced&amp;language=&amp;sequence=0&amp;words=Dickinson+Low+Mary&amp;proxdistance=5&amp;date2=1963&amp;ortext=&amp;proxtext=&amp;phrasetext=%22Mary+Low+Dickinson%22&amp;andtext=&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1 Suing Mrs. Dickinson: Publishing Firm Says She Agreed to Pay $7,500 for a Set of Books]”. New York, New York: ''The Sun'', June 19, 1909, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The plaintiff alleges that Mrs. Dickinson, on November 21, 1904, contracted to purchase from the [Frederick J. Quimby] company a set of the works of Paul de Kock in fifty volumes for $7,500, and that the company was ready to deliver them on December 1 of that year, but that Mrs. Dickinson refused to take them.

In her answer Mrs. Dickinson admits having signed a contract for the books, but alleges that the firm represented to her that it only wished to sell her the books for the use of her name and that it would resell them for her at a good profit before delivery.... The matter was put to her, she says, as an investment, and she signed the contract with that understanding....

The book concern obtained a judgment against Mrs. Dickinson by default last March while she was out of the city. On her return her attorney, Melvin H. Dalberg … procured the setting aside of the judgment by Justice Guy in Special Term, Part I., and a new trial was ordered.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the June 16, 1909 deposition process for that new trial and the actual trial itself on June 21 it was revealed that Mary Lowe Dickinson had initially agreed to purchase the company’s $2,500 edition of the books, but had been pressured into changing her order to a substantially more expensive one by a representative of the Quimby Company who had convinced her that she could earn a $500 profit if she re-sold it to “a woman in West Virginia who would ultimately rebuy the books from her,” but that the books had not even been ready for delivery to Dickinson and could not have later been resold because the purported buyer from West Virginia had never existed. As a result, New York Supreme Court Justice [[James A. O'Gorman|James Aloysius O’Gorman]] dismissed the lawsuit against Dickinson.&lt;ref&gt;”[https://books.google.com/books?id=8XAyAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=Mary+L.+Dickinson+and+Justice+Guy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=t6eAt038vZ&amp;sig=ReQf7Y8PaUoql3KpXvcqMKUH11A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiCvqjSr8_cAhUco4MKHX0oDP8Q6AEwAHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Mary%20L.%20Dickinson%20and%20Justice%20Guy&amp;f=false Quimby Suit Against Mrs. Dickinson Dismissed].” New York, New York: ''The Publisher’s Weekly'', Vol. 76, No. 1954, p. 58, July 10, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final years, death and interment==
By 1910, she was a 71-year-old widow residing at the [[Manhattan, New York]] home of her friend, Kate Bond (aged 75), with whom she served in the International Order of the King’s Daughters and Sons, and Bond’s 70-year-old niece – both of whom were described on that year's federal census as being natives of [[Maryland]] who had their own income. Dickinson was described as a magazine editor.&lt;ref&gt;”Dickinson, Mary L.”, in U.S. Census (Ward 22, Manhattan, New York, 1910). Washington, D.C.: U.S. National Archives and Records Administration.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Underwood Family in America'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;”[https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82014086/1911-10-05/ed-1/seq-8/#date1=1909&amp;index=0&amp;rows=20&amp;searchType=advanced&amp;language=&amp;sequence=0&amp;words=Dickinson+Lowe+Mary&amp;proxdistance=5&amp;date2=1914&amp;ortext=&amp;proxtext=&amp;phrasetext=%22Mary+Lowe+Dickinson%22&amp;andtext=&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1 State King’s Daughters: Meetings to Be Held at Bridgeport Next Week].” Norwich, Connecticut: ''Norwich Bulletin'', October 5, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Low Dickinson died in June 1914. Following funeral services on June 11 at the Methodist Episcopal Church at 60th Street and Madison Avenue, she was laid to rest during a private interment ceremony at Brooklyn’s Green-Wood Cemetery, where her husband had been buried in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;”[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/79054293/ Dickinson]” (funeral notice).

A '''[[Master's degree]] in [[Finance]]''' is a [[postgraduate degree|postgraduate program]] preparing graduates for [[career]]s in Finance. The degree is often titled '''Master of Finance''' or '''Master in Finance''' (abbreviated '''M.Fin.''', '''MiF'''), or '''Master of Science in Finance''' ('''MSF''' in North America and [[MSc]] in Finance in the UK and Europe).  In the U.S. and Canada the program may be positioned as a [[professional degree]].  Particularly in [[Australia]], the degree may be offered as a '''Master of Applied Finance''' ('''MAppFin'''). In some cases, the degree is offered as a [[Master of Management|Master of Management in Finance]] (MMF).

==Structure==
MSF and M.Fin / MSc programs differ as to intended career preparation and hence degree focus — with the former centered on [[Managerial finance|financial management]] and [[investment management]], and the latter on more technical roles&lt;ref name="businessweek"&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2009-04-06/masters-of-the-financial-universebusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice ''Master's of the Financial Universe''], [[businessweek.com]], April 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 
(although, see below for further discussion as to this distinction). Both degree types, though, emphasize [[quantitative property|quantitative]] topics, and may also offer some non-quantitative elective coursework, such as [[corporate governance]], [[business ethics]] and [[business strategy]].&lt;ref name="mbavmsf"/&gt; Programs generally require one to two years of study, and are often offered as a non-[[thesis]] degree.

The MSF program, typically, prepares graduates for careers&lt;ref name="usnews"&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/top-business-schools/articles/2015/02/09/determine-if-a-masters-in-finance-is-the-right-move ''Determine If a Master's in Finance Is the Right Move''], [[usnews.com]], Feb. 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ft"/&gt; in [[corporate finance]], [[investment banking]] and investment management.&lt;ref name="businessweek"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example [http://carey.jhu.edu/academics/master-of-science/ms-in-finance/ Johns Hopkins - Carey's MS in Finance]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[core curriculum]] is thus focused on [[managerial finance]], corporate finance and [[investment analysis]]. These topics are generally preceded by more fundamental coursework in [[economics]], ([[managerial accounting|managerial]]) [[accounting]], and [[Business_mathematics#Postgraduate|"quantitative methods"]] (usually [[time value of money]] and [[business statistics]]). In many programs, these fundamental topics are a prerequisite for admission or assumed as known, and if part of the curriculum, students with appropriate background may be exempt from these. &lt;ref name ="Lerner"&gt;[https://lerner.udel.edu/programs/specialized-graduate-programs/finance-ms/ Delaware-Lerner] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Case"/&gt; The program usually concludes with [[coursework]] in advanced topics — where several areas are integrated or applied — such as [[Investment management|portfolio management]], [[financial modeling]], [[mergers and acquisitions]] and [[real options]]; [[managerial economics]] and various [[quantitative finance]] topics may also be offered as advanced courses.

The M.Fin / MSc prepares graduates for more technical roles,&lt;ref name="businessweek"/&gt;  and thus "focuses on the theory and practice of finance" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/programmes/master-of-finance-mfin/ Cambridge's Master of Finance]&lt;/ref&gt; with a "strong emphasis on [[financial economics]] in addition to [[financial engineering]] and [[quantitative finance|computational methods]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princeton.edu/bcf/graduate/ Princeton's Master in Finance]&lt;/ref&gt; The MSF core topics are (often) also covered, although in (substantially) less detail. Elective work includes specific topics in [[quantitative finance]] and [[computational finance]], but also in [[corporate finance]], [[private equity]] and the like; several of the MSF advanced topics — such as real options and managerial economics — will thus also be offered, here differing as to a more technical orientation. As regards coverage of quantitative finance as compared to more specialized degrees, see below.

The MSF-M.Fin distinction is not absolute: some MSF programs, although general in coverage, are "quantitatively rigorous"&lt;ref name="PLU"&gt;[https://www.plu.edu/msf/ Pacific Lutheran University MSF]&lt;/ref&gt; or offer a "quantitative track"&lt;ref&gt;For example: [http://www.bc.edu/content/bc/schools/csom/graduate/msf/academics/msfenrollmentoptions/QuantitativeTrackCurriculum.html Boston College - Carroll's MSF]; [https://www.brandeis.edu/global/current-students/academic/msf/index.html Brandeis IBS' MSF]; [http://manderson.cba.ua.edu/academics/departments/masters_program/master_of_science_in_finance#SPECIALIZATIONS Alabama's MSF]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buffalo"/&gt; (and may be [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics#Immigration policy|STEM-designated]] &lt;ref name="Buffalo"&gt;[https://mgt.buffalo.edu/degree-programs/master-of-science-ms/finance.html SUNY Buffalo]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PLU"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/degrees/master-science-in-finance Carlson-Minnesota  Master of Science in Finance]&lt;/ref&gt;); while others are specifically technically oriented,&lt;ref&gt;For example [http://www.clarku.edu/gsom/graduate/msf/courses.cfm Clark University] and [http://stuart.iit.edu/programs/ms-finance IIT-Stuart]&lt;/ref&gt; or, in some cases, even offer a finance and mathematics [[dual degree]].&lt;ref name="collins"&gt;For example, [https://business.utulsa.edu/departments-schools/finance-operations-management/finance-graduate-programs/ Tulsa-Collins]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, although the "MSc in Finance" generally corresponds to the M.Fin, many schools&lt;ref&gt;For example [http://business-school.exeter.ac.uk/programmes/postgraduate/finance/ Exeter] and [http://www.essex.ac.uk/ebs/current/pgt/courses.aspx#finance Essex]&lt;/ref&gt; offer a range of MSc programs where finance may be combined with accountancy and/or management, and these then correspond to the MSF; note also that many MSc programs are further specialized, with the degree as a whole focused on, for example, [[Behavioral economics|Behavioral finance]], [[Islamic finance]] or [[Wealth management]].&lt;ref&gt;For example [http://www.icmacentre.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-degrees-in-finance Henley-ICMA] and [http://www.cass.city.ac.uk/courses/masters# City University London - Cass]&lt;/ref&gt; MMF programs may, similarly, offer either broad- or specialized finance coverage.&lt;ref name="MMF"&gt;For example: [https://www.mcgill.ca/desautels/programs/mmf McGill]; [https://www.wits.ac.za/course-finder/postgraduate/clm/mm-finance-and-investment-management/ Witwatersrand]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The MAppFin spans the MSF-M.Fin spectrum in terms of available specializations and corresponding coursework;&lt;ref name ="Macquarie"/&gt; it differs in that it is "for and by practitioners" &lt;ref name ="Macquarie"&gt;[http://www.mafc.mq.edu.au/our-programs/master-of-applied-finance/ Master of Applied Finance]: [[Macquarie University]].&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore "blends... finance theory with industry practice",&lt;ref name=״csu״&gt;[http://www.csu.edu.au/courses/master-of-applied-finance Master of Applied Finance]: [[Charles Sturt University]].&lt;/ref&gt; as appropriate to the specialization. Similar to the MSc, programs are sometimes specifically focused on Financial Planning or Banking,&lt;ref name=״csu״/&gt; for example, as opposed to more general coverage of finance. Some universities offer both the MAppFin and the MFin, with the latter requiring additional semester-time and coursework (and exclusively offering doctoral access). These programs may also differ as to entrance requirements.&lt;ref&gt;See for example:  [[Australian National University]] [http://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/program/7421XMAPFN#introduction]; [[University of Western Sydney]] [http://www.uws.edu.au/future-students/postgraduate/postgraduate/postgraduate_courses/business_courses/finance/applied_finance]; [[Curtin University]], [http://business.curtin.edu.au/courses/economics_finance/postgraduate/].&lt;/ref&gt;

Programs require a [[bachelor's degree]] for admission, but many do not require that the undergraduate [[Academic major|major]] be in finance, economics, or even general business.&lt;ref name="ft"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mbavmsf"/&gt; The usual requirement is a sufficient level of numeracy, often including exposure to [[probability]] / [[statistics]] and [[calculus]]. The M.Fin and MSc will often require more advanced topics such as [[multivariate calculus]], [[linear algebra]] and [[differential equations]]; these may also require a greater background in Finance or Economics than the MSF.&lt;ref&gt;Compare [http://www.fordham.edu/info/20482/academic_programs Fordham's MSF and MSQF]&lt;/ref&gt; Some programs may require work experience (sometimes at the managerial level), particularly if the candidate lacks a relevant undergraduate degree.

==Comparison with other qualifications==
Although there is some overlap with an [[Master in Business Administration|M.B.A.]],&lt;ref name="usnews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mbavmsf"&gt;[http://mbapodcaster.com/podcast/mbavmsf/ ''Getting an MBA vs. a Master’s in Finance or Economics''], mbapodcaster.com&lt;/ref&gt; the finance Master's provides a broader and deeper exposure to finance, but more limited exposure to [[management|general management]] topics. Thus, the program focuses on [[finance]] and [[financial market]]s, while an M.B.A., by contrast, is more diverse, covering general aspects of [[business]], such as [[human resource management]] and [[operations management]]. Note that an M.B.A. without a [[Master of Business Administration#Content|specialization]] in finance will not have covered many of the topics dealt with in the MSF (breadth), and, often even where there is specialization, those areas that are covered may be in less depth (certainly as regards the M.Fin). M.B.A. candidates will sometimes "dual major" with an M.B.A./MSF — certain universities also offer this combination as a [[dual degree|joint degree]]&lt;ref name="collins"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suffolk.edu/business/graduate/64785.php Suffolk-Sawyer]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://lazaridismba.ca/degree/mba-with-master-of-finance-toronto/ MBA with Master of Finance] [[Lazaridis School of Business and Economics|Lazaridis]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Case"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lerner"/&gt; — or later pursue an M.Fin degree to gain specialized finance knowledge;&lt;ref name="mbavmsf"/&gt; some universities offer an advanced certificate in finance appended to the MBA, allowing students to complete coursework beyond the standard finance specialization.&lt;ref&gt;See for example [http://www.fuqua.duke.edu/student_resources/academics/certificates/  Duke-Fuqua], [http://www.business.pitt.edu/katz/mba/academics/certificates Pittsburgh-Katz] , [http://www.missouristate.edu/fgb/mba/ Missouri State].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Master of Science in Management|MSM]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://lallyschool.rpi.edu/graduate-programs/ms-management MSM - Lally, RPI]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Case"&gt;[https://weatherhead.case.edu/degrees/masters/ms-management/finance/ Case-Weatherhead]&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Master of Commerce|M.Com]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/plans/2018/FINSCS8404.html   MComm - UNSW], [http://www.commerce.uct.ac.za/FinanceAndTax/CourseInfo/MCOM%20IN%20FINANCIAL%20MANAGEMENT MCom - UCT]&lt;/ref&gt; finance (or financial management &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.up.ac.za/en/financial-management/article/2077065/postgraduate MCom in Financial Management Sciences - Pretoria]&lt;/ref&gt;) closely correspond to the MSF.  Note though, that these degrees typically place more emphasis on [[theory]] and (sometimes) less on practice.

As above, some MSF and all M.Fin programs overlap with degrees in [[financial engineering]], [[computational finance]] and [[mathematical finance]]: see [[Master of Quantitative Finance]] (MQF). Note, however, that the treatment of any common topics — usually [[financial modeling]], [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] and [[financial risk management|risk management]] — will differ as to level of detail and approach. The MSF deals with these topics conceptually, as opposed to technically, and the overlap is therefore slight: although practical, these topics are too technical for a generalist finance degree, and the exposure will be limited to the generalist level. The M.Fin / MSc, on the other hand, cover these topics in a substantially mathematical fashion, and the treatment is often identical. The distinction here though, is that these place relatively more emphasis on financial theory than the MQF, and also allow for electives outside of quantitative finance; at the same time, the range of quantitative electives is often smaller. Entrance requirements to the MQF are significantly more mathematical than for the MSF, while for the M.Fin / MSc the requirements may be identical.

A [[Master of Financial Economics]] focuses on [[theoretical]] finance, and on developing models and theory. The overlap with the M.Fin / MSc, then, as with the MQF, is often substantial. As regards the MSF, on the other hand, although the two programs do differ in the weight assigned to theory, there is some overlap: firstly, some MSF curricula do include a formal study of [[Financial Economics]];&lt;ref&gt;For example: [http://www1.villanova.edu/villanova/business/graduate/specializedprograms/msf/program_info/curriculum.html MSF Curriculum], [[Villanova University]]; [http://www.owen.vanderbilt.edu/programs/ms-finance/curriculum.cfm Curriculum]; [[Owen Graduate School of Management|Owen GSM]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt; secondly, even where the theory is not studied formally, MSF programs do cover the assumptions underpinning the models studied (at least in overview); thirdly, many financial economics programs include coverage of individual financial instruments, corporate finance and portfolio management, although this treatment is usually less practical. (As regards managerial economics, similar comments apply. The course is taught to strengthen the theoretical underpin of the degree; however, since the emphasis is application, it is not developed.)

The [[Chartered Financial Analyst]] (CFA) designation is sometimes compared to a Master's in Finance.&lt;ref&gt;Recognized by UK [[NARIC]] ([http://ecctis.co.uk/naric/Newsletters/December%202009.pdf December 2009]) as comparable to [[Qualifications and Credit Framework|QCF Level 7]].&lt;/ref&gt;  
In fact, several universities&lt;ref&gt;For example [http://online.sxu.edu/programs/masters-in-finance Saint Xavier University]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;[http://fisher.osu.edu/smf Specialized Masters - Finance]: [[Fisher College of Business]] - [[Ohio State]]&lt;/ref&gt;  have embedded a significant percentage of the CFA Program "Candidate Body of Knowledge" into their degree programs;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfainstitute.org/community/university/Pages/cfa_program_partners_overview.aspx CFA Program Partners Overview], cfainstitute.org&lt;/ref&gt; and the degree title may reflect this: "Master in Financial Analysis" or similar.&lt;ref&gt;For example [https://www.usfca.edu/management/graduate-programs/financial-analysis USF], [http://www.exeter.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/finance/fafm/ Exeter], [http://www.business.rutgers.edu/financial-analysis Rutgers]&lt;/ref&gt; 
In general though, the CFA program is focused on [[Investment management|Portfolio management]] and [[Investment analysis]], and provides more depth in these areas than the standard Finance Master's, whereas for [[List of finance topics|other areas of finance]] the CFA coverage is in less depth.&lt;ref name="ft"&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/db7a4838-1352-11e5-ad26-00144feabdc0.html#ft-article-comments ''The MiF can offer an edge over the CFA''] [[Financial Times]], June 21, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  
(Likewise, several programs have curricula aligned with the [[Financial risk management#Financial Risk Manager|FRM]] / [[professional risk manager |PRM]],&lt;ref&gt;eg: [http://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/programs/graduate/ms/ms-programs/degrees/finance Baruch-Zicklin]; [http://www.suffolk.edu/business/graduate/62683.php Suffolk-Sawyer]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt; or the [[Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst|CAIA]]; &lt;ref&gt;[https://smith.queensu.ca/grad_studies/mfin/the_queens_experience/index.php Queen's MFin]&lt;/ref&gt; note that the so-called "[[Indian C.F.A.]]" is, in fact, a master's degree.) 
A further distinction&lt;ref name="ft"/&gt; — as regards all such designations — is that (most) Masters programs include [[Practice (learning method)|practice]] on, for example, the [[Bloomberg Terminal]], or in building advanced [[financial modeling|financial models]], while [[Training#On_job_training|"hands on" training]] of this sort will not (typically) be included in a [[Professional certification in financial services|professional certification program]].

[[File:Mathgameslogo.gif|thumbnail|Math-GAMES is a transnational project, co-financed by the [[European Commission]] DG Education&amp;Culture under the No. 2015-1-DE02-KA204-002260 ]]

The '''Math-GAMES''' is an educational project in the framework of the program "Erasmus+" by the [[European Commission]], which presents free material for lessons and training of teachers, to teach pupils [[Mathematics]] through [[games]], mostly traditional games like [[chess]], [[checkers]] or [[Nine Men's Morris|mill]].

Partners in the project are participants from [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Turkey]], [[France]], [[Greece]] and [[Cyprus]].

The project "Math-GAMES - Games And Mathematics in Education for Adults – Compendiums, Guidelines and Courses for Numeracy Learning Methods Based on Games" is producing a compendium and a guidebook in 9 languages, which should give the answer to two main questions while rising numeracy in education:

* How can we reduce the number of under skilled adults to promote social integration and participation into our society?
* How can we increase incentives for adult training by using games?
* How can we offer tailored learning opportunities to individual learners by using games?
* How can we provide information on access to the services of adult learning?
* How can we save traditional and famous games in different countries from a loss?

During the project, the project partners will collect real examples, in which playing traditional games could bring low-skilled people out of isolation and helps participating in our society. In this part the mobility of trainers is necessary. In parts normal skilled people will play these games together with lower-skilled persons. The results are the "Math-GAMES Compendium of Famous Traditional Games", which are books in 9 languages (BG, DE, EN, ES, FR, GR, IT, RO, TR).

After that the partners of the project will prove, how traditional games could be implemented in their learning program for a better understanding, especially for lower-skilled people. The result are the “Math-GAMES Numeracy Learning Guidelines” in 9 languages (BG, DE, EN, ES, FR, GR, IT, RO, TR).

At the third part of the project the project partners will prove by doing and testing during real courses and seminars that playing games between people with different skills assist the social integration and thus traditional games will be saved from a loss by transferring it to other people. The result is a "Math-GAMES Teacher Training Course and Seminar", which is held for the next 10 years in different countries. The e-presentation, the seminar and the teacher training course are published in English.

Finally the "Math-GAMES Testing and Evaluation Report" is published. It is a report about the project, the work, the activities during the lessons, the competitions in schools, the meetings and the evaluation. The Math-GAMES Project Report is published in English.
In total the project gives examples of good practice and hints for creating learning courses for using traditional games with normal and lower-skilled people fighting numeracy.

At the end of this project “Math-GAMES - Games And Mathematics in Education for Adults – Compendiums, Guidelines and Courses for Numeracy Learning Methods Based on Games" we have produced  9 compendiums and 9 guidebooks, both are available as printed books and e-books, a website, in which we will present all the material, guidelines for a teacher training course and a detailed report about e.g.:

A big part with a list of different traditional transnational games (photos, game instructions), which can provide social integration. Traditional games can be board games, card games, role plays, acts, folk games involving dramatics, e. g. but not computer games.
A general, more theoretical short part about the theme: “Social integration and participation of lower-skilled people by using traditional games”. It should show learners in adult education, how precious it can be to add games in teaching lessons and offer so tailored learning opportunities to individual learners.
Some example of best practice from the participating countries and organizations, how lower-skilled people are socially integrated by using traditional games (photos and description of the activity, place and country, effects on the people)
Some example of best practice from the participating countries and organizations, how lower-skilled people is getting information on access to lifelong learning services in the local adult education.
A description of the origin of games and their symbolic significance, e.g. games about “capture and release”,  birth, ritual, etc.
Interviews of participating people in their homes, care residences, etc. so that a compendium of authentic testimonies is created. 
“Games in performance” in front of small audiences of people, who are then given the opportunity to interpret the games and to perform them with the lower-skilled participants on their own, with the participants as audience.
Filming, photographing and documentation of parts of the project to upload on our website.

== Materials ==
From 2016 these materials will be developed:
* The Math-GAMES Compendium in 9 languages (BG, DE, EN, ES, FR, GR, IT, RO, TR) is free available from the website www.math-games.eu
* The Math-GAMES Guidebook in 9 languages (BG, DE, EN, ES, FR, GR, IT, RO, TR)
* The Math-GAMES Teacher Training Course in English
* The Math-GAMES Evaluation Report in English

They are primarily made up of Missouri's K-12 schools, colleges and universities, public libraries and government organizations. In addition to maintaining a [[computer network]] for [[Internet]] access to school districts and libraries in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Missouri]]. they also provide technology consulting, a technology help desk as well as professional development and training, consortium discounts and a la carte services by a team of approximately 85 subject matter experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.more.net/sites/default/files/Annual-Report-Final.pdf|title=MOREnet 2016 Annual Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.umsystem.edu/ums/news/news_releases/122309_news | title=John Gillispie appointed executive director of MOREnet | publisher=The Curators of the University of Missouri. | accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.umsystem.edu/ums/news/news_releases/040714_news | title=MOREnet invests and expands fiber infrastructure in southeastern Missouri | publisher=The Curators of the University of Missouri | accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1991, Missouri's four-year public colleges expressed the desire to connect to the NSFnet, a precursor to today's internet. Growth was rapid, but 2002, they connected 509 Missouri public school districts, 64 higher education institutions and 125 tax-supported libraries.

1991: Organization Formed for higher ed primarily to share research electronically

1993:A pilot project with [[Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education]] to include 100 K-12 school districts to include internet connection (which at the time was still an interesting, but unproved concept) as well as hands-on training and technical consultation

1995: The Missouri Secretary of State secured $500,000 for shared online resources available to the entire MOREnet consortium

1997: The MOREnet backbone increased to 45 Mbit/s, which was 30 times faster than the 1993 service

1999: The MOREnet backbone increased to 155 Mbit/s, enabling full-scale interactive video services

2003: The MOREnet backbone increased to 622 Mbit/s

2009: The MOREnet backbone was migrated to a fiber-optic infrastructure to support 10 Gbit/s (10,000 Mbit/s) capacity

2013: Awarded nearly $1 million in grant funding to 3 members for projects designed over a 3-year period to improve outcomes through the adoption of new technologies and STEM based activities, visual learning, business continuity and disaster recovery.

2013: Began a backbone fiber expansion project to bring much needed infrastructure to the un- and under-served region of southeast Missouri

2014: Upgraded network to support up to 100 Gbit/s, making MOREnet one of the first research and education networks in the country to support that speed

== Work Environment ==
In 2016, MOREnet was recognized for exemplary workplace practices from When Work Works&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whenworkworks.org/workplace-awards/missouri-research-and-education-network-morenet|title=Workplace Awards: MOREnet|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a national initiative, led by the partnership for the Families and Work Institute and the Society for Human Resource Management. 

MOREnet practices a modified version of ROWE (Results-Only Work Envioronment).  A management strategy used at MOREnet, where employees are evaluated on performance, not presence. In a ROWE, leadership focuses only on results – increasing the organization’s performance while cultivating the right environment for people to manage all the demands in their lives...including work.

'''Mūza Rubackytė''' (born May 19, 1959) is a [[Lithuania]]n [[pianist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lrytas.lt/-12275301071225879594-p1-kult%C5%ABra-labdaros-koncerte-gros-pianist%C4%97-m-rubackyt%C4%97.htm|title=Labdaros koncerte gros pianistė M.Rubackytė / Kultūra / lrytas.lt|date=24 November 2008|work=Lietuvos rytas|language=Lithuanian|accessdate=28 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201023/http://www.lrytas.lt/-12275301071225879594-p1-kult%C5%ABra-labdaros-koncerte-gros-pianist%C4%97-m-rubackyt%C4%97.htm|archivedate=29 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; currently residing in [[Vilnius]] and [[Paris]]. Rubackytė has been awarded the [[Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas]], Lithuanian Muzes, and has been named as the National Artist of Lithuania.

She holds various teaching positions at a number of educational institutions, including the [[Lithuanian Academy of Music and Theater]] in Vilnius, [[Conservatoire Rachmaninoff]] in Paris, [[Tchaikovsky Conservatory]] in [[Moscow]], Messiaen Academy of Music in the Netherlands. She has also been a judge at the Lithuanian International Piano Competition and International F. Liszt Piano Competition (Utrecht).

A native of Lithuania, Mūza Rubackytė was born into a family of musicians. At the age of 7, she made her professional debut in the capital city of Vilnius performing [[Haydn]]'s ''D Major Piano Concerto'' with the [[Lithuanian National Chamber Orchestra]]. Six years later, she won the first prize in the National Young Artists Competition. The victory opened the doors to the Moscow Tchaikovsky Conservatory, where she studied under [[Yakov Flier]], Mikhail Voskressensky and Bela Davidovitch. During her conservatoire period, she won the first prize in the [[Tallinn]] ([[Estonia]]) Piano Competition and shortly thereafter was awarded the Conservatory's first prize in solo piano, chamber music and accompaniment.

During the Soviet period, Mūza Rubackytė was not allowed to travel outside the [[Communist Bloc]] but performed with orchestras of the [[Baltic states]], [[Ukraine]], [[Armenia]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Belarus]], as well as the great ensembles of [[Moscow]], [[Vilnius]] and [[St. Petersburg]].  She has lived in Paris since 1991.

The '''University college reform''' was a [[reform]] throughout [[Norway]] where 98 smaller [[college]]s were transformed into 26 larger [[university college]]s from 1 August 1994. In addition a number of [[fine art]] educations were merged to two National Academies of the Arts, in Oslo and in Bergen.

==Goal and result==
The reform gave each [[counties of Norway|county]] their own university college, except for the two [[Agder]] counties, who shared one. Some counties have more than one, with [[Møre og Romsdal]] and [[Nordland]] topping with three each. The university colleges were given the main responsibility for training [[nurses]], [[teacher]]s, preschool teachers, [[engineer]]s and business administrators. In addition a number of other tasks were included in the colleges portfolio.

The goal of the reform, that was initiated by the then [[Minister of Education and Research (Norway)|Minister of Education]], [[Gudmund Hernes]] from the [[Norwegian Labour Party|Labour Party]], was to effectivate the operations at the colleges through [[economy of scale]]. Herned had led the public committee that in 1988 had launched the idea of merging and co locating the colleges. The idea was to use teaching resources dedicated to [[academic administration]] instead to be used for teaching and research.

An evaluation of the reform after five years concluded that reform had not succeeded and that the resulting more efficient operations came from lower state subsidies instead of more efficient operations. It also showed that the reform gave the educational personnel more administrative work.

==Other processes==
Two years later the [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]] was created in [[Trondheim]] after a merger of the [[Norwegian Institute of Technology]] and the [[University of Trondheim]], reducing the number of public colleges and universities in Trondheim from thirteen to two.{{Clarify|date=November 2009}} &lt;!-- HiST is counted here, right? --&gt;

From 2005 university colleges were allowed to convert into [[university|universities]] if they met certain requirements. So far both [[Stavanger University College]] and [[Agder University College]] have converted (to the [[University of Stavanger]] and the [[University of Agder]], respectively). Also [[Bodø University College|Bodø]], [[Buskerud University College|Buskerud]], [[Telemark University College|Telemark]], [[Vestfold University College|Vestfold]], [[Hedmark University College|Hedmark]], [[Lillehammer University College|Lillehammer]] and [[Gjøvik University College|Gjøvik]] have announced that they wish to convert to universities, either by themselves or through [[merger]]s. [[Tromsø University College]] ceased to exist in 2009 as it was incorporated into the [[University of Tromsø]].

'''Playcentre''' is an early childhood education and parenting organisation which operates parent-led early childhood education centres throughout [[New Zealand]] and offers parents the opportunity to gain a Diploma in ''Early Childhood and Adult Education''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.careers.govt.nz/default.aspx?id0=505&amp;id1=PC9565&amp;id3=8809&lt;/ref&gt;

When the first playcentre was opened in 1941 the prevailing philosophy in New Zealand child education was that education did not really start until children entered the formal, disciplinarian, school system. Playcentres instead recognised the value of early child education and specifically the educational value of child-initiated play.&lt;ref name="Pam Cubey"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mMBt6f4G9agC&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=karori%20playcentre%20history&amp;pg=PA144#v=onepage&amp;q=karori%20playcentre%20history&amp;f=false|title=Young Children Learning Through Schemas: Deepening the dialogue about learning in the home and in the nursery|author=Katey Mairs, and The Pen Green Team|editor=Cath Arnold|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|pages=Chapter 8|isbn=9781136241291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Playcentre is indigenous to New Zealand,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.playcentre.org.nz/history.php&lt;/ref&gt; but is now also established in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;http://playcentre.org.nz/news.php?a=118&amp;id=&amp;assocID=&amp;national=&lt;/ref&gt;

Their mission is stated as "Whānau Tupu Ngātahi - Families growing together."

==History and spread==

The movement started during the [[Second World War]] to provide a break for mothers as well as means to allow for the social development of the child within a cooperative environment. The first such playcentre was established in 1941 in the [[Wellington]] suburb of [[Karori]].&lt;ref&gt;Densem, A. &amp; Chapman, B.  (2000). Learning together: The Playcentre Way. Auckland: New Zealand Playcentre Federation. {{ISBN|0-908609-36-1}} p35&lt;/ref&gt; From the start each playcentre was a community driven initiative, organised by parents, utilising existing premises (e.g. church or community halls) and using parents as teachers.  This allowed the easy spread of the movement, now encompassing over 450 centres around [[New Zealand]] and explains why they are the dominant provider of early childhood education in rural areas.&lt;ref name="Pam Cubey" /&gt;

[[Gwen Somerset]], [[Joan Wood]], Inge Smithells and [[Beatrice Beeby]] were among the founders of the organisation. 

The Playcentre model has been copied by groups in other countries, including the Japan Playcentre Association.&lt;ref&gt;http://www8.plala.or.jp/playcentre/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Playcentre was instrumental in introducing the concept of education through play and through child-initiated activities to the early childhood setting in New Zealand. This philosophy has since been adopted throughout all New Zealand early childhood education centres through the New Zealand national curriculum for early childhood education, Te Whāriki.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.educate.ece.govt.nz/Programmes/TeWhariki.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  They remain a champion of child-led non-structured play as the best form of education in early childhood.

The organisation believes that parents are the first and best educators of their children and children learn best when they initiate their learning through play (child-initiated play). Within the centres children and adults learn alongside each other, in agreement with the socio-cultural model of learning which posits that a child learns best when surrounded by trusted members of his or her community.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.playcentre.org.nz/philosophy.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Each playcentre is a cooperative. Parents decide how their centre will run and are responsible for the education of their children. Parents also make decisions giving direction to how their association (regional body) and the New Zealand Playcentre Federation (national body) will run.

==Practice==
Children attend half day sessions, no more than 5 times a week.  Children from 0 to 6 years, normally in mixed age groups, attend sessions run by parents - a minimum of 1 adult to four children.  Parents manage all aspects of each playcentre, including the premises, administration, education of the children and education of themselves.

==Structure==
Every centre is part of a regional association. There are currently 33 regional associations,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.playcentre.org.nz/assoc.php&lt;/ref&gt; which provide support and training and are governed by their member Playcentres. In turn each association is supported by the national body, The New Zealand Playcentre Federation. The Federation is governed by the associations and provides support to meet the goals of the associations.

Playcentres are chartered early childhood education providers with the New Zealand Ministry of Education.  Independent research and audits by the Education Review Office confirm the quality of Playcentre's programmes.

==Adult education programme==
Playcentre Education administers the NZQA approved Playcentre Diploma in Early Childhood and Adult Education.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.playcentre.org.nz/education.php&lt;/ref&gt; The course assists parents in developing their parenting skills and their ability to facilitate early childhood education in a playcentre setting. The programme also helps members to learn how to work in a cooperative as well as being the training ground for Playcentre adult educators. The adult education programme is delivered at no cost to the learner.

== "Red October" plot ==
The so-called "Red October" plot is the alleged rumor of ousting President Duterte from the office.&lt;ref name="ro025"&gt;{{cite news |title=Linking critics to Red October destab plot a Martial Law tactic —Robredo |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/668964/linking-critics-to-red-october-destab-plot-a-martial-law-tactic-robredo/story/ |accessdate=September 27, 2018 |work=GMA News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alleged plot was announced by the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] (AFP) on September 24, who said that the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] (CPP), opposition parties such as [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] (LP) and Tindig Pilipinas were behind the planning of the ouster plot.&lt;ref name="ro025"/&gt; One of the opposition being mentioned about the involvement is ousted Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Duterte faces 'Red October' ouster plot - military officials |url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/09/24/18/duterte-faces-red-october-ouster-plot-military-officials |work=ABS-CBN News}}&lt;/ref&gt; who subsequently denied the ousting or removal of the President.&lt;ref name=r1ro085/&gt; Robredo made a statement on September 25, saying that linking the opposition to the plot is a tactic used in the Martial Law and the claim was baseless.&lt;ref name="ro025"/&gt; She and Senator Antonio Trillanes denied the plot involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Communists raise martial law fears over 'fictional' oust-Duterte plot |url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/09/25/18/communists-raise-martial-law-fears-over-fictional-oust-duterte-plot |work=ABS-CBN News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Philippine National Police doubted about the plot.&lt;ref name="ro047"&gt;{{cite news |title=PNP unsure of 'Red October' oust Duterte plot |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/668866/pnp-unsure-of-red-october-oust-duterte-plot/story/ |accessdate=September 27, 2018 |work=GMA News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Makabayan bloc denied the involvement in the plot, though they admit that they will held a massive rally the next month.&lt;ref name="ro062"&gt;{{cite news |title=Makabayan solons deny ‘Red October’ destab plot |url=https://untvweb.com/news/makabayan-solons-deny-red-october-destab-plot/ |accessdate=September 27, 2018 |work=UNTV News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Department of Labor and Employment Secretary Silvestre Bello III said that the plot is just hearsay and he added that ousting the President is impossible as Duterte is being given a strong support by the people.&lt;ref name="ro126"&gt;{{cite news |title=‘Red October’ is just hearsay; no one can oust a popular president – Bello |url=https://untvweb.com/news/red-october-is-just-hearsay-no-one-can-oust-a-popular-president-bello/ |accessdate=September 27, 2018 |work=UNTV News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 25, the NBI and Philippine Army raided the farm house in [[Teresa, Rizal]] where they arrested a Chinese national Lily Ong and confiscated the high-calibre guns. According to the NBI spokesperson Ferdinand Lavin, they still have no evidence proving that Ong and the confiscated guns are connected to the [[New People's Army]] (NPA), as well as the "Red October" plot. However, AFP spokesperson Brigadier General Edgard Arevalo said that Ong is connected to the rebel groups and she used the farm house as a hideout for NPA members.&lt;ref name=r1ro085&gt;{{cite news |title='Kaugnayan sa NPA' ng naarestong Chinese, pinasisilip |url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/09/27/18/kaugnayan-sa-npa-ng-naarestong-chinese-pinasisilip |accessdate=September 27, 2018 |work=ABS-CBN News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 4, the AFP bared that the CPP is allegedly brainwashed the various universities and colleges in Metro Manila to participate against the government through showing the film of darkest years during the Martial Law era. The AFP also had a list of schools which were allegedly involved the plot:&lt;ref name="ro195"&gt;{{cite news |title=AFP bares universities linked to alleged 'Red October' plot |url=https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/10/04/1857187/afp-bares-universities-linked-alleged-red-october-plot |accessdate=October 5, 2018 |work=[[The Philippine Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Robertson Scholars Leadership Program''' is a joint merit scholarship and leadership development program at [[Duke University]] and the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. The scholarship offers participants a unique "dual citizenship" at both Duke University and UNC-Chapel Hill. Approximately 36 students are selected from among the more than 60,000 applications to the two schools each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unc.edu/news/archives/apr07/robertsonscholars041007.html UNC, Duke announce winners of Robertson Scholarships]. UNC-Chapel Hill News Services.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and background==
The program was created in 2000 by benefactor [[Julian Robertson]], a 1955 graduate of UNC-Chapel Hill.

==Program timeline==

===Orientation retreat===
Shortly before the start of first-year fall semester, incoming Scholars participate in a leadership retreat facilitated by instructors from the [[National Outdoor Leadership School]] (NOLS) at the Nantahala Outdoor Center in [[Bryson City, North Carolina]].

===First-year dinner series===
First-year Scholars develop practical life skills and discuss a wide range of subjects with guest speakers. Topics have included public speaking, presentation skills, personal finances, etiquette, and networking.

===Colloquium===
Colloquium is a one-semester course taken during the Scholar's first year. It provides a forum to discuss issues impacting society at large and ethical challenges facing today's leaders. This course offers Scholars a chance to develop an ethical framework for leading and provides a unique, Robertson-only space to strengthen intellectual ties among the class.

===Campus Switch===
During the second semester of their sophomore year, Robertson Scholars live and take classes on their sister campus. The Campus Switch is designed to build stronger educational and community ties between UNC-Chapel Hill and Duke, and to offer Scholars the opportunity to adjust to new situations and thrive in challenging environments.

===Senior Capstone===
The Robertson Senior Capstone Experience is designed to support senior scholars in their transition from college to the next stage of their careers. The Capstone includes a winter retreat and a dinner series that combines reflection on their four-year experience with conversations with Robertson alumni and other young leaders.

==Summer experiences==

===Community Summer===
Scholars spend the summer after their first year living together and participating in community service internships in the United States. Past locations have included [[Cleveland, Mississippi]], [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], and [[Whitesburg, Kentucky]]. This summer is designed to strengthen scholars' relationships with each other and to increase awareness of the social and economic challenges of various geographic regions in the US.

===Exploration Summer===
Scholars spend the summer after sophomore year exploring their academic or cultural interests, either domestically or internationally. Scholars can participate in a university-sponsored program, or they can propose a self-designed project to pursue individually or with other students.

===Launch Summer===
Scholars spend the summer after junior year engaged in an independent, self-designed project intended to focus their interests and launch them into life after college. Projects have included research for honors theses, pre-professional internships, and expansions of work undertaken in previous Robertson summers.

[[File:Prof._Satish_Bahadur.jpg|thumb|Prof. Satish Bahadur]]

'''Satish Bahadur''' (26 November 1925 - 23 July 2010), was an [[India]]n film critic who served as Professor of Film Appreciation (1963–83) at the [[Film and Television Institute of India]], Pune, India, and a close associate of [[Marie Seton]], [[Vijaya Mulay]] and [[PK Nair]].

Until his death in [[Pune]], Satish continued to be actively involved with film appreciation and teaching of cinema. According to the obituary in [http://www.indianexpress.com/news/satish-bahadur-founder-of-film-appreciation/651362/ The Indian Express], he was "...one of the founding teachers of the FTII, he played a crucial role in shaping the policies and vision of the Institute. Even today, he is held in high esteem by his students, some of whom are luminaries of the Indian cinema. Arun Khopkar, filmmaker and student of Bahadur, was quoted as saying, '"...from day one, he became the guiding light in my life. Like a music teacher who explains the intricacies of taal and laya to his students, he would unveil countless aspects of films for us. Unlike many teachers who overshadow their students, he had the knack to bring the best out of his students. In fact, he was the one who started the concept of film diary amongst FTII students. I have this habit of calling the old, good and late faculty of the institute, the ghost faculty. Now, he belongs to that and sitting up there, he will continue to guide his students".

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Moradabad]], he studied at the [[University of Agra]] and the [[Allahabad University]] in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. He was married to Vinodini Bahadur (1928-2016). The couple had a daughter Nandini and a son Apurva (named for the protagonist of [[Apur Sansar]]).

It officially launched on March 14, 2012, with a Day of Engineering at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], and made available to a nationwide audience through a webcast on [[Facebook features#Facebook Live|Facebook Live]].&lt;ref name="gatech-01"&gt;http://coe.gatech.edu/content/stay-it-day-engineering&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2012/mar/HQ_12_043_Bolden_Facebook_Pres_Jobs.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csus.edu/sacstatenews/Articles/2012/03/StayWithItMatsui03-14-12.html&lt;/ref&gt; The webcast opened with a message from President [[Barack Obama]].

Major General [[Charles F. Bolden, Jr.]], [[Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration]], noted the occasion, saying that his message to students is simple: "Stay With It! Stay with your studies. Stay with your research.  Stay with your dreams as you prepare to take your rightful place as the next great generation of American engineers, innovators and leaders."&lt;ref name="wh-01" /&gt;

Congresswoman Doris Matsui addressed students after watching [[Only Won]] perform "I Wanna Be an Engineer" at the Sacramento State Stay With It event. "We need you, the country needs you – and engineering is not boring, it's fun. Engineers dream up, invent and build technologies that change the world. We will continue to lead, but a lot depends on the people who are studying engineering.  … I encourage you to Stay with it – and dream!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csus.edu/sacstatenews/Articles/2012/03/StayWithItMatsui03-14-12.html|title=Campaign Encourages Future Engineers|first=Craig|last=Koscho|date=March 14, 2012|work=Sac State News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stephen Paxson''' (1808{{mdash}}1881)  was a [[missionary]] with the American Sunday School Union.  He is known for starting over 1300 [[Sunday school]]s in frontier rural America with a total attendance of about 83,000&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Paxson, Sunday School, http://www.believersweb.org/view.cfm?ID=149&lt;/ref&gt; and is known as the Apostle to Children and possibly the single biggest influence in evangelizing the [[American frontier]].

==Early life==

Stephen Paxson was born to Joseph and Mary Lester Paxson in [[New Lisbon, Ohio]], one of seven children.  Joseph died when the children were young, .”&lt;ref&gt;Belle Paxson Drury, A Fruitful Life: A Narrative of the Adventurers and Missionary Labors of Stephen Paxson ( American Sunday School Union, 1882), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;  and poverty forced the mother to find other families to take the children in. Stephen was indentured to Harman Fagan with the promise that Stephen would be permitted to attend school at least three months a year..”&lt;ref&gt;Belle Paxson Drury, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;  However Stephen had been born  with a speech impediment and was dubbed “Stuttering Stephen.”  Because of his handicap, he never attended school.&lt;ref&gt;Wesley R. Willis, 200 Years—And Still Counting! Past, Present and Future of the Sunday School, (Wheaton,  IL:Victor Books, Scripture Press, 1980), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; On the first day, he was so excited that he could not get out his name or age.  The children laughed, and the teacher returned him home with a note saying not to come back until he could talk.  He never did receive a formal education, but he was inquisitive and determined, so despite having to work constantly, he taught himself to read.&lt;ref&gt;Belle Paxson Drury, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also crippled and lame throughout life, living in constant pain.  He became a hatmaker and a favorite fiddler for local Saturday night dances.

==Conversion==

Paxson was not a churchgoer nor a professing [[Christian]] in early life, but when he was in his 30’s, his daughter Mary begged him to attend church to help her win a gold star.  He agreed to get close enough to only put his foot in the door, hoping he would be counted for Mary’s prize, but when he got to the door, Mary pulled him inside.  They needed a teacher, and Paxson was pressed into service.  The students read from the Bible and Paxson asked questions out of a book.  Paxson returned.  At first he thought he was a moral man who had no need of salvation, [[Jesus|Christ]] or the church, but after four years of thinking about the instruction in the Sunday school book, he was personally converted to Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Lorella Rouster, Stephen Paxson—Single-Minded Apostle to Pioneer Children, Testimonies of Faith, Sunday School Times/Gospel Herald (Cincinnati, OH:Union Gospel Press, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ministry with American Sunday School Union==

After his conversion in Sunday school, his enthusiasm knew no bounds.  Soon he quit his job as a hatmaker, the family sold their home in [[Winchester, Illinois]] and moved to a simple log cabin home on Hickory Hill in Pike County,&lt;ref&gt;Willis, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; so that he could become a Sunday school missionary.  His salary was one dollar a day.&lt;ref&gt;Rouster, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;  Highly motivated, Paxson worked on overcoming his handicaps.  He learned to walk without showing his discomfort and overcame stuttering by practicing taking a deep breath and then expelling it slowly, accompanied by hand gesturers.&lt;ref&gt;Willis, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;
Traveling on horseback, Paxson traveled and ministered in an area stretching from the [[Great Lakes]] to the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and from the [[Allegheny Mountains]] to the Rockies.  He made a habit of always stopping to visit every child he met, hoping to persuade him to come to Sunday school.  This habit became so ingrained that his horse learned to stop whenever a child was in sight.  Because of this, he has been called “the Apostle to the children” (Willis, p.&amp;nbsp;50)  He kept his mind of the goal of establishing a Sunday school in every community, and he seized virtually every opportunity, talking to parents, town leaders, and children.  His horse, it is said, automatically turned in at every school and church without command.&lt;ref&gt;Rouster, p.28&lt;/ref&gt;

During the winter months, travel was impossible on the frontier, so Paxson used those times to visit the larger towns of the East, seeking to start Sunday schools in each community there, and raising funds for the work of the American Sunday School Union, in particular for furnishing mini-libraries of Sunday school books for frontier communities at half cost.&lt;ref&gt;Rouster, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;  This was no idle time.  Paxson spoke five nights a week and three to five times on Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;Belle Paxson Drury, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

Paxson, hardened to pain through his physical infirmities, endured through many hardships.  He traveled roads that could barely be called such, over 100,000 miles by horseback in his lifetime.  He traveled in all kinds of weather.  One of his favorite sayings was, “A Sunday school born in a snowstorm will never be scared by a white frost.”&lt;ref&gt;B. PaxsonDrury, A Fruitful Life: A Narrative of the Adventurers and Missionary Labors of Stephen Paxson ( American Sunday School Union)&lt;/ref&gt;  He had no guaranteed accommodations in his travels.  He also endured the hardship of separation from his family for long periods.  However, his wife was capable, loving and devoted, and cared well for the children during these absences.&lt;ref&gt;Willis, p.59&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sunday schools he started were Union Sunday schools in which many Christian denominations participated, studying the Bible together.&lt;ref&gt;Willis, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;  His ministry was extremely fruitful.  He once set a record of starting forty new Sunday schools in forty days!   His ministry extended forty years through two generations and brought thousands to faith in Christ.  It is said that one man moved twice in an effort to avoid Paxson and his Sunday schools.  When Paxson showed up at the third place to which he had moved, however, he came to hear his lecture and was so moved that he enrolled himself and his seven sons in the Sunday school and gave the first donation toward a Sunday school library.&lt;ref&gt;Willis, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and death==
In his later years, Paxson retired to the home office of the American Sunday School Union in [[St. Louis]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.believersweb.org/view.cfm?ID=149&lt;/ref&gt;  There, he was placed in charge of the Sunday School Book Depository which fulfilled orders for the mini-libraries for which he had so often raised funds.  He was very strict about orders being fulfilled the same day they were received.  While in St. Louis, he and his family attended Pilgrim Congregational Church and he continued to invite every child he saw to Sunday school.&lt;ref&gt;Belle Paxson Drury, p. 146–147, 149.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also wrote to encourage Sunday school conventions whenever he could not attend.&lt;ref&gt;Belle Paxson Drury, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 1880, the Paxsons recelebrate their marriage of 50 years at their home in St. Louis.&lt;ref&gt;Belle Paxson Drury, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;  Paxson spent time making scrapbooks of his labors and writing letters of encouragement to others.&lt;ref&gt;Belle Paxson Drury, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

Paxson was invalid the last three months of his life.  Several days before his death, when it was evident he would not recover, his son, Rev. W.P. Paxson asked him if he should die, if it was all right.  Paxson replied, “Why son, that was settled many years ago.”&lt;ref&gt;Belle Paxson Drury, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;  He left this message to friends: “I die at my post.  All is clear and bright and peaceful.  No fear, no tremor, but rest, comfort in God.”&lt;ref&gt;Belle Paxson Drury, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; He died at home in 1881.

==Legacy==
In his lifetime, Paxson directly started 1300 frontier Sunday schools and aided in the establishment of 1700 others.&lt;ref&gt;Willis, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Paxson’s oldest son, at age 15 joined in his father’s missionary work.  He went on to establish more than 700 more Sunday schools himself.  Paxson has been called “the most important single influence in evangelizing the American frontier.&lt;ref&gt;Wesley R. Willis, 200 Years—And Still Counting! Past, Present and Future of the Sunday School, (Wheaton, IL:Victor Books, Scripture Press, 1980), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''SSV ''Tole Mour''''' is a {{convert|156|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} [[schooner]]&lt;ref&gt;The square sails alone do ''not'' qualify the ''Tole Mour'' as a barquentine as this ship type would not have a gaff-rigged sail on the foremast. Instead, the ''Tole Mour'' can be considered a topsail schooner with a fore course. Also see its description as a schooner by its builders on [http://www.nicholsboats.com/pdfs/Brochures/S-85%20Tole%20Mour.pdf] ([[pdf]] file)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sail training]] vessel operating in the [[Channel Islands of California]], off the [[West Coast of the United States]].

In her most recent incarnation, she was part of the Guided Discoveries’ [[Catalina Island Marine Institute]], offering [[sail training]], [[oceanography]] and [[marine biology]] education to hundreds of school-aged participants a year.  The professional crew was housed in up into 6 double cabins and 2 master rooms within her 123 feet on [[Deck (ship)|deck]] and {{convert|31|ft|m|0|sing=on}} [[Beam (nautical)|beam]].  Up to 36 youth participants could be accommodated in cabins housing 4, 8 and 10 [[Berth (sleeping)|berth]]s.  Her previous medical requirements provided areas for laboratory equipment, touch tanks, and [[aquarium]]s.

In 2014, the ''Tole Mour'' was sold to Island Windjammers, a charter cruise company operating in the [[Caribbean Sea]].  She underwent a refitting, as well as a name change, and is now known as ''Vela''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecatalinaislander.com/article/catalina-island-tall-ship-sold-caribbean-company|title=Catalina Island tall ship sold to Caribbean company|website=www.thecatalinaislander.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://islandwindjammers.com/sailing-ship-vela.aspx|title=Island Windjammers|website=islandwindjammers.com|access-date=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contest was created by mathematician [[Nikolay Konstantinov]] and has participants from over 100 cities in many different countries.

==Organization==

There are two rounds in this contest: Fall (October) and Spring (February–March) of the same academic year. 
Both have an O-Level (Basic) paper and an A-Level (Advanced) paper separated by 1–2 weeks. 
The O-Level contains around 5 questions and the A-Level contains around 7 questions. 
The duration of the exams is 5 hours for both Levels. 
The A-Level problems are more difficult than O-Level but have a greater maximum score. 
Participating students are divided into two divisions; 
Junior (usually grades 7–10) and Senior (two last school grades, usually grades 11–12). 
To account for age differences inside of each division, students in different grades have different loadings (coefficients). A contestant's final score is his/her highest score from the four exams. It is not necessary albeit recommended to write all four exams. 

Different towns are given handicaps to account for differences in population. A town's score is the average of the scores of its N best students, where its population is N hundred thousand. It is also worth noting that the minimum value of N is 5.

==Philosophy==

Tournament of Towns differs from many other similar competitions by its philosophy relying much more upon ingenuity than the drill. First, problems are difficult (especially in A Level in the Senior division where they are comparable with those at [[International Mathematical Olympiad]] but much more ingenious and less technical). Second, it allows the participants to choose problems they like as for each paper the participant's score is the sum of his/her 3 best answers.

The problems are mostly combinatorial, with the occasional geometry, number theory or algebra problem. They have a different flavour to problems seen in other mathematics competitions, and are usually quite challenging. Some of the problems have become classics, in particular two from the Autumn 1984 paper.

==History==

The first competition, held in the 1979–1980 academic year, was called the Olympiad of Three Towns. They were Moscow, Kiev and Riga. The reputation of the competition grew and the following year, it was called Tournament of the Towns. The Tournament of the Towns was almost closed down in its early years of development but in 1984 it gained recognition when it became a sub-committee of the USSR Academy of Sciences.

==Awards==

Diplomas are awarded by the Central Committee to students who have achieved high scores (after their papers have been rechecked by the Central Jury). Different certificates are also awarded by Local Committees.

==Summer Conferences==
Students performing outstandingly (higher than Diploma) receive an invitation to the Annual International Mathematics Tournament of Towns Summer Conference where during several days they participate in team research projects consisting of the sequence of related problems.

'''UCBLogo''', also known as '''Berkeley Logo''', is closest to a ''de facto'' standard [[Logo programming language]] with its facilities for handling lists, files, I/O, and [[Recursion (computer science)|recursion]] in scripts,&lt;ref&gt;[http://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/logo/programming.html Logo Programming Language at the Logo Foundation website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815065638/http://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/logo/programming.html |date=2013-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=July 2013}} and can be used to teach most computer science concepts, as [[UC Berkeley]] lecturer [[Brian Harvey (lecturer)|Brian Harvey]] did in his ''Computer Science Logo Style'' trilogy.&lt;ref name=csls&gt;''Computer Science Logo Style'', Brian Harvey, MIT Press (3 volumes) {{ISBN|0-262-58148-5}}, {{ISBN|0-262-58149-3}}, {{ISBN|0-262-58150-7}}.  Available [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/ online]&lt;/ref&gt; For [[tertiary education|tertiary level]] teaching, however, Logo has been superseded by [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], and [[scripting language]]s.

==GUI==
UCBLogo has only a rudimentary graphical user interface, so several projects exist that provide a better interface. [[MSWLogo]] and its successor ''[[FMSLogo]]'', for [[Microsoft Windows]], are commonly used in schools in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]].

==Design==
Logo was designed in spirit of low threshold and no ceiling, which enables easy entry by novices and yet meet the needs of high-powered users. Animations require both the ability to draw shapes and to erase shapes. The process is the same, except that in the former a line is deposited on the display device and in the latter a line is removed. Using the turtle analogy, the turtle's pen must paint, and the turtle's pen must erase. The turtle can be set to erase anything below it, using the command PENERASE (PE), while the pen can be set to start drawing again with the command PENPAINT (PPT), in UCBLogo.

===The pen===

[[Image:Ubclogo drawing dash.png|thumb|right|Turtle drawing a dotted Line]] The analogy of a turtle with a pen attached to its tail is often used. The turtle's pen can be lifted and lowered, thus drawing a rudimentary dotted line.

An example code:
&lt;source lang="nasm"&gt;
 FD 20 ; drawing a line and moving
 PENUP ; lifting the pen so it will not draw anything
 FD 20 ; moving but not drawing
 PENDOWN ; lowering the pen so it draws again
 FD 20 ; drawing a line and moving
 PENUP ; lifting the pen so it will not draw anything
 FD 40 ; moving but not drawing
 PENDOWN ; lowering the pen so it draws again
 RT 20 ; rotating right (clockwise) 20 degrees
&lt;/source&gt;

===Data===
There are three datatypes in UCBLogo:
* the word
* the list
* the array

A number is a special case of word.

There is no static typing. The interpreter detects the datatype by context.

There are two important symbols:
* The colon (&lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt;) means ''the contents of''. This is an extremely useful symbol that keeps reminding students that a variable is really some 'place' in memory.
* The doublequote (&lt;code&gt;"&lt;/code&gt;) means ''the word is evaluated as itself'', or ''its value after evaluation is the same as it was before''. This is important.  For users from other programming languages: the doublequote is not paired as opening and closing quotes.

A number is a special case of self-evaluation—it really could be written with a quote. '''2''' is really '''"2'''

Variable [[assignment (computer science)|assignment]] (e.g. &lt;code&gt;x := y + 3&lt;/code&gt;) is handled in Logo with the &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; command, as exemplified by these two equivalent statements:
 make "x sum :y 3
 make "x sum :y "3

&lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; takes 2 parameters, the second of which here is &lt;code&gt;sum :y "3&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;/code&gt; takes two 'parameters' and is an 'operation', thus the calculation is possible.&lt;code&gt;"3&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;:y&lt;/code&gt; takes the contents of the thing called &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;, these are summed giving a number.

The effect of &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; is to place the result into the first parameter. From a programmatical perspective, the first argument to &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; is passed by reference, while the second is passed by value.

====Scoping====
Variables do not have to be declared before use; their scope is then global.

A variable may be declared &lt;code&gt;local&lt;/code&gt;, then its scope is limited to that procedure and any procedures that it calls (a.k.a. dynamic [[scope (programming)|scope]]). Calling a procedure with inputs (the name usually used for arguments in the Logo literature) also creates local variables that hold the argument values.

====Lists====
Logo inherits lists from [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], and they are its primary method of storing vectors. Arrays are also provided.
* Operators exist to convert words into lists, and lists into arrays and back again.
* This data type has the advantage over arrays that it is infinitely expandable. Data are extracted using the operations first, butfirst, last, butlast, butmember, member and item. Data elements are added using sentence fput and lput.
* A list can be considered to be a queue with the operators queue and dequeue, or a stack with the operations push and pop.
* Recursion rather than iteration is the natural method to process lists.

====Control structure commands====
Logo provides several common [[Control flow|control structures]].
There is one [[Conditional (computer programming)|conditional structure]].
* ifelse test [ do_if_true list ] [do_if_false list]

There are three [[Iteration#Computing|iteration commands]]:
* while condition [instruction list]
* until condition [instruction list ]
* repeat number [instruction list]

[[Recursion (computer science)|Recursion]] is Logo's preferred processing paradigm.

====Template iteration====
Logo also provides list-based control structures. The basic idea is of two lists:

 OPERATION [ a list of commands ] [ many data items ]

each of the commands is applied in turn to each of the data items. There are several of these template commands with names like MAP, APPLY, FILTER, FOREACH, REDUCE and CASCADE. They represent four flavours of template iteration, known as explicit-slot, named-procedure, named-slot (or Lambda), and procedure-text.

====Property lists====
A property list is a special list where the odd number items are property names, and the even are property values. There are three commands to process property list.
&lt;source lang="nasm"&gt;
 pprop :listname :name :value ;to add a new pair to the list
 remprop :listname :name :value ;to remove a pair from the list
 show gprop :listname :name  ;to get the matching value from the list
&lt;/source&gt;

===I/O===
Text may be written to the command window (output stream) using  &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; and to the graphics window using &lt;code&gt;label&lt;/code&gt;

The standard commands are &lt;code&gt;readlist readword readchar&lt;/code&gt; with the normal input stream being the keyboard. In Unix tradition the input stream can be changed, so input can come from a disk file. Similarly, output can be redirected.

==Syntax==
Commands may be written on one line, or more. Many commands have mnemonic short forms; for example &lt;code&gt;FORWARD&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;RIGHT&lt;/code&gt; are coded &lt;code&gt;FD&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;RT&lt;/code&gt; respectively. This makes the input less onerous. Anything written after the ; (semicolon) is ignored, allowing the coder to insert comments.
&lt;source lang="nasm"&gt;
 ; draws a square with sides 100 units long
 FORWARD 100
 LEFT 90
 FORWARD 100
 LEFT 90
 FORWARD 100
 LEFT 90
 FORWARD 100
 LEFT 90
&lt;/source&gt;

 FD 100 RT 120 FD 100 RT 120 ; draws a triangle
 FD 100 RT 120

The [[Hello World]] program in Logo looks like this:

 print [Hello World]

===Loops===
There are three loop (repeat) commands; {{mono|REPEAT}} is one. This draws a square.

 REPEAT 4 [FD 100 LEFT 90]

The command &lt;code&gt;FD 100 LEFT 90&lt;/code&gt; is executed four times.
An approximation of a circle can be constructed easily with 360 small rotations and a step forward: {{code|REPEAT 360 [FD 1 RIGHT 1]}}. Loops may be nested, giving results with little effort.

 REPEAT 36 [RT 10 REPEAT 360 [FD 1 RT 1]]
 FD 25
 RT 90

Another example for nested Loops

 REPEAT 36 [REPEAT 4 [FD 100 RT 90] RT 10]

===Functions and procedures===
Each line is made up of function calls, of which there are two types:
* commands (which usually do something—effects—but do not return a value) like &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt;.
* operations (which just return a value, its output) like &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;first&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;readlist&lt;/code&gt;.

A command is similar to a [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] procedure, and an operation is similar to a Pascal function. (See also: [[command-query separation]], where a query is an operation in Logo). A special subset of operations, called [[Predicate (computer programming)|predicates]], which just output the word &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, are conventionally written with a final &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;. Examples include &lt;code&gt;emptyp&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;wordp&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;listp&lt;/code&gt;.
* Expressions can be primitives, or can be defined by the user.
* Expressions can take zero, one or more parameters.

[[Image:Ucblogo.png|thumb|Basic Chair]]

Procedures can be defined on the command line, using the &lt;tt&gt; TO  END &lt;/tt&gt; pair:

 TO CHAIR  REPEAT 4 [FD 100 RT 90]  FD 200  END

However, in some early Logos the procedure is limited to the physical line length of the input device.

All Logos can invoke an Editor, usually by &lt;cite&gt;EDALL&lt;/cite&gt;. In the editor, procedures may be written over many lines, as nothing is interpreted until the edit is complete.

 EDALL

 TO CHAIR
 REPEAT 4 [FD 100 RT 90]  FD 200
 END

The new word is saved into the available vocabulary, but the definition will be lost once the Logo session is over.  Internally procedures are words and in this case, any time &lt;code&gt;CHAIR&lt;/code&gt; is entered, the sequence &lt;code&gt;REPEAT 4 [FD 100 LEFT 90] FD 200&lt;/code&gt; will be executed. The word &lt;code&gt;CHAIR&lt;/code&gt; can be used as a command; for example, &lt;code&gt;REPEAT 4 [CHAIR]&lt;/code&gt; would repeat the &lt;code&gt;CHAIR&lt;/code&gt; operation four times.

 EDALL ;(to enter the editor mode, then the actual procedure)

 TO ERASECHAIR
 PE
 BK 200 REPEAT 4 [FD 100 RT 90]
 PPT
 END

 CS CHAIR WAIT 200 ERASECHAIR

A WAIT delay between the drawing and the erasing can introduce the illusion of motion:
 CS REPEAT 20 [CHAIR WAIT 200 ERASECHAIR PENUP FD 20 PENDOWN]

===Arguments/parameters===
Logo can pass extra information to its words, and return information. The procedure, (word) is instructed to expect something and give that something a name. The colon is used for this purpose. It passes the information ''by value'' and the colon is pronounced as ''the value of''. When the procedure is run with a command such as CHAIR  200, the word :thesize takes the value 200 so when FD :thesize is executed, the interpreter understands ''FD, the value of 200''.

 EDALL ;(to enter the editor mode, then the actual procedure)
 TO CHAIR :thesize
 REPEAT 4 [FD :thesize RT 90]
 FD :thesize
 END
 CS
 REPEAT 9 [CHAIR 50 RT 20 CHAIR 100 WAIT 50 RT 20]

[[Image:Ubclogo function call.png|thumb|Pattern]]

===Other notes===
Mathematics in Logo uses prefix notation, like: &lt;source lang="turtle" inline&gt;sum :x :y, product :x :y, difference :x :y, quotient :x :y&lt;/source&gt;. Infix is also available.

 help "keyword ;(will bring up a full description of the expression).


Logo allows for [[recursion]], the process where a procedure calls itself.

 to spiral :size
    if  :size &gt; 30 [stop] ; an exit condition
    fd :size rt 15        ; many lines of action
    spiral :size *1.02    ; the tailend recursive call
 end

 spiral 10
