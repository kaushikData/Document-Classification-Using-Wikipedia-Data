'''Adolfas Šleževičius''' (born 2 February 1948 in Mirčiškės, [[Šiauliai County]], [[Lithuania]]) is a former [[Prime Minister of Lithuania]].

Previously a manager in a state dairy company, Šleževičius was appointed Prime Minister following the election of [[Algirdas Brazauskas]] as President in February 1993. At the time, Lithuania was faced with monthly inflation of 10–30% despite the demonetization of the ruble and introduction of the [[Lithuanian talonas|talonas]] (coupon money) on 1 October 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Bank of Lithuania, "The Bank of Lithuania", 1994&lt;/ref&gt; After initially promising large wage hikes to state workers, Šleževičius implemented a smaller increase and backed a tightening of monetary policy by the [[Bank of Lithuania]]. This brought monthly inflation down from 25% in May 1993 to 13% in May, 6% in June, and 3% in July.&lt;ref&gt;Knobl, Camard, et al., "Lithuania" IMF Economic Review No. 6, August 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; With this progress in stabilization, the Litas Committee (composed of Šleževičius, President Brazauskas, and Bank of Lithuania President Visokavičius) announced the reintroduction of the [[Lithuanian litas]] as national currency, to take place on 25 June 1993. The exchange rate strengthened from the equivalent of over 5 litai to 3.5 litai by August 1993.

In October 1993, Šleževičius announced that the value of the litas would be fixed in a manner similar to that of the [[Estonian Kroon]], that is, in a currency board arrangement with a fixed parity.&lt;ref&gt;Camard, Wayne, "Lessons from the Currency Board Arrangement in Lithuania" IMF paper PPAA/96/1, March 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The litas Stability Law (Law I-407) was enacted on 23 March 1994, and the exchange rate fixed at 3.9 litai per U.S. dollar on 1 April 1994. The fixing of the exchange rate contributed to large capital inflows from abroad, which helped to finance the modernization of the economy in the years to follow. 

He was forced to resign on 8 February 1996, after a vote of no confidence in the Lithuanian Seimas following charges of corruption. Šleževičius had withdrawn his assets at the last minute from two banks which collapsed. He faced criminal charges regarding corruption and forgery, but after four years of investigation the case was dismissed before reaching a court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balsas.lt/naujiena/182395/isbrido-sausas/rubrika:naujienos-lietuva-politika Išbrido sausas]&lt;/ref&gt; After his abortive political career, Šleževičius turned to private business.

==Forms of asymmetric competition==
*Firm A may compete with B in some markets but not others.
*Firm A competes with B over certain attributes (such as [[reliability engineering|reliability]] and [[design]]) but not over others (price).
*Firm A considers B as a competitor but B does not consider A to be a competitor.
*Firm A does not consider B to be a competitor, however, [[consumers]] see A's products as competing with B's products.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2982">'''BA 9000''' Body Armor Quality Management System Requirements were established by the [[National Institute of Justice]] as a quality standard for [[Personal armor|body armor]]. It specifies the construction and assembly requirements of personal armor for federal, state, tribal and local [[law enforcement]] and [[corrections]] agencies; the requirements of BA 9000 are voluntary (but it is recommended by the NIJ).

Though BA 9000 was written to be in compliance with [[ISO 9001]], the NIJ notes that a company being certified as ISO 9001 is not necessarily certified as being BA 9000-compliant.&lt;ref name="BA 9000: National Institute of Justice Body Armor Quality Management System Requirements"&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.justnet.org/pdf/BA-9000-January-2012.pdf|publisher= National Institute of Justice |title= BA 9000: National Institute of Justice Body Armor Quality Management System Requirements|accessdate=July 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; BA 9000 incorporates all of the standards of ISO 9001, but it also:

* Details the procedures body armor manufacturers need to take to communication with the compliance testing program
* Ensures the accountability of armor by mandating a unique identifier for each piece used
* Management of work areas to reduce any adverse effects on the armor
* Specifies that testing must be done at approved facilities; these facilities must be complaint with [[ISO 17025]]&lt;ref name="BA 9000"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pjr.com/standards/ba-9000 |publisher= www.pjr.com|title= BA 9000|accessdate=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While certification to BA 9000 is not mandated or regulatory, its benefits include:
* Reduced Testing – For manufacturers who are BA 9000 certified, testing frequency can be reduced by half.
* Competitive Advantage – Certification to a standard such as BA 9000 is an indicator of a quality product. This is a great advantage in an industry where quality could be the difference between life and death.&lt;ref name="BA 9000"/&gt;
 
Facilities seeking to become a BA 9000 certification body must, in addition to being ISO 17025-certified, submit to yearly office and an overall audit of the management systems in place. The accreditation is normally for a period of four years.&lt;ref name="How to Become an ANAB-Accredited Certification Body"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anab.org/certification-bodies/become-a-certification-body.aspx |publisher=anab.org |title=How to Become an ANAB-Accredited Certification Body |accessdate=July 25, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729014525/http://www.anab.org/certification-bodies/become-a-certification-body.aspx |archivedate=July 29, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tenants include [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], [[Bank of the West]], [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company|PG&amp;E]], [[Ford Motor Company]], [[SAP SE|SAP]], [[General Electric]], and [[JPMorgan Chase]].

Bishop Ranch and the [[East Bay Regional Park District]]'s [[Bishop Ranch Regional Preserve]] were originally part of a 3,000-acre parcel of land called Norris Ranch. [[Western Electric]] acquired Bishop Ranch in 1955 to house a manufacturing plant. Sunset Development Company purchased the 585-acre parcel from Western Electric in 1978. In 2003, [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] moved its international headquarters to Bishop Ranch.

The city of San Ramon is planning a new 40-acre downtown that will include a public plaza, hotel, independent cinema and a mix of residential units plus a new city hall, library, transit center and office space, to be developed by Sunset Development Company.

[[Image:The Board of Trade.jpg|thumb|The Board of Trade circa 1808.]]
The '''Board of Trade''' is a British government department concerned with commerce and industry, currently within the [[Department for International Trade]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/board_of_trade]&lt;/ref&gt; Its full title is '''The Lords of the Committee of the Privy Council appointed for the consideration of all matters relating to Trade and Foreign Plantations''', but is commonly known as the '''Board of Trade''', and formerly known as the '''Lords of Trade and Plantations''' or '''Lords of Trade''', is a committee of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council of the United Kingdom]]. It was first established as a temporary committee of England's Privy Council to advise on colonial ([[Plantation (settlement or colony)|plantation]]) questions in the early 17th century, when [[English overseas possessions|these settlements]] were initially forming. The Board would evolve gradually into a government department with considerable power and a diverse range of functions,&lt;ref name="BoT&amp;Va"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Olson|first1=Alison G.|title=The Board of Trade and Colonial Virginia|url=http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Board_of_Trade|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Virginia]]|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; including regulation of domestic and foreign commerce, the development, implementation and interpretation of the [[Navigation Acts|Acts of Trade and Navigation]], and the review and acceptance of legislation passed in the colonies. Between 1696 and 1782 the Board of Trade, in partnership with the various&lt;ref&gt;See: [[Secretary of State (England)]] (to 1660)
[[Secretary of State for the Southern Department]] (1660-1768)
[[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] (1768-1782)&lt;/ref&gt; secretaries of state over that time, held responsible for colonial affairs, particularly in [[British America]]. The newly created office of [[Home Secretary]] then held colonial responsibility until 1801, when the [[Secretary of State for War and the Colonies]] was established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C4196 Board of Trade and Secretaries of State: America and West Indies, Original Correspondence], The National Archives&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/records/research-guides/american-west-indian-colonies.htm American and West Indian colonies before 1782], The National Archives&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1768 and 1782 while with the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], whose secretaryship was held jointly with the presidency of the Board of Trade, the latter position remained largely vacant; this led to a diminished status of the board and it became an adjunct to the new Department and Ministry concerns. Following the loss of the [[American War of Independence]], both the board and the short-lived secretaryship were dismissed by the king on 2 May 1782 and the board was abolished later by the [[Civil List and Secret Service Money Act 1782]] (22 Geo. III, c 82).&lt;ref name="BHO3"&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/office-holders/vol3/pp28-37#fnn3 Council of trade and plantations 1696-1782], in Office-Holders in Modern Britain: Volume 3, Officials of the Boards of Trade 1660-1870, p.28-37. University of London, London, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Treaty of Paris 1783]], with the continuing need to regulate trade between its remaining colonies, the independent United States and all other countries, a new Committee of Council on Trade and Plantations (later known as 'the First Committee') was established by [[William Pitt the Younger]]. Initially mandated by an [[order in Council]] on 5 March 1784, the committee was reconstructed and strengthened by a second order, on 23 August 1786, under which it operated for the rest of its existence. The committee has been known as the Board of Trade since 1786, but this name was only officially adopted by an act of 1861. The new Board's first functions were consultative like earlier iterations, and its concern with plantations, in matters such as the approval of colonial laws, more successfully accomplished. As the industrial revolution expanded, the board's work became increasingly executive and domestic and from the 1840s a succession of acts of parliament gave it regulatory duties, notably concerning railways, merchant shipping, and joint stock companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100915133842/http://nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATLN=1&amp;CATID=38&amp;SearchInit=4&amp;SearchType=6&amp;CATREF=BT Records of the Board of Trade and of successor and related bodies], Department code BT The National Archives&lt;/ref&gt;

This department was merged with the [[Ministry of Technology]] in 1970, to form the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]]. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (from 2009 [[Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills]]) was also President of the Board of Trade.  The full Board has met only once since the mid-20th century, during commemorations of the bicentenary of the Board in 1986.  In 2016, the role of President of the Board of Trade was transferred to the Secretary of State for International Trade.&lt;ref&gt;See https://www.gov.uk/government/ministers/secretary-of-state-for-international-trade&lt;/ref&gt; The Board was reconstituted in October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;See  https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41586496&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
In 1622, at the end of the Dutch [[Twelve Years' Truce]], [[James I of England|King James I]] directed the [[Privy Council of England]] to establish a temporary committee to investigate the causes of various economic and supply problems, the decline in trade and consequent financial difficulties; detailed instructions and questions were given, with answers to be given "as fast as the several points shall be duly considered by you."&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Anderson (economist)|Adam Anderson]], [https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=chpPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA294&amp;#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false An historical and chronological deduction of the origin of commerce: from the earliest accounts. Containing an history of the great commercial interests of the British Empire...], Vol. 2, p.294–297 (1787)&lt;/ref&gt; This would be followed by a number of temporary committees and councils to regulate the colonies and their commerce.&lt;ref name="BrCofT&amp;P"&gt;[[Charles M. Andrews]], [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/33313/33313.txt British Committees, Commissions and Councils of Trade and Plantations 1622-1675],(1908)&lt;/ref&gt; The Board's formal title remains "The Lords of the Committee of the Privy Council appointed for the consideration of all matters relating to Trade and Foreign Plantations".

In 1634, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] appointed a new commission for regulating plantations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/17th_century/charter_005.asp **Royal Commission for Regulating Plantations; April 28, 1634]&lt;/ref&gt; It was headed by the Archbishop of Canterbury with its primary goals to increase royal authority and the influence of the Church of England in the colonies, particularly with the great influx of Puritans to the New World. Soon after however, the [[English Civil War]]s erupted and initiated a long period of political instability in England and the resultant loss of productivity for these committees.&lt;ref name="BoT&amp;Va"/&gt;  Between 1643 and 1648 the [[Long Parliament]] would establish a parliamentary Commission for Plantations to take the lead in colonial and commercial affairs.&lt;ref name="BrCofT&amp;P"/&gt; This period also saw the first regulation of Royal [[tonnage and poundage]] and begin the modernization of [[HM Customs and Excise|customs and excise]] as growing sources of government revenue.

During the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] and [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] three acts of the [[Rump Parliament]] in 1650 and 1651 are notable in the historical development of England's commercial and colonial programs. These include the first Commission of Trade to be established by an Act of Parliament on 1 August 1650.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/no-series/acts-ordinances-interregnum/pp403-406 August 1650: An Act for the Advancing and Regulating of the Trade of this Commonwealth.]&lt;/ref&gt; The instructions to the named commissioners, headed by [[Henry Vane the Younger]], included consideration of both domestic and foreign trade, the trading companies, manufactures, free ports, customs, excise, statistics, coinage and exchange, and fisheries, as well as the plantations and the best means of promoting their welfare and rendering them useful to England. The act's statesmanlike and comprehensive instructions, along with an October act [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego|prohibiting trade with pro-royalist colonies]] and the Navigation Act of October 1651, formed the first definitive expression of England's commercial policy.  They represent the first attempt to establish a legitimate control of commercial and colonial affairs, and the instructions indicate the beginnings of a policy which had the prosperity and wealth of England exclusively at heart.&lt;ref&gt;Charles M. Andrews, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/33313/33313.txt British Committees, Commissions and Councils of Trade and Plantations 1622-1675], Chapter II, Control of Trade and Plantations During the Interregnum, p.24 (1908)&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the Lords of Trade who, in 1675, originated the idea of transforming all of the colonies in America into Royal Colonies for the purpose of securing English trade against the French. They brought New Hampshire under the Crown, modified Penn's charter, refused a charter to the Plymouth colony, and taking advantage of the concessions of the charters of Massachusetts and New York, created the [[Dominion of New England]] in 1685, thereby transforming all the territory from the [[Kennebec River|Kennebec]] to the [[Delaware River|Delaware]] into a single crown colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=Charles M.|title=The Colonial Background of the American Revolution|year=1958|origyear=1924|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|location=New Haven and London|pages=11–12|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_colonial_background_of_the_American.html?id=QKlWAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1696, [[William III of England|King William III]] appointed eight paid commissioners to promote trade in the [[British America|American plantation]]s and elsewhere. The Lords Commissioners of Trade and Foreign Plantations, appointed in 1696 and commonly known as the Lords of Trade, did not constitute a committee of the Privy Council, but were, in fact, members of a separate body. The board carried on this work but also had long periods of inactivity, devolving into chaos after 1761 and dissolved in 1782 by an [[act of Parliament]] by the [[Rockingham Whigs]].

==Reestablishment and later history==
[[William Pitt the Younger]] re-established the committee in 1784, and an [[Order in Council]] of 23 August 1786 provided the formal basis that still remains in force. A secretariat was established which included the president, vice president and board members. By 1793, the board still remained in its old structure, with 20 members including the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].&lt;ref name = Emsley9&gt;Emsley 9&lt;/ref&gt; After 1820 the board ceased to meet regularly and the business was carried out entirely by the secretariat. The short name of "Board of Trade" was formalised in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/47/section/65 Harbours and Passing Tolls, &amp;c. Act 1861, section 65.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century the board had an advisory function on economic activity in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and its [[British Empire|empire]]. During the second half of the 19th century it also dealt with legislation for patents, designs and trade marks, company regulation, labour and factories, merchant shipping, agriculture, transport, power etc. Colonial matters passed to the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Office]] and other functions were devolved to newly created departments, a process that continued for much of the 20th century.

The original commission comprised the seven (later eight) [[Great Officer of State|Great Officers of State]], who were not required to attend meetings, and the eight paid members, who were required to attend. The Board, so constituted, had little real power, and matters related to trade and the colonies were usually within the jurisdiction of the [[Secretary of State|Secretaries of State]] and the Privy Council, with the Board confining itself mainly to colonial administration.

As a volunteer, he has created or maintained websites for over a dozen community organizations.&lt;ref name=citylv/&gt;

==Professional career==
A [[Certified Public Accountant]] (CPA) since 1989, Beers founded Las Vegas computer accounting consultants Wilson, Beers &amp; Alu in 1989, and sold it to a large local CPA firm in 2002. This company specialized in PC-based networks with multi-user accounting software. From 2004-2007, he was the marketing director for an outsourcer of HR. In 2009, he started Seale and Beers, CPAs, an auditor of small public companies, which he managed until 2012. He currently consults business owners on their treasuries.

Before becoming a Certified Public Accountant, Beers worked for radio broadcasting companies in [[Reno, Nevada]] and Las Vegas as News Director. At [[KMJJ]] in 1982, he won "Best Miniseries" and "Best Newscast" awards from the Associated Press in the AP's Medium Market California-Nevada-Hawaii division.&lt;ref&gt;Desert Companion [http://www.desertcompanion.com/article.cfm?ArticleID=676 "What About Bob?"], desertcompanion.com; retrieved August 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
In 1998, Beers was elected to the [[Nevada Assembly]], the lower house of [[Nevada Legislature|Nevada's Legislature]]. As Assemblyman representing District 4, Beers served in three regular and three special sessions. He was assigned to the Ways &amp; Means, Commerce &amp; Labor, and Elections, Procedures &amp; Ethics committees of the Assembly.

In 2003, Beers led a group of legislators in opposition to Governor [[Kenny Guinn]]'s tax increases, citing concerns that they might damage Nevada's economy. After several special sessions, Beers' voting bloc failed and the tax increases were passed.&lt;ref&gt;Nevada Business [http://www.nevadabusiness.com/2003/08/black-thursday-supreme-court-judgement-day-threatens-nevadas-future "Editorial on Budget Battle"], nevadabusiness.com; retrieved August 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Beers was elected to the Nevada Senate, defeating 20-year incumbent Republican Ray Rawson who had supported the increases.&lt;ref&gt;Nevada Secretary of State [http://www.nvsos.gov/SOSelectionPages/results/2004Primary/ElectionSummary.aspx "Official 2004 election results"] Retrieved 15 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ralston, Jon [http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2004/jul/15/rawson-beers-square-off "Ralston: reporting on Beers-Rawson debate"], ''[[Las Vegas Sun]]'', July 15, 2004; retrieved August 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beers served in the [[Nevada Senate]] for the 2005 and 2007 Legislative sessions. He was appointed Vice-Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, where he worked on the complex state budget. He also served as a member of the Committees on Natural Resources and Legislative Operations.

In 2006, Beers and his supporters gathered over 150,000 signatures to put a [[Taxpayer Bill of Rights]] amendment (called TASC for Tax And Spend Control) on the November 2006 general election ballot, which proposed that increases in spending greater than the sum of inflation and population growth require an affirmative vote of citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Las Vegas Sun [http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2006/jul/08/tasc-court-battle-looking-more-likely/ "TASC Court Battle Looking More Likely"] Retrieved August 16, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

He ran for [[Governor of Nevada]] in the [[Nevada gubernatorial election, 2006|2006 election]], but finished second in the Republican primary, behind U.S. Representative [[Jim Gibbons (U.S. politician)|Jim Gibbons]], who would go on to win the general election.&lt;ref name="nvsos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nvsos.gov/SOSelectionPages/results/2006StateWidePrimary/ElectionSummary.aspx |title=nvsos.gov |publisher=nvsos.gov |date=2006-08-15 |accessdate=2013-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nvsos.gov/SOSelectionPages/results/2006StateWideGeneral/ElectionSummary.aspx |title=nvsos.gov |publisher=nvsos.gov |date=2006-09-08 |accessdate=2013-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Beers was defeated for re-election by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Allison Copening]].&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, Geoff [http://www.lvrj.com/opinion/27968059.html "GEOFF SCHUMACHER: Beers is an unfair victim of Democratic dirty tricks"].

He was elected to a full four-year term the next year.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

Beers lost reelection to the Las Vegas City Council in 2017, finishing first in the May 1 primary contest but losing the June 27 runoff to Steve Seroka, with Seroka winning 3,979 to Beers' 3,387 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ballotpedia.org/Steve_Seroka#cite_note-linkedin-2|title=Steve Seroka|work=[[Ballotpedia]]|accessdate=August 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Burger Heaven''' is a [[Family business|family owned]] [[diner]]-style [[Hamburger|burger]] restaurant in [[New York City]], established in 1943.&lt;ref name="60 years" /&gt; It is not to be confused with a separate and unrelated ''Burger Heaven'' restaurant in [[Alberta, Canada|Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]] that was established in 1984 and serves [[poutine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burgerheaven.ca/aboutus.htm History &amp; Information @ burgerheaven.ca] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416112806/http://www.burgerheaven.ca/aboutus.htm |date=April 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
__NOTOC__
==History==
The chain started off as ''Beefburger'' on West 57th Street in 1943, but changed to ''Burger Heaven'' in 1974 due to [[trademark]] issues.&lt;ref name="60 years" /&gt; For its 60th birthday in 2003, the chain served 60-cent food, drink and dessert specials.&lt;ref name="60 years"&gt;{{cite web |author=Florence Fabricant |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/30/dining/food-stuff-60-is-long-in-years-but-little-in-pennies-a-celebration.html |title=FOOD STUFF; 60 Is Long in Years but Little in Pennies: A Celebration |date=April 30, 2003 |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to burgers, [[tuna salad]] is a favorite at the "consistent" chain owned by Evans Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Samantha Marshall |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-23533963_ITM |title=Steady diet distinguishes chain Over 60 years, Burger Heaven builds market niche through consistency |date=June 9, 2003 |work=Crain's New York Business}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family tradition continued with the second generation of Cyprus family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Lois Smith Brady |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/03/style/weddings-vows-marguerite-cyprus-and-michael-loucas.html |title=WEDDINGS: VOWS; Marguerite Cyprus and Michael Loucas |date=December 3, 2000 |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the chain operated six locations in [[Midtown Manhattan]] and the [[Upper East Side]], though in recent years some locations were closed and the number of locations in May 2012 has been reduced to 3.&lt;ref&gt;[http://burgerheaven.com/ Hamburger Heaven] Locations&lt;/ref&gt;

Menu offerings at ''Burger Heaven'' include pizza burgers, chili burgers, [[veggie burger]]s, "classic beef burgers" and turkey burgers as well as an array of salads, hot and cold sandwiches such as grilled cheese, tuna melts, triple-deckers, and [[chicken salad]].&lt;ref name="heaven" /&gt; The burgers are served on [[Kaiser roll|kaiser buns]] and the [[Milkshake|milk shakes]] are "paradisiacal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newyork.timeout.com/restaurants/midtown-east/1465/burger-heaven |title=Restaurants and Bars: Burger Heaven |work=Time Out New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York (magazine)|New York magazine]] describes the decor as "nostalgic 1990s-meets-1950s" noting that:

{{quote|There's something about the bright yellow Formica tables, chrome fixtures, banquettes covered in cobalt vinyl, and light blue cloud-mural ceiling that does seem to bring you closer to that imaginary meat-patty paradise promised by the restaurant's name.&lt;ref name="heaven"&gt;{{cite web |author=Andrew Sessa |url=http://nymag.com/listings/restaurant/Burger-Heaven00/ |title=Burger Heaven restaurant profile |work=New York Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2013, ''[[Zagats]]'' gave it a food rating of 17.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zagat.com/r/burger-heaven-manhattan-3 Zagat rating]&lt;/ref&gt;

cVidya was founded in 2001 by Alon Aginsky in the US and saw projects at [[Telecom Italia]] and [[Bezeq]] within its first years.

Between 2004–2010 cVidya became one of the leading vendors in the [[Revenue assurance|Revenue Assurance]] domain with the MoneyMap product suite, with their entrance into Europe followed closely by LATAM, APAC, North America and Africa.

cVidya’s acquisition of ECtel in 2010 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billingworld.com/news/2010/01/cvidya-wraps-ectel-acquisition.aspx cVidya Wraps ECtel Acquisition]. Billingworld.com&lt;/ref&gt; was a major milestone for the company. By acquiring the larger, publicly traded company and consolidating their product portfolios cVidya added the FraudView [[fraud]] management product.

In 2011 cVidya adds [[risk management]] product and announced revenue assurance and fraud management [[eLearning]] courses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telecomasia.net/content/cvidya-launches-elearning-education-center?src=related cVidya launches eLearning education center].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5518">'''Cecil Albert "Ces" Blazey''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|CBE|ED|size=85%}} (21 July 1909 &amp;ndash; 20 February 1998) was a New Zealand rugby union and athletics administrator. During the controversial [[1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand|1981 Springbok tour]] he was the NZRFU chairman and spokesman. He has been described as "one of the most outstanding sports administrators New Zealand has seen" and was "regarded internationally as the leading authority on the laws of the game".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Ron Palenski |author2= Rod Chester |author3= Neville McMillan |title= The Encyclopaedia of New Zealand Rugby |year=2005 |edition=4th  |publisher= Hodder Moa |location=Auckland |page=249|quote= | url= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Hastings]], [[Hawke's Bay]], [[New Zealand]] on 21 July 1909, Blazey was educated at [[Christchurch Boys' High School]] and [[University of Canterbury|Canterbury University College]]. He studied part-time towards a Bachelor of Commerce for two years but did not complete the degree, and played senior rugby in the late 1920s and early 1930s for the university club.&lt;ref name="DNZB Blazey"&gt;{{DNZB|title=Cecil Albert Blazey|first= Julia|last= Millen|id=5b31|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military service==
Blazey joined the Territorial Force in 1927 and was commissioned as a 2nd lieutenant in the New Zealand Permanent Army Service Corps. At the outbreak of [[World War II]] he was rejected for overseas service for medical reasons, and instead was initially posted to administrative duties in New Zealand. He was promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel in 1942 and the following year was sent to the Pacific as commander, New Zealand Permanent Army Service Corps for the [[3rd Division (New Zealand)|3rd Division]]. He returned to New Zealand to a posting in the reserve in 1944 and was appointed an [[Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire (Military Division)]] in 1945.&lt;ref name="DNZB Blazey"/&gt; He also received the [[Efficiency Decoration]].

==Sports administration==
He was a member of the New Zealand Universities Rugby Council for 34 years from 1936 to 1949, later chairman and life member. He was first elected to the [[New Zealand Rugby Football Union]] executive in 1957, and became chairman from 1977 until he retired from the board in 1985. He was a delegate to the International Rugby Board from 1964 to 1986 (chairman in 1965, 1972 and 1985), and was on the board’s Laws Committee from 1972 to 1985.

The decision of the NZRFU to invite a South African team to tour New Zealand in [[1981 Springbok Tour|1981]] attracted international criticism, and Blazey was prominent as the NZRFU spokesman. He had been chairman of the [[New Zealand Amateur Athletic Association]] (NZAAA) from 1966, but stood down in 1981 because of the perceived conflict of interest. He was also a member of the [[New Zeealand Olympic and Commonwealth Games Association|New Zealand Olympic and Commonwealth Games Association]] from 1956 to 1980.

In 1990, Blazey was an inaugural inductee into the [[New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nzhalloffame.co.nz/Inductees/B/Ces-Blazey.aspx |title=Ces Blazey |website= |publisher=New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame |accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in the [[1991 Birthday Honours|1991 Queen's Birthday Honours]], for services to sport, especially rugby.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=52564 |date=15 June 1991 |page=30 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other activities==
Throughout his working life, Blazey was employed by the AMP (insurance) Society. He rose to become New Zealand senior assistant manager, retiring in 1970.&lt;ref name="DNZB Blazey"/&gt;

He also served on various bodies including the National Heart Foundation and the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation programme advisory committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Lambert, Max |title= Who’s Who in New Zealand |year=1991|edition= 12th |publisher= Reed |location=Auckland |pages=61–62 |quote= | url= |isbn= 0 7900 01306 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Blazey died in Wellington in 1998&lt;ref name="DNZB Blazey"/&gt; and his ashes were buried at [[Karori Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wellington.govt.nz/services/community-and-culture/cemeteries/cemeteries-search/details?id=66526&amp;serviceType=Cremation |title=Cemeteries search (cremation) |website= |publisher=Wellington City Council |accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wellington.govt.nz/services/community-and-culture/cemeteries/cemeteries-search/details?id=93601&amp;serviceType=Burial |title=Cemeteries search (burial) |website= |publisher=Wellington City Council |accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1748">A '''Design brief''' is a document for a [[design]] project developed by a person or team (the 'designer' or 'design team') in consultation with the 'client'. They outline the deliverables and scope of the project including any products or works (function and aesthetics), timing and budget. They can be used for many projects including those in the fields of architecture, interior design and industrial design. Design briefs are also used to evaluate the effectiveness of a design after it has been produced and during the creation process to keep the project on track and on budget. Some firms rely on them more than others but there is a move towards greater accountability in the design process and thus many people find them most useful. They usually change over time and are adjusted as the project scope evolves. Often they are 'signed off' by the client and designer at set stages in the project.

A design brief may use the following layout:
# Title page
# Table of #* Past Accomplishments
# [[Problem Statement]]
#* Problem Description
#* Constraints
#* [[Budget]]
#* Time
#* Needs of the Problem
# [[Goal]]s
#* What you plan to accomplish
#** Due dates
# Solution Analysis
#* [[Risks]]/[[Economics|Benefits]]
#* Planned Solutions
#* [[Sketch (drawing)|Sketches]]
# Synopsis
#* Evaluation
#* Conclusion/Summary

{{Accounting}}
A '''dividend''' is a payment made by a [[corporation]] to its [[shareholder]]s, usually as a distribution of [[Profit (accounting)|profit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Distribution to shareholders may be in cash (usually a deposit into a bank account) or, if the corporation has a [[dividend reinvestment plan]], the amount can be paid by the issue of further shares or [[share repurchase]].&lt;ref name = "Simkovic Disclose"&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1117303 "The Effect of Enhanced Disclosure on Open Market Stock Repurchases"], 6 Berkeley Bus. L.J. 96 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Simkovic Owner"&gt;Amedeo De Cesari, Susanne Espenlaub, Arif Khurshed and Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1884171 "The Effects of Ownership and Stock Liquidity on the Timing of Repurchase Transactions"], 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A dividend is allocated as a fixed amount per share with shareholders receiving a dividend in proportion to their shareholding.  For the [[joint-stock company]], paying dividends is not an [[expense]]; rather, it is the division of after-tax profits among shareholders. Retained earnings (profits that have not been distributed as dividends) are shown in the shareholders' equity section on the company's balance sheet &amp;ndash; the same as its issued share capital. [[Public company|Public companies]] usually pay dividends on a fixed schedule, but may declare a dividend at any time, sometimes called a [[special dividend]] to distinguish it from the fixed schedule dividends. [[Cooperative]]s, on the other hand, allocate dividends according to members' activity, so their dividends are often considered to be a pre-tax expense.

The word "dividend" comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word "''dividendum''" ("thing to be divided").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = dividend | website = Online Etymology Dictionary | publisher = Douglas Harper | year = 2001 | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=dividend&amp;searchmode=none | accessdate = November 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

(DK Publishing, 2014, {{ISBN|1465415858}})&lt;/ref&gt; The VOC paid annual dividends worth around 18 percent of the value of the shares for almost 200 years of existence (1602–1800).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mondovisione.com/exchanges/handbook-articles/who-needs-stock-exchanges/ |author=Chambers, Clem |title=Who needs stock exchanges? |publisher=MondoVisione.com |date=14 July 2006 |accessdate=14 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms of payment==

Cash dividends are the most common form of payment and are paid out in currency, usually via [[electronic funds transfer]] or a printed paper [[cheque|check]]. Such dividends are a form of investment income and are usually taxable to the recipient in the year they are paid. This is the most common method of sharing corporate profits with the shareholders of the company. For each share owned, a declared amount of money is distributed. Thus, if a person owns 100 shares and the cash dividend is 50 cents per share, the holder of the stock will be paid $50.  Dividends paid are not classified as an [[expense]], but rather a deduction of [[retained earnings]].  Dividends paid does not show up on an [[income statement]] but does appear on the [[balance sheet]].

Stock or scrip dividends are those paid out in the form of additional stock shares of the issuing corporation, or another corporation (such as its subsidiary corporation).  They are usually issued in proportion to shares owned (for example, for every 100 shares of stock owned, a 5% stock dividend will yield 5 extra shares).

Nothing tangible will be gained if the stock is [[stock split|split]] because the total number of shares increases, lowering the price of each share, without changing the [[market capitalization]], or total value, of the shares held. (See also [[Stock dilution]].)

Stock dividend distributions do not affect the market capitalization of a company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.principlesofaccounting.com/chapter-14/splits-and-dividends/|title=Stock Splits and Stock Dividends Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockdividend.asp|title=Stock Dividend}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Stock dividends are not includable in the gross income of the shareholder for US income tax purposes. Because the shares are issued for proceeds equal to the pre-existing market price of the shares; there is no negative dilution in the amount recoverable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nyse/2015/34-76649-ex5.pdf|title=Exhibit 5, LLC|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- When we (Kinder Morgan Management, LLC) receive additional i-units from Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P., we will issue and distribute an equal number of our shares to all of our shareholders. ~ The number of i-units and shares will remain equal.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kindermorgan.com/investor/kmr_2001_annual_report_financials.pdf U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103082512/http://www.kindermorgan.com/investor/kmr_2001_annual_report_financials.pdf|date=January 3, 2011}}&lt;!--—Open buy orders and open stop
orders to sell shall be reduced by the proportional value of a stock dividend or stock distribution on the day a security sells ex-dividend or ex-distribution. The new price of the order is determined by dividing the price of the original order by 100% plus the percentage value of the stock dividend or stock distribution. For example, in a stock dividend of 3%, the price of an order would be divided by 103%.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Property dividends or dividends ''in specie'' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for "[[in kind]]") are those paid out in the form of assets from the issuing corporation or another corporation, such as a subsidiary corporation. They are relatively rare and most frequently are securities of other companies owned by the issuer, however they can take other forms, such as products and services.

Interim dividends are dividend payments made before a company's Annual General Meeting (AGM) and final financial statements. This declared dividend usually accompanies the company's interim financial statements.

Other dividends can be used in [[structured finance]]. Financial assets with a known market value can be distributed as dividends; warrants are sometimes distributed in this way. For large companies with subsidiaries, dividends can take the form of shares in a subsidiary company. A common technique for "spinning off" a company from its parent is to distribute shares in the new company to the old company's shareholders. The new shares can then be traded independently.

==Dividend coverage==

The most popular metric to determine the dividend coverage is the payout ratio. Most often, the payout ratio is calculated based on [[earnings per share]]:

''Payout ratio = (Dividends per Share (DPS) / Earnings per Share (EPS)) x 100''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/payoutratio.asp|title=Payout Ratio|last=CFA|first=Elvis Picardo,|date=2003-11-25|work=Investopedia|access-date=2018-08-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A payout ratio greater than 1 means the company is paying out more in dividends for the year than it earned.

Dividends are paid in cash. On the other hand, earnings are an accountancy measure and do not represent the actual cash-flow of a company. Hence, a more liquidity driven way to determine the dividend’s safety is to replace earnings by [[free cash flow]]. The free cash flow represents the company’s available cash based on its operating business after investments:

''Payout Ratio = (Dividends per Share (DPS) / Free Cash Flow per Share) x 100''

==Dividend dates==
A dividend that is declared must be approved by a company's [[board of directors]] before it is paid. For [[public company|public companies]], four dates are relevant regarding dividends:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/answers/dividen.htm|title=SEC.gov - Ex-Dividend Dates: When Are You Entitled to Stock and Cash Dividends|website=www.sec.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Declaration date — the day the board of directors announces its intention to pay a dividend. On that day, a [[Liability (financial accounting)|liability]] is created and the company records that liability on its books; it now owes the money to the stockholders.

In-dividend date — the last day, which is one trading day before the ''ex-dividend date'', where the stock is said to be ''cum dividend'' ('with ['''in'''cluding] dividend'). In other words, existing holders of the stock and anyone who buys it on this day will receive the dividend, whereas any holders selling the stock lose their right to the dividend.  After this date the stock becomes ''ex dividend''.

[[Ex-dividend date]] — the day on which shares bought and sold no longer come attached with the right to be paid the most recently declared dividend. In the United States, it is typically 2 trading days before the ''record date''. This is an important date for any company that has many stockholders, including those that trade on exchanges, to enable reconciliation of who is entitled to be paid the dividend. Existing holders of the stock will receive the dividend even if they sell the stock on or after that date, whereas anyone who bought the stock will not receive the dividend. It is relatively common for a stock's price to decrease on the ex-dividend date by an amount roughly equal to the dividend paid. This reflects the decrease in the company's assets resulting from the declaration of the dividend.

[[Book closure|Book closure date]] —when a company announces a dividend, it will also announce a date on which the company will ideally temporarily close its books for fresh transfers of stock, which is also usually the record date.

Record date — [[Stockholder of Record|shareholders registered]] in the company's record as of the record date will be paid the dividend.  Shareholders who are not registered as of this date will not receive the dividend. Registration in most countries is essentially automatic for shares purchased before the ex-dividend date.

Payment date — the day on which the dividend cheque will actually be mailed to shareholders or credited to their bank account.

== Dividend frequency ==
The dividend frequency&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend_frequency.asp|title=Dividend Frequency|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2007-06-07|work=Investopedia|access-date=2018-08-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the number of dividend payments within a single business year. Most relevant dividend frequencies are yearly, semi-annually, quarterly and monthly. Some common dividend frequencies are quarterly in the US, semi-annually in Japan and Australia and annually in Germany.
[[File:International dividend frequencies.png|alt=Typical dividend frequencies for different countries.|thumb|Typical dividend frequencies for different countries shown in a [https://dividendstocks.cash/dividend-calendar dividend calendar].]]
==Dividend-reinvestment==

Some companies have [[dividend reinvestment plan]]s, or DRIPs, not to be confused with scrips. DRIPs allow shareholders to use dividends to systematically buy small amounts of stock, usually with no commission and sometimes at a slight discount.  In some cases, the shareholder might not need to pay taxes on these re-invested dividends, but in most cases they do.

==Dividend taxation==
{{main|Dividend tax}}
Most countries impose a [[corporate tax]] on the profits made by a company. A dividend paid by a company is not an expense of the company, but is income of the shareholder. The tax treatment of this dividend income varies considerably between countries:

===United States and Canada===
The United States and Canada impose a lower tax rate on dividend income than ordinary income, on the assertion that company profits had already been taxed as [[corporate tax]].

===Australia and New Zealand===
Australia and New Zealand have a [[dividend imputation]] system, wherein companies can attach [[franking credit]]s or [[Dividend imputation|imputation credit]]s to dividends. These franking credits represent the tax paid by the company upon its pre-tax profits. One dollar of company tax paid generates one franking credit. Companies can attach any proportion of franking up to a maximum amount that is calculated from the prevailing company tax rate: for each dollar of dividend paid, the maximum level of franking is the company tax rate divided by (1 - company tax rate). At the current 30% rate, this works out at 0.30 of a credit per 70 cents of dividend, or 42.857 cents per dollar of dividend. The shareholders who are able to use them, apply these credits against their income tax bills at a rate of a dollar per credit, thereby effectively eliminating the [[double taxation]] of company profits.

===United Kingdom===
Dividends from UK companies are paid out of profits after corporation tax (Corporation tax is at 20% but decreases to 19% from 1 April 2017 - split periods are pro-rated). Dividend income is taxable on UK residents at the rate of 7.5% for basic rate payers, 32.5% for higher rate tax payers and 38.1% for additional rate payers. The income tax on dividend receipts is collected via personal tax returns. 
The first £5,000 of dividend income is not taxed, however dividend income above that amount is subject to the rate that would have applied if the £5,000 exemption had not been given.
UK limited companies do not pay tax on dividends received from their investments or from their subsidiaries. This is classed as "franked investment income".

===India===
In India, companies declaring or distributing dividend, are required to pay a Corporate Dividend Tax in addition to the tax levied on their income. The dividend received by the shareholders is then exempt in their hands.Dividend-paying firms in India fell from 24 per cent in 2001 to almost 16 per cent in 2009 before rising to 19 per cent in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/dividend|title=Definition of 'Dividend'|website=The Economic Times|access-date=2017-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, dividend income over and above Rs. 1,000,000 shall attract 10 per cent dividend tax in the hands of the shareholder with effect from April 2016.

==Effect on stock price==
After a stock goes ex-dividend (i.e. when a dividend has just been paid, so there is no anticipation of another imminent dividend payment), the stock price should drop.

To calculate the amount of the drop, the traditional method is to view the financial effects of the dividend from the perspective of the company. Since the company has paid say £x in dividends per share out of its cash account on the left hand side of the balance sheet, the equity account on the right side should decrease an equivalent amount. This means that a £x dividend should result in a £x drop in the share price.

A more accurate method of calculating this price is to look at the share price and dividend from the after-tax perspective of a share holder. The after-tax drop in the share price (or capital gain/loss) should be equivalent to the after-tax dividend. For example, if the tax of capital gains Tcg is 35%, and the tax on dividends Td is 15%, then a £1 dividend is equivalent to £0.85 of after-tax money. To get the same financial benefit from a capital loss, the after-tax capital loss value should equal £0.85. The pre-tax capital loss would be £0.85/(1-Tcg) = £0.85/(1-35%) = £0.85/65% = £1.30. In this case, a dividend of £1 has led to a larger drop in the share price of £1.30, because the tax rate on capital losses is higher than the dividend tax rate.

Finally, security analysis that does not take dividends into account may mute the decline in share price, for example in the case of a [[Price–earnings ratio]] target that does not back out cash; or amplify the decline, for example in the case of [[Trend following]].

===Criticism===
Some believe that company profits are best re-invested in the company: research and development, capital investment, expansion, etc. Proponents of this view (and thus critics of dividends per se) suggest that an eagerness to return profits to shareholders may indicate the management having run out of good ideas for the future of the company. Some studies, however, have demonstrated that companies that pay dividends have higher earnings growth, suggesting that dividend payments may be evidence of confidence in earnings growth and sufficient profitability to fund future expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|ssrn=390143|title=Surprise! Higher Dividends equal Higher Earnings Growth|author=Robert D. Arnott|author2=Clifford S. Asness|last-author-amp=yes|work=Financial Analysts Journal|date=January–February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taxation of dividends is often used as justification for retaining earnings, or for performing a [[Share repurchase|stock buyback]], in which the company buys back stock, thereby increasing the value of the stock left outstanding.

When dividends are paid, individual shareholders in many countries suffer from [[dividend tax|double taxation]] of those dividends:
# the company pays income tax to the government when it earns any income, and then
# when the dividend is paid, the individual shareholder pays income tax on the dividend payment.
In many countries, the tax rate on dividend income is lower than for other forms of income to compensate for tax paid at the corporate level.

&lt;!--In contrast, corporate shareholders often do not pay tax on dividends because the tax regime is designed to tax corporate income (as opposed to individual income) only once. (NOTE: This is confusing and/or false information and needs to be cited if it remains. Does "corporate shareholders" in this context mean corporate managers who are also shareholders or majority shareholders/owners or just simple, everyday shareholders?) --&gt;
A capital gain should not be confused with a dividend. Generally, a capital gain occurs where a capital asset is sold for an amount greater than the amount of its cost at the time the investment was purchased. A dividend is a parsing out a share of the profits, and is taxed at the dividend tax rate. If there is an increase of value of stock, and a shareholder chooses to sell the stock, the shareholder will pay a tax on capital gains (often taxed at a lower rate than [[ordinary income]]). If a holder of the stock chooses to not participate in the buyback, the price of the holder's shares could rise (as well as it could fall), but the tax on these gains is delayed until the sale of the shares.

Certain types of specialized investment companies (such as a [[Real estate investment trust|REIT]] in the U.S.) allow the shareholder to partially or fully avoid double taxation of dividends.

Shareholders in companies that pay little or no cash dividends can reap the benefit of the company's profits when they sell their shareholding, or when a company is wound down and all assets [[liquidated]] and distributed amongst shareholders.  This, in effect, delegates the dividend policy from the board to the individual shareholder.  &lt;!-- the winding down distribution applies to some other types of corporations --&gt; Payment of a dividend can increase the borrowing requirement, or [[Leverage (finance)|leverage]], of a company. &lt;!-- this also applies to other types of corporations --&gt;

==Other corporate entities==

===Cooperatives===
[[Cooperative]] businesses may retain their earnings, or distribute part or all of them as dividends to their members.  They distribute their dividends in proportion to their members' activity, instead of the value of members' shareholding.  Therefore, co-op dividends are often treated as pre-tax [[Operating expense|expenses]]. In other words, local tax or accounting rules may treat a dividend as a form of customer rebate or a staff bonus to be deducted from turnover before profit ([[tax profit]] or [[operating profit]]) is calculated.

[[Consumers' cooperative]]s allocate dividends according to their members' trade with the co-op.  For example, a [[credit union]] will pay a dividend to represent [[interest]] on a saver's deposit.  A retail co-op store chain may return a percentage of a member's purchases from the co-op, in the form of cash, store credit, or [[Equity (finance)|equity]].  This type of dividend is sometimes known as a patronage dividend or '''patronage refund''', as well as being informally named ''divi'' or ''divvy''.&lt;ref name="Ace-Hardware-Mar-2001-10-K405"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/1499/202401000003/filing-main.htm |title=Ace Hardware, Form 10-K405, Filing Date Mar 22, 2001 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =May 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Producer cooperatives, such as [[worker cooperative]]s, allocate dividends according to their members' contribution, such as the hours they worked or their salary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trusts{{anchor|Dividends from trusts}}===
In [[real estate investment trust]]s and [[royalty trust]]s, the distributions paid often will be consistently greater than the company earnings. This can be sustainable because the accounting earnings do not recognize any increasing value of real estate holdings and resource reserves. If there is no economic increase in the value of the company's assets then the excess distribution (or dividend) will be a [[return of capital]] and the [[book value]] of the company will have shrunk by an equal amount.  This may result in [[capital gain]]s which may be taxed differently from dividends representing distribution of earnings.


The distribution of profits by other forms of [[mutual organization]] also varies from that of [[joint-stock company|joint-stock companies]], though may not take the form of a dividend.

In the case of [[mutual insurance]], for example, in the United States, a distribution of profits to holders of [[Participating policy|participating life policies]] is called a ''dividend''.
These profits are generated by the investment returns of the insurer's general account, in which premiums are invested and from which claims are paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quote="In short, the portion of the premium determined not to have been necessary to provide coverage and benefits, to meet expenses, and to maintain the company's financial position, is returned to policyowners in the form of dividends."|url=http://www.newyorklife.com/cda/0,3254,10542,00.html|title=What Are Dividends?|publisher=[[New York Life]]|accessdate=April 29, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511213614/http://www.newyorklife.com/cda/0,3254,10542,00.html|archivedate=May 11, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The participating dividend may be used to decrease premiums, or to increase the cash value of the policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=591|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F1hk6UFlsUsC|isbn=978-0-471-22092-3|oclc=    52323583|editor=Fabozzi, Frank J.|year=2002|title=Handbook of Financial Instruments|publisher=Wiley|chapter=24, Investment-Oriented Life Insurance|author=Hoboken, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some life policies pay nonparticipating dividends.
As a contrasting example, in the United Kingdom, the surrender value of a [[with-profits policy]] is increased by a ''bonus'', which also serves the purpose of distributing profits.
[[Life insurance]] dividends and bonuses, while typical of mutual insurance, are also paid by some joint stock insurers.

Insurance dividend payments are not restricted to life policies.  For example, general insurer [[State Farm Insurance|State Farm]] Mutual Automobile Insurance Company can distribute dividends to its vehicle insurance policyholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.statefarm.com/about/media/media_releases/auto_dividends.asp|title=State Farm Announces $1.25 Billion Mutual Auto Policyholder Dividend|publisher=[[State Farm]]|date=March 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9328">{{Contract law}}
An '''exclusion clause''' is a [[Contractual Term|term]] in a [[contract]] that seeks to restrict the rights of the parties to the [[contract]].

Traditionally, the district [[court]]s have sought to limit the operation of exclusion clauses. In addition to numerous [[common law]] rules limiting their operation, in [[England and Wales Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999]]. The [[Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977]] applies to all contracts, but the [[Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999]], unlike the [[common law]] rules, do differentiate between [[contract]]s between businesses and [[contract]]s between business and [[consumer]], so the [[law]] seems to explicitly recognize the greater possibility of exploitation of the [[consumer]] by businesses.

==Types of Exclusion Clause==
There are various methods by which a party may seek to exclude or mitigate liability by use of a contractual term:

* '''True exclusion clause:''' The clause recognizes a potential [[breach of contract]], and then excuses liability for the [[breach of contract|breach]]. Alternatively, the clause is constructed in such a way it only includes reasonable care to perform duties on one of the parties.
* '''Limitation clause:''' The clause places a limit on the amount that can be claimed for a [[breach of contract]], regardless of the actual loss.
* '''Time limitation:''' The clause states that an action for a claim must be commenced within a certain period of time or the cause of action becomes extinguished.

==Term Must be Incorporated==
The [[court]]s have traditionally held that exclusion clauses only operate if they are actually part of the [[contract]]. There seem to be three methods of incorporation:

* '''Incorporation by signature:''' according to ''[[L'Estrange v Graucob]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1934] 2 KB 394&lt;/ref&gt; if the clause is written on a document which has been signed by all parties, then it is part of the [[contract]]. If a document has not been signed, any exception clause which it contains will only be incorporated if the party relying on the clause (the 'proferens') can show that he took reasonable steps to bring it to the attention of the other party before the contract was made. In somewhat of a contradiction, that is not to say that the proferens actually has to show that the other person read the clause or understood it (except where the clause is particularly unusual or onerous). It is not even necessary to show that the attention of that particular person was actually drawn to it. It is somewhat like the 'reasonable man' test in tort: the party trying to rely on the clause needs to take reasonable steps to bring it to the attention of the reasonable person.
* '''Incorporation by notice:''' the general rule, as provided in ''[[Parker v SE Railway]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1877) 4 CPD 416&lt;/ref&gt; is that an exclusion clause will have been incorporated into the [[contract]] if the person relying on it took reasonable steps to draw it to the other parties' attention. ''[[Thornton v Shoe Lane Parking]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1971] 2 WLR 585&lt;/ref&gt; seems to indicate that the wider the clause, the more the party relying on it will have had to have done to bring it to the other parties' attention. The notice must be given before formation of the [[contract]] as illustrated in ''[[Olley v Marlborough Court Ltd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1949] 1 All ER 127&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Incorporation by previous course of dealings:''' according to ''[[McCutcheon v David MacBrayne Ltd]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1964] 1 WLR 125&lt;/ref&gt; terms (including exclusion clauses) may be incorporated into a [[contract]] if course of dealings between the parties were "regular and consistent". What this means usually depends on the facts, however, the [[court]]s have indicated that equality of bargaining power between the parties may be taken into account.

==Judicial Control of Exclusion Clauses==

===Strict Literal Interpretation===
For an exclusion clause to operate, it must cover the [[breach of contract|breach]] (assuming there actually is a breach of contract). If there is, then the type of liability arising is also important. Generally, there are two varieties of [[Legal liability|liability]]: [[strict liability]] (liability arising due to a state of affairs without the party at breach necessarily being at fault) and liability for [[negligence]] (liability arising due to fault).

The [[court]]s have a tendency of requiring the party relying on the clause to have drafted it properly so that it exempts them from the liability arising, and if any ambiguity is present, the courts usually interpret it strictly against the party relying on the clause.

As espoused in ''Darlington Futures Ltd v Delco Australia Pty Ltd'',&lt;ref&gt;(1986) 161 CLR 500&lt;/ref&gt; the meaning of an exclusion clause is construed in its ordinary and natural meaning in the context. Although we construe the meaning much like any other ordinary clause in the [[contract]], we need to examine the clause in light of the contract as a whole. Exclusion clauses should not be subject to a strained construction in order to reduce the ambit of their operation.&lt;ref&gt;[1986] HCA 82&lt;/ref&gt; The judge in ''[[R&amp;B Customs Brokers Co Ltd v United Dominions Trust Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1988] 1 All ER 847&lt;/ref&gt; refused to allow an exemption clause, of which did cover the nature of the [[implied term]], on the grounds that it did not make specific and explicit reference to that [[Contractual Term|term]].&lt;ref&gt;The term in question was the implied term as to fitness-to-purpose pursuant to the Sale of Goods Act 1979 s14(3).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contra Proferentem===
If, after attempting to construe an exclusion clause (or indeed any other contractual term) in accord with its ordinary and natural meaning of the words, there is still ambiguity then (if the clause was imposed by one party upon the other without negotiation) the [[contra proferentem]] rule applies. Essentially this means that the clause will be construed against the interests of the person who proposed its inclusion. that is to say, [[wiktionary:contra|''contra'']] (against) the [[wiktionary:proferens|''proferens'']] (proposer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|82|1986|litigants=Darlington Futures Ltd v Delco Australia Pty Ltd |parallelcite=(1986) 161 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 500 |courtname=auto |date=16 December 1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Contractual Term|terms]] of [[negligence]], the [[court]]s have taken the approach that it is unlikely that someone would enter into a [[contract]] that allows the other party to evade fault based [[Legal liability|liability]]. As a result, if a party wishes exempt his liability for negligence, he must make sure that the other parties understand that. The decision in ''Canada SS Lines Ltd v. The King''&lt;ref&gt;[1952] AC 192&lt;/ref&gt; held that:
* If the exclusion clauses mention "negligence" explicitly, then liability for negligence is excluded.
* If "negligence" is not mentioned, then liability for negligence is excluded only if the words used in the exclusion clause are wide enough to exclude liability for negligence. If there is any ambiguity, then the contra proferentem rule applies.
* If a claim on another basis can be made other than that of negligence, then it covers that basis instead.

In [[Australia]], the ''four corners rule'' has been adopted in preference over the idea of a "fundamental breach".&lt;ref name="Sydney City Council v West"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|68|1965|litigants=Sydney City Council v West (Ticket case) |parallelcite=(1965) 114 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 481 |courtname=auto |date=16 December 1965}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The court will presume that parties to a contract will not exclude liability for losses arising from acts not authorised under the contract. However, if acts of negligence occur during authorised acts, then the exclusion clauses shall still apply;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|44|1954|litigants=Davis v Pearce Parking Station Pty Ltd}}: Clear words are necessary to exclude liability for negligence.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TNT v May &amp; Barker"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|46|1966|litigants=Thomas National Transport (Melbourne) Pty Ltd v May &amp; Baker (Australia) Pty Ltd |parallelcite=(1966) 115 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 353 |courtname=auto |date=10 August 1966}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the contract is for the carriage of goods, if the path is deviated from what was agreed, any exclusion clauses no longer apply.&lt;ref name="TNT v May &amp; Barker"/&gt;

In Australia, exclusion clauses have been recognised as valid by the High Court. They do not apply in cases of deliberate breach.

==Statutory Control==
Even if terms are incorporated into the [[contract]] and so would be effective, there are various statutory controls over the types of [[Contractual Term|term]]s that may have legal effect. The [[Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977]] renders many exemption clauses ineffective. The [[Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999]] provide further [[Consumer Protection|protection for consumers]].

'''Ignjat Granitz''' (born '''Ignatz Granitz'''; 1845 &amp;ndash; 17 December 1908) was a [[Croatian people|Croatian]] [[Jew]]ish industrialist, philanthropist and publisher.&lt;ref name="žz"&gt;{{harvtxt|Snješka Knežević|2011|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and family==
[[File:Granitz house.JPG|thumb|Granitz house]]
Granitz was born in [[Kemenesmagasi]], [[Hungary]], to a poor peasant Jewish family. In 1864, Granitz finished [[teacher training college]] in [[Győr]]. He attended rabbinical school in [[Bratislava]], but soon quit the education because of his liberal views. Granitz worked as a teacher in [[Sárvár]], and later in [[Nagykanizsa]]. In Nagykanizsa he meet his future wife Paula ([[Married and maiden names|née]] Deutsch), with whom he moved to [[Zagreb]] in 1869. In 1870, Granitz married Paula, and together they had four daughters, Olga, Zlata, Štefanija and Janka. Olga and Zlata later married two Jewish brothers, Ernest and Rikard Schulz. 

"Granitz house" was a three story house which was built for the Granitz family in 1886 by architect [[Hermann Bollé]]. Granitz and his family were philanthropists as they often aided poor and needy, organizing charity fundraisers. He was an active member of the Israelites Zagreb community.&lt;ref name="hakol"&gt;{{hr icon}} Ha-Kol (Glasilo Židovske zajednice u Hrvatskoj); Snješka Knežević; Ignjat Granitz i (srušena) kuća Granitz; stranica 28; broj 111, listopad / rujan 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Granitz died on 17 December 1908 in Zagreb and was buried at the [[Mirogoj Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Gradska groblja Zagreb: Ignjat Granitz, Mirogoj Ž-1-I-52&lt;/ref&gt; His wife died in 1917.

The Granitz family lived in the "Granitz house" until the [[Nazi]] occupation of Zagreb and [[Independent State of Croatia]] establishment in 1941. Independent State of Croatia regime seized all the assets of the Granitz family, including their house. His daughter Olga ([[Married and maiden names|married]] Schulz) was killed on the street amid Zagreb by unknown [[Ustaše|Ustaša]]. Second daughter Zlata ([[Married and maiden names|married]] Schulz) killed herself when [[Gestapo]] came for her. Third daughter Štefanija survived the war hiding in [[Netherlands]], and fourth daughter Janka ([[Married and maiden names|married]] [[Slavko Wolf|Wolf]]) was arrested by Ustaše and later freed by her son, Pavao Vuk-Pavlović, former students. Granitz's grandchildren, sons in law and most family members had been killed during the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]. After the war, in the newly established [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]], Granitz properties were not returned to the surviving members of his family.&lt;ref name="ždvp"&gt;{{harvtxt|Milan Polić|2001|pp=13–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In Zagreb, where he moved from Hungary, Granitz meet his future business partner Lavoslav Hartman. At first, Granitz was employed at Hartman printing office, and in 1878 they established the joint company "Hartman &amp; Granitz". After Hartmans death, Granitz and his new business partner, Vilim Schwartz, paid out the Hartman widow, and in 1882 they formed the new company called "Ignjat Granitz &amp; Comp.". Skillfully using social connections and trading skills, Granitz rapidly expanded his business with new and modern printing machines. In 1883, "Ignjat Granitz &amp; Comp." became the first Croatian printer of school books in the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]]. "Ignjat Granitz &amp; Comp." also published "Agramer Zeitung", newspapers on German published from 1848 to 1912. Granitz was among the founders of the paper factory "Zagrebačka tvornica papira" in 1895, member of the "Croatian-Slavonian commercial bank", member of the "Commercial Chamber" and one of founding members of the "Industrialists Union" of Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia. Later in life, he was named the honorary life Vice President of the "Industrialists Union".

The '''Institute of Certified Public Accountants in Ireland''' (CPA Ireland) is a [[professional body]] for [[Certified Public Accountant]]s (CPAs) in Ireland. It is one of the main Irish [[accountancy]] bodies, with 5,000 members and students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Numbers add up to top accountancy award|url=http://www.newrossstandard.ie/lifestyle/numbers-add-up-to-top-accountancy-award-2983850.html|accessdate=25 July 2012|newspaper=[[New Ross Standard]]|date=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CPA designation is the most commonly used designation worldwide for professional accountants. One million qualified accountants worldwide are CPAs. CPA Ireland was founded in 1926 and its members work in accountancy firms, the public sector, the financial services, and other private sector businesses.

The institute is a member of the [[Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies – Ireland]] (CCAB&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;I), a founding member of the [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifac.org/about-ifac/organization-overview/history/founding-members Founding Members], IFAC&lt;/ref&gt; and a member of the Fédération des Experts Comptables Européens (FEE), the representative organisation for the profession in Europe.

CPA Ireland has headquarters in Dublin and Belfast.

== History of CPA Ireland ==
The Institute of Certified Public Accountants in Ireland was founded as the Irish Association of Accountants on 11 March 1926 and then went on to join with the Irish Society of Public Accountants, originally incorporated 29 January 1943. This amalgamation, in 1964, blended the two bodies to become the CPA Ireland we have today. 
The first CPA exams for election to membership were held in November 1926 and CPA Ireland today represents 5000 members and students.
[[File:Harcourt Street Headquarters.jpg|thumb|CPA Ireland Headquarters in Dublin.]]

In 1961 the Society of Public Accountants gained legal recognition and changed its name to The Irish Society of Certified Public Accountants Ltd; this was changed again in 1971 to The Institute of Certified Public Accountants in Ireland.

The institute was invited to join the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies – Ireland in 1991.

CPA Ireland held merger discussions with the 20,000-member [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland]] in 2001 and again in 2003, but on both occasions the respective Councils of each body decided not to proceed to a vote of members on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Irish institutes' merger called off|url=http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/news/1764442/irish-institutes-merger-called|accessdate=25 July 2012|newspaper=Accountancy Age|date=4 February 2004|author=Gavin Hinks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Council of the institute ==
[[File:CPA Officer Group.jpg|thumb|CPA Ireland's newly elected officer group for 2016, from left to right: Nano Brennan, president, Cormac Mohan, vice president and Deirdre Kiely, vice president.]]
The council of the institute is made up of 16 elected members and up to three non-members, including the president and vice presidents of the institute. The council meets approximately eight times a year to set policy on areas like the regulation of members in the public interest, the growth and development of the institute and examination and training standards.

The office-holders for 2016/2017 are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpaireland.ie/media-publications/institute-news/2014/05/06/cpa-ireland-elects-new-officer-group Office-holders for 2013/2014]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Nano Brennan (president)
* Deirdre Kiely (vice president)
* Cormac Mohan (vice president)

== Qualification ==
Students do not need a business or accountancy-related degree to become an accountant; CPA students include school-leavers, mature students and graduates. Previous qualifications may entitle students to exemptions.

Students can study at 16 approved educators around Ireland. There is no registration fee required and students can avail themselves of full-time, part-time, distance, weekend and e-learning options.

There are four stages of examinations with the CPA Institute; Formation 1 and 2 and Professional 1 and 2.
Students must complete three years of training to apply for membership of the CPA. Training can take place in practice, industry or both. Students may first study for the CPA exams and obtain the required training at a later date.

=== Practice ===
CPA Members who wish to engage in public practice must hold a practising certificate, which requires completion of a Practice Orientation Course and examination, and two years' experience in their intended practice area after admission to membership.

=== Audit ===
To be eligible to act as an [[financial audit|auditor]], CPA members must hold an audit certificate, requiring a practising certificate and an audit qualification. To obtain this, members must have three years' experience supervised by a registered auditor.

As the institute is a recognised body, it has a statutory obligation to oversee the professional activities of its members in practice, ensuring that education and training standards are maintained.

"The role of the institute is to:
* regulate CPAs in accordance with the law and the institute's code of ethics in the public interest,
* ensure that CPAs are constantly up to date in all matters relating to their professional work,
* maintain the highest levels of educational standards for new entrants to the profession, and 
* represent the interests of our members where appropriate."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpaireland.ie/displaycontent.aspx?nodeid=81&amp;groupID=81&amp;parentID=0 Institute home page]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena''' is a multi-purpose [[arena]] located in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], [[Florida]]. 

It was built in 2003 as part of the [[Better Jacksonville Plan]] to replace the outdated [[Jacksonville Coliseum|coliseum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schoolcraft |first=Lisa R. |last2= |first2= |date=November 27, 2001 |title=Construction begins on sports arena  |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/jacksonville/stories/2001/11/26/daily21.html |journal=[[Jacksonville Business Journal]] |publisher=[[American City Business Journals]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |accessdate=December 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field is titled Sea Best Field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Sharks to Play on Sea Best Field |url=http://jaxsharks.com/news/index.html?article_id=30 |location=Jacksonville, Florida |publisher=Infinity Sports and Entertainment |agency= |date=April 9, 2010 |accessdate=December 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
The arena was designed, using state-of-the-art techniques, to have the acoustical characteristics necessary for concerts.&lt;ref&gt;Sources for construction:

Since that time, dozens of groups, including country, rap, rock, and others, have performed at the arena.

In 2006, a scheduled [[Dixie Chicks]] concert was cancelled, due to lack of ticket sales, which was seen as part of the general backlash against the group's comments on the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mp3.com/news/stories/4903.html |title=Dixie Chicks remain defiant |last1=Welte |first1=James |last2= |first2= |date=June 13, 2006 |website=MP3 Music News |publisher=[[CNET]] |accessdate=December 4, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929135812/http://www.mp3.com/news/stories/4903.html |archivedate=September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sporting events hosted include the [[United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 USA Men's Olympic]] [[Basketball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|basketball team]] in their only game played in the [[United States]], as well as the first, second and third rounds of the [[2006 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2006]], [[2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2010]], and [[2015 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2015]] NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament.

On October 17, 2006 an episode of [[ECW (WWE)|ECW on Sci-Fi]] was held in the arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/ecw-wwe/061017.html|title=ECW on Sci-Fi: October 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, [[WWE]] held the Pay-Pay view event [[One Night Stand (2007)]] in the arena and as of 2017 it has been their first and only major event to be held in the arena. However, a WWE Raw episode was held on August 6, 2018.

The arena found huge success when the arena became the home of the Jacksonville Sharks in 2010 when they were introduced as an expansion team of the Arena Football League. The team was founded by former Orlando Predators executive Jeff Bouchy who is also the brother of former Orlando Predators owner Brett Bouchy. The Sharks have recently generated the highest attendance for a tenant in the arena's history.

It was the host for the [[Davis Cup]] first round tie between the US and Brazil on the weekend of February 1–3, 2013. It has also hosted [[Professional Bull Riders|PBR]] [[Built Ford Tough Series]] events in the past.

In 2016, [[Rihanna]] opened her [[Anti World Tour]] here. The event had an audience of 11,000 people.

==Tenants==
Currently, the arena is home to the [[Jacksonville Sharks]] of the [[National Arena League]], the [[Jacksonville Giants]] of the [[American Basketball Association (2000-)|American Basketball Association]], and the [[Jacksonville Icemen]] of the [[ECHL]].&lt;ref name = "JvilleIceMen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firstcoastnews.com/sports/press-conference-set-to-announce-jacksonville-hockey-team/403573454 |title=Meet the Jacksonville Icemen, our new hockey team |publisher=''[[WTLV]]'' |date=February 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also hosted the [[2011 ABA All-Star Game]], which took place on February 26, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2010-2011 ABA All-Star Game Awarded to Jacksonville, Florida|first=Gianni|last=Pascucci|url=http://www.usbasket.com/ABA/basketball.asp?NewsID=209628|work=US Basket|date=November 23, 2010|accessdate=March 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arena was home to the [[Jacksonville Barracudas]] [[ice hockey]] team from 2003 to 2007 until they relocated to a smaller hockey arena in the area. In 2012, it was home to the [[Jacksonville Bullies]] of the [[Professional Lacrosse League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jacksonville's First Professional, Indoor Lacrosse Team to Launch in September|first=Jennifer|last=Ferry|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/jacksonville/news/2012/07/26/jacksonvilles-first-professional.html|newspaper=[[American City Business Journals|Jacksonville Business Journal]]|date=July 26, 2012|accessdate=March 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its athletic tenants, the arena is also host to the annual graduation ceremonies of the area high schools.

He has also served as a senior fellow at Hoover Institution (1978-1987) and the director of the Scandinavian Consortium for Organizational Research (Scancor)(1989-1999).

He has been elected to the [[National Academy of Science]],&lt;ref name="stanfordbio"/&gt; the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]],&lt;ref name="stanfordbio"/&gt; and the [[National Academy of Education]],&lt;ref name="stanfordbio"/&gt; and has been a member of the [[National Science Board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/nsb/documents/2000/nsb00215/nsb50/former.html|title=NSF: NSB 50th Anniversary|last=|first=|date=|website=National Science Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=October 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kva.se/en/contact/Kontakt-sida/?personId=660|title=The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences: James G. March|accessdate=November 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnva.no/c26849/artikkel/vis.html?tid=40112|title=Gruppe 7: Samfunnsfag (herunder sosiologi, statsvitenskap og økonomi)|trans-title=Group 7: Social sciences (including sociology, political science and economics)|publisher=[[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=January 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has received numerous teaching awards such as the Walter J. Gores Award for Excellence in Teaching in 1995 from Stanford University.&lt;ref name="stanfordbio"/&gt; He interacts and communicates in many different forms as books, articles, interactive seminars, films and poetry.

==Contributions==
March is highly respected for his broad theoretical perspective which combined theories from [[psychology]] and other [[behavioural sciences]]. As a core member of the [[Carnegie School]], he collaborated with the [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive psychologist]] [[Herbert A. Simon]] on several works on [[organization theory]].&lt;ref&gt;March, James G. and Herbert Simon, ''Organizations'', John Wiley and Sons, 1958, {{ISBN|0-471-56793-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

March is also known for his seminal work on the behavioural perspective on the [[theory of the firm]] along with [[Richard Cyert]] (1963).{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

In 1972, March worked together with [[Johan Olsen]] and [[Michael D. Cohen (academic)|Michael D. Cohen]] on the systemic-anarchic perspective of organizational decision making known as the [[Garbage Can Model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Garbage Can Model of Organizational Choice|first1=Michael D. |last1=Cohen|authorlink1=Michael D. Cohen (academic) |first2=James G. |last2=March|authorlink2=James G. March|first3=Johann P.|last3=Olsen|authorlink3=Johan Olsen |journal=Administrative Science Quarterly|issue=l|year=1972 |jstor=2392088 |doi=10.2307/2392088 |volume=17 |pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scope of his academic work is broad, but focused on understanding how decisions happen in individuals, groups, organizations, companies and society. He explores factors that influences decision making, such as risk orientation, leadership and the ambiguity of the present and the past; politics and vested interests by stakeholders; the challenges of giving and receiving advice; the challenges of organizational and individual learning and the challenges of balancing exploration and exploitation in organizations.

'''John Dent''' (1821–1892) was an English merchant of the then prominent trading firm [[Dent &amp; Co.]] and member of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] and Chairman of the [[Shanghai Municipal Council]].

==Biography==
John was born in 1821 in the Far East merchant family. His uncle Thomas Dent started the [[Dent &amp; Co.]] in [[Guangzhou|Canton]] in the 1820s and his two other uncles [[Lancelot Dent|Lancelot]] and Wilkinson Dent were the heads of the firm&lt;ref name="familiy"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=61647&amp;back=|publisher=Oxford University Press|first=Philip K.|last=Law|title=Dent family (per. c.1820–1927)|journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led to the firm into one of the largest [[hong (business)|hongs]] in China and early colonial Hong Kong.

John Dent joined Dent &amp; Co. and became the senior partner of the firm. In 1863, he was elected the third chairman of the [[Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce]]. He played a leading role in the establishment of the [[Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Company]]&lt;ref name="familiy"/&gt; and was one of the proprietors when the bank was incorporated in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Hongkong Government Gazette|date=25 July 1866|url=http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/hkgro/view/g1866/713501.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to London in 1864 with a fortune of about £800,000, which he amassed in China, and joined the formation of the Blakely Ordnance Company and became the chairman of the firm with the capital of £120 000.&lt;ref name="Argus"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|location=Melbourne|date=12 January 1867|page=1|title=The English November Mail per Bombay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Dent was appointed an unofficial [[Justice of the Peace]] in 1844. In 1857, he was appointed member of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Hongkong Government Gazette|number=30|volume=3|date=26 December 1857|url=http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/hkgro/view/g1857/724386.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned from the office in 1861 and replaced by [[Francis Chomley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Hongkong Government Gazette|number=125|date=9 November 1861|url=http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/hkgro/view/g1861/720939.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; another partner of the Dent &amp; Co.. He was reappointed to the Legislative Council in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Hongkong Government Gazette|number=147|date=10 August 1866|url=http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/hkgro/view/g1866/713861.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned in 1867 after his firm went bankrupt in 1867 and was replaced by [[Phineas Ryrie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Hongkong Government Gazette|number=109|date=15 July 1867|url=http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/hkgro/view/g1867/711749.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dent was also appointed consul for the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and later the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in Hong Kong from 1858 to 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Hongkong Government Gazette|number=180|volume=4|date=30 October 1858|url=http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/hkgro/view/g1858/723192.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Hongkong Government Gazette|number=70|volume=4|date=12 May 1866|url=http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/hkgro/view/g1866/713102.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Hongkong Government Gazette|number=49|date=28 April 1867|url=http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/hkgro/view/g1868/709313.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dent &amp; Co. went bankrupt in 1867 during the [[Long depression|worldwide financial crisis]] which originated in 1866 in London. They suffered a loss of no less than £200,000 by the malversations of a Portuguese clerk in their employment at Shanghai who was sentenced to seven years imprisonment.&lt;ref name="Argus"/&gt; The petition for adjudication of bankruptcy was filed in the [[Supreme Court of Hong Kong]] on 29 June 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Hongkong Government Gazette|page=434|date=21 December 1867|url=http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/hkgro/view/g1867/712466.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dent had to remove his headquarters in Shanghai and sold the Dent Building to the [[Hong Kong Hotel]] Co.

Dent was noted for his luxurious lifestyle which he was reported to have spent £10,000 on a racehorse to win the Hong Kong cup.&lt;ref name="familiy"/&gt; The clock-tower at the end of [[Pedder Street]] and the entrance to [[Queen's Road, Hong Kong|Queen's Road]] in [[Central, Hong Kong]], erected by public subscription in 1862, was at the suggestion of John Dent, whose original design had to be stripped of its original decorative features, owing to the waning enthusiasm of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=153|title=Twentieth Century Impressions of Hongkong, Shanghai, and other Treaty Ports of China|editor-first=Arnold|editor-last=Wright|year=1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Dent also donated a fountain at the entrance of the old [[City Hall, Hong Kong|City Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Wen Wei Po|title=香港大會堂50周年：從小見大 變化難料|date=22 June 2012|language=Chinese|url=http://paper.wenweipo.com/2012/06/22/OT1206220007.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870, Dent recommenced business as [[Dent &amp; Co]] in Shanghai in the premises previously occupied by his old firm.&lt;ref&gt;Notice in the North China Herald, 16 June 1870, p437&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1871 he became the Chairman of the [[Shanghai Municipal Council]] and served in that position until January 1873&lt;ref&gt;The Chronicle &amp; Directory for China and Japan 1872, entry for Dent; Municipal Council Report and Budget 1874, p4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joško Svaguša''' (born 11 January 1972 in [[Split, Croatia|Split]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]]) is a [[Croatia]]n entrepreneur, former politician and former president of the Croatian football club [[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]].

Svaguša graduated from the high school of tourism in Split. During the early 1990s, he went to [[Germany]] and worked in the [[Port of Hamburg]] for 3 years. He returned to Split in 1994 and opened a bakery with his father Mirko Svaguša. The bakery was called ''Svaguša'' and after some years it became a major bakery company with stores all around [[Dalmatia]].
In 2003, Joško Svaguša bought ''Bobis'', a major company that specialises in sweets.&lt;ref name="'nacional.hr"&gt;http://arhiva.nacional.hr/clanak/21402/splitski-kralj-kruha/&lt;/ref&gt;

Svaguša started attracting public fame in 2009 when he joined his friend [[Željko Kerum]] in an attempt to win the local elections in Split. Željko Kerum won the elections and became mayor of Split with Svaguša becoming an alderman in the Split city council.

Svaguša gained the public spotlight in August 2009 when he became the president of [[Hajduk Split]], the biggest sporting institution in Croatia. He was put there under the orders of Željko Kerum and in November 2009, Kerum created a supervisory board in Hajduk which was made up of only his closest friends. It sparked a revolt amongst Hajduk fans who demanded democracy and transparency in the club.

Svaguša made his first move by buying [[Anas Sharbini]] and [[Ahmad Sharbini]] for a fee of 2,3 million euros which was the highest fee that Hajduk ever paid on the market for a player. He managed to get [[Edoardo Reja]] as manager which was seen as an extraordinary accomplishment.

In February 2010, Reja left Hajduk and Svaguša got [[Stanko Poklepović]] as manager. Stanković won the [[2009–10 Croatian Football Cup]] which was Hajduks first trophy in 5 years. Svaguša gained controversy when it was reported that he gave himself almost 100,000 euros of the clubs money as a bonus for winning the cup.

In August 2010, Hajduk managed to qualify for the [[2010–11 UEFA Europa League]]. It was regarded as Hajduks greatest European achievement in the last 15 years. In October 2010, Poklepović was sacked for underperforming in the league and dropping out of the cup. Mayor Željko Kerum demanded that [[Goran Vučević]] be the new manager. Svaguša appointed Vučević but was not satisfied. Hajduk dropped out of the Europa league with 5 defeats and 1 win that season. In December 2010, Svaguša resigned as president.&lt;ref name="'novilist.hr"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.novilist.hr/Sport/Nogomet/HNL/Svagusa-pismeno-podnio-ostavku-Grbic-privremeni-predsjednik/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-03-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217144801/http://www.novilist.hr/Sport/Nogomet/HNL/Svagusa-pismeno-podnio-ostavku-Grbic-privremeni-predsjednik/# |archive-date=2017-02-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While president of Hajduk Split, Svaguša faced a revolt from the Hajduk fans. In October 2009, the fans boycotted the derby against [[Dinamo Zagreb]] which was the first ever event of that kind at Hajduk. Svaguša was perceived as a person who did not understand the job at Hajduk and at times faced criminal accusations. In 2015, he was under investigation for damaging the club with changing the players contracts during his presidency.&lt;ref name="'index.hr"&gt;http://www.index.hr/mobile/clanak.aspx?category=sport&amp;id=831418/{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Joško Svaguša closed the ''Svaguša'' company and transferred all assets to ''Bobis''. His company faced a major financial loss and in 2015, businessman Tomislav Mamić bought 50%  of ''Bobis'' shares for 3 million euros. Joško Svaguša still remains the company director.&lt;ref name="'slobodnadalmacija.hr"&gt;http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/novosti/biznis/clanak/id/264390/nema-vise-svaguse-tomislav-mamic-kupio-pola-bobisa-za-3-milijuna-eura/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Judge Building''', originally the '''Goelet Building-''', is a ten story edifice located at 110 [[Fifth Avenue]] and 16th Street. It is called the Judge building because it is where [[Judge (magazine)|Judge Magazine]] was printed.&lt;ref name=day/&gt; It covers a site measuring {{convert|92|by|158.4|ft}}.&lt;ref name=built&gt;{{cite news | title = The Auction Market | work = New York Times | date = 1922-05-11 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1922/05/11/archives/the-auction-market-absolute-sale-of-114-pelham-bay-lots-brings.html | page = 34 | accessdate = 2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Built in 1888, the structure was acquired by the [[New York Times Company]] in 1985. It was designed by [[McKim, Mead, and White]]. When purchased by the New York Times Company, the building became occupied mostly by the Times Company magazine, [[Family Circle]].&lt;ref name=day/&gt;

== History ==
The property was owned by the Goelet family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Legal Use of Streets | work = New York Times | date = 1896-11-11 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1896/11/11/archives/legal-use-of-streets-order-from-the-department-of-public-works.html | page = 1 | accessdate = 2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1922, Mary R. and Robert Goelet obtained a $250,000 loan on the establishment from the
[[Union Dime Savings Bank]].&lt;ref name=built/&gt;

In 1889 the Judge Building was expanded at the expense of a piano warehouse owned by [[William Knabe &amp; Company]] at 112 Fifth Avenue. After May 1, 1889 the warehouse was absorbed by the newer structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Found Dead in His Room | work = New York Times | date = 1889-02-18 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F03E4D81E38E533A2575BC1A9649C94689FD7CF | page = 1 | accessdate = 2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An exhibition of three thousand dolls was put on at the Judge Building beginning on the night of December 15, 1890. It was the first of its kind in the United States and featured a large Albani doll sent from [[London, England]] by Mademoiselle Albani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Many Dolls Will Receive | work = New York Times | date = 1890-12-14 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F05E3D91E3BE533A25757C1A9649D94619ED7CF | page = 10 | accessdate = 2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former business establishments located in the Judge Building include the firm of Sackett, Wilhelms &amp; Company (Sackett-Wilhelms Lithographing &amp; Publishing Company), which had a [[printing press]] there in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Killed in a Pressroom | work = New York Times | date = 1891-10-21 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1891/10/21/archives/atlantic-coast-defenses-gen-howard-tells-what-is-being-done-and.html | page = 2 | accessdate = 2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1980s the New York [[Historic Districts Council]] replaced a rotted out [[cornice]] made of light gauge metal sheets with one composed of molded fiberglass. The new cornice projected from the top of the building in a stepped design, with ornamental blocks (dentrils) arranged in a prominent row. The original third floor arches were also rebuilt.  The arches were lost in 1903, a year in which three floors were added to the structure.&lt;ref name=day&gt;{{cite news | last = Anderson | first = Susan Heller | last2 = Dunlap | first2 = David W. | title = Saving Ladies' Mile | work = New York Times | date = 1985-12-23 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/23/nyregion/new-york-day-by-day-saving-ladies-mile.html | page = B3 | accessdate = 2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Konstantin Grigoryevich Kagalovsky''' ({{lang-ru|Константин Григорьевич Кагаловский}}; born 13 October 1957) is a [[Russia|Russian]] businessman. He is the former vice-president of the oil company [[Yukos]] and a key Yukos shareholder, former deputy chairman of [[Bank Menatep]], and the former Russian representative to the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF).&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3919991.stm&lt;/ref&gt; Kagalovsky claims to be the owner of the Ukrainian TV channel [[TVi (channel)|TVi]].&lt;ref name=TViApr13A/&gt;

==Biography==
In 1980, he graduated from the [[Finance University under the Government of the Russian Federation|Moscow Finance Institute]] with a PhD in economics. In the late 1980s, he was a member of a group of young free-market economists, and was a close associate of [[Anatoly Chubais]], who has been both praised and criticised for his involvement in the mass privatization of state assets after the fall of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1999/sep/12/opinion/op-9170&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1992 and 1994, he was Russia's representative to the IMF. In November 1994, he became the deputy chairman of [[Bank Menatep]], and was a close associate of formerly jailed oligarch [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]] and his colleague, [[Platon Lebedev]]. In November 1995, Menatep took part in a mortgage auction, which resulted in its takeover of the oil company [[Yukos]]. From June 1998 to June 2002, he was a member of the Board of Directors of Yukos. In 1999 he became the vice-president of Yukos. In 1999, he, his wife Natasha Kagalovsky, an executive at the [[Bank of New York]], and [[Bruce Rappaport]], a major shareholder of [[Bank of New York]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.economist.com/node/234642&lt;/ref&gt; were accused of money laundering,&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/431663.stm&lt;/ref&gt; however they denied any wrongdoing, and charges were never filed. 

In September 2003, he unsuccessfully ran for a position in the [[Duma]] under the party [[Yabloko]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.russiansabroad.com/news/print.asp?articleId=37809&lt;/ref&gt; however Yabloko failed to overcome the five percent barrier which was required for parties to be considered. At the time, he was the second richest man to run for office in the Fourth Duma Session.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kommersant.com/p-124/r_459/Dollar_Millionaires_Who_Ran_for_Election_to_the_Fourth_Duma_Session_Top_27/&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2004, he headed a UK-based investor consortium that attempted to buy shares in [[Yukos]] from its former head [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]] in order to pay off its debts. The ruling [[Al Maktoum|Maktoum]] family of [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]] offered to pay US$10&amp;nbsp;billion to pay off Yukos' tax debts in exchange for controlling stock in the company. However, the [[Kremlin]] refused this proposal.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3919991.stm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kommersant.com/page.asp?id=496015&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, he lives in exile in London.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,UKR,4562d8b62,4f4b538a2,0.html&lt;/ref&gt; He and fellow Russian oligarch [[Vladimir Gusinsky]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b227a87a-6c20-11de-9320-00144feabdc0.html&lt;/ref&gt; launched a TV station [[TVi (channel)|TVi]] in Ukraine in 2008. They split due to a business dispute, and currently, Kagalovsky controls and continues to fund TVi on his own.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kyivpost.com/news/business/bus_general/detail/111124/print/&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 April 2013 [[Oleksandr Altman]] was officially registered as TVi's owner but according to Kagalovsky the documents showing that he sold the station were forged.&lt;ref name=TViApr13A&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/ukraine-tv-strike/24966998.html Ukrainian TV Station Staff Strike To Protest Takeover], [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] (24 April 2013)&lt;br&gt;[http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/130424/staff-strike-at-ukraines-opposition-tv-after-takeover Staff strike at Ukraine's opposition TV after takeover] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407071150/http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/130424/staff-strike-at-ukraines-opposition-tv-after-takeover |date=April  7, 2014 }}, [[GlobalPost]] (24 April 2013)&lt;br&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/25/ukraine-tv-idUSL6N0DA3FX20130425 Ukraine's only critical TV station silenced by ownership dispute], [[Reuters]] (25 April 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

He is known to be an associate of many [[Russian oligarch]]s, including [[Roman Abramovich]], [[Eugene Shvidler]], [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]], and the late [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iskran.ru/review/september/times.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/28/world/russians-see-politics-in-bank-scandal.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He lives in London and owns property in New York, Moscow, and on the [[French Riviera]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.architecturaldigest.com/decor/2008-03/nh_article&lt;/ref&gt; He is married to ex-[[Bank of New York]] executive Natasha Kagalovsky with whom he has a son.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7859">The [[chemical company|chemical companies]] of the '''large scale chemical synthesis in Poland''' ({{lang-pl|Wielka synteza chemiczna}}) at the beginning of the [[21st century]] underwent the a process of intensive reorganization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tygodnik7dni.pl/pierwsze-lata-xxi-wieku-czyli-przeksztalcenia-i-walka-z-kryzysem-2013,04,19.html | title = Pierwsze lata XXI wieku, czyli przekształcenia i walka z kryzysem | publisher = tygodnik7dni.pl | accessdate = 2016-08-01 | language = Polish }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
Since the majority of entities in the sector of great chemical synthesis was owned by State Treasury at that time, the reorganisation and privatisation strategy was developed for the sector of great chemical synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.msp.gov.pl/download/2/11629/StrategiarestrukturyzacjiiprywatyzacjisektoraWielkiejSyntezyChemicznej102003.pdf | title = Strategia restrukturyzacji i prywatyzacji Sektora Wielkiej Syntezy Chemicznej | publisher = msp.gov.pl | accessdate = 2016-08-01 | language = Polish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It identified, e.g. weak connections between the particular production plants and the necessity to reorganise them. The effect of this strategy was, e.g. the consolidation of the chemical and fertiliser industry, by establishing Grupa Azoty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/kraj/wielka-polska-synteza-chemiczna/e9xxp  | title = Wielka polska synteza chemiczna | publisher = onet.pl | accessdate = 2016-08-01 | language = Polish }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.msp.gov.pl/pl/media/aktualnosci/22655,Wielka-Synteza-Chemiczna-fuzja-dwoch-rownorzednych-podmiotow.html | title = Wielka Synteza Chemiczna fuzją dwóch równorzędnych podmiotów | publisher = msp.gov.pl | accessdate = 2016-08-01 | language = Polish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2286">A '''lecture consultant''' is an independent [[consultant]] who helps [[lecturers]] and [[institutions]] with the delivery of teaching, with particular focus on [[pedagogy]] and [[communication]].

==Role==
The role is analogous to that of an educational consultant, but rather than providing independent consulting advice to parents/students, they provide consulting advice to teachers. As with the accountability purpose of the educational consultant role, consultant lecturers keep lecturers accountable by ensuring lecturers have met the requisite standard for Shum's Three Forces, a framework for educational industry analysis:&lt;ref&gt;Shum, J.H., Learning in a kinesthetic environment, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Written syllabus to a requisite but encompassed standard
# Communication adopting kinesthetic, auditory and visual cues
# Arousing interest in students to continue furthered search

Consulting lecturers help with pre-class planning including [[syllabus]] writing to ensure state bylaw requirements relating to education are met. For example, in South Australia, this would include assisting teachers to follow the [[SSABSA]] guidelines relating to the [[South Australian Certificate of Education]].

In the classroom, consulting lecturers provide advice on improving [[communication]] effectiveness, including both verbal and nonverbal communication, including visual and kinesthetic techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Leite, Walter L.; Svinicki, Marilla; and Shi, Yuying: Attempted Validation of the Scores of the VARK: Learning Styles Inventory With Multitrait–Multimethod Confirmatory Factor Analysis Models, pg. 2. SAGE Publications, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some institutions, the role of the lecture consultant is governed by a Department of Learning and Teaching.

'''Percentage of completion''' ('''PoC''') is an [[accounting]] method of work-in-progress evaluation, for recording long-term [[contracts]]. [[Generally accepted accounting principles|GAAP]] allows another method of revenue recognition for long-term construction contracts, the [[completed-contract method]].

==When to use==
The accounting for long term contracts using the percentage of completion method is an exception to the basic realization principle. This method is used wherein the revenues are determined based on the costs incurred so far. The percentage of completion method is used when:
*Collections are assured 
*The accounting system can: 
#Estimate profitability 
#Measure progress toward completion. 
Losses are recognized in the year when they are discovered, the same way as for the completed contract method. The balance sheet presentation is the same as in the completed contract method.

==Formulas used==
Revenues and gross profit are recognized each period based on the construction progress, in other words, the percentage of completion. Construction costs plus gross profit earned to date are accumulated in an asset account (construction in process, also called construction in progress), and progress billings are accumulated in a liability account (billing on construction in process). Construction-in-progress are generally not classified as inventory as it would not be in-line with IAS2.9 (Inventories to be stated at lower of cost or NRV).

Although the formula for recognizing income in the current period can vary, a widely accepted one is as follows:

::&lt;math&gt;Inc_{k}=[\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m}Costs_{i}}{ \sum_{i=1}^{N}E(Costs_{i})} \cdot\sum_{i=1}^{N}Revenues_{i})]-\sum_{i=1}^{m-1}Inc_{i}.\, &lt;/math&gt;
where... &lt;math&gt;m= \, &lt;/math&gt; the number of periods lapsed since the inception of the contract.
::&lt;math&gt;N= \, &lt;/math&gt; the expected length of the contract
::&lt;math&gt;k= \, &lt;/math&gt; the current period
::&lt;math&gt;E= \, &lt;/math&gt; the total estimated cost of contract

==Examples==
For example, let's say our total estimated cost for the contract is $10,000 and our contract value is $12,000. We know that project will be completed in 2 years.
Now, after the first year we see that total cost incurred in this first year is $3,000. So according to the percentage-of-completion method: Cost percentage = 3000/10000 = 30%; so we will recognize 30% revenue in the income statement for the first year.

Income statement of AnantPurohit corporation Pvt. Ltd. for the year ended on xx/yy/zzzz:
{| class="wikitable"
 | Sales || 3,600 (30% of 12,000)
 |-
 | Cost of goods || 3,000
 |- style="border-top: 2px solid gray;"
 | Profit || 600
 |}
In the next year, some more complicated parts enter the game.
Let's say that after completion of the second year, our expected cost changes to 11,000. Assume our cost to date is 5,500 (3,000 in the first year, 2,500 in the second), the percentage completed is 5,500/11,000 = 50%.
Thus, the revenue to be recognized is (50% of 12,000) – 3,600 (previously recognized) = 2,400

Income statement of AnantPurohit corporation Pvt. Ltd. for the year ended on xx/yy/zzzz+1:
{| class="wikitable"
 | Sales || 2,400
 |-
 | Cost of goods || 2,500 (5,500 till date – 3,000 last year)
 |- style="border-top: 2px solid gray;"
 | Loss || 100
 |}

Now let's say that for the next year, our total cost estimation is increased to 15,000 due to increases in raw material and labor costs. We know that we are going to incur a loss of 3000 at the end of the contract period. For the third year, our cost to date reaches 10,500, so according to PoC:
Percentage completion = 10,500/15,000 = 70%
Revenue = 70% of 12,000 – previously recognized = 8,400 – 6,000 = 2,400.
However, because we are going to have a total loss of 3,000 on the contract..... we must recognize the total loss in the period it is estimated. As a result, our Cost of goods will be 5,900 (total loss recognized because of 500 profit recognized in previous periods [3,500] + Sales [2,400]); we reached this inductively by figuring the Sales and the Loss before the Cost of goods.

Income statement of AnantPurohit corporation Pvt. Ltd. for the year ended on xx/yy/zzzz+2:
{| class="wikitable"
 | Sales || 2,400
 |-
 | Cost of goods || 5,900
 |- style="border-top: 2px solid gray;"
 | Loss || 3,500
 |}

In final year, our cost is 4,500 and revenue is 3,600. But we record only 3,600 in Cost of goods because we already recognized the total loss in the last period.
{| class="wikitable"
 |-
 | Sales || 3,600
 |-
 | Cost of goods || 3,600
 |- style="border-top: 2px solid gray;"
 | Profit/loss || 0
 |}
Total Profit/Loss from the contract = 600-100-3,500= 3,000 Net Loss

==Disclosures==
As per IAS 11.42-43, an entity shall present:

(a) the gross amount due from customers for contract work as an asset; and

(b) the gross amount due to customers for contract work as a liability.

(These should be separate line-items on the face on the balance sheet.)

The gross amount due from/to customers for contract work is the net amount of:

(a) costs incurred plus recognized profits; less

(b) the sum of recognized losses and progress billings

for all contracts in progress.

'''Sandhurst Las Vegas''' is a cancelled high-rise [[condominium]] and [[Mixed-use development|mixed-use]] project that was planned for construction in [[downtown Las Vegas]]. The project was announced in October 2004, with the New Jersey-based Sandhurst Development as the developer. The project was designed by JMA Architecture and was to include a 35-story tower with 398 units. Two additional towers were also planned early in the project's history.

Construction, which was initially expected to cost $180 million, was delayed several times due to rising costs. The project was ultimately cancelled in 2007. A year later, it was announced that the '''Grand Central Hotel''' would be built on the property, although it remains un-built as of 2018.

==History==
Sandhurst Development, a company made up of former [[Citibank]] officials,&lt;ref name=LVS-Oct7-2004/&gt; had spent approximately three years researching the Las Vegas market before purchasing {{convert|3.2|acre|abbr=on}} from [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]] for $2.8 million in July 2004.&lt;ref name=LVS-Oct15-2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=LVRJ-Oct15-2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=LVRJ-May13-2006/&gt; In early October 2004, Sandhurst Development announced plans for a $180 million, 34-story tower with 409 condominium units that would be constructed on the property.&lt;ref name=LVS-Oct7-2004/&gt; The project was officially announced – as Sandhurst Las Vegas, Tower One – by Las Vegas Mayor [[Oscar Goodman]] during a weekly news conference on October 14, 2004.&lt;ref name=LVRJ-Oct15-2004&gt;{{cite news|last=Kalil|first=J.M.|title=40-story, 409-unit condo tower going up off Charleston|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Oct-15-Fri-2004/news/25002212.html|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=October 15, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041029234702/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Oct-15-Fri-2004/news/25002212.html|archivedate=October 29, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tower was to be located in downtown Las Vegas,&lt;ref name=LVS-Oct7-2004/&gt; at the northeast corner of [[Nevada State Route 159|Charleston Boulevard]] and Grand Central Parkway,&lt;ref name=LVRJ-Apr24-2008/&gt; east of [[Interstate 15 in Nevada|Interstate 15]].&lt;ref name=LVRJ-Dec16-2004/&gt; The tower would be located south of the [[Clark County Government Center]] parking lot,&lt;ref name=LVS-Oct15-2004&gt;{{cite news|last=Negron|first=Sito|title=Plans for new condo high rise are announced|url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2004/oct/15/plans-for-new-condo-high-rise-are-announced/|accessdate=February 26, 2017|work=Las Vegas Sun|date=October 15, 2004|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227150120/https://lasvegassun.com/news/2004/oct/15/plans-for-new-condo-high-rise-are-announced/|archivedate=February 27, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and near the under-construction [[World Market Center Las Vegas|World Market Center]] and the [[Las Vegas Premium Outlets North]] shopping mall. A presales launch was scheduled for December 2004. Sandhurst Development planned to begin groundbreaking on the project in March 2005,&lt;ref name=LVS-Oct7-2004&gt;{{cite news|last=Shubinski|first=Jennifer|title=Another high-rise tower planned for downtown|url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2004/oct/07/another-high-rise-tower-planned-for-downtown/|accessdate=February 26, 2017|work=[[Las Vegas Sun]]|date=October 7, 2004|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227150428/https://lasvegassun.com/news/2004/oct/07/another-high-rise-tower-planned-for-downtown/|archivedate=February 27, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with completion expected by September 2006.&lt;ref name=LVRJ-Oct15-2004/&gt; At the time of the announcement, Union Pacific was in negotiations to sell its remaining land to Sandhurst Development, which planned to ultimately construct two additional condominium towers and commercial space on the property.&lt;ref name=LVRJ-Oct15-2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=LVRJ-Dec16-2004/&gt;

In December 2004, the project was approved by the Las Vegas City Council for 35 stories with 413 units. Sandhurst Development relocated its headquarters from New Jersey to [[Henderson, Nevada]], to oversee the [[Mixed-use development|mixed-use]] project.&lt;ref name=LVRJ-Dec16-2004&gt;{{cite news|last=Kalil|first=J.M.|title=City Council approves 35-story condo tower|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Dec-16-Thu-2004/news/25487696.html|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=December 16, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041228175931/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Dec-16-Thu-2004/news/25487696.html|archivedate=December 28, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sandhurst tower would have been the company's first Las Vegas project.&lt;ref name=Rejection&gt;{{cite news|last=Kulin|first=Dan|title=LV City Council rejection stuns high-rise developer|url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2004/dec/16/lv-city-council-rejection-stuns-high-rise-develope/|accessdate=February 26, 2017|work=Las Vegas Sun|date=December 16, 2004|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227150406/https://lasvegassun.com/news/2004/dec/16/lv-city-council-rejection-stuns-high-rise-develope/|archivedate=February 27, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales began in January 2005, with prices starting at $250,000, based on construction prices at the time.&lt;ref name=LVRJ-May13-2006/&gt; In early 2005, negotiations with Union Pacific were underway to purchase 12 additional acres that were located southwest of the 3.2-acre property.&lt;ref name=LVS-Jan31-2005&gt;{{cite news|last=Shubinski|first=Jennifer|title=Developers eyeing other projects for downtown|url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2005/jan/31/developers-eyeing-other-projects-for-downtown/|accessdate=February 26, 2017|work=Las Vegas Sun|date=January 31, 2005|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227150146/https://lasvegassun.com/news/2005/jan/31/developers-eyeing-other-projects-for-downtown/|archivedate=February 27, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The land was to be used for a second tower that would be smaller than the 35-story tower.&lt;ref name=LVRJ-Apr6-2005&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Hubble|title=View from above: bricks|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Apr-06-Wed-2005/business/1060807.html|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=April 6, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050912101447/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Apr-06-Wed-2005/business/1060807.html|archivedate=September 12, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, construction was expected to begin in June 2005, with completion in fall 2006.&lt;ref name=LVS-Jan31-2005/&gt; Residential Constructors was to construct the project.&lt;ref name=LVRJ-May13-2006/&gt;

===Delays and cancellation===
Construction did not begin as scheduled.&lt;ref name=dec16&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Dec-16-Fri-2005/business/4821848.html|title=Development: Now you see them ...|last=Smith|first=Hubble|date=December 16, 2005|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230212036/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Dec-16-Fri-2005/business/4821848.html|archive-date=December 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Mirolla of Sandhurst Development said that in July 2005, he backed off from beginning work on the project after learning that construction costs would be either 30 percent&lt;ref name=LVRJ-May13-2006/&gt; or 50 percent higher than initially expected.&lt;ref name=LVS-May1-2006/&gt; As a result, the starting price for units in the project increased to $475,000 that year.&lt;ref name=Cancelled/&gt; By October 2005, the project was scheduled for occupancy at the end of 2007.&lt;ref name=NB/&gt; Preconstruction work on the site was underway in December 2005, as the tower was going through the final building approval process. Mirolla hoped to break ground in early January 2006, and said: "We made mistakes by projecting (construction) dates. Until you have a permit pulled, you can't tell. We're moving forward, but permits are taking a little longer than we thought. We had our full documents in with the city in May and here it is December. In September we were told to redesign the drainage. Now we go back to the engineers to redesign the drainage and that has to be approved. So we've learned a lot here."&lt;ref name=dec16/&gt;

In May 2006, Mirolla said construction costs had lowered from what they were in July 2005, and that he hoped to purchase building permits and begin construction within six weeks.&lt;ref name=LVS-May1-2006&gt;{{cite news|last=Kulin|first=Dan|title=Many stalled in race to the sky|url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2006/may/01/many-stalled-in-race-to-the-sky/|accessdate=February 26, 2017|work=Las Vegas Sun|date=May 1, 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227150418/https://lasvegassun.com/news/2006/may/01/many-stalled-in-race-to-the-sky/|archivedate=February 27, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mirolla declined to identify the general contractor until all documents were signed. At the time, Mirolla was in the final stages of the loan process. Mirolla was in negotiations with [[Corus Bankshares|Corus Bank]] as the primary lender, and had also met with JPS Capital. Later that month, Mirolla acknowledged rumors about the project's demise, confirming that the property had been privately listed for sale as a backup plan in the event of the project's cancellation. Although Mirolla had received offers for the property, he said the Sandhurst project was still being planned. At that time, construction costs were estimated at $200 million for the project, now with 398 condominium units; 45 percent of the units had been reserved up to that point, with starting prices now at $600,000 because of the rise in construction costs.&lt;ref name=LVRJ-May13-2006&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Hubble|title=Sandhurst high-rise still on|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/May-13-Sat-2006/business/7361397.html|work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]|date=May 13, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719183749/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/May-13-Sat-2006/business/7361397.html|archivedate=July 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was delayed that year because of the high construction costs, as investors in the project wanted to wait until the costs stabilized.&lt;ref name=Cancelled/&gt;

The project was cancelled in January 2007. Mirolla said he would return $7 million in deposits to 105 buyers, stating, "It doesn't mean this project won't come back. We just don't see the value of holding up our buyers. We're working with the group of investors who have title to the land, who still want to build Sandhurst, and if we can resurrect it, we'll reach out to the buyers." More than 60 percent of the project's condominiums were under contract, and the company had been negotiating with Corus Bank for approximately $250 million to finance construction, but Mirolla said that coming up with equity financing was difficult.&lt;ref name=Cancelled&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Hubble|title=Downtown condominium Sandhurst shutting down|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2007/Jan-13-Sat-2007/business/11956754.html|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=January 13, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704134940/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2007/Jan-13-Sat-2007/business/11956754.html|archivedate=July 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, Joseph Manzella of Sandhurst Development said, "We're talking with investors right now. We're working hard for the building." That month, Sandhurst Development was given two weeks to demonstrate to the Las Vegas City Council that progress had been made on the project. Otherwise, Goodman said the approval for the project would be revoked.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1642">'''Shrink-fitting''' is a technique in which an [[interference fit]] is achieved by a relative size change after assembly. This is usually achieved by heating or cooling one component before assembly and allowing it to return to the ambient temperature after assembly, employing the phenomenon of [[thermal expansion]] to make a joint. For example, the thermal expansion of a piece of a metallic drainpipe allows a builder to fit the cooler piece to it. As the adjoined pieces reach the same temperature, the joint becomes strained and stronger.

Other examples are the fitting of a [[wrought iron]] tyre around the rim of a wooden cart wheel by a [[wheelwright]], or of a steel tyre to the [[Railway wheel|wheel]] of a railway engine or rolling stock. In both cases the tyre will be heated and expands to slightly greater than the wheel's [[diameter]], and is fitted around it. After cooling, the tyre contracts, binding tightly in place. A common method used in industry is the use of [[induction shrink fitting]] which refers to the use of [[induction heating]] technology to pre-heat metal components between 150˚C and 300˚C thereby causing them to expand and allow for the insertion or removal of another component. Other methods of shrink-fitting include compression shrink fitting, which uses a cryogen such as liquid nitrogen to cool the insert, and [[shape memory coupling]], which is achieved by means of a phase transition.

== History ==
[[File:St. Patrick's Old Cathedral Mulberry Street entrance.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Mulberry Street entrance]]

The first Roman Catholic church in New York City was [[St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church, New York|St. Peter's]] on Barclay Street, the cornerstone of which was laid in 1785.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Mary Elizabeth and Osborne, Ernest L. "St. Peter's Church [Roman Catholic]" in {{cite enc-nyc2}}, p.1142&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 19th Century, the [[Jesuit]] [[rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of that church, [[Anthony Kohlmann]], realized that the city's growing Catholic population needed both a second sanctuary and a cathedral for the first bishop, since the city had been made a [[Episcopal see|see]] in 1808.&lt;ref name=g480&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, pp. 480-81&lt;/ref&gt; The site he selected for the new church was being used as a cemetery for St. Peter's,&lt;ref name=fromatoz /&gt; and was well outside the settled area of the city, surrounded by farmland and the country houses of the rich.&lt;ref name=g480 /&gt; The architect chosen was [[Joseph-Francois Mangin]], who had co-designed New York's [[New York City Hall|City Hall]] with [[John McComb, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;NYCLPC, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; construction on which was ongoing when the cornerstone of St. Patrick's was laid on June 8, 1809. Construction took just under five years, with the sanctuary being dedicated on May 14, 1815. In that same year, [[John Connolly (bishop)|John Connolly]], an Irish [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar, arrived to take office as the city's first resident [[bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]]. The church, which was the largest in the city at the time it was built, measures 120 by 80 feet and the inner vault is 85 feet high.

Until 1830 the cathedral was the ending place of the annual [[St. Patrick's Day]] parade. After that, it ended on Ann Street at the [[Church of the Transfiguration (New York City)|Church of the Transfiguration]], whose pastor, [[Felix Varela]], was a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] political refugee from Cuba, as he was a leader of the independence movement there, and who served as the chaplain of the Hibernian Universal Benevolent Society.&lt;ref name=fromatoz /&gt;&lt;ref name=g543&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, pp.543-46&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the parade moved uptown to pass in front of the new St. Patrick's Cathedral.

In 1836, the cathedral was the subject of an attempted [[looting|sack]] after tensions between Irish Catholics and anti-Catholic [[Know-Nothing]] nativists led to a number of riots and other physical confrontations. The situation worsened when a brain-injured young woman, [[Maria Monk]], wrote a book telling her "true" story &amp;ndash; a Protestant girl who converted to Catholicism, and was then allegedly forced by nuns to have sex with priests, with the resulting children being baptized then killed horribly. Despite the book being debunked by a mildly anti-Catholic magazine editor, nativist anger at the story resulted in a decision to attack the cathedral.&lt;ref name=g543 /&gt; [[Loophole]]s were cut in the church's outer walls, which had just recently been built, and the building was defended from the rioters with [[muskets]].&lt;ref name=fromatoz /&gt;&lt;ref name=g543 /&gt; Afterwards, the [[Ancient Order of Hibernians]] established its headquarters across the street from the church. Thirty years later, in 1866, the structure was gutted by fire, and even though the new St. Patrick's was already under construction, the old cathedral was restored under the direction of architect [[Henry Engelbert]] and reopened in 1868.

Since 1879, St. Patrick's Old Cathedral has been a parish church, the pastor residing in the old Bishop's House at 263 Mulberry Street. Today's multi-ethnic parish includes the territory of the former Most Holy Crucifix Parish, whose church now is the San [[Lorenzo Ruiz]] Chapel and houses the Filipino Catholic Apostolate for the [[Archdiocese of New York]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chapelofsanlorenzoruiz.org/Reflections.html Chapelofsanlorenzoruiz.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cathedral complex==
*[[St. Patrick's Old Cathedral School]] at 32 Prince Street between Mulberry and Mott Streets, across Prince Street from the Cathedral, predates the church itself. It was built in 1825-26 as the Roman Catholic Orphan Asylum, operated by the [[Sisters of Charity]]. In 1851, the asylum became for girls only, and in 1886 became a girls' school, St. Patrick's Convent and Girls School. The [[Federal architecture|Federal-style]] building is a [[List of New York City Landmarks|New York City landmark]], designated in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;NYCLPC, p.42&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:St. Michael's Russian Catholic Church.jpg|thumb|right|200px|St. Michael's Russian Catholic Church in the former Chancery Office building, designed by [[James Renwick, Jr.]] and [[William Rodrigue]]]]

*In 1859, a "Gingerbread Gothic"&lt;ref name=fromatoz /&gt; '''Chancery Office Building''' was built at 266 Mulberry Street, just north of the sanctuary, designed by [[James Renwick, Jr.]] and [[William Rodrigue]], who would go on to design the new cathedral.&lt;ref name=nycland&gt;NYCLPC, p.43&lt;/ref&gt;  The building would later become St. Michael's Chapel&lt;ref name=fromatoz /&gt; and, since 1936, '''St. Michael's Russian Catholic Church of the Byzantine Rite''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://stmichaelruscath.org/ Stmichaelruscath.org]&lt;/ref&gt; the liturgy is said and sung in [[Old Church Slavonic]], Russian, and English.  St. Michael's is the last [[Russian Greek Catholic Church|Russian Catholic]] church in New York City and one of only four remaining such sanctuaries in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stmichaelruscath.org/outbound/parishes/usa.php Stmichaelruscath.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Underneath the basilica are [[catacombs]] which currently consist of 35 family crypts and 5 clerical vaults.  The basilica has reopened the subterranean expanse to new interments, including a six-person family vault available for some seven million dollars.  The Old St. Patrick's Cathedral has also opened the catacombs to walking tours, which are executed by the New York City walking tour outfit "Tommy's New York".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2017/07/31/saint-patrick-s-old-cathedral-opens-its-centuries-old-catacombs-to-the-public.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the notable people who are laid to rest therein are the first resident Bishop of New York [[John Connolly (bishop)|John Connolly]],  [[Thomas Eckert|General Thomas Eckert]], several members of the [[Delmonico's|Delmonico]] restaurant family, [[Countess Annie Leary]] and [[John Kelly (New York politician)|Congressman John Kelly]].&lt;ref&gt;https://ny.curbed.com/2016/8/22/12583592/soho-st-patricks-old-cathedral-crypt-for-sale&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, two New Yorkers who are currently on the road to sainthood, [[Pierre Toussaint]] and Father Isaac Hecker, were originally interred there before being moved; Pierre Toussaint to the new St. Patrick's Cathedral and Father Hecker to St Paul The Apostle Church. 

== In popular culture ==
*The [[baptism]] scene in ''[[The Godfather]]'' was filmed in the old Cathedral, as was the scene in ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' in which [[Michael Corleone]] receives an honor from the church.
*A scene in the [[Martin Scorsese]] film ''[[Mean Streets]]'' was set in the cathedral's walled graveyard.
*The underground mortuary vaults of the old Cathedral were featured on the ''[[Secrets of New York]]'' episode "Deep NY - How Low Can You Go in the Big Apple", on ''[[NYC Media]]''.

'''The Duke Endowment''' is a private [[foundation (charity)|foundation]] established in 1924 by [[industrialist]] and [[philanthropist]] [[James B. Duke]].  The mission of the foundation is to serve the people of [[North Carolina]] and [[South Carolina]] by supporting selected programs of higher education, health care, children's welfare, and spiritual life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dukechronicle.com/articles/2012/10/09/minor-shaw-named-chair-duke-endowment|title=Minor Shaw named chair of Duke Endowment|publisher=Duke Chronicle|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
James B. Duke endowed the foundation on December 11, 1924 with $40 million.  In the Indenture of Trust, Duke specified that he wanted the Endowment to support [[Duke University]], [[Davidson College]], [[Furman University]], [[Johnson C. Smith University]]; not-for-profit hospitals and children's homes in the two Carolinas; and rural [[United Methodist]] churches in North Carolina, retired pastors, and their surviving families.  When Mr. Duke died in 1925, he left the Endowment an additional $67 million. Adjusted for present value, Mr. Duke's total gifts would amount to more than $1.3 billion today.   

The market value of the Endowment's assets have grown to approximately $3.4 billion.  From 1924-2013, the Endowment has awarded over $3.2 billion in grants.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

The Duke Endowment is a co-publisher, along with the [[North Carolina Institute of Medicine]], of the North Carolina Medical Journal, a journal of health policy analysis and debate.[http://www.ncmedicaljournal.org]

The Endowment was established by a [http://www.dukeendowment.org/sites/default/files/media/images/stories/downloads/tde/Duke-Indenture-MAR-16-2011.pdf trust indenture] that [[Donor intent|specifies]] how the funds were to be used.  First, $6 million was to be used to either found a [[Duke University]] or to enhance Trinity College, located at Durham, North Carolina, if that school changed its name to Duke University within 3 months.  The remaining funds were to be invested (primarily in [[Duke Power Company]]) stock. Of the income generated annually by these funds, 20% were to be reinvested, each trustee was to receive 0.2%, and the rest was to be paid out in the following allocation:

'''Victor Leydet''' (1845-1908) was a French businessman, politician and novelist. He served as a member of the [[Senate of France]] from 1897 to 1908.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Victor Leydet was born on July 3, 1845 in [[Aix-en-Provence]].&lt;ref name="senat"&gt;[http://www.senat.fr/senateur-3eme-republique/leydet_victor0316r3.html Senate]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lesrues"&gt;[http://ruesdaix.ag13.pagesperso-orange.fr/html/LEYDET.html Les Rues d'Aix]&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Joseph Vincent Leydet, was a factory worker.&lt;ref name="senat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt; His mother was Marie Françoise Laurin.&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt; He was educated at the Collège Mignet (then known as the Collège Bourbon) in Aix.&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt;

===Business career===
He started his career as a shop assistant in shops in Aix.&lt;ref name="senat"/&gt; Later, he became Director of one of the biggest [[olive oil]] factories in [[Provence]].&lt;ref name="senat"/&gt;

===Political career===
A staunch supporter of the Republic, he joined the [[Radical Left (France)|Radical Left]], a left-wing political party.&lt;ref name="senat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leo A. Loubere, ''Radicalism in Mediterranean France'', Albany, New York: State University of New York Press, 1974, p. 165 [https://books.google.com/books?id=-TFwRZ1BRnUC&amp;pg=PA165]&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected to the town council of Aix in 1870.&lt;ref name="senat"/&gt; He also served as Deputy-Mayor of Aix from 1876 to 1882, when [[Salomon Bédarrides]] (1809-1886)  was the Mayor.&lt;ref name="senat"/&gt; He also joined the General Council of the [[Bouches-du-Rhône]] (representing [[Peyrolles-en-Provence|Peyrolles]]), when he campaigned for match-making factories to be returned to the French homeland rather than in her colonies; they were returned to France in 1872, and a new match-making factory was built in Aix from 1892 to 1895 (now reconverted as the [[Bibliothèque Méjanes]], a public library, since 1989).&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt; He also worked as a judge in the Chamber of Commerce.&lt;ref name="senat"/&gt;

He served as a French Senator from 1897 to his death in 1908.&lt;ref name="senat"/&gt; He was opposed to the policies of [[Léon Gambetta]] (1838-1882) and [[Jules Ferry]] (1832-1892), and he voted against extending the [[Tonkin Campaign]] in [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="senat"/&gt; Additionally, he voted in favour of the separation of church and state.&lt;ref name="senat"/&gt; He proposed a law to establish an income tax which would be progressive and proportional.&lt;ref name="senat"/&gt; He supported a break-up of the match-making industry in France, a French state monopoly which lasted from 1872 to 1992 (initially established to finance the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870-1871).&lt;ref name="senat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt; In his second tenure, which started in 1903, he opposed the policies of [[Maurice Rouvier]] (1842–1911) [[Pierre Tirard]] (1827-1893) &lt;ref name="senat"/&gt; He was also in favour of going after General [[Georges Ernest Boulanger]] (1837–1891), who attempted a coup d'état in 1889.&lt;ref name="senat"/&gt; He took a look at regulating the use of the [[Durance]], protecting wild birds, increasing the number of fields of olive trees and tobacco in Provence, and promoting the [[Étang de Berre]].&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt; Moreover, he was in favour of encouraging army recruitment, increasing railway tracks in France, and maintaining the [[Aix-Marseille University|University of Aix]] in Aix.&lt;ref name="senat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt;

===Novelist===
He wrote three novels set in Aix, published weekly in the newspaper ''Le National''.&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt;

===Personal life===
He married Louise Ely.&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt; They had five sons and two daughters:
*[[Edmond Leydet]] (1869-unknown).&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt; He was a Prefect of [[Eure-et-Loir]].&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt;
*Fernand Leydet (1871-unknown).&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt;
*[[Louis Leydet]] (1873-unknown).&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt; He was a painter.&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt;
*Lucien Marc Leydet (1874-unknown).&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt;
*Paul Gabriel Leydet (1876-unknown).&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt;
*Francia Leydet (1877-unknown).&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt;
*Sextia Leydet (1883-unknown).&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt;

His son Louis was friends with painter [[Paul Cézanne]] (1839-1906).&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt; As a result, Victor Leydet attended Cézanne's funeral and said a few words about him.&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt;

He died on October 22, 1908 in Paris.&lt;ref name="senat"/&gt; His corpse was returned to Aix, and he was buried in the [[Saint-Pierre Cemetery (Aix-en-Provence)|Saint-Pierre Cemetery]] in Aix.&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt;

===Legacy===
*The ''Rue Victor Leydet'' in Aix-en-Provence is named in his honour.&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=np&amp;q=rue+victor+leydet+aix&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x12c98d980aca038f:0xec774dd312733788,Rue+Victor+Leydet,+13100+Aix-en-Provence,+France&amp;gl=uk&amp;ei=Q-69Ut-vAsOBhAeW9IDYCQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ8gEwAA Google Maps]&lt;/ref&gt; He resided at number 40 on this street, formerly known as the ''Rue Villeverte''.&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt; On February 23, 1911, the town council decided to rename the street after him.&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt;
*On December 18, 1910, a [[bronze]] bust designed by sculptor [[Auguste Carli]] (1868-1930) was dedicated on the ''Place Jeanne d'Arc'' in Aix.&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt; Several ministers were present alongside a crowd of about 700.&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt; However, the bust was stolen by the Germans in 1943, during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt; A new bust, made of [[plaster]] and initially on his cemetery tomb, is now in its place, behind a newsagent.&lt;ref name="lesrues"/&gt;
