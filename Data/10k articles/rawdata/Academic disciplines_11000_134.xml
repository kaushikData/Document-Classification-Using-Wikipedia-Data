'''Actor–network theory''' ('''ANT''') is a theoretical and methodological approach to [[social theory]] where everything in the social and natural worlds exists in constantly shifting networks of relationship.&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;Simandan, D., 2017. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, pp.1-12. https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307&lt;/ref&gt; It posits that nothing exists outside those relationships. All the factors involved in a social situation are on the same level, and thus there are no external social forces beyond what and how the network participants interact at present. Thus, objects, ideas, processes, and any other relevant factors are seen as just as important in creating social situations as humans. ANT holds that social forces do not exist in themselves, and therefore cannot be used to explain social phenomena.  Instead, strictly empirical analysis should be undertaken to "describe" rather than "explain" social activity.  Only after this can one introduce the concept of social forces, and only as an abstract theoretical concept, not something which genuinely exists in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Latour, Bruno. Reassembling the social: An introduction to actor-network-theory. Oxford university press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental aim of ANT is to explore how networks are built or assembled and maintained to achieve a specific objective.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ulir.ul.ie/handle/10344/2579 Carroll, N., Richardson, I., and Whelan, E. (2012). Service science: an actor-network theory approach. International Journal of Actor-Network Theory and Technological Innovation (IJANTTI);4(3), pp. 51-69]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rpx_BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=carroll+A+Bureaucratic+View+of+Public+Service+Innovation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OrMOvhK-8k&amp;sig=YljSfKMKSn1HchgCBBiJYmRnMMc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwit-ITauIrQAhXDA8AKHbdPBS0Q6AEIKjAD#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Carroll, N.

Actor-Network Theory: A Bureaucratic View of Public Service Innovation, Chapter 7, Technological Advancements and the Impact of Actor-Network Theory, pp. 115-144, Publisher IGI Global, Hershey, PA]&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is best known for its controversial insistence on the capacity of [[non human|nonhumans]] to act or participate in systems or [[Social network|networks]] or both, ANT is also associated with forceful critiques of conventional and critical sociology. Developed by [[science and technology studies]] (STS) scholars [[Michel Callon]] and [[Bruno Latour]], the sociologist [[John Law (sociologist)|John Law]], and others, it can more technically be described as a "material-semiotic" method. This means that it maps relations that are simultaneously material (between things) and [[semiotic]] (between concepts). It assumes that many relations are both material and semiotic.

Broadly speaking, ANT is a [[social constructivism|constructivist]] approach in that it avoids [[essentialist]] explanations of events or innovations (i.e. ANT explains a successful theory by understanding the combinations and interactions of elements that make it successful, rather than saying it is true and the others are false). Likewise, it is not a cohesive theory in itself.&lt;ref name="doi.org"/&gt; Rather, ANT functions as a strategy that assists people in being sensitive to terms and the often unexplored assumptions underlying them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mol|first=A.|date=2010|title=Actor-Network Theory: sensitive terms and enduring tensions|url=http://dare.uva.nl/search?identifier=75bbc661-0a89-475a-9eef-8c8c5a2e9904|journal=Kölner Zeitschrift für Soziologie und Sozialpsychologie. Sonderheft|volume=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinguished from many other [[science and technology studies|STS]] and sociological [[Social network|network theories]] for its distinct material-semiotic approach.

==Background and context==
ANT was first developed at the [[Centre de Sociologie de l'Innovation]] (CSI) of the [[École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris]] in the early 1980s by staff ([[Michel Callon]] and [[Bruno Latour]]) and visitors (including [[John Law (sociologist)|John Law]]). The 1984 book co-authored by John Law and fellow-sociologist Peter Lodge (''Science for Social Scientists''; London: Macmillan Press Ltd.) is a good example of early explorations of how the growth and structure of knowledge could be analyzed and interpreted through the interactions of actors and networks.  Initially created in an attempt to understand processes of innovation and knowledge-creation in science and technology, the approach drew on existing work in [[Science and technology studies|STS]], on studies of [[large technical system|large technological systems]], and on a range of French intellectual resources including the semiotics of [[Algirdas Julien Greimas]], the writing of philosopher [[Michel Serres]], and the [[Annales School]] of history.

ANT appears to reflect many of the preoccupations of French [[post-structuralism]], and in particular a concern with non-foundational and multiple material-semiotic relations. At the same time, it was much more firmly embedded in English-language academic traditions than most post-structuralist-influenced approaches. Its grounding in (predominantly English) [[science and technology studies]] was reflected in an intense commitment to the development of theory through qualitative empirical case-studies. Its links with largely US-originated work on large technical systems were reflected in its willingness to analyse large scale technological developments in an even-handed manner to include political, organizational, legal, technical and scientific factors.

Many of the characteristic ANT tools (including the notions of translation, generalized symmetry and the “heterogeneous network”), together with a [[scientometric]] tool for mapping innovations in science and technology (“co-word analysis”) were initially developed during the 1980s, predominantly in and around the CSI. The “state of the art” of ANT in the late 1980s is well-described in Latour’s 1987 text, ''Science in Action''.&lt;ref name=science&gt;Latour, B. (1987). ''[[Science in Action: How to Follow Scientists and Engineers Through Society]].'' Milton Keynes: Open University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

From about 1990 onwards, ANT started to become popular as a tool for analysis in a range of fields beyond STS. It was picked up and developed by authors in parts of organizational analysis, informatics, health studies, geography, sociology, anthropology, feminist studies, technical communication&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Network: Theorizing Knowledge Work in Telecommunications|last=Spinuzzi|first=Clay|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780521895040|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Read|first=Sarah|last2=Swarts|first2=Jason|date=2015|title=Visualizing and Tracing: Research Methodologies for the Study of Networked, Sociotechnical Activity, Otherwise Known as Knowledge Work|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/10572252.2015.975961|journal=Technical Communication Quarterly|volume=24|issue=1|pages=14-44|doi=10.1080/10572252.2015.975961|via=Taylor &amp; Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; and economics.&lt;ref name="Müller, M 2016. pp.217-229"&gt;Müller, M. and Schurr, C., 2016. Assemblage thinking and actor‐network theory: conjunctions, disjunctions, cross‐fertilisations. Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers, 41(3), pp.217-229.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2008}}, ANT is a widespread, if controversial, range of material-semiotic approaches for the analysis of heterogeneous relations. In part because of its popularity, it is interpreted and used in a wide range of alternative and sometimes incompatible ways. There is no orthodoxy in current ANT, and different authors use the approach in substantially different ways. Some authors talk of “after-ANT” to refer to “successor projects” blending together different problem-focuses with those of ANT.&lt;ref&gt;John Law and John Hassard (eds) (1999). ''Actor Network Theory and After'' (Oxford and Keele: Blackwell and the Sociological Review).&lt;/ref&gt;

==A material-semiotic method==
Although it is called a “[[Philosophical theory|theory]]”, ANT does not usually explain “why” or "how" a network takes the form that it does.&lt;ref name=RtS /&gt; Rather, ANT is a way of thoroughly exploring the relational ties within a network (which can be a multitude of different things). As Latour notes,&lt;ref name=technology&gt;Latour, B. (1999). [http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/46-TECHNOLOGY-DURABLE-GBpdf.pdf "Technology Is Society Made Durable"]. In Law, J., ed., ''Sociology of Monsters''.&lt;/ref&gt; "explanation does not follow from description; it is description taken that much further." It is not, in other words, a theory "of" anything, but rather a method, or a "how-to book" as Latour &lt;ref name=RtS /&gt; puts it.

The approach is related to other versions of material-semiotics (notably the work of philosophers [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Michel Foucault]], and feminist scholar [[Donna Haraway]]). It can also be seen as a way of being faithful to the insights of [[ethnomethodology]] and its detailed descriptions of how common activities, habits and procedures sustain themselves.  Similarities between ANT and [[symbolic interactionist]] approaches such as the newer forms of [[grounded theory]] like [[situational analysis]], exist,&lt;ref&gt;Fernback, J., 2007. “Beyond the Diluted Community Concept: A Symbolic Interactionist Perspective on Online Social Relations.” ''New Media &amp; Society'', 9(1), pp.49-69. [[doi:10.1177/1461444807072417]]&lt;/ref&gt; although Latour&lt;ref&gt;Blok, A, &amp; Elgaard Jensen, T. (2011). ''[http://www.excursions-journal.org.uk/index.php/excursions/article/download/100/134 Bruno Latour: Hybrid thoughts in a hybrid world] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524023006/http://www.excursions-journal.org.uk/index.php/excursions/article/download/100/134 |date=May 24, 2015 }}''. Suffolk: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; objects to such a comparison.

Although ANT is mostly associated with studies of science and technology and with the sociology of science, it has been making steady progress in other fields of sociology as well.  ANT is adamantly empirical, and as such yields useful insights and tools for sociological inquiry in general. ANT has been deployed in studies of identity and subjectivity, urban transportation systems, and passion and addiction.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Gomart, Emilie, and Hennion, Antoin (1999) “[https://www.academia.edu/866668/A_Sociology_of_Attachment_Music_Amateurs_Drug_Addicts A Sociology of Attachment: Music Amateurs, Drug Users]”.

==The actor-network==
As the term implies, the actor-network is the central concept in ANT. The term "network" is somewhat problematic in that as Latour &lt;ref name=RtS /&gt;&lt;ref name=technology /&gt;&lt;ref name=on&gt;Latour, B. "[http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/P-67%20ACTOR-NETWORK.pdf On Actor Network Theory: A Few Clarifications]"&lt;/ref&gt; notes, it has a number of unwanted connotations. Firstly, it implies that what is described takes the shape of a network, which is not necessarily the case. Secondly, it implies "transportation without deformation," which, in ANT, is not possible since any actor-network involves a vast number of [[#Translation|translations]]. Latour,&lt;ref name=on /&gt; however, still contends that network is a fitting term to use, because "it has no a priori order relation; it is not tied to the axiological myth of a top and of a bottom of society; it makes absolutely no assumption whether a specific locus is macro- or micro- and does not modify the tools to study the element 'a' or the element 'b'." This use of the term "network" is very similar to Deleuze and Guattari's [[Rhizome (philosophy)|rhizomes]]; Latour &lt;ref name=technology /&gt; even remarks tongue in cheek that he would have no objection to renaming ANT "actant-rhizome ontology" if it only had sounded better, which hints at Latour's uneasiness with the word "theory".

Actor–network theory tries to explain how material–semiotic networks come together to act as a whole; the clusters of actors involved in creating meaning are both material and semiotic. As a part of this it may look at explicit strategies for relating different elements together into a network so that they form an apparently coherent whole. These networks are potentially transient, existing in a constant making and re-making.&lt;ref name=RtS&gt;Latour, B., 2005. ''[[Bruno Latour#Reassembling the Social|Reassembling the Social: An Introduction to Actor-Network-Theory]]''. Oxford: Oxford UP.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that relations need to be repeatedly “performed” or the network will dissolve. They also assume that networks of relations are not intrinsically coherent, and may indeed contain conflicts. Social relations, in other words, are only ever in process, and must be [[Performativity|performed]] continuously.

Actants denote human and non-human actors, and in a network take the shape that they do by virtue of their relations with one another. It assumes that nothing lies outside the network of relations, and as noted above, suggests that there is no difference in the ability of technology, humans, animals, or other non-humans to act (and that there are only enacted alliances). As soon as an actor engages with an actor-network it too is caught up in the web of relations, and becomes part of the [[entelechy]].

If taken to its logical conclusion, then, nearly any actor can be considered merely a sum of other, smaller actors. A car is an example of a complex system. It contains many electronic and [[machine|mechanical]] components, all of which are essentially hidden from view to the driver, who simply deals with the car as a single object. This effect is known as ''punctualisation'', and is similar to the idea of [[Encapsulation (object-oriented programming)|encapsulation]] in [[object-oriented programming]].

When an actor network breaks down, the punctualisation effect tends to cease as well. In the automobile example above, a non-working engine would cause the driver to become aware of the car as a collection of parts rather than just a vehicle capable of transporting them from place to place. This can also occur when elements of a network act contrarily to the network as a whole. In his book ''Pandora’s Hope'', Latour likens depunctualization to the opening of a black box. When closed, the box is perceived simply as a box, although when it is opened all elements inside it becomes visible.

==Human and non-human actors==
ANT is often associated with the equal treatment of human and non-human actors. ANT assumes that all entities in a network can and should be described in the same terms. This is called the principle of ''[[generalized symmetry]]''. The rationale for this is that differences between them are generated in the network of relations, and should not be presupposed.&lt;ref name="Müller, M 2016. pp.217-229"/&gt;

===Intermediaries and mediators===
The distinction between intermediaries and mediators is key to ANT sociology. Intermediaries are entities which make no difference (to some interesting state of affairs which we are studying) and so can be ignored. They transport the force of some other entity more or less without transformation and so are fairly uninteresting. Mediators, on the other hand, are entities which multiply difference and so should be the object of study. Their outputs cannot be predicted by their inputs. From an ANT point of view, sociology has tended to treat too much of the world as intermediaries.

For instance, a sociologist might take silk and nylon as intermediaries, holding that the former “means”, “reflects”, or “symbolises” the upper classes and the latter the lower classes. In such a view, the real-world silk–nylon difference is irrelevant — presumably, many other material differences could also, and do also, transport this class distinction. But taken as mediators, these fabrics would have to be engaged with by the analyst in their specificity: the internal real-world complexities of silk and nylon suddenly appear relevant, and are seen as actively constructing the ideological class distinction which they once merely reflected.

For the committed ANT analyst, social things like class distinctions in taste, as in the silk and nylon example, are examples of social construction, but also groups and power must constantly be constructed or performed anew through complex engagements with complex mediators. There is no stand-alone social repertoire lying in the background to be reflected off, expressed through, or substantiated in, interactions (as in an intermediary conception). That being said, it doesn't make sense to say there are social aspects of things. Things themselves are a constitutive part of the social reality they are able to enact.&lt;ref name=RtS /&gt;

==Other central concepts==

===Translation===
{{main|Translation (sociology)}}
Central to ANT is the concept of translation which is sometimes referred to as '''sociology of translation''', in which innovators attempt to create a ''forum,'' a central network in which all the actors agree that the network is worth building and defending. In his widely debated 1986 study of how marine biologists try to restock the St Brieuc Bay in order to produce more scallops,&lt;ref&gt;Michel Callon (1986). “[http://www.vub.ac.be/SOCO/tesa/RENCOM/Callon%20%281986%29%20Some%20elements%20of%20a%20sociology%20of%20translation.pdf Some Elements of a Sociology of Translation: Domestication of the Scallops and the Fishermen of St Brieuc Bay]”. In John Law (ed.), ''Power, Action and Belief: A New Sociology of Knowledge'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Callon]] has defined 4 moments of translation: [[problematization]], [[interessement]], enrollment and mobilisation of allies.  Also important to the notion is the role of network objects in helping to smooth out the translation process by creating equivalencies between what would otherwise be very challenging people, organizations or conditions to mesh together.  Bruno Latour spoke about this particular task of objects in his work ''Reassembling the Social'' (2005).

=== Tokens, or quasi-objects ===
In the above examples, “social order” and “functioning car” come into being through the successful interactions of their respective actor-networks, and actor-network theory refers to these creations as ''tokens'' or ''quasi-objects'' which are passed between actors within the network.

As the token is increasingly transmitted or passed through the network, it becomes increasingly punctualized and also increasingly [[Reification (Marxism)|reified]]. When the token is decreasingly transmitted, or when an actor fails to transmit the token (e.g., the oil pump breaks), punctualization and reification are decreased as well.

== Actor network theory and specific disciplines ==
Recently, there has been a movement to introduce Actor Network Theory as an analytical tool to a range of applied disciplines outside of sociology, including nursing, public health, business (Klein and Czarniawska, 2005), library and information science (Beagle, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite journal|url = |title = The Sociotechnical Networks of Scholarly Communication.|last = Beagle|first = Donald|date = 2001|journal = Portal: Libraries and the Academy |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=421–443|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;); urban studies (Farias and Bender, 2010), and community, urban, and regional planning (Beauregard, 2012;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Planning with Things|last = Beauregard|first = Robert|date = 2012|journal = Journal of Planning Education and Research |volume=32 |pages=182–190|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beauregard and Lieto, 2015; Rydin, 2012;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Using Actor-Network Theory to understand planning practice: Exploring relationships between actants in regulating low-carbon commercial development|last = Rydin|first = Yvonne|date = 2012|journal = Planning Theory |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=23–45|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rydin and Tate, 2016, Tate, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Growth management implementation in Metro Vancouver: Lessons  from actor network theory.|last = Tate|first = Laura|date = 2013|journal = Environment and Planning B |volume=40 |issue= |pages=783–800|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== ANT and international relations ===
Actor-Network Theory has become increasingly prominent within the discipline of [[International Relations]] and [[Political Science]].

Theoretically, scholars within IR have employed ANT in order to disrupt traditional world political binaries (civilised/barbarian, democratic/autocratic, etc.),&lt;ref name="ejt.sagepub.com"&gt;Austin, Jonathan Luke., 2015. [http://ejt.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/11/26/1354066115616466.abstract "We have never been civilized: Torture and the Materiality of World Political Binaries."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151204051611/http://ejt.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/11/26/1354066115616466.abstract |date=2015-12-04 }} ''European Journal of International Relations'', [[doi:10.1177/1354066115616466]]&lt;/ref&gt; consider the implications of a posthuman understanding of IR,&lt;ref&gt;Cudworth, E. and Hobden, S, 2013. “Of parts and wholes: International Relations beyond the human.” ''Millennium: Journal of International Studies', 41(3), pp.430-450.&lt;/ref&gt; explore the infrastructures of world politics,&lt;ref&gt;Barry, A., 2013. “Material Politics.”&lt;/ref&gt; and consider the effects of technological agency.&lt;ref&gt;Leander, A., 2013. “Technological agency in the co-constitution of legal expertise and the US drone program.” ''Leiden Journal of International Law', 26(4), pp.811-831.&lt;/ref&gt;

Empirically, IR scholars have drawn on insights from ANT in order to study phenomena including political violences like the use of torture and drones,&lt;ref name="ejt.sagepub.com"/&gt; piracy and maritime governance,&lt;ref&gt;Bueger C., 2013. “Practice, pirates, and coast guards.” ''Third World Quarterly', 34(10), pp.1811-1827.&lt;/ref&gt; and garbage.&lt;ref&gt;Acuto, M., 2014. “Everyday International Relations.” ''International Political Sociology', 8(4).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ANT and design ===
The Actor-Network Theory can also be applied to design, using a perspective that is not simply limited to an analysis of an object's structure. From the ANT viewpoint, design is seen as a series of features that account for a social, psychological, and economical world. ANT argues that objects are designed to shape human action and mold or influence decisions. In this way, the objects' design serves to mediate human relationships and can even impact our morality, ethics, and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yaneva|first=Albena|title=Making the Social Hold: Towards an Actor-Network Theory of Design|journal=Design and Culture|publication-date=2009|volume=1|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Actor–network theory insists on the capacity of [[non human|nonhumans]] to be actors or participants in networks and systems. Critics including figures such as [[Langdon Winner]] maintain that such properties as ''[[intentionality]]'' fundamentally distinguish humans from animals or from “things” (see [[Activity Theory]]).&lt;ref&gt;Winner, L. (1993). [http://www.nyu.edu/projects/nissenbaum/papers/openingblackbox.pdf "Upon Opening the Black Box and Finding It Empty : Social Constructivism and the Philosophy of Technology Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values"] (Vol. 18, pp. 362-378).&lt;/ref&gt; ANT scholars {{Who|date=December 2012}} respond with the following arguments:
* They do not attribute intentionality and similar properties to [[non human|nonhumans]].
* Their conception of [[human agency|agency]] does not presuppose intentionality.
* They locate agency neither in human “subjects” nor in non-human “objects”, but in heterogeneous associations of humans and nonhumans.

ANT has been criticized as amoral. [[Wiebe Bijker]] has responded to this criticism by stating that the amorality of ANT is not a necessity. Moral and political positions are possible, but one must first describe the network before taking up such positions. This position has been further explored by Stuart Shapiro who contrasts ANT with the history of ecology, and argues that research decisions are moral rather than methodological, but this moral dimension has been sidelined.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, S. (1997). Caught in a web: The implications of ecology for radical symmetry in STS. Social Epistemology, 11(1), 97-110. [[doi:10.1080/02691729708578832]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whittle and Spicer note that "ANT has also sought to move beyond deterministic models that trace organizational phenomena back to powerful individuals, social structures, hegemonic discourses or technological effects. Rather, ANT prefers to seek out complex patterns of causality rooted in connections between actors." They argue that ANT's ontological realism makes it "less well equipped for pursuing a critical account of organizations—that is, one which recognises the unfolding nature of reality, considers the limits of knowledge and seeks to challenge structures of domination." &lt;ref&gt;Andrea Whittle and [[André Spicer]], 2008. Is actor network theory critique? ''Organization Studies'' 2008 29: 611&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that ANT does not account for pre-existing structures, such as power, but rather sees these structures as emerging from the actions of actors within the network and their ability to align in pursuit of their interests. Accordingly, ANT can be seen as an attempt to re-introduce [[Whig history]] into [[science and technology studies]]; like the myth of the [[Heroic theory of invention and scientific development|heroic inventor]], ANT can be seen as an attempt to explain successful innovators by saying only that they were successful. Likewise, for organization studies, Whittle and Spicer assert that ANT is, "ill suited to the task of developing political alternatives to the imaginaries of market managerialism."

Key early criticism came from other members of the STS community, in particular the "Epistemological Chicken" debate between Collins and Yearley with responses from Latour and Callon as well as Woolgar.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} Collins and Yearley accused ANTs approach of collapsing into an endless relativist regress.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, H. M., &amp; Yearley, S. (1992). Epistemological Chicken. In A. Pickering (Ed.), Science as Practice and Culture (pp. 301-326). Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;   Some critics&lt;ref&gt;Amsterdamska, O. (1990). 'Surely You're Joking, Mr Latour!'. Science, Technology, Human Values. Vol.15(4) pp.495-504.&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that research based on ANT perspectives remains entirely descriptive and fails to provide explanations for social processes. ANT—like comparable social scientific methods—requires judgement calls from the researcher as to which actors are important within a network and which are not. Critics{{Who|date=July 2013}} argue that the importance of particular actors cannot be determined in the absence of “out-of-network” criteria. Similarly, others{{Who|date=October 2014}} argue that actor-networks risk degenerating into endless chains of association ([[six degrees of separation]]—we are all networked to one another). Other research perspectives such as [[social constructionism]], [[social shaping of technology]], [[social network theory]], [[normalization process theory]], [[Diffusion of Innovations]] theory are held to be important alternatives to ANT approaches.

In a workshop called “On Recalling ANT”, [[Bruno Latour]] stated that there are four things wrong with actor-network theory: “actor”, “network”, “theory” and the hyphen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/sociology/research/publications/papers/latour-recalling-ant.pdf Keynote Speech: On Recalling ANT] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714210351/http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/sociology/research/publications/papers/latour-recalling-ant.pdf |date=July 14, 2014 }}, Lancester University, Department of Sociology&lt;/ref&gt; In a later book however (''[[Bruno Latour#Reassembling the Social|Reassembling the Social: An Introduction to Actor–Network–Theory]]''), Latour reversed himself, accepting the wide use of the term, “''including'' the hyphen” (Latour 2005:9).{{Full citation needed|date=May 2014}} He also remarked how he had been helpfully reminded that the ANT acronym “was perfectly fit for a blind, myopic, workaholic, trail-sniffing, and collective traveler” (the ant, Latour 2005:9) — qualitative hallmarks of actor-network [[epistemology]].

Adaptive Physical Education (APE) is a physical education program that accommodates the needs of students with disabilities, that may include or be a combination of mobility or physical impairments, sensory impairments, intellectual disabilities, emotional or behavioural disorders.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Health and Physical Education: Rationale - The Australian Curriculum v7.5|url = http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/health-and-physical-education/rationale|website = www.australiancurriculum.edu.au|accessdate = 2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Greenwood Dictionary of Education (2nd Edition)|last = Collins|first = J.W.|publisher = Praeger|year = 2011|isbn = |location = Westport, CT|pages = |url = http://www.ebrary.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au|last2 = O'Brien|first2 = N.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Physical education is important for the health and wellbeing of everyone, regardless of disabilities or not. APE programs are vital in maintaining and enhancing the quality of life for people with disabilities.

Australia’s physical education curriculum for adaptive students is currently the same as students without disabilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Australian education institutions are required by the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1992]] and the [https://education.gov.au/disability-standards-education Disability Standards for Education 2005] to instruct physical education to students with disabilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
Adaptive physical education evolved from medical treatments that were designed to cope with disabilities. In 1838, [[Perkins School for the Blind|Perkins School]] located in Boston, Massachusetts, an educational institute for visually impaired students, began introducing physical education programs for their students.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Adapted Physical Education and Sport|last = Winnick|first = J.P.|publisher = Human Kinetics|year = 2011|isbn = 9780736089180|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1870s, the [[Ohio School for the Deaf|Ohio school for the Deaf]] instituted organised sports into the school for their students.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Pehr Henrik Ling]], who founded the [http://www.gih.se/in-english/ Swedish School of Sports and Health Sciences] in 1813 in Stockholm, Sweden&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.gih.se/in-english/|title = GIH The Swedish School of Sports and Health Sciences: In English|date = |accessdate = |website = GIH The Swedish School of Sports and Health Sciences|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed medical gymnastic programs for people with disabilities in 1884.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Legislation ==
The legislation for the APE in Australia is as follows:
* [[Disability Discrimination Act 1992]] provides protection against any person that is discriminated against because of a disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.humanrights.gov.au/dda-guide-whats-it-all-about|title = D.D.A guide: What's it all about|date = |accessdate = |website = Australian Human Rights Commission|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [https://education.gov.au/disability-standards-education Disability Standards for Education 2005] defines the responsibilities of educational institutions for students with disabilities. It also ensures that students with disabilities have access and are engaging in education on the same basis as students without disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://education.gov.au/disability-standards-education|title = Disability Standards for Education|date = |accessdate = |website = Australian Government Department of Education and Training|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impairments and Disabilities ==

=== Mobility or Physical Impairments ===

==== Cerebral Palsy ====
* Cerebral palsy is a group of disorders that affects a person's motor control areas in the brain that hinders their ability to move. It can affect one or more body parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cerebralpalsy.org.au/what-is-cerebral-palsy/|title = What is cerebral palsy?|date = |accessdate = |website = Cerebral Palsy Alliance|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Brain Injury.jpg|thumb|Brain Injury]] --&gt;

==== Brain Injuries ====
* Brain injuries are injuries that diminish or impair physical, cognitive, social, behaviour or emotional functions of a person.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Spinal Cord Disabilities ====
* Spinal cord disabilities are damage to the vertebrae or nerves of the spinal column resulting from disease or injury. Spinal cord injuries are generally associated with a degree of [[paralysis]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Muscular, Joint, &amp; Central nervous system (CNS) Disabilities ====
* Muscular, joint, and CNS disabilities are generally progressive and degenerative diseases. They can cause atrophied muscles, reduce motor skills, shorten range of motion and hinder the ability to perform physical activities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
** [[Muscular dystrophy]] is a genetically inherited disease characterised by a progressive spread of weakness through various muscle groups or motor neurones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mda.org.au/Disorders/Overview.asp|title = What are muscular dystrophies and neuromuscular conditions?|date = |accessdate = |website = Muscular Dystrophy Australia|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Juvenile idiopathic arthritis|Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis]] causes persistent pain and swelling in joints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/juvenile-rheumatoid-arthritis/basics/definition/con-20014378|title = Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis: definition|date = |accessdate = |website = Mayo Clinic|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sensory Impairments ===

==== Visual impairments ====
* Visual impairments as defined by the [[Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children]] (RIDBC) as a limitation to one or more functions of the eye or visual systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ridbc.org.au/blindness|title = Vision|date = |accessdate = |website = The Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Deaf ====
* Deaf is severe or profound hearing loss that causes insufficient comprehension of auditory information.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Deafblind ====
* The [http://www.deafblind.org.au Australia Deafblind Council] (ADBC) defines deafblindness as an isolated sensory disability that results in a combination of loss to both vision and hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.deafblind.org.au|title = What is deafblindness?|date = |accessdate = |website = Australian Deafblind Council|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intellectual Disabilities &amp; Emotional, Developmental and Behavioural Disorders ===
* Intellectual disabilities are defined, by the [http://aaidd.org American Association of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD)], as a serious impediment of intellectual functioning and the ability to adapt behaviour in both social and practical skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://aaidd.org/intellectual-disability/definition#.VeV4D85UTsk|title = Definition of Intellectual Disability|date = |accessdate = |website = American Association of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Down syndrome|Down Syndrome]] is a genetic condition that causes developmental, intellectual and physical disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.downsyndromevictoria.org.au/DSAV/Information/About_Down_syndrome/What_is_Down_syndrome/DSAV/information/What_is_Down_syndrome.aspx?hkey=8593b017-ec7a-47f1-b949-e7e9801b4c39|title = What is Down Syndrome?|date = |accessdate = |website = Down Syndrome Victoria|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Emotional and behavioural disorders are generally labeled as having disruptive hyperactive, distracting, withdrawn and/or impetuous behaviour tendencies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These emotional and behavioural disorders can hinder and negatively affect a student's educational capabilities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
** [[Autism spectrum disorder]]s are developmental disabilities that affect how persons interact with their environment and the people around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.autismspectrum.org.au/content/what-autism|title = What is Autism|date = |accessdate = |website = Autism Spectrum|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disability Specific Guidelines for Instruction of APE ===
Impairments and disabilities for APE students can vary or may even coexist with more than one disability. A students physical capabilities in APE will depend on their impairment or disability. These impairments and/or disabilities need to be addressed in the design of the students APE curriculum by their teachers or instructors of APE to ensure that the student is receiving the most beneficial physical educational program.

=== Mobility Impairments ===
[[File:ParalympicsGB preparing for their 7-a-side game (9375546563).jpg|thumb|People with Cerebral Palsy competing in the Paralympic Games]]

==== Cerebral Palsy ====
* Students with cerebral palsy should carryout moderate aerobic activity for body composition and musculoskeletal functioning. Strength and flexibility training should be focused on maintaining a balance between flexor and extensor muscles. Motor coordination for students with cerebral palsy can be difficult, so balance and body coordination should be integrated into their APE program.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Brain Injuries ====
* Students of APE that have sustained brain injuries will commonly display balance problems and weak muscle movement. These students need to maintain moderate aerobic activity for body composition and musculoskeletal functioning. Strength training should be integrated to improve muscle weakness and motor control skills may need to be relearned.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Spinal Cord Disabilities ====
* Depending on the type of spinal cord disability that a student displays, will determine the type activities that are included in their APE program. Regardless of their spinal cord disability, these students need to engage in APE.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Muscular, Joint, &amp; Central Nervous System (CNS) disabilities ====
* Students that have muscular, joint, or CNS disabilities need to engage in strength training and endurance activities for as long as capably possible, due to the progressive nature of these disabilities. The APE teacher should ensure that an adequate warm-up and cool-down focusing on flexibility are performed by the students.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Sensory Impairments ===

==== Visual impairments ====
* Students with visual impairments have the capabilities to perform all the same physical activities as students without these impairments. However, due to lack or loss of vision, adaptations to some physical activities will need to be made for these students. Depending on the extent of their impairment, APE teachers can introduce bright colours balls or use audial cues to direct the students in physical activities. APE programs for these students should include open sports where there are changing variables, and closed sports where the activity is consistent and predictable.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Deaf ====
* Students that are deaf have no limitations to their physical capabilities. However, communication skills will need to be adapted for their impairment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Deafblind ====
* Students that have deafblindness have the ability to perform same physical activities as students without deafblindness. However, due to their impairment, adaptations that are used for blind and deaf students will need to be implemented into their APE program.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Intellectual Disabilities &amp; Emotional and Behavioural Disorders ===
Students with intellectual disabilities need to have APE programs that are appropriately designed and take into consideration their academic, physical, motor, social and emotional skills.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Students with emotional and behavioural disorders can create instructional dilemmas for APE teachers. Ideas for managing and instructing APE to these students are to have interpersonal communication, active listening, verbal mediation and conflict resolution schemes incorporated into the students physical education program.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:JBLM hosts Special Olympics 140530-A-QM563-008.jpg|thumb|Down Syndrome students competing in Special Olympics]]

==== Down Syndrome ====
* Students with Down Syndrome that participate in APE need medical clearance due to the many medical problems they face. However they should still engage in aerobic activities, muscle strengthening, motor control skills, and balance building activities. Adapted equipment can be used to engage students in these activities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Autism spectrum disorder ====
* Students that have been diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder do not necessarily need to be in an APE program. However, if it is decided that they need to participate in an APE program, the APE teacher needs to respond to the individual needs required by that student, which maybe one-on-one instruction. These students should engage in as much of the required PE curriculum as possible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''Bachelor of Computer Science''' or '''Bachelor of Science in Computer Science''' (abbreviated '''BCompSc''' or '''BCS''' or '''BS CS''' or '''B.Sc. CS''') is a type of [[bachelor's degree]], usually awarded after three or four years of collegiate study in [[computer science]], but possibly awarded in fewer years depending on factors such as an institution's course requirements and academic calendar. In some cases it can be awarded in five years. In general, computer science degree programs emphasize the mathematical and theoretical foundations of computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uowdubai.ac.ae/computer-science-and-engineering-programs/bachelor-of-computer-science-bcompsc-degree |title=Bachelor of Computer Science (BCOMPSC) Degree |publisher=[[University of Wollongong in Dubai]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same core curriculum may, depending on the school, result in other degrees, including:
* [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA) in Computer Science 
* Bachelor of Applied Science (BASc) in Computer Science
* Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering (B.Tech)
* Bachelor of Science in Information Technology 
* Bachelor of Mathematics in Computer Science  
* Bachelor of Engineering (BEng or BE) in Computer Science 
* Bachelor of Computing in Computer Science 
* [[Bachelor of Science]] in Engineering (Computer Science) - BSE (CS)
* Bachelor of Computer Security in Computer Science
* Bachelor of Science (BSc or BS) in Computer Science (BSc CS or BSCS or BSc (Comp)

In many post-secondary institutions, an '''Honors Bachelor of Computer Science''' degree has been introduced as an upgrade to the regular bachelor's program and usually requires at least one additional year of study.

==Typical requirements==
Because computer science is a wide field, courses required to earn a bachelor of computer science degree vary. A typical list of course requirements includes topics such as:&lt;ref 
name="monash_bcs_course_description"&gt;[http://www.monash.edu.au/study/coursefinder/course/2380/] Course description of the Bachelor of Computer Science at [[Monash University]], [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Computer programming]] 
* [[Programming paradigm]]s
* [[Algorithms]]
* [[Data structures]]

'''Bert Schiettecatte''' (born January 1, 1979) is a Belgian entrepreneur who created the [[Audiocubes]].

==Biography==

Bert Schiettecatte was born in [[Ghent]], [[Belgium]]. He has an electronic music production background . He holds an MSc in computer science from the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel|University of Brussels]] (VUB) and an MA/MST of Arts in Music, Science and Technology from [[CCRMA]], a department at [[Stanford University]] ([[BAEF]] grant).

While studying at [[CCRMA]], Bert Schiettecatte developed a strong interest in hardware engineering, electronics, and [[human-computer interaction]]. Together with Eto Otitigbe and Luigi Castelli, Bert Schiettecatte created a customized dance pad&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Monk's Mood, set for April 26-27, turns tap into narrative: 4/02 | url = http://www.stanford.edu/dept/news/pr/02/defrantz424.html/ | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20030822130659/http://www.stanford.edu/dept/news/pr/02/defrantz424.html | archivedate = 2003-08-22 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a laser harp&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title =The Laser Harp | url = https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~bschiett/harp/index.html/ | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070611063322/http://ccrma.stanford.edu/~bschiett/harp/index.html | archivedate = 2007-06-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; (such as the one of [[Jean-Michel Jarre]]), at [[CCRMA]].

After taking several research positions, Bert founded his company [[Percussa]] in 2004 to develop [[Tangible User Interface|tangible user interface]] technology for music making. [[Percussa]]'s first product, [[Audiocubes]], was launched in January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = AudioCubes at Namm 2007 | url = http://www.percussa.com/2007/01/30/audiocubes-at-namm-2007/ | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111003141853/http://www.percussa.com/2007/01/30/audiocubes-at-namm-2007/ | archivedate = 2011-10-03 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''body orifice''' is any opening in the body of an animal.

==External==
In a typical [[mammal]]ian body such as the [[human body]], the external body orifices are:

* The [[nostril]]s, for [[breath]]ing and the associated sense of [[olfaction|smell]]
* The [[mouth]], for [[eating]], breathing, and vocalizations such as [[Speech communication|speech]]
* The [[ear canal]]s, for the sense of [[hearing (sense)|hearing]] 
* The [[nasolacrimal duct]]s, to carry tears from the [[lacrimal sac]] into the [[nasal cavity]]
* The [[anus]], for [[defecation]]
* In [[male]]s, the [[urinary meatus]], for [[urination]] and [[ejaculation]]
* In [[female]]s, the [[urinary meatus]], for [[urination]]
* In [[female]]s, the [[vagina]], for [[menstruation]], [[sexual intercourse]] and [[childbirth]]
* The [[nipple]] orifices

Other animals may have some other body orifices:
*[[cloaca]], in [[bird]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[amphibians]], and some other animals
*[[Hyponome|siphon]] in [[mollusk]], [[arthropods]], and some other animals

==Internal==
Internal orifices include the orifices of the outflow tracts of the heart, between the [[heart valve]]s.

*[[Internal urethral orifice]]
*[[Mucosa]]
*[[Mucocutaneous boundary]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4544">From 2004-2014, the '''Cingranelli-Richards (CIRI) Human Rights Data Project''' annually rated the level of government respect for a variety of internationally recognized human rights. The final CIRI data set contains quantitative indicators of 15 human rights for 195 countries, annually from 1981-2011. The CIRI data were used in over 170 countries by scholars, students, policymakers, and analysts representing over 400 organizations. CIRI's founders and co-directors were political scientists Dr. [[David Cingranelli]] at [[Binghamton University]], SUNY &lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.binghamton.edu/political-science/faculty/david-cingranelli.html David L.

CIRI's data, documentation, and blog posts were archived at [http://www.humanrightsdata.com www.humanrightsdata.com].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanrightsdata.com CIRI Human Rights Data Project], website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accessing the data==

The CIRI data were free for not-for-profit users. Once registered, CIRI users could create customized datsets, choosing only the indicators, countries, and years they needed; or, they could download the entire data set. As of December 2007, CIRI began using its own numeric country identifier code, but continued to offer others for the purpose of data merging. The MyCIRI feature allowed users to store their datasets on the CIRI server and easily update them when the master CIRI data was updated.

==Financial support==

Financial support for the CIRI Data Project came from the United States' [[National Science Foundation]];&lt;ref&gt;National Science Foundation Grant Nos. SBR-9730130 (1997-1998), SES-0318273 (2004-2006), SES-0647969 (2007-2010), and SES-0647916 (2007-2010).&lt;/ref&gt; [[The World Bank]]; [[GTZ]]; [[Binghamton University]], SUNY; the Center on Democratic Performance at Binghamton University, SUNY; The Human Rights Institute and College of Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences at [[The University of Connecticut]].

==CIRI human rights indicators==

The CIRI database coded only human rights PRACTICES of governments. The human rights for which government levels of respect were annually rated by CIRI included:

* Assembly &amp; Association
* Disappearance
* Domestic Movement
* Electoral Self-Determination (formerly Political Participation &amp; Free and Fair Elections)
* Empowerment Rights Index (An additive index summarizing government respect for electoral self-determination, domestic movement, foreign movement, religion, speech, assembly &amp; association, and workers' rights)
* Extrajudicial Killing
* Foreign Movement
* Independence of the Judiciary
* Physical Integrity Rights Index (An additive index summarizing government respect for disappearance, extrajudicial killing, political imprisonment, and torture)
* Political Imprisonment
* Religion
* Speech
* Torture
* Women's Economic Rights
* Women's Political Rights
* Women's Social Rights
* Workers' Rights

Most of the CIRI indicators were ratings (as opposed to rankings) on a scale of 0-2 for their respect of human rights, as follows:

*0= Frequent violations of this right
*1= Some violations of this right
*2= No reported violations of this right

The CIRI database used the annual country reports from the US State Department and Amnesty International as its primary sources.

The '''California Institute of the Arts''' ('''CalArts''') is a private university in [[Santa Clarita, California]]. It was incorporated in 1961 as the first degree-granting institution of higher learning in the United States created specifically for students of both the [[visual art|visual]] and [[performing art]]s. It offers [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]], [[Master of Fine Arts]], [[Master of Arts]], and [[Doctor of Musical Arts]] degrees among six schools: Art; Critical Studies; Dance; Film/Video; Music; and Theater.&lt;ref&gt;https://calarts.edu/academics&lt;/ref&gt;

The school was first envisioned by many benefactors in the early 1960s, staffed by a diverse array of professionals (including [[Nelbert Chouinard|Nelbert Murphy Chouinard]], a founder of [[Chouinard Art Institute]], [[Walt Disney]], Lulu Von Hagen, Thornton Ladd and others).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rushkoff | first = Douglas | title =Media Virus: Hidden Agendas in Popular Culture | publisher = [[Ballantine Books]] | year = 1995 | page = 102| isbn = 0-345-39774-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; CalArts students develop their own work, over which they retain control and copyright, in a workshop atmosphere.

As of 2017, the school has a 27.5% acceptance rate.&lt;ref&gt;https://calarts.edu/about/institute/facts-and-figures&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, [[US News &amp; World Report]] has CalArts ranked #9 of "Best Graduate Fine Arts Programs." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-fine-arts-schools/fine-arts-rankings&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
CalArts was originally formed in 1961, as a merger of the [[Chouinard Art Institute]] (founded 1921) and the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music (founded 1883).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://calarts.edu/about/history | title=CalArts: History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of the formerly existing institutions were going through financial difficulties around the same time, and the founder of the Art Institute, Nelbert Chouinard, was mortally ill. The professional relationship between Madame Chouinard and Walt Disney began in 1929 when Disney had no money and Madame Chouinard agreed to train Disney's first animators on a pay-later basis. It was through the vision of Disney, who discovered and trained many of his studio artists at Chouinard (including [[Mary Blair]], [[Maurice Noble]] and some of the [[Nine Old Men]], among others), that the merger of the two institutions was coordinated; the process continued after his death in 1966.&lt;ref name="RootsLAT"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-04-29/entertainment/ca-100_1_robert-perine-calarts-herbert-blau |title=The Roots of CalArts | accessdate=18 March 2012 | work=Los Angeles Times | date=April 29, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joining him were his brother [[Roy O. Disney]], Lulu Von Hagen and Thornton Ladd (Ladd &amp; Kelsey, Architects), of the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music. The original board of trustess at CalArts included  [[Harrison Price]], [[Retlaw Enterprises| Royal Clark]], Robert W. Corrigan,  [[Roy E. Disney]], [[Roy O. Disney]], film producer Z. Wayne Griffin, [[H. R. Haldeman]], Ralph Hetzel (then vice-president of [[Motion Picture Association of America]]), [[Chuck Jones]], Ronald Miller, [[Millard Sheets]], attorney Maynard Toll, bank executive G. Robert Truex Jr. , [[Jerry Wexler]], [[Meredith Willson]], Peter McBean and Scott Newhall (descendants of [[Henry Newhall]]),  and the wives of [[Roswell Gilpatric]], J.L. Hurschler, Richard R. Von Hagen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://scvhistory.com/scvhistory/tn6902b.htm| title=Program: CalArts Groundbreaking }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, the Alumni Association was founded as a nonprofit organization and was governed by a 12-member board of directors to serve the best interests of the institute and its programs. Members included leading professional artists and musicians, who contributed their knowledge, experience and skill to strengthen the institute. The 12 founding board of directors members were [[Mary Costa]], [[Edith Head]], [[Gale Storm]], [[Marc Davis (animator)|Marc Davis]], [[Tony Duquette]], [[Harold Grieve]], [[John Hench]], [[Chuck Jones]], [[Henry Mancini]], [[Marty Paich]], [[Nelson Riddle]] and [[Millard Sheets]].

The ground-breaking for CalArts' current campus took place May 3, 1969. However, construction of the new campus was hampered by torrential rains, labor troubles and the [[1971 San Fernando earthquake|earthquake in 1971]]. CalArts moved to its present campus in the [[Valencia, Santa Clarita, California|Valencia]] section of the city of [[Santa Clarita, California]] in November 1971. From the beginning, CalArts was plagued by the tensions between its art and trade school functions as well as between the non-commercial aspirations of the students and faculty and the conservative interests of the Disney family and trustees. The founding board of trustees originally planned on creating CalArts as a school in an entertainment complex, a destination like Disneyland, and a feeder school for the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://clancco.com/wp/2007/01/intervview_sergio-muoz-sarmiento_cal-arts_law/| title=Interview with Tom Lawson, Dean of CalArts School of Art, January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a model is exemplified in the 1941 Disney film [[The Reluctant Dragon (1941 film)|The Reluctant Dragon]]. In an ironic turn of fate, they appointed Dr. Robert W. Corrigan as the first president of the Institute.

Corrigan, former dean of the School of Arts at [[New York University]] fired almost all the artists and teachers from Chouinard in his attempt to remake CalArts into his personal vision. [[Herbert Blau]] was hired as the Institute's provost and dean of the School of Theater and Dance. Subsequently, Blau was instrumental in hiring a number of professionals like [[Mel Powell]] (dean of the School of Music), [[Paul Brach]] (dean of the School of Art), [[Alexander Mackendrick]] (dean of the School of Film/Video), sociologist [[Maurice R. Stein]] (dean of Critical Studies), and [[Richard Farson]] (dean of the School of Design; now integrated in the Art school as the Graphic Design program), as well as other influential program heads and teachers such as Stephan von Huene, [[Allan Kaprow]], [[Bella Lewitzky]], [[Michael Asher (artist)|Michael Asher]], [[Jules Engel]], [[John Baldessari]], [[Judy Chicago]], [[Ravi Shankar]], [[Max Kozloff]], [[Miriam Shapiro]], [[Douglas Huebler]], [[Morton Subotnick]], [[Norman M. Klein]] and [[Nam June Paik]]  most of whom largely came from a [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] and [[avant-garde]] side of the art world. The fundamental principles established at the Institute by Blau and the late Corrigan included ideas like “no technique in advance of need,” and that a curriculum should be cyclical rather than sequential, returning to root principles at regular intervals, and that “we’re a community of artists here, some of us called faculty and some called students."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.robertbenedetti.com/AwardSpeech.htm | title=Robert Benedetti-Acceptance speech for athe career achievement award}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corrigan held his position until 1972, when he was replaced by William S. Lund, a Disney son-in-law. Within a month of Lund's tenure as president, 55 of CalArts' 325 faculty and staff were fired. Structured schedules were introduced. Classes were trimmed back and, within a year, the Institute was operating on budget. Some credit Lund with saving CalArts. Others see his tenure as the end of an idealistic experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-04-15/entertainment/ca-1889_1_walt-disney/2 |title=A Tradition of Tradition-Be-Damned  | accessdate=17 March 2012 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=David | last=Wharton | date=April 15, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, [[Robert Fitzpatrick (art executive)|Robert J. Fitzpatrick]] was appointed new president of CalArts. Holding this position for 12 years, in 1987
Fitzpatrick resigned as president to head [[Euro Disney S.C.A|Euro Disney]] in Paris. Nicholas England, former dean of the School of Music, was appointed acting president. One year later, [[Steven Lavine]], associate director for arts and humanities at the Rockefeller Foundation, was named new president.

On June 24, 2015 Steven D. Lavine announced he would step down as President of the California Institute of the Arts in May 2017, after an unprecedented 29-year tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-calarts-column-20150624-story.html|title=CalArts President Steven D. Lavine to Step Down in Spring of 2017|last=|first=|date=2014-06-24|website=|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concluding a search with over 500 candidates, the CalArts Board of Directors announced on December 13, 2016 that Ravi S. Rajan,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://president.calarts.edu|title=Introducing the next President at CalArts — Ravi Rajan|website=Introducing the next President at CalArts|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dean of the School of the Arts at the [[State University of New York at Purchase]] was unanimously elected as President, to begin in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/miranda/la-et-cam-ravi-rajan-calarts-20161213-story.html|title=CalArts names Ravi Rajan president, the first Asian American to be named to the post|last=Miranda|first=Carolina A.|website=latimes.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the summer of 1987, CalArts became the host of the state-funded [[California State Summer School for the Arts]] (CSSSA) program. It began as a program to nurture talented high school students in the fields of [[animation]], [[creative writing]], [[dance]], [[experimental film|film]] and [[video art|video]], [[music]], [[theatre arts]], and [[visual arts]]. CalArts expanded on the concept by creating the [[Community Arts Partnership]] in 1990. While CSSSA is open to qualifying California students, CAP, as it is commonly known, is a service provided to students living within underprivileged communities in the Los Angeles County school system. Many CalArts faculty and students mentor the high school students in both programs.

In 1994, [[Herb Alpert]], a professional musician and admirer of the Institute, established the [[Alpert Awards in the Arts]] in collaboration with CalArts and his nonprofit the Herb Alpert Foundation. While the foundation provides the award for winning recipients, the school's faculty in the fields film/new media, visual arts, theatre, dance, and music select artists in their field to nominate an individual artist who is recognized for their innovation in their given medium. Recipients of this award are required to stay for a week as visiting artists at CalArts and mentor students studying their metier. In 2008, CalArts renamed the School of Music in his name, courtesy of a $15 million donation.

Over the years, the school has also developed on-campus, interdisciplinary laboratories, such as the [[Center for Experiments in Art, Information, and Technology]], [[Center for Integrated Media]], [[Center for New Performance at CalArts]], and the Cotsen Center for Puppetry and the Arts.

==Academics==
CalArts offers degree programs in [[music]], [[art]], [[Contemporary dance|dance]], [[experimental film|film]] and [[video art|video]], [[animation]], [[Experimental theatre|theater]], [[puppetry]], and [[creative writing|writing]].  Students receive intensive professional training in the area of their career purpose without being cast into a rigid pattern. Its focus is in [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]], [[contemporary art]], and the Institute's stated mission is to develop professional artists of tomorrow- artists who will change their field.  With these goals in place, the Institute encourages students to recognize the complexity of political, social and aesthetic questions and to respond to them with informed, independent judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://alpertawards.org/about/calarts | title=CalArts Statement }} for {{cite web | url=http://www.alpertawards.org/ | title=The Alpert Award in the Arts }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Admission===
Every school within the Institute requires that applicants send in an [[artist's statement]], along with a [[Career portfolio|portfolio]] or [[Audition (performing arts)|audition]] (depending on the Program) in order to be considered for admission. The school does not review an applicant's [[SAT]] scores without consent of the applicant, and does not consider an applicant's [[GPA]] as part of the admission process.

In a 2016 interview, design program faculty member Michael Worthington was asked "'''What kinds of students do best at CalArts?''', to which he responded, ''Energetic, enthusiastic, self-motivated, fast learners, idiosyncratic aesthetes, verbal and visual adventurers, risk takers, those who are smart and vocal with a critical eye for their own work and the work of others. Having technical, formal and typographical skills helps, but we can teach those things. Raw intelligence and criticality and an adventurous side matter more at the start. Above all, the students that do best are those that are committed to design and who are willing to put the time and energy into their own development and learning.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://motionographer.com/2016/02/18/school-profile-calarts/ |title=School Profile: CalArts | accessdate=21 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conception and foundation===
The initial concept behind CalArts' interdisciplinary approach came from [[Richard Wagner]]'s idea of [[Gesamtkunstwerk]] ("total artwork"), which Disney himself was fond of and explored in a variety of forms, beginning with his own studio, then later in the incorporation of CalArts. He began with the classic Disney film ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940), where animators, dancers, composers, and artists alike collaborated. In 1952, [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] was founded, where Disney integrated artists from his animation studio and elsewhere, as well as formally trained engineers and achieved creative critical mass in the development of [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]]. He believed that the same concept that developed WDI, could also be applied to a university setting, where art students of different mediums would be exposed to and explore a wide range of creative directions. Disney himself has stated of his memorial school:

{{cquote|If you keep busy, your work might lead you into paths you might not expect. I’ve always operated like the [[The Three Princes of Serendip|princes of Serendip]], who went on quests not knowing what they would find.  That happens in science; some of our most important discoveries have come from scientists who were searching for something else. What young artists need is a school where they can learn a variety of skills, a place where there is cross-pollination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calarts.edu/~alumni/reunion/Images/Current_Insert.pdf |title=CalArts 30th Anniversary speech |format=PDF }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remarkable thing that’s taking place in almost every field of endeavor is an accelerating rate of dynamic growth and change. The arts, which have historically symbolized the advance of human progress, must match this growth if they are going to maintain their value in and influence on society.  The talents of musicians, the self-expression of the actor, and the techniques and applications of fine and commercial artist are being use more and more in today's business-not by themselves but rather, in close association with each other. What we must have, then, is a completely new approach to training in the arts-an entirely new educational concept which will properly prepare artists and give them the vital tools so necessary for working in, and drawing from, every field of creativity and performance. I like the workshop idea, with students being able to drop in and learn all kinds of arts. A school should offer a kind of cross-pollination that would develop the best in its students. That is the direction I would like CalArts to take. It shouldn’t be a school where studies are rigid and narrow. Students should be able to study the whole spectrum of the arts.  Perhaps a musician would find he is more talented in arts; and vice versa. There is an urgent need for a professional school which will not only give its students thorough training in a specific field, but will also allow the widest possible range of artistic growth and expression. To meet this need is exactly why California Institute of the Arts has been created, and why we all believe so strongly in its importance. Students will be able to take anything - art, drama, music, dance, writing. They'll graduate with a degree of Bachelor of Fine Arts, and if they want a Bachelor of Arts they can go to other colleges and acquire a few more credits. The student body of CalArts shouldn't be over two thousand, and as many as possible should reside on campus. There should be some allowance for those who are talented, yet are not students; they should be able to express themselves without worrying about grades. There will be a lot of scholarships at CalArts. Those who can pay will pay; those who can't will get scholarships. We don't want any dilettantes at CalArts. We want people with talent. That will be the one factor in getting into CalArts: talent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.calarts.edu/newspaper/mar00/what.html | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20030707181300/http://www.calarts.edu/newspaper/mar00/what.html | archivedate= 2003-07-07 | title="What about an Integrated School? What would Walt say?", CalArts Newspaper, March 2000. }}&lt;/ref&gt; It's the principal thing I hope to leave when I move on to greener pastures. If I can help provide a place to develop the talent of the future, I think I will have accomplished something.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mag.awn.com/index.php?ltype=pageone&amp;article_no=2235&amp;page=3 | title=The Birth of Animation Training | accessdate=26 November 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041028150852/http://mag.awn.com/index.php?ltype=pageone&amp;article_no=2235&amp;page=3 | archivedate=28 October 2004 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Facilities==

===Walt Disney Modular Theatre===
The Walt Disney Modular Theatre is an indoor performance space located within the California Institute of the Arts.

Funded by Lillian Disney, who lent support to Walt's venture into education, her gift to the school to remodel a campus theater and rename it the Walt Disney Modular Theatre in 1993. The modular theater is based on a concept suggested by [[Antonin Artaud]], who asserted that the ideal theater could be reconfigured for each and every new performance or play. When [[Walt Disney]] founded his Institute of the Arts, he requested suggestions from leaders in various artistic fields as to what would be the ideal tools for advancing the study and practice of their medium. One of the overwhelmingly popular suggestions from the theater community was a modular theater as suggested by Artaud. Disney had the Modular Theatre incorporated as the central performance space of his Institute. It was the first of its kind constructed, and remains one of only five in the world.

The chief feature of the theater is a segmented floor, divided into 348 4'x4' square platforms, each mounted on its own independent pneumatic pistons, allowing the floor to be reconfigured into whatever shape is desired. The theater is also composed of segmented pieces, so that walls can also be easily reconfigured, creating a virtually limitless number of possibilities in design. The theater is two stories tall from floor to ceiling—the [[pneumatic]] pistons reach another story down into the CalArts library, where they are a dominating architectural feature. There are doors on all sides of the theater so that the audience can be made to enter from whatever direction the artists choose. The theater can be divided into several playing spaces, the audience can be separated into several sections, and any combination of levels and directions can be used. The theater can also be configured into an environmental space, with the audience moving through multiple locations in the course of a show, or being presented with a virtual environment rather than one in which they are separate from the performance.

The Walt Disney Modular Theater is employed year-round by students and faculty at the CalArts, primarily those in the schools of Theater, Dance, and Music. Though the idea of modular theater has fallen out of fashion, in favor of environmental theater and the resurgence of [[proscenium]] spectacle theater, the theater remains in use, run by the Technical Direction Department, including both students and faculty.

It was designed by Fisher Dachs Associates, a collaboration between the Dean of the Theater School, [[Herbert Blau]], lighting designer [[Jules Fisher]], and Thornton Ladd (Ladd &amp; Kelsey, Architects).

===A113===
{{Main|A113}}

A113 is an [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] that has been inserted into several animated television shows and feature films as a homage to a classroom at CalArts.

===Roy and Edna Disney CalArts Theater at Walt Disney Concert Hall===
{{main|REDCAT}}

In 2003, CalArts established a performance theater in downtown Los Angeles called REDCAT, the Roy and Edna Disney CalArts Theater at Walt Disney Concert Hall. The Center for New Performance, the professional producing arm of the CalArts Theater School, brings works to the space from both student and professional artists and musicians.

===Wild Beast===

In fall 2009, the Institute opened an on-campus music pavilion, known as the "Wild Beast". The {{convert|3200|sqft|m2|adj=on}}, free-standing structure serves as a space for classrooms and combined indoor-outdoor performance space. CalArts' President Steven Lavine has stated, “The core demand is that our Herb Alpert School of Music has doubled in size in the last decade; when we have guest artists, there is no place for them to perform&amp;mdash;And the second reason was to allow enough space for the general public to attend [...]”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/02/calarts-is-addi.html |title=CalArts is adding a Wild Beast to its menagerie | accessdate=19 March 2012 | work=Los Angeles Times | date=February 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Baldessari Art Studio Building===
In 2013, CalArts opened its John Baldessari Art Studio Building, which cost $3.1 million to build and features approximately 7,000 square feet of space—much of it used as studio space for art students and faculty.&lt;ref&gt;David Ng (November 29, 2013), [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-calarts-john-baldessari-20131127,0,7368564.story#ixzz2mLsg6Nv6 CalArts names new art studio building after John Baldessari]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140206093355/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-calarts-john-baldessari-20131127%2C0%2C7368564.story |date=February 6, 2014 }} ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception and cultural influence==

In 2011, [[Newsweek]]/The Daily Beast listed CalArts as the top school for arts-minded students. The ranking was not aimed to assess the country's best art school, but rather to assess campuses that offer an exceptional artistic atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Ziemba |first=Christine N.|title=Newsweek/Daily Beast Ranks CalArts as Nation’s Most ‘Artistic’ College|url=http://blog.calarts.edu/2011/08/30/newsweekdaily-beast-ranks-calarts-as-nations-most-artistic-college/|accessdate=3 September 2014|newspaper=CalArts 24700|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ng|first=David|title=CalArts named top school for arts-minded students|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2011/09/calarts-named-top-arts-school-in-new-ranking.html|accessdate=3 September 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, during the groundbreaking ceremony of the Valencia campus, as [[Lillian Disney]] turned over the first shovel full of soil, director [[Bob Clampett]] stood behind her mugging for the flashing cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sito|first=Tom|title=Walt’s Jalopy: Animator Training through the Decades |url=http://www.awn.com/animationworld/walt-s-jalopy-animator-training-through-decades|accessdate=3 September 2014|newspaper=Animation World Network|date=September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several students who attended CalArts' animation programs in the 1970s eventually found work at [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]], and several of those went on to successful careers at Disney, [[Pixar]], and other animation studios.  In March 2014, ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine highlighted the success of CalArts' 1970s animation alumni and briefly profiled several (including [[Jerry Rees]], [[John Lasseter]], [[Tim Burton]], [[John Musker]], [[Brad Bird]], [[Gary Trousdale]], [[Kirk Wise]], [[Henry Selick]] and [[Nancy Beiman]]) in an article illustrated with a group portrait taken by photographer [[Annie Leibovitz]] inside classroom [[A113]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kashner|first=Sam|title=The Class That Roared|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2014/03/calarts-animation-1970s-tim-burton|accessdate=6 April 2014|newspaper=Vanity Fair|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late eighties, a group of CalArts animation students contacted animation director [[Ralph Bakshi]]. As he was in the process of moving to New York, they persuaded him to stay in Los Angeles to continue to produce [[adult animation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wharton|first=David|title=Ralph Bakshi Works Still Getting People Animated  |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-07-27/entertainment/ca-6468_1_ralph-bakshi-works|accessdate=14 September 2014|newspaper=LA Times|date=July 27, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakshi then got the production rights to the cartoon character [[Mighty Mouse]]. By Bakshi's request, [[Tom Minton]] and [[John Kricfalusi]] then went to the CalArts campus to recruit the best talent from what was the recent group of graduates. They hired [[Jeff Pidgeon]], [[Rich Moore]], Carole Holiday, [[Andrew Stanton]] and Nate Kanfer to work on the then-new ''[[Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures]]'' television series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hill|first=Scott|title=Q&amp;A: Toon Titan John Kricfalusi Hails Mighty Mouse Rebirth  |url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2010/01/john-kricfalusi/ |newspaper=Wired Magazine|date=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview, Craig "Spike" Decker of [[Spike and Mike's Festival of Animation]] commented on the work of independent animator [[Don Hertzfeldt]] stating that Hertzfeldt demonstrated good instincts coupled with his lack of interest in the world of commerce. In making a comparison, Decker made a reference to CalArts stating: "A lot of animators come out of CalArts — they could be so prolific, but then they're owned by Disney or someone, and they're painting the fins on the Little Mermaid. You'll never see their full potential".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Timberg|first=Scott|title=Don Hertzfeldt is the most inventive underground animator in America. Will he ever make his peace with Hollywood? |url=http://www.bitterfilms.com/articles-e.html|accessdate=14 September 2014|newspaper=New Times L.A. |date=February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon, members of the band [[Sonic Youth]], remarked in an interview with [[VH1]] about the band [[Liars (band)|Liars]], of which Angus Andrew and Julian Gross are CalArts luminaries. Moore's initial remarks were: "There's this whole world of young people who [think] everything's allowed. What Liars are doing right now is completely crazy. I saw them the other night and it was really great. It's really out-there". Gordon then stated "I'm not so crazy about the way [the Liars' They Were Wrong, So We Drowned] sounds. It's like 'how lo-fi can we make it?' But I think the content is really good". In reference to CalArts and Gordon's statement, Moore lastly remarked "They're art kids. They came out of CalArts and that's the kind of sensibility you have when you come out of these sort of places."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bottomley |first=C. |title=Sonic Youth: Medicine For Your Ear |url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/interview/1486965/05122004/sonic_youth.jhtml |accessdate=9 March 2015 |newspaper=VH1.com |date=May 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110508163128/http://www.vh1.com/artists/interview/1486965/05122004/sonic_youth.jhtml |archivedate=May 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[LA Weekly]]'' op-ed piece "The Kids Aren’t All Right: Is over-education killing young artists?", published in 2005, curator [[Aaron Rose]] wrote about an observed trend he recognized in Los Angeles's most esteemed art schools and their MFA programs, including CalArts. He uses the example of Supersonic, "a large exhibition […] that features the work of MFA students from esteemed area programs like CalArts, Art Center, UCLA, etc." In his observation of the showcase he examined, "[...] the work left me mostly empty and with a few exceptions seemed like nothing more than a rehash of conceptual ideas that were mined years ago." He went on to state that "these institutions are staffed with amazing talents (Mike Kelley and John Baldessari among them). Legions of creative young people flock to our city [Los Angeles] every year to work alongside their heroes and develop their talents with hopes of making it as an artist." He goes on to further state "What happens too often in these situations, though, is that we find young artists simply emulating their instructors, rather than finding and honing their own aesthetics and points of view about the world, society, themselves. In the beginnings of an artist’s career, the power in his or her work should lie not in their technique or knowledge of art history or theory or business acumen, but in what one has to say."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rose |first=Aaron|title=The Kids Aren’t All Right  |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2005-10-27/news/the-kids-aren-t-all-right/?showFullText=true |accessdate=3 September 2014|newspaper=LA Weekly|date=October 27, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary artist Amanda Charchian was asked in an interview what she disliked about going to art school. In her response, she noted, "Most of my teachers came from the 1970′s CalArts conceptual art world, so they had us deconstruct everything we did in terms of the material being the message ([[Truth to materials]]). So if I used marble it had to be about social class, ancient sculpture, heaviness, etc. There was this idea that there’s nothing in the work that couldn’t relate to why you made it. Intuition was never enough of a reason."&lt;ref&gt;Kathan, Emma.

CalArts graduates have joined or started successful pop bands, including: [[The Belle Brigade]], [[The Weirdos]], [[Bedroom Walls]], Beelzabubba, [[Dawn of Midi]], [[The Rippingtons]], [[Fitz and The Tantrums]], [[Fol Chen]], [[London After Midnight (band)|London After Midnight]], [[No Doubt]], [[Mission of Burma]], Radio Vago, [[Oingo Boingo]], Secret Circuit, [[Liars (band)|Liars]], [[The Mae Shi]], [[Ozomatli]], and Jack Ruby.

Today, CalArts is recognized alongside [[Black Mountain College]] and the [[Nova Scotia College of Art and Design]] as one of the truly successful experiments in American arts education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fv.calarts.edu/main/moma.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620044408/http://fv.calarts.edu/main/moma.html |archivedate=June 20, 2006 |title="CalArts @ Moma", CalArts F/V website |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pixar University===
'''Pixar University''' is an in-house professional-development program within Pixar that expands the concept of employee education by broadening its focus from skills training to a more general fine-arts education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hempel|first=Jessi|title=Pixar University: Thinking Outside The Mouse|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Pixar-University-Thinking-Outside-The-Mouse-2611923.php|accessdate=16 August 2014|newspaper=SF Gate|date=June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the educational model of CalArts. The program offers more than 110 courses: a complete film-making curriculum, classes on painting, drawing, sculpting and creative writing, which usually last four to sixteen weeks. These classes are available not only for animators, but everyone, from the security guard to cafeteria chef.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=William C. |title=How Pixar Adds a New School of Thought to Disney |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/29/business/yourmoney/29pixar.html?ei=5090&amp;en=1579be4d45b9f9bb&amp;ex=1296190800&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=16 August 2014|newspaper=NY Times|date=January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this setting, employees are allowed to miss work for a full slate in classes (about 14 per week) to raise the level of the best, cross-train, and develop mastery in whatever subjects may interest them. The vision behind the university is for employees to try new things, work together better and test new ideas, but one of the most important benefits from the program is to build morale, spirit and communication among employees. The dean of Pixar University, Randy S. Nelson, explains: "We've made the leap from an idea-centered business to a people-centered business. Instead of developing ideas, we develop people. Instead of investing in ideas, we invest in people. We're trying to create a culture of learning, filled with lifelong learners. It's no trick for talented people to be interesting, but it's a gift to be interested. We want an organization filled with interested people.".&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;

==Controversy==

===Title IX Complaint===
On August 29, 2014 a freshman student identified as Regina filed a Title IX complaint against CalArts, regarding CalArts' improper response to her reported rape by a classmate. According to [[Aljazeera]], the CalArts administration questioned the victim, "...ask[ing] her questions about her drinking habits, how often she partied, the length of her dress, how oral rape was even possible, whether she climaxed and whether climaxing was an issue when she'd been with her alleged rapist before."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She was subjected to retaliation from friends of the perpetrator. The student filed a complaint against CalArts with the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights, which was dismissed. The perpetrator was suspended for a year.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gordon|first=Claire|title=CalArts to alleged rape victim: How long was your dress?|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/america-tonight/articles/2014/10/14/calarts-sexual-assault.html|accessdate=17 October 2016|newspaper=Aljazeera America|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; CalArts students walked out of their classes and protested in solidarity with the victim on October 23, later initiating a student-led meeting to discuss the issue of sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Song|first=Jason|title=CalArts students protest school's handling of rape allegations |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-calarts-protest-rape-20141023-story.html|accessdate=17 October 2016|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jahad|first=Shirley|title=CalArts students protest handling of rape cases |url=http://www.scpr.org/news/2014/10/24/47627/calarts-students-protest-handling-of-rape-cases/|accessdate=17 October 2016|newspaper=89.3 KPCC|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Heddaya|first=Mostafa|title=After Walkout, CalArts Students Organize Against Administration |url=http://hyperallergic.com/158304/after-walkout-calarts-students-organize-against-administration/|accessdate=17 October 2016|newspaper=Hyperallergic|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7044">In the [[social science|social sciences]], '''coding''' is an analytical process in which data, in both [[quantitative research|quantitative]] form (such as [[questionnaire]]s results) or [[qualitative research|qualitative]] form (such as [[interview]] [[:wikt:transcript|transcript]]s) are categorized to facilitate analysis.

One purpose of coding is to [[data transformation|transform the data]] into a form suitable for computer-aided analysis. This categorization of [[information]] is an important step, for example, in preparing [[data]] for [[computer]] processing with [[List of statistical packages|statistical software]].

Some studies will employ multiple coders working independently on the same data. This minimizes the chance of [[observational error|errors]] from coding and is believed to increase the [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] of data.

==Directive==
One code should apply to only one category and categories should be comprehensive. There should be clear guidelines for ''coders'' (individual who do the coding) so that code is consistent.

==Quantitative approach==
For quantitative analysis, data is coded usually into [[levels of measurement|measured and recorded as nominal or ordinal]] [[Variable (programming)|variables]].

Questionnaire data can be ''pre-coded'' (process of assigning codes to expected answers on designed questionnaire), ''field-coded'' (process of assigning codes as soon as data is available, usually during [[fieldwork]]), ''post-coded'' (coding of [[Open-ended question|open question]]s on completed questionnaires) or ''office-coded'' (done after fieldwork). Note that some of the above are not mutually exclusive.

In social sciences, [[spreadsheets]] such as [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] and more advanced software packages such as [[R (programming language)|R]], [[Matlab]], [[PSPP]]/[[SPSS]], [[DAP (software)|DAP]]/[[SAS System|SAS]], [[MiniTab]] and [[Stata]] are often used.

==Qualitative approach==
For disciplines in which a [[qualitative research|qualitative]] format is preferential, including [[ethnography]], [[humanistic geography]] or [[phenomenological psychology]] a varied approach to coding can be applied. Iain Hay (2005) outlines a two-step process beginning with basic coding in order to distinguish overall themes, followed by a more in depth, interpretive code in which more specific trends and patterns can be interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;Hay, I. (2005). ''Qualitative research methods in human geography'' (2nd ed.). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of qualitative coding can be attributed to either grounded or ''a priori'' coding.&lt;ref&gt;Saldaña, Johnny. (2015). "The Coding Manual for Qualitative Researchers" (3rd ed.). SAGE Publications Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; Grounded coding refers to allowing notable themes and patterns emerge from the document themselves, where as ''a priori'' coding requires the researcher to apply pre-existing theoretical frameworks to analyze the documents. As coding methods are applied across various texts, the researcher is able to apply axial coding, which is the process of selecting core thematic categories present in several documents to discover common patterns and relations.&lt;ref&gt;Grbich, Carol. (2013). "Qualitative Data Analysis" (2nd ed.). The Flinders University of South Australia: SAGE Publications Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to constructing categories, a researcher must apply a first cycle coding method. There are a multitude of methods available, and a researcher will want to pick one that is suited for the format and nature of their documents. Not all methods can be applied to every type of document. Some examples of first cycle coding methods include:

*''In Vivo Coding'': codes terms and phrases used by the participants themselves. The objective is to attempt to give the participants a voice in the research.
*''Process Coding'': this method uses gerunds ("-ing" words) only to describe and display actions throughout the document. It is useful for examining processes, emotional phases and rituals.
*''Versus Coding'': uses binary terms to describe groups and processes. The goal is to see which processes and organizations are in conflict with each other throughout the document. These can be both conceptual and grounded objects. 
*''Values Coding'': codes that attempt to exhibit the inferred values, attitudes and beliefs of participants. In doing so, the research may discern patterns in world views.

The process can be done manually, which can be as simple as highlighting different concepts with different colours, or fed into a software package. Some examples of [[computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software|qualitative software packages]] include [[Atlas.ti]], [[MAXQDA]], [[NVivo]], and [[QDA Miner]].

After assembling codes it is time to organize them into broader themes and categories. The process generally involves identifying themes from the existing codes, reducing the themes to a manageable number, creating hierarchies within the themes and then linking themes together through theoretical modeling.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Gery and H. Bernard. (2003). "Techniques to Identify Themes." Field Methods. Vol.15(1). pp85-109.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memos==
Creating memos during the coding process is integral to both grounded and a priori coding approaches. Qualitative research is inherently reflexive; as the researcher delves deeper into their subject, it is important to chronicle their own thought processes through reflective or methodological memos, as doing so may highlight their own subjective interpretations of data &lt;ref&gt;Primeau, Loree A. (2003). "Reflections on Self in Qualitative Research: Stories of Family" The American Journal of Occupational Therapy. Vol. 57, 9-16&lt;/ref&gt; It is crucial to begin memoing at the onset of research. Regardless of the type of memo produced, what is important is that the process initiates critical thinking and productivity in the research. Doing so will facilitate easier and more coherent analyses as the project draws on &lt;ref&gt;Charmaz, Kathy. (2006). "Constructing Grounded Theory: A Practical Guide through Qualitative Analysis." SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;
Memos can be used to map research activities, uncover meaning from data, maintaining research momentum and engagement and opening communication.&lt;ref&gt;Birks et al. (2008). "Memoing in qualitative research" Journal of Research in Nursing. SAGE Publications. Vol. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10676">Juvenile law pertains to those who are deemed to be below the [[age of majority]], which varies by country and culture. Usually, minors are treated differently under the law. However, even minors may be prosecuted as adults.

== Summary ==
In both [[France]] and the [[United States]], some actions are prohibited to minors, such as the underage consumption of alcohol or tobacco, truancy, running away from home, and ungovernability. A minor can thus become a [[status offender]].

===United States===
In the United States, the juvenile varies in definition from state to state. The system applies to anyone between the ages of 6 to 10, depending on the state, and 18;&lt;ref&gt;[[American juvenile justice system]]&lt;/ref&gt; except for 11 states (including Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, South Carolina, and Texas), where a juvenile is a person under 17 and New York and North Carolina, where it is under 15.&lt;ref&gt;[[juvenile law]]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, criminal majority begins at 16, 17, or 18.

The federal Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Act of 1974 set up four key requirements&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncpa.org/ba/ba235.html The federal ''Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Act''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130182242/http://www.ncpa.org/ba/ba235.html |date=2006-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for US minors:
* Firstly, the deinstitutionalization of status offenders, moving them from juvenile hall to community-based or family-based environments.
* Secondly, segregation (sight and sound separation) between juvenile and adult offenders
* Thirdly,  strong limitation for the juvenile justice system to put juveniles in adult jails.
*Fourthly, the protection of minority groups from being overrepresented in high-security facilities.

All states participate except South Dakota and Wyoming.

===France===
France has three stages of minors:&lt;ref&gt;''[http://fr.jurispedia.org/index.php/Minorité_pénale_%28fr%29 Jurispedia, Minorité pénale]'' in French&lt;/ref&gt;
* The infant, still without a perception of acts yet, commits no offence and so cannot be convicted.
* A minor between 7/8 and 13 has his own discernment. No criminal punishment but only educative measures can be pronounced against him, according to a 2002 law.
* A minor between 13 and 18 who commits an offence can have punishment that is educational or, in special cases, criminal.

The criminal irresponsibility of children under 13 is defined by the Article 122-8 of the Criminal Code. Those between 13 and 18 are assumed to be irresponsible, but they can be involved in a criminal sentence if the circumstances and the juvenile's delinquent personality justify.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.senat.fr/lc/lc52/lc525.html Sénat]'' in French&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation ==
According to Jean Pierre Rosenczveig, a children's judge in [[Bobigny]], near [[Paris]], the juvenile criminal law in France has six key requirements:&lt;ref&gt;Rosenczveig, Jean Pierre; ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011342/http://www.rosenczveig.com/Nanterre/Fac2%20-%202006-2007.pdf Droit pénal des mineurs, étude de]''&lt;/ref&gt;
# The specialization of the magistrate. Indeed, the juvenile criminal system has its own intervener: the children's judge, the court of assizes of minors, the court of appeal chamber of minors etc.
# Criminal relative responsibility begins at the age of 13.
# The priority is to educate, rather than punish. Article 2 of the order of February 2, 1945 imposes an educative-placing proposal to minors to whom a detention placing measure is considered.
# Parents have to be informed of their child's police custody. Moreover, Article 13 of the same order imposes an examination of the parents before the decision of the tribunal. Also, before the juvenile's police custody, the service for the legal protection of youth must be called.
# Requirement of an attorney for the juvenile. If he does not contact one, the jurisdiction has to do it for him.

In the US, the presence of an attorney is only recommended, not compulsory.

In most states, special courts try juveniles, but some like Colorado do not have them. Some crimes allow juvenile delinquents to be tried by the superior court (such as first-degree murderer or gang murder).

Juveniles also have special protections, in addition of juvenile courts, which are closed to the public in the US. In France, closing the court to the public (''huis clos'') is an option.  Just like in France, US parents or guardians have to be informed and to be present during the police questioning. At least, the names of juveniles are kept confidential when they are accused of a crime. Juvenile cases are heard by not a jury but a judge.

At least, the US criminal law system has a particular vocabulary for juveniles' cases. Indeed, juvenile offenders commit not a crime but a delinquent act. Also, courts use the term delinquent or not delinquent, instead of guilty or not guilty, just to show that a minor is different from a criminal.

Juveniles have the same rights as adults. They are assumed innocent, they are noticed of charges advance of any adjudication of delinquency, they have the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses, and they have the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

After their arrest, in both countries, minors may be placed in provisory detention (until a [[European Convention on Human Rights]] case banned it in France) if the parents are prejudiced and informed. Provisory detention is done in a juvenile hall, separated from adults.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usinfo.state.gov/journals/itdhr/0701/ijdf/frjacsdb.htm US Info] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713074258/http://usinfo.state.gov/journals/itdhr/0701/ijdf/frjacsdb.htm |date=2007-07-13 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

US parents may be liable for the acts of their child if they failed their parent’s authority, an example being if the minor is involved in a gang offense. Also, juveniles have no right to bail.

As can be noted, UD and French procedures are not that different as they have a common goal: to protect, as much as possible, the interest of the minor offender. Nevertheless, except for detention (the separation from adults as well as parents' awareness), the priorities are different. The US prefers the confidentiality of minors, but France stresses accommodating the juvenile within the criminal system.

Both systems protect but not in the same way. In France, an attorney is compulsory. In the US, there is no jury.

As notef, the goal of the juvenile justice in France and the US is clearly to educate child offenders, rather than punish them, even if some measures can be severe.

== Sanctions incurred by minors ==
The order of February 2, 1945 relative to the childhood delinquency contains three measures to punish French minor offenders:&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.senat.fr/lc/lc52/lc525.html Sénat]'' in French&lt;/ref&gt;
* Firstly, the educational measure can be an admonition, a particular educational placing, under legal protection (up to five years) or a supervised freedom.
* Secondly, the mediation-retrieval measure in which the minor is involved in the reparation of the damage he caused. The victim must approve. A minor between 16 and 18 may be submitted to a general interest working.
* Thirdly, the imprisonment measure that may not exceed half of the adult imprisonment term. However, oldest minors (over 16) may have the same penalty as adults if the offence is serious.

The punishment depends of minor's age. As aforesaid, if he is under 7 or 8, he can have no punishment. If he is between 8 and 13, the sentence is nothing more than an educational punishment. If he is over 13, he can have both an educational and a criminal punishment, but the tribunal has to explain its decision according to the minor's personality and the circumstances.

The US is less divided. The penalry is equal for each juvenile offender over 10, and there is no stage differentiation between measures. However, the measures&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoline.org/InformationLibrary/Documents/Juvenile%20Sanctions%20fj.asp Juvenile Sanctions, Info Online]&lt;/ref&gt; themsrlves are quite the same:
* Placing the delinquent in the care of an institution to take care of him
* Placing the delinquent in an alternative incarceration program
* Ordering the delinquent to participate in a treatment program
* Ordering the child to work in public buildings or private property
* Ordering the child to take part to the reparation of the damage he caused
* Committing the delinquent to the Department of Children and Families if his family is not adequate.

Since 1988, the death penalty for children who committed crimes has been outlawed. Also, in March 2005, the death penalty was outlawed for killers who committed their crimes before the age of 18. There were 72 peoples in [[death row]] concerned at the time.

As can be seen, the US and the French systems protect juvenile differently, but both protect effectively. There is also much stress on the prevention of delinquency in both countries.

CFEB was established by the [[Financial Services Authority]] as required by the ''Financial Services and Markets Act 2000'' (as amended by the ''Financial Services Act 2010''), and came into existence on April 26, 2010. The body has a mandate from [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], with all-party support, to develop consumer financial education in the UK and is responsible for enhancing the public’s understanding and knowledge of financial matters and their ability to manage their own financial affairs.

[[Tony Hobman]] was named CEO of the new organisation, taking over on May 17. [[Chris Pond]], Director of Financial Capability at the FSA was named a senior advisor to both CFEB and the FSA. 134 FSA staff in the FSA’s financial capability division were transferred to CFEB, located in offices at [[Canary Wharf]], London in its first year.

On April 4, 2011, CFEB was rebranded as the Money Advice Service.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4227">The '''Dead Media Project''' was initially proposed by science fiction writer [[Bruce Sterling]] in 1995 as a compilation of obsolete and forgotten communication technologies.&lt;ref name="proposal"&gt;[http://www.alamut.com/subj/artiface/deadMedia/dM_Manifesto.html Dead Media Project: A Modest Proposal and a Public Appeal]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sterling's original motivation for compiling the collection was to present a wider historical perspective on communication technologies that went beyond contemporary excitement for the [[internet]], [[CD-ROM]]s and [[virtual reality|VR]] systems.  Sterling proposed that this collection take form as "The Dead Media Handbook" — a somber, thoughtful, thorough, hype-free, book about the failures, collapses and hideous mistakes of media. In raising this challenge he offers a "crisp $50 dollar bill" to the first person to publish the book, which he envisions as a "rich, witty, insightful, profusely illustrated, perfectbound, acid-free-paper [[coffee-table book]]".

After articulated in the manifesto "The Dead Media Project — A Modest Proposal and a Public Appeal,"&lt;ref name="proposal" /&gt; The Dead Media Project began as a number of persons collecting their notes and the spreading of the archive through a mailing list, moderated by [[Tom Jennings]]. This resulted in a large collective of "field notes" about obsolete communication technologies, about 600 in total [https://web.archive.org/web/20071019055700/http://www.deadmedia.org/notes/index.html archived online]. The project lost momentum in 2001 and the mailing list died.

The project archive includes a wide variety of notes from [[Inca]]n [[quipu]]s, through Victorian [[phenakistoscope]]s, to the departed [[video game]]s and home computers of the 1980s. Dead still-image display technologies include the [[stereopticon]], the [[Protean View]], the [[Zogroscope]], the [[Polyorama Panoptique]], Frith's [[Cosmoscope]], Knight's [[Cosmorama]], Ponti's [[Megalethoscope]] (1862), Rousell's [[Graphoscope]] (1864), [[Charles Wheatstone|Wheatstone's]] [[stereoscope]] (1832), and dead [[Viewmaster]] knockoffs.

In 2009, artist [[Garnet Hertz]] published a bookwork project titled "A Collection of Many Problems (In Memory of the Dead Media Handbook)"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conceptlab.com/problems/ A Collection of Many Problems (In Memory of the Dead Media Handbook)]&lt;/ref&gt; which strived to fulfill some of [[Bruce Sterling]]'s vision for a handbook of obsolete media technologies.  In the book, Hertz presents images of many of the media technologies compiled through the Dead Media mailing list and invites readers to submit their sketches and ideas of a Dead Media Handbook.

The '''Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic''' ('''ASNC''' or, informally, '''ASNaC''') is one of the constituent departments of the [[University of Cambridge]], and focuses on the history, material culture, languages and literatures of the various peoples who inhabited [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Ireland]] and the extended [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian world]] in the early Middle Ages (5th century to 12th century). It is based on the second floor of the Faculty of English at [[West Road, Cambridge|9 West Road]]. In Cambridge University jargon, its students are called ''ASNaCs''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Shakespeare]], [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-27731725 'A Point of View: Taking England back to the Dark Ages'], ''BBC News Magazine'', 6 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

It remains the only university faculty or department in the world to focus entirely on the early Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Hugh Magennis, ''The Cambridge Introduction to Anglo-Saxon Literature'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The study of Anglo-Saxon England and its neighbouring regions has deep roots at Cambridge, beginning with the sixteenth-century Archbishop [[Matthew Parker]]. The first half of the seventeenth century saw [[Abraham Wheelocke]] hold a readership in Anglo-Saxon, and in 1657 [[John Spelman]] bestowed on [[William Somner]] the annual stipend of the Anglo-Saxon lecture founded by his father, [[Sir Henry Spelman]], at Cambridge, enabling him to complete the first Old English dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionarium Saxonico-Latino-Anglicum, voces, phrasesque praecipuas Anglo-Saxonicas. . . cum Latina et Anglica vocum interpretatione complectens. . . Aecesserunt Aelfrici Abbatis Grammatica Latino-Saxonica cum glossario suo ejusdem generis,' 2 pts, Oxford, 1659; 2nd edit, with additions by [[Thomas Benson (scholar)|Thomas Benson]], 1701.&lt;/ref&gt; After a lull in interest in Old English, in the nineteenth century, [[John Mitchell Kemble]] developed the study of Old English and Anglo-Saxon archaeology at Trinity College, and [[Joseph Bosworth]], another Anglo-Saxonist who was associated with Trinity, endowed the [[Elrington and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon|Elrington and Bosworth Chair]] in Anglo-Saxon, established in 1878, and first held by [[Walter William Skeat]]. Strengths at Cambridge in Old Norse were built up by [[Eiríkr Magnússon|Eiríkur Magnússon]] (1833–1913) and in Celtic studies by [[Edmund Crosby Quiggin]] (1875–1920).

The ASNaC Department as such has its origins in the work and ideas of Skeat's successor as Elrington and Bosworth Professor, [[Hector Munro Chadwick]], of Clare College. Chadwick took a leading role in integrating the philological study of Old English with archaeology and history and, by bringing the study of Old English from the Faculty of English to Archaeology and Anthropology in 1928, founded what was to become the Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic:&lt;ref&gt;''A History of the University of Cambridge'', ed. by [[Christopher N. L. Brooke|Christopher Brooke]], 4 vols (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988–2004), IV (Peter Searby, ''1890–1990''), 445. See further [[Allen Frantzen]], 'By the Numbers: Anglo-Saxon Scholarship at the Century's End', in ''A Companion to Anglo-Saxon Literature'', ed. by Phillip Pulsiano and Elaine Treharne (Oxford: Blackwell, 2001), DOI: 10.1111/b.9780631209041.2001.00030.x (pp. 478-80).&lt;/ref&gt; 'Chadwick's aim ... was to keep Old English studies free from philology (as it was then practised), but also from the dominance of English Literature'.&lt;ref&gt;John Walmesley, ' "A Term of Opprobrium": Twentieth Century Linguistics and English Philology', in ''History of Linguistics 2008'', ed. by Gerda Hassler, Studies in the History of the Language Sciences, 115 (Amsterdam: Benjamins, 2008), pp. 35-47 (at p. 39).&lt;/ref&gt; However, 'the alliance of Anglo-Saxon and archaeology suited the professor and not the students; and in the 1960s Professor [[Dorothy Whitelock]] led the Saxon flock back into the English fold'--specifically in 1967, though the Department of Archaeology and Anthropology continues to sustain strengths in Anglo-Saxon and early medieval archaeology, with relevant archaeology papers being available to ASNaCs.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of the University of Cambridge'', ed. by Christopher Brooke, 4 vols (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988–2004), IV (Peter Searby, ''1890–1990''), 445, 202; Jana K. Schulman, 'An Anglo-Saxonist at Oxford and Cambridge: Dorothy Whitelock (1901–1982)', in ''Women Medievalists and the Academy'', ed. by [[Jane Chance]] (Madison, Wis.: University of Wisconsin Press, 2005), pp. 553-62 (at pp. 559-60).&lt;/ref&gt; The Anglo-Saxon and Kindred Studies Tripos was introduced as a single-part (two-year) Tripos in 1957, the class list being published under the title 'Anglo-Saxon'; in 1971 this was relabelled 'Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic' under [[Peter Clemoes]].&lt;ref&gt;E. S. Leedham-Green, ''A Concise History of the University of Cambridge'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), pp. 226-27.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, under the leadership of [[Michael Lapidge]], ASNC became a two-part (three-year) Tripos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asnc.cam.ac.uk/about/history.htm Departmental History, Department of ASNC]&lt;/ref&gt; The Elrington and Bosworth Professor was customarily the head of the ASNaC Department, until a rotating headship system was introduced during the professorship of [[Simon Keynes]] in the early twenty-first century.

The name ASNC or ASNaC is pronounced /{{IPA|'æznæk}}/, and originally denoted members of the ASNC Society rather than of the Department. It was coined as a pun on an early poster for the ASNC Society Lunches: 'A Snack for ASNACs'.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Harvey, ''The Origin of ASNaC'', Chadwick Lecture Addendum 1, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  Students in the department were referred to in English as Asnackers, in French as Asnaciennes or Asnaques, and in German as Asnäckische.&lt;ref&gt;ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later the simpler term 'Asnacs' came into common use.

In 2015 the department was the subject of the scholarly article collection ''H M Chadwick and the Study of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic in Cambridge'', edited by [[Michael Lapidge]] (CMCS Publications).

== Major research projects ==

In the 2008 [[Research Assessment Exercise]] the department was rated as the top Celtic Studies department in the UK, and one of the top departments and faculties within the University of Cambridge, with 75% of its submitted research rated internationally excellent (3*) or world-leading (4*).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Because of its strongly interdisciplinary nature, elements of the Department's research were considered by the panels for History, English and Classics as well as Celtic Studies.

In collaboration with [[King's College London]], since 2005 the department has developed and organised the free-access [[Prosopography of Anglo-Saxon England]].&lt;ref&gt;Janet L. Nelson, 'From Building Site to Building: The ''Prosopography of Anglo-Saxon England'' (''PASE'') Project', in ''Collaborative Research in the Digital Humanities'', ed. by Marilyn Deegan, Willard McCarty (Farnham: Ashgate, 2012), pp. 123-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Languages taught ==

Language-study is central to ASNaC degree programmes, and the Department is a major training ground in these skills for researchers in early medieval history. The Department provides ''ab initio'' tuition in Old English, Old Norse, Old Irish, Middle Welsh, and Latin.

Despite the Department's medieval focus, its pre-eminence as a UK centre of Scandinavian and Celtic studies has led both the Irish and Icelandic governments to provide grants for the teaching of Modern Irish and Icelandic (respectively) to members of Cambridge University.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asnc.cam.ac.uk/currentstudents/icelandic/, http://www.asnc.cam.ac.uk/currentstudents/irish/.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Students==
=== Applications and admissions ===

Between 1900 and 1999, around 860 students studied in the Department or its precursor institutions. Between 1900 and 1946, 68% were women; thereafter there was a slight majority of men until 1980; and rough gender parity 1980-1999.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Lapidge, 'Introduction: The Study of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic in Cambridge, 1878-1999', in ''H. M. Chadwick and the Study of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic in Cambridge'', ed. by Michael Lapidge (Aberystwyth: Department of Welsh, Abersytwyth University, 2015), pp. 1-58 {{ISBN|9780955718298}} [=''Cambrian Medieval Celtic Studies'', 69/70], pp. 1-58 (p. 41).&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2009 to 2012, between 50 and 60 applicants applied for the ASNC BA per year; about 53% were offered places; and about 43% (20-25 students) accepted their offers.&lt;ref name="cam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.study.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/apply/statistics/.|title=Undergraduate Study|publisher=study.cam.ac.uk|accessdate=2014-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The undergraduate student body is majority female (⅔ for the 2011 admissions cycle) and has a strong preponderance of state-school leavers (84% of home students for the 2011 admissions cycle).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.study.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/apply/statistics/archive/admissionsstatistics2011.pdf, pp. 12, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===ASNaC Society===

The department has an affiliated student society, the ASNaC Society. It is recorded as hosting academic papers as early as 1971.&lt;ref&gt;M. C. W. Hunter, 'The Study of Anglo-Saxon Architecture Since 1770: An Evaluation', ''Proceedings of the Cambridge Antiquarian Society'', 66 (1975-76), 129-39 (p. 129).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Clement, '[https://www.oenewsletter.org/OEN/archive/OEN13_1.pdf University of Cambridge Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic Society', ''Old English Newsletter'', 13.1 (Fall 1979), 8.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Rollason, 'The Cults of Murdered Royal Saints in Anglo-Saxon England', ''Anglo-Saxon England'', 11 (1982), 1-22 (p. 1 fn 1), {{DOI|10.1017/S0263675100002544}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Michael Lapidge]], &lt;blockquote&gt;From the mid-1980s onward, the combined number of undergraduate nd graduate students reached (which might be described as) a critical mass, with the result that there was a very palpable surge in corporate spirit and concomitant pride in being an 'ASNaC', a member of a small but elite group of students distinguished throughout the University for its academic attainments.&lt;/blockquote&gt; The Society organises a weekly 'ASNaC Lunch', field trips, punting expeditions, dinners, and ASNaC mugs and sweatshirts.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Lapidge, 'Introduction: The Study of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic in Cambridge, 1878-1999', in ''H. M. Chadwick and the Study of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic in Cambridge'', ed. by Michael Lapidge (Aberystwyth: Department of Welsh, Abersytwyth University, 2015), pp. 1-58 {{ISBN|9780955718298}} [=''Cambrian Medieval Celtic Studies'', 69/70], pp. 1-58 (pp. 44-45, quoting p. 44).&lt;/ref&gt; The Society is also noted for producing the (mostly) twice yearly ''Gesta Asnacorum'', founded by [[Tom Shakespeare]], which satirises the life of the Department and the medieval texts and modern scholarship it studies.&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Asnacorum. 'Gesta Asnacorum', 1985–1995: The First Ten Years'', ed. by Richard Fairhurst (Cambridge: The Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic, 1997), p. 7; http://www.srcf.ucam.org/asnac/data/gesta.php.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the ''Gesta Asnacorum'' is merely a scurrilous student rag, it does feature the [[juvenilia]] of many alumni of the department who have gone on to become prominent historians.

=== Alumni ===

ASNaCs have gone into many walks of life, but a significant proportion of academics in the fields of early medieval European literature and history, particularly in Celtic studies, have studied or taught at the department, making it a historically highly influential institution in its field.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6316">'''Extinction threshold''' is a term used in [[conservation biology]] to explain the point at which a [[species]], [[population]] or [[metapopulation]], experiences an abrupt change in density or number because of an important parameter, such as habitat loss. It is at this critical value below which a species, population, or metapopulation, will go [[extinct]],&lt;ref name="ETMM"&gt;Ovaskainen, O. and Hanski, I. 2003:Extinction Threshold in Metapopulation Models, Ann.Zool.Fennic.40:81-97.&lt;/ref&gt; though this may take a long time for species just below the critical value, a phenomenon known as [[extinction debt]].&lt;ref name=Tilman1994&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tilman | first1 = D. | last2 = May | first2 = R. M. | last3 = Lehman | first3 = C. L. | last4 = Nowak | first4 = M. A. | title = Habitat destruction and the extinction debt | doi = 10.1038/371065a0 | journal = Nature | volume = 371 | pages = 65 | year = 1994 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1994Natur.371...65T | issue=6492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extinction thresholds are important to conservation biologists when studying a species in a population or metapopulation context because the colonization rate must be larger than the extinction rate, otherwise the entire entity will go extinct once it reaches the threshold.&lt;ref name="PCB"&gt;Groom, M., Meffe, G. K., and Carroll, C.R. 2000:Principles of Conservation Biology, 3rd Ed, Sinauer Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

Extinction thresholds are realized under a number of circumstances and the point in modeling them is to define the conditions that lead a population to extinction.&lt;ref name="ETPFL"&gt;With, K.A. and King, A.W. 1999:Extinction Thresholds For Species in Fractal Landscapes, Conservation Biology: Vol 13, No.2,pp.314-326.&lt;/ref&gt; Modeling extinction thresholds can explain the relationship between extinction threshold and [[habitat loss]] and [[habitat fragmentation]].&lt;ref name="EHFET"&gt;Fahrig, Lenore. 2002:Effect of Habitat Fragmentation on the Extinction Threshold: A Synthesis, Ecological Applications: Vol.12, No.2, pp.346-353.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical models ==

Metapopulation-type models are used to predict extinction thresholds. The classic metapopulation model is the [[Levins Model]], which  is the model of metapopulation dynamics established by [[Richard Levins]] in the 1960s. It was used to evaluate patch occupancy in a large network of patches. This model was extended in the 1980s by [[Russell Lande]] to include habitat occupancy.&lt;ref name="ETMM"/&gt; This mathematical model is used to infer the extinction values and important population densities. These mathematical models are primarily used to study extinction thresholds because of the difficulty in understanding extinction processes through empirical methods and the current lack of research on this subject.&lt;ref name="ETHPD"&gt;Deredec, A. and Courchamp,F, 2003:Extinction Thresholds in Host-Parasite Dynamics, Ann. Zool. Fennic. 40:115-130.&lt;/ref&gt; When determining an extinction threshold there are two types of models that can be used: deterministic and stochastic metapopulation models.

=== Deterministic ===

Deterministic metapopulation models assume that there are an infinite number of habitat patches available and predict that the metapopulation will go extinct only if the threshold is not met.&lt;ref name="ETMM"/&gt;

'''''dp/dt = chp (1-p)-ep'''''

Where p= occupied patches, e= extinction rate, c= colonization rate, and h= amount of habitat.

A species will persist only if '''''h&gt; δ''''' 

where '''''δ=e/c''''' 

δ= species parameter, or how successful a species is in colonizing a patch.&lt;ref name="ETMM"/&gt;

=== Stochastic ===

Stochastic metapopulation models take into account stochasticity, which is the non-deterministic or random processes in nature. With this approach a metapopulation may be above the threshold if determined that it is unlikely it will go extinct within a certain time period.&lt;ref name="ETMM"/&gt; 

The complex nature of these models can result in a small metapopulation that is considered to be above the deterministic extinction threshold, but  in reality has a high risk of extinction .&lt;ref name="ETMM"/&gt;

== Other factors ==

When using metapopulation-type models to predict extinction thresholds there are a number of factors that can affect the results of a model. First, including more complicated models, rather than relying solely on the Levins model produces different dynamics. For example, in an article published in 2004, [[Otso Ovaskainen]] and [[Ilkka Hanski]] explained with an empirical example that when factors such as [[Allee effect]] or Rescue effect were included in modeling the extinction threshold, there were unexpected extinctions in a high number of species. A more complex model came up with different results, and in practicing conservation biology this can add more confusion to efforts to save a species from the extinction threshold. Transient dynamics, which are effects on the extinction threshold because of instability in either the metapopulation or environmental conditions, is also a large player in modeling results. Landscapes that have recently endured habitat loss and fragmentation may be less able to sustain a metapopulation than previously understood without considering transient dynamics.  Finally, environmental stochasticity, which may be spatially correlated, can lead to amplified regional stochastic fluctuations and therefore greatly affect the extinction risk.&lt;ref name="ETMM"/&gt;

'''Eye tracking''' is the process of measuring either the point of [[gaze (physiology)|gaze]] (where one is looking) or the motion of an eye relative to the head.  An '''eye tracker''' is a device for measuring eye positions and [[Eye movement (sensory)|eye movement]].  Eye trackers are used in research on the [[visual system]], in psychology, in [[psycholinguistics]], marketing, as an input device for [[human-computer interaction]], and in product design.  There are a number of methods for measuring eye movement.  The most popular variant uses video images from which the eye position is extracted.  Other methods use [[search coil]]s or are based on the [[electrooculography|electrooculogram]].

[[File:Yarbus eye tracker.jpg|thumb|Yarbus eye tracker from the 1960s.]]

== History ==
In the 1800s, studies of eye movement were made using direct observations.

In 1879 in Paris, [[Louis Émile Javal]] observed that reading does not involve a smooth sweeping of the eyes along the text, as previously assumed, but a series of short stops (called fixations) and quick [[saccade]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Reported in Huey 1908/1968.&lt;/ref&gt;  This observation raised important questions about reading, questions which were explored during the 1900s: On which words do the eyes stop? For how long? When do they regress to already seen words?

[[File:Reading Fixations Saccades.jpg|thumb|left|320px|An example of fixations and saccades over text. This is the typical pattern of eye movement during reading. The eyes never move smoothly over still text.]]
Edmund Huey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huey|first=Edmund|title=The Psychology and Pedagogy of Reading (Reprint)|publisher=MIT Press 1968 (originally published 1908)}}&lt;/ref&gt; built an early eye tracker, using a sort of contact lens with a hole for the [[pupil]]. The lens was connected to an aluminum pointer that moved in response to the movement of the eye. Huey studied and quantified regressions (only a small proportion of saccades are regressions), and he showed that some words in a sentence are not fixated.

The first non-intrusive eye-trackers were built by Guy Thomas Buswell in Chicago, using beams of light that were reflected on the eye and then recording them on film. Buswell made systematic studies into reading&lt;ref&gt;Buswell (1922, 1937)&lt;/ref&gt; and picture viewing.&lt;ref&gt;(1935)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, [[Alfred L. Yarbus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yarbus|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; did important eye tracking research and his 1967 book is often quoted. He showed that the task given to a subject has a very large influence on the subject's eye movement. He also wrote about the relation between fixations and interest:

:"All the records ... show conclusively that the character of the eye movement is either completely independent of or only very slightly dependent on the material of the picture and how it was made, provided that it is flat or nearly flat."&lt;ref name="Yarbus 1967 190"&gt;{{Harvnb|Yarbus|1967|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cyclical pattern in the examination of pictures "is dependent on not only what is shown on the picture, but also the problem facing the observer and the information that he hopes to gain from the picture."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yarbus|1967|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Yarbus The Visitor.jpg|thumb|right|320px|This study by {{Harvtxt|Yarbus|1967}} is often referred to as evidence on how the task given to a person influences his or her eye movement.]]
:"Records of eye movements show that the observer's attention is usually held only by certain elements of the picture.... Eye movement reflects the human thought processes; so the observer's thought may be followed to some extent from records of eye movement (the thought accompanying the examination of the particular object). It is easy to determine from these records which elements attract the observer's eye (and, consequently, his thought), in what order, and how often."&lt;ref name="Yarbus 1967 190"/&gt;

:"The observer's attention is frequently drawn to elements which do not give important information but which, in his opinion, may do so. Often an observer will focus his attention on elements that are unusual in the particular circumstances, unfamiliar, incomprehensible, and so on."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yarbus|1967|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"... when changing its points of fixation, the observer's eye repeatedly returns to the same elements of the picture. Additional time spent on perception is not used to examine the secondary elements, but to reexamine the most important elements."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yarbus|1967|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Eye tracking thru glass.JPG|thumb|320px|This study by Hunziker (1970)&lt;ref&gt;Hunziker, H. W. (1970). Visuelle Informationsaufnahme und Intelligenz: Eine Untersuchung über die Augenfixationen beim Problemlösen. Schweizerische Zeitschrift für Psychologie und ihre Anwendungen, 1970, 29, Nr 1/2 (english abstract: http://www.learning-systems.ch/multimedia/forsch1e.htm )&lt;/ref&gt; on ''eye tracking in problem solving'' used simple 8&amp;nbsp;mm film to track eye movement by filming the subject through a glass plate on which the visual problem was displayed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.learning-systems.ch/multimedia/eye movements problem solving.swf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learning-systems.ch/multimedia/forsch1e.htm|title=Visual Perception: Eye Movements in Problem Solving.|website=www.learning-systems.ch|accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the 1970s, eye-tracking research expanded rapidly, particularly reading research. A good overview of the research in this period is given by [[Dr. Keith Rayner|Rayner]].&lt;ref&gt;Rayner (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Just and Carpenter&lt;ref&gt;Just and Carpenter (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; formulated the influential ''Strong eye-mind hypothesis'', that "there is no appreciable lag between what is fixated and what is processed". If this hypothesis is correct, then when a subject looks at a word or object, he or she also thinks about it (process cognitively), and for exactly as long as the recorded fixation. The hypothesis is often taken for granted by researchers using eye-tracking. However, [[Gaze-contingency paradigm|gaze-contingent techniques]] offer an interesting option in order to disentangle overt and covert attentions, to differentiate what is fixated and what is processed.

During the 1980s, the eye-mind hypothesis was often questioned in light of covert attention,&lt;ref&gt;Posner (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright &amp; Ward (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; the attention to something that one is not looking at, which people often do. If covert attention is common during eye-tracking recordings, the resulting scan-path and fixation patterns would often show not where our attention has been, but only where the eye has been looking, failing to indicate cognitive processing.

The 1980s also saw the birth of using eye-tracking to answer questions related to human-computer interaction.  Specifically, researchers investigated how users search for commands in computer menus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.100.445&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=Download Limit Exceeded|website=citeseerx.ist.psu.edu|accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, computers allowed researchers to use eye-tracking results in real time, primarily to help disabled users.&lt;ref name="Download Limit Exceeded"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.100.445&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf%5D,|title=Download Limit Exceeded|website=citeseerx.ist.psu.edu|accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, there has been growth in using eye tracking to study how users interact with different computer interfaces. Specific questions researchers ask are related to how easy different interfaces are for users.&lt;ref name="Download Limit Exceeded"/&gt;  The results of the eye tracking research can lead to changes in design of the interface. Yet another recent area of research focuses on Web development. This can include how users react to drop-down menus or where they focus their attention on a website so the developer knows where to place an advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmi-interaktiv.de/uploads/media/MMI-Interaktiv0303_SchiesslDudaThoelkeFischer.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hoffman,&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman 1998&lt;/ref&gt; current consensus is that visual attention is always slightly (100 to 250 ms) ahead of the eye. But as soon as attention moves to a new position, the eyes will want to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T0W-3VXNHBP-10&amp;_user=952938&amp;_coverDate=06%2F30%2F1996&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000049220&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=952938&amp;md5=4f7fbf4f015fde59aa9a39b30154e7f3 | doi=10.1016/0042-6989(95)00294-4 | volume=36 | title=Saccade target selection and object recognition: Evidence for a common attentional mechanism | year=1996 | journal=Vision Research | pages=1827–1837 | last1 = Deubel | first1 = Heiner | pmid=8759451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We still cannot infer specific cognitive processes directly from a fixation on a particular object in a scene.&lt;ref&gt;Holsanova 2007&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a fixation on a face in a picture may indicate recognition, liking, dislike, puzzlement etc. Therefore, eye tracking is often coupled with other methodologies, such as [[Protocol analysis|introspective verbal protocols]].

== Tracker types ==
Eye-trackers measure rotations of the eye in one of several ways, but principally they fall into three categories: (i) measurement of the movement of an object (normally, a special contact lens) attached to the eye; (ii) optical tracking without direct contact to the eye; and (iii) measurement of electric potentials using electrodes placed around the eyes.

=== Eye-attached tracking ===
The first type uses an attachment to the eye, such as a special contact lens with an embedded mirror or magnetic field sensor, and the movement of the attachment is measured with the assumption that it does not slip significantly as the eye rotates. Measurements with tight-fitting contact lenses have provided extremely sensitive recordings of eye movement, and magnetic search coils are the method of choice for researchers studying the dynamics and underlying physiology of eye movement. This method allows the measurement of eye movement in horizontal, vertical and torsion directions.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Robinson: A method of measuring eye movement using a scleral search coil in a magnetic field, IEEE Transactions on Bio-Medical Electronics, October 1963, 137–145 ([http://ebooks.yasse.ir/ebooks/IEEE_Journals/Bio-Medical_Electronics_IRE_T/A_Method_of_Measuring_Eye_Movemnent_Using_a_Scieral_Search_Coil_in_a_Magnetic_Field-274.pdf PDF])&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Optical tracking ===
[[File:EYE-SYNC eye-tracking analyzer.JPG|thumb|An eye-tracking [[head-mounted display]]. Each eye has an LED light source (gold-color metal) on the side of the display lens, and a camera under the display lens.]]
The second broad category uses some non-contact, optical method for measuring eye motion. Light, typically infrared, is reflected from the eye and sensed by a video camera or some other specially designed optical sensor. The information is then analyzed to extract eye rotation from changes in reflections. Video-based eye trackers typically use the corneal reflection (the first [[Purkinje images|Purkinje image]]) and the center of the pupil as features to track over time. A more sensitive type of eye-tracker, the dual-Purkinje eye tracker,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1364/AO.24.000527|last=Crane|first=H.D.|author2=Steele, C.M.|title=Generation-V dual-Purkinje-image eyetracker|journal=Applied Optics|volume=24|issue=4|pages=527–537|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses reflections from the front of the cornea (first Purkinje image) and the back of the lens (fourth Purkinje image) as features to track. A still more sensitive method of tracking is to image features from inside the eye, such as the retinal blood vessels, and follow these features as the eye rotates. Optical methods, particularly those based on video recording, are widely used for gaze-tracking and are favored for being non-invasive and inexpensive.

=== Electric potential measurement ===
The third category uses electric potentials measured with electrodes placed around the eyes. The eyes are the origin of a steady electric potential field which can also be detected in total darkness and if the eyes are closed. It can be modelled to be generated by a dipole with its positive pole at the cornea and its negative pole at the retina. The electric signal that can be derived using two pairs of contact electrodes placed on the skin around one eye is called [[EOG|Electrooculogram (EOG)]]. If the eyes move from the centre position towards the periphery, the retina approaches one electrode while the cornea approaches the opposing one. This change in the orientation of the dipole and consequently the electric potential field results in a change in the measured EOG signal. Inversely, by analysing these changes in eye movement can be tracked. Due to the discretisation given by the common electrode setup, two separate movement components – a horizontal and a vertical – can be identified. A third EOG component is the radial EOG channel,&lt;ref&gt;Elbert, T., Lutzenberger, W., Rockstroh, B., Birbaumer, N., 1985. Removal of ocular artifacts from the EEG. A biophysical approach to the EOG. Electroencephalogr Clin Neurophysiol 60, 455-463.&lt;/ref&gt; which is the average of the EOG channels referenced to some posterior scalp electrode. This radial EOG channel is sensitive to the saccadic spike potentials stemming from the extra-ocular muscles at the onset of saccades, and allows reliable detection of even miniature saccades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keren | first1 = A.S. | last2 = Yuval-Greenberg | first2 = S. | last3 = Deouell | first3 = L.Y. | year = 2010 | title = Saccadic spike potentials in gamma-band EEG: Characterization, detection and suppression | url = | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 2248–2263 | doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.10.057 | pmid=19874901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to potential drifts and variable relations between the EOG signal amplitudes and the saccade sizes, it is challenging to use EOG for measuring slow eye movement and detecting gaze direction. EOG is, however, a very robust technique for measuring [[saccade|saccadic eye movement]] associated with gaze shifts and detecting [[blink]]s. 
Contrary to video-based eye-trackers, EOG allows recording of eye movements even with eyes closed, and can thus be used in sleep research. It is a very light-weight approach that, in contrast to current video-based eye-trackers, requires only very low computational power; works under different lighting conditions; and can be implemented as an embedded, self-contained wearable system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bulling|first=A. |author2=Roggen, D. |author3=Tröster, G.|year=2009|title=Wearable EOG goggles: Seamless sensing and context-awareness in everyday environments|journal=Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Smart Environments (JAISE)|volume=1|pages=157–171|issue=2|doi=10.3233/AIS-2009-0020}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus the method of choice for measuring eye movement in mobile daily-life situations and [[rapid eye movement sleep|REM]] phases during sleep.  The major disadvantage of EOG is its relatively poor gaze-direction accuracy compared to a video tracker.  That is, it is difficult to determine with good accuracy exactly where a subject is looking, though the time of eye movements can be determined.

==Technologies and techniques==

The most widely used current designs are video-based eye-trackers. A camera focuses on one or both eyes and records eye movement as the viewer looks at some kind of stimulus. Most modern eye-trackers use the center of the pupil and [[infrared]] / [[near-infrared]] non-collimated light to create [[corneal reflection]]s (CR). The vector between the pupil center and the corneal reflections can be used to compute the point of regard on surface or the gaze direction. A simple calibration procedure of the individual is usually needed before using the eye tracker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Witzner Hansen|first=Dan|author2=Qiang Ji|title=In the Eye of the Beholder: A Survey of Models for Eyes and Gaze|journal=IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell.|date=March 2010|volume=32|issue=3|pages=478–500|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1729561|doi=10.1109/tpami.2009.30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two general types of infrared / near-infrared (also known as active light) eye-tracking techniques are used: bright-pupil and dark-pupil. Their difference is based on the location of the illumination source with respect to the optics. If the illumination is [[coaxial]] with the optical path, then the eye acts as a [[retroreflector]] as the light reflects off the [[retina]] creating a bright pupil effect similar to [[Red-eye effect|red eye]]. If the illumination source is offset from the optical path, then the pupil appears dark because the retroreflection from the retina is directed away from the camera.&lt;ref name=gneo&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gneo|first1=Massimo|last2=Schmid|first2=Maurizio|last3=Conforto|first3=Silvia|last4=D’Alessio|first4=Tommaso|title=A free geometry model-independent neural eye-gaze tracking system|journal=Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation|date=2012|volume=9|issue=1|pages=82|doi=10.1186/1743-0003-9-82}}&lt;!--|accessdate=9 March 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Bright-pupil tracking creates greater iris/pupil contrast, allowing more robust eye-tracking with all iris pigmentation, and greatly reduces interference caused by eyelashes and other obscuring features.&lt;ref&gt;The Eye: A Survey of Human Vision; Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; It also allows tracking in lighting conditions ranging from total darkness to very bright.

Another, less used, method is known as passive light. It uses visible light to illuminate, something which may cause some distractions to users.&lt;ref name=gneo/&gt; Another challenge with this method is that the contrast of the pupil is less than in the active light methods, therefore, the center of [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] is used for calculating the vector instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sigut|first1=J|last2=Sidha|first2=SA|title=Iris center corneal reflection method for gaze tracking using visible light.|journal=IEEE Transactions on Bio-medical Engineering|date=February 2011|volume=58|issue=2|pages=411–9|pmid=20952326|doi=10.1109/tbme.2010.2087330}}&lt;!--|accessdate=9 March 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This calculation needs to detect the boundary of the iris and the white [[sclera]] ([[Corneal limbus|limbus]] tracking). It presents another challenge for vertical eye movements due to obstruction of eyelids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hua|first1=H|last2=Krishnaswamy|first2=P|last3=Rolland|first3=JP|title=Video-based eyetracking methods and algorithms in head-mounted displays.|journal=Optics Express|date=15 May 2006|volume=14|issue=10|pages=4328–50|pmid=19516585|doi=10.1364/oe.14.004328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eye-tracking setups vary greatly: some are head-mounted, some require the head to be stable (for example, with a chin rest), and some function remotely and automatically track the head during motion.  Most use a sampling rate of at least 30&amp;nbsp;Hz. Although 50/60&amp;nbsp;Hz is more common, today many video-based eye trackers run at 240, 350 or even 1000/1250&amp;nbsp;Hz, speeds needed in order to capture fixational eye movements or correctly measure saccade dynamics.

Eye movements are typically divided into [[fixation (visual)|fixations]] and saccades – when the eye gaze pauses in a certain position, and when it moves to another position, respectively. The resulting series of fixations and saccades is called a [[scanpath]]. Smooth pursuit describes the eye following a moving object. Fixational eye movements include [[microsaccade]]s: small, involuntary saccades that occur during attempted fixation. Most information from the eye is made available during a fixation or smooth pursuit, but not during a saccade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Purves |first=D |author2=st al. |date=2001 |title=Neuroscience, 2d ed. |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11156/ |location=Sunderland (MA)|publisher=Sinauer Assocs. |page=What Eye Movements Accomplish|isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scanpaths are useful for analyzing cognitive intent, interest, and salience.  Other biological factors (some as simple as gender) may affect the scanpath as well. Eye tracking in [[human–computer interaction]] (HCI) typically investigates the scanpath for usability purposes, or as a method of input in [[gaze-contingency paradigm|gaze-contingent displays]], also known as [[gaze-based interfaces]].&lt;ref&gt;Majaranta, P., Aoki, H., Donegan, M., Hansen, D.W., Hansen, J.P., Hyrskykari, A., Räihä, K.J., ''Gaze Interaction and Applications of Eye Tracking: Advances in Assistive Technologies'', IGI Global, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data presentation ==

Interpretation of the data that is recorded by the various types of eye-trackers employs a variety of software that animates or visually represents it, so that the visual behavior of one or more users can be graphically resumed. The video is generally manually coded to identify the AOIs(Area Of Interests) or recently using artificial intelligence. Graphical presentation is rarely the basis of research results, since they are limited in terms of what can be analysed - research relying on eye-tracking, for example, usually requires quantitative measures of the eye movement events and their parameters, The following visualisations are the most commonly used:

'''Animated representations of a point on the interface'''
This method is used when the visual behavior is examined individually indicating where the user focused their gaze in each moment, complemented with a small path that indicates the previous saccade movements, as seen in the image.

'''Static representations of the saccade path'''
This is fairly similar to the one described above, with the difference that this is static method. A higher level of expertise than with the animated ones is required to interpret this.

'''Heat maps'''
An alternative static representation, used mainly for the agglomerated analysis of the visual exploration patterns in a group of users. In these representations, the ‘hot’ zones or zones with higher density designate where the users focused their gaze (not their attention) with a higher frequency. Heat maps are the best known visualization technique for eyetracking studies.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, Jakob. Pernice, Kara. (2010).

'''Blind zones maps, or focus maps'''
This method is a simplified version of the Heat maps where the visually less attended zones by the users are displayed clearly, thus allowing for an easier understanding of the most relevant information, that is to say, we are informed about which zones were not seen by the users.

== Eye-tracking vs. gaze-tracking ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Gaze Tracking Example.jpg|thumb|left|An example of eye gaze trace overlay.]] --&gt;Eye-trackers necessarily measure the rotation of the eye with respect to some frame of reference. This is usually tied to the measuring system. Thus, if the measuring system is head-mounted, as with EOG or a video-based system mounted to a helmet, then eye-in-head angles are measured. To deduce the line of sight in world coordinates, the head must be kept in a constant position or its movements must be tracked as well. In these cases, head direction is added to eye-in-head direction to determine gaze direction.

If the measuring system is table-mounted, as with scleral search coils or table-mounted camera (“remote”) systems, then gaze angles are measured directly in world coordinates. Typically, in these situations head movements are prohibited. For example, the head position is fixed using a bite bar or a forehead support. Then a head-centered reference frame is identical to a world-centered reference frame. Or colloquially, the eye-in-head position directly determines the gaze direction.

Some results are available on human eye movements under natural conditions where head movements are allowed as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Einhäuser | first1 = W | last2 = Moeller | first2 = GU | last3 = Schumann | first3 = F | last4 = Conradt | first4 = J | last5 = Vockeroth | first5 = J | last6 = Bartl | first6 = K | last7 = Schneider | first7 = E | last8 = König | first8 = P | year = 2009 | title = Eye-head coordination during free exploration in human and cat | url = | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1164 | issue = | pages = 353–366 | doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2008.03709.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Einhäuser W, Schumann F, Bardins S, Bartl K, Böning G, Schneider E and König P (2007).

== Eye tracking in practice ==
A great deal of research has gone into studies of the mechanisms and dynamics of eye rotation, but the goal of eye- tracking is most often to estimate gaze direction. Users may be interested in what features of an image draw the eye, for example. It is important to realize that the eye-tracker does not provide absolute gaze direction, but rather can measure only changes in gaze direction. In order to know precisely what a subject is looking at, some calibration procedure is required in which the subject looks at a point or series of points, while the eye tracker records the value that corresponds to each gaze position. (Even those techniques that track features of the retina cannot provide exact gaze direction because there is no specific anatomical feature that marks the exact point where the visual axis meets the retina, if indeed there is such a single, stable point.) An accurate and reliable calibration is essential for obtaining valid and repeatable eye movement data, and this can be a significant challenge for non-verbal subjects or those who have unstable gaze.

Each method of eye-tracking has advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of an eye-tracking system depends on considerations of cost and application. There are offline methods and online procedures like [[AttentionTracking]]. There is a trade-off between cost and sensitivity, with the most sensitive systems costing many tens of thousands of dollars and requiring considerable expertise to operate properly. Advances in computer and video technology have led to the development of relatively low-cost systems that are useful for many applications and fairly easy to use. Interpretation of the results still requires some level of expertise, however, because a misaligned or poorly calibrated system can produce wildly erroneous data.

===Eye-tracking while driving a car in a difficult situation===

[[Image:Eye movements of drivers.jpg|300px | frame| right |Frames from narrow road eye tracking described in this section&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Werner Hunziker, (2006) Im Auge des Lesers: foveale und periphere Wahrnehmung - vom Buchstabieren zur Lesefreude [In the eye of the reader: foveal and peripheral perception - from letter recognition to the joy of reading] Transmedia Stäubli Verlag Zürich 2006 {{ISBN|978-3-7266-0068-6}} Based on data from:Cohen, A. S. (1983). Informationsaufnahme beim Befahren von Kurven, Psychologie für die Praxis 2/83, Bulletin der Schweizerischen Stiftung für Angewandte Psychologie&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The eye movement of two groups of drivers have been filmed with a special head camera by a team of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology: Novice and experienced drivers had their eye-movement recorded while approaching a bend of a narrow road.
The series of images has been condensed from the original film frames&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, A. S. (1983). Informationsaufnahme beim Befahren von Kurven, Psychologie für die Praxis 2/83, Bulletin der Schweizerischen Stiftung für Angewandte Psychologie&lt;/ref&gt; to show 2 eye fixations per image for better comprehension.

Each of these stills corresponds to approximately 0.5 seconds in realtime.

The series of images shows an example of eye fixations #9 to #14 of a typical novice and an experienced driver.

Comparison of the top images shows that the experienced driver checks the curve and even has Fixation No. 9 left to look aside while the novice driver needs to check the road and estimate his distance to the parked car.

In the middle images, the experienced driver is now fully concentrating on the location where an oncoming car could be seen. The novice driver concentrates his view on the parked car.

In the bottom image the novice is busy estimating the distance between the left wall and the parked car, while the experienced driver can use his [[peripheral vision]] for that and still concentrate his view on the dangerous point of the curve: If a car appears there, he has to give way, i. e. stop to the right instead of passing the parked car.&lt;ref&gt;Pictures from: Hans-Werner Hunziker, (2006) Im Auge des Lesers: foveale und periphere Wahrnehmung – vom Buchstabieren zur Lesefreude  [In the eye of the reader: foveal and peripheral perception – from letter recognition to the joy of reading] Transmedia Stäubli Verlag Zürich 2006 {{ISBN|978-3-7266-0068-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eye-tracking of younger and elderly people while walking===

While walking, elderly subjects depend more on foveal vision than do younger subjects. Their walking speed is decreased by a limited [[visual field]], probably caused by a deteriorated peripheral vision.

Younger subjects make use of both their central and peripheral vision while walking. Their peripheral vision allows faster control over the process of walking.&lt;ref&gt;Itoh N, Fukuda T. (2002) [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2466/pms.2002.94.3c.1283 Comparative study of eye movement in extent of central and peripheral vision and use by young and elderly walkers]. ''Percept Mot Skills.'' 2002 Jun;94(3 Pt 2):1283–91&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
A wide variety of disciplines use eye-tracking techniques, including [[cognitive science]]; [[psychology]] (notably [[psycholinguistics]]; the visual world paradigm); [[human-computer interaction]] (HCI); [[human factors and ergonomics]]; [[marketing research]] and medical research (neurological diagnosis). Specific applications include the tracking eye movement in [[eye movement in language reading|language reading]], [[eye movement in music reading|music reading]], human [[activity recognition]], the perception of advertising, and the playing of sports.

===Commercial applications===
In recent years, the increased sophistication and accessibility of eye-tracking technologies have generated a great deal of interest in the commercial sector. Applications include [[web usability]], advertising, sponsorship, package design and automotive engineering. In general, commercial eye-tracking studies function by presenting a target stimulus to a sample of consumers while an eye tracker is used to record the activity of the eye. Examples of target stimuli may include websites; television programs; sporting events; films and commercials; magazines and newspapers; packages; shelf displays; consumer systems (ATMs, checkout systems, kiosks); and software. The resulting data can be statistically analyzed and graphically rendered to provide evidence of specific visual patterns. By examining fixations, [[saccades]], pupil dilation, blinks and a variety of other behaviors, researchers can determine a great deal about the effectiveness of a given medium or product. While some companies complete this type of research internally, there are many private companies that offer eye-tracking services and analysis.

One of the most prominent fields of commercial eye-tracking research is web usability.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} While traditional usability techniques are often quite powerful in providing information on clicking and scrolling patterns, eye-tracking offers the ability to analyze user interaction between the clicks and how much time a user spends between clicks, thereby providing valuable insight into which features are the most eye-catching, which features cause confusion and which are ignored altogether. Specifically, eye-tracking can be used to assess search efficiency, branding, online advertisements, navigation usability, overall design and many other site components. Analyses may target a prototype or competitor site in addition to the main client site.

Eye-tracking is commonly used in a variety of different advertising media. Commercials, print ads, online ads and sponsored programs are all conducive to analysis with current eye-tracking technology. For instance in newspapers, eye-tracking studies can be used to find out in what way advertisements should be mixed with the news in order to catch the reader’s eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.looktracker.com/blog/eye-tracking-case-study/eye-tracking-study-the-new-york-times-vs-the-wall-street-journal|title=LookTracker - Eye Tracking Services|website=www.looktracker.com|accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analyses focus on visibility of a target product or logo in the context of a magazine, newspaper, website, or televised event. One example is an analysis of eye movements over advertisements in the [[Yellow pages|Yellow Pages]]. The study focused on what particular features caused people to notice an ad, whether they viewed ads in a particular order and how viewing times varied. The study revealed that ad size, graphics, color, and copy all influence attention to advertisements. Knowing this allows researchers to assess in great detail how often a sample of consumers fixates on the target logo, product or ad. As a result, an advertiser can quantify the success of a given campaign in terms of actual visual attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lohse |first=Gerald |last2=Wu |first2=D.

'''Fitchburg State University''' ('''Fitchburg State''') is a public university in [[Fitchburg, Massachusetts]]. It has over 3,500 undergraduate and over 1650 graduate/continuing education students, for a total student body enrollment over 5200. The university offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in 25 academic disciplines. The main campus, the McKay Campus School, and athletic fields occupy {{convert|79|acre|m2}} in the city of Fitchburg; the biological study fields occupy {{convert|120|acre|m2}} in the neighboring towns of [[Lancaster, Massachusetts|Lancaster]], [[Leominster, Massachusetts|Leominster]], and [[Lunenburg, Massachusetts|Lunenburg]].

==History==
[[Image:State Normal School, Fitchburg, MA.jpg|thumb|The State Normal School in Fitchburg]]Fitchburg State University was founded as the '''State Normal School in Fitchburg''' in 1894 by the [[Massachusetts General Court|state legislature]]. Its first President was John G. Thompson (President 1895–1920). Initially a secondary-education school for women (coeducation arrived in 1911), the Normal School was not authorized to grant bachelor's degrees until 1930, after the presidency of William D. Parkinson (1920–1927), and during Dr. Charles M. Herlihy's (1927–1945) tenure. In 1932, that authorization was extended to all academic disciplines in Education. At the same time, the name was changed to '''State Teachers College at Fitchburg'''. Dr. Charles M. Herlihy died while in office and was succeeded by Dr. William J. Sanders (1945–1950) and Ellis F. White (1950–1953).

During Ralph H. Weston's (1953–1963) presidency of the college, the Education program was the primary focus. That changed in 1960, when the school changed its name to '''State College at Fitchburg''' and added degree programs outside of Education. In 1965, the college's name evolved into '''Fitchburg State College'''. James J. Hammond (1963–1975),  Dr. Vincent J. Mara (1975–1995), and Dr. Michael P. Riccards (1995-2002) were the next three presidents of the school and added many buildings to the campus, most notably what are now called the Hammond Building and Mara Village.

Under the guidance of President Robert V. Antonucci (2003–2015), the university focused on enhancing its buildings and grounds in addition to growing its academic programs. The school focused on renovations and rehabilitation of underused buildings and areas as opposed to extensive building. Notable buildings include the {{convert|3500|sqft|m2|adj=on}} campus police station (2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fitchburgpride.com/news/2008/0829/front_page/002.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030922/http://www.fitchburgpride.com/news/2008/0829/front_page/002.html |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Antonucci Science Complex, which included new construction combined with the renovation of the Condike Science Building, in 2011.

Continuing Education at the institution began in the summer of 1915. In 1935 the first graduate programs were established.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.fitchburgstate.edu/aboutus/history/ Fitchburg State College - History of the College&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023101904/http://www.fitchburgstate.edu/aboutus/history/ |date=2010-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, the Massachusetts House of Representatives and Senate voted to rename Fitchburg State College to '''Fitchburg State University'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mass.gov/legis/186history/h04864.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The measure was signed into law by Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick on July 28, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.fsc.edu/fscnews/index.cfm?detail=818{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salemstate.edu/about/10414.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927002323/http://www.salemstate.edu/about/10414.php |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Richard S. Lapidus (2015-present) has established the Office for Institutional Research and Planning, a central service division that provides guidance and data analytic support to senior leaders, and advised in the creation of the campus Veterans Center, one part of a larger diversity initiative that affords veteran students a gathering place. The university has since been officially designated a Military Friendly campus.

==Campus==
The university originally housed students in buildings that now surround the alumni quad.

===Campus buildings===

*'''Hammond Hall''' contains the Amelia V. Gallucci-Cirio Library, the Information Desk, the Game Room, the Falcon Hub (formerly The Underground Pub), the Follet Bookstore, the Campus Center Cafe, and the North Street Bistro (which includes BYOB, 2Mato, Subway, and Freshens). The third floor houses the student services center which includes the tutor center, math center, writing center, disability services, and counseling services, among others.

*'''Amelia V. Gallucci-Cirio Library''' is the main library on campus with over 1 million books, rolls of [[microfiche]], journals, and periodicals, on four floors. It has an extensive collection of children's and young adults books. The Library holds many special collections from notable alumni, faculty, and local residents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fitchburgstate.edu/library/archives/index.cfm Amelia V. Gallucci-Cirio Library: Archives &amp; Special Collections] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031140617/http://www.fitchburgstate.edu/library/archives/index.cfm |date=2010-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These special collections include works from [[Robert Cormier]], well-known author for young adults, and [[R. A. Salvatore]], a prolific fantasy writer, well known for his ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'' novels and ''[[The DemonWars Saga]]''. There are works by Richard Kent, former music teacher for whom Kent Recital Hall was named, Ernst Fandreyer's translation of Gauss' proof, works by William Wolkovich-Valkavicius, as well as papers by John Ellis Van Courtland Moon, former professor of history.

* '''Thompson Hall''', built in 1896, was the University's original building. It is now primarily a classroom building. It is home to the Nursing Department and its laboratories, including a 10-bed mock hospital which is fully equipped to be used in case of an emergency on campus. When the Hammond Campus Center was built, a tunnel that ran to the former Palmer House dormitory was made into a thoroughfare between the second level of the new building and the basement of Thompson Hall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fitchburgstate.edu/facilities/thompson/thompfloorb.cfm Capital Planning &amp; Maintenance - Thompson Hall - Basement Floor Plan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719194232/http://www.fitchburgstate.edu/facilities/thompson/thompfloorb.cfm |date=2011-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Percival Hall.JPG|thumb|left|Percival Hall]]

* '''Edgerly Hall''' was first used as "an eighth-grade model and practice school," which made it one of the first [[junior high schools]] in America. It is now home to the [[Computer Science]] and [[Mathematics]] departments, plus computer labs and classrooms.
* '''Percival Hall''' is directly across the Quad from Edgerly and is the home of the Behavioral Science department, including [[Psychology]], [[Sociology]], and [[Criminal Justice]]  It also houses Percival Auditorium, which seats 400, and classrooms.
* '''Miller Hall''' sits near Percival Hall and Thompson Hall, and houses offices for the [[English language|English]] and [[History]] departments.
* The '''Anthony Student Service Center''' is the student service center on campus, hosting offices for Admissions, Financial Aid, Student Accounts, Graduate and Continuing Education, Registrar, and the OneCard office.
* The '''Dupont Facilities Building''' houses the schools maintenance department.
* The '''Antonucci Science Complex''' houses science classrooms, laboratories and departmental offices, as well as a 90-seat lecture hall.  In 2013, construction of a new "state of the art" 54,700 square foot Science Center Lab Wing was completed, which houses teaching and research laboratory space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cbtarchitects.com/architecture/academic/science/index.php?id=201 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-04-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701232841/http://www.cbtarchitects.com/architecture/academic/science/index.php?id=201 |archive-date=2015-07-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, a full renovation of the pre-existing Condike Science Building was completed.  The Antonucci Science Complex currently houses the Department of Geo/Physical Sciences and the Department of Biology and Chemistry.
* The '''Conlon Arts Building''' is actually two buildings connected by an enclosed walkway. One building is home to the large [[Communication studies|communications]]/media and [[industrial arts|industrial technology]] departments and home to the school's [[Information Technology]] office. This section of the building includes large video and film production resources, a large photography and graphic arts department, and metal, wood, and theatrical scene shops. The other part contains a 280-seat lecture hall, the offices of the fine arts faculty, as well as art/music studios and classrooms.

===Residence halls===
The campus has six residence halls, three of which have rooms in suites, two are designated as apartment-style living, and one has a normal dormitory layout.&lt;ref&gt;[http://virtualtour.fsc.edu Tour] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024152303/http://virtualtour.fsc.edu/ |date=2007-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fitchburgstate.edu/campusliving/ Fitchburg State College - Housing and Residential Services] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719194456/http://www.fitchburgstate.edu/campusliving/ |date=2011-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Fitchburg State Townhouses.JPG|thumb|left|The Townhouse Apartments]]

Aubuchon Hall, Mara Village, and Russell Towers are the three suite halls. Each suite has a common living room area, four to six rooms, and a bathroom. Aubuchon Hall and Mara Village have "locked off" suites: A key is needed to get into the suites.  Aubuchon is home to the office of Housing and Residential Services, which is located on the first floor. Russell is home to the Student Health Service, which provides students with two nurse practitioners and a physician during the week.  Recently, the Campus Mail Center moved to the bottom floor of the Mara Village Commons Building located within the Mara complex.

There are two apartment-style residence halls on campus: the Townhouse Apartments and the North Street Apartments. Because of their layout, both of these halls are usually reserved for upperclassmen. Each one of the 33 Townhouses is equipped with a combination living room/kitchen area, one-and-a-half baths, and individual bedrooms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fitchburgstate.edu/campusliving/housingcost.html Housing and Residential Services - Housing Process - Housing Costs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719194716/http://www.fitchburgstate.edu/campusliving/housingcost.html |date=2011-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The North Street Apartment building was acquired in the summer of 2007 and consists of six apartments. Each apartment has five single bedrooms, a full bathroom and a half bathroom, a kitchen and a living room area.

Herlihy Hall is the smallest and oldest, of the University's current residence halls but has the largest rooms. It houses 150 students in a normal dormitory style (one long corridor with rooms off it), and has the luxury of being connected to the dining commons.

Mara Village was recently expanded and opened for the fall 2009 semester. The $12 million expansion added 125 beds and allows 50% of the undergraduate population to live on campus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fsc-alumni.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=234&amp;Itemid=99999999&lt;/ref&gt;

The campus has also adopted Cedar Street Home as a residence hall. Previously, this building from 1900 was a nursing home. The university bought it in 2005 and to rent the single rooms to girls from sororities. However, in the 2012-2013 academic year the Cedar Street Home became co-ed, and no longer affiliated with sororities specifically.

===Dining facilities===
Holmes Dining Commons, known as the Dining Hall, is the main dining facility on campus. It spans North Street, the main road through campus, and lets foot traffic easily move from one side of the street to the other. It is run by the [[foodservice]] Chartwells and is [[buffet]] style. In the summer of 2006, it had a $4 million renovation.

Chartwells also offers a food court style eating place in the North Street Bistro, located on the street level of the Hammond Campus Center.  Food options at the NSB include BYOB, Create, Cafe, Freshens and Subway.  Students are able to pay with their falcon dollars which are included within their meal plan. Outside guests are welcome.

===Transportation===
Transportation around Fitchburg State University's campus is usually accomplished through walking. Also, there is a [[Montachusett Regional Transit Authority|shuttle bus (Fitchburg/Leominster Fixed Route, Route 4)]] that goes from the [[Wallace Civic Center]], through campus, and then to the [[MBTA Commuter Rail]] stop. The loop takes about 15 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fitchburgstate.edu/campuspolice/shuttlebus.html Campus Police - Shuttle Bus Service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719194735/http://www.fitchburgstate.edu/campuspolice/shuttlebus.html |date=2011-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[MBTA Commuter Rail]] stop closest to the University is the [[Fitchburg (MBTA station)|Fitchburg]] stop on the [[Fitchburg Line]]. The line ends at [[North Station]] and is about an hour and a half ride. It is [[wheelchair accessible]] and a short walk from campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/rail/lines/?route=FITCHBRG MBTA schedule]&lt;/ref&gt;

On and off campus transportation is a collaboration between the Fitchburg State University and the [[Montachusett Regional Transit Authority]]. Faculty, staff, and students can ride any of the [[Montachusett Regional Transit Authority|Fitchburg/Leominster Fixed-Routes Buses]] free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120425132247/http://web.fsc.edu/fscnews/index.cfm?detail=488 Fitchburg State College - Public Relations - News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25276">In [[artificial intelligence]], the '''frame problem''' describes an issue with using [[first-order logic]] (FOL) to express facts about a robot in the world. Representing the state of a robot with traditional FOL requires the use of many axioms that simply imply that things in the environment do not change arbitrarily. For example, Hayes describes a "[[block world]]" with rules about stacking blocks together. In a FOL system, additional [[axiom]]s are required to make inferences about the environment (for example, that a block cannot change position unless it is physically moved). The frame problem is the problem of finding adequate collections of axioms for a viable description of a robot environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hayes|first=Patrick|title=The Frame Problem and Related Problems in Artificial Intelligence|journal=University of Edinburgh|url=http://aitopics.org/sites/default/files/classic/Webber-Nilsson-Readings/Rdgs-NW-Hayes-FrameProblem.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] and [[Patrick J. Hayes]] defined this problem in their 1969 article, ''Some Philosophical Problems from the Standpoint of Artificial Intelligence''.  In this paper, and many that came after, the formal mathematical problem was a starting point for more general discussions of the difficulty of knowledge representation for artificial intelligence. Issues such as how to provide rational default assumptions and what humans consider common sense in a virtual environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCarthy|first=J|author2=P.J. Hayes|title=Some philosophical problems from the standpoint of artificial intelligence|journal=Machine Intelligence|year=1969|volume=4|pages=463–502|citeseerx=10.1.1.85.5082}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, the term acquired a broader meaning in [[philosophy]], where it is formulated as the problem of limiting the beliefs that have to be updated in response to actions. In the logical context, actions are typically specified by what they change, with the implicit assumption that everything else (the frame) remains unchanged.

==Description==
The frame problem occurs even in very simple domains. A scenario with a door, which can be open or closed, and a light, which can be on or off, is statically represented by two [[proposition]]s &lt;math&gt;\textit{open}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textit{on}&lt;/math&gt;. If these conditions can change, they are better represented by two [[Predicate (computer programming)|predicate]]s &lt;math&gt;\textit{open}(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textit{on}(t)&lt;/math&gt; that depend on time; such predicates are called [[fluent (artificial intelligence)|fluent]]s. A domain in which the door is closed and the light off at time 0, and the door opened at time 1, can be directly represented in logic{{clarify|reason=What kind of logic? If ordinary predicate logic is meant, what is the purpose of the 'true →' in the 3rd formula? If some other logic (situation calculus?) is meant, it should be stated explicitly here, together with the purpose of the 'true →' (e.g. some empty action?) in that logic.|date=August 2013}} by the following formulae:

:&lt;math&gt;\neg \textit{open}(0)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\neg \textit{on}(0)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\textit{true} \rightarrow \textit{open}(1)&lt;/math&gt;

The first two formulae represent the initial situation; the third formula represents the effect of executing the action of opening the door at time 1. If such an action had preconditions, such as the door being unlocked, it would have been represented by &lt;math&gt;\neg \textit{locked}(0) \rightarrow \textit{open}(1)&lt;/math&gt;. In practice, one would have a predicate &lt;math&gt;\textit{executeopen}(t)&lt;/math&gt; for specifying when an action is executed and a rule &lt;math&gt;\forall t . \textit{executeopen}(t) \wedge \textit{true} \rightarrow \textit{open}(t+1)&lt;/math&gt; for specifying the effects of actions.  The article on the [[situation calculus]] gives more details.

While the three formulae above are a direct expression in logic of what is known, they do not suffice to correctly draw consequences. While the following conditions (representing the expected situation) are consistent with the three formulae above, they are not the only ones.

:{|
| &lt;math&gt;\neg \textit{open}(0)&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  || &lt;math&gt;\textit{open}(1)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\neg \textit{on}(0)&lt;/math&gt;   || &lt;math&gt;\neg \textit{on}(1)&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Indeed, another set of conditions that is consistent with the three formulae above is:

:{|
| &lt;math&gt;\neg \textit{open}(0)&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  || &lt;math&gt;\textit{open}(1)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\neg \textit{on}(0)&lt;/math&gt;   || &lt;math&gt;\textit{on}(1)&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The frame problem is that specifying only which conditions are changed by the actions does not entail that all other conditions are not changed. This problem can be solved by adding the so-called “frame axioms”, which explicitly specify that all conditions not affected by actions are not changed while executing that action. For example, since the action executed at time 0 is that of opening the door, a frame axiom would state that the status of the light does not change from time 0 to time 1:

:&lt;math&gt;\textit{on}(0) \leftrightarrow \textit{on}(1)&lt;/math&gt;

The frame problem is that one such frame axiom is necessary for every pair of action and condition such that the action does not affect the condition.{{clarify|reason=Shouldn't then the frame axiom be the following modification of the above rule: '∀t.executeopen(t)→open(t+1)∧(on(t+1)↔on(t))' ? In contrast, the formula 'on(0)↔on(1)' seems to be too particular taylored to the 'executeopen(0)' situation.|date=August 2013}} In other words, the problem is that of formalizing a dynamical domain without explicitly specifying the frame axioms.

The solution proposed by McCarthy to solve this problem involves assuming that a minimal amount of condition changes have occurred; this solution is formalized using the framework of [[Circumscription (logic)|circumscription]]. The [[Yale shooting problem]], however, shows that this solution is not always correct. Alternative solutions were then proposed, involving predicate completion, fluent occlusion, [[successor state axiom]]s, etc.; they are explained below. By the end of the 1980s, the frame problem as defined by McCarthy and Hayes was solved{{clarify|reason=Mention the (combination of) approach(es) by which the frame problem was solved.|date=August 2013}}. Even after that, however, the term “frame problem” was still used, in part to refer to the same problem but under different settings (e.g., concurrent actions), and in part to refer to the general problem of representing and reasoning with dynamical domains.

== Solutions ==
The following solutions depict how the frame problem is solved in various formalisms. The formalisms themselves are not presented in full: what is presented are simplified versions that are sufficient to explain the full solution.

===Fluent occlusion solution===
This solution was proposed by [[Erik Sandewall]], who also defined a [[formal language]] for the specification of dynamical domains; therefore, such a domain can be first expressed in this language and then automatically translated into logic. In this article, only the expression in logic is shown, and only in the simplified language with no action names.

The rationale of this solution is to represent not only the value of conditions over time, but also whether they can be affected by the last executed action. The latter is represented by another condition, called occlusion. A condition is said to be ''occluded'' in a given time point if an action has been just executed that makes the condition true or false as an effect. Occlusion can be viewed as “permission to change”: if a condition is occluded, it is relieved from obeying the constraint of inertia.

In the simplified example of the door and the light, occlusion can be formalized by two predicates &lt;math&gt;\textit{occludeopen}(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textit{occludeon}(t)&lt;/math&gt;. The rationale is that a condition can change value only if the corresponding occlusion predicate is true at the next time point. In turn, the occlusion predicate is true only when an action affecting the condition is executed.

:&lt;math&gt;\neg \textit{open}(0)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\neg \textit{on}(0)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\textit{true} \rightarrow \textit{open}(1) \wedge \textit{occludeopen}(1)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall t . \neg \textit{occludeopen}(t) \rightarrow (\textit{open}(t-1) \leftrightarrow \textit{open}(t))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall t . \neg \textit{occludeon}(t) \rightarrow (\textit{on}(t-1) \leftrightarrow \textit{on}(t))&lt;/math&gt;

In general, every action making a condition true or false also makes the corresponding occlusion predicate true. In this case, &lt;math&gt;\textit{occludeopen}(1)&lt;/math&gt; is true, making the antecedent of the fourth formula above false for &lt;math&gt;t=1&lt;/math&gt;; therefore, the constraint that &lt;math&gt;\textit{open}(t-1) \leftrightarrow \textit{open}(t)&lt;/math&gt; does not hold for &lt;math&gt;t=1&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\textit{open}&lt;/math&gt; can change value, which is also what is enforced by the third formula.

In order for this condition to work, occlusion predicates have to be true only when they are made true as an effect of an action. This can be achieved either by [[Circumscription (logic)|circumscription]] or by predicate completion. It is worth noticing that occlusion does not necessarily imply a change: for example, executing the action of opening the door when it was already open (in the formalization above) makes the predicate &lt;math&gt;\textit{occludeopen}&lt;/math&gt; true and makes &lt;math&gt;\textit{open}&lt;/math&gt; true; however, &lt;math&gt;\textit{open}&lt;/math&gt; has not changed value, as it was true already.

===Predicate completion solution===
This encoding is similar to the fluent occlusion solution, but the additional predicates denote change, not permission to change. For example, &lt;math&gt;\textit{changeopen}(t)&lt;/math&gt; represents the fact that the predicate &lt;math&gt;\textit{open}&lt;/math&gt; will change from time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;t+1&lt;/math&gt;. As a result, a predicate changes if and only if the corresponding change predicate is true. An action results in a change if and only if it makes true a condition that was previously false or vice versa.

:&lt;math&gt;\neg \textit{open}(0)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\neg \textit{on}(0)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\neg \textit{open}(0) \wedge \textit{true} \rightarrow \textit{changeopen}(0)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall t. \textit{changeopen}(t) \leftrightarrow (\neg \textit{open}(t) \leftrightarrow \textit{open}(t+1))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall t. \textit{changeon}(t) \leftrightarrow (\neg \textit{on}(t) \leftrightarrow \textit{on}(t+1))&lt;/math&gt;

The third formula is a different way of saying that opening the door causes the door to be opened. Precisely, it states that opening the door changes the state of the door if it had been previously closed. The last two conditions state that a condition changes value at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; if and only if the corresponding change predicate is true at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. To complete the solution, the time points in which the change predicates are true have to be as few as possible, and this can be done by applying predicate completion to the rules specifying the effects of actions.

===Successor state axioms solution===
The value of a condition after the execution of an action can be determined by
the fact that the condition is true if and only if:

# the action makes the condition true; or
# the condition was previously true and the action does not make it false.

A [[successor state axiom]] is a formalization in logic of these two facts. For
example, if &lt;math&gt;\textit{opendoor}(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textit{closedoor}(t)&lt;/math&gt; are two
conditions used to denote that the action executed at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; was
to open or close the door, respectively, the running example is encoded as
follows.

: &lt;math&gt;\neg \textit{open}(0)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\neg \textit{on}(0)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\textit{opendoor}(0)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\forall t . \textit{open}(t+1) \leftrightarrow \textit{opendoor}(t) \vee (\textit{open}(t) \wedge \neg \textit{closedoor}(t))&lt;/math&gt;

This solution is centered around the value of conditions, rather than the
effects of actions. In other words, there is an axiom for every condition,
rather than a formula for every action. Preconditions to actions (which are not
present in this example) are formalized by other formulae. The successor state
axioms are used in the variant to the [[situation calculus]] proposed by
[[Ray Reiter]].

===Fluent calculus solution===
The [[fluent calculus]] is a variant of the situation calculus. It solves the frame problem by using first-order logic
[[First-order logic#Formation rules|terms]], rather than predicates, to represent the states. Converting
predicates into terms in first-order logic is called [[Reification (knowledge representation)|reification]]; the
fluent calculus can be seen as a logic in which predicates representing the
state of conditions are reified.

The difference between a predicate and a term in first-order logic is that a term is a representation of an object (possibly a complex object composed of other objects), while a predicate represents a condition that can be true or false when evaluated over a given set of terms.

In the fluent calculus, each possible state is represented by a term obtained by composition of other terms, each one representing the conditions that are true in state. For example, the state in which the door is open and the light is on is represented by the term &lt;math&gt;\textit{open} \circ \textit{on}&lt;/math&gt;. It is important to notice that a term is not true or false by itself, as it is an object and not a condition. In other words, the term &lt;math&gt;\textit{open} \circ \textit{on}&lt;/math&gt; represent a possible state, and does not by itself mean that this is the current state. A separate condition can be stated to specify that this is actually the state at a given time, e.g., &lt;math&gt;\textit{state}(\textit{open} \circ \textit{on}, 10)&lt;/math&gt; means that this is the state at time &lt;math&gt;10&lt;/math&gt;.

The solution to the frame problem given in the fluent calculus is to specify the effects of actions by stating how a term representing the state changes when the action is executed. For example, the action of opening the door at time 0 is represented by the formula:

: &lt;math&gt;\textit{state}(s \circ \textit{open}, 1) \leftrightarrow \textit{state}(s,0)&lt;/math&gt;

The action of closing the door, which makes a condition false instead of true, is represented in a slightly different way:

: &lt;math&gt;\textit{state}(s, 1) \leftrightarrow \textit{state}(s \circ \textit{open}, 0)&lt;/math&gt;

This formula works provided that suitable axioms are given about &lt;math&gt;\textit{state}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt;, e.g., a term containing the same condition twice is not a valid state (for example, &lt;math&gt;\textit{state}(\textit{open} \circ s \circ \textit{open}, t)&lt;/math&gt; is always false for every &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;).

===Event calculus solution===
The [[event calculus]] uses terms for representing fluents, like the fluent calculus, but also has axioms constraining the value of fluents, like the successor state axioms. In the event calculus, inertia is enforced by formulae stating that a fluent is true if it has been true at a given previous time point and no action changing it to false has been performed in the meantime. Predicate completion is still needed in the event calculus for obtaining that a fluent is made true only if an action making it true has been performed, but also for obtaining that an action had been performed only if that is explicitly stated.

===Default logic solution===
The frame problem can be thought of as the problem of formalizing the principle that, by default, "everything is presumed to remain in the state in which it is" ([[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], "An Introduction to a Secret Encyclopædia", ''c''. 1679).  This default, sometimes called the ''commonsense law of inertia'', was expressed by [[Raymond Reiter]] in [[default logic]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{R(x,s)\; :\ R(x,\textit{do}(a,s))}{R(x,\textit{do}(a,s))}&lt;/math&gt;

(if &lt;math&gt;R(x)&lt;/math&gt; is true in situation &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, and it can be assumed&lt;ref&gt;i.e., no contradicting information is known&lt;/ref&gt; that &lt;math&gt;R(x)&lt;/math&gt; remains true after executing action &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, then we can conclude that &lt;math&gt;R(x)&lt;/math&gt; remains true).

Steve Hanks and [[Drew McDermott]] argued, on the basis of their [[Yale shooting problem|Yale shooting]] example, that this solution to the frame problem is unsatisfactory.  Hudson Turner showed, however, that it works correctly in the presence of appropriate additional postulates.

===Answer set programming solution===
The counterpart of the default logic solution in the language of [[answer set programming]] is a rule with [[stable model semantics#Strong negation|strong negation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;r(X,T+1) \leftarrow r(X,T),\ \hbox{not }\sim r(X,T+1)&lt;/math&gt;

(if &lt;math&gt;r(X)&lt;/math&gt; is true at time &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, and it can be assumed that &lt;math&gt;r(X)&lt;/math&gt; remains true at time &lt;math&gt;T+1&lt;/math&gt;, then we can conclude that &lt;math&gt;r(X)&lt;/math&gt; remains true).

===Action description languages===
[[Action description language]]s elude the frame problem rather than solving it. An action description language is a formal language with a syntax that is specific for describing situations and actions. For example, that the action &lt;math&gt;\textit{opendoor}&lt;/math&gt; makes the door open if not locked is expressed by:

: &lt;math&gt;\textit{opendoor}&lt;/math&gt; causes &lt;math&gt;\textit{open}&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\neg \textit{locked}&lt;/math&gt;

The semantics of an action description language depends on what the language can express (concurrent actions, delayed effects, etc.) and is usually based on [[transition system]]s.

Since domains are expressed in these languages rather than directly in logic, the frame problem only arises when a specification given in an action description logic is to be translated into logic. Typically, however, a translation is given from these languages to [[answer set programming]] rather than first-order logic.

== Asia ==

=== Bangladesh ===

Bangladesh has 5 toll bridges and 4 toll roads. None of them are of an electronic collection system. In Bangladesh, roads and bridges are built by the Government. After building the roads and bridge, the governmement invites tender to give an Operation and management (O&amp;M) contract for 5 years against a fee. The O&amp;M operators maintains the bridge and collects toll on behalf of the government. The toll tariff of Bangabandhu Multipurpose Bridge (formerly known as Jamuna Bridge), length 4.8&amp;nbsp;km, the longest bridge of the country is considered very high compared with other bridges. Mr. Md. Mobarak Hossain, the CEO of Marga Net One Limited (Joint Venture by Pt. Jasa Marga (Persaro) Indonesia and Net One Solutions Ltd. Bangladesh who was also the CEO of the 2nd O&amp;M Operator of Bangabandhu (Jamuna) Bridge, feels that Taka 400 (USD 6.00)per private car is too high, while the trucks and loriies pays a maximum of USD 18.00 for single trip. The Bangabandhu Bridge is a vital link connecting the eastern part of the country with its northern part.

===China===
[[Image:TongshanXian-G106-G316-junction-0020.jpg|thumb|Toll plaza at the junction of [[China National Highway|National Highways]] G106 and G316 in [[Tongshan County, Hubei]]]]
Nearly all Chinese expressways and express routes charge tolls, although they are not often networked from one toll expressway to another. However, beginning with the [[Jingshen Expressway]], tolls are gradually being networked. Given the size of the nation, however, the task is rather difficult.

[[China National Highway]]s, which are not expressways, but "grade-A" routes, also charge tolls. Some provincial, autonomous-regional and municipal routes, as well as some major bridges, will also charge passage fees. In November 2004, legislation in China provided for a minimum length of a stretch of road or expressway in order for tolls to be charged.

===Hong Kong===
{{further|List of tunnels and bridges in Hong Kong}}
In [[Hong Kong]], most tunnels and some bridges that form part of the motorway networks are tolled to cover construction and maintenance costs.  Some built recently are managed in the [[Build-Operate-Transfer]] (BOT) basis.  The companies which build the tunnels or bridges are given franchise of a certain length of time (usually 30 years) to operate.  Ownership will be transferred to the government when the franchise expires. An example is the [[Cross Harbour Tunnel]].

=== India===
{{main|Indian Expressways}}
[[Image:Mumbai Pune ExpresswayDec2007.jpg|thumb|[[Mumbai-Pune Expressway]], [[India]]]]
[[Expressway (India)|Access-controlled roads]] in India are tolled. In addition to cash tolls, toll plazas have dedicated [[electronic toll collection]] lanes for quicker operation.

In addition, most of the [[NHDP|upgraded sections]] of the [[National Highway (India)|National Highway]] network are also tolled. These tolls are lower than those on expressways. The length of [[Expressway (India)|Indian Expressways]] is more than {{convert|500|km|abbr=on}}, also more than {{convert|2500|km|abbr=on}} of expressways are already under construction.

Currently, a [[National Highways Development Project|massive project]] is underway to expand the highway network and the [[Government of India]] plans to add an additional {{convert|18637|km|abbr=on}} of expressways to the  network by the year 2022.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report_expressway-cost-pegged-at-rs20-crore-km_1381235 Govt plans to build 18637 km expressways]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indonesia ===
''Further information: [[List of toll roads in Indonesia]]''
[[Image:Jakpek36.JPG|thumb|KM 36 of [[Jakarta–Cikampek Toll Road]].]]
[[Indonesia]] opened its first toll road, the [[Jagorawi Toll Road]], in 1978. This linked the capital city of [[Jakarta]] to the neighboring cities of [[Bogor]] and [[Ciawi]] south of the capital. 
Today, the system is still limited in its existence, as major toll routes remain in and around the major cities of [[Jakarta]], [[Bandung]], [[Surabaya]], and [[Semarang]]. 
Recently, development in inter–city routes has increased. In 2005, the [[Cipularang Toll Road]] connecting [[Bandung]] in [[West Java]] to [[Jakarta]] was completed. This is a major development for the Indonesian transport system, as a drive between [[Jakarta]] and [[Bandung]] can now be completed in just under 3 hours.

In 2015, the [[Cikampek–Palimanan Toll Road]] connecting [[Jakarta]] and [[Cirebon]] in [[West Java]] was completed. This is another major development as this Toll Road connects [[Jakarta–Cikampek Toll Road]] and [[Palimanan–Kanci Toll Road]], and a drive between [[Jakarta]] and [[Central Java]] using this Toll Road can now be completed around 4 hours.

Indonesia had 34 toll roads until October 2015 :

'''North Sumatra''' : 
[[Belmera]], connecting [[North Sumatra]].

'''Jakarta and Banten''' : 
[[Jakarta–Serpong Toll Road]], [[Jakarta–Tangerang Toll Road]], [[Tangerang–Merak Toll Road]], 
[[Prof. Dr. Sedyatmo Toll Road]], connecting [[Jakarta]] and [[Banten]].

'''Jakarta''' :
[[Jakarta Inner Ring Road]], [[Jakarta Outer Ring Road]], connecting [[Jakarta]].

'''Jakarta and West Java''' :
[[Jakarta–Cikampek Toll Road]], [[Jagorawi Toll Road]], connecting [[West Java]] and [[Jakarta]].

'''West Java''' :
[[Cipularang Toll Road]], [[Padaleunyi Toll Road]], [[Bogor Ring Road]], [[Cikampek–Palimanan Toll Road]], [[Palimanan–Kanci Toll Road]], [[Kanci–Pejagan Toll Road]], connecting [[West Java]].

'''Semarang, Central Java''' :
[[Semarang Section A, B, C Toll Road]], [[Semarang–Ungaran Toll Road]] connecting [[Semarang]].

'''East Java''' :
[[Surabaya–Gresik Toll Road]], [[Surabaya–Gempol Toll Road]], [[Waru–Juanda International Airport Toll Road]], 
[[Surabaya–Madura Bridge Toll Road]], connecting [[East Java]].

'''Denpasar, Bali Island''' :
[[Bali Mandara Toll Road]], connecting Ngurah Rai Airport–Nusa Dua, Ngurah Rai Airport–Denpasar–Benoa.

'''Makasar, South Sulawesi''' :
[[Makassar Airport Toll Road]], connecting [[Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport]].	
 
Plans for another inter–city route in [[Central Java]] between the cities of [[Semarang]] and [[Surakarta]] are under development. Eventually,{{when|date=April 2016}} the whole city in island of Java will be connected by [[Trans–Java toll road]] from [[Merak, Banten|Merak]], [[Banten]] to [[Ketapang]], [[East Java]]. If the [[Sunda Strait Bridge]] is built, the highway network in Java and Sumatra will be connected. By 2025, Indonesia may be connected with the Asia by [[Malacca Strait Bridge]] and [[Trans-Sumatra Toll Road]]. Indonesia also has a project to build [[Trans-Kalimantan Toll Road]] and [[Trans-Sulawesi Toll Road]].

===Israel===
[[Image:Israel Toll Symbol.svg|150px|thumb|right|Israeli toll road sign, showing the [[Israeli new sheqel]] symbol: ₪]]
[[Highway 6 (Israel)|Highway 6]] in [[Israel]], widely known as the Trans-Israel Highway or Cross-Israel Highway, is to date the only electronic toll highway in Israel. Currently Highway 6 is 110&amp;nbsp;km long, all of which is a freeway. This figure will grow in the next few years as additional segments, currently undergoing statutory approvals and permitting processes, are added to the main section of the road. Highway 6 uses a system of cameras and [[transponders]] to toll vehicles automatically. There are no toll booths, allowing Highway 6 to be designed as a normal freeway with interchanges.

=== Japan ===
{{Main|Expressways of Japan}}
The vast majority of Japan's extensive expressway consists of toll roads. Payment of the fare can either be made in cash as one exits or using the [[electronic toll collection]] card system.  As of 2001 the toll fees for an ordinary passenger car was 24.60 [[yen]] per kilometre plus a 150 yen terminal charge.

=== Malaysia ===
{{Main|Malaysian Expressway System}}
[[Malaysia]] has extensive toll roads that forms the majority of country's expressways which in length spans more than 1400&amp;nbsp;km ranging North to the Thai border, South to the Causeway and Second Link to Singapore, West to Klang and Pulau Indah and East towards Kuantan.  Most of the toll roads are in major cities and conurbations such as [[Klang Valley]], [[Johor Bahru]] and [[Penang]].  All of Malaysian toll roads are managed in the [[Build-Operate-Transfer]] basis as in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Japan]] (see [[#Japan|below]]).

===Pakistan===
{{Main|Motorways of Pakistan}}
All motorways and few expressways are toll roads. First such motorway M2 was opened to public in 1997. Since then the M3, M9, M10, and M1, all toll roads, have become operational. The M8 is under construction.

=== Philippines ===

[[File:SLEX Skyway Northbound.jpg|thumb|[[Metro Manila Skyway]]]]
[[File:NAIA Expressway southbound.jpg|thumb|[[NAIA Expressway]]]]
Currently, the [[Philippines]] have ten toll roads, all on the main Island of [[Luzon]].

The 84 kilometer [[North Luzon Expressway]] or NLEx, connecting [[Manila]] with the Central and Northern parts of Luzon. It starts at [[Balintawak Interchange]] in [[Quezon City]], [[Metro Manila]] and ends at Sta. Ines in [[Pampanga]].

The 93.77 kilometer [[Subic–Clark–Tarlac Expressway]] or SCTEx, connecting the [[Subic Bay Freeport Zone]], [[Clark Freeport Zone]], and the Central Techno Park in [[Tarlac City]], [[Tarlac]]. It is also connected to the North Luzon Expressway via a Spur Road in Mabalacat, Pampanga which makes it the continuation of the connection of Manila to the provinces of Central and Northern parts of Luzon. It is the longest expressway in the Philippines.

The 51 kilometer [[South Luzon Expressway]] or SLEx connecting [[Manila]] with [[Santo Tomas, Batangas]]. It is composed of two segments namely, the Osmeña Highway (formerly/also known by many as South Superhighway) which starts from [[Paco, Manila]] and continues until [[Alabang]] in [[Muntinlupa]] and the Alabang-Calamba-Santo Tomas Expressway, which is also known as the South Luzon Tollway (SLT), which comprises the Alabang to Santo Tomas, Batangas segment.

The 16 kilometer [[Metro Manila Skyway]] or simply Skyway is an elevated expressway that connects Manila with [[Alabang]], [[Muntinlupa City]] which is located above the SLEX.

The 42 kilometer [[Southern Tagalog Arterial Road]] or STAR Tollway which runs south from [[Santo Tomas, Batangas]] to the City of [[Batangas City|Batangas]]. It is also connected to the South Luzon Expressway via an exit in Santo Tomas, Batangas since 2010 which makes it the continuation of the connection of Manila to the provinces of the Southern part of Luzon as it also a part or extension of the Radial Road 3 network (see [[Radial Road 3]]).

The 14 kilometer [[Manila–Cavite Expressway]] or CAVITEx is an expressway in the south of the Manila metropolitan area. Connects Manila with the province of [[Cavite]].

The 88.85 kilometer [[Tarlac–Pangasinan–La Union Expressway]] is a four lane expressway currently under construction north of Manila in the Philippines. It connects Central Luzon and North Luzon. It starts at SCTEX in Tarlac Exit and currently ends at Binalonan Exit in [[Pangasinan]]. When the expressway is complete, the northern terminus will be at Rosario Exit in [[La Union]].

The 8.8&amp;nbsp;km [[Subic-Tipo Expressway]] or the NLEx Segment 7 is a two lane expressway in which the alignment traverses the provinces of [[Zambales]] and [[Bataan]]. It begins at Rizal Highway in [[Hermosa, Bataan]] and ends at [[Subic Freeport Zone]]/SBMA at [[Olongapo, Zambales]].

The 4&amp;nbsp;km [[Muntinlupa-Cavite Expressway]], which is also known as MCX and formerly Daang Hari-SLEX Link Expressway is a long access-controlled toll expressway linking the southern province of [[Cavite]] to [[Muntinlupa]] in the [[Philippines]]. The east end is the SLEX in Muntinlupa and the west end is at Daang Hari and Daang Reyna Road junction in Cavite.

The 11.6 kilometer [[NAIA Expressway]] is an elevated expressway that runs from the [[Metro Manila Skyway]] to [[Diokno Boulevard]], and [[Ninoy Aquino Avenue]] and [[NAIA Road]] near [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] Terminal 3. This elevated expressway project is divided into 4 packages. This is also the first airport expressway in the Philippines. It is located in [[Pasay]] and [[Parañaque]], and a little portion in [[Taguig]].

Only the North Luzon Expressway and the South Luzon Expressway (including the Skyway) have an [[electronic toll collection]] system, which is based on the 5.7&amp;nbsp;GHz standard.

===  Singapore ===
''Further information: [[Singapore Area Licensing Scheme]], [[Electronic Road Pricing]]''

In Singapore, toll stations are automated, thus reducing manpower. The automated toll stations, also known to the locals as [[Electronic Road Pricing|ERP]] or Electronic Road Pricing, was introduced by [[Land Transport Authority]] (LTA) to reduce city traffic jams. Although it is advanced, it is still unpopular among Singaporean drivers. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The number of toll stations is increasing rapidly and some Singaporeans even call it "Every road pay".

=== Sri Lanka ===

Sri Lanka currently operates 2 toll roads. The Southern Expressway (E 01) and the Katunayake Expressway (E 03). The Kandy Colombo Expressway (E 02) is under planning at the moment (2013). The toll revenue is used to repair and maintain the expressways.

=== Taiwan===

[[Image:Taiwan Freeway Toll Station Notification.gif|250px|left|thumb|A typical toll booth notification sign in Taiwan]]
[[Image:Taiwan road sign Art060.3.png|100px|right|thumb|Taiwanese Toll Booth Sign off freeways meaning: stop the vehicle to pay toll]]

Freeways in Taiwan are not exactly toll roads in the sense that toll gates/stations are not located at the entrance and exits of the freeway.  Toll stations with [[weigh station]]s are located every thirty to forty kilometres on the No. 1 and No. 3 National Freeways of the [[Republic of China]]. There are usually no freeway exits once a toll station notification sign appears, making it necessary for the driver to be familiar with the locations of the toll stations in advance.

''See [[Highway System in Taiwan#Toll station]] for more detailed information.''

Other toll roads in Taiwan are usually newly built bridges and tunnels. Tolls are frequently collected to pay off the construction cost and once paid off, the tolls may be repealed.

=== Tajikistan ===
Toll roads in Tajikistan are owned and operated by Innovative Road Solutions (IRS). The northern point is in the in Sughd Viloyat and the Southern point ends at Kurgan Tyube (100&amp;nbsp;km south of the capital of the country - Dushanbe). While going from end to end costs roughly $12 US Dollars for regular 2 axle vehicles, it can top to $100 for semitrucks. The IRS is setting up new toll plazas that are going to be able to read off the digital device attached to windshield while passing through at the speed of no more than 15 kph, similar to ones in the United States. This is the only toll road in the entire Central Asia with about 5 cars going through each toll plaza every minute in every direction. The more information can be found on their homepage at www.IRS.tj

=== Thailand ===
Most of the toll roads in Thailand are either within [[Greater Bangkok]] or originated from Bangkok.  They are called [[Controlled-access highway|expressways]], [[tollway]]s, and [[motorway]]s.  Two government agencies under the Ministry of Transport, namely the Expressway Authority of Thailand (EXAT) and the Department of Highways (DoH), own networks of toll roads.  Some are operated by the agencies themselves; others are operated by private concessionaires.  EXAT is in charge of Chaloem Mahanakhon Expressway, Si Rat Expressway, Chalong Rat Expressway, Udon Ratthaya Expressway, Burapha Withi Expressway and Kanchanphisek Outer Ring Road (southern section).  DoH is in charge of Uttraphimuk Tollway (formerly [[Don Mueang]] Tollway), Motorway No. 7 (Bangkok-[[Chonburi (city)|Chonburi]]), and Motorway No. 9 (Kanchanphisek Outer Ring Road - eastern section).  Both agencies have plans to build more toll roads in the future, expanding their networks to the provinces.

[[Electronic Toll Collection]] using passive [[RFID]] tags is used in Chaloem Mahanakhon, Si Rat, Chalong Rat, and Burapha Withi Expressway while Uttraphimuk Tollway  employs passive IC-card-based [[contactless payment|Touch-and-Go]] system.  There are plans to upgrade and expand ETC systems in the near future.

=== United Arab Emirates ===
The toll system [[Salik (Road Toll)|Salik]] started in [[Dubai]] in July 2007.

== Africa ==

===Morocco===
[[Image:A3 Rabat.jpg|thumb|[[Casablanca–Rabat expressway]]]]
[[Morocco]] has an extensive system of toll roads or Autoroutes. These were for the most part recently built, and from [[Casablanca]] connect all of Moroccos major cities such as [[Marrakech]], [[Rabat]], and [[Tangier]]. Operator [[Société Nationale des Autoroutes du Maroc|Autoroutes Du Maroc]] runs the network on a pay-per-use basis, with toll stations placed along its length. Goal is completing a North-South and an East-West link crossing the country. Both axis will be important sections of the ''Pan-African'' main links.&lt;ref&gt;Moroccan operator [[Société Nationale des Autoroutes du Maroc|ADM's]][http://www.adm.co.ma/admin_files/rapport2007.pdf Year 2007 report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720194551/http://www.adm.co.ma/admin_files/rapport2007.pdf |date=2011-07-20 }}, PDF file, downloaded 22 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mozambique===
The Mozambique South Africa Tollway was established in 2014 and is run by private contractors leasing the highway from the Mozambican Government and tolls will be established on many other important paved roads in Mozambique

===South Africa===
In South Africa many of the [[National routes (South Africa)|National routes]] have sections that are toll roads. In cities such as [[Cape Town]] and [[Durban]] the freeways are free of charge. However, with the introduction of electronic tolling (e-tolls) as part of the [[Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project]], tolls were introduced on the upgraded the urban freeways that are National Roads in the province of [[Gauteng]], which includes [[Johannesburg]] and [[Pretoria]]. These Gauteng tolls met resistance in the media and from parts of the population.[https://web.archive.org/web/20140910195422/http://www.thinkafricapress.com/south-africa/buckle-up-going-be-long-ride-e-tolls-gauteng-anc-da] Toll roads are run by the [[South African National Roads Agency Limited]][http://www.nra.co.za/index.html] or in the case of routes like the N3 and N4, by concessionaires.

In 2013 the Ntabazinduna Toll Plaza was opened outside of Bulawayo and the toll system was introduced by a South African Group named Group Five as part of a government project to provide safer highways and to also benefit the local community and also the local economy. Additionially eight more toll plazas will be operating in Zimbabwe.

{{Main|Toll roads in Europe}}
Toll roads in Europe have a long history. The first turnpike road in England was authorised in the seventeenth century. The term ''turnpike'' refers to a gate on which sharp pikes would be fixed as a defence against cavalry. Early references include the (mythical) Greek ferryman [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] charging [[Charon's obol|a toll to ferry (dead) people]] across the river [[Acheron]]. Germanic tribes charged tolls to travellers across [[mountain pass]]es. Tolls were used in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in the 14th century and 15th century.

In some European countries payment of road tolls is made using stickers which are affixed to the windscreen.  [[Germany]] uses [[Toll Collect|a system]] based on satellite technology for large vehicles.  In other countries payment may be made in cash, by credit card, by pre-paid card or by an [[electronic toll collection]] system. Tolls may vary according to the distance travelled, the building and maintenance costs of the motorway and the type of vehicle.

Some of these toll roads are privately owned and operated.  Others are owned by the government.  Some of the government-owned toll roads are privately operated.

=== Belarus ===
Major highways in Belarus are [[toll roads]] with [[Open road tolling]] (ORT) or free-flow tolling. BelToll is an [[electronic toll collection]] system (ETC), valid from 1 July 2013 in the Republic of Belarus.

=== Croatia ===
[[Image:Autocesta A1 kod Trogira.jpg|thumb|[[A1 (Croatia)|A1 motorway]] near [[Trogir]].]]
Almost all Croatian highways are [[toll road]]s with the exception of the [[Zagreb bypass]] and [[Rijeka bypass]]. Most of the highways feature a [[closed toll collection]] system. Tolls are usually calculated according to the basic formula of 0,40 [[Croatian kuna|kn]]/km, multiplied by a factor according to the vehicle category. There are four [[Vehicle classification in Croatia|vehicle categories in Croatia]]:

# two-axle vehicles, up to 1.30 m tall measured at the front axle, including motorcycles
# three and multi-axle vehicles, up to 1.30 m tall measured at the first axle, including all vans
# vehicles more than 1.30 m tall measured at the first axle, including all vans with trailers
# same as the 3rd class, but at least four axles

At some motorways, the motorcycles are classified as a separate category and charged less than two-axle vehicles.

Each class of vehicles pays approximately 1,5 times the toll paid by the previous class. The length and the exact toll for a highway section can be found at the official website of Croatian highway authority.&lt;ref name="hrhac"&gt;[[Hrvatske autoceste]] (HAC) - Croatian highway authority&lt;/ref&gt; If a highway features an [[open toll collection]] system, the toll for the whole highway is paid at a mainline plaza. Such toll collection attracts the [[shunpike]]rs.

There are four Croatian companies that build and maintain highways and collect tolls:

* [[Hrvatske autoceste]] (Croatian Motorways Ltd)
* [[Autocesta Zagreb - Macelj]] (Zagreb - Macelj Motorway)
* [[Autocesta Rijeka - Zagreb]] (Rijeka - Zagreb Motorway)
* [[BINA Istra]]

=== France ===
[[Image:French Autoroute.jpg|thumb|A typical French autoroute.]]
In Europe, the most substantial use of toll roads is in [[France]], where most of the [[Autoroutes of France|autoroute]]s carry quite heavy tolls. In a number of countries the companies have often fallen in and out of the public sector,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and many have had financial problems.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

=== Iceland ===
The [[Hvalfjörður Tunnel]] is tolled.

=== Ireland ===
The [[Republic of Ireland]] has three toll roads, three toll bridges, and two toll tunnels, which are operated by various independent operators. Most were built under a [[public-private partnership]] system, giving the company which arranged for the road to be built the right to collect tolls for a defined period. Tolls vary from €1.65 to €12 for cars.

=== Italy ===

Most [[Autostrada|Italian motorways]] are toll roads, with some exceptions such as some motorways in [[Southern Italy]] and [[Sicily]] or the ''[[Grande Raccordo Anulare]]'' ([[Rome]]'s ring road).

In most motorways, toll is proportional to the distance traveled and has to be paid on exit, where toll gates — {{it}} ''caselli'' — are placed. On other motorways, however, toll gates are placed directly along the route — {{it}} ''barriere'' —. In such cases, it is required to pay a fixed amount, regardless of the distance traveled. [[Autostrada A8 (Italy)|A8]], [[Autostrada A9 (Italy)|A9]], [[Autostrada A52 (Italy)|A52]] are good examples of that system.

Toll can be paid in cash, by credit card, by pre-paid card, or by [[Telepass]].

61% of the Italian motorways are handled by the "Autostrade per l'Italia S.p.A." company, and its subsidiaries. All of these carriers are now privately owned and supervised by ANAS. The network of motorways covers most of [[Italy]]: northern and central Italy are well covered, the south and Sicily are scarcely covered, [[Sardinia]] is not covered at all.

The motorway operators are required to build, operate and maintain their networks at cost and to cover their expenses from the toll they collect. The tolls vary according to the building and maintenance costs of the motorway and the type of vehicle.

Besides the motorways, only some alpine tunnels (such as the [[Mont Blanc Tunnel]]) are tolled. Today, no toll is required on other roads, including motorway-like [[dual carriageway]]s — {{it}} ''superstrade''. The first tolled superstrada is under construction now north of Venice.

=== The Netherlands ===
In the beginning of the 20th century, almost all communities collected toll on all passing traffic, usually including pedestrians and livestock. In 1953, the central government abolished all communal tolls.

As of 2008, there are three effective toll roads in Netherlands. They are for the [[Western Scheldt Tunnel]], [[Kil tunnel]], both major arteries, and the "Tolbrug" (Toll Bridge) in [[Nieuwerbrug]], a local hand-drawn bridge. Also, for the [[Wijkertunnel]], a "shadow toll" is paid by [[Rijkswaterstaat]] for each passed vehicle.

=== Norway ===
Norway has extensively been using toll as a way to finance road infrastructure in the last decades. The toll is called "bompenger" (gate coin) which from comes the first toll roads in Norway, private roads where owners were allowed to charge traffic. The toll ends when the road has been paid off.

There are also toll rings around some cities, where drivers have to pay to enter or leave the city, regardless of if the road is new or old. The first city was [[Bergen]] in 1986. The money goes to construction of intrastructure in and around the city.

=== Poland ===
[[File:Punkty poboru opłat.svg|thumb|Toll plazas in Poland]]
There are three toll highways in Poland, connecting the major cities and the nation's boundaries. Two routes travel east–west, one running between [[Łódź]] and the German border, the other currently connecting [[Katowice]] and [[Kraków]], with current construction extending the roads to the German and Ukrainian boundaries. A north–south route connects Rybnik to Katowice, and [[Torun]] to [[Gdańsk]].

=== Portugal ===
In [[Portugal]] a certain number of roads are designated Toll-Roads. They charge a fixed value per kilometre distance, with several classes depending on vehicle type and regulated by the government. Several authorised franchises run them, the largest at present being [[Brisa - Auto-estradas de Portugal|BRISA]]. For cash-free payments there exists the [[Via Verde]], an electronic toll collection system. On leaving the motorway, charges are automatically debited from a bank account.

=== Russia ===
A number of toll roads in Barnaul and Pskov Region (Nevil-Velezh (RUR 190 ($8)), Pechori-state border RUR 140), also M4-Don (18&amp;nbsp;km close to Lipetsk costs RUR20($0,75) for cars and RUR40 ($1,7) for trucks).

Overall toll network is 383&amp;nbsp;km or 0,05% of total road network. Average price in Pskov region having 226&amp;nbsp;km of toll roads is RUR 2,4-5,5 per km for cars, and RUR 7,9-19,5 for trucks. This comes close to $0,5 per km for trucks.

Ordinary speed limits apply so far. In 2007 adopted Toll Road Law and Concession Law in 2005 to develop this sector.

=== Slovenia ===
For the use of 464,7&amp;nbsp;km of the [[Highways in Slovenia|Slovenian freeways and expressways]] use of toll stickers is obligatory for all vehicles with the permissible maximum weight of 3.5 tons on motorways and expressways as of July 1, 2008. The sticker costs are €15 for 7 days, €30 for a month and €95 for a year. Motorcyclists have to pay €7.50 for 7 days, €25 for a half year and €47.50 for a year.&lt;ref name=price_DARS&gt;[http://www.dars.si/Dokumenti/Toll/Methods_of_payment/Vehicles_up_to_35_t/Vignette_308.aspx Vignette prices on DARS.si]&lt;/ref&gt; Trucks use existing toll road stops.&lt;ref name=cestnina&gt;[http://www.cestnina.si/Default.aspx?id=19766 Cestnina v Sloveniji&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080826075216/http://www.cestnina.si/Default.aspx?id=19766 |date=2008-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of highways and expressways without a valid and properly displayed sticker in a vehicle is a violation of the law and is punished with a fine of €300 or more.&lt;ref name=wieninternational /&gt;

Due to the high costs of toll stickers for transit drivers going to vacation to [[Croatia]]n and [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] coast and others only passing through Slovenia, the highways are avoided by some travellers.&lt;ref name=wieninternational&gt;{{cite web

=== Spain ===
Most [[Spain|Spanish]] toll roads are networked, so you must get a ticket on entering and pay when leaving the road. Technically, all roads belong to the Government, although toll roads are built and maintained by private companies under a State concession; when the concession expires, the road is reverted to State ownership, however most of then are renewed. Toll roads are called in Spanish ''[[Controlled-access highway|autopistas]]''. Freeways, often comparable to ''autopistas'' in building and ride quality, are called '' [[autovía]]s''.

There are some ''autovías'' which are actually built and maintained by private companies, such as Pamplona-Logroño A-12&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navarra.es/home_es/Actualidad/Informes/Obras+Publicas+Transportes+y+Comunicaciones/Autivia+Pamplona-Estella+Logrono.htm Navarra.es Navarran Autonomous Community news bulletin, February 5 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noticiasdenavarra.com/ediciones/2006/04/26/vecinos/estellaymerindad/d26est31.586230.php Noticias de Navarra, May 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927205716/http://www.noticiasdenavarra.com/ediciones/2006/04/26/vecinos/estellaymerindad/d26est31.586230.php |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or Madrid access road M45.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/madrid/M-45/negocio/sombra/elpepuespmad/20050808elpmad_1/Tes El País, August 8 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; The company assumes the building costs and the [[Autonomous Community]] where they are located (in the given examples, [[Navarre]] and [[Madrid]]) pays a yearly per-vehicle fee to the company based upon usage statistics, called "shadow toll" (in Spanish, ''peaje en la sombra'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitalmadrid.info/2007-04-02/4293.html Capital Madrid, march 30 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120730010406/http://www.capitalmadrid.info/2007-04-02/4293.html |date=2012-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The system can be regarded as a way for the Government to finance the build of new roads at the expense of the building company. Also, since the payment starts only after the road is finished, construction delays are usually shorter than those of regular state-owned freeways. However, those cannot be classified as toll roads since drivers do not need to pay any fees.

=== Sweden ===
The border-crossing [[Oresund Bridge|The Oresund Bridge]] and [[Svinesund Bridge]] have tolls. The [[Stockholm congestion tax|Stockholm]] and [[Gothenburg congestion tax|Gothenburg]] City areas have [[congestion pricing]] on entry. The [[Sundsvall Bridge]] is a proper toll bridge. Before the year 2000 road tolls did not exist in Sweden for several decades.

=== Switzerland ===

[[Image:A2 Bridge.jpg|thumb|The [[A2 motorway (Switzerland)|A2 motorway]] in [[Ticino]], suspended over viaducts]]
For the use of [[Motorways of Switzerland|Swiss motorways]] the use of toll stickers is obligatory. They costs CHF&amp;nbsp;40 per year per vehicle (a car towing a trailer needs two stickers). There are no stickers for shorter periods and they are valid 14 months (the 2010 sticker is valid from 1 December 2009 until 31 January 2011). However, this also means that a sticker bought any time during the year can only be used for less than the maximum period until January 31 of the following year.

=== Republic of Turkey ===

In the Republic of [[Turkey]] toll is collected on certain highways, the so-called ''Otoyolları'' or ''Karayolları''. This is done so by three different systems. Every toll road has lanes for all three payment methods. One method is KGS (Kartlı Geçiş Sistemi) ([[English language|English]]: ''Card passage system'') which requires a [[Stored-value card|Prepaid]] card to be presented at the toll port. Every passing will be withdrawn from the card. Another method is HGS (Hızlı Geçiş Sistemi) ([[English language|English]]: ''Fast passage system''.) which uses a [[RFID]] chip stuck to the windshield of the vehicle. This chip is scanned automatically when passing the toll collecting point and money will be automatically withdrawn from the connected bank account. The last system is OGS which is calles ''Otomatik Geçiş Sistemi'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and translates ''Automatic passage system'' in [[English language|English]]. This form of payment requires a fixed amount of money to be paid for a monthly or annual subscription. When subscribed, your car will be equipped with a [[barcode]]d sticker, which will be checked by [[CCTV]] cameras automatically to check if the car is actually subscribed. The Turkish toll system can't be avoided (except for avoiding toll roads), because one can simply not pass KGS without the required card, and due to the cameras, all cars passing OGS and HGS with no or expired or counterfied chips or stickers will get a fine nicely presented at their home address.

=== United Kingdom ===
{{main|Toll roads in Great Britain|Turnpike Trust}}
[[Image:M6 Toll plaza, Great Wyrley.jpg|thumb|[[M6 Toll|M6]] Toll plaza for northbound traffic at [[Great Wyrley]]]]
Road rates were introduced in [[England]] in the seventeenth century. The first turnpike road, whereby travellers paid tolls to be used for road upkeep, was authorised in 1663 for a section of the [[Great North Road (United Kingdom)|Great North Road]] in [[Hertfordshire]].  The first [[turnpike trust]] was established by Parliament through a Turnpike Act in 1706. From 1751 until 1772 there was a flurry of interest in turnpike trusts and a further 390 were established. By 1825 over 1,000 trusts controlled 25,000 miles (40,000&amp;nbsp;km) of road in England and [[Wales]].

The rise of [[railway]] transport largely halted the improving schemes of the turnpike trusts. Unable to earn sufficient revenue from tolls alone the trusts took to requiring taxes from the local parishes. The system was never properly reformed but from the 1870s Parliament stopped renewing the acts and roads began to revert to local authorities, the last trust vanishing in 1895. The [[Local Government Act 1888]] created county councils and gave them responsibility for maintaining the major roads. There are still a small number of toll bridges left including [[Swinford toll bridge]] near [[Oxford]].

Most UK roads today are maintained from general taxation, some of which is raised from motoring taxes including [[Hydrocarbon oil duty|fuel duty]] and [[vehicle excise duty]].  Today, there are few tolls on roads in the United Kingdom - mainly toll bridges and tunnels. Until recently there were only two toll roads to which there is a [[public right of way]] (Rye Road in [[Stanstead Abbotts]] and College Road in [[Dulwich]]) together with another five or so private toll-roads. However, the motorway recently constructed to the north of [[Birmingham]] levies a usage charge, and is therefore known as the [[M6 Toll]]. It is potentially the first of a new generation of toll roads.

== North and South America ==

=== Brazil ===
In [[Brazil]], toll roads are a recent institution, and were adopted mostly in non-federal [[highways]]. The state of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] has the highest length of toll roads, which are exploited either by private companies which bought a concession from the state, or by a state owned company (see [[Highway system of São Paulo]]). In São Paulo there is also a statewide electronic collection system using a plastic transponder (e-tag) attached to the windscreen, named ''SemParar'''. There is a growing trend towards tolling in all major highways of the country, but some resistance by the population is beginning to be felt, particularly due to some abuses which are being imposed, restricting the constitutional rights of coming and going (because the Brazilian highway system has very few non-tolled vicinal roads in parallel to highways) and making some trips an extremely expensive affair, as compared to average Brazilian earning power (in São Paulo, a 1,000&amp;nbsp;km round trip may cost upward of two hundreds [[Brazilian real]] in some roads, higher than petrol expenses).

=== Canada ===
Most tolled roadways in [[Canada]] are bridges to the [[United States]], although a few domestic bridges in some provinces have tolls. In [[Vancouver]], tolls were set up to pay for the construction of the new [[Port Mann Bridge]] which connects the [[Trans Canada Highway]] from [[Surrey]] to [[Coquitlam]] over the [[Fraser River]].  Toll highways disappeared, for the most part, in the 1970s and 1980s.  In the 1990s, political pressure dropped the new tolls on an upgraded section of the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] in [[New Brunswick]].  [[Ontario Highway 407|Highway 407]] in the [[Greater Toronto Area]] is a modern ''toll route'' and does not have collection booths but an overhead sensor. It's heavily criticized as the government leased it for 99 years with the company having unlimited control of the highway and tolls so it is expensive, but still a necessity for gridlocked [[Toronto]]. [[Nova Scotia]] has a toll highway on the Trans Canada Highway between [[Debert, Nova Scotia|Debert]] and [[Oxford, Nova Scotia|Oxford]].

=== Colombia ===
Many highways in [[Colombia]] charge tolls. Motorcycles are allowed to bypass for free.

=== Ecuador ===
The [[Pan-American Highway]] in [[Ecuador]] charges tolls. Motorcycles pay a reduced fare.

=== Mexico===
[[Mexico]] has an extensive system of toll roads or Autopistas. Autopistas are built and funded by Federal taxes and are built to nearly identical standards as the US Interstate Highways System. Also, many states in Mexico have their own toll roads such as Puebla, Veracruz and Nuevo León. Motorcycles pay the same fare as cars.
All federal toll highways operate with 3 payment options, cash, credit card and electronic tag IAVE.
IAVE in all the highways is operated by Caminos y Puentes Federales (CAPUFE).

=== Panama ===
Most of the toll roads in [[Panama]] were built in the mid 1990s, with the exception of the [[Arraijan-Chorrerra Highway]]. The three modern toll roads were built after the transportation plan made by the Government of [[Japan]] in the mid 1980s using the [[Build–operate–transfer|BOT]] formula. This highways are the [[Corredor Norte]] in the north of the [[Panama City]], and the [[Corredor Sur]] in the south. Another highway was built and is the [[Panama-Colon Highway]].

=== Puerto Rico ===
There are several toll roads in Puerto Rico, where toll roads are called "autopista" (which loosely translates to "car raceway") and toll houses are called "peaje".

=== United States ===
{{Main|Toll roads in the United States}}
[[Image:Pennsylvania Turnpike westbound.jpg|thumb|[[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] westbound, approaching Pittsburgh interchange with I-376/US 22.]]
[[Image:Dallas North Tollway - Texas State Highway Loop 12 Northwest Highway - 4548 - jpfagerback 2013-05-07.jpg|thumb|[[Dallas North Tollway]] just north of the [[Texas State Highway Loop 12|Northwest Highway]]]]

A ''toll road'' in the United States, especially near the east coast, is often called a ''turnpike''. The term ''turnpike'' originated from the ''turnstile'' or gate which blocked passage until the fare was paid at a ''toll house'' (or ''toll booth'' in current terminology). Most tolled facilities in the US today use an [[electronic toll collection]] system as an alternative to paying cash. Examples of this are the [[E-ZPass]] system used on most [[toll bridge]]s and toll roads in the eastern U.S. from [[North Carolina]] to [[Maine]] and [[Illinois]]; [[Houston]]'s [[EZ Tag]], which also works in other parts of the state of [[Texas]], [[Oklahoma]]'s [[PikePass|Pikepass]] (which also works in Texas and Kansas), [[California]]'s [[FasTrak]], [[Illinois]]' [[I-Pass]], and [[Florida]]'s [[SunPass]]. Toll roads are only in 26 states as of 2006. The majority of states without any turnpikes are in the [[Western United States|West]] and [[Southern United States|South]].

After a halt in toll road construction following the establishment of the [[Interstate Highway System]] in 1956, many states are going back to implementing tolls to fund capital improvements and manage congestion.  This is because the cost of expanding and maintaining the highway network is increasing faster than the amount of revenue that can be generated by the federal [[gasoline tax]] for the [[Highway Trust Fund]].  Years after abolishing tolls, [[Kentucky]] and [[Connecticut]] are both re-examining the possibility of reinstating tolls on some highways, while several other states are advancing the construction of new toll roads to supplement their existing networks of toll-free expressways.

== Oceania ==

=== Australia ===
In Australia, a small number of motorways have been tolled due to cover the expense of their construction. Such roads can be found in the Australian cities of Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. There are no toll roads in the Australian states of [[South Australia]], [[Western Australia]], [[Tasmania]] or any of the mainland [[States and territories of Australia|territories]]. Toll collection is by electronic toll collection; there are no longer any cash booths in Australia.

In [[Brisbane]], there are three tollway operators ([[Brisbane City Council]], [[Queensland Motorways]], and [[RiverCity Motorway]]).  Brisbane City Council owns and operates the [[Go Between Bridge]] over the [[Brisbane River]] in the city.  Queensland Motorways operates the tolls on the [[Sir Leo Hielscher Bridges]], and another two on the [[Logan Motorway]] on the south side.  RiverCity Motorway operates the [[Clem Jones Tunnel]], which runs underneath the city between the inner southern and northern suburbs.  All toll collection points are electronically operated. Another company, BrisConnections, is currently constructing another toll tunnel (the longest tunnel in Australia) called the [[Airport Link, Brisbane|Airport Link]], and will allow traffic to flow from the northern Clem Jones - [[Inner City Bypass]] interchange, direct to [[Brisbane Airport]].  Construction is due to be complete in 2012. International Travellers and people that are new to Brisbane should note, the penalty for non payment of tolls is in excess of $140 (per trip). It is best to avoid toll roads at all costs as it really saves little time and is often classed by the general Brisbane public as "revenue raising".

In [[Melbourne]], there are two companies that operate tollways within the Melbourne metropolitan area. Transurban operates [[CityLink]] covering sections of the [[Monash Freeway]], Southern Link, Western Link and the upgraded sections of the [[Tullamarine Freeway]]. ConnectEast operates [[EastLink, Melbourne|EastLink]] that runs through the Eastern Suburbs of Melbourne. All Melbourne tollways are electronically tolled. The [[West Gate Bridge]] opened as a toll bridge upon its completion in 1978, however the toll was abolished in 1985.

In [[Sydney]], many of the motorways contain at least one tolled section with a mixture of government and private ownership. The State Government owns the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] and [[Sydney Harbour Tunnel]], while the [[Metroad 2|M2 Motorway]], [[Metroad 4|M4 Motorway]], [[Metroad 5|M5 Motorway]], [[Eastern Distributor]], [[Westlink M7]] and [[Lane Cove Tunnel]] are privately operated by a variety of companies such as Macquarie Infrastructure, Transurban, and to a lesser extent Industry Super funds such as Retail Employees Super, SunSuper, and the Industry Funds Management which partly own the M5 motorway in South Western Sydney.

As well as the tolled motorways, the [[Cross City Tunnel]] - an east–west route underneath the Sydney CBD - was opened to traffic in 2005. This road has become somewhat controversial due to the relatively high toll charge and the closure of surrounding roads designed to funnel traffic through the tunnel.

All Sydney tollways accept E-tags; the [[Westlink M7]], [[Sydney Harbour Tunnel]], [[Cross City Tunnel]], [[Lane Cove Tunnel]] and from 1 December 2007 on the [[M2 Hills Motorway|M2 Motorway]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20070705000527/http://www.hillsm2.com.au/transurban_online/ne5nav_hills.nsf/LinkView/7701C3D3519B46E2CA2572C80075D69CABD5DAB709F88F70CA25703E0064DA30] [http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,22023173-5001021,00.html] have no cash booths, just E-Tag readers to zoom on through as they charge their tolls only through electronic tolling methods or through the use of number plate reading as you go through, then you have to pay after a certain time frame (for example; before 24 hours), otherwise you will get a fine in the mail. The [[M5 South Western Motorway|M5 Motorway]] moved to electronic only tolling in 2013. Tolls on the [[M4 Western Motorway|M4 Motorway]] were abolished in 2010. An E-Tag is an RFID device that allow a driver to pass through a toll point without physically stopping. When a vehicle fitted with an E-Tag passes through a toll collection point, the E-Tag identifies the electronic account of the vehicle passing through and the toll-road operator recovers the toll via that account. There are four providers of E-tag accounts in New South Wales (RTA, RoamTag, Interlink Roads, and M2 Consortium). All tags provided by these four providers can be used on every E-Tag-enabled tollway in Australia.

=== New Zealand ===
* [[Auckland Harbour Bridge]] was opened in 1959 and operated as a toll bridge until 1984. In the 1960s a group of university students attempted to disrupt the toll system by repeatedly crossing the bridge using motor-scooters (to which a very low toll applied), and paying their toll in £5 notes; the hope was that they would exhaust the supplies of change held at the toll booths. However, the toll authority got wind of their plans and got a very large supply of small change (copper coinage), so the students were soon weighed down with large amounts of small change.
* The [[Lyttelton Road Tunnel]], linking the City of [[Christchurch]] with the harbour at [[Lyttelton, New Zealand|Lyttelton]], was originally a Toll Tunnel built in 1962. The government of the day promised that as soon as the tunnel was paid for, the toll would be removed The promise was kept, and the toll was removed in the mid-1970s once the tunnel had been paid off. The Tunnel Authority building and toll booths are still there at the Heathcote end.
* The City of [[Tauranga, New Zealand|Tauranga]] operates a toll road running between the outlying settlement of Tauriko on State Highway 2 and central business district of the city. This toll road also act as a feeder route for the [[Tauranga Harbour Bridge]]. Tolls are collected by staff operating tollbooths at the western end of the road.
* The Northern Gateway Toll Road is a 7.5&amp;nbsp;km motorway extension to State Highway 1 just north of [[Auckland]]. Northbound, the toll road begins just before [[Orewa]] and ends via a pair of road tunnels through the Johnstone Hills near Puhoi. The toll road opened in January 2009 and gives motorists a choice between a more direct route or State Highway 17 via Orewa. Tolling is implemented through automatic vehicle license plate reading with cameras in an overhead gantry.

'''Global Money Week (GMW)''' is a global money awareness celebration that takes place in March every year.&lt;ref name="newsandevents"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalmoneyweek.org/about/about-global-money-week.html|title=Global Money Week|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Childfinanceinternational.org|accessdate=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is coordinated by the [[Child and Youth Finance International]] (CYFI) Secretariat to raise awareness on [[Economic Citizenship]] and directly engage children and youth worldwide on the issue. The celebration of Global Money Week consists of a series of activities held at the regional, national and local level by the partners and stakeholders of the Child and Youth Finance Movement, and are geared toward engaging children, youth and their communities in learning about financial education and financial inclusion.&lt;ref name="newsandevents" /&gt;

According to the Global Money Week website, “GMW is an annual global celebration, initiated by Child &amp; Youth Finance International (CYFI), with local and regional events and activities aimed at inspiring children and youth to learn about money, saving, creating livelihoods, gaining employment and becoming an entrepreneur.” &lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalmoneyweek.org/about/about-global-money-week.html|title=About|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Globalmoneyweek.org|accessdate=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==GMW in previous years==
In 2013, GMW involved approximately 1 million children in 80 countries ranging across Europe, the Americas, Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Over 1000 activities were organized by 403 organizations, such as NGOs, central banks, Ministries of Finance, corporations and schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/childfinanceinternational/docs/global_money_week_report_2013/1?e=7128000/2518812|title=Global Money Week Report 2013|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Childfinanceinternational.org|format=PDF|accessdate=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GMW 2014 saw the participation of 3 million children, 118 countries, over 2000 activities and 490 organizations involved in the theme of enterprise: among those, central banks, governmental bodies, educational institutions.&lt;ref name="globalmoneyweek.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalmoneyweek.org/civil-society |title=Civil Society |publisher=Globalmoneyweek.org |date=2015-03-12 |accessdate=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 event saw a number of multi-sectoral organizations working together for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/childfinanceinternational/docs/2014_gmw_report_2014_8589ec3f401824|title=Global Money Week Report 2014|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=ISSUU.com|accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During GMW 2015 the theme was, “Save Today, Safe Tomorrow.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/childfinanceinternational/docs/gmw_report_2015/1?e=7128000/14165258|title=Global Money Week Report 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|format=|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over 5.6 million children &amp; youth took part in the celebrations in 124 countries.

In 2016, GMW expanded even further, reaching over 7 million children and young people across 132 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://issuu.com/childfinanceinternational/docs/gmw_report_2016/1?e=7128000/38177764|title=Global Money Week Report 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ever increasing number of countries and organizations were involved in supporting the millions of young people taking part in money awareness, financial literacy, and entrepreneurship activities during the 2016 Global Money Week celebrations, which focused on the theme 'Take Part, Save Smart'.

The 2017 edition of GMW will take place from 27 March - 2 April, with the theme 'Learn Save Earn':
* Learn: Educating children and young people about their social and economic rights and responsibilities is key to creating a generation of capable adults who can make wise decisions for their future
* Save: It is important for children and youth to build clever savings habits from an early age in order to cultivate key money-managing skills for later in life
* Earn: Developing livelihoods skills or receiving entrepreneurial training supports children and young people with getting a job or building their own business and developing their careers.

==Types of activities==
[[File:GMW Kyrgyzstan.jpg|thumb|GMW celebrations in Kyrgyzstan]]

'''HAL''' ('''Hardware Abstraction Layer''' or rather '''Hardware Annotation Library''') is a [[software]] subsystem for [[Unix-like|UNIX-like]] operating systems providing [[hardware abstraction]].

HAL is now [[deprecation|deprecated]] on most Linux distributions and on FreeBSD. Functionality is being merged into [[udev]] on Linux as of 2008–2010 and devd on FreeBSD.{{fact|date=November 2017}} Previously, HAL was built on top of udev.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

Some other OS-es which don't have an alternative like udev or devd, still use HAL.

The purpose of the hardware abstraction layer was to allow [[desktop application]]s to discover and use the [[computer hardware|hardware]] of the host system through a simple, [[Software portability|portable]] and [[abstraction (computer science)|abstract]] [[API]], regardless of the type of the underlying hardware.&lt;ref name="pennington"&gt;{{citation
| title = Making Hardware Just Work
| first = Havoc
| last = Pennington
| date = 2003-07-10
| url = http://ometer.com/hardware.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HAL for Linux OS was originally envisioned by [[Havoc Pennington]]. It became a [[freedesktop.org]] project, and was a key part of the software stack of the [[GNOME]] and [[KDE]] [[desktop environment]]s.  It is [[free software]], dual-licensed under both the [[GNU General Public License]] and the [[Academic Free License]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
| url = https://cgit.freedesktop.org/hal/tree/COPYING
| title = HAL source code license text
| quote = HAL is licensed to you under your choice of the Academic Free License version 2.1, or the GNU General Public License version 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HAL is unrelated to the concept of [[Windows NT]] kernel HALs, which handle some platform-specific core functionality within the kernel, such as interrupt routing.

== Rationale ==

Traditionally, the [[operating system]] [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] was responsible for providing an abstract interface to the hardware the system ran on. Applications used the [[system call]] interface, or performed file [[input/output|I/O]] on [[device node]]s in order to communicate with hardware through these abstractions.  This sufficed for the simple hardware of early desktop computing.

Computer hardware, however, has increased in complexity and the abstractions provided by Unix kernels have not kept pace with the proliferating number of device and [[peripheral]] types now common on both server and desktop computers.  Most modern [[computer bus|buses]] have also become [[hotplug]]-capable and can have non-trivial [[network topology|topologies]].  As a result, devices are discovered or change state in ways which can be difficult to track through the system call interface or Unix IPC.  The complexity of doing so forces application authors to re-implement hardware support logic.&lt;ref name="pennington" /&gt;

Some devices also require privileged helper programs to prepare them for use.  These must often be invoked in ways that can be awkward to express with the Unix permissions model (for example, allowing users to join [[wireless network]]s only if they are logged into the video console).&lt;ref name="pennington" /&gt;  Application authors resort to using [[setuid]] binaries or run service [[Daemon (computer software)|daemon]]s to provide their own access control and privilege separation, potentially introducing security holes each time.

== Design ==

HAL is a single daemon responsible for discovering, enumerating and mediating access to most of the hardware on the host computer.  Applications communicate with HAL through the [[D-Bus]] [[inter-process communication|IPC]] mechanism, which abstracts the hardware behind an [[object-based]] [[remote procedure call|RPC]] mechanism.

Each logical hardware ''device'' is represented as a D-Bus object, and its bus address is used as a unique identifier.  Devices include abstractions like [[disk partition]]s and visible wireless networks. The device's functionality is exposed through D-Bus ''interfaces'', and its state accessed through ''properties'', a set of key-value pairs.

HAL broadcasts hardware events as ''signals'' on these objects; applications can listen for signals and react to the hardware events that they signify — events such as a [[digital camera]] being plugged in, an [[optical disc]] spinning up or a laptop computer  closing its lid.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

== Implementations and obsolescence ==

On Linux, HAL uses &lt;code&gt;[[Sysfs|/sys]]&lt;/code&gt; (a [[virtual file system]] for [[Linux]] systems) to discover hardware and listen for kernel [[hotplugging|hotplug]] events.  Some Linux distributions also provide a [[udev]] rule to allow the udev daemon to notify HAL whenever new device nodes appear.

In December 2016, Linux kernel graphics subsystem maintainer Dave Airlie wrote "No HALs. We don't do HALs in the kernel."&lt;ref name="no-hals-in-the-kernel"&gt;{{citation

| accessdate = 2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The replacement for non-Linux systems such as FreeBSD is devd.

Initially a new daemon [[DeviceKit]] was planned to replace certain aspects of HAL, but in March 2009, DeviceKit was deprecated in favor of adding the same code to udev as a package: &lt;tt&gt;udev-extras&lt;/tt&gt;, and some functions have now moved to &lt;tt&gt;udev&lt;/tt&gt; proper.

[[File:i-Beam 002.JPG|right|thumb|upright=1.20|This I-beam is used to support the first floor of a house.]]
An '''{{ibeam}}-beam''', also known as '''H-beam''' (for '''universal column''', '''UC'''), '''w-beam''' (for "wide flange"), '''universal beam''' ('''UB'''), '''rolled steel joist''' ('''RSJ'''), or '''double-T''' (especially in [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[German language|German]]), is a [[beam (structure)|beam]] with an {{ibeam}} or H-shaped [[cross section (geometry)|cross-section]]. The horizontal elements of the "{{ibeam}}" are known as [[flange]]s, while the vertical element is termed the "web". I-beams are usually made of [[structural steel]] and are used in construction and civil engineering.

The web resists shear forces, while the flanges resist most of the bending moment experienced by the beam. [[Euler-Bernoulli beam equation|Beam theory]] shows that the I-shaped section is a very efficient form for carrying both [[bending]] and [[shearing (physics)|shear]] loads in the plane of the web. On the other hand, the cross-section has a reduced capacity in the transverse direction, and is also inefficient in carrying [[torsion (mechanics)|torsion]], for which [[hollow structural section]]s are often preferred.

== History ==
The method of producing an I-beam, as rolled from a single piece of steel, was patented by Alphonse Halbou of the company ''[[Forges de la Providence]]'' in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=18-6AAAAIAAJ|page=82|title=International directory of company histories|volume=26|author=Thomas Derdak, Jay P. Pederson|publisher=St. James Press|year=1999|isbn=978-1-55862-385-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bethlehem Steel]] was a leading supplier of rolled structural steel of various cross-sections in American bridge and skyscraper work of the mid-twentieth century.&lt;ref name="MorningCallSupplement2003"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = The Morning Call | authorlink = The Morning Call | year = 2003 | title = Forging America: The History of Bethlehem Steel | work = Morning Call Supplement | publisher = The Morning Call | location = [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown, PA, USA]]  | url = http://www.mcall.com/news/specials/bethsteel/all-bethsteel-c0p1,0,4389048.story?coll=all-bethsteel-nav | doi =  | id =  | postscript =. ''A detailed history of the company by journalists of the Morning Call staff.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, rolled cross-sections have been partially displaced in such work by [[Fabrication (metal)|fabricated]] cross-sections.

== Overview ==
[[File:Ibeam.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.20|Typical cross-section of I-beams.]]

There are two standard I-beam forms:
* Rolled I-beam, formed by [[hot rolling]], [[cold rolling]] or [[extrusion]] (depending on material).
* [[Plate girder]], formed by [[welding]] (or occasionally [[bolted joint|bolting]] or [[rivet]]ing) plates.

I-beams are commonly made of [[structural steel]] but may also be formed from [[aluminium]] or other materials. A common type of I-beam is the ''rolled steel joist'' (RSJ)—sometimes incorrectly rendered as ''reinforced steel joist''. [[British Standard|British]] and [[European Committee for Standardization|European standards]] also specify Universal Beams (UBs) and Universal Columns (UCs). These sections have parallel flanges, as opposed to the varying thickness of RSJ flanges which are seldom now rolled in the UK. Parallel flanges are easier to connect to and do away with the need for tapering washers. UCs have equal or near-equal width and depth and are more suited to being oriented vertically to carry axial load such as columns in multi-storey construction, while UBs are significantly deeper than they are wide are more suited to carrying bending load such as beam elements in floors.

[[I-joist]]s—I-beams engineered from wood with [[fiberboard]] and/or [[laminated veneer lumber]]—are also becoming increasingly popular in construction, especially residential, as they are both lighter and less prone to warping than solid wooden [[joist]]s. However, there has been some concern as to their rapid loss of strength in a fire if unprotected.

== Design ==
[[File:Beam mode 2.gif|right|thumb|upright=1.20|Illustration of an I-beam vibrating in torsion mode.]]
I-beams are widely used in the [[construction industry]] and are available in a variety of standard sizes. Tables are available to allow easy selection of a suitable steel I-beam size for a given applied load. I-beams may be used both as beams and as [[column]]s.

I-beams may be used both on their own, or acting [[composite material|compositely]] with another material, typically [[concrete]]. Design may be governed by any of the following criteria:
* [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]]: the [[stiffness]] of the I-beam will be chosen to minimize deformation
* [[vibration]]: the stiffness and [[mass]] are chosen to prevent unacceptable vibrations, particularly in settings sensitive to vibrations, such as offices and libraries
* bending failure by [[yield (engineering)|yielding]]: where the [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] in the cross section exceeds the [[yield stress]]
* bending failure by [[Buckling#Lateral-torsional buckling|lateral torsional buckling]]: where a flange in compression tends to buckle sideways or the entire cross-section buckles torsionally
* bending failure by [[Buckling#Local buckling|local buckling]]: where the flange or web is so slender as to buckle locally
* local yield: caused by concentrated loads, such as at the beam's point of support
* [[shear failure]]: where the web fails. Slender webs will fail by buckling, rippling in a phenomenon termed '''tension field action''', but shear failure is also resisted by the stiffness of the flanges
* buckling or yielding of components: for example, of stiffeners used to provide stability to the I-beam's web.

[[File:Poutre flexion deviee.svg|thumb|upright=1.80|The largest stresses (&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{xx}&lt;/math&gt;) in a beam under bending are in the locations farthest from the neutral axis.]]

A beam under bending sees high stresses along the axial fibers that are farthest from the [[neutral axis]].  To prevent failure, most of the material in the beam must be located in these regions.  Comparatively little material is needed in the area close to the neutral axis.  This observation is the basis of the I-beam cross-section; the neutral axis runs along the center of the web which can be relatively thin and most of the material can be concentrated in the flanges.

The ideal beam is the one with the least cross-sectional area (and hence requiring the least material) needed to achieve a given [[section modulus]].  Since the section modulus depends on the value of the [[second moment of area|moment of inertia]], an efficient beam must have most of its material located as far from the neutral axis as possible.  The farther a given amount of material is from the neutral axis, the larger is the section modulus and hence a larger bending moment can be resisted.

When designing a symmetric I-beam to resist stresses due to bending the usual starting point is the required section modulus.  If the allowable stress is &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{\mathrm{max}}&lt;/math&gt; and the maximum expected bending moment is &lt;math&gt;M_{\mathrm{max}}&lt;/math&gt;, then the required section modulus is given by&lt;ref name=Gere /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   S = \cfrac{M_{\mathrm{max}}}{\sigma_{\mathrm{max}}} = \cfrac{I}{c}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the moment of inertia of the beam cross-section and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the distance of the top of the beam from the neutral axis (see [[beam theory]] for more details).

For a beam of cross-sectional area &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and height &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, the ideal cross-section would have half the area at a distance &lt;math&gt;h/2&lt;/math&gt; above the cross-section and the other half at a distance &lt;math&gt;h/2&lt;/math&gt; below the cross-section&lt;ref name=Gere&gt;Gere and Timoshenko, 1997, ''Mechanics of Materials'', PWS Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;  For this cross-section
:&lt;math&gt;
   I = \cfrac{ah^2}{4} ~;~~ S = 0.5 a h
 &lt;/math&gt;
However, these ideal conditions can never be achieved because material is needed in the web for physical reasons, including to resist buckling.  For wide-flange beams, the section modulus is approximately
:&lt;math&gt;
   S \approx 0.35 a h
 &lt;/math&gt;
which is superior to that achieved by rectangular beams and circular beams.

=== Issues ===
Though I-beams are excellent for unidirectional bending in a plane parallel to the web, they do not perform as well in bidirectional bending.  These beams also show little resistance to twisting and undergo sectional warping under torsional loading.  For torsion dominated problems, [[box beam]]s and other types of stiff sections are used in preference to the I-beam.

== Wide-flange steel materials and rolling processes (U.S.) ==
[[File:Rostiger Stahltraeger.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.10|Rusty riveted steel I-beam]]

In the United States, the most commonly mentioned I-beam is the wide-flange (W) shape. These beams have flanges in which the planes are nearly parallel. Other I-beams include American Standard (designated S) shapes, in which flange surfaces are not parallel, and H-piles (designated HP), which are typically used as pile foundations. Wide-flange shapes are available in grade ASTM A992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has generally replaced the older ASTM grades A572 and A36. Ranges of yield strength:
* '''A36:''' {{cvt|36000|psi|MPa|lk=on}}
* '''A572:''' {{cvt|42000|–|60000|psi|MPa}}, with {{cvt|50000|psi|MPa}} the most common
* '''A588:''' Similar to A572
* '''A992:''' {{cvt|50000|-|65000|psi|MPa}}

Like most steel products, I-beams often contain some recycled content.

The [[American Institute of Steel Construction]] (AISC) publishes the Steel Construction Manual for designing structures of various shapes. It documents the common approaches, [[Allowable Stress Design]] (ASD) and [[Limit state design|Load and Resistance Factor Design]] (LRFD), (starting with 13th ed.) to create such designs.

== Designation and terminology ==
[[File:i-BeamCrossSection.svg|thumb|Wide-flange I-beam.]]
* In the '''United States''', steel I-beams are commonly specified using the depth and weight of the beam. For example, a "W10x22" beam is approximately {{Cvt|10|in|cm|0}} in depth (nominal height of the I-beam from the outer face of one flange to the outer face of the other flange) and weighs  {{cvt|22|lb/ft}}. Wide flange section beams often vary from their nominal depth.  In the case of the W14 series, they may be as deep as {{cvt|22.84|in|cm|1}}.&lt;ref&gt;AISC Manual of Steel Construction 14th Edition&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''Canada''', steel I-beams are now commonly specified using the depth and weight of the beam in metric terms. For example, a "W250x33" beam is approximately {{Convert|250|mm|in|1}} in depth (height of the I-beam from the outer face of one flange to the outer face of the other flange) and weighs approximately {{cvt|33|kg/m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |title=Handbook of Steel Construction
 |edition=9th
 |publisher=[[Canadian Institute of Steel Construction]]
 |year=2006
 |isbn=978-0-88811-124-1
}}&lt;/ref&gt; I-beams are still available in U.S. sizes from many Canadian manufacturers.
* In '''Mexico''', steel I-beams are called IR and commonly specified using the depth and weight of the beam in metric terms. For example, a "IR250x33" beam is approximately {{cvt|250|mm|in|1}} in depth (height of the I-beam from the outer face of one flange to the outer face of the other flange) and weighs approximately {{cvt|33|kg/m|lb/ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;IMCA Manual of Steel Construction, 5th Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''India''' I-beams are designated as ISMB, ISJB, ISLB, ISWB. ISMB: Indian Standard Medium Weight Beam, ISJB: Indian Standard Junior Beams, ISLB: Indian Standard Light Weight Beams, and ISWB: Indian Standard Wide Flange Beams. Beams are designated as per respective abbreviated reference followed by the depth of section, such as for example "ISMB 450", where 450 is the depth of section in millimetres (mm). The dimensions of these beams are classified as per IS:808 (as per [[Bureau of Indian Standards|BIS]]).{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}
* In the '''United Kingdom''', these steel sections are commonly specified with a code consisting of the major dimension (usually the depth)-x-the minor dimension-x-the mass per metre-ending with the section type, all measurements being metric. Therefore, a 152x152x23UC would be a column section (UC = universal column) of approximately {{cvt|152|mm|in|1}} depth 152&amp;nbsp;mm width and weighing {{cvt|23|kg/m|0}} of length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corusconstruction.com/file_source/StaticFiles/Construction/Library/BS4Sectionsbrochure.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215100102/http://www.corusconstruction.com/file_source/StaticFiles/Construction/Library/BS4Sectionsbrochure.pdf |archivedate=2010-02-15 |title=Structural sections |publisher=Corus Construction &amp; Industrial |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''Australia''', these steel sections are commonly referred to as Universal Beams (UB) or Columns (UC). The designation for each is given as the approximate height of the beam, the type (beam or column) and then the unit metre rate (e.g., a 460UB67.1 is an approximately {{Cvt|460|mm|in|1}} deep universal beam that weighs {{Cvt|67.1|kg/m|0}}).&lt;ref name=onesteel /&gt;

== Cellular beams ==

Cellular beams are the modern version of the traditional "[[castellated beam]]" which results in a beam approximately 40–60% deeper than its parent section. The exact finished depth, cell diameter and cell spacing are flexible. A cellular beam is up to 1.5 times stronger than its parent section and is therefore utilized to create efficient large span constructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kloecknermetalsuk.com/westok/products/westok-cellular-beam/|title=Cellular Beams - Kloeckner Metals UK|website=kloecknermetalsuk.com|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Immunogenetics''' or '''immungenetics''' is the branch of [[medical genetics]] that explores the relationship between the [[immune system]] and [[genetics]].

Autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, are complex genetic traits which result from defects in the immune system. Identification of genes defining the immune defects may identify new target genes for therapeutic approaches. Alternatively, genetic variations can also help to define the immunological pathway leading to disease.

==Origin==
Its origin is usually attributed to [[Edward Jenner]], who discovered in 1796 that [[cowpox]], or vaccinia, induced protection against human [[smallpox]].
It took two centuries before the [[World Health Organization]] announced in 1979 that smallpox had been [[eradication of smallpox|eradicated]].

The term immunogenetics is based on the two words [[immunology]] and [[genetics]], and is defined as "a sub-category of genetics focussing on the genetic basis of the immune reaction" according to MeSH.
Genetics (based on Greek γενεά ''geneá'' "descent" and γένεσις ''génesis'' "origin") is the science researching the transfer of characteristics from one generation to the next. The genes of an organism (strands of DNA) and the transfer of genes from the parent to the child generation of an organism in the scope of possible variations are the basis of genetics.

Immunology deals with the biological and biochemical basis for the body's defense against germs (such as [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, and [[Mycosis|fungi]]), as well as against foreign agents such as biological toxins and environmental pollutants, and failures and malfunctions of these defence mechanisms. Apart from these external effects on the organism, there are also defence reactions regarding the body's own cells, e.g. in the scope of the bodily reactions on cancer and the lacking reaction of a body on healthy cells in the scope of an immune-mediated disease. Hence, immunology is a sub-category of [[biology]].

The term immunogenetics comprises all processes of an organism, which are, on the one hand, controlled and influenced by the genes of the organism, and are, on the other hand, significant with regard to the immunological defence reactions of the organism.

==History==

The medical history of [[immunology]] and the [[immune system]] dates back to the 19th century. However, the prevention and early defence of diseases was an essential task for all shamans, medicine men and early "doctors" during the entire human evolution. The first Nobel Prize in the field of immunogenetics was awarded to [[Baruj Benacerraf]], [[Jean Dausset]] and [[George Davis Snell]] in 1980 for discovering genetically determined cellular surface structures, which control immunological reactions.

==Current research fields==
In the last 20 years,{{When|date=September 2012}} research activities focussed on a large number of different questions in immunogenetics. Both the acceleration of and the decreasing costs for the sequencing of the genes have resulted in a more intensive research of both academic and commercial working groups. Current research topics particularly deal with forecasts on the course of diseases and therapy recommendations due to genetic dispositions and how these dispositions can be affected by agents (gene therapy).

A special focus is often laid on the forecast regarding and therapy of genetically based [[autoimmune disease]]s, which include all diseases caused by an extreme reaction of the immune system against the body's own tissue. By mistake, the immune system recognises the body's own tissue as a foreign object which is to be fought. This can result in serious inflammatory reactions which may permanently damage the respective organs. Autoimmune diseases, the outbreak and/or course of which can be visible in the individual genome of the organism, include [[multiple sclerosis]], [[diabetes type I]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and [[Crohn's disease]]. As for multiple sclerosis, an article in the journal ''Nature'' dated May 2010 (Baranzini et al.: Genome, epigenome and RNA sequences of [[monozygotic twin]]s discordant for multiple sclerosis. Nature 2010, 464; S. 1351-1356 – for link see below) showed that this autoimmune disease is not caused by a genetic variation but the course and the treatability are considerably influenced by genetic dispositions. This research was based on analysing three monovular pairs of twins, of which one twin has contracted multiple sclerosis whereas the other one has not.

Buchloh]], [[Birgit Pelzer]], and [[Anne Rorimer]].&lt;ref&gt;https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/institutional-critique&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.moca.org/exhibition/1965-1975-reconsidering-the-object-of-art&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutional Critique takes the form of temporary or nontransferable approaches to painting and sculpture, architectural alterations and interventions, and performative gestures and language intended to disrupt the otherwise transparent operations of galleries and museums and the professionals who administer them. Examples would be [[Neile Toroni]] making imprints of a No. 50 brush at 30cm intervals directly onto gallery walls as opposed to applying the same mark to paper or canvas;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.renaissancesociety.org/exhibitions/366/niele-toroni/&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Burden's ''Exposing the Foundation of the Museum'' (1986), in which he made an excavation in a gallery of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, to expose the literal concrete foundation of the building;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.moca.org/collection/work/exposing-the-foundation-of-the-museum&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Andrea Fraser]] inhabiting the persona of an archetypical museum docent in the form of a live performance or video document.&lt;ref&gt;https://thewadsworth.org/threehistoriesfraser/&lt;/ref&gt; Assumptions about the aesthetic autonomy of painting and sculpture, the neutral context of the [[white cube]], and the objective delivery of information are explored as subjects of art, mapped out as discursive formations, and (re)framed within the context of the museum itself. As such, Institutional Critique seeks to make visible the social, political, economic, and historical underpinnings of art. Institutional Critique questions the false distinction between taste and disinterested aesthetic judgement, revealing that taste is an institutionally cultivated sensibility that differs depending on the intersection of any one person's class, ethnic, sexual, or gender subject positions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jrp-ringier.com/pages/index.php?id_r=4&amp;id_t=&amp;id_p=7&amp;id_b=573&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==

Institutional Critique is a practice that emerged from the developments of [[Minimalism]] and its concerns with the phenomenology of the viewer; formalist art criticism and art history (e.g. [[Clement Greenberg]] and [[Michael Fried (art critic)|Michael Fried]]); [[conceptual art]] and its concerns with language, processes, and administrative society; and the critique of authorship that begins with [[Roland Barthes]] and [[Michel Foucault]] in the late 1960s and continues with the advent of [[appropriation art]] in the 1970s and its upending of long-held notions of authorship, originality, artistic production, popular culture, and identity.  Institutional critique is often site-specific and is contemporaneous with the advent of artists who eschewed gallery and museum contexts altogether to build monumental earthworks in the landscape, notably [[Michael Heizer]], [[Nancy Holt]], [[Walter de Maria]], and [[Robert Smithson]]. Institutional critique is also associated with the development of post-structuralist philosophy, [[critical theory]], [[literary theory]], [[feminism]], gender studies, and [[critical race theory]].

== Artists ==

Artists associated with Institutional Critique since the 1960s include [[Marcel Broodthaers]], [[Daniel Buren]], [[Hans Haacke]], [[Michael Asher (artist)|Michael Asher]], [[John Knight (artist)]], [[Christopher D'Arcangelo]], [[Robert Smithson]], [[Dan Graham]], [[Mierle Laderman Ukeles]], [[Adrian Piper]], and [[Martha Rosler]]. Artists active since the 1980s include [[Louise Lawler]], [[Antoni Muntadas]], [[Fred Wilson (artist)|Fred Wilson]], [[Renée Green]], [[Group Material]], [[Andrea Fraser]], [[Fred Forest]], [[Christian Philipp Müller]], [[Aaron Flint Jamison]], and [[Mark Dion]]. 

In the early 1990s, influenced in large part by Daniel Buren, [[Jacques Tati]], [[Roland Barthes]], and the participatory sculptures of [[Felix Gonzalez-Torres]], a loose affiliation of artists including [[Liam Gillick]], [[Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster]], [[Pierre Huyghe]], and [[Rirkrit Tiravanija]] engaged the institution of art in a convivial manner. These artists, gathered under the rubric of [[Relational Aesthetics]] by critic [[Nicholas Bourriaud]], saw galleries and museums as sites of social interaction and the spontaneous creation of works of art characterized by their contingent temporality.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mayrevue.com/en/traffic-espaces-temps-de-lechange/&lt;/ref&gt; The collegial atmosphere of these open-ended situations was quite distinct from the more confrontational strategies of Buren, Haacke, [[Jenny Holzer]], and [[Barbara Kruger]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marginalutility.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Claire-Bishop_Antagonism-and-Relational-Aesthetics.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sachabaumann.com/shes-krafty-diary/2004/2/12/traffic-control-joe-scanlan-on-social-space-and-relational-a.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, [[Maurizio Cattelan]], [[Brian Goeltzenleuchter]], [[Matthieu Laurette]], [[Tameka Norris]], [[Tino Sehgal]], [[Carey Young]], and others have taken a critical eye to the art museum and its role as a public and private institution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thingsthatfall.com/fair-use.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.guggenheim.org/exhibition/maurizio-cattelan-america&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==

One of the criticisms of Institutional Critique is that it requires from its audience a familiarity with its esoteric concerns. As with much contemporary music and dance,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/28/alex-ross-modern-classical-music&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.um.es/vmca/proceedings/docs/35.Inma-Alvarez.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the Institutional Critique of art is a practice that only specialists in the field—artists, theorists, historians, and critics—are privy to. Due to its sophisticated understanding of modern art and society—and as part of a privileged discourse not unlike other specialized forms of knowledge—art as Institutional Critique can often leave [[layman]] viewers alienated and/or marginalized.

Another criticism of the concept is that it can be a misnomer. Artist [[Andrea Fraser]] (in Artforum) and critic Michael Kimmelman (in The New York Times) have argued, for example, that institutional critique artists work within—and benefit from—the very same institutions they ostensibly critique.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marginalutility.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Andrea-Fraser_From-the-Critique-of-Institutions-to-an-Institution-of-Critique.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/25/arts/design/tall-french-visitor-takes-up-residence-in-the-guggenheim.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Allen Paulos''' (born July 4, 1945) is an American professor of [[mathematics]] at [[Temple University]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. He has gained fame as a writer and speaker on mathematics and the importance of [[numeracy|mathematical literacy]]. Paulos writes about many subjects, especially of the dangers of mathematical [[innumeracy]]; that is, the layperson's misconceptions about numbers, probability, and logic.

==Early life==
Paulos was born in [[Denver Colorado]] and grew up in Chicago, [[Illinois]] and [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]. In an interview he described himself as lifelong skeptic.&lt;ref name=Podcast&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet the Skeptics!|url=http://meettheskeptics.libsyn.com/mts-meet-john-allen-paulos|publisher=Christopher Brown|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222062748/http://meettheskeptics.libsyn.com/mts-meet-john-allen-paulos|archivedate=February 22, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went to high school in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]. After his Bachelor of Mathematics at [[University of Wisconsin]] (1967) and his  Master of Science at [[University of Washington]] (1968) he received his [[Ph.D.]] in mathematics from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] (1974). He was also part of the [[Peace Corps]] in the seventies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NNDB|url=http://www.nndb.com/org/786/000041663/|publisher=NNDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

His academic work is mainly in [[mathematical logic]] and [[probability theory]].

His book ''[[Innumeracy (book)|Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and its Consequences]]'' (1988) was a bestseller and ''A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper'' (1995) extended the critique. In his books Paulos discusses [[innumeracy]] with quirky anecdotes, scenarios and facts, encouraging readers in the end to look at their world in a more [[quantitative property|quantitative]] way.

He has also written on other subjects often "combining disparate disciplines", such as the mathematical and philosophical basis of humor in ''Mathematics and Humor'' and ''I Think, Therefore I Laugh'', the [[stock market]] in ''A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market'', quantitative aspects of narrative in ''Once Upon a Number'', the arguments for God in ''Irreligion'', and most recently "bringing mathematics to bear on...biography" in ''A Numerate Life''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Paulos |first=John Allen |interviewer=Jim Stein |title=A Numerate Life: A Mathematician Explores the Vagaries of Life, His Own and Probably Yours |url=http://newbooksinmath.com/2015/11/12/john-allen-paulos-a-numerate-life-prometheus-books-2015/ |date=10 November 2015 |work=New Books in Mathematics |access-date=24 January 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115193717/http://newbooksinmath.com/2015/11/12/john-allen-paulos-a-numerate-life-prometheus-books-2015/ |archivedate=January 15, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paulos also wrote a mathematics-tinged column for the UK newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' and is a [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] fellow (formally known as Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal ([[CSICOP]])).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|url=http://www.csicop.org|publisher=CSI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paulos has appeared frequently on radio and television, including a four-part [[BBC]] adaptation of ''A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper'' and appearances on the [[Lehrer News Hour]], [[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]], [[Larry King]], and [[David Letterman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paulos at David Letterman |url=https://math.temple.edu/~paulos/other.html |publisher=Temple University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010411001818/http://www.math.temple.edu/~paulos/other.html |archivedate=April 11, 2001 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 Paulos taught a course on quantitative literacy for journalists at the Columbia University School of Journalism. The course stimulated further programs at Columbia and elsewhere in precision and data-driven journalism.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

His long-running "[[ABCNews.com]]" monthly column ''Who's Counting''&lt;ref name="Who's Counting"&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/WhosCounting/ Who's Counting] at ABC News&lt;/ref&gt; deals with mathematical aspects of stories in the news. All the columns over a 10- year period are archived here.&lt;ref name="Who's Counting"/&gt;

He is married and the father of two.

==Awards==
Paulos received the 2013 JPBM ([[Joint Policy Board for Mathematics]]) Award for Communicating Mathematics on a Sustained Basis to Large Audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JPBM Award for Communicating Mathematics|url=http://math.mit.edu/mathcomm/archives/john-allen-paulos-to-receive-math-communications-award/|publisher=JPBM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paulos received the 2003 AAAS ([[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]) Award for Promoting the Public Understanding of Science and Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AAAS|url=http://www.aaas.org/aboutaaas/awards/public/public2003.shtml|publisher=AAAS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 he received the University Creativity Award at [[Temple University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University Creativity Award|url=http://www.temple.edu/provost/faculty/awards/research-and-creative.html|publisher=Temple University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paulos' article "Counting on Dyscalculia," which appeared in Discover Magazine in 1994, won a Folio Award that year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discover Magazine|url=http://discovermagazine.com/1994/mar/countingondyscal351#.UqCSc8RDsvw|publisher=Discover Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Land of Legends, ''Centre for Historical-Archaeological Research and Communication''''' (in Danish "Sagnlandet Lejre" and formerly known as Lejre Experimental Centre) is a 106-acre (43 hectare) [[archaeological open-air museum]] situated in the [[Lejre Municipality]], few kilometres west of [[Roskilde]] ([[Denmark]]). 

Land of Legends was founded in 1964 by ethnologist [[Hans-Ole Hansen]] and comprise reconstructions of an [[Nordic Iron Age|Iron Age]] village and sacrificial bog (200 BC to 200 AD), a [[Viking]] market place (900 AD), a [[Nordic Stone Age|Stone Age]] campsite (5000 BC), an 18th-century farmstead and various grave monuments. The historical artisan workshops (the pottery, the weaver's workshop, the smithy) work to reproduce (pre-)historical handicraft. Gardens, pastures and fields are the natural scenario of activities and reconstructions. At the Land of Legends Lejre, the activities for the public utilizes previous techniques, known from historical documents, archaeological evidence or [[experimental archaeology]].

Each summer many families spend a week of their holidays in the Iron Age village, the farm cottages and the Stone Age campsite. They dress in period costume and take on the role of peopling the reconstructed areas, while trying to live using the techniques of the past.

Many archaeologists from all over the world come to the Land of Legends to perform their [[Experimental archaeology|experiments]], dealing with a broad variety of subjects and artifacts. For example, the '''Land of Legends''' has several times supported the experimental work of [[Errett Callahan]], one of the world's most recognised [[flintknappers]].

Around 55,000 tourists and school children visit Lejre each year.

'''Leaf protein concentrate''' ('''LPC''') is a [[concentration|concentrated]] form of the [[protein]]s found in the [[leaf|leaves]] of plants.  It has been examined as a human or animal food source, because it is potentially the cheapest, most abundant source of available protein.  Although humans can derive some protein from the direct consumption of leaves as [[leaf vegetable]]s, the [[human digestive system]] would not be able to deal with the enormous bulk of leaves needed to meet dietary protein requirements with leaf vegetables alone.

==Application==

LPC was first suggested as a human food in the 1960s, but it has not achieved much success, despite early promise. [[Norman Pirie]] (1971, 1975), the [[Copley Medal]] winner from the UK, reviewed and emphasized the importance of its benefits,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smartsheep.org/norman-wingate-pirie-bibliography-norman-wingate-piriebibliogr-index-16|title=Norman Wingate Pirie Bibliography, p.16|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which brought the subject forward. The increasing reliance on [[feedlot]] based animal rearing to satisfy human appetites for meat has increased demand for cheaper vegetable protein sources. This has recently led to renewed interest in LPC to reduce the use of human-edible vegetable protein sources in animal feed.

==Health issues==

Leaf protein is a good source of [[amino acid]]s, with [[methionine]] being a limiting factor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hussein|first=Laila|last2=El-Fouly|first2=Mohamed|last3=El-Baz|first3=F.

==Methods of production==

Generally, LPC is produced by pulping leaves and pressing the juice out, heating the juice to coagulate the protein, and filtering the protein out and drying it.

A '''link budget''' is an accounting of all of the gains and losses from the transmitter, through the medium (free space, cable, waveguide, fiber, etc.) to the receiver in a [[telecommunication]] system. It accounts for the attenuation of 
the transmitted signal due to propagation, as well as the [[antenna gain]]s and [[feedline]] and other losses. Randomly varying channel gains such as [[fading]] are taken into account by adding some margin depending on the anticipated severity of its effects.  The amount of margin required can be reduced by the use of mitigating techniques such as [[antenna diversity]] or [[frequency hopping]].

A simple link budget equation looks like this:

:Received Power ([[decibel|dB]]) = Transmitted Power (dB) + Gains (dB) − Losses (dB)

Note that [[decibels]] are logarithmic measurements, so adding decibels is equivalent to multiplying the actual numeric ratios.

==In radio systems==
For a [[Line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] [[radio]] system, the primary source of loss is the decrease of the signal power due to uniform propagation, proportional to the inverse square of the distance (geometric spreading).

* Transmitting antennas are for the most part neither isotropic (an imaginary class of antenna with uniform radiation in 3 dimensions) nor omnidirectional (a real class of antenna with uniform radiation in 2 dimensions).
* The use of omnidirectional antennas is rare in telecommunication systems, so almost every link budget equation must consider antenna gain.
* Transmitting antennas typically concentrate the signal power in a favoured direction, normally that in which the receiving antenna is placed.
* Transmitter power is effectively increased (in the direction of highest antenna gain). This systemic gain is expressed by including the antenna gain in the link budget.
* The receiving antenna is also typically directional, and when properly oriented collects more power than an isotropic antenna would; as a consequence, the receiving antenna gain (in decibels from isotropic, dBi) adds to the received power.
* The antenna gains (transmitting or receiving) are scaled by the wavelength of the radiation in question. This step may not be required if adequate systemic link budgets are achieved.

===Simplifications needed===
Often link budget equations are messy and complex, so standard practices have evolved to simplify the [[Friis transmission equation]] into the link budget equation.  It includes the transmit and receive antenna gain, the [[Free-space path loss|free space path loss]] and additional losses and gains, assuming line of sight between the transmitter and receiver.

* The wavelength (or frequency) term is part of the free space loss part of the link budget.
* The distance term is also considered in the free space loss.

===Transmission line and polarization loss===
In practical situations (Deep Space Telecommunications, Weak signal DXing etc. ...) other sources of signal loss must also be accounted for
* The transmitting and receiving antennas may be partially cross-polarized.
* The cabling between the radios and antennas may introduce significant additional loss.
* [[Fresnel zone]] losses due to a partially obstructed line of sight path.
* [[Doppler shift]] induced signal power losses in the receiver.

===Endgame===
If the estimated received power is sufficiently large (typically relative to the  [[Sensitivity (electronics)|receiver sensitivity]]), which may be dependent on the communications protocol in use, the link will be useful for sending data.  The amount by which the received power exceeds receiver sensitivity is called the [[Fade margin|link margin]].

=== Equation ===
A link budget equation including all these effects, expressed logarithmically, might look like this:

:&lt;math&gt;
  P_{RX} = P_{TX} + G_{TX} - L_{TX} - L_{FS} - L_M + G_{RX} - L_{RX} \,
 &lt;/math&gt;
where:
:&lt;math&gt;P_{RX}&lt;/math&gt; = received power (dBm)
:&lt;math&gt;P_{TX}&lt;/math&gt; = transmitter output power (dBm) 
:&lt;math&gt;G_{TX}&lt;/math&gt; = transmitter [[antenna gain]] (dBi)
:&lt;math&gt;L_{TX}&lt;/math&gt; = transmitter losses (coax, connectors...) (dB) 
:&lt;math&gt;L_{FS}&lt;/math&gt; = [[path loss]], usually [[free space loss]] (dB)
:&lt;math&gt;L_M&lt;/math&gt;  = miscellaneous losses ([[fading]] margin, body loss, polarization mismatch, other losses...) (dB)
:&lt;math&gt;G_{RX}&lt;/math&gt; = receiver [[antenna gain]] (dBi)
:&lt;math&gt;L_{RX}&lt;/math&gt; = receiver losses (coax, connectors...)  (dB)

The loss due to propagation between the transmitting and receiving antennas, often called the path loss, can be written in dimensionless form by normalizing the distance to the wavelength:

:&lt;math&gt;L_{FS}\text{(dB)}=20\log_{10}\left(4\pi{\text{distance}\over\text{wavelength}}\right)&lt;/math&gt; (where distance and wavelength are in the same units)

When substituted into the link budget equation above, the result is the logarithmic form of the [[Friis transmission equation]].

In some cases, it is convenient to consider the loss due to distance and wavelength separately, but in that case, it is important to keep track of which units are being used, as each choice involves a differing constant offset.  Some examples are provided below.

:&lt;math&gt;L_{FS}&lt;/math&gt; (dB) =   32.45 dB + 20×log[frequency(MHz)] + 20×log[distance(km)] [https://web.archive.org/web/20050901001655/http://people.deas.harvard.edu/~jones/es151/prop_models/propagation.html]

:&lt;math&gt;L_{FS}&lt;/math&gt; (dB) = - 27.55 dB + 20×log[frequency(MHz)] + 20×log[distance(m)]

:&lt;math&gt;L_{FS}&lt;/math&gt; (dB) =   36.6 dB  + 20×log[frequency(MHz)] + 20×log[distance(miles)]

These alternative forms can be derived by substituting wavelength with the ratio of propagation velocity (c, approximately 3×10^8&amp;nbsp;m/s) divided by frequency, and by inserting the proper conversion factors between km or miles and meters, and between MHz and (1/sec).

==Non-line-of-sight radio==
Because of building obstructions such as walls and ceilings, propagation losses indoors can be significantly higher. This occurs because of a combination of attenuation by walls and ceilings, and blockage due to equipment, furniture, and even people.

* For example, a “2 x 4” wood stud wall with [[drywall]] on both sides results in about 6&amp;nbsp;dB loss per wall.
* Older buildings may have even greater internal losses than new buildings due to materials and line of sight issues.

Experience has shown that line-of-sight propagation holds only for about the first 3 meters. Beyond 3 meters propagation losses indoors can increase at up to 30&amp;nbsp;dB per 30 meters in dense office environments.

This is a good “rule-of-thumb”, in that it is conservative (it overstates path loss in most cases). Actual propagation losses may vary significantly depending on
building construction and layout.

The attenuation of the signal is highly dependent on the frequency of the signal.

== In waveguides and cables ==
Guided media such as coaxial and twisted pair electrical cable, radio frequency waveguide and optical fiber have losses that are exponential with distance.

The [[path loss]] will be in terms of dB per unit distance.

This means that there is always a crossover  distance beyond which the loss in a guided medium will exceed that of a line-of-sight path of the same
length.

Long distance [[fiber-optic communication]] became practical only with the development of ultra-transparent glass fibers. A typical path loss for
[[single mode fiber]] is 0.2&amp;nbsp;dB/km, 
[http://www.corningcablesystems.com/web/library/litindex.nsf/$ALL/EVO-412-EN/$FILE/EVO-412-EN.pdf]
far lower than any other guided medium.

== Examples ==

=== Earth–Moon–Earth communications ===
Link budgets are important in [[EME (communications)|Earth–Moon–Earth communications]]. As the [[albedo]] of the Moon is very low (maximally 12% but usually closer to 7%), and the [[path loss]] over the [[1 E8 m|770,000 kilometre]] return distance is extreme (around 250 to 310 [[Decibel|dB]] depending on VHF-UHF band used, [[modulation]] format and [[Doppler shift]] effects), high power (more than 100 watts) and [[high-gain antenna]]s (more than 20&amp;nbsp;dB) must be used. 
* In practice, this limits the use of this technique to the spectrum at [[VHF]] and above.
* The Moon must be above the horizon in order for EME communications to be possible.

=== Voyager Program ===
The [[Voyager Program]] spacecraft have the highest known path loss (-308 dB as of 2002&lt;ref name=descanso&gt;
{{cite web|author=JPL Deep Space Communications and Navigation Systems |url=https://descanso.jpl.nasa.gov/DPSummary/Descanso4--Voyager_ed.pdf |title=Voyager Telecommunications |publisher=descanso.jpl.nasa.gov|date=March 2002 |page=26|accessdate=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and lowest link budgets of any telecommunications circuit. The [[Deep Space Network]] has been able to maintain the link at a higher than expected bitrate through a series of improvements, such as increasing the antenna size from 64m to 70m for a 1.2 dB gain, and upgrading to low noise electronics for a 0.5 dB gain in 2000/2001. During the Neptune flyby, in addition to the 70-m antenna, two 34-m antennas and twenty-seven 25-m antennas were used to increase the gain by 5.6 dB, providing additional link margin to be used for a 4x increase in bitrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=JPL Deep Space Communications and Navigation Systems |url=https://descanso.jpl.nasa.gov/DPSummary/Descanso4--Voyager_ed.pdf |title=Voyager Telecommunications |publisher=descanso.jpl.nasa.gov|date=March 2002 |page=35|accessdate=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7273">The subject of [[language learning]] is subject to several misconceptions. It is common for people to rely on their own intuitions about language learning, though they would not do so with other technical subjects such as [[physics]] (a phenomenon known as ''[[folk linguistics]]'').{{sfn|Dicker|2003|p=85|ps=: ''People would never pontificate about a physics issue, because they would acknowledge that you need to consult an expert. But they wouldn't hesitate to pontificate about language.''&lt;!--Although quoted in a chapter talking about the American public, this citation is clearly used to specifically talk about people in general and is in addition a citation from a different work (Fox, 1999), so it is specifically applicable to the general public worldwide. In addition, the physics example is not anecdotal but on the contrary a concrete example of another science that is as rigorous as linguistics but whose subject and contents is treated very differently by the general public.--&gt;}} However, these intuitions are often contradicted by scientific research.{{sfn|McLaughlin|1992}}

== Childhood language acquisition ==

=== Children learn their first language effortlessly ===

Learning a first language is not rapid for children. Children spend years learning their [[Mother-tongue|mother tongue]], and the process continues well into their school years. At seven years old, for example, many children have difficulties creating [[Passive voice|passive-voice]] sentences.{{sfn|Dicker|2003|pp=86–87}}

== Second-language acquisition ==

=== Younger learners learn languages more easily than older learners ===

It is often assumed that young children learn languages more easily than adolescents and adults.{{sfn|McLaughlin|1992}}{{sfn|Dicker|2003|pp=88–92}} However, the reverse is true; older learners are faster. The only exception to this rule is in [[pronunciation]]. Young children invariably learn to speak their second language with native-like pronunciation, whereas learners who start learning a language at an older age only rarely reach a native-like level.{{sfn|Dicker|2003|pp=88–92}}

=== Intelligent people are better at learning languages ===

[[General intelligence]] is actually quite a poor indicator of language-learning ability. [[Motivation in second-language learning|Motivation]], tolerance for ambiguity, and [[self-esteem]] are all better indicators of language-learning success.{{sfn|Johnson|2008|p=64}}

=== Immersion is the best way to learn a language ===

The ability for learners to develop their language skills depends to a large extent on the type of language input that they receive. For input to be effective for second-language acquisition, it must be comprehensible. Merely being immersed in a second-language environment is no guarantee of receiving comprehensible input. For example, learners living in a country where their second language is spoken may be lucky enough to interact with native speakers who can alter their speech to make it comprehensible; but equally, many learners will not have that same luck, and may not understand the vast majority of the input that they receive.{{sfn|Dicker|2003|pp=92–97}}

In addition, adult learners living in a foreign country may not have very high linguistic demands placed on them, for example if they are a low-level employee at a company. Without the incentive to develop high-level skills in their second language, learners may undergo ''[[language fossilisation]]'', or a plateau in their language level.{{sfn|Dicker|2003|pp=92–97}}

Classroom instruction can be useful in both providing appropriate input for second-language learners, and for helping them overcome problems of fossilisation.{{sfn|Dicker|2003|pp=92–97}}

=== Grammar study is detrimental to second-language acquisition ===

The study of [[grammar]] is helpful for second-language learners, and a lack of grammar knowledge can slow down the language-learning process. On the other hand, relying on grammar instruction as the primary means of learning the language is also detrimental. A balance between these two extremes is necessary for optimal language learning.{{sfn|Johnson|p=67}}

== Bilingual education ==

=== Learning a second language hinders the development of the first language ===

Learners can learn two or more languages without their first language development being adversely affected. There is no such thing as a "fixed amount of space" for languages in the brain. In reality, learners' first languages and their additional languages become part of an integrated system.{{sfn|Matthews|2006|p=16}}

=== Once a child can speak a language, the language-learning process is complete ===

Learning to speak a language [[conversation]]ally is only part of the way towards becoming [[Fluency|fluent]] in it. Just because a child can speak a language does not mean that they are yet capable of [[writing]] and understanding [[academic]] language. This kind of language is particularly important in school in the later grades. One study of 1,200 Canadian schoolchildren indicated that it may take between five and seven years longer to master academic language than to master conversational language.{{sfn|McLaughlin|1992}}

'''Morphogenesis''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''morphê'' shape and ''genesis'' creation, literally, "beginning of the shape") is the [[biological process]] that causes an [[organism]] to develop its shape. It is one of three fundamental aspects of [[developmental biology]] along with the control of [[cell growth]] and [[cellular differentiation]], unified in [[evolutionary developmental biology]] (evo-devo).

The process controls the organized spatial distribution of cells during the [[Developmental biology|embryonic development]] of an [[organism]]. Morphogenesis can take place also in a mature organism, in [[cell culture]] or inside [[tumor cell]] masses. Morphogenesis also describes the development of [[unicellular]] life forms that do not have an embryonic stage in their life cycle, or describes the [[evolution]] of a body structure within a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic group]].

Morphogenetic responses may be induced in organisms by [[hormone]]s, by environmental chemicals ranging from substances produced by other organisms to [[toxin|toxic chemicals]] or [[radioactive isotope|radionuclides]] released as pollutants, and other plants, or by mechanical stresses induced by spatial patterning of the cells.

==History==
{{further|evolutionary developmental biology#History}}

Some of the earliest ideas and mathematical descriptions on how physical processes and constraints affect biological growth, and hence [[natural patterns]] such as the [[spirals]] of [[phyllotaxis]], were written by [[D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson]] in his 1917 book ''[[On Growth and Form]]''&lt;ref name=Thompson1917&gt;{{cite book |year=1917 |author=Thompson, D'Arcy Wentworth |title=On Growth and Form |url=https://archive.org/stream/ongrowthform1917thom#page/n7/mode/2up |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Montell2008&gt;{{citation |date=5 December 2008 |author=Montell, Denise J |title=Morphogenetic Cell Movements: Diversity from Modular Mechanical Properties |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=322 |pages=1502–1505 |url=http://irb.chu-montpellier.fr/fr/PDF/DU2009-I/15-12-2008_Introduction_Publi_2.pdf |bibcode=2008Sci...322.1502M |doi=10.1126/science.1164073 |pmid=19056976}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|a|a|none}} and [[Alan Turing]] in his ''[[The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis]]'' (1952).&lt;ref name=Turing&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Turing | first= A. M. | title=The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis | journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] | volume=237 | pages=37–72 | year=1952 | doi=10.1098/rstb.1952.0012| issue=641| ref=harv |bibcode=1952RSPTB.237...37T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where Thompson explained animal body shapes as being created by varying rates of growth in different directions, for instance to create the [[Gastropod shell|spiral shell]] of a [[snail]], Turing correctly predicted a mechanism of morphogenesis, the diffusion of two different chemical signals, one activating and one deactivating growth, to set up patterns of development, decades before the formation of such patterns was observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hiscock |first1=Tom W. |last2=Megason |first2=Sean G. |title=Orientation of Turing-like Patterns by Morphogen Gradients and Tissue Anisotropies |journal=Cell Systems |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=6 |pages=408–416 |doi=10.1016/j.cels.2015.12.001 |url=http://www.cell.com/cell-systems/abstract/S2405-4712(15)00215-X|pmc=4707970 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fuller understanding of the mechanisms involved in actual organisms required the discovery of the structure of [[DNA]] in 1953, and the development of [[molecular biology]] and [[biochemistry]].

==Genetic and molecular basis==
[[File:Gap gene expression.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Evolutionary developmental biology|Morphogenesis is controlled]] by a [[evo-devo gene toolkit|"toolkit" of genes]] which switch development on and off at precise times and places. Here, [[gap gene]]s in the fruit fly are switched on by genes such as ''[[bicoid]]'', setting up stripes which create the body's segmental form.]]
{{further|evolutionary developmental biology|transcription factor|gene regulatory network}}

Several types of molecules are important in morphogenesis. [[Morphogen]]s are soluble molecules that can diffuse and carry signals that control cell differentiation via concentration gradients. Morphogens typically act through binding to specific protein [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s. An important class of molecules involved in morphogenesis are [[transcription factor]] proteins that determine the fate of cells by interacting with [[DNA]]. These can be coded for by master regulatory [[gene]]s, and either activate or deactivate the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of other genes; in turn, these secondary gene products can regulate the expression of still other genes in a regulatory cascade of [[gene regulatory network]]s. At the end of this cascade are classes of molecules that control cellular behaviors such as [[cell migration]], or, more generally, their properties, such as [[cell adhesion]] or cell contractility. For example, during [[gastrulation]], clumps of [[stem cell]]s switch off their cell-to-cell adhesion, become migratory, and take up new positions within an embryo where they again activate specific cell adhesion proteins and form new tissues and organs. Developmental signaling pathways implicated in morphogenesis include Wnt, [[Hedgehog signaling pathway|Hedgehog]], and ephrins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kouros-Mehr |first=H. |author2=Werb, Z.|title=Candidate regulators of mammary branching morphogenesis identified by genome-wide transcript analysis |journal=Dev. Dyn. |year=2006 |volume=235 |issue=12 |pages=3404–12 |pmid=17039550 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dvdy.20978/abstract;jsessionid=D75C4FD14C482BF9B054F966403A15B4.d03t02 |doi=10.1002/dvdy.20978 |pmc=2730892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cellular basis==

[[File:P19 cell sorting out.png|thumb|upright|Cell sorting out with cultured [[P19 cell|P19 embryonal carcinoma cells]]. Live cells were stained with [[DiI]] (red) or DiO (green). The red cells were [[Genetic engineering|genetically altered]] and express higher levels of [[E-cadherin]] than the green cells. The mixed culture forms large multi-cellular aggregates.]]

At a tissue level, ignoring the means of control, morphogenesis arises because of cellular proliferation and motility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Montévil |first=Maël|last2=Speroni |first2=Lucia |last3=Sonnenschein |first3=Carlos |last4=Soto |first4=Ana M. |date=2016 |title=Modeling mammary organogenesis from biological first principles: Cells and their physical constraints|url=https://www.academia.edu/27958448/Modeling_mammary_organogenesis_from_biological_first_principles_cells_and_their_physical_constraints|journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology |series=From the Century of the Genome to the Century of the Organism: New Theoretical Approaches |volume=122 |issue=1 |pages=58–69 |doi=10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2016.08.004 |pmid=27544910|pmc=5563449 |arxiv=1702.03337 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Morphogenesis also involves changes in the cellular structure or how cells interact in tissues. These changes can result in tissue elongation, thinning, folding, invasion or separation of one tissue into distinct layers. The latter case is often referred as [[cell sorting]]. Cell "sorting out" consists of cells moving so as to sort into clusters that maximize contact between cells of the same type. The ability of cells to do this has been proposed to arise from differential cell adhesion by [[Malcolm Steinberg]] through his [[Differential Adhesion Hypothesis]]. Tissue separation can also occur via more dramatic [[cellular differentiation]] events during which epithelial cells become mesenchymal (see [[Epithelial-mesenchymal transition]]). Mesenchymal cells typically leave the epithelial tissue as a consequence of changes in cell adhesive and contractile properties. Following epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cells can migrate away from an epithelium and then associate with other similar cells in a new location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gilbert, Scott F. |title=Developmental biology |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland, Mass |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=0-87893-243-7 |edition=6th |chapter=Morphogenesis and Cell Adhesion |chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=morphogenesis&amp;rid=dbio.section.372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cell-cell adhesion===
During embryonic development, cells are restricted to different layers due to differential affinities. One of the ways this can occur is when cells share the same cell-to-cell [[adhesion]] molecules. For instance, homotypic cell adhesion can maintain boundaries between groups of cells that have different adhesion molecules. Furthermore, cells can sort based upon differences in adhesion between the cells, so even two populations of cells with different levels of the same adhesion molecule can sort out. In [[cell culture]] cells that have the strongest adhesion move to the center of a mixed aggregates of cells. Moreover, cell-cell adhesion is often modulated by cell contractility, which can exert forces on the cell-cell contacts so that two cell populations with equal levels of the same adhesion molecule can sort out. The molecules responsible for adhesion are called cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). Several types of cell adhesion molecules are known and one major class of these molecules are [[cadherins]]. There are dozens of different cadherins that are expressed on different cell types. Cadherins bind to other cadherins in a like-to-like manner: E-cadherin (found on many epithelial cells) binds preferentially to other E-cadherin molecules. Mesenchymal cells usually express other cadherin types such as N-cadherin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hulpiau, P.; van Roy, F. |title=Molecular evolution of the cadherin superfamily |journal=Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=349–69 |date=February 2009 |pmid=18848899 |doi=10.1016/j.biocel.2008.09.027}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Angst, B.; Marcozzi, C.; Magee, A. |title=The cadherin superfamily: diversity in form and function |journal=J Cell Sci |volume=114 |issue=Pt 4 |pages=629–41 |date=February 2001 |pmid=11171368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extracellular matrix===
The [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM) is involved in keeping tissues separated, providing structural support or providing a structure for cells to migrate on. [[Collagen]], [[laminin]], and [[fibronectin]] are major ECM molecules that are secreted and assembled into sheets, fibers, and gels. Multisubunit transmembrane receptors called [[integrin]]s are used to bind to the ECM. Integrins bind extracellularly to fibronectin, laminin, or other ECM components, and intracellularly to [[microfilament]]-binding proteins [[ACTN1|α-actinin]] and [[talin (protein)|talin]] to link the [[cytoskeleton]] with the outside. Integrins also serve as receptors to trigger [[signal transduction]] cascades when binding to the ECM. A well-studied example of morphogenesis that involves ECM is [[mammary gland]] ductal branching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fata JE, Werb Z, Bissell MJ |title=Regulation of mammary gland branching morphogenesis by the extracellular matrix and its remodeling enzymes |journal=Breast Cancer Res. |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=1–11 |year=2004 |pmid=14680479 |pmc=314442 |doi=10.1186/bcr634 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sternlicht MD |title=Key stages in mammary gland development: the cues that regulate ductal branching morphogenesis |journal=Breast Cancer Res. |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=201 |year=2006 |pmid=16524451 |pmc=1413974 |doi=10.1186/bcr1368 |url=http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/8/1/201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cell contractility===
Tissues can change their shape and separate into distinct layers via cell contractility. Just as in muscle cells, [[myosin]] can contract different parts of the cytoplasm to change its shape or structure. Myosin-driven contractility in embryonic tissue morphogenesis is seen during the separation of [[germ layers]] in the [[model organism]]s ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'', ''[[Drosophila]]'' and [[zebrafish]]. There are often periodic pulses of contraction in embryonic morphogenesis. A model called the cell state splitter involves alternating cell contraction and expansion, initiated by a bistable organelle at the apical end of each cell. The organelle consists of [[microtubules]] and [[microfilaments]] in mechanical opposition. It responds to local mechanical perturbations caused by morphogenetic movements. These then trigger traveling [[embryonic differentiation waves]] of contraction or expansion over presumptive tissues that determine cell type and is followed by cell differentiation. The cell state splitter was first proposed to explain [[neural plate]] morphogenesis during [[gastrulation]] of the [[axolotl]]&lt;ref&gt;Gordon R, Brodland GW. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02797122 The cytoskeletal mechanics of brain morphogenesis. Cell state splitters cause primary neural induction.] Cell Biophys. 1987 Dec;11:177-238.&lt;/ref&gt; and the model was later generalized to all of morphogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, NK,Gordon,R.

==Cancer morphogenesis==
[[Cancer]] can result from disruption of normal morphogenesis, including both tumor formation and tumor [[metastasis]].&lt;ref name="pmid18988924"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Fosslien E | title=Cancer morphogenesis: role of mitochondrial failure | journal= [[Annals of Clinical &amp; Laboratory Science]] | volume=38 | issue=4 | pages=307–329 | year=2008 | url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/46f0/82429de96d81a47589aa0c84b3ad68517cbd.pdf  | PMID = 18988924 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mitochondrion|Mitochondrial]] dysfunction can result in increased cancer risk due to disturbed morphogen signaling.&lt;ref name="pmid18988924" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39361">'''Museum integrated pest management''' is the practice of monitoring  and managing [[Pest (organism)|pest]] and [[Natural environment|environmental]] information with [[pest control]] methods to prevent pest damage to [[Collection (artwork)|collections]] and [[cultural heritage]]. Preserving cultural heritage is the ultimate goal for most museum collection personnel. Museum pests come in many different forms: insects, mites, rodents, bats, birds, and fungi&lt;ref name="Retz Monroe"&gt;{{cite web|last=Monroe|first=Retz|title=Integrated Preventative Pest Management|url=http://sustainingplaces.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ippm-pest-control-paper.pdf|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the two most common types are insects and fungi.&lt;ref name="(American Museum of natural History, IPM)"&gt;{{cite web|last=American Museum of natural History|title=(American Museum of natural History, IPM)|url=http://collections.paleo.amnh.org/8/integrated-pest-management|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely recommended that every museum have some form of pest control in place and monitoring system to protect their collection and that museums review their storage and museum facilities to determine how to best control and prevent pest infestations while utilizing an Integrated Pest Management plan.

==Integrated Pest Management components==
Museum IPM is a sub specialty of [[Integrated pest management]] that focuses specifically on the application in museums and cultural institutions. The primary difference between IPM and Museum IPM is that in the context of a museum, the main focus is placed on the protection of [[Collection (artwork)|collections]] from pests.

Integrated Pest Management is a ‘holistic’ approach to controlling pests” that seeks to understand what pests are attracted to, their habits, and life cycles.&lt;ref name="Missouri Secretary of State"&gt;{{cite web|last=Missouri Secretary of State|title=Integrated Pest Management|url=http://www.sos.mo.gov/archives/localrecs/conservation/notes/pestmanagement.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of this program is to identify what types of pests are located in the building, establish the museum's short- and long-term goals for their IPM program, and build a consensus amongst the staff.&lt;ref name="11 steps process"&gt;{{cite web|last=national parks|title=11 steps process|url=http://www.nature.nps.gov/biology/ipm/Documents/11StepIPMCard111406FrontBack.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum should “consult experts if necessary and choose the most appropriate and safe control methods for (the) eradication” of the pests.&lt;ref name="NPS - Harpers Ferry Center"&gt;{{cite web|last=National Parks|title=NPS - Harpers Ferry Center|url=http://www.nps.gov/hfc/products/cons/con-faq2.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important not to panic and rush to rash decisions if a few pests are discovered. A museum should be thoughtful and plan out of their steps before taking any action.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)"&gt;{{cite web|last=national parks|title=(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)|url=http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/CHAP5.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Integrated Pest Management requires the museum to allocate time and energy for the implementation and monitoring the progress of their program. An IPM program “will require the coordinated effort of all staff members to properly implement, and may initially be more expensive than traditional pest management”.&lt;ref name="(Smithsonian- Integrated Pest Management check list)"&gt;{{cite web|last=Smithsonian|title=(Smithsonian- Integrated Pest Management check list)|url=http://www.si.edu/mci/downloads/articles/pests9.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implementation===
The implementation of integrated pest management should be done in steps. To begin, a museum should review a floor plan of the building and determine all “doors, windows, water and heat sources, and drains”, as well as all furniture and other objects within the museum.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt; The museum can place traps that have been numbered and dated throughout the building using the floor plan as a guide of potential problem areas. The location of the traps should be documented and marked on the floor plan. Once the traps are in place, they should be monitored. Detailed notes should be made on the finding in the traps, which pests are being trapped, how they are accessing the museum, and what do these trapped pests look for in a food source. After the first few months, the trap placement should be refined to insure the best outcome.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt;

===Isolation and quarantine of any infested cultural objects===
Before any new items or objects enter the collection storage area, the contents should be inspected for any signs of insect activity.&lt;ref name="Missouri Secretary of State" /&gt; If an object is found, or even thought to be infested, it should be immediately isolated and put into quarantine. The museum should next look to identify the pest and determine what type of harm the pests can cause.&lt;ref name="NPS - Harpers Ferry Center" /&gt; Infested objects should be place into sealed plastic bags before moving them into the collection area. It is important to secure the object and make sure that no other eggs or larvae fall from the object and possibly spread the infestation.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt; The objects around the quarantined object should also be examined to determine the extent of the infestation.

===Monitoring and Inspection===
The museum must monitor all of their pest management programs to ensure they are effective. Routine monitoring will provide information about the points of entry, amount of insects, where they reside in the building, and what they are feeding on.&lt;ref name="(Northeast document conservation center) Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management"&gt;{{cite web|last=(Northeast document conservation|title=(Northeast document conservation center) Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management|url=http://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/3.-emergency-management/3.10-integrated-pest-management}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this information, a museum will be able to identify the damaged areas and what pests are infesting the museum. The staff should be careful in the placement of these traps to ensure that they do not come into contact with objects from the collection.&lt;ref name="(Northeast document conservation center) Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management"&gt;{{cite web|last=(Northeast document conservation center) Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management|title=(Northeast document conservation center) Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management|url=http://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/3.-emergency-management/3.10-integrated-pest-management}}&lt;/ref&gt; When traps are placed in a new location in the building they should be checked within the first 48 hours. This will help confirm where the problem areas are located and if adjustments need to be made to the trap locations. The next step should be weekly and then monthly inspections. Once the pests have been identified and the best location confirmed, then the traps should be changed every two months, or sooner if they are full or have lost their stickiness.&lt;ref name="Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management"&gt;{{cite web|last=Northeast document conservation center|title=Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management|url=http://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/3.-emergency-management/3.10-integrated-pest-management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the staff conducts their insect monitoring, the staff member “should use a bright flashlight during inspections, looking for live adults and larvae and the presence of shed larval skins or feces”.&lt;ref name="http://www.nature.nps.gov/biology/ipm/manual/museum.cfm"&gt;{{cite web|last=National Parks|title=IPM manual|url=http://www.nature.nps.gov/biology/ipm/manual/museum.cfm|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important for the museum staff to continually review all components of the pest management program and determine if adjustments are needed.

===Identification and documentation===
A key component in Integrated Pest Management for museums is the ability to identify the pests causing issues so the museum staff can establish a plan of attack to remove the pest from the building. Traps can be used to identify the pests, the extent of infestation, and determine the source of the infestation.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt; All of the identification information on the pests should be documented to keep track of the pests, points of entry, and potential damage the pest may cause. Having these “records of inspection results...will help identify seasonal risk factors and areas with a high frequency of problems”.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual"&gt;{{cite web|last=National Parks Services|title=National Parks Services-IPM manual|url=http://www.nature.nps.gov/biology/ipm/manual/museum.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum should review the data and ask “can we simply remove the pest? are eggs present? what is the least damaging approach to treatment?”.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt; Once a museum have this information written down and confirmed by all those involved in the program, a treatment strategy can be planned and implemented.

===Treatment action===
* '''Traps''': Traps are an important part of Integrated Pest Management and they come in different shapes, sizes, and odors.&lt;ref name="AIC 41st"&gt;{{cite web|last=AIC|title=AIC - Integrated Pest Management|url=http://www.conservators-converse.org/2013/06/41st-annual-meeting-workshop-integrated-pest-management-for-collections/|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traps will help to identify the museums pest problem, and should be periodically emptied as the dead pests will attract and be food for other pests.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt; Before any treatment action is executed, it is important to consult the curator, the conservator, and review any history on the object affected.
* '''Sticky traps''': The most common traps are sticky traps or glue boards. These traps should be placed in high risk areas and will provide the museum’s staff insight into the pests that are infesting the building and “can be used to give information on the pest, an indication of their number and seasonal cycles and where they congregate … (the best place these trap are) … in corners, near doors, vents, fireplaces and other potential entry points for insects”.&lt;ref name="Retz Monroe" /&gt; Sticky traps should be inspected weekly and all findings clearly reported.
* '''Pheromone traps''': Pheromone traps have natural scents that attract a target pest group. These traps can serve as an effective warning system, and are typically also deployed with/as sticky traps. Currently pheromone traps are only available for “[[webbing clothes moth]]s, [[drug store beetle]]s, [[cigarette beetle]]s, and the [[German cockroach]], but more are being developed”.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt;
* '''Light traps''': Light Traps emit ultraviolet light to attract moths and flies. Most insects are drawn towards light, but these traps should not be used on their own.&lt;ref name="(Northeast document conservation center) Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management" /&gt; Other traps, usually sticky traps, should be installed near light traps to help encourage and trap more pests.
* '''Chemical control of museum pests''': Pesticides should only be used as a last resort as “pesticides used in museum pest control are generally some of the same products used for household or other structural pest control”.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt; These chemicals can be damaging to the health to the staff and to anyone else that visits the building. Chemicals “can cause acute symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and breathing difficulty”.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt; Chemicals can also cause damage to the museum’s collection such as metal corrosion, deterioration of proteins (fur, feather, leather, and wool), deterioration of paper, stiffening/softening of plastic and change the pigments.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt; Pesticides will do notthing to prevent the infestation, they only kill the pests after the fact, once the damage has already been done. Museum objects should avoid direct treatment, however, if the object requires pesticides to remove pests it should be fumigated. All fumigation should be performed by a professional.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt;

==Common museum pests==
There are many different type of [[Pest (organism)|pests]] that can affect a museum and its collection. It will be important for the museum staff to identify the pests, as well as understand how they will act and what they will feed on. Insects will cause damage not only through their feeding habits but their tracks, tunnel and nesting habits may also cause damage. Most damage will occur when the insect is in its larva stage – when most of the feeding takes place – though some insects like booklice will continue to damage objects past the larva stage.&lt;ref name="Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management" /&gt; Rodents can cause further damage through the increased risk of fire when they gnaw on wires.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt;

===[[Insects]]===
* '''Fabric pests''': There are two groups of Fabric pests that are common in museums: carpet beetles and clothes moths. These pest eat proteins like [[wool]], [[fur]], [[feathers]], dead animals and [[horn (anatomy)|horns]].&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt; These pests are known to burrow into materials such as storage bins or little used drawers.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt;
* '''Wood pests''': The most common wood pests are the wood boring beetle and the dry wood termites. These pest are known to attack and damage objects made of wood and often go undetected on the surface as they burrow into the wood.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt;
* '''Stored product pests''': The most common stored product pests or pantry pests are the cigarette beetle and the drugstore beetle. These pests are known to infest “[[seeds]], [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[Food grain|grain]]s, [[spices]], [[dried fruits]], and [[vegetables]]," items which many museums include.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt;
* '''Moisture pests''': Moisture can be damaging not only to the building but also to the objects in the collection that “may attract a number of moisture-loving pests that can do additional damage”.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt; [[Mold]] is damaging on its own but it also attracts pests like [[Psocoptera]] to feed on the objects that are affected by mold. It is important for museums to keep their facilities and collection areas free from any dampness and immediately deal with leaks or possible water damage.
* '''General pests''': General pests are any household pests that enter into a building through [[window]]s, [[door]]s, cracks, and any other entrance to the museum. These pest include [[cockroaches]], [[rodents]], [[silverfish]], and [[ants]] and will cause damage to the museum and their objects. The most common damage occurs from the [[nest]]ing and feeding behaviors.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt;

===Rodents===
It will become apparent if your museum has a rodent infestation as the pests leave behind droppings and gnaw marks. [[Rodents]] will breed rapidly and begin shredding and nest in objects they come into contact with. It is important to note that rodents “will not discriminate between valuable objects, packing or rubbish”.&lt;ref name="Museums, Libraries, Archives-Integrated pest management: A guide for museums, libraries and archives"&gt;{{cite web|last=David Pinniger &amp; Peter Winsor|title=Integrated pest management: A guide for museums, libraries and archives|url=http://formacaompr.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/ipm_guide-pestes.pdf|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to never use rodent bait, because “poisoned  rodents often crawl away and die in unreachable areas such as between walls and under furniture, and their carcasses provide food for other pests”.&lt;ref name="Missouri Secretary of State" /&gt; Traps should be used to remove rodents from the museum in a more humane manner that will prevent the rodents from attracting more pests or causing larger problems.

===Birds===
[[Birds]] can cause damage to the exterior of the museum when they roost or nest on “windowsills, ledger, and other architectural features”.&lt;ref name="Museums, Libraries, Archives-Integrated pest management: A guide for museums, libraries and archives" /&gt; Bird droppings can cause staining and damage to the building and any fabric attached to the building. Museum staff will also need to be careful when they are around birds and items infested by birds as they can “pose a health hazard to humans … as (they) carry [[parasites]] and [[disease]]”.&lt;ref name="Museums, Libraries, Archives-Integrated pest management: A guide for museums, libraries and archives" /&gt; Bird droppings can also be tracked into the museum and collection space, and by working to remove the birds from entrances, the tracking of the droppings can be controlled.

===Bats===
[[Bat]]s can cause damage and mess with their droppings.

|-
| Casemaking Clothes Moth||[[Tinea pellionella]] (Linnaeus)||[[File:Tinea.pellionella.mounted.jpg|thumb|Tinea.pellionella.mounted]]
The Casemaking Clothes Moth has blurred dark spots on their wings. These moths avoid light as they prefer dark areas, such as storage rooms and closets, and "tend to live in corners or in folds of fabric”.&lt;ref name="CLOTHES MOTHS"&gt;{{cite web|last=University of Kentucky Entomology|title=CLOTHES MOTHS|url=http://www2.ca.uky.edu/entomology/entfacts/ef609.asp|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casemaking Clothes Moths are known to eat stored wool, [[hair]], [[fur]], [[silk]], [[felt]], and [[feathers]].&lt;ref name="CLOTHES MOTHS"&gt;{{cite web|last=University of Kentucky Entomology|title=CLOTHES MOTHS|url=http://www2.ca.uky.edu/entomology/entfacts/ef609.asp|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| Cigarette beetle||[[Lasioderma serricorne]] (Fabricius)||[[File:Drugstore beetle 03.jpg|thumb|Drugstore beetle 03]]
The cigarette beetle is a stored product pest and gets its name from the [[tobacco]] it can be found living within. The beetles are attracted to dried plants and [[books]] in the collection.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt;
|-
| [[Drugstore Beetle]]||Stegobium paniceum (Linnaeus)||[[File:Stegobium paniceum bl.jpg|thumb|Stegobium paniceum bl]]

|-
| [[Furniture Beetle]]||Anobium punctatum (DeGeer)||[[File:Anobium.punctatum.jpg|thumb|Anobium.punctatum]]
The Furniture beetle are similar to the common carpet beetle and the two can be easily mistaken for one another. These beetles eat a number of common materials found in a museum, including [[Turtle shell|tortoise shell]], [[fur]], [[feathers]], [[silk]], [[horn (anatomy)|horns]], [[wool]] and [[furniture]].&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt;
|-
| [[German Cockroach]]||Blattella germanica (Linnaeus)||[[File:German cockroach.jpg|thumb|German cockroach]]
The [[German cockroach]] can cause damage to objects in a museum's collection by “spitting brown fluid called attar…(this) … can get stuck on artifacts and is very bad to get out”.&lt;ref name="Retz Monroe" /&gt; It is important to identify if your infestation includes young cockroaches as this means you have an infestation and nesting. If these pests have wings and legs this could be a sign that you also have [[mice]]. If this is the case, you should not use rodent bait to deal with the mice, as cockroaches are attracted to the rodent bait; it “is loaded with [[anti-coagulants]], a blood thinner which have no effect on insects …(and) … will only aggravate the roach situation”.&lt;ref name="Retz Monroe" /&gt;
|-
| [[Larder Beetle]]||Dermestes lardarius (Linnaeus)||[[File:Klannebille topp.jpg|thumb|Klannebille topp]]
The [[larder beetle]]  are winged insects with coarse yellow hairs and usually have dark spots along their back. These beetles are known to lay eggs on other dead insects, then the larvae eats the dead insects.&lt;ref name="Larder beetle"&gt;{{cite web|last=Penn State University|title=Larder beetle|url=http://ento.psu.edu/extension/factsheets/larder-beetle|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larder Beetles are known to damage the [[furs]], [[Hide (skin)|hides]], and feather objects in the museum's collection.
|-
| [[Silverfish]]||Lepisma saccharina (Linnaeus)||[[File:LepismaSaccharina.jpg|thumb]]
[[Silverfish]] are [[nocturnal]] insects that enjoy “cool and moist conditions”.&lt;ref name="Retz Monroe" /&gt; These insects feed on the [[starch]] from paper and wallpaper, as well as feed on dead insect parts. The silverfish eats around the ink of the paper it damages and may prevent conservation from easily taking place.
|-
| [[Varied Carpet Beetle]]||Anthrenus verbasci (Linnaeus)||[[File:Anthrenus verbasci MHNT Fronton Side view.jpg|thumb|A''nthrenus verbasci'']]
The various carpet beetles are active [[scavengers]]. These beetles damage carpets, animal products such as feathers, furs, leather, silk, bone, and hides.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt; The carpet beetle is known to live along [[baseboards]] and behind furniture.
|-
| Warehouse Beetle||[[Trogoderma variabile]] (Ballion)||[[File:Trogoderma variabile.jpg|thumb|Trogoderma variabile]]
The warehouse beetle is lively and grows at a rapid rate. These beetles can be found in stored food and are attracted to plants and insect collections in a museum.&lt;ref name="MuseumPest.net - Warehouse beetle"&gt;{{cite web|last=MuseumPest.net|title=Warehouse beetle|url=http://museumpests.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Warehouse-Beetle.pdf|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beetle can be found in the [[dark]], storage areas or in cracks in the building.

==Pest prevention==
There are a number of steps that a museum can put in place to help to prevent pests within their buildings. It is important to inspect any item that is coming in the storage area such as a new accessions or loans. Museums should maintain good housekeeping and restrict food in the museum to help prevent pests in the first place. It is important for the museum to keep the environments in exhibition galleries and the collection storage areas stable with low, controlled [[humidity]] and [[temperature]].
 
A museum may also install sweeps and gaskets on exterior [[door]]s, [[Window screen|screens]] on all [[Drain (plumbing)|drains]] and [[window]]s, while also [[caulking]] all cracks in the building. Museums can make their facilities less attractive to pest by removing any plants growing near the building, cleaning the [[Rain gutter|gutter]]s, using [[sodium vapor]] lighting, minimizing [[dust]], vacuuming the floors, and eliminating clutter.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt;

===Routes of entry===
Pest will always find a way into your building, so it is important to determine how pests are entering your building. The location of the building should be taken into account as every "building has their own [[ecosystem]] based on their location and other historic factors".&lt;ref name="(American Museum of natural History, IPM)" /&gt; It is important to secure the exterior of the building. It does not matter how many pests you trap and kill; if there is a way for more to enter your building you will never completely remove all pests from the building. All of the cracks and holes in the [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]] should be sealed and repaired. All exterior trash receptacles should be placed away from the building, and plants should be at least a foot away from the building.&lt;ref name="Missouri Secretary of State" /&gt; Having [[grass]] growing against the building gives insects another way into the building and a place to hide and tunnel under the foundation.&lt;ref name="Retz Monroe" /&gt;

* Windows

All windows should be tightly sealed. Weatherstripping can be placed around the windows to insure that the window is tightly sealed.&lt;ref name="Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management" /&gt;

* Doors

All doors should be checked and confirmed that they are firmly on their hinges and brush sweepers are installed.&lt;ref name="Retz Monroe" /&gt; Brush sweepers are highly effective against pests, especially rodents.&lt;ref name="Retz Monroe" /&gt; Having sticky traps placed around the sides of doors may prevent pests and monitor what types of pests can be entering the museum.

===Storage condition===
Collection storage areas are especially at risk from pests as they can be darker, tight spaces that often go undisturbed for long periods of time.&lt;ref name="Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management" /&gt; If these tight spaces are left undisturbed and unmonitored for months or years at a time, they will provide  an atmosphere for pests to nest in high quantities. All collection areas should be fully cleaned at least twice a year with regular inspections once a month.

===Water sources===
Insects and other pests are attracted to [[water]] and damp areas. Common sources of water within the building are water pipes that can be found running throughout the building for restrooms, kitchens, water fountains, custodial closets, and climate control equipment.&lt;ref name="Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management" /&gt; Water can also be found standing on the [[roof]] or in [[basement]]. If there are any unused [[pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipe]]s or drains, they should be screened or sealed off to not house unwanted guests.

===Lights===
It is important to reduce the attractiveness of the building to pests, and one of the ways that this can be achieved is through the lighting. A museum should use light shields, curtains, and keep windows closed to minimize the attractiveness of entering the building.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt; Any “lighting affixed to the building should be made with sodium vapor and not mercury” and should have a yellowish tint.&lt;ref name="Retz Monroe" /&gt; [[Sodium vapor]] repels insects, and installing these lights outside of the building can help reduce the pests.

===Housekeeping===
One of the most important compotes of preventing pests is having good housekeeping skills. The building should be regularly vacuumed, mopped, and dusted, and food debris should be removed. When the museum is vacuumed, the edge tool around the furniture and baseboards should be used as pests tend to hide in these locations.&lt;ref name="Retz Monroe" /&gt; The collection storage area should be kept clean and free of clutter. Every six months the entire collection storage area should be cleaned, and every month a visual inspection should be conducted throughout the space.&lt;ref name="Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management" /&gt;

===Temperature and humidity===
Pests can be controlled and growth even slowed when the humidity and temperature is controlled. Humidity should be kept below a maximum of 50%.&lt;ref name="Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management" /&gt; In some cases the pest infestation can be directly related to the humidity and temperature within the building. The optimum temperature should around 68&amp;nbsp;°F.&lt;ref name="Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management" /&gt;

===Screens, caulking, and filters===
Museum can use screens, filters, and caulking to prevent the entry of pests. Screens should be placed over windows and drains. Filters should be used on all of the air vents and replaced on a regular basis. Caulk can be used to seal cracks and holes in the walls, floors, and round pipes.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt;

=== Food sources===
Pests can find many sources of food within a museum; “pests are normally wild creatures but they are opportunistic and if material is available that resembles their preferred natural food or nesting, they will readily adapt and possibly thrive."&lt;ref name="Museums, Libraries, Archives-Integrated pest management: A guide for museums, libraries and archives" /&gt; Food sources can range from human food, to plants and trash. Human food should be consumed in restricted area and have any food put away quickly after use. Plants can come in many forms, including potted plants, cut flowers, and dying plants. Trash should also be collected and removed from the building daily.

==Pest removal==
* Heat 
Treating an object with heat is a method used to disinfect objects by either an oven or a commercial kiln. When the internal temperature reaches “130°F for three hours it will kill any insect”; however, this kind of heat can damage veneer, damage finish of specimens, warp lumber, or melt glues.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt;

* Freezing 
Freezing an object is one of the best ways to disinfect and to destroy pests. This process should be done in a controlled freezer that can reach temperatures below 0&amp;nbsp;°F. “Books, mammal, ethnographic materials and bird collections have been successfully frozen for insect control,” though freezing is not always the best option for certain objects such as certain [[wood]]s, [[bone]], lacquers, some painted surfaces, and [[leather]].&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt; Before an object is frozen for one to two weeks, it should be wrapped tightly in plastic or in a plastic bag.

* Vacuuming 
Vacuuming an infested object can remove pests. It is important to ensure that the “materials are not fragile or deteriorated" if they are to be vacuumed.&lt;ref name="Missouri Secretary of State" /&gt; Vacuuming should remove all of the hatched pest, but some eggs may remain as they can be microscopic. After the object has been vacuumed, it should be placed in a plastic bag isolating the object. During the isolation, the objects should be monitored to make sure that no pests remain on the object, and after the pests life cycle is completed the cleaning process may needed to be repeated.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt;

* Microwave 
Microwaving an infested object is still an experimental technique but has been known to “kill cockroach, silverfish, and psocids inside books … the average infested book is microwaved on high for 20-30 seconds”.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt;

'''Nanotechnology education''' involves a multidisciplinary [[natural science]] education with courses such as [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[mathematics]] and [[molecular biology]].&lt;ref&gt;Aldrin E. Sweeney (2008) Developing a viable knowledge base in nanoscale science and engineering, ''Nanoscale Science and Engineering Education'' (eds. A. E. Sweeney and S. Seal, American Scientific, Stevenson Ranch CA) pp. 1-35, {{ISBN|978-1588830852}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is being offered by many [[University|universities]] around the world. The first program involving [[nanotechnology]] was offered by the [[University of Toronto]]'s Engineering Science program, where nanotechnology could be taken as an option.

Here is a partial list of universities offering nanotechnology education, and the degrees offered ([[Bachelor of Science]], [[Master of Science]], and/or [[Ph.D]] in Nanotechnology).

==Nanotechnology in Schools==
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in introducing nanoscience and nanotechnology in grade schools, especially at the [[high school]] level. 
In the [[United States]], although very few high schools officially offer a two-semester course in nanotechnology, “nano” concepts are bootstrapped and taught during traditional science classes using a number of educational resources and hands-on activities developed by dedicated non-profit organizations, such as:

* The [[National Science Teachers Association|National Science Teacher Association]], which has published a number of textbooks for nanotechnology in K-12 education, including a teacher’s guide and an activity manual for hands-on experiences. 
* [http://www.nano-link.org Nano-Link], a notable program of the [[Dakota County Technical College]], which has developed a variety of nanotech-related hands-on activities supported by toolkits to teach concepts in nanotechnology throughout direct lab experience.
* [http://www.omninano.org Omni Nano], which is developing comprehensive educational resources specifically designed to support a two-semester high school course, both online and in classrooms. Omni Nano also discusses issues in nanotechnology education on its dedicated blog.
* [http://www.nano4me.org/ Nano4Me], which has a good amount of resources for K-12 education, although their program is intended for higher education. Their K-12 resources include introductory level modules and activities, interactive multimedia, and a collection of experiments and hands-on activities. 
* [[Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network|Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network (NISE)]], which has a website of educational products designed to engage the public in nano science, engineering, and technology. NISE also organizes Nano Days, a nationwide festival of educational programs about nanoscale science and engineering and its potential impact on the future.

In Egypt, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090107041954/http://www.in2nano.sabrycorp.com/ in2nano] is a high school outreach program aiming to increase [[scientific literacy]] and prepare students for the sweeping changes of nanotechnology.

==Nanotechnology education outside of school==
* [[Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network|Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network (NISE)]] has a website of educational products designed to engage the public in nano science, engineering, and technology available at [http://www.nisenet.org www.nisenet.org] and a site for the public at [http://www.whatisnano.org www.whatisnano.org]. The NISE Network also organizes [[Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network#NanoDays|Nano Days]], a nationwide festival of educational programs about nanoscale science and engineering and its potential impact on the future.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17206">'''Neuromorphology''' (from Greek νεῦρον, neuron, "nerve"; μορφή, morphé, "form"; -λογία, -logia, “study of”&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:morphology|Morphology]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:neuron|Neuron]]&lt;/ref&gt;) is the study of [[nervous system]] form, shape, and structure. The study involves looking at a particular part of the nervous system from a [[Molecular biology|molecular]] and [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] level and connecting it to a [[physiology|physiological]] and  [[anatomy|anatomical]] point of view. The field also explores the communications and interactions within and between each specialized section of the nervous system.
[[morphology (biology)|Morphology]] is distinct from [[morphogenesis]]. Morphology is the study of the shape and structure of biological organisms, while morphogenesis is the study of the biological development of the shape and structure of organisms. Therefore, neuromorphology focuses on the specifics of the structure of the nervous system and not the process by which the structure was developed. Neuromorphology and morphogenesis, while two different entities, are nonetheless closely linked.

== History ==
Progress in defining the morphology of nerve cells has been slow in its development.  It took nearly a century after the acceptance of the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] as the basic unit of life before researchers could agree upon the shape of a [[neuron]].  It was originally thought to be an independent globular [[wiktionary:corpuscle|corpuscle]] suspended along [[nerve fibers]] that looped and coiled.&lt;ref name="Peters"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Peters |first1=Alan |last2=Palay |first2=Sanford L. |last3=Webster |first3=Henry deF. |title=The Fine Structure of the Nervous System: Neurons and Their Supporting Cells |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=January 1991 |isbn=0-19-506571-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the first successful [[microdissection]] of a whole nerve cell by [[Otto Deiters]] in 1865 that the separate [[dendrite]]s and [[axon]] could be distinguished.&lt;ref name=Peters /&gt; At the end of the 19th century, new techniques, such as [[Golgi's method]], were developed that enabled researchers to view the whole neuron. This Golgi investigation then promoted new research in neuronal spacing by [[Ramon y Cajal]] in 1911. Further morphology research continued to develop, including dendritic morphology. In 1983 Thoroya Abdel-Maguid and David Bowsher expanded upon the golgi method and combined it with an impregnation technique which allowed them to visualize the dendrites of neurons and classify them based on their dendritic patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abdel-Maguid|first1=Thoroya  |last2=Bowsher|first2=David |title=Classification of neurons by dendriticbranching pattern. A categorisation based on Golgi impregnation of spinal and cranial somatic and visceral afferent and efferent cells in the adult human. |journal=Journal of Anatomy |volume=138 |year=1984 |pages=689–702}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, myriad techniques have been developed and applied to the field of neuromorphology.

===Influence on neuron function===
Research has supported a relationship between the morphological and functional properties of neurons.  For instance, the accordance between the morphology and the functional classes of cat [[retina]]l [[Retinal ganglion cell|ganglion cell]]s has been studied to show the relationship between neuron shape and function.  Orientation sensitivity and dendritic branching patterns are a few other common characteristics of neurons that researchers have noted as having an effect on neuron function.&lt;ref name="Costa"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Costa |first1=Luciano da Fontoura |last2=Campos |first2=Andrea G. |last3=Estrozi |first3=Leandro F. |last4=Rios-Filho |first4=Luiz G. |last5=Bosco |first5=Alejandra |title=A Biologically-Motivated Approach to Image Representation and Its Application to Neuromorphology |journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |volume=1811 |year=2000 |pages=192–214 |doi=10.1007/3-540-45482-9_41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian A. Meinertzhagen et al. have recently established a connection between the genetic factors that underlie a specific neuronal structure and how these two factors then pertain to the neuron's function by examining the optic nerves in ''Drosophila melanogaster''. They assert the structure of the neuron is able to determine its function by dictating synapse formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Meinertzhagen |first1= Ian A. |last2=Takemura |first2=Shin-ya |last3=Lu |first3=Zhiyuan |last4=Huang |first4=Songling |last5=Gao |first5=Shuying |last6=Ting |first6=Chun-Yuan |last7=Lee |first7=Chi-Hon |title=From Form to Function: the ways to know a neuron. |journal=Journal of Neurogenetics |volume=23 |pages=68–77 |year=2009 |doi=10.1080/01677060802610604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The geometry of neurons often depends on the cell type and the history of received stimuli that is processed through the synapses.  The shape of a neuron often directs the neuron's function by establishing its synaptic partnerships.  However, there is also a growing evidence for [[volume transmission]], a process that involves electrochemical interactions from the whole [[cell membrane]].&lt;ref name=Costa /&gt;

The axonal tree morphology is instrumental in activity modulation and information coding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ofer |first1=Netanel |last2=Shefi |first2=Orit |last3=Yaari |first3=Gur |title=Branching morphology determines signal propagation dynamics in neurons |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=7 |date=August 2017 |PMID=28827727 |doi=10.1038/s41598-017-09184-3 |pmc=5567046}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Development===
The development of the morphological features of neurons is governed by both [[intrinsic]] and [[extrinsic]] factors.  The neuromorphology of [[nervous tissue]] is dependent upon genes and other factors, such as [[electrical field|electric fields]], ionic waves, and [[gravity]].  Developing cells additionally impose geometrical and physical constraints upon each other.  These interactions affect the neural shape and [[synaptogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Costa |first1=Luciano da Fontoura |last2=Manoel |first2=Edson Tadeu Monteiro |last3=Fauchereau |first3=Fabien |last4=Chelly |first4=Jamel |last5=van Pelt |first5=Jaap |last6=Ramakers |first6=Ger |title=A shape analysis framework for neuromorphometry |journal=Institute of Physics Publishing |volume=13 |date=July 2002 |pages=283–310 |doi=10.1088/0954-898x/13/3/303}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Morphological measures and imaging applications are important for further understanding the developmental process.

== Subfields ==

===General morphology===
[[File:GolgiStainedPyramidalCell.jpg|thumb |right |200px | A human [[Neocortex|neocortical]] [[pyramidal cell]] that has been stained using Golgi's method. The cell is named after its characteristic triangular-shaped [[Cell soma|soma]].]]

Since there is a broad range of functions performed by different types of neurons in diverse parts of the nervous system, there is a wide variety in the size, shape, and [[electrochemistry|electrochemical]] properties of neurons.  Neurons can be found in different shapes and sizes and can be classified based upon their morphology.  The Italian scientist [[Camillo Golgi]] grouped neurons into type I and type II cells.  [[Golgi I]] neurons have long axons that can move signals over long distances, such as in [[Purkinje cells]], whereas [[Golgi II]] neurons generally have shorter axons, such as [[granule cell]]s, or are anoxonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Purves |first1=Dale|title=Neuroscience |year=2001 |publisher=Sinauer Associates Inc. |location=Sunderland |isbn=0-87893-742-0 |edition=2.|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neurons can be morphologically characterized as [[unipolar neuron|unipolar]], [[bipolar neuron|bipolar]], or [[multipolar neuron|multipolar]].  Unipolar and [[pseudounipolar]] cells have only one [[Process (anatomy)|process]] extending from the cell body.  Bipolar cells have a two processes extending from the [[cell body]] and multipolar cells have three or more processes extending towards and away from the cell body.

=== Theoretical neuromorphology ===
{{Main article|Theoretical neuromorphology}}
Theoretical neuromorphology is a branch of neuromorphology focused on the mathematical description of the shape, structure and connectivity of the nervous system.

===Gravitational neuromorphology===
Gravitational neuromorphology studies the effects of altered [[gravity]] on the architecture of the [[central nervous system|central]], [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral]], and [[autonomic nervous system]]s. This subfield aims to expand the current understanding of the adaptive capabilities of nervous systems, and specifically examines how environmental effects can alter nervous system structure and function. In this case environmental manipulations generally include exposing neurons to either [[hypergravity]] or [[microgravity]]. It is a subset of [[gravitational biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Krasnov |first1=IB |title=Gravitational neuromorphology |journal=Advanced Space Biology Medicine |volume=4 |date=December 1994 |pages=85–110 |PMID=7757255 |doi=10.1016/s1569-2574(08)60136-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research methods and techniques ==
A variety of techniques have been used to study neuromorphology, including [[confocal microscopy]], design-based [[stereology]], neuron tracing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Oztas |first1=Emin |title=Neuronal tracing |journal=Neuroanatomy |volume=2 |pages=2–5 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and neuron reconstruction.  Current innovations and future research include [[virtual microscopy]], automated stereology, [[cortical map]]ping, map guided automated [[Anterograde tracing|neuron tracing]], microwave techniques, and network analysis. Of the currently used techniques for studying neuromorphology, design-based stereology and confocal microscopy are the two most preferred methods. A complete database of neuronal morphology called the NeuroMorpho Database also exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Costa |first1=Luciano Da Fontoura |last2=Zawadzki |first2=Krissia |last3=Miazaki |first3=Mauro |last4=Viana |first4=Matheus P. |last5=Taraskin |first5=Sergei N. |title=Unveiling the Neuromorphological Space |journal=Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience |volume=4 |date=December 2010 |PMID=21160547 |doi=10.3389/fncom.2010.00150 |pmc=3001740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design-based stereology ===
Design-based stereology is one of the most prominent methods for mathematically extrapolating a 3-D form from a given 2-D form. It is currently the leading technique in [[medical research|biomedical research]] for analyzing 3-D structures.&lt;ref name=Lemmens&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lemmens |first1=Marijke A.M. |last2=Steinbusch |first2=Harry W.M. |last3=Rutten |first3=Bart P.F. |last4=Schmitz |first4=Christoph |title=Advanced microscopy techniques for quantitative analysis in neuromorphology and neuropathology research: current status and requirements for the future |journal=Journal of Chemical Neuroanatomy |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=199–209 |year=2010 |PMID=20600825 |doi=10.1016/j.jchemneu.2010.06.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Design-based stereology is a newer stereology technique that examines morphology that has been predefined and designed. This technique contrasts with the older method, model-based stereology, which utilized previously determined models as a guide. The more current design-based stereology allows researchers to probe the morphology of neurons without having to make assumptions about their size, shape, orientation or distribution. Design-based stereology also gives researchers more freedom and flexibility as model-based stereology is only effective if the models are truly representative of the object being studied, while design-based stereology is not constrained in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is design-based stereology|url=http://www.stereology.info/design-based-stereology/|accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Confocal microscopy ===
{{Main article|Confocal microscopy}}
[[File:Confocalprinciple in English.svg|thumb|300px|right|Diagram of how confocal microscopy works.]]
Confocal microscopy is the [[Microscopic scale|microscopic]] procedure of choice for examining neuron structures as it produces sharp images with improved [[Display resolution|resolution]] and decreased [[signal-to-noise ratio]]. The specific way this microscopy works allows one to look at one confocal plane at a time, which is optimal when viewing neuronal structures. Other more conventional  forms of microscopy simply do not allow one to visualize all neuronal structures, especially those that are subcellular. Recently, some researchers have actually been combining design-based stereology and confocal microscopy to further their investigations into the specific neuronal cellular structures.

===Cortical mapping===
[[Cortical map]]ping is defined as the process of characterizing specific regions in the brain based on either anatomical or functional features. Current brain atlases are not definitive or homogenous enough to portray specific structural details. Recent advances in functional brain imaging and [[statistical analysis]] may however prove to be sufficient in the future. A recent development in this field called the Gray Level Index (GLI) method allows for more objective identification of cortical regions via [[algorithm]]s. The GLI is a standardized method that allows researchers to determine neuron density. It is specifically defined as the ratio of area covered by Nissl-stained elements to area covered by unstained elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Casanova |first1=Manuel F. |last2=Buxhoeveden |first2=Daniel P. |last3=Switala |first3=Andrew E. |last4=Roy |first4=Emil |title=Neuronal Density and Architecture (Gray Level Index) in the Brains of Autistic Patients. |journal=Journal of Child Neurology |volume=17 |pages=515–21 |year=2002 | doi = 10.1177/088307380201700708 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More sophisticated cortical mapping techniques are still in the process of being developed and this field will most likely see an exponential growth in mapping methods in the near future.

== Clinical applications ==
Neuromorphology has been used as a new method of exploring the underlying cause of many [[neurological disorder]]s, and has been included in the clinical study of various [[Neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative]] diseases, [[mental disorder]]s, [[Learning disability|learning disabilities]], and dysfunctions due to brain damage. Researchers have been using neuromorphological techniques to not only study the damage but also ways to regenerate the damage nerve through ways like axon growth stimulation.
Neuromophology has been used to study [[optical nerve]] damage, specifically looking at [[lesion]]s and [[Atrophy|atrophies]]. Researchers have also examined and identified the neuromorphology of the human penis to better understand the role the sympathetic nervous system plays in achieving an erection. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benson|first1=George |last2=McConnell |first2=Joann |last3=Lipshultz|first3=Larry I. |last4=Corriere|first4=Joseph Jr. |last5=Wood|first5=Joe |title=Neuromorphology and Neuropharmacology of the Human Penis.|journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=506–513 |year=1980 |PMID=7356692 |doi=10.1172/JCI109694 |pmc=371389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current and future research ==

===Computational neuromorphology===
Computational neuromorophology examines neurons and their substructures by cutting them into slices and studying these different subsections. It also describes the neuromorphological space as a 3-D space. This allows researchers to understand the size of specific neuronal components. Additionally, the 3-D imaging helps researchers comprehend how the neuron transmits information within itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trinidad|first=Pablo|title=Computational Neuromorphology|url=http://www.utdallas.edu/~trinidad/p2/index.htm|publisher=University of Texas at Dallas|accessdate=2 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102094212/http://utdallas.edu/%7Etrinidad/p2/index.htm|archivedate=2 January 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Virtual microscopy ===
Virtual microscopy would allow researchers to obtain images with a decreased amount of imaging sessions, thus preserving the integrity of the tissue and decrease the possibility the [[Fluorescent labelling|fluorescent dyes]] fading during imaging. This method would additionally give researchers abilities to visualize currently unobtainable data, such as rare cell types and the spatial allocation of cells in a specific brain region.&lt;ref name=Lemmens /&gt; Virtual microscopy would essentially allow for the [[Digitizing|digitization]] of all images obtained, therefore preventing [[Degeneration|deterioration]] of the data. This digitization could also potentially permit researchers to create a [[database]] to share and store their data.

[[File:Patchpanel2.JPG|thumb|right|A remote broadcast trailer's jackfield]]
[[File:19-inch rackmount Ethernet switches and patch panels.jpg|thumb|A couple of managed [[Gigabit Ethernet]] rackmount switches, connected to the Ethernet ports on a few [[Panduit]] patch panels using [[Category 6 cable|Category&amp;nbsp;6]] [[patch cable]]s (all equipment is installed in a standard 19-inch rack)]]

A '''patch panel''', '''patch bay''', '''patch field''' or '''jack field''' is a device or unit featuring a number of [[registered jack|jacks]], usually of the same or similar type, for the use of connecting and routing [[circuit (telecom)|circuit]]s for monitoring, interconnecting, and testing circuits in a convenient, flexible manner. Patch panels are commonly used in [[computer networking]], [[recording studios]], [[radio]] and [[television]].

The term "patch" came from early use in [[telephony]] and [[radio studio]]s, where extra equipment kept on standby could be temporarily substituted for failed devices. This reconnection was done via [[patch cord]]s and patch panels, like the jack fields of cord-type [[telephone switchboard]]s.

==Uses and connectors==
In [[recording studio]]s, television and radio broadcast studios, and concert sound reinforcement systems, patchbays are widely used to facilitate the connection of different devices, such as microphones, electric or electronic instruments, [[sound effect|effects]] (e.g. compression, reverb, etc.), recording gear, [[amplifier]]s, or broadcasting equipment. Patchbays make it easier to connect different devices in different orders for different projects, because all of the changes can be made at the patchbay. Additionally, patchbays make it easier to troubleshoot problems such as [[Ground loop (electricity)|ground loop]]s; even small home studios and amateur project studios often use patchbays, because it groups all of the input jacks into one location. This means that devices mounted in racks or keyboard instruments can be connected without having to hunt around behind the rack or instrument with a flashlight for the right jack. Using a patchbay also saves wear and tear on the input jacks of studio gear and instruments, because all of the connections are made with the patchbay.

Patch panels are being used more prevalently in domestic installations, owing to the popularity of "Structured Wiring" installs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = How to Use a Patchbay | url =http://ledgernote.com/columns/studio-recording/how-to-use-a-patchbay/ |work = Ledger Note | accessdate = April 22, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also found in home cinema installations more and more.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Normalization==
[[File:Theatpatchbay.JPG|thumb|right|A patch bay for patching circuits to [[stage lighting]] [[Stage lighting instrument|instruments]] ]]
[[File:Trompeter JSI-52 Patch Panel.jpeg|thumb|Rear view of a patch panel with dual coax patch jacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Trompeter Product Catelog|publisher=Trompeter|page=51|url=http://www.connecticc.com/pdfs/trompeter_catalog-3.pdf|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

It is conventional to have the top row of jacks wired at the rear to outputs and bottom row of jacks wired to inputs.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} Patch bays may be half-normal (usually bottom) or full-normal, "normal" indicating that the top and bottom jacks are connected internally. When a patch bay has bottom half-normal wiring, then with no patch cord inserted into either jack, the top jack is internally linked to the bottom jack via break contacts on the bottom jack; inserting a patch cord into the top jack will take a feed off that jack while retaining the internal link between the two jacks; inserting a patch cord into the bottom jack will break the internal link and replace the signal feed from the top jack with the signal carried on the patch cord. With top half-normal wiring, the same happens but vice versa. If a patch bay is wired to full-normal, then it includes break contacts in both rows of jacks.

==Switches==
Dedicated switching equipment can be an alternative to patch bays in some applications. Switches can make routing as easy as pushing a button, and can provide other benefits over patch bays, including routing a signal to any number of destinations simultaneously.  However, switching equipment that can emulate the capabilities of a given patch bay is much more expensive. For example, an S-Video matrix routing switcher with the same capability (8×8) as a 16-point [[S-Video]] patch panel (8 patch cables connects 8 inputs and 8 outputs) may cost ten times more, though it would probably have more capabilities.

Like patch panels, switching equipment for nearly any type of signal is available, including analog and digital video and audio, as well as [[radio frequency|RF]] (cable TV), [[MIDI]], telephone, networking and electrical. There are various types of switches for audio and video, from simple [[selector switch]]es to sophisticated [[production switcher]]s. However, emulating or exceeding the capabilities of audio or video patch panels requires specialized devices like [[routing switch]]es and [[crossbar switch]]es.

Switching equipment may be electronic, mechanical, or [[electro-mechanical]]. Some switcher hardware can be controlled via computer or other external devices.  Some have automated or pre-programmed operational capabilities.  There are also software switcher applications used to route signals and control data within a "pure digital" computer environment.

'''Queer theory''' is a field of [[critical theory]] that emerged in the early 1990s out of the fields of [[queer studies]] and [[women's studies]]. Queer theory includes both [[queer]] readings of texts and the theorization of 'queerness' itself.  Heavily influenced by the work of [[Lauren Berlant]], [[Leo Bersani]], [[Judith Butler]], [[Lee Edelman]], [[Jack Halberstam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Halberstam|first=Jack|title=An audio overview of queer theory in English and Turkish by Jack Halberstam|url=https://archive.org/details/HalberstamQueerTheory-AnkaraTurkey|accessdate=29 May 2014|date=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]], queer theory builds both upon [[feminist]] challenges to the idea that [[gender]] is part of the [[Essentialism|essential]] self and upon [[gay]]/[[lesbian]] studies' close examination of the [[socially constructed]] nature of [[sexual acts]] and [[Sexual identity|identities]]. Whereas gay/lesbian studies focused its inquiries into natural and unnatural behavior with respect to homosexual behavior, queer theory expands its focus to encompass any kind of sexual activity or identity that falls into [[Normality (behavior)|normative]] and [[deviant]] categories. [[Italian feminist]] and [[film theorist]] [[Teresa de Lauretis]] coined the term ''queer theory'' for a conference she organized at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] in 1990 and a special issue of ''Differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies'' she edited based on that conference.
 
Through the context of heterosexuality being the origin and foundation of society's heteronormative stability, the concept of queerness focuses on, "mismatches between sex, gender and desire"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Queerness has been associated most prominently with [[bisexual]], lesbian and gay subjects, but its [[analytic framework]] also includes such topics as [[cross-dressing]], [[intersex]] bodies and identities, [[gender ambiguity]] and [[gender-corrective surgery]]. Queer theory holds that individual [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] is a fluid, fragmented, and dynamic collectivity of possible sexualities and it may vary at different points of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Critical Theory Today: A User-friendly Guide|last=Tyson|first=Lois|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=978-0415974097|location=New York|pages=335}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its attempted debunking of stable (and correlated) sexes, genders, and sexualities develops out of the specifically lesbian and gay reworking of the post-structuralist figuring of identity as a constellation of multiple and unstable positions.

Queer theory also examines the discourses of homosexuality developed in the last century in order to place the "queer" into historical context, [[deconstructing]] contemporary arguments both for and against this latest terminology.

==Overview==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}
Queer theory is derived largely from [[post-structuralist]] [[theory]], and deconstruction in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Law and Society: American and Global Perspectives|last=Clark|first=David|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2007|isbn=9780761923879|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=1256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ashgate Research Companion to Contemporary Religion and Sexuality|last=Hunt|first=Stephen|last2=Yip|first2=Andrew|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781409409496|location=Oxon|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the 1970s, a range of authors brought deconstructionist critical approaches to bear on issues of sexual identity, and especially on the construction of [[Heteronormativity]], i.e. the normalizing practices and institutions that [[Privilege (social inequality)|privilege]] heterosexuality as fundamental in [[society]] and in turn [[Sexual orientation discrimination|discriminates]] those outside this [[system of power|stem of power]],&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and focused to a large degree on non-heteronormative sexualities and sexual practices. In "The Politics of Inside/Out" Fuss asserts that the concept of “coming out” and being visible has been normalized while simultaneously contributing to the disappearance of queerness. By declaring oneself to be visible and “out” declares the ones who are not invisible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Namaste|first=Ki|date=1994|title=The Politics of Inside/Out: Queer Theory, Poststructuralism, and a Sociological Approach to Sexuality|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=2&amp;sid=fff70ba9-67d4-4981-8ccf-7dbf8e0fdb3a%40pdc-v-sessmgr06|journal=Sociological Theory|volume=12|pages=220|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was also influenced by the political agency, particularly the Anglo-American cultures in the HIV/AIDS activism of the 1980s and contemporary feminism in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Queer Theory's overarching goal is to be sought out as a lens or tool to deconstruct the existing monolithic [[Ideal (ethics)|ideals]] of [[social norms]] and [[Folk taxonomy|taxonomies]]; as well as, how these [[Norm (social)|norms]] came into being and why.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sexual Deviance and Society: A sociological examination|last=Worthen|first=Meredith|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781138819061|location=Oxon|pages=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view is that these notions and norms are rigid organizing categories that do not sufficiently explain different attitudes, behaviors, or conditions of individual experiences. In addition, it analyzes the correlation between power distribution and identification while understanding the [[Wiktionary:multifarious|multifarious]] facets of [[oppression]] and privilege. [[Feminist theory|Feminist]] and Queer Theory are seen as applicable concepts that provide a framework to explore these issues rather than as an identity to those in the [[community]]. Queer is an [[umbrella term]] for those not only deemed sexually deviant, but also used to describe those who feel [[Social exclusion|marginalized]] as a result of standard [[social practices]]. It is a “site of permanent becoming” (Giffney, 2004).&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi= 10.1177/1464700104040814|title= Denormatizing Queer Theory: More Than (Simply) Lesbian and Gay Studies|journal= Feminist Theory|volume= 5|pages= 73–78|year= 2004|last1= Giffney|first1= Noreen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''queer theory'' was introduced in 1990, with [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]], Judith Butler, [[Adrienne Rich]] and Diana Fuss (all largely following the work of [[Michel Foucault]]) being among its foundational proponents.

[[Annamarie Jagose]] wrote ''Queer Theory: An Introduction'' in 1996.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jagose|first1=Annamarie|title=Queer theory an introduction|date=1996|publisher=New York Univ. Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0814742341|edition=Reprint.|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/queer-theory-an-introduction/oclc/35651102&amp;referer=brief_results}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queer used to be a [[slang]] word for homosexuals and was used for [[homophobic abuse]]. Recently, this term has been used as an umbrella term for a coalition of sexual identities that are culturally marginalized, and at other times, to create discourse surrounding the budding [[theoretical model]] that primarily arose through more traditional lesbian and gay studies. According to Jagose (1996), "Queer focuses on mismatches between sex, gender and desire. For most, queer has been prominently associated with those who identify as lesbian and gay. Unknown to many, queer is in association with more than just gay and lesbian, but also cross-dressing, [[hermaphroditism]], gender ambiguity and gender-corrective surgery."

In addition, it is important to understand that Queer Theory is not predominantly about analyzing the binary of the homosexual and heterosexual. There is an abundance of identities in which Queer Theory not only recognizes but also breaks down in relation to other contributing factors like [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[Social class|class]], [[religion]], etc.

"Queer is a product of specific [[cultural]] and theoretical pressures which increasingly structured debates (both within and outside the academy) about questions of lesbian and gay identity,"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but now, with the evolution of language, it is important to understand that the terms ‘gay’ and ‘lesbian’ are static, [[Eurocentric]] labels that fail to be universal when looking at a transnational scale. It is merely reductive to view Queer Theory as a byname for Gay and Lesbian studies when the two fields have stark differences.{{quote box|align=center|width=50%|quote=Queer is by definition whatever is at odds with the normal, the legitimate, the dominant.

The future of queer theory is rooted in the aspiration of the term being utilized to reference and question all deviations from normative, as well as serve as a foundation of interrogation of the normative. The desires that queer theory is centered in do not reference sexuality, however because the foundation of queer theory lies in the assessment and analysis of what is deemed normative and non-normative, sexuality intersects with the components that maintain the fundamentals of queer theory.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Queer theorist [[Michael Warner]] attempts to provide a solid definition of a concept that typically circumvents categorical definitions: "Social reflection carried out in such a manner tends to be creative, fragmentary, and defensive, and leaves us perpetually at a disadvantage. And it is easy to be misled by the [[utopian]] claims advanced in support of particular tactics. But the range and seriousness of the problems that are continually raised by queer practice indicate how much work remains to be done. Because the logic of the sexual order is so deeply embedded by now in an indescribably wide range of social institutions, and is embedded in the most standard accounts of the world, queer struggles aim not just at toleration or equal status but at challenging those institutions and accounts. Similarly, queer theorist [[Cathy J. Cohen|Cathy Cohen]] highlights the limitations of a queer politics that attempts integration into “dominant institutions and normative social relationships” in order to centralize [[LGBTQ]] identity, and rather that it is necessary to affect the [[societal values]] and legislations that result in these oppressive institutions and relationships of power.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The dawning realization that themes of [[homophobia]] and [[heterosexism]] may be read in almost any document of our culture means that we are only beginning to have an idea of how widespread those institutions and accounts are".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ed|first1=Michael Warner|title=Fear of a queer planet queer politics and social theory|date=1997|publisher=Univ. of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=978-0816623341|edition=3. pr.|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/fear-of-a-queer-planet-queer-politics-and-social-theory/oclc/28634756&amp;referer=brief_results}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Queer theory explores and contests the categorization of gender and [[sexuality]]. If identities are not fixed, they cannot be categorized and labeled, because identities consist of many varied components, so categorization by one characteristic is incomplete, and there is an interval between what a subject "does" ([[Role-taking theory|role-taking]]) and what a subject "is" (the [[self]]). This opposition destabilizes identity categories, which are designed to identify the "sexed subject" and place individuals within a single restrictive [[sexual orientation]].

==History==
"Queer" marks both a continuity and a break with the notion of gayness emerging from [[gay liberationist]] and [[lesbian feminist]] models, such as [[Adrienne Rich]]'s ''[[Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence]]''. "Gay" vs. "queer" fueled debates (both within and outside of academia) about LGBT identity. The independence of "queer" from "gay" came from the alignment of gay ideals with assimilationism and conservatism, while queer coincided with a radical approach. Assimilationists saw being nothing wrong with society; queer radicalism aspires to achieve nothing in reference to the status quo because societal acceptance is not essential because society is unacceptable.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kemp|first1=Jonathan|title=Queer Past, Queer Present, Queer Future|journal=Graduate Journal of Social Science|date=2009|volume=6|issue=1|url=http://gjss.org/sites/default/files/issues/chapters/papers/Journal-06-01--01-Kemp.pdf|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matos|first1=Angel Daniel|title=Gay Assimilationists versus Radical Queers: The Death of Queerness?|url=http://angelmatos.net/2013/04/06/gay-assimilationists-versus-radical-queers-the-death-of-queerness/|website=The Ever and Ever That Fiction Allows|accessdate=4 June 2015|date=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a long history of [[Critical thinking|critical]] and [[anarchistic]] thinking about sexual and gender relations across many cultures. [[Josiah Flynt]] became one of the first [[sociologists]] to study homosexuality. Most recently, in the late 1970s and 1980s, [[social constructionists]] conceived of the sexual subject as a culturally dependent, historically specific product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rubin|first1=Gayle S.|title=Deviations : a Gayle Rubin reader|date=2011|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, NC|isbn=978-0-8223-4971-6|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/deviations-a-gayle-rubin-reader/oclc/777134989&amp;referer=brief_results}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the phrase "queer theory" was born, the term "Queer Nation" appeared on the cover of the short-lived lesbian/gay quarterly [[Outlook (magazine)|''Outlook'']] in the winter 1991 issues. Writers Allan Berube and Jeffrey Escoffier drove home the point that Queer Nation strove to embrace paradoxes in its [[political activism]], and that the activism was taking new form and revolving around the issue of identity.&lt;ref name="A genealogy of queer theory"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=William B.|title=A genealogy of queer theory|date=2000|publisher=Temple Univ. Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1-56639-787-2|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/genealogy-of-queer-theory/oclc/43562107&amp;referer=brief_results}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon enough ''Outlook'' and ''Queer Nation'' stopped being published, however, there was a mini-gay renaissance going on during the 1980s and early 1990s. There were a number of significant outbursts of lesbian/gay political/[[LGBT culture|cultural]] activity. Out of this emerged queer theory. Their work however did not arise out of the blue. [[Teresa de Lauretis]] is credited with coining the phrase "queer theory". It was at a working conference on lesbian and gay sexualities that was held at the [[University of California]], [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] in February 1990 that de Lauretis first made mention of the phrase.&lt;ref&gt;David Halperin. "The Normalization of Queer Theory." ''Journal of Homosexuality'', v.45, pp. 339–343&lt;/ref&gt; She later introduced the phrase in a 1991 special issue of [[Differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies|''difference''s'': A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies'']], entitled "Queer Theory: Lesbian and Gay Sexualities." Similar to the description Berube and Escoffier used for Queer Nation, de Lauretis asserted that, "queer unsettles and questions the genderedness of sexuality."&lt;ref name=education&gt;{{Citation|last=Pinar|first=William F.|title=Queer Theory in Education|year=1998|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.|location=Mahwah|pages=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barely three years later, she abandoned the phrase « on the grounds that it had been taken over by those mainstream forces and institutions it was coined to resist ».&lt;ref&gt;Jagose, A 1996, "Queer Theory".&lt;/ref&gt; Judith Butler's ''[[Gender Trouble]]'', [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]]'s ''[[Epistemology of the Closet]]'', and [[David Halperin]]'s ''[[One Hundred Years of Homosexuality]]'' inspired other works. Teresa de Lauretis, Judith Butler, and Eve Sedgwick arranged much of the conceptual base for the emerging field in the 1990s. Along with other queer theorists, these three outlined a political [[hermeneutics]], which emphasized representation. These scholars questioned whether people of varying sexual orientations had the same political goals, and whether those in the [[sexual minority]] felt that they could be represented along with others of different sexualities and orientations. "While some critics insist that queer theory is apolitical word-smithery, de Lauretis, Butler, and Sedgwick take seriously the role that signs and symbols play in shaping the meanings and possibilities of our culture at the most basic level, including politics conventionally defined."&lt;ref name="A genealogy of queer theory"/&gt;

Queer theory has increasingly been applied not just to contemporary sexualities and identities but also to practices and identities in earlier time periods. Examination of [[LGBT history#The Renaissance|Renaissance]] culture and [[Renaissance literature|literature]], for example, has generated significant scholarship in the past 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Traub|first1=Valerie|title=The New Unhistoricism in Queer Studies|journal=PMLA|date=2013|volume=128|issue=1|doi=10.1632/pmla.2013.128.1.21|pages=21–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background concepts==

Queer theory is grounded in gender and sexuality. Due to this association, a debate emerges as to whether sexual orientation is [[Nature (philosophy)|natural]] or [[Essence|essential]] to the person, as an [[Gender essentialism|essentialist]] believes, or if sexuality is a social construction and subject to change.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, P 2002, ''Lesbian/gay criticism'', in P Barry (eds), Beginning theory: an introduction to literary and cultural theory, Manchester University Press, Manchester, pp139-155.&lt;/ref&gt;

The essentialist feminists believed that genders "have an essential nature (e.g. nurturing and caring versus being aggressive and selfish), as opposed to differing by a variety of accidental or contingent features brought about by social forces".&lt;ref name="blackburn1996"&gt;Blackburn, S 1996, "essentialism", Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy, (Oxford Reference Online).&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this belief in the essential nature of a person, it is also natural to assume that a person's sexual preference would be natural and essential to a person's [[personality]].

Social constructivism is a concept that proposes the realities we produce and the meanings we create are a result of social [[interaction]]; communicating and existing in a cultural context that conveys meaning to us. Our world is a product of continuous “claims making, labelling and other constitutive definitional processes”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Biever | first1 = Joan L. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 1998 | title = The Social Construction Of Gender: A Comparison Of Feminist And Postmodern Approaches | url = | journal = Counselling Psychology Quarterly | volume = 11 | issue = 2| page = 163 | doi=10.1080/09515079808254052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, queer theorists have offered the argument that there is no essential self at all, and that people exist not just as subjects but also as objects of the social world. In this way, an identity is not born but rather constructed through repeated [[Performativity|performative actions]] that are in turn informed by existing social constructions of gender. By thus analyzing and understanding the ways in which gender is shared and historically constituted, the production of gender can occur differently and beyond a socially constructed binary upon which heterosexuality depends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Butler | first1 = J | year = 1988 | title = Performative acts and gender constitution: An essay in phenomenology and feminist theory | url = | journal = Theatre Journal | volume = 40 | issue = 4| pages = 519–531 | doi=10.2307/3207893| jstor = 3207893 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identity politics==
{{Main|Identity politics#LGBT issues}}
Queer theory was originally associated with [[Political radicalism|radical]] gay politics of [[Act up|ACT UP]], [[OutRage!]] and other groups which embraced "queer" as an identity label that pointed to a [[Separatism|separatist]], [[cultural assimilation|non-assimilationist]] politics.&lt;ref name="blackburn1996"/&gt; Queer theory developed out of an examination of perceived limitations in the traditional [[identity politics]] of recognition and [[self-identity]]. In particular, queer theorists identified processes of consolidation or stabilization around some other identity labels (e.g. gay and lesbian); and construed queerness so as to resist this. Queer theory attempts to maintain a critique more than define a specific identity. These critiques are expressed through a whole range of notions in subfields such as [[ecotechnics]] within technology studies.

Acknowledging the inevitable [[Political violence|violence]] of identity politics, and having no stake in its own [[ideology]], queer is less an identity than a critique of identity. However, it is in no position to imagine itself outside the circuit of problems energized by identity politics.  Instead of defending itself against those criticisms that its operations attract, queer allows those criticisms to shape its – for now unimaginable – future directions. "The term," writes Butler, "will be revised, dispelled, rendered obsolete to the extent that it yields to the demands which resist the term precisely because of the exclusions by which it is mobilized." The mobilization of queer foregrounds the conditions of political representation, its intentions and effects, its resistance to and recovery by the existing networks of power.&lt;ref&gt;Brooker, P, ''A Concise Glossary of Cultural Theory'', 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The studies of Fuss anticipate queer theory. Fuss analyzes queer theory while surpassing the concept of identity politics to assert the nature in how to distinguish people who were not heterosexual from people who are without asserting the positionally of the two from the lens of a binary.&lt;ref&gt;Fuss, D. 1991. "Inside/Out." Pp. 1–10 in Inside/Out. Lesbian Theories, Gay Theories, edited by D. Fuss. New York and London: Rougledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eng, Halberstam and Esteban Munoz offer one of its latest incarnations in the aptly titled "What is Queer about Queer studies now?".&lt;ref&gt;Eng, D. L., J. Halberstam, and J. E. Munoz. 2005. "Introduction: What’s Queer about Queer Studies Now?" Social Text 84–85:1–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Using Judith Butler's critique of sexual identity categories as a starting point, they work around a "queer epistemology" that explicitly opposes the sexual categories of Lesbian and Gay studies and lesbian and gay identity politics. They insist that the field of normalization is not limited to sexuality; social classifications such as gender, race and nationality constituted by a "governing logic" require an epistemological intervention through queer theory." &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=Adam Isaiah|date=2007-03|title=Queer Theory and Sociology: Locating the Subject and the Self in Sexuality Studies|journal=Sociological Theory|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|pages=26–45|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9558.2007.00296.x|issn=0735-2751}}&lt;/ref&gt; "So, the evolution of the queer begins with the problematization of sexual identity categories in Fuss (1996) and extends outward to a more general deconstruction of social [[ontology]] in contemporary queer theory." &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

"Edelman goes from deconstruction of the subject to a deconstructive psychoanalysis of the entire social order; the modern human fear of mortality produces defensive attempts to "suture over the hole in the Symbolic Order."&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, L. 2004. No Future. Durham and London: Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, constructions of "the homosexual" are pitted against constructions of "The Child" in the modern West, wherein the former symbolizes the inevitability of mortality (do not procreate) and the latter an illusory continuity of the self with the social order (survives mortality through one's offspring). The constructs are animated by futuristic fantasy designed to evade mortality." &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

"Fuss, Eng. et al and Edelman represent a distinct moment in the development of queer theory. Whereas Fuss aims to discompose and render inert the reigning classifications of sexual identity, Eng. et al observe the extension of a deconstructive strategy to a wider field of normalization, while Edelman’s work takes not only the specter of "the homosexual", but the very notion of "society" as a manifestation of psychological distress requiring composition."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==Intersex and the role of biology==

Queer theorists focus on problems in classifying individuals as either [[male]] or [[female]], even on a strictly biological basis. For example, the sex [[chromosome]]s ([[X chromosome|X]] and [[Y chromosome|Y]]) may exist in atypical combinations (as in [[Klinefelter syndrome]] [XXY]). This complicates the use of [[genotype]] as a means to define exactly two distinct sexes. [[Intersex]] individuals may for various biological reasons have [[Primary sexual characteristics|sexual characteristics]] that the dominant medical discourse regards as [[disorders of sex development|disordered]].

Scientists who have written on the conceptual significance of intersex individuals include [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]], [[Katrina Karkazis]], [[Rebecca Jordan-Young]], and [[Joan Roughgarden]]. While the [[Disorders of sex development|medical literature]] focuses increasingly on genetics of intersex traits, and even their [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis#Ethical issues|deselection]], some scholars on the study of culture, such as [[Barbara Rogoff]], argue that the traditional distinction between biology and culture as independent entities is overly simplistic, pointing to the ways in which biology and culture interact with one another.&lt;ref&gt;Rogoff, Barbara. ''The Cultural Nature of Human Development''. New York: Oxford UP, USA, 2003: 63–64. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intersex scholars and scientists who have written on intersex include [[Morgan Holmes]], [[Georgiann Davis]], [[Iain Morland]] and [[Janik Bastien-Charlebois]], in each case focusing on more particular realities of the intersex experience. In his essay ''What Can Queer Theory Do for Intersex?'' Morland contrasts queer "hedonic activism" with an experience of post-surgical insensate intersex bodies to claim that "queerness is characterized by the sensory interrelation of pleasure and shame".&lt;ref name="after"&gt;{{Cite book |editor1-last=Morland |editor1-first=Iain |date=2009 |title=Intersex and After |url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/Intersex-and-After/ |journal=[[GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies]] |publisher= |volume=15 |issue=2 |isbn=978-0-8223-6705-5 |pages= |doi= |accessdate=2014-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disability Theory and queer theory ==
In Robert McRuer's ''Crip Theory,'' he mentions the intersection between disability theory and queer theory and how they are aided by their own association with each other and what is normal; for instance, the connection between upholding an able-bodied identity and heterosexuality. He argues that an able-bodied identity functions as more of a subconscious mentality of normality than heterosexuality. McRuer argues that there is a system that is established to distinguish those who are able-bodied from those who have disabilities; that distinction that was instituted the disability concept. Following that same dynamic, the subjection of homosexuality in relation to heterosexuality founded the basis of homosexuality. McRuer emphasizes how the intersecting of queer theory and disability theory would cultivate, “critically disabled spaces overlapping with the critically queer spaces that activists and scholars have shaped during recent decades, in which we can identify and challenge the ongoing consolidation of heterosexual, able-bodied hegemony.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Crip Theory Cultural Signs of Queerness and Disability|last=McRuer|first=Robert|publisher=New York: New York University Press|year=2006|isbn=9780814759868|location=|pages=1–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of Crip Theory by McRuer was not only built on neoliberism but also critically engages with the fundamentality of the term “disability” and the manner that it paradoxically operates. McRuer asserts the nature of which that queer theory and disability theory benefit each other. The functions of the concept of able-bodiedness is utilized as an additional tool to strengthen and maintain the concept of heterosexuality and heteronormativy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kafer|first=Alison|date=2009|title=What's Crip About Queer Theory Now?|url=|journal=Sex Roles|volume=|pages=291–294|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HIV/AIDS and queer theory==

Much of queer theory developed out of a response to the [[AIDS]] crisis, which promoted a renewal of radical activism, and the growing homophobia brought about by public responses to AIDS. Queer theory became occupied in part with what effects – put into circulation around the AIDS epidemic – necessitated and nurtured new forms of political organization, education and theorizing in "queer".

To examine the effects that HIV/AIDS has on queer theory is to look at the ways in which the status of the subject or individual is treated in the biomedical discourses that construct them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donna Haraway]], ''The Biopolitics of Postmodern Bodies'', 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

# The shift, affected by safer [[sex education]] in emphasizing [[sexual practices]] over sexual identities&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bartos, ''Meaning of Sex Between Men'', 1993 and G.W. Dowsett, ''Men Who Have Sex With Men'', 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The persistent misrecognition of HIV/AIDS as a gay disease&lt;ref&gt;Richard Meyer, ''Rock Hudson's Body'', 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Homosexuality as a kind of fatality&lt;ref&gt;Ellis Hanson, ''Unread'', 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The coalition politics of much HIV/AIDS activism that rethinks identity in terms of affinity rather than essence&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Saalfield, ''Shocking Pink Praxis'', 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore includes not only lesbians and gay men but also bisexuals, [[transsexuals]], [[sex workers]], [[people with AIDS]], [[health workers]], and parents and friends of gays; the pressing recognition that discourse is not a separate or second-order reality&lt;ref&gt;Jagose, A 1996, Queer Theory, [http://www.australianhumanitiesreview.org/archive/Issue-Dec-1996/jagose.html].&lt;/ref&gt;
# The constant emphasis on contestation in resisting [[Misconceptions about HIV/AIDS|dominant depictions]] of [[HIV]] and AIDS and representing them otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, Lee 2013, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tb5YAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q=%22totalizable%20identity%22&amp;f=false Homographesis: Essays in Gay Literary and Cultural Theory]'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1134567232}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The rethinking of traditional understandings of the workings of power in cross-hatched struggles over epidemiology, scientific research, public health and immigration policy&lt;ref&gt;David Halperin, ''Homosexuality: A Cultural Construct'', 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The material effects of AIDS contested many [[cultural assumptions]] about identity, justice, desire and knowledge. One scholar claimed that AIDS challenged the health and immunity of Western [[epistemology]]: "the psychic presence of AIDS signifies a collapse of identity and difference that refuses to be abjected from the systems of self-knowledge." (p.&amp;nbsp;292)&lt;ref name="Yingling"&gt;Yingling, Thomas. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=0cbuW1iQVIwC&amp;pg=PA292#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20psychic%20presence%20of%20AIDS%22&amp;f=false AIDS in America: Postmodern Governance, Identity, and Experience]" in Diana Fuss, ed., ''Inside/Out: Lesbian Theories, Gay Theories''. Psychology Press, 1991. pp. 291-310. {{ISBN|978-0415902373}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus queer theory and AIDS become interconnected because each is articulated through a postmodernist understanding of the death of the subject and both understand identity as an ambivalent site.

==Role of language==
:''For language use as associated with sexual identity, see [[Lavender linguistics]].''

Richard Norton suggests that queer language evolved from structures and [[Labeling theory|labels]] imposed by a [[mainstream culture]].

Early discourse of queer theory involved leading theorists: Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and others. This discourse centered on the way that knowledge of sexuality was structured through the use of language. Michel Foucault writes in "[[The History of Sexuality]]", critiquing the idea of the “repressive hypothesis” that supposes from the 17th to the mid-20th century, sex was a private matter limited within a marriage between a husband and wife, and discourses of sex have been otherwise prohibited and repressed. As a result of this repression, people sought outlets to release sexual feelings, building their own discourses of sex and thus liberating themselves from the confines of a sexually repressive society.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. ''The History of Sexuality, volume I: La Volonté de savoir'', 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault argues that the “repressive hypothesis” is a limiting attempt to connect open discourses of sex to personal liberation. This sort of narrative which views discourses of sex as revolutionary [[Idea of progress|progress]] against a repressive system is dependent on the assumption that people of the past were [[sexually repressed]]; however, Foucault states that from the 17th to the mid-20th century the "'repressive hypothesis"' was an illusion, rather a suppression of western society's sexuality. In fact, discourse about sexuality flourished during this time period. Foucault argues,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Western man has been drawn for three centuries to the task of telling everything concerning his sex;that since the classical age there has been a constant optimization and increasing valorization of the discourse on sex; and that this carefully analytical discourse was meant to yield multiple effects of displacement,intensification, reorientation and modification of desire itself. Not only were the boundaries of what one could say about sex enlarged, and men compelled to hear it said; but more important, discourse was connected to sex by a complex organization with varying effects, by a deployment that cannot be adequately explained merely by referring it to a law of prohibition. A censorship of sex? There was installed rather an apparatus for producing an ever greater quantity of discourse about sex, capable of functioning and taking effect in its very economy." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Foucault says at this time there was a political, economic and technical excitement to talk about sex. Sex became a call for management procedures. It became a policing matter.

[[Heteronormativity]] was the main focus of discourse, where heterosexuality was viewed as normal and any deviations, such as homosexuality, as abnormal or "queer". Even before the founding of "queer theory" the Modern Language Association (MLA) came together for a convention in 1973 for the first formal gay-studies seminar due to the rise of lesbian and gay writers and issues of gay and lesbian textuality. The convention was entitled "Gay Literature: Teaching and Research." In 1981, the MLA established the Division of Gay Studies in Language and Literature.

==Media and other creative works==

Many queer theorists have produced creative works that reflect theoretical perspectives in a wide variety of media. For example, [[LGBT themes in speculative fiction|science fiction]] authors such as [[Samuel R. Delany]] and [[Octavia Butler]] feature many values and themes from queer theory in their work. [[Patrick Califia]]'s published fiction also draws heavily on concepts and ideas from queer theory. Some [[lesbian feminist]] novels written in the years immediately following [[Stonewall riots|Stonewall]], such as ''[[Lover (novel)|Lover]]'' by [[Bertha Harris]] or ''[[Les Guérillères]]'' by [[Monique Wittig]], can be said to anticipate the terms of later queer theory. [[Núria Perpinyà|Nuria Perpinya]], a Catalan literary theorist, wrote ''A good mistake'', a novel about the awkward homosexuality in a London genetic engineering lab, between a young white man and a black scientist.&lt;ref&gt;Núria Perpinyà, [http://nuriaperpinya.com/?page_id=172&amp;lang=en ''A good mistake''] 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In film, the genre christened by [[B. Ruby Rich]] as [[New Queer Cinema]] in 1992 continues, as [[Queer Cinema]], to draw heavily on the prevailing critical climate of queer theory; a good early example of this is the [[Jean Genet]]-inspired movie ''[[Poison (film)|Poison]]'' by the director [[Todd Haynes]]. In [[fan fiction]], the genre known as [[slash fiction]] rewrites straight or nonsexual relationships to be gay, bisexual, and queer in a sort of [[Camp (style)|campy]] cultural appropriation. [[Ann Herendeen]]'s ''Pride/Prejudice'',&lt;ref&gt;Pam Rosenthal, "[http://historyhoydens.blogspot.com/2010/09/another-take-on-pride-and-prejudice.html Another Take on Pride And Prejudice]", ''History Hoydens''&lt;/ref&gt; for example, narrates a steamy affair between [[Mr. Darcy]] and Mr. Bingley, the mutually devoted heroes of [[Jane Austen]]'s [[Pride and Prejudice|much-adapted novel]].  And in music, some [[Queercore]] groups and [[zines]] could be said to reflect the values of queer theory.&lt;ref&gt;Matias Viegener, "The only haircut that makes sense anymore," in ''Queer Looks: Lesbian &amp; Gay Experimental Media'' (Routledge, New York: 1993) &amp; "Kinky Escapades, Bedroom Techniques, Unbridled Passion, and Secret Sex Codes," in ''Camp Grounds: Gay &amp; Lesbian Style'' (U Mass, Boston: 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

Queer theorists analyze texts and challenge the cultural notions of "straight" ideology; that is, does "straight" imply heterosexuality as normal or is everyone potentially gay? As Ryan states: "It is only the laborious imprinting of heterosexual norms that cuts away those potentials and manufactures heterosexuality as the dominant sexual format."&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, M., 1999. ''Literary Theory: a practical introduction''. Oxford. Blackwell, p.117.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Hollywood pursues the "straight" theme as being the dominant theme to outline what masculine is. This is particularly noticeable in gangster films, action films and westerns, which never have "weak" (read: homosexual) men playing the heroes, with the recent exception of the film ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]''. Queer theory looks at destabilizing and shifting the boundaries of these cultural constructions.

[[New Media]] artists have a long history of queer theory inspired works, including [[cyberfeminism]] works, porn films like ''[[I.K.U.]]'' which feature transgender cyborg hunters and "Sharing is Sexy", an "open source porn laboratory", using social software, creative commons licensing and netporn to explore queer sexualities beyond the male/female binary.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

== Racism ==
{{See also|Racism in the LGBT community|LGBT culture#Racism|LGBT stereotypes#Intersections between LGBT, race, and class stereotypes}}
Within the [[LGBTQ community]], there lies a distinguishing marker between those who just identify as LGBTQ and those who identify with both an oppressed race alongside being LGBTQ. In "Punks, Bulldaggers, and Welfare Queens", Cathy Cohen critiques modern day queer politics, arguing that lack of recognition of LGBTQ people who face other forms of oppression results in many queers not being supported or acknowledged by Queer politics. Cohen states: "how do queer activists understand and relate politically to those whose same-sex sexual identities position them within the category of queer, but who hold other identities based on class, race and/or gender categories".&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Cathy|date=|title=Punks, Bulldaggers, and Welfare Queens: The Radical Potential of Queer Politics|url=|journal=GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pinpoints the idea she is attempting to make in that the politics of Queer do not encompass all of the [[Queer community]] but only those with the most privilege within the group: primarily [[upper class]], [[White privilege|white]] [[cisgender]] [[Male privilege|men]]. Since this is the case, how then, can a [[Person of Color]] who is also LGBTQ-identifying feel welcomed, supported, and represented if they are being cast aside? Cohen attempts to explain this by stating: "'Unlike the early lesbian and gay movement, which had both ideological and practical links to the left, black activism and feminism, today's 'queer' politicos seem to operate in a historical and ideological vacuum. 'Queer' activists focus on 'queer' issues, and racism, sexual oppression and economic exploitation do not qualify, despite the fact that the majority of 'queers' are people of color, female or working class..."&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt; This lack of recognition is leaving a hefty portion of the LGBTQ community unsupported in all of their endeavors, and it primarily gives aid to those who are LGBTQ and identify as [[white people|white]].

The concept was created out of the mentality that queerness equals deviance. It strives to display the error in assuming that everyone experiences one sole monolithic existence, which establishes the gay white male experience to be central to all other experiences, and that all other experiences derives from the gay white male experience. By institutions establishing and reinforcing the concept that there is a uniform experience that all people from one race endure, it maintains an environment centered on white discourse within the queer community that establishes a “false intimacy.” That false intimacy fails to provide queer youth of color with the support that is necessary to recognize and analyze the intersectionality of their being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fox|first=Catherine O.|last2=Ore|first2=Tracy E.|date=2010|title=(Un) Covering Normalized Gender and Race Subjectivities in LGBT "Safe Spaces"|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=36|issue=3|pages=629–649|jstor=27919125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a response to this oppression, many scholars and queer theorists use [[queer of color critique]] as a practice in both their academic work and personal activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = El-Tayeb | first1 = F | year = 2012 | title = 'Gays Who Cannot Properly Be Gay': Queer Muslims in the Neoliberal European City | url = | journal = European Journal of Women's Studies | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 79–95 | doi=10.1177/1350506811426388}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muñoz, José Esteban.

=== Racialization of the body ===
[[Racism]] has long been embedded within queer theory since the creation of the homosexual body and identity. Siobhan Sommerville's "Scientific Racism and the Invention of the Homosexual Body"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sommerville|first=Siobhan|date=|title=Scientific Racism and the Invention of the Homosexual Body|url=|journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses the invention of homosexuality among the [[scientific community]] as coming at about the same time as the reformulation of [[racial theories]]. According to Sommerville, when there were aggressive attempts to separate and [[Color terminology for race|classify bodies as black or white]], there was also the classification of bodies as heterosexual or homosexual.

Havelock Ellis, an English physician, writer, [[Progressivism|progressive]] intellectual and [[social reformer]], suggested that homosexuality is not a crime, but a [[Wiktionary:congenital|congenital]] [[Human physiology|physiological]] abnormality; he believed that the "invert" was visually distinguishable from the "normal" [[Human body|body]] through [[anatomical]] markers (like the difference between [[male]] and [[female]] bodies).

This was the same as the ideas about the difference between [[racialized]] bodies. There was the idea that [[Black women|black]] and white women's bodies held major differences. Black women were often referred to as the "Bushman race": having strongly muscled [[Posterior (anatomy)|posteriors]], highly [[Afro-textured hair|textured hair]] and other [[Human physical appearance|physical characteristics]] that were considered outside the boundaries of 'normal' female bodies (based on white [[Feminine beauty ideal|beauty standards]]). W.H. Flower and James Murie constructed a site of racial difference by marking the sexual and [[Female reproductive system|reproductive]] anatomy of the African woman as "peculiar." The characteristics of [[African American]] women were consistent with the medical characterizations of lesbians; such as having an "unusually large [[clitoris]]." These supposed distinguishing characteristics further separated not only heterosexual people from queer people, but also white from black, and white homosexual bodies from queer people of color.

=== Racialization of space ===
Racism also exists within [[queer spaces]]. In "Out There: The Topography of Race and Desire in the Global City"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manalansan|first=Martin|date=|title=Out There: The Topography of Race and Desire in the Global City|url=|journal=Global Divas|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Manalansan focuses on the [[gay community in New York City]], most specifically in [[LGBT culture in New York City#Manhattan|Manhattan]]. According to Manalansan, New York City is known to be a [[gay Mecca]]. However, this portrayal, in focusing on Manhattan, centers white, [[Middle class|middle]]/upper class men. The gay community in New York is known to be held exclusively in Manhattan, as this is the area that most people who are not from New York City know. People who are outside of the heart of Manhattan and the gay community there are, literally, "out there". Those who are of different races, gender, or class occupy different spaces and communities which seldom overlap.

Manalansan gives a detailed description of the [[topography]] of New York City in order to show the actual physical and [[Cultural divide|cultural barriers]] that exists between the different boroughs and the gay communities that exist there. Outside of Manhattan, the gay communities are divided by cultural and racial barriers; the [[Hispanics and Latinos in New York|Latin]], [[Asian Americans in New York City|Asian]], and [[African Americans in New York City|Black]] gay communities do not overlap and are also physically distanced from each other. Space is inherently racialized. The racialized gay communities and spaces in New York City only further alienate queer people of color and make them less valued and validated in gay culture.

Carly Thompsen's article "In Plain(s) Sight: Rural LGBTQ Women and the Politics of Visibility" also sheds light on racial issues within visibility politics. In this piece, Thomsen analyzes the estrangement between strategies and discourses of national [[lesbian and gay rights organizations]] and the strategies and discourses of LGBTQ women in the rural [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. She argues that it is crucial for rural queer studies to critique contemporary visibility politics. Due to the overemphasis of an essentially [[urban ethos]], rural LBGTQ politics are usually overshadowed and ignored. This undermining of rural identities in LGBTQ politics is problematic for rural LGBTQ progress. She concludes that rural queer studies must be weary of right-seeking approaches to visibility politics because they indirectly allow the abjection of the rural. From this, Thompsen reflects on how LBGTQ visibility politics as a whole aid to the existence of, and even strengthen [[Queer Metronormativity|metronormativity]] by showing the dominance of [[Urban area|urban]] communities over [[Rural area|rural]] communities in gaining prominence in [[LGBTQ movements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompsen|first1=Carly|title=In Plain(s) Sight: Rural LGBTQ Women and the Politics of Visibility|journal=Queering the Countryside: New Frontiers in Rural Queer Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as Thomsen argues against metronormative ideals of the [[global city]] as always the most progressive, comfortable and [[Social inclusion|inclusive]] space for queer people. Emily Skidmore pushes back on metronormative assumption in her article "Ralph Kerwineo's Queer Body: Narrating the Scales of Social Membership in the Early 20th Century". Her work outlines the life of Ralph Kerwineo, a person born as a black woman, who moves from [[Chicago]] to early 20th century [[Milwaukee]] and passed as a [[Hispanic]] man in the then small town experiencing large influxes of [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]]. Skidmore analyzed newspaper stories of Kerwineo when his ex-girlfriend publicly accused him of being a woman. &amp;nbsp;She found that articles from local papers in Milwaukee were more accepting of Kerwineo's [[gender identity]] regardless of his racial identity (throughout the media outburst he variably identified as [[European Americans|white]], Latin, black and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]) whereas national papers immediately jumped to accusations of Kerwineo's [[perversion]] and guilt. While Milwaukee papers empathized with him, emphasizing that he was always an upstanding member of society, and creating stories of women of color just trying to survive in a difficult situation, national news sources [[Wiktionary:pathologize|pathologized]] Kerwineo, linking racial, sexual, and gender [[Deviance (sociology)|deviance]] to paint a picture of incontestable guilt. &amp;nbsp;Skidmore uses this example to show that queer people have found acceptance and community in places other than global cities, showing that the specific [[Social dynamics|social]] and racial dynamics of Milwaukee at that time provided a safer environment for Kerwineo. Thus, despite metronormative assumptions of national, or larger urban, spaces as queer utopias, their discourses around queer bodies can in fact be more [[Toleration|intolerant]] of people with non-normative gender, sexual, and racial identities than other places.

=== Racialization outside the United States ===
[[LGBT history in Israel|Israel]], in attempts to brand itself as a gay mecca, has been accused of [[Pinkwashing (LGBT)|pinkwashing]]. This is the main idea of the article: "Israel's Gay Propaganda War", written by [[Jasbir Puar]], in which she highlights the [[Criticism of the Israeli government|hypocrisy of the Israeli state]] in branding itself as a gay mecca, attempting to show how progressive the state is despite its [[dehumanizing]] acts against the [[Palestinian people]]. In the midst of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], Israel has been accused of many violations of [[Human rights in Israel|human rights]] against the Palestinian people, and has received an international reputation for being an [[Imperialism|imperial]] aggressor. Their response to this was to proclaim to the [[international community]] that they are more developed and essentially say: "Israel is civilised, Palestinians are barbaric, homophobic, uncivilised, suicide-bombing fanatics. It produces Israel as the only gay-friendly country in an otherwise hostile region."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/01/israels-gay-propaganda-war|title=Israel's gay propaganda war|date=2010-07-01|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; What this entails is Israel is essentially oppressing Palestinians further through their use of [[gay-friendly]] propaganda, which also hides its own problems as state dealing with homophobia as well. What Puar tries to argue is that Israel uses this branding as a method to further justify their treatment of the Palestinian people, and she argues further that the image being portrayed towards Palestinians de-legitimizes those who identify as Queer who are Palestinian since Israel does not support the [[LGBTQ groups in Palestine]], nor does it acknowledge their existence.

In "Queer Injuries: The Racial Politics of 'Homophobic Hate Crime' in Germany", Jin Haritaworn calls attention to the tradeoffs between the passing of Anti-[[Hate Crime]] legislation. In this piece, Haritaworn examines the problems with [[hate crime legislation in Germany]] and how racist views are still manifested in anti-hate crime laws and have racial ramifications. The move of LGBTQ activism into the judicial sphere enables police and military systems to reinvent themselves as the protector of [[Minority group|minorities]] while police activity [[Institutional racism|targeting racialized populations]] is reaching new heights. Additionally, these newly publicized and politicized subjectivities and embodiments still adhere to a specific [[neoliberal ideology]] and fantasy. Incorporating [[criminal justice]] analysis into sexual justice narratives, Haritaworn finds that internationally, LGBTQ anti-hate legislation still marginalizes and represses other minorities by forcing victim-perpetrator narratives that target certain groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haritaworn|first1=Jin|title=Queer Injuries: The Racial Politics of 'Homophobic Hate Crime' in Germany|journal=Social Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emmanuel David researches transgender people—primarily trans women—in call centers in the Philippines. In these spaces, David finds that international corporations are integrating trans women into the workforce in a way that both requires them to perform gender labor and David partake in the neoliberal capitalist system as members of the periphery. In his article "Purple-Collar Labor: Transgender Workers and Queer Value at Global Call Centers in the Philippines", David outlines how transgender filipina call center workers are expected to keep morale up by performing in fashion shows, staying happy and joking around with their team members, all for the sake of worker productivity. He shows that trans women that do not uphold these standards or who are not extroverted in their work interactions are not as accepted in their gender identity as the trans women workers who are openly flamboyant and funny. This research highlights a portion of the queer community outside of the core, upper class, white, male, US urban population and pushes back on assumptions of 'Out There' being a space of intolerance, danger and conformity, but also highlights how queer bodies can be integrated into the global capitalist system and normalized in a place many readers might not expect.

== Feminism ==
{{Main|Feminist views on sexuality#Feminism and queer theory}}Queer and feminist theories, like other perspectives based on socially-based identities and gender, tend to overlap. Both of these theories are described as responses to the "essentializing" of gender and sexual identities, which lead to the oppression of those who do not conform to socially constructed gender norms.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender and Sexual Identity: Transcending Feminist and Queer Theory|last=Nagoshi|first=Julie|last2=Nagoshi|first2=Craig|last3=Brzuzy|first3=Stephanie|publisher=Springer|year=2013|isbn=9781461489658|location=New York|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This highlights their similarity in the view that gender-related identity is [[Social constructionism|socially constructed]]. There is thus an agreement that the [[oppression]] of women and sexual minority groups can be challenged by way of a self-constructive process that rejects the perceived inferiority of this group within the social order.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; While queer and feminist theories share several commonalities, this does not mean that they are easily commensurable, with some thinkers citing that they could even be an awkward pair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminism Meets Queer Theory|last=Weed|first=Elizabeth|last2=Schor|first2=Naomi|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0253332783|location=Bloomington, IN|pages=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One overlap of queer theory and feminist theory is through the recognition and influence of Judith Butler and Butler's cultivation of the relationship of gender and sexuality that has come to found the basis of queer theory concerns.  The analysis of society in relation to sexuality and gender, is a display of dominance that shows the way that biology is influenced by culture and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=Katherine|date=2005-03-01|title=Queer Theory|journal=Group Analysis|language=en|volume=38|issue=1|pages=67–81|doi=10.1177/0533316405049369|issn=0533-3164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key difference between the queer and feminist theories involves their respective scope. Feminist theory is only concerned about the issues affecting women and [[Women's empowerment|women empowerment]] while the subjects of queer theory are diverse and include women, homosexuals, transsexuals, and those considered deviants. Queer theory is also distinguished from feminist theory in the sense that it asserts identity as a conceptual category, serving as "a disciplinary apparatus that that pigeonholes the fluidity of the self into a politically docile normativity."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Politics of Everybody: Feminism, Queer Theory, and Marxism at the Intersection|last=Lewis|first=Holly|publisher=Zed Books, Ltd.|year=2016|isbn=9781783602889|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feminist position is that '[[identity politics]]' is a political error that occurs once a standpoint gets overemphasized or naturalized.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Criticism==
{{Essay|date=September 2018}}

Typically, critics of queer theory are concerned that the approach obscures or glosses altogether the material conditions that underpin discourse.&lt;ref name = "Edwards"&gt;{{Citation | last= Edwards | first= Tim | title= Queer Fears: Against the Cultural Turn | journal= Sexualities |volume= 1 | year= 1998 | postscript= &lt;!--none--&gt; | doi= 10.1177/136346098001004005 | issue= 4 | pages= 471–484}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Edwards argues that queer theory extrapolates too broadly from textual analysis in undertaking an examination of the social.&lt;ref name = "Edwards"/&gt;

Adam Green's critique is one approach to queer theory, that leans towards a sociological stance on the issue of sexuality; primarily and rather exc&lt;ref name="Green1"&gt;{{Citation | doi= 10.1023/A:1020976902569 | last= Green | first= Adam | title= Gay But Not Queer: Toward a Post-Queer Study of Sexuality | journal= Theory and Society | volume= 31 | issue= 4 | pages= 521–545 | year= 2002 | postscript= &lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; lusively, focusing on gay or lesbian subjects. Green argues that queer theory ignores the social and institutional conditions within which lesbians and gays live. For example, queer theory dismantles social contingency in some cases (homosexual subject positions) while recuperating social contingency in others (racialized subject positions). Thus, not all queer theoretical work is as faithful to its deconstructionist roots. Reflecting on this issue, Timothy Laurie suggests that "the desire to resist norms in some contemporary queer scholarship can never be entirely reconciled with an equally important challenge, that of producing both adequate and dynamic descriptions of ordinary events".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= The Ethics of Nobody I Know: Gender and the Politics of Description | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | journal=Qualitative Research Journal | volume= 14 | issue= 1 | pages= 64–78 | year= 2014 | url= https://www.academia.edu/6262250 | doi=10.1108/qrj-03-2014-0011| hdl= 10453/44221 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Queer theory's commitment to deconstruction makes it nearly impossible to speak of a "lesbian" or "gay" subject, since all social categories are denaturalized and reduced to discourse.&lt;ref name = "Gamson"&gt;{{Citation |last= Gamson

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, queer theory cannot be a framework for examining selves or subjectivities—including those that accrue by race and class—but rather, must restrict its analytic focus to discourse.&lt;ref name = "Green2"/&gt; Hence, [[sociology]] and queer theory are regarded as methodologically and [[Epistemology|epistemologically]] [[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurable]] frameworks&lt;ref name = Green2&gt;{{Citation | doi= 10.1111/j.1467-9558.2007.00296.x | last= Green | first= Adam | title= Queer Theory and Sociology: Locating the Subject and the Self in Sexuality Studies | journal= Sociological Theory | volume= 25 | issue= 1 | pages= 26–45| year= 2007 | postscript= &lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; by critics such as Adam Isaiah Green. Thus Green writes that, in an introductory section,&lt;ref&gt;Warner, M. 1993. "Introduction." Pp. viii–xxxi in Fear of a Queer Planet. Queer Politics and Social Theory, edited by M. Warner. Minnesota: University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Warner]] (1990s) draws out the possibility of queer theory as a kind of critical intervention in social theory (radical deconstructionism); despite this, he weaves back and forth between the reification and deconstruction of sexual identity. Green argues that Warner begins the volume by invoking an ethnic identity politics, solidified around a specific social cleavage and a discussion of the importance of deconstructing notions of lesbian and gay identities; but, despite its radical deconstructionism, it constructs the queer subject or self in largely conventional terms: as lesbian and gay people bound by homophobic institutions and practices.

So, one of the leading volumes of queer theory engages the subject via conventional sociological epistemologies that conceive of subject positions constituted through systems of stratification and organized around shared experience and identity.

In other way, for Ian Barnard,&lt;ref&gt;Barnard, I. 1999. "Queer Race." Social Semiotics 9(2):199–211.&lt;/ref&gt; any consideration of sexuality must include inextricability with racialized subjectivities. Adam Green argues that Barnard implicitly rejects the queer theoretical conceptions of sexuality on the grounds that such work fails to account for particularity of racialized sexualities. He reasons that the failure arises because queer theorists are themselves white, and therefore operate from the particularity of a white racial standpoint. Barnard aspires to recuperate an analysis of race in queer theory, proposing that the deconstructionist epistemology of queer theory can be used to decompose a white queerness (first) in order to recover a racialized queerness (second).
Thus, Adam Green argues that Barnard's attempt to bring social contingency into queer theory violates the core epistemological premise of queer theory; in fact, by proposing that queer theory capture racialized subject positions, Barnard reinstates what it means to be a person of colour. His critique of the white subject position of queer theorists is itself a testimony to the stability of the social order and the power of social categories to mark a particular kind of experience, of subjectivity and, in turn, of queer author. He backs down the road of a decidedly sociological analysis of subject position and the self.
Finally, [[Annamarie Jagose|Jagose]]&lt;ref&gt;Jagose, A. 1996. Queer Theory: An Introduction. New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Green observes that Jagose aims toward an analysis of social cleavages, including those accruing by race and ethnicity. Thus, on the one, Jagose underscores the strong deconstructionist epistemological premise of the term queer and queer theory more generally. Yet, she goes on to analyze identities and sexualities "inflected by heterosexuality, race, gender and ethnicity".
Thus Adam Green states that by advocating the incorporation of social contingency in this way, Jagose offers neither the critical edge of queer theory nor the clarity of standpoint theory. However, on the topic of race, Jagose asserted that for a black lesbian, the thing of utmost importance is her lesbianism, rather than her race. Many gays and lesbians of color attacked this approach, accusing it of re-inscribing an essentially white identity into the heart of gay or lesbian identity (Jagose, 1996).&lt;ref name=4-encylopedia&gt;{{cite web|title=Queer Theory and the Social Construction of Sexuality|work=Homosexuality|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=15 November 2011|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/homosexuality/#QueTheSocConSex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criticism of queer theory can be divided in three main ideas:&lt;ref&gt;Green, A. I. "Queer Theory and Sociology: Locating the Subject and the Self in Sexuality Studies". University of Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;
* It has a failing itineration, the "subjectless critique" of queer studies
* The unsustainable analysis of this failing self
* The methodological implication that scholars of sexuality end up reiterating and consolidating social categories

Green's views  suggest gay conservation and assimilation that derive from a more traditional perspective. His concerns regarding the potential loss of a critical edge by incorporating too much discourse on nonsexual identities is valid, however, theorists like Ruth Goldman and Cathy J. Cohen, think elsewise.

In Ruth Goldman's essay “Who Is That? Exploring Norms around Sexuality, Race, and Class in Queer Theory," she examines how rhetoric works to create a “normative discourse within queer theory” (169), and how that rhetoric serves to limit our perception of queer. In stark opposition to Green's critique, Goldman argues that in order to comply with queer theories intent to challenge the normal, it must provide a framework in which to challenge other oppressive norms that intersect with sexuality (i.e. racism, misogyny, classism, etc.). By acknowledging the intersection of multiple oppressions is to dismantle a single-issue framework, and thus, creating a platform for a more intensive analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3RwTCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=bell+hooks+queer+theory+#v=onepage&amp;q=bell%20hooks%20queer%20theory&amp;f=false|title=Queer Studies: A Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Anthology|last=Beemyn|first=Brett|last2=Eliason|first2=Michele|date=1996-01-01|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9780814712573|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theorist Cathy J. Cohen offers a complex critique in "Punks, Bulldaggers and Welfare Queens: The Radical Potential of Queer Politics" that supports Goldman's ideology. Queerness, according to Cohen, provides conceptualizations that break the traditional binary visibility. Unlike single-identity-based frameworks—failing to serve those with multi-oppressed identities—queerness has the potential to unite these aspects of self to spark a more cohesive understanding of oppression. Yet Cohen expresses concerns surrounding the dichotomy between queer and heterosexual. This binary has created a misdirection of dialogue surrounding power dynamics. Thus an undercomplicated understanding of power has been sexually categorized: all heterosexuals are characterized as privileged and all queers are deemed as oppressed. As a result, queer politics have prioritized only one factor, sexuality as the primary lens through which they structure their action. Encouraging this method of thinking rejects others that are in or in-between the margins. Cohen states that to fully grasp the advantages of queer theory, ideals need to be further radicalized; as well as, push an intersectional lens when analyzing issues.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.isabelcporras.com/punks%2Bbulldaggers%2Bcohen.pdf|title=Punks, Bulldaggers and Welfare Queens: The Radical Potential of Queer Politics|last=Cohen|first=J.

Green argues that queer is itself an identity category that some self-identified "queer theorists" and "queer activists" use to consolidate a subject-position outside of the normalizing regimes of gender and sexuality.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;{{Citation | last= Green | first= Adam Isaiah | title= Remembering Foucault: Queer Theory &amp; Disciplinary Power | journal= Sexualities | volume= 13 | issue= 3 | year= 2010 | postscript= &lt;!--none--&gt; | doi= 10.1177/1363460709364321 | pages= 316–337}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These examples call into question the degree to which identity categories need be thought of as negative, in the evaluative sense of that term, as they underscore the self-determining potentials of the care of the self – an idea advanced first by Foucault in Volumes II and III of The History of Sexuality.

The role of queer theory, and specifically its replacement of historical and sociological scholarship on lesbian and gay people's lives with the theorising of lesbian and gay issues, and the displacement of gay and lesbian studies by gender and queer studies, has been criticised by activist and writer [[Larry Kramer]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser, Charles, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090502193413/http://www.advocate.com/exclusive_detail_ektid81256.asp Larry Kramer's Case Against "Queer"] Advocate.com, April 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/04/28/kramer|title=Inside Higher Ed's News|website=www.insidehighered.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/|title=The Daily Beast|website=The Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kramer reports on a book by Richard Godbeer, a professor of history and gender studies at the University of Miami, called The Overflowing of Friendship. Kramer criticizes Godbeer's account of 18th century Colonial times. Kramer writes, "Godbeer is hell-bent on convincing us that two men in Colonial America could have exceedingly obsessive and passionate relationships (he called them, variously, 'sentimental,' 'loving,' 'romantic') . . . [men would] spend many a night in bed together talking their hearts out, without the issue of sex arising in any way."&lt;ref name=kramer&gt;{{Citation|last=Kramer|first=Larry|title=Queer Theory's Heist of Our History|journal=Gay &amp; Lesbian Review Worldwide|year=2011|volume=16|issue=5|url=http://www.glreview.com/article.php?articleid=166|accessdate=5 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215092327/http://www.glreview.com/article.php?articleid=166|archivedate=15 December 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kramer does not agree with this theory and believes that the notion the same-sex sexual relationships and experiences existed. Relatedly, educator and writer [[John D'Emilio|John D’Emilio]] argues that gay identity has not always existed and the emergence of gay men and lesbian was rather a later development associated with the spread of capitalism in the 19th century. A capitalist system of free labor propagated in society and the independent unit of the nuclear family no longer became a necessary economical unit. As the family in turn took on a new role as an emotional and affective unit and separated from the world of work and production, the idea of sexuality separated from that of procreation. Sexuality, no longer bound by the imperative of reproduction, experienced a change and allowed people to think differently about desire, thus creating conditions allowing for the expression of homosexual behavior and the construction of a gay identity.&lt;ref&gt;D’Emilio, J. (1983). Capitalism and gay identity. ''Families in the US: Kinship and domestic politics'', 131-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism is that queer theory, in part because it typically has recourse to a very technical jargon, is written by a narrow elite for that narrow elite. It is therefore class biased and also, in practice, only really known and referenced at universities and colleges (Malinowitz, 1993).&lt;ref name=4-encylopedia /&gt; In addition, those in a position of power, have access to modes of communication where they can express their interpretation, definitions and descriptions of topics, sometimes regardless of the accuracy. This persons of power are given “privileged act of naming.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hooks | first1 = Bell | year = 1991 | title = Theory as liberatory practice | url = | journal = Yale Journal of Law and Feminism | volume = 4 | issue = | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, this can obscure the perception of reality for those in institutionalized settings. Academia often neglects works of theory by women or men of color. This can be attributed to the fact that institutions have imposed standards of critical evaluations for what is a work of theory and what is not. These standards have led to appropriation of work that was deemed unfit and have created a stark exclusion of people who can access the material. This turns the mass public against the idea of understanding theory; an important aspect in relation to understanding practice. The institutionalization of queer theory has imposed a threat of taming and domesticating critical energy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

An initial criticism on queer theory is that precisely "queer" does not refer to any specific sexual status or gender object choice. For example, Halperin (1995)&lt;ref name=4-encylopedia /&gt;  allows that straight persons may be "queer," which some believe, robs gays and lesbians of the distinctiveness of what causes them to be marginalized. It desexualizes identity, when the issue is precisely about a sexual identity (Jagose, 1996).&lt;ref name=4-encylopedia /&gt; On the other hand, Michael Warner argues that the objective of queer is to challenge normalness not heterosexuality. This ties back into Cohen's point about the power dichotomy. Straight persons can be oppressed for behaviors that are seen as sexually deviant as well. One example is the “welfare queen,” a woman of color who is marginalized for her race, sexuality and gender—all identities which intersect to create this kind of oppression.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The critique of queer theory is not limited to the US. Queer theory was repeatedly criticized by the Vatican. Pope Francis spoke about "ideological colonization" by which he meant that queer theory, and more broadly critical gender studies, threatens traditional family and fertile heterosexuality. France was one of the first countries where this claim became widespread when catholic movements marched in the streets of Paris against the bill on gay marriage and adoption. [[Bruno Perreau]] in [http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=27481 Queer Theory: The French Response] &lt;ref&gt;Queer Theory: The French Response, Stanford University Press, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; has shown that this fear has deep historical roots in France. He argues that the rejection of queer theory expresses anxieties about national identity and minority politics. Minority groups could betray the nation and prefer transnational identities. Perreau maintains that queer theory shows that being part of a group requires the ability to critique one's own belonging. This is largely unbearable to reactionary movements, Perreau argues, all the more because queer theory is ironically largely based on French theory.

'''Retiming''' is the technique of moving the structural location of [[Latch (electronic)|latches]] or registers in a [[digital circuit]] to improve its performance, area, and/or [[power optimization (EDA)|power]] characteristics in such a way that preserves its functional behavior at its outputs.  Retiming was first described by [[Charles E. Leiserson]] and [[James B. Saxe]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/context/96547/0&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique uses a [[directed graph]] where the vertices represent asynchronous combinational blocks and the directed edges represent a series of registers or latches (the number of registers or latches can be zero). Each vertex has a value corresponding to the delay through the combinational circuit it represents. After doing this, one can attempt to optimize the circuit by pushing registers from output to input and vice versa - much like [[bubble pushing]].  Two operations can be used - deleting a register from each input of a vertex while adding a register to all outputs, and conversely adding a register to each input of vertex and deleting a register from all outputs. In all cases, if the rules are followed, the circuit will have the same functional behavior as it did before retiming.

==Formal description==

The initial formulation of the retiming problem as described by Leiserson and Saxe is as follows. Given a [[directed graph]] &lt;math&gt;G:=(V,E)&lt;/math&gt; whose vertices represent [[logic gates]] or combinational delay elements in a circuit, assume there is a directed edge &lt;math&gt;e:=(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; between two elements that are connected directly or through one or more registers.  Let the ''weight'' of each edge &lt;math&gt;w(e)&lt;/math&gt; be the number of registers present along edge &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; in the initial circuit.  Let &lt;math&gt;d(v)&lt;/math&gt; be the [[propagation delay]] through vertex &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;.  The goal in retiming is to compute an integer ''lag'' value &lt;math&gt;r(v)&lt;/math&gt; for each vertex such that the retimed weight &lt;math&gt;w_r(e):=w(e)+r(v)-r(u)&lt;/math&gt; of every edge is non-negative. There is a proof that this preserves the output functionality.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;C. E. Leiserson, J. B. Saxe, "Retiming Synchronous Circuitry," Algorithmica, Vol. 6, No. 1, pp. 5-35, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minimizing the clock period with network flow===

The most common use of retiming is to minimize the [[clock period]].  A simple technique to optimize the clock period is to search for the minimum feasible period (e.g. using [[binary search]]).

The feasibility of a clock period &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; can be checked in one of several ways.  The [[linear program]] below is feasible if and only if &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is a feasible clock period.  Let &lt;math&gt;W(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; be the minimum number of registers along any path from &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; (if such a path exists), and &lt;math&gt;D(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum delay along any path from &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; with W(u,v) registers.  The dual of this program is a [[minimum cost circulation problem]], which can be solved efficiently as a network problem.  The limitations of this approach arise from the enumeration and size of the &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; matrices.

{| 
| Given 
| colspan="2" | &lt;math&gt;w(e), W(u,v), D(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; and a target clock period &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Find 
| colspan="2" | &lt;math&gt;r(v):V \to \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Such that
|-
|
| &lt;math&gt;r(u) - r(v)&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\le w(e)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| &lt;math&gt;r(u) - r(v)&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\le W(u,v) - 1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;D(u,v) &gt; T&lt;/math&gt;
|}

===Minimizing the clock period with MILP===

Alternatively, feasibility of a clock period &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as a mixed-integer [[linear program]] (MILP).  A solution will exist and a valid lag function &lt;math&gt;r(v)&lt;/math&gt; will be returned if and only if the period is feasible.

{| 
| Given 
| colspan="2" | &lt;math&gt;w(e), d(v)&lt;/math&gt; and a target clock period &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Find 
| colspan="2" | &lt;math&gt;r(v):V \to \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R(v):V \to \mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Such that
|-
|
| &lt;math&gt;r(v) - R(V)&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\le -d(v)/T&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| &lt;math&gt;R(v) - r(v)&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\le 1&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| &lt;math&gt;r(u) - r(v)&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\le w(e)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| &lt;math&gt;R(u) - R(v)&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\le w(e) - d(v)/T&lt;/math&gt;
|}

===Other formulations and extensions===

Alternate formulations allow the minimization of the register count and the minimization of the register count under a delay constraint.  The initial paper includes extensions that allow the consideration of fan-out sharing and a more general delay model.  Subsequent work has addressed the inclusion of register delays,&lt;ref name="two"&gt;K. N. Lalgudi, M. C. Papaefthymiou, {{doi-inline|10.1109/43.664222|Retiming edge-triggered circuits under general delay models}}, [[IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems]], vol.16, no.12, pp.1393-1408, Dec. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; load-dependent delay models,&lt;ref name="two"/&gt; and hold constraints.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;M. C. Papaefthymiou, {{doi-inline|10.1145/288548.289060|Asymptotically efficient retiming under setup and hold constraints}}, IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems==

Retiming has found industrial use, albeit sporadic.  Its primary drawback is that the state encoding of the circuit is destroyed, making debugging, testing, and verification substantially more difficult.  Some retimings may also require complicated initialization logic to have the circuit start in an identical initial state.  Finally, the changes in the circuit's topology have consequences in other logical and physical synthesis steps that make [[design closure]] difficult.

==Alternatives==

Clock skew scheduling is a related technique for optimizing sequential circuits.  Whereas retiming relocates the structural position of the registers, clock skew scheduling moves their temporal position by scheduling the arrival time of the clock signals.  The lower bound of the achievable minimum clock period of both techniques is the maximum mean cycle time (i.e. the total combinational delay along any path divided by the number of registers along it).

'''Shallow reading''' refers to social practices in which people acquire information or entertainment quickly from texts, images or other meaningful forms, individual or combination, by using various modern media. Shallow reading as a representational form of [[Postmodernism|post-modern]] [[Media culture|mass culture]] reflects a transition of expense principle tendency from [[print culture]] towards [[visual culture]].

== Background ==
With the continuous update of advanced media technology and popularization of [[Internet]], people are stepping into mobile Internet era shifting. In this process, an obvious change is that traditional reading mode is gradually shifting to shallow reading. The prevalence of shallow reading has attracted attention of media, publishing and library fields.

== Features ==
'''1. Superficial'''

In order to enable people obtain useful information during the process of quick browsing, the target materials of shallow reading are usually very clear and easy to understand as well as with clear-cut topics.

'''2. Visual'''

Objectives of shallow reading are often short texts with illustrations and pictures even images and/or video without text captions.

'''3. Recreational'''

For deep readers, traditional reading is a process of thinking training and a cultivation of aesthetic culture while Shallow reading gets rid of the seriousness of deep reading and mainly aim at facilitating readers acquire information and entertainment in a relaxing and interactive atmosphere.

A '''shared universe''' or '''shared world''' is a set of creative works where more than one writer (or other artist) independently contributes a work that can stand alone but fits into the joint development of the storyline, characters, or world of the overall project. It is common in genres like [[science fiction]].&lt;ref name="Nielsen1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nielsen|first=Jakob|title=Multimedia and Hypertext: The Internet and Beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KgZXCCfP0rQC&amp;pg=PA120|accessdate=5 August 2015|year=1995|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=978-0-12-518408-3|pages=120–|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180324122455/https://books.google.com/books?id=KgZXCCfP0rQC&amp;pg=PA120|archivedate=March 24, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It differs from [[collaborative writing]] where multiple artists are working together on the same work and from [[Fictional crossover|crossovers]] where the works and characters are independent except for a single meeting.

The term ''shared universe'' is also used within comics to reflect the overall milieu created by the comic book publisher in which characters, events, and premises from one product line appear in other product lines in a [[media franchise]].

A specific kind of shared universe that is published across a variety of media (e.g. novels, films, role-playing games, etc.), each of them contributing to the growth, history, and status of the setting is called an "imaginary entertainment environment."&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, Daniel.

The term has also been used in a wider, non-literary sense to convey [[interdisciplinary]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Contingencies of Professional Differentiation |author=Smith, Harvey L. |journal=The American Journal of Sociology |date=Jan 1958 |volume=63 |issue=4 |page=410 |doi=10.1086/222264}}&lt;/ref&gt; or social commonality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Repetition in Conversation: Toward a Poetics of Talk |author=Tannen, Deborah |year=1987 |journal=Language |issue=63 |volume=63 |pages=574–605 |doi=10.2307/415006 |jstor=415006 |publisher=Language, Vol. 63, No. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; often in the context of a "shared universe of discourse".&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book|last=Blumenthal|first=David R.|title=Facing the Abusing God: A Theology of Protest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DfNKpfyAOH0C&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=5 August 2015|year=1993|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-25464-3|pages=34–|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180324122455/https://books.google.com/books?id=DfNKpfyAOH0C&amp;pg=PA34|archivedate=March 24, 2018|df=mdy-all}}

== Definitions ==
Fiction in some [[Mass media|media]], such as most [[television programs]] and many [[comic book]] titles, is understood{{By whom|date=December 2017}} to require the contribution of multiple authors and does not by itself create a shared universe and is considered a collaborative art form. Incidental appearances, such as that of [[d'Artagnan]] in ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'', are considered literary [[cameo appearance]]s. More substantial interaction between characters from different sources is often marketed as a [[fictional crossover|crossover]]. While crossovers occur in a shared universe, not all crossovers are intended to merge their settings' [[back-stories]] and are instead used for marketing, parody, or to explore [[Alternate history|"what-if" scenarios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |date=Mar 1994 |title=Super Heroes: A Modern Mythology |author=Reynolds, Richard |isbn=978-0-87805-694-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Comics &amp; Culture: analytical and theoretical approaches to comics |author=Magnussen, Anne and Hans-christian Christiansen, eds. |publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press |date=Apr 2000 |isbn=978-87-7289-580-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can become difficult for writers contributing to a shared universe to maintain consistency and avoid contradicting details in earlier works, especially when a shared universe grows to be very large. The version deemed "official" by the author or company controlling the setting is known as [[canon (fiction)|canon]]. Not all shared universes have a controlling entity capable of or interested in determining canonicity, and not all fans agree with these determinations when they occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Comic Book Culture: Fanboys and True Believers |author=Pustz, Matthew |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Fanon (fiction)|fanon]] may instead find some degree of consensus within the setting's [[fandom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=All Shapes of Hunger: Teenagers and Fanfiction |journal=Voya |author=Moore, Rebecca C. |date=Apr 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some writers, in an effort to ensure that a canon can be established and to keep details of the setting believable, employ tools to correct contradictions and errors that result from multiple contributors working over a long period of time. One such tool is [[retcon]]ning, short for "retroactive continuity", which resolves errors in continuity that came about through previously-written conflicting material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Retcon Tricks |journal=Star Trek Monthly Magazine |author=Jones, Nick |date=Feb 2002 |pages=18–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Readers may also object when a story or series is integrated into a shared universe, feeling it "requir[es] one hero's fans to buy other heroes' titles".&lt;ref name="BurtCL"&gt;{{cite journal |title="Blown To Atoms or Reshaped At Will": Recent Books About Comics |author=Burt, Stephen |journal=College Literature |date=Winter 2005 |volume=32 |page=166 |doi=10.1353/lit.2005.0004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|List of fictional universes in literature}}
The expansion of existing material into a shared universe is not restricted to settings licensed from movies and television. For example, [[Larry Niven]] opened his [[Known Space]] setting to other writers initially because he considered his lack of military experience prevented him from adequately describing the wars between mankind and the [[Kzinti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Scribner, Ted|title=Novel Collaborations |url=http://www.larryniven.org/collaborations.shtml |accessdate=2007-01-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070110055400/http://www.larryniven.org/collaborations.shtml &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-01-10|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree to which he has made the setting available for other writers became a topic of controversy, when [[Elf Sternberg]] created an [[erotic literature|erotic short story]] set in Known Space following an author's note from Niven indicating that "[i]f you want more Known Space stories, you'll have to write them yourself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Ringworld Engineers |author=Niven, Larry |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niven has since clarified that his setting is still to be used only "under restricted circumstances and with permission",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ladies and Gentlemen, Dr. Larry Niven |publisher=Slashdot |date=2003-03-10 |accessdate=2007-01-13 |url=http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/03/10/167206&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=134&amp;tid=192 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213110227/http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03%2F03%2F10%2F167206&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=134&amp;tid=192 |archivedate=February 13, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which Niven granted to the several authors of the [[Man-Kzin Wars]] series. By contrast, author [[Eric Flint]] has edited and published collaborations with fan fiction writers directly, expanding his [[1632 series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1632: About this Site |author=Eves, David |date=Sep 2005 |url=http://1632.org/About.html |accessdate=2007-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A setting may also be expanded in a similar manner after the death of its creator, although this posthumous expansion does not meet some strict definitions of a shared universe. One such example is [[August Derleth]]'s development of the [[Cthulhu Mythos]] from the writings of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], an approach whose result is considered by some to be "completely dissimilar" to Lovecraft's own works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tierney |first=Richard L. |title=The Derleth Mythos |publisher=Nightscapes |date=2004-09-09 |url=http://www.epberglund.com/RGttCM/nightscapes/NS04/hplnf3.htm |accessdate=2007-01-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209052219/http://www.epberglund.com/RGttCM/nightscapes/NS04/hplnf3.htm |archivedate=February 9, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Less controversial posthumous expansions include [[Ruth Plumly Thompson]]'s and later authors' sequels to [[L. Frank Baum]]'s ''[[Land of Oz|Oz]]'' stories and the further development of [[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[The Foundation Series|Foundation]]'' universe by [[Greg Bear]], [[Gregory Benford]], and [[David Brin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Following Asimov's Foundation |publisher=Cyberhaven |year=1999 |url=http://www.cyberhaven.com/books/sciencefiction/bear.html |accessdate=2007-06-14 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070811055828/http://cyberhaven.com/books/sciencefiction/bear.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other published works of this nature take the form of a series of short-story [[anthologies]] with occasional standalone novels. Examples include [[Robert Lynn Asprin]]'s [[Thieves' World]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Conversation with Lynn Abbey |author=Silver, Steven H. |publisher=SF Site |url=http://www.sfsite.com/11a/la139.htm |date=Oct 2002 |accessdate=2007-06-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070426102845/http://www.sfsite.com/11a/la139.htm |archivedate=April 26, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[C.

[[File:MasterComicsNo21.jpg|thumb|Early example: [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] and [[Bulletman]] join forces to battle [[Captain Nazi]], thereby establishing a shared continuity within the [[Fawcett Comics|Fawcett]] "universe".]]
Within comics, the term ''shared universe'' has been used to reflect the overall milieu created by the comic book publisher in which characters, events, and premises from one product line appear in other product lines in a [[media franchise]].

By 1961, [[Marvel Comics]] writer and editor [[Stan Lee]], working with artists [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Steve Ditko]], merged the bulk of the publisher's comics characters into the [[Marvel Universe]].&lt;ref name="BurtCL" /&gt; Marvel sets its stories in an increasing number of [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate realities]], each with an assigned number in a greater "[[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]]".&lt;ref name="MarvMulti"&gt;{{cite book |title=Marvel Encyclopedia Volume 6: Fantastic Four |publisher=Marvel Comics |date=2004-11-24 |isbn=978-0-7851-1480-2 |author=writer, Kit Kiefer.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DC Comics]] and Marvel have also periodically co-published series in which their respective characters meet and interact. These [[intercompany crossovers]] have typically been written as self-limiting events that avoid implying that the DC Universe and Marvel Universe co-exist. Exceptions include the twenty-four comics released under the [[metafiction]]al [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] [[Amalgam Comics]] in 1996, depicting a shared universe populated by hybridizations of the two companies' characters. Marvel has since referred to this as part of its setting's greater multiverse by labeling it Earth-692.&lt;ref name="MarvMulti" /&gt;

Although DC and Marvel's shared universe approaches to comics have set them apart from competitors in the industry,&lt;ref name="Fowler"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fowler |first=Brant W. |title=Myth Conceptions: 'Summer Blockbusters' |publisher=Silver Bullet Comics |date=2006-06-05 |url=http://www.silverbulletcomics.com/news/story.php?a=1719 |accessdate=2007-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026024638/http://www.silverbulletcomics.com/news/story.php?a=1719 |archivedate=October 26, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; other companies have attempted similar models.

== Universes in films and television ==
{{Main|List of fictional shared universes in film and television}}
Universes in films (or television) mostly consist of a franchise featuring an umbrella of multiple franchises (film or television) set within the same continuity, each franchise within telling its own stand-alone story focusing on a different character (or group of characters), as well as featuring its own cast, of directors, writers, while also being part of a coherent, non-contradictory continuity shared with the other works. Fictional universes with major presence in films are referred to as '''cinematic universes''', while fictional universes with major presence in television are refereed to as '''television universes'''. Universes with major presence in films and television, generally are refereed as cinematic universes as that's the medium that reaches the most audiences. Some film and television universes are accompanied by video games, and print works such as novels or comics, telling additional canonical stories set within the same continuity.

An early universe in cinema history was the ''[[Universal Monsters#Recurring cast and characters|Universal Monsters]]'' series of ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'', ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'', ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]'' and ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'', which ran from 1931 to 1951 and featured recurring cast and characters.

Some universes in film have originated as film adaptations of novels, such as the [[James Bond in film|''James Bond'' film series]] based on the spy novels by [[Ian Fleming]]. The films adapt some elements from the novels, however they are not direct adaptations, additionally they were not adapted in the same order as the books released. The first film in the series is ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' (1962), and has produced 23 sequels, with the most recent one being ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' (2015). Due to the series spanning more than 50 years, [[James Bond]] has been portrayed by six actors, all the other frequent cast of characters has also gone through replacements, additionally after all Fleming's novels were adapted the series shifted towards original scripts. However, all films are set within a single, coherent fictional continuity, even if the writers, directors and cast change between films. Aspects of the fictional universe are retained between films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/every-james-bond-movie-ranked-worst-best/|title=Every James Bond Movie Ever, Ranked Worst To Best|date=April 16, 2017|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170717200714/http://screenrant.com/every-james-bond-movie-ranked-worst-best/|archivedate=July 17, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Planet of the Apes]]'' film series also originated as a film adaptation of the novel of the same name, taking many creative liberties. The original film titled ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968)|Planet of the Apes]]'' (1968) focused on present-day astronaut George Taylor landing on a mysterious planet ruled by apes, which is revealed to be a future planet Earth at the end of the film. The sequel ''Beneath'' focused on Brent, an astronaut sent on a rescue mission to save Taylor. The third film ''Escape'' introduced [[time travel]] and shifted the focus towards the apes Zira and Cornelius, who appeared as supporting characters in the previous films, as they travel to the past in Taylor's spaceship. The fourth and fifth films, ''Conquest'' and ''Battle'', focus on Zira and Cornelius' son Cesar leading the up-rise against the humans and to the future depicted in the original film. A television series and an animated series are also considered part of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/planet-of-the-apes-a-timeline-and-an-explanation-1603218068|title=Planet of the Apes: A Timeline and an Explanation|first=Annalee|last=Newitz|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713112149/http://io9.gizmodo.com/planet-of-the-apes-a-timeline-and-an-explanation-1603218068|archivedate=July 13, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the ''Planet of the Apes'' in the original timeline before the time travel occurred was explained in a prequel-reboot film series with the ape Cesar becoming the main protagonist again, with the story focused on his life from childhood to an old ape, and how the conflict between the apes and the humans, started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2016/12/9/13899502/planet-of-the-apes-series-war-dawn-rise-reboot-franchise-right|title=The Planet of the Apes series is quietly showing the world how to reboot a franchise right|publisher=The Verge|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170610123359/https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2016/12/9/13899502/planet-of-the-apes-series-war-dawn-rise-reboot-franchise-right|archivedate=June 10, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Star Wars]]'' film series was created by [[George Lucas]], produced by his self-funded production company Lucasfilm. It originated with the film ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'' (1977), followed by two sequels under the subtitles ''[[Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980) and ''[[Episode VI: Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983); together, those three films are known as the original trilogy and focuses on [[Luke Skywalker]], [[Han Solo]] and [[Princess Leia]]. The prequel trilogy composed of ''[[Episode I: The Phantom Menace]]'' (1999), ''[[Episode II: Attack of the Clones]]'' (2002), and ''[[Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]'' (2005) expanded the series into a Saga, and focused on Luke Skywalker's father [[Anakin Skywalker]], new cast members portrayed younger versions of characters from the Original trilogy, while other actors returned to their original trilogy roles. On television, the lore was expanded through animation, the animated film titled ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' (2008) served as the pilot of an [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|animated series of the same name]] (2008-2014). Lucas was deeply creatively involved in the previously mentioned works, but he ceased creative involvement with the ''Star Wars'' franchise in 2014. Lucasfilm announced that from April 2014, only such previously mentioned works would be considered canonical, along all of the fictional works released after such date. The animated series ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'' (2014-2018), was the first work released after. A sequel trilogy formed by ''[[Episode VII: The Force Awakens]]'' (2015), ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi|Episode VIII: The Last Jedi]]'' (2017) and the upcoming ''[[Star Wars: Episode IX|Episode IX]]'' (2019) featured many returning cast members along newcomers. The films’ main saga is conformed of the original, prequel, and sequel trilogies. A concurrent spin-off film series, known as the anthology films, expands the stories of plot points and characters from the main series. Additionally the series expanded into video games, comics, and novels, telling original stories based on the franchise, classifying it as an imaginary entertainment environment,&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, Daniel. [http://www.worldcat.org/title/fantasy-role-playing-game-a-new-performing-art/oclc/45575501 ''The Fantasy Role-Playing Game: A New Performing Art''] (Jefferson, NC: McFarland. 2001) pp. 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt; where the films share the same [[Star Wars canon|continuity]] as all the other media formats, regardless of the different media formats. Lucasfilm's "Story Group" coordinates a cohesive story-telling and ensures consistency and synergy by avoiding plot holes between all the film and non-film works. The ''[[Star Wars Legends]]'' brand is used to brand all the re-prints of non-canonical works (television films, animated series, video-games, comics, and novels) of the franchise which were produced and/or ceased production before April 2014. Lucas himself considered the ''Legends'' works as non-canonical because considered them to diminish his films meaning by not adhering to his vision. Albeit, Lucas did include a few of the ''Legends'' elements that he supported within his works, such as characters and places which made those included elements canonical. Storytellers after Lucas have also incorporated ''Legends'' elements in their stories, sometimes with the help of the original creators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/star-wars-story-group-shared-universe/|title=How Star Wars Mastered the Shared Universe|date=May 4, 2017|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517220938/http://screenrant.com/star-wars-story-group-shared-universe/|archivedate=May 17, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for comic book based films, there are two cinematic universes based on [[Marvel Comics]] characters, both set within a different continuity. The [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]], which originated in 2000, is the longest-running superhero film franchise to be set within the same continuity. The [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] has the most films, as well as [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|multiple TV shows]] and a separate run of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in comics|tie-in comics]] that co-exist and share the same continuity, making the MCU an imaginary entertainment environment. The [[DC Extended Universe]] is a movie franchise that encompasses different movies series based on the [[DC Comics]] characters, all of them sharing a continuity.

Writer/director [[Kevin Smith]] created a fictional universe used in several of his films, as well as comics and a television series:  the [[View Askewniverse]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The View Askewniverse | url=http://www.viewaskew.com | website=[[View Askewniverse|The View Askewniverse]] | access-date=December 29, 2017 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216205425/http://www.viewaskew.com/ | archivedate=December 16, 2017 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is named for Smith's production company, [[View Askew Productions]]. The characters [[Jay and Silent Bob]] (played by Smith) appear in almost all the View Askewniverse media, and characters from one story often reappear or are referred to in others.  Recurring characters, settings, and motifs of the View Askewniverse first appeared in Smith's debut film, [[Clerks]], in 1994.

Among the most successful novel-to-film adaptations are the film trilogies of ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'' (2012–2014) and ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' (2001–2003), all of which were directed by [[Peter Jackson]], while serving as faithful adaptations of the novels by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] (especially ''The Lord of the Rings''). The first work in the series was ''[[The Hobbit (novel)|The Hobbit novel]]'' published in 1937. The novels focused on the hobbits [[Bilbo Baggins]] and his nephew [[Frodo Baggins]], as well as the wizard [[Gandalf]], among other species such as dwarves and elves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/23/14055580/lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-movies-peter-jackson-15th-anniversary|title=Looking back on what made the Lord of the Rings trilogy special, 15 years later|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826115748/https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/23/14055580/lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-movies-peter-jackson-15th-anniversary|archivedate=August 26, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Videogames taking place between the films of the saga have been produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/games/middle-earth_shadow_of_war/b/playstation4/default.aspx|title=Middle-earth: Shadow of War - PlayStation 4 - www.GameInformer.com|website=www.gameinformer.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826123803/https://www.gameinformer.com/games/middle-earth_shadow_of_war/b/playstation4/default.aspx|archivedate=August 26, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cinematic universe consisting of films whose titles are the names of songs by [[Simon and Garfunkel]] was proposed and publicly discussed by movie creators in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Holloway | first=Daniel | date=May 26, 2017 | title=Edgar Wright, Dwayne Johnson, Rian Johnson, Marc Webb, Lin-Manuel Miranda Plot Simon &amp; Garfunkel Movie Universe | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/edgar-wright-simon-garfunkel-1202446412/ | access-date=December 19, 2017 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222051923/http://variety.com/2017/film/news/edgar-wright-simon-garfunkel-1202446412/ | archivedate=December 22, 2017 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Filmmaker [[Edgar Wright]] wrote that the Simon and Garfunkel cinematic universe could begin with his movie ''[[Baby Driver]]'' and [[Marc Webb]]'s ''[[The Only Living Boy in New York (film)|The Only Living Boy in New York]]'', and Wright suggested creation of a film named ''[[So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Butler | first=Will | date=May 27, 2017 | title=Edgar Wright, Dwayne Johnson and Star Wars’ Rian Johnson plan Simon and Garfunkel movie universe | work=[[NME]] | url=http://www.nme.com/news/edgar-wright-dwayne-simon-garfunkel-movie-universe-2079826 | access-date=December 19, 2017 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222052626/http://www.nme.com/news/edgar-wright-dwayne-simon-garfunkel-movie-universe-2079826 | archivedate=December 22, 2017 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, other writers, directors, and actors expressed their interest in making films within the universe, such as [[Rian Johnson]]: ''[[Keep the Customer Satisfied (song)|Keep the Customer Satisfied]]''; [[Lin-Manuel Miranda]]: ''[[Cecilia (Simon &amp; Garfunkel song)|Cecilia]]''; Marc Webb and [[Dwayne Johnson]]: ''[[I Am a Rock]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Bui | first=Hoai-Tran | date=May 29, 2017| title=Edgar Wright Recruits Everyone for a Totally Real, Not a Joke Simon and Garfunkel Song Title Universe | work=[[Slashfilm]] | url=http://www.slashfilm.com/simon-and-garfunkel-movie-universe/ | access-date=December 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Universes in television ====
This refers to universes that are based on television shows without any films. Television series may lead to a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off series]] set in the same universe, often focusing on a single character from the original. The American sitcom ''[[Cheers]]'' led to two spin-off series based on its characters, in the form of ''[[Frasier]]'' and ''[[The Tortellis]]''.

A significant example of shared universes among television shows is the [[Tommy Westphall#The Tommy Westphall Universe Hypothesis|Tommy Westphall Universe Hypothesis]], which suggests that hundreds of American television series take place in the same universe. It builds from the assumption that when an actor playing a character from one series guest-stars in a second series, in character, both of those series must take place in the same universe. The theory takes its name from a character in the final episode of ''[[St. Elsewhere]]'', where the common interpretation of the events of that finale is that the entire ''St. Elsewhere'' universe – including all connected series – exist only within Westphall's imagination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last1=Gravely|first1=Gary|title=A Multiverse of Narratives: Possible Worlds Theory and Authorship From the Lone Artist to Corporate Authors|date=August 2015|institution=[[Middle Tennessee State University]]|via=ProQuest Dissertations Publishing|location=Murfreesboro, TN|pages=166-167|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1718228166|degree=Ph.D.|id=No.3719757}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off media]] from ''[[Doctor Who]]'', known as the "[[Whoniverse]]", has relatively little consistency given its division into [[audio play]]s produced by [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] and the BBC, the [[Virgin New Adventures|New Adventures]] universe novel, or a universe based on comics published in ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' and other publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gary Russell two |publisher=BBC |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2004/01/01/13770.shtml |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120721053617/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2004/01/01/13770.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-21 |date=2004-01-01 |accessdate=2007-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Universes in animated films and animated series ===
{{Main|List of fictional universes in animation and comics}}
The [[Mickey Mouse universe]] dates back to the 1930s when the animated cartoon was expanded into a newspaper strip. Although the characters occasionally portray other roles and with other names, the writers address this discrepancy by thinking of the characters as being "employed" by Disney as actors. [[Walt Disney]], when asked whether or not [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Minnie Mouse]] were married, replied that the mice were indeed married in their "private li[ves]", but that they sometimes appeared as boyfriend and girlfriend for "screen purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The [[Pixar universe]] is an elaborate [[fan theory]] suggesting that all [[Pixar]] animated movies take place in the same universe. At the 2015 [[Disney D23|D23 Expo]], during the "Pixar Secrets Revealed" panel, director [[Mark Andrews (filmmaker)|Mark Andrews]] rejected the theory, with ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]'' co-director [[Ronnie del Carmen]] adding "Do you know what kinds of meetings we'd have to have to make sure all our movies line up?!"&lt;ref name=Disney&gt;{{cite news|title=10 Things We Learned from the 'Pixar Secrets Revealed' Panel|url=http://blogs.disney.com/oh-my-disney/2015/08/16/10-things-we-learned-from-the-pixar-secrets-revealed-panel/|accessdate=August 17, 2015|newspaper=Oh My Disney|date=August 16, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150817120038/http://blogs.disney.com/oh-my-disney/2015/08/16/10-things-we-learned-from-the-pixar-secrets-revealed-panel/|archivedate=August 17, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Originating in video games and the internet ==
The influence of the [[Internet]] on [[collaborative fiction|collaborative]] and [[interactive fiction]] has also resulted in a large number of amateur shared universe settings.

==Early life==
Suzanne Césaire (née Roussi) was born on 11 August 1915 in Poterie, Martinique, to Flore Roussi (née William), a school teacher, and Benoït Roussi, a sugar factory worker.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Bounoure, “Suzanne Césaire et la question de la civilisation”, ContreTemps, no. 6, May 2010, http://www.contretemps.eu/wp-content/uploads/01-160-CT6-SYLLEPSE-126-139-1-6.pdf, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

She began her education at her local primary school in Rivière-Salée in Martinique (which still had the status of a French colonial territory at that time), before attending a girls’ boarding school in the capital, Fort-de-France. Having completed her secondary education, she went to study literature in Toulouse, France, and then in Paris at the prestigious École normale supérieure from 1936-1938.

==University and marriage to Aimé Césaire==

During her first year as a student in Paris, Suzanne (then still named Roussi) meet [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]], who introduced her to [[Aimé Césaire]], a fellow student at the École normale supérieure.&lt;ref&gt;http://azmartinique.com/fr/tout-savoir/personnages-celebres/suzanne-roussi-cesaire&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, on 10 July 1937, the couple married at the town hall of the 14th arrondissement in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;http://next.liberation.fr/livres/2009/04/23/suzanne-l-aimee-de-cesaire_554226&lt;/ref&gt; During their studies, the Césaires were both part of the editorial team of the militant journal, ''[[L'Étudiant noir]]''. In 1938 the couple had their first child. The following year they returned to Martinique where they both took up teaching jobs at the Lycée Schoelcher.&lt;ref&gt;http://azmartinique.com/fr/tout-savoir/personnages-celebres/suzanne-roussi-cesaire&lt;/ref&gt; They went on to have 6 children together, divorcing in April 1963 after 25 years of marriage.

==Literary career==
Suzanne Césaire wrote in French and published seven essays during her career as a writer. All seven of these essays were published between 1941 and 1945 in the Martiniquan cultural journal ''Tropiques'', of which she was a co-founder and editor along with her husband, Aimé Césaire, and [[René Ménil]], both of whom were notable Martiniquan poets. Her writing explored themes such as Caribbean identity, civilisation, and surrealism.

While her writing remains largely unknown to Anglophone readers, excerpts of her essays “Leo Frobenius and the Problem of Civilisations”, “A Civilisation’s Discontent”, “1943: Surrealism and Us”, and “The Great Camouflage” can be found translated into English in the anthology ''The Refusal of the Shadow: Surrealism and the Caribbean'' (Verso, 1996) edited by Michael Richardson.

Césaire had a particular affinity with surrealism, which she described as “the tightrope of our hope”.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Richardson, The Refusal of the Shadow: Surrealism and the Caribbean (Verso, 1996), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In her essay, “1943: Surrealism and Us”, she called for a Martiniquan surrealism:

“Our surrealism will then deliver it the bread of its depths. Finally those sordid contemporary antinomies of black/white, European/African, civilised/savage will be transcended. The magical power of the mahoulis will be recovered, drawn forth from living sources. Colonial stupidity will be purified in the blue welding flame. Our value as metal, our cutting edge of steel, our amazing communions will be recovered.”&lt;ref&gt;Michael Richardson, The Refusal of the Shadow: Surrealism and the Caribbean (Verso, 1996), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suzanne Césaire also developed a close relationship with [[André Breton]] following his visit to Martinique in 1941. She dedicated an essay to him (“André Breton, poet”, 1941) and received a poem dedicated to her in return (“For madame Suzanne Césaire”, 1941).&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Claude Blachère, “Breton et Césaire: Flux et reflux d’une amitié”, Europe, Paris, vol. 76, iss. 832, 1998, pp. 146-159 (p. 153).&lt;/ref&gt; This encounter with André Breton opened the way for her development of [[Afro-Surrealism]]&lt;ref&gt;P. Rosemont, ''Surrealist Women'' (2000) p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; 

Her writing is often overshadowed by that of her husband, who is the better known of the two. However, in addition to her important literary essays, her role as editor of ''Tropiques'' can be regarded as an equally significant (if often overlooked) contribution to Caribbean literature. ''Tropiques'' was the most influential francophone Caribbean journal of its time and is widely acknowledged for the foundational role it played in the development of Martiniquan literature.&lt;ref&gt;http://azmartinique.com/fr/tout-savoir/personnages-celebres/suzanne-roussi-cesaire&lt;/ref&gt; Césaire played both an intellectual and administrative role in the journal’s success.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Bounoure, “Suzanne Césaire et la question de la civilisation”, ContreTemps, no. 6, May 2010, http://www.contretemps.eu/wp-content/uploads/01-160-CT6-SYLLEPSE-126-139-1-6.pdf, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; She managed the journal’s relations with the censor — a particularly difficult role given the oppositional stance of ''Tropiques'' towards the war-time Vichy government — as well as taking responsibility for the printing.&lt;ref&gt;http://azmartinique.com/fr/tout-savoir/personnages-celebres/suzanne-roussi-cesaire&lt;/ref&gt; The intellectual impact she had on the journal is underlined by her essay “The Great Camouflage”, which was the closing article of the final issue.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Bounoure, “Suzanne Césaire et la question de la civilisation”, ContreTemps, no. 6, May 2010, http://www.contretemps.eu/wp-content/uploads/01-160-CT6-SYLLEPSE-126-139-1-6.pdf, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her substantial written and editorial contribution to the journal, the collected works of ''Tropiques'', published by Jean-Michel Place in 1978, credits Aimé Césaire and René Ménil as the journal’s catalysts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nouvelleseditionsplace.com/produit/tropiques/&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tropiques'' published its last issue in September 1945, at the end of World War Two.&lt;ref&gt;http://bibliothequekandinsky.centrepompidou.fr/clientbookline/service/reference.asp?output=PORTAL&amp;INSTANCE=INCIPIO&amp;DOCBASE=CGPP&amp;DOCID=0467910&lt;/ref&gt; With the ending of the journal, Suzanne Césaire stopped writing. The reasons for this are unknown. However, journalist Natalie Levisalles suggests that Suzanne Césaire would have perhaps made different choices if she had not had the responsibilities of mothering 6 children, teaching, and being the wife of an important politician and poet, Aimé Césaire.&lt;ref&gt;http://next.liberation.fr/livres/2009/04/23/suzanne-l-aimee-de-cesaire_554226&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, her first daughter, Ina Césaire, remembers her saying regularly: “yours will be the first generation of women who choose”.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Bounoure, “Suzanne Césaire et la question de la civilisation”, ContreTemps, no. 6, May 2010, http://www.contretemps.eu/wp-content/uploads/01-160-CT6-SYLLEPSE-126-139-1-6.pdf, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having stopped writing she pursued her career as a teacher, working in Martinique, France, and Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;http://azmartinique.com/fr/tout-savoir/personnages-celebres/suzanne-roussi-cesaire&lt;/ref&gt; She was also an active feminist and participated in the Union des Femmes Françaises.&lt;ref&gt;http://azmartinique.com/fr/tout-savoir/personnages-celebres/suzanne-roussi-cesaire&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and influence==

Suzanne Césaire was a pioneer in the search for a distinct Martiniquan literary voice. However, following an early edition of ''Tropiques'', she attacked by some Caribbean writers for aping traditional French styles of poetry, supposedly promoting 'The Happy Antilles' view of the island promoted by French colonialism. However, her essay of 1941, Misère d'une poésie, condemned what she termed "Littérature de hamac. Littérature de sucre et de vanille. Tourisme littéeraire" [Literaure of the hammock, of sugar and vanilla. Literary tourism].[1]
Her encounter with André Breton opened the way for her development of Afro-Surrealism[2], which followed in the footsteps of her use of surrealist concepts to illuminate the colonial dilemma.[3] Her dictum - "La poésie martinique sera cannibale ou ne sera pas" [Cannibal poetry or nothing][4] - was an anti-colonial appropriation of a surrealist trope. Suzanne Césaire's repudiation of simple idealised answers - whether assimilationist, Africanist, or creole - to the situation of colonialism in the Caribbean has proved increasingly influential in later postcolonial studies.[6]

'''Usenet''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|uː|z|n|ɛ|t}}) is a worldwide distributed discussion system available on computers. It was developed from the general-purpose [[UUCP|Unix-to-Unix Copy (UUCP)]] [[Dial-up Internet access|dial-up]] network architecture. [[Tom Truscott]] and [[Jim Ellis (computing)|Jim Ellis]] conceived the idea in 1979, and it was established in 1980.&lt;ref name="Lueg"&gt;''From Usenet to CoWebs: interacting with social information spaces'', Christopher Lueg, Danyel Fisher, Springer (2003), {{ISBN|1-85233-532-7}}, {{ISBN|978-1-85233-532-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users read and post messages (called ''articles'' or ''posts'', and collectively termed ''news'') to one or more categories, known as [[Usenet newsgroup|newsgroups]]. Usenet resembles a [[bulletin board system]] (BBS) in many respects and is the precursor to [[Internet forum]]s that are widely used today. Discussions are [[Threaded discussion|threaded]], as with web forums and BBSs, though posts are stored on the server sequentially. The name comes from the term "users network".&lt;ref&gt;[http://jargon-file.org/archive/jargon-4.4.7.dos.txt The jargon file v4.4.7] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105200447/http://jargon-file.org/archive/jargon-4.4.7.dos.txt |date=January 5, 2016 }}, Jargon File Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/~hauben/book/ch106.x03 Chapter 3 - The Social Forces Behind The Development of Usenet] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804110914/http://www.columbia.edu/~hauben/book/ch106.x03 |date=August 4, 2016 }}, Netizens Netbook by Ronda Hauben and  Michael Hauben.&lt;/ref&gt;

One notable difference between a BBS or web forum and Usenet is the absence of a central server and dedicated administrator. Usenet is distributed among a large, constantly changing conglomeration of servers that store and forward messages to one another in so-called news feeds. Individual users may read messages from and post messages to a local server operated by a commercial usenet provider, their [[Internet service provider]], university, employer, or their own server.

Usenet has significant cultural importance in the networked world, having given rise to, or popularized, many widely recognized concepts and terms such as "[[FAQ]]", "[[flaming (Internet)|flame]]", and "[[spam (electronic)|spam]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsdemon.com/usenet_term_spam.php| title=USENET Newsgroup Terms – SPAM |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120915/http://www.newsdemon.com/usenet_term_spam.php |archivedate=2012-09-15 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
Usenet was conceived in 1979 and publicly established in 1980, at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] and [[Duke University]],{{r|emerson198310}}&lt;ref name="Lueg" /&gt; over a decade before the [[World Wide Web]] went online and the general public received access to the [[Internet]], making it one of the oldest [[computer network]] communications systems still in widespread use. It was originally built on the "poor man's [[ARPANET]]", employing UUCP as its transport protocol to offer mail and file transfers, as well as announcements through the newly developed [[Newsreader (Usenet)|news software]] such as [[A News]]. The name Usenet emphasized its creators' hope that the [[USENIX]] organization would take an active role in its operation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsdemon.com/first-official-announcement-usenet.php "Invitation to a General Access UNIX Network] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924152631/http://www.newsdemon.com/first-official-announcement-usenet.php |date=September 24, 2012 }}", James Ellis and Tom Truscott, in First Official Announcement of USENET, NewsDemon (K&amp;L Technologies, Inc), 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

The articles that users post to Usenet are organized into topical categories known as [[Usenet newsgroup|newsgroups]], which are themselves logically organized into hierarchies of subjects. For instance, ''[news:sci.math sci.math]'' and ''[news:sci.physics sci.physics]'' are within the ''sci.*'' hierarchy, for science. Or, ''[news:talk.origins talk.origins]'' and ''[news:talk.atheism talk.atheism]'' are in the ''talk.*'' hierarchy. When a user subscribes to a newsgroup, the [[news client]] software keeps track of which articles that user has read.&lt;ref&gt;Lehnert, Wendy G.; Kopec, Richard (2007). ''Web 101.'' Addison Wesley. p. 291. {{ISBN|9780321424679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most newsgroups, the majority of the articles are responses to some other article. The set of articles that can be traced to one single non-reply article is called a [[Threaded discussion|thread]]. Most modern newsreaders display the articles arranged into threads and subthreads.

When a user posts an article, it is initially only available on that user's news server. Each news server talks to one or more other servers (its "newsfeeds") and [[#Technical details|exchanges]] articles with them. In this fashion, the article is copied from [[inter-server|server to server]] and should eventually reach every server in the network. The later [[peer-to-peer]] networks operate on a similar principle, but for Usenet it is normally the sender, rather than the receiver, who initiates transfers. Usenet was designed under conditions when networks were much slower and not always available. Many sites on the original Usenet network would connect only once or twice a day to batch-transfer messages in and out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/15-849/store_and_forward.html |title=Store And Forward Communication: UUCP and FidoNet |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120630/http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/15-849/store_and_forward.html |archivedate=2012-06-30 |deadurl=no}}. Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science.&lt;/ref&gt; This is largely because the [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] network was typically used for transfers, and phone charges were lower at night.

The format and transmission of Usenet articles is similar to that of Internet [[e-mail]] messages. The difference between the two is that Usenet articles can be read by any user whose news server carries the group to which the message was posted, as opposed to email messages, which have one or more specific recipients.&lt;ref&gt;Kozierok, Charles M. (2005). ''The TCP/IP guide: a comprehensive, illustrated Internet protocols reference.'' No Starch Press. p. 1401. {{ISBN|978-159327-047-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Usenet has diminished in importance with respect to [[Internet forum]]s, [[blog]]s and [[mailing list]]s. Usenet differs from such media in several ways: Usenet requires no personal registration with the group concerned; information need not be stored on a remote server; archives are always available; and reading the messages requires not a mail or web client, but a news client. The groups in ''[[alt.binaries]]'' are still widely used for data transfer.

==ISPs, news servers, and newsfeeds==
Many Internet service providers, and many other Internet sites, operate [[news server]]s for their users to access. ISPs that do not operate their own servers directly will often offer their users an account from another provider that specifically operates newsfeeds. In early news implementations, the server and newsreader were a single program suite, running on the same system. Today, one uses separate newsreader client software, a program that resembles an email client but accesses Usenet servers instead. Some clients such as [[Mozilla Thunderbird]] and [[Outlook Express]] provide both abilities.

Not all ISPs run news servers. A news server is one of the most difficult Internet services to administer because of the large amount of data involved, small customer base (compared to mainstream Internet services such as email and web access), and a disproportionately high volume of customer support incidents (frequently complaining of missing news articles that are not the ISP's fault). Some ISPs outsource news operation to specialist sites, which will usually appear to a user as though the ISP ran the server itself. Many sites carry a restricted newsfeed, with a limited number of newsgroups. Commonly omitted from such a newsfeed are foreign-language newsgroups and the ''[[alt.* hierarchy|alt.binaries]]'' hierarchy which largely carries software, music, videos and images, and accounts for over 99 percent of article data.

There are also Usenet providers that specialize in offering service to users whose ISPs do not carry news, or that carry a restricted feed.

See also [[news server operation]] for an overview of how news systems are implemented.

===Newsreaders===
Newsgroups are typically accessed with [[Newsreader (Usenet)|newsreaders]]: applications that allow users to read and reply to postings in newsgroups. These applications act as [[Client (computing)|clients]] to one or more news servers. Although historically, Usenet was associated with the [[Unix]] operating system developed at [[AT&amp;T]], newsreaders are available for all major operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Software/Internet/Clients/Usenet/ |title=Open Directory Usenet Clients |publisher=Dmoz.org |date=October 9, 2008 |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120730/http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Software/Internet/Clients/Usenet/ |archivedate=2012-07-30 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern mail clients or "communication suites" commonly also have an integrated newsreader. Often, however, these integrated clients are of low quality, compared to standalone newsreaders, and incorrectly implement Usenet protocols, standards and conventions. Many of these integrated clients, for example the one in [[Microsoft]]'s Outlook Express, are disliked by purists because of their misbehavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

With the rise of the World Wide Web (WWW), web [[front end processor (program)|front-ends]] (web2news) have become more common. Web front ends have lowered the technical entry barrier requirements to that of one application and no Usenet NNTP server account.

===Moderated and unmoderated newsgroups===
A minority of newsgroups are moderated, meaning that messages submitted by readers are not distributed directly to Usenet, but instead are emailed to the moderators of the newsgroup for approval. The moderator is to receive submitted articles, review them, and inject approved articles so that they can be properly propagated worldwide. Articles approved by a moderator must bear the Approved: header line. Moderators ensure that the messages that readers see in the newsgroup conform to the charter of the newsgroup, though they are not required to follow any such rules or guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.big-8.org/wiki/Moderated_Newsgroups#Who_can_force_the_moderators_to_obey_the_group_charter.3F |title=Who can force the moderators to obey the group charter? |publisher=Big-8.org |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120804/http://www.big-8.org/wiki/Moderated_Newsgroups%23Who_can_force_the_moderators_to_obey_the_group_charter.3F#Who_can_force_the_moderators_to_obey_the_group_charter.3F |archivedate=August 4, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, moderators are appointed in the proposal for the newsgroup, and changes of moderators follow a succession plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.big-8.org/wiki/Moderated_Newsgroups#How_does_a_group_change_moderators.3F |title=How does a group change moderators? |publisher=Big-8.org |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120719/http://www.big-8.org/wiki/Moderated_Newsgroups%23How_does_a_group_change_moderators.3F#How_does_a_group_change_moderators.3F |archivedate=July 19, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, a ''mod.*'' hierarchy existed before Usenet reorganization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livinginternet.com/u/ui_early.htm |title=Early Usenet Newsgroup Hierarchies |publisher=Livinginternet.com |date=October 25, 1990 |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120921/http://www.livinginternet.com/u/ui_early.htm |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now, moderated newsgroups may appear in any hierarchy, typically with &lt;tt&gt;.moderated&lt;/tt&gt; added to the group name.

Usenet newsgroups in the [[Big 8 (Usenet)|Big-8 hierarchy]] are created by proposals called a Request for Discussion, or RFD. The RFD is required to have the following information: newsgroup name, checkgroups file entry, and moderated or unmoderated status. If the group is to be moderated, then at least one moderator with a valid email address must be provided. Other information which is beneficial but not required includes: a charter, a rationale, and a moderation policy if the group is to be moderated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.big-8.org/wiki/How_to_Create_a_New_Big-8_Newsgroup |title=How to Create a New Big-8 Newsgroup |publisher=Big-8.org |date=July 7, 2010 |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120722/http://www.big-8.org/wiki/How_to_Create_a_New_Big-8_Newsgroup |archivedate=July 22, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussion of the new newsgroup proposal follows, and is finished with the members of the Big-8 Management Board making the decision, by vote, to either approve or disapprove the new newsgroup.

Unmoderated newsgroups form the majority of Usenet newsgroups, and messages submitted by readers for unmoderated newsgroups are immediately propagated for everyone to see. Minimal editorial content filtering vs propagation speed form one crux of the Usenet community. One little cited defense of propagation is canceling a propagated message, but few Usenet users use this command and some news readers do not offer [[Cancel message#cancel|cancellation commands]], in part because article storage expires in relatively short order anyway. Almost all unmoderated Usenet groups have become collections of [[spam (electronic)|spam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TxaoAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA168&amp;ots=vsxrAQqzZx&amp;dq=usenet%20spam%20prevalence&amp;pg=PA168#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Social Machine: Designs for Living Online|quote=Today, Usenet still exists, but it is an unsociable morass of spam, porn, and pirated software}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/issue-sections/features-issue-sections/12223/markovian-parallax-denigrate-usenet-spam/|title=Unraveling the Internet’s oldest and weirdest mystery|quote=Groups filled with spam, massive fights took place against spammers and over what to do about the spam.

Creation of moderated newsgroups often becomes a hot subject of controversy, raising issues regarding censorship and the desire of a subset of users to form an [[intentional community]].{{citation needed |date=August 2014}}

===Technical details===
Usenet is a set of protocols for generating, storing and retrieving news "articles" (which resemble Internet mail messages) and for exchanging them among a readership which is potentially widely distributed. These protocols most commonly use a [[flooding algorithm]] which propagates copies throughout a network of participating servers. Whenever a message reaches a server, that server forwards the message to all its network neighbors that haven't yet seen the article. Only one copy of a message is stored per server, and each server makes it available on demand to the (typically local) readers able to access that server. The collection of Usenet servers has thus a certain [[peer-to-peer]] character in that they share resources by exchanging them, the granularity of exchange however is on a different scale than a modern peer-to-peer system and this characteristic excludes the actual users of the system who connect to the news servers with a typical client-server application, much like an email reader.

RFC 850 was the first formal specification of the messages exchanged by Usenet servers. It was superseded by RFC 1036 and subsequently by RFC 5536 and RFC 5537.

In cases where unsuitable content has been posted, Usenet has support for automated removal of a posting from the whole network by creating a cancel message, although due to a lack of authentication and resultant abuse, this capability is frequently disabled. Copyright holders may still request the manual deletion of infringing material using the provisions of [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] treaty implementations, such as the United States [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act]], but this would require giving notice to each individual news server administrator.

On the Internet, Usenet is transported via the [[Network News Transfer Protocol]] (NNTP) on [[Computer port (software)|TCP Port]] 119 for standard, unprotected connections and on TCP port 563 for [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] encrypted connections which is offered only by a few sites.

===Organization===
[[File:Usenet Big Nine.svg|thumb|right|The "Big Nine" hierarchies of Usenet]]

The major set of worldwide newsgroups is contained within nine hierarchies, eight of which are operated under consensual guidelines that govern their administration and naming. The current ''[[Big 8 (Usenet)|Big Eight]]'' are:
* ''comp.*'' – computer-related discussions (''comp.software'', ''comp.sys.amiga'')
* ''humanities.*'' – [[fine art]]s, [[literature]], and [[philosophy]] (''humanities.classics'', ''humanities.design.misc'')
* ''misc.*'' – miscellaneous topics (''misc.education'', ''misc.forsale'', ''misc.kids'')
* ''news.*'' – discussions and announcements about news (meaning Usenet, not current events) (''news.groups'', ''news.admin'')
* ''rec.*'' – recreation and entertainment (''rec.music'', ''rec.arts.movies'')
* ''sci.*'' – science related discussions (''sci.psychology'', ''sci.research'')
* ''soc.*'' – social discussions (''soc.college.org'', ''soc.culture.{{sic|hide=y|african}}'')
* ''talk.*'' – talk about various controversial topics (''talk.religion'', ''talk.politics'', ''[[talk.origins]]'')

See also the [[Great Renaming]].

The [[alt.* hierarchy|''alt.*'' hierarchy]] is not subject to the procedures controlling groups in the Big Eight, and it is as a result less organized. Groups in the ''alt.*'' hierarchy tend to be more specialized or specific—for example, there might be a newsgroup under the Big Eight which contains discussions about children's books, but a group in the alt hierarchy may be dedicated to one specific author of children's books. [[Binaries]] are posted in ''alt.binaries.*'', making it the largest of all the hierarchies.

Many other hierarchies of newsgroups are distributed alongside these. Regional and language-specific hierarchies such as ''{{sic|hide=y|japan}}.*'', ''{{sic|hide=y|malta}}.*'' and ''ne.*'' serve specific countries and regions such as [[Japan]], [[Malta]] and [[New England]]. Companies and projects administer their own hierarchies to discuss their products and offer community technical support, such as the historical ''{{sic|hide=y|gnu}}.*'' hierarchy from the [[Free Software Foundation]]. [[Microsoft]] closed its newsserver in June 2010, providing support for its products over forums now.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/default.mspx Microsoft Responds to the Evolution of Communities] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918084608/http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/default.mspx |date=September 18, 2012 }}, Announcement, undated. {{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-20004109-56.html |title=Microsoft hitting 'unsubscribe' on newsgroups |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120712/http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-20004109-56.html |archivedate=2012-07-12 |deadurl=no }}, CNET, May 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Some users prefer to use the term "Usenet" to refer only to the Big Eight hierarchies; others include alt as well. The more general term "netnews" incorporates the entire medium, including private organizational news systems.

Informal sub-hierarchy conventions also exist. ''*.answers'' are typically moderated cross-post groups for FAQs. An FAQ would be posted within one group and a cross post to the ''*.answers'' group at the head of the hierarchy seen by some as a refining of information in that news group. Some subgroups are recursive—to the point of some silliness in ''alt.*''{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}.

===Binary content===
[[File:Usenet Binaries Upload process.PNG|thumb|300px|A visual example of the many complex steps required to prepare data to be uploaded to Usenet newsgroups. These steps must be done again in reverse to download data from Usenet.]]

Usenet was originally created to distribute text content encoded in the 7-[[bit]] [[ASCII]] character set. With the help of programs that encode 8-bit values into ASCII, it became practical to distribute [[binary file]]s as content. Binary posts, due to their size and often-dubious copyright status, were in time restricted to specific newsgroups, making it easier for administrators to allow or disallow the traffic.

The oldest widely used encoding method for binary content is [[uuencode]], from the [[Unix]] UUCP package. In the late 1980s, Usenet articles were often limited to 60,000 characters, and larger hard limits exist today. Files are therefore commonly split into sections that require reassembly by the reader.

With the header extensions and the [[Base64]] and Quoted-Printable [[MIME]] encodings, there was a new generation of binary transport. In practice, MIME has seen increased adoption in text messages, but it is avoided for most binary attachments. Some operating systems with [[metadata (computing)|metadata]] attached to files use specialized encoding formats. For Mac OS, both [[Binhex]] and special MIME types are used.

Other lesser known encoding systems that may have been used at one time were [[BTOA]], [[Xxencode|XX encoding]], [[BOO (encoding)|BOO]], and [[USR encoding]].

In an attempt to reduce file transfer times, an informal file encoding known as [[yEnc]] was introduced in 2001. It achieves about a 30% reduction in data transferred by assuming that most 8-bit characters can safely be transferred across the network without first encoding into the 7-bit ASCII space.

The most common method of uploading large binary posts to Usenet is to convert the files into [[RAR (file format)|RAR]] archives and create [[Parchive]] files for them. Parity files are used to recreate missing data when not every part of the files reaches a server.

====Binary retention time====
[[File:Usenet-total-storage.jpg|thumb|300px|This is a list of some of the biggest binary groups. With 1341+ days retention, the (binary) Usenet storage (which binsearch.info indexes) is more than 33 [[petabyte]]s (33000 [[terabyte]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.binsearch.info/groupinfo.php |title=Usenet storage is more than 33 petabytes (33000 terabytes) |publisher=binsearch.info |accessdate=October 7, 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120921/https://www.binsearch.info/groupinfo.php |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Each news server generally allocates a certain amount of storage space for post content in each newsgroup. When this storage has been filled, each time a new post arrives, old posts are deleted to make room for the new content. If the network bandwidth available to a server is high but the storage allocation is small, it is possible for a huge flood of incoming content to overflow the allocation and push out everything that was in the group before it. If the flood is large enough, the beginning of the flood will begin to be deleted even before the last part of the flood has been posted.

Binary newsgroups are only able to function reliably if there is sufficient storage allocated to a group to allow readers enough time to download all parts of a binary posting before it is flushed out of the group's storage allocation. This was at one time how posting of undesired content was countered; the newsgroup would be flooded with random garbage data posts, of sufficient quantity to push out all the content to be suppressed. This has been compensated by service providers allocating enough storage to retain everything posted each day, including such spam floods, without deleting anything.

The average length of time that posts are able to stay in the group before being deleted is commonly called the ''retention time''. Generally the larger Usenet servers have enough capacity to archive several years of binary content even when flooded with new data at the maximum daily speed available. A good binaries service provider must not only accommodate users of fast connections (3 megabit) but also users of slow connections (256 kilobit or less) who need more time to download content over a period of several days or weeks.

Major NSPs{{what|date=July 2018}} have a retention time of more than 4 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giganews.com/faq.html#q0.4 |title=Giganews FAQ – How long are articles available? |publisher=Giganews.com |accessdate=October 23, 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120904/http://www.giganews.com/faq.html%23q0.4 |archivedate=2012-09-04 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This results in more than 33 [[petabyte]]s (33000 [[terabyte]]s) of storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giganews.com/blog/2011/05/announcing-1000-days-retention-prize.html
 |title=9 petabyte of usenet storage on giganews.com |publisher=giganews.com |accessdate=February 14, 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120921/http://www.giganews.com/blog/2011/05/announcing-1000-days-retention-prize.html |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In part because of such long retention times, as well as growing Internet [[upload]] speeds, Usenet is also used by individual users to store [[backup]] data in a practice called ''Usenet backup'', or uBackup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Backup-Your-Data-on-Usenet-%28Ubackup%29 |title=usenet backup (uBackup) |publisher=Wikihow.com |accessdate=February 14, 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120918/http://www.wikihow.com/Backup-Your-Data-on-Usenet-%28Ubackup%29 |archivedate=2012-09-18 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; While commercial providers offer more [[ease of use|easy to use]] [[List of online backup services|online backup services]], storing data on Usenet is free of charge (although access to Usenet itself may not be). The method requires the user to [[Backup#Data repository models|manually select, prepare and upload the data]]. Because anyone can potentially download the backup files, the data is typically [[encryption|encrypted]]. After the files are uploaded, the uploader does not have any control over them; the files are automatically copied to all Usenet providers, so there will be multiple copies of it spread over different geographical locations around the world—desirable in a backup scheme.

====Legal issues====
While binary newsgroups can be used to distribute completely legal user-created works, open-source software, and public domain material, some binary groups are used to illegally distribute commercial software, copyrighted media, and obscene material.

ISP-operated Usenet servers frequently block access to all ''alt.binaries.*'' groups to both reduce network traffic and to avoid related legal issues. Commercial Usenet service providers claim to operate as a telecommunications service, and assert that they are not responsible for the user-posted binary content transferred via their equipment. In the United States, Usenet providers can qualify for protection under the [[DMCA]] [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act|Safe Harbor regulations]], provided that they establish a mechanism to comply with and respond to takedown notices from copyright holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.supernews.com/docs/dmca.html |title=Digital Millenium Copyright Act|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120910/http://www.supernews.com/docs/dmca.html |archivedate=2012-09-10 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Removal of copyrighted content from the entire Usenet network is a nearly impossible task, due to the rapid propagation between servers and the retention done by each server. Petitioning a Usenet provider for removal only removes it from that one server's retention cache, but not any others. It is possible for a special ''post cancellation'' message to be distributed to remove it from all servers, but many providers ignore [[Cancel message|cancel]] messages by standard policy, because they can be easily falsified and submitted by anyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cancel Messages FAQ |url=http://wiki.killfile.org/projects/usenet/faqs/cancel/|accessdate=June 29, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215161039/http://www.killfile.org/faqs/cancel.html |archivedate=February 15, 2008 |quote=...Until authenticated cancels catch on, there are no options to avoid forged cancels and allow unforged ones...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Microsoft knowledgebase article stating that many servers ignore cancel messages {{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q164420/ |title=Support.microsoft.com |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120719/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q164420/ |archivedate=2012-07-19 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a takedown petition to be most effective across the whole network, it would have to be issued to the origin server to which the content has been posted, before it has been propagated to other servers. Removal of the content at this early stage would prevent further propagation, but with modern high speed links, content can be propagated as fast as it arrives, allowing no time for content review and takedown issuance by copyright holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.measurement.sk/2005/S1/Surmacz.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Surmacz.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521051120/http://www.measurement.sk/2005/S1/Surmacz.pdf |archive-date=May 21, 2013 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Establishing the identity of the person posting illegal content is equally difficult due to the trust-based design of the network. Like [[SMTP]] email, servers generally assume the header and origin information in a post is true and accurate. However, as in SMTP email, Usenet post headers are easily falsified so as to obscure the true identity and location of the message source.&lt;ref&gt;''...every part of a Usenet post may be forged apart from the left most portion of the "Path:" header...'' {{cite web |url=http://www.by-users.co.uk/faqs/email/headers/ |title=By-users.co.uk |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120723/http://www.by-users.co.uk/faqs/email/headers/ |archivedate=2012-07-23 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this manner, Usenet is significantly different from modern P2P services; most P2P users distributing content are typically immediately identifiable to all other users by their [[network address]], but the origin information for a Usenet posting can be completely obscured and unobtainable once it has propagated past the original server.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup|message-id=StUPidfuk01@uunet.uu.net|newsgroup=news.admin.misc|title=Better living through forgery |url=http://groups.google.com/group/news.admin.misc/msg/9f6aa173f228ac6a?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain|date=1995-06-10 |accessdate=December 5, 2014|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120724/http://groups.google.com/group/news.admin.misc/msg/9f6aa173f228ac6a?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |archivedate=2012-07-24 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also unlike modern P2P services, the identity of the downloaders is hidden from view. On P2P services a downloader is identifiable to all others by their network address. On Usenet, the downloader connects directly to a server, and only the server knows the address of who is connecting to it. Some Usenet providers do keep usage logs, but not all make this logged information casually available to outside parties such as the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giganews.com/legal/privacy.html |title=Giganews Privacy Policy |publisher=Giganews.com |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120731/http://www.giganews.com/legal/privacy.html |archivedate=2012-07-31 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aioe.org/index.php?logging-policy |title=Logging Policy |publisher=Aioe.org |date=June 9, 2005 |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120708/http://aioe.org/index.php?logging-policy |archivedate=July 8, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of anonymising gateways to USENET also complicates the tracing of a postings true origin.

Newsgroup experiments first occurred in 1979. [[Tom Truscott]] and [[Jim Ellis (computing)|Jim Ellis]] of [[Duke University]] came up with the idea as a replacement for a local announcement program, and established a link with nearby [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] using [[Bourne shell]] scripts written by [[Steve Bellovin]]. The public release of [[A News|news]] was in the form of conventional compiled [[software]], written by Steve Daniel and Truscott.&lt;ref name="emerson198310"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1983-10/1983_10_BYTE_08-10_UNIX#page/n219/mode/2up | title=Usenet / A Bulletin Board for Unix Users | work=BYTE | date=October 1983 | accessdate=31 January 2015 | author=Emerson, Sandra L. | pages=219–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;LaQuey, Tracy (1990).

===Network===
UUCP networks spread quickly due to the lower costs involved, and the ability to use existing leased lines, [[X.25]] links or even [[ARPANET]] connections. By 1983, thousands of people participated from more than 500 hosts, mostly universities and Bell Labs sites but also a growing number of Unix-related companies; the number of hosts nearly doubled to 940 in 1984. More than 100 newsgroups existed, more than 20 devoted to Unix and other computer-related topics, and at least a third to recreation.&lt;ref&gt;Haddadi, H. (2006). "[http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~hamed/papers/mphil.pdf Network Traffic Inference Using Sampled Statistics] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117133532/http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~hamed/papers/mphil.pdf |date=November 17, 2015 }}". University College London.&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|emerson198310}} As the mesh of UUCP hosts rapidly expanded, it became desirable to distinguish the Usenet subset from the overall network. A vote was taken at the 1982 USENIX conference to choose a new name. The name Usenet was retained, but it was established that it only applied to news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Horton| first = Mark| title = Arachnet| date = December 11, 1990 |url = http://communication.ucsd.edu/bjones/Usenet.Hist/Nethist/0111.html |accessdate=4 June 2007 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120921/http://communication.ucsd.edu/bjones/Usenet.Hist/Nethist/0111.html |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name UUCPNET became the common name for the overall network.

In addition to UUCP, early Usenet traffic was also exchanged with [[Fidonet]] and other dial-up [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] networks. Widespread use of Usenet by the BBS community was facilitated by the introduction of UUCP feeds made possible by MS-DOS implementations of UUCP, such as UFGATE (UUCP to FidoNet Gateway), FSUUCP and UUPC. In 1986, RFC 977 provided the [[Network News Transfer Protocol]] (NNTP) specification for distribution of Usenet articles over [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]] as a more flexible alternative to informal Internet transfers of UUCP traffic. Since the Internet boom of the 1990s, almost all Usenet distribution is over NNTP.&lt;ref&gt;Huston, Geoff (1999). ''ISP survival guide: strategies for running a competitive ISP.'' Wiley. p. 439.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Software===
Early versions of Usenet used Duke's [[A News]] software, designed for one or two articles a day. Matt Glickman and Horton at Berkeley produced an improved version called [[B News]] that could handle the rising traffic (about 50 articles a day as of late 1983).{{r|emerson198310}} With a message format that offered compatibility with Internet mail and improved performance, it became the dominant server software. [[C News]], developed by [[Geoff Collyer]] and [[Henry Spencer]] at the [[University of Toronto]], was comparable to B News in features but offered considerably faster processing. In the early 1990s, [[InterNetNews]] by [[Rich Salz]] was developed to take advantage of the continuous message flow made possible by NNTP versus the batched store-and-forward design of UUCP. Since that time [[InterNetNews|INN]] development has continued, and other news server software has also been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsreaders.com/unix/servers.html |title=Unix/Linux news servers |publisher=Newsreaders.com |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120905/http://www.newsreaders.com/unix/servers.html |archivedate=2012-09-05 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public venue===
Usenet was the first Internet community and the place for many of the most important public developments in the pre-commercial Internet. It was the place where [[Tim Berners-Lee]] announced the launch of the [[World Wide Web]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup| title = WorldWideWeb: Summary| author = Tim Berners-Lee| date = August 6, 1991| newsgroup = alt.hypertext|message-id= 6487@cernvax.cern.ch|url = http://groups.google.com/group/alt.hypertext/msg/395f282a67a1916c| accessdate =June 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Linus Torvalds]] announced the [[Linux]] project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup | title = What would you like to see most in minix? | newsgroup = comp.os.minix |message-id= 1991Aug25.205708.9541@klaava.Helsinki.FI |url = http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.minix/msg/b813d52cbc5a044b | last = Torvalds | first = Linus | accessdate =September 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and where [[Marc Andreessen]] announced the creation of the [[Mosaic browser]] and the introduction of the image tag,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup| title = NCSA Mosaic for X 0.10 available.| author = Marc Andreessen| date = March 15, 1993| newsgroup = comp.infosystems.gopher, comp.infosystems.wais, comp.infosystems, alt.hypertext, comp.windows.x| message-id = MARCA.93Mar14225600@wintermute.ncsa.uiuc.edu| url = http://groups.google.com/group/comp.windows.x/msg/7fde2f6d4d5dc4e7| accessdate = 4 June 2007| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060616013046/http://groups.google.com/group/comp.windows.x/msg/7fde2f6d4d5dc4e7| archive-date = June 16, 2006| dead-url = no| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which revolutionized the World Wide Web by turning it into a graphical medium.

===Internet jargon and history===
Many [[jargon]] terms now in common use on the Internet originated or were popularized on Usenet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, many conflicts which later spread to the rest of the Internet, such as the ongoing difficulties over [[spam (electronic)|spamming]], began on Usenet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Campbell|first=K.

===Decline===
Sascha Segan of ''[[PC Magazine]]'' said in 2008 that "Usenet has been dying for years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Segan |first1=Sascha |title=R.I.P Usenet: 1980-2008 |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2326849,00.asp |accessdate=July 21, 2017 |work=PC Magazine |date=July 31, 2008 |language=en |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120909/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2326849,00.asp |archive-date=September 9, 2012 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Segan said that some people pointed to the [[Eternal September]] in 1993 as the beginning of Usenet's decline. Segan believes that when pornographers and software [[Copyright infringement|crackers]] began putting large (non-text) files on Usenet by the late 1990s, Usenet [[disk space]] and traffic increased correspondingly. Internet service providers questioned why they needed to host space for pornography and unauthorized software.  When the [[State of New York]] opened an investigation on [[child pornographer]]s who used Usenet, many ISPs dropped all Usenet access or access to the [[alt.* hierarchy|''alt.*'' hierarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2326849,00.asp |title=R.I.P Usenet: 1980–2008 |work=PC Magazine |author=Sascha Segan |date=July 31, 2008 |page=2|accessdate=May 8, 2011 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120909/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2326849,00.asp |archivedate=2012-09-09 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, John Biggs of [[TechCrunch]] said "As long as there are folks who think a [[command line]] is better than a mouse, the original text-only [[Social networking service|social network]] will live on".&lt;ref&gt;"{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2008/08/01/the-reports-of-usenets-death-are-greatly-exaggerated/ |title=Reports of Usenet's Death Are Greatly Exaggerated |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120716/http://techcrunch.com/2008/08/01/the-reports-of-usenets-death-are-greatly-exaggerated/ |archivedate=2012-07-16 |deadurl=no}}."

[[AOL]] discontinued Usenet access in 2005. In May 2010, [[Duke University]], whose implementation had kicked off Usenet more than 30 years earlier, decommissioned its Usenet server, citing low usage and rising costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://today.duke.edu/2010/05/usenet.html |title=A Piece of Internet History |work=Duke Today |author=Cara Bonnett|date=May 17, 2010 |accessdate=May 24, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120711/http://news.duke.edu/2010/05/usenet.html |archivedate=2012-07-11 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/05/20/usenet_duke_server/ |title=Usenet's home shuts down today |work=The Register |author=Andrew Orlowski |date=May 20, 2010 |accessdate=May 24, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120921/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/05/20/usenet_duke_server/ |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After 32 years, the Usenet news service link at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (news.unc.edu) was retired on February 4, 2011.

==Usenet traffic changes==
Over time, the amount of Usenet traffic has steadily increased. {{As of | 2010}} the number of all text posts made in all Big-8 newsgroups averaged 1,800 new messages every hour, with an average of 25,000 messages per day.&lt;ref name="newsadmin1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsadmin.com/top100tmsgs.asp |title=Top 100 text newsgroups by postings |publisher=NewsAdmin |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016004305/http://www.newsadmin.com/top100tmsgs.asp |archivedate=October 16, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these averages are minuscule in comparison to the traffic in the binary groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsadmin.com/top100bmsgs.asp |title=Top 100 binary newsgroups by postings |publisher=NewsAdmin |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016004534/http://www.newsadmin.com/top100bmsgs.asp |archivedate=October 16, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this traffic increase reflects not an increase in discrete users or newsgroup discussions, but instead the combination of massive automated spamming and an increase in the use of ''.binaries'' newsgroups&lt;ref name="newsadmin1"/&gt; in which large files are often posted publicly. A small sampling of the change (measured in feed size per day) follows:

Some ISPs did not include pressure from [[Attorney General of New York]] [[Andrew Cuomo]]'s aggressive campaign against child pornography as one of their reasons for dropping Usenet feeds as part of their services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r21120658-The-Comcast-Newsgroups-Service-Discontinued | title=The Comcast Newsgroups Service Discontinued | publisher=dslreports.com | date=September 16, 2008 | accessdate=December 5, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206015500/http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r21120658-The-Comcast-Newsgroups-Service-Discontinued |archivedate=December 6, 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISPs Cox and Atlantic Communications resisted the 2008 trend but both did eventually drop their respective Usenet feeds in 2010.&lt;ref name=dropun&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeropaid.com/news/88729/cox-to-drop-free-usenet-service-june-30th/ |title=Cox to Drop Free Usenet Service June 30th |publisher=Zeropaid.com |date=April 22, 2010 |accessdate=September 3, 2011 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120921/http://www.zeropaid.com/news/88729/cox-to-drop-free-usenet-service-june-30th/ |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coxatlantic"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.slashdot.org/story/10/04/21/210224/Cox-Discontinues-Usenet-Starting-In-June | title=Cox Discontinues Usenet, Starting In June | publisher=Geeknet, Inc | date=April 21, 2010 | accessdate=September 1, 2011 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120921/http://news.slashdot.org/story/10/04/21/210224/Cox-Discontinues-Usenet-Starting-In-June |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thundernews.com/blog/tag/isp/ | title=Cox Communications and Atlantic Broadband Discontinue Usenet Access | publisher=thundernews.com | date=April 27, 2010 | accessdate=September 1, 2011 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120912/http://www.thundernews.com/blog/tag/isp/ |archivedate=2012-09-12 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archives==
Public archives of Usenet articles have existed since the early days of Usenet, such as the system created by Kenneth Almquist in late 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/net.general/msg/ba3ad51d0cedd76b?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |title=How to obtain back news items |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710/http://groups.google.com/group/net.general/msg/ba3ad51d0cedd76b?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |archivedate=2012-07-10 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distributed archiving of Usenet posts was suggested in November 1982 by Scott Orshan, who proposed that "Every site should keep all the articles it posted, forever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/net.news/msg/e8145eace8aa0529?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |title=Distributed archiving of netnews |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120708/http://groups.google.com/group/net.news/msg/e8145eace8aa0529?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |archivedate=2012-07-08 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in November of that year, Rick Adams responded to a post asking "Has anyone archived netnews, or does anyone plan to?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/net.news/msg/a9ad42b15688b910?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |title=Archive of netnews |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120724/http://groups.google.com/group/net.news/msg/a9ad42b15688b910?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |archivedate=2012-07-24 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; by stating that he was, "afraid to admit it, but I started archiving most 'useful' newsgroups as of September 18."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/net.news/msg/87c9160730b36989?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |title=Re: Archive of netnews |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120715/http://groups.google.com/group/net.news/msg/87c9160730b36989?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |archivedate=2012-07-15 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1982, Gregory G. Woodbury proposed an "automatic access to archives" system that consisted of "automatic answering of fixed-format messages to a special mail recipient on specified machines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/net.general/msg/a377e12ab1a829ff?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |title=Automatic access to archives |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120712/http://groups.google.com/group/net.general/msg/a377e12ab1a829ff?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |archivedate=2012-07-12 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, two news archiving systems and one [[Request for Comments|RFC]] were posted to the Internet. The first system, called keepnews, by Mark M. Swenson of [[The University of Arizona]], was described as "a program that attempts to provide a sane way of extracting and keeping information that comes over Usenet." The main advantage of this system was to allow users to mark articles as worthwhile to retain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/net.sources/msg/737d29fd3af2d5ae?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |title=keepnews – A Usenet news archival system |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717/http://groups.google.com/group/net.sources/msg/737d29fd3af2d5ae?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |archivedate=2012-07-17 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second system, YA News Archiver by Chuq Von Rospach, was similar to keepnews, but was "designed to work with much larger archives where the wonderful quadratic search time feature of the Unix ... becomes a real problem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/net.sources/msg/d5c0cec804f745dd?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |title=YA News Archiver |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120709/http://groups.google.com/group/net.sources/msg/d5c0cec804f745dd?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |archivedate=2012-07-09 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Von Rospach in early 1985 posted a detailed RFC for "archiving and accessing usenet articles with [[Index term|keyword]] lookup." This RFC described a program that could "generate and
maintain an archive of Usenet articles and allow looking up articles based on the article-id, subject lines, or keywords pulled out of the article itself." Also included was [[C (programming language)|C]] code for the internal data structure of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/net.news/msg/f26190057834ed87?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |title=RFC usenet article archive program with keyword lookup |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120715/http://groups.google.com/group/net.news/msg/f26190057834ed87?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |archivedate=2012-07-15 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The desire to have a fulltext search index of archived news articles is not new either, one such request having been made in April 1991 by [[Alex Martelli]] who sought to "build
some sort of keyword index for [the news archive]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/news.software.nn/msg/16381a7e3fd611d4?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |title=Looking for fulltext indexing software for archived news |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120921/http://groups.google.com/group/news.software.nn/msg/16381a7e3fd611d4?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early May, Mr. Martelli posted a summary of his responses to Usenet, noting that the "most popular suggestion award must definitely go to 'lq-text' package, by Liam Quin, recently posted in alt.sources."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/news.software.nn/msg/f503efa9034f1c1d?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |title=Summary: search for fulltext indexing software for archived news |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120708/http://groups.google.com/group/news.software.nn/msg/f503efa9034f1c1d?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |archivedate=2012-07-08 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The huge site http://asstr.org archives and indexes erotic and pornographic stories posted to the Usenet group alt.sex.stories.

Today, the archiving of Usenet has led to a fear of loss of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2326849,00.asp |title=R.I.P Usenet: 1980–2008 – Usenet's Decline – Columns by PC Magazine |publisher=Pcmag.com |date=January 1, 1970 |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |first=Sascha |last=Segan |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120909/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2326849,00.asp |archivedate=2012-09-09 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; An archive simplifies ways to profile people. This has partly been countered with the introduction of the '' [[X-No-Archive|X-No-Archive: Yes]]'' header, which is itself controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Strawbridge, Matthew (2006). ''Netiquette: Internet Etiquette in the Age of the Blog.'' Software Reference. p. 53. {{ISBN|978-0955461408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archives by Google Groups and DejaNews===
{{Main|Google Groups}}

Web-based archiving of Usenet posts began in 1995 at [[Deja News]] with a very large, searchable database. In 2001, this database was acquired by [[Google]].&lt;ref&gt;Cullen, Drew (February 12, 2001). {{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/02/12/google_saves_deja_com_usenet/ |title=Google saves Deja.com Usenet service |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120921/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/02/12/google_saves_deja_com_usenet/ |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}. ''[[The Register]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Google Groups hosts an archive of Usenet posts dating back to May 1981. The earliest posts, which date from May 1981 to June 1991, were donated to Google by the [[University of Western Ontario]] with the help of [[David Wiseman]] and others,&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, David. [http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~magi/personal/usenet.html "Magi's NetNews Archive Involvement"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20050209012732/http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~magi/personal/usenet.html |date=February 9, 2005 }}, csd.uwo.ca.&lt;/ref&gt; and were originally archived by [[Henry Spencer]] at the University of Toronto's Zoology department.&lt;ref&gt;Mieszkowski, Katharine. "{{cite web |url=http://archive.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/01/07/saving_usenet/index.html |title=The Geeks Who Saved Usenet |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710/http://archive.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/01/07/saving_usenet/index.html |archivedate=July 10, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}", archive.salon.com (January 7, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; The archives for late 1991 through early 1995 were provided by Kent Landfield from the NetNews CD series&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Ian. {{cite web |url=http://db.tidbits.com/article/3229 |title=Usenet on a CD-ROM, no longer a fable |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120707/http://db.tidbits.com/article/3229 |archivedate=2012-07-07 |deadurl=no}}, "TidBITS" (February 10, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; and Jürgen Christoffel from [[Gesellschaft für Mathematik und Datenverarbeitung|GMD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://groups.google.com/group/news.admin.misc/msg/6dec509043e7b3c7?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |title=Google Groups Archive Information |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120709/http://groups.google.com/group/news.admin.misc/msg/6dec509043e7b3c7?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |archivedate=2012-07-09 |deadurl=no}} (December 21, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; The archive of posts from March 1995 onward was started by the company [[DejaNews]] (later Deja), which was purchased by Google in February 2001. Google began archiving Usenet posts for itself starting in the second week of August 2000.

Google has been criticized by ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' and [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'']] contributors as well as former employees for its stewardship of the archive and for breaking its search functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.wired.com/2009/10/usenet|title = Google’s Abandoned Library of 700 Million Titles|website = Wired|last = Poulsen|first = Kevin|access-date = March 12, 2017|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170309162758/https://www.wired.com/2009/10/usenet/|archive-date = March 9, 2017|dead-url = no|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://motherboard.vice.com/read/google-a-search-company-has-made-its-internet-archive-impossible-to-search|title = Google, a Search Company, Has Made Its Internet Archive Impossible to Search|website = Motherboard|last = Braga|first = Matthew|access-date = August 30, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150905023932/http://motherboard.vice.com/read/google-a-search-company-has-made-its-internet-archive-impossible-to-search|archive-date = September 5, 2015|dead-url = no|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = I'm Feeling Lucky: The Confessions of Google Employee Number 59|last = Edwards|first = Douglas|publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-547-41699-1|pages = 209–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Vegetative Treatment System''' (VTS) is a combination of treatment steps for managing [[Surface runoff|runoff]]. It treats runoff by settling, [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltrating]], and nutrient usage. Individual components of a VTS include, a settling structure, an outlet structure, a distribution system, and a Vegetative Treatment Area (VTA). All these components when used together are considered to be a Vegetative Treatment System.

==Introduction==
A '''Vegetative Treatment System (VTS)''' is a new alternative treatment option for treating the runoff from an [[animal feeding operation]] in an effort to protect water quality in [[South Dakota]] (SD). A VTS consists of a [[sediment basin]] to settle the solids from the feedlot, and uses controlled release of the liquids to a vegetated treatment area (VTA).

The VTA area is commonly confused with vegetative buffer (or filter) strips. A [[buffer strip]] is a narrow strip of vegetation (usually 30–60 feet wide) between cropland or a water source, such as a [[river]], [[lake]], or [[stream]]. In contrast, a VTA is a specifically sized area of [[Perennial plant|perennial]] vegetation to which runoff from a [[barnyard]] or [[feedlot]] is applied uniformly. The VTA utilizes the water holding capacity of the soil to store the runoff water until the nutrients and water can be used by the vegetation. Therefore, the application of the runoff to the VTA must be at a rate to prevent deep percolation below the root zone, and not allow the flow to extend past the end of the VTA.

A '''VTS''' can be an economical alternative to runoff retention (holding) ponds for controlling runoff from an open lot feeding production system ([[feedlot]]s). A Vegetative Treatment Area (VTA) is an area of perennial vegetation, such as a grass or a forage. The VTA is used to treat runoff from a feedlot or barnyard. It treats runoff by settling, infiltration, and nutrient use.  Runoff passes through buffers with some “filtering” of pollutants, but no attempt is made to control solids or flow. A VTS, however, collects runoff from a barnyard or feedlot, separates the solids from the liquids, and uniformly distributes the liquid over the vegetated area. Little or no runoff should leave a VTA.

Runoff is first collected from an open lot or barnyard area in a [[sediment]] settling structure, usually a basin. Such basins are very effective for removing most solids. The runoff then flows into a VTA where the  soil treats and stores the runoff. Once the runoff is in the soil, natural processes allow plants to use the nutrients. The general idea behind VTS technology is that the plants will take up the nutrients contained in the runoff and that natural processes will eliminate undesirable components such as pathogens. There are many different types of VTA’s such as level, infiltration basins, sloped, sprinkler, dual and multiple systems, etc.

A Vegetative Treatment System can be used to manage runoff from open lots of both [[Animal feeding operation|AFOs]] and [[CAFO]]s. VTS systems for large [[CAFO]]s can be permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ([[Clean Water Act|NPDES]]) in the US.

==Advantages==
* May provide lower initial investment and operating costs
*  More aesthetically palatable than large ponds 
* No long-term storage of runoff required, such as holding or evaporation ponds 
*  Fewer safety issues 
* Land designated for VTA can produce usable forage

==Disadvantages==
* A VTA may not be a “closed” system;
*  Saturated soils from previous rains could allow a discharge 
*  Special management required during runoff events
*  The VTAs can be damaged by a lack of maintenance and attention - gullies, erosion, and poor vegetation stands dramatically reduce their effectiveness 
*  Not currently permittable in SD by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources 
*  The VTAs may not provide the same level of water quality improvement as a total runoff containment system, such as holding or evaporation ponds provide

'''Walker Haden Land, Jr.''' (born May 29, 1932) is a Research Professor in the Department of Bioengineering at [[Binghamton University]]. Land joined the faculty at Binghamton after a long career at [[IBM]], and has publications in the fields of [[complex adaptive systems]], statistical learning theory, [[bioinformatics]], and cancer research.

With his background in creating code and years of work at companies like IBM, Land was instrumental in perfecting the weights and bias for codes that are capable of solving complex adaptive systems.

== Early life ==
Land worked at IBM for 27 years after being honorably discharged from the [[United States Air Force]]. He was responsible for research and development in statistical and [[stochastic process]]es, [[Bayesian inference]], [[artificial intelligence]], expert systems, coherent processing, [[neural networks]], and guidance and location systems. Land also participated in development and evaluation of guidance systems for the Saturn and Apollo vehicles, as well as worked with post-Apollo space configurations, including the [[Space Shuttle]]. He made calculations for the original [[Apollo mission]] to circle the moon and come back to Earth. The initial conditions in his calculation included the then-nine planets as well as all of their then-known moons.

{{Democracy}}
In [[political science]], a '''wave of democracy''' refers to a major surge of [[democracy]] in history. The term "Third Wave of Democracy" was first coined by [[Samuel P. Huntington]], a political scientist at [[Harvard University]] in his article published in the ''[[Journal of Democracy]]'' and further expounded in his 1991 book ''[[The Third Wave: Democratization in the Late Twentieth Century]]''. 

Huntington describes global democratization as coming in three waves, the first beginning in the early 19th century and the third being a current event.&lt;ref name="huntington"&gt;{{cite news 
 
|url=http://www.4uth.gov.ua/usa/english/politics/whatsdem/whatdm13.htm 
|title=What Is Democracy? - Democracy's Third Wave 
|publisher=U.S. State Department
|accessdate=2007-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars, such as Seva Gunitsky of University of Toronto, have referred to 13 waves from the 18th century to the Arab Spring (2011-2012).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gunitsky|first=Seva|date=2018|title=Democratic Waves in Historical Perspective|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/democratic-waves-in-historical-perspective/9452AFC439DD960F4D219246A7E7F51E|journal=Perspectives on Politics|language=en|volume=16|issue=3|pages=634–651|doi=10.1017/S1537592718001044|issn=1537-5927|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Huntingon's three waves==
===First wave=== 
The First wave of democracy began in the early 19th century when [[suffrage]] was granted to the majority of white males in the [[United States]] ("[[Jacksonian democracy]]"). At its peak, the first wave saw 29 democracies in the world. This continued until 1922, when [[Benito Mussolini]] rose to power in [[Italy]]. The ebb of the first wave lasted from 1922 until 1942, during which the number of democracies in the world dropped to a mere 12.&lt;ref name ="huntington"/&gt;

===Second wave===

The Second wave began following the Allied victory in [[World War II]], and crested nearly 20 years later in 1962 with 36 recognised democracies in the world. The Second wave ebbed as well at this point, and the total number dropped to 30 democracies between 1962 and the mid-1970s. But the "flat line" would not last for long, as the third wave was about to surge in a way no one had ever seen.&lt;ref name ="huntington"/&gt;

Scholars have noted that the appearance of "waves" of democracy largely disappears when women's suffrage is taken into account; moreover, some countries change their positions quite dramatically: [[Switzerland]], which is typically included as part of the first wave, did not grant women the right to vote until 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Paxton, Pamela. (2000). “Women's Suffrage in the Measurement of Democracy: Problems of Operationalization.” ''Studies in Comparative International Development'' 35(3): 92-111&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third wave===

The Third wave began in 1974 ([[Carnation Revolution]], Portugal) and included the historic democratic transitions in Latin America in the 1980s, Asia Pacific countries and regions ([[Philippines]], [[South Korea]], and [[Taiwan]]) from 1986 to 1988, Eastern Europe after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and sub-Saharan Africa beginning in 1989. The expansion of democracy in some regions was stunning. In Latin America only Colombia, Costa Rica, and Venezuela were democratic by 1978 and only Cuba and Haiti remained authoritarian by 1995, when the wave had swept across twenty countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schenoni, Luis and Scott Mainwaring|title=Hegemonic Effects and Regime Change in Latin America|journal=Democratization|doi=10.1080/13510347.2018.1516754|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13510347.2018.1516754?journalCode=fdem20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exact tallies of the number of democracies vary depending on the criteria used for assessment, but by some measures there are well over 100 democracies in the world today{{when|date=November 2016}}, a marked increase in just a few decades.{{cn|date=November 2016}}  Many of these newer democracies are not fully "consolidated," however, meaning that while they have electoral institutions in place, political democracy remains fragile.  Reasons for this fragility include economic instability, continued elite dominance of politics, ongoing military interference in civilian affairs, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Larry. (1996). “Is the Third Wave Over?” ''Journal of Democracy'' 7(3).&lt;/ref&gt;

Countries undergoing or having undergone a transition to democracy during a wave are subject to [[democratic backsliding]]. Political scientists and theorists believe that the third wave has crested and will soon begin to ebb, just as its predecessors did in the first and second waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zagorski|first=Paul W.|title=Democratic Breakdown in Paraguay and Venezuela: The Shape of Things to Come for Latin America?|journal=Armed Forces &amp; Society|year=2003|volume=30|issue=1|pages=87–116|doi=10.1177/0095327X0303000104|url=http://afs.sagepub.com/content/30/1/87.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in the period immediately following the onset of the "war on terror" after the [[September 11, 2001]] attacks on the United States, some backsliding was evident.  How significant or lasting that erosion is remains a subject of debate.

After the Great Recession of 2008, a number of countries backslided from democracy including Thailand, Cambodia, Philippines, Turkey, Hungary, Poland, Honduras and the Maldives. Some other countries have had democratic transitions however, such as Tunisia and the Gambia. There has also been limited democratic reform in some countries, such as Burma and Morocco. {{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Arab Spring==
Experts have associated the collapse of several dictatorships in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], phenomenon known as Arab Spring, with the events which followed the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Eastern Europe]]. The similarity between the two phenomena inspired hope for a fourth wave of [[democratization]]. However, a few months after the apparent beginning of the transition, most of the Arab political openings closed, causing an inevitable pull-back. One of the most alarming cases was that of Egypt, where the government, controlled by the military, did not facilitate the democratic transition in any way. On the contrary, it strove to silence the protests by arresting peaceful protesters and by “trying them in military tribunals.”{{fact|date=March 2018}} A concrete example is provided by the story of [[Maikel Nabil Sanad|Maikel Nabil]], an Egyptian blogger convicted to be imprisoned for three years for “insulting the [[military]] establishment.” The main causes of the regression and crisis in all the affected countries are attributed to corruption, unemployment, social injustice, and autocratic political systems.

Despite the apparently unsolvable situation, the [[United Nations|UN]], under the administration of [[Ban Ki-moon|Ban Ki-Moon]], tried to work as a mediator between the governments and the protesters. Moreover, according to [[Larry Diamond]], the engagement of the [[United States|United States of America]] in the democratic transition of the Arab world was fundamental. He attributed to the country the role of mentor and example for the newborn democracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2011-05-22/fourth-wave-or-false-start|title = A Fourth Wave or False Start?|website = Foreign Affairs|access-date = 2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Digital media]] played a much longer term role in creating favorable conditions for uprisings, helped to publicize key igniting events, and then facilitated those uprisings and their diffusion; but digital media did not do this alone or as suddenly as some observers have claimed. The story of the Arab Spring, according to Howard and Hussain, began over a decade ago as Internet access and mobile phones began to diffuse rapidly through North Africa and the Middle East. The citizens that could afford internet access, the wealthy and powerful mostly, played a huge role in the [[Egypt]], [[Tunisia]], and [[Bahrain]] [[Rebellion|uprisings]]. Over time, online criticisms of regimes became more public and common, setting the stage for the [[Arab Spring]]. Digital media also allowed women and other minorities to enter these political discussions, and, ultimately, the ensuing protests and revolutions as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Howard|first = Phillip N. |date= 2013 |title= Democracy’s Fourth Wave?

In mathematics applied to the study of networks, the '''Wiener connector''', named in honor of chemist [[Harry Wiener]] who first introduced the [[Wiener Index]], is a means of maximizing efficiency in connecting specified "query vertices" in a network. Given a [[connected graph|connected]], [[undirected graph]] and a set of query vertices in a graph, the '''minimum Wiener connector''' is an [[induced subgraph]] that connects the query vertices and minimizes the sum of [[shortest path]] distances among all pairs of vertices in the subgraph. In [[combinatorial optimization]], the '''minimum Wiener connector problem''' is the problem of finding the minimum Wiener connector. It can be thought of as a version of the classic [[Steiner tree problem]] (one of [[Karp's 21 NP-complete problems]]), where instead of minimizing the size of the tree, the objective is to minimize the distances in the subgraph.&lt;ref name="steiner"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hwang|first1=Frank|last2=Richards|first2=Dana|last3=Winter|first3=Dana|last4=Winter|first4=Pawel|title=The Steiner Tree Problem|journal=Annals of Discrete Mathematics|date=1992|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/bookseries/01675060/53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dimacs"&gt;[http://dimacs11.cs.princeton.edu/ DIMACS Steiner Tree Challenge]&lt;/ref&gt;

The minimum Wiener connector was first presented by Ruchansky, et al. in 2015.&lt;ref name="sigmod"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Bonchi|first2=Francesco|last3=Garcia-Soriano|first3=David|last4=Gullo|first4=Francesco|last5=Kourtellis|first5=Nicolas|date=2015|year=|title=The Minimum Wiener Connector|arxiv=1504.00513|journal=SIGMOD|volume=|pages=|via=|last1=Ruchansky|first1=Natali|bibcode=2015arXiv150400513R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The minimum Wiener connector has applications in many domains where there is a graph structure and an interest in learning about connections between sets of individuals. For example, given a set of patients infected with a viral disease, which other patients should be checked to find the culprit? Or given a set of proteins of interest, which other proteins participate in pathways with them?

==Problem definition==
The [[Wiener index]] is the sum of shortest path distances in a (sub)graph. Using &lt;math&gt;d(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; to denote the shortest path between &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, the Wiener index of a (sub)graph &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;W(S)&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as
: &lt;math&gt;W(S) = \sum_{(u, v) \in S} d(u,v)&lt;/math&gt;.

The minimum Wiener connector problem is defined as follows. Given an undirected and unweighted graph with vertex set &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and edge set &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; and a set of query vertices &lt;math&gt;Q\subseteq V&lt;/math&gt;, find a connector &lt;math&gt;H\subseteq V&lt;/math&gt; of minimum Wiener index. More formally, the problem is to compute
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname*{arg\,min}_H W(H\cup Q)&lt;/math&gt;,
that is, find a connector &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; that minimizes the sum of shortest paths in &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.

==Relationship to Steiner tree==
[[File:SteinerExample nicer.pdf|thumb|upright=2.0|The optimal solutions to the Steiner tree problem and the minimum Wiener connector can differ. Define the set of query vertices ''Q'' by ''Q'' = {''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;hellip;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;}. The unique optimal solution to the Steiner tree problem is ''Q'' itself, which has Wiener index 165, whereas the optimal solution for the minimum Wiener connector problem is ''Q'' ∪ {''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}, which has Wiener index 142.]]
The minimum Wiener connector problem is related to the [[Steiner tree problem]]. In the former, the [[objective function]] in the minimization is the Wiener index of the connector, whereas in the latter, the objective function is the sum of the weights of the edges in the connector. The optimum solutions to these problems may differ, given the same graph and set of query vertices. In fact, a solution for the Steiner tree problem may be arbitrarily bad for the minimum Wiener connector problem; the graph on the right provides an example.

== Computational complexity ==

===Hardness===
The problem is [[NP-hard]], and does not admit a [[polynomial-time approximation scheme]] unless [[P = NP|'''P''' = '''NP''']].&lt;ref name="sigmod"/&gt; This can be proven using the [[inapproximability]] of [[vertex cover]] in bounded degree graphs.&lt;ref name="dinursafra"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dinur|first1=Irit|last2=Safra|first2=Samuel|title=On the hardness of approximating minimum vertex cover|journal=Annals of Mathematics|date=2005|doi=10.4007/annals.2005.162.439|volume=162|pages=439–485}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no polynomial-time approximation scheme, there is a polynomial-time constant-factor approximation—an algorithm that finds a connector whose Wiener index is within a constant multiplicative factor of the Wiener index of the optimum connector. In terms of [[complexity class]]es, the minimum Wiener connector problem is in '''[[APX]]''' but is not in '''PTAS''' unless '''P''' = '''NP'''.

=== Exact algorithms ===
An exhaustive search over all possible subsets of vertices to find the one that induces the connector of minimum Wiener index yields an algorithm that finds the optimum solution in &lt;math&gt;2^{O(n)}&lt;/math&gt; time (that is, [[exponential time]]) on graphs with ''n'' vertices. In the special case that there are exactly two query vertices, the optimum solution is the [[shortest path]] joining the two vertices, so the problem can be solved in [[polynomial time]] by computing the shortest path. In fact, for any fixed constant number of query vertices, an optimum solution can be found in polynomial time.

=== Approximation algorithms ===
There is a constant-factor approximation algorithm for the minimum Wiener connector problem that runs in time &lt;math&gt;O(q (m \log n + n \log^2 n))&lt;/math&gt; on a graph with ''n'' vertices, ''m'' edges, and ''q'' query vertices, roughly the same time it takes to compute shortest-path distances from the query vertices to every other vertex in the graph.&lt;ref name="sigmod"/&gt; The central approach of this algorithm is to reduce the problem to the vertex-weighted Steiner tree problem, which admits a constant-factor approximation in particular instances related to the minimum Wiener connector problem.

==Behavior==

The minimum Wiener connector behaves like [[Centrality#Betweenness centrality|betweenness centrality]].

When the query vertices belong to the same community, the non-query vertices that form the minimum Wiener connector tend to belong to the same community and have high centrality within the community.  Such vertices are likely to be influential vertices playing leadership roles in the community. In a [[social network]], these influential vertices might be good users for spreading information or to target in a viral marketing campaign.&lt;ref name="viral"&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Oliver | last1=Hinz | first2=Bernd | last2=Skiera | first3=Christian | last3=Barrot | first4=Jan U. | last4=Becker | title=Seeding Strategies for Viral Marketing: An Empirical Comparison | journal=Journal of Marketing | volume=75 | number=6 | pages=55–71 | year = 2011 | doi=10.1509/jm.10.0088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the query vertices belong to different communities, the non-query vertices that form the minimum Wiener connector contain vertices adjacent to edges that bridge the different communities. These vertices span a [[Social Network#Structural holes|structural hole]] in the graph and are important.&lt;ref name="structhole"&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Lou|first1=Tiancheng|last2=Tang|first2=Jie|title=Mining Structural Hole Spanners Through Information Diffusion in Social Networks|booktitle=Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on World Wide Web|date=2013|isbn=9781450320351|location=Rio de Janeiro, Brazil|pages=825–836|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2488388.2488461|publisher=International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The minimum Wiener connector is useful in applications in which one wishes to learn about the relationship between a set of vertices in a graph. For example,
* in [[biology]], it provides insight into how a set of proteins in a [[protein–protein interaction]] network are related,
* in [[social network]]s (like [[Twitter]]), it demonstrates the communities to which a set of users belong and how these communities are related,
* in [[computer network]]s, it may be useful in identifying an efficient way to route a [[multicast]] message to a set of destinations.

The '''''Zeitschrift für die Alttestamentliche Wissenschaft''''' ('''''ZATW'''''/'''''ZAW''''') is an academic German journal established in 1881. It is concerned with theological, linguistic and historical criticism of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. Formerly, it represented a strictly Protestant point of view on the [[Old Testament]]. At the present time, it is more [[Ecumenism|ecumenical]], also representing Catholic and Jewish points of view.

Its first editor was [[Bernhard Stade]]. 
Currently, the journal is edited by [[Hans-Christoph Schmitt]] and [[Ernst-Joachim Waschke]] and published by [[Walter de Gruyter]]. It is edited two times per year in both a printed version and an internet version ({{ISSN|1613-0103}}). The majority of articles are written in German, but some of them are written in English and French.

A companion to the ''ZAW'' journal is the ''[[Zeitschrift für die Neutestamentliche Wissenschaft]]'' (ZNW).
