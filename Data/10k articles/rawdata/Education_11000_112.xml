'''Calliope: Pittsburgh Folk Music Society''' is an organization that promotes [[folk music]] and [[folk dance]] in the [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], area.  The Society started in the late 1960s, when performances were often held in George Balderose's house.  As time went on, the Society grew and eventually began renting out other performance venues for its shows.  Since 1976, Calliope has been a nonprofit educational and presenting organization that promotes and preserves traditional and contemporary folk music and its allied arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calliopehouse.org/about.htm Calliope: Pittsburgh Folk Music Society&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, Calliope sponsors various musical performances, a school of music, and now [[Rootz: The Green City Music Festival]].

Calliope's yearly concert series features performances by many well-known musicians in various musical genres, and these performances are typically held in the [[Carnegie Lecture Hall]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=40.44230,-79.94980&amp;spn=0.01,0.01&amp;t=m&amp;q=40.44230,-79.94980 The Carnegie Lecture Hall's coordinates at Google Maps]&lt;/ref&gt; which is located in the back of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History complex in the [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland]] neighborhood of [[Pittsburgh]].

The '''China Girls Mathematical Olympiad''' ('''CGMO''') is a [[list of math competitions|math competition]] with a [[Mathematical proof|proof]]-based format similar to the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]]. It was originally organized in 2002 for teams of girls representing different regions within [[China]].  Later, the Chinese organizers decided to invite other nations to send teams of girls from their countries.  [[Russia]] has participated at least since 2004.  The [[United States]] participated in 2007-2012.

The '''German education system''' or '''continental education system''' is a [[higher education model]], often contrasted with the [[Anglo-Saxon education system]] and the [[Scandinavian education system]]. It was the standard tertiary education model for most of the countries of [[Continental Europe]] before the implementation of the Anglo-Saxon model there due to the [[Bologna Process]].

A distinction exists between vocational education ([[Fachhochschule]]; i.e.: school of applied sciences) and academic higher education (at university).  This is also called [[dual education system]].

In contrast to the Anglo-Saxon model with common lower and higher academic degree for all subjects ([[Bachelor degree]] and [[Master's degree]], respectively), in the German model the degrees are ''[[Diplom]]'' for the more practical subjects such as i.e. [[engineering]], but also [[economics]] and [[business]] and (in [[Germany]] and [[Austria]]) the ''[[Magister Artium]]'' for the more theoretical subjects, such as [[social sciences]] or [[humanities]].

'''Curriculum for Excellence''' is the national [[curriculum]] for [[Scottish schools]] for learners from the ages 3-15. 

It was developed out of a 2002 consultation exercise – the 'National Debate on Education' – undertaken by the-then [[Scottish Executive]] on the state of school education. In response to the National Debate, Ministers established a Curriculum Review Group in November 2003 to identify the purposes of [[education]] for the 3-18 age range and to determine key principles to be applied in a redesign the curriculum. Its work resulted in the publication in November 2004 of the document ''A Curriculum for Excellence''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2004/11/20178/45862 |title=A Curriculum For Excellence by the Curriculum Review Group |date=1 November 2004 |publisher=The Scottish Government |accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This document identified four key purposes of education; those that enable young people to become, "successful learners, confident individuals, responsible citizens and effective contributors."

The Curriculum for Excellence was implemented in schools in 2010−11.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/thecurriculum/whatiscurriculumforexcellence/howwasthecurriculumdeveloped/processofchange/timeline.asp Timeline - Process of change - The curriculum in Scotland&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826113301/http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/thecurriculum/whatiscurriculumforexcellence/howwasthecurriculumdeveloped/processofchange/timeline.asp |date=26 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Its implementation is overseen by [[Education Scotland]].

In Scotland, councils and schools both have some responsibility for what is taught in schools and they must also take national guidelines and advice into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-23261286 |title=Why Scotland doesn't have a national curriculum |last=McIvor |first=Jamie |date=10 July 2013 |accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review was undertaken by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], having been commissioned by the Scottish Government to look at the broad general education.&lt;ref name="BBC 15Dec2015"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-35101835 |title=OECD passes judgement on Scotland's Curriculum for Excellence |work=BBC News |date=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qualifications==
New qualifications were set out in 2014 by the [[Scottish Qualifications Authority]] to meet with the Curriculum for Excellence. The new qualifications are Access 1, Access 2, [[National 3]], [[National 4]], [[National 5]], [[Higher (Scottish)|Higher]] and [[Advanced Higher]] which replaced the former [[Standard Grade]].

==Criticism==

Before its introduction, many within the Scottish teaching profession, including the teachers' trade union [[Educational Institute of Scotland|The Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS)]] and its members,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/8039474.stm |title=Union concern at new curriculum |date=8 May 2009 |work=BBC News |accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; believed that the Curriculum for Excellence was vague, in particular regarding its supposed 'outcomes and experiences'. There existed a fear that this imprecision would result in a lack of clarity in what was expected of teachers in the classroom and in the assessment of pupils' progress and attainment. 
At present (January 2013), the Curriculum is in the second school term of its first year of operation, and concerns remain about assessments. 

The original concerns led one of the most educationally successful Scottish local authorities, East Renfrewshire, to delay implementation of the secondary school phase of the new curriculum by one year. Some Scottish independent schools, including  [[St. Aloysius' College, Glasgow|St Aloysius' College]], in Glasgow, chose to do likewise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/education/leading-private-school-to-delay-start-of-new-exams.16785920 |title=Leading private school to delay start of new exams |last=Denholm |first=Andrew |date=23 February 2012 |work=The Herald (Glasgow) |accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[St George's School, Edinburgh|St George's School for Girls]], an independent school in Edinburgh, decided not to adopt the Curriculum for Excellence and offered the [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] for pupils entering their fourth year (English Year 10) classes from 2013 onwards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20872">{{Critical pedagogy}}
The '''ecopedagogy''' movement is an outgrowth of the theory and practice of [[critical pedagogy]], a body of educational praxis influenced by the philosopher and educator [[Paulo Freire]]. Ecopedagogy's mission is to develop a robust appreciation for the collective potentials of humanity and to foster social justice throughout the world. It does so as part of a future-oriented, ecological and political vision that radically opposes the globalization of ideologies such as [[neoliberalism]] and [[imperialism]], while also attempting to foment forms of critical [[Ecological literacy|ecoliteracy.]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

One of ecopedagogy's goals is the realization of culturally relevant forms of knowledge grounded in normative concepts such as [[sustainability]], planetarity (i.e. identifying as an earthling) and biophilia (i.e. love of all life).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Early history==
The ecopedagogy movement began in a Latin American educational context, growing out of discussions at the second [[Earth Summit]], held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1992. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Educators desired to present a theory and discourse about the interrelationship between society and the environment, a statement would eventually be ratified as the [[Earth Charter]] in 2000. &lt;ref&gt;Freire, P. 2000. ''Pedagogia da Terra''. São Paulo, Brazil: Peiropolis.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 the First International Symposium on the Earth Charter in the Perspective of Education was held by the [http://www.paulofreire.org/ Instituto Paulo Freire, Brasil] directed by Moacir Gadotti and in collaboration with the Earth Council and [[UNESCO]]. This was soon followed by the First International Forum on Ecopedagogy. As a result of these conferences, the Ecopedagogy Charter was also formed, launching the spread of ecopedagogy seminars and programs around the world. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Objectives and aims==

Ecopedagogy's primary goal is to create a "planetary consciousness" through revolutionary teaching and learning.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowers|first=C.A.|date=2004|title=Revitalizing the Commons or an Individualized Approach to Planetary Citizenship: The Choice Before Us|url=|journal=Educational Studies|volume=36:1|pages=|via=Taylor &amp; Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement aims to create educational programs that interrogate the intersection of social, political, economic and environmental systems. As an outgrowth of critical pedagogy, ecopedagogy critiques [[environmental education]] and [[education for sustainable development]] as vain attempts by mainstream forms of pedagogy seeking to appear relevant regarding current issues of environmental degradation. &lt;ref&gt;Kahn, Richard. (2008). ''From Education for Sustainable Development to Ecopedagogy: Sustaining Capitalism or Sustaining Life?'' Green Theory &amp; Praxis: The Journal of Ecopedagogy. 4:1&lt;/ref&gt; It is critical of mainstream representations of nature that are potentially informed by racist, sexist, and classist values, &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and wary of the tendency of "[[greenwashing]]" of environmental terminology. &lt;ref&gt;Bowers, C.A. 2010. Educational Reforms that Foster Ecological Intelligence. ''Education and the Environment'' Vol. 37, No. 4, pp. 9–31&lt;/ref&gt; 

While members of the ecopedagogy movement recognize that environmental education can accomplish some positive change, they question the ways in which environmental education (especially within global north) is often reduced to forms of experiential pedagogy and [[outdoor education]] without questioning the mainstream experience of nature as pristine wilderness. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Ecopedagogy points out that environmental education is often tethered to state and corporate-sponsored science and social studies standards or fails to articulate the political necessity for widespread understanding of the unsustainable nature of modern lifestyles'''.''' However, ecopedagogy has tried to utilize the ongoing United Nations Decade of Educational for Sustainable Development (2005–2015) to make strategic interventions on behalf of the oppressed, using it as an opportunity to unpack and clarify the concept of [[Sustainable development|sustainable development.]]

Ecopedagogy scholar Richard Kahn describes the three main goals of the ecopedagogy movement to be:

# Creating opportunities for the proliferation of ecoliteracy programs, both within schools and society.
# Bridging the gap of praxis between scholars and the public (especially activists) on ecopedagogical interests.
# Instigating dialogue and self-reflective solidarity across the many groups among educational left, particularly in light of the existing planetary crisis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Angela Antunes and Moacir Gadotti (2005) write:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Ecopedagogy is not just another pedagogy among many other pedagogies. It not only has meaning as an alternative project concerned with nature preservation (Natural Ecology) and the impact made by human societies on the natural environment (Social Ecology), but also as a new model for sustainable civilization from the ecological point of view (Integral Ecology), which implies making changes on economic, social, and cultural structures."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to [[Social movement theory|social movement theorists]] Ron Ayerman and Andrew Jamison, there are three broad dimensions of environmentally related movements: cosmological, technological, and organizational.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In ecopedagogy, these dimensions are outlined by Richard Kahn (2010) as the following:

* The cosmological dimension focuses on how [[Ecological literacy|ecoliteracy]], i.e. understanding the natural systems that sustain life, can transform people’s worldviews. For example, assumptions about society’s having the right to exploit nature can be transformed into understanding of the need for ecological balance to support society in the long term. The success of such ‘cosmological’ thinking transformations can be assessed by the degree to which such paradigm shifts are adopted by the public.
* The technological dimension is two-fold: critiquing the set of polluting technologies that have contributed to traditional development as well as some which are used or misused under the pretext of sustainable development; and promoting clean technologies that do not interfere with ecological and social balance.
* The organizational dimension emphasizes that knowledge should be of and for the people, thus academics should be in dialogue with public discourse and social movements. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Discussion of term in literature==

Ecopedagogy is not the collection of theories or practices developed by any particular set of individuals. Rather, akin to the [[World Social Forum]] and other related forms of contemporary popular education strategies, it is a worldwide association of critical educators, theorists, non-governmental and governmental organizations, grassroots activists and concerned citizens who engage in ongoing dialogue and political action. This process attempts to develop ecopedagogical praxis in relation to the needs of particular places, groups and time periods.

The earliest use of the term "ecopedagogy" may have been by de Haan (1984) in a now little known German text &lt;ref&gt;de Haan, G. 1984. Die Schwierigkeiten der Padagogik. In Beer &amp; de Haan (Eds.), ''Okopadagogik. Aufstehen gegen den Untergang der Natur''. Weinheim, Basel: Beltz: pp.&amp;nbsp;77–91.&lt;/ref&gt;. Shortly thereafter, in the first known English use of the term, Gronemeyer (1987) described ecopedagogy as the merging of environmentalist politics and adult education. &lt;ref&gt;Gronemeyer, M. 1987. Ecological Education a Failing Practice? Or: Is the Ecological Movement an Educational Movement? In W. Lierman &amp; J. Kulich (Eds.), Adult Education and the Challenge of the 1990s. London: Croom Helm.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecopedagogy has also been discussed by Ahlberg (1998) &lt;ref&gt;Ahlberg, M. 1998. Ecopedagogy and Ecodidactics: Education for Sustainable Development, Good Environment and Good Life. ''Bulletins of the Faculty of Education''. No: 69.University of Joensuu.&lt;/ref&gt; ; Jardine (2000) &lt;ref&gt;Jardine, D. W. 2000. ''“Under the Tough Old Stars”: Ecopedagogical Essays''. Brandon, Vermont: Solomon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;; Petrina (2000) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petrina|first1=S|year=2000|title=The Political Ecology of Design and Technology Education: An Inquiry into Methods|url=|journal=International Journal of Technology and Design Education|volume=10|issue=3|pages=207–237|doi=10.1023/a:1008955016067}}&lt;/ref&gt;; Yang &amp; Hung (2004) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=S. K.|last2=Hung|first2=R.|year=2004|title=Towards Construction of an Ecopedagogy Based on the Philosophy of Ecocentrism|url=|journal=Journal of Taiwan Normal University|volume=49|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and Payne (2005) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Payne|first1=P|year=2005|title=Growing Up Green|url=|journal=Journal of the HEIA|volume=12|issue=3|pages=2–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The work of Lummis (2002) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lummis|first1=G|year=2002|title=Globalisation: Building a Partnership Ethic for an Ecopedagogy in Western Australia|url=|journal=The Australian Journal of Teacher Education|volume=27|issue=1|doi=10.14221/ajte.2002v27n1.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; shares some sympathies, such as a critical theory approach.

Ironically, at the same time it was coined by Freire's friend-cum-critic [[Ivan Illich]] (1988) to describe an educational process in which educators and educands become inscribed in abstract pedagogical systems, resulting in pedagogy as an end and not a means.&lt;ref&gt;Illich, I. 1988. Ecopedagogia. ''Alternativas II''. Mexico: Joaquín Mortiz / Planeta.&lt;/ref&gt; As used by Illich, ecopedagogy is represented by forms of education that seek the total administration of life through mandatory pedagogical experiences of systemization. As such, he believed that the movements for lifelong education and the creation of global classrooms (Illich &amp; Verne, 1981) by bureaucratic educational institutions exemplified such approaches. However, he was also critical of popular environmentalist pedagogy attempting to mobilize people's sentiments for solutions to problems such as global warming, hunger, and rainforest destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Illich, I. &amp; E. Verne. 1981. ''Imprisoned in the Global Classroom''. London: Writers &amp; Readers.&lt;/ref&gt; Illich's point was that such an ecopedagogy works on a problems/solutions axis that implies a global [[managerialism]] that is abhorrent to truly sustainable living in the world. This is a different idea from the way the term and concept is being defined and utilized in critical education circles today, though it is potentially of great importance for the future development of the ecopedagogy movement on the whole.

[[Paulo Freire]] was himself at work on a book of ecopedagogy upon his death in 1997, parts of which are included in his posthumous ''Pedagogy of Indignation'' (2004). &lt;ref&gt;Freire, P. 2004. ''Pedagogy of Indignation''. Boulder, CO: Paradigm Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Other influential books include: Francisco Gutierrez and Cruz Prado's ''Ecopedagogy and Planetary Citizenship'' (1999), &lt;ref&gt;Gutierrez, F. &amp; C. Prado. 1999. ''Ecopedagogia e Cidadania Planetaria''. São Paulo, Brazil: Cortez.&lt;/ref&gt; Moacir Gadotti's ''Pedagogy of the Earth'' (2000), &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Gadotti, M. 2003. Pedagogy of the Earth and the Culture of Sustainability. Paper presented at Lifelong Learning, Participatory Democracy and Social Change: Local and Global Perspectives conference, Toronto, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; and Richard Kahn's ''Critical Pedagogy, Ecoliteracy, and Planetary Crisis: The Ecopedagogy Movement''. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Kahn, Richard. Ecopedagogy: An Introduction. Counterpoints, Vol. 359, Critical Pedagogy, Ecoliteracy, and Planetary Crisis: the Ecopedagogy Movement. (2010), pp. 1–33.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Criticisms ==
Both supporters and critics of ecopedagogy agree that historically, critical educators in the West have been largely unsuccessful at addressing environmental issues in their classrooms.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McLaren and Houston|first=|date=2005|title=Revolutionary Ecologies: Ecosocialism and Critical Pedagogy|url=|journal=Educational Studies|volume=37:2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, much disagreement still exists between critics and supporters of ecopedagogy on the ethics, theoretical approach, and methodology of this pedagogical style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Houston, D and McLaren, P.|first=|date=2005|title=The Nature of Political Amnesia: A Response to C.A. 'Chet' Bowers|url=|journal=Educational Studies|volume=|pages=196-214|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One critic, C.A. Bowers, argues that if ecopedagogy (and the larger critical pedagogy of Freire and Gadotti) were universally adopted, it would contribute to the hegemonic spread of Western culture and systems, thereby choking out non-Western ways of thinking, viewing, and interacting with the human and built environments. Bowers further argues that adoption of Freirean ecopedagogy would hasten the existence of a world monoculture and would fail to address the systemic roots of the current ecological crisis and fail to protect the commons from further exploitation.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowers|first=C.A.|date=2005|title=How Peter McLaren and Donna Houston, and Other "Green" Marxists Contribute to the Globalization of the West's Industrial Culture|url=|journal=Educational Studies|volume=37:2|pages=185–195|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, ecopedagogy is akin to an educational Trojan horse that is little more than a vehicle for transmitting Western culture and domination. 

Moderate critics of ecopedagogy argue that the critical lens of ecopedagogy can be useful, but that its adherents must be actively critical of ecopedagogy itself. They argue that without a constant focus on understanding and fostering diversity in thought, culture, and ecosystem, ecopedagogy is meaningless and could be counter-productive to its aims.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gruenewald|first=David A.|date=2005|title=More than one profound truth: Making sense of divergent criticalities|url=|journal=Educational Studies|volume=|pages=206-214|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecopedagogy (and critical pedagogy) has also been heavily criticized for not being critical of the categories that underlie its work. Here, critics argue that in valuing individualism, ecopedagogy fails to attend to traditional eco-centered cultures' already deep connection to the non-human world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowers|first=C.A.|date=2012|title=Questioning the idea of the individual as an autonomous moral agent|url=|journal=Journal of Moral Education|volume=41:3|pages=301-310|via=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, some scholars from the eco- and critical pedagogical traditions fail to recognize how the "primary categories in classical liberal thought may operate in the discourse of critical pedagogy".&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martisewicz|first=Rebecca|date=2005|title=On Acknowledging Differences that Make a Difference: My Two Cents|url=|journal=Educational Studies|volume=|pages=215-224|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecopedagogy in action ==
Ecopedagogy emphasizes the necessity of praxis alongside theory. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Gaard, G. (2009). ''Children’s environmental literature: from ecocriticism to ecopedagogy.'' Neohelicon 36:321–334.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the specific ecopedagogy degree programs and Paulo Freire Institutes, there are many instances of ecological education that not only teach people the critical thinking of ecopedagogy but also engage them in learning through action. For example, a study conducted with 10-year-old children in West Scotland concluded that interactive dramatic education was successful in engaging students in ecological, social, and political dimensions of global problems such as solid waste and deforestation.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;McNaughton, M.J. (2010). ''Educational drama in education for sustainable development: ecopedagogy in action.'' Pedagogy, Culture &amp; Society. 18:3, 289-308.&lt;/ref&gt; The dramatic exercises required to make a decision or take a stance, thus strengthening their understanding and conviction of the issues. &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; And ecopedagogy is not limited to formal students; in Turkey, for example, participatory action research showed that an outdoor community-based ecopedagogy program for university professors was successful in the "promotion of public participation, the engagement of students, teacher and parents in local environmental issues, and the development of social capital to achieve environmental sustainability. &lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; By situating local knowledge within critical pedagogy and social activism, these projects can help universities to bridge the gap between academia and society."&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Mustafa, Y.U. et al. (2010). A Participatory Action Research Study of Nature Education in Nature: Towards Community-based Eco-pedagogy. International Journal of Progressive Education. 6:3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Greta Gaard outlines the necessity for children's environmental literature to encompass the following core aspects of ecopedagogy:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

* praxis
* teaching ABOUT the social and natural environment
* teaching IN the social and natural environment
* teaching THROUGH the social and natural environment
* teaching the connections of sustainability
* urgency &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The question of technology had become increasingly pertinent. &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Kahn, Richard. Technological Transformation as Ecopedagogy: Reconstructing Technoliteracy. Counterpoints, Vol. 359, Critical Pedagogy, Ecoliteracy, and Planetary Crisis: the Ecopedagogy Movement. (2010), pp. 61–80&lt;/ref&gt; While the production and consumption of technology largely has a negative effect on the environment and certain aspects of society-environment relations, technology still provides certain new avenues in ecopedagogy. For example, more people have access to information and collaboration through the internet and thus can engage in informal ecological education faster and in wider spheres. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Similarly, community projects to install solar panels or wind turbines or simple technology that help farms to transition to agroecology are examples of the uses of technology in ecopedagogy.

The 1981 '''Education Consolidation and Improvement Act''' (ECIA) reauthorized the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act]] (ESEA), significantly deregulating [[education in the United States]] and shifting a number of responsibilities back to the state level.&lt;ref&gt;Askins, Billy. "Exploring New Directions: Title I in the Year 2000." ERIC. Texas Tech Journal of Education, 1984.

State-Federal Education Policy, Historical Essay, Reagan Years. 2009. Web. 12 Aug. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the [[Reagan administration]]’s Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1981, this act curtailed federal intervention and funding for domestic social causes while expanding the role of state and local government in administering [[education]].&lt;ref&gt;Public Law 97-35, August 18, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Darling"&gt;Darling-Hammond, Linda, and Ellen L. Marks. The New Federalism in Education State Responses to the 1981 Education Consolidation and Improvement Act. Santa Monica, CA.: Rand, 1983. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This deregulation is symbolized by the reduced size of Title I, which was reduced from 75 pages to just 14.&lt;ref name="Puma"&gt;Puma, Michael.

According to the [[National School Boards Association]], ECIA said little of classroom instruction and provided little incentives to experiment or innovate their practice.&lt;ref name="Puma"/&gt; Part of the problem was that EICA was passed very quickly and its development was based on little legislative history.&lt;ref name="Darling"/&gt; By 1983, the influential [[A Nation at Risk]] report moved the debate around ECIA away from fiscal compliance and toward program excellence school improvement, and student achievement.&lt;ref name="Puma"/&gt; The subsequent Hawkins-Stafford Elementary and Secondary School Improvement Act of 1988 had this missing emphasis, by formally encouraging “program improvement” from the states.

Federal funding for education was cut by over $1 billion.&lt;ref name="York State Education Department 2009"/&gt; Title I, which was renamed Chapter I under ECIA, allocated $3.034 billion in FY 1982 from the federal government’s budget to support education.&lt;ref name="Darling"/&gt;  Most of these funds were distributed via [[formula grant]]s to local education agencies; state educational agencies only received a small amount of funding.&lt;ref name="Darling"/&gt; Chapter II funds amounted to $456 million in FY 1982 and were paid out to state education agencies depending on their school-age populations.&lt;ref name="Darling"/&gt; 80 percent of Chapter II funds were then distributed to local educational agencies on the basis of three major areas: basic skills development, educational improvement and support services, and special projects.&lt;ref name="Darling"/&gt; The remaining 20 percent of Chapter II funds were allocated by the state to cover expenditures related to [[curriculum development]], training, planning, technical assistance, administration, monitoring, and enforcement activities.&lt;ref name="Darling"/&gt; Finally, Chapter III specified the Secretary of Education’s power to issue regulations.&lt;ref name="Darling"/&gt;

'''Education in Papua New Guinea''' is managed through '''nineteen [[Provinces of Papua New Guinea|provinces]] and two district organisational units'''. It is tuition-free and attendance is not compulsory. With a literacy rate of 64.2%, [[Papua New Guinea]] has the lowest literacy rate in [[Oceania]].
 
==History==
The first school in Papua New Guinea was established in 1873 by English missionaries. Missionaries would continue providing the basis for education, with [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]] as primary languages. In 1914, as part of World War I, Australia took control over German New Guinea and English became the sole official language.
 
The Currie Commission was created in 1964 to investigate the establishment of higher education in the [[Territory of Papua and New Guinea]]. In 1965 the first university in Papua New Guinea, the [[University of Papua New Guinea]], was established. It was heavily influenced by the Australian education system.&lt;ref&gt; Richard Guy, Toshio Kosuge, Rieko Hayakawa (2000). ''Distance Education in the South Pacific: Nets and Voyages''. Institute of Pacific Studies, University of the South Pacific and Pacific Island Nations Fund, Sasakawa Peace Foundation. p. 115 &lt;/ref&gt;

Education in Papua New Guinea has been tuition-free since 2012, as one of the election promises of the [[People's National Congress (Papua New Guinea)|People's National Congress]].
 
==Provision==
Papua New Guinea's history of missionary education has led to a large part of education being provided by religious schools. The Department of Education has estimated that 29% of the country's lower secondary education is operated by churches. 3% is operated by private international schools, while the remainder is funded by the government.

==Educational Stages==
Papua New Guinea has an A-to-D grading system, with D being a failing grade.

'''First Student''', a division of [[FirstGroup|FirstGroup America]], is a brand used by the Scottish transport company [[FirstGroup]] for [[student transport]] in the United States. According to the company's website, it is the largest provider of [[School bus contractor|school bus services]] in the United States. The company operates out of 650 locations in 39 US states and eight [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]]s.&lt;ref name=Snapshot&gt;[http://www.firststudentinc.com/about First Student in a snapshot] First Student&lt;/ref&gt;

With a workforce of 57,000 employees and a fleet of 48,000 vehicles, First Student transports approximately 6 million students daily.&lt;ref name=Snapshot/&gt; The company bus fleet drives over 600 million miles every year.&lt;ref name=Snapshot/&gt; First Student is the first school bus operator to integrate [[Zonar Systems|Zonar]], an [[fleet management|electronic fleet-management software]] program, into its fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=First Student To Equip Entire Fleet of 60,000 Vehicles With Zonar |url=http://www.firststudentinc.com/about/newsroom/2010/05/01/first-student-to-equip-entire-fleet-of-60-000-vehicles-with-zonar |website=www.firststudentinc.com |language=en |date=1 May 2010|quote=''...first as a pilot customer...''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Company history ==
{{Expand section|date=July 2011}}
First Student was created in 1999 when [[FirstGroup]] acquired the student transportation division of [[Ryder]]. During the next decade, the company expanded through the acquisition of other school bus contractors.  

By 2007, FirstGroup had built the First Student network into one of the largest school bus contractors in the United States, and in the same year, the company acquired [[Laidlaw]] in a merger, taking over its school transportation operations as well. 

The First Student brand has since been expanded into the [[United Kingdom|UK]], where [[First Student (United Kingdom)|First Student UK]] provides new student transportation services. 

One bus has toured the country{{which|date=October 2018}} on trials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_6290000/newsid_6294300/6294362.stm?bw=bb&amp;mp=wm&amp;news=1&amp;nol_storyid=6294362&amp;bbcws=1 BBC News Video - "Bus boss explains yellow buses"] Accessed 22 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''frictionless plane''' is a concept from the writings of [[Galileo Galilei]]. In his 1608 ''[[Two_New_Sciences#Day_3_Naturally_accelerated_motion|The Two New Sciences]]'', Galileo presented a formula that predicted the motion of an object moving down an [[inclined plane]]. His formula was based upon his past experimentation with free-falling bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, Stillman, ''Galileo’s Experimental Confirmation of Horizontal Inertia: Unpublished Manuscripts.'' ''Isis'': Vol. 64, No. 3, p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his model was not based upon experimentation with objects moving down an inclined plane, but from his conceptual modeling of the forces acting upon the object. Galileo understood the mechanics of the inclined plane as the combination of horizontal and vertical [[Vector (geometric)|vectors]]; the result of [[gravity]] acting upon the object, diverted by the [[slope]] of the plane.&lt;ref&gt;Settle, T. B. "An Experiment in the History of Science", ''Science'', 1061 ''133'' 19–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Galileo's equations do not contemplate [[friction]], and therefore do not perfectly predict the results of an actual [[experiment]]. This is because some energy is always lost when one mass applies a non-zero [[normal force]] to another. Therefore, the observed [[speed]], [[acceleration]] and distance traveled should be less than Galileo predicts.&lt;ref&gt; Jenkin, Fleeming. ''On Friction Between Surfaces at Low Speeds.'' Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Vol. 26 p. 93–94 &lt;/ref&gt; This energy is lost in forms like sound and heat. However, from Galileo's predictions of an object moving down an inclined plane in a frictionless environment, he created the theoretical foundation for extremely fruitful real-world experimental prediction.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, at p. 297–99&lt;/ref&gt;

Frictionless planes do not exist in the real world. However, if they did, one can be almost certain that objects on them would behave exactly as Galileo predicts. Despite their nonexistence, they have considerable value in the design of engines, motors, roadways, and even tow-truck beds, to name a few examples.&lt;ref&gt; Koyré, Alexandre ''Metaphysics and Measurement'', pp. 83–84 (1992). &lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of friction on an object moving down an inclined plane can be calculated as

:&lt;math&gt; F_\mathrm{f} = \mu_\mathrm{k} F_\mathrm{N}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; F_\mathrm{f} &lt;/math&gt; is the force of friction exerted by the object and the inclined plane on each other, parallel to the surface of the plane, &lt;math&gt;F_\mathrm{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[normal force]] exerted by the object and the plane on each other, directed perpendicular to the plane, and &lt;math&gt;\mu_\mathrm{k}&lt;/math&gt; is the coefficient of [[Friction#Kinetic_friction|kinetic friction]].&lt;ref&gt; Koyré, pp. 84–86. &lt;/ref&gt;

Unless the inclined plane is in a [[vacuum]], a (usually) small amount of [[potential energy]] is also lost to [[air drag]].

'''George Elliott Howard''' (1849&amp;ndash;1928) was an [[Americans|American]] educator and author, born at [[Saratoga, New York]].

He graduated from the [[University of Nebraska]] in 1876, studied in [[Europe]] at the universities of [[Munich]] and [[Paris]] (1876–1878), and was professor of history in the [[University of Nebraska]] from 1879 to 1891, and professor at [[Leland Stanford Junior University|Stanford]] from 1891 to 1901.

Professor Howard lectured at [[Cornell University]] (1902) and at the [[University of Chicago]] (1903–1904), then returned to the University of Nebraska.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2981">The '''Grundtvig programme''' is a European funding programme that is part of the [[European Commission]]’s [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/education/programmes/llp/index_en.html European Commission - The Lifelong Learning Programme 2007-2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319090812/http://ec.europa.eu/education/programmes/llp/index_en.html |date=2013-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and aims to strengthen the European dimension in adult education and lifelong learning across Europe.

The programme specifically seeks to address the educational challenge of an ageing population and to provide adults with alternative pathways to updating their skills and competences. The Grundtvig programme encompasses all types of learning, whether these take place in the 'formal' or 'non-formal' system of education for adults, or in more 'informal' ways, such as autonomous learning, community learning or experiential learning. 

It is open to anyone in adult education. This includes adult learners, teachers and trainers from a variety of organisations including local authorities, non-governmental organisations, charities, universities, community groups, etc. 'Adult' in the Grundtvig programme refers to all persons over the age of 25 and all persons aged 16–24 who are no longer undergoing initial education within the formal education system. 

The Grundtvig programme provides funding for a wide range of activities. Some examples are basic skills, foreign languages, parental education, arts and culture projects. All projects involve working with European partners and offer a learning and personal development experience for staff and learners.

'''Henry C. Groseclose''' was born on May 17, 1892.&lt;ref name="The HMDB"&gt;{{cite web|last=Prats|first=J.J|title=Henry C. Groseclose|url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=44219|publisher=The Historical Marker Database|accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in Ceres, Virginia for most of his life.&lt;ref name="The HMDB" /&gt; Mr. Groseclose completed his junior college degree from [[Washington and Lee University]] in 1917.&lt;ref name=agedteachers&gt;{{cite web|last=Hillson|first=John|title=The Role of Agricultural Education Teacher Educator Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow|url=http://pubs.aged.tamu.edu/jae/pdf/vol39/39-01-01.pdf|publisher=pubs.aged.tamu.edu|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his later years, he also received his [[bachelor’s degree]], as well as his [[master’s degree]], in [[agricultural education]] from [[Virginia Tech]].&lt;ref name="agedteachers"/&gt; While Mr. Groseclose was an agriculture teacher at the [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute]], he, along with three other agriculture teachers, [[Walter Stephenson Newman|Walter Newman]], [[Edmund Magill]] and [[Harry Sanders]], decided to establish a club for the farm boys in the school. The organization was formed in 1925.&lt;ref name="The HMDB" /&gt; Groseclose named the organization the [[Future Farmers of Virginia]], or FFV for short.&lt;ref name=VirginiaRole&gt;{{cite web|last=Hillson|first=John|title=The Role of Virginia in the Development of the FFA|url=http://pubs.aged.tamu.edu/jae/pdf/vol34/34-02-37.pdf|publisher=pubs.aged.tamu.edu|accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 


The original meaning for the abbreviation FFV stood for the [[First Families of Virginia]].&lt;ref name="VirginiaRole"/&gt; The “first families” referred to the families of both [[George Washington]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]].&lt;ref name="VirginiaRole"/&gt; Referring to Washington and Jefferson, Groseclose once stated that, “The Future Farmers of America should follow the example of these great sons of early Virginia by using scientific knowledge, intelligence, and enthusiasm to the end that agriculture may again be known as the profession of the real aristocrat.”&lt;ref name=AgriculturalSocieties&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hillson |first1=John |title=Agricultural Societies as Antecedents of the FFA |url=http://pubs.aged.tamu.edu/jsaer/pdf/Vol51/51-00-102.pdf |publisher=pubs.aged.tamu.edu |accessdate=4 June 2013|author2=Bryant, Brad}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groseclose wrote the by-laws, as well as the constitution that the FFV would be based on.&lt;ref name="VirginiaRole"/&gt; 


In 1926, he also wrote, and brought into play, the formal ceremony that would take place as an organizational pattern to structure each meeting.&lt;ref name="AgriculturalSocieties"/&gt; Two years later, in 1928, the FFV became a nationwide organization. This developed the organization that is known today as the Future Farmers of America, or The [[National FFA Organization]], or just FFA for short. The by-laws drawn up by Henry Groseclose became the foundation of the newly national organization.&lt;ref name="VirginiaRole"/&gt; Also, the formal ceremony that Groseclose developed was taken on by the FFA as a national ritual that is still used today.&lt;ref name="AgriculturalSocieties"/&gt; Groseclose was a seventh degree [[The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry|Grange]] member,&lt;ref name="AgriculturalSocieties"/&gt; and he was also involved with the [[Free mason|Masons]], so it was no surprise when he developed levels of memberships for the FFV, which transferred through to the FFA, that were similar to the three leveled membership structure that the Masons uses. These three levels included the Greenhand, the Virginia Farmer and the Virginia Planter.&lt;ref name="VirginiaRole"/&gt; 


While the official emblem of the National FFA Organization was being drawn, Groseclose’s original emblem, which he hand drew himself, was highly considered and ended up playing a part in the emblem that is still the emblem of the National FFA Organization today.&lt;ref name=VirginiaFFA&gt;{{cite web|last=Virginia Association of Agricultural Educators and FFA Alumni|title=Virginia's Role in the Development of the FFA|url=http://www.vaffa.org/History/VirginiaFFA.html|publisher=Virginia FFA|accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The part of the emblem that was from Mr. Groseclose’s original drawing included a background setting of a half [[plow]]ed wheat field with an [[owl]] perched upon a spade of wheat in front of the field.&lt;ref name="VirginiaFFA"/&gt; 


Henry Groseclose served as the Executive Secretary of the National FFA Organization for two years between 1928 and 1930.&lt;ref name="The HMDB" /&gt; During his office of Executive Secretary, he announced at the national convention of 1930 that he had written, and would be releasing, an official FFA manual, which outlined the organization, procedures and structures of the National FFA Organization.&lt;ref name="Historical Review"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hoover|first1=Tracy|title=A Historical Review of Leadership Development in the FFA and 4-H|url=http://www.jae-online.org/attachments/article/167/Hoover_etal_48_3_100-110.pdf|publisher=jae-online|accessdate=4 June 2013|author2=Scholl, Jan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Groseclose also served as the Treasurer of the National FFA Organization for 11 years, between 1930 and 1941.&lt;ref name="The HMDB" /&gt; 


In September 1925, Henry Groseclose set his expectations for the members of the FFV, and the purpose of the establishment of the Future Farmers of Virginia was by saying, "In my opinion the farm boys of Virginia who are enrolled in vocational agriculture are equal to any other group of boys in the state. But somehow the boys themselves seem to have a feeling of inferiority. Especially is this true when the farm boy goes to the city and has to compete with his city cousin. This condition should not exist. I believe that a strong organization of our boys in agriculture would help them to overcome this handicap. Let's form an organization that will give them a greater opportunity for self-expression and for the development of leadership. In this way they will develop confidence in their own ability and pride in the fact that they are farm boys."&lt;ref name=HistoryofFFA&gt;{{cite web|last=Virginia Association of Agricultural Educators and FFA Alumni|title=History of the FFA|url=http://www.vaffa.org/History/History.html|publisher=Virginia FFA|accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mr. Henry C. Groseclose died on June 4, 1950.&lt;ref name="The HMDB" /&gt; In 2002, the [[Department of Historic Resources]] established a marker in Mr. Groseclose’s honor. It is Marker number KC-5 and it is displayed in [[Bland County, Virginia|Bland County]] of [[Ceres, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="The HMDB" /&gt;

'''Higher education in Norway''' is offered by a range of eight universities, nine [[Specialised university|specialised universities]], 24 [[university college]]s as well as a range of private university colleges.  The national higher education system is in accordance with the [[Bologna process]], with [[bachelor's degree]]s (''first cycle'', three years), master's degrees (''second cycle'', two years) and [[Doctorate|doctoral degrees]] (''third cycle'', three years). Acceptance is offered after finishing [[upper secondary school]] with general university admissions certification.

Public education is free, with an academic year with two [[semester]]s, from August to December and from January to June. The ultimate responsibility for the education lies with the [[Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research]].

== System ==

===Admission===
Acceptance to higher education requires either fulfilled three years of upper secondary school with general university admissions certification. This is awarded non-vocational students or vocational students who choose to not take their [[apprenticeship]]. Conversely study competence can be achieved by the so-called 23/5 rule where applicants must be 23 years of age and have a total of five years of upper secondary education and work experience as well as have passed courses in [[Norwegian (language)|Norwegian]], English, [[mathematics]], science and [[social studies]]. To be accepted as certain lines (for instance engineering) advanced courses in mathematics, [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] must be passed.

Admission to bachelor level programs is coordinated through the [[Norwegian Universities and Colleges Admission Service]] based on a point scale, with the highest ranking students offered a place. Points are awarded based on average grades from upper secondary school, but additional points are awarded students with secondary two-year course specialization, science specialization, age and fulfilled one year of higher education, [[military service]] or [[folk high school]]. Secondary school grades can be improved to increase points, but 40% of the places are only offered based on original transcripts without age or study points.

===Structure===
[[File:Norwegian Higher Education System.JPG|thumb|right|250px]]
In 2003 a national reform, called the Quality reform, was implemented throughout the entire national higher education system. Norway was one of the first countries in Europe to implement the [[European Higher Education Area|Bologna convention]], thus creating a 3+2+3 year system in accordance with the Bologna Process.

A further step was taken in 2005 when the Act Relating to Universities and University Colleges and the Private Higher Education Institutions Act were merged into one common Act, [[the Act relating to universities and university colleges]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regjeringen.no/upload/kilde/kd/reg/2006/0031/ddd/pdfv/273037-loven_higher_education_act_norway_010405.pdf Act relating to Universities and University Colleges] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521065800/http://www.regjeringen.no/upload/kilde/kd/reg/2006/0031/ddd/pdfv/273037-loven_higher_education_act_norway_010405.pdf |date=21 May 2011 }} published 09.02.2006&lt;/ref&gt; The common act ensures greater equality between the public and private higher education institutions, thus focusing more on the quality in higher education than ownership. The evaluation of Quality Assurance Systems at and accreditation of both public and private institutions are handled by a national agency for quality assurance, [[NOKUT]].

====First Cycle====
Most students that fulfill the requirements for entrance to higher education in Norway are accepted to three-year Bachelor programs.

====Second Cycle====
Entrance to the two-year master programs are based upon the academic qualifications (grades) from the bachelor level.

Some programs (including architecture, [[business management]] at [[NHH]], engineering at [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology|NTNU]]), [[Dental degree|Master of Dentistry]] and [[Master of Laws]] are five-year programs ([[one-tier]] degrees).

Three types of master's degrees are offered: [[Master of Science]] (science and business), [[Master of Philosophy]] (humanities and social studies) and [[Master of Technology]] (engineering).

=====Professional Degrees=====
Some professional oriented programs have been granted an exemption from the Bologna system. Physicians ([[cand.med.]]), veterinarians ([[cand.med.vet.]]), psychologist ([[cand.psychol.]]) and theologians ([[cand.theol.]]) are therefore still awarded degrees for six years of study.

====Third Cycle====
[[Doctor of Philosophy|Doctor Philosophae]] degrees are awarded after three years of research-oriented education. Most programs also include one year of compulsory teaching as part of the education, making the total length of the program four years.

====System of Grading====
According to the [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]]-system the grading are given according to scale of six grades, ranging from an A to F, with A being the best and E the worst passing grade. F is a fail.

A normal study progression awards 60 credits (stp) per year (30 per semester), most institutions either use a 7.5 or a 10 credit block system.

Examinations are usually held every semester, in December and June, although exceptions occur.

===Old system===
Prior to 2002 the higher education in Norway had a significantly different system of education with roots back to the start of higher education in the country. It was based on a 3.5 or 4 year [[cand.mag.]] degree supplemented with a Masters or ''hovedfag'' lasting 1.5 or 2 years. Total study time was five years within sciences while it was six years within social studies and humanities. Master's degrees were named based on the line of study, for instance [[cand.scient.]] within science, [[cand.polit.]] in political studies or [[cand.oecon.]] within economics. Certain professional studies, such as medicine, law, and some engineering and business administration courses had professional studies that offered full-length degrees (without issuing cand.mag. titles). The titles awarded were [[cand.jur.]] (law, 6 years), [[cand.med.]] (medical doctor, 6 years), [[cand.psychol.]] (doctor of psychology, 6 years), [[siviløkonom]] (business administration, 4 years) or [[sivilingeniør]] (engineering, 4.5 years). [[NHH]] had a monopoly educating siviløkonoms while [[Norwegian Institute of Technology|NTH]] had a monopoly educating sivilingeniørs. Doctorate studies were offered on top of the masters.

Grading was performed on a 1.0 to 4.0 system, with 1.0 as the best grade and 4.0 the worst passing grade. A total of 41 different grades could be awarded with the system. Credits (then called ''vekttall'') were issued based on a nominal study of 20 credits per year (or 10 per semester).

==Institutions==

===Universities===
Traditionally there were only four universities in Norway, located in [[Oslo]] (since 1811), [[Bergen]] (1948), [[Trondheim]] (1968) and [[Tromsø]] (1972). Since 2005 any college offering five master programs and four doctoral programs can title themselves a university, leading to the [[Norwegian College of Agriculture|Norwegian University of Life Sciences]], [[Stavanger University College]] and [[Agder University College]] converting to universities.

The public universities of Norway are:
* [[Nord University]] (Several campuses in North Trøndelag and Nordland counties)
* [[Norwegian University of Life Sciences]] (Ås)
* [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]] (Trondheim, Ålesund and Gjøvik)
* [[University of Agder]] (Kristiansand, Grimstad and Arendal)
* [[University of Bergen]]
* [[University of Oslo]]
* [[University of Stavanger]]
* [[University of Tromsø]]

Currently there are no private universities in Norway, although [[BI Norwegian Business School]] has tried to advance to a full university.

===Specialised universities===
There are six public and three private specialised universities in Norway, each functioning as a national competence centre for the field they represent. Six are located in Oslo, one is in Molde, one is in Bergen and one in Stavanger. The [[Norwegian Institute of Technology]] and the Norwegian College of Agriculture have converted to full universities.

*[[School of Mission and Theology]] in Stavanger, or ''Misjonshøgskolen'' ([http://www.mhs.no official site])

===University colleges===
The 23 university colleges in Norway are responsible for regional education of primarily bachelor level education within the fields of [[nursing]], [[teacher|teaching]], [[business management]], engineering and information technology, though most colleges also offer a number of other educations as well.

The public university colleges in Norway consist of:
*[[Bergen National Academy of the Arts]], or ''Kunsthøgskolen i Bergen'' ([http://www.khib.no official site])
*[[Bergen University College]], or ''Høgskolen i Bergen'' ([http://www.hib.no official site])
*[[Hedmark University College]], or ''Høgskolen i Hedmark'' ([http://www.hihm.no official site])
*[[Lillehammer University College]], or ''Høgskolen i Lillehammer'' ([http://www.hil.no official site])

The accredited private university colleges in Norway are:
*[[BI Norwegian Business School]], or ''Handelshøyskolen BI'' Dronning Mauds Minne Høgskole 
*[[Diakonhjemmet University College]], or ''Diakonhjemmet Høgskole'' ([https://web.archive.org/web/20080926124554/http://www.diakonhjemmeths.no/web/ official site])
*[[NLA University College]], or ''NLA Høgskolen'' ([https://web.archive.org/web/20140228002926/https://www.nla.no/eng/english-frontpage?lang=eng official site])
*[[Queen Maud University College]] or ''Dronning Mauds Minne Høgskole'' ([http://dmmh.no/ official site])

===Private institutions===
There are a number of private higher education institutions in Norway, although the public institution cover more than ninety per cent of the student population in the country, meaning that less than ten per cent of students attend private institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nokut.no/sw456.asp Higher Education in Norway] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915101246/http://www.nokut.no/sw456.asp |date=15 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The private institutions offer primarily programs and courses within popular fields of study where the number of public places is limited or offering accelerated courses. However some provide specialised courses not found in the public institutions such as Noroff University College in Kristiansand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noroff.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the private institutions are [[stiftelse|foundations]], either autonomous (like the [[BI Norwegian Business School]] and [[Campus Kristiania]]) or part of various religious societies, like the [[School of Missions and Theology]] or [[Queen Maud University College]].

Students attending private institutions may have to pay school fees equivalent to the entire cost of operating the education, though the [[Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund]] will grant loans to cover the [[tuition fee]]s.

==Student welfare and economics==
There are no [[tuition fee]]s for attending public higher education in Norway, as all the costs are covered by the Ministry of Education and Research.

Students are also given the opportunity to apply for financial support (a part loan/part grant) from the [[Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund]]. The main requirement for support from Fund is that you are a Norwegian citizen. However, foreign citizens may also be entitled to financial support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://lanekassen.no/nb-NO/Toppmeny/Languages/Financial-support-for-foreign-students/Who-is-eligible/ |title=Who is eligible? |access-date=13 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113061420/http://lanekassen.no/nb-NO/Toppmeny/Languages/Financial-support-for-foreign-students/Who-is-eligible/ |archive-date=13 November 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eligible applicants may be granted financial support (a part loan/part grant) of about [[Norwegian krone|NOK]] 90,000. It is initially given as a full loan, but upon completion of modules in the education around 40 percent of the amount is transferred to a scholarship/[[Grant (money)|grant]] if the modules are passed. There is no interest paid while taking the education.

While studying, all students belong to a [[student welfare organisation]] that takes care of such services as housing, on-campus dining, book stores, kindergartens, advisory services and some health care. Part of this is finances through a [[student fee]], typically at NOK 300–500 per semester. There are a total of 25 such organisations, each covering a geographic area and often consisting of more than one institution. The sole exception is Oslo where there are two.

==Programs==
The five main universities in Bergen, Oslo, Trondheim, Tromsø and Stavanger all offer a wide selection of courses within most fields, while certain minor fields have been left to the specialised universities, including veterinary studies and sports. Many educations are left to the regional colleges.

===Architecture===
Architecture is only offered at two public institutions, NTNU in Trondheim and the Oslo School of Architecture and Design. In addition the private college [[Bergen School of Architecture]] offers architect education. NTNU accepts students based on grades while the Oslo School accepts students based on a portfolio. [[Landscape architecture]] and [[area planning]] is offered at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences at Ås.

===Business administration===
Most business administrators are educated at the regional colleges throughout the country, with Bachelor programs offered in Alta, Tromsø, Narvik, Bodø, Steinkjer, Trondheim, Molde, Ålesund, Sogndal, Bergen, Haugesund, Stavanger, Kristiansand, Kongsberg, Oslo, Ås, Halden, Lillehammer, Gjøvik and Hamar. In addition NHH in Bergen is the specialised college offering the highest level of education within the field. Business administration is also offered at some private colleges, most notably the [[BI Norwegian Business School]] in Oslo.

Eight institutions offer a [[Master of Science in Business Administration]], also granting the right to use the protected title [[siviløkonom]]. These are [[Bodø Graduate School of Business]], [[Trondheim Business School]], Molde University College, the Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration, the University of Stavanger, the University of Agder, BI Norwegian Business School and the Norwegian University of Life Sciences. Until the 1980s this level of education was only offered at NHH.

===Engineering===
In general, three-year bachelor's degrees in engineering are offered throughout the country at the regional colleges, most dominantly within the fields of construction, chemistry, electronics and informatics, though many others also exist. Five-year [[Master of Technology]] degrees are offered as well, primarily at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim and the University of Stavanger (UiS), though also at some other institutions to a lesser degree. Candidates with three years of education can apply to attend the last two years at NTNU or UiS to complete a Master's study. All Master engineers can use the [[protected title]] [[sivilingeniør]]. NTNU offers 14 different programs in engineering, whereas UiS only offers 8 different studies in engineering.

===Law===
Juridical education is offered at the universities in Oslo, Bergen and Tromsø. Education lasts five years, and after that you are given the title "Master i Rettsvitenskap", meaning a legal skilled person. For becoming a lawyer you need to work as lawyer apprentice (advokatfullmektig) for at least two years and have had five cases before a judge.

===Medicine===
Medicine is offered at the four of the five major universities in Oslo, Bergen, Trondheim and Tromsø, who have close cooperation with the university hospitals in the cities. Medical education takes six years and still grants the old [[cand.med.]] degree. After school candidates are required 1.5 years of practice before being granted certification. After six additional years of work experience they are awarded specialist certification.

===Teaching===
There are two ways to become a qualified teacher in Norway. For primary and lower secondary levels a four-year general teacher education is offered at most regional colleges in the country. This education qualifies the teachers to teach all subjects offered in the lower levels of education in Norway, though it allows students to specialize in subjects. Preschool teaching is offered at some of the regional colleges too.

For upper secondary school taking a degree at a university within the appropriate subject is the preferred course of line. After taking a degree, either at Bachelor or Master level, a one-year course in [[pedagogy]] is required before teacher certification is granted. To teach a particular subject at the upper secondary level, 60 credits in the appropriate field is required, making most teachers qualified to teach two or three subjects, though these are not absolute requirements.

=== Sciences ===
Virtually all education within the sciences are offered at the five major universities, in Bergen, Oslo, Trondheim, Tromsø and Stavanger, though some regional colleges have one-years or perhaps Bachelor programs in certain fields.

The '''Interagency Language Roundtable''' ('''ILR''') is an unfunded organization comprising various agencies of the [[United States Federal Government]] with the purpose of coordinating and sharing information on foreign language activities at the federal level.

The ILR's primary function is to act as an avenue for the varying participating federal agencies to keep abreast of modern methods and technology regarding the teaching of language, the use of language, and any other language related issues.

==Membership==
The ILR membership consists of a large number of people with professional interest in language with regards to the teaching, learning, or use of language in a professional context. About 60% of the membership are federal employees.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtilr.org/FAQ.htm|title=ILR FAQ|publisher=ILR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Committees ===
Aside from general membership, the ILR has three standing special interests committees:
*Steering Committee
**The Steering committee is responsible for planning ILR direction and events, and is composed of members from eight different federal agencies.
*Testing Committee
*Training Committee
*Translation and Interpretation Committee.

Committees are chaired by federal employees from five different agencies.

Additionally, the ILR hosts the ILR Special Interest Group (SIG) on the Center for Advanced Study of Language (CASL). CASL SIG meetings, unlike ILR plenary meetings, are not open to general membership, allowing only federal representatives in attendance.

===Joining the ILR===
Any interested person may attend unrestricted ILR plenary meetings and events, requiring only two days advance registration via the ILR home page. To become an ILR member, a person must first join their mailing list. Joining a specific committee requires only notifying a co-chair of the committee involved, and regularly attending meetings. Further details are listed on the ILR website. Membership is free.

===Meetings===
Plenary meetings are held monthly between September and June. Lectures and demonstrations on linguistic general interest topics are featured at every plenary meeting. Prior to each plenary meeting, each committee meets to discuss specific topics of interest. Some committee meetings are not open to general membership, due to coverage of certain topics of federal interest. These meetings' attendance restrictions are announced in advance.

Most plenary meetings boast between 75 and 100 attendees.

===Officers===
All officers of the ILR are volunteers who hold full-time federal positions elsewhere.

The Foreign Service Institute, the National Cryptologic School, and the Defense Language Institute lend additional minor clerical assistance.

==Formation==
The origins of the ILR can be traced back to 1955, when the [[Foreign Service Institute|Foreign Service Institute's]] [[Howard Sollenberger]], the [[CIA|CIA's]] [[Clyde Sargent]], and [[James Frith]] of the [[USAF|Air Force]] Language Program, conversed regarding the need for communication and coordination between federal agencies in training, policies, and practices of foreign languages.

Subsequent meetings included attendance by members of the local academic community as well as [[Charles A. Ferguson|Charles Ferguson]], Director of the [[Center for Applied Linguistics]].

The ILR was formally institutionalized in 1973, after a study conducted by the [[General Accounting Office]] demonstrated the value of the organization.

==Contributions to the Field of Linguistics==
Since the 1950s, the ILR has made a number of contributions to the field of linguistics, both for American and foreign linguists, including, but not limited to:&lt;ref name="HIST"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtilr.org/ILR_History.htm|title=ILR History|publisher=ILR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[ILR scale|ILR Proficiency Level Descriptions]]&lt;ref name="PLD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtilr.org/Skills/index.htm|title=ILR PLD History|publisher=ILR}}&lt;/ref&gt; - This is a system of measuring the language proficiency of an individual, on a scale of 0 to 5. Proficiency level of 0 equates to no knowledge of a language, while the proficiency level of 5 equates to a highly educated foreigner or native speaker. Proficiency levels in excess of a whole number, but not reaching the next whole number are represented with the 'plus' sign, for example, a linguist who speaks at a near native level might be represented as having a 4+ level proficiency. (A similar system is used in the Userboxes of [[WP:Babel]].)
*ILR Translation Performance Skill Level Descriptions - Translation proficiency measurements based on the ILR Proficiency Level Descriptions, developed in 2005.
*ILR Interpretation Performance Skill Level Descriptions - Interpretation proficiency measurements based on the ILR Translation Performance Skill Level Descriptions, developed in 2006.
*Co-sponsorship with the National Virtual Translation Center of the “Languages of the World” website.
*The development of a widely used interagency training manual for oral proficiency testing candidates.

The '''International Conference on Bisexuality '''('''ICB'''), also known as the '''International BiCon''', was a periodic gathering of [[bisexual]] [[activists]] and [[academics]] from around the world.

Started by [[Fritz Klein (sex researcher)|Fritz Klein]] and a group of fellow activists, the first ICB was held in [[Amsterdam]] in 1991 and followed the concept of a [[BiCon (UK)|BiCon]] started in the UK in 1984. The last one was 2010 in London.[http://www.bisexualindex.org.uk/index.php/links]

The [[post-apartheid]] era provided South African Universities and [[Technikons]] the opportunity to further enhance existing international relations, or to establish new relationships, towards promoting education in South Africa in the context of [[Internationalization of Higher Education|internationalization]] of higher education. In 1992 already, Dr [[Derek Swemmer]] (Registrar: [[University of the Witwatersrand]]) and Dr [[Roshen Kishun]] (Registrar [[University of Natal]]) started discussions that focused on areas of mutual concern and interests. One of the key challenges were to set a common agenda for all South African tertiary institutions with a key focus on [[internationalisation]]. After a number of meetings between the various stakeholders, the International Education Association of South Africa (IEASA) was officially launched on 29 January 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10962/65356|title=10 years of IEASA history|date=2007|publisher=International Education Association of South Africa (IEASA)|others=Jooste, Nico.|isbn=1920176004|location=Port Elizabeth, South Africa|oclc=703219286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International Education Policy ==
The International Education Association of South Africa aims to draft, monitor and/or implement policies that contribute towards international education. To this end, IEASA promotes and maintains cooperative relationships with relevant government and other departments and bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ieasa.studysa.org/what-we-do/|title=What We Do {{!}} IEASA|work=IEASA|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Acaba's parents, Ralph and Elsie Acabá, from [[Hatillo, Puerto Rico]], moved in the mid-1960s to [[Inglewood, California]] where he was born.&lt;ref&gt;[http://astronomypr.com/articulos_acaba.html Astronomy PR] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506104134/http://www.astronomypr.com/articulos_acaba.html |date=2009-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They later moved to [[Anaheim, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Dena |last=Bunis |title=Teacher Is First Peace Corps Veteran To Be Named NASA Astronaut |url=http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2004/vol8n37/TchrPeacCorps.html |work=Orange County Register |date=May 10, 2004 |accessdate=March 31, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526230012/http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2004/vol8n37/TchrPeacCorps.html |archivedate=May 26, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since his childhood, Acaba enjoyed reading, especially [[science fiction]]. In school, he excelled in both science and math. As a child, his parents constantly exposed him to educational films, but it was the 8-mm film showing astronaut [[Neil Armstrong]]'s [[Project Apollo|Moon landing]] which really intrigued him about [[outer space]]. During his senior year in high school, Acaba became interested in [[scuba diving]] and became a certified scuba diver through a job training program at his school. This experience inspired him to further his academic education in the field of [[geology]].&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/postsecondary/features/F_Acaba_Interview_Text_E.html|title=Astronaut Candidate Interviews - Joseph Acaba|accessdate=November 21, 2007 |publisher=NASA|date=2006|author=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, he graduated with honors from [[Esperanza High School (Placentia, California)|Esperanza High School]] in Anaheim.&lt;ref name=missioneducator&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/space/preparingtravel/ascan_bio_acaba.html

== Education ==
In 1990, Acaba received his [[Bachelor's degree]] in [[Geology]] from the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] and in 1992, he earned his [[Master's degree]] in Geology from the [[University of Arizona]].

On May 6, 2004, Acaba and ten other people were selected from 99 applicants by NASA as astronaut candidates. NASA's administrator, Sean O'Keefe, in the presence of [[John Glenn]], announced the members of the "19th group of Astronaut Candidates", an event which has not been repeated since 1958 when the original group of astronauts was presented to the world. Acaba, who was selected as an Educator Mission Specialist, completed his astronaut training on February 10, 2006 along with the other ten Astronaut Candidates.&lt;ref name=missioneducator/&gt;&lt;ref name="announce"&gt;{{Cite web

===STS-119===
Acaba was assigned to the crew of [[STS-119]] as Mission Specialist Educator, which was launched on March 15, 2009 at 7:43&amp;nbsp;p.m., after NASA engineers repaired a leaky gas venting system the previous week, to deliver the final set of solar arrays to the International Space Station.&lt;ref name=ConsolidatedLaunch/&gt;&lt;ref name="crewlist"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2007/oct/HQ_07229_STS-119-Crew.html|title=NASA Assigns Crew for Final Solar Array Delivery to Station|accessdate=October 19, 2007 | publisher=NASA| date=2007| author=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acaba, who carried on his person a [[Flag of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican flag]], requested that the crew be awakened on March 19 (Day 5) with the Puerto Rico folklore song "Qué Bonita Bandera" (What a Beautiful Flag) referring to the Puerto Rican flag, written in 1971 by [[Florencio Morales Ramos]] (Ramito)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elnuevodia.com/no_suena_aqui,_pero_si_en_el_universo/547090.html El Nuevo Dia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104184724/http://www.elnuevodia.com/no_suena_aqui%2C_pero_si_en_el_universo/547090.html |date=2014-01-04 }}, (Spanish newspaper) Retrieved March 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and sung by Jose Gonzalez and Banda Criolla.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The main task of the EVA was to help move the CETA carts on the outside of the station to a different location. On March 28 the {{OV|103}} and its crew of seven safely touched down on runway 15 at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 3:14&amp;nbsp;p.m. EDT.

===Expedition 31/32===
On May 15, 2012, Acaba was one of three crew members launching from Kazakhstan aboard the [[Soyuz TMA-04M]] spacecraft to the International Space Station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2012-05-14 |url= http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/living/index.html |title = Three New Crew Members En Route to Station|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his fellow crew members, [[Gennady Padalka]] and [[Sergei Revin]], arrived and docked with the space station two days after launch, on May 17 at 4:36 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]. Acaba, along with Padalka and Revin, returned to Earth on September 17, 2012, after nearly 125 days in space.&lt;ref name=2012iss/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/lifestyle/2012/05/16/puerto-rican-astronaut-joins-russians-in-space-flight/ Puerto Rican Astronaut Joins Russians in Space Flight]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Between Space Missions===
Acaba served as the Branch Chief of the International Space Station Operations branch. The office is responsible for mission preparation and on-orbit support of space station crews.
Until being selected as flight engineer for [[Expedition 54]]\[[Expedition 55]] Acaba served as Director of Operations Russia in Star City supporting crew training in Soyuz and Russian Segment systems.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

===Expedition 53/54===
In 2017 it was announced that Acaba would be returning to the ISS for his third mission, onboard [[Soyuz MS-06]]. The Soyuz vehicle was originally slated to launch with a crew of 2, due to the Russian crew cuts on the ISS for 2017, however at short notice it was decided that the 3rd seat would be filled by an experienced astronaut and would be funded by Roscosmos to cancel out owed debts. Acaba's backup for the mission was [[Shannon Walker]], who should fly as prime crew on [[Soyuz MS-12]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacefacts.de/schedule/e_iss.htm Spacefacts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2017assignments"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-announces-upcoming-international-space-station-crew-assignments|title=NASA Announces Upcoming International Space Station Crew Assignments |date=March 28, 2017|publisher=NASA, press release 17-017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acaba launched on [[Soyuz MS-06]] on September 12, 2017, performing a 6 hour rendezvous with the ISS. On October 20, 2017, Acaba and [[Randy Bresnik]] performed an EVA to continue with the lubrication of the new end effector on the robotic arm, and to install new cameras. The duration was 6 hours and 49 minutes. &lt;ref name="EVAoct20"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/2017/10/20/expedition-53-spacewalk-successfully-comes-to-an-end/ |title=Expedition 53 Spacewalk Successfully Comes to an End |first=Melanie |last=Whiting| publisher=NASA |date=October 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the mission Acaba's home in Houston was flooded by Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Maria struck his native Puerto Rico&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/2017/Puerto_Rican_astronaut_gets_double_dose_of_hurricanes/id-386b2961da30412d80588d0b7d425c9e|title=Puerto Rican astronaut gets double dose of hurricanes|website=www.apnewsarchive.com|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Lyryx Learning''' (Lyryx) is an [[educational software]] company offering open educational resources (OERs) paired with affordable online homework for undergraduate introductory courses in Mathematics &amp; Statistics and Business &amp; Economics.

==History==
In 1997, Claude Laflamme and Keith Nicholson, Professors in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the [[University of Calgary]], began work on the design of online tools to support student learning in their classes. Laflamme and Nicholson developed and implemented a formative assessment system which provided immediate, substantive feedback to students based on their work.

In 2000, Laflamme and Nicholson, together with two software developers, Bruce Bauslaugh and Richard Cannings, formed Lyryx Learning Inc., to offer this platform in a number of quantitative disciplines. By 2010, Lyryx supported approximately 100,000 students and 2,000 instructors per year in Canada.

After several years of developing formative online assessment for content from various publishers, including  [[McGraw-Hill Ryerson]] in Canada and [[Flat World Knowledge]] in the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flatworld Knowledge|url=http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/flat-world-knowledge-lyryx-learning-team-up-offer-free-open-textbooks-with-integrated-1229314.htm|publisher=MarketWired}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyryx became a fully independent publisher supporting OERs in 2013 with the launch of '''Lyryx with Open Texts'''.
==Lyryx with Open Texts==

To support the use of OERs in large enrollment undergraduate introductory courses in Mathematics &amp; Statistics and Business &amp; Economics, Lyryx moved to a [[social enterprise]] business model: Funding from the online homework supports both the development and maintenance of OERs as well as contributions to the community. In addition, Lyryx also offers an option of free access to their online homework from an institution's computer labs.

Lyryx with Open Texts includes:

* &lt;u&gt;Adapted Open Texts&lt;/u&gt;: Open textbooks which can be distributed at no cost, and editorial services to adapt the open textbooks for each specific course. All textbooks are licensed under a [[Creative Commons]] license.
* &lt;u&gt;Formative Online Assessment&lt;/u&gt;: Algorithmically generated homework questions are automatically graded, and individualized feedback is also provided to the student.
* &lt;u&gt;Course Supplements&lt;/u&gt;: A wide variety of materials to support the instructor including slides, solutions manuals, and test banks. For select products, Lyryx offers source codes in an editable format in [[LaTeX]].
* &lt;u&gt; User Support&lt;/u&gt;: In-house support for both instructors and students, 365 days/year.

'''MaRRS International Spelling Bee''' is one of the [[Spelling bee|Spelling Bee]] competition held in Asia for school children. It is conducted by MaRRS Intellectual Services Pvt. Ltd. The assessment and learning materials for the M.I.S.B is created in association with expert faculty from the English and Foreign Language University (E.F.L.U),Hyderabad. The objective of the competition is to enhance the spelling and literary skills of children by encouraging them to explore the English language, expand their vocabulary and improve their communication and comprehension skills.&lt;ref&gt;http://expressbuzz.com/Cities/Thiruvananthapuram/spelling-bee-dist-level-winners/43379.html{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike a normal Spelling Bee, the M.I.S.B has been designed as a motivational learning programme with training modules built in. The eleven rounds of the competition goes beyond just spellings and tests almost all the elements of the English Language.

==Competition==
The competition was started in 2003, and now close to a million students participate in the competition annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marrsspellingbee.com/about.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511012142/http://marrsspellingbee.com/about.php |archivedate=11 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First International Championship===
The First International Championship was conducted in [[Mumbai]] on 17 April 2007. Arjun B. Nair from Infant Jesus School, [[Kerala]], was the first overall champion.

===Second International Championship===
The Second International Championship was conducted on 8 November 2009 at two venues, [[Delhi]] and [[Dubai]]. Twenty students from the Dubai Center and sixty students from the Indian Center qualified for the final round. Shivani Nirgudkar of Thakur Public School, Mumbai was adjudged the best performer of the competition.

===Third International Championship===
The Third International Championship was held at Nexus International School, Malaysia. Aditi D. Joshi of Manovikas School, Goa (India), was the best performer of the year.

===The Fourth International Championship===
The Fourth International Championship was held at Al Nahda Girls' School, Al Mushrif, [[Abu Dhabi]]. Juzer Malbari of Christ Church School, Mumbai was the best performer.

==Rounds and levels==
The competition begins from the school level and moves on to the First National Assessment(F.N.A), State, National and finally to the International Level. The students are divided into six categories based on their grades at school. They face written and oral rounds. The written rounds are rounds such as [[Dictation (exercise)|Dictation]], Jumbled Letters, Word Application, [[Crossword]], [[Idioms]], and [[Phrasal Verbs]].  The oral rounds involve Spell It (students spell the words until they make a mistake), [[pronunciation]], and finally [[Antonyms]] and [[Synonyms]] round. In 2012, two new rounds were added from the State Oral and National Written rounds onwards. The Word Origin round (oral) deals with [[etymology]], while the Supra segmentals round (written) is divided into two — one with the marking of stress and [[syllable]]s and the other with the identification of the underlined letter's pronunciation (in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]).

==Projects and Partnerships==

=== Carnegie Corporation of New York Funding Support ===
The libraries of Makerere University received a $650K grant in 2001 for the duration of four years. The project goal was to “make significant contribution to equitable improvement of the academic standards of Makerere University, with a priority to science-based and gender disciplines”.&lt;ref name="Projects &amp; Partners"&gt;{{cite web|title=Projects &amp; Partners|url=http://mulib.mak.ac.ug/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=38&amp;Itemid=56|publisher=Makerere University|accessdate=18 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213223427/http://mulib.mak.ac.ug/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=38&amp;Itemid=56|archivedate=13 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specific objectives included the creation of an interlibrary loan program with library partners and other academic libraries, to increase the collection in specific areas, minimize book theft and loss and hire and retrain staff.
The implementation of an Electronic Document Delivery Service, Science Citation Index and book safety system resulted from the grant. Approximately 5,000 books relating to the fields of science and gender were added to the collection. Funding also purchased computers and established an information literacy program for students, faculty and staff. The project is ongoing and received an additional $400K grant in 2004 to develop an automation process beginning with the main library.&lt;ref name="Projects &amp; Partners" /&gt;

===Swedish International Development Cooperation===
The Department for Research Cooperation (SAREC) at the [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency]] provided the library with almost $1 million to build ICT structure, create a PHD program for library staff, increase training and purchase subscriptions to electronic journals and licenses.&lt;ref name="Projects &amp; Partners" /&gt;  This also created a partnership with a variety of university libraries in Sweden to share practices, training and education.

In 4th-9th grade, students compete within their own grade.  In 10th, 11th, and 12th grades, students compete within all of the grades mentioned.  The West Virginia Council of Teachers of Mathematics are avid supporters of Math Field Day, and created it to spur students' curiosity in mathematics.

There are 8 regions created from the 55 counties of the state.  The counties of each region are 

*Region I- Raleigh, Wyoming, Mcdowell, Mercer, Summers, Monroe
*Region II- Cabell, Lincoln, Logan, Mason, Mingo, Wayne
*Region III- Boone, Clay, Kanawha, Putnam
*Region IV- Pocahontas, Webster, Fayette, Braxton, Nicholas, Greenbrier
*Region V- Wood, Pleasants, Calhoun, Jackson, Ritchie, Roane, Tyler, Wirt
*Region VI- Hancock, Brooke, Ohio, Marshall, Wetzel
*Region VII- Barbour, Doddridge, Gilmer, Harrison, Lewis, Marion, Monongalia, Preston, Randolph, Taylor, Tucker, Upshur
*Region VIII- Berkeley, Grant, Hampshire, Hardy, Jefferson, Mineral, Morgan, Pendleton

==Levels of competition==
The levels of competition in Math Field Day are outlined below. In the event of a county containing all of the students in a particular grade level in one school, the first stage of the competition is that of the county level.

'''School'''-Math Field Day begins at the school level. In 4th, 5th, 6th 7th, 8th, and 9th grades, each school is allowed to send a "team" of four students from each grade to the county competition.  In 10th, 11th, and 12th grades, the top ten students proceed to county.

'''County'''-From the county competition, the top four students from each grade 4th-9th are eligible to attend their region's Math Field Day.  In 10th, 11th and 12th grades, the top ten students proceed to their region's Math Field Day.

'''Region'''-As in the county level, the top three students from each grade 4-9 will proceed to the state competition.  Also, the top ten students from grades 10-12 will proceed to the state Math Field Day.

'''State'''-Twenty-four students from each grade 4-9 compete at the state competition, and eighty students from grades 10-12.  The top five placing students from each grade 4-9 will receive an award, and here the competition ends for them.  In grades 10-12, though, it continues.  The top fifteen students will make up West Virginia's [[American Regions Mathematics League]](ARML) team.  The next top 15 scoring individuals will be the alternates for the team.

'''Nationals (for 10th-12th only)'''-The ARML test is administered at three locations.  West Virginia takes the test at [[Pennsylvania State University]].  Here, students compete in both individual and team rounds, though there are significantly more team-oriented rounds than individual ones.  Last year, West Virginia competed in Division B, and placed 66th of the 79 teams who competed in this competition.

Math Field Day also occurs in PUSD of Pasadena California.

==Competition structure for 4th–9th==
'''School:'''math of eleventh


''Written Test'' – This first section of the test counts for the majority of a competitor's points.  Each student is given 45 minutes to complete 40 multiple-choice questions without a calculator.  Each question is worth 10 points, so the maximum a student can get is 400 points.  Usually, students get at near perfect scores on these tests.

''Mental Math Computation'' – The second section of the test is mental math. It comprises two sections: mental math estimation and mental math exact. For the mental math estimation portion, students are shown a problem on a projector screen or flashcards. They are then given 20 seconds to answer the question. Students are not allowed any scrap paper and are also not allowed any mark-outs on the answer sheet to prevent cheating.  Student guesses within 10% of the actual answer are recorded correct.  There are 10 questions on this section, each worth 10 points.  
The second part of the mental math portion is mental math exact. Students are read a question two times and must answer the question in 20 seconds. Again, no mark-outs are allowed on the answer sheet and no scrap paper is allowed. Like the mental estimation portion, there are 10 questions, each worth 4 points. The mental math section usually can be counted on to break up ties.

'''County:'''

The format of the county competition is almost exactly a duplicate of the school competition, except that in addition to these the Written Test and Mental Math Computation, students in grades 4–9 take part in a Quantity Estimation component as well.

''Quantity Estimation'' – This additional section does not add to the total score of a competitor.  Students are allowed to see and hold a bag of candy for around 20 seconds, and must guess the weight in grams of the bag.  Previously, students had to guess how many pieces of candy were in the bag, but since scores were so close on this section, it was changed to grams.  This section is used to break a tie if scores in both the Written Test and Mental Math Computation are equal.

'''Region:'''

At the regional level,in grades 4–8, students take part in a Physical Estimation section, and students in 9th grade are administered a Short Answer section.  Also, the Written Test now has 50 questions, with students being allotted one hour to complete the test.

''Physical Estimation'' – This section is said{{By whom|date=July 2016}} to be the hardest portion of all the tests administered. Students in grades 4–8 are allowed to look and touch an object for around 20 seconds. They then have to guess one physical property of the object, such as length, width, circumference, or area. Students are not allowed a calculator during this portion.

''Short Answer'' – This section is identical to the Target Round in [[MathCounts]].  Students in grade 9 are administered four rounds of two questions, and are allotted 5 minutes to complete each round of questions.  The difficulty level of the questions varies from an easy question that might have been on the Written Test to questions that take the vast majority of the time to solve.

'''State:'''

Again, the Written Test and Mental Math Computation portions are administered, as are Physical Estimation and Short Answer.   In addition to the portions mentioned, a Math Relay section is added.

''Math Relay'' – The top three students representing each region work together as a team, though this portion is not scored.  First, a student will solve a problem and then hand the answer to the next student.  Using this answer, the second student will plug it in the question to solve it, and pass his or her answer on to the last student.  This competition is to lower the tension at the state competition and to promote amiability between students.

==Competition structure for 10th-12th==

Competition for grades 10-12 consists of any combination of the following:

*short answer questions
*written exam (partial credit awarded)
*team questions
*team power questions
*relays

The top 10 students from the county level proceed to regions.  The top 10 students from the region represent the region at the State Math Field Day.  The top 15 students at the state competition represent West Virginia at the American Regions Math League.

==Differing county formats==

The following counties have formats that differ from those aforementioned at their own Math Field Day.

'''Braxton County'''- 4th through 8th consist of the written test as well as the estimation/mental math. A mathematical game referred to as "combo" is played for fun but not added to the score of the contestants (Please contribute to the official rules of combo or the citation thereof). A separate reward is given to the highest scorer in a grade for combo. 9th consists of two written parts. One being the complete written test, the other being a portion given two questions at a time with a total of 8 questions.

{{Humanism}}
'''Neohumanism''' is a [[Holism|holistic]] [[philosophical theory]] proposed by [[Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar]] to promote [[individual]] and [[collective]] progress. In this philosophy [[universalism]] plays a central role. It claims to elevate humanism to level of universalism.&lt;ref name=dis1&gt;''When the underlying spirit of humanism is extended to everything, animate and inanimate, in this universe – I have designated this as "neohumanism". This neohumanism will elevate humanism to universalism, the cult of love for all created beings of this universe.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Devotional Sentiment and Neohumanism (Discourse 1)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It claims not to have any grouping intention.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==History==
Sarkar detailed Neohumanism in his 1982 book ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''.{{r|dis1}}

In 1987, Sarkar published ''Neohumanism in a Nutshell'' (parts 1 and 2). They contain more discourses on Neohumanism, from various times that he discussed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ampublications.org/product-detail.php?proid=33&amp;mode=addtocart|title=Neo- Humanism in a Nutshell - 1|publisher=Ananda Marga|accessdate=15 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304093145/http://ampublications.org/product-detail.php?proid=33&amp;mode=addtocart|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ampublications.org/product-detail.php?proid=34|title=Neo- Humanism in a Nutshell - 2|publisher=Ananda Marga|accessdate=15 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304101630/http://ampublications.org/product-detail.php?proid=34|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Neohumanism has three stages of development.&lt;ref name="Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan 1982"&gt;Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Neohumanism Is the Ultimate Shelter (Discourse 11)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first stage of Neohumanism is spiritual practice to enhance the physical, mental, and spiritual well-being of the practitioner. The stage of spiritual practice indirectly benefits society through the social service that is part of spiritual practice.
* The second stage of Neohumanism is spiritual principle (or essence). Its impact is mainly in the mental and spiritual realms, both individual and collective. According to Neohumanism, practice of [[#Rationality|rationality]] and adherence to the [[#Social equality|principle of social equality]] (especially when combined with [[#Protopsychospirituality|protospiritualistic mentality]]) will not only strengthen individual minds but also the collective human mind to the point that humanity as a whole can withstand the destructive impact of [[#Geosentiment|geosentiment]] and [[#Sociosentiment|sociosentiment]] and the ruthless exploiters who capitalize on those sentiments.
* {{anchor|stage3}}The third and final stage of Neohumanism is spiritual mission. According to Neohumanism, when an individual's existential nucleus (soul) merges with the "Cosmic Existential Nucleus", she/he attains the consummation of her/his existence. Neohumanism asserts that this supreme status ensures the future of not only the human world but also of the animal and plant worlds as well.

== Concepts ==
List of Neohumanism's key concepts in alphabetical order.

=== Devotion ===
According to neohumanism, love for the Supreme (devotion) is the highest and most valuable treasure of humanity. It automatically results in [[#Universalism|universalism]]. However, neohumanism deems devotion to be a very tender inner asset, frequently assailed by materialism and other onslaughts from the external world. To preserve this treasure, Sarkar submits neohumanism as a practical philosophy that provides a protective fence for devotion by (1) establishing harmony between the spiritual and material worlds (2) providing perennial inspiration for the onward march of society.{{r|dis1}}

=== Dogma ===
Neohumanism defines [[dogma]] as a mental prison. In other words, a dogma is any concept (belief) that one is expected to accept without question. Neohumanism perceives such conduct as fundamentally contrary to [[#Humanity|human nature]], which includes a constant quest for mental expansion. Hence, the position of neohumanism on dogma is that all dogma must be eradicated.&lt;ref name=dis2&gt;''The snares of dogma will have to be shattered to pieces; the iron prison gates of dogma will have to be crushed to dust.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Bondages and Solutions (Discourse 2)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exploitation ===
Neohumanism discourages both [[#Geosentiment|geosentiment]] and [[#Sociosentiment|sociosentiment]], because both tend to be injurious to society. However, neohumanism observes that, of the two, sociosentiment is more pernicious. Under the influence of sociosentiment, one group of people are driven to exploit a second group of people, that second group of people are driven to exploit a third group of people, and so on.&lt;ref name=dis7&gt;''Now, in sociosentiment, it happens that a certain group exploits another, and that exploited group in turn exploits a third.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Exploitation and Pseudoculture (Discourse 7)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Neohumanism, there are many types of exploitation, but exploitation always tends to come down to the economic plane. Economic exploitation manifests itself in two forms:
* '''Politico-economic exploitation''' occurs when an [[Imperialism|imperialist]] nation or group engages in economic exploitation through the use of brute force to impose direct political control over another nation or group. For example, under the [[British Empire]], the United Kingdom variously ruled the nations it conquered through three political mechanisms: [[wikt:direct rule|direct rule]], [[viceroy]]s, and [[Governor-General|governor-generals]].
* {{anchor|psycho-economic_exploitation}}'''Psycho-economic exploitation''' occurs when direct political control is not or is no longer feasible (often due to [[military logistics]]). At such times, the imperialist nation or group engages in economic exploitation by injecting fear and inferiority complexes in the minds of the people that they would [[Colonialism|colonize]].

A common name for psycho-economic exploitation is [[neocolonialism]]. However, Neohumanism observes that there is nothing new about psycho-economic exploitation. Wherever politico-economic exploitation takes place, it is invariably accompanied by psychic exploitation, the goal of which being to make the colonized people more docile. In other words, according to Neohumanism, in both politico-economic exploitation and psycho-economic exploitation, psychic exploitation is the foundation.{{r|dis7}} Neohumanism asserts that when politico-economic exploitation is combined with psycho-economic exploitation, the likely social devastation is much greater.{{r|dis7}}

==== Exploiters ====
In nature, there is a [[mainstream]], and there is also positive and negative deviation from the mainstream. This is true for all species of living beings. Neohumanism classifies this deviation for plants, animals, and humans. When a living being substantially deviates from the mainstream in a constructive fashion, neohumanism describes that being as ''remarkable'', ''good'', or ''blissful'' (depending on whether the structure of that being is of a plant, animal, or human respectively). Conversely, when a living being substantially deviates from the mainstream in a destructive fashion, neohumanism describes that being as ''notorious'', ''bad'', or ''demonic'' (depending on whether the structure of that being is of a plant, animal, or human respectively).{{r|dis10}} In respect to exploitation, our main concern is with human structures, specifically those human structures with [[genius]] that is exercised for destructive purpose, ''demons in human form/framework'' (DHFs).

DHFs are geniuses, and so they are exceptionally devious. They know how to pander to and play on the [[#Geosentiment|geosentiments]] and [[#Sociosentiment|sociosentiments]] of the common people, who rarely think deeply. But truth does not remain hidden forever. So whenever a particular abuse of geosentiment or sociosentiment is about to get exposed or that particular geosentiment or sociosentiment is likely to lose popularity, DHFs switch to a different sentiment. Neohumanism designates the adaptive art of conveniently switching sentiments as ''metamorphosed sentimental strategy''.{{r|dis10}}

According to neohumanism, DHFs wreak great havoc upon this world.{{r|dis10}} Because of their adeptness at metamorphosed sentimental strategy, Sarkar also sometimes refers to DHFs as ''human chameleons''. Like chameleons, DHFs are often very difficult to spot. Nevertheless, Sarkar insists that it is the duty of all neohumanists to identify the DHFs. Not only must neohumanists identify the DHFs, but they must also expose them.{{r|dis10}}

=== Humanism (general) ===
According to neohumanism, the radius of geosentiment and sociosentiment may be relatively short or long. In other words, they both have a minimal and maximal expression (geosentiment or sociosentiment ''minimitis'' and ''maximitis''). With respect to sociosentiment, its minimal expression (''sociosentiment minimitis'') is the attraction felt toward one's nuclear family. That minimal sociosentiment may be extended to embrace a larger community, for example, a city, a state, a nation, an ethnicity, a religious group, and so on. When sociosentiment extends beyond [[nationalism]] and [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]], theoretically embracing all human beings, that is ''sociosentiment maximitis''. According to Sarkar, general (or ordinary) humanism is essentially '''sociosentiment maximitis'''.&lt;ref name="Now 1982"&gt;''Now, this sociosentiment, in its stage of excellencio or in theory maximitis, is called "humanism." Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Pseudohumanism (Discourse 8)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pseudohumanism ====
Neohumanism is of the view that general or ordinary humanism is a distorted humanism that has done and is still doing harm in the world. According to neohumanism, in so far as humanism expanded sociosentiment, it was a positive trend; but in so far as it sets limits on the expansion of the underlying spirit of humanism, [[love]], it has been and continues to be counterproductive.

According to neohumanism, there is a tendency for general humanists to substitute [[pity]] for love. Sarkar said this type of '''pseudohumanism''' inevitably fosters '''intra-human conflict'''.

=== Humanity ===
Neohumanism rejects the classic definition of human being as "[[rational animal]]", which first appeared in [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' insisting that human beings have characteristics distinct from [[animal]]s. It considers human [[life]] to be an [[Ideology|ideological]] flow,{{subst:technical language}} characterized by identification with and commitment to an ideology.&lt;ref name=glory&gt;Shrii Shrii Anandamurti, "The Glory of Human Dharma", 21 February 1979, Bhopal. Published in ''Ananda Vacanamrtam Part 8'', Ananda Marga Publications, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inspiration (motivation) ===
According to neohumanism, the impetus (inspiration or motivation) for human movement - human dynamism - may be either of two conflicting [[principle]]s: the principle of selfish pleasure (''átma-sukha tattva'') or the principle of social equality (''sama-samája tattva'').

==== Selfish pleasure ====
According to neohumanism, selfishness is a socially divisive mental ailment. Those who promote or accept the [[#Dogma|dogmas]] founded on the principle of selfish pleasure typically do so in order to secure their own vested interests.&lt;ref&gt;''All the social, economic and geographical forces that normally motivate human beings are guided by dogma; and this dogma in its turn is entirely based on átma-sukha tattva [the principle of selfish pleasure]. Human beings yield to this dogma with the sole intention of attaining selfish pleasures; even educated people knowingly submit to dogma.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Sama-Samája Tattva (Discourse 6)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Social equality ====
The concept of [[egalitarianism]] has been in circulation for thousands of years. Over time, the concept has become broader and more sophisticated. Recently, various studies have been conducted with results that endorse the tremendous importance of having a more equitable society (see, for example, ''[[The Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better]]'' by [[Richard G. Wilkinson]] and [[Kate Pickett]]). Neohumanism promotes egalitarianism by asserting the principle of social equality and rejecting all [[#Dogma|dogma]] and [[superstition]].&lt;ref&gt;''The endeavor to advance towards the ultimate reality by forming a society free from all inequalities, with everyone of the human race moving in unison, is called sama-samája tattva [the principle of social equality]... We must totally reject all those hypocritical ideas which are contrary to this sama-samája tattva, and we must welcome all those ideas which will help human beings to be established in it. All opposing theories must be removed mercilessly, just like thorns from our path. And in this process we must not give indulgence to any dogmas or supernatural ideas. This should be the task of today’s human beings; all people should combine their efforts and strive unitedly to accomplish that end.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Sama-Samája Tattva (Discourse 6)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to neohumanism, realization of the principle of social equality is a natural consequence of spiritual practice (especially meditation founded on yogic [[morality]], '''Yama-Niyama'''&lt;ref&gt;Shrii Shrii Anandamurti, ''A Guide to Human Conduct''. Fourth Paperback Edition, 2004, Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|9788172521035}}.&lt;/ref&gt;). However, realization of this principle is not the final stage of neohumanism, because application of a principle is somewhat mechanical. In the final stage of neohumanism, the human being's life is transformed into a blissful mission of love (see the [[#stage3|third stage of neohumanism]]).

=== Internationalism ===
Many general humanists support the concept of [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]]. Neohumanism observes that internationalism does not even rise to the standard of [[#Humanism (general)|ordinary humanism]]. Indeed, it poses the same sort of risk to global peace as nationalism. Sarkar explains the problem as follows:

{{Quote|''Suppose I was working for a particular nation, but now I am working for all nations. When I admit the existence of nations and say that I am working for all nations, then it is neither humanism nor universalism – it is merely internationalism. When I use the term "internationalism", I am admitting the existence of separate nations, and along with this I must naturally also think, within the nations, of the people's five fundamental requirements of life (food, clothes, education, shelter, and medical care). But when I discover that one nation is trying to thrive on the life-blood of another, I oppose it, and this opposition ultimately leads to world war. So internationalism is not the solution either.''&lt;ref name="Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan 1982"/&gt;}}

From the perspective of neohumanism, the [[League of Nations]] could not prevent [[World War II]], and the [[United Nations]] cannot prevent a World War III. Only a [[world government]] could ensure peace on this planet.

=== Mental illness ===
According to neohumanism, the major cause of mental disorder is a lack of harmony between the rhythm and speed of the inner world and the outer world. In modern times, humanity has made great progress in the intellectual sphere. But, for most people, the speed of that intellectual progress is not well reflected in the external world (for example, a rising standard of living). Similarly, the patterns of thought for most persons (their internal psychic rhythm) is quite different from the external rhythm of the objective world. These disparities naturally cause clash, and that clash is felt even more in the psychic realm than the physical realm. Neohumanism asserts that this is the reason why many human beings lose their mental balance.{{r|dis1}}

=== Mental modes ===
According to neohumanism, in addition to various activities like [[Thought|thinking]] and [[Recall (memory)|remembering]], mind has three modes of functioning: ''[[instinct]]'', ''sentiment'', and ''[[rationality]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Geo-Sentiment (Discourse 3)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Anopheles stephensi.jpeg|thumb|200px|Mosquitoes suck blood instinctively.]]
* '''Instinct''': The position of neohumanism on ''[[instinct]]'' is somewhat [[Convention (norm)|conventional]]. All living beings, developed and undeveloped, have innate instincts. Many if not most such instincts incite behavior that increases the likelihood of [[self-preservation]] of an organism or a species. So, for example, mosquitoes suck blood, and human babies drink their mother's milk. Neohumanism takes note of the fact that life feeds on life,&lt;ref&gt;''It is true that living creatures are the food for other living beings (jiivah jiivasya bhojanam); and indeed, the vegetables that we eat every day also have living cells in them.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Devotional Sentiment and Neohumanism (Discourse 1)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but insists that human beings must employ [[rationality]] in the selection of food.&lt;ref&gt;''Once I read in a certain book that a great saint used to live only on locusts dipped in honey. That saint did not seriously consider that those little locusts also had vital life force throbbing in them... This concern for the vital rhythm throbbing in other human creatures has driven people to the fold of humanism, has made them humanists. Now, if the same human sentiment is extended to include all creatures of this universe, then and only then can human existence be said to have attained its final consummation.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Devotional Sentiment and Neohumanism (Discourse 1)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In short, neohumanism recognizes the fact that human beings are motivated to some extent by instinct, but neohumanism expects human beings to rely more on rationality so that any needlessly destructive impact of instinct (and sentiment) is curtailed.
* {{anchor|sentiment}}'''Sentiment''': Regarding ''sentiment'', neohumanism broadens the perspective. According to neohumanism, undeveloped minds operate only on instinct; whereas, in more developed minds (including human minds), sentiment also functions and tends to exceed instinct. Goaded by sentiment, mind runs blindly after what it likes (or away from what it does not like). A sentimental being does not ask questions about propriety or even employ common sense. Accordingly, sentiment poses the risk that an irrational course of action may be adopted - a course of action that could destroy not just the sentimental individual but also an entire family or social group.
* '''Discrimination''': Discrimination occurs when a conscious decision is taken regarding the appropriate course of action. A tiger stalks its prey and attacks from a selected vantage point. This is discrimination. A robber enters a house and calculates which room to plunder first, based on most likely gain. This is discrimination. A reasoned decision regarding pros and cons is taken. When discrimination goes one step further, considering a choice between right and wrong (proper and improper), then conscience ([[viveka]]) is invoked. At that point, discrimination rises to the level of [[#Rationality|rationality]]. Compared to instinct and sentiment, discrimination is a slow process. It takes more time to exercise discrimination.

=== Protopsychospirituality ===
Protopsychospirituality (also known as ''protospiritualistic mentality'') is a type of thinking whereby one remembers that everything and everyone with whom one comes in contact is a manifestation of Supreme Consciousness (''Parama Brahma''). Before and after doing any action, if one remembers that all existential phenomena emanate from and return to the Supreme (Cosmic) Existential Nucleus, a benevolent mode of thinking naturally arises within the mind. In that state of mind, one cannot contemplate doing harm to others. Neohumanism asserts that a protospiritualistic mentality is essential for identifying some exceptionally devious [[#Exploiters|exploiters]]. Identification becomes possible when the person with a protospiritualistic mentality notes that her/his benevolent mode of thinking is not reflected in the actions of the exploiter.{{r|dis10}}

=== Pseudoculture ===
[[Culture]] generally refers to the refinements in human expressions. Everyone eats. However, to eat only after washing one's hands is commonly deemed to be part of the ''culture'' of eating. According to neohumanism, human culture is one, but there are variations in its expression. For example, humans, being social creatures, typically like to communicate; but, depending on locality, different languages are used. Neohumanism observes that whenever one group of people has sought to economically exploit another group of people, the former group simultaneously attempted to destroy the local cultural expressions of the latter group. This has been done through the imposition of ''pseudoculture''. Examples of the imposition of pseudoculture are the forced acceptance of an imperialist ruler's language, religious dogma, style of dress, style of eating, political forms, historical perspectives, and artistic expressions.

Pseudoculture is imposed by various means from brute force to the mass media to public education. Often, the standard of refinement in pseudoculture is less than that which it replaces. But regardless of the standard of refinement, the end result is that the cultural backbone of the colonized society is broken. Psychologically crippled, the colonized people lose the will and the power to protest against exploitation. Instead, they tend to deem it just and proper to hand over much of their national wealth to the exploiters.&lt;ref&gt;''This exploitation in the cultural sphere is accomplished by the propagation of pseudoculture. Every honest, virtuous, rational person must fight against this pseudoculture, and inspire others to do the same. If this is not done, the future of humanity will be sealed. It is proper for human beings to struggle for political freedom, for social emancipation; but if their cultural backbone is broken, then all their struggles will end in nothing – like offering ghee into a fire that has died out.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Exploitation and Pseudoculture (Discourse 7)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rationality ===
Philosophers have defined [[rationality]] in various ways. Some of those definitions could equally apply to animals or even plants. Neohumanism offers a new and precise definition of rationality that calls for a standard of mentality that is not discernible in any species other than human beings. According to neohumanism, rationality (also known as ''rationalistic mentality'') is a three-stage process of discrimination that begins with adequate study to assimilate all relevant facts, proceeds to analyze the pros and cons of an action, and ends with a decision in favor of only a ''blissful auxiliary'' (practical action that furthers the welfare of all).&lt;ref&gt;''In the first stage you study; in the second you analyze the positive and negative sides; and in the third stage you arrive at "blissful or non-blissful, auxiliary or non-auxiliary". When you complete this whole process of logical reasoning, the outcome is your "awakened conscience". This state of awakened conscience is what is called "rationalistic mentality".'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Awakened Conscience (Discourse 9)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=''So in the sphere of religion also, if you look carefully, you will see that behind those who have been knowingly or unknowingly operating the machinery of exploitation, there are certain wealthy parties. Those parties want to create their satellites. In every sphere of life you will find such wealthy people in the background.''&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Exploitation and Pseudoculture (Discourse 7)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|source=Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar}}
Throughout history, [[religion]] has had a domineering influence on the human mind. According to neohumanism, all religions are based on [[#Dogma|dogma]], and the propagation of that religious dogma has been instrumental in the creation of satellite groups. Some religious persons and priests propagate the damaging dogma of religion unwittingly. When such persons are made to understand their mistake, some admit their error and rectify themselves. Others, however, refuse to do so, fearing that the admission of error would injure their prestige. The latter group of persons thereby join the ranks of conscious agents of injustice.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[File:Geosentiment.jpg|thumb|Degrees of geosentiment (simplified expansions)]]

=== Sentiments ===
According to neohumanism, two types of sentiment are common to human beings (in both an individual and collective sense): [[#Geosentiment|geosentiment]] and [[#Sociosentiment|sociosentiment]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Bondages and Solutions (Discourse 2)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Both sentiments have a minimal and a maximal expression (geosentiment or sociosentiment ''minimitis'' and ''maximitis''). As with any [[#sentiment|sentiment]], both geosentiment and sociosentiment may have good uses, but there is also great risk of harm (harm to others and harm to oneself). Neohumanism observes that those who would exploit other human beings for their own selfish gain ([[#Exploiters|exploiters]]) typically employ these two types of sentiment, often shifting or transforming sentiments whenever convenient.

==== Geosentiment ====
Geosentiment is the attraction felt toward one's own home, city, or country. Its minimal expression (''geosentiment minimitis'') is love for one's home (house, homestead, or the like). The maximal expression of geosentiment (''geosentiment maximitis'') is love for one's country. In theory, one might feel love for the entire planet, but today such an expression of geosentiment would be very rare, possibly non-existent. In the future, when interplanetary travel becomes commonplace, geosentiment maximitis may expand.

Geosentiment presents in many forms: [[geopolitics]], [[geoeconomics]], geopatriotism, georeligion, and so on. For example, georeligion would associate a religion or a religious group with a specific territory. So, the belief that God has granted a particular territory to a particular group of people is an example of georeligion. Similarly, the belief that prayer must be carried out facing in a specific direction is another expression of georeligion. Such type of beliefs (geosentiments) may prove harmless or harmful, depending on circumstances. According to neohumanism, the potential for harm in geosentiment can be curbed through the cultivation of a [[#Rationality|rationalistic mentality]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Geosentiment (Discourse 3)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sociosentiment.jpg|thumb|Degrees of sociosentiment (simplified expansions)]]

==== Sociosentiment ====
Sociosentiment is the attraction felt toward one's own family, nation, or other social grouping (linguistic, religious, political, and so on). Its minimal expression (''sociosentiment minimitis'') is the attraction felt toward one's nuclear family. That minimal sociosentiment may be extended to embrace a larger community, for example, a city, a state, a nation, an ethnicity, a religious group, and so on. When sociosentiment extends beyond [[nationalism]] and [[#Internationalism|internationalism]], theoretically embracing all human beings, that is ''sociosentiment maximitis''. According to Sarkar, [[#Humanism (general)|general (or ordinary) humanism]] is essentially sociosentiment maximitis.&lt;ref name="Now 1982"/&gt;

Sociosentiment presents itself in many forms: [[Political sociology|sociopolitics]], [[socioeconomics]], [[Patriotism|sociopatriotism]], [[Sociology of religion|socioreligion]], and so on. For example, sociopatriotism might express itself as [[jingoism]] with declarations like "my country, right or wrong" or "my country over all others". Socioeconomics might express itself in the form of an imperialist attempt to create [[Colony|colonies]] or [[satellite states]].

Compared to [[#Geosentiment|geosentiment]], sociosentiment has the capacity to do - and has done - much greater harm in the world. Sociosentiment can also be more difficult to recognize. As such, [[#Rationality|rationality]] might not be adequate to offset the dangers of sociosentiment. To overcome sociosentiment, neohumanism prescribes an additional tool, [[#Protopsychospirituality|protopsychospirituality]].&lt;ref&gt;''What is the way to counteract this sociosentiment? The only way to eliminate it is to develop protospiritualistic mentality. The basis of this protospiritualistic mentality is sama-samája tattva [the principle of social equality]. When people understand this principle from the core of their hearts, they spontaneously develop protospiritualistic mentality, protospiritualistic psychic structure.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Bondages and Solutions (Discourse 2)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social justice ===
Neohumanism extends the concept of ''society'' to include all living beings. Unlike most other theories, past or present, neohumanism distinguishes between [[human society]] and society (in its broadest or universal sense).

In respect to the universal society, the stance of neohumanism corresponds to the spirit of the third fundamental principle of [[Progressive Utilization Theory|PROUT]]. The physical, mental, and spiritual potential of each and every living being should be developed to the maximum. This means that humans should not only respect and protect the rights of the non-human creatures but also actively promote their welfare and happiness.

Regarding human society, neohumanism asserts that no one should be left to lag behind. In a healthy human society, no one should suffer from [[oppression]]. Every problem - big or small, individual or collective - should be taken as a problem of the entire humanity.&lt;ref&gt;''Spread out the sermons of amity amongst the humanity. Remind one and all that the establishment of human excellence does not lie in hypocrisy but in simplicity and sincerity. Make them all realize that every individual human problem, whether big or small, is the problem of universal humanity. Make them also understand that the origin as well as the finality of the entire humanity is one and the same.'' Shrii Shrii Anandamurti, 1982 January 1. Ánanda Váńii Saḿgraha. Compilation from 1956-1990, Ananda Marga Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; So, for example, neohumanism is claimed to oppose any form of [[social discrimination]] based on race or sex, and support women's rights. Neohumanism makes men responsible for acting in support of those rights.&lt;ref&gt;''In every sphere of life men have either substantially limited the rights of women, or made the ability of women to exercise their rights subject to the whims and caprices of men... The main point of the discussion is this: those who take advantage of people’s simplicity or ignorance are veritable demons in human form, and those who deceive people by exploiting their sentiments of sacrifice are even worse than demons... If at all a movement is required, it must be implemented by men themselves. Today men should consider the needs of women and gradually restore to women the rights which women once entrusted to men out of feelings of helplessness or in response to their heartfelt sentiments.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1959). ''Human Society Part 1''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-120-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concern of neohumanism for [[social justice]] extends even to relatively minor but intractable matters. So, for example, though it pertains only to grammar, the male bias of the English language should not continue. When the pronoun 'he' can mean 'he' or 'she' and when 'man' can mean 'man' or 'woman', should not the same be the case with 'she' and 'woman'? Either English must have neutral words or the meaning of existing words must change. Though such type of change generally takes a while to implement, neohumanism insists that it be done.

=== Social progress ===
As with [[Progressive Utilization Theory|PROUT]], neohumanism views social progress as a condition in which the welfare and happiness of the entire society is increased. Neohumanism considers the individual and the society to be an inalienable concomitance. Unlike other philosophical theories that would [[Satisficing|satisfice]] or allegedly optimize social well-being through principles like the [[lesser of two evils principle]] or the [[greatest good for the greatest number]], neohumanism measures progress on the basis of improvements in the poorest sectors of society. According to neohumanism, what is genuinely good for the individual is also good for the society; and what is genuinely good for the society is also good for the individual.

Neohumanism distinguishes two ways in which [[social progress]] may be effected: evolution and revolution.

* '''Evolution''' brings gradual and specific change.
* '''Revolution''' brings rapid and comprehensive change.

Of the two systems, neohumanism greatly prefers revolution.&lt;ref&gt;''Now, those who are courageous enough to speak out this truth in clear language – those who say, "Shatter this bondage of limitation!" – their path is called the path of revolution. And those who say, "Everything will be done gradually... why so much haste?" – their path is called the path of evolution. They can never accomplish any glorious task.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Exploitation and Pseudoculture (Discourse 7)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neohumanism distinguishes four types of people who take a stance on the subject of social change: [[Reactionary|reactionaries]], [[Reformism|reformists]], vocal revolutionaries, and [[Revolutionary|revolutionaries]].

* '''Reactionaries''' openly oppose change. Neohumanism respects their honesty but deems such persons to be suffering from a fear complex.&lt;ref&gt;''There are still others who say straightforwardly, "No, no, how can I contradict the way followed by my ancestors – my father, my grandfather?" They are reactionaries. They suffer from a mental disease. They are afraid to accept the new; they suffer from fear complex. They utter high-sounding phrases, but their hearts are filled with fear complexes. Not that they are terribly reprehensible. They say outwardly: "We are just doing the same as our ancestors did." But their ancestors used to wear wooden sandals instead of shoes, and shawls instead of tailored shirts, eat guŕ [raw sugar] instead of refined sugar, and drink water from wells instead of from taps. Do they follow this also?'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Exploitation and Pseudoculture (Discourse 7)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Reformists''' promote some miscellaneous fixes. According to neohumanism, such persons outwardly claim to want change, but their inner desire is to perpetuate the machinery of exploitation. The contradictory nature of [[reformism]] may manifest as a ''pseudoreformist strategy''.&lt;ref&gt;''The reformists say, "Let us go slowly on the path of reform." But actually they intend that the process of exploitation should continue without interruption. There were many reformists in the world, but in reality they did not want the welfare of the society; they only wanted to perpetuate the process of exploitation by bringing about some patchwork improvements.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Exploitation and Pseudoculture (Discourse 7)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Vocal revolutionaries''' (also referred to as ''pseudorevolutionaries'') are similar to reformists but even less forthright. They pretend to want revolutionary change, but their tall talk is belied by their action.&lt;ref&gt;''I have branded these people as "vocal revolutionaries". They deliver long lectures against exploitation, but they do the opposite in practice.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Exploitation and Pseudoculture (Discourse 7)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{anchor|revolutionary}}'''Revolutionaries''' are forthright about their vision of a new society and unrelenting in their effort to materialize that vision.

According to neohumanism, revolutionaries are the true well-wishers of society. As such, neohumanism asserts that only the revolutionaries can effect significant social progress.

=== Universalism ===
Neohumanism's concept of [[Universalism#Non-religious Universalism|universalism]] is non-religious. It is a type of love that extends to all beings of this universe, animate and even inanimate. From the perspective of Neohumanism, such a viewpoint is the ultimate outcome of the principle of 'social equality and 'protopsychospirituality'.&lt;ref name=dis10&gt;''Whenever people, after performing some activity, think of the Nucleus of the circum-rotarian universe, their minds become all-pervasive. Such people can never think of harming others; rather they will think only of universal welfare.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "An Ideology for a New Generation (Discourse 10)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Value systems ===
According to neohumanism, the human-centered [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] approach of general humanism is problematic in that it allows the possibility of cruelty to animals and plants. Such type of cruelty inevitably fosters inter-creature clash. Neohumanism extends this analysis by observing that cruelty has a tendency to become habitual. In other words, what a human does today to an animal, that same human may do tomorrow to another human being. Hence, according to neohumanism, general humanism may also foster intra-human clash. To offset the anthropic bias of general humanism and to reduce the potential for conflict, neohumanism posits two types of value: [[#Utility value|utility value]] and [[#Existential value|existential value]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Pseudohumanism (Discourse 8)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Existential value and utility value ====
According to neohumanism, until now, people have tended to think primarily in terms of [[#Utility value|utility value]], typically the [[utility]] that another entity has for oneself or one's nation. So, for example, when horses were a primary means of transportation, the utility value of horses to human beings was very great. Today, with more efficient and comfortable means of transportation, horses have lost most of their utility value for humans. Accordingly, Sarkar argues that the status of horses in modern society is much reduced. But neohumanism insists that horses also have ''existential value''. The existential value of a horse to itself is no less than the existential value of a human being to itself. In terms of the existential value one holds for one's own existence, all beings are said to be equal. Neohumanism would give greater importance to this existential value than to utility value.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Sarkar said: "Who says that those creatures who have lost their immediate utility value have no right to exist? No one has the moral right to say this.''&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

== Applied Neohumanism ==
* Renaissance Universal (RU) - an organization for [[intellectuals]]. It promotes science, 'rationality, 'social equality, and 'universalism' to solve problems confronting humanity and to expand our mental horizon.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ru.org/ru.html&lt;/ref&gt;
** Renaissance Artists and Writers Association (RAWA) (a department of Renaissance Universal) seeks to inspire, unite, and uplift humanity through the [[fine arts]] and literature. RAWA organized performances and competitions for [[Prabhat Samgiita]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thestatesman.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;show=archive&amp;id=385734&amp;catid=47&amp;year=2011&amp;month=10&amp;day=7&lt;/ref&gt; The slogan of RAWA is "art for service and blessedness". This is in stark contrast to the oft-heard slogan, "[[art for art's sake]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://rawa.asia/mp3/info/rawa-structure.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/08/26/stories/2002082600070400.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ananda Marga schools: A of [[Ananda Marga Pracaraka Samgha]], is education. Ananda Marga schools (from kindergartens to universities) have been establishedd. The education system is also known as ''Neohumanist Education'' under [[Ananda Marga Gurukula]] the board of education for Neohumanist schools in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://gurukul.edu/newsletter/issue33/ananda-marga-school-kulu-india/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ru.org/economics/peace-for-a-troubled-world-neo-humanist-education.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critiques ==
In a recent book,&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, James R. ''Violence and New Religious Movements''. [[Oxford University Press]], 2011. {{ISBN|0199735611}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Helen Crovetto asserts that there is a "dramatic" number of correlations between [[Ananda Marga]] and [[Mark Juergensmeyer|Mark Juergensmeyer's]] "description of [[#Religion|religious]] groups inclined toward [[terrorism]]". Crovetto mentions here the imagery of "cosmic war" that appears in Sarkar's writings, and Crovetto repeatedly references language that seems to "satanize" opponents, for example, the term ''[[#Exploiters|demon in human form]]'' that is part of the terminology of neohumanism. After considerable analysis, Crovetto concludes that it is probably more appropriate to describe the followers of Sarkar as [[#revolutionary|''revolutionary'']] rather than ''terrorist''. As such, Crovetto classifies them as "revolutionary sociospiritual [[Utopia|''utopians'']]".

'''''Of Pandas and People: The Central Question of Biological Origins''''' is a controversial 1989 (2nd edition 1993) school-level [[textbook]] written by [[Percival Davis]] and [[Dean H. Kenyon]] and published by the [[Texas]]-based [[Foundation for Thought and Ethics]] (FTE). The textbook endorses the [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]]&lt;ref&gt;National Science Teachers Association, a professional association of 55,000 science teachers and administrators in a 2005 press release: "We stand with the nation's leading scientific organizations and scientists, including Dr. John Marburger, the president's top science advisor, in stating that intelligent design is not science.…It is simply not fair to present pseudoscience to students in the science classroom."

*"Aquinas was explicit that this intelligent designer 'everyone understands to be God.'", ''[[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District|Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'', p24, citing the testimony of [[John Haught]]
*"anyone familiar with Western religious thought would immediately make the association that the tactically unnamed designer is God", ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District'', p25, citing the testimony of John Haught
*"Moreover, it is notable that both Professors Behe and Minnich admitted their personal view is that the designer is God and Professor Minnich testified that he understands many leading advocates of ID to believe the designer to be God.", ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District'', p25
*"...although, as one of them [design theorists] confessed to some fellow Christians, referring to an intelligent was merely a 'politically correct way to refer to God." ''The Creationists'', 2006, p380&lt;/ref&gt; They present various [[polemics|polemical]] arguments against the [[scientific theory]] of [[evolution]].

A third edition of the book was published in 2007 under the title '''''The Design of Life: Discovering Signs of Intelligence in Biological Systems'''''.

The book argues that the origin of new organisms is "in an immaterial cause: in a blueprint, a plan, a pattern, devised by an intelligent agent". The text remains non-committal on the age of the Earth, commenting that some "take the view that the earth's history can be compressed into a framework of thousands of years, while others adhere to the standard old earth chronology". The book raises a number of objections to the theory of evolution, such as the alleged lack of [[transitional fossil]]s, gaps in the [[fossil record]] and the apparent sudden appearance ''[[ex nihilo]]'' of "already intact fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers, beaks, and wings, etc". The book makes no explicit reference to the identity of the [[intelligent designer]] implied in the "blueprint" metaphor.

[[Kevin Padian]], a biologist at [[University of California, Berkeley]] reviewed the book and called it "a wholesale distortion of modern biology".&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin Padian]], "''Of Pandas and People'' Review" in ''Reviews of Creationist Books'' ed Liz Rank Hughes, [[National Center for Science Education]], 1992. page 37 {{ISBN|978-0-939873-52-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Ruse]], a professor of philosophy and biology, reviewed it, calling the book "worthless and dishonest".&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Ruse]], "''Of Pandas and People'' Review" in ''Reviews of Creationist Books'' ed Liz Rank Hughes, [[National Center for Science Education]], 1992. page 41 {{ISBN|978-0-939873-52-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gerald Skoog, Professor of Education at [[Texas Tech University]], wrote in his 1989 review that the book reflected a creationist strategy to focus their "attack on evolution", interpreting the ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]'' ruling as though it legitimised "teaching a variety of scientific theories", but the book did not contain a scientific theory or model to "balance" against evolution, and was "being used as a vehicle to advance sectarian tenets and not to improve science education".&lt;ref name="Skoog"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ncse.com/creationism/analysis/view-from-past |title= A View From the Past |author= Gerald Skoog |authorlink= Gerald Skoog |year=1989 |work= "''Of Pandas and People'' Review" |publisher= [[National Center for Science Education]] |pages=44 |quote= review originally published in Bookwatch Reviews 2(11) in 1989, and republished in Reviews of Creationist Books, second edition, edited by Liz Rank Hughes (Berkeley: NCSE, 1993, {{ISBN|978-0-939873-52-4}}) |accessdate=2010-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions==
There are currently two editions of the book, the 1989 first edition edited by [[Charles Thaxton]], a chemist who earned his PhD in physical chemistry from Iowa State University, and the 1993 second edition, which included a "Note to Teachers" by Mark D. Hartwig and [[Stephen C. Meyer]]. A third edition was retitled ''The Design of Life''. Jon Buell, the president of the [[Foundation for Thought and Ethics]], said that the ruling in ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' that intelligent design was religious would make the textbook "radioactive" in public schools and would be "catastrophic" for the marketability of both the (then) present (second) edition and the (then) forthcoming third edition, citing possible losses of around US$500,000. The renaming of the book is viewed by some as way of mitigating this and at the same time distancing the book from past controversy.&lt;ref name="buell"/&gt;

For the 1993 edition, [[Michael Behe]] wrote a chapter on [[blood clotting]], presenting arguments which he later presented in very similar terms as "[[irreducible complexity]]" in a chapter in his 1996 book ''[[Darwin's Black Box]]''. Behe later agreed that they were essentially the same when he defended intelligent design at the Dover Trial.&lt;ref name=dot&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/rncse/24/5/design-trial-dover-pennsylvania |title=Design on Trial in Dover, Pennsylvania &amp;#124; NCSE |author=Nicholas J Matzke |authorlink=Nick Matzke |date=September–October 2004 |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]]  |quote=Even Michael Behe's "irreducible complexity" argument (though not the signature phrase) appears in print for the first time in the second edition of ''Pandas'' |accessdate=2009-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Matzke | first = Nick | authorlink = Nick Matzke | title = God of the Gaps…in your own knowledge.

==Origins and publication==

The book is published by the [[Foundation for Thought and Ethics]] (FTE), a non-profit organization founded by ordained minister Jon Buell in [[Richardson, Texas|Richardson]], [[Texas]], in 1980 as a tax-exempt charitable and educational organization, with articles of incorporation which stated that its purpose includes "proclaiming, publishing, preaching [and] teaching…the Christian Gospel and understanding of the Bible and the light it sheds on the academic and social issues of the day". In the original [[Internal Revenue Service]] tax-exemption submission, Buell described the foundation as a "Christian think-tank" and stated that the organization's first activity would be the editing of a book "showing the scientific evidence for creation".&lt;ref name=tom&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/ncser/10/4/foundation-thought-ethics |title=NCSE Resource |accessdate=2007-11-16 |author=John A. Thomas |year=1990 |work=The Foundation for Thought and Ethics |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Co-author Percival Davis later acknowledged that religious concerns underlay the writing of the book; in a November 1994 interview with the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', he commented: "Of course my motives were religious. There's no question about it."&lt;ref&gt;Erik Larson, "Darwinian struggle: instead of evolution, a textbook proposes "intelligent design'." ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', 14 November 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"About his reasons for writing 'Pandas', Davis told The Wall Street Journal in 1994: 'Of course my motives were religious. There's no question about it'."{{cite news | url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/premium/0286/0286-15671237.html | title=By any other name: intelligent design and evolution |publisher=''St. Louis Journalism Review'' | date=Dec 1, 2005 | first= | last= | accessdate = 2008-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Creation Biology''===
In 1981, the FTE advertised in a creationist newspaper, seeking authors for a textbook that would be "sensitively written to present both evolution and creation".&lt;ref name=bfrole&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/rncse/26/1-2/my-role-kitzmiller-v-dover-0 |title=NCSE Resource -- My Role in ''Kitzmiller v Dover'' |accessdate=2007-11-14 |author=Barbara Forrest |authorlink=Barbara Forrest |year=2006 |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first production was ''Unlocking the secrets: The Mystery of Life's Origin'' by creationist [[Charles Thaxton]] (a chemist), Walter L. Bradley, and Roger L. Olsen.&lt;ref name=kos&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2006/3/11/8448/52824 |title=Daily Kos: Know Your Creationists: Know Your Allies |accessdate=2007-11-16 |author=Darksyde |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In this book, Thaxton presented arguments for "Special Creation by a creator beyond the cosmos", and described [[Special creation|Special Creation]] as holding "that the ''source that produced life'' was intelligent".&lt;ref name=Forrestexpreport&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.creationismstrojanhorse.com/FORREST_EXPERT_REPORT.pdf |title=Expert Witness Report |author=Barbara Forrest |authorlink=Barbara Forrest |date=April 1, 2007 |format=pdf |workkitzmiller v. dover area school district, 2005= |publisher=United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania |accessdate=2014-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028220124/http://www.creationismstrojanhorse.com/FORREST_EXPERT_REPORT.pdf |archivedate=October 28, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaxton approached [[Dean H. Kenyon]] to write the foreword. When ''Mystery'' was ready to go to the printers late in 1982, work began on the textbook, written by Kenyon and [[Percival Davis]] with Thaxton as editor.&lt;ref name=witt&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evolutionnews.org/2005/12/post_6.html |title=Evolution News &amp; Views: Dover Judge Regurgitates Mythological History of Intelligent Design |accessdate=2007-11-16 |author=Jonathan Witt |date=December 20, 2005 |publisher=[[Discovery Institute]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A draft dated 1983 was entitled ''Creation Biology Textbook Supplements'', and was stated in the language of creationism,&lt;ref name=bftestimony&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/day6am2.html#day6am889 |title=Kitzmiller v. Dover: Day 6, AM: Barbara Forrest (continued) |accessdate=2007-11-16 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the following statement:
{{quotation|The basic metabolic pathways of nearly all organisms are the same. Is this because of descent from a common ancestor, or because only these pathways (and their variations) can sustain life? Evolutionists think the former is correct; creationists because of all the evidence discussed in this book, conclude the latter is correct.&lt;ref name=mislink&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.ncseweb.org/wp/?p=80 |title=Evolution Education and the Law - Blog Archive - Missing Link discovered! |accessdate=2007-11-14 |author=Nick Matzke |authorlink=Nick Matzke |year=2006 |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071107040048/http://www2.ncseweb.org/wp/?p=80 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}
A 1986 draft with the title ''Biology and Creation'' included a similar statement, and defined "creation" using the classic creationist concept of "abrupt appearance":&lt;ref name=bfrole/&gt;

A 1987 draft entitled ''Biology and Origins'' made only minor grammatical alterations to these statements.&lt;ref name=bftestimony/&gt;&lt;ref name=mislink/&gt; 
The FTE sought a publisher for the book, sending a Boston firm a prospectus which indicated that the draft had been sent to school districts for testing as well as to prospective publishers.&lt;ref name=draftstory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/creationism/legal/pandas-drafts |title=NCSE Resource -- 9.0.

Many more who don't still believe it should be included in science curriculum." Additionally, he enclosed projections showing expected revenue of over $6.5 million in five years based upon "modest expectations for the market." If creationist teaching in schools was explicitly permitted by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in the ''[[Edwards v.

===''Pandas'' and "cdesign proponentsists"===
&lt;!-- PLEASE NOTE: "cdesign proponentsists" is a DIRECT QUOTE from the book. PLEASE DO NOT 'CORRECT' IT! The mistake was in the book itself, not the article --&gt;
&lt;!-- NOTE: please don't change the title as  [[Cdesign proponentsists]] redirects here --&gt;
The ''Louisiana "Balanced Treatment Act"'' case — ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]'' — was decided by the Supreme Court in 1987. The court determined that teaching creationism in public schools violated the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[United States constitution]], but that alternative [[scientific theory|scientific theories]] could be taught. While the decision ruled out any return to teaching traditional [[Young Earth creationism]] in science classes, it did offer an opening for those willing to recast creationist doctrine in the language of science.

In 1987 a further draft of the book was produced with the new title ''Of Pandas and People'', which still had the definition "creation means that various forms of life began abruptly",&lt;ref name=bftestimony/&gt; and used the term "creationists":
{{quotation|The basic metabolic pathways (reaction chains) of nearly all organisms are the same. Is this because of descent from a common ancestor, or because only these pathways (and their variations) can sustain life? Evolutionists think the former is correct, creationists accept the latter view.&lt;ref name=mislink/&gt;&lt;ref name=CdesignProponentsistsNCSE/&gt; }}

The outcome of the case prompted significant editorial changes to the book. [[Dean H. Kenyon]] had presented an affidavit to the court in which he defined "[[creation science]]" as meaning "origin through abrupt appearance in complex form", which did "not include as essential parts... catastrophism, a world-wide flood, a recent inception of the earth or life,... the concept of kinds, or any concepts from Genesis or other religious texts",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwards-v-aguillard/kenyon.html |title=Edwards v. Aguillard: Dean Kenyon's Affidavit |accessdate=2007-11-16 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this attempt to re-define creation science did not succeed in the ''Edwards'' case.  Both authors had previously written [[young Earth creationism|young Earth creationist]] publications referring to biological design: a 1967 book co-written by [[Percival Davis]] referred to "design according to which basic organisms were created", and in a 1984 article as well as in his affidavit to Edwards v. Aguillard, Kenyon defended [[creation science]] by stating that "biomolecular systems require intelligent design and engineering know-how".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Forrest | first = Barbara | title = Expert Witness Report | url = http://ncse.com/files/pub/legal/kitzmiller/expert_reports/2005_04_01_Forrest_expert_report_P.pdf | publisher = National Center for Science Education | date = 1 April 2005 | accessdate = 30 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Discovery Institute]]'s account published in December 2005, [[Charles Thaxton]] as editor of the ''Pandas'' book needed a new term after the Supreme Court case, and found it in a phrase he "picked up from a NASA scientist – intelligent design". He thought: "That's just what I need, it's a good engineering term….. it seemed to jibe... And I went back through my old copies of ''Science'' magazine and found the term used occasionally."&lt;ref name=witt/&gt; In a new draft of ''Pandas'' prepared shortly after the 1987 Supreme Court ruling, approximately 150 uses of the root word "creation", such as "creationism" and "creationist", were systematically changed to refer to ''intelligent design''.&lt;ref name=kitz31&gt;{{cite court  |litigants=Kitzmiller v.

{{quotation|Intelligent design means that various forms of life began abruptly through an intelligent agency, with their distinctive features already intact. Fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers, beaks, wings, etc.&lt;ref name=bftestimony/&gt;}}
The term "creationists" was changed to "design proponents", but in one case the beginning and end of the original word "creationists" were accidentally retained, so that "creationists" became "cdesign proponentsists".&lt;!--this misspelling is NOT a mistake, it's a direct quote--&gt;&lt;ref name=draftstory/&gt;&lt;ref name=CdesignProponentsistsNCSE&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/creationism/legal/cdesign-proponentsists |title="Cdesign Proponentsists" : NCSE |accessdate=2008-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FTE founder Jon Buell says that the word ''creationism'' was a "placeholder term" whose definition "changed to include a religious context after the draft was written, so the writers changed the word."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/09/of_pandas_and_p.html |title=Of Pandas and People: Creation Relabeled - The Panda's Thumb |accessdate=2007-11-16 |author=Wesley R.

===Publication and promotion===
''Of Pandas and People'' was published in 1989 by "Haughton Publishing Co." This was the assumed name of a [[Mesquite, Texas]], printing firm, Horticultural Printers, Inc., which mainly served the agricultural industry and had no other books in print, nor any in-house writers or science advisors.&lt;ref name=tom/&gt; (It should not be confused with the well-known children's and school textbook publisher, [[Houghton Mifflin]]). Printing costs were met by donations to the FTE, whose members were told in a December 1988 fundraising letter that donors would receive an enameled box with a panda on the lid as a gift. The box would "become a pleasant reminder to pray for our work", as Buell put it.&lt;ref name="wsj141194" /&gt;

Following the book's publication in 1989, the FTE embarked on a lengthy campaign to get the book into use in schools across the United States. Previous creationist efforts to dilute or overturn the teaching of evolutionary theory had relied largely on a "top-down" approach of pro-creationist legislators passing laws to regulate science education in schools. However, these had repeatedly failed to survive court challenges. The FTE took a "bottom-up" approach instead, mobilizing local Christian conservative groups to push school boards and individual teachers to adopt the book and also to get themselves elected to school boards and local educational committees.

Buell told supporters:&lt;ref name="wsj141194" /&gt;
{{quote|Biology teachers are generally easy to contact, available for a meeting on short notice, and receptive. If you would like to be a part of this 'quiet army', please let us know right away. Those choosing not to enlist may wish to support those who do by their prayers.}}

The FTE provided publicity materials to its supporters to assist them in promoting the adoption of the book. These included a video of testimonials by pro-ID scientists and a promotional script, including "lines to take" on contentious issues.

For instance, on the controversial issue of ID's perceived overlap with religion, the FTE's suggested response read:&lt;ref name="wsj141194" /&gt;
{{quote|I agree that personal beliefs should not be taught in science classrooms, but intelligent design is not a personal belief; it is accepted science, a view that is held by many highly qualified scientists.}}

The FTE was aided in this effort by "traditional" creationist organizations such as the [[Institute for Creation Research]], which sells ''Of Pandas and People'' through its own online shop and catalogue. The book was explicitly marketed by retailers as a creationist work; in the 2005 ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District'' case, donated copies of the book were accompanied by a catalog which listed ''Pandas'' under "creation science".&lt;ref&gt;"Witness dissects district's words." ''York Daily Record'', 13 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Design of Life''==
[[Discovery Institute]] Senior Fellows [[William A. Dembski]] and [[Jonathan Wells (intelligent design advocate)|Jonathan Wells]] are the listed authors of this edition, presented as a sequel. The preface of ''The Design of Life'' is by Jon A. Buell, president of the [[Foundation for Thought and Ethics]], which is the publisher of ''The Design of Life''.

The book includes 100 pages of footnotes and notes.&lt;ref name=luskin/&gt;

The book tries to address some novel areas. For example, it states that intelligent design does not require miracles or the supernatural, but still does not rely on "[[materialism|materialistic explanations]]". The book states that "Supernatural explanations invoke miracles and therefore are not properly part of science", and that "[e]xplanations that call on intelligent causes require no miracles but cannot be reduced to materialistic explanations."&lt;ref name=luskin/&gt;

Also, the book tries to explain away the loss of intelligent design in the ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover]]'' decision: "In the end, not any court rulings or public policies or Hollywood films, will decide the merit of intelligent design."&lt;ref name=luskin/&gt;

A [[blog]] associated with the book&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedesignoflife.net/blog/ Design of Life blog website]&lt;/ref&gt; began on December 17, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/new-design-of-life-blog-promises-exciting-coverage-of-intelligent-design-issues/ ''New Design of Life blog promises exciting coverage of intelligent design issues''], Denyse O'Leary, Uncommondescent [[blog]], January 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
Dembski wrote in his blog, ''Uncommondescent'', that ''The Design of Life'' had 9 five star reviews, and only a single one star review on [[Amazon.com]] on December 5, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uncommondescent.com/the-design-of-life/amazon-reviews-for-the-design-of-life/ ''Amazon reviews for THE DESIGN OF LIFE''], [[William Dembski]], [[Uncommondescent]], December 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; California State University emeritus professor [[Mark Perakh]] has written that he believes Dembski and his associates at the Discovery Institute are deceitfully manipulating the Amazon.com review system to promote their own work and denigrate the work of their adversaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkreason.org/articles/shenanigans.cfm ''Dembski's and Wells's Shenanigans: Just a Reminder''], [[Mark Perakh]], TalkReason [[website]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Discovery Institute's blog, ''Evolution News and Views'', also gave the book a positive.&lt;ref name=luskin&gt;[http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/11/design_of_life.html ''Design of Life''], Casey Luskin, Evolution News and Views, [[Discovery Institute]], November 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Evolution News and Views says that ''The Design of Life'' describes how evolution cannot account for the necks of giraffes, how the transition from reptiles to mammals took place, how whales evolved from land animals, and how all evolutionary explanations of the bacterial flagellum are fallacious. In addition, the review asserts that this book exposes substantial holes in [[abiogenesis]] and [[common descent]], as well as refuting [[SETI]] objections to intelligent design and discussions of the shortcomings of ocular design.&lt;ref name=luskin/&gt;

Dembski was interviewed about the book by [[Focus on the Family]]'s Citizenlink in December, 2007.&lt;ref name=devon&gt;[http://www.citizenlink.org/content/A000006139.cfm ''Friday Five: William A. Dembski''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217212817/http://www.citizenlink.org/content/A000006139.cfm |date=2007-12-17 }}, Devon Williams, [[Citizenlink]], [[Focus on the Family]], December 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Dembski described the book as accessible, but noted that it also includes a [[Compact disk|CD]] and endnotes that delve deeper into the technical issues. Dembski said the book corrects many of the misrepresentations and biased descriptions of intelligent design that have appeared. Dembski also revealed that he believes that the "intelligent designer" is the [[Christian]] god.&lt;ref name=devon/&gt;

==Analysis==
Many of the book's arguments are identical to those raised by creationists, which have been dismissed by the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/creationism/analysis/critique-pandas-people Critque: Of Pandas and People]&lt;/ref&gt; A comparison of an early draft of ''Of Pandas and People'' to a later 1987 draft showed how in hundreds of instances the word "creationism" had been replaced by "intelligent design" and "creationist" replaced by "intelligent design proponent", while "creator" was replaced by "agency" or "designer".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn8061 Book thrown at proponents of Intelligent Design - opinion - 06 October 2005 - New Scientist&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2007 book ''[[Monkey Girl]]'' Edward Humes describes how this change was made after [[Edwards v. Aguillard]] settled that teaching "Creation Science" in public schools was unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=Humes&gt;Humes, Edward. ''Monkey Girl: Evolution, Education, Religion, and the Battle for America's Soul'', 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-06-088548-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific and education professional groups have strongly criticized ''Of Pandas and People'' and have opposed its use in schools. Science educator Gerald Skoog described it as "a vehicle to advance sectarian tenets and not to improve science education" and said "This book has no potential to improve science education and student understanding of the natural world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/creationism/analysis/gross-misrepresentation NCSE Resource] [[National Center for Science Education]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of ''Of Pandas and People'' by [[paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Kevin Padian]] of the University of California at Berkeley for the [[National Center for Science Education]]'s ''Bookwatch Reviews'' in 1989 called the book a "wholesale distortion of modern biology", and says that FTE's writers had misrepresented such topics as the [[Cambrian explosion]], the [[Bird evolution|history of birds]], and the concept of [[homology (biology)|homology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/creationism/analysis/gross-misrepresentation Gross Misrepresentation] Kevin Padian. Bookwatch Reviews: Candid Appraisals of Science Textbooks Volume 2, Number 11, 1989 [[National Center for Science Education]]&lt;/ref&gt; Padian described the treatment of homology in ''Of Pandas and People'' as "shameful", citing:

{{quote|They pretend that the [[Thylacine|Tasmanian wolf]], a marsupial, would be placed [classified] with the placental wolf if evolutionists were not so hung up on the single character of their [[Marsupial#Reproductive system|reproductive mode by which marsupials and placentals are traditionally separated]]. This is a complete falsehood, as anyone with access to the evidence knows. It is not a matter of a single reproductive character, but dozens of characters in the skull, teeth, post-cranial bones (including the marsupial pelvic bones), soft anatomy, and biochemistry, to say nothing of their respective fossil records, that separate the two mammals. About the closest similarity they have going for them is that they are both called "wolf" in English. The same criticism can be applied seriatim to the authors' mystifying discussion of the red and giant "pandas".}}

Padian's conclusion was: "It is hard to say what is worst in this book: the misconceptions of its sub-text, the intolerance for honest science, or the incompetence with which science is presented. In any case, teachers should be warned against using this book."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/creationism/analysis/gross-misrepresentation Gross Misrepresentation] NCSE Resource&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The FTE's activist approach has produced heated controversies in several US states as Christian conservatives and school boards sought to adopt ''Of Pandas and People'' in public schools, against the opposition of mainstream scientists, educators and civil liberties organizations. This has caused several notable controversies, culminating in the ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' case in [[Pennsylvania]] in which the contents and antecedents of the book came under scrutiny.

In [[Alabama]], 11,800 people signed a petition which was presented to Alabama's school textbook committee, endorsing intelligent design and urging the adoption of ''Of Pandas and People'' as a class textbook.&lt;ref name="wsj141194" /&gt; In January 1990 the book was withdrawn from consideration by its publishers, the Haughton Publishing Co., who said that they "backed off because they weren't given [the] chance to defend [the] book."&lt;ref&gt;"News - Alabama." ''USA Today'', 9 January 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1990, a public campaign was mounted in [[Idaho]] to urge the state school board to adopt ''Of Pandas and People''. However, the book was rejected by the board.

In March 1990, the school board in [[Pinellas County]], [[Florida]], rejected an appeal by a retired minister "to adopt the textbook ''Of Pandas and People'' that would offer a creationist's view".&lt;ref&gt;"School Board rejects book on creationism." ''St. Petersburg Times'', 15 March 1990&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In January 1993, right-wing members of the school board of [[Vista, California]], sought to include ''Of Pandas and People'' in the school science curriculum. A teachers' committee voted unanimously to reject the book saying it lacked scientific merit.&lt;ref&gt;"District debates evolution." ''Las Vegas Review-Journal'', 15 May 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The board eventually backed away from plans to require [[creation science]] to be taught in science classes.&lt;ref&gt;"Justices' Reach Extends to Biology Lessons; Ruling on Teaching Creationism Has Quieted Battle as Schools Drop Subject to Avoid Lawsuits." ''Washington Post'', 2 October 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

===1994–1998===
In September 1994, residents of [[Louisville, Ohio]], voted 121-2 to urge the local school board to adopt ''Of Pandas and People''.&lt;ref name="wsj141194" /&gt; Creationism had been taught openly in district schools until a lawsuit forced a change of policy in 1993. In the wake of the decision, the district was given 150 copies of the book.&lt;ref&gt;"Right stokes new creationist row." ''Independent On Sunday'', London. 30 July 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1994, school officials in [[St. Lucie County, Florida]], distributed copies of the book to every high school and one middle school in the county to be reviewed by teachers and principals for use as a possible supplement for science classes. The response from teachers was negative but county school officials still planned to distribute the books to school libraries so teachers and students could use it as a resource. According to the local Civic, Business and Ministry Coalition, copies of the book were purchased by the Coalition from the [[Institute for Creation Research]] in [[San Diego, California]], and were sent to school administrators on the grounds that it was "a good, science-based text appropriate for school children". The Coalition was reported to have met administrators on several occasions to promote creation science. However, the county school board did not find out about the matter until January 1995.&lt;ref&gt;"Evangelism meetings not known to Fla. officials." ''New Orleans Times-Picayune'', 22 January 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Wall Street Journal'' reported in November that according to the Foundation for Thought and Ethics, 22,500 copies of the book had been printed and teachers and curriculum buyers in 48 states had bought it. Fifteen school districts had ordered quantities large enough to indicate classroom use, but had not been identified "for fear of embroiling them in controversy".&lt;ref name="wsj141194" /&gt;

In January 1995, conservative members of the [[Plano, Texas]], school trust proposed to adopt ''Of Pandas and People'' as a supplement to the existing curriculum course materials.&lt;ref&gt;"Science book creating dissent Plano considering text that foes criticize as dogma; backers say it balances evolution", Dallas Morning News, 12 January 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The district school board unanimously voted to bar the book's acquisition following an outcry from local residents, many of whom attended the board's meeting wearing buttons with a red "X" over a panda.&lt;ref&gt;"Trustees kill plan to buy divisive book: Plano biology teachers won't receive copies."

In April 1997, the school board of [[Chesapeake, Virginia]], purchased copies of the book for the libraries of each of the district's 15 high schools and middle schools. The acquisition was made on the recommendation of School Superintendent W. Randolph Nichols, but the board stated that the book was intended for use "as a resource book, not as a science book" and that it was not endorsing creationism.&lt;ref&gt;"Creationism creates dilemma in Chesapeake." ''Virginian-Pilot and Ledger-Star'', Norfolk, VA, 22 April 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

===1999–2003===

In June 1999, the school district in [[Burlington, Washington]], approved a local science teacher's proposal to use extracts from ''Of Pandas and People'' in the classroom "so long as he balances it with enough support for teachings on evolution which he always included in his courses but about which he says he has doubts &amp;mdash; especially in terms of the origin of the human race". The decision followed an earlier demand by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], that the teacher, Roger DeHart, should cease his years-long practice of teaching intelligent design in his classes. He stated that he needed to counterbalance the inclusion of information that was "at best wrong and at worst fraudulent" in the standard textbooks used in Burlington schools.&lt;ref&gt;"Use of creationist text approved in Burlington." Associated Press Newswires, 14 June 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year, another attempt to introduce ''Of Pandas and People'' into Idaho schools was reported to have been rejected by the state textbook committee.&lt;ref&gt;"Teachers tiptoe around evolution." ''Cincinnati Enquirer'', 13 December 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2000, the science curriculum director of the [[Kanawha County, West Virginia]], school district selected ''Of Pandas and People'' as a textbook "that presents Darwin's Theory of Evolution as theory, not fact" following pressure from the local community and teachers. A committee of science teachers unanimously voted to purchase copies of the book, but ultimately decided to abandon the idea for fear of litigation. A Christian conservative legal group, the [[Thomas More Law Center]], offered to represent the county for free if any litigation arose but its offer was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;"Group abandons 'creation' textbook &amp;mdash; Federal ruling on 'intelligent design' changes minds of science teachers. ''Charleston Gazette'', 4 April 2000&lt;/ref&gt; A proposal to buy the book for school libraries was eventually rejected by the school board, though a conservative member of the board pledged to pay for at least 14 copies out of her own pocket.&lt;ref&gt;"School board won't buy anti-evolution textbook." ''Charleston Gazette'', 16 June 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Pratt, Kansas]], the local school board voted to remove any mention of [[macroevolution]], the [[age of the Earth]], and the [[physical cosmology|origin of the Universe]] from science curriculum, but rejected a bid to adopt ''Of Pandas and People'' for educational purposes.

===2004–2005: Dover, Pennsylvania===
{{main article|Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District}}
''Of Pandas and People'' became the focus of a litigation and controversy in [[Dover, Pennsylvania]] in 2004 after the Dover Area School Board endorsed it as a reference book. Perhaps inevitably, the ensuing court case was dubbed the "Panda Trial" by the media in an allusion to the famous "[[Monkey Trial]]" of 1925.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ydr.com/doverbiology/ci_3219280 Of Behe and mammary glands] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910065140/http://www.ydr.com/doverbiology/ci_3219280 |date=2006-09-10 }}." ''York Daily Record'', 20 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the board did not actually purchase the book, 60 copies were donated to the district by an anonymous party. It was revealed in court that a school board member asked his church for donations for the purchase of those books&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=15468591&amp;BRD=2212&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=465812&amp;rfi=6 Former school board member 'misspoke' in advocating creationism]&lt;/ref&gt; although that board member had denied all knowledge of the source of donation in an earlier deposition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/webfm_send/409 deposition (pp 57-58)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Amid an international controversy, the board also became the first in the US to promote the teaching of intelligent design in the classroom, sparking a lawsuit, ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'', by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and other plaintiffs.

The FTE became involved in the Dover controversy when it became clear that ''Of Pandas and People'' would be a major focus of litigation. The foundation filed a motion to join the defending side in June 2005, arguing that a finding that intelligent design was religious would destroy FTE's ability to market its textbooks within the district, and affect its ability to market the textbooks to any public school in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pamd.uscourts.gov/kitzmiller/04cv2688-111.pdf O:\Jones\Neiburg\Dover Area School District\Motion to Intervene.wpd&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050928211400/http://www.pamd.uscourts.gov/kitzmiller/04cv2688-111.pdf |date=2005-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Had the motion been granted, the FTE would have become a co-defendant with the Dover Area School Board, and able to bring its own lawyers and expert witnesses to the case. However, [[William A. Dembski]], co-author of the new ''Pandas'' edition, and the Discovery Institute withdrew from the case. The Judge told the defendants:  "To me it looks like Mr. Dembski was dropped as an expert because he didn't want to produce, or because his employer didn't want to produce the manuscript [on subpoena to the court] of ''[[The Design of Life]]''."&lt;ref name=buell&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/buell2.html Pre-Trial transcript: July 14, Part 2], [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his decision on the motion, Judge [[John E. Jones III]] ruled that FTE was not entitled to intervene in the case because its motion to intervene was not timely, describing FTE's excuses for not trying to become involved earlier as "both unavailing and disingenuous". Judge Jones also held that FTE failed to demonstrate that it has "a significantly protectable interest in the litigation warranting intervention as a party" and that its interests will not be adequately represented by the defendants.

While FTE did not become a party Jon A. Buell, the director of FTE testified on July 14, 2005, at the Dover Trial. Buell denied having known about actions of the [[Thomas More Law Center]] to which the Judge said it "strains credulity".&lt;ref name=buell/&gt;

In November 2005, eight of the nine members of the Dover school board were voted out of office and replaced with candidates who opposed the previous board's decision to introduce intelligent design and lay doubts on evolution.

On December 20, 2005, the US District Court ruled that intelligent design is not science and is essentially religious in nature, and the board's requirement endorsing intelligent design as an alternative to evolution in science classes, unconstitutional on the grounds that its inclusion violates the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].

The judge in the Dover trial specifically referred to ''Pandas'' in his decision, stating:

{{quote|As Plaintiffs meticulously and effectively presented to the Court, ''Pandas'' went through many drafts, several of which were completed prior to and some after the Supreme Court's decision in ''Edwards'', which held that the Constitution forbids teaching creationism as science. By comparing the pre and post ''Edwards'' drafts of ''Pandas'', three astonishing points emerge: (1) the definition for creation science in early drafts is identical to the definition of ID; (2) cognates of the word creation (creationism and creationist), which appeared approximately 150 times, were deliberately and systematically replaced with the phrase ID; and (3) the changes occurred shortly after the Supreme Court held that creation science is religious and cannot be taught in public school science classes in ''Edwards''. This word substitution is telling, significant, and reveals that a purposeful change of words was effected without any corresponding change in content .... The weight of the evidence clearly demonstrates, as noted, that the systemic change from "creation" to "intelligent design" occurred sometime in 1987, after the Supreme Court's important ''Edwards'' decision.|Judge [[John E. Jones III]]|Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/2:Context#Page 32 of 139|Ruling - context, pg. 32]]  [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The newly elected board unanimously rescinded the policy on January 3, 2006.

The '''Partnership for Academic Competition Excellence''' ('''PACE''') is a [[United States]] based [[501(c) organization#501.28c.29.283.29|501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit organization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=16321|title=PACE 501(c)(3) Status|last=Rosenberg|first=Ryan|website=The Quizbowl Resource Center|date=August 28, 2014|accessdate=Aug 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that promotes high school [[quiz bowl]] and runs the National Scholastic Championship (NSC), an end-of-year national tournament for high school [[quiz bowl]] teams. PACE was founded in 1996 by a group of quiz bowl players and coaches who were dissatisfied with the quality of high school quiz bowl at the time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pace-nsc.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt; The NSC has been run in the June of every year since 1998. Beyond running the NSC, PACE offers advice and staff assistance to high schools and colleges who run high school quiz bowl tournaments. PACE does not currently supply questions for regular season tournaments or offer a collegiate competition program, unlike [[NAQT]] or Questions Unlimited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= What Is Quiz Bowl?|website=Northern California Quiz Bowl Alliance|url=http://www.norcalquizbowl.org/?page_id=18|accessdate=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to running a national tournament, PACE awards the Benjamin Cooper Academic Ambassador Award each year at the opening ceremony of the NSC. The award is chosen by PACE members to honor "a high school academic competition team member, advisor, or organization whose character best promotes the spirit and honor of quiz bowl competition". It is named for Ben Cooper, who, as the captain of the [[It's Academic]] quiz bowl team at [[Georgetown Day School]], worked with the PACE founders to provide a player's perspective on the plans for the inaugural NSC. Ben Cooper died in an automobile accident just before the start of his senior year. In 2004, PACE expanded its recognition program to include a "Young Ambassador" Award to recognize individuals or recent alumni from high school or college quiz bowl programs for "valuable and significant contributions to the high school academic competition community".

==National Scholastic Championship==
PACE runs the National Scholastic Championship, a tournament for high school quiz bowl teams. Teams that attend the PACE NSC are mainly from [[Secondary education in the United States|schools in the United States]], with teams from [[Education in Canada|Canada]], and [[Secondary education in Singapore|Singapore]] having also attended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pantagraph.com/news/local/education/underdog-bhs-places-th-in-national-scholastic-bowl-event/article_3b383278-9dfe-5f8a-8ccc-82e4866d4256.html|title='Underdog' BHS places 15th in national Scholastic Bowl event|website=Pantagraph.com|first=Maria|last=Nagle|date=May 29, 2014|accessdate=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teams qualify by placing well at a PACE-certified tournament. There are three levels of qualifier events, with higher levels allowing qualified teams to register earlier. A number of teams can also qualify via a wild card bid.&lt;ref name="Qualification quidelines"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pace-nsc.org/2015-nsc-team-qualification-guidelines/|title=2015 NSC – Team Qualification Guidelines|accessdate=November 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no limit to the number of teams from a single school that can qualify or attend. In order to qualify multiple teams from one school, multiple teams must concurrently qualify at the same tournament.&lt;ref name="Qualification quidelines"/&gt;
 
===Format===
{{See also|Quiz bowl#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of quiz bowl}}
The tournament takes place over two days during the weekend. On Saturday, teams are grouped into pools for preliminary rounds and play a [[Round robin tournament|round robin]] within that group, then are regrouped for playoff rounds based on their win-loss record in their preliminary group. On Sunday, teams are again regrouped into "superplayoff" brackets. Usually, a final will be played between the top two teams, though specific circumstances can make a final match unnecessary. Following the final rounds, an All-Star game featuring the top individual scorers is played and the closing ceremony is held.

Each round consists of two halves of ten tossups and ten bonuses.&lt;ref name="PACE rules"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pace-nsc.org/concise-rules-of-tossupbonus-quizbowl/|title=Concise Rules of Tossup/Bonus Quizbowl|website=Partnership for Academic Competition Excellence|last=Pinyan|first=Jon|accessdate=August 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tossups are worth 10 points for a correct answer, though 20 points may be awarded if they are answered early. Team are not penalized points.&lt;ref name="PACE rules"/&gt; [[Quiz bowl#Bonuses|Bouncebacks]] are allowed for bonuses. In the event of a tie, three tossups with bonuses are read. If the score is still tied after this, a sudden death tossup will be read.&lt;ref name="PACE rules"/&gt;

From 1998 to 2009, the NSC used a slightly different gameplay format that was distinct from most other quiz bowl tournaments. The old format had three rounds with varying gameplay, the Related Tossup-Bonus round, the Category Quiz round, and the Stretch round.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.qbwiki.com/wiki/Old_PACE_format|title=Old PACE format|website=QBWiki|date=July 22, 2013|first1=Matt|last1=Jackson|first2=David|last2=Reinstein|accessdate=November 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, PACE organized the second annual "The Weekend of Quizbowl", a regular season invitational tournament at George Mason University that drew teams from across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;t=7030&amp;start=0|title=Weekend of Quizbowl II (3/14 + 3/15/09, Fairfax, VA)|first=Matt|last=Weiner|date=January 7, 2014|website=The Quizbowl Resource Center|accessdate=November 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the tournament ran on a custom question packets set that was also sold to other invitational tournaments. PACE did not run the tournament the following year. In 2014, PACE created an outreach fund to give monetary grants of up to {{usd}}200 to high school quiz bowl teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=16562|title=PACE Outreach Fund|date=October 11, 2014|first=Ryan|last=Rosenberg|website=The Quizbowl Resource Center|accessdate=November 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7636">'''Philosophical counseling''', also sometimes called '''philosophical practice''', is a contemporary movement in [[practical philosophy]].  Developing since the 1980s, practitioners of philosophical counseling ordinarily have a doctorate or minimally a master's degree in philosophy and offer their philosophical counseling or consultation services to clients who look for a philosophical understanding of their lives, social problems, or even mental problems. In the last case philosophical counseling might be in lieu of, or in conjunction with, traditional [[psychotherapy]]. The movement has often been said to be rooted in the [[Socrates|Socratic tradition]], which viewed philosophy as a search for the Good and the good life. A life without [[philosophy]] was not worth living for Socrates.

==History ==
Peter Koestenbaum at San Jose State University in California was an early figure in Philosophical Counseling. His 1978 book ''The New Image of the Person: The Theory and Practice of Clinical Philosophy'' set out the essential contributions of philosophy to counseling. His own practice was augmented by extensive training of mental health professionals in applications of philosophical principles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pib.net/bio_peter.htm | accessdate=2014-05-15&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's oldest association of philosophical counseling and practice appears to be the German Society for Philosophical Practice and Counseling, which was founded in 1982 by the German philosopher, [[Gerd B. Achenbach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://sites.google.com/site/thephilosophicalcounselingweb/home/ |title= The Philosophical Practice and Counseling Website|author= Center Sophon|accessdate= 2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the oldest association of philosophical counseling and practice appears to be the National Philosophical Counseling Association (NPCA), formerly called the American Society for Philosophy, Counseling, and Psychotherapy, which was co-founded in 1992 by three American philosophers, Elliot D. Cohen, Paul Sharkey, and Thomas Magnell. The NPCA offers a primary certificate in [[logic-based therapy]] (LBT) through the Institute of Critical Thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.npcassoc.org/ |title= National Philosophical Counseling Association - Official Website | accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Philosophical Practitioners Association (APPA) was founded in 1998 in New York City by Professor Lou Marinoff.  APPA offers a certification program in client counseling for those with advanced degrees in philosophy who wish to practice philosophical counseling.  It also publishes a professional Journal and has a membership list of those certified as philosophical counselors on its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.appa.edu/ |title= American Philosophical Practitioners Association - Official Website | accessdate=2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marinoff was at the center of a 2004 controversy when his philosophical counseling practice at [[City College of New York]] was temporarily shuttered by college officials who feared he was offering mental health advice without proper training and licensing; Marinoff responded by suing for what he described as his [[freedom of speech]] being stifled.&lt;ref name=Duane2004/&gt;

There are presently a number of professional associations for philosophical counseling throughout the world, including France, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Great Britain, Italy, Spain, Greece, the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, Poland, Finland, Luxembourg, Israel, Canada, South Africa, Australia, Brazil, Portugal, Korea, Turkey, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore and the United States.

==Goals and methods==
According to the Preamble of the NPCA Standards of Practice,
:a philosophical practitioner helps clients to clarify, articulate, explore and comprehend philosophical aspects of their belief systems or world views....Clients may consult philosophical practitioners for help in exploring philosophical problems related to such matters as mid-life crises, career changes, stress, emotions, assertiveness, physical illness, death and dying, aging, meaning of life, and morality. On the other side philosophical practitioners also initiate projects in common life worlds with various goals that are related to essential problems of life, such as sustainable energy, direct democracy, etc. 
Activities common to philosophical practice include:
# the examination of clients' arguments and justifications
# the clarification, analysis, and definition of important terms and concepts
# the exposure and examination of underlying assumptions and logical implications
# the exposure of conflicts and inconsistencies
# the exploration of traditional philosophical theories and their significance for client issues
# the initiation of projects for common goods 
# all other related activities that have historically been identified as philosophical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://npcassoc.org/documents/ |title= Standards of Practice|author= ASPCP|accessdate= 2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The methods and orientations of philosophical counselors vary greatly. Some practitioners, such as [[Gerd B. Achenbach]] (Germany), [[Michel Weber]] (Belgium) and [[Shlomit C. Schuster]] (Israel) are dialogical and dialective engaged, while confessing to a "beyond method" approach. They hold that philosophical counseling has the aim to empower clients' philosophical abilities, which additionally may have therapeutic implications.&lt;ref&gt;Schuster, S.C. (1999). [http://www.abc-clio.com/product.aspx?id=2147498636 ''Philosophy Practice: An Alternative to Counseling and Psychotherapy''.] Westport, CT:[[Praeger Publishers|Praeger]]; cf. [[Michel Weber]]'s own blend of [https://chromatika.academia.edu/MichelWeber praxis].&lt;/ref&gt;  "Others are directive oriented and view philosophical counseling as a form of mental health intervention".&lt;ref&gt;Raabe, P. (2001). ''Philosophical Counseling.'' Westport, CT: [[Praeger Publishers|Praeger]].&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophical practitioners, notably Louis Marinoff (U.S.) and Guenther Witzany (Austria), view philosophical practice as a separate practice area distinct from mental health practices such as psychology and mental health counseling;&lt;ref&gt;Guenther Witzany (ed) (1991). Zur Theorie der Philosophischen Praxis. Essen. {{ISBN|3-89206-407-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while others, notably Elliot D. Cohen (U.S.), think they are necessarily intertwined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://npcassoc.org/journal/table-of-contents/vol-2-no-2/ |title= Philosophy with Teeth:  The Wedding of Philosophical and Psychological Practices|author= Elliot D. Cohen|accessdate= 2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophical counselors draw inspiration from the [[anti-psychiatry]] movement, arguing that widespread mental health diagnostic criteria as outlined in [[DSM IV]] have unfairly or inaccurately [[psychopathology|pathologized]] humanity.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Z. Kotkowicz (1997). ''R.D. Laing and the Paths of Anti-Psychiatry'', NY: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a ''New York Times'' article on philosophical counseling, "only Cohen and Marinoff have branded easily comprehended techniques. Cohen's [[logic-based therapy]] builds on the work of his mentor [[Albert Ellis]], who invented [[rational emotive behavior therapy]]."&lt;ref name=Duane2004&gt;{{cite news |last=Duane |first=Daniel |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/21/magazine/the-socratic-shrink.html?src=pm |title= The Socratic Shrink |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=2004-03-21 |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Residence Hall Director''' is [[college]] or [[university]] employee generally responsible for the management and daily operations of campus [[residence halls]]. While the term Residence Hall Director is the common title used for this position, they are also known at different schools as Area Coordinators (ACs), Area Directors (ADs), Hall Coordinators (HCs), Community Directors (CDs), Hall Directors (HDs), Resident or Residence Directors (RDs), Resident Deans (RDs), Residence Hall Coordinators (RHCs), or Residence Life Coordinators (RLCs). While different titles are used by different colleges and universities, the positions generally have similar job requirements, dependent upon the size of the institution and scope of the position's overarching department.

== Qualifications ==

Although not universal, some universities require Residence Hall Directors to have earned the minimum of a [[bachelor's degree]], while most others require a [[master's degree]] in college student personnel, [[higher education]], or another related or relevant field. Some universities fill the Residence Hall Director positions with [[graduate students]] who are only [[part time]] and may be required to complete fewer tasks or are responsible for smaller residential areas.  There are also institutions that hire undergraduate students for the position.  These students are often overseen by an Area Coordinator or a mid-level student affairs officer.

== Responsibilities ==

The main responsibility of the hall director is the direct supervision of [[Resident Assistant]]s (RAs).  Often carrying out the training of the RAs themselves, Residence Hall Directors meet frequently with their RAs to ensure the residence hall community is healthy and operating smoothly.

In addition to meeting and managing the RAs and any other hall staff, Residence Hall Directors frequently (depending on the university) have many of the following responsibilities:
*manage the hall [[Secretary|secretaries]] and [[Janitor|custodian staff]]
*teach sections of transfer or first-year seminar classes
*oversee the judicial process of residence students ranging from fines, behavioral contracts, community service to eviction.
*provide [[counseling]] to student residents
*refer residents to proper campus offices and support services
*plan and implement social activities
*advise the Hall Council
*provide crisis support to parents and students
*coordinate emergency/crisis response to the rest of the University
*serve as a liaison to university officials and law enforcement personnel
*enforce hall behavior codes and meet with students who break policies
*general administrative work for the hall
*mediate roommate conflicts and oversee room change process. 

Another aspect of being a Residence Hall Director is that they also tend to live in the hall or a separate adjoining [[apartment]].  They also tend to be on call 24 hours a day and are generally called by their RAs if problems arise needing attention.

'''The Robert Gordon University's School of Computing Science and Digital Media''' is one of the four schools in the Faculty of Design and Technology at [[The Robert Gordon University]] in [[Aberdeen]], [[Scotland]] and offers a wide range of undergraduate and postgraduate degree programmes, as well as a PhD programme. The School has been recognised as the best computer science department of any UK modern university in the Good University Guide 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rgu.ac.uk/computing/aboutTheSchool/page.cfm?pge=29651 School of Computing Science and Digital Media, The Robert Gordon University]&lt;/ref&gt;

The School's research areas include Information Retrieval and Interaction, Computer Science Education, Knowledge Based Systems, [[Computational Intelligence]], Graphics and Imaging, and Mathematics for Computing and Engineering. Much of its research is encompassed by SmartWeb, a centre of excellence on intelligent computing technologies and their application to new types of Web-based systems and services. A new £1 million purpose-designed Computing Technologies Research Centre has recently been opened. The School is located in the Sir Ian Wood building (formerly known as Riverside East) at the University's Garthdee campus.

The '''South African Democratic Teachers Union''' ('''SADTU''') is the largest&lt;ref&gt;''Mail &amp; Guardian'', 12 February 2013, Bongani Nkosi, [http://mg.co.za/article/2013-02-12-sadtu-pickets-for-soobrayans-head Sadtu pickets for Soobrayan's head]&lt;/ref&gt; trade union for teachers in [[South Africa]]. It is allied to the [[African National Congress]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21713858-why-it-bottom-class-south-africa-has-one-worlds-worst-education|title=South Africa has one of the world’s worst education systems|website=The Economist|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is an affiliate of the [[Congress of South African Trade Unions]] (COSATU).

The union has rejected a proposal by the [[Department of Basic Education]] (DBE) for performance-agreement contracts for school principals, pointing out that employment contracts already outlines principals' obligations, and claiming that such performance agreements would be unfair in the light of poor resourcing and lack of skills at schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/national/labour/2017-05-04-sadtu-reiterates-rejection-of-appraisals-for-principals/|title=Sadtu reiterates rejection of appraisals for principals|last=Phakathi|first=Bekezela|date=2014-05-04|work=|access-date=2017-05-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the [[National Education Collaboration Trust]] began work with SADTU to improve teaching at the basic education level in the [[Eastern Cape]] and [[Limpopo]] provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/national/education/2017-01-19-education-trust-to-train-teachers-at-weak-schools/|title=Education trust to train teachers at weak schools|last=Phakathi|first=Bekezela|date=2017-01-19|work=|access-date=2017-05-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jobs for cash ==
In April, 2014, [[City Press (South Africa)|City Press]] reported that SADTU officials were running a racket, which involved accepting monetary bribes from educators in return for access to teaching or managerial positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/Archives/City-Press/How-Sadtu-sells-its-posts-20150429|title=How Sadtu sells its posts|last=Harper|first=Paddy|date=|work=News24|access-date=2017-05-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430064550/http://www.citypress.co.za/news/sadtu-sells-posts/|archive-date=2014-04-30|dead-url=no|last2=Masondo|first2=Sipho}}&lt;/ref&gt; SADTU responded that the union was "only party to the filling of posts as observers to ensure the fairness" of the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politics/our-response-to-city-press-jobsforsale-claims--sad|title=Our response to City Press` jobs-for-sale claims - SADTU KZN|last=Caluza|first=Caluza|last2=Shandu|first2=Bheki|date=2015-05-19|website=www.politicsweb.co.za|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DBE subsequently set up a ministerial task team (MTT), headed by Professor [[John Volmink]], to investigate. The MTT indicated that six provinces were affected by the racketeering: the North West, KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng, Limpopo, Mpumalanga, and the Eastern Cape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://city-press.news24.com/News/education-in-south-africa-a-system-in-crisis-20160531|title=Education in South Africa: A system in crisis|last=Masondo|first=Sipho|date=2016-05-31|work=CityPress|access-date=2017-05-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi admitted that his department was controlled by SADTU, and that the selling and buying of educational posts was "endemic".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://city-press.news24.com/News/break-sadtus-power-20160514|title=‘Break Sadtu’s power’|last=Masondo|first=Sipho|date=2016-05-15|work=CityPress|access-date=2017-05-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Minister of Basic Education]] [[Angie Motshekga]] observed that the investigations implicated primarily SADTU,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ewn.co.za/2015/12/20/Sadtu-controls-most-provincial-education-depts|title=Damning report exposes rot in Sadtu|last=Bendile|first=Dineo|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; although other teachers unions and government officials were also involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/govt-report-accuses-sadtu-of-selling-teaching-posts-20151217|title=Sadtu accused of selling teaching posts|last=Tandwa|first=Lizeka|date=2015-12-17|work=News24|access-date=2017-05-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

The dysfunction in schools was attributed to "weak" government systems that had been "infiltrated" by a "complex patronage system".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sowetanlive.co.za/news/2015/12/18/bid-to-end-selling-of-teacher-posts|title=Bid to end selling of teacher posts|last=Reporter|first=Bongekile Macupe Education|date=2015-12-18|website=Sowetan LIVE|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Sadtu-selling-principals-posts-in-exchange-for-cows-sheep-and-goats-20150517|title=Sadtu selling principals’ posts in exchange for cows, sheep and goats|last=Masondo|first=Sipho|date=2015-05-17|work=News24|access-date=2017-05-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report's conclusion was that SADTU's membership in the ANC's [[tripartite alliance]] gave it “enormous power and influence” over the education system, described the situation as “dangerous and inappropriate”, and found that it held the education system hostage to political processes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Following the release of the MTT's report, which SADTU had stalled until May, 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/kwazulu-natal/sadtu-in-fresh-protest-over-cash-for-jobs-report-2018658|title=Sadtu in fresh protest over cash-for-jobs report|last=Mlambo|first=Sihle|date=2016-05-06|work=Independent Online|access-date=2017-05-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last2=Nxumalo|first2=Mphathi|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Professional Teachers' Organisation of South Africa|NAPTOSA]], the second-largest teachers union in the country, welcomed the "honest attempt to address a vexing problem" but accused the Volmink team of "union-bashing"; NATU, the third-largest teachers union, found the investigation lacking, and the following year called for a judicial commission of inquiry, which would be able to more substantively investigate the issue due to its judicial powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://city-press.news24.com/News/union-wants-new-jobs-for-cash-probe-20160521|title=Union wants new jobs-for-cash probe|last=Masondo|first=Sipho|date=2016-05-22|work=CityPress|access-date=2017-05-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; SADTU objected that they were being singled out for scapegoating for the ills of South Africa's education system, and insisted that there was no evidence that SADTU had facilitated improper conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.702.co.za/articles/13719/we-are-being-used-as-a-scapegoat-says-sadtu-on-jobs-for-cash-scandal-report|title='We are being used as a scapegoat', says Sadtu on jobs-for-cash scandal report|last=Taunyane|first=Omogolo|date=2016-05-23|website=702|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar report by the SA Council of Educators found that the union as a whole had been involved, not just "a few rogue elements", as SADTU had maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://city-press.news24.com/News/sadtus-power-grab-20151219|title=How Sadtu captured the state|last=Masondo|first=Sipho|date=2015-12-20|work=CityPress|access-date=2017-05-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== KwaZulu-Natal ==
SADTU has blamed KwaZulu-Natal's provincial education department for the educator shortages in the province, blaming "the redistribution of teachers as a result of a post provisioning norms process". 2 800 teaching posts remained unfilled in the province in February, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/national/education/2017-02-09-no-teachers-in-kwazulu-natal-for-critical-subjects/|title=No teachers in KwaZulu-Natal for critical subjects|last=Mthethwa|first=Bongani|date=2017-02-09|work=Business Day|access-date=2017-05-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
''[[The Economist]]'', characterising South Africa's educational system as "one of the worst in the world", placed the blame on SADTU for "a lack of accountability and the abysmal quality of most teachers".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The Department of Basic Education itself has identified SADTU as an obstruction to government efforts to improve education, with Minister Motshekga describing the union's influence as a "stranglehold" on education.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/kwazulu-natal/education-rotten-from-bottom-to-top-1961734|title=Education ‘rotten from bottom to top’|last=Jansen|first=Leanne|date=2015-12-18|work=Independent Online|access-date=2017-05-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4959">'''The Newman Guide to Choosing a Catholic College''' is a guide published annually by the [[Cardinal Newman Society]] to assist students in choosing a Catholic college or university. It includes a list of Catholic institutions of higher education selected for their adherence to Catholic teaching and commitment to higher education.&lt;ref name=mead/&gt;&lt;ref name=most/&gt; The guide seeks to include schools which comport with the principles of ''[[Ex Corde Ecclesiae]]''.&lt;ref name=cnw/&gt;

First published in 2007, the Guide identifies 20 of the [[List of Roman Catholic universities and colleges in the United States|197 Catholic colleges in the United States]], as well as seven colleges and universities abroad and online where, in the Society's  view, "students can reasonably expect a faithful Catholic education and a campus culture that generally upholds the values taught in their homes and parishes."

The Guide claims "to show students where they can learn and grow in a genuine Catholic environment without the nonsense that has overtaken even some of the most well-known Catholic universities."&lt;ref name="guide"/&gt;  Not all recommended colleges are accredited,&lt;ref name="FAQ" /&gt; and the criteria for recommendation includes whether or not the [[Tridentine Mass]] is offered on campus.&lt;ref name="recommended" /&gt;

The Newman Guide is published both in printed book form and online.  The Guide's website includes all of the information for free.

The '''Tuition Assistance Program''' is a [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial aid]] program for students who are [[New York State]] residents and who are attending a post-secondary educational institution in New York. It is a program of the Higher Education Services Corporation which is a New York State Agency.

==Qualifications==
The Tuition Assistance Program, better known as TAP, is an aid program that helps New York State residents going to college with their tuition. To become eligible for TAP, students must be United States citizens and New York State residents. With the TAP award, a student can earn from $500 to $5,000. Because TAP is a grant, the aid does not need to be repaid. There are several determining factors that influence how much aid students receive, such as family income and tax status (independent or dependent). Dependent students qualify for TAP if their family net tax income is below $80,000, and independent students who are married but have no parental income qualify if their income is below $40,000. Single independent students qualify for TAP if they have no parental income and their personal income is below $10,000. Other qualifications include number of college credits and grade point average for individuals who are already in school.&lt;ref&gt;"Office of Postsecondary Access, Support &amp; Success." Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP):KIAP:NYSED. N.p., n.d. Web. 08 May 2016.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tuition Assistance Program is a part of a program called The Higher Education Services Corporation. The Higher Education Services program is a financial aid agency for college students. Tuition assistance is available for SUNY/CUNY colleges and can be used for tuition and fees for coursework related to students' majors. To apply for TAP, students can visit the financial aid website at FAFSA.gov. To apply students will first need the school name and code. If students are working part-time individuals can receive up to $1500, and if students are working full-time they can receive up to $3,000. If students are in school one must be a full-time student with at least a 2.0 average and taking 12 credits or more. Students will need to have a high school diploma and have graduated high school in the United States to be eligible for TAP. Also, according to the Higher Education Services Corporation, students must be charged at least $200 tuition per year.&lt;ref&gt;"Office of Postsecondary Access, Support &amp; Success." Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP):KIAP:NYSED. N.p., n.d. Web. 08 May 2016.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Undergraduate students who enroll in bachelors programs can receive four years of TAP if they are studying full-time.  If students do not fulfill the requirements for the tuition assistance then they can lose their funding and can be forced to repay the aid for that course. If a student is unable to keep up with credits or grades (for example, if a student's grade point average is below a C- with fewer than 12 credits) then the student can lose the assistance. Because TAP is a state program, some states have appeal programs, allowing participants to explain why they could not meet the requirements. Some states do not have the appeal process. If a student drops a class that TAP is paying for, the student may need to pay the full amount for that course. TAP is an award and it will appear on a student’s financial aid award letter from the school the student is attending or planning to attend and from the New York State higher service corporation (NYSHESC). The letter states how much aid students will be getting. Undergraduate students are limited to only 8 semesters to receive TAP.&lt;ref&gt;"Office of Postsecondary Access, Support &amp; Success." Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP):KIAP:NYSED. N.p., n.d. Web. 08 May 2016.
&lt;/ref&gt;

If students are in the HEOP program, which is the Arthur O. Eve Higher Education Opportunity program, then they are able to receive TAP for 10 semesters. To receive TAP students have to be studying a specific major and in an approved degree program. Each year the deadline to complete a TAP form is June 30. After filling out a FAFSA application, the website will provide a link to the TAP homepage to fill the application. Students will acquire a user ID and a pin number to apply and make changes.&lt;ref&gt;"Guideline &amp; Requirements." HEOPorg. N.p., n.d. Web. 08 May 2016.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar Programs==
In addition to the federal government's Free Application for Student Aid (FAFSA), there are programs similar to TAP in other states. Each state has its own grant/scholarship program for college students. The qualifications in each program are the similar to TAP. Some examples of different state grant programs are California's Cal grant program, Cal Dream Act, and Georgia's HOPE grant program. Grants are also provided by the US Military. The military tuition assistance program is for students who are of a military family. The military tuition program helps to pay almost the full amount of a student’s tuition costs. The program pays semester hours that are $250 and less and only applies to active duty members.&lt;ref&gt;"How to Use the Military Tuition Assistance Program." Military OneSource. N.p., n.d.

The '''United South End Settlements''' (USES) consist of four settlement houses, founded as part of the [[Settlement movement]] to provide services such as daycare, education, and healthcare to improve the lives of the poor, and a children's museum dating back to 1891.&lt;ref name="NEU Historical Note"&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical Note|url=http://www.library.neu.edu/archives/collect/findaids/m126findprint.htm}} ''Archives and Special Collections Finding Aids: United South End Settlements.'' Northeastern University Libraries, Archives and Special Collections. Web. Retrieved 19 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  With their slogan of "neighbors helping neighbors since 1891", the United South End Settlements continues to serve Boston's [[South End, Boston|South End]] and [[Lower Roxbury Historic District|Lower Roxbury]] community today.&lt;ref name=USES&gt;{{cite web|title=United South End Settlements|url=http://www.uses.org/|website=United South End Settlements|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; USES has grown and evolved over time to remain relevant to the South End.&lt;ref name="USES History"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.uses.org/about-us/history/|website=United South End Settlements|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The history of USES began in 1891 when William J. Tucker founded what was to become known as the South End House at 6 Rollins Street.&lt;ref name="NEU Finding Aid"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronology|url=http://www.library.neu.edu/archives/collect/findaids/m126findprint.htm}} ''Archives and Special Collections Finding Aids: United South End Settlements.'' Northeastern University Libraries, Archives and Special Collections. Web. Retrieved 19 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The South End House would be the first of its kind "in Boston and the fourth one in the United States."&lt;ref name="NEU Historical Note" /&gt; Before the incorporation of the final five organizations into USES, the Federation of South End Settlements was formed in 1950.&lt;ref name="NEU Historical Note" /&gt; The Federation of South End Settlements was made up of the South End House, Lincoln House (1892), Hale House (1895), [[Harriet Tubman]] House (1904), Ellis Memorial House, and Eldridge House. This federation was founded in order to create a larger pool of funds for the organizations to share.&lt;ref name="NEU Historical Note" /&gt; Eventually the Ellis Memorial and Eldridge Houses would disassociate themselves in 1959, and the four remaining houses and the Children's Art Centre would unite to become the United South End Settlements in January 1960.&lt;ref name="NEU Historical Note" /&gt;

USES originally focused on providing services to "[improve] housing, public health, and sanitation, developing day care programs that included medical care for children, and creating mental health programs."&lt;ref name="NEU Historical Note" /&gt; Specifically, USES' "residents established milk stations, public baths, dispensaries, and services, such as emergency loan and stamp savings programs"&lt;ref name="NEU Historical Note" /&gt; USES also founded "specialized schools for industrial, vocational, and employment training for both women and men" to create more opportunity in the South End neighborhood.&lt;ref name="NEU Historical Note" /&gt; Culture and arts were not forgotten in the South End either as USES provided "free concerts, art exhibitions, reading rooms, and a variety of social, drama, and literary clubs" for its residents. As of 2014, USES still provides many of the same services that it has all along, incorporating the technology of today into its programs and curriculums for the residents of the South End and Lower Roxbury community.&lt;ref name= "USES" /&gt;

==Programs==
* '''After School Program'''
: 52 children, aged 5–12 years, are accepted into the USES After School Program. The program's mission is to "support school success and promote the social, cognitive, and emotional development of the students."&lt;ref name=ASP&gt;{{cite web|title=After School Program|url=http://www.uses.org/programs/asp/|website=United South End Settlements|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program runs the full year while school is in session, and during summer and vacation days.&lt;ref name= "ASP" /&gt;
* '''Camp Hale'''
: Camp Hale is offered to both boys and girls aged 6–14 years during the summer months.&lt;ref name= "CH"&gt;{{cite web|title=Camp Hale|url=http://www.uses.org/programs/camphale/|website=United South End Settlements|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summer sessions are divided by age and gender (e.g., all-girls ages 8-14 years). Camp Hale was founded on the principle that "all youth, particularly those from urban environments, will benefit from challenging opportunities for physical, mental, and social growth and development."&lt;ref name= "CH" /&gt;
* '''Children's Art Centre'''
: The Children's Art Centre offers three annual events and five programs to youth ages 3 months to 15 years.

Many scholars and policymakers have noted that the fields of [[science, technology, engineering, and mathematics]] (STEM) have remained predominantly male with historically low participation among [[Woman|women]] since their origins during the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

Scholars are exploring the various reasons for the continued existence of this [[gender]] disparity in STEM fields. Those who view this disparity as resulting from [[discrimination|discriminatory]] forces are also seeking ways to redress this disparity within STEM fields (these typically construed as well-compensated, high-status professions with universal career appeal).&lt;ref&gt;Gürer, Denise and Camp, Tracy (2001).

Studies suggest that many factors contribute to the attitudes towards the achievement of young women in [[mathematics]] and [[science]], including encouragement from parents, interactions with mathematics and science teachers, curriculum content, hands-on laboratory experiences, high school achievement in mathematics and science, and resources available at home.&lt;ref name="Lost Talent"&gt;S.L. Hanson, "Lost Talent, Women in the Sciences", Philadelphia, PA.: Temple University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], research findings are mixed concerning when boys' and girls' attitudes about mathematics and science diverge. Analyzing several nationally representative [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]], one researcher found few differences in girls' and boys' attitudes towards science in the early secondary school years.&lt;ref name="Lost Talent"/&gt; Students' aspirations to pursue careers in mathematics and science influence both the courses they choose to take in those areas and the level of effort they put forth in these courses.

A 1996 study suggested girls begin to lose self-confidence in middle school because they believe that men possess more intelligence in technological fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pajares | first1 = F | year = 1996 | title = Self-efficacy beliefs and mathematical problem-solving of gifted students | url = | journal = [[Contemporary Educational Psychology]] | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 325–44 | doi=10.1006/ceps.1996.0025}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that men outperform women in spatial analysis, a skillset many engineering professionals deem vital, generates this misconception.&lt;ref name="CeciWilliams2009" /&gt; Feminist scholars postulate that boys are more likely to gain spatial skills outside the classroom because they are culturally encouraged to build and work with their hands.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Catherine, and Christianne Corbett.

A 1996 study of college freshmen by the [[Higher Education Research Institute]] shows that men and women differ greatly in their intended fields of study. Of first-time college freshmen in 1996, 20 percent of men and 4 percent of women planned to major in [[computer science]] and [[engineering]], while similar percentages of men and women planned to major in [[biology]] or [[Physical Sciences|physical sciences]]. The differences in the intended majors between male and female first-time freshmen directly relate to the differences in the fields in which men and women earn their degree. At the post-secondary level, women are less likely than men to earn a degree in mathematics, physical sciences, or computer sciences and engineering. The exception to this gender imbalance is in the field of [[Life-science|life science]].&lt;ref name="Freshman"&gt;Higher Education Research Institute, Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, The American Freshman: National Norms for Fall 1996, University of California, Los Angeles, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects of underrepresentation of women in STEM careers ===
In [[Scotland]], a large number of women graduate in STEM subjects but fail to move onto a STEM career compared to men. The [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] estimates that doubling women's high-skill contributions to Scotland's economy would benefit it by £170&amp;nbsp;million per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Tapping All our Talents|date=April 2012|url=http://www.raeng.org.uk/publications/other/tapping-all-our-talents|location=United Kingdom|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=9780902198661|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Men's and women's earnings ===
{{See also|Gender pay gap}}
Female college graduates earned less on average than male college graduates, even though they shared the earnings growth of all college graduates in the 1980s. Some of the differences in salary are related to the differences in occupations entered by women and men. Among recent science and engineering bachelor's degree recipients, women were less likely than men to be employed in science and engineering occupations. There remains a wage gap between men and women in comparable scientific positions. Among more experienced scientists and engineers, the gender gap in salaries is greater than for recent graduates.&lt;ref&gt;National Science Foundation, Women, Minorities and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering: 1996, Washington, D.C.: 1996, appendix table 5-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Salaries are highest in mathematics, computer science, and engineering, which are fields in which women are not highly represented. In [[Australia]], a study conducted by the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] has shown that the current gender wage gap between men and women in STEM fields in Australia stands at 30.1 percent as of 2013, which is an increase of 3 percent since 2012.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.professionalsaustralia.org.au/professional-women/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2014/03/WOMEN_IN_STEM_v2.pdf|title=Women in STEM in Australia|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Professionals Australia|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, according to a study done by Moss, &lt;ref name="Moss-Racusin2012" /&gt;when faculty members of top research institutions in America were asked to recruit student applicants for a laboratory manager position, both men and women faculty members rated the male applicants as more hireable and competent for the position, as opposed to the female applicants who shared an identical resume with the male applicants. In the Moss study, faculty members were willing to give the male applicants a higher starting salary and career mentoring opportunities.&lt;ref name="Moss-Racusin2012" /&gt;

===Education and perception===
The percentage of PhDs in STEM fields in the U.S. earned by women is about 42%,&lt;ref name="NSF T7.3"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2017/nsf17310/static/data/tab7-3.xlsx |title=TABLE 7-3.

These differences start as early as the third grade according to Thomas Dee, with boys advancing in math and science and girls advancing in reading.&lt;ref&gt;Dee, Thomas S. "Teachers and the Gender Gaps in Student Achievement." The Journal of Human Resources, vol. 42, no. 3, 2007, pp. 528–554. {{JSTOR|40057317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Representation of women worldwide ==
[[UNESCO]], among other agencies including the [[European Commission]] and The Association of Academies and Societies of Sciences in Asia (AASSA), have been outspoken about the underrepresentation of women in STEM fields globally.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002315/231519e.pdf|title=A Complex Formula: Girls and Women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics in Asia|date=2015|website=UNESCO|publisher=UNESCO Bangkok Office|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=She figures 2012 – Research policy and organisation – EU Bookshop|url=http://bookshop.europa.eu/uri?target=EUB:NOTICE:KINA25617:EN:HTML|doi=10.2777/38520|date=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.interacademies.net/File.aspx?id=28016|title=Women in Science and Technology in Asia|date=1 September 2015|website=The InterAcademy Partnership|publisher=AASSA, Gyeonggi-Do|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their efforts to compile and interpret comparative statistics, it is necessary to exercise caution. [[Ann Hibner Koblitz]] has commented on the obstacles regarding the making of meaningful statistical comparisons between countries:&lt;ref name="fastlane"&gt;Ann Hibner Koblitz, "Life in the fast lane: Arab women in science and technology," ''Bulletin of Science, Technology &amp; Society'', vol. 36, no. 2 (2016), p. 107–117.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|
For a variety of reasons, it is difficult to obtain reliable data on international comparisons of women in STEM fields.  Aggregate figures do not tell us much, especially since terminology describing educational levels, content of majors, job categories, and other markers varies from country to country. 
}}
Even when different countries use the same definitions of terms, the social significance of the categories may differ considerably. Koblitz remarks:&lt;ref&gt;Ann Hibner Koblitz, "Mathematics and gender: Some cross-cultural observations," in Gila Hanna, ed., ''Towards Gender Equity in Mathematics Education: An ICMI Study'', Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1996, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not possible to use the same indicators to determine the situation in every country.  The significant statistic might be the percentage of women teaching at the university level.  But it might also be the proportion of women at research institutes and academies of sciences (and at what level), or the percentage of women who publish (or who publish in foreign as opposed to domestic journals), or the proportion of women who go abroad for conferences, post-graduate study, and so on, or the percentage of women awarded grants by national and international funding agencies.  Indices can have different meanings in different countries, and the prestige of various positions and honors can vary considerably.

[[File:Proportion of female graduates A Complex Formula.svg|thumb|Proportion of female graduates in science programmes in tertiary education in Asia.]]
A fact sheet published by UNESCO in March 2015&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; presented worldwide statistics of women in the STEM fields, with a focus on [[Asia]] and the Pacific region. It reports that, worldwide, 30 percent of researchers are women. In these areas, East Asia, the Pacific, South Asia and West Asia had the most uneven balance, with 20 percent of researchers being women in each of those sub-regions. Meanwhile, [[Central Asia]] had the most equal balance in the region, with women comprising 46 percent of its researchers. The Central Asian countries [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Kazakhstan]] were the only countries in Asia with women as the majority of their researchers, though in both cases it was by a very small margin.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002351/235155E.pdf|title=Women in Science|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=UNESCO|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cambodia ====
As of 2004, 13.9% of students enrolled in science programs in [[Cambodia]] were female and 21% of researchers in science, technology, and innovation&amp;nbsp;fields were female as of 2002. These statistics are significantly lower than those of other Asian countries such as [[Malaysia]], [[Mongolia]], and [[South Korea]]. According to a UNESCO report on women in STEM in Asian countries, Cambodia's education system has a long history of male dominance stemming from its male-only [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] teaching practices. Starting in 1924, girls were allowed to enroll in school. Bias against women, not only in education but in other aspects of life as well, exists in the form of traditional views of men as more powerful and dignified than women, especially in the home and in the workplace, according to UNESCO's ''A Complex Formula''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Indonesia ====
UNESCO's ''A Complex Formula'' states that [[Indonesia]]'s government has been working towards gender equality, especially through the [[Ministry of Education and Culture (Indonesia)|Ministry of Education and Culture]], but stereotypes about women's roles in the workplace persists. Due to traditional views and societal [[Norm (social)|norms]], women struggle to remain in their careers or to move up in the workplace. Substantially more women are enrolled in science-based fields such as [[pharmacy]] and biology than in mathematics and [[physics]]. Within engineering, statistics vary based on the specific engineering discipline; women make up 78% of [[chemical engineering]] students but only 5% of [[mechanical engineering]] students. As of 2005, out of 35,564 researchers in science, technology, and engineering, only 10,874 or 31% were female.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Malaysia ====
According to UNESCO, 48.19% of students enrolled in science programs in Malaysia were female as of 2011. This number has grown significantly in the past three decades, during which the country's employment of women has increased by 95%. In Malaysia, over 50% of employees in the computer industry, which is generally a male-dominated field within STEM, are women. Of students enrolled in pharmacy, more than 70% are female, while in engineering only 36% of students are female. Women held 49% of research positions in science, technology, and innovation as of 2011.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Mongolia ====
According to UNESCO's data from 2012 and 2011 respectively, 40.2% of students enrolled in science programs and 49% of researchers in science, technology, and innovation in Mongolia are female.&amp;nbsp;Traditionally, [[nomad]]ic Mongol culture was fairly egalitarian, with both women and men raising children, tending livestock, and fighting in battle, which mirrors the relative equality of women and men in Mongolia's modern-day workforce. More females than males pursue higher education and 65% of college graduates in Mongolia are women. However, women earn about 19–30% less than their male counterparts and are perceived by society to be less suited to engineering than men. Thirty percent or less of employees in computer science, construction architecture, and engineering are female while three in four biology students are female.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Nepal ====
As of 2011, 26.17% of [[Nepal]]'s science students were women and 19% of their engineering students were also women. In research, women held 7.8% of positions in 2010. These low percentages correspond with Nepal's patriarchal societal values. In Nepal, women that enter STEM fields most often enter forestry or medicine, specifically [[nursing]], which is perceived as a predominantly female occupation in most countries.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== South Korea ====
In 2012, 30.63% of students enrolled in science programs in South Korea were female, a number that has been increasing since the digital revolution. Numbers of male and female students enrolled at most levels of education are comparable as well, though the gender difference is larger in higher education. Confucian beliefs in the lower societal value of women as well as other cultural factors could influence South Korea's STEM gender gap. In South Korea, as in other countries, the percentage of women in medicine (61.6%) is much higher than the percentage of women in engineering (15.4%) and other more math-based stem fields. In research occupations in science, technology, and innovation, women made up 17% of the workforce as of 2011. In South Korea, most women working in STEM fields are classified as "non-regular" or temporary employees, indicating poor job stability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In a study conducted by the University of Glasgow which examined math anxiety and test performance of boys and girls from various countries, researchers found that South Korea had a high sex difference in mathematics scores, with female students scoring significantly lower than and experiencing more math anxiety on math tests than male students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stoet|first=Gijsbert|last2=Bailey|first2=Drew H.|last3=Moore|first3=Alex M.|last4=Geary|first4=David C.|date=2016-04-21|title=Countries with Higher Levels of Gender Equality Show Larger National Sex Differences in Mathematics Anxiety and Relatively Lower Parental Mathematics Valuation for Girls|journal=PLOS One|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e0153857|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0153857|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4839696|pmid=27100631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gulf states ====
[[Ann Hibner Koblitz]] reported&lt;ref name="fastlane"/&gt; on a series of interviews conducted in 2015 in Abu Dhabi with women engineers and computer scientists who had come to the United Arab Emirates and other Gulf states to find opportunities that were not available to them in their home country.  The women spoke of a remarkably high level of job satisfaction and relatively little discrimination.  Koblitz comments that

In the [[European Union]] only 16.7% on average of ICT (Information and communication technology) specialists are women. Only in [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] do women hold more that 25 percent of these roles. The gender distribution is more balanced, particularly in [[History of the European Union|new member states]] when taking into account ICT technicians (middle and low-ranking positions).&lt;ref name=EDJNet /&gt;

In 2012 the percentage of women PhD graduates was 47.3% of the total, 51% of the social sciences, business and law, 42% of the science, mathematics and computing, and just the 28% of PhD graduates in engineering, manufacturing and construction. In the computing subfield only 21% of PhD graduates were women. In 2013 in the EU as an average men scientists and engineers made up 4.1% of total labour force, while women made up only 2.8%. In more than half of the countries women make up less than 45% of scientists and engineers. The situation has improved, as between 2008 and 2011 the number of women amongst employed scientists and engineers grew by an average of 11.1% per year, while the number of men grew only by 3.3% over the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|date= 2016|title= She Figures 2015|url= https://ec.europa.eu/research/swafs/pdf/pub_gender_equality/she_figures_2015-final.pdf#view=fit&amp;pagemode=none|publisher= European Commission|page= |access-date= 28 August 2018 |ISBN=978-92-79-48375-2|doi=10.2777/744106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 in [[Slovenia]], [[Portugal]], [[France]], [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], and [[Italy]] there were more boys than girls taking advanced courses in mathematics and physics in secondary education in Grade 12.&lt;ref name=":06" /&gt;

Men are much more likely than women to have a STEM career regardless of educational attainment. Women in STEM fields earn considerably less than men, even after controlling for a wide set of characteristics such as education and age. On average, men in STEM jobs earn $36.34 per hour while women in STEM jobs earn $31.11 per hour.&lt;ref name="Women in STEM"/&gt;

Women dominate the total number of persons with bachelor's degrees, as well as those in STEM fields defined by the [[National Center for Education Statistics]]. However, they are underrepresented in specific fields including Computer Sciences, Engineering, and Mathematics.

Asian women are over-represented in STEM fields in the U.S.(though not as much as males of the same ethnicity) compared to African American, Hispanic, Pacific Islander, and Native American women.&lt;ref name="NCES2014"/&gt; Within academia, these minority women represent less than 1% of tenure-track positions in the top 100 U.S. universities despite constituting approximately 13% of total US population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Towns|first=Marcy|date=Spring 2010|title=Where Are the Women of Color?

==== African American Women ====
Prejudice and assumed stereotypes keep women of color, especially black women from studying in STEM fields. Psychologically, stereotypes on black women's intellect, cognitive abilities, and work ethic contribute to their lack of confidence in STEM. Spelman College is looking to change how the world looks at African American women, and welcomes black women helping to support them in becoming involved and technically proficient in STEM. Spelman provides the environment which cultivates creativity, intellectual thinking, and curiosity to broaden their thinking for complex solutions. 2,100 students of Spelman come from forty-four states, one territory and eleven countries, with one of the highest ranks of all institutions with black graduating with bachelors of science and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Kimberly M.|date=Spring 2014|title=Realigning the crooked room: Spelman claims a space for African American women in STEM|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A379445373/ITOF?u=auraria_main&amp;sid=ITOF&amp;xid=1a7ce7cd|journal=Realigning the Crooked Room: Spelman Claims a Space for African American Women in STEM|volume=16|pages=|via=Auraria Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Canada ====
According to the National Household Survey, women represented 39% of STEM graduates in Canada, as opposed to 66% in non-STEM fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/75-006-x/2013001/article/11874-eng.htm|title=Gender differences in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and computer science (STEM) programs at university|last=Hango|first=Darcy|date=2015|website=statcan|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted by the [[University of British Columbia]] discovered that only 20–25% of computer science students from all Canadian college and universities are women. As well, only about 1 in 5 of that percentage will graduate from those programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A325699497/GPS?u=ko_k12hs_d73&amp;sid=GPS&amp;xid=ce00382c|title=Unlocking the brilliance: author provides insights on how to inspire young women to join the high tech industry|website=link.galegroup.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistically, women are less likely to choose a STEM program, regardless of mathematical ability. Young men with lower marks in mathematics are more likely to pursue STEM fields than their women-identified peers with higher marks in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Darcy Hango|title=Gender differences in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and computer science (STEM) programs at university|date=18 Dec 2013|url=https://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/75-006-x/2013001/article/11874-eng.htm|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Underrepresentation in STEM-related awards and competitions ==
In terms of the most prestigious awards in STEM fields, fewer have been awarded to women than to men. Between 1901 and 2017 the female:total ratio of [[Nobel Prize]]s were 2:207 for physics, 4:178 for chemistry, 12:214 for physiology/medicine, and 1:79 for economic sciences.
The ratios for other fields were 14:114 in literature and 16:104 for peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/facts/ |title=Nobel Prize Facts |publisher= NobelPrize.org |access-date=18 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maryam Mirzakhani]] was the first woman and first Iranian to receive the [[Fields Medal]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mathunion.org/fileadmin/IMU/Prizes/2014/news_release_mirzakhani.pdf|title=The Work of Maryam Mirzakhani.

A review of UK patent applications, in 2016, found that the proportion of new inventions registered by women was rising, but that most female inventors were active in stereotypically female fields such as "designing bras and make-up". 94% of inventions in the field of computing, 96% in automotive applications and mining, and 99% in explosives and munitions, were by men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=New generation of inventors wanted: women need to apply|last=Keate|first=Georgie|date=27 December 2016|work=[[The Times]]|pages=22–23|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 [[Russia]] had the highest percentage of patents filed by women, at about 16%.

== Explanations for low representation of women ==
There are a variety of proposed reasons for the relatively low numbers of women in STEM fields. These can be broadly classified into societal, psychological, and innate explanations. However, explanations are not necessarily restricted to just one of these categories.

=== Societal ===
====Discrimination====
Schiebinger claims discrimination, both overt and covert, faced by women in STEM fields leads to fewer women in STEM fields.&lt;ref name="Schiebinger1999" /&gt;{{rp|33}} In the 1980s, researchers demonstrated a general evaluative bias against women.&lt;ref name=Swim1989&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swim|first1=J.|last2=Borgida|first2=E.|last3=Maruyama|first3=G.|last4=Myers|first4=D.G.|title=Joan McKay versus John McKay: Do gender stereotypes bias evaluations?|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1989|volume=105|issue=3|pages=409–429|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.105.3.409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 study, email requests were sent to meet to professors in doctoral programs at the top 260 U.S. universities. It was impossible to determine whether any particular individual in this study was exhibiting discrimination, since each participant only viewed a request from one potential graduate student. However, researchers found evidence for discrimination against ethnic minorities and women relative to Caucasian men.&lt;ref name=Milkman2012&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Milkman| first1=K.L|last2=Akinola| first2=M.|last3=Chugh|first3=D.| title=Temporal Distance and Discrimination: An Audit Study in Academia|journal=Psychological Science|year=2012| volume=23|issue=7|pages=710–717|doi=10.1177/0956797611434539|pmid=22614463}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, science faculty were sent the materials of student who was applying for a lab manager position at their university.&lt;ref name=Moss-Racusin2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moss-Racusin|first1=C.A.|last2=Dovidio| first2=J.F.|last3=Brescoll| first3=V.L.|last4=Graham| first4=M.| last5=Handelsman|first5=J.| title=Science faculty's subtle gender biases favor male students|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2012 |volume=109|issue=41|pages=16474–16479| doi=10.1073/pnas.1211286109|pmid=22988126| pmc=3478626}}&lt;/ref&gt; The materials were the same for each participant, but each application was randomly assigned either a male or a female name.

Stereotypes about what someone in a STEM field should look and act like may cause established members of these fields to overlook individuals who are highly competent.&lt;ref name=Wells1985&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wells|first1=Gary L.|title=The Conjunction Error and the Representativeness Heuristic|journal=Social Cognition| year=1985|volume=3|issue=3| pages=266–279|doi=10.1521/soco.1985.3.3.266}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stereotypical scientist or individual in another STEM profession is usually thought to be male.&lt;ref name=Good2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Good|first1=Jessica J.|last2=Woodzicka|first2=Julie A.|last3= Wingfield|first3= Lylan C.|title=The Effects of Gender Stereotypic and Counter-Stereotypic Textbook Images on Science Performance|journal=Journal of Social Psychology|year=2010|volume=150|issue=2|pages=132–147|doi=10.1080/00224540903366552|pmid=20397590}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in STEM fields may not fit individuals' conception of what a scientist, engineer, or mathematician "should" look like and may thus be overlooked or penalized. The Role Congruity Theory of Prejudice states that perceived incongruity between gender and a particular role or occupation can result in negative evaluations.&lt;ref name=Eagly2002&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eagly|first1=A.H.|last2=Karau|first2=S.J.|title=Role congruity theory of prejudice toward female leaders|journal=Psychological Review|year=2002| volume=109|issue=3| pages=573–598| doi=10.1037/0033-295x.109.3.573| pmid=12088246|citeseerx=10.1.1.460.315}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Garcia-Retamero2006&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garcia-Retamero|first1=R.|last2=Lopez-Zafra|first2=E.|title=Prejudice against Women in Male-congenial Environments: Perceptions of Gender Role Congruity in Leadership|journal=Sex Roles|year=2006|volume=55|issue=1–2|pages=51–61|doi=10.1007/s11199-006-9068-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ritter2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ritter|first1=B.A.|last2=Yoder|first2=J.D.|title=Gender Differences in Leader Emergence Persist Even for Dominant Women: An Updated Confirmation of Role Congruity Theory|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|year=2004|volume=28|issue=3|pages=187–193|doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.2004.00135.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, negative stereotypes about women's quantitative abilities may lead people to devalue their work or discourage these women from continuing in STEM fields.&lt;ref name=Miyake2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miyake|first1=A.|last2=Kost-Smith|first2=L.E.|last3=Finkelstein|first3=N.D.|last4 = Pollock|first4=S.J.|last5=Cohen|first5=G.L.|last6=Ito|first6=T.A.|title=Reducing the Gender Achievement Gap in College Science: A Classroom Study of Values Affirmation|journal=Science| year=2010|volume=330|issue=6008| pages=1234–1237| doi=10.1126/science.1195996 | pmid=21109670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both men and women who work in "nontraditional" occupations may encounter discrimination, but the forms and consequences of this discrimination are different. Individuals of a particular gender are often perceived to be better suited to particular careers or areas of study than those of the other gender.&lt;ref name=Gaucher2011&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Gaucher|first1=D.| last2=Friesen|first2=J.|last3=Kay| first3=A.C.|title=Evidence that gendered wording in job advertisements exists and sustains gender inequality|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2011|volume=101| issue=1|pages=109–128| doi=10.1037/a0022530|pmid=21381851}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lyness2006&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lyness|first1=K.S.|last2=Heilman|first2=M.E.|title=When fit is fundamental: Performance evaluations and promotions of upper-level female and male managers|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology| year=2006|volume=91| issue=4| pages=777–785| doi=10.1037/0021-9010.91.4.777|pmid=16834505|citeseerx=10.1.1.473.9525}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study found that job advertisements for male-dominated careers tended to use more agentic words (or words denoting agency, such as "leader" and "goal-oriented") associated with male stereotypes.&lt;ref name=Gaucher2011/&gt; Social Role Theory, proposed in 1991, states that men are expected to display agentic qualities and women to display communal qualities.&lt;ref name=Eagly1991&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eagly|first1=A.H.|last2=Wood|first2=W.|title=Explaining Sex Differences in Social Behavior: A Meta-Analytic Perspective|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=1991|volume=17|issue=3|pages=306–315| doi=10.1177/0146167291173011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These expectations can influence hiring decisions.&lt;ref name=Madera2009&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Madera|first1=J.M.|last2=Hebl|first2=M.R.|last3=Martin|first3=R.C.| title=Gender and letters of recommendation for academia: Agentic and communal differences|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|year=2009|volume=94|issue=6|pages=1591–1599|doi=10.1037/a0016539|pmid=19916666|citeseerx=10.1.1.471.9717}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 study found that women tended to be described in more communal terms and men in more agentic terms in letters of recommendation. These researchers also found that communal characteristics were negatively related to hiring decisions in academia.&lt;ref name=Madera2009/&gt;

Although women entering traditionally male professions face negative stereotypes suggesting that they are not "real" women, these stereotypes do not seem to deter women to the same degree that similar stereotypes may deter men from pursuing nontraditional professions. There is historical evidence that women flock to male-identified occupations once opportunities are available.&lt;ref&gt;Cohn, Samuel. 1985. ''The Process of Occupational Sex-Typing''. Philadelphia: Temple University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, examples of occupations changing from predominantly female to predominantly male are very rare in human history. The few existing cases—such as medicine—suggest that redefinition of the occupations as appropriately masculine is necessary before men will consider joining them.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenreich, Barbara, and Deirdre English. 1978. For Her Own Good: 100 Years of Expert Advice to Women. Garden City, N.Y.: Anchor Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although men in female-dominated occupations may contend with negative stereotypes about their masculinity, they may also experience certain benefits. In 1992 it was suggested that women in male-dominated occupations tended to hit a [[glass ceiling]]; while men in female-dominated occupations may hit a "glass escalator".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = Christine | year = 1992 | title = The Glass Escalator: Hidden Advantages for Men in the 'Female' Professions | journal = Social Problems | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 253–267 | jstor=3096961 | doi=10.1525/sp.1992.39.3.03x0034h}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the glass ceiling can make it difficult for women and minorities to reach the top of an occupation, the "glass escalator" allows men to excel in a profession that is female dominated.

====Black Sheep effect====
{{Main|Black sheep effect}}

The Black Sheep effect occurs when individuals are likely to evaluate members of their in-group more favorably than members of their out-group when those members are highly qualified.&lt;ref name=Eidelman2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eidelman|first1=S.|last2=Biernat|first2=M.|title=Derogating black sheep: Individual or group protection?|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology| year=2003|volume=39| issue=6|pages=602–609| doi=10.1016/s0022-1031(03)00042-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kerr1995&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kerr|first1=N.L.|last2=Hymes|first2=R.W.|last3=Anderson|first3=A.B.|last4=Weathers|first4=J.E.|title=Defendant-juror similarity and mock juror judgments|journal=Law and Human Behavior|year=1995|volume=19|issue=6|pages=545–567|doi=10.1007/bf01499374}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Marques2001&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marques|first1=J.|last2=Abrams|first2=D.|last3=Serodio|first3=R.G.|title=Being better by being right: Subjective group dynamics and derogation of in-group deviants when generic norms are undermined|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2001|volume=81|issue=3|pages=436–447|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.81.3.436}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=T.S.|last2=Hosch|first2=H.M.|title=An examination of jury verdicts for evidence of a similarity-leniency effect, an out-group punitiveness effect or a black sheep effect|journal=Law and Human Behavior|year=2004|volume=28|issue=5|pages=587–598|doi=10.1023/b:lahu.0000046436.36228.71}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when an individual's in-group members have average or below average qualities, he or she is likely to evaluate them much lower than out-group members with equivalent qualifications.&lt;ref name=Eidelman2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kerr1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=Marques2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor2004/&gt; This suggests that established women in STEM fields will be more likely than established men to help early career women who display sufficient qualifications. However, established women will be less likely than men to help early career women who display insufficient qualifications.

====Queen Bee effect====
The Queen Bee effect is similar to the Black Sheep effect but applies only to women. It explains why higher-status women, particularly in male-dominated professions, may actually be far less likely to help other women than their male colleagues might be.&lt;ref name=Cooper1997&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooper|first1=V.W.|title=Homophily or the Queen Bee Syndrome|journal=Small Group Research|year=1997|volume=28|issue=4|pages=483–499|doi=10.1177/1046496497284001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ellemers2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ellemers|first1=N.|last2=Van den Heuvel|first2=H.|last3=de Gilder|first3=D.|last4=Maass|first4=A.|last5=Bonvini|first5=A.|title=The underrepresentation of women in science: Differential commitment or the queen bee syndrome?|journal=British Journal of Social Psychology|year=2004|volume=43|issue=3|pages=315–338|doi=10.1348/0144666042037999|pmid=15479533|url=https://research.vu.nl/ws/files/1953519/Ellemers%20British%20Journal%20of%20Social%20Psychology%2043%202004%20u.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 study found that while doctoral students in a number of different disciplines did not exhibit any gender differences in work commitment or work satisfaction, faculty members at the same university believed that female students were less committed to their work than male students.&lt;ref name=Ellemers2004/&gt; What was particularly surprising was that these beliefs by faculty members were most strongly endorsed by female faculty members, rather than male faculty members.&lt;ref name=Ellemers2004/&gt; One potential explanation for this finding is that individual mobility for a member of a negatively stereotyped group is often accompanied by a social and psychological distancing of oneself from the group. This implies that successful women in traditionally male-dominated careers do not see their success as evidence that negative stereotypes about women's quantitative and analytical abilities are wrong, but rather as proof that they personally are exceptions to the rule.&lt;ref name=Ellemers2004/&gt; Thus, such women may actually play a role in perpetuating, rather than abolishing, these negative stereotypes.

====Mentorship====
In STEM fields, the support and encouragement of a mentor can make a lot of difference in women's decisions of whether or not to continue pursuing a career in their discipline&lt;ref name=Sonnert2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sonnert|first1=G.|last2=Fox|first2=M.F.|last3=Adkins|first3=K.|title=Undergraduate Women in Science and Engineering: Effects of Faculty, Fields, and Institutions Over Time|journal=Social Science Quarterly|year=2007|volume=88|issue=5|pages=1333–1356|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6237.2007.00505.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.452.4529}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stout2011&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Stout|first1=J.G.|last2=Dasgupta| first2=N.|last3=Hunsinger| first3=M.|last4=McManus| first4=M.A.|title=STEMing the tide: Using ingroup experts to inoculate women's self-concept in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2011|volume=100|issue=2|pages=255–270|doi=10.1037/a0021385|pmid=21142376}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be particularly true for younger individuals who may face many obstacles early on in their careers.&lt;ref name="Griffith2010"/&gt; Since these younger individuals often look to those who are more established in their discipline for help and guidance, the responsiveness and helpfulness of potential mentors is incredibly important.

====Lack of support====
Women in STEM may leave due to not being invited to professional meetings, the use of sexually discriminating standards against women, inflexible working conditions, the perceived need to hide pregnancies, and the struggle to balance family and work. Women in STEM fields that have children either need child care or to take a long leave of absence. When a [[nuclear family]] can not afford child care, typically it is the mother that gives up her career to stay at home with the children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/7-things-keeping-women-out-of-science-2013-10 |title=These Are The 7 Things Keeping Women Out of Science Careers |last=Welsh |first=Jennifier |date=16 Oct 2013 |website= |publisher=Business Insider |access-date=25 Nov 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due in part to women being paid statistically less in their careers. The man makes more money so the man goes to work and the woman gives up her career. Maternity leave is another issue women in STEM fields face. In the [[Maternity leave in the United States|U.S. maternity leave]] is required by The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/ |title=Family and Medical Leave Act |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=United States Department of Labor |access-date=25 Nov 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FMLA requires 12 weeks of unpaid leave annually for mothers of newborn or newly adopted children. This is one of the lowest levels of leave in the industrialized world. Unlike the United States, most countries have the right to paid time off.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} If a new mother does not have external financial support or savings, they may not be able to take their full maternity leave. Few companies allow men to take paternity leave and it may be shorter than women's maternity leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edd.ca.gov/Disability/PFL_Fathers.htm |title=Paid Family Leave – Fathers |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=State of California, Employment Development Department |access-date=25 Nov 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Longer paternity leaves for men could allow women to go back to work while their partners stay home with the children.

==== Harassment ====
In 1993 ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'' indicated that three-quarters of women students and residents were harassed at least once during their medical training.&lt;ref name="Schiebinger1999" /&gt;{{rp|51}}

==== Lack of role models ====
In engineering and science education, women made up almost 50 percent of non-tenure track lecturer and instructor jobs, but only 10 percent of tenured or tenure-track professors in 1996. In addition, the number of female department chairs in medical schools did not change from 1976 to 1996.&lt;ref name="Pell1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pell|first1=A N|title=Fixing the leaky pipeline: women scientists in academia|journal=Journal of Animal Science|volume=74|issue=11| year=1996|pages=2843–8|issn=0021-8812| doi=10.2527/1996.74112843x|pmid=8923199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, women who do make it to tenured or tenure-track positions may face the difficulties associated with holding a token status. They may lack support from colleagues and may face antagonism from peers and supervisors.&lt;ref name="Lips2008" /&gt; However, in 2014 a team of psychologists and economists conducted extensive analyses of national data and concluded that the state of women in STEM has changed greatly in the past two decades and any conclusions about their status based on data prior to 2000 are likely to be outdated. In general, they concluded that women had very sizable gains in academic science, including remuneration, promotion, and job satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Ceci2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ceci|first1=Stephen J.|last2=Ginther|first2=Donna K.|last3=Kahn|first3=Shulamit|last4=Williams|first4=Wendy M.|title=Women in Academic Science, A Changing Landscape |journal=Psychological Science in the Public Interest |volume=15 |issue=3 |year=2014 |pages=75–141 |issn=1529-1006 |doi=10.1177/1529100614541236|pmid=26172066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it has been posited that more female role models would encourage more women to enter fields dominated by men, research has indicated this is not the case,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1 = Cheryan|first1 = Sapna|last2 = Siy|first2 = John Oliver|last3 = Vichayapai|first3 = Marissa|last4 = Drury|first4 = Benjamin J.|last5 = Kim|first5 = Saenam|title = Do Female and Male Role Models Who Embody STEM Stereotypes Hinder Women's Anticipated Success in STEM?|journal = Social Psychological and Personality Science|volume = 2|issue = 6|pages = 656–664|doi = 10.1177/1948550611405218|year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that women's lack of interest in STEM fields may instead in part stem from stereotypes about employees and workplaces in STEM fields, to which stereotypes women are disproportionately responsive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/12/15/geeky_decor_puts_off_ladies/ |title=Ladies put off tech careers by sci-fi posters, Coke cans |last=Page |first=Lewis |date=15 December 2009 |accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/06/27/girls_into_tech_cracked_at_last_sorta/ |title=Trick-cyclist's claim: I have FOUND how to get GIRLS INTO TECH |last=Page |first=Lewis |date=27 June 2013 |accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Clustering and leaky pipeline ====
In the early 1980s Rossiter put forth the concept of "territorial segregation" or [[occupational segregation]], which is the idea that women "cluster" in certain fields of study.&lt;ref name="Schiebinger1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=Londa|title=Has Feminism Changed Science?|year=1999|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34}} For example, "women are more likely to teach and do research in the humanities and social sciences than in the natural sciences and engineering",&lt;ref name="Schiebinger1999"/&gt;{{rp|34}} and the majority of college women tend to choose majors such as psychology, education, English, performing arts, and nursing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ruchika Tulshyan |url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/03/02/top-10-college-majors-women-forbes-woman-leadership-education_slide_11.html |title=Top 10 College Majors For Women – 10: Liberal Arts and Sciences, General Studies, Humanities |publisher=Forbes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-07|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130123090031/http://www.forbes.com/2010/03/02/top-10-college-majors-women-forbes-woman-leadership-education_slide_11.html|archivedate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rossiter also used "hierarchical segregation" as an explanation for the low number of women in STEM fields.{{clarify|date=March 2018}} She describes "hierarchical segregation" as a decrease in the number of women as one "moves up the ladder of power and prestige."&lt;ref name="Schiebinger1999"/&gt;{{rp|33}} This is related to the [[STEM pipeline|leaky STEM pipeline]] concept. The metaphor of the leaky pipeline has been used to describe how women drop out of STEM fields at all stages of their careers. In the U.S., out of 2,000 high school aged persons, 1944 were enrolled in high school fall 2014.&lt;ref name="NCES d15_201.20"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d15/tables/dt15_201.20.asp |title=Table 201.20.

==== Lack of interest ====
A meta-analysis concluded that men prefer working with things and women prefer working with people. When interests were classified by [[Holland Codes|RIASEC type]] (Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional), men showed stronger Realistic and Investigative interests, and women showed stronger Artistic, Social, and Conventional interests. Sex differences favoring men were also found for more specific measures of engineering, science, and mathematics interests.&lt;ref name="Su2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Su|first1=Rong|last2=Rounds|first2=James|last3= Armstrong|first3= Patrick|title=Men and Things, Women and People: A Meta-Analysis of Sex Differences in Interests|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2009|volume=135|issue=6|pages=859–884|doi=10.1037/a0017364|pmid=19883140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 3-year interview study, Seymour and Hewitt (1997) found that perceptions that non-STEM academic majors offered better education options and better matched their interests was the most common (46%) reason provided by female students for switching majors from STEM areas to non-STEM areas. The second most frequently cited reason given for switching to non-STEM areas was a reported loss of interest in the women's chosen STEM majors. Additionally, 38% of female students who remained in STEM majors expressed concerns that there were other academic areas that might be a better fit for their interests.&lt;ref name="Seymour1997"&gt;{{cite book | last=Seymour | first=Elaine | title=Talking about leaving : why undergraduates leave the sciences | publisher=Westview Press | location=Boulder, CO, USA | year=1997 | isbn=978-0-8133-6642-5 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preston's (2004) survey of 1,688 individuals who had left sciences also showed that 30 percent of the women endorsed "other fields more interesting" as their reason for leaving.&lt;ref name="Preston2004"&gt;{{cite book | last=Preston | first=Anne | title=Leaving science : occupational exit from scientific careers | publisher=Russell Sage Foundation | location=New York | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-87154-694-4 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advanced math skills do not often result in a woman being interested in a STEM career. A [[Statistics Canada]] survey found that even young women of high mathematical ability are much less likely to enter a STEM field than young men of similar or even lesser ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==== Lack of confidence ====
Research has found that women steer away from STEM fields because they believe they are not qualified for them; the study suggested that this could be fixed by encouraging girls to participate in more mathematics classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/07/27/new_study_into_lack_of_women_in_tech_its_not_the_mens_fault/?mt=1437990843635 |title=New study into lack of women in Tech: It's NOT the men's fault |last=Page |first=Lewis |date=27 July 2015 |accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the factors behind girls' lack of confidence might be unqualified or ineffective teachers. Teachers' gendered perceptions on their students' capabilities can create an unbalanced learning environment and deter girls from pursuing further STEM education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barbara|first=Lohbeck, Annette{{!}}Grube, Dietmar{{!}}Moschner|date=2017|title=Academic Self-Concept and Causal Attributions for Success and Failure Amongst Elementary School Children.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1137235|journal=International Journal of Early Years Education|language=en|volume=25|issue=2|pages=|issn=0966-9760|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can also pass these stereotyped beliefs unto their students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keller|first=Carmen|date=2001-05-01|title=Effect of Teachers' Stereotyping on Students' Stereotyping of Mathematics as a Male Domain|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11964907|journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|volume=141|issue=2|pages=165–73|doi=10.1080/00224540109600544|pmid=11372563}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also shown that student-teacher interactions affect girls' engagement with STEM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Angela C.|date=2007|title=Unintended consequences: How science professors discourage women of color|journal=Science Education|language=en|volume=91|issue=5|pages=805–821|doi=10.1002/sce.20208|issn=0036-8326}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elstad|first=Eyvind|last2=Turmo|first2=Are|date=2009-08-06|title=The Influence of the Teacher's Sex on High School Students' Engagement and Achievement in Science|url=http://genderandset.open.ac.uk/index.php/genderandset/article/view/41|journal=International Journal of Gender, Science and Technology|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|issn=2040-0748}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":06"/&gt; Teachers often give boys more opportunity to figure out the solution to a problem by themselves while telling the girls to follow the rules.&lt;ref name="Schiebinger1999"/&gt;{{rp|56}} Teachers are also more likely to accept questions from boys while telling girls to wait for their turns.&lt;ref name="Pell1996"/&gt; This is partly due to gender expectations that boys will be active but that girls will be quiet and obedient.&lt;ref name="Lips2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lips|first=Hilary|title=Sex &amp; Gender: An Introduction Sixth Edition|year=2008|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 1985, girls were provided fewer laboratory opportunities than boys.&lt;ref name="Pell1996"/&gt; In middle and high school, science, mathematics, mechanics and computers courses are mainly taken by male students and also tend to be taught by male teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/50056290/ns/local_news-phoenix_az/t/popovich-girls-need-be-shown-path-success-through-stem-education/#.UL2VYYNfCSo |accessdate=December 5, 2012 |title=MSN &amp;#124; Outlook, Office, Skype, Bing, Breaking News, and Latest Videos }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lack of opportunities in STEM fields could lead to a loss of self-esteem in math and science abilities, and low self-esteem could prevent people from entering science and math fields.&lt;ref name="Pell1996"/&gt;

Out of STEM-intending students, 35% of women stated that their reason for leaving calculus was due to lack of understanding the material, while only 14% of men stated the same.&lt;ref name="Ellis2016" /&gt; The study reports that this difference in reason for leaving calculus is thought to develop from women's low level of confidence in their ability, and not actual skill. This study continues to establish that women and men have different levels of confidence in their ability and that confidence is related to how individual's performance in STEM fields.&lt;ref name="Ellis2016" /&gt; It was seen in another study that when men and women of equal math ability were asked to rate their own ability, women will rate their own ability at a much lower level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chipman|first=Susan|date=September 1992|title=Mathematics Anxiety and Science Careers Among Able College Women|url=|journal=Psychological Science |volume=3 |issue=5|pages=292–295|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs with the purpose to reduce anxiety in math or increase confidence have a positive impact on women continuing their pursuit of a career in the STEM field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kelly|first=Stephanie|date=October 2013|title=For Girls in STEM, Belonging, Not Brain Structure, Makes the Difference|url=|journal=Techniques: Connecting Education &amp; Careers|volume=88 |issue=7|pages=34–36|via=EBSCO Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only can the issue of confidence keep women from even entering STEM fields, but even women in upper-level courses with higher skill are more strongly affected by the stereotype that they (by nature) do not possess innate ability to succeed.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steinberg|first=Julia|date=November–December 2012|title=Calculus GPA and Math Identification as Moderators of Stereotype Threat in Highly Persistent Women|url=|journal=Basic &amp; Applied Social Psychology|volume=34 |issue=6|pages=534–543|via=EBSCO Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can cause a negative effect on confidence for women despite making it through courses designed to filter students out of the field.

====Stereotype threat====
Stereotype threat arises from the fear that one's actions will confirm a negative stereotype about one's in-group. This fear creates additional stress, consuming valuable cognitive resources and lowering task performance in the threatened domain.&lt;ref name=Schmader2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmader|first1=T.|last2=Johns|first2=M.|title=Converging evidence that stereotype threat reduces working memory capacity|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2003|volume=85|issue=3|pages=440–452|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.85.3.440|pmid=14498781}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Steele1995&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steele|first1=C.M.|last2=Aronson|first2=J.|title=Stereotype Threat and the Intellectual Test Performance of African Americans|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1995|volume=69|issue=5|pages=797–811|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.69.5.797|pmid=7473032}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Steele2002&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Steele|first1=C.M.|last2=Spencer|first2=S.J.|last3=Aronson|first3=J.|title=Contending with group image: The psychology of stereotype and social identity threat|year=2002|volume=34|pages=379–440|doi=10.1016/s0065-2601(02)80009-0|series=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|isbn=9780120152346}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals are susceptible to stereotype threat whenever they are assessed in a domain for which there is a perceived negative stereotype about a group to which they belong. Stereotype threat undermines the academic performance of women and girls in math and science, which leads to an underestimation of abilities in these subjects by standard measures of academic achievement.&lt;ref name=Spencer1999&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spencer|first1=S.J.|last2=Steele|first2=C.M.|last3=Quinn|first3=D.M.|title=Stereotype threat and women's math performance|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=1999|volume=35|issue=1|pages=4–28|doi=10.1006/jesp.1998.1373|citeseerx=10.1.1.370.3979}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Miyake2010/&gt; Individuals who identify strongly with a certain area (e.g., math) are more likely to have their performance in that area hampered by stereotype threat than those who identify less strongly with the area.&lt;ref name=Steele2002/&gt; This means that even highly motivated students from negatively stereotyped groups are likely to be adversely affected by stereotype threat and thus may come to disengage from the stereotyped domain.&lt;ref name=Steele2002/&gt;
Negative stereotypes about girls’ capabilities in mathematics and science drastically lower their performance in mathematics and science courses as well as their interest in pursuing a STEM career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christine-bork/women-in-science_b_1327752.html |title=STEM Fields: Where Are the Women? |last=Bork |first=Christine |date= 2012-03-08|website= |publisher=[[Huffington Post]] |access-date=25 Nov 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have found that gender differences in performance disappear if students are told that there are no gender differences on a particular mathematics test.&lt;ref name=Spencer1999/&gt; This indicates that the learning environment can greatly impact success in a course.

Stereotype threat has been criticized on a theoretical basis.&lt;ref name=jensen&gt;Arthur Robert Jensen "The g factor: the science of mental ability" 1998 {{ISBN|0-275-96103-6}}, Praeger Publishers, 88 Post Road West, Westport, CT 06881, pages 513–515: "the phenomenon of stereotype threat can be explained in terms of a more general construct, test anxiety, which has been studied since the early days of psychometrics. Test anxiety tends to lower performance levels on tests in proportion to the degree of complexity and the amount of mental effort they require of the subject. The relatively greater effect of test anxiety in the black
samples, who had somewhat lower SAT scores, than the white subjects in the Stanford experiments constitutes an example of the Yerkes-Dodson law ... by conducting the same type of experiment using exclusively white (or black)
subjects, divided into lower- and higher-ability groups, it might be shown that 
the phenomenon attributed to stereotype threat has nothing to do with race as
such, but results from the interaction of ability level with test anxiety as a
function of test complexity."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stoet2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Stoet | first1 = G. | last2 = Geary | first2 = D.

A study&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; was done to determine how stereotype threat and math identification can affect women who were majoring in a STEM related field. There were three different situations, designed to test the impact of stereotype on performance in math. One group of women were informed that men had previously out-performed women on the same calculus test they were about to take. The next group was told men and women had performed at the same level. The last group was told nothing about how men had performed and there was no mention of gender before taking their test. Out of these situations, women performed at their best scores when there was no mention of gender. The worst scores were from the situation where women were told that men had performed better than women. For women to pursue the male-dominated field of STEM, previous research shows that they must have more confidence in math/science ability.&lt;ref name="Ellis2016" /&gt;

===Innate versus learned skill===

Some studies propose the explanation that STEM fields (and especially fields like physics, math and philosophy) are considered by both teachers and students to require more innate talent than skills that can be learned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theconversation.com/beliefs-about-innate-talent-may-dissuade-students-from-stem-42967 |title=Beliefs about innate talent may dissuade students from STEM |last=Miller |first=David |date=9 Jun 2015 |website= |publisher=The Conversation |access-date=25 Nov 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with a tendency to view women as having less of the required innate abilities, researchers propose this can result in assessing women as less qualified for STEM positions. In a study done by Ellis, Fosdick and Rasmussen, it was concluded that without strong skills in calculus, women cannot perform as well as their male counterparts in any field of STEM, which leads to the fewer women pursuing a career in these fields.&lt;ref name="Ellis2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ellis|first1=Jessica|last2=Fosdick|first2=Bailey K.|last3=Rasmussen|first3=Chris|title=Women 1.5 Times More Likely to Leave STEM Pipeline after Calculus Compared to Men: Lack of Mathematical Confidence a Potential Culprit|journal=PLOS One|volume=11|issue=7|year=2016|pages=1–14|issn=1932-6203|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0157447|pmid=27410262|pmc=4943602}}&lt;/ref&gt; A high percentage of women that do pursue a career in STEM do not continue on this pathway after taking Calculus I, which was found to be a class that weeds out students from the STEM pathway.&lt;ref name="Ellis2016" /&gt;

There have been several controversial statements about innate ability and success in STEM. A few notable examples include [[Lawrence Summers]], former president of [[Harvard University]] who suggested cognitive ability at high end positions could cause a population difference. Summers later stepped down as president.&lt;ref name="harvard2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.president.harvard.edu/speeches/2005/nber.html |title=Archive of: Remarks at NBER Conference on Diversifying the Science &amp; Engineering Workforce |accessdate=2008-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080130023006/http://www.president.harvard.edu/speeches/2005/nber.html |archivedate=January 30, 2008 |df= }}. January 14, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Former Google engineer, James Damore, wrote a memo entitled [[Google's Ideological Echo Chamber]] suggesting that differences in trait distributions between men and women was a reason for gender imbalance in STEM. The memo stated that [[affirmative action]] to reduce the gap could discriminate against highly qualified male candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/evzjww/here-are-the-citations-for-the-anti-diversity-manifesto-circulating-at-google |title=Here Are the Citations for the Anti-Diversity Manifesto Circulating at Google |last1=Matsakis |first1=Louise | last2=Koebler |first2=Jason | last3=Emerson |first3=Sarah  |date=7 Aug 2017 |website= |publisher=Vice |access-date=25 Nov 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damore was fired for sending out this memo.

== Strategies for increasing representation of women ==
[[File:15208-event-CMS Girls Engineering Camp-6655 (18682448435).jpg|thumb|The CMS Girls Engineering Camp at [[Texas A&amp;M University–Commerce]] in June 2015]]

There are a multitude of factors that may explain the low representation of women in STEM careers. [[Anne-Marie Slaughter]], the first woman to hold the position of Director of Policy Planning for the [[United States Department of State]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.princeton.edu/slaughter | title=Anne-Marie Slaughter  |website=Princeton University}}&lt;/ref&gt; has recently suggested some strategies to the corporate and political environment to support women to fulfill to the best of their abilities the many roles and responsibilities that they undertake.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/opinion/letters/article/1225099--finding-a-work-life-balance Finding a work-life-balance], ''[[Toronto Star]]'', 11 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The academic and research environment for women may benefit by applying some of the suggestions she has made to help women excel, while maintaining a work-life balance.

===Social-psychological interventions===
A number of researchers have tested interventions to alleviate stereotype threat for women in situations where their math and science skills are being evaluated. The hope is that by combating stereotype threat, these interventions will boost women's performance, encouraging a greater number of them to persist in STEM careers.

One simple intervention is simply educating individuals about the existence of stereotype threat. Researchers found that women who were taught about stereotype threat and how it could negatively impact women's performance in math performed as well as men on a math test, even when stereotype threat was induced. These women also performed better than women who were not taught about stereotype threat before they took the math test.&lt;ref name=Johns2005&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johns|first1=Michael|last2=Schmader|first2=Toni|last3= Martens|first3= Andy|title=Knowing Is Half the Battle: Teaching Stereotype Threat as a Means of Improving Women's Math Performance|journal=Psychological Science|year=2005|volume=16|issue=3|pages=175–179|doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2005.00799.x|pmid=15733195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Role models====
One of the proposed methods for alleviating stereotype threat is through introducing role models. One study found that women who took a math test that was administered by a female experimenter did not suffer a drop in performance when compared to women whose test was administered by a male experimenter.&lt;ref name=Marx2002&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marx|first1=D.M.|last2=Roman|first2=J.S.|title=Female role models: Protecting women's math performance|journal=Personality and Social Bulletin|year=2002|volume=28|issue=9|pages=1183–1193|doi=10.1177/01461672022812004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, these researchers found that it was not the physical presence of the female experimenter but rather learning about her apparent competence in math that buffered participants against stereotype threat.&lt;ref name=Marx2002 /&gt; 
The findings of another study suggest that role models do not necessarily have to be individuals with authority or high status, but can also be drawn from peer groups. This study found that girls in same-gender groups performed better on a task that measured math skills than girls in mixed-gender groups.&lt;ref name=Huguet2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huguet|first1=P.|last2=Regner|first2=I.|title=Stereotype threat among schoolgirls in quasi-ordinary classroom circumstances|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|year=2007|volume=99|issue=3|pages=545–560|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.99.3.545}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to the fact that girls in the same-gender groups had greater access to positive role models, in the form of their female classmates who excelled in math, than girls in mixed-gender groups.&lt;ref name=Huguet2007 /&gt; 
Similarly, another experiment showed that making groups achievements salient helped buffer women against stereotype threat. Female participants who read about successful women, even though these successes were not directly related to performance in math, performed better on a subsequent math test than participants who read about successful corporations rather than successful women.&lt;ref name=McIntyre2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McIntyre|first1=R.B.|last2=Paulson|first2=R.M.|last3= Lord|first3= C.G.|title=Alleviating women's mathematics stereotype threat through salience of group achievements|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2003|volume=39|issue=1|pages=83–90|doi=10.1016/s0022-1031(02)00513-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A study investigating the role of textbook images on science performance found that women demonstrated better comprehension of a passage from a chemistry lesson when the text was accompanied by a counter-stereotypic image (i.e., of a female scientist) than when the text was accompanied by a stereotypic image (i.e., of a male scientist).&lt;ref name=Good2010 /&gt;
Other scholars distinguish between the challenges of both recruitment and retention in increasing women's participation in STEM fields. These researchers suggest that although both female and male role models can be effective in recruiting women to STEM fields, female role models are more effective at promoting the retention of women in these fields.&lt;ref name=Drury2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drury|first1=Benjamin J.|last2=Siy|first2=John Oliver|last3= Cheryan|first3= Sapna|title=When Do Female Role Models Benefit Women? The Importance of Differentiating Recruitment From Retention in STEM|journal=Psychological Inquiry|year=2011|volume=22|issue=4|pages=265–269|doi=10.1080/1047840x.2011.620935}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female teachers can also act as role models for young girls. Reports have shown that the presence of female teachers positively influences girls' perceptions of STEM and increases their interest in STEM careers.&lt;ref name=":06"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stearns|first=Elizabeth|last2=Bottía|first2=Martha Cecilia|last3=Davalos|first3=Eleonora|last4=Mickelson|first4=Roslyn Arlin|last5=Moller|first5=Stephanie|last6=Valentino|first6=Lauren|date=2016-02-01|title=Demographic Characteristics of High School Math and Science Teachers and Girls' Success in STEM|url=https://academic.oup.com/socpro/article/63/1/87/1845557|journal=Social Problems|language=en|volume=63|issue=1|pages=87–110|doi=10.1093/socpro/spv027|issn=0037-7791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Self-affirmation====
Researchers have investigated the usefulness of self-affirmation in alleviating stereotype threat. One study found that women who affirmed a personal value prior to experiencing stereotype threat performed as well on a math test as men and as women who did not experience stereotype threat.&lt;ref name=Martens2006&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martens|first1=A.|last2=Johns|first2=M.|last3= Greenberg|first3= J.|last4=Schimel|first4=J.|title=Combating stereotype threat: The effect of self-affirmation on women's intellectual performance|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2006|volume=42|issue=2|pages=236–243|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2005.04.010|hdl=10092/507}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent study found that a short writing exercise in which college students, who were enrolled in an introductory physics course, wrote about their most important values substantially decreased the gender performance gap and boosted women's grades.&lt;ref name=Miyake2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miyake|first1=A.|last2=Kost-Smith|first2=L.E.|last3= Finkelstein|first3= N.D.|last4=Pollock|first4=S.J.|last5=Cohen|first5=G.L.|last6=Ito|first6=T.A.|title=Reducing the Gender Achievement Gap in College Science: A Classroom Study of Values Affirmation|journal=Science|year=2010|volume=330|issue=6008|pages=1234–1237|doi=10.1126/science.1195996|pmid=21109670}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars believe that the effectiveness of such values-affirmation exercises is their ability to help individuals view themselves as complex individuals, rather than through the lens of a harmful stereotype. Supporting this hypothesis, another study found that women who were encouraged to draw self-concept maps with many nodes did not experience a performance decrease on a math test.&lt;ref name=Gresky2005&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gresky|first1=D.M.|last2=Eyck|first2=L.L.T.|last3= Lord|first3= C.G.|last4=McIntyre|first4=R.B.|title=Effects of salient multiple identities on women's performance under mathematics stereotype threat|journal=Sex Roles|year=2005|volume=53|issue=9–10|pages=703–716|doi=10.1007/s11199-005-7735-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, women who did not draw self-concept maps or only drew maps with a few nodes did perform significantly worse than men on the math test.&lt;ref name=Gresky2005 /&gt; The effect of these maps with many nodes was to remind women of their "multiple roles and identities," that were unrelated to, and would thus not be harmed by, their performance on the math test.&lt;ref name=Gresky2005 /&gt;

=== Organized efforts ===
Organizations such as [[Girls Who Code]], StemBox,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2218287/stembox-girls-in-stem/|title=Introducing StemBox, Birchbox's Super Smart Little Sister|access-date=2015-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blossom, Engineer Girl, [http://womanity.org/programs/afghanistan/ Girls Can Code] in Afghanistan, [http://robotixedu.com/indian-girls-code/ @IndianGirlsCode], and Kode with Klossy (spearheaded by supermodel [[Karlie Kloss]]) aim to encourage women and girls to explore male-dominated STEM fields. Many of these organizations offer summer programs and scholarships to girls interested in STEM fields. The U.S. government has funded similar endeavors; the Department of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs created TechGirls and TechWomen, exchange programs which teach Middle Eastern and North African girls and women skills valuable in STEM fields and encourage them to pursue STEM careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2013/03/205866.htm|title=Advancing the Status of Women and Girls Around the World|access-date=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the [https://unesco.usmission.gov/teachher/ TeachHer Initiative], spearheaded by UNESCO, Costa Rican First Lady, [[Mercedes Peñas Domingo]], and [[Dr. Jill Biden]] which aims to close the gender gap in STEAM curricula and careers. The Initiative also emphasizes the importance of after school activities and clubs for girls.&lt;ref name=":06"/&gt;
