The '''2008 Zimbabwean cholera outbreak''' was an epidemic of [[cholera]] affecting much of Zimbabwe from August 2008 until June 2009. The outbreak began in [[Chitungwiza]] in [[Mashonaland East Province]] in August 2008, then spread throughout the country so that by December 2008, cases were being reported in all 10 [[Zimbabwe#Administrative divisions|provinces]].&lt;ref name=ICDDRB&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ahmed S |author2=Bardhan PK |author3=Mazumder RN |author4=Khan AI |author5=Islam MS |author6=Siddique AK |author7=Cravioto A |title=The 2008 Cholera Epidemic in Zimbabwe: Experience of the icddr,b Team in the Field |journal=Journal of Health, Population, and Nutrition |date=October 2011 |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=541–546 |pmc=3225117 |pmid=22106761}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2008, The [[Government of Zimbabwe|Zimbabwean government]] declared the outbreak a [[national emergency]] and requested [[international aid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/12/04/zimbabwe.cholera.emergency/ |accessdate=26 May 2016 |title=Zimbabwe declares cholera national emergency |date=9 December 2008 |publisher=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outbreak peaked in January 2009 with 8,500 cases reported per week.&lt;ref name=WHOZim/&gt; Cholera cases from this outbreak were also reported in neighboring countries [[South Africa]], [[Malawi]], [[Botswana]], [[Mozambique]], and [[Zambia]].&lt;ref name=WHOZim/&gt; With the help of international agencies, the outbreak was controlled, and by July 2009, after no cases had been reported for several weeks, the [[Ministry of Health and Child Welfare (Zimbabwe)|Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Welfare]] declared the outbreak over.&lt;ref name=WHOZim/&gt; In total, 98,596 cases of cholera and 4,369 deaths were reported, making this the largest outbreak of cholera ever recorded in Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name=WHOZim&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/cholera/countries/ZimbabweCountryProfileOct2009.pdf |accessdate=26 May 2016 |title=Cholera Country Profile: Zimbabwe |date=31 October 2009 |publisher=World Health Organization - Global Task Force on Cholera Control}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large scale and severity of the outbreak has been attributed to poor sanitation, limited access to healthcare, and insufficient healthcare infrastructure throughout Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name=WHOZim/&gt;&lt;ref name=MSF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news-stories/special-report/beyond-cholera-zimbabwes-worsening-crisis |accessdate=26 May 2016 |title=Beyond Cholera: Zimbabwe's Worsening Crisis |publisher=[[Medecins Sans Frontieres]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cause ==
[[File:Kuwadzana open drain.JPG|250px|thumb|left|An open drain in [[Kuwadzana]] township, [[Harare]] in 2004. By 2008 drains such as this were carrying sewage from burst sewage pipes and [[feces]] washed out of the neighbouring areas as the urban sanitation system collapsed. This contributed to the rapid spread of the cholera outbreak.]]
The 2008 cholera outbreak was caused by widespread infection with the bacterium ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' which is spread through water contaminated with the feces of infected individuals. Cholera had been seen in Zimbabwe in the decade leading up to the 2008 outbreak.&lt;ref name=WHOZim/&gt; However, the severity of the 2008 has been attributed to a combination of societal factors including poor access to [[health care]] and poor [[Health system|health care infrastructure]], high [[HIV]] prevalence, [[political instability]], food shortages, high levels of [[displaced person|displaced people]], and lack of access to [[potable water|safe water]].&lt;ref name=MSF/&gt; In 2008, Zimbabwe was suffering from an [[Economy of Zimbabwe#2000.E2.80.932009|economic crisis]] and [[Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe|hyperinflation]] which led to shortages of food and other basic goods, disruption of public services, and a large number of refugees moving within the country and to neighboring countries.&lt;ref name=MSF/&gt;&lt;ref name=PHR&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Physicians for Human Rights |title=Health in Ruins: A Man-Made Disaster in Zimbabwe |url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/PHR_Reports/health-in-ruins-zim-full-2009.pdf |accessdate=28 February 2012 |date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Water and Sanitation--&gt;  
One of the major contributing factors to the outbreak was the breakdown of the municipal [[water supply]], [[sanitation]], and [[Waste management|waste collection]] programs throughout the country, but especially in urban areas.&lt;ref name=collapse/&gt; With this, the onset of the rainy season led to cholera-contaminated [[faeces]] being washed into water sources, in particular public drains,&lt;ref name=storm/&gt;&lt;ref name=rain/&gt; as well as providing readily available but contaminated water.&lt;ref name=coping&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/zimbabwe-feature-261108?opendocument|title=Zimbabwe: coping with the cholera outbreak|date=26 November 2008|publisher=|accessdate=3 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a shortage of purification chemicals, such as chlorine, the capital city of [[Harare]] stopped receiving piped water on 1 December 2008.&lt;ref name=mobilize&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zwnews.net/issuefull.cfm?ArticleID=19803 |title=United Nations, Red Cross mobilize cholera relief for Zimbabwe |date=3 Dec 2008 |publisher=VOA news |accessdate=2008-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208024523/http://www.zwnews.net/issuefull.cfm?ArticleID=19803 |archivedate=8 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By that date, many suburbs had not had any water supply for much longer.&lt;ref name=3000dead/&gt; On 4 December 2008, the Zimbabwe deputy minister for water and infrastructural development stated that there were only sufficient treatment chemicals in stock nationally for 12 weeks supply.&lt;ref name=appeal&gt;{{cite news|url=http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnL4384569.html|title=Zimbabwe appeals for donor help on cholera|date=4 December 2008|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=4 December 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206151851/http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnL4384569.html|archive-date=6 December 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collapse of these systems was blamed on the then-current [[Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe|economic crisis]];&lt;ref name="Capital lacks clean water, cholera kills hundreds in Zimbabwe"/&gt;&lt;ref name=oxfam&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e8d897e4-c0db-11dd-b0a8-000077b07658.html|title=Cholera death rate multiplies in Zimbabwe's economic crisis|date=3 December 2008|publisher=Financial Times (UK)|accessdate=4 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  many households cannot afford fuel to boil water.&lt;ref name=oxfam2/&gt; According to [[Médecins Sans Frontières]], the spread of cholera from urban to rural areas from December 2008 onwards was due to infected city-dwellers visiting their families' rural homes for Christmas and the burial of infected city-dwellers in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cholera moves to rural Zimbabwe|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7844417.stm|date=22 January 2009|publisher=BBC|accessdate=22 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Health System Collapse--&gt;

The 2008 cholera epidemic in Zimbabwe had an unusually high fatality rate; Oxfam attributed the high mortality to a population "seriously weakened by hunger, HIV and AIDS".&lt;ref name=oxfam2/&gt; A major contributing factor to the severity of the outbreak was the collapse of Zimbabwe's public health system, declared a national emergency on 4 December 2008.&lt;ref name=emergency&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hsW9YNn1roEp0rzjeGSJo0pKcj2A|title=Zimbabwe declares cholera outbreak a national emergency|date=4 December 2008|publisher=AFP|accessdate=4 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of November 2008, three of Zimbabwe's four major hospitals had shut down, along with the Zimbabwe Medical School, and the fourth major hospital had two wards and no operating theatres working.&lt;ref name=hospitals&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7714892.stm|title=The death throes of Harare's hospitals|date=7 November 2008|publisher=BBC |accessdate=3 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hospitals2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.radiovop.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=4452&amp;Itemid=755|title=Zimbabwe's Medical School Closes|date=19 November 2008|publisher=Radio VOP|accessdate=3 December 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206141027/http://www.radiovop.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=4452&amp;Itemid=755|archive-date=6 December 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zimbabwean hospitals still open by December 2008 lacked medicines and staff. Due to [[Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe|hyperinflation]], hospitals were not able to buy basic drugs and medicines, and the resources of even internationally funded emergency clinics were stretched.&lt;ref name=coping/&gt; The ongoing political and economic crisis contributed to the emigration of doctors and people with medical knowledge.&lt;ref name="Zimbabwe cholera deaths near 500 "&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7760088.stm|title=Zimbabwe cholera deaths near 500 |date=2 December 2008|publisher=BBC |accessdate=2 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some victims were travelling to [[Botswana]] and other neighbouring countries for treatment.&lt;ref name="Capital lacks clean water, cholera kills hundreds in Zimbabwe"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/12/01/zimbabwe.cholera/index.html?eref=rss_world|title=Capital lacks clean water, cholera kills hundreds in Zimbabwe|date=1 December 2008|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
After the 2008 epidemic was declared a national emergency, the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare (MOHCW) collaborated with several other departments, governments, and non-governmental organizations to create a Cholera Command and Control Centre. This Centre works to prevent cholera outbreaks in Zimbabwe by addressing broader societal factors that could contribute to cholera outbreaks, such as water sanitation and poor hygiene habits.&lt;ref name=socialdeterminants /&gt;

== Politicisation ==
Because of its well-organised health care system and effective water sanitation facilities, [[Rita R. Colwell]] of the [[James Baker Institute]] says Zimbabwe was historically one of the African countries least affected by cholera.&lt;ref name ="bakerinstitute"/&gt; A news commentary in ''[[The Lancet]]'' said that, under President [[Robert Mugabe]], the country's health programs were negatively impacted, resulting in diminished health care for those infected with cholera.&lt;ref name=thelancet /&gt;  According to a draft paper from the WHO's World Conference on Social Determinants in Health, there were fewer health workers in the villages than in urban areas, which hindered early detection and isolation of cholera cases.&lt;ref name=socialdeterminants&gt;{{cite web|title=Intersectoral Actions in response to cholera in Zimbabwe: From emergency response to institution building|url=http://www.who.int/sdhconference/resources/draft_background_paper23_zimbabwe.pdf |format=PDF|work=World Conference on Social Determinants of Health |publisher= World Health Organization |accessdate=30 November 2013 |date= 19–21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A news commentator writing for ''The Lancet'', Andrew Meldrum, said that President Mugabe’s Youth Militia threatened health professionals that provided medical treatment to political opponents.&lt;ref name="thelancet"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Meldrum A |title=Zimbabwe's health-care system struggles on |journal=Lancet |volume=371 |issue=9618 |pages=1059–60 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18380032 |url= http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(08)60468-7/fulltext. |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(08)60468-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that, combined with decreasing education standards, low pay, and a shortage of medical supplies like latex gloves, this led doctors to leave Zimbabwe at an alarming rate.&lt;ref name="thelancet" /&gt; According to Douglas Gwatidzo, the chairman of the Zimbabwe Doctors for Human Rights group, Zimbabwe had only one doctor assigned to a group of 12,000 citizens.&lt;ref name="thelancet" /&gt; Doctors in Zimbabwe fill only 25% of the medical posts available, and even fewer specialist positions are taken.&lt;ref name="thelancet" /&gt; According to Meldrum, this poses serious challenges to health care for diseases like HIV/AIDS and cholera. Similarly, the effects of cholera are exacerbated without proper nutrition, and Zimbabwe has faced food shortages for the last several years.&lt;ref name="thelancet" /&gt;

Cholera and malnutrition keep children out of school – a serious social consequence of the outbreak.  Rachel Pound, the director of [[Save the Children]] in Zimbabwe, said that attending school may be dangerous in Zimbabwe, instead of providing a ladder for self-improvement.

According to Meldrum, Zimbabwe's high inflation left the country with a lack of financial resources, resulting in a shortage of ambulances and pharmaceutical drugs.&lt;ref name="thelancet" /&gt;  According to Eric Pruyt of the Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands, this was exacerbated by a shortage of international aid, as Zimbabwe's government didn't acknowledge the epidemic and accept aid until the disease was widespread.&lt;ref name="scholar.google"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Pruyt, Eric |title= Cholera in Zimbabwe |url= http://www.systemdynamics.org/conferences/2009/proceed/papers/P1357.pdf |format= PDF |date= 26 July 2009 |publisher= Delft University of Technology |journal=  |access-date= 30 November 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131020151002/http://www.systemdynamics.org/conferences/2009/proceed/papers/P1357.pdf |archive-date= 20 October 2013 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not contained or prevented from spreading.

According to an editorial by Daniel J Ncayiyana in the ''South African Medical Journal'', President Mugabe blamed the U.S. and the U.K. for the cholera outbreak, saying that they sent the disease so that they have a reason to credibly remove him from the presidency.&lt;ref name="scielo"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ncayiyana DJ |title=The Zimbabwe mayhem--how many people must die for the neighbours to act? |journal=S.

In the meantime, a senior [[ZANU-PF]] official argued that the government and party leadership was more focussed on the forthcoming ZANU-PF conference than on the current crisis.&lt;ref name=conference&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iwpr.net/?p=zim&amp;s=f&amp;o=348282&amp;apc_state=henh|title=Mugabe Allies Squash Succession Rumours|date=4 December 2008|publisher=institute for war &amp; peace reporting|accessdate=7 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 December 2008, President Robert Mugabe made a speech screened on national television in which he said:

{{quote|I am happy to say our doctors have been assisted by others and WHO (the World Health Organization)... so now that there is no cholera...

The law formerly permitted an [[abortion]] to be performed under some limited circumstances, but, in 1998, all exceptions were removed when a new [[abortion law]] went into effect.&lt;ref name="unpd"&gt;United Nations Population Division. (2002). [https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion Abortion Policies: A Global Review]. Retrieved July 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Salvadoran abortion law==
[[El Salvador]]'s 1956 [[Penal Code]] contained no explicit exception to its prohibition of abortion, although, under accepted principles of [[criminal law]], one could be justified if necessary to preserve the life of the pregnant woman. In response to the fact that the practice of illegal abortion was common, and was a major contributor to the rate of [[maternal mortality]], the Salvadoran government chose to expand the cases in which abortion was permitted.&lt;ref name="unpd" /&gt;

Under the new Penal Code of 1973, an abortion could be legally allowed under three major conditions: if the [[pregnancy|pregnant]] woman's life was endangered and abortion was the only means to preserve it, if her pregnancy had resulted from [[rape]] or [[statutory rape]], or if a serious [[congenital disorder]] was detected in the [[fetus]]. An abortion caused on part of the woman's negligence was exempted from prosecution, and the government also provided reduced penalties for a woman of good standing if she had consented to an illegal abortion, or [[self-induced abortion|self-induced]] one, in the interest of protecting her [[reputation]].&lt;ref name="unpd" /&gt;

==Reform process and current law==
Proposals to eliminate the exceptions to the general prohibition against abortion started to come before the country's [[Legislative Assembly of El Salvador|Legislative Assembly]] in 1992. One bill would have resulted in the investigation of medical clinics suspected of providing abortion; as a result of a 1993 study, overseen by a politician affiliated with the [[Christian Democratic Party (El Salvador)|Christian Democratic Party]], several health care workers were arrested. Another proposal in 1993, which was supported by the Archbishop of [[San Salvador]] and the Say Yes to Life Foundation (a [[pro-life]] group), would have made December 28, a traditional [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] feast day known as the [[Day of the Innocents#Feast days|Day of the Innocents]], the "Day of the Unborn".&lt;ref name="cfrr"&gt;Center for Reproductive Rights. (2001). [http://www.crlp.org/pub_bo_perse.htmlPersecuted: Political Process and Abortion Legislation in El Salvador]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Retrieved March 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the [[Nationalist Republican Alliance]] (ARENA) submitted a draft bill, designed to amend the Penal Code to withdraw all grounds under which abortion was then permitted. On April 25, 1997, the Legislative Assembly voted 61 out of 84 to approve this modification to the Code.&lt;ref name="cfrr" /&gt;

On April 20, 1998, the new Penal Code was enacted, removing the exceptions that had been instituted in 1973, including the provision for the pregnant woman's life. Under this Code, a person who performs an abortion with the woman's consent, or a woman who self-induces or consents to someone else inducing her abortion, can be imprisoned for two to eight years. A person who performs an abortion to which the woman has not consented can be sentenced to four to ten years in jail; if the person is a physician, pharmacist, or other health care worker, he or she is instead subject to between six and 12 years.&lt;ref name="unpd" /&gt;

El Salvador also amended its Constitution in January 1999 to recognize human life from the moment of [[fertilisation|conception]].&lt;ref name="cfrr" /&gt;

==Objections to the law==
The organizations [[Ipas (organization)|IPAS]], MADRE, and Women's Link Worldwide submitted a report to the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] in which they contended that the El Salvadoran law against abortion violates several treaties that El Salvador has ratified: the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR); the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR); the [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] (CERD); the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (CRC); and the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW).&lt;ref name="unreport1"&gt;

They point out that "The [[Constitution of El Salvador]] protects every person’s right to life, liberty, security of person, and social justice. Furthermore it establishes that all persons are equal before the law and there can be no restrictions based on race, gender or religion. El Salvador’s criminal anti-abortion legislation violates all of these constitutional and human rights established in the previously mentions international conventions."&lt;ref name="unreport1"/&gt;

==Continued practice of abortion in El Salvador==
[[Unsafe abortion]] is a serious public health problem and the second direct cause of [[maternal mortality]] in El Salvador. In 1994, the third-most-prevalent cause of mortality among adolescent girls was pregnancy and postpartum complications. Some of the girls arrested for trying to have [[abortion]]s are as young as ten. It's a drain on resources in a country where health care expenditures in 1997 were $24 per person per year.&lt;ref name=pers1&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The criminalization of abortion has extremely serious consequences for women’s lives and health: abortions performed under dangerous conditions; high mortality and morbidity rates; and a lack of reliable studies that could help health services provide better care to their clients, including women who have had abortions in unsafe conditions. This situation is further exacerbated by the persecution of women by the Salvadoran justice and health systems.&lt;ref name=pers1/&gt; In some cases, therapeutic abortions are performed by physicians in medical settings, and justified as other procedures, e.g. a [[laparotomy]] (abdominal incision) rather than an abortion.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

===Miscarriages===
Many low-income women who have a miscarriage or a stillbirth are often prosecuted. Oftentimes they are reported by medical personnel to the police and subsequently arrested in the hospital. They are wrongly accused of abortion or homicide and sentenced up to 40 years in prison. Currently, there are 17 women in prison for pregnancy related complications that have not had due process while being prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnestyusa.org/sites/default/files/el_salvador_report_-_on_the_brink_of_death.pdf],&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abortion methods in El Salvador===
Doctors in El Salvador report that women seeking abortions use a wide variety of methods: clothes hangers, metal rods, high doses of contraceptives, fertilizers, gastritis remedies, soapy water,  and caustic fluids (such as battery acid). The most common methods are pills, such as [[Cytotec]] and [[potassium permanganate]] (inserted vaginally); catheters to inject soapy water or caustic liquids; rods of any type of material to penetrate the [[uterus]]; injections of unknown solutions; or a combination of abortion methods, such as pills, a [[catheter]], and an injection or pills and a metal rod.&lt;ref name=pers2&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Using pills, catheters, injections and rods can kill a woman or injure her permanently. In addition to having only dangerous methods at their disposal, the women being tried for abortion were forced to self-induce abortions in their homes, in unsanitary conditions or in clandestine clinics that could not guarantee adequate procedures. If complications arise due to the conditions in which the abortion was practiced, they are then at risk of being reported by hospital staff who treat the complications. All of this highlights the risk to life, health, security of person and liberty that terminating an unwanted pregnancy represents for young, low-income women in El Salvador.&lt;ref name=pers2/&gt;

===Prosecutions===
A report in 2001 revealed that, after the new Penal Code went into effect in 1998, 69 cases of illegal abortions had been prosecuted. In 23 of those cases, the [[women]] involved had been turned over to the authorities by health care workers when they arrived at the hospital seeking treatment after an unsafe abortion. Most abortions had been self-induced, through the use of [[clothes hanger]]s, or by the ingestion of harmful amounts of [[hormonal contraception]] pills, [[antacid]]s, or [[misoprostol]] pills.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Reproductive Rights. (November 30, 2001). "[http://www.crlp.org/pr_01_1130salvador.html Severe Abortion Law in El Salvador Persecutes Women] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061129232432/http://www.crlp.org/pr_01_1130salvador.html |date=2006-11-29 }}." Retrieved March 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article published in the April 9, 2006, edition of the ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'', writer [[Jack Hitt]] explored the effect of 1998 Penal Code.&lt;ref&gt;Hitt, Jack. (April 9, 2006). "[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/09/magazine/09abortion.html?ex=1302235200&amp;en=d855d80018cd6c56&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssuserland Pro-Life Nation]." ''The New York Times Magazine.'' Retrieved March 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The article was later discredited when it was revealed that a woman mentioned as having been sentenced to 30 years in prison for an abortion, Carmen Climaco, had been jailed for homicide of a full-term infant.&lt;ref&gt;Calame, Byron. (December 31, 2006). "[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/31/opinion/31pubed.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5088&amp;en=0b969b7478a93f06&amp;ex=1325221200&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss Truth, Justice, Abortion and the Times Magazine]." ''The New York Times Magazine.'' Retrieved November 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Karina del Carmen Herrera Climaco had given birth at home and then began to bleed heavily. (The pregnancy was almost certainly unintentional, as it occurred after a tubal ligation.) Her mother called police to take her to hospital. While she was in hospital, police searched her home and found a lifeless infant. Medical examination failed to determine if the infant was born alive or dead, nor a cause of death. Nevertheless, a sentence of aggravated homicide was passed, separating her from her three children. Almost 8 years later, thanks to the efforts of a group of activists and national and international attorneys, Karina’s sentence was reviewed. It was annulled and she was released. She has not been compensated for her eight years of incarceration.&lt;ref name="unreport1"/&gt;

Another 30-year sentence was passed out for an apparent miscarriage, in August 2008, by the Tribunal of [[San Francisco Gotera, Morazán|San Francisco Gotera]] in the department of [[Morazán Department|Morazan]]. María Edis Hernández Méndez de Castro, 30, was a single mother with 4 children when she found out she was pregnant. Maria told her family that she was pregnant, even though she didn't know how far along the pregnancy was. During the pregnancy, Maria felt a pain and went to the bathroom in her home at which time she suffered labor complications and passed out. She regained consciousness in the [[National Hospital of San Francisco]]. The doctor that treated Maria reported her to the police on suspicion of having an abortion. She was convicted of aggravated homicide and sentenced to thirty years in prison. Two more cases of women sentenced to lengthy prison terms for what might have been abortions or miscarriages are detailed in the same report.&lt;ref name="unreport1"/&gt;

===Medical harm===
The lack of contraceptive information and the ban on abortion put women's lives at risk, particularly when they are young. One-third of the women giving birth are 19 or younger, and a handful are 10 – 14 years old.&lt;ref name="unreport1"/&gt;

==Case of "Beatriz"==
In 2013, a case arose of a pregnant 22-year-old woman, identified as "Beatriz," who, due to [[lupus]] aggravated by loss of kidney function, was told by doctors that she would likely die if she gave birth and that the child, due to its [[anencephaly]], would likely have only a few hours of life. Her doctors requested permission from the government to perform an abortion because the fetus was nonviable and Beatriz was likely to die. When the case came before the Supreme Court, the court denied Beatriz's request.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57586726/pregnant-el-salvador-woman-denied-life-saving-abortion/ |publisher=CBS |title=Pregnant El Salvador woman denied life-saving abortion |date=May 29, 2013 |first=Jessica |last=Hartogs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''America's Health Rankings''' started in 1990 and is the longest-running annual assessment of the nation’s health on a state-by-state basis. It is founded on the [http://www.who.int/suggestions/faq/en/ World Health Organization holistic definition of health], which says health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. America’s Health Rankings is a partnership of the [[United Health]] Foundation, and the [[American Public Health Association]]. 
 
America's Health Rankings releases two yearly reports, one on the health of the general population in the 50 US states plus a senior report on the population aged 65 and older in each state. Both reports include some health metrics that are stratified by race/ethnicity, gender, age, education, place of residence, and economic status. State rankings are based on a methodology approved by a Scientific Advisory Committee. This methodology balances the contributions of health determinants—including 1) Behaviors; 2) Community and Environment; 3) Policy pertaining to our health care system, government, and numerous prevention programs; and 4) Clinical Care received—and Outcomes such as [[diabetes]] and deaths from [[cardiovascular disease]].

==Purpose==
The ultimate purpose of the two reports is to improve the health of the US population by providing information that stimulates individuals, elected officials, health care professionals, public health professionals, employers, educators, and communities to act and create change. The publication of the rankings stimulates conversations concerning health in each state and across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2376892 | pmid=18172156 | doi=10.2105/AJPH.2006.092981 | volume=98 | title=Ranking community health status to stimulate discussion of local public health issues: the Wisconsin County Health Rankings | year=2008 | journal=Am J Public Health | pages=209–12 | last1 = Peppard | first1 = PE | last2 = Kindig | first2 = DA | last3 = Dranger | first3 = E | last4 = Jovaag | first4 = A | last5 = Remington | first5 = PL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/21/health-rankings-senior-report_n_5351927.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/americas-health-rankings-hawaii-no-161937245.html&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental conviction of America’s Health Rankings is that each person in his or her capacity as an employee, employer, educator, student, voter, community volunteer, health care professional, public health professional, or elected official can contribute to the advancement of the health of his or her state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=21788777 | doi=10.1097/PHH.0b013e318211b49f | volume=17 | title=State responses to America's Health Rankings: the search for meaning, utility, and value | year=2011 | journal=J Public Health Manag Pract | pages=406–12 | last1 = Erwin | first1 = PC | last2 = Myers | first2 = CR | last3 = Myers | first3 = GM | last4 = Daugherty | first4 = LM}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3052341 | pmid=20558799 | doi=10.2105/AJPH.2009.177451 | volume=101 | title=The association of changes in local health department resources with changes in state-level health outcomes | year=2011 | journal=Am J Public Health | pages=609–15 | last1 = Erwin | first1 = PC | last2 = Greene | first2 = SB | last3 = Mays | first3 = GP | last4 = Ricketts | first4 = TC | last5 = Davis | first5 = MV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
America’s Health Rankings was first published in 1990 and ranked the 50 US states using 16 health measures. The 2014 25th anniversary edition of the report used 27 Core Measures and 22 Supplemental Measures to evaluate the health of each state and the nation. America’s Health Rankings Senior Report started in 2013 and used 34 Core Measures as well as five Supplemental Measures.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americashealthrankings.org/stories/Story/history&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific Advisory Committee===
In 2002 [[United Health]] Foundation and the [[American Public Health Association]] commissioned the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Public Health]] to do an ongoing review of America’s Health Rankings. The Scientific Advisory Committee, currently led by Anna Schenck, PhD, MSPH, formed as a result and was charged with recommending improvements that maintain the value of the comparative, longitudinal information. Improvements also reflect the evolving role and science of public health as well as include adding and refining health measures as they become available and acceptable. 
The Scientific Advisory Committee includes representatives from local health departments, the [[American Public Health Association]], current and former state health officers, and experts from many academic disciplines.

===Measure selection===
Four primary considerations drive the design of America’s Health Rankings and the selection of each measure:
# The overall rankings must represent a broad range of issues that affect a population’s health.
# Individual measures need to use common health-measurement criteria.
# Data have to be available at a state level.
# Data must be current and updated periodically.

==Components of health==
Americas Health Rankings includes in its model of health four groups of Determinants:
# &lt;u&gt;Behaviors:&lt;/u&gt; Everyday activities that affect personal health habits as well as practices by individuals and families that affect personal health and the use of health resources. Behaviors can be modified especially when individuals are supported by the three other groups of Determinants below.
# &lt;u&gt;Community and Environment:&lt;/u&gt; Daily conditions for living, working, shopping, exercising, etc., that affect achieving optimal health.
# &lt;u&gt;Policy:&lt;/u&gt; Availability of resources to encourage and maintain health. Policy also influences the extent that public and health programs penetrate the general population. Policy measures can have a wide reach throughout a state, and they promote healthy living and judicious consumption of health care resources.
# &lt;u&gt;Clinical Care:&lt;/u&gt; Access to as well as quality, appropriateness, and cost of care received at doctors' offices, clinics, and hospitals.

These four groups of measures influence health Outcomes of a state’s population, and improving these Determinants will improve Outcomes. Most measures are a combination of activities in all four groups. For example, the prevalence of smoking is one of the Behaviors strongly influenced by the Community and Environment, by public Policy including taxation and restrictions on smoking in public places, and by Clinical Care received to treat the chemical and behavioral addictions associated with tobacco.

==Methodology==
America's Health Rankings employs a unique methodology developed and annually reviewed by the Scientific Advisory Committee, a panel of leading public health scholars. This methodology weighs and balances the contributions of factors such as [[smoking]], [[obesity]], [[binge drinking]], high school graduation rates, children in [[poverty]], access to care, and [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of preventable disease to evaluate the health of a state's population. The report is based on data from the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services]], [[United States Department of Commerce|Commerce]], [[United States Department of Education|Education]] and [[United States Department of Labor|Labor]]; [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]; the [[American Medical Association]]; the [[Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care]] Project; [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]; the [[Administration on Aging]]; the [[National Center for Health Statistics]]; the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]]; [http://www.nfesh.org/ National Federation to End Senior Hunger]; the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]; the [[Kaiser Family Foundation]]; [[Brown University]]; the [[American Geriatrics Society]]; the [[Commonwealth Fund]]; and the [[Trust for America's Health]].&lt;ref name="americashealthrankings.org"&gt;http://www.americashealthrankings.org/about/annual&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall score for each state is calculated by adding the [[z score]]s of each measure multiplied by its percentage of total overall ranking (weight) and the effect (positively or negatively [[correlated]]) it has on health. Weights for individual metrics vary from 7.5% to 2.5%. The ranking is the ordering of each state according to value.&lt;ref&gt;http://americashealthrankings.org/states&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description of measures==

===2014 America’s Health Rankings===
The measures used in the 2014 America's Health Rankings are in two subgroups: Core Measures and Supplemental Measures.

Core Measures consist of health Determinants ([[risk factor]]s), and health Outcomes. Determinants are actions that affect the population’s future health, while Outcomes represent what has already occurred through death, disease, or missed days due to illness. There are four groups of Determinants: Behaviors, Community and Environment, Policy, and Clinical Care. The measures in these four groups influence a state’s health Outcomes, and improving the Determinants over time will improve Outcomes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://americashealthrankings.org/about/senior&lt;/ref&gt;

Supplemental Measures provide additional perspective on the health in a state. Supplemental Measures do not factor into a state’s overall score and ranking, but they are useful in forming a fuller understanding of the health of a state.&lt;ref name="americashealthrankings.org"/&gt;

'''Animal husbandry''' is the branch of [[agriculture]] concerned with animals that are raised for [[meat]], [[animal fiber|fibre]], [[milk]], [[egg]]s, or other products. It includes day-to-day care, [[selective breeding]] and the raising of [[livestock]].

Husbandry has a long history, starting with the [[Neolithic revolution]] when animals were first [[Domestication|domesticated]], from around 13,000 BC onwards, antedating farming of the first crops. By the time of early civilisations such as [[ancient Egypt]], [[cattle]], [[sheep]], [[goat]]s and [[pig]]s were being raised on farms.

Major changes took place in the [[Columbian Exchange]] when Old World livestock were brought to the New World, and then in the [[British Agricultural Revolution]] of the 18th century, when livestock breeds like the [[English Longhorn|Dishley Longhorn]] cattle and [[Lincoln (sheep)|Lincoln Longwool]] sheep were rapidly improved by agriculturalists such as [[Robert Bakewell (agriculturalist)|Robert Bakewell]] to yield more meat, milk, and [[wool]].

A wide range of other species such as [[horse]], [[water buffalo]], [[llama]], [[rabbit]] and [[guinea pig]] are used as livestock in some parts of the world. [[Insect farming]], as well as [[aquaculture]] of [[fish]], [[mollusc]]s, and [[crustacean]]s, is widespread.

Modern animal husbandry relies on [[Agriculture#Livestock production systems|production systems]] adapted to the type of land available. [[Subsistence farming]] is being superseded by [[intensive animal farming]] in the more developed parts of the world, where for example beef cattle are kept in high density [[feedlots]], and thousands of [[chicken]]s may be raised in broiler houses or [[battery farm|batteries]]. On poorer soil such as in uplands, animals are often kept more extensively, and may be allowed to roam widely, foraging for themselves.

Most livestock are [[herbivore]]s, except for pigs and chickens which are [[omnivore]]s. [[Ruminantia|Ruminants]] like cattle and sheep are adapted to feed on grass; they can forage outdoors, or may be fed entirely or in part on rations richer in energy and protein, such as pelleted cereals. Pigs and poultry cannot digest the [[cellulose]] in forage, and require cereals and other high-energy foods.

=== Birth of husbandry===
{{main|Neolithic Revolution|Domestication of animals}}
[[File:Fat tailed sheep, Afghanistan, 1976.jpg|thumb|left|The domestication of ruminants, like these [[fat-tailed sheep]] in Afghanistan, provided [[pastoral nomad|nomads]] across the Middle East and central Asia with a reliable source of food. |alt=Fat-tailed sheep in Afghanistan]]

The [[domestication]] of livestock was driven by the need to have food on hand when hunting was unproductive. The desirable characteristics of a domestic animal are that it should be useful to man, should be able to thrive in his company, should breed freely and be easy to tend.&lt;ref name=Clutton-Brock&gt;{{cite book |author=Clutton-Brock, Juliet |title=A Natural History of Domesticated Mammals |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cgL-EbbB8a0C&amp;pg=PR1 |year=1999 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-63495-3 |pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestication was not a single event, but a process repeated at various periods in different places. Sheep and goats were the animals that accompanied the [[pastoral nomad|nomads]] in the Middle East, while cattle and pigs were associated with more settled communities.&lt;ref name=Historyworld&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?historyid=ab57 |title=History of the domestication of animals |publisher=Historyworld |accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first wild animal to be domesticated was the [[dog]]. Half-wild dogs, perhaps starting with young individuals, may have been tolerated as scavengers and killers of vermin, and being naturally [[pack hunter]]s, were predisposed to become part of the human pack and join in the hunt. Prey animals, sheep, goats, pigs and cattle, were progressively domesticated early in the history of agriculture.&lt;ref name=Historyworld/&gt;

Pigs were domesticated in Mesopotamia around 13,000 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nelson |first=Sarah M. |date=1998 |title=Ancestors for the Pigs. Pigs in prehistory |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N5dN_A29v58C |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sheep]] followed, some time between 11,000 and 9,000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sheep and Goat Science |edition=Fifth |last=Ensminger |first=M.E. |author2=Parker, R.O. |year=1986 |publisher=Interstate Printers and Publishers |isbn=0-8134-2464-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cattle]] were domesticated from the wild [[aurochs]] in the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan around 8,500 BC.&lt;ref name="McTavish"&gt;{{cite journal |author=McTavish, E.J., Decker, J.E., Schnabel, R.D., Taylor, J.F. and Hillis, D.M. |year=2013 |title=New World cattle show ancestry from multiple independent domestication events |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=110 |pages=1398–1406 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1303367110 |pmid=23530234 |publisher=[[National Academy of Sciences]] |pmc=3625352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cow was a great advantage to a villager as she produced more milk than her calf needed, and her strength could be put to use as a [[working animal]], pulling a plough to increase production of crops, and drawing a sledge, and later a cart, to bring the produce home from the field. Draught animals were first used about 4,000 BC in the Middle East, increasing agricultural production immeasurably.&lt;ref name=Historyworld/&gt; In southern Asia, the [[elephant]] was domesticated by 6,000 BC.&lt;ref name=gupta&gt;Gupta, Anil K. in ''Origin of agriculture and domestication of plants and animals linked to early Holocene climate amelioration'', Current Science, Vol. 87, No. 1, 10 July 2004 59. Indian Academy of Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fossilised chicken bones dated to 5040 BC have been found in northeastern China, far from where their wild ancestors lived in the jungles of tropical Asia, but archaeologists believe that the original purpose of domestication was for the sport of cockfighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How the Chicken Conquered the World |author1=Adler, Jerry |author2=Lawler, Andrew |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-the-chicken-conquered-the-world-87583657/?no-ist |newspaper=Smithsonian Magazine |date=1 June 2012 |accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in South America, the [[llama]] and the [[alpaca]] had been domesticated, probably before 3,000 BC, as beasts of burden and for their wool. Neither was strong enough to pull a plough which limited the development of agriculture in the New World.&lt;ref name=Historyworld/&gt;

Horses occur naturally on the steppes of Central Asia, and their domestication, around 3,000 BC in the [[Black Sea]] and [[Caspian Sea]] region, was originally as a source of meat; use as [[pack animal]]s and for riding followed. Around the same time, the [[Nubian wild ass|wild ass]] was being tamed in Egypt. [[Camel]]s were domesticated soon after this,&lt;ref name="Sapir-Hen 2013 277–285"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sapir-Hen |first=Lidar |author2=Erez Ben-Yosef |title=The Introduction of Domestic Camels to the Southern Levant: Evidence from the Aravah Valley |journal=Tel Aviv |year=2013 |volume=40 |pages=277–85 |url=http://archaeology.tau.ac.il/ben-yosef/pub/Pub_PDFs/Sapir-Hen&amp;Ben-Yosef13_CamelAravah_TelAviv.pdf |doi=10.1179/033443513x13753505864089}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Bactrian camel]] in [[Mongolia]] and the [[Arabian camel]] becoming beasts of burden. By 1000 BC, caravans of Arabian camels were linking India with Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name=Historyworld/&gt;

===Ancient civilisations===
[[File:Egyptian Domesticated Animals.jpg|thumb|Milking cattle in [[ancient Egypt]]|alt=Egyptian hieroglyphic of cattle]]

In [[ancient Egypt]], cattle were the most important livestock, and sheep, goats, and pigs were also kept; poultry including ducks, geese, and pigeons were captured in nets and bred on farms, where they were force-fed with dough to fatten them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1998 |author=Manuelian, Peter der |title=Egypt: The World of the Pharaohs |location=Cologne, Germany |publisher=Könemann |isbn=3-89508-913-3 |page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nile provided a plentiful source of fish. [[Honey bee]]s were domesticated from at least the Old Kingdom, providing both honey and wax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nicholson |first=Paul T. |title=Ancient Egyptian Materials and Technology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2000 |isbn=0-521-45257-0 |page=409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient Rome]], all the livestock known in ancient Egypt were available. In addition, rabbits were domesticated for food by the first century BC. To help flush them out from their underground burrows, the [[polecat]] was domesticated as the [[ferret]], its use described by [[Pliny the Elder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Clutton-Brock, Juliet |title=Domesticated animals from early times |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dbfuAAAAMAAJ |year=1981 |publisher=Heinemann |page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval husbandry===
&lt;div&gt;[[File:Sheep in pen medieval France 15th century MS Douce 195.jpg |thumb|left |Shepherd with sheep in woven hurdle pen. Medieval France. 15th century, MS Douce 195 |alt=Painting of shepherd with sheep]]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;In northern Europe, agriculture including animal husbandry went into decline when the Roman empire collapsed. Some aspects such as the herding of animals continued throughout the period. By the 11th century, the economy had recovered and the countryside was again productive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=O'Connor |first1=Terry |title=Livestock and animal husbandry in early medieval England |journal=Quaternary International |date=30 September 2014 |volume=346 |pages=109–18 |doi=10.1016/j.quaint.2013.09.019 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618213007192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Domesday Book]]'' recorded every parcel of land and every animal in Britain: "there was not one single hide, nor a yard of land, nay, moreover ... not even an ox, nor a cow, nor a swine was there left, that was not set down in [the king's] writ."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/657 |translator1-first=J.

Woodland for [feeding] 70 pigs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interpreting Domesday |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/domesday/discover-domesday/interpreting-domesday.htm |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;div&gt;The improvements of animal husbandry in the medieval period in Europe went hand in hand with other developments. Improvements to the plough allowed the soil to be tilled to a greater depth. Horses took over from oxen as the main providers of traction, new ideas on crop rotation were developed and the growing of crops for winter fodder gained ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecifm.rdg.ac.uk/history.htm |title=The progress of farming in Medieval Europe |work=History of Agriculture |publisher=University of Reading |accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peas, beans and vetches became common; they increased soil fertility through nitrogen fixation, allowing more livestock to be kept.&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;{{cite journal |last=Campbell |first=Bruce M.

=== Columbian Exchange ===
{{main |Columbian Exchange}}

Exploration and colonisation of North and South America resulted in the introduction into Europe of such crops as maize, potatoes, sweet potatoes and manioc, while the principal Old World livestock – cattle, horses, sheep and goats – were introduced into the New World for the first time along with wheat, barley, rice and turnips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/american-indians/essays/columbian-exchange |title=The Columbian Exchange |publisher=The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History |work=History Now |author=Crosby, Alfred |accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main |British Agricultural Revolution}}
[[File:o aye.jpg |thumb |The [[Lincoln sheep|Lincoln Longwool]] breed was improved by [[Robert Bakewell (agriculturalist)|Robert Bakewell]] in the 18th century. |alt=Lincoln Longwool Sheep]]

[[Selective breeding]] for desired traits was established as a scientific practice by [[Robert Bakewell (agriculturalist)|Robert Bakewell]] during the [[British Agricultural Revolution]] in the 18th century. One of his most important breeding programs was with sheep. Using native stock, he was able to quickly select for large, yet fine-boned sheep, with long, lustrous wool. The [[Lincoln (sheep)|Lincoln Longwool]] was improved by Bakewell and in turn the Lincoln was used to develop the subsequent breed, named the New (or Dishley) Leicester. It was [[Polled livestock|hornless]] and had a square, meaty body with straight top lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Robert Bakewell (1725–1795) |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/bakewell_robert.shtml |publisher=BBC History |accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sheep were exported widely and have contributed to numerous modern breeds. Under his influence, English farmers began to breed [[cattle]] for use primarily as beef. Long-horned heifers were crossed with the Westmoreland bull to create the [[English Longhorn|Dishley Longhorn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=English Longhorn |url=http://www.thecattlesite.com/breeds/beef/61/english-longhorn/ |website=The Cattle Site |accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The semi-natural, unfertilised pastures formed by traditional agricultural methods in Europe were managed by grazing and mowing. As the ecological impact of this land management strategy is similar to the impact of such natural disturbances as a [[wildfire]], this agricultural system shares many beneficial characteristics with a natural habitat, including the promotion of [[biodiversity]]. This strategy is declining in Europe today due to the intensification of agriculture. The mechanized and chemical methods used are causing biodiversity to decline.&lt;ref name="Pykala2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pykala |first=Juha |title=Mitigating Human Effects of European Biodiversity Through Traditional Animal Husbandry |journal=Conservation Biology |year=2000 |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=705–12 |doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.99119.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Herdwicks Lake District.jpg|thumb|left |[[Herdwick sheep]] in an extensive [[hill farming]] system, [[Lake District]], England |alt=Herdwick sheep]]

Traditionally, animal husbandry was part of the [[subsistence farming|subsistence farmer's]] way of life, producing not only the food needed by the family but also the fuel, fertiliser, clothing, transport and draught power. Killing the animal for food was a secondary consideration, and wherever possible its products, such as wool, eggs, milk and blood (by the [[Maasai people|Maasai]]) were harvested while the animal was still alive.&lt;ref name=Webster&gt;{{cite book |author=Webster, John |title=Animal Husbandry Regained: The Place of Farm Animals in Sustainable Agriculture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D6v-Tdhm5SgC&amp;pg=PA5 |year=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-84971-420-4 |pages=4–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the traditional system of [[transhumance]], people and livestock moved seasonally between fixed summer and winter pastures; in [[montane]] regions the summer pasture was up in the mountains, the winter pasture in the valleys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blench |first=Roger |title='You can't go home again' – Pastoralism in the new millennium |publisher=Overseas Development Institute |location=London, UK | date=17 May 2001 |page=12 |url=http://www.odi.org.uk/work/projects/pdn/eps.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animals can be kept extensively or intensively. Extensive systems involve animals roaming at will, or under the supervision of a herdsman, often for their protection from [[Predation|predators]]. [[Ranch]]ing in the [[Western United States]] involves large herds of cattle grazing widely over public and private lands.&lt;ref name=Starrs&gt;{{cite book |author=Starrs, Paul F. |title=Let the Cowboy Ride: Cattle Ranching in the American West |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WHfnaQLGIx4C&amp;pg=PA1 |year=2000 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn=978-0-8018-6351-6 |pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar cattle stations are found in South America, Australia and other places with large areas of land and low rainfall. Similar ranching systems have been used for [[sheep]], [[deer]], [[ostrich]], [[emu]], [[llama]] and [[alpaca]].&lt;ref name=Levinson&gt;{{cite book |author1=Levinson, David |author2=Christensen, Karen |title=Encyclopedia of Community: From the Village to the Virtual World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1geOjQ6R0MC&amp;pg=PA1139 |year=2003 |publisher=Sage |isbn=978-0-7619-2598-9 |page=1139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the uplands of the United Kingdom, sheep are turned out on the fells in spring and graze the abundant mountain grasses untended, being brought to lower altitudes late in the year, with supplementary feeding being provided in winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Shepherd's Life |last=Rebanks |first=James |year=2015 |publisher=Penguin: Random House |isbn=978-0141-97936-6 |page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt; In rural locations, [[pig]]s and [[poultry]] can obtain much of their nutrition from scavenging, and in African communities, hens may live for months without being fed, and still produce one or two eggs a week.&lt;ref name=Webster/&gt;

In between these two extremes are semi-intensive, often family-run farms where livestock graze outside for much of the year, silage or hay is made to cover the times of year when the grass stops growing, and fertiliser, feed, and other inputs are brought onto the farm from outside.&lt;ref name=Blount&gt;{{cite book |author=Blount, W.P. |title=Intensive Livestock Farming |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UyHLBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA360 |year=2013 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-1-4831-9565-0 |pages=360–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feeding===
{{main |animal feed}}
[[File:Cattle round a feeder with Avon Farm - geograph.org.uk - 1563342.jpg|thumb|left |[[Cattle]] around an outdoor feeder |alt=Cattle around an outdoor feeder]]

Animals used as livestock are predominantly [[Herbivore|herbivorous]], the main exception being the pig which is an omnivore. The herbivores can be divided into "concentrate selectors" which selectively feed on seeds, fruits and highly nutritious young foliage, "grazers" which mainly feed on grass, and "intermediate feeders" which choose their diet from the whole range of available plant material. Cattle, sheep, goats, deer and antelopes are [[Ruminantia|ruminants]]; they digest food in two steps, chewing and swallowing in the normal way, and then regurgitating the semidigested cud to chew it again and thus extract the maximum possible food value.&lt;ref name=Dryden&gt;{{cite book |author=Dryden, Gordon McL. |title=Animal Nutrition Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OG6qrtVKwTEC |year=2008 |publisher=CABI |isbn=978-1-78064-056-3 |pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The dietary needs of these animals is mostly met by eating grass. Grasses grow from the base of the leaf-blade, enabling it to thrive even when heavily grazed or cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Living Planet]] |first=David |last=Attenborough |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation ]] |isbn=0-563-20207-6 |year=1984 |authorlink=David Attenborough |pages=113–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many climates grass growth is seasonal, for example in the temperate [[summer]] or tropical [[rainy season]], so some areas of the crop are set aside to be cut and preserved, either as [[hay]] (dried grass), or as [[silage]] (fermented grass).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=United States. Agricultural Research Service. Animal Husbandry Research Division |title=Hay crop silage |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eDBHAQAAIAAJ |year=1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other forage crops are also grown and many of these, as well as crop residues, can be ensiled to fill the gap in the nutritional needs of livestock in the lean season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/Y1936E/y1936e08.htm |title=Ensiling crop residues |author=Jianxin, Liu; Jun, Guo |work=Animal production based on crop residues |publisher=FAO |accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LeinPresskuchen-CBIO.jpg |thumb |Cattle feed pellets of pressed [[linseed]] |alt=Cattle feed pellets]]

Extensively reared animals may subsist entirely on forage, but more intensively kept livestock will require energy and protein-rich foods in addition. Energy is mainly derived from cereals and cereal by-products, fats and oils and sugar-rich foods, while protein may come from fish or meat meal, milk products, [[legumes]] and other plant foods, often the by-products of vegetable oil extraction.&lt;ref name="Dryden2008"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dryden, Gordon McL. |title=Animal Nutrition Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qf_RZOt8pwAC&amp;pg=PA16 |year=2008 |publisher=CABI |isbn=978-1-84593-412-5 |pages=16–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pigs and poultry are non-ruminants and unable to digest the [[cellulose]] in grass and other forages, so they are fed entirely on cereals and other high-energy foodstuffs. The ingredients for the animals' rations can be grown on the farm or can be bought, in the form of pelleted or cubed, compound foodstuffs specially formulated for the different classes of livestock, their growth stages and their specific nutritional requirements. Vitamins and minerals are added to balance the diet.&lt;ref name=FSA&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.food.gov.uk/business-industry/farmingfood/animalfeed/what-farm-animals-eat |title=What farm animals eat |publisher=Food Standards Agency |accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmed fish are usually fed pelleted food.&lt;ref name=FSA/&gt;

=== Breeding ===
{{main |Animal breeding}}
The breeding of farm animals seldom occurs spontaneously but is managed by farmers with a view to encouraging certain traits that are seen as desirable. These include hardiness, prolificness, mothering abilities, fast growth rates, low feed consumption per unit of growth, better body proportions, higher yields, better fibre qualities and other characteristics. Undesirable traits such as health defects, aggressiveness or lack of docility are selected against.&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;{{cite book |author=Turner, Jacky |title=Animal Breeding, Welfare and Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YdYm1zsNkFQC |year=2010 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-54187-2 |page=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jarman |first=M.R. |first2=Grahame |last2=Clark |first3=Caroline |last3=Grigson |first4=H.P. |last4=Uerpmann |first5=M.L. |last5=Ryder |title=Early Animal Husbandry |journal=The Royal Society |year=1976 |volume=275 |issue=936 |pages=85–97 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1976.0072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selective breeding has been responsible for some large increases in productivity. In 2007, a typical broiler chicken at eight weeks old was 4.8 times as heavy as a bird of similar age in 1957.&lt;ref name=Turner/&gt; In the thirty years to 2007, the average milk yield of a dairy cow in the United States nearly doubled.&lt;ref name=Turner/&gt;

[[File:Inseminatie (4494727256).jpg |thumb |[[Artificial insemination]] |alt=artificial insemination]]

Techniques such as [[artificial insemination]] and [[embryo transfer]] are frequently used today, not only as methods to guarantee that females breed regularly but also to help improve herd genetics. This may be done by transplanting [[embryos]] from high-quality females into lower-quality surrogate mothers – freeing up the higher-quality mother to be reimpregnated. This practice vastly increases the number of offspring which may be produced by a small selection of the best quality parent animals.{{citation needed |date=December 2017}}

On one hand, this improves the ability of the animals to convert feed to meat, milk, or fiber more efficiently, and improve the quality of the final product. On the other, it decreases [[genetic diversity]], increasing the severity of certain disease outbreaks among other risks.{{citation needed |date=December 2017}}

===Animal health===
{{further |Veterinary medicine}}
[[File:Vaccination of goat in Niger.jpg|thumb|left |[[Vaccination|Vaccinating]] a [[goat]], [[Niger]] |alt=Vaccination of a goat]]

Good husbandry, proper feeding, and [[hygiene]] are the main contributors to animal health on the farm, bringing economic benefits through maximised production. When, despite these precautions, animals still become sick, they are treated with [[veterinary medicine]]s, by the farmer and the [[veterinarian]]. In the European Union, when farmers treat their own animals, they are required to follow the guidelines for treatment and to record the treatments given.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Farmers |url=http://www.epruma.eu/audience/farmers.html |publisher=European Platform for the Responsible Use of Medicines in Animals |accessdate=18 May 2017 |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Animals are susceptible to a number of diseases and conditions that may affect their health. Some, like [[classical swine fever]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/classical_swine_fever.pdf |title=Classical swine fever |publisher=The Center for Food Security and Public Health |accessdate=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[scrapie]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eradicatescrapie.org/About%20Scrapie/Fact%20Sheet.html |title=Scrapie Fact Sheet |year=2001 |publisher=National Institute for Animal Agriculture |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; are specific to one type of stock, while others, like [[foot-and-mouth disease]] affect all [[cloven-hoofed]] animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecattlesite.com/diseaseinfo/243/footandmouth |title=Foot-and-mouth |publisher=The Cattle Site |accessdate=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the condition is serious, governments impose regulations on import and export, on the movement of stock, [[quarantine]] restrictions and the reporting of suspected cases. [[Vaccine]]s are available against certain diseases, and antibiotics are widely used where appropriate. At one time, antibiotics were routinely added to certain compound foodstuffs to promote growth, but this practice is now frowned on in many countries because of the risk that it may lead to [[antibiotic resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/203664/feed/67871/Antibiotics-and-other-growth-stimulants |title=feed (agriculture) {{!}} Antibiotics and other growth stimulants |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animals living under intensive conditions are particularly prone to internal and external parasites; increasing numbers of [[sea lice]] are affecting farmed salmon in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scottish salmon farming's sea lice 'crisis' |author=Fraser, Douglas |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-38966188 |newspaper=BBC |date=14 February 2017 |accessdate=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reducing the parasite burdens of livestock results in increased productivity and profitability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://animalhealthireland.ie/?page_id=403 |title=Parasite control |publisher=Animal Health Ireland |accessdate=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments are particularly concerned with [[Zoonosis|zoonoses]], diseases that humans may acquire from animals. Wild animal populations may harbour diseases that can affect domestic animals which may acquire them as a result of insufficient [[biosecurity]]. An outbreak of [[Nipah virus]] in Malaysia in 1999 was traced back to pigs becoming ill after contact with fruit-eating [[flying fox]]es, their faeces and urine. The pigs in turn passed the infection to humans.&lt;ref name=chua&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chua, K.B.; Chua, B. H.; Wang, C.

This virus is easily transmissible to domestic poultry, and to humans living in close proximity with them. Other infectious diseases affecting wild animals, farm animals and humans include [[rabies]], [[leptospirosis]], [[brucellosis]], [[Mycobacterium bovis|tuberculosis]] and [[trichinosis]].&lt;ref name=Norrgren&gt;{{cite book |author1=Norrgren, Leif |author2=Levengood, Jeffrey M. |title=Ecology and Animal Health |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4KcCZmJTt_QC&amp;pg=PA183 |year=2012 |publisher=Baltic University Press |isbn=978-91-86189-12-9 |pages=103–04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no single universally agreed definition of which species are livestock. Widely agreed types of livestock include cattle for beef and dairy, sheep, goats, pigs, and poultry. Various other species are sometimes considered livestock, such as horses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Welcome to Equine Research, Education, and Outreach |url=http://afs.ca.uky.edu/equine |publisher=University of Kentucky |accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while poultry birds are sometimes excluded.

===Dairy===
{{main|Dairy farming}}
[[File:2014-07-25 Melkkarussel - Hemme Milch (5).jpg|thumb|left|A modern rotary milking parlour, Germany|alt=Rotary milking parlour]]

Although all mammals produce milk to nourish their young, the cow is predominantly used throughout the world to produce milk and milk products for human consumption. Other animals used to a lesser extent for this purpose include sheep, goats, camels, buffaloes, yaks, reindeer, horses and donkeys.&lt;ref name=FAOdairy&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/agriculture/dairy-gateway/milk-production/dairy-animals/en/#.WSP-0sa1vx8 |title=Dairy animals |work=Dairy production and products |publisher=FAO |accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All these animals have been domesticated over the centuries, being bred for such desirable characteristics as fecundity, productivity, docility and the ability to thrive under the  prevailing conditions. Whereas in the past, cattle had multiple functions, modern dairy cow breeding has resulted in specialised [[Holstein Friesian cattle|Holstein Friesian-type]] animals that produce large quantities of milk economically. [[Artificial insemination]] is widely available to allow farmers to select for the particular traits that suit their circumstances.&lt;ref name=FAObreeding&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/agriculture/dairy-gateway/milk-production/breeding/en/#.WSQJHca1vx8 |title=Breeding |work=Dairy production and products |publisher=FAO |accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas in the past, cows were kept in small herds on family farms, grazing pastures and being fed hay in winter, nowadays there is a trend towards larger herds, more intensive systems, the feeding of [[silage]] and "zero grazing", a system where grass is cut and brought to the cow, which is housed year-round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ruaf.org/sites/default/files/Zero%20Grazing%20Housing_1.pdf |title=Housing in a zero grazing system |publisher=Republic of Kenya: Ministry of Livestock Development |accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many communities, milk production is only part of the purpose of keeping an animal which may also be used as a beast of burden or to draw a plough, or for the production of fibre, meat and leather, with the [[Cow dung|dung]] being used for fuel or for the improvement of [[soil fertility]]. Sheep and goats may be favoured for dairy production in climates and conditions that do not suit dairy cows.&lt;ref name=FAOdairy/&gt;

{{main|Meat industry|Cattle|Sheep farming|Pig farming}}

[[Meat]], mainly from farmed animals, is a major source of dietary [[protein]] around the world, averaging about 8% of man's energy intake. The actual types eaten depend on local preferences, availability, cost and other factors, with cattle, sheep, pigs and goats being the main species involved. Cattle generally produce a single offspring annually which takes more than a year to mature; sheep and goats often have twins and these are ready for slaughter in less than a year; pigs are more prolific, producing more than one litter of up to about 11&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Aherne |first1=Frank |last2=Kirkwood |first2=Roy |title=Factors Affecting Litter Size |url=http://www.thepigsite.com/articles/304/factors-affecting-litter-size/ |website=The Pig Site |date=16 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; piglets each year.&lt;ref name=Gregory&gt;{{cite book |author1=Gregory, Neville G. |author2=Grandin, Temple |title=Animal Welfare and Meat Production |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RTeyiR0rSEwC&amp;pg=PA1 |year=2007 |publisher=CABI |isbn=978-1-84593-216-9 |pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horses, donkeys, deer, buffalo, llamas, alpacas, guanacos and vicunas are farmed for meat in various regions. Some desirable traits of animals raised for meat include fecundity, hardiness, fast growth rate, ease of management and high food conversion efficiency. About half of the world's meat is produced from animals grazing on open ranges or on enclosed pastures, the other half being produced intensively in various factory-farming systems; these are mostly cows, pigs or poultry, and often reared indoors, typically at high densities.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite book |author1=Miller, G.

===Poultry===
[[File:Battery hens -Bastos, Sao Paulo, Brazil-31March2007.jpg|thumb|upright|Battery hens, Brazil|alt=Battery hens]]
{{main|Poultry farming}}

Poultry, kept for their eggs and for their meat, include chickens, turkeys, geese and ducks. The great majority of laying birds used for egg production are chickens. Methods for keeping layers range from free-range systems, where the birds can roam as they will but are housed at night for their own protection, through semi-intensive systems where they are housed in barns and have perches, litter and some freedom of movement, to intensive systems where they are kept in cages. The [[battery cage]]s are arranged in long rows in multiple tiers, with external feeders, drinkers, and egg collection facilities. This is the most labour saving and economical method of egg production but has been criticised on animal welfare grounds as the birds are unable to exhibit their normal behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ciwf.org.uk/farm-animals/chickens/egg-laying-hens |title=About egg laying hens |publisher=Compassion in World Farming |accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the developed world, the majority of the poultry reared for meat is raised indoors in big sheds, with automated equipment under environmentally controlled conditions. Chickens raised in this way are known as broilers, and genetic improvements have meant that they can be grown to slaughter weight within six or seven weeks of hatching. Newly hatched chicks are restricted to a small area and given supplementary heating. Litter on the floor absorbs the droppings and the area occupied is expanded as they grow. Feed and water is supplied automatically and the lighting is controlled. The birds may be harvested on several occasions or the whole shed may be cleared at one time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicken.org.au/page.php?id=6 |title=Growing meat chickens |year=2013 |publisher=Australian Chicken Meat Federation |accessdate=26 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170515090315/http://www.chicken.org.au/page.php?id=6 |archive-date=2017-05-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar rearing system is usually used for turkeys, which are less hardy than chickens, but they take longer to grow and are often moved on to separate fattening units to finish.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwin, C. M. (2010). "Turkeys: Behavior, Management and Well-Being". In ''The Encyclopaedia of Animal Science''. Wilson G. Pond and Alan W. Bell (Eds). Marcel Dekker. pp.  847–49&lt;/ref&gt; Ducks are particularly popular in Asia and Australia and can be killed at seven weeks under commercial conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poultryhub.org/species/commercial-poultry/duck|title=Duck |website=Poultry Hub |accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aquaculture===
[[File:Bassins de la pisciculture de la Calonne.jpg|thumb|left|Freshwater [[fish farming]], France|alt=Freshwater fish farm]]
{{main|Aquaculture}}

Aquaculture has been defined as "the farming of aquatic organisms including fish, molluscs, crustaceans and aquatic plants and implies some form of intervention in the rearing process to enhance production, such as regular stocking, feeding, protection from predators, etc. Farming also implies individual or [[Corporate farming|corporate ownership]] of the stock being cultivated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/statistics/global-aquaculture-production/en |title=Global Aquaculture Production |work=Fishery Statistical Collections |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice it can take place in the sea or in freshwater, and be extensive or intensive. Whole bays, lakes or ponds may be devoted to aquaculture, or the farmed animal may be retained in cages (fish), artificial reefs, racks or strings (shellfish). Fish and prawns can be cultivated in [[paddy field|rice paddies]], either arriving naturally or being introduced, and both crops can be harvested together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/field/003/AC180E/AC180E01.htm |title=Fish culture in rice fields |work=Fishery Statistical Collections |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fish hatchery|Fish hatcheries]] provide larval and juvenile fish, crustaceans and shellfish, for use in aquaculture systems. When large enough these are transferred to growing-on tanks and sold to fish farms to reach harvest size. Some species that are commonly raised in hatcheries include [[shrimp]]s, [[prawn]]s, [[salmon]], [[tilapia]], [[oyster]]s and [[scallop]]s. Similar facilities can be used to raise species with conservation needs to be released into the wild, or game fish for restocking waterways. Important aspects of husbandry at these early stages include selection of breeding stock, control of water quality and nutrition. In the wild, there is a massive amount of mortality at the nursery stage; farmers seek to minimise this while at the same time maximising growth rates.&lt;ref name=Mosig&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mosig, John |author2=Fallu, Ric |title=Australian Fish Farmer: A Practical Guide to Aquaculture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWQI5SNViXcC&amp;pg=PA25 |year=2004 |publisher=Landlinks Press |isbn=978-0-643-06865-0 |pages=25–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal welfare===
{{main|Animal welfare}}

Since the 18th century, people have become increasingly concerned about [[animal welfare|the welfare of farm animals]]. Possible measures of welfare include [[longevity]], [[Ethology|behavior]], [[physiology]], [[reproduction]], freedom from [[disease]], and freedom from [[immunosuppression]]. Standards and laws for animal welfare have been created worldwide, broadly in line with the most widely held position in the western world, a form of [[utilitarianism]]: that it is [[moral philosophy|morally acceptable]] for humans to use non-human animals, provided that no unnecessary suffering is caused, and that the benefits to humans outweigh the costs to the livestock. An opposing view is that [[animal rights|animals have rights]], should not be regarded as property, and should never be used by humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Grandin |first=Temple |authorlink=Temple Grandin |title=Animals are not things: A view on animal welfare based on neurological complexity |url=http://www.humanities.uci.edu/collective/hctr/trans-scripts/2013/2013_03_10.pdf |work=Trans-Scripts 3: An Interdisciplinary Online Journal in Humanities And Social Sciences at UC Irvine |year=2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20140819053847/http://www.humanities.uci.edu/collective/hctr/trans-scripts/2013/2013_03_10.pdf |archivedate=19 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hewson |first=C.

Farm animals are widespread in books and songs for children; the reality of animal husbandry is often distorted, softened, or idealized, giving children an almost entirely fictitious account of farm life. The books often depict a rural idyll of happy animals free to roam in attractive countryside, which is completely at odds with the realities of the impersonal, mechanized activities involved in modern intensive farming.&lt;ref name=Hoult&gt;{{cite book|author=Hoult-Saros, Stacy E. |title=The Mythology of the Animal Farm in Children's Literature: Over the Fence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UHGPDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA29 |year=2016|publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=978-1-4985-1978-6 |pages=18–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pigs, for example, appear in several of [[Beatrix Potter]]'s "little books", as Piglet in [[A. A.

Many of these books are completely [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]], dressing farm animals in clothes and having them walk on two legs, live in houses, and perform human activities.&lt;ref name=Hoult/&gt; The [[children's music|children's song]] "[[Old MacDonald Had a Farm]]" describes a farmer named MacDonald and the various animals he keeps, celebrating the noises they each make.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Waltz, Robert B.; Engle, David G. |url=http://www.csufresno.edu/folklore/ballads/R457.html |title=Old MacDonald Had a Farm |website=The Traditional Ballad Index |accessdate=18 May 2017 |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Auditory masking''' occurs when the perception of one [[sound]] is affected by the presence of another sound.&lt;ref name="Gelfand 2004"&gt;Gelfand, S.A. (2004) ''Hearing – An Introduction to Psychological and Physiological Acoustics'' 4th Ed. New York, Marcel Dekker&lt;/ref&gt;

Auditory masking in the [[frequency domain]] is known as '''simultaneous masking''', '''frequency masking''' or '''spectral masking'''. Auditory masking in the [[time domain]] is known as '''temporal masking''' or '''non-simultaneous masking'''.

==Masked threshold==
The ''unmasked threshold'' is the quietest level of the signal which can be perceived without a masking signal present. The ''masked threshold'' is the quietest level of the signal perceived when combined with a specific masking noise.  The amount of masking is the difference between the masked and unmasked thresholds.

[[Image:Masker increased threshold.svg|thumb|300px|Figure A – adapted from Gelfand (2004)&lt;ref name="Gelfand 2004"/&gt;]]
Gelfand provides a basic example.&lt;ref name="Gelfand 2004"&gt;Gelfand, S.A. (2004) ''Hearing – An Introduction to Psychological and Physiological Acoustics'' 4th Ed. New York, Marcel Dekker&lt;/ref&gt; Let us say that for a given individual, the sound of a cat scratching a post in an otherwise quiet environment is first audible at a level of 10 [[dB SPL]]. However, in the presence of a masking noise (for example, a vacuum cleaner that is running simultaneously) that same individual cannot detect the sound of the cat scratching unless the level of the scratching sound is at least 26 dB SPL. We would say that the unmasked threshold for that individual for the target sound (i.e., the cat scratching) is 10 dB SPL, while the masked threshold is 26 dB SPL. The amount of masking is simply the difference between these two thresholds: 16 dB.

The amount of masking will vary depending on the characteristics of both the target signal and the masker, and will also be specific to an individual listener. While the person in the example above was able to detect the cat scratching at 26 dB SPL, another person may not  be able to hear the cat scratching while the vacuum was on until the sound level of the cat scratching was increased to 30 dB SPL (thereby making the amount of masking for the second listener 20 dB).

== Simultaneous masking ==
Simultaneous masking occurs when a sound is made inaudible by a noise or unwanted sound of the same duration as the original sound.&lt;ref name="Moore 2004"&gt;Moore, B.C.J. (2004) ''An Introduction to the Psychology of Hearing'', 5th Ed. London, Elsevier Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a powerful spike at 1&amp;nbsp;kHz will tend to mask out a lower-level tone at 1.1&amp;nbsp;kHz. Also, two sine tones at 440 and 450&amp;nbsp;Hz can be perceived clearly when separated. They cannot be perceived clearly when presented simultaneously.

===Critical bandwidth===
If two sounds of two different frequencies are played at the same time, two separate sounds can often be heard rather than a combination tone.  The ability to hear frequencies separately is known as ''frequency resolution'' or ''frequency selectivity''.  When signals are perceived as a combination tone, they are said to reside in the same ''critical bandwidth''. This effect is thought to occur due to filtering within the [[cochlea]], the hearing organ in the inner ear. A complex sound is split into different frequency components and these components cause a peak in the pattern of vibration at a specific place on the cilia inside the [[basilar membrane]] within the cochlea.  These components are then coded independently on the [[auditory nerve]] which transmits sound information to the brain.  This individual coding only occurs if the frequency components are different enough in frequency, otherwise they are in the same critical band and are coded at the same place and are perceived as one sound instead of two.&lt;ref name="Moore 1986"&gt;Moore, B.C.J. (1986) ''Frequency Selectivity in Hearing'', London, Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The filters that distinguish one sound from another are called [[auditory filter]]s, listening channels or critical bandwidths. Frequency resolution occurs on the basilar membrane due to the listener choosing a filter which is centered over the frequency they expect to hear, the signal frequency.  A sharply tuned filter has good frequency resolution as it allows the center frequencies through but not other frequencies (Pickles 1982).  Damage to the cochlea and the outer hair cells in the cochlea can impair the ability to tell sounds apart (Moore 1986).  This explains why someone with a hearing loss due to cochlea damage would have more difficulty than a normal hearing person in distinguishing between different consonants in speech.&lt;ref name="Moore 1995"&gt;Moore, B.C.J. (1995) ''Perceptual Consequences of Cochlear Damage'', Oxford, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Masking illustrates the limits of frequency selectivity. If a signal is masked by a masker with a different frequency to the signal, then the [[auditory system]] was unable to distinguish between the two frequencies.  By experimenting with conditions where one sound can mask a previously heard signal, the frequency selectivity of the auditory system can be tested.&lt;ref name="Moore 1998"&gt;Moore, B.C.J. (1998) ''Cochlear Hearing Loss'', London, Whurr Publishers Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;

===Similar frequencies===
[[Image:maskingpatterns sp11.jpg|thumb|Figure B – Adapted from Ehmer&lt;!--reference unknown--&gt;]]

How effective the masker is at raising the threshold of the signal depends on the frequency of the signal and the frequency of the masker. The graphs in Figure B are a series of masking patterns, also known as masking [[audiogram]]s. Each graph shows the amount of masking produced at each masker frequency shown at the top corner, 250, 500, 1000 and 2000&amp;nbsp;Hz.  For example, in the first graph the masker is presented at a frequency of 250&amp;nbsp;Hz at the same time as the signal.  The amount the masker increases the threshold of the signal is plotted and this is repeated for different signal frequencies, shown on the X axis.  The frequency of the masker is kept constant.  The masking effect is shown in each graph at various masker sound levels.

[[Image:auditoryfiltermaskersignal1.svg|thumb|left|Figure C – Adapted from Gelfand 2004&lt;ref name="Gelfand 2004"/&gt;]]
[[Image:off frequency mask diff freq1.svg|thumb|Figure D – Adapted from Gelfand 2004&lt;ref name="Gelfand 2004"/&gt;]]

Figure B shows along the Y axis the amount of masking.  The greatest masking is when the masker and the signal are the same frequency and this decreases as the signal frequency moves further away from the masker frequency.&lt;ref name="Gelfand 2004"/&gt; This phenomenon is called on-frequency masking and occurs because the masker and signal are within the same auditory filter (Figure C).  This means that the listener cannot distinguish between them and they are perceived as one sound with the quieter sound masked by the louder one (Figure D).

[[Image:maskersameauditoryfilter1.svg|thumb|left|Figure E – adapted from Moore 1998&lt;ref name="Moore 1998"/&gt;]]

The amount the masker raises the threshold of the signal is much less in off-frequency masking, but it does have some masking effect because some of the masker overlaps into the auditory filter of the signal (Figure E)&lt;ref name="Moore 1998"/&gt;

[[Image:onandofffreqlistening1.svg|thumb|Figure F – adapted from Moore 1998&lt;ref name="Moore 1998"/&gt;]]Off-frequency masking
requires the level of the masker to be greater in order to have a masking effect; this is shown in Figure F. This is because only a certain amount of the masker overlaps into the auditory filter of the signal and more masker is needed to cover the signal.&lt;ref name="Moore 1998"/&gt;{{clear}}

===Lower frequencies===
The masking pattern changes depending on the frequency of the masker and the intensity (Figure B).  For low levels on the 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz graph, such as the 20-40 dB range, the curve is relatively parallel.  As the masker intensity increases the curves separate, especially for signals at a frequency higher than the masker. This shows that there is a spread of the masking effect upward in frequency as the intensity of the masker is increased.  The curve is much shallower in the high frequencies than in the low frequencies.  This flattening is called upward spread of masking and is why an interfering sound masks high frequency signals much better than low frequency signals.&lt;ref name="Gelfand 2004"/&gt;

Figure B also shows that as the masker frequency increases, the masking patterns become increasingly compressed.  This demonstrates that high frequency maskers are only effective over a narrow range of frequencies, close to the masker frequency.  Low frequency maskers on the other hand are effective over a wide frequency range.&lt;ref name="Gelfand 2004"/&gt;

[[Image:maskercriticalbandwidth1.svg|thumb|Figure G – adapted from a diagram by Gelfand&lt;ref name="Gelfand 2004"/&gt;]]

[[Harvey Fletcher]] carried out an experiment to discover how much of a band of noise contributes to the masking of a tone.  In the experiment, a fixed tone signal had various bandwidths of noise centered on it.  The masked threshold was recorded for each bandwidth.  His research showed that there is a critical bandwidth of noise which causes the maximum masking effect and energy outside that band does not affect the masking.  This can be explained by the auditory system having an auditory filter which is centered over the frequency of the tone.  The bandwidth of the masker that is within this auditory filter effectively masks the tone but the masker outside of the filter has no effect (Figure G).

This is used in [[MP3]] files to reduce the size of audio files.  Parts of the signals which are outside the critical bandwidth are represented with reduced precision. The parts of the signals which are perceived by the listener are reproduced with higher fidelity.&lt;ref name="Sellars 2000"&gt;{{citation |author=Sellars, P. |year=2000 |title=Behind the Mask |place=Cambridge |publisher=Sound on Sound |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/may00/articles/mp3.htm |accessdate=26 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Varying intensity levels can also have an effect on masking. The lower end of the filter becomes flatter with increasing decibel level, whereas the higher end becomes slightly steeper. Changes in slope of the high frequency side of the filter with intensity are less consistent than they are at low frequencies. At the medium frequencies (1–4&amp;nbsp;kHz) the slope increases as intensity increases, but at the low frequencies there is no clear inclination with level and the filters at high center frequencies show a small decrease in slope with increasing level. The sharpness of the filter depends on the input level and not the output level to the filter.  The lower side of the auditory filter also broadens with increasing level.&lt;ref name="Moore 1998"/&gt;  These observations are illustrated in Figure H.

==Temporal masking==
Temporal masking or non-simultaneous masking occurs when a sudden stimulus sound makes inaudible other sounds which are present immediately preceding or following the stimulus.  Masking which obscures a sound immediately preceding the masker is called ''backward masking'' or ''pre-masking'' and masking which obscures a sound immediately following the masker is called ''forward masking'' or ''post-masking''.&lt;ref name="Moore 1998"/&gt;  Temporal masking's effectiveness attenuates exponentially from the onset and offset of the masker, with the onset attenuation lasting approximately 20 ms and the offset attenuation lasting approximately 100 ms.

Similar to simultaneous masking, temporal masking reveals the frequency analysis performed by the auditory system; forward masking thresholds for complex harmonic tones (e.g., a sawtooth probe with a [[fundamental frequency]] of 500 Hz) exhibit threshold peaks (i.e., high masking levels) for frequency bands centered on the first several harmonics.  In fact, auditory bandwidths measured from forward masking thresholds are narrower and more accurate than those measured using simultaneous masking.

Temporal masking should not be confused with the ear's [[acoustic reflex]], an involuntary response in the middle ear that is activated to protect the ear's delicate structures from loud sounds.

==Other masking conditions==
[[Image:ipsisimmasking.png|thumb|figure I – ipsilateral simultaneous masking]]

Ipsilateral ("same side") masking is not the only condition where masking takes place.  Another situation where masking occurs is called contralateral ("other side") simultaneous masking. In this case, the instance where the signal might be audible in one ear but is deliberately taken away by applying a masker to the other ear.

The last situation where masking occurs is called central masking.  This refers to the case where a masker causes a threshold elevation. This can be in the absence of, or in addition to, another effect and is due to interactions within the central nervous system between the separate neural inputs obtained from the masker and the signal.&lt;ref name="Gelfand 2004"/&gt;

==Effects of different stimulus types==
Experiments have been carried out to see the different masking effects when using a masker which is either in the form of a narrow band noise or a [[sinusoidal]] tone.

When a sinusoidal signal and a sinusoidal masker (tone) are presented simultaneously the envelope of the combined stimulus fluctuates in a regular pattern described as beats.  The fluctuations occur at a rate defined by the difference between the frequencies of the two sounds.  If the frequency difference is small then the sound is perceived as a periodic change in the loudness of a single tone.  If the beats are fast then this can be described as a sensation of roughness.  When there is a large frequency separation, the two components are heard as separate tones without roughness or beats.  Beats can be a cue to the presence of a signal even when the signal itself is not audible.  The influence of beats can be reduced by using a narrowband noise rather than a sinusoidal tone for either signal or masker.&lt;ref name="Moore 1986"/&gt;

==Mechanisms of masking==
There are many different mechanisms of masking, one being suppression. This is when there is a reduction of a response to a signal due to the presence of another. This happens because the original neural activity caused by the first signal is reduced by the neural activity of the other sound.&lt;ref name="Oxenham 1998"&gt;Oxenham, A.J. Plack, C.J. Suppression and the upward spread of masking, Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 104 (6) pp. 3500–10&lt;/ref&gt;

Combination tones are products of a signal and a masker. This happens when the two sounds interact causing new sound, which can be more audible than the original signal. This is caused by the non linear distortion that happens in the ear. For example, the combination tone of two maskers can be a better masker than the two original maskers alone.&lt;ref name="Moore 1998"/&gt;

The sounds interact in many ways depending on the difference in frequency between the two sounds. The most important two are cubic difference tones and quadratic difference tones.&lt;ref name="Moore 1998"/&gt;

Cubic difference tones are calculated by the sum

'''2F1 – F2'''&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Kyogu and Kim, Minjong. ''Estimating the Amplitude of the Cubic Difference Tone Using a Third-Order Adaptive Volterra Filter'', Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Digital Audio Effects (DAFx’05), Madrid, Spain, September 20-22, 2005, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt;

(F1 being the first frequency, F2 the second)
These are audible most of the time and especially when the level of the original tone is low. Hence they have a greater effect on psychoacoustic tuning curves than quadratic difference tones.

Quadratic difference tones are the result of

'''F2 – F1'''

This happens at relatively high levels hence have a lesser effect on psychoacoustic tuning curves.&lt;ref name="Moore 1998"/&gt;

Combination tones can interact with primary tones resulting in secondary combination tones due to being like their original primary tones in nature, stimulus like. An example of this is

'''3F1 – 2F2'''

Secondary combination tones are again similar to the combination tones of the primary tone.&lt;ref name="Moore 1998"/&gt;

==Off frequency listening==
Off frequency listening is when a listener chooses a filter just lower than the signal frequency to improve their auditory performance. This “off frequency” filter reduces the level of the masker more than the signal at the output level of the filter, which means they can hear the signal more clearly hence causing an improvement of auditory performance.&lt;ref name="Moore 2004"/&gt;
==Applications==
Auditory masking is used in [[tinnitus masker]]s to suppress annoying ringing, hissing, or buzzing or tinnitus often associated with hearing loss.  It is also used in various kinds of audiometry, including [[pure tone audiometry]], and the standard [[hearing test]] to test each ear unilaterally and to test speech recognition in the presence of partially masking noise.

Auditory masking is exploited to perform [[data compression]] for sound signals ([[MP3]]).

The '''Beef Hormone Dispute''' is one of the most intractable agricultural controversies since the establishment of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=223|title=Transatlantic Economic Disputes: The EU, the US, and the WTO|author1=Ernst-Ulrich Petersmann  |author2=Mark A. Pollack |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-926173-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has sometimes been called the '''"beef war"''' in the media,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/may2009/gb20090511_132665.htm "An End to the Beef War"], ''[[Business Week]],'' 11 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; similarly to the UK-EU [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#The ban on British beef|Beef war]] over the ''[[mad cow disease]]'' issue, creating some confusion, since these two wars overlapped in time.

In 1989, the [[European Union]] banned the importation of meat that contained artificial beef [[growth hormone]]s approved for use and administered in the United States. Originally, the ban covered six such hormones but was amended in 2003 to permanently ban one hormone —estradiol-17β — while provisionally banning the use of the five others.&lt;ref name=CRS&gt;{{cite web|title=The U.S.-EU Beef Hormone Dispute|website=Federation of American Scientists|publisher=Congressional Research Service|last1=Johnson|first1=Renée|url=https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R40449.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; WTO rules permit such bans, but only where a signatory presents valid scientific evidence that the ban is a health and safety measure.  Canada and the United States opposed this ban, taking the EU to the [[WTO Dispute Settlement Body]].  In 1997, the WTO [[Dispute Settlement Body]] ruled against the EU.&lt;ref name=Colgan&gt;{{cite book|title=The Promise And Peril of International Trade|author=Jeff Colgan|pages=126|year=2005|publisher=Broadview Press|isbn=1-55111-680-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Uniting Europe: European Integration and the Post-Cold War World|author=John Van Oudenaren|pages=251|year=2000|publisher=Rowman &amp;amp; Littlefield|isbn=0-8476-9032-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== EU ban and its background ===
The hormones banned by the EU in cattle farming were [[estradiol]], [[progesterone]], [[testosterone (medication)|testosterone]], [[zeranol]],  [[melengestrol acetate]] and [[trenbolone acetate]].  Of these, the first three are synthetic versions of [[endogeny|endogenous]] hormones that are naturally produced in humans and animals, and also occur in a wide range of foods, whereas the last two are synthetic and not naturally occurring, which mimic the behaviour of endogenous hormones.  Zeranol (alpha-zearalanol) is produced semi-synthetically, but it also occurs naturally in some foods.  It is one of several derivatives of zearalenone produced by certain Fusarium.&lt;ref&gt;Production of zearalenone, alpha and beta-zearalenol, and alpha- and beta-zearalanol by Fusarium. in rice culture.

Technol. 78: 21-37.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although its occurrence in animal products can be partly due to its ingestion in such feeds, alpha-zearalanol can also be produced endogenously in ruminants that have ingested zearalenone and some zearalenone derivatives in such feeds.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, C.

Zeranol is formed from Fusarium. toxins in cattle in vivo. Food Additives and Contaminants 15:  393-400.&lt;/ref&gt;  The EU did not impose an absolute ban.  Under veterinary supervision, cattle farmers were permitted to administer the synthetic versions of natural hormones for cost-reduction and possibly therapeutic purposes, such as synchronising the [[oestrus cycle]]s of dairy cows.  All six hormones were licensed for use in the US and in Canada.&lt;ref name=CCC&gt;{{cite book|chapter=9.

Under the [[Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures]], signatories have the right to impose restrictions on health and safety grounds subject to scientific analysis.  The heart of the Beef Hormone Dispute was the fact that all [[Risk analysis (engineering)|risk analysis]] is statistical in nature, and thus unable to determine with certainty the absence of health risks, and consequent disagreement between the US and Canada beef producers on the one hand, who believed that a broad scientific consensus existed that beef produced with the use of hormones was safe, and the EU on the other, which asserted that it was not safe.&lt;ref name=CCC /&gt;

The use of these hormones in cattle farming had been studied scientifically in North America for 50 years prior to the ban, and there had been widespread long-term use in over 20 countries.  Canada and the United States asserted that this provided empirical evidence both of long-term safety and of scientific consensus.&lt;ref name=CCC /&gt;

The EU ban was not, as it was portrayed to rural constituencies in the US and Canada, [[protectionism]].  The EU had already had other measures that effectively restricted the import of North American beef.  In the main, the North American product that the new ban affected, which existing barriers did not, was edible offal.&lt;ref name=Colgan /&gt;&lt;ref name=CCC /&gt;

It was not producers asking for protectionist measures who were pressuring the EU, but consumers, expressing concerns over the safety of hormone use.  There were a series of widely publicized "hormone scandals" in Italy in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  The first, in 1977, was signs of the premature onset of [[puberty]] in northern Italian schoolchildren, where investigators had cast suspicion in the direction of school lunches that had used meat farmed with the (illegal) use of [[growth hormone]]s.  No concrete evidence linking premature puberty to growth hormones was found, in part because no samples of the suspect meals were available for analysis.  But public anger arose at the use of such meat production techniques, to be further fanned by the discovery in 1980 of the (again illegal) presence of [[diethylstilbestrol]] (DES), another synthetic hormone, in veal-based baby foods.&lt;ref name=CCC /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://envirocancer.cornell.edu/Factsheet/Diet/fs37.hormones.cfm|title=Consumer Concerns About Hormones in Food|date=June 2000|publisher=Cornell University|author1=Renu Gandhi|author2=Suzanne M. Snedeker|lastauthoramp=yes|work=Program on Breast Cancer and Environmental Risk Factors|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719175735/http://envirocancer.cornell.edu/Factsheet/Diet/fs37.hormones.cfm|archivedate=19 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific evidence for health risks associated with the use of growth hormones in meat production was, at best, scant.  However, consumer lobbyist groups were far more able to successfully influence the [[European Parliament]] to enact regulations in the 1980s than producer lobbyist groups were, and had far more influence over public perceptions.  This is in contrast with the US at the time, where there was little interest from consumer organizations in the subject prior to the 1980s, and regulations were driven by a well-organized coalition of export-oriented industry and farming interests, who were only opposed by traditional farming groups.&lt;ref name=Caduff /&gt;

Until 1980, the use of growth hormones, both endogenous and exogenous, was completely prohibited in (as noted above) Italy, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Greece.  Germany, the largest beef producer in the EU at the time, prohibited just the use of exogenous growth hormones.  The five other member countries, including the second and third largest beef producers, France and the United Kingdom, permitted their use.  (The use of growth hormones was particularly common in the U.K., where beef production was heavily industrialized.) This had resulted in several disputes amongst member countries, with the countries that had no prohibitions arguing that the restrictions by the others acted as non-tariff trade barriers.  But in response to the public outcry in 1980, in combination with the contemporary discovery that DES was a [[teratogen]], the EU began to issue regulations, beginning with a directive prohibiting the use of [[Stilbenoid|stilbene]]s and [[Hyperthyroidism#Antithyroid drugs|thyrostatic]]s issued by the European Community [[Council of the European Union|Council of Agriculture Ministers]] in 1980, and the commissioning of a scientific study into the use of estradiol, testosterone, progesterone, trenbolone, and zeranol in 1981.&lt;ref name=Caduff /&gt;

The European Consumers' Organisation ([[BEUC]]) lobbied for a total ban upon growth hormones, opposed, with only partial success, by the pharmaceutical industry, which was not well organized at the time.  (It was not until 1987, at the instigation of US firms, that the [[European Federation of Animal Health]], FEDESA, was formed to represent at EU level the companies that, amongst other things, manufactured growth hormones.) Neither European farmers nor the meat processing industry took any stance on the matter.  With the help of the BEUC consumer [[boycott]]s of veal products, sparked in Italy by reports about DES in Italian magazines and in France and Germany by similar reports, spread from those three countries across the whole of the EU, causing companies such as [[Hipp (company)|Hipp]] and [[Alete (company)|Alete]] to withdraw their lines of veal products, and veal prices to drop significantly in France, Belgium, West Germany, Ireland, and the Netherlands.  Because of the fixed purchases guaranteed by the EU's [[Common Agricultural Policy]], there was a loss of [[European Currency Unit|ECU]] 10 million to the EU's budget.&lt;ref name=Caduff /&gt;

The imposition of a general ban was encouraged by the European Parliament, with a 1981 resolution passing by a majority of 177:1 in favour of a general ban.  [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s, having been directly elected for the first time in 1979, were taking the opportunity to flex their political muscles, and were in part using the public attention on the issue to strengthen the Parliament's rôle.  The Council of Ministers was divided along lines that directly matched each country's domestic stance on growth hormone regulation, with France, Ireland, the U.K., Belgium, Luxembourg, and Germany all opposing a general ban.  The [[European Commission]], leery of a veto by the Council and tightly linked to both pharmaceutical and (via Directorate VI) agricultural interests, presented factual arguments and emphasized the problem of trade barriers.&lt;ref name=Caduff /&gt;

=== 1998 WTO decision ===
The WTO Appellate Body affirmed the WTO Panel conclusion in a report adopted by the WTO [[Dispute Settlement Body]] on 13 February 1998.  Section 208 of this report says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[W]e find that the European Communities did not actually proceed to an assessment, within the meaning of Articles 5.1 and 5.2, of the risks arising from the failure of observance of good veterinary practice combined with problems of control of the use of hormones for growth promotion purposes.  The absence of such risk assessment, when considered in conjunction with the conclusion actually reached by most, if not all, of the scientific studies relating to the other aspects of risk noted earlier, leads us to the conclusion that no risk assessment that reasonably supports or warrants the import prohibition embodied in the EC Directives was furnished to the Panel.  We affirm, therefore, the ultimate conclusions of the Panel that the EC import prohibition is not based on a risk assessment within the meaning of Articles 5.1 and 5.2 of the SPS Agreement and is, therefore, inconsistent with the requirements of Article 5.1. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 12 July 1999, an arbitrator appointed by the WTO [[Dispute Settlement Body]] authorized the US to impose [[retaliatory tariffs]] of US$ 116.8 million per year on the EU.&lt;ref name=2017-trade-estimate&gt;{{citation|title=2017 National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers|pages=148–149|author=[[Office of the United States Trade Representative]]|date=March 2017|url=https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/files/reports/2017/NTE/2017%20NTE.pdf#page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== EU scientific risk assessments ===
In 2002 the EU Scientific Committee on Veterinary Measures relating to Public Health (SCVPH) claimed that the use of beef growth hormones posed a potential health risk, and in 2003 the EU enacted [http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2003/74/oj Directive 2003/74/EC] to amend its ban, but the US and Canada rejected that the EU had met WTO standards for scientific risk assessment.&lt;ref name=CRS/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Growth promoting hormones pose health risk to consumers, confirms EU Scientific Committee |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-02-604_en.htm?locale=en |location=Brussels |publisher=[[European Commission]] |agency= |date=23 April 2002 |access-date=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US and EU claim hormone case win|first=Alan|last=Beattie|date=1 April 2008|work=[[Financial Times]]|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a8574f16-ff85-11dc-b556-000077b07658.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EC made the scientific claim that the hormones used in treating cattle remain in the tissue, specifically the hormone, [[17-beta estradiol]].&lt;ref name="EFSA"&gt;{{citation|author=[[European Food Safety Authority]]|work=The EFSA Journal|title=Opinion of the Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain on a Request from the European Commission Related to Hormone Residues in Bovine Meat and Meat Products|url=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/scientific_output/files/main_documents/510.pdf|date=12 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite this evidence the EC declared there was no clear link to health risks in humans for the other five provisionally banned hormones. The EC has also found high amounts of hormones in areas where there are dense cattle lots. This increase in hormones in the water has affected waterways and nearby wild fish.&lt;ref name="EFSA"/&gt; Contamination of North American waterways by hormones would not, however, have any direct impact on European consumers or their health.

=== 2008 WTO decision ===
In November 2004, the EU requested WTO consultations, claiming that the United States should remove its retaliatory measures since the EU has removed the measures found to be WTO-inconsistent in the original case.&lt;ref name=CRS/&gt; In 2005, the EU initiated new WTO dispute settlement proceedings against the United States and Canada, and a March 2008 panel report cited fault with all three parties (EU, United States, and Canada) on various substantive and procedural aspects of the dispute.&lt;ref name=CRS/&gt; In October 2008, the WTO Appellate Body issued a mixed ruling that allows for continued imposition of trade sanctions on the EU by the United States and Canada, but also allows the EU to continue its ban on imports of hormone-treated beef.&lt;ref name=CRS/&gt;

In November 2008, the EU filed a new WTO challenge following the announcement by the USTR that it was seeking comment on possible modification of the list of EU products subject to increased tariffs under the dispute, and in January 2009 the USTR announced changes to the list of EU products subject to increased tariffs.&lt;ref name=CRS/&gt; In September 2009, the United States and the [[European Commission]] signed a memorandum of understanding, which established a new EU duty-free import quota for grain-fed, high quality beef (HQB) as part of a compromise solution.&lt;ref name=CRS/&gt; However, in December 2016, the US took steps to reinstate retaliatory tariffs on the list of EU products under the dispute given continued concerns about US beef access to the EU market.&lt;ref name=CRS/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Public Comments and Hearing Regarding Request To Reinstate Action Taken in Connection With the European Union's Measures Concerning Meat and Meat Products", {{FedReg|81|95724}}, December 28, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Obama Administration Takes Action to Address European Union’s Unfair Trade Practices against U.S. Beef Industry |url=https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2016/december/obama-administration-takes-action |location= |publisher=[[Office of the United States Trade Representative]] |agency= |date=December 2016 |access-date=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects upon policy in the EU ==
The EU often applies the [[precautionary principle]] very stringently in regards to food safety. The precautionary principle means that in a case of scientific uncertainty, the government may take appropriate measures proportionate to the potential risk (EC Regulation 178/2002). In 1996, the EU banned imported beef from the US and continued to do so after the 2003 Mad Cow scare. A more sophisticated risk assessment found there to be insufficient risk to ban certain hormones, but continued to ban others.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Haegen, Tony. European Commission Delegation. American Branch of the International Law Association. &lt;http://eurunion.org/eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2285&amp;Itemid=152&gt; archived at &lt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100702190714/http://www.eurunion.org/eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2285&amp;Itemid=152 web.archive.org/web/20100702190714/http://www.eurunion.org/eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2285&amp;Itemid=152]&gt;. New York. 23–25 Oct 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  Labeling of meat was another option, however warnings were also insufficient because of the criteria specified in the SPS (Sanitary and Phyto-Sanitary agreement). This agreement allows members to use scientifically based measures to protect public health. Most specifically the Equivalence provision in Article 4 which states the following: "an importing country must accept an SPS measure which differs from its own as equivalent if the exporting country’s measure provides the same level of health or environmental protection.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Donna. Agriculture in the WTO/WRS 98-44. Economic Research Service/USDA. Implementation of the WTO Agreement on the Application of the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures. &lt; http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/wrs984/wrs984d.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821110837/http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/wrs984/wrs984d.pdf |date=21 August 2011 }}.&gt; December 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;" Therefore, although the E.U. is a strong proponent of labels and banning meat that contains growth hormones, requiring the US to do the same would have violated this agreement.

== Effects upon public opinion in the US ==
One of the effects of the Beef Hormone Dispute in the US was to awaken the public's interest in the issue.  This interest was not wholly unsympathetic to the EU.  In 1989, for example, the [[Consumer Federation of America]] and the [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]] both pressed for an adoption of a ban within the US similar to that within the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hormones in meat: what are the real issues?|work=Prepared Foods|date=1 March 1989|author=Daniel Best|publisher=Business News Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; US consumers appear to be less concerned with the use of synthetic chemicals in food production. Because of current policy, in which all beef is allowed whether produced with hormones or genetically modified, US consumers now have to rely on their own judgment when buying goods. However, in a study done in 2002, 85% of respondents wanted mandatory labeling on beef produced with growth hormones.&lt;ref&gt;Lusk, Jayson; Fox, John.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2349">In the formulation of [[convenience food|food products]], the '''bliss point''' is the amount of an ingredient such as [[salt]], [[sugar]], or [[fat]] which optimizes [[tastiness]]. Pioneering work on the bliss point was carried out by American [[market research]]er and [[Psychophysics|psychophysicist]] [[Howard Moskowitz]], known for his successful work in product creation and optimization for foods ranging from spaghetti sauce to [[soft drink]]s.&lt;ref name=NYTMag022013&gt;{{cite news|title=The Extraordinary Science of Addictive Junk Food|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/magazine/the-extraordinary-science-of-junk-food.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=March 1, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times Magazine|date=February 20, 2013|author=Michael Moss}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moskowitz describes the bliss point as "that sensory profile where you like food the most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wildt|first1=Grace|title=The Bliss Point|url=http://www.retroreport.org/voices/the-bliss-point/|website=Retro Report|publisher=Retro Report|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bliss point for salt, sugar, or fat is a range within which perception is that there is neither too much nor too little, but the "just right" amount of saltiness, sweetness, or richness. The human body has evolved to favor foods delivering these tastes: the brain responds with a "reward" in the form of a jolt of [[endorphin]]s, remembers what we did to get that reward, and makes us want to do it again, an effect run by [[dopamine]], the [[neurotransmitter]]. Combinations of sugar, fat, and salt act [[synergistic]]ally, and are more rewarding than any one alone. In food product optimization, the goal is to include two or three of these nutrients at their bliss point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://courses.bio.indiana.edu/L104-Bonner/F12/imagesF12/L8/BlissPoint.html | title=Biology of Food: The Bliss Point | publisher=Indiana University (Department of Biology) | archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcourses.bio.indiana.edu%2FL104-Bonner%2FF12%2FimagesF12%2FL8%2FBlissPoint.html&amp;date=2015-04-03 | archive-date=4 March 2015 |accessdate=2 April 2015}} From Biology of Food, Dept. of Biology, Indiana University.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Human skeleton|human skeletal system]] is a complex organ in constant equilibrium with the rest of the body. In addition to support and structure of the body, [[bone]] is the major reservoir for many minerals and compounds essential for maintaining a healthy [[pH]] balance.&lt;ref name="Barzel Review"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barzel|first=US|author2=Massey, LK|title=Excess dietary protein can adversely affect bone.|journal=The Journal of Nutrition|date=June 1998|volume=128|issue=6|pages=1051–3|pmid=9614169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deterioration of the body with age renders the elderly particularly susceptible to and affected by poor '''bone health'''. Illnesses like [[osteoporosis]], characterized by weakening of the bone’s structural matrix, increases the risk of [[Hip fracture|hip-fractures]] and other life-changing secondary symptoms. In 2010, over 258,000 people aged 65 and older were admitted to the hospital for hip fractures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS)|url=http://205.207.175.93/hdi/ReportFolders/ReportFolders.aspx?IF_ActivePath=P,18|publisher=National Center for Health Statistics|accessdate=24 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131130200106/http://205.207.175.93/hdi/ReportFolders/ReportFolders.aspx?IF_ActivePath=P,18|archivedate=30 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incidence of hip fractures is expected to rise by 12% in America, with a projected 289,000 admissions in the year 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stevens|first=JA|author2=Rudd, RA|title=The impact of decreasing U.S. hip fracture rates on future hip fracture estimates.|journal=Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA|date=October 2013|volume=24|issue=10|pages=2725–8|pmid=23632827|doi=10.1007/s00198-013-2375-9|pmc=4717482}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources estimate up to 1.5 million Americans will have an osteoporotic-related fracture each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hyson|first=DA|title=A comprehensive review of apples and apple components and their relationship to human health.|journal=Advances in Nutrition|date=September 2011|volume=2|issue=5|pages=408–20|pmid=22332082|doi=10.3945/an.111.000513|pmc=3183591}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of treating these people is also enormous, in 1991 [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] spent an estimated $2.9 billion for treatment and out-patient care of hip fractures, this number can only be expected to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Incidence and costs to Medicare of fractures among Medicare beneficiaries aged &gt;65 years—United States, July 1991–June 1992|journal=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|year=1996|volume=45|series=MMWR|issue=41|pages=877–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amino Acid Metabolism==
When more sulfur containing [[amino acids]], [[methionine]] and [[cystine]], are consumed than the body can use for growth and repair, they are broken down yielding [[sulfate]], or [[sulfuric acid]] among other products. Animal foods such as meat, dairy, and eggs are high in protein and “dietary animal protein intake is highly correlated with renal net acid excretion”.&lt;ref name="Sellmeyer" &gt;{{cite journal|last=Sellmeyer|first=DE|author2=Stone, KL |author3=Sebastian, A |author4= Cummings, SR |title=A high ratio of dietary animal to vegetable protein increases the rate of bone loss and the risk of fracture in postmenopausal women.

C.|author2=Gettler, A. O.|title=The balance of acid-forming and base-forming elements in foods, and its relation to ammonia metabolism|journal=Experimental Biology and Medicine|date=1 May 1911|volume=8|issue=5|pages=119–120|doi=10.3181/00379727-8-71}}&lt;/ref&gt; One measure of the acidic or basic effects foods have in the body is Potential Renal Acid Load (PRAL). [[Cheeses]] with protein content of 15 g protein/100g or higher have a high PRAL value of 23.6 mEq/100 g edible portion. Meats, fish, other cheeses and flour or noodles all have a PRAL around 8.0 mEq/100 g edible portion, where fruits and vegetables actually have a negative PRAL.&lt;ref name="Barzel Review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Remer" &gt;{{cite journal|last=Remer|first=T|author2=Manz, F|title=Potential renal acid load of foods and its influence on urine pH.|journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association|date=July 1995|volume=95|issue=7|pages=791–7|pmid=7797810|doi=10.1016/S0002-8223(95)00219-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:Met and Cys Degradation Pathway.jpg|center|Methionine and Cystine Degradation Pathway]]
 
In healthy adults, [[bone]] is undergoing constant repair and renewal. New bone is deposited by [[osteoblast]] cells and resorbed or destroyed by [[osteoclast]] cells. This addition and subtraction of bone usually yields no net change in the overall mass of the skeleton, but the turnover process can be significantly affected by pH.&lt;ref name="Barzel Review"/&gt;

===Bone Mineral Density===
[[Bone density|Bone Mineral Density]] (BMD) is a measure commonly used to quantify bone health. A lower BMD value indicates an increased risk of a [[osteoporosis]] or a fracture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lips|first=P|title=Epidemiology and predictors of fractures associated with osteoporosis.|journal=The American Journal of Medicine|date=Aug 18, 1997|volume=103|issue=2A|pages=3S-8S; discussion 8S-11S|pmid=9302892|doi=10.1016/s0002-9343(97)90021-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a large range of factors influencing BMD. Protein consumption has shown to be beneficial for bone density by providing amino acid substrates necessary for bone matrix formation. It is also thought that blood concentration of the bone formation stimulant, [[Insulin-like growth factor 1|Insulin-like Growth Factor-I]] (IGF-I), is increased from high protein consumption and [[parathyroid hormone]] (PTH), a bone resorption stimulant, is decreased.&lt;ref name="cao review" /&gt; Although protein has shown to be beneficial for increasing bone mass, or bone mineral density, there is no significant association between protein intake and fracture incidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kerstetter|first=JE|title=Dietary protein and bone: a new approach to an old question.|journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|date=December 2009|volume=90|issue=6|pages=1451–2|pmid=19864406|doi=10.3945/ajcn.2009.28812}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a low BMD can be predictive of osteoporosis and increased fracture risk, but a higher BMD does not necessarily mean better bone health. High BMD is also correlated with other health issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gregson|first=CL|author2=Hardcastle, SA |author3=Cooper, C |author4= Tobias, JH |title=Friend or foe: high bone mineral density on routine bone density scanning, a review of causes and management.|journal=Rheumatology (Oxford, England)|date=June 2013|volume=52|issue=6|pages=968–85|pmid=23445662|doi=10.1093/rheumatology/ket007 |pmc=3651616}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a higher BMD has also been associated with increased risk of breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lucas|first=FL|author2=Cauley, JA |author3=Stone, RA |author4=Cummings, SR |author5=Vogt, MT |author6=Weissfeld, JL |author7= Kuller, LH |title=Bone mineral density and risk of breast cancer: differences by family history of breast cancer.

===Acid-Base Homeostasis===
[[image:PRAL of common foods.jpg|thumb|PRAL of Common Foods]]
Most metabolic processes have a specific and narrow range of pH where operation is possible, multiple regulatory systems are in place to maintain [[homeostasis]]. Fluctuations away from optimal operating pH can slow or impair reactions and possibly cause damage to cellular structures or proteins. To maintain homeostasis the body may excrete excess acid or base through the [[urine]], via [[gas exchange]] in the lungs, or buffer it in the blood.&lt;ref name="Arnett" /&gt; The [[bicarbonate buffering system]] of blood plasma effectively holds a steady pH and helps to hold [[extracellular]] pH around 7.35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bonjour|first=JP|title=Nutritional disturbance in acid-base balance and osteoporosis: a hypothesis that disregards the essential homeostatic role of the kidney.|journal=The British Journal of Nutrition|date=October 2013|volume=110|issue=7|pages=1168–77|pmid=23551968|doi=10.1017/S0007114513000962|pmc=3828631}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[kidneys]] are responsible for the majority of acid-base regulation but can excrete urine no lower than a pH of 5. This means that a 330mL can of cola, for example, usually ranging in pH from 2.8 - 3.2, would need to be diluted 100 fold before being excreted. Instead of producing 33L of urine from one can of cola, the body relies on buffer to neutralize the acid.&lt;ref name="Barzel Review"/&gt; Systemic acidosis can be the result of multiple factors, not just diet. [[Anaerobic exercise]], [[diabetes]], [[AIDS]], aging, [[menopause]], [[inflammation]], [[infections]], [[tumours]], and other wounds and fractures all contribute to acidosis. Blood has an average pH of 7.40 but interstitial fluid can vary. Interstitial pH of the skin, for example, is ~7.1. There is no data available for bone.&lt;ref name="Arnett2" &gt;{{cite journal|last=Arnett|first=TR|title=Extracellular pH regulates bone cell function.|journal=The Journal of Nutrition|date=February 2008|volume=138|issue=2|pages=415S-418S|pmid=18203913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homocysteine===
[[Homocysteine]], a non-protein amino acid and analogue to the protein amino acid [[cystine]], has been shown to have negative effects on bone health. Higher homocysteine concentrations are likely a result of [[folate]], [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[Vitamin B6|B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] deficiencies. In addition, it was found that homocysteine concentration was significantly affected by physical activity. The stimulation of the skeleton through physical activity promotes positive bone remodelling and decreases levels of homocysteine, independently from nutritional intake. Four methods have been proposed regarding the interaction of homocysteine and bone; increase in [[osteoclast]] activity, decrease in [[osteoblast]] activity, decrease in bone blood flow, and direct action of homocysteine on bone matrix. Homocysteine inhibits [[lysyl oxidase]] which is responsible for [[post-translational modifications]] of [[collagen]], a key component to bone structure&lt;ref name="Vacek" /&gt;

===Osteoclast Cells===
[[image:Osteoclast.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Micrograph|Light micrograph]] of an osteoclast displaying typical distinguishing characteristics: a large cell with multiple nuclei and a "foamy" cytosol.]]
[[Osteoclasts]] are located on the surface of bones and form resorption pits by excreting H+ to the bone surface removing [[hydroxyapatite]], multiple bone minerals, and organic components: [[collagen]] and [[dentin]]. The purpose of bone resorption is to release [[calcium]] to the blood stream for various life processes.&lt;ref name="Vacek" &gt;{{cite journal|last=Vacek|first=TP|author2=Kalani, A |author3=Voor, MJ |author4=Tyagi, SC |author5= Tyagi, N |title=The role of homocysteine in bone remodeling.|journal=Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine : CCLM / FESCC|date=Mar 1, 2013|volume=51|issue=3|pages=579–90|pmid=23449525|doi=10.1515/cclm-2012-0605 |pmc=3951268}}&lt;/ref&gt; These resorption pits are visible under [[electron microscopy]] and distinctive trails are formed from prolonged resorption. Osteoclasts have shown to be “absolutely dependent on extracellular acidification”.&lt;ref name="Arnett" &gt;{{cite journal|last=Arnett|first=T|title=Regulation of bone cell function by acid-base balance.|journal=The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society|date=May 2003|volume=62|issue=2|pages=511–20|pmid=14506899|doi=10.1079/pns2003268}}&lt;/ref&gt; A drop in pH of &lt;0.1 units can cause a 100% increase in osteoclast cell activity, this effect persists with prolonged acidosis with no desensitization, “amplifying the effects of modest pH differences”. Osteoclast cells show little or no activity at pH 7.4 and are most active at pH 6.8 but can be further stimulated by other factors such as [[parathyroid hormone]].&lt;ref name="Arnett2" /&gt;

===Osteoblast Cells===
[[image:Bone hypercalcemia - cropped - very high mag.jpg|thumb|350px|Osteoblast Cells]]
[[Osteoblast]] are responsible for the mineralization and construction of bone matrix. Like osteoclast cells, osteoblast cell activity is directly related to extracellular pH mirroring of osteoclast activity. At pH 7.4, where osteoclasts are inactive, osteoblast are at peak activity. Likewise, at pH 6.9 osteoblast activity is non-existent.&lt;ref name="Arnett2" /&gt; The hormone [[estrogen]] is also important for osteoblast regulation. In postmenopausal women estrogen levels are decreased which has negative effects on bone remodelling. [[Homocysteine]] further exacerbates this problem by reducing estrogen receptor α mRNA transcription. Thus reducing any beneficial effect that estrogen plays on bone remodelling.&lt;ref name="Vacek" /&gt;

==Bone Balance==
Acidosis inhibits bone [[osteoblast]] matrix mineralization with reciprocal effect on [[osteoclast]] activation. The combined responses of these cells to acidosis maximizes the availability of hydroxyl ions in solution that can be used to buffer protons.&lt;ref name="Arnett2" /&gt; The utilization of bone to buffer even a small percentage of daily acid production can lead to significant loss of bone mass in the course of a decade.&lt;ref name="Sellmeyer" /&gt; Additionally, as the body ages there is a steady decline in [[renal]] function. [[Metabolic acidosis]] can become more severe as kidney function weakens, and the body will depend more heavily on bone and blood to maintain acid-base homeostasis.&lt;ref name="cao review" /&gt;

==Diet==
There is no one food or nutrient capable of providing adequate bone health on its own. Instead, a balanced diet sufficient in fruits and vegetables for their vitamins, minerals, and alkalinizing substrates is thought to be most beneficial. High protein diets supply larger amounts of amino acids that could be degraded to acidic compounds. Protein consumption above the Recommended Dietary Allowance is also known to be beneficial to calcium utilization. Overall it is understood that high-protein diets have a net benefit for bone health because changes in IGF-I and PTH concentrations outweigh the negative effects of metabolic acid production.&lt;ref name="cao review" &gt;{{cite journal|last=Cao|first=JJ|author2=Nielsen, FH|title=Acid diet (high-meat protein) effects on calcium metabolism and bone health.|journal=Current Opinion in Clinical Nutrition and Metabolic Care|date=November 2010|volume=13|issue=6|pages=698–702|pmid=20717017|doi=10.1097/MCO.0b013e32833df691}}&lt;/ref&gt; The source of protein, plant or animal, does not matter in terms of acid produced from amino acid metabolism. Any differences in [[Methionine]] and [[Cysteine]] content is not significant to affect the overall potential renal acid load (PRAL) of the food. In addition to their acid precursor protein content, plants also contain significant amounts of base precursors. [[Potassium bicarbonate]], a basic salt, is produced via the metabolism of other organic potassium salts: [[citrate]], [[malate]], and [[gluconate]], which are substantial in plants. The discrepancy observed in PRAL is accounted for by differences in base precursor content.&lt;ref name="Sellmeyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Remer" /&gt;

'''Capital punishment in Australia''' was a form of [[punishment in Australia]] that has been abolished in all jurisdictions. [[Queensland]] abolished the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] in 1922. [[Tasmania]] did the same in 1968, the [[Government of Australia|federal government]] abolished the death penalty in 1973, with application also in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] did so in 1975, [[South Australia]] in 1976, and [[Western Australia]] in 1984. [[New South Wales]] abolished the death penalty for murder in 1955, and for all crimes in 1985. In 2010, the federal government passed legislation prohibiting the re-establishment of capital punishment by any state or territory.&lt;ref name=endofdeathpenalty&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.theage.com.au/breaking-news-national/death-penalty-dead-and-buried-20100311-q0xd.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Death penalty dead and buried | date=11 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the Commonwealth nor any of the states will extradite or deport a prisoner to another jurisdiction if they will face the death penalty, and police co-operation with other countries which have the death penalty has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AFP Governance: AFP National Guideline on international police-to-police assistance in death penalty situations |url=https://www.afp.gov.au/sites/default/files/PDF/IPS/AFP%20National%20Guideline%20on%20international%20police-to-police%20assistance%20in%20death%20penalty%20situations.pdf|publisher=Australian Federal Police|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Finlay|first1=Lorraine|title=Exporting the Death Penalty?

The last execution in Australia took place in 1967, when [[Ronald Ryan]] was [[hanged]] in Victoria. Between Ryan's execution in 1967 and 1984, several more people were sentenced to death, but had their sentences commuted to [[life imprisonment]]. The last death sentence was given in August 1984, when [[Brenda Hodge]] was sentenced to death in Western Australia (and subsequently had her sentence commuted to life imprisonment). 

==History==
[[File:Map Of Capital Punishment in Australia.png|500px|right|Map featuring the year of the last execution and the year of abolition]]

Death sentences were carried out under Aboriginal customary law, either directly or through [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]].  In some cases the condemned could be denied mortuary rites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrc.justice.wa.gov.au/2publications/reports/ACL/DP/Part_05B.pdf Traditional Aboriginal Law and Punishment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306120333/http://www.lrc.justice.wa.gov.au/2publications/reports/ACL/DP/Part_05B.pdf |date=6 March 2009 }} – Part V – Aboriginal Customary Law and the Criminal Justice System, Law Reform Commission of Western Australia – Aboriginal Customary Laws Discussion Paper&lt;/ref&gt;  The first executions carried out under European law in Australia took place in Western Australia in 1629, when Dutch authorities hanged the mutineers of the ''[[Batavia (ship)|Batavia]]''.

Capital punishment had been part of the legal system of Australia since British settlement. During the 19th century, crimes that could carry a death sentence included burglary, sheep stealing, forgery, sexual assaults, murder and manslaughter, and there is one reported case of someone being executed for "being illegally at large". During the 19th century, these crimes saw about 80 people hanged each year throughout Australia.

Before and after federation, each state made its own criminal laws and punishments. For a full list see: {{Main article|List of people legally executed in Australia}}

===Commonwealth===
In 1973 the [[Death Penalty Abolition Act 1973]]{{ref|DPAA}} of the Commonwealth abolished the death penalty for federal offences. It provided in Section 3 that the Act applied to any offence against a law of the Commonwealth, the Territories or under an Imperial Act, and in s. 4 that "[a] person is not liable to the punishment of death for any offence".

No executions were carried out under the bridge of the [[Government of Australia|federal government]], and the passage of the Death Penalty Abolition Act 1973{{ref|DPAA}} saw the death penalty replaced with [[life imprisonment]] as their maximum punishment. Since the Commonwealth effects of utilising this Act, no more individuals have been exposed to the death penalty. On 11 March 2010, Federal Parliament passed laws that prevent the death penalty from being reintroduced by any state or territory in Australia.&lt;ref name=endofdeathpenalty/&gt;

Neither the Commonwealth nor any of the states will extradite or deport a prisoner to another jurisdiction if they will face the death penalty. 

A recent case involving this was the case of American Gabe Watson, who was convicted of the [[Death of Tina Watson|manslaughter of his wife]] in North Queensland, and faced capital murder charges in his home state of Alabama.  His deportation was delayed until the government received assurances that he would not be executed if found guilty.

===New South Wales===
The last execution in New South Wales was carried out on 24 August 1939, when John Trevor Kelly was hanged at Sydney's [[Long Bay Correctional Centre]] for the murder of Marjorie Constance Sommarlad.  New South Wales abolished the death penalty for murder in 1955, but retained it as a potential penalty for [[treason]], [[piracy]], and [[Arson in royal dockyards|arson in naval dockyards]] until 1985. New South Wales was the last Australian state to formally abolish the death penalty for all crimes.

===Victoria===
[[File:Long drop gallow.JPG|thumb|right|Old Melbourne Gaol gallows]]
Victoria’s first executions occurred in 1842 when two Aboriginal men, [[Tunnerminnerwait]] and Maulboyheenner, were hanged outside the site of the Melbourne Gaol for the killing of two whalers in the Westernport district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://museumvictoria.com.au/marvellous/early/british.asp|title=British Justice|publisher=Museum Victoria Australia|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronald Ryan]] was the last man executed at Pentridge Prison and in Australia. He was hanged on 3 February 1967 after being convicted of the shooting dead a prison officer during an escape from [[HM Prison Pentridge|Pentridge Prison]], Coburg, [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in 1965.
Ryan was the last of 186 executions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cosmos.bcst.yahoo.com/up/player/popup/?rn=3906861&amp;cl=4257221&amp;ch=4226714&amp;src=news The Hanging of Ronald Ryan:40 Years Later] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228191052/http://cosmos.bcst.yahoo.com/up/player/popup/?rn=3906861 |date=28 December 2007 }}. Cosmos.bcst.yahoo.com (2009-08-27). Retrieved on 2012-09-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Victoria was also the state of the last woman executed in Australia: [[Jean Lee (murderer)|Jean Lee]] was hanged in 1951. She was accused of being an accomplice in the murder of 73-year-old William ('Pop') Kent. She, along with her accomplices, were executed on 19 February 1951. Victoria would not carry out another execution until that of Ronald Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/lee-jean-10804 Biography – Jean Lee – Australian Dictionary of Biography]. Adb.anu.edu.au. Retrieved on 2012-09-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all those executed were murderers: for instance, Albert McNamara was hanged for arson causing death in 1902, and David Bennett was hanged in 1932 after being convicted of raping a four-year-old girl. Bennett was the last man to be hanged in Australia for an offence other than murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prisoner hanged|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/16890688|accessdate=3 December 2017|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=27 September 1932|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This number includes triple murderer [[Edward Leonski]], executed by the [[U.S. Army]] in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leonski executed |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/144200510|accessdate=3 December 2017|work=Daily Advertiser|date=10 November 1942|location=Wagga Wagga, NSW|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The beam used to execute condemned prisoners was removed from [[Old Melbourne Gaol]] and installed in D Division at [[HM Prison Pentridge|Pentridge Prison]] by the condemned child rapist David Bennett, who was a carpenter by trade. It was used for all 10 Pentridge hangings (including a double hanging).  After Victoria abolished capital punishment in 1975, the beam was removed and put into storage, and was reinstalled at the Old Melbourne Gaol in August 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kellycountry2000.com/executionsinvictoria.html Executions in the State of Victoria ned kelly] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008193912/http://www.kellycountry2000.com/executionsinvictoria.html |date=8 October 2011 }}. kellycountry2000.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Queensland===
A total of 94 people were hanged in the Moreton Bay/Queensland region from 1830 until 1913.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boggoroadgaol.com.au/HistoryHanging.html 'Queensland Executions'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613110630/http://www.boggoroadgaol.com.au/HistoryHanging.html |date=13 June 2015 }}, Boggo Road Gaol Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt; The last person hanged was [[Ernest Austin (murderer)|Ernest Austin]] on 22 September 1913 for the rape and murder of 11-year-old Ivy Mitchell. 

The only woman to be hanged was Ellen Thompson on 13 June 1887; she was hanged alongside her lover, John Harrison, for murdering her husband William.

In 1922, Queensland became the first part of the British Commonwealth to abolish the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, Christopher, [http://www.boggoroadgaol.com.au/Books/PitofShame.html "A Pit of Shame: The Executed Prisoners of Boggo Road"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613095824/http://www.boggoroadgaol.com.au/Books/PitofShame.html |date=13 June 2015 }}, Inside History, Brisbane, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Australia===
In [[Western Australia]], the first legal executions were under [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch VOC]] law on 2 October 1629 on Long Island, [[Houtman Abrolhos]] (near [[Geraldton]]), when [[Jeronimus Corneliszoon]] and six others were hanged as party to the murders of 125 men, women and children.

Following British colonization, between 1833 and 1855 executions by firing squad and hanging were performed at a variety of places, often at the site of the offence. Even with the construction of the new [[Perth Gaol]] in 1855 as the main execution site in the state, executions were also carried out at various country locations until 1900. In 1886 the [[Fremantle Prison]] was handed over to the colonial government as the colony's major prison; from 1889 43 men (and one woman, [[Martha Rendell]]) were hanged there.

The first execution under British law was that of [[Midgegooroo]], who on 22 May 1833 was executed by firing squad while bound to the door of the original Perth Gaol. [[John Gavin (convict)|John Gavin]], a  [[Parkhurst apprentices|Parkhurst apprentice]], was the first British settler to be executed in Western Australia. In 1844 he was hanged for murder at the Fremantle [[Round House (Western Australia)|Round House]], at the age of fifteen. Bridget Larkin was the first woman to be executed in Western Australia, for the [[murder of John Hurford]], in 1855.

The last execution was that of [[Eric Edgar Cooke]] on 26 October 1964 at [[Fremantle Prison]]. Cooke had been convicted on one count of murder, but evidence and his confessions suggested he had committed many more. The last sentence of death in Western Australia was passed in 1984,&lt;ref name="emsah"&gt;[http://www.emsah.uq.edu.au/awsr/new_site/awbr_archive/140/walkon.htm Sentenced at Birth].

Capital punishment was formally removed from the statutes of the state with the passage of the Acts Amendment (Abolition of Capital Punishment) Act 1984.

===South Australia===
The [[Adelaide Gaol]] was the site of forty-four hangings, from Joseph Stagg on 18 November 1840 to [[Glen Sabre Valance]], murderer and rapist, on 24 November 1964. Three executions also occurred at [[Mount Gambier Gaol]].

Two [[Ngarrindjeri]] men were controversially executed by hanging along the [[Coorong]] on 22 August 1840, after a [[drumhead court-martial]] conducted by [[SAPOL|Police]] [[Police commissioner|Commissioner]] [[Thomas Shuldham O'Halloran|O'Halloran]] on the orders of [[Governor of South Australia|Governor]] [[George Gawler]]. The men were found to be guilty of murdering the twenty-five survivors of the shipwreck ''[[Maria (brigantine)|Maria]]'' a few months before.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/backyard/shipwrecks/sa/mariacreek.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elizabeth Woolcock]], the only woman ever to have been executed under South Australian law, was hanged on 30 December 1873. Her body was not released to the family and was buried between the inner and outer walls of the prison, identified by a number and the date of the execution.

In 1976, the ''Criminal Law Consolidation Act'' was modified so that the death sentence was changed to life imprisonment.

===Tasmania===
In the early days of colonial rule Tasmania, then known as [[Van Diemen's Land]], was the site of penal transports. [[Mary McLauchlan]] was convicted in 1830 for infanticide; she was sentenced to both death and dissection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utas.edu.au/library/companion_to_tasmanian_history/P/Public%20executions.htm Public Executions].

The last execution was on February 14 1946, when serial rapist and killer Frederick Thompson was hanged for the murder of eight-year-old Evelyn Maughan. The death penalty was abolished in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Helen MacDonald | title=Human remains: Dissection and Its Histories | publisher= Yale University Press | year=2005 |ISBN =978-0-300-11699-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australian Capital Territory===
No executions were carried out in the Australian Capital Territory, where federal legislation abolished capital punishment in 1973.

===Northern Territory===

There were nine executions between 1893 and 1952. Seven of them took place at Fannie Bay Gaol, the other two at regional locations close to where the crime took place.

The last execution in the Northern Territory was a double hanging at Fannie Bay Gaol on 8 August 1952. The death penalty was abolished in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Two executed|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/49473630|accessdate=3 December 2017|work=Northern Standard|date=8 August 1952|location=Darwin, NT|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public opinion==
In Australia capital punishment was banned on a state-by-state basis through the 20th century. Despite the ban, polls have indicated varying support for the reintroduction of the practice. A 2005 [[The Bulletin|Bulletin]] poll showed that most Australians supported capital punishment. The [[Australian National University]]'s 2007 Electoral Survey found that 44 per cent of people thought the death penalty should be reintroduced, while only 38 per cent disagreed. In the recent case of the [[Bali bombers]], then [[Prime Minister of Australia|prime minister]] [[John Howard]] stated that Australians expected their execution by Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=George|title=No death penalty, no shades of grey|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-opinion/no-death-penalty-no-shades-of-grey-20100301-pdgo.html|accessdate=3 December 2017|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/national/australians-expect-bali-bomber-executions-says-pm/2007/10/12/1191696212696.html Australians expect Bali bomber executions, says PM] By Sarah Smiles Canberra and Mark Forbes, 13 October 2007, Brisbane Times&lt;/ref&gt;

On occasion the issue of capital punishment is published in the media or is subject to media and public support and scrutiny. Most occasions where capital punishment is brought up in the media, it is regarding current cases of intense media coverage regarding murder, rape and in extreme circumstances such as terrorism. On various occasions, the media and public express support for capital punishment for the most heinous of crimes  including mass murder such as in the cases of the [[Backpacker Murders|Milat Backpacker Murders]] and the [[Port Arthur massacre (Australia)|Bryant Port Arthur massacre]], in which a total of 42 people were killed stirring strong emotions as to whether or not to reintroduce the death penalty. A similar surge in public support for reintroduction occurred when Lindy Chamberlain was convicted of murdering her baby Azaria in 1982, although it was subsequently shown that she was not guilty. This miscarriage of justice has been used as a powerful example of the risks of the death penalty. However, no person of significant stature or influence has advocated the death penalty for quite some time since the last execution in 1967.  The death penalty was completely abolished in Australia with the ''Crimes Legislation Amendment (Torture Prohibition and Death Penalty Abolition) Bill 2009'' passing the [[Australian Senate]] without amendments in March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/death-penalty-dead-and-buried-as-parliasment-bans-it-for-good/story-e6frf7l6-1225839834244 Death penalty dead and buried as Parliament bans it for good]. Herald Sun (2010-03-12).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 a public opinion survey was conducted by [[Roy Morgan Research]] where responders were given the question: "In your opinion, should the penalty for murder be death or imprisonment?" The surveyors conducted the poll for people from 14 and onwards in age with around 687 people completing the survey for publication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roymorgan.com/findings/finding-4411-201302260051 "Australians say penalty for murder should be Imprisonment (64%) rather than the Death Penalty (23%)"], [[Roy Morgan Research]], 27 August 2009.

In 2014 another public opinion survey was conducted by Roy Morgan Research where responders were given the question: “If a person is convicted of a terrorist act in Australia which kills someone should the penalty be death?” The surveyors conducted the poll with a cross-section of 1,307 Australians. The poll showed a small majority of Australians (52.5%) favoured the death penalty for deadly terrorist acts in Australia while 47.5% didn’t. This was a significant increase from 2009 when only 23% of Australians supported the death penalty being imposed for convicted murderers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Small majority of Australians favour the death penalty for deadly terrorist acts in Australia |url=http://www.roymorgan.com/findings/5814-death-penalty-for-terrorist-acts-september-19-2014-201409190533 |website=Roy Morgan|publisher=Roy Morgan Research Ltd|accessdate=3 December 2017 |location=Melbourne, Vic.|date=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cardiac fibroma''', also known as cardiac fibromatosis, is a rare [[benign tumor]] of the [[heart]] that occurs primarily in infants and children. [[Benign tumor]]s are typically a solitary, firm grey-white, non-encapsulated tumor that is composed of [[Fiber|fibrous]] and dense [[connective tissue]].&lt;ref name="pmid25027414"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cronin B, Lynch MJ, Parsons S | title = Cardiac fibroma presenting as sudden unexpected death in an adolescent | journal = Forensic Sci Med Pathol | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 647–50 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25027414 | doi = 10.1007/s12024-014-9582-3 |issn = 1547-769X }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most commonly located in the [[interventricular septum]] or left [[ventricle (heart)|ventricular]] wall. [[Symptom]]s depend on the size of the tumor, its location relative to the [[electrical conduction system of the heart|conduction system]], and whether it obstructs [[blood flow]]. Two-thirds of children with this tumor are [[asymptomatic]], showing no signs and symptoms. [[Symptomatic]] cardiac fibromas may be treated by [[surgical]] [[segmental resection|resection]].&lt;ref name="pmid7967668"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burke AP, Rosado-de-Christenson M, Templeton PA, Virmani R | title = Cardiac fibroma: clinicopathologic correlates and surgical treatment | journal = J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg. | volume = 108 | issue = 5 | pages = 862–70 | date = November 1994 | pmid = 7967668 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is associated with [[Gorlin syndrome]]. Benign cardiac tumors are rare, 75% are histologically benign. Cardiac fibromas only occur 4-6%, which is less common compared to [[myxoma]]s (75%) and [[Rhabdomyoma|rhabdomymoas]] (5-10%).

The diagnosis of these [[Neoplasm|tumors]] require physical checkups, imaging studies on the heart, and specialized tests to evaluate the heart. Cardiac fibroma is considered a [[Birth defect|congenital]] tumor where an [[ultrasound]] prenatal scan may help detect during [[Fetus|fetal]] stage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Surgery]] is the best treatment for an individual with cardiac fibroma. During this surgery, the tumor is completely removed by the [[surgeon]]. The overall [[prognosis]] is very good with a surgical removal. There have been 200 cases of cardiac fibroma recorded in the medical literature. Risk factors are still unidentified, but 1 in 30 individuals with Gorlin syndrome are known to be present with cardiac fibroma.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
== Signs and symptoms ==
Cardiac fibroma is a slow-growing tumor that can cause [[heart]] electrical transmission defects and [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmias]]. Some features may be seen in the ventricle wall separating the right and left lower chambers or the [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]] muscle. This tumor is rarely seen in [[Atrium (heart)|atrial]] locations. Cardiac fibromas are mostly single and well-circumscribed and the average size of the tumor is circular and is 5&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Sometimes signs and symptoms are difficult to find in 35% of individuals. Situations like this, the tumor is incidentally diagnosed during a health checkup for other [[medical]] conditions. An individual may have abnormal heart sounds, such as a [[heart murmur]].

In 65% of individuals, signs and symptoms are more obvious due to the large size of the [[Neoplasm|tumor]]. Also, there is blood flow obstruction, especially into or out of the [[Heart valve|valves]]. The valves function becomes affected, which leads to [[heart failure]]. An individual might experience bluish skin ([[cyanosis]]), severe arrhythmias, dizziness, fainting, and other obstructive symptoms may be present.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
== Cause ==
The cause of development for cardiac fibroma is still unknown or unexplained. Some of these cases are [[Observation|observed]] to be linked to [[Gorlin Syndrome|Gorlin syndrome]]; a complex [[genetic disorder]] causing the formation of [[Neoplasm|tumors]] in various parts of the body. Research is currently being undertaken to identify relevant casual factors.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dovemed.com/diseases-conditions/cardiac-fibroma/|title=Cardiac Fibroma|work=DoveMed|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanism ==
The mechanism behind cardiac [[fibroma]]s are still unclear. Fibromas have a [[homogeneous]] mass of [[fibroblast]]s mixed with an abundance of [[collagen]] and [[elastic fiber]]s. These masses represent [[Mesenchyme|mesenchymal]] growth, but lacks other mesenchymal elements, such as [[blood vessel]]s, [[cartilage]] bone, and muscle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parmley|first=L. F.|last2=Salley|first2=R. K.|last3=Williams|first3=J. P.|last4=Head|first4=G. B.|date=April 1988|title=The clinical spectrum of cardiac fibroma with diagnostic and surgical considerations: noninvasive imaging enhances management|journal=The Annals of Thoracic Surgery|volume=45|issue=4|pages=455–465|issn=0003-4975|pmid=3281617|doi=10.1016/s0003-4975(98)90028-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; They often entrap [[cardiomyocytes]], which are muscle cells that make up the cardiac muscle. Cells are decreasing during this time, while collagen contents are increasing.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5JQbTbGVzs0C&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=how+cardiac+fibromas+affects+the+body&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hDlNeuyQ3J&amp;sig=y8WBs4Fr4KHhnD8JLm6rzDQG42Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwih7tiZ5YXYAhUMVxQKHUcQD4wQ6AEIcDAN#v=onepage&amp;q=how%20cardiac%20fibromas%20affects%20the%20body&amp;f=false|title=Cardiac Tumor Pathology|last=Basso|first=Cristina|last2=Valente|first2=Marialuisa|last3=Thiene|first3=Gaetano|date=2012-11-28|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781627031431|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of cardiac fibromas are slow and produces detrimental physical effects. This is done by [[infiltration (medical)|infiltrating]] and replacing the [[myocardium]] and protruding into the cavity of the heart. These tumors usually occur within the [[anterior wall]] of the left ventricle or the [[interventricular septum]] and rarely involves the [[right ventricle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heath|first=D.|date=1969-09-01|title=Cardiac fibroma.|url=http://heart.bmj.com/content/31/5/656|journal=Heart|language=en|volume=31|issue=5|pages=656–658|doi=10.1136/hrt.31.5.656|issn=1355-6037|pmid=5351306|pmc=487558}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large fibromas bulge into the cavity of the chamber, interfering with the functions of [[heart valve]]s and blood flow through the heart. When the left ventricular is obstructed, the outflow tract may give rise to a failed diagnosis of congenital [[Stenosis|subaortic stenosis]]. Moreover, it can cause severe [[congestive heart failure]]. Cardiac fibromas may present [[lymphocyte]] and [[monocyte]] aggregates, as well as areas of [[calcification]], which are shown on a [[Chest radiograph|chest x-ray]] or [[CT scan]]. The dimensions of these masses and the location cause clinical symptoms. Fibromas cause ventricular [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmias]] and conduction disturbances that become lethal causing a sudden death.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
The following tests and exams are taken to diagnose Cardiac fibroma:
# Family [[medical history]] and thorough physical examination that includes examination of the heart. Close attention to abnormal heart sounds is important.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# [[Echocardiography]]: Most valuable diagnosis because this can evaluate the morphology, location and range of the tumor. Also, it can access the degree of blood flow obstruction caused by tumor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
# [[Magnetic resonance imaging|Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)]] and [[CT scan|computed tomography CT]] scan of the heart
# [[Electrocardiography|Electrocardiogram]] (EKG): this is used to measure electrical activity of the heart and to detect [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmias]]. 
# [[Electrophysiology|Electrophysiological]] studies of an individuals heart to determine where arrhythmia is generated in the heart.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
# [[Medical ultrasound|Doppler ultrasound]] to measure the speed and direction of [[Hemodynamics|blood flow]] from sound waves.
# [[Biopsy|Tissue biopsy]]: a [[Pathology|pathologist]] may examine the biopsy under a [[microscope]] to suggest a definitive diagnosis. This is considered a gold standard in arriving to a conclusive diagnosis. Biopsy specimens are studied by using [[Haematoxylin|Hematoxylin]] and [[Eosin]] staining.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Treatment and prognosis ==
Cardiac fibroma is commonly treated through [[Surgery|surgical excision]] procedures. The removal of cardiac tumors require an [[Cardiac surgery|open heart surgery]]. During the surgery, the [[surgeon]] removes the tumor and [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s around it to reduce the risk of the tumor returning.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/16840-cardiac-tumors|title=Cardiac Tumors {{!}} Cleveland Clinic|website=Cleveland Clinic|language=en|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Cardiopulmonary bypass|heart-lung machine]] is used to take over the work of the heart and lungs because surgery is complicated and requires a still heart. The recovery is usually between 4–5 days in the hospital and 6 weeks in total. An [[Echocardiography|echocardiogram]] is taken every year to make sure the tumor has not returned or formed any new growth.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

If surgery is too difficult, a [[heart transplantation]] is a second option. Continuous [[observation]]s and checkups are recommended to monitor the condition. In cases of [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmias]], [[Antiarrhythmic agent|anti-arrhythmic]] medication is given before surgical treatments are considered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There has been excellent outcomes for individuals who undergo [[surgery]] to remove the tumor. If the tumor is completely resected, individuals will have a [[disease]]-free survival. If the tumor is incomplete it will continue to grow and [[Relapse|recurrence]] of symptoms occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|vauthors = Mueller DK|date=2017-01-06|title=Benign Cardiac Tumors: Background, Pathophysiology, Etiology|url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/161239-overview#a6|website = Medscape|publisher = WebMD LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
'''Literature survey on epidemiology and pathology of cardiac fibroma:'''

During this study, [[research]]ers searched through the literature [[database]]s on cardiac fibroma to find factors that predict poor outcomes that lead to [[death]]. Researchers found that patients who did not survive were significantly younger than those who did survive. These results suggest that younger individuals [[Diagnosis|diagnosed]] with cardiac fibroma are associated with a poorer outcome.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torimitsu|first=Suguru|last2=Nemoto|first2=Tetsuo|last3=Wakayama|first3=Megumi|last4=Okubo|first4=Yoichiro|last5=Yokose|first5=Tomoyuki|last6=Kitahara|first6=Kanako|last7=Ozawa|first7=Tsukasa|last8=Nakayama|first8=Haruo|last9=Shinozaki|first9=Minoru|date=2012-03-27|title=Literature survey on epidemiology and pathology of cardiac fibroma|journal=European Journal of Medical Research|volume=17|issue=1|pages=5|doi=10.1186/2047-783X-17-5|issn=0949-2321|pmc=3351722|pmid=22472419}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found no significant difference between the maximum [[diameter]] of the [[tumor]] between age groups. Even though younger individuals have smaller [[hearts]], the high ratio of tumor-to-heart sizes may generate low [[cardiac output]], which leads to a poor outcome. Literature revealed that 18 of 178 patients with cardiac fibroma were diagnosed during [[Prenatal development|prenatal]] and [[Infant|neonatal]] periods, resulting in the tumor having a certain size regardless of the child's age. These findings suggest that cardiac fibromas may be a [[Birth defect|congenital disorder]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''Successful Surgical Excision of a Large Cardiac Fibroma in an Asymptomatic Child:'''

A 3-year-old girl, who was [[asymptomatic]], underwent a successful [[Surgery|surgical excision]] of a large cardiac fibroma. She had frequent coughs, which led to a chest radiograph. A cardiac mass was found on the [[echocardiography]] and later was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging ([[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]]).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Borodinova O, Ostras O, Raad T, Yemets I | title = Successful Surgical Excision of a Large Cardiac Fibroma in an Asymptomatic Child | journal = World J Pediatr Congenit Heart Surg | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 235–238 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 27143716 | doi = 10.1177/2150135116634287 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After 24 hours of being monitored, it showed [[sinus rhythm]]s of normal [[Heart rate variability|variability]]. The mass dimensions were 38 X 28&amp;nbsp;mm in the [[apical (anatomy)|apical]] area of the left ventricle. A surgical procedure was recommended due to the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden [[Cardiac arrest|cardiac death]]. The surgery was a success and they were able to remove the entire tumor without any complications. Follow-up evaluations at six-months and a year showed the patient was in good health and no signs of tumor recurrence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Asymptomatic]] patients with cardiac fibroma becomes controversial because these tumors have the tendency to grow. Situations like this, a [[Surgery|surgical]] removal will be the top recommendation for patients.

'''Primary cardiac tumors in children: a center's experience''':

The Department of Cardiac Surgery Children's Hospital in China conducted a study to analyze different characteristics and outcomes of [[Pediatrics|pediatric]] patients who have primary cardiac tumors treated in their center.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ying L, Lin R, Gao Z, Qi J, Zhang Z, Gu W | title = Primary cardiac tumors in children: a center's experience | journal = J Cardiothorac Surg | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 52 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 27067427 | pmc = 4827228 | doi = 10.1186/s13019-016-0448-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They had sixteen patients with primary [[Primary tumors of the heart|cardiac tumors]] between the ages of 1–13 years. All patients were diagnosed by echocardiography, MRI, and computed tomography (CT). As a result, they were able to successfully remove the mass from 15 patients with [[cardiopulmonary bypass]], whereas partial [[Segmental resection|resection]] was done in one patient. Unfortunately, one patient died during surgery due to low cardiac output [[syndrome]] at 5 days after operation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The [[Pathology|pathological]] examination of the cardiac masses showed that [[rhabdomyoma]] is the most frequent tumor in children, followed by [[myxoma]], fibromas, etc. [[Disease|Morbidity]] of rhabdomyomas and fibromas were reported higher in infancy, while myxomas are more frequent in older children.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17742">The maternal mortality rate is 224 deaths per 100,000 births, which is the 23rd highest in the world.&lt;ref name=wfb&gt;Central Intelligence Agency. (2016). The World Factbook: Zambia. Retrieved from https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/za.html on April 9, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The mean age of mothers at birth is 19.3 years old, and the fertility rate is 5.72 children born per woman, which is the 7th highest in the world.&lt;ref name=wfb/&gt; The contraceptive rate is only 40.8%, and the birth rate is the 4th highest in the world at 42.13 births/1,000 population.&lt;ref name=wfb/&gt; Infectious disease is a key contributor to the poor health of the nation, and the risk is very high for diseases such as protozoal and bacterial diarrhea, hepatitis A, typhoid fever, malaria, dengue fever, schistosomiasis, and rabies. The adult prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS is 12.37%, which is the 7th highest in the world.&lt;ref name=wfb/&gt;

Due to the poor health outcomes for mothers, and the challenges to access of care there is a significant impact on the culture of birth. Diversity in language and ethnicity plays a role in the diversity of care throughout Zambia.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Establishing safety for the mother and baby through national health improvement, particularly concerning infectious disease and access to clean water, is a priority for Zambia.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Pregnancy behaviors and beliefs==
While the woman is pregnant, extra precaution were taken as it is believed the women and her baby are in a physically and spiritually weaker state; this means they are more susceptible to sickness and evil forces. Preventative measures include changes in the women’s nutrition. Certain foods are considered harmful to the fetus and should be avoided by the mother. For example, eating eggs while pregnant will cause the child to be born without hair. Eating fish could cause an infant abnormality.

Postpartum care isn’t widely accessible or accessed, but research has shown that access to antenatal care in preparation for the birth is associated with better postpartum care and contraceptive use.&lt;ref name=do/&gt; Use of postpartum birth control and family planning leads to better maternal health outcomes, including a reduction in the number of pregnancies, reduced transmission of STIs, and overall decreased risk for maternal mortality.  

Access to clean drinking water is a major concern in Zambia. 85.6% of the population in urban areas and 51.3% of the population in rural areas as access to improved water sources, and 14.4% of the urban population and 48.7% of the rural population has access to unimproved water sources. Access to sanitation facility access is unimproved in 44.4% of the urban population and 64.3% in the rural population.&lt;ref name=wfb/&gt;

Women are not allowed to have sexual intercourse after the eighth month of pregnancy, this is believed to prevent the baby to have “white stuff” (vernix) on their skin when they are born.&lt;ref name=maimbolwa2003&gt;Maimbolwa, M. C., Yamba, B., Diwan, V., &amp; Ransjö‐Arvidson, A. B. (2003). Cultural childbirth practices and beliefs in Zambia. Journal of advanced nursing, 43(3), 263-274.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, extramarital relations are believed to bring harm to the baby.&lt;ref name=maimbolwa2003/&gt;

There are certain food women are allowed to and are not allowed to eat during pregnancy and labor, as they could have a lasting effect of the child’s health. For example, women are not allowed to eat eggs.&lt;ref name=maimbolwa2003/&gt;

==Labor==
Labor usually takes place in the home of the laboring women, should complications arise they are transferred to a maternity birthing center. However, due to geographic constraints sometime transportation is not an option, these geographic barriers contribute to the poor maternal health outcomes.&lt;ref name=schmidt&gt;Schmidt, C. (2013). Cultural Factors Exacerbating the Tragedy of Maternal Health in Zambia. 2013 NCUR.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Labor is meant to be a private matter between the women and a few support people, the woman will often isolate herself from those not acting as support people during her laboring. Males are also not allowed to be a part of the laboring process.&lt;ref name=schmidt/&gt;

Laboring mothers often behave in ways that conform to societal expectations in terms how a laboring mother should act. For example, it is the belief that mothers should not should not be vocal during the delivery process as it could lead to complications for the baby.&lt;ref name=maimbolwa2003/&gt; 
 
Women are encouraged by their mbusa to push whenever they experience pain.  Mbusas will also utilize, pieces of clothing called a chitenge to assist women into different positions, in an attempt to alleviate some of their pain.&lt;ref name=maimbolwa2003/&gt;
 
Three to four women are allowed to be present during the labor and delivery process. These women are usually relatives or close friends such as: daughters, sisters, nieces, neighbors, and co-wives. Should a women tell more than a few close relatives and friends she is in labor it is believed that she will become bewitched and complications will occur during the labor process.&lt;ref name=maimbolwa2003/&gt; Laboring and mothers giving birth preferred to have someone close by acting as a support person for them, however when naming the person they want to be there, a husband or male support person is usually not named.&lt;ref name=maimbolwa2001&gt;Maimbolwa, M. C., Sikazwe, N., Yamba, B., Diwan, V., &amp; Ransjö‐Arvidson, A. B. (2001). Views on involving a social support person during labor in Zambian maternities. Journal of Midwifery &amp; Women’s Health, 46(4), 226-234.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Mbusas operate under the assumption that less interference during the laboring process is better. However, at times they will employ a variety of strategies to accelerate the labor process. These include: providing fundal pressure, using a cooking stick to provide pressure in their mouth, and physically moving the mother. The gag reflex is used to help speed up either the labor process or the delivery of the placenta.&lt;ref name=maimbolwa2003/&gt;

==Birth==
Only 5.4% of birth in Zambia are attended by a trained traditional birth attendant. Most laboring women will have a social support person present during the antepartum period, however if a women gives birth in a hospital, the support person will, most likely, not be present during the actual laboring process. These women are called “mbusas”. Mbusas and those providing support during the laboring process have not received any formal education or training surround care of the laboring women. In most cases they do not have the skills needed to handle obstetrical emergencies. In those cases, they choose to accompany the laboring mothers to maternity units rather than delivering in the home.  The major roles of mbusas during the laboring process is to provide emotional support to the mother.&lt;ref name=maimbolwa2003/&gt; 
 
When mothers are brought into maternity centers, often do not have any direction making power. Many of the mbusas and those to bring the mothers to the maternity center are often only allowed in the room during visiting hours, however many women will choose to wait outside the unit. Should a mother be able to labor at home most of the power still belongs to them throughout the whole process. Furthermore, women who give birth in a medical center are subjected to more of the “coercive obstetric procedures” these include birthing positions that are convenient for the health care provider but not the laboring women.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, H. (2006). Ethnocentrism: reflections on medical anthropology. Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, 12(2), 481-483.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
53% of births occur in the home. The majority of the rest of the birth occur in maternity centers and hospitals. There seems to be a divide between those who gave birth in health care centers as opposed to those who gave at home. This is evidence by the fact that those who gave birth at home, do not receive as much postpartum as those who give birth in a healthcare setting. The women who choose to have a birth at home, states that they feel unwelcome at postpartum care clinics.&lt;ref name=do/&gt;
 
Typically in labors occurring in the home mothers are free to choose a birthing position that is most comfortable to them: some of these positions include, [[sitting]], [[kneeling]], and [[Squatting position|squatting]]. Mbusa will help with positioning through the use of a chitenge, a fabric Zambian women use to tie around the waist. Those laboring in health care centers may not have as much freedom in positioning.&lt;ref name=maimbolwa2003/&gt; 
 
Similar to the pain experienced during labor women giving birth are encouraged to push through the pain. Typically, no pharmacological pain relief is given to mothers birthing at home and mbusas will resort to using position changes as a way to relive some of the mother’s pain.&lt;ref name=maimbolwa2003/&gt;

Once the placenta is delivered it is buried in a specific place near the house or village. It is done this way as to protect the mother and her baby from witchcraft.  The placenta also plays a major role in the preservation of the women’s fertility. One mbusa states: “The placenta is buried, with the side where the baby lies facing the sky, and leaving the end of the cord showing, so that when the cord drops from the baby it should be connected with the cord buried with the placenta to protect the fertility.”.&lt;ref name=maimbolwa2003/&gt;

Some women cite the feelings of embarrassment dictating their personal behaviors. In a qualitative study one woman stated: “I would feel shy to have somebody next to me because we make a lot of noise and we are not covered.”. Furthermore, with the presence of a support person women feel that their behaviors must conform strictly with societal norms, as the support person could tell others if she did not.&lt;ref name=maimbolwa2001/&gt;

Should a complication arise women birthing at home do not have the resources of skills to be treated at home, women are transferred to the maternity center if they are able to get there logistically. Societal norms at times can view complications or an unhealthy mother and/or baby as the fault of the mother due to her behaviors during the pregnancy or labor.

Obstetrical technology is not used in home births, this is one of the reason, home births with complications are transferred to a healthcare setting if possible. The use of technology within hospitals is also limited. For example, continuous fetal monitoring does not occur in most maternity centers.&lt;ref name=maimbolwa2003/&gt; In hospitals the rate of episiotomies is not documented however it is estimated to be around 28%.&lt;ref name=mackeith&gt;MacKeith, N., Chinganya, O. J. M., Ahmed, Y., &amp; Murray, S. F. (2003). Zambian women's experiences of urban maternity care: results from a community survey in Lusaka. African journal of reproductive health, 92-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postpartum==
Once babies are born they are placed on a delivery mat until the mother delivers the placenta. The umbilical cord is then cut with a razor blade or sugar cane peel. Afterwards both the mother and the baby are bathed.&lt;ref name=maimbolwa2003/&gt; Postpartum visits usually take place within the first 6 weeks after the birth of the child.&lt;ref name=mackeith/&gt;

Women who gave birth at home will then recover at home at well. There was no information about the average length of stay after a birth for women who birth in maternity centers.

Pregnancy due dates and the start of labor are not announced as many are fearful this could evoke evil witchcraft.

There are no significant differences noticed between women who have given birth before and those who have not, the labor process seems to be approached in the same way.

One third of women who are married also use contraception. Furthermore, on average women begin to use contraception 8 month after their childbirth.&lt;ref name=do/&gt; After a child is born and while they are breastfeeding sexual activity is not allowed, as to protect the child.&lt;ref name=schmidt/&gt;

There is a large divide between those women who live in urban areas and those who live in rural areas in terms of postpartum care. Reports show that the rate of postpartum visits (up to 6 weeks after the birth of the baby) is 84% in Lukasa, the capital of Zambia. As opposed to a rate of 42% of women from rural areas went to postpartum care.&lt;ref name=do&gt;Do, M., &amp; Hotchkiss, D. (2013). Relationships between antenatal and postnatal care and post-partum modern contraceptive use: evidence from population surveys in Kenya and Zambia. BMC health services research, 13(1), 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Newborn==
Care for the newborn is focused mainly on superstitious issues surrounding the umbilical cord. Women dress the umbilical cord with different mixtures such as ash, seashell with oil, or breastmilk and believe that the cord dropping on the male genitals will lead to infertility.&lt;ref name=maimbolwa2003/&gt; It is also believed that a mother should not cook until the umbilical cord has fallen off, or the mother will get a mysterious disease.&lt;ref name=maimbolwa2003/&gt; A baby born covered in vernix is considered to be dirty. Babies are traditionally left either unwrapped, or wrapped in piece of cloth immediately after birth.&lt;ref name=maimbolwa2003/&gt; Skin-to-skin contact isn’t always employed, unless the birth attendants have been trained to do so. These traditions may lead to hypothermia and delayed breast feeding. In hospitals and maternity centers specifically, the mothers were not encouraged to have skin to skin contact immediately following the birth of their child, nor were they encouraged to breastfeed.&lt;ref name=maimbolwa2003/&gt;

Due to the high maternal mortality rate of 224 deaths per 100,000 live births, many newborns are left without a mother and may therefore be orphaned and sent to an orphanage. Contributing to the high maternal mortality is access to care for mothers in need. Zambia has only 0.17 physicians and 2 hospital beds per 1,000.&lt;ref name=wfb/&gt; Poor maternal outcomes lead to poor newborn outcomes as well, particularly regarding the loss of a primary caregiver. The national rate of infant mortality is the 17th highest in the world at 64.72 per 1,000 live births.

Access to clean water and sanitations is a considerable concern for the health and nutrition of the mother. If mom doesn’t have proper nutrition and is breastfeeding, chances are the child will be malnourished as well. In Zambia, 14.9% of children under 5 are underweight.&lt;ref name=wfb/&gt;

In Zambia, 8 out of 10 mothers breastfeeds exclusively for 6 months.&lt;ref name=leach&gt;Leach-Kemon, K. (2015). Visualizing Zambia’s success with breastfeeding. Humanosphere. Retrieved from http://www.humanosphere.org/science/2015/04/visualizing-zambias-success-breastfeeding/ on April 9, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The exclusive rate for breastfeeding of children under 6 months is 61%, and early initiation (within the first hour) occurs in 57% of moms.&lt;ref name=unicef&gt;Unicef. (2015). Unicef Zambia Fact Sheet: Nutrition. Unicef. Retrieved from http://www.unicef.org/zambia/5109_8461.html on 9 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of adequate feeding practices in children aged 6–23 months is only 37%.&lt;ref name=unicef/&gt; Due to lack of access to clean water, breastfeeding is highly encouraged for Zambian mothers as formula requires a clean and safe water source that many don’t have access to. Movement for baby friendly hospitals, ones that accommodate babies in the rooms with moms, promote breastfeeding, and provide lactation consultant services. Protection from HIV is another reason breastfeeding is encouraged, as exclusive breastfeeding builds the baby’s immunity. Prior to the early 2000s, it was believed that HIV+ mothers should not breastfeed to avoid spreading HIV to their baby. When this was proven false and the National AIDS Council published a recommendation for HIV mothers to breastfeed their babies, breastfeeding rates began to rise again around 2007.&lt;ref name=leach/&gt; An advocacy campaign was launched by the Zambian ministry of health in 2009 to promote improvement of exclusive breastfeeding rate. They have created a video is used to promote breastfeeding. However, as noted earlier, the access to media is limited in Zambia, so alternate methods of dissemination are required. The following graphic represents the increase in coverage of exclusive breastfeeding across Zambia over 5 year increments.

Zambia is one of 22 African countries with the highest burden of undernutrition in children under five, and Micronutrient deficiencies are common in Zambian children, as vitamin A deficiencies are present in 54% of children under 5, and anemia in 53%.&lt;ref name=unicef/&gt; A child’s nutritional status is influenced by access to food, care, and health, and poor feeding practices combined with illnesses such as intestinal parasites, diarrhea, pneumonia, malaria, and HIV/AIDS cause this high burden of undernutrition.&lt;ref name=unicef/&gt; Improving the rate of exclusive breastfeeding in mothers will help to improve the nutritional issues present in children and infants.

Circumcision is generally perceived and suggested to be beneficial for reduction of STI and HIV transmission. Many religious and cultural groups have circumcision as a standard practice, but the medical circumcision movement has expanded as the understanding of the benefits has.&lt;ref&gt;Lukobo, M. D. &amp; Bailey, R. C. (2007). Acceptability of male circumcision for prevention of HIV infection in Zambia. Aids Care, 19(4), 417-477.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7082">The '''College of Medicine''' ('''CoM''') (formerly the '''College of Integrated Health''' (2009–10)&lt;ref name=Buckinghamgate /&gt;) is a [[United Kingdom]] based organisation founded in 2010 for healthcare professionals and those interested in promoting [[alternative medicine]] within the [[National Health Service]]. The College originated from the collapse of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]]' controversial ''[[The Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health|Foundation for Integrated Health]]'', which closed after allegations of [[money-laundering]] and fraud.

==History==

One director of the College, [[Michael Dixon (doctor)|Michael Dixon]], is a former director of the ''[[The Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health|Foundation for Integrated Health]]''. A former director of the College, [[George Lewith]], was a council member of the foundation&lt;ref name=Rouse99&gt;{{cite news|last=Rouse|first=Rose|title=Prescribing the good life|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/1999/feb/23/healthandwellbeing.health3|accessdate=3 March 2012|newspaper=The [[The Guardian|Guardian]]|date=23 February 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and his research unit at the University of Southampton played an important role in the development of the foundation.&lt;ref name=Lewith05&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lewith|first=George|title=Complementary Medicine Research Unit|journal=Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine|date=January 2005|volume=2|issue=3|pages=399–407|doi=10.1093/ecam/neh109|pmid=16136220|pmc=1193549|url=http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2005/675828.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Foundation for Integrated Health'' promoted [[alternative medicine]] (using the term "integrative medicine") and closed down in 2010 after an accounting fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/alternativemedicine/7728281/Homeopathy-is-witchcraft-say-doctors.html|title=Homeopathy is witchcraft, say doctors|author=Laura Donnelly|date=15 May 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the College of Medicine was launched, several commentators writing in the [[The Guardian|''Guardian'']] and the [[The British Medical Journal|''BMJ'']], expressed the opinion that the new organisation was simply a re-branding of the Prince's ''Foundation'',&lt;ref name=GuardianCollege&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/aug/02/prince-charles-college-medicine-holistic-complementary |title=College of Medicine born from ashes of Prince Charles's holistic health charity |author=Ian Sample |publisher=The Guardian |date=August 2, 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2012/jan/10/college-medicine-lobby-group-unproven |title=College of Medicine is a lobby group promoting unproven treatments |author=Edzard Ernst |publisher=The [[The Guardian|Guardian]] |date=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BMJ_Cassidy&gt;{{cite journal | journal=British Medical Journal | volume=343 | doi=10.1136/bmj.d3712 | date=15 June 2011 | title=Lobby Watch: The College of Medicine | author=Jane Cassidy | url=http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.d3712.full | pmid=21677014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BMJ_Colquhoun&gt;{{cite journal | journal=British Medical Journal | volume=343 | doi=10.1136/bmj.d4368 | date=12 July 2011 | title=The College of Medicine is Prince’s Foundation reincarnated  | author=David Colquhoun | url=http://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d4368.full | pmid=21750061}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BMJ_May&gt;{{cite journal | journal=British Medical Journal | volume=343 | doi=10.1136/bmj.d4372 | date=12 July 2011 | title=College of Medicine: What is integrative health? | author=James May | url=http://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d4372.full | pmid=21750063}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BMJ_Ernst&gt;{{cite journal | journal=British Medical Journal | volume=343 | doi=10.1136/bmj.d4370 | date=12 July 2011 | title=College of Medicine or College of Quackery? | author=Edzard Ernst | url=http://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d4370.full | pmid=21750062}}&lt;/ref&gt; some describing it as "Hamlet without the Prince".&lt;ref name=BMJ_Hawkes /&gt;

[[Alternative medicine]] critic and pharmacologist [[David Colquhoun]] has argued that the College is extremely well-funded&lt;ref name=Buckinghamgate&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263 | title=Buckinghamgate: the new "College of Medicine" arising from the ashes of the Prince’s Foundation for Integrated Health | date=July 25, 2010 | author=David Colquhoun | publisher=DC's Improbable Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; and seemed from the beginning to be very confident of the Prince's support, explicitly describing its mission as "to take forward the vision of HRH the Prince of Wales" in an early presentation.&lt;ref name=Delusion&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3632|title=Don’t be deceived. The new "College of Medicine" is a fraud and delusion | date=29 October 2010 |author=David Colquhoun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The College responded to this initial criticism by stating that it aims were to "promote a more politically and professionally transparent, patient centred, and sustainable approach to healthcare, using whatever social or therapeutic approaches are safe, effective, and empowering for patients".&lt;ref name=BMJ_response&gt;{{cite journal | journal=British Medical Journal | url=http://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d4364.extract?sid=66683c7f-e8ba-4245-954b-0ebfbb090ea4 | author=George T Lewith | author2=Graeme Catto | author3=Michael Dixon | author4=Christine Glover | author5=Aidan Halligan | author6=Ian Kennedy | author7=Christopher Manning | author8=David Peters | title=College of Medicine replies to its critics | date=12 July 2011 | volume=343 | doi=10.1136/bmj.d4364 | pmid=21750060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It is unclear where the usage of community health workers began, although China and Bangladesh have been cited as possible origins. [[Melinda Gates]], co-founder of the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], said the nongovernmental organization [[BRAC (NGO)|BRAC]] in Bangladesh "pioneered the community health worker model."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kristof|first=Nicholas D.|title=Melinda Gates Answers Questions, Part II|url=http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/11/melinda-gates-answers-questions-part-ii/|accessdate=18 September 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine Lovell writes that BRAC's decision to train locally recruited paramedics was "based on the Chinese [[barefoot doctor]] model then becoming known worldwide."

[[History of medicine|Scientific medicine has evolved]] slowly over the last few millennia and very rapidly over the last 150 years or so. As the evidence mounted of its effectiveness, belief and trust in the traditional ways waned. The rise of university-based [[medical school]]s, the increased numbers of trained [[physician]]s, the professional organizations they created, and the income and attendant political power they generated resulted in [[healthcare provider requisites|license regulations]]. Such regulations were effective in improving the quality of medical care but also resulted in a reduced supply of clinical care providers. This further increased the fees doctors could charge and encouraged them to concentrate in larger towns and cities where the population was denser, [[hospital]]s were more available, and professional and social relationships more convenient.

In the 1940s Chairman Mao Tse Tung in China faced these problems. His anger at the "urban elite" medical profession over the maldistribution of medical services resulted in the creation of "[[Barefoot doctors]]". Hundreds of thousands of rural peasants, chosen by their colleagues, were given rudimentary training and assigned medical and sanitation duties in addition to the collective labor they owed the commune. By 1977 there were over 1.7 million barefoot doctors.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal MM, Greiner JR. The Barefoot Doctors of China: from political creation to professionalization. ''Hum Organ''. Winter 1982;41(4):330-341&lt;/ref&gt; As professionally trained doctors and nurses became more available, the program was abolished in 1981 with the end of agricultural communes. Many Barefoot Doctors passed an examination and went to medical school. Many became health aides and some were relieved of duty.

Brazil undertook a medical plan named the [[Programa Saúde da Família|Family Health Program]] in the 1990s that made use of large numbers of [[community health agent]]s.  Between 1990 and 2002 the infant mortality rate dropped from about 50 per 1000 live births to 29.2.&lt;ref&gt;Macinko J, Guanais FC, de Fatima M, de Souza M. Evaluation of the impact of the Family Health Program on infant mortality in Brazil, 1990-2002. ''J Epidemiol Community Health''. Jan 2006;60(1):13-19.&lt;/ref&gt;  During that period the Family Health Program increased its coverage of the population from 0 to 36%.  The largest impact appeared to be a reduction of deaths from [[diarrhea]]. Though the program utilized teams of physicians, nurses and CHWs, it could not have covered the population it did without the CHW.  Additionally, there is evidence in Brazil that the shorter period of training does not reduce the quality of care.  In one study workers with a shorter length of training complied with child treatment guidelines 84% of the time whereas those with longer training had 58% compliance.&lt;ref&gt;Huicho L, Scherpbier RW, Nkowane AM, Victora CG. How much does quality of child care vary between health workers with differing durations of training? An observational multicountry study. ''Lancet''. Sep 13 2008;372(9642):910-916.&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran utilizes large numbers of para-professionals called ''behvarz''.  These workers are from the community and are based in 14,000 "health houses" nationwide.  They visit the homes of the underserved providing vaccinations and monitoring [[growth chart|child growth]]. Between 1984 and 2000 Iran was able to cut its [[infant mortality]] in half and raise immunization rates from 20 to 95%.  The [[family planning]] program in Iran is considered highly successful.  Fertility has dropped from 5.6 lifetime children per woman in 1985 to 2 in 2000. Though there are many elements to the program (including classes for those who marry and the ending of tax incentives for large families), behvarz are extensively involved in providing birth control advice and methods.  The proportion of rural women on contraceptives in 2000 was 67%.  The program resulted in profound improvement in [[maternal mortality]] going from 140 per 100,000 in 1985 to 37 in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Roudi-Fahimi F, Bureau PR. ''Women's reproductive health in the Middle East and North Africa.'' Population Reference Bureau; 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government of Liberia launched the National Community Health Assistant Program in 2016 to accelerate progress towards universal health coverage for the most vulnerable populations, especially those in remote communities.&lt;ref&gt;Luckow PW, Kenny A, White E, Ballard M, Dorr L, Erlandson K, . Implementation research on community health workers’ provision of maternal and child health services in rural Liberia. Bull World Health Organ. 2017 Feb 1;95(2):113–20. http://dx.doi/org/10.2471/BLT.16.175513&lt;/ref&gt; Liberia's program seeks to transform an existing cadre of unpaid and poorly coordinated CHWs into a more effective workforce by enhancing recruitment, supervision and compensation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usaid.gov/liberia/fact-sheets/community-health-workers-advancing-liberian-livelihoods-activity&lt;/ref&gt; The health ministry has organized a coalition of funding and implementation partners to support this new program, which aims to train, supervise, equip and pay 4000 Community Health Assistants, supported by 400 clinical supervisors, to extend primary care services to 1.2 million people living in remote rural communities.

==Scope of programs==
The [[World Health Organization]] estimates there are over 1.3 million community health workers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, 2011. [http://www.who.int/whosis/whostat/2011/en/index.html ''World Health Statistics 2011''] - Table 6: Health workforce, infrastructure and essential medicines. Accessed 21 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the large-scale implementation by countries such as China, Brazil, and Iran, many countries have implemented CHW programs in small-scale levels for a variety of health issues.

In India, community health workers have been utilized to increase [[mental health]] service utilization and decrease stigma associated with mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacs A.N., Srinivasan K., Neerakkal I., Jayaram G. Initiating a Community Mental Health Programme in Rural Karnataka. ''IJCM''. 2006;31(2):86-87.&lt;/ref&gt; In this program respected female members of the community were chosen to participate. All of the women were married, came from a good social standing, displayed a keen interest in the program, and were encouraged by their family to participate. The women chosen were then trained in identification and referral of patients with mental illnesses, the common myths and misconceptions prevalent in the area and in conducting community surveys. The training lasted 3 days and included lectures, role plays and observation of patient interviews at the [[psychiatry]] outpatient department at St. John's Medical College Hospital. A population of 12,886 were surveyed using a brief questionnaire. Out of this population, 574 were suspected patients. Out of this 242 suspected patients visited the clinic after follow up from the community health worker. Also in India, [[The MINDS Foundation]] has developed a grassroots program targeted at providing mental health services to rural citizens. They leave the responsibility in the hands of local rural citizens who are trained as Community Mental Healthcare Workers (CMHWs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The MINDS Foundation|url=http://www.mindsfoundation.org|publisher=The MINDS Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Tanzania, village health workers were part of a community-based safe-motherhood approach.&lt;ref&gt;Ahluwalia IB, Schmid T, Kouletio M, Kanenda O. An evaluation of a community-based approach to safe motherhood in northwestern Tanzania. ''Int J Gynaecol Obstet''. 2003;82(2):231-240.&lt;/ref&gt; The VHWs assisted [[pregnancy|pregnant]] women with birth planning, which included timely identification of danger signs, preparation, and accumulation of two or more essential supplies such as soap, razors, gloves for clean delivery, and mobilizing household resources, people and money to manage a possible emergency. Approximately one year after the CBRHP's major interventions ceased in these communities, most of the VHWs continued to do [[health promotion]] by visiting pregnant women, teaching them about birth planning and danger signs, and assisting them in obtaining both prenatal and obstetric services. Local VHW associations are forming with support from local political leaders, the Ministry of Health, and the non-governmental organization CARE to sustain the work of the VHWs. The community development officers, some of whom were also the master trainers, are involved in spearheading the formation of VHW organizations.

In [[Mali]], community health workers with the [[Mali Health Organizing Project]] in [[Bamako]] have helped reduce child mortality (under 5 years old) in their community to less than 1%, compared to a national average of 19%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Report 2011|url=http://www.malihealth.org/data-and-reports/|work=Data and Reports|publisher=Mali Health Organizing Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of CHWs is not limited to developing countries. In New York, CHWs have been deployed across the state to provide care to patients with chronic illnesses like [[diabetes]] that require sustained, comprehensive care. They work in both rural communities where access to primary care is sparse, and in urban communities where they are better able to bridge communication gaps that may arise between patients and doctors. They are seen to play an important role in assisting patients with navigating a complex, uncoordinated [[health care system]].&lt;ref&gt;New York State Health Foundation: [http://www.nyshealthfoundation.org/''Community Health Workers''.]{{Dead link updated with new link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[randomised controlled trial|randomized controlled intervention]] on the U.S.-Mexico border, used ''[[promotoras]]'' or "female promoters" to increase the number of women utilizing routine preventive examinations.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter JB, de Zapien JG, Papenfuss M, Fernandez ML, Meister J, Giuliano AR. The impact of a promotora on increasing routine chronic disease prevention among women aged 40 and older at the U.S.-Mexico border. ''Health Educ Behav''. 2004;31(4 Suppl):18S-28S.&lt;/ref&gt; The control group received a postcard reminding women to get preventive screening. The free comprehensive clinical exam included a [[Pap test]], a clinical breast exam, [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV) testing, blood draw for total cholesterol and blood glucose, and a blood pressure measurement. The other group received the same postcard and a follow-up visit from a promotora. The group that was followed up by a [[promotoras|promotora]] saw a 35% increase in visits to get the free screening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aidstarone.com/focus_areas/treatment/resources/case_study_series/linking_resources_art_adherence_india |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208220059/http://aidstarone.com/focus_areas/treatment/resources/case_study_series/linking_resources_art_adherence_india |archivedate=2015-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A program in Karnataka, India took a slightly different approach now referred to as the "link worker" model. The Samastha project developed a network in which trained workers, village health committees, government facilities, people living with HIV (PLHIV) networks, and participating NGOs collaborated to improve recruitment and retention of PLHIV while strengthening and supporting their adherence to treatment. Link workers were PLHIV who were selected by Samastha from a small number of HIV-positive candidates proposed by their community; they received an allowance for their work. The link workers' key tasks revolved around prevention, stigma reduction, and support for PLHIV that included adherence support to both treatment and care. Ultimately, the link workers' coordinating role became a hallmark of Samastha's interventions in high prevalence rural areas. Link workers formed the essential connection between PLHIV, government and community structures, and HIV care and treatment services, commonly accompanying persons from their catchment area to these services.

Community health workers have also been utilized to assist in research. Martin et al. found that the Latin-American population in the United States frequently does not benefit from health programs due to language barriers, distrust of the government, and unique health beliefs and practices, and specifically that providing effective [[asthma]] care to the Latino population is an enormous challenge.&lt;ref&gt;Martin M, Hernandez O, Naureckas E, Lantos J. Improving asthma research in an inner-city Latino neighborhood with community health workers. ''J Asthma''. 2005;42(10):891-895.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, they found that Latinos are also often excluded from research due to a lack of validated research instruments in Spanish, unsuccessful study recruitment, and a limited number of Latino researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Flores G, Fuentes-Afflick E, Barbot O, et al. The health of Latino children: urgent priorities, unanswered questions, and a research agenda. ''JAMA''. 2002;288(1):82-90.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Martin and colleagues decided to use community health workers to recruit participants. To gauge the effectiveness of their recruitment strategy to other more traditional recruitment models they looked at two studies. Both these studies offered significant monetary incentives for participation while the CHW study offered nothing for the initial participation. Martin et al. found that individuals who chose not to participate in the study went on to receive other services in the areas of [[diabetes]] and [[cancer]] prevention, which was not the case for the other studies.

In the Philippines, community health workers are known as [[Barangay Health Volunteers|barangay health volunteers]]. With decentralization of healthcare through the 1991 Local Government Code, the responsibility of delivery of primary health services were transferred from the central government to locally elected provincial, city, and municipal governments. They provide preventative health services and treatments, especially for the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lakshminarayanan|first=Rama|date=May 2003|title=Decentralisation and its implications for reproductive health: the Philippines experience|journal=Reproductive Health Matters|volume=11|issue=21|pages=96–107|issn=0968-8080|pmid=12800707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==
Cost and access to medical care remain problems of worldwide scope. They are particularly severe in the developing world and it is estimated one million more health care workers are needed in Africa to meet the health-related [[Millennium Development Goals]].&lt;ref name="Conway MD 2007"&gt;Conway MD. Addressing Africa’s health workforce crisis. ''The McKinsey Quarterly''. November 2007 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Doctors are few and concentrated in cities.

''Human Resource Strategic Plan for Uganda, 2005–2020''. Kampala. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Medical training is long and expensive. It is estimated that to meet [[health workforce]] needs using the American or European model, Africa would need to build 300 medical schools with a total training cost of over $33 billion and it would take over 20 years just to catch up.&lt;ref name="Conway MD 2007"/&gt;  In many countries salaries of doctors and nurses are less than that of engineers and teachers.  Bright young medical professionals often leave practice for more lucrative opportunities.&lt;ref name="Conway MD 2007"/&gt; Emigration of trained personnel to countries with higher salaries is high.

[http://uk.amref.org/silo/files/people-first-african-solutions-to-the-health-worker-crisis.pdf ''People First: African solutions to the health worker crisis''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831200317/http://uk.amref.org/silo/files/people-first-african-solutions-to-the-health-worker-crisis.pdf |date=2011-08-31 }} 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Health systems]] remain extremely weak, especially in rural areas. The [[World Health Assembly]] in 2006 called for, "A health workforce which is matched in number, knowledge and skill sets to the needs of the population and which contributes to the achievement of health outcomes by utilizing a range of innovative methods".&lt;ref name="WHO2006"/&gt;

Community health workers are thought to be part of the answer.&lt;ref name="McPake B p 13"&gt;McPake B, Mensah K. Task shifting in health care in resource-poor countries. ''Lancet.'' Sep 13 2008;372(9642):870-871.&lt;/ref&gt; They can be trained to do specialized tasks such as provide [[sexually transmitted disease]] counseling, [[directly observed therapy]] for tuberculosis control, or act as trained [[birth attendant]]s. Others work on specific programs performing limited medical evaluations and treatment. Others have a far broader primary care function. With training, monitoring, supervision, and support such workers have been shown to be able to achieve outcomes far better than baseline and in some studies, better than physicians.&lt;ref&gt;Perez F AK, Ndoro T, Engelsmann B, Dabis F.

Important attributes of community health workers are to be a member of and chosen by the community they serve.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization: [http://www.who.int/hrh/documents/community_health_workers.pdf ''Community health workers:  What do we know about them?''] WHO Evidence and Information for Policy, Department of Human Resources for Health; 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  This means they are easily accepted by their fellows and have natural cultural awareness. This is crucial because many communities are disengaged from the formal health system. In Sub-Saharan Africa, 53% of the poorest households do not seek care outside the home.&lt;ref name="AMREF"/&gt; Barriers include clinic fees, distance, community beliefs and the perception of the skills and attitudes of medical clinic workers.  Community health workers are unable to emigrate because they do not have internationally recognized qualifications.&lt;ref name="McPake B p 13"/&gt;  Finally, the variation in incentives between areas of the country tends to be low.  All these factors combined with strong community ties, tend to result in retention at the community level.

Much remains to be learned about the recruitment, training, functions, incentives, retention and professional development of community health workers.  Learning developed in one country may not be applicable to another due to cultural differences. Health worker adaptability to local requirements and needs is key to improving medical outcomes.&lt;ref name="AMREF"/&gt;  That being said, it has been estimated that six million children’s lives a year could be saved if 23 evidence-based interventions were provided systematically the children living in the 42 countries responsible for 90% of childhood mortality.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce J, Black RE, Walker N, Bhutta ZA, Lawn JE, Steketee RW.

Evidence-based, cost-effective interventions: how many newborn babies can we save? ''Lancet''. Mar 12-18 2005;365(9463):977-988.&lt;/ref&gt;  Community health workers may be an integral and crucial component of the [[Health Human Resources|health human resources]] team needed to achieve such goals.

{{Disability}}

A '''disability''' is an impairment that may be [[Cognitive disability|cognitive]], [[Developmental disability|developmental]], [[Intellectual disability|intellectual]], [[mental disorder#Disability|mental]], [[physical disability|physical]], [[Sense|sensory]], or some combination of these. It substantially affects a person's life activities and may be present from birth or occur during a person's lifetime.&lt;ref name="Journal of Applied Physiology"&gt;[http://jap.physiology.org/content/95/5/2152 Journal of Applied Physiology]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Disabilities is an umbrella term, covering impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions. An impairment is a problem in body function or structure; an activity limitation is a difficulty encountered by an individual in executing a task or action; while a participation restriction is a problem experienced by an individual in involvement in life situations. Disability is thus not just a health problem. It is a complex phenomenon, reflecting the interaction between features of a person’s body and features of the society in which he or she lives.|author=[[World Health Organization]]|source=Disabilities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Disabilities |url=http://www.who.int/topics/disabilities/en/ |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Disability is a contested concept, with different meanings in different communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Claiming Disability: Knowledge and Identity|last = Linton|first = Simi|publisher = New York University Press|year = 1998|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be used to refer to physical or mental attributes that some institutions, particularly medicine, view as needing to be fixed (the [[Medical model of disability|medical model]]). It may refer to limitations imposed on people by the constraints of an [[ableism|ableist]] society (the [[Social model of disability|social model]]). Or the term may serve to refer to the identity of disabled people. [[Physiological functional capacity]] (PFC) is a related term that describes an individual's performance level. It gauges one's ability to perform the physical tasks of daily life and the ease with which these tasks are performed. PFC declines with advancing [[aging|age]] to result in [[Frailty syndrome|frailty]], cognitive disorders or physical disorders, all of which may lead to labeling individuals as disabled.&lt;ref name="Journal of Applied Physiology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28400984"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mugueta-Aguinaga I, Garcia-Zapirain B | title = Is Technology Present in Frailty?

The discussion over disability's definition arose out of [[Disability rights movement|disability activism]] in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1970s, which challenged how the medical concept of disability dominated perception and discourse about disabilities. Debates about proper terminology and their implied politics continue in disability communities and the academic field of [[disability studies]]. In some countries, the law requires that disabilities are documented by a healthcare provider in order to assess qualifications for [[disability benefits]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

== History ==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2016}}
Contemporary understandings of disability derive from concepts that arose during the West's scientific [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]; prior to the Enlightenment, physical differences were viewed through a different lens.

During the [[Middle Ages]], madness and other conditions were thought to be caused by demons. They were also thought to be part of the natural order, especially during and in the fallout of the [[Black Death|Plague]], which wrought impairments throughout the general population.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Braddock, David, and Susan Parrish, "An Institutional History of Disability," in ''Handbook of Disability Studies'', ed. Gary Albrecht, Katherine Seelman, and Michael Bury (Thousand Oaks, Calif.: Sage, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[early modern period]] there was a shift to seeking biological causes for physical and mental differences, as well as heightened interest in demarcating categories: for example, Ambroise Pare, in the sixteenth century, wrote of "monsters", "prodigies", and "the maimed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Enlightenment]]'s emphases on knowledge derived from reason and on the value of natural science to human progress helped spawn the birth of institutions and associated knowledge systems that observed and categorized human beings; among these, the ones significant to the development of today's concepts of disability were [[Psychiatric hospital|asylums]], [[clinic]]s, and, [[prison]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Contemporary concepts of disability are rooted in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century developments. Foremost among these was the development of clinical medical discourse, which made the human body visible as a thing to be manipulated, studied, and transformed. These worked in tandem with scientific discourses that sought to classify and categorize and, in so doing, became methods of normalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The History of Sexuality, vol. 1|last = Foucault|first = Michel|publisher = Vintage|year = 1980|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the "norm" developed in this time period, and is signaled in the work of the [[Belgian]] [[statistician]], [[Sociology|sociologist]], [[mathematician]], and [[astronomer]] [[Adolphe Quetelet]], who wrote in the 1830s of l'homme moyen – the average man. Quetelet postulated that one could take the sum of all people's attributes in a given population (such as their height or weight) and find their average, and that this figure should serve as a norm toward which all should aspire.

This idea of a statistical norm threads through the rapid take up of statistics gathering by Britain, United States, and the Western European states during this time period, and it is tied to the rise of [[eugenics]]. Disability, as well as other concepts including: abnormal, non-normal, and normalcy came from this.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Lennard. "Constructing Normalcy." In his ''Enforcing Normalcy: Disability, Deafness, and the Body'' (New York: Verso, 1995), pp. 23–49.&lt;/ref&gt; The circulation of these concepts is evident in the popularity of the [[freak show]], where showmen profited from exhibiting people who deviated from those norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Freak Show: Presenting Human Oddities for Amusement and Profit|last = Bogdan|first = Robert|publisher = |year = 1998|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise of eugenics in the latter part of the nineteenth century, such deviations were viewed as dangerous to the health of entire populations. With disability viewed as part of a person's biological make-up and thus their genetic inheritance, scientists turned their attention to notions of weeding such "deviations" out of the gene pool. Various metrics for assessing a person's genetic fitness, which were then used to deport, sterilize, or institutionalize those deemed unfit. At the end of the Second World War, with the example of Nazi eugenics, eugenics faded from public discourse, and increasingly disability cohered into a set of attributes that medicine could attend to – whether through augmentation, rehabilitation, or treatment. In both contemporary and modern history, disability was often viewed as a by-product of [[incest]] between [[first-degree relatives]] or [[second-degree relatives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Barlow, Kathleen | year = 2006 | title = Inbreeding, Incest, and the Incest Taboo: The State of Knowledge at the Turn of the Century | doi = 10.1525/aa.2006.108.2.447| journal = American Anthropologist | volume = 108 | issue = 2| pages = 447–448 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s, disability activists began to challenge how society treated disabled people and the medical approach to disability. Due to this work, physical [[Accessibility|barriers to access]] were identified. These conditions functionally disabled them, and what is now known as the [[social model of disability]] emerged. Coined by Mike Oliver in 1983, this phrase distinguishes between the [[medical model of disability]] – under which an impairment needs to be fixed – and the social model of disability – under which the society that limits a person needs to be fixed.&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare, Tom. "The Social Model of Disability." In ''The Disability Studies Reader'', ed. Lennard Davis (New York: Routledge, 2006, 2d ed.), 197–204.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Terminology ===
Different terms have been used for disabled people in different times and places.  ''Disability'' or ''impairment'' are commonly used, as are more specific terms, such as ''blind'' (to describe having no vision at all) or ''visually impaired'' (to describe having limited vision).

''Handicap'' has been disparaged as a result of [[List of common false etymologies#Other|false folk etymology]] that says it is a reference to begging.  It is actually derived from an old game, [[Hand-i'-cap]], in which two players trade possessions and a third, neutral person judges the difference of value between the possessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/handicap|title=Definition of handicap in Oxford Dictionaries (British &amp; World English)|accessdate=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of a neutral person evening up the odds was extended to [[Handicap (horse racing)|handicap racing]] in the mid-18th century.  In handicap racing, horses carry different weights based on the umpire's estimation of what would make them run equally.  The use of the term to describe a person with a disability—by extension from handicap racing, a person carrying a heavier burden than normal—appeared in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=ety&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etymonline.com/?term=handicap|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|accessdate=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== People-first language ===
{{Main|People-first language}}
People-first language is one way to talk about disability that some people prefer. Using people-first language is said to put the person before the disability, so those individuals who prefer people-first language, prefer to be called, "a person with a disability". Some people prefer person-first phrasing, while others prefer identity-first phrasing.

For people-first guidelines, check out, "Cerebral Palsy: A Guide for Care" at the [[University of Delaware]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cerebral Palsy: a Guide for Care |url=http://gait.aidi.udel.edu/res695/homepage/pd_ortho/clinics/c_palsy/cpweb.htm |publisher=The Nemours Foundation |accessdate=July 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The [[American Psychological Association]] [[APA style|style guide]] states that, when identifying a person with a disability, the person's name or pronoun should come first, and descriptions of the disability should be used so that the disability is identified, but is not modifying the person. Acceptable examples included "a woman with [[Down syndrome]]" or "a man who has [[schizophrenia]]". It also states that a person's adaptive equipment should be described functionally as something that assists a person, not as something that limits a person, for example, "a woman who uses a wheelchair" rather than "a woman in/confined to a wheelchair".&lt;/blockquote&gt;A similar kind of "people-first" terminology is also used in the UK, but more often in the form "people with impairments" (such as "people with visual impairments"). However, in the UK, the term "disabled people" is generally preferred to "people with disabilities". It is argued under the [[Social model of disability|social model]] that while someone's impairment (for example, having a spinal cord injury) is an individual property, "disability" is something created by external societal factors such as a lack of accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcil.org.uk/FileAccess.aspx?id=59 Glasgow Centre for Inclusive Living: The Social Model of Disability] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103084307/http://www.gcil.org.uk/FileAccess.aspx?id=59 |date=January 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction between the individual property of impairment and the social property of disability is central to the [[Social model of disability|social model]]. The term "disabled people" as a political construction is also widely used by international organisations of disabled people, such as [[Disabled Peoples' International]] (DPI).

The use of “people-first” terminology has given rise to the use of the acronym PWD to refer to person(s) (or people) with disabilities (or disability).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Meyers |first=Stephen |year=2014 |chapter=Chapter 23.

Which style of language used varies between different countries, groups and individuals.

=== Aging ===
To a certain degree, physical impairments and changing mental states are almost ubiquitously experienced by people as they age. Aging populations are often stigmatized for having a high prevalence of disability. [[Kathleen Woodward]], writing in ''Key Words for Disability Studies'', explains the phenomenon as follows:
{{Quote|Aging is invoked rhetorically—at times ominously—as a pressing reason why disability should be of crucial interest to all of us (we are all getting older, we will all be disabled eventually), thereby inadvertently reinforcing the damaging and dominant stereotype of aging as solely an experience of decline and deterioration. But little attention has been given to the imbrication of aging and disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woodward|first1=Kathleen|editor1-last=Adams|editor1-first=Rachel|editor2-last=Reiss|editor2-first=Benjamin|editor3-last=Serlin|editor3-first=David|title=Key Words for Disability Studies|date=2015|publisher=New York University Press|location=Washington Square New York NY 10003|isbn=978-1-4798-4115-8|pages=33–34|chapter=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== The workforce ==
As stated above, studies have illustrated a correlation between disabilities and poverty. Notably, jobs offered to disabled people are scarce. ''For global demographic data on unemployment rates for the disabled, see [[Disability and poverty]].'' However, there are current programs in place that aid intellectually disabled (ID) people to acquire skills they need in the workforce.&lt;ref name=":0x"&gt;Blick, R. N., Litz, K. S., Thornhill, M. G., &amp; Goreczny, A. J. (2016). Do inclusive work environments matter? Effects of community-integrated employment on quality of life for individuals with intellectual disabilities. Research In Developmental Disabilities, 53358-366. doi:10.1016/j.ridd.2016.02.015&lt;/ref&gt;  Such programs include sheltered workshops and adult day care programs. Sheltered programs consist of daytime activities such as, gardening, manufacturing, and assembling. These activities facilitate routine-oriented tasks that in turn allow intellectually disabled people to gain experience before entering the workforce. Similarly, adult day care programs also include day time activities. However, these activities are based in an educational environment where intellectually disabled are able to engage in educational, physical, and communication based tasks. This educational based environment helps facilitate communication, memory, and general living skills. In addition, adult day care programs arrange opportunities for their students to engage in community activities. Such opportunities are arranged by scheduling field trips to public places (e.g. Disneyland, Zoo, and Movie Theater). Despite, both programs providing essential skills for intellectually disabled prior to entering the workforce researchers have found that intellectually disabled people prefer to be involved with community-integrated employment.&lt;ref name=":0x" /&gt; Community-integrated employment are job opportunities offered to intellectually disabled people at minimum wage or a higher rate depending on the position. Community-integrated employment comes in a variety of occupations ranging from customer service, clerical, janitorial, hospitality and manufacturing positions. Within their daily tasks community-integrated employees work alongside employees who do not have disabilities, but who are able to assist them with training. All three options allow intellectually disabled people to develop and exercise social skills that are vital to everyday life. However, it is not guaranteed that community-integrated employees receive the same treatment as employees that do not have ID. According to Lindstrom, Hirano, McCarthy, and Alverson, community-integrated employees are less likely to receive  raises. In addition, studies conducted in 2013 illustrated only 26% of employees with ID retained full-time status.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;L. Lindstrom, K.A. Hirano, C. McCarthy, C.Y. Alverson
“Just having a job”: Career advancement for low-wage workers with intellectual and developmental disabilities
Career Development and Transition for Exceptional Individuals, 37 (1) (2014), pp. 1–10&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, many with disabilities, intellectual and (or) psychical, finding a stable workforce poses many challenges. According to a study conducted by JARID (Journal of Applied Research and Intellectual Disability, indicates that although finding a job may be difficult for an intellectually disabled individual, stabilizing a job is even harder.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Banks, P., Jahoda, A., Dagnan, D., Kemp, J., &amp; Williams, V. (2010). Supported Employment for People with Intellectual Disability: The Effects of Job Breakdown on Psychological Well-Being. Journal of Applied Research in Intellectual Disabilities, 23(4), 344-354. doi:10.1111/j.1468-3148.2009.00541.x
&lt;/ref&gt; This is largely due to two main factors: production skills and effective social skills. This idea is supported by Chadsey-Rusch, who claims that securing employment for the intellectually disabled, requires adequate production skills and effective social skills.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, other underlying factors for job loss include, structural factors and the integration between worker and workplace. As stated by Kilsby, limited structural factors can effect a multitude of factors in a job. Factors such as a restricted number of hours an intellectually disabled person is allowed to work. This in return, according to Fabian, Wistow, and Schneider leads to a lack of opportunity to develop relationships with coworkers and a chance to better integrate within the workplace. Nevertheless, those who are unable to stabilize a job often are left discouraged. According to the same study conducted by JARED, many who had participated, found that they had made smaller incomes when compared to their co-workers, had an excess of time throughout their days, because they did not have work. They,also, had feelings of hopelessness and failure. According to the NOD ( National Organization On Disability), not only do the (ID) face constant discouragement, but many live below the poverty line, because they are unable to find or stabilize employment and (or) because of employee restricting factors placed on ID workers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This then causes the (ID) the incapacity to provide for themselves basic necessities one needs. Items such as, food, medical care, transportation, and housing.

=== Poverty ===
[[File:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 024.jpg|alt=painting of a group of people, some missing feet, hunched over crutches as a beggar walks past|thumb|upright|''[[The Beggars|The Cripples]]'', [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]], 1568]]
There is a global correlation between [[disability and poverty]], produced by a variety of factors. Disability and poverty may form a vicious circle, in which physical barriers and stigma of disability make it more difficult to get income, which in turn diminishes access to health care and other necessities for a healthy life.{{sfn|Yeo|2005}} The [[World report on disability]] indicates that half of all disabled people cannot afford health care, compared to a third of abled people.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, ''World report on disability'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In countries without public services for adults with disabilities, their families may be impoverished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://centrodiba.org|title=Centro DÍBÁ|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disasters ===
{{Main|Disability and disasters}}
There is limited research knowledge, but many anecdotal reports, on what happens when disasters impact disabled people.&lt;ref name="cdra.colostate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cdra.colostate.edu/Data/Sites/1/cdra-research/peek-stough2010.pdf |title=Children With Disabilities in the Context of Disaster: A Social Vulnerability Perspective |publisher=Child Development |date= |accessdate=January 31, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512111637/http://cdra.colostate.edu/Data/Sites/1/cdra-research/peek-stough2010.pdf |archivedate=May 12, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/rep-55-3-211.pdf |title=Disaster Case Management and Individuals With Disabilities |date= |accessdate=January 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with disabilities are greatly affected by disasters.&lt;ref name="cdra.colostate" /&gt;{{sfn|Stough|2009}} Those with physical disabilities can be at risk when evacuating if assistance is not available.

Research studies have consistently found discrimination against individuals with disabilities during all phases of a disaster cycle.&lt;ref name="cdra.colostate" /&gt; The most common limitation is that people cannot physically access buildings or [[transportation]], as well as access disaster-related services.&lt;ref name="cdra.colostate" /&gt; The exclusion of these individuals is caused in part by the lack of disability-related training provided to emergency planners and [[disaster relief]] personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=1546 |title=UN Enable&amp;nbsp;– Disability, natural disasters and emergency situations |publisher=Un.org |date=May 31, 2011 |accessdate=January 29, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202131058/http://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=1546 |archivedate=February 2, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
The [[International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health]] (ICF), produced by the [[World Health Organization]], distinguishes between body functions (physiological or psychological, such as vision) and body structures (anatomical parts, such as the eye and related structures). Impairment in bodily structure or function is defined as involving an anomaly, defect, loss or other significant deviation from certain generally accepted population standards, which may fluctuate over time. Activity is defined as the execution of a task or action. The ICF lists 9 broad domains of functioning which can be affected:
* Learning and applying knowledge
* General tasks and demands
* Communication
* Basic physical mobility, Domestic life, and Self-care (for example, [[activities of daily living]])
* Interpersonal interactions and relationships
* Community, social and civic life, including [[employment]]
* Other major life areas
In concert with disability scholars, the introduction to the ICF states that a variety of conceptual models have been proposed to understand and explain disability and functioning, which it seeks to integrate. These models include the following:

=== Medical model ===
{{Main|Medical model of disability}}

The [[medical model]] views disability as a problem of the person, directly caused by disease, trauma, or other health conditions which therefore requires sustained medical care in the form of individual treatment by professionals. In the medical model, management of the disability is aimed at a "cure", or the individual's adjustment and behavioral change that would lead to an "almost-cure" or effective cure. In the medical model, medical care is viewed as the main issue, and at the political level, the principal response is that of modifying or reforming [[healthcare]] policy.{{sfn|Nikora|Karapu|Hickey|Te Awekotuku|2004|p=5}}{{sfn|Donovan|2012|p=12}}

=== Social model ===
{{Main|Social model of disability}}
The social model of disability sees "disability" as a socially created problem and a matter of the full [[Inclusion (disability rights)|integration of individuals into society]]. In this model, disability is not an attribute of an individual, but rather a complex collection of conditions, created by the social environment. The management of the problem requires [[social activist|social action]] and it is the collective responsibility of society to create a society in which limitations for disabled people are minimal. Disability is both [[cultural]] and [[ideological]] in creation. According to the social model, equal access for someone with an impairment/disability is a human rights concern.{{sfn|Nikora|Karapu|Hickey|Te Awekotuku|2004|p=6–7}}{{sfn|Donovan|2012|p=12}} The social model of disability has come under criticism. While recognizing the importance played by the social model in stressing the responsibility of society, scholars, including [[Tom Shakespeare]], point out the limits of the model, and urge the need for a new model that will overcome the "medical vs. social" dichotomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shakespeare T | title = The social model of disability: An outdated ideology? | journal = Research in Social Science and Disability | volume = 2 | pages = 9–28 | year = 2001 | doi = 10.1016/S1479-3547(01)80018-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The limitations of this model mean that often the vital services and information persons with disabilities face are simply not available, often due to limited economic returns in supporting them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Christopher J.|last2=May|first2=Andrew|last3=Mitchell|first3=Val|last4=Burrows|first4=Alison|title=Capturing Volunteered Information for Inclusive Service Design: Potential Benefits and Challenges|journal=The Design Journal|date=2015|volume=16|issue=11|pages=197–218|doi=10.2752/175630613X13584367984947|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2752/175630613X13584367984947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some say [[medical humanities]] is a fruitful field where the gap between the medical and the social model of disability might be bridged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Garden R | title = Disability and narrative: new directions for medicine and the medical humanities | journal = Med. Humanit. | volume = 36 | issue = 2 | pages = 70–4 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21393285 | doi = 10.1136/jmh.2010.004143 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Social construction ====
The social construction of disability is the idea that disability is constructed by social expectations and institutions rather than biological differences. Highlighting the ways society and institutions construct disability is one of the main focuses of this idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|edition = Winter 2014|title = Naturalistic Approaches to Social Construction|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/social-construction-naturalistic/|date = 2014-01-01|first = Ron|last = Mallon|editor-first = Edward N.|editor-last = Zalta}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way that race and gender are not biologically fixed, neither is disability.

Around the early 1970s, sociologists, notably Eliot Friedson, began to argue that [[labeling theory]] and [[social deviance]] could be applied to disability studies. This led to the creation of the [[social construction of disability]] theory. The social construction of disability is the idea that disability is constructed as the social response to a deviance from the norm. The medical industry is the creator of the ill and disabled social role. Medical professionals and institutions, who wield expertise over health, have the ability to define health and physical and mental norms. When an individual has a feature that creates an impairment, restriction, or limitation from reaching the social definition of health, the individual is labeled as disabled. Under this idea, disability is not defined by the physical features of the body but by a deviance from the social convention of health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Profession of Medicine: A Study of the Sociology of Applied Knowledge |last=Freidson |first=Eliot |publisher=Harper and Row Inc |year=1970 |isbn=0-06-042205-X |location= |pages=205–210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social construction of disability would argue that the [[medical model of disability]]'s view that a disability is an impairment, restriction, or limitation is wrong. Instead what is seen as a disability is just a difference in the individual from what is considered "normal" in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of American Disability History Vol. 2 |last=Burch |first=Susan |publisher=Facts on File |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-8160-7030-5 |location= |pages=543–544}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other models ===
* The '''spectrum model''' refers to the range of audibility, sensibility, and visibility under which people function. The model asserts that disability does not necessarily mean reduced spectrum of operations. Rather, disability is often defined according to thresholds set on a continuum of disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bites August 2011 - International organisations report on disability |url=http://www.dpa.org.nz/news/bites-newsletter/55-bites-august-2011 |publisher=Disabled Persons Assembly New Zealand |accessdate=March 6, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205123349/http://dpa.org.nz/news/bites-newsletter/55-bites-august-2011 |archivedate=February 5, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''moral model''' refers to the attitude that people are ''morally responsible'' for their own disability.&lt;ref name="Disability Model"&gt;{{cite web |last=Kaplan |first=Deborah |title=Disability Model |url=http://www.peoplewho.org/debate/kaplan.htm |publisher=World Institute on Disability |accessdate=October 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, disability may be seen as a result of bad actions of parents if [[congenital]], or as a result of practicing witchcraft if not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lum|first=Doman|title=Culturally Competent Practice: A Framework for Understanding Diverse Groups and Justice Issues|year=2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9780840034434|page=449}}&lt;/ref&gt; Echoes of this can be seen in the doctrine of [[karma]] in Indian religions. It also includes notions that a disability gives a person "special abilities to perceive, reflect, transcend, be spiritual".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Olkin|first=Rhoda|title=What Psychotherapists Should Know About Disability|year=2012|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=9781462506132|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''expert/professional model''' has provided a traditional response to disability issues and can be seen as an offshoot of the medical model. Within its framework, professionals follow a process of identifying the impairment and its limitations (using the medical model), and taking the necessary action to improve the position of the disabled person. This has tended to produce a system in which an authoritarian, over-active service provider prescribes and acts for a passive client.{{sfn|Nikora|Karapu|Hickey|Te Awekotuku|2004|p=5–6}}
* The '''tragedy/charity model''' depicts disabled people as victims of circumstance who are deserving of [[pity]]. This, along with the medical model, are the models most used by non-disabled people to define and explain disability.{{sfn|Nikora|Karapu|Hickey|Te Awekotuku|2004|p=6}}
* The '''legitimacy model''' views disability as a value-based determination about which explanations for the atypical are legitimate for membership in the disability category. This viewpoint allows for multiple explanations and models to be considered as purposive and viable.{{sfn|DePoy|Gilson|2004}}
* The '''social adapted model''' states although a person's disability poses some limitations in an able-bodied society, often the surrounding society and environment are more limiting than the disability itself.{{sfn|Nikora|Karapu|Hickey|Te Awekotuku|2004|p=7}}
* The '''economic model''' defines disability in terms of reduced ability to work, the related loss of productivity and economic effects on the individual, employer and society in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Economic Model of Disability |url=http://www.copower.org/models-of-disability/176-economic-model-of-disability.html |publisher=Michigan Disability Rights Coalition |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''empowering model''' (also, '''customer model''') allows for the person with a disability and his/her family to decide the course of his/her treatment. This turns the professional into a service provider whose role is to offer guidance and carry out the client's decisions. This model "empowers" the individual to pursue his/her own goals.{{sfn|Nikora|Karapu|Hickey|Te Awekotuku|2004|p=7}}
*The '''market model''' of disability is minority rights and consumerist model of disability that recognizing disabled people and their stakeholders as representing a large group of consumers, employees and voters.  This model looks to personal identity to define disability and empowers people to chart their own destiny in everyday life, with a particular focus on economic empowerment.  By this model, based on US Census data, there are 1.2 billion people in the world who consider themselves to have a disability. "This model states that, due to the size of the demographic, companies and governments will serve the desires, pushed by demand as the message becomes prevalent in the cultural mainstream."{{sfn|Donovan|2012|p=12}}
*The '''consumer model''' of disability is based upon the “rights-based" model and claims that disabled people should have equal rights and access to products, goods and services offered by businesses.  The consumer model extends the rights-based model by proposing that businesses, not only accommodate customers with disabilities under the requirements of legislation, but that businesses actively seek, market to, welcome and fully engage disabled people in all aspects of business service activities.  The model suggests that all business operations, for example websites, policies and procedures, mission statements, emergency plans, programs and services, should integrate access and inclusion practices.  Furthermore, these access and inclusion practices should be based on established customer service access and inclusion standards that embrace and support the active engagement of people of all abilities in business offerings.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, T.B. (2012). A New and Emerging Model of Disability:  The Consumer Model.  White Paper. The Pennsylvania State University&lt;/ref&gt;
*Different theories revolve around prejudice, stereotyping, discrimination, and stigma related to disability. One of the more popular ones, as put by Weiner, Perry, and Magnusson 's (1988) work with '''attribution theory''', physical stigmas are perceived as to be un-controllable and elicit pity and desire to help, whereas, mental-behavioral stigmas are considered to be controllable and therefore elicit anger and desire to neglect the individuals with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = An attributional analysis of reactions to stigmas|author1=Weiner, B. |author2=Perry, R.

*The '''‘just world hypothesis'''’ talks about how a person is viewed as deserving the disability. And because it is the fault of that person, an observer does not feel obligated to feel bad for him or to help him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The belief in a just world: A fundamental delusion.|last = Lerner|first = M.

== Identity ==
In contexts where their differences are visible, persons with disabilities often face stigma. People frequently react to disabled presence with fear, pity, patronization, intrusive gazes, revulsion, or disregard. These reactions can, and often do, exclude persons with disabilities from accessing social spaces along with the benefits and resources these spaces provide.&lt;ref name=":1x"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://donnareeve.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ReeveChapter2004b.pdf|title=Reeve Chapter 2004|format=PDF|last=Reeve|first=Donna|publisher=The Disability Press|year=2004|isbn=0-9528450-8-3|editor-last=Barnes|editor-first=Colin|location=Leeds, U.K.|pages=83–100|chapter=Psycho-emotional dimensions of disability and the social model|editor-last2=Mercer|editor-first2=Geof}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disabled writer/researcher Jenny Morris describes how stigma functions to marginalize persons with disabilities:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://repositoriocdpd.net:8080/bitstream/handle/123456789/605/L_MorrisJ_PrideAgainstPrejudice_1991.pdf?sequence=1|title=Pride Against Prejudice Transforming Attitudes to Disability|last=Morris|first=Jenny|publisher=The Women's Press|year=1991|isbn=|location=Aylesbury, Bucks, England|pages=21, 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|“Going out in public so often takes courage. How many of us find that we can't dredge up the strength to do it day after day, week after week, year after year, a lifetime of rejection and revulsion? It is not only physical limitations that restrict us to our homes and those whom we know. It is the knowledge that each entry into the public world will be dominated by stares, by condescension, by pity and by hostility.”}}
Additionally, facing stigma can cause harm to psycho-emotional well-being of the person being stigmatized. One of the ways in which the psycho-emotional health of persons with disabilities is adversely affected is through the internalization of the oppression they experience, which can lead to feeling that they are weak, crazy, worthless, or any number of other negative attributes that may be associated with their conditions. Internalization of oppression damages the self-esteem of the person affected and shapes their behaviors in ways that are compliant with nondisabled dominance.&lt;ref name=":1x" /&gt; Ableist ideas are frequently internalized when disabled people are pressured by the people and institutions around them to hide and downplay their disabled difference, or, "pass". According to writer Simi Linton, the act of passing takes a deep emotional toll by causing disabled individuals to experience loss of community, anxiety and self-doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Linton|first1=Semi|title=Claiming Disability: Knowledge and Identity|date=1998|publisher=NYU Press|location=New York|isbn=9780814751343|pages=19–21|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail/bmxlYmtfXzQ3ODY0X19BTg2?sid=edb39fe1-bae0-4c9c-9dc5-d0c2903f2346@sessionmgr106&amp;vid=0&amp;detailAuthError=true#AN=47864&amp;db=nlebk|accessdate=3 May 2016}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The media play a significant role in creating and reinforcing stigma associated with disability. Media portrayals of disability usually cast disabled presence as necessarily marginal within society at large. These portrayals simultaneously reflect and influence the popular perception of disabled difference.

=== Tropes ===
{{Further|Disability in the media}}
There are distinct tactics that the media frequently employ in representing disabled presence. These common ways of framing disability are heavily criticized for being dehumanizing and failing to place importance on the perspectives of persons with disabilities.

==== Inspiration porn ====
[[Inspiration porn]] refers to portrayals of persons with disabilities in which they are presented as being inspiring simply because the person has a disability. These portrayals are criticized because they are created with the intent of making able-bodied viewers feel better about themselves in comparison to the individual portrayed. Rather than recognizing the humanity of persons with disabilities, inspiration porn turns them into objects of inspiration for a nondisabled audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rampup/articles/2012/07/02/3537035.htm|title=We're not here for your inspiration|website=www.abc.net.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Supercrip ====
The supercrip trope refers to instances when media reports on or portray a disabled person who has made a noteworthy achievement; but center on their disability rather than what they actually did. They are portrayed as awe-inspiring for being exceptional compared to others with the same or similar conditions. This trope is widely used in reporting on disabled athletes as well as in portrayals of autistic savants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Representing Autism Culture, Narrative, Fascination|last=Murray|first=Stuart|publisher=Liverpool University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-1-84631-092-8|location=Liverpool, U.K.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://physed.otago.ac.nz/sosol/v7i1/v7i1_1.html|title=sosol - Volume 7 Issue 1|website=physed.otago.ac.nz|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many disabled people denounce these representations as reducing people to their condition rather than viewing them as full people. Furthermore, supercrip portrayals are criticized for creating the unrealistic expectation that disability should be accompanied by some type of special talent, genius, or insight.

==== Disabled villain ====
Characters in fiction that bear physical or mental markers of difference from perceived societal norms are frequently positioned as villains within a text. Lindsey Row-Heyveld notes, for instance, “that villainous pirates are scraggly, wizened, and inevitably kitted out with a peg leg, eye patch, or hook hand whereas heroic pirates look like Johnny Depp's [[Jack Sparrow]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Row-Heyveld|first=Lindsey|date=2015|title=Reading Batman, Writing X-Men Superpowers and Disabilities in the First-Year Seminar|url=http://pedagogy.dukejournals.org/content/15/3/519.full.pdf|journal=Pedagogy: Critical Approaches to Teaching Literature, Language, Composition, and Culture| volume = 15 |number =3|doi=10.1215/15314200-2917105|pmid=|access-date=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disabled people's visible differences from the abled majority are  meant to evoke fear in audiences that can perpetuate the mindset of disabled people being a threat to individual or public interests and well-being.

=== Self advocacy ===
Some disabled people have attempted to resist [[marginalisation]] through the use of the social model in opposition to the medical model; with the aim of shifting criticism away from their bodies and impairments and towards the social institutions that oppress them relative to their abled peers. Disability activism that demands many grievances be addressed, such as lack of [[accessibility]], poor representation in media, general disrespect, and [[ignorance|lack of recognition]], originates from a social model framework.

Embracing disability as a positive identity by becoming involved in disabled communities and participating in disabled culture can be an effective way to combat internalised prejudice; and can challenge dominant narratives about disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reeve|first=Donna|date=2002|title=Negotiating Psycho-Emotional Dimensions of Disability and their Influence on Identity Constructions|url=http://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/69654/1/ReeveArticle2002.pdf|journal=Disability &amp; Society|volume=17|issue=5|doi=10.1080/09687590220148487|pmid=|access-date=April 19, 2016|pages=493–508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intersections ===

{{expand section|date=February 2018}}

The experiences that disabled people have navigating social institutions vary greatly as a function of what other social categories they may belong to. The categories that intersect with disability to create unique experiences of ableism include, but aren't limited to, race and gender. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities differentiates two kinds of disability intersection, race disability intersection and gender disability intersection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawson|first=Anna|title=European Union Non-Discrimination Law and Intersectionality:|publisher=Routledge|date=2016|url=https://books.google.am/books?id=-iu3DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;q=disability%20intersections}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Race ====
Disabled people who are also racial [[minority group|minorities]] generally have less access to support and are more vulnerable to violent discrimination. For example, in the United States people of color who are mentally ill are more frequently victims of police brutality than their white counterparts. Camille A. Nelson, writing for the ''Berkeley Journal of Criminal Law'', notes that for “people who are negatively racialized, that is people who are perceived as being non-white, and for whom mental illness is either known or assumed, interaction with police is precarious and potentially dangerous.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=Camille|title=Racializing Disability, Disabling Race: Policing Race and Mental Status|journal=Berkley Journal of Criminal Law|date=Spring 2010|volume=15|issue=1|url=http://www.bjcl.org/articles/15_1%20Nelson%20(1-64).pdf|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gender ====
The marginalization of disabled people can leave persons with disabilities unable to actualize what society expects of gendered existence. This lack of recognition for their gender identity can leave persons with disabilities with feelings of inadequacy. Thomas J. Gerschick of Illinois State University describes why this denial of gendered identity occurs:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerschick|first1=Thomas|title=Towards a Theory of Disability and Gender|journal=Signs|date=Summer 2000|volume=25|pages=1263–1268|jstor=3175525|doi=10.1086/495558}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|text="Bodies operate socially as canvases on which gender is displayed and kinesthetically as the mechanisms by which it is physically enacted. Thus, the bodies of disabled people make them vulnerable to being denied recognition as women and men."}}
To the extent that women and men with disabilities are gendered, the interactions of these two identities lead to different experiences. Disabled women face a sort of “double [[social stigma|stigmatization]]” in which their membership to both of these marginalized categories simultaneously exacerbates the negative stereotypes associated with each as they are ascribed to them. According to The UN Woman Watch, "Persistence of certain cultural, legal and institutional barriers makes women and girls with disabilities the victims of two-fold discrimination: as women and as persons with disabilities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/enable/|title=WomenWatch: Feature on Women with Disabilities|last=WomenWatch|first=UN|website=www.un.org|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Rosemarie Garland-Thomson puts it, “Women with disabilities, even more intensely than women in general, have been cast in the collective cultural imagination as inferior, lacking, excessive, incapable, unfit, and useless.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=Winter 2005|title=Feminist Disability Studies|doi=10.1086/423352|journal=Signs|volume=30|pages=1557–1587|last1=Garland-Thomson|first1=Rosemarie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assistive technology==
{{Main|Assistive technology}}
[[Assistive Technology]] is a generic term for devices and modifications (for a person or within a society) that help overcome or remove a disability. The first recorded example of the use of a [[prosthesis]] dates to at least 1800 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Disability Social History Project&amp;nbsp;– Timeline |url=http://www.disabilityhistory.org/timeline_new.html |publisher=Disabilityhistory.org |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[wheelchair]] dates from the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cooper, Rory A |author2=Hisaichi Ohnabe |author3=Douglas A. Hobson |title=An Introduction to Rehabilitation Engineering|year=2006|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781420012491|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[curb cut]] is a related structural innovation. Other examples are [[standing frames]], text [[telephones]], accessible [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboards]], [[large print]], [[Braille]], &amp; [[speech recognition]] [[software]]. Disabled people often develop personal or community adaptations, such as strategies to suppress tics in public (for example in [[Tourette's syndrome]]), or [[sign language]] in [[deaf]] communities.

As the [[personal computer]] has become more ubiquitous, various organizations have formed to [[software development|develop software]] and [[computer hardware|hardware]] to make computers more accessible for disabled people. Some software and hardware, such as [[Voice Finger]], [[Freedom Scientific]]'s ''[[JAWS (screen reader)|JAWS]]'', the Free and Open Source alternative ''[[Orca (assistive technology)|Orca]]'' etc. have been specifically designed for disabled people while other software and hardware, such as [[Nuance Communications|Nuance]]'s [[Dragon NaturallySpeaking]], were not developed specifically for disabled people, but can be used to increase accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unh.edu/disabilityservices/dragon-naturally-speaking Dragon Naturally Speaking] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408025058/http://www.unh.edu/disabilityservices/dragon-naturally-speaking |date=April 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[LOMAK]] keyboard was designed in [[New Zealand]] specifically for persons with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sobh|first=Tarek|title=Innovations and Advanced Techniques in Computer and Information Sciences and Engineering|year=2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781402062681|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The World Wide Web consortium recognised a need for International Standards for Web Accessibility for persons with disabilities and created the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/WAI/ |title=Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) - home page |publisher=W3.org |date= |accessdate=January 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As at Dec 2012 the standard is WCAG 2.0 (WCAG = Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/ |title=Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 |publisher=W3.org |date= |accessdate=January 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adapted sports==
{{Main|Disabled sports}}

[[File:Wheelchair basketball at the 2008 Summer Paralympics.jpg|alt=an athlete tilts his wheelchair and raises an arm to block his opponent's shot|thumb|upright|[[Wheelchair basketball]] match between South Africa and Iran at the [[Wheelchair basketball at the 2008 Summer Paralympics|2008 Summer Paralympics]]]]
The [[Paralympic Games]] (meaning "alongside the Olympics") are held after the (Summer and Winter) [[Olympics]]. The Paralympic Games include athletes with a wide range of physical disabilities. In member countries, organizations exist to organize competition in the Paralympic sports on levels ranging from recreational to elite (for example, [[Disabled Sports USA]] and [[BlazeSports America]] in the United States).

The Paralympics developed from a rehabilitation programme for British war veterans with spinal injuries. In 1948, Sir Ludwig Guttman, a neurologist working with World War II veterans with spinal injuries at [[Stoke Mandeville Hospital]] in [[Aylesbury]] in the UK, began using sport as part of the rehabilitation programmes of his patients.

In 2006, the [[Extremity Games]] were formed for physically disabled people, specifically limb loss or limb difference, to be able to compete in [[extreme sports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Extremity Games was first class success|url=http://www.oandp.com/articles/2006-08_12.asp|publisher=oandp.com|accessdate=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rights and government policies==
{{Main|Ableism}}

===Rights movement===
{{main|Disability rights movement}}
The disability rights movement aims to secure equal opportunities and equal rights for disabled people. The specific goals and demands of the movement are [[accessibility]] and [[safety]] in transportation, architecture, and the physical environment; equal opportunities in independent living, employment, education, and housing; and freedom from abuse, neglect, and violations of patients' rights.&lt;ref name="disabilityrightswi.org"&gt;{{cite web |title=Disability Rights Wisconsin |url=http://www.disabilityrightswi.org/priority-issues/abuse-neglect-and-patient-rights |publisher=Disabilityrightswi.org |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective civil rights legislation is sought to secure these opportunities and rights.&lt;ref name="disabilityrightswi.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Law"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bagenstos | first = Samuel | title = Law and the Contradictions of the Disability Rights Movement | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-0-300-12449-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Löve |first1=Laufey |last2=Traustadóttir |first2=Rannveig |last3=Rice |first3=James |title=Achieving disability equality: Empowering disabled people to take the lead |journal=Social Inclusion |date=26 March 2018 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |doi=10.17645/si.v6i1.1180 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/socialinclusion/article/view/1180 |accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early disability rights movement was dominated by the medical model of disability, where emphasis was placed on curing or treating disabled people so that they would adhere to the social norm, but starting in the 1960s, rights groups began shifting to the social model of disability, where disability is interpreted as an issue of discrimination, thereby paving the way for rights groups to achieve equality through legal means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kemple|first1=Miriam|last2=Ahmad|first2=Fatima|last3=Girijashanker|first3=Suraj|title=Shaping Disability Rights through Shaping the Disability Movement|journal=Journal of Human Rights Practices|date=2011|volume=3|issue=3|pages=355–363|doi=10.1093/jhuman/hur019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policies and actions===

====Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities====
On December 13, 2006, the [[United Nations]] formally agreed on the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]], the first human rights treaty of the 21st century, to protect and enhance the rights and opportunities of the world's estimated 650 million disabled people.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kayess|first1=Rosemary|last2=French|first2=Phillip|title=Out of darkness into light? Introducing the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.|journal=Human rights law review|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{as of|2011|April}}, 99 of the 147 signatories had ratified the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UN Enable&amp;nbsp;– Promoting the Rights of Persons with Disabilities |url=https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/ |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Countries that sign the convention are required to adopt national laws, and remove old ones, so that persons with disabilities will, for example, have equal rights to education, employment, and cultural life; to the right to own and inherit property; to not be discriminated against in marriage, etc.; and to not be unwilling subjects in medical experiments. UN officials, including the High Commissioner for Human Rights, have characterized the bill as representing a paradigm shift in attitudes toward a more rights-based view of disability in line with the social model.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====International Year of Disabled Persons====
In 1976, the [[United Nations]] began planning for its [[International Year of Disabled Persons]] (1981),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=International Year for Disabled Persons|journal=Public Health Reports|date=1981|volume=95|issue=5|pages=498–499}}&lt;/ref&gt; later renamed the [[International Year of Disabled Persons]]. The UN Decade of Disabled Persons (1983–1993) featured a World Programme of Action Concerning Disabled Persons. In 1979, [[Frank Bowe]] was the only person with a disability representing any country in the planning of IYDP-1981. Today, many countries have named representatives who are themselves individuals with disabilities. The decade was closed in an address before the General Assembly by [[Robert Davila]]. Both Bowe and Davila are [[deaf]]. In 1984, [[UNESCO]] accepted [[sign language]] for use in education of deaf children and youth.

====Policies in the United States====
In the United States, the Department of Labor's 2014 rules for federal contractors, defined as companies that make more than $50,000/year from the federal government, required them to have as a goal that 7% of their workforce must be disabled people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Labor Department announces final rules to improve employment of veterans, disabled people|url=https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20131578|website=U.S. Department of Labor|accessdate=18 December 2017|date=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In schools, the ADA says that all classrooms must be wheelchair accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.freeadvice.com/government_law/education_law/accommodations-for-children-with-disabilities.htm|title=Accommodations for Children with Disabilities &amp; the ADA|work=FreeAdvice}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board, commonly known as the Access Board, created the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to help offer guidelines for transportation and accessibility for the physically disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ansley |first=James |date=2000 |title=Creating Accessible Schools |website=National Clearinghouse for Educational Facilities |publisher=National Institute of Building Sciences |url=http://www.ncef.org/pubs/accessibility.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 12.6% of the U.S. population are individuals who suffer from a mental or physical disability. Many are unemployed because of prejudiced assumptions that a person with disabilities is unable to complete tasks that are commonly required in the workforce. This became a major [[Human rights]] issue because of the discrimination that this group faced when trying to apply for jobs in the U.S. Many advocacy groups protested against such discrimination, asking the [[Federation|federal government]] to implement laws and policies that would help individuals with disabilities.

=====Rehabilitation Act of 1973=====

The [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]] was enacted with the purpose of protecting individuals with disabilities from prejudicial treatment by government funded programs, employers, and agencies. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 has not only helped protect U.S. citizens from being discriminated against but it has also created confidence amongst individuals to feel more comfortable with their disability. There are many sections within The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, that contains detailed information about what is covered in this policy.

; Section 501
:   An employer must hire an individual who meets the qualifications of a job description despite any preexisting disabilities.
; Section 503
:   Requires contractors or subcontractors, who receive more than $10,000 from the government to hire people with disabilities and to accommodate them with the needs that they need to achieve in the work force.
; [[Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act|Section 504]]
:   States that receive federal money may not discriminate against any person with disabilities who qualifies for a program or job.

=====The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990=====

The federal government enacted The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which was created to allow equal opportunity for jobs, access to private and government funded facilities, and transportation for disabled people. This act was created with the purpose to ensure that employers would not discriminate against any individual despite their disability. In 1990, data was gathered to show the percentage of disabled people who worked in the U.S. Out of the 13% who filled out the survey, only 53% percent of individuals with disabilities worked while 90% of this group population did not, the government wanted to change this, they wanted Americans with disabilities to have the same opportunities as those who did not have a disability. The [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA]] not only required corporations to hire disabled people but that they also accommodate them and their needs.

; Title I: Employment
:   An employer must give a qualified individual with disabilities the same opportunities as any other employee despite their disability. The employer must offer equal work privileges to someone who has a disability including but not limited to pay, work hours, training, etc. The employer must also create accommodations suitable for the person and their physical or mental disabilities.
; Title II: State and Local Government Activities
:   Requires that the government give disabled people the same opportunities involving work, programs, building access, and services. Title II also requires that buildings create easy access for disabled people and provide communicators who will be able to help those with [[Hearing loss|hearing]] or speaking impairments. Public spaces are however not required to create accommodations that would in turn alter their services as long as the services proved that they did all they could to prevent discrimination against disabled people.f
; Title II: Transportation
:   [[Public transport]]ation should be customized so that disabled people may have easy access to public transit. [[Paratransit]] is a service that provides transportation to people who are unable to get from one destination to another due to their mental or physical disability.
; Title II: Public Accommodations
:   Public accommodations require that private businesses create accommodations that will allow disabled people easy access to buildings. Private businesses may not discriminate against disabled people and must provide accommodations that are reasonable, alterations may be made so that a person with disabilities can have equal access to facilities that are provided, communicators for the [[hearing impaired]], devices for the visually impaired, and wheelchair access. Facilities must regulate with the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA]], when regulating the buildings infrastructure so it meets the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA]] regulations.
; Title IV: Telecommunication Relay Services
:   Requires telephone companies to have [[Telecommunications relay service|TRS]] seven days a week, twenty four hours a day. It requires telephone companies to create accommodations for deaf/hard of hearing people by providing a third party that will be able to assistant both parties in communicating with one another.

====Policies in the United Kingdom====
In the UK, the Department for Work and Pension is a government department responsible for promoting disability awareness and among its aims is to increase the understanding of disability and removal of barriers for disabled people in the workplace. According to a news report, a people survey conducted in the UK shows a 23% increase in reported discrimination and harassment in the workplace at The Department for Work and Pension. The survey shows the number of reports for discrimination due to disability was in majority compared to discrimination due to gender, ethnicity or age. DWP received criticism for the survey results. As a department responsible for tackling discrimination at work, the DWP results may indicate room for improvement from within. A DWP spokesperson said the survey results do not necessarily indicate an increase in the number of reports, but rather reflecting the outcomes of efforts to encourage people to come forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Disabled staff at the DWP are reporting increased discrimination|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/disabled-dwp-staff-report-increased-discrimination-in-the-workplace-a6856191.html|website = The Independent|access-date = 2016-02-07|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political issues===
{{refimprove section|date=February 2010}}
[[File:USMC-00772.jpg|alt=woman seated in a wheelchair with military personnel in background|thumb|left|upright|A 28-year-old Iraqi woman who lost both of her legs during the [[Iraq War]] in 2005]]
Political [[rights]], [[social inclusion]] and [[citizenship]] have come to the fore in developed and some developing countries. The debate has moved beyond a concern about the perceived cost of maintaining dependent disabled people to finding effective ways to ensure that disabled people can participate in and contribute to society in all spheres of life.

In developing nations, where the vast bulk of the estimated 650 million disabled people reside, a great deal of work is needed to address concerns ranging from accessibility and education to self-empowerment, self-supporting employment, and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/disabilities/documents/toolaction/pwdfs.pdf|title=Fact Sheet on Persons with Disabilities, by United Nation|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past few years, disability rights activists have focused on obtaining full citizenship for the disabled.

There are obstacles in some countries in getting full employment; public perception of disabled people may vary.

====Abuse====
{{main|Disability abuse}}
Disability abuse happens when a person is abused physically, financially, verbally or mentally due to the person having a disability. As many disabilities are not visible (for example, asthma, learning disabilities) some abusers cannot rationalize the non-physical disability with a need for understanding, support, and so on.

As the prevalence of disability and the cost of supporting disability increases with medical advancement and longevity in general, this aspect of society becomes of greater political importance. How political parties treat their disabled constituents may become a measure of a political party's understanding of disability, particularly in the social model of disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hough |first=Andrew |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9626664/Disability-hate-crimes-rise-by-a-quarter-in-a-year.html |title='Disability hate crimes' rise by a quarter in a year |publisher=Telegraph |date=October 23, 2012 |accessdate=January 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Insurance====
Disability benefit, or [[disability pension]], is a major kind of [[disability insurance]] that is provided by government agencies to people who are temporarily or permanently unable to work due to a disability. In the U.S., disability benefit is provided in the category of [[Supplemental Security Income]]. In Canada, it is within the [[Canada Pension Plan]]. In other countries, disability benefit may be provided under [[social security]] systems.

Costs of disability pensions are steadily growing in Western countries, mainly in Europe and the United States. It was reported that, in the UK, expenditure on disability pensions accounted for 0.9% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1980; two decades later it had reached 2.6% of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;OECD. Transforming disability into ability: Policies to promote work and income security for disabled people.

A study by researchers in Denmark suggests that information on self-reported days of absence due to sickness can be used to effectively identify future potential groups for disability pension.&lt;ref name="Labriola-Lund-2007"/&gt; These studies may provide useful information for policy makers, case managing authorities, employers, and physicians.

Private, for-profit disability insurance plays a role in providing incomes to disabled people, but the nationalized programs are the safety net that catch most claimants.

==Demographics==

Estimates of worldwide and country-wide numbers of individuals with disabilities are problematic. The varying approaches taken to defining disability notwithstanding, demographers agree that the world population of individuals with disabilities is very large. For example, in 2012, the [[World Health Organization]] estimated a world population of 6.5 billion people. Of those, nearly 650 million people, or 10%, were estimated to be moderately or severely disabled.&lt;ref name="World Health Organization"&gt;{{cite web |title=Disability World Report 2011 |url=http://www.who.int/disabilities/world_report/2011/report/en/ |publisher=World Health Organization |year=2011 |accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2018 the [[International Labour Organization]] estimated that about a billion people, one seventh of the world population, had disabilities, 80% of them in developing countries, and 80% of working age.  Excluding disabled people from the workforce was reckoned to cost up to 7% of [[gross domestic product]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=For many, disability is part of what it means to be human |url=https://www.ft.com/content/f4e2dc50-3dab-11e8-bcc8-cebcb81f1f90 |accessdate=14 August 2018 |publisher=Financial Times |date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
According to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], {{as of|2010|lc=y}}, there were some 56.7 million disabled people, or 19% (by comparison, African Americans are the largest racial minority in the U.S., but only constitute 12.6% of the U.S. population).&lt;ref name="U.S. Bureau of the Census"&gt;{{cite web |title=American FactFinder |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/STTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_S1801&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_ |publisher=Factfinder.census.gov |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell|year=1991|title=The Demographics of Disability|url=|journal=The Milbank Quarterly|volume=69|pages=55–77|doi=10.2307/3350158}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2014 Disability status report of the Cornell University Yang Tan Institute the prevalence rate of individuals with disabilities in the United States was 12.6% in that year. {{as of|2014}} ambulatory disability had the highest prevalence (7.1%) in the United States. By contrast, visual disability had the lowest prevalence (2.3%). Additionally, 3.6% of people in the United States were reported to have had an auditory disability in the same year.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erickson|first=W.|year=2014|title=2014 Disability Status Report: United States|url=|journal=Cornell University Yang Tan Institute on Employment and Disability|volume=|pages=1–65|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

5.8% of individuals ages 16–20 reported having any disability, physical and/ or cognitive. Adults 21 to 64 had a prevalence of 10.8% with over half of these (5.5%) being ambulatory disabilities. Ambulatory disability prevalence raised to 15.8% in adults 65–74 years of age. Adults 75 years and older comprised the highest prevalence with any disability at 50.3%.

Female individuals across all ages reported a total 0.4% higher prevalence rate than males who reported 12.4%.

In the U.S. 17.9% of Native American peoples reported having a disability while 4.5% reporting were of Asian descent, these were the two opposing poles of the prevalence rate within race {{as of|2014|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Although there are acts that have been imposed in order to prevent the discrimination of individuals with disabilities in the workplace, there is still an employment gap that can be seen between those with and without disabilities. In regards to employment, the institute's status report accounts that 34.6% of people with any disability reported being employed. By comparison; 77.6% of individuals, who did not report having a disability, reported having a full-time job in 2014.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

For those employed full-time, individuals with disabilities on average earned $5,100 less than employees without a disability who were also employed full-time. Those affected the most by these differences were intellectually disabled people.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Europe===
Nearly 8 million European men were permanently disabled in [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kitchen |first=Martin |year=2000 |origyear=1980 |title=Europe Between the Wars |location=New York |publisher=Longman |isbn=0-582-41869-0 |oclc=247285240}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 150,000 [[Vietnam veteran]]s came home wounded, and at least 21,000 were permanently disabled.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=513 The War's Costs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030907033319/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=513 |date=September 7, 2003 }}".

===Developing nations===
There is widespread agreement among experts{{who|date=May 2014}} in the field, that disability is more common in developing than in developed nations. The connection between [[disability and poverty]] is thought to be part of a "vicious cycle" in which these constructs are mutually reinforcing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Yeo R., Moore K. | year = 2003 | title = Including disabled people in poverty reduction work: "Nothing about us, without us" | doi = 10.1016/S0305-750X(02)00218-8 | journal = World Development | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 571–590 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Femur-fibula-ulna syndrome''' (FFU syndrome) or '''femur-fibula-ulna complex''' is a very rare syndrome characterized by abnormalities of the [[femur]] (thigh bone), [[fibula]] (calf bone) and the [[ulna]] (forearm bone). There have been suggestions that FFU complex may be the same as [[proximal femoral focal deficiency]] (PFFD) although authors are currently in disagreement over whether or not the disorders are in fact separate. The breadth of the abnormality and number of limbs involved is considered sporadic although upper limbs are more affected than lower limbs and right side malformation is more prevalent than the left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?lng=EN&amp;Expert=2019 |title=Orphanet: Femur fibula ulna complex |publisher=Orpha.net |date= |accessdate=2011-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The condition was first noted by Lenz and Feldman in 1977.&lt;ref name=Holmes2011 &gt;{{citation | last=Holmes | first=Lewis B. | year=2011 | title=Common Malformations | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-513602-9  | page=178 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HV8yZBzeFQIC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26887">'''Fungiculture''' is the process of producing food, [[medicinal mushrooms|medicine]], and other products by the cultivation of [[mushrooms]] and other [[fungi]]. A ''mushroom farm'' is in the business of growing fungi.

The word is also commonly used to refer to the practice of cultivating fungi by [[leafcutter ant]]s, [[termite]]s, [[ambrosia beetle]]s, and [[Littoraria irrorata|marsh periwinkle]]s.

== Introduction ==
[[Mushroom]]s are not [[plant]]s, and require different conditions for optimal growth. Plants develop through [[photosynthesis]], a process that converts atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] into [[carbohydrate]]s, especially [[cellulose]]. While [[sunlight]] provides an [[energy]] source for plants, mushrooms derive all of their energy and growth materials from their growth medium, through biochemical [[decomposition]] processes. This does not mean that [[light]] is an irrelevant requirement, since some fungi use light as a signal for fruiting.&lt;ref name="r10"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, all the materials for growth must already be present in the growth medium. Mushrooms grow well at relative [[humidity]] levels of around 95–100%, and [[substrate (biology)|substrate]] moisture levels of 50 to 75%.&lt;ref name = "r10" /&gt;

Instead of [[seed]]s, mushrooms reproduce asexually through [[spore]]s. Spores can be contaminated with airborne [[microorganism]]s, which will interfere with mushroom growth and prevent a healthy crop.

[[Mycelium]], or actively growing mushroom culture, is placed on a substrate—usually sterilized grains such as rye or millet—and induced to grow into those grains. This is called inoculation. Inoculated grains are referred to as spawn. Spores are another inoculation option, but are less developed than established mycelium. Since they are also contaminated easily, they are only manipulated in laboratory conditions with a [[laminar flow cabinet]].

== Techniques ==
All mushroom growing techniques require the correct combination of humidity, temperature, substrate (growth medium) and inoculum (spawn or starter culture). Wild harvests, outdoor log inoculation and indoor trays all provide these elements.

=== Outdoor logs ===
[[File:Cultivo tradicional de shiitake en Pradejón.jpg|thumb|right|Cultivated shiitake mushrooms]]
Mushrooms can be grown on logs placed outdoors in stacks or piles, as has been done for hundreds of years.&lt;ref name="r18"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Here, tree logs are inoculated with spawn, then allowed to grow as they would in wild conditions. Fruiting, or pinning, is triggered by seasonal changes, or by briefly soaking the logs in cool water.&lt;ref name="r18"/&gt; [[Shiitake]] and [[oyster mushroom]]s have traditionally been produced using the outdoor log technique, although controlled techniques such as indoor tray growing or artificial logs made of compressed substrate have been substituted.&lt;ref name="r19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r20"&gt;

Shiitake mushrooms grown under a forested canopy are considered non-timber forest products&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mudge|first=Kenneth|title=Forest Farming|journal=The Magazine of the Arnold Arboretum|volume=67|pages=26–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Northeast{{where|date=August 2017}} shiitake mushrooms can be cultivated on a variety of hardwood logs including oak, American beech, sugar maple and hophornbeam. Softwood should not be used to cultivate shiitake mushrooms.&lt;ref name="Cornell Cooperative Extension"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Shiitake Mushroom Cultivation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resin of softwoods will oftentimes inhibit the growth of the shiitake mushroom making it impractical as a growing substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bruhn|first=J.N.|author2=Mihail J.D.|title=Forest farming of shiitake mushrooms: Aspects of forced fruiting|journal=Bioresource Technology|year=2009|volume=100|issue=23|pages=5973–5978|doi=10.1016/j.biortech.2009.01.079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to produce shiitake mushrooms, 1 metre (3 foot) hardwood logs with a diameter ranging between {{convert|10|-|15|cm|abbr=on|0}} are inoculated with the mycelium of the shiitake fungus. Inoculation is completed by drilling holes in hardwood logs, filling the holes with cultured shiitake mycelium or inoculum, and then sealing the filled holes with hot wax. After inoculation, the logs are placed under the closed canopy of a coniferous stand and are left to incubate for 12 to 15 months. Once incubation is complete, the logs are soaked in water for 24 hours. 7 to 10 days after soaking, shiitake mushrooms will begin to fruit and can be harvested once fully ripe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leatham|first=G.F.|title=Cultivation of shiitake, the japanese forest mushroom, on logs: A potential industry for the united states|journal=Forest Products Laboratory|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indoor trays ===
Indoor growing provides the ability to tightly regulate light, temperature and humidity while excluding contaminants and pests. This allows consistent production, regulated by spawning cycles.&lt;ref name="r2"/&gt;  This is typically accomplished in windowless, purpose-built buildings, for large scale commercial production.

Indoor tray growing is the most common commercial technique, followed by containerized growing. The tray technique provides the advantages of scalability and easier harvesting. Unlike wild harvests, indoor techniques provide tight control over growing substrate composition and growing conditions. Indoor harvests are much more predictable.

According to [[Daniel Royse]] and [[Robert Beelman]], "[Indoor] Mushroom farming consists of six steps, and although the divisions are somewhat arbitrary, these steps identify what is needed to form a production system. The six steps are phase I composting, phase II fertilizing, spawning, casing, pinning, and cropping."&lt;ref name="r5"&gt;

Complete sterilization is not always required or performed during composting. In some cases, a pasteurization step is not included to allow some beneficial microorganisms to remain in the growth substrate.&lt;ref name="r5" /&gt;

Specific time spans and temperatures required during stages 3–6 will vary respective to species and variety. Substrate composition and the geometry of growth substrate will also affect the ideal times and temperatures.

Pinning is the trickiest part for a mushroom grower, since a combination of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) concentration, temperature, light, and humidity triggers mushrooms towards fruiting.&lt;ref name = "r10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r5" /&gt; Up until the point when [[mycelial cord|rhizomorph]]s or mushroom "pins" appear, the mycelium is an amorphous mass spread throughout the growth substrate, unrecognizable as a mushroom.

Carbon dioxide concentration becomes elevated during the vegetative growth phase, when mycelium is sealed in a gas-resistant plastic barrier or bag which traps gases produced by the growing mycelium. To induce pinning, this barrier is opened or ruptured. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration then decreases from about 0.08% to 0.04%, the ambient [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric level]].&lt;ref name="r5"/&gt;

== Substrates ==
Mushroom production converts the raw natural ingredients into mushroom tissue, most notably the carbohydrate [[chitin]].&lt;ref name = "r10" /&gt;

An ideal substrate will contain enough [[nitrogen]] and [[carbohydrate]] for rapid mushroom growth. Common bulk substrates include several of the following ingredients:&lt;ref name = "r2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r1"&gt;

Mushrooms metabolize complex [[carbohydrates]] in their substrate into [[glucose]], which is then transported through the mycelium as needed for growth and energy. While it is used as a main energy source, its concentration in the growth medium should not exceed 2%. For ideal fruiting, closer to 1% is ideal.&lt;ref name = "r10" /&gt;

=== Coffee grounds ===
One of the most sustainable ways of mushroom cultivation is using coffee grounds as a substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mushroom-cultivation.com/|title=Mushroom-cultivation|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process was pioneered by Prof. Chang Shuting &lt;ref&gt;http://www.mushroominfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Chang-Bio-FINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in the early 1990s while he worked at the Chinese University in Hong Kong. Coffee ground are sterile, and rich in fibers. It is more environmentally-friendly; as an estimated millions of kilos of coffee waste disposed in landfill every day, which could be diverted into [[sustainable]] food production. The spent substrate, after harvesting mushrooms, is enriched in essential amino-acids, and therefore an ideal feed for animals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sistemekofungi.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pests and diseases ==

Parasitic insects, bacteria and other fungi all pose risks to indoor production. The [[sciarid fly]] or [[phorid fly]] may lay eggs in the growth medium, which hatch into [[maggots]] and damage developing mushrooms during all growth stages. Bacterial blotch caused by ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' bacteria or patches of ''[[Trichoderma]]'' green mold also pose a risk during the fruiting stage. Pesticides and sanitizing agents are available to use against these infestations.&lt;ref name="r2"&gt;

== Production in Europe ==
The oyster mushroom cultivation lately is taking off in Europe. Many entrepreneurs nowadays find it as a quite profitable business, a start-up with a small investment and good profit. Italy with 785,000 tonnes and Netherlands with 307,000 tonnes are between the top ten mushroom producing countries in the world. The world’s biggest producer of mushroom spawn&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sylvaninc.com/|title=Sylvan Inc. - World's Largest Mushroom Spawn Producer - Spawn|website=www.sylvaninc.com|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also situated in France.

According to a research carried out on Production and Marketing of Mushrooms: Global and National Scenario&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wakchaure|first=G C|date=2011-02-01|title=Production and Marketing of Mushrooms: Global and National Scenario|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235951347_Production_and_Marketing_of_Mushrooms_Global_and_National_Scenario|journal=ResearchGate|doi=10.13140/RG.2.1.5012.3682}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Poland]], [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Lithuania]] are the major exporting mushrooms countries in [[Europe]] and countries like [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Russia]] are considered to be the major importing countries.

== Education and training ==
[[Pleurotus|Oyster mushroom]] cultivation is a sustainable business where different natural resources can be used as a substrate. The number of people becoming interested in this field is rapidly increasing. The possibility of creating a viable business in urban environments by using coffee grounds is appealing for many entrepreneurs.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Since mushroom cultivation is not a subject available at school, most urban farmers learned it by doing. The time to master mushroom cultivation is time consuming and costly in missed revenue. For this reason there are numerous companies in Europe specialized in mushroom cultivation that are offering training for entrepreneurs and organizing events to build community and share knowledge.

'''Geoffrey D. Lehmann''' (12 January 1904 – 15 April 1994) was a religious and medical [[missionary]] founded and built the Herbertpur Christian Hospital  along with his wife Monica Lehmann, in the [[Herbertpur]] village, located in the [[Doon Valley]] in [[India]] in 1936.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/27934134|title=Himalayan heartbeat|last=1917-2006|first=Anderson, Ken,|date=1992|publisher=Christian Literature Crusade|isbn=0875080049|edition=[2nd ed.]|location=Fort Washington, PA|oclc=27934134}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmf.org.uk/resources/publications/content/?context=article&amp;id=26153|title=Herbertpur Christian Hospital, Dehradun district, Uttarakhand, India, 2012 - Radford Smith|website=Christian Medical Fellowship - cmf.org.uk|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The hospital is now operated as the EHA Herbertpur Christian Hospital and includes the nursing school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EAS Hospitals: Herbertpur Christian Hospital|url=http://www.ehausa.org/hospitals_herbertpur.html|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of his mission was to spread the [[Christian]] faith among a largely [[Hindu]] and [[Muslim]] population in Herbertpur and surrounding areas as well as to provide medical care and treatment at extremely cheap or no cost to the villagers.

Lehmann was born in 1904 in [[London]] and attended prep school as a child. He later trained as an engineer from [[Oxford University]], after which he pursued medicine from the same university.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Lehmann specialized in [[ophthalmology]] and [[tropical medicine]], but carried out a wide range of surgical and consultation treatments in the Herbertpur Hospital.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

He also served as the Chairman of Board of Governors at [[Wynberg Allen School]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== &lt;small&gt;Early Life&lt;/small&gt; ==
Lehmann was born on January 12, 1904, near the [[Alexandra Palace]] in [[London]], [[England]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Himalayan Heartbeat: Twentieth Century Stewardship in First Century Dimensions|last=Anderson|first=Ken|publisher=Waco, Tex.: Word Books,|year=1965|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family resided on a farm near [[Sherwood Forest|Sherwood]] in [[Nottinghamshire]], where they raised chickens, ducks, turkeys, cows and more animals. As a child, Lehmann’s parents tried to raise him with wholesome experiences, as he enjoyed many different past-times such as: watching the Queen’s servants on the royal grounds, enjoying nature, and watching the family’s chauffeur turn on their steam engines.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Growing up, Lehmann was a member of England’s [[Children's Special Service Mission|Children’s Special Service Mission]], a youth evangelism group also referred to as CSSM. Lehmann took interest in the missionaries who frequented his childhood home.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, after a bad encounter with a Scandinavian worker, Lehmann decided that he no longer want to be a missionary. As a young boy, Lehmann believed in the Christian doctrine, but he did not like that parents tend to over-shelter their children from the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Education ==
Lehmann attended the Plymouth Brethren Primary School, a prep school which was operated by strict adherent of the Plymouth Brethren. Lehmann was sufficiently exposed to Christian teachings as part of his primary education.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

He trained as an engineer in the Oxford University and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in civil and mechanical engineering.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

He then trained in medicine from [[Liverpool University]] Medical School and travelled to the US to intern at the [[Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital]] to study with Dr. Chester Mayo.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Lehmann practiced corneal grafting at Boston Hospital before returning to Liverpool to study tropical medicine.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Personal life ==
As the age of twelve, Lehmann met Monica Allen while on a holiday. They had become good friends, but Lehmann initially had no thought of marrying Monica, as she wanted to one day return to India as a missionary.

When finishing up his doctorate education in engineering, Lehmann felt a sudden need of a spiritual refresher. He decided to attend the [[Keswick Convention|Keswick convention]], where the speakers discussed the global need for medical missionaries. At the time, Lehmann felt like God was speaking to him and that this was his calling.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When Lehmann came to this realization, he realized that he and Monica must have been destined to be with each other, as Monica dreamed of being a missionary from a young age.

Lehmann and Monica had three daughters and one son.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title="Geoffrey Lehmann"|last=|first=|date=May 14, 1994|work=The London Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.myjacobfamily.com/favershamjacobs/geoffreylehmann.htm|title=Geoffrey Lehmann|website=www.myjacobfamily.com|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first child, Priscilla Ruth, was born in [[Kachhwa]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Petronella Anna was born in March 1937, Donald in May 1940, and Susana Joan in December 1946.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; At a young age, both Priscilla and Petrinilla were sent to London as there were no school in Herbertpur to educate them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Missionary work ==
On their arrival in India, Dr. Lehmann and his wife first worked in a hospital in [[Kachhwa]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Lehmann worked in Kacchwa for 18 months where his daily routine included operations in the mornings and afternoon with routine check-ups in between and language study in the evening. In Kachhwa, the Lehmanns distributed Christian literature for a small fee.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

The Lehmanns established the Herbertpur Hospital in November 1936,&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; in Herbertpur village, 25 miles away from Dehradun. The hospital became popular amongst locals in a short period of time and was visited by over 2000 people daily shortly after its opening. The hospital was mainly visited by low-income people from backward classes but catered to people from all socio-economic classes including [[Brahmin]]s, farmers and merchants.

By 1937, the Lehmanns built a larger building for the hospital and treated nearly 3000 patients a day along with their staff.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

During the second world war, the hospital was closed for nearly a year due to limitation of staff and because Dr. Lehmann was himself asked to serve in the war front.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The hospital reopened in 1954,&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; with two operating theaters, special eye wards, male and female general wards, [[midwifery]] and [[tuberculosis]] block and private rooms. Dr. Lehmann carried out treatments as complex as [[cataract]] removal surgery, [[appendectomy]], and blood infection treatments at the Herbertpur Hospital.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In addition to medical services, the hospital also exposed to patients to Christianity during their stay in the hospital. Gospel service was carried out daily in the hospital yard by the hospital’s evangelist, Mr. Mall. Lehmann also often included himself in the service for he felt that his involvement would mean a lot to the patients and would help in strengthening their beliefs.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Dr. Lehmann along with his wife also established a number of schools in the region. These also served as establishments for congregation. Dr. Lehmann also worked with the Evangelical Alliance Mission and served as the chairman on board of governors for the Wynberg Allen School. This school provided education to children form displaced [[Tibet]]an families living in the Himalayan valley.

== Opposition ==
Throughout his time in India, Lehmann faced opposition for trying to convert Indians to Christianity. In general, there was a lack of enthusiasm about Christianity—even from local Christians—as Indians did not like talking about the crucifixion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; From time to time, the hospital and the school were able to influence locals to convert, however, when the villagers would return to their home, some inevitable turned away from Christianity due to the local opposition and resistance.

Multiple parties pressured missionaries in India, such as the [[Arya Samaj|Arya Samahajhist]]s, one of the more violent group of protesters. At one point, even the District Magistrate told Lehmann that they would close down his hospital if he continued to preach about Christianity, as he was considered to be taking advantage of those who needed medical help. Despite the opposition, Lehmann continued to preach and distributed Christian literature and films to connect with the people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.intercommedia.org/newsletter/archive_1007.htm|title=InterComm Torch Newsletter|website=www.intercommedia.org|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most medical evangelists gave full attention to their medical work and left missionary work for the local evangelists.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, Lehmann believed that paying attention to people's souls was just as important as healing them physically, and took a liking to the title "Missionary Medic."

== Legacy ==
The Herbertpur Hospital became a member of the [http://www.ehausa.org/hospitals_herbertpur.html Emmanuel Hospital Association] (EHA) in 1973 and continues to serve patients across the Doon valley to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hch-eha.org/1/index.php/about-us/history|title=History|last=Administrator|website=hch-eha.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lehmanns established the Herbertpur Trust to encourage national evangelism programs.

Dr. Geoffrey Lehmann’s life and work were the subject of ''The Himalayan Heartbeat'', a book written by Ken Anderson, which was published in 1965.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

'''Health Consumer Powerhouse''' is a Swedish health policy [[think tank]] which specialises in comparing healthcare systems throughout [[Europe]]. It produces the [[Euro health consumer index]] and other indexes comparing healthcare.

It was created in 2004 by [[Johan Hjertqvist]], a Swedish entrepreneur, author and former local politician. It has offices in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;Allabolag.se, collected 2012-03-26. {{cite web |url=http://www.allabolag.se/5566682182/Health_Consumer_Powerhouse_AB |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120722172132/http://www.allabolag.se/5566682182/Health_Consumer_Powerhouse_AB |archivedate=2012-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr [[Arne A Björnberg]] is the President of the company.  he was formerly Chief Executive of the [[Swedish National Pharmacy Corporation]].

The Euro Health Consumer Index is a comparison of [[Europe]]an [[health care system]]s based on waiting times, results, and generosity. The information is presented as a graphic index.  Part of the motivation of the HCP in 2004 was to stimulate the European Union to take action on transparency and quality measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Outcomes in EHCI 2015|url=http://www.healthpowerhouse.com/files/EHCI_2015/EHCI_2015_report.pdf|accessdate=27 January 2016|publisher=Health Consumer Powerhouse|date=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2014 ranking included 37 countries measured by 48 indicators.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthpowerhouse.com/files/ehci-2013/ehci-2013-index-matrix-a3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
The Euro Health Consumer Index measurements started in 2005. During 2013 the [[European Commission]] assessed available systems for healthcare comparison including [[WHO]], [[OECD]], [[European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies|European Observatory]] and so forth and concluded that this is the most reliable. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ehealth-innovation.eu/about-the-project/single-view/article/ehealth-innovation-partner-hcps-health-consumer-powerhouse-ehci-is-leading-measurement-of-natio/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518083946/http://ehealth-innovation.eu/about-the-project/single-view/article/ehealth-innovation-partner-hcps-health-consumer-powerhouse-ehci-is-leading-measurement-of-natio/ |archivedate=2015-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scoring is partly based on the responses from patient organisations to a questionnaire, particularly when their responses indicate a radically different situation from that officially reported. 976 responses were used in the 2015 exercise.

'''Heilpraktiker''' ("healing practitioner") is a [[naturopathic]] profession in [[Germany]]. It is recognized as an [[Alternative medicine|alternative and complementary health care]] profession by German law.&lt;ref&gt;Gesetz über die berufsmäßige Ausübung der Heilkunde ohne Bestallung (Heilpraktikergesetz), 17.02.1939.&lt;/ref&gt; A heilpraktiker does not need to have any formal [[education]] or training but must do an exam at the health authorities. This exam used to be somewhat basic until the 1980s, at which time it was made to become much more demanding. A candidate needs to have good knowledge of [[medical science]]s, such as [[anatomy]], [[physiology]] and [[pathology]] and psychiatry; a good knowledge of law regulations is also needed.&lt;ref&gt;Erste Durchführungsverordnung zum Gesetz über die berufsmäßige Ausübung der Heilkunde ohne Bestallung (Heilpraktikergesetz), 18.02.1939.&lt;/ref&gt; Healing practitioners often specialize in a complementary and alternative field of healthcare that could be anything from [[homeopathy]], [[phytotherapy]], [[Chinese medicine]], [[Ayurvedic medicine]], to [[reflexology]] or [[acupuncture]]. A healing practitioner is a person who is allowed to practice as a non-medical practitioner using any unconventional therapy. About 35000 heilpraktiker are accredited in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.destatis.de/DE/Publikationen/Thematisch/Gesundheit/Gesundheitspersonal/PersonalPDF_2120731.pdf Federal Statistical Office of Germany: Gesundheitspersonal 2011 nach Berufen (Fachserie 12 Reihe 7.3.1), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids''' ('''HDLS''') is a rare adult onset [[autosomal dominant disorder]] characterized by [[cerebrum|cerebral]] [[white matter]] degeneration with demyelination and [[axon]]al spheroids leading to progressive cognitive and motor dysfunction. Spheroids are axonal swellings with discontinuous or absence of [[myelin]] sheaths. It is believed that the disease arises from primary microglial dysfunction that leads to secondary disruption of axonal integrity, neuroaxonal damage, and focal axonal spheroids leading to [[Demyelinating disease|demyelination]]. Spheroids in HDLS resemble to some extent those produced by [[shear stress]] in a [[closed head injury]] with damage to axons, causing them to swell due to blockage of [[axoplasmic transport]]. In addition to trauma, axonal spheroids can be found in aged brain, stroke, and in other degenerative diseases.&lt;ref name = "Lin 2010"&gt;Lin, W. L., Wszolek, Z. K., &amp; Dickson, D. W. (2010). Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids: ultrastructural and immunoelectron microscopic studies. Int J Clin Exp Pathol, 3(7), 665-674.&lt;/ref&gt; In HDLS, it is uncertain whether demyelination occurs prior to the axonal spheroids or what triggers neurodegeneration after apparently normal brain and white matter development, although genetic deficits suggest that demyelination and axonal pathology may be secondary to microglial dysfunction.&lt;ref name="Sundal 2012 Misdiagnosed"&gt;Sundal, C., Lash, J., Aasly, J., Oygarden, S., Roeber, S., Kretzschman, H., . . .

J Neurol Sci, 314(1-2), 130-137. doi: 10.1016/j.jns.2011.10.006&lt;/ref&gt; The clinical syndrome in patients with HDLS is not specific and it can be mistaken for [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[frontotemporal dementia]], [[Parkinsonism|atypical Parkinsonism]], [[multiple sclerosis]], or [[corticobasal degeneration]].&lt;ref name="Wider 2009"&gt;Wider, C., Van Gerpen, J. A., DeArmond, S., Shuster, E. A., Dickson, D. W., &amp; Wszolek, Z. K. (2009). Leukoencephalopathy with spheroids (HDLS) and pigmentary leukodystrophy (POLD): a single entity? Neurology, 72(22), 1953–1959. doi: 10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181a826c0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical symptoms==

With symptoms of personality changes, behavioral changes, [[dementia]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and epilepsy, HDLS has been commonly misdiagnosed for a number of other diseases.&lt;ref name="Rademakers 2012"&gt;Rademakers, R., Baker, M., Nicholson, A., Rutherford, N., Finch, N., Soto-Ortolaza, A., . . . Wszolek, Z. (2012). Mutations in the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) cause hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids. Movement Disorders, 27, S399-S400.&lt;/ref&gt; Dementia or frontotemporal behavioral changes, for example, have commonly steered some clinicians to mistakenly consider diagnoses such as Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia or atypical Parkinsonism. The presence of white matter changes has led to misdiagnosis of multiple sclerosis. HDLS commonly manifests with [[Neuropsychiatry|neuropsychiatric]] symptoms, progressing to dementia, and after a few years shows motor dysfunction. Eventually patients become wheelchair-bound or bedridden.&lt;ref name="Wider 2009"/&gt;

White matter degeneration is associated with and makes differential diagnoses out of other adult onset leukodystrophies such as [[metachromatic leukodystrophy]] (MLD), [[Krabbe disease]] (globoid cell leukodystrophy), and X-linked [[adrenoleukodystrophy]] (X-ADL).&lt;ref name="Sundal 2012 Misdiagnosed"/&gt;

===Neuropsychiatric symptoms===
Many neuropsychiatric symptoms have been identified in clinical studies of HDLS patients. These include severe depression and anxiety that have been identified in about 70% of HDLS families, verging on suicidal tendencies and [[substance abuse]] such as [[alcoholism]]. Additionally, patients may exhibit disorientation, confusion, agitation, irritability, aggressiveness, an altered mental state, the loss of the ability to execute learned movements ([[apraxia]]), or the inability to speak ([[mutism]]).&lt;ref name="Wider 2009"/&gt;

===Motor impairment===
Persons with HDLS can suffer from tremors, decreased body movement, unsteadiness ([[Parkinsonism]], muscles on one side of the body in constant contraction ([[Spastic Hemiplegia|spastic hemiparesis]]), impairment in motor and sensory function in the lower extremities ([[Paraplegia|paraparesis]]), paralysis resulting in partial or total loss of all extremities and torso ([[Tetraplegia|tetraparesis]]), and the lack of voluntary coordination of muscle movements ([[ataxia]]).&lt;ref name="Wider 2009"/&gt;

==Related diseases==
Related disorders in the same disease spectrum as HDLS include Nasu-Hakola disease ([[polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy]]), and a type of [[leukodystrophy]] with pigment-filled macrophages called pigmentary orthochromatic leukodystrophy (POLD).&lt;ref name="Wider 2009"/&gt; In addition to white matter disease, Nasu-Hakola causes bone cysts. It is caused by mutations in the genes involved in the same [[Colony-stimulating factor|colony stimulating factor]] (CSF) [[Signal transduction|signaling pathway cascade]] as identified in HDLS.&lt;ref name="Paloneva 2003"&gt;Paloneva, J., Mandelin, J., Kiialainen, A., Böhling, T., Prudlo, J., Hakola, P., . . . Peltonen, L. (2003). DAP12/TREM2 deficiency results in impaired osteoclast differentiation and osteoporotic features. The Journal of experimental medicine, 198(4), 669-675.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasu-Hakola disease appears to be caused by mutations in the TYRO protein tyrosine kinase-binding protein ([[TYROBP]] - also known as DAP12) or the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 ([[TREM2]]) protein. While different gene mutations occur within the pathway for Nasu-Hakola and HDLS, both are characterized by white matter degeneration with axonal spheroids. Current researchers in the field believe that more in depth analysis and comparison of the two genetic abnormalities in these disorders could lead to a better understanding of the disease mechanisms in these rare disorders. POLD exhibits noninflammatory demyelination of axons with initial symptoms of euphoria, apathy, headache, and [[executive dysfunction]]. While HDLS is autosomal dominant, some families with POLD have features that suggest autosomal recessive inheritance.&lt;ref name ="Knaap 2005"&gt;Knaap, Marjo S., &amp; Valk, Jaap. (2005). Pigmentary Orthochromatic Leukodystrophy
Magnetic Resonance of Myelination and Myelin Disorders (pp. 557-558): Springer Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, POLD has recently been shown to have the same genetic basis as HDLS.
==Causes==
The cause of HDLS in most families is mutation in the [[colony stimulating factor 1 receptor]] (CSF1R), a growth factor for microglia and monocyte/macrophages, suggesting that microglial dysfunction may be primary in HDLS.&lt;ref name="Rademakers 2012"/&gt;

The mutations are concentrated in [[tyrosine]] [[kinase]] domain (TKD) of the protein. Mutations were mainly found in exons 12-22 of the [[intracellular]] TKD, including 10 [[missense mutations]] that have a single [[nucleotide]] deletion and a single codon deletion that consists of a triplet of nucleotides that have been removed causing a whole [[amino acid]] to not be coded. Additionally, three [[splice site mutation]]s were identified that caused an [[Deletion (genetics)|in-frame deletion]] of an [[exon]], an expressed nucleotide sequence, leading to the removal of more than 40 amino acids in the TKD.&lt;ref name="Rademakers 2012" /&gt;

This determination has based upon genetic studies of 14 HDLS families confirming mutations in this gene. The CSF1 receptor protein primarily functions in regulation, survival, proliferation, and differentiation of microglial cells.&lt;ref name="Kinoshita 2012"&gt;Kinoshita, M., Yoshida, K., Oyanagi, K., Hashimoto, T., &amp; Ikeda, S. (2012). Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids caused by R782H mutation in CSF1R: Case report. Journal of the Neurological Sciences, 318(1-2), 115-118. doi: 10.1016/j.jns.2012.03.012&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism of microglial dysfunction due to mutations in CSF1R to the myelin loss and axonal spheroid formation remains unknown. Further research is needed to better understand disease [[pathogenesis]].

==Pathology==
[[File:Leukencephalopathy.PNG|thumb|left|200px|alt="CT showing a leukoencephalopathy "|An axial CT scan of a patient presenting a leukoencephalopathy, the base disorder to the family of disorders that HDLS falls under.]]

In HDLS, there is enlargement of the [[lateral ventricle]]s and marked thinning or weakening of cerebral white matter.&lt;ref name="Baba 2006"&gt;Baba, Y., Ghetti, B., Baker, M. C., Uitti, R. J., Hutton, M. L., Yamaguchi, K., . . . Wszolek, Z. K. (2006). Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids: clinical, pathologic and genetic studies of a new kindred. Acta Neuropathol, 111(4), 300-311. doi: 10.1007/s00401-006-0046-z&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of white matter is caused by [[myelin]] loss. These changes are associated with diffuse [[gliosis]], moderate loss of [[axon]]s and many axonal spheroids.&lt;ref name = "Lin 2010"/&gt;

Activated or ameboid microglia and [[macrophage]]s that contain myelin debris, lipid droplets and brown autofluorescent pigment granules are found in the areas with demyelination and axonal spheroids. In severely degenerated areas there are many large, reactive astrocytes filled with glial [[fibrils]].&lt;ref name = "Lin 2010"/&gt;

In autopsy cases, it has been shown that white matter abnormalities are relatively confined to the [[cerebrum]] while avoiding the [[cerebellum]] and many of the major fiber tracts of the nervous system. The exception is the [[corticospinal tracts]](pyramidal tracts) in the [[brainstem]] and sometimes [[spinal cord]].&lt;ref name="Sundal 2012 Misdiagnosed"/&gt;

The brain pathology of HDLS resembles that of Nasu-Hakola disease (polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy).&lt;ref name="Hancock 2003"&gt;Hancock, N., Poon, M., Taylor, B., &amp; McLean, C. (2003). Hereditary diffuse leucoencephalopathy with spheroids. J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry, 74(9), 1345–1347.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Research as of 2012 includes investigations of microglial function. This work would further clarify whether the disease is primarily a defect in microglia function. For such a study, microglial cells from HDLS kindred can be cultured from autopsy brain and analyzed in comparison to normal microglial cells on the basis of differences in mutation occurrences and growth factor expression.&lt;ref name="Kinoshita 2012"/&gt;

===Clinical and genealogic studies===
To gain a better understanding of the disease, researchers have retrospectively reviewed medical records of [[probands]] and others who were assessed through clinical examinations or questionnaires. Blood samples are collected from the families of the probands for genetic testing. These family members are assessed using their [[Medical history|standard medical history]], on their progression of Parkinson's like symptoms ([[Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale]]), and on their progression of cognitive impairment such as dementia ([[Mini–mental state examination|Folstein Test]]).&lt;ref name="Sundal 2012 Misdiagnosed"/&gt;

===Neuroimaging===
Standard [[MRI]] scans have been performed on 1.5 Tesla scanners with 5&amp;nbsp;mm thickness and 5&amp;nbsp;mm spacing to screen for white matter lesions in identified families. If signal intensities of the MRI scans are higher in white matter regions than in grey matter regions, the patient is considered to be at risk for HDLS, although a number of other disorders can also produce white matter changes and the findings are not diagnostic without genetic testing or [[Pathology|pathologic]] confirmation.&lt;ref name="Sundal 2012 Misdiagnosed"/&gt;

===Pathology===
Tissue sections from brain biopsies or autopsy brains are commonly embedded in [[paraffin wax|paraffin]] from which sections are cut an mounted on glass slides for histologic studies. Special stains for myelin and axonal pathology show the abnormal changes that are characteristic of HDLS are identified in white matter of the [[neocortex]], [[basal ganglia]], [[thalamus]], [[midbrain]], [[pons]] and spinal cord.&lt;ref name="Sundal 2012 Misdiagnosed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Van Gerpen 2008"&gt;Van Gerpen, J. A., Wider, C., Broderick, D. F., Dickson, D. W., Brown, L. A., &amp; Wszolek, Z. K. (2008). Insights into the dynamics of hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids. Neurology, 71(12), 925-929. doi: 10.1212/01.wnl.0000325916.30701.21&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to routine [[histologic]] methods ([[H&amp;E stain]]ing), samples are evaluated with [[immunohistochemistry]] for [[ubiquitin]], amyloid precursor protein, and neurofilament to characterize axonal changes and myelin basic protein for myelin pathology. Immunohistochemical stains for microglia (CD68 or HLA-DR) and astrocytes (GFAP) are also helpful techniques to characterize white matter pathology.&lt;ref name="Baba 2006"/&gt; With a similar pathology to POLD, HDLS is commonly grouped as adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP) so as to give these individually under-recognized conditions heightened attention.&lt;ref name="Wider 2009" /&gt;
===Classification===
HDLS falls under the category of brain white matter diseases called leukoencephalopathies that are characterized by some degree of white matter dysfunction. HDLS has white matter lesions with abnormalities in [[Myelin|myelin sheath]] around axons, where the causative influences are being continually explored based upon recent genetic findings. Studies by Sundal and colleagues from Sweden showed that a risk allele in Caucasians may be causative because cases identified have thus far been among large Caucasian families.&lt;ref name="Sundal 2012 Misdiagnosed"/&gt;

==Management==
{{Empty section|date=October 2017}}

==Epidemiology==
An average clinical profile from published studies shows that the median onset age for HDLS patients is 44.3&amp;nbsp;years with a mean disease duration of 5.8&amp;nbsp;years and mean age of death at 53.2&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name="Sundal 2012 Misdiagnosed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sundal 2012 MRI Characteristics"&gt;Sundal, C., Van Gerpen, J. A., Nicholson, A. M., Wider, C., Shuster, E. A., Aasly, J., . . . Wszolek, Z. K. (2012). MRI characteristics and scoring in HDLS due to CSF1R gene mutations. Neurology, 79(6), 566-574. doi: 10.1212/WNL.0b013e318263575a&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, there have been around 15 cases identified with at least 11 sporadic cases of HDLS.&lt;ref name="Sundal 2012 Misdiagnosed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sundal 2012 MRI Characteristics"/&gt; HDLS cases have been located in Germany, Norway, Sweden, and the United States, showing an international distribution focusing between Northern Europe and the United States.&lt;ref name="Sundal 2012 Misdiagnosed"/&gt;

Through the study of numerous kindred, it was found that the disease did not occur among just males or females, but rather was evenly distributed indicative of an [[Autosome|autosomal]] rather than a [[Sex linkage|sex-linked genetic disorder]]. It was also observed that the HDLS cases did not skip generations as it would occur with a recessive inheritance, and as such has been labeled autosomal dominant.&lt;ref name="Sundal 2012 Misdiagnosed"/&gt;

==History==
This disease was first described in 1984 by Axelsson ''et al.'' in a large [[Sweden|Swedish]] pedigree.&lt;ref name="Axelsson 1984"&gt;Axelsson, R., Roytta, M., Sourander, P., Akesson, H. O., &amp; Andersen, O. (1984). Hereditary diffuse leucoencephalopathy with spheroids. ''[[Acta Psychiatr Scand Suppl]]'', 314, 1-65.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a disorder better known to neuropathologists than clinicians. A neuropathologist with an interest in HDLS, Dr. Dennis W. Dickson, has identified a number of cases from [[neuropathology]] study of brains submitted for investigation of familial adult-onset dementia and movement disorders in New York and later in Florida. Recognition of the importance of this disorder as a cause of adult onset dementia and movement disorders was further heightened in 1997 at the [[Mayo Clinic]] when Dr. Zbigniew K. Wszolek identified a family with HDLS that was initially thought to be due to another disease process (FTDP-17), but only an [[autopsy]] of one and then other family members revealed it to be HDLS. Wszolek established an international [[consortium]] in 2005 to identify other families and to collect DNA or brain samples from family members for neuropathologic confirmation and genetic research at the Mayo Clinic in Florida.&lt;ref name="Sundal 2012 Misdiagnosed"/&gt;

'''Home and Hospital Education''' (HHE) refers to all the activities related to the wide word of the education for children or youngsters with medical needs, being it in hospital (with hospital sections or hospital schools) or at home (as home tuition).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lehoproject.eu/en/glossary|website=Learning at Home and in the Hospital|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term HHE has been firstly introduced in the writing of the proposal for the EU funded project [[LeHo:_Learning_at_Home_and_in_the_Hospital|LeHo (Learning at Home and in the Hospital)]] is an international 3-year project funded by the [[European Union]], and managed by the [[Fondazione Politecnico di Milano]] aiming to research, develop and disseminate effective pedagogical practices and appropriate use of [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] within the Hospital School Sector.

Now the HHE acronym is commonly used in research and on a practical level in Europe and over.

'''Human genetic resistance to malaria''' refers to inherited changes in the [[DNA]] of humans which increase resistance to [[malaria]] and result in increased survival of individuals with those genetic changes. The existence of these [[genotype]]s is likely due to [[evolutionary pressure]] exerted by parasites of the genus ''[[Plasmodium]]'' which cause malaria. Since malaria infects [[red blood cell]]s, these genetic changes are most commonly alterations to molecules essential for red blood cell function (and therefore parasite survival), such as [[hemoglobin]] or other cellular proteins or enzymes of red blood cells. These alterations generally protect red blood cells from invasion by ''Plasmodium'' parasites or replication of parasites within the red blood cell.

These inherited changes to hemoglobin or other characteristic proteins, which are critical and rather invariant features of mammalian biochemistry, usually cause some kind of inherited disease. Therefore, they are commonly referred to by the names of the [[blood disorders]] associated with them, including [[sickle-cell disease]], [[thalassemia]], [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]], and others. These blood disorders cause increased [[morbidity]] and mortality in areas of the world where malaria is less prevalent.

== Development of genetic resistance to malaria ==

Microscopic [[parasites]], like viruses, protozoans that cause malaria, and others, cannot replicate on their own and rely on a host to continue their life cycles. They replicate by invading the hosts' cells and usurping the cellular machinery to replicate themselves. Eventually, unchecked replication causes the cells to burst, killing the cells and releasing the infectious organisms into the bloodstream where they can infect other cells. As cells die and toxic products of invasive organism replication accumulate, disease symptoms appear. Because this process involves specific proteins produced by the infectious organism as well as the host cell, even a very small change in a critical protein may render infection difficult or impossible. Such changes might arise by a process of mutation in the gene that codes for the protein. If the change is in the gamete, that is, the sperm or egg that join to form a zygote that grows into a human being, the protective mutation will be inherited. Since lethal diseases kill many persons who lack protective mutations, in time, many persons in regions where lethal diseases are endemic come to inherit protective mutations.

When the ''P. falciparum'' parasite infects a host cell, it alters the characteristics of the red blood cell membrane, making it "stickier" to other cells. Clusters of parasitized red blood cells can exceed the size of the capillary circulation, adhere to the [[endothelium]], and block circulation. When these blockages form in the blood vessels surrounding the brain, they cause [[cerebral hypoxia]], resulting in [[neurological]] symptoms known as '''cerebral malaria'''. This condition is characterized by confusion, disorientation, and often terminal [[coma]]. It accounts for 80% of malaria deaths. Therefore, mutations that protect against malaria infection and lethality pose a significant advantage.

Malaria has placed the strongest known [[Evolutionary pressure|selective pressure]] on the [[human genome]] since the origin of agriculture within the past 10,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kwiatkowski DP |title=How Malaria Has Affected the Human Genome and What Human Genetics Can Teach Us about Malaria |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=77 |issue=2 |pages=171–192 |year=2005 |pmid=16001361 |pmc=1224522 |doi=10.1086/432519 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hedrick PW |title=Population genetics of malaria resistance in humans|journal=Heredity |pages=1–22 |year=2011 |pmid=21427751 |doi=10.1038/hdy.2011.16 |volume=107 |issue=4 |pmc=3182497}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' was probably not able to gain a foothold among [[Africa]]n populations until larger [[Sedentism|sedentary]] communities emerged in association with the evolution of domestic agriculture in Africa (the [[First agricultural revolution|agricultural revolution]]). Several inherited variants in [[red blood cell]]s have become common in parts of the world where malaria is frequent as a result of selection exerted by this [[Parasitism|parasite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Anstee DJ |title= The relationship between blood groups and disease|journal= Blood. |volume= 115|issue=23 |pages= 4635–4643 |year=2010 |pmid= 20308598 |url = http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/content/115/23/4635.long |doi=10.1182/blood-2010-01-261859}}&lt;/ref&gt; This selection was historically important as the first documented example of [[disease]] as an agent of [[natural selection]] in [[human]]s. It was also the first example of genetically controlled [[Innate immune system|innate immunity]] that operates early in the course of infections, preceding adaptive immunity which exerts effects after several days. In malaria, as in other diseases, innate immunity leads into, and stimulates, [[adaptive immunity]].

Mutations may have detrimental as well as beneficial effects, and any single mutation may have both. Infectiousness of malaria depends on specific proteins present in the cell walls and elsewhere in red blood cells. Protective mutations alter these proteins in ways that make them inaccessible to malaria organisms. However, these changes also alter the functioning and form of red blood cells that may have visible effects, either overtly, or by microscopic examination of red blood cells. These changes may impair the function of red blood cells in various ways that have a detrimental effect on the health or longevity of the individual. However, if the net effect of protection against malaria outweighs the other detrimental effects, the protective mutation will tend to be retained and propagated from generation to generation.

These alterations which protect against malarial infections but impair red blood cells are generally considered blood disorders, since they tend to have overt and detrimental effects. Their protective function has only in recent times, been discovered and acknowledged. Some of these disorders are known by fanciful and cryptic names like sickle-cell anemia, thalassaemia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, ovalocytosis, elliptocytosis and loss of the Gerbich antigen and the Duffy antigen. These names refer to various proteins, enzymes, and the shape or function of red blood cells.

== Innate resistance ==

The potent effect of genetically controlled innate resistance is reflected in the probability of survival of young children in areas where malaria is endemic. It is necessary to study innate immunity in the susceptible age group (younger than four years), because in older children and adults, the effects of innate immunity are overshadowed by those of adaptive immunity. It is also necessary to study populations in which random use of [[antimalarial drug]]s does not occur. Some early contributions on innate resistance to infections of vertebrates, including humans, are summarized in Table 1.

It is remarkable that two of the pioneering studies were on malaria.

However, the early contributions on malaria remain as classical examples of innate resistance, which have stood the test of time.

=== Mechanisms of protection ===
The mechanisms by which erythrocytes containing abnormal hemoglobins, or are G6PD deficient, are partially protected against ''P. falciparum'' infections are not fully understood, although there has been no shortage of suggestions. During the peripheral blood stage of replication malaria parasites have a high rate of [[oxygen]] consumption&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev.micro.091208.073424 |vauthors=Vaidya AB, Mather MW | title = Mitochondrial evolution and functions in malaria parasites| journal = Annu Rev Microbiol| volume = 63| pages = 249–267| year = 2009|pmid = 19575561}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ingest large amounts of hemoglobin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi =10.1073/pnas.0711067105 | author =Elliott DA, McIntosh MT, Hosgood HD 3rd, Chen S, Zhang G, Baevova P, Joiner KA| title = Four distinct pathways of hemoglobin uptake in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum| journal = Proc.

In red cells containing abnormal hemoglobins, or which are G6PD deficient, [[Radical (chemistry)|oxygen radicals]] are produced, and malaria parasites induce additional oxidative stress.&lt;ref name=Kuross&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kuross SA, Rank BH, Hebbel RP | title = Excess heme in sickle erythrocyte inside-out membranes: possible role in thiol oxidation| journal = Blood| volume = 71 | issue =4| pages = 876–882| year = 1988|pmid =3355895 |url= http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/reprint/71/4/876.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can result in changes in red cell membranes, including translocation of [[phosphatidylserine]] to their surface{{technical statement|date=March 2014}}, followed by macrophage recognition and ingestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi =10.1159/000233238 |vauthors=Föller M, Bobbala D, Koka S, Huber SM, Gulbins E, Lang F | title = Suicide for survival--death of infected erythrocytes as a host mechanism to survive malaria| journal = Cell Physiol Biochem| volume = 24 | issue =3–4| pages = 133–140| year = 2009|pmid =19710527 |url= http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowPDF&amp;ArtikelNr=233238&amp;Ausgabe=250411&amp;ProduktNr=224332&amp;filename=233238.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors suggest that this mechanism is likely to occur earlier in abnormal than in normal red cells, thereby restricting multiplication in the former. In addition, binding of parasitized sickle cells to endothelial cells is significantly decreased because of an altered display of ''P. falciparum'' erythrocyte membrane protein-1 (PfMP-1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi =10.1073/pnas.0711401105 |vauthors=Cholera R, Brittain NJ, Gillrie MR, Lopera-Mesa TM, Diakité SA, Arie T, Krause MA, Guindo A, Tubman A, Fujioka H, Diallo DA, Doumbo OK, Ho M, Wellems TE, Fairhurst RM | title = Impaired cytoadherence of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes containing sickle hemoglobin| journal = Proc.

During the late stages of parasite replication red cells are adherent to venous endothelium, and inhibiting this attachment could suppress replication.

Sickle hemoglobin induces the expression of heme oxygenase-1 in [[Haematopoiesis|hematopoietic]] cells. [[Carbon monoxide]], a byproduct of heme catabolism by [[heme oxygenase]]-1(HO-1), prevents an accumulation of circulating free heme after ''[[Plasmodium]]'' infection, suppressing the pathogenesis of experimental cerebral malaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Ferreira A, Marguti I, Bechmann I, Jeney V, Chora A, Palha NR, Rebelo S, Henri A, Beuzard Y, Soares MP| title = Sickle hemoglobin confers tolerance to Plasmodium infection| journal = Cell| volume = 145| issue = 3| pages = 398–409| year = 2011| url = http://saturn.med.nyu.edu/research/mp/littmanlab/Immunology_Journal_Club/Papers_files/Ferreira.pdf| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111003213827/http://saturn.med.nyu.edu/research/mp/littmanlab/Immunology_Journal_Club/Papers_files/Ferreira.pdf| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 2011-10-03| pmid = 21529713| doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2011.03.049}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other mechanisms, such as enhanced tolerance to disease mediated by HO-1 and reduced parasitic growth due to translocation of host micro-RNA into the parasite, have been described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gong L, Parikh S, Rosenthal PJ, Greenhouse B | title = Biochemical and immunological mechanisms by which sickle cell trait protects against malaria | journal = Malaria Journal | volume = 12| pages = 317| year = 2013 |url = http://www.malariajournal.com/content/pdf/1475-2875-12-317.pdf |pmid = 24025776 | doi=10.1186/1475-2875-12-317 | issue=1 | pmc=3847285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of innate resistance ==
The first line of defense against malaria is mainly exerted by abnormal hemoglobins and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. The three major types of inherited genetic resistance – [[Sickle-cell disease|sickle cell disease]], [[thalassemia]]s, and [[Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency|G6PD deficiency]] – were present in the [[Mediterranean]] world by the time of the [[Roman Empire]].

==== Distribution of abnormal hemoglobins ====
[[File:Red Blood Cell abnormalities.png|thumb|[[Old World]] distribution of hemoglobin-inherited disorders]]
Malaria does not occur in the cooler, drier climates of the highlands in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world.
Tens of thousands of individuals have been studied, and high frequencies of abnormal hemoglobins have not been found in any population that was malaria free. The frequencies of abnormal hemoglobins in different populations vary greatly, but some are undoubtedly polymorphic, having frequencies higher than expected by recurrent mutation. There is no longer doubt that malarial selection played a major role in the distribution of all these polymorphisms. All of these are in malarious areas,

*Sickle cell – The gene for HbS associated with sickle-cell is today distributed widely throughout sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and parts of the Indian subcontinent, where carrier frequencies range from 5–40% or more of the population. Frequencies of sickle-cell heterozygotes were 20–40% in malarious areas of [[Kenya]], Uganda, and [[Tanzania]]. Later studies by many investigators filled in the picture.&lt;ref name=Allison&gt;{{cite journal | author = Allison AC. | title = Genetic control of resistance to human malaria | journal = Current Opinion in Immunology| volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 499–505| year = 2009 | pmid = 19442502|doi=10.1016/j.coi.2009.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Piel FB, Patil AP, Howes RE, Nyangiri OA, Gething PW, Williams TN, Weatherall DJ, Hay SI| title = Global distribution of the sickle cell gene and geographical confirmation of the malaria hypothesis| journal = Nat Commun | volume = 1 | page = 104| year = 2010 | url = http://www.nature.com/ncomms/journal/v1/n8/pdf/ncomms1104.pdf | pmid = 21045822 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms1104 | issue=8|bibcode = 2010NatCo...1E.104P | pmc=3060623}}&lt;/ref&gt; High frequencies of the HbS gene are confined to a broad belt across [[Central Africa]], but excluding most of [[Ethiopia]] and the [[Eastern Highlands|East African highlands]]; this corresponds closely to areas of malaria transmission. Sickle-cell heterozygote frequencies up to 20% also occur in pockets of [[India]] and [[Greece]] that were formerly highly malarious.

The thalassemias have a high incidence in a broad band extending from the Mediterranean basin and parts of Africa, throughout the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, Melanesia, and into the Pacific Islands.

*concurrent polymorphisms – double heterozygotes for HbS and β-thalassemia, and for HbS and HbC, suffer from variant forms of sickle-cell disease, milder than SS but likely to reduce fitness before modern treatment was available.

There is a negative correlation between frequencies of HbS and β-thalassemia in different parts of Greece and of HbS and HbC in West Africa.&lt;ref name=AA&gt;{{cite journal | author = Allison AC| title = Aspects of polymorphism in man| journal = Cold Spring Harb Symp Quant Biol | volume = 20| pages = 239–251 | year = 1955 | pmid = 13433567}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where there is no adverse interaction of mutations, as in the case of abnormal hemoglobins and G6PD deficiency, a positive correlation of these variant alleles in populations would be expected and is found.&lt;ref name=AA/&gt;

Sickle-cell disease was the genetic disorder to be linked to a mutation of a specific protein. Pauling introduced his fundamentally important concept of sickle cell anemia as a genetically transmitted molecular disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.110.2865.543 |vauthors=Pauling L, Itano H, Singer SJ, Wells I | title = Sickle cell anemia, a molecular disease | journal = Science | volume = 110| pages =543–548 | year = 1949|pmid = 15395398 | url = http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/MM/B/B/R/L/_/mmbbrl.pdf | issue=2865|bibcode = 1949Sci...110..543P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SICKLEMARLIA.svg|thumb|This vein (4) shows the interaction between the malaria sporozoites (6) with sickle cells (3) and regular cells (1). While malaria is still affecting the regular cells (2), the ratio of sickle to regular cells is 50/50 due to sickle cell anemia being a heterozygous trait, so the malaria can’t affect enough cells with schizonts (5) to harm the body.]]

The molecular basis of sickle cell anemia was finally elucidated in 1959, when Ingram perfected the techniques of tryptic peptide fingerprinting. In the mid-1950s, one of the newest and most reliable ways of separating peptides and amino acids was by means of the enzyme trypsin, which split polypeptide chains by specifically degrading the chemical bonds formed by the carboxyl groups of two amino acids, lysine and arginine. Small differences in hemoglobin A and S will result in small changes in one or more of these peptides .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ingram VM | title = Abnormal human haemoglobins. III.

By this combination he created a two-dimensional method that enabled him to comparatively "fingerprint" the hemoglobin S and A fragments he obtained from the tryspin digest. The fingerprints revealed approximately 30 peptide spots, there was one peptide spot clearly visible in the digest of haemoglobin S which was not obvious in the haemoglobin A fingerprint. The HbS gene defect is a mutation of a single nucleotide (A to T) of the β-globin gene replacing the amino acid glutamic acid with the less polar amino acid valine at the sixth position of the β chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author =Ingram VM | title = Sickle-Cell Anemia Hemoglobin: The Molecular Biology of the First "Molecular Disease"—The Crucial Importance of Serendipity | journal =Genetics | volume = 167| issue = 1 | pages =1–7 | year = 2004| url =https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1470873/pdf/15166132.pdf | doi=10.1534/genetics.167.1.1 | pmc=1470873 | pmid=15166132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HbS has a lower negative charge at physiological pH than does normal adult hemoglobin. The consequences of the simple replacement of a charged amino acid with a hydrophobic, neutral amino acid are far ranging, Recent studies in West Africa suggest that the greatest impact of Hb S seems to be to protect against either death or severe disease—that is, profound anemia or cerebral malaria—while having less effect on infection per se. Children who are heterozygous for the sickle cell gene have only one-tenth the risk of death from falciparum as do those who are homozygous for the normal hemoglobin gene. Binding of parasitized sickle erythrocytes to endothelial cells and blood monocytes is significantly reduced due to an altered display of [[Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1|''Plasmodium falciparum'' erythrocyte membrane protein 1]] (PfEMP-1), the parasite’s major cytoadherence ligand and virulence factor on the erythrocyte surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cholera R, Brittain NJ, Gillrie MR, Lopera-Mesa TM, Diakité SA, Arie T, Krause MA, Guindo A, Tubman A, Fujioka H, Diallo DA, Doumbo OK, Ho M, Wellems TE, Fairhurst RM | title = Impaired cytoadherence of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes containing sickle hemoglobin| journal =Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 105| issue = 3| pages = 991–996| year = 2008| doi=10.1073/pnas.0711401105 | pmid=18192399 | pmc=2242681|bibcode = 2008PNAS..105..991C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protection also derives from the instability of sickle hemoglobin, which clusters the predominant integral red cell membrane protein (called band 3) and triggers accelerated removal by phagocytic cells. Natural antibodies recognize these clusters on senescent erythrocytes. Protection by HbAS involves the enhancement of not only innate but also of acquired immunity to the parasite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Williams T N, Mwangi T W, Roberts D J, Alexander N D, Weatherall D J, Wambua S, Kortok M, Snow R W, Marsh K  | title = An Immune Basis for Malaria Protection by the Sickle Cell Trait| journal =PLoS Medicine | volume = 2| issue = 5| pages = e128 | year = 2005| url =https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1140945/pdf/pmed.0020128.pdf | doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020128 | pmc=1140945 | pmid=15916466}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prematurely denatured sickle hemoglobin results in an upregulation of natural antibodies which control erythrocyte adhesion in both malaria and sickle cell disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hebbel RP | title = Sickle hemoglobin instability: a mechanism for malarial protection | journal =Redox Rep | volume = 8| pages = 238–240| year = 2003|pmid =14962356|doi = 10.1179/135100003225002826 | issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Targeting the stimuli that lead to endothelial activation will constitute a promising therapeutic strategy to inhibit sickle red cell adhesion and vaso-occlusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kaul DK | title =Sickle red cell adhesion: Many issues and some answers| journal = Transfus Clin Biol | volume = 15| pages = 51–55 | year = 2008| pmid =18495516 | doi=10.1016/j.tracli.2008.03.012 | issue=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Thalassemias ====
{{Main article|Thalassemia|Alpha-thalassemia}}
It has long been known that a kind of anemia, termed [[thalassemia]], has a high frequency in some Mediterranean populations, including Greeks and southern Italians. The name is derived from the Greek words for sea (''thalassa''), meaning the [[Mediterranean sea]], and blood (''haima''). Vernon Ingram deserves the credit for explaining the genetic basis of different forms of thalassemia as an imbalance in the synthesis of the two polypeptide chains of hemoglobin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/1841903a0 |vauthors=Ingram VM, Stretton AO | title = Genetic basis of the thalassaemia diseases| journal = Nature | volume = 184| pages = 1903–1909| year = 1959 |pmid = 13852871|bibcode = 1959Natur.184.1903I | issue=4703}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the common Mediterranean variant, mutations decrease production of the β-chain (β-thalassemia). In α-thalassemia, which is relatively frequent in Africa and several other countries, production of the α-chain of hemoglobin is impaired, and there is relative over-production of the β-chain. Individuals homozygous for β-thalassemia have severe anemia and are unlikely to survive and reproduce, so selection against the gene is strong. Those homozygous for α-thalassemia also suffer from anemia and there is some degree of selection against the gene.

The lower [[Himalayan foothills]] and [[Inner Terai Valleys of Nepal|Inner Terai or Doon Valleys]] of [[Nepal]] and [[India]] are highly malarial due to a warm climate and marshes sustained during the dry season by groundwater percolating down from the higher hills. Malarial forests were intentionally maintained by the rulers of Nepal as a defensive measure. Humans attempting to live in this zone suffered much higher mortality than at higher elevations or below on the drier [[Gangetic Plain]]. However, the [[Tharu people]] had lived in this zone long enough to evolve resistance via multiple genes. Medical studies among the Tharu and non-Tharu population of the [[Terai]] yielded the evidence that the prevalence of cases of residual malaria is nearly seven times lower among Tharus. The basis for resistance has been established to be homozygosity of α-Thalassemia gene within the local population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Modiano G, Morpurgo G, Terrenato L, Novelletto A, Di Rienzo A, Colombo B, Purpura M, Mariani M, Santachiara-Benerecetti S, Brega A, Dixit KA, Shrestha SL, Lania A, Wanachiwanawin W, Luzzatto L |title=Protection Against Malaria Morbidity: Near Fixation of the α-Thalassemia gene in a Nepalese Population|journal=Am.

Hemoglobin C (HbC) is an abnormal hemoglobin with substitution of a lysine residue for glutamic acid residue of the β-globin chain, at exactly the same ß-6 position as the HbS mutation. The "C" designation for HbC is from the name of the city where it was discovered—Christchurch, New Zealand. People who have this disease, particularly children, may have episodes of abdominal and joint pain, an enlarged spleen, and mild jaundice, but they do not have severe crises, as occur in sickle cell disease. Haemoglobin C is common in malarious areas of West Africa, especially in Burkina Faso. In a large case–control study performed in Burkina Faso on 4,348 Mossi subjects, that HbC was associated with a 29% reduction in risk of clinical malaria in HbAC heterozygotes and of 93% in HbCC homozygotes. HbC represents a ‘slow but gratis’ genetic adaptation to malaria through a transient polymorphism, compared to the polycentric ‘quick but costly’ adaptation through balanced polymorphism of HbS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/35104556 |vauthors=Modiano D, Luoni G, Sirima BS, Simporé J, Verra F, Konaté A, Rastrelli E, Olivieri A, Calissano C, Paganotti GM, D'Urbano L, Sanou I, Sawadogo A, Modiano G, Coluzzi M | title = Haemoglobin C protects against clinical Plasmodium falciparum malaria| journal = Nature| volume = 414 | issue = 6861| pages = 305–308| year = 2001|pmid = 11713529| url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v414/n6861/full/414305a0.html|bibcode = 2001Natur.414..305M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Modiano D, Bancone G, Ciminelli BM, Pompei F, Blot I, Simporé J, Modiano G | title = Haemoglobin S and haemoglobin C: ‘quick but costly’ versus ‘slow but gratis’ genetic adaptations to Plasmodium falciparum malaria |  journal = Hum Mol Genet | volume = 17 | pages = 789–799| year = 2008|pmid = 18048408 | doi=10.1093/hmg/ddm350 | issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hemoglobin E is due to a single point mutation in the gene for the beta chain with a glutamate-to-lysine substitution at position 26. It is one of the most prevalent hemoglobinopathies with 30 million people affected. Hemoglobin E is very common in parts of Southeast Asia. HbE erythrocytes have an unidentified membrane abnormality that renders the majority of the RBC population relatively resistant to invasion by ''P falciparum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chotivanich K, Udomsangpetch R, Pattanapanyasat K, Chierakul W, Simpson J, Looareesuwan S, White N | title = Hemoglobin E: a balanced polymorphism protective against high parasitemias and thus severe P. falciparum malaria| journal = Blood| volume = 100 |pmid = 12149194 | issue=4 | date=August 2002 | pages=1172–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other erythrocyte mutations===
Other genetic mutations besides hemoglobin abnormalities that confer resistance to ''Plasmodia'' infection involve alterations of the cellular surface [[antigen]]ic proteins, [[cell membrane]] structural proteins, or enzymes involved in [[glycolysis]].

==== Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency ====
{{Main article|Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency }}
{{see also|Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase}}
[[File:Jaundice.jpg|thumb|right | Hemolytic anemia due to G6PD deficiency following Fava beans consumption]]
[[Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]] (G6PD) is an important [[enzyme]] in red cells, metabolizing [[glucose]] through the [[pentose phosphate pathway]], an anabolic alternative to catabolic oxidation (glycolysis), while maintaining a reducing environment. G6PD is present in all human cells but is particularly important to red blood cells. Since mature red blood cells lack [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] and cytoplasmic [[RNA]], they cannot synthesize new enzyme molecules to replace genetically abnormal or ageing ones. All proteins, including enzymes, have to last for the entire lifetime of the red blood cell, which is normally 120 days.

In 1956 Alving and colleagues showed that in some [[African American]]s the antimalarial drug [[primaquine]] induces hemolytic anemia, and that those individuals have an inherited deficiency of G6PD in erythrocytes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.124.3220.484-a |vauthors=Alving AS, Carson PE, Flanagan CL, Ickes CE | title = Enzymatic deficiency in primaquine-sensitive erythrocytes| journal = Science| volume = 124| issue = 3220| pages = 484–485| year = 1956| pmid = 13360274|bibcode = 1956Sci...124..484C }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency|G6PD deficiency]] is sex-linked, and common in Mediterranean, African and other populations. In Mediterranean countries such individuals can develop a hemolytic diathesis ([[favism]]) after consuming [[Vicia faba|fava beans]]. G6PD deficient persons are also sensitive to several drugs in addition to primaquine.

G6PD deficiency is the second most common enzyme deficiency in humans (after [[ALDH2]] deficiency), estimated to affect some 400 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Cappellini MD, Fiorelli G|date=January 2008|title=Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency|url=|journal=Lancet|volume=371|issue=9606|pages=64–74|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60073-2|pmid=18177777}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many mutations at this locus, two of which attain frequencies of 20% or greater in African and Mediterranean populations; these are termed the A- and Med mutations.&lt;ref name=Tishkoff&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tishkoff SA, Verelli BJ | title = G6PD deficiency and malarial resistance in humans: insights from evolutionary genetic analysis.

This question has been studied in isolated populations where antimalarial drugs were not used in Tanzania, East Africa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1136/bmj.1.5236.1346 |vauthors=Allison AC, Clyde DF | title = Malaria in African Children with Deficient Erythrocyte Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase| journal = Br Med J| volume = 1| issue = 5236| pages = 1346–1349| year = 1961| pmid = 13682585 | pmc = 1954496}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[The Gambia|Republic of the Gambia]], West Africa, following children during the period when they are most susceptible to ''falciparum'' malaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/376246a0 |vauthors=Ruwende C, Khoo SC, Snow RW, Yates SN, Kwiatkowski D, Gupta S, Warn P, Allsopp CE, Gilbert SC, Peschu N, Newbold CI, Greenwood BM, Marsh K, Hill AV | title = Natural selection of hemi- and heterozygotes for G6PD deficiency in Africa by resistance to severe malaria| journal = Nature| volume = 376| issue = 6537| pages = 246–249| year = 1995| pmid = 7617034 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v376/n6537/abs/376246a0.html|bibcode = 1995Natur.376..246R }}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases parasite counts were significantly lower in G6PD-deficient persons than in those with normal red cell enzymes. The association has also been studied in individuals, which is possible because the enzyme deficiency is sex-linked and female heterozygotes are mosaics due to [[lyonization]], where random inactivation of an [[X-chromosome]] in certain cells creates a population of G6PD deficient red blood cells coexisting with normal red blood cells. Malaria parasites were significantly more often observed in normal red cells than in enzyme-deficient cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Luzzatto L| title = Genetics of red cells and susceptibility to malaria| journal = Blood| volume = 54| issue = 5| pages = 961–976| year = 1979| pmid = 387115|url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/reprint/54/5/961.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; An evolutionary genetic analysis of malarial selection of G6PD deficiency genes has been published by Tishkoff and Verelli.&lt;ref name=Tishkoff/&gt; The enzyme deficiency is common in many countries that are, or were formerly, malarious, but not elsewhere.

====PK deficiency====
{{main article|PK deficiency}}
{{see also|Pyruvate kinase}}
Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency, also called erythrocyte pyruvate kinase deficiency, is an inherited metabolic disorder of the enzyme pyruvate kinase. In this condition, a lack of pyruvate kinase slows down the process of glycolysis. This effect is especially devastating in cells that lack mitochondria, because these cells must use anaerobic glycolysis as their sole source of energy because the TCA cycle is not available. One example is red blood cells, which in a state of pyruvate kinase deficiency rapidly become deficient in ATP and can undergo hemolysis. Therefore, pyruvate kinase deficiency can cause hemolytic anemia.

There is a significant correlation between severity of [[PK deficiency]] and extent of protection against malaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ayi K, Min-Oo G, Serghides L, Crockett M, Kirby-Allen M, Quirt I, Gros P, Kain KC | title = Pyruvate kinase deficiency and malaria| journal = N Engl J Med| volume = 358| issue = 17| pages = 1805–1810| year = 2008| pmid = 18420493 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa072464|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa072464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Elliptocytosis====
{{main article|Elliptocytosis}}
Elliptocytosis a blood disorder in which an abnormally large number of the patient's erythrocytes are elliptical. There is much genetic variability amongst those affected. There are three major forms of hereditary elliptocytosis: common hereditary elliptocytosis, spherocytic elliptocytosis and [[southeast Asian ovalocytosis]].

==== Southeast Asian ovalocytosis ====

[[Ovalocytosis]] is a subtype of elliptocytosis, and is an inherited condition in which erythrocytes have an oval instead of a round shape. In most populations ovalocytosis is rare, but South-East Asian ovalocytosis (SAO) occurs in as many as 15% of the indigenous people of [[Malaysia]] and of [[Papua New Guinea]]. Several abnormalities of SAO erythrocytes have been reported, including increased red cell rigidity and reduced expression of some red cell antigens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.88.24.11022 |vauthors=Jarolim P, Palek J, Amato D, Hassan K, Sapak P, Nurse GT, Rubin HL, Zhai S, Sahr KE, Liu SC | title = Deletion in erythrocyte band 3 gene in malaria-resistant Southeast Asian ovalocytosis| journal = Proc.

SAO is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding the erythrocyte [[band 3]] protein. There is a deletion of codons 400–408 in the gene, leading to a deletion of 9 amino-acids at the boundary between the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of band 3 protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199011293232205 |vauthors=Liu SC, Zhai S, Palek J, Golan DE, Amato D, Hassan K, Nurse GT, Babona D, Coetzer T, Jarolim P, Zaik M, Borwein S | title = Molecular defect of the band 3 protein in southeast Asian ovalocytosis| journal = N Engl J Med| volume =323| issue = 22| pages =1530–1538 | year = 1990| pmid = 2146504|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/323/22/1530}}&lt;/ref&gt; Band 3 serves as the principal binding site for the membrane skeleton, a submembrane protein network composed of [[ankyrin]], [[spectrin]], [[actin]], and [[band 4.1]]. Ovalocyte band 3 binds more tightly than normal band 3 to ankyrin, which connects the membrane skeleton to the band 3 anion transporter. These qualitative defects create a red blood cell membrane that is less tolerant of shear stress and more susceptible to permanent deformation.

The authors suggest that among Malagasy populations there are enough Duffy-positive people to maintain mosquito transmission and liver infection. More recently, Duffy negative individuals infected with two different strains of ''P. vivax'' were found in [[Angola]] and [[Equatorial Guinea]]; further, ''P. vivax'' infections were found both in humans and mosquitoes, which means that active transmission is occurring.

The potency of ''P. vivax'' as an agent of natural selection is unknown, and may vary from location to location. DARC negativity remains a good example of innate resistance to an infection, but it produces a relative and not an absolute resistance to ''P. vivax'' transmission.

==== Gerbich antigen receptor negativity ====
{{main article|Gerbich antigen system}}
The [[Gerbich antigen system]] is an integral membrane protein of the erythrocyte and plays a functionally important role in maintaining erythrocyte shape. It also acts as the receptor for the ''P. falciparum'' erythrocyte binding protein. There are four [[alleles]] of the gene which encodes the antigen, Ge-1 to Ge-4. Three types of Ge antigen negativity are known: Ge-1,-2,-3, Ge-2,-3 and Ge-2,+3. persons with the relatively rare phenotype Ge-1,-2,-3, are less susceptible (~60% of the control rate) to invasion by ''P. falciparum''. Such individuals have a subtype of a condition called [[hereditary elliptocytosis]], characterized by oval or elliptical shape erythrocytes.

Rare mutations of [[GYPA|glycophorin A]] and [[GYPB|B]] proteins are also known to mediate resistance to ''P. falciparum''.

===Human leucocyte antigen polymorphisms===
{{main article|Human leukocyte antigen}}
Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphisms common in West Africans but rare in other racial groups, are associated with protection from severe malaria. This group of genes encodes cell-surface antigen-presenting proteins and has many other functions. In West Africa, they account for as great a reduction in disease incidence as the sickle-cell hemoglobin variant. The studies suggest that the unusual polymorphism of [[major histocompatibility complex]] genes has evolved primarily through natural selection by infectious pathogens.

Polymorphisms at the HLA loci, which encode proteins that participate in antigen presentation, influence the course of malaria. In West Africa an HLA class I antigen (HLA Bw53) and an HLA class II haplotype (DRB1*13OZ-DQB1*0501) are independently associated with protection against severe malaria.&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/352595a0 |vauthors=Hill AV, Allsopp CE, Kwiatkowski D, Anstey NM, Twumasi P, Rowe PA, Bennett S, Brewster D, McMichael AJ, Greenwood BM | title = Common west African HLA antigens are associated with protection from severe malaria| journal = Nature| volume = 352 | issue = 6336| pages = 595–600| year = 1991|pmid = 1865923|bibcode = 1991Natur.352..595H }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, HLA correlations vary, depending on the genetic constitution of the polymorphic malaria parasite, which differs in different geographic locations.&lt;ref name=Frodsham&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Frodsham AJ, Hill AV | title = Genetics of infectious diseases| journal = Hum Mol Genet| volume = 13 Spec No 2| pages =R187–R194| year = 2004|pmid = 15358724 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddh225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2875-11-396 Erica MW Billig, Philip G McQueen and F Ellis McKenzie, Foetal haemoglobin and the dynamics of paediatric malaria," ''Malaria Journal,'' 11:396, 2012] doi 10.1186/1475-2875-11-396&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin===

Some studies suggest that high levels of [[fetal hemoglobin]] (HbF) confer some protection against falciparum malaria in adults with [[Hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.library.ku.ac.ke%2Fbitstream%2Fhandle%2F123456789%2F15328%2FPrevalence%2520of%2520fetal%2520hemoglobin%2520and%2520antibody.pdf%3Fsequence%3D1%26isAllowed%3Dy&amp;usg=AOvVaw3LCpSDguFG3ndKjBqSyxFE Brenda AkinyiI Webala, "Prevalence of Fetal Hemoglobin and Antibody Responses to ''Plasmodium falciparum'' Antigens in Sickle Cell Disease Patients in Western Kenya."

== Validating the malaria hypothesis ==

Evolutionary biologist [[J.B.S. Haldane]] was the first to give a hypothesis on the relationship between malaria and the genetic disease. He first delivered his hypothesis at the Eighth International Congress of Genetics held in 1948 at Stockholm on a topic "The Rate of Mutation of Human Genes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bengtsson|first1=BO|last2=Tunlid|first2=A|title=The 1948 international congress of genetics in Sweden: people and politics|journal=Genetics|year=2010|volume=185|issue=3|pages=709–15|doi=10.1534/genetics.110.119305|pmid=20660651|pmc=2907196}}&lt;/ref&gt; He formalised in a technical paper published in 1949 in which he made a prophetic statement: "The corpuscles of the anaemic heterozygotes are smaller than normal, and more resistant to hypotonic solutions. It is at least conceivable that they are also more resistant to attacks by the sporozoa which cause malaria."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haldane|first1=J. B. S.|title=The rate of mutation of human genes|journal=Hereditas|year=1949|volume=35|issue=S1|pages=267–273|doi=10.1111/j.1601-5223.1949.tb03339.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became known as 'Haldane's malaria hypothesis', or concisely, the 'malaria hypothesis'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lederberg|first1=J|title=J. B. S. Haldane (1949) on infectious disease and evolution|journal=Genetics|year=1999|volume=153|issue=1|pages=1–3|pmid=10471694|pmc=1460735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=Aidoo/&gt;]]

Detailed study of a cohort of 1022 Kenyan children living near [[Lake Victoria]], published in 2002, confirmed this prediction.&lt;ref name=Aidoo&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08273-9| vauthors = Aidoo M, Terlouw DJ, Kolczak MS, McElroy PD, ter Kuile FO, Kariuki S, Nahlen BL, Lal AA, Udhayakumar V| title = Protective effects of the sickle cell gene against malaria morbidity and mortality| journal = Lancet| volume = 359| issue = 9314| pages = 1311–1312| year = 2002| pmid = 11965279| url = http://www.molbio.wisc.edu/carroll/466_class_files/lecture_notes/Aidoo_et_al._2002.pdf| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100609220122/http://www.molbio.wisc.edu/carroll/466_class_files/lecture_notes/Aidoo_et_al._2002.pdf| archivedate = 2010-06-09| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many SS children still died before they attained one year of age. Between 2 and 16 months the mortality in AS children was found to be significantly lower than that in AA children. This well-controlled investigation shows the ongoing action of natural selection through disease in a human population.

Analysis of [[genome wide association]] (GWA) and fine-resolution [[association mapping]] is a powerful method for establishing the inheritance of resistance to infections and other diseases. Two independent preliminary analyses of GWA association with severe falciparum malaria in Africans have been carried out, one by the Malariagen Consortium in a Gambian population and the other by Rolf Horstmann (Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg) and his colleagues on a Ghanaian population. In both cases the only signal of association reaching genome-wide significance was with the ''HBB'' locus encoding the ''β''-chain of hemoglobin, which is abnormal in HbS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jallow M, Teo YY, Small KS, Rockett KA, etal | title = Genome-wide and fine-resolution association analysis of malaria in West Africa| journal = Nat Genet | volume = 41 | issue = 6| year = 2009 |pages = 657–665 | pmid = 19465909 | pmc = 2889040 | doi = 10.1038/ng.388}}&lt;/ref&gt; This does not imply that HbS is the only gene conferring innate resistance to falciparum malaria; there could be many such genes exerting more modest effects that are challenging to detect by GWA because of the low levels of [[linkage disequilibrium]] in African populations. However the same GWA association in two populations is powerful evidence that the single gene conferring strongest innate resistance to ''falciparum'' malaria is that encoding HbS.

=== Fitnesses of different genotypes ===
The [[Fitness (biology)|fitnesses]] of different [[genotype]]s in an African region where there is intense malarial selection were estimated by Anthony Allison in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-1809.1954.tb01261.x | author = Allison AC | title = Notes on sickle-cell polymorphism| journal = Annals of Human Genetics| volume = 19| pages = 39–57| year = 1954|url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119888989/PDFSTART | pmid=13208024 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Amba people|Baamba]] population living in the Semliki Forest region in Western Uganda the sickle-cell heterozygote (AS) frequency is 40%, which means that the [[Allele frequency|frequency]] of the sickle-cell gene is 0.255 and 6.5% of children born are SS homozygotes. {{#tag:ref|If the frequency of the heterozygote is 0.40 the sickle-cell gene frequency (q) can be calculated from the [[Hardy–Weinberg principle|Hardy-Weinberg equation]] 2q(1-q) = 0,40, whence q = 0.255 and ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the frequency of sickle-cell homozygotes, is 0.065.|group=Note}}
It is a reasonable assumption that until modern treatment was available three quarters of the SS homozygotes failed to reproduce. To balance this loss of sickle-cell genes, a [[mutation rate]] of 1:10.2 per gene per generation would be necessary. This is about 1000 times greater than mutation rates measured in ''[[Drosophila]]'' and other organisms and much higher than recorded for the sickle-cell locus in Africans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vandepitte JM, Zuelzer WW, Neel JV, Colaert J | title = Evidence concerning the inadequacy of mutation as an explanation of the frequency of the sickle cell gene in the Belgian Congo| journal = Blood| volume = 10 | issue = 4| pages = 341–350| year = 1955|pmid = 14363315|url = http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/reprint/10/4/341}}&lt;/ref&gt; To balance the polymorphism, Anthony Allison estimated that the fitness of the AS heterozygote would have to be 1.26 times than that of the normal homozygote. Later analyses of survival figures have given similar results, with some differences from site to site. In Gambians, it was estimated that AS heterozygotes have 90% protection against ''P. falciparum''-associated severe anemia and cerebral malaria,&lt;ref name=Hill/&gt; whereas in the Luo population of Kenya it was estimated that AS heterozygotes have 60% protection against severe malarial anemia.&lt;ref name=Aidoo/&gt; These differences reflect the intensity of transmission of ''P. falciparum'' malaria from locality to locality and season to season, so fitness calculations will also vary. In many African populations the AS frequency is about 20%, and a fitness superiority over those with normal hemoglobin of the order of 10% is sufficient to produce a stable polymorphism.

{{Fats}}
'''Interesterified fat''' is a type of oil where the fatty acids have been moved from one [[triglyceride]] molecule to another. This is generally done to modify the [[melting point]], slow [[rancidification]] and create an oil more suitable for [[deep frying]] or making [[margarine]] with good taste and low saturated fat content. It is not the same as [[Hydrogenated oil|partial hydrogenation]] which produces [[trans fatty acid]]s, but interesterified fats used in the food industry can come from hydrogenated fat, for simplicity and [[frugality]].

==Chemistry==

Fats such as [[soybean oil]] consist mainly of various [[triglycerides]] which are made up of a [[glycerol]] backbone esterified to three fatty acid molecules.  The triglycerides contain a mixture of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Interesterification is carried out by blending the desired oils and then rearranging the fatty acids over the glycerol backbone with, for instance, the help of catalysts or [[lipase]] enzymes.&lt;ref name=ISEO /&gt; [[Polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s (PUFAs) decrease the melting point of fats significantly.  A triglyceride containing three saturated fatty acids is generally solid at room temperature and not very desirable for many applications. Rearranging these triglycerides with oils containing unsaturated fatty acids lowers the melting point and creates fats with properties better suited for target food products. In addition, blending interesterified oils with liquid oils allows the reduction in saturated fatty acids in many trans fatty acid free food products.  The interesterified fats can be separated through controlled crystallization, also called fractionation.&lt;ref name= Kellens&gt;

In vegetable polyunsaturated oils, the PUFA is commonly found at the middle position (sn2) on the glycerol.  Stearic acid is not usually found at sn2 in vegetable oils used in the human diet.&lt;ref name=ISEO&gt;{{cite web|title= Food Fats and oils

===Reviews===

===Hypotheses===
{{technical|date=March 2014}}
In most vegetable dietary fats, the [[Palmitic acid|palmitic]] (C16:0) and [[stearic acid]] (C18:0) saturated fats mainly occupy the 1- and 3-positions of the [[triacylglycerol]] molecule, whereas an unsaturated fatty acid such as [[oleic acid]] (18:1ω9) or [[linoleic acid]] (18:2ω6) usually occupies the 2-position. In animal fats, this is not the case. Interesterification of vegetable oils will enhance the amount of saturated fatty acids at the 2-position. Fatty acids at the 2-position are biologically different from fatty acids at the 1 and 3 position because they are handled differently during digestion and metabolism, and a relevant scientific question is whether there are health effects following from this. Although this question has received relatively little attention in dietary fats and health research, there are a number of good controlled human intervention studies that have addressed it.

In studies addressing the health effects of interesterification as such, a diet high in interesterified fat should be compared with a diet high in a noninteresterified fat with the same fatty acid composition. If the two diets show similar changes in the resulting blood lipid profiles (i.e. not different from each other), this indicates interesterification has no effect on metabolism or biological effects.
Conversely, effects of interesterification cannot be properly addressed if the interesterified fat and the noninteresterified fat being compared have different fatty acid compositions.

The control was the same fat blend with a similar fatty acid composition, but not interesterified. The IE fat blend contained more C16:0 on the 2-position (18%) than the control blend (7%). None of the fasting levels of blood lipids measured after 3 weeks showed any change related to treatment of the fat blend. Fasting glucose level was also not affected.

In 1970, Grande et al.&lt;ref name= Grande&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/reprint/23/9/1184.pdf |vauthors=Grande F, Anderson JT, Keys A |title= Comparison of effects of palmitic and stearic acids in the diet on serum cholesterol in man. |journal= Am J Clin Nutr |year= 1970 |volume=23 | issue=9 |pages= 1184–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; used interesterification to prepare a blend of fats and oils mimicking the fatty acid composition of cocoa butter. No difference between the interesterified fat blend and cocoa butter was observed in levels of total cholesterol in fasting blood.

Recently, in a study funded by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board, Sundram et al.&lt;ref name=NutrMetab&gt;{{cite journal
 | url=http://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/pdf/1743-7075-4-3.pdf
 |vauthors=Sundram K, Karupaiah T, Hayes K |title= Stearic acid-rich interesterified fat and trans-rich fat raise the LDL/HDL ratio and plasma glucose relative to palm olein in humans |journal= Nutr Metab |year= 2007|doi=10.1186/1743-7075-4-3|accessdate=2007-01-19 |volume= 4 |pages= 3
 | pmid=17224066
 | pmc=1783656}}&lt;/ref&gt;  compared the effects of three types of fat: native palm olein, a blend with partially hydrogenated soybean oil and an interesterified mixture of oils. They concluded both the IE blend and the partially hydrogenated fat blend increased the fasting ratio of [[low-density lipoprotein|LDL]] to [[high-density lipoprotein|HDL]] cholesterol, indicating an adverse effect on CVD risk. Sundram et al. also found that fasting plasma glucose levels were higher after 4 weeks on the interesterified fat than after the other diets. For the postprandial study the glucose incremental area under the curve (IAUC) following the IE meal was 40% greater than after either other meal (p&lt;0.001), and was linked to relatively depressed insulin and C-peptide (p&lt;0.05). As was pointed out in a letter to the Editor by Destaillats et al.,&lt;ref name=Dest&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/4/1/10 |vauthors=Destaillats F, Moulin J, Bezelgues JB |title= Letter to the editor: healthy alternatives to trans fats |journal=Nutr and Metab|year=2007 |volume= 4 |pages= 10 |doi=10.1186/1743-7075-4-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; a major limitation of the Sundram study is that the diets differed in overall fatty acid composition. The interesterified fat had 30% more saturated and 57% less monounsaturated fatty acids than the untreated palm olein. The direction of the effects on blood lipids are in line with what can be predicted based on these differences in fatty acid content between the study diets (Mensink 2003).&lt;ref name=Mensink&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/reprint/77/5/1146.pdf |vauthors= Mensink RP, Zock PL, Kester AD, Katan MB |title= Effects of dietary fatty acids and carbohydrates on the ratio of serum total to HDL cholesterol and on serum lipids and apolipoproteins: a meta-analysis of 60 controlled trials.|journal= Am J Clin Nutr |year= 2003 |volume=77| issue=5 |pages= 1146–1155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Partnership for Microbicides''' or '''IPM''' is a non-profit product development partnership (PDP) founded by Dr. [[Zeda Rosenberg]] in 2002 to prevent [[HIV]] transmission by accelerating the development and availability of a safe and effective [[microbicide]] for use by women in developing countries.

Since its inception, IPM has focused on developing HIV-prevention products for women including gels, films, tablets and rings that contain antiretroviral (ARV)-based microbicides. Rights to incorporate existing ARVs into products developed specifically for use in developing countries have been negotiated with pharmaceutical companies working in the HIV field.

'''John Bell''' (12 May 1763{{snd}}15 April 1820) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Anatomy|anatomist]] and [[surgeon]].

==Life==
Bell was born in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]]; an elder brother of [[Charles Bell|Sir Charles Bell]]. After completing his professional education at Edinburgh, he carried on from 1790 in Surgeons' Square an anatomical lecture-theatre, where, in spite of much opposition, due partly to the unconservative character of his teaching, he attracted large audiences by his lectures, in which he was for a time assisted by his younger brother Charles. From 1793 to 1795, he published ''Discourses on the Nature and Cure of Wounds''.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Bell, John (anatomist)|display=Bell, John|volume=3|page=686}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered, along with [[Pierre-Joseph Desault]] and [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]], to be a founder of the modern surgery of the [[Circulatory system|vascular system]].

A man of compassion, Bell made many enemies because he was outspoken about the unnecessary pain and suffering inflicted by incompetent surgeons practicing in Scotland. In 1800 he became involved in an unfortunate controversy with [[James Gregory (physician)|James Gregory]] (1753–1821), the professor of medicine at Edinburgh. Gregory in 1800 attacked the system whereby the fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh acted in rotation as surgeons at the Royal Infirmary, with the result that the younger fellows were excluded. Bell, who was among the number, composed an Answer for the Junior Members (1800), and ten years later published a collection of ''Letters on Professional Character and Manners'', which he had addressed to Gregory. After his exclusion from the infirmary he ceased to lecture and devoted himself to study and practice.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Bell was also a talented artist, and was one of the few medical men to illustrate his own work. In 1816 he was injured by a fall from his horse and in the following year went to [[Italy]] for the benefit of his health.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; He died at [[Rome]] on 15 April 1820 and he is buried in the [[Protestant Cemetery, Rome]], just behind the tomb of poet [[John Keats]].

His works also included ''Principles of Surgery'' (1801), ''Anatomy of the Human Body'', which went through several editions and was translated into German, and ''Observations on Italy'', published by his widow in 1825.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

'''Julius Perlis''' (19 January 1880, in [[Białystok]] (Poland, then [[Russian Empire]]) – 11 September 1913, in Ennstal) was an [[Austria]]n [[chess]] player.

==Biography==
At the beginning of his career, Perlis played in Vienna, winning in 1901. Then, in 1902 he took 3rd (Quadrangular), took 2nd, behind [[Mikhail Chigorin]] in 1903, and won in 1904. The same year, he took 3rd in Vienna (Gambit tournament). The event was won by [[Carl Schlechter]]. In 1905, he tied for 4-6th in [[Barmen]] (Masters B). In 1906, he took 9th in [[Ostend]] (Schlechter won). In 1906, he took 3rd in Vienna. In 1907, he tied for 7-8th in Vienna ([[Jacques Mieses]] won). In 1907, he took 16th in Ostend (Masters B). In 1908, he tied for 7-8th in Vienna (Trebitsch tournament). In 1909, he took 7th in [[Sankt Petersburg]]. The event was won by [[Emanuel Lasker]] and [[Akiba Rubinstein]]. In 1909, he took 3rd in Vienna [[Richard Réti]] won). In 1909/10, he took 3rd in Vienna. In 1911, he took 13th in Karlsbad [[Karlovy Vary]] ([[Richard Teichmann]] won). In 1912, he took 5th in [[San Sebastian, Spain|San Sebastian]], [[Spain]] (Rubinstein won). In 1912, he tied for 3rd-4th in Vienna (Schlechter won). In 1913, he took 5th in Vienna ([[Rudolf Spielmann]] won).   

Perlis died from exposure in a mountaineering accident in the Alps in 1913.

'''KGC''' (originally ''Korea Ginseng Corporation'', ''Korea Ginseng Corp.'' Korean : 한국인삼공사, Hanguk Insam Gongsa) is a [[ginseng]] company in [[South Korea]]. KGC's sales volume share was 35% of total Korea's herbal/traditional products market in 2011.&lt;ref name="euromonitor"&gt;{{cite web

| title=  Herbal/Traditional Products in South Korea

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

KGC produces popular Korean Red Ginseng products such as Korean Red Giseng Heaven/Earth/Good, Korean Red Ginseng Extract, Korean Red Ginseng Powder, Honeyed Korean Red Ginseng Slices, Korean Red Ginseng Tonic, etc. It has expanded outside Korea, especially into the East Asian market like [[China]] and [[Taiwan]].

KGC is a subsidiary company of [[KT&amp;G]], and its two headquarters are in [[Seoul]] and [[Daejeon]].

==History==
KGC's brand of Korean Red Ginseng, CKJ, is known as Cheong-Kwan-Jang in Korea and overseas. This brand name goes back to the early 1940s. Because of increased export demand for Korean Red Ginseng at the end of the Japanese colonial period, lots of fake root were prospering. To find a way to distinguish real ginseng, the Monopoly Bureau of the Japanese General Government began using the label "Cheong-Kwan-Jang," which is translated as "officially government approved."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2010/11/123_76142.html |title=Whats special about Cheong-Kwan-Jang? |last=Kim |first=Tae-gyu |date=11 November 2010 |work=[[The Korea Times]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HH7Jdc5f?url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2010/11/123_76142.html |archivedate=10 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sale of KGC was a government monopoly from 1899 to 1996. Since then, KGC has held its position at the top of the market, even though the name has changed from the Monopoly Bureau to Korea Tobacco &amp; Ginseng Corporation, and finally to KT&amp;G subsidiary Korea Ginseng Corp.

==KGC Global==
KGC products are now exported to over 40 countries. KGC also has overseas branches in the USA, China, Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines and Indonesia.

R., &amp; Shipherd, J. C. (2016). Transforming a System: Improving Patient-Centered Care for Sexual and Gender Minority Veterans. LGBT Health. &lt;/ref&gt; Using diagnostic codes in medical record data, Blosnich and colleagues found that the prevalence of transgender veterans in VHA (22.9/100,000) is five times higher than reported prevalence of transgender-related diagnoses in the general population (4.3/100,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blosnich | first1 = J. R. | last2 = Brown | first2 = G. R. | last3 = Shipherd | first3 = J. C. | last4 = Kauth | first4 = M. | last5 = Piegari | first5 = R. I. | last6 = Bossarte | first6 = R.

R. | last2 = Jones | first2 = K. T. | year = 2014 | title = Racial Health Disparities in a Cohort of 5,135 Transgender Veterans | url = | journal = Journal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities | volume = 1 | issue = 4| pages = 257–266 | doi=10.1007/s40615-014-0032-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brown also notes that this methodology fails to identify [[transgender]] veterans who have not disclosed their gender identity to providers, those who don’t meet criteria for a diagnosis, or veterans who get their transition-related care outside of the VHA. 

Two recent events increased focus on LGBT veterans in VHA. In 2011 VHA released a national transgender healthcare policy (VHA Directive 2011-024/later, 2013-003),&lt;ref&gt;Veterans Health Administration. (2013). Providing Health Care for Transgender and Intersex Veterans. (VHA Directive 2013-003). Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; which covers gender counseling, hormone therapy, pre-surgical evaluations, and post-surgical care, but transition surgeries are not currently covered. At least one report suggests an increase in veterans receiving transgender-related diagnoses in VHA since the transgender policy was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kauth | first1 = M. | last2 = Shipherd | first2 = J. C. | last3 = Lindsay | first3 = J. | last4 = Blosnich | first4 = J. R. | last5 = Brown | first5 = G. | last6 = Jones | first6 = K.

The second event is related to the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]'s repeal of its [[Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell]] policy in 2011, allowing openly gay, lesbian and bisexual military personnel to serve in the [[armed forces]].  However, ending Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell did not change the military’s policy toward transgender people who continued to be banned from military service. Policy changes that allowed open transgender service were announced in June, 2016 and are effective October 1, 2016.  The repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell is expected to increase the numbers of LGB military personnel and consequently increase the number of LGB veterans who seek care at the VHA after service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mattocks | first1 = K.

==Concerns from Gay and Lesbian Veterans==
Some researchers have raised concerns that LGBT veterans may not feel welcome at the VHA.&lt;ref name=Sherman11&gt; {{cite journal | last1 = Sherman | first1 = M. D. | last2 = Kauth | first2 = M. | last3 = Shipherd | first3 = J. C. | last4 = Street | first4 = R. | year = 2014 | title = Communication between VA providers and sexual and gender minority Veterans | url = | journal = Psychological Services | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 235–242 | doi=10.1037/a0035840}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sherman and coauthors found that 24% of a sample of 58 LGBT veterans had not disclosed their sexual orientation to any VHA provider.  The researchers noted that LGBT veterans may be uncomfortable disclosing their sexual orientation or gender identity because when they were in the military this information could lead to their discharge from service. Although VHA never had a policy prohibiting care to LGBT veterans, former military personnel often associate military policy with VHA policy.&lt;ref name=Sherman11 /&gt;  Sherman and colleagues also found that some LGBT veterans worried that disclosing their sexual or gender minority status would lead to losing VA medical benefits, even though there is a Patient’s Rights and Responsibilities Policy&lt;ref name=PatientRights&gt; Rights and Responsibilities of VA Patients and Residents of Community Living Centers.   Retrieved May 13, 2016, from http://www.va.gov/health/rights/patientrights.asp &lt;/ref&gt; that prevents this type of discrimination.  

In the same study, Sherman and colleagues examined attitudes and practices of 202 VHA providers at two mid-western hospitals and found that only half of providers had asked their patients about sexual orientation in the past year, despite it being relevant to health care.&lt;ref name=Sherman11 /&gt;  Mental health providers were more likely to ask patients about sexual orientation than medical providers, perhaps due to an awareness of the stress associated with being a member of a minority group.  Less than half of the VHA providers overall (43%) had received any kind of training in LGBT health issues since they began practicing. 

LGBT people who disclose their sexual orientation to healthcare providers and feel comfortable talking to their providers about sexuality and sexual health also report greater satisfaction with their healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sherman | first1 = M. | last2 = Kauth | first2 = M. | last3 = Ridener | first3 = L. | last4 = Shipherd | first4 = J. C. | last5 = Bratkovich | first5 = K. | last6 = Beaulieu | first6 = G. | year = 2014 | title = An empirical investigation of challenges and recommendations for welcoming sexual and gender minority Veterans into VA care | doi = 10.1037/a0034826 | journal = Professional Psychology: Research and Practice | volume = 45| issue = 6| pages = 433–442}}&lt;/ref&gt;  LGBT people, including LGBT veterans, have unique health needs that need screening and follow up, which require healthcare providers initiate conversations about sexuality and gender identity and expression with patients.

==Responses from Veterans' Health Administration==
To address the healthcare needs of LGBT veterans and create a more welcoming environment at VHA facilities, as well as increase the competency of providers, VHA has taken several actions, starting with several policy changes. For example, patient&lt;ref name=PatientRights /&gt; and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) employee &lt;ref&gt;McDonald, R. (April 20, 2015). Equal Employment Opportunity, Diversity and Inclusion, No FEAR, and Whistleblower Rights and Protection Policy Statement.   Retrieved May 13, 2016, from http://www.diversity.va.gov/policy/files/EEO_Policy_Statement.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; non-discrimination policies now include protections for sexual orientation, gender identity and expression and also have an inclusive definition of family.&lt;ref name=FamilyRights&gt; Rights and Responsibilities of Family Members of VA Patients and Residents of CLCs.   Retrieved May 13, 2016, from http://www.va.gov/health/rights/familyrights.asp &lt;/ref&gt; A policy on the rights of veterans’ family members includes a broad definition of “family” that allows LGBT veterans to decide who is regarded as part of their family.&lt;ref name=FamilyRights /&gt; As mentioned above, VHA also issued a national transgender healthcare policy in 2011 and began training providers on transgender care. At present, VHA does not have a separate healthcare policy on LGB care, although such a policy is in development.

In 2011, VHA established the [http://www.va.gov/healthequity/ Office of Health Equity] to work at a systems level to reduce [[health disparities]] in a number of vulnerable populations, including LGBT veterans, by raising awareness and advocating for healthcare system changes.&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe, V. A., &amp; Uchendu, U. S. (2014). Ensuring appropriate care for LGBT veterans in the Veterans Health Administration. Hastings Center Report, 44(s4), S53-S55. &lt;/ref&gt; One important activity by the Office of Health Equity has been their championing of VA facility participation in the Human Rights Campaign Healthcare Equality Index survey. In the most recent survey, 114 of 121 VA facilities participated in the HEI and 96 (84%) facilities received “Leader” status in LGBT patient care. To achieve “Leader” status in the HEI, agencies must demonstrate that they meet criteria in four domains: 1) patient non-discrimination policies; 2) equal visitation policies; 3) employment non-discrimination policies; and 4) training in LGBT patient-centered care.&lt;ref&gt;Healthcare Equality Index 2016.   Retrieved May 13, 2016, from http://www.hrc.org/campaigns/healthcare-equality-index &lt;/ref&gt;

To address clinical practice issues, in 2012 the VHA established the [http://www.patientcare.va.gov/LGBT/index.asp LGBT Program within the Office of Patient Care Services].&lt;ref name=LGBTPatientCare /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kauth5 /&gt; The LGBT Program supports two internal websites (SharePoints) – one on LGB veteran care and one on transgender veteran care – which host archived staff trainings, links to policies, links to professional society guidelines, journal articles, facility information about LGBT support groups, and LGBT awareness campaign materials.  The LGBT program also worked with subject-matter experts to create on-demand webinars about transgender veteran healthcare for the VHA’s internal online educational platform and two webinars about LGB veteran healthcare for an Internet platform. These programs are now publicly available through VHA TRAIN,&lt;ref&gt;VHA TRAIN Employee Education System.

Retrieved May 13, 2016, from http://www.vehu.va.gov/&lt;/ref&gt; 

The LGBT Program also worked to develop clinical support for VHA providers.  E-consultation on transgender care is available to any VHA provider at any facility through the veteran’s electronic health record.&lt;ref&gt;Shipherd, J. C., Kauth, M., &amp; Matza, A. R. (in press). Nationwide interdisciplinary e-consultation on transgender care in the Veterans Health Administration. Telemedicine Journal and e-Health. &lt;/ref&gt; Providers asking a question get a case-specific response from an interdisciplinary team of experienced clinicians. The national e-consultation program began in 2014 and became completely national in spring 2015. In addition, interdisciplinary teams of providers can participate in an intensive training/case-consultation program through videoconferencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kauth | first1 = M. | last2 = Shipherd | first2 = J.

Transgender Health. &lt;/ref&gt;  For this program, at minimum, a “team” consists of one behavioral health provider and one medical provider and meets with experts twice a month for one hour over seven months for a total of 14 sessions. The participating teams receive a 15-20 minute didactic presentation on a transgender care topic and the rest of the session is spent on case-based consultation. Each participating team presents 1-2 cases, while others listen and ask questions. By June 2016, 55 interdisciplinary teams of more than 370 providers will have completed this seven-month training.

Another training program consists of nine [http://www.patientcare.va.gov/LGBT/LGBT_Veteran_Training.asp interprofessional postdoctoral psychology fellowships in LGBT health] sponsored by the VHA Office of Academic Affiliations and Mental Health Services.&lt;ref&gt;LGBT  Veteran Training.   Retrieved May 13, 2016, from http://www.patientcare.va.gov/LGBT/LGBT_Veteran_Training.asp &lt;/ref&gt; The LGBT Program advises these nine fellowship sites, which include VA medical centers at Bedford, MA; Boston, MA; Chicago, IL; Honolulu, HI; Houston, TX; Milwaukee, WI; San Diego, CA; San Francisco, CA; and West Haven, CT. Fellows provide direct clinical services to LGBT veterans in a variety of clinical settings, as well as train staff and outreach to LGBT community agencies.

In addition to responding to the needs of LGBT Veterans, the VHA Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) has taken steps to foster a supportive environment for LGBT employees.&lt;ref name=LGBTProgram&gt; LGBT Program.   Retrieved May 13, 2016, from http://www.diversity.va.gov/programs/lgbt.aspx &lt;/ref&gt; Employees enjoy the same discrimination protections as patients, including protections for sexual orientation and gender identity. For example, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) offers protections to transgender VA employees, including access to sanitary facilities, use of preferred name and pronouns in employee files, and avenues through which to report workplace discrimination, as well as healthcare coverage for transition related care.&lt;ref&gt;Guidance Regarding the Employment of Transgender Individuals in the Federal Workplace.

One goal of the SEP is to establish a manager at each VHA facility who serves as the facility expert on LGBT policy and leads the staff in creating a welcoming environment to LGBT employees through educational activities and cultural competency trainings.&lt;ref name=LGBTProgram /&gt;

[[Food riot]]s may occur when there is a shortage or unequal distribution of [[food]]. Causes can be food price rises, [[harvest failure]]s, incompetent [[food storage]], transport problems, [[food speculation]], [[hoarding]], poisoning of food, or attacks by pests. During the period 2007–2008, a rise in global food prices led to [[2007–2008 world food price crisis|riots in various countries]]. A similar crisis recurred in [[2010–12 world food price crisis|2010–2012]].

==Food riots==

===17th century===
* [[Moscow uprising of 1648|Salt riot]], also known as the Moscow Uprising of 1648, started because of the government's replacement of different [[taxes]] with a universal salt tax for the purpose of replenishing the state treasury after the [[Time of Troubles]]. This drove up the price of [[salt]], leading to violent riots in the streets of [[Moscow]].
* [[Novgorod uprising of 1650]] – an uprising in [[Novgorod]], caused by the [[Tsardom of Russia|Russian]] government's [[bulk purchasing]] of grain (traded to [[Sweden]]) and the resulting increases in the price of bread.

===18th century===
* [[Boston Bread Riot]] – the last of a series of three riots by the poor of [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], between 1710 and 1713, in response to food shortages and high bread prices. The riot ended with minimal{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=June 2017}} casualties.
* [[Flour War]] – occurred in 1775, this was an uprising caused by the excessive price of bread in France before the [[French Revolution]].  Early in the season for wheat harvesting and flour production, the government enacted fewer [[price controls]] than later in the year, leaving prices to the [[free market]].  This caused the price of flour to climb, and the working classes could not buy bread.
* [[Réveillon riots]] occurred 26–29 April 1789&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safarix.com/0131930370/app02lev1sec1|title=Redirect|author=|date=|website=www.Safarix.com|accessdate=16 June 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309160745/http://www.safarix.com/0131930370/app02lev1sec1|archivedate=9 March 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; centered in the [[St. Antoine]] district of Paris where a factory which produced luxury wallpaper was owned by [[Jean-Baptiste Réveillon]]. The factory employed around 300 people. The riots were one of the first instances of [[violence]] during the [[French Revolution]].
* [[Women's March on Versailles]] was one of the earliest and most significant events of the [[French Revolution]]. The march began among women in the marketplaces of Paris who, on the morning of 5 October 1789, were near rioting over the high price and scarcity of bread. Their demonstrations quickly became intertwined with the activities of revolutionaries who were seeking liberal political reforms and a [[constitutional monarchy]] for France.

===19th century===
* The [[Merthyr Rising]] in 1831 was the violent climax to many years of simmering unrest among the large [[working class]] population of [[Merthyr Tydfil]] in [[South Wales]] and the surrounding area.
* [[Flour riot of 1837]] – occurred in [[New York City]] in 1837. The riot was caused by a combination of [[poverty]] and the rising cost of [[flour]].
* [[Potato riots]] – the mass anti-[[serfdom]] movement of peasants (1834 and 1840–44) in the [[Russian Empire]].
[[File:Apr2 richmond riot.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An illustration of the [[Southern Bread Riots|Bread riots]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]]]]
* [[Southern bread riots]] – events of [[civil disorder|civil unrest]] in the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], perpetrated mostly by women in March and April 1863.

* [[1917 Potato riots]] - a food shortage during the WW I caused a food rebellion in the Dutch capital city [[Amsterdam]] in July 1917.
* [[Rice riots of 1918]] – a series of popular disturbances that erupted throughout [[Japan]] from July to September 1918, which brought about the collapse of the [[Terauchi Masatake]] administration. A precipitous rise in the price of [[rice]] caused extreme economic hardship, and rural protests spread to the towns and cities.
*[[1939 Nupi Lan Revolt of Manipur, India]] - Nupi Lan –which means women’s war in Manipuri- is one of the important movements in the history of Manipuri women. It sowed the new seeds of economic and political reforms for a new Manipur in the early 40’s. It was started in 1939 as an agitation by Manipuri women against the oppressive economic and administrative policies ruled by the Manipur Maharaja and the Political Agent –Mr. Gimson- of the British Government (1933-45) in Manipur, and later on, evolved into a movement for the constitutional and administrative reform in Manipur. &lt;ref&gt;http://themanipurpage.tripod.com/history/nupilal.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Novocherkassk massacre]] was events tied to the labor strike of a locomotive building plant in [[Novocherkassk]], a city in the [[Soviet Union]], (now [[Russia]]). The events eventually culminated in riots of June 1–2, 1962 when reportedly 26 protesters were killed by the Soviet Army troops, and 87 were wounded. The riots were a direct result of shortages of food and provisions, as well as the poor working conditions in the factory.
* [[1970 Polish protests]] - sparked by a sudden increase of controlled prices of food.
* [[Food riots in the Middle East]] – Several food riots occurred in the [[Middle East]] during the 20th century.
:* [[1977 Egyptian bread riots]] affected most major cities in [[Egypt]] January 18–19, 1977.

As many as 79 people were killed and over 550 injured in the protests,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egyptians hit Soviet reaction|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aLszAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vzgHAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3340,2175166&amp;dq=food+riots+egypt&amp;hl=en|access-date=29 April 2013|newspaper=Bangor Daily News|date=24 January 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were only ended with the deployment of the army and the re-institution of the subsidies.
* [[1989 riots in Argentina]] were a series of [[riot]]s and related episodes of [[looting]] in stores and supermarkets in [[Argentina]], during the last part of the [[president of Argentina|presidency]] of [[Raúl Alfonsín]], between May and June 1989.

[[File:Swiss crop circle detail.jpg|thumb|Lodging caused by humans flattening [[grain]] to make a [[crop circle]]]]

'''Lodging''' is the bending over of the stems near ground level of grain crops, which makes them very difficult to [[harvest]], and can dramatically reduce yield. Lodging in [[cereal]]s is often a result of the combined effects of inadequate standing power of the crop and conditions such as rain, wind, [[hail]], [[topography]], [[soil]], previous crop, and others.&lt;ref name=prog/&gt;

Lodging may occur at the [[Root (plant)|root]] or the [[Stem (botany)|stem]]; the latter typically happens later, when the stem is dry and brittle. The timing of lodging can control its effect on yield, [[plant disease|disease]], grain moisture, quality, and evenness of [[ripening]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grainews.ca/2012/03/05/lodging-in-cereals/|title=Lodging in cereals - Grainews|author=|date=5 March 2012|website=grainews.ca|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The debut issue of Nagraj was written by Parshuram Sharma and illustrated by Sanjay ashtputre
After that Pratap Mullick illustrated the character for around 50 issues, ending in 1995. Since 1995, the illustration work of Nagraj has been taken over by artist and writer [[Anupam Sinha]].

The name Nagraj is derived from the word "[[Nagaraja]]"([[Hindi]]:नागराजा ) which is itself made up of two words "[[nāga]]" ([[Hindi]]:नाग) and "[[raja]]" ([[Hindi]]:राजा) where the word "nāga" means snake and "raja" means king. Nagraj is believed to have been inspired by the mythological ''[[Ichchhadhari Nag]]'' (shape shifting snakes) and historical ''[[Vishmanushya]]'' (venomous human). His stories create a rich blend of mythology, fantasy, magic, and science fiction. Many of Nagraj's fans believe that, over time, Nagraj's comics have developed a snake mythology of its own, which is unique to the popular Indian beliefs about snakes that are prevalent among the masses.

Nagraj was originally conceived as an enemy of international terrorism. In his debut issue, Nagraj was unleashed as an international terror weapon by the evil scientist Professor Nagmani. Nagraj, in this first mission, was tasked with stealing a golden statue of a Goddess from a temple that was protected by tribal devotees, snakes, and by a mysterious 300-year-old [[Sadhu]] named Baba Gorakhnath. Nagraj succeeded in his task, but upon confrontation with Gorakhnath and his mystic black [[mongoose]] shikangi, was defeated. Gorakhnath read his mind and discovered that Professor Nagmani had implanted a mind control device in the form of a capsule in Nagraj's head, to keep him under his control. Gorakhnath operated and removed the capsule from Nagraj's head, setting Nagraj free of Professor Nagmani's control. Nagraj then became Baba Goraknath's disciple and vowed to eliminate crime and terror from the Earth. Since then, Nagraj has thrice toured the world and defeated many villains and terrorists.

Nagraj lives as Raj (After Nagraj Ke Baad, he is under disguise of Nagraj Shah) in a fictional Metropolitan City Mahanagar as an employee of a TV channel that he owns secretly.

== Fictional character biography ==

In ancient times, there existed a kingdom known as Takshaknagar, ruled by King Takshakraj and Queen Lalita. The couple had no worries except for one fact that, they had no children. The absence of a prince or princess made Nagpasha the only potential heir to the throne. Nagpasha was the younger brother of the King Takshakraj. Knowing that he was the only potential heir to the throne, Nagpasha started living a lavish worry-free life.

As time passed, Queen Lalita started getting depressed for not having a child of her own. The king realised the cause of her depression and became upset as well. The couple used to pray to their family deity [[Deva (Hinduism)|Dev]] Kaljayi for his blessings. Dev Kaljayi also knew of their grievances, so one day he blessed them to have a great child. His blessings came true as the queen soon became pregnant and the whole kingdom rejoiced, except for Nagpasha. The birth of this child meant the loss of the throne for him, so he decided to kill the child before he was born.

One day when the queen was going to pray to Deva Kaljayi, Nagpasha replaced the curtained plate of her offerings to the god with one containing a dead mongoose. The Snake God got angry and knocked her unconscious with his venomous breath. The king sought forgiveness from the [[Devata|Devta]] and pleaded with him to cure his wife, to which the Devta refused. Then the desperate king tried to commit suicide. Not able to withstand a devotee's death, Deva Kaljayi showed him a way to save the queen's life. He gave a crystal to the king and told him to treat it with the queen's medicine. The crystal would divert all the poison from the queen's body to the child's body. However, due to the ill effects of the poison. the queen would lose her fertility.

The kingdom was highly grieved, as was the king. Nagpasha was overjoyed that he was now the sole heir to the throne. When the child was born, everyone believed him dead because his whole body was blue and showed no signs of life. As per Hindu rituals, the newborn baby was thrown into the river.

Nagpasha rejoiced and went to Deva Kaljayi; the deity that also protected the grand royal treasure in form of a giant two-headed snake, and asked him to hand over the royal treasures, telling him that now he was the sole heir to the throne, so the treasure rightfully belonged to him. Deva Kaljayi refused and told him that the "real successor" to the throne was alive and when the time comes the treasure will be handed over to him. Enraged, Nagpasha raised his sword against the deity only to be thrown away by a mere flick of the giant snake's tail. Nagpasha fell upon two bowls, one containing the highly toxic venom (halahal,the greatest form of venom as believed by Hindus) which destroyed his face and mixed with his blood, and the other containing Amrit, which made him immortal. Simultaneous effects of both made Nagpasha an immortal, venomous man. At that time, Nagpasha could not tolerate the changes in his body and fainted.

When the king was informed of the happenings by Dev Kaljayi, he realised that his son was not dead and he also realised the potential dangers to his son's life. So he ordered his faithful [[astrologer]] Vedacharya, who had great knowledge of [[Amulet|Tilism]] to enclose the treasure in a Tilism which could be broken only by his son. Vedacharya made the tilism with the co-operation of Dev Kaljayi to ensure that no one, except for the king's son, will be able to break the tilism, not even immortal Nagpasha. When Nagpasha came to his senses, he realised that he had lost the treasure. Enraged, he murdered the king and the queen.

The child, floating away on the river in his state of [[suspended animation]], got stuck somewhere in bushes. He laid there for a long time.

Meanwhile, the snake [[deity]] Deva Kaljayi appeared in the dreams of King Maniraj and his wife Queen Manika, rulers of ageless [[Ichchhadhaari naags]], living secretly on an invisible island in the Indian Ocean called Nagdweep. He told them the location of the baby and asked them to cure him. They did so and discovered that the baby was far more venomous than the greatest snake on Nagdweep, which was Mahatma Kaaldoot, indicating that he had [[Divinity|divine]] venom of the god. Initially, the raj vaid was unsure whether he would be able to cure the child, but since Dev Kaljayi himself asked the king for his treatment, he was assured that the treatment will work. According to the rules, no one was permitted to bring an outsider to the island, so the king decided to keep his presence a secret.

Many years passed and the treatment started showing results and, although still in the suspended animation, the color of the baby had gradually changed to green. The king gave the news to the queen and they decided to adopt the child, since they had no child of their own. Their decision was heard by Vishandhar, an evil [[Tantra|Tantrik]] who wanted to become the ruler of the island, but was afraid of Mahatma Kaaldoot. He attacked the secret area where the baby was kept and escaped with him, but fearing the wrath of the god, he decided not to kill the baby and instead placed him back into the same bushes in the river where he was found. His plan failed as the queen soon got pregnant and gave birth to a daughter who was named Visarpi.

Vishandhar never knew that the baby that he left astray was cured enough to regain his senses. First, his face and later, his whole body, turned normal color and he started crying. A priest of the nearby temple located him and gave him to Professor Nagmani, who was wandering in the nearby forest searching for snakes. For unknown reasons, the priest narrated a fake story that the child belonged to a woman, who was a devotee of the Snake God. He also said that the child was blessed by an ichchhadhari naag, so he asked Nagmani to bring up the child and allows him to avenge his mother.

Nagmani realised that the priest was lying, but he took the child. The blood tests of the child showed that the child had minute, microscopic snakes in his blood, filling in for [[white blood cell]]s. The child had extraordinary healing powers and was extremely venomous. He raised the baby, who became Nagraj.

== Plot summary ==
Nagraj was presented to the world as a creation of Professor Nagmani. He was meant to be an ultimate killing machine, and his original plan was to hire out Nagraj to the highest bidder among villains and terrorist groups of the world.

Professor Nagmani used him for his other experimental projects and leased him for international terrorism. Nagmani always claimed that Nagraj's powers were evolved by feeding him bits of snake poison until his blood itself became poison. He claimed that his [[venom]] was a result of snake bites from 1,000 different species of snakes (This echoes the Indian legends of poison-men or women, specifically raised to kill by their kiss) and his other powers evolved when he was treated with ashes of a dead ichchhadhaari snake. In reality, Nagraj was much more poisonous than any species of snakes because his venom was celestial.

Based largely on the Hindu myth of the shape shifting snake, Nagraj derives most of his powers from microscopic snakes that live in his bloodstream, in lieu of white blood cells. He has a number of powers, such as superhuman strength, poisonous breath and poison-bite, instant healing powers, and snakes that come out of his wrists. The snakes can come out individually or form into ropes, parachutes, and many others, depending on his imagination. His venom is believed to be far stronger than Potassium Cyanide, resulting in the melting of any living being's body if he bites them or vice versa.

For his first mission, he was sold for a sum of $1&amp;nbsp;million and was to recover an ancient statue. Nagraj succeeds, but then is foiled by the Sage Baba Gorakhnath, who frees him from the mind control of Professor Nagamani. Waking up to a newer world amid the calmness of Gorakhnath, Nagraj takes a vow to eliminate terrorism from the world and works toward achieving this goal.

In his initial issues, Nagraj's powers were too limited, and at times he was even knocked out by powerful human opponents. His strength was also quite human in nature, as he would marvel at his opponent's strength, such as when someone picked up a car. Over the years, Nagraj became powerful enough to not only pick up falling cars single-handedly, but also to achieve feats such as throwing things into outer space effortlessly. This happened in the issue ''Nagadhish'', when he threw the controlling sceptre of a serpent court official into orbit.

It is notable, and perhaps ironic, that Nagraj has now been transformed into a mythical/magical creature facing fantastical creatures as his enemies, with elements of sorcery/magic and even time and space travel.

== Powers and abilities ==
Nagraj, a character in the [[Raj Comics]] series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/offbeat/the-indian-superhero-league-a-look-at-the-desi-avengers-560568|title=The Indian Superhero League: A Look at the Desi Avengers|author=Trinaa Prasad|date=7 May 2014|work=NDTV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; has a huge arsenal of powers of which most can be credited to his divine birth in the comics storyline. Ever since Writer &amp; Artist Anupam Sinha took over the character of Nagraj, his powers and abilities have evolved a great deal making him powerful enough to counter any character of the comic universe.
Nagraj is arguably the most powerful superhero in the Raj Comics Universe and is among the most powerful [[Ichchhadhari Nag|Icchadhari Naagas]] of his time.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Time and again, he has even shown the potential of challenging the Supreme Snake-Gods like [[Sheshnaag]], [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]], [[Takshak]], Kaaljayi, and has defeated the likes of Kaaldoot, Trifana, Mahavyaal and Sheetnaag Kumar, who are ranked among the mightiest snakes in their species.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}
Nagraj's blood is a mixture of red blood cells, venom and minute snakes. He can "release" snakes out of his body at his will through his hands and use them for whatsoever purpose he likes, controlling them through telepathy. Though Nagraj gives full liberty to his snakes, his will can keep them inside his body, leading him at times to take enemy snakes inside him.
Snakes in his body can be classified into many groups:
* Microscopic snakes
Though these are snakes, of many different species, which commonly exist in the real world, being born in Nagraj's body
means that they share in Nagraj's extremely powerful venom. Nagraj uses them variably as ropes, ladders, parachutes, shields, boats, spies and messengers. Most notable among them is Naganand, at a time considered right-hand man of Nagraj, he left Nagraj's body to look after the people of Nagdweep at Nagraj's order after he upgraded to become an ichchhadhaari nag.
Nagraj has accumulated snakes which weren’t born in Nagraj's body, but it was Nagraj who gave them a place in his body. These snakes are usually snakes carrying some special abilities. They include
* Jagmag sarp(glowing snakes which in Nagayana series were shown shooting lasers),
* Naav-sarp(giant snakes, Nagraj uses them for making snake-boats),
* Nagfani sarp(literally "cactus-snakes") and
* Ichchhadhaari-naags (shape-shifting snakes).
* Nagfani-sarp Given by Deva Kaljayi to Nagraj, these snakes have spikes on their body and they can easily rip apart most opponents. The extent of their power is still a mystery; powers tend to be revealed when necessary for the plotline. For instance, Nagraj once used a snake to tie up an enemy, revealing that they may extend themselves at length.

:Nagfani snakes may have additional powers:
* Dhwansak sarp : short-living magical snakes which explode at will causing major damage to their surroundings. Though Nagfani-sarp warned Nagraj about using them too frequently, Nagraj never ever had any problems with their numbers while using them.
* Tishk sarp : This snake wraps himself around Nagraj's forehead giving him paranatural powers and the ability to break physical laws. Using these snakes Nagraj can see and fight against souls and invisible powers. While using this power
Nagraj's body gets divided into minute particles making him almost ethereal and immune to physical damage, also
temporarily disabling his power to eject snakes out of his body. This form of Nagraj is called Maanas Nagraj.
Ichchhadhaari nags.
They may or may not be of the same species but all snakes possessing the power of shape-shifting come under this
category. They include a big bunch of ichchhadhaari naags banished from Nagdweep. It is quite notable that some of
them possess such great powers which rival Nagraj's own, but they all hold great respect for Nagraj. While some of them
live in his body just cause they have no better place to live, others live willingly to learn something from Nagraj's way of
life. Most notable names among them are :
* Saudaangi : Saudaangi is the most famous and most notable Ichchhadhari nag inside Nagraj's body. Also she was the very first special snake induced by Nagraj in his body. She is the member of an Egyptian clan of snakes which fights against the evil mummy of pharaoh Tutankhemun. Like Nagfani snakes she too has spikes on her body when she is in her snake form,she also has a limited knowledge of Tantra. Among the trio of Sheetnag kumar, Naagu and her, her powers are least explained. In early issues of Nagraj, she often became the decisive force of the fights between Nagraj and his powerful enemies, particularly Nagdant. Though she does not appear as frequently as earlier, she still has a devoted fan following with some urging that she should be the main love interest of Nagraj.
* Sheetnag kumar : Sheetnag-kumar is now the most frequently appearing ichchhadhari sarp of Nagraj's body. Earlier a rival Sheetnag-kumar has now become one of Nagraj's most trusted snakes. He belongs to a clan of ichchhadhari nags living on the Himayalas. Sheetnag-kumar is known for his "icy powers", he can create and manipulate ice at his will giving it different forms like spears and arrows. Sheetnag-kumar also regulates Nagraj's body temperature making him immune to normal fire when he is inside his body and also giving him protection against severe cold ; one of Nagraj's greatest weakness which makes him drowzy pushing him towards hibernation . Sheetnag-kumar's Fang can absorb many attacks and revert them back towards the enemy. He can also freeze all the liquids inside one's body paralysing him.
* Naagu : Naagu is the most cheerful and comical among Nagraj's snakes. His acts are such that at times it becomes difficult to judge whether he is a jester or a helper. He belongs to a family of Ichchhadhaari naags living near Mahanagar.
His main source of power is his mani which grants him almost every imaginable power. For entering Nagraj's body he
has to remove his mani from his possession so he hides it in micro form at some place in Nagraj's dress. He though
looks and behaves like an idiot and talks non-sense, but he is the one who can never be underestimated. Unlike other snakes in Nagraj's body, Naagu decided to live in Nagraj's body for no reason other than watching movies, which becomes easier living in
city. He is a true movie lover and remembers all dialogues of his favourite movies be it Bollywood or Hollywood.
* Sukshm-sarp: This is not a type but a state of the snakes living in Nagraj's body. Nagraj's snakes live in his body in form of Sukshm-sarps, or "micro-snakes". In this state the snakes of Nagraj's body can do anything which they could while in their maximized state, and just their size is affected. They carry out many important activities inside and even outside Nagraj's body. While in Nagraj's body they performs functions like healing his body, fighting against diseases and providing him superhuman strength. They have also been used to cure others of their diseases.
* Nagraj once used one of his powerful snakes Nagshri in Nagdant's body to kill all the micro-snakes inside him making him powerless temporarily.
* He also used them to temporary disable Karanvashi's hypnotic powers.
* Nagraj sent one of his sukhsham-sarp to live inside shakti's body to contact her in case of an emergency.
* Nagraj used one of his dhwansak-sarp in sukhsham roop (micro form) to destroy the brain of a terrorist recently in WTSSeries.

Nagraj's Venom&lt;br /&gt;
Nagraj's venom is the most powerful venom of the world, so much so that direct contact with it results in instant death
and melting of body. He gained his venom through the blessings of snake deity Deva Kaaljayi, who himself was blessed
by Lord Shiva. It is explained that Lord Shiva who holds the strongest venom of the universe synthesised during
Samudra-Manthan, gave a minor portion of it to Deva Kaljayi who holds a dilute form of it and Nagraj holds an even more
dilute form of it. The different ways in which Nagraj uses his venom also results in various powers he is said to possess.
Like :
Vish-funkar
Nagraj uses his breath to force out his venom in vapour form, depending upon its concentration the
vish-funkar can cause a variety of damages to his enemies. Its effects include temporary blindness, drowzyness, black
outs, deaths and for once it even caused fire. This power of Nagraj once as a side-effect temporarily cured Richa (love
interest of Super Commando Dhruva) of her disease pertaining respiratory system. This is among one of the oldest
displayed powers of Nagraj.

&lt;br /&gt;Vish-dansh
:This is simply a snake-bite. Since Nagraj has divine venom more often than not this power when executed properly
results in an opponent's instant death,[1] though exceptional beings able to withstand the poison
include the Deva Kaljayi, himself and enemies who didn't have a biological body. It was suggested in one issue
that the venom inside Nagraj's teeth is far more vicious than the venom in his blood, perhaps so much so that
Nagraj might die if he bites himself.

&lt;br /&gt;Vish-fuhaar
:Nagraj can spill out high amount of liquid venom from his mouth. Since liquid form is much more concentrated in
comparison to vapour form therefore it causes more damage in comparison to vish-funkar, it is said that use of this power
has negative effects on Nagraj weakening him temporarily cause it results in sudden drop of venom inside his body
decreasing the number of sukhsham-sarps too.

&lt;br /&gt;Vish-varsha
:This is one of the lesser known applications of Nagraj's venom. Nagraj once under the influence of evil powers spilled his venom as vish-fuhaar over the ocean and heated it using his dhwansak-sarp forming venomous clouds, the clouds
rained a very dilute form of his venom which was still extremely powerful. Whosoever came in contact with it died
instantly and their bodies melted. After the clouds cleared there were many human skeletons lying at various places as a
proof of the viciousness of Nagraj's venom.

&lt;br /&gt;'''Ichchhadhaari Shakti and its origin'''
:According to the comic storyline inspired from a popular puranic storyline which has many alternate versions,
Vishwamitra a king who turned into a Rishi and wished to become a Brahmarshi (which he later became) once promised
his disciple Trishanku to send him to heaven alive with his body. This alarmed the Gods who to protect the rules of the
universe decided not to let this happen. When Rishi Vishwamitra applied his power to send him towards heaven, the
Gods applied counter-force to oppose him. This resulted in a stalemate. Despite all his efforts Vishwamitra failed to fulfil
his promise. This enraged Vishwamitra, he saw this act of the Gods as his insult, so he used his power to call upon the
power which was used for the creation of the Universe. He started creating a new heaven for sending Trishanku there to
keep his words. Seeing the powers of the rishi and alarmed by his act the gods themselves descended upon earth and
convinced him to drop his decision. Vishwamitra after realizing that Trishanku had evil intentions left him hanging. (It is
believed that he is still hanging somewhere between heaven and earth alive cause Vishwamitra gave him half of his
powers).
Vishwamitra called upon the power himself, but he couldn't send it back so he entrusted this power to his disciple,
a snake Mahatma Kaaldoot. Minor portions of the power passed on to his future generations and resulted in a new
species of snakes the Ichchhadhari naags (shape-shifting snakes). Most of the snakes don't know all the uses of
this power and used it only for shape-shifting purposes but this power can do anything, even creating living beings.
It is least used but most effective power of Nagraj, celestial as its origin is this power's true extent was unknown to
everyone for quite a long time. Since Nagraj had lost a very major part of this power
courtsey See Through, he doesn't try stupid stunts and makes minimum use of this power cause if he tries shapeshifting
into something beyond his power limit then he might not be able to reform a new body and left bodiless like See
Through or maybe even die.
Applications of this power:
&lt;br /&gt;Shape-shifting
:Nagraj even when limited on power has been seen successfully switching between his real and snake form. He can use this power to divide his body into particles and rejoin them within 3 seconds making him invisible and intangible temporarily. At times in case of emergencies Nagraj has temporarily taken powers from the ichchhadhaari naags of Nagdweep granting him access to use the full extent of this power. Nagraj also has a number of ichchhadhaari naags in his body, and though he hasn't yet, he can take their powers too, in times of emergency. Nagraj when high on this power can undergo amazing transformations and can change into anything imaginable. In theory, this power has no limits.
&lt;br /&gt;Hypnotism
:Nagraj has a unique hypnotic effect, formerly considered a separate power, this power was later explained as an
application of his ichchhadhaari shakti. Utilizing this power Nagraj can cast a hypnotic reality upon his surroundings using
his eyes.[1] Breaking this hypnotic fate is extremely difficult and going against it is impossible. Nagraj
and his snakes can cast normal hypnotism too.
&lt;br /&gt;Body-fusions
:Nagraj at times has used this power to fuse with his allies to bring down a powerful enemy. He can perform two types of
fusions :
* Multi-membered imperfect fusion : In this type of fusion many people can join together to form a single body having
many heads and hands. Every individual retains his or her own identity and set of powers. Nagraj used it for the first time
fusing with the legendary five in order to fight against a creature created by Nagina .
* Two-membered perfect fusion : In this type of fusion Nagraj can join together with a single person to form a whole new
identity. The new identity has new set of powers born from the combination of the participants' sets of powers. Nagraj
displayed this power for the first time fusing with Lava to become Agni-Nagraj (Fire-Nagraj). The new born identity could
release 'burning snakes' and could breathe 'venomous fire'.
Psychic powers
&lt;br /&gt;Telepathy
In addition to his ability to communicate with snakes, Nagraj contacted Super Commando Dhruva telepathically when he
was trapped in a parallel dimension containing evil souls.
&lt;br /&gt;Psychic force
:In the debutant issue of Nagraj, after his introduction Professor Nagmani said : This later proved to be true, when Nagraj
achieved the feat using his ichchhadhaari shakti. Though the latter claim has not been substantiated, Nagraj's psychic
potential has been demonstrated during his battle with the Mahamanav (an advanced creature having enough psychic
capabilities to wipe out entire planets) in a psychic power battle.
* Nagraj's primary power is his ability to contain millions of snakes inside his body, becoming a host for a variety of snakes. He can order them to come out of his body and attack his opponents, and also instruct them to create simple forms, such as ropes, lassos, webs, gloves, pipes, etc., as well as complex forms, such as a parachute, boat, gliders, and many others.
* Aside from ordinary snakes, he also has a wide variety of mystical snakes like Jagmag Sarp, snakes with bodies that shine brightly in the dark, Naagfani Sarp, snakes with stretchable, spike-covered bodies, which can pierce through anything and elongate themselves as well, Dhwansak Sarp, explosive snakes which explodes as soon as their body come in contact with anything, Maanas Sarp, psionic snakes which enable Nagraj to split his astral psyche from his body, Udan Sarp, winged snakes which can fly, among others. These snakes multiply rapidly, thus making them limitless in numbers.
* He also hosts several Icchadhari Sarp, shape-shifting snakes, in his body, such as Sheetnaag Kumar, The Prince of Sheetnaags, who has the ability to manipulate ice, Saudangi, an Egyptian snake woman who is a master of Tantra-Kala, or sorcery, Naagu, a Manidhhari snake, which is a snake with a diamond like gem on his forehead, whose 'Mani' grants him powers such as shape-shifting, illusion-casting, energy-based attacks, etc., and the Vilakshana Naags. These snakes can come out of his body at will and aid him in battles.
* Nagraj's body holds the most dangerous venom and thus his bite is fatal to almost every human being and Naags in this world. Anyone he bites, or vice versa, melts to nothing in a few seconds. His breath also consists of some amount of this venom, thus enabling Nagraj to concentrate all this venom into his one breath, which he calls Vish-Funkaar, which results in a quick death for anyone who inhales it. He can also spit this venom on others, which he uses in his Vish-Funkaar, which is equally dangerous and fatal. This venom is combined in his blood, thus anyone who tastes his blood die almost instantly.
* All of Nagraj's physical attributes have reached super-human level, and his strength, stamina, durability, agility, reflexes, and speed are far beyond the peak human level.
* He also has accelerated healing factor, which heals any wounds almost instantly, thanks to the millions of snakes in his body who aid in the healing. Thus guns, swords, blades, etc. are useless against him.
* All of his primary senses have been enhanced to super-human level, which makes his eyesight and hearing far better than any human. He can also sense vibrations in the environment, thus allowing him to navigate and combat even without using his eyesight. He also has a sixth-sense, which he uses if his other five senses are not of much help. Being a highly poisonous human-snake (He refuses to be called a snake-man), poisons and drugs have absolutely no effect on him, making him immune to them.
* Being an [[Ichchhadhari Nag|Ichchhadhari]], he has shape-shifting abilities and can shape-shift into any creature or person he desires. He can also use this power to grow wings, claws, as well as fins on his body for better navigation and combat. Thanks to his shape-shifting abilities, he can grow his size and proportional strength to even higher levels. Although he lost many of his shape-shifting powers during the events of the issue "Icchadhari", still he retains his ability to turn into a snake at will. He can also use his Icchadhari shakti to break free his atoms, rendering himself invisible and intangible, to dodge attacks and pass through barriers, though he can only remain in this form for three seconds. His Icchadhari shakti also protects his head from any assaults and attacks, thus any telepathic or electromagnetic attack on his brain backfires on the source.
* Nagraj possesses the ability to shed his skin, in the same way as a snake sheds its Kenchuli, in case some harmful substance, like acid, comes in contact with his skin.
* Nagraj can also stick to surfaces and climb walls in a way some snakes do.
* He is a master of hypnotism and can hypnotise anyone in a matter of seconds, to cast illusions and force the victims into believing or obeying whatever he tells them.
* Nagraj has reached a level of strength considered superhuman. He can easily hold a car or throw a bus in air without a problem, as seen in his comic "Venom" in which he was badly injured, having most of his bones broken, but to save the people from a fire dragon, he managed to lift up a 100 tones kilogram globe and threw it into the mouth of the fire dragon, which was flying 100&amp;nbsp;meters above the ground.
* Nagraj also possess some unknown amount of psychic powers which is very dangerous and he can increase his psychic powers with the help of his snake.Recently in Sarvanayak series Nagraj with the help of Parmanu created a micro blackhole poweful enough to hold back several dwarf planets.

== New media ==

Numerous attempts have been made by Raj Comics to expand Nagraj into other media. However most attempts have been unfruitful.
In the late 1990s, Raj Comics tried adapting Nagraj into a live-action television show in India. A few episodes were shot. However, the show never made it to the television screen. The reason cited was the poor quality of the special effects. Raj Comics was not satisfied with the quality of the show. The production of more episodes was placed on indefinite hiatus.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} The three episodes that were made are available on CDs, which were distributed freely as an attachment to [[digest-sized]] comic editions. (Khalnayak Nagraj, Samraat, and Saudangi)

Nagraj was also set to feature in a proposed animated television series. Once again the show never made it to the television screen. An episodic series was in works, and a teaser was uploaded on YouTube featuring Nagraj and his arch enemy [[Jadugar Shakoora]]. However, since then there has been no news about the series. It is assumed that production has stopped because the production company [[Rtoonz]]'s website has since disappeared.

In November 2007, an agreement was signed between Motion Picture Corporation and Raj Comics to produce a high quality 2D Movie featuring Nagraj.

== Published series ==

=== Nagayana ===
Raj Comics is publishing a landmark new series featuring Nagraj named Nagayana. It was first intended to be a four-part mini-series, but later, the series was extended to include more issues. Raj Comics has also decided to publish it worldwide. It's a story based on a hypothetical future world casting Nagraj and [[Super Commando Dhruva]] 25 years into the future. Largely based on Hindu epic [[Ramayana]], the story narrowly follows the same storyline as of the epic, but with Raj Comics characters filling in the places of original characters. The reason for the extension of the mini-series was to tell various sub-plots and the series was finally declared to be an eight-part series. The last part is Iti Kaand, which is a 128-page issue released on 10 March 2009. The new series is as follows:

=== Nagraj Ke Baad Series ===

'''Nagraj ke Baad''' (After Nagraj) is a three-part series (Nagraj Ke Baad, Fuel, and Vinom) starting with a comic of the same name. It deals with a time when Nagraj is killed by his enemies and now the world is facing serious threats from the villains.

== Nagraj Parallel Series ==

These days Raj Comics have published three parallel series of Nagraj, where each Nagraj is involved in a different universe. There are the following three parallel Nagraj series:

Nagraj – The original ongoing series of Nagraj, which is being illustrated and written by Mr. [[Anupam Sinha]].

[[Aatankharta Nagraj]]– This Nagraj appears in the World Terrorism series. In the series, Nagraj no longer resides in Mahanagar. but instead, is travelling in different parts of the world fighting terrorism. This series, until now, has not portrayed villains with supernatural powers, but are more like gangsters or dons of different countries/cities. It is illustrated by Mr. Hemant and written by Mr. [[Nitin Mishra]].

[[Narak Nashak Nagraj]] – This Nagraj is a bit different from the original Nagraj in appearance. He wears a jacket and a trouser and has longer hair. He also possesses different powers (Sheetika, Takshika, and Agnika) than the original Nagraj. He also rides on a flying snake named Sarpat. Until now, the series has shown him fighting vampires, demons, zombies, etc. It is illustrated by Mr. Hemant and written by Mr. [[Nitin Mishra]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28866">A '''nocebo effect''' is said to occur when negative expectations of the patient regarding a treatment cause the treatment to have a more negative effect than it otherwise would have.{{sfn|Hauser|Hansen|Enck|2012}}{{sfn|Enck|Häuser|2012}} For example, when a patient anticipates a side effect of a medication, they can suffer that effect even if the "medication" is actually an inert substance.{{sfn|Hauser|Hansen|Enck|2012}} Both placebo and nocebo effects are presumably [[wikt:psychogenic|psychogenic]], but they can induce measurable changes in the body.{{sfn|Hauser|Hansen|Enck|2012}}{{sfn|Beauregard|2012|p={{pn|date=November 2018}}}}  One article that reviewed 31 studies on nocebo effects reported a wide range of symptoms that could manifest as nocebo effects including nausea, stomach pains, itching, bloating, depression, sleep problems, loss of appetite, sexual dysfunction and severe [[hypotension]].{{sfn|Hauser|Hansen|Enck|2012}} Mental states such as beliefs and expectations can strongly influence the outcome of disease, the experience of pain, and even success of surgery.{{sfn|Beauregard|2012|p={{pn|date=November 2018}}}} The complementary concept, the ''[[placebo]]'' effect, is said to occur when positive expectations improve an outcome.

==Etymology and usage==
The term ''nocebo'' ([[Latin language|Latin]] ''[[wikt:en:nocebo#Latin|nocēbō]]'', "I shall harm", from ''[[wikt:en:noceo#Latin|noceō]]'', "I harm")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nocebo|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|title=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary}} {{L&amp;S|noceo|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; was coined by Walter Kennedy in 1961 to denote the counterpart to the use of ''placebo'' (Latin ''[[wikt:en:placebo#Latin|placēbō]]'', "I shall please", from ''[[wikt:en:placeo#Latin|placeō]]'', "I please";&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|placebo}} {{L&amp;S|placeo|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; a substance that may produce a beneficial, healthful, pleasant, or desirable effect). Kennedy emphasized that his use of the term "nocebo" refers strictly to a subject-centered response, a quality inherent in the patient rather than in the remedy".{{sfn|Kennedy|1961}} That is, Kennedy rejected the use of the term for pharmacologically induced  negative [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]] such as the [[ringing in the ears]] caused by [[quinine]].{{sfn|Kennedy|1961}} That is not to say that the patient's psychologically induced response may not include physiological effects. For example, an expectation of pain may induce anxiety, which in turn causes the release of [[cholecystokinin]], which facilitates pain transmission.{{sfn|Benedetti|Lanotte|Lopiano|Colloca|2007}}

==Response==
In the narrowest sense, a '''nocebo response''' occurs when a drug-trial subject's symptoms are worsened by the administration of an inert, sham,{{sfn|Miller|2003}} or dummy ([[simulator]]) treatment, called a [[placebo]]. According to current [[pharmacological]] knowledge and the current understanding of [[Causality|cause and effect]], a placebo contains no chemical (or any other agent) that could possibly ''cause'' any of the observed worsening in the subject's symptoms. Thus, any change for the worse must be due to some subjective factor. Adverse expectations can also cause the [[analgesic]] effects of [[anesthetic]] medications to disappear.{{sfn|Bingel|Wanigasekera|Wiech|Ni Mhuircheartaigh|2011}}

The worsening of the subject's symptoms or reduction of beneficial effects is a direct consequence of their exposure to the placebo, but those symptoms have not been chemically generated by the placebo. Because this generation of symptoms entails a complex of "subject-internal" activities, in the strictest sense, we can never speak in terms of simulator-centered "nocebo effects", but only in terms of subject-centered "nocebo responses". Although some observers attribute nocebo responses (or placebo responses) to a subject's [[gullibility]], there is no evidence  that an individual who manifests a nocebo/placebo response to one treatment will manifest a nocebo/placebo response to any other treatment; i.e., there is no fixed nocebo/placebo-responding trait or propensity.

McGlashan, Evans &amp; Orne (1969, p.&amp;nbsp;319) found no evidence of what they termed a "placebo personality". Also, in a carefully designed study, Lasagna, Mosteller, von Felsinger and Beecher (1954), found that there was no way that any observer could determine, by testing or by interview, which subject would manifest a placebo reaction and which would not. Experiments have shown that no relationship exists between an individual's measured [[hypnotic susceptibility]] and their manifestation of nocebo or placebo responses.{{sfn|McGlashan|Evans|Orne|1969}}{{sfn|Stam|1984}}{{sfn|Stam|Spanos|1987}}

==Effects==

===Side effects of drugs===
It has been shown that, due to the nocebo effect, warning patients about side effects of drugs can contribute to the causation of such effects, whether the drug is real or not.{{sfn|Colloca|Miller|2011}}{{sfn|Barsky|Saintfort|Rogers|Borus|2002}} This effect has been observed in clinical trials: according to a 2013 review, the dropout rate among placebo-treated patients in a meta-analysis of 41 clinical trials of [[Parkinson's disease]] treatments was 8.8%.{{sfn|Stathis|Smpiliris|Konitsiotis|Mitsikostas|2013}} A 2013 review found that nearly 1 out of 20 patients receiving a placebo in clinical trials for depression dropped out due to adverse events, which were believed to have been caused by the nocebo effect.{{sfn|Mitsikostas|Mantonakis|Chalarakis|2014}}

===Electromagnetic hypersensitivity===
Evidence suggests that the symptoms of [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]] are caused by the nocebo effect.{{sfn|Rubin|Nieto-Hernandez|Wessely|2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2010-02/disconnected | title=The Man Who Was Allergic to Radio Waves | work=Popular Science | date=4 March 2010 | accessdate=1 December 2014 | author=Geary, James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pain===
Verbal suggestion can cause [[hyperalgesia]] (increased sensitivity to pain) and [[allodynia]] (perception of a tactile stimulus as painful) as a result of the nocebo effect.{{sfn|Murray|Stoessl|2013}} Nocebo hyperalgesia is believed to involve the activation of [[cholecystokinin]] receptors.{{sfn|Enck|Benedetti|Schedlowski|2008}}

==Ambiguity of medical usage==
Stewart-Williams and Podd argue that using the contrasting terms "placebo" and "nocebo" to label inert agents that produce pleasant, health-improving, or desirable outcomes versus unpleasant, health-diminishing, or undesirable outcomes (respectively), is extremely counterproductive.{{sfn|Stewart-Williams|Podd|2004}} For example, precisely the same inert agents can produce [[analgesia]] and [[hyperalgesia]], the first of which, from this definition, would be a placebo, and the second a nocebo.{{sfn|Colloca|Benedetti|2007}}

A second problem is that  the same effect, such as [[immunosuppression]], may be  desirable for a subject with an [[autoimmune disorder]], but be  undesirable for most other subjects. Thus, in the first case, the effect would be a placebo, and in the second, a nocebo.{{sfn|Stewart-Williams|Podd|2004}} A third problem is that the prescriber does not know whether the relevant subjects consider the effects that they experience to be  desirable or undesirable until some time after the drugs have been administered.{{sfn|Stewart-Williams|Podd|2004}} A fourth problem is that the same [[phenomena]] are being generated in all  the subjects, and these are being generated by  the same drug, which is acting in all of the subjects through  the same mechanism. Yet because the phenomena in question have been subjectively considered to be desirable to one group but not the other, the phenomena are now being labelled in two [[mutually exclusive]] ways (i.e., placebo and nocebo); and this is giving the false impression that the drug in question has produced two different phenomena.{{sfn|Stewart-Williams|Podd|2004}}

==Ambiguity of anthropological usage==
Some people maintain that belief kills (e.g., "[[voodoo death]]": Cannon (1942) describes a number of instances from a variety of different cultures) and belief heals (e.g., [[faith healing]]). A "self-willed" death (due to voodoo [[curse|hex]], [[evil eye]], [[Kurdaitcha|pointing the bone]] procedure,{{sfn|Zusne|Jones|1989|p=57}}{{sfn|Róheim|1925}} etc.) is an extreme form of a [[culture-specific syndrome]] or [[mass psychogenic illness]] that produces a particular form of [[psychosomatic]] or [[psychophysiological]] disorder which results in a psychogenic death. Rubel (1964) spoke of "culture bound" syndromes, which were those "from which members of a particular group claim to suffer and for which their culture provides an etiology, diagnosis, preventive measures, and regimens of healing".{{sfn|Rubel|1964}}

Certain anthropologists, such as Robert Hahn and [[Arthur Kleinman]], have extended the placebo/nocebo distinction into this realm in order to allow a distinction to be made between rituals, like faith healing, that are performed in order to heal, cure, or bring benefit (placebo rituals) and others, like "pointing the bone", that are performed in order to kill, injure or bring harm (nocebo rituals). As the meaning of the two inter-related and opposing terms has extended, we now find anthropologists speaking, in various contexts, of nocebo or placebo (harmful or helpful) rituals:
* that might entail nocebo or placebo (unpleasant or pleasant) procedures;
* about which subjects might have nocebo or placebo (harmful or beneficial) beliefs;
* that are delivered by operators that might have nocebo or placebo (pathogenic, disease-generating or salutogenic, health-promoting) expectations;
* that are delivered to subjects that might have nocebo or placebo (negative, fearful, despairing or positive, hopeful, confident) expectations about the ritual;
* which are delivered by operators who might have nocebo or placebo (malevolent or benevolent) intentions, in the hope that the rituals will generate nocebo or placebo (lethal, injurious, harmful or restorative, curative, healthy) outcomes; and, that all of this depends upon the operator's overall beliefs in the harmful nature of the nocebo ritual or the beneficial nature of the placebo ritual.

Yet, it may become even more terminologically complex; for, as Hahn and Kleinman indicate, there can also be cases where there are [[paradoxical]] nocebo outcomes from placebo rituals (e.g. the [[TGN1412]] drug trial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8852-new-drug-trial-puts-six-men-in-intensive-care/ |title=New drug trial puts six men in intensive care |newspaper=New Scientist |agency=AFP |date=15 March 2006 |accessdate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8863-catastrophic-immune-response-may-have-caused-drug-trial-horror/ |title=Catastrophic immune response may have caused drug trial horror |newspaper=New Scientist |date=17 March 2006 |first1=Shaoni |last1=Bhattacharya |first2=Andy |last2=Coghlan }}&lt;/ref&gt;), as well as paradoxical placebo outcomes from nocebo rituals (see also [[unintended consequence]]s). Writing from his extensive experience of treating cancer (including more than 1,000 [[melanoma]] cases) at [[Sydney Hospital]], Milton (1973) warned of the impact of the delivery of a [[prognosis]], and how many of his patients, upon receiving their prognosis, simply turned their face to the wall and died a premature death: "there is a small group of patients in whom the realization of impending death is a blow so terrible that they are quite unable to adjust to it, and they die rapidly before the [[malignancy]] seems to have developed enough to cause death. This problem of self-willed death is in some ways analogous to the death produced in primitive peoples by witchcraft ('pointing the bone')".{{sfn|Milton|1973}}

{{globalize/US|date=November 2017}}
'''Obstetrics and gynecology''' (commonly abbreviated as '''OB-GYN''', '''OBG''' or '''O&amp;G''' in US English, and as '''obs and gyne''' in British English) is the [[medical specialty]] that encompasses the two subspecialties of [[obstetrics]] (covering [[pregnancy]], [[childbirth]], and the [[postpartum period]]) and [[gynecology]] (covering the health of the [[female reproductive system]]s  – [[vagina]], [[uterus]], and [[ovaries]]).

Postgraduate training programs for both fields are usually combined, preparing the practicing obstetrician-gynecologist to be adept both at the care of female reproductive organs' health and at the management of pregnancy, although many doctors go on to develop subspecialty interests in one field or the other.

==Education and training (residency)==
===United States===
After completing medical school, one must complete a four-year residency program to be eligible to sit for boards.

For the ERAS match in 2017, there will be 238 participating programs accepting applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://services.aamc.org/eras/erasstats/par/display8.cfm?NAV_ROW=PAR&amp;SPEC_CD=220|title=ERAS 2017 Participating Specialties &amp; Programs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In all, this adds up to 11–14 years of education and practical experience. The first 7–9 years are general medical training.

Experienced OB-GYN professionals can seek certifications in sub-specialty areas, including maternal and fetal medicine. See [[Fellowship (medicine)]].

==Subspecialties==
Examples of subspecialty training available to physicians in the US are:

* [[Maternal-fetal medicine]]: an [[Obstetrics|obstetrical]] subspecialty, sometimes referred to as perinatology, that focuses on the medical and surgical management of high-risk pregnancies and surgery on the fetus with the goal of reducing morbidity and mortality.
* [[Reproductive endocrinology and infertility]]: a subspecialty that focuses on the biological causes and interventional treatment of infertility
* Gynecological oncology: a gynaecologic subspecialty focusing on the medical and surgical treatment of women with [[cancers]] of the reproductive organs
* [[urogynecology|Female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery]]: a gynaecologic subspecialty focusing on the diagnosis and surgical treatment of women with [[urinary incontinence]] and [[prolapse]] of the pelvic organs. Sometimes referred to by laypersons as "[[female urology]]"
* Advanced [[Laparoscopy|laparoscopic surgery]]
* [[Family planning]]: a gynaecologic subspecialty offering training in [[contraception]] and pregnancy termination ([[abortion]])
* Pediatric and adolescent gynecology
* [[Menopause|Menopausal]] and [[Geriatrics|geriatric]] gynecology

Of these, only the first four are truly recognized sub-specialties by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ABOG). The other subspecialties are recognized as informal concentrations of practice. To be recognized as a board-certified subspecialist by the [[American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology]] or the [[American Osteopathic Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology]], a practitioner must have completed an [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education|ACGME]] or [[American Osteopathic Association|AOA]]-accredited residency and obtained a Certificate of Added Qualifications (CAQ) which requires an additional standardized examination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abog.org Welcome to the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology Web Site: Certification of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aobog.org/pages/eligibility |title=Eligibility/Board Eligibility |date=2012 |publisher=American Osteopathic Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology |accessdate=19 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, physicians of other specialties may become trained in [[Advanced Life Support in Obstetrics]] (ALSO), a short certification that equips them to better manage emergent OB/GYN situations.

==Salary==
The salary of an obstetrician varies by country. In the United States, as of 2017, the average salary is $222,400–$315,277.

Application of linear regression procedures for method comparison studies in Clinical Chemistry, Part I |journal=Journal of Clinical Chemistry &amp; Clinical Biochemistry |volume=21 | year=1983 |pages=709–20 |pmid=6655447 |doi=10.1515/cclm.1983.21.11.709}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="biliczulle2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bilić-Zulle L|title=Comparison of methods: Passing and Bablok regression |journal=Biochem Med |volume=21 | year=2011 |pages=49–52 |doi=10.11613/BM.2011.010 |pmid=22141206 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The procedure is symmetrical and is robust in the presence of one or few outliers. 
The Passing-Bablok procedure fits the parameters a and b of the linear equation y = a + b x using non-parametric methods. The coefficient b is calculated by taking the shifted median of all slopes of the straight lines between any two points, disregarding lines for which the points are identical or b = -1.  The median is shifted based on the number of slopes where b &lt; -1 to create an unbiased estimator. The parameter a is calculated by a = median { y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; - b x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; }. Passing and Bablok define a method for calculating a 95% confidence interval for both a and b in their original paper,&lt;ref name="PB1983" /&gt; though bootstrapping the parameters is the preferred method for in vitro diagnostics (IVD) when using patient samples.&lt;ref name="EP09A3"&gt;{{cite book|title=EP09-A3: Measurement Procedure Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples; Approved Guideline|date=August 30, 2013|publisher=CLSI|isbn=1-56238-888-6|edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Passing-Bablok procedure is valid only when a linear relationship exist between x and y, which can be assessed by a cusum test.&lt;ref name="PB1983"/&gt;

The results are interpreted as follows. If 0 is in the CI of a, and 1 is in the CI of b, the two methods are comparable within the investigated concentration range. If 0 is not in the CI of a there is a systematic difference and if 1 is not in the CI of b then there is a proportional difference between the two methods. 

However, the use of Passing-Bablok regression in method comparison studies has been criticized because it ignores random differences between methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.medcalc.org/manual/note-passingbablok.php |title=A note on Passing-Bablok regression |publisher=MedCalc Software bvba |access-date=19 October 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4257">The '''Personal Protective Equipment at Work Regulations 1992''' are a set of regulations created under the [[Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974]] which came into force in Great Britain on 1 January 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1992/2966/introduction/made Legislation.gov - PPE regs introductory page]&lt;/ref&gt;  The regulations place a duty on every employer to ensure that suitable personal protective equipment is provided to employees who may be exposed to a risk to their health or safety while at work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1992/2966/regulation/4/made Legislation.gov - Provision of PPE regulation 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal Protective Equipment==
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is defined in the regulations as "all equipment (including clothing affording protection against the weather) which is intended to be worn or held by a person at work which protects them against one or more risks to their health and safety".  PPE would include such things as hard hats, eye protection, safety harnesses, life jackets and safety footwear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthyworkinglives.com/advice/minimising-workplace-risks/ppe.aspx#what Healthy working lives - What is PPE?]&lt;/ref&gt;  The regulations however do not apply where requirements for PPE are detailed in other regulations, these include the:

*Control of lead at Work Regulations 2002,
*[[Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999]] 
*[[Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006]] 
*[[COSHH|Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 2002]] 
*Construction (Head Protection) Regulations 1989 
*[[The Control of Noise at Work regulations 2005]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthyworkinglives.com/advice/minimising-workplace-risks/ppe.aspx#legal HSE - A short guide to PPE, legal duties and obligations, page 4]&lt;/ref&gt;  

The [[Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974]] also states that employers are not allowed to charge for any PPE that is used for work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/contact/faqs/ppe.htm HSE - Do employers have to provide Personal Protective Equipment?]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other requirements===
The Regulations also impose requirements with respect to—
*compatibility of items of personal protective equipment where it is necessary to wear or use more than one item simultaneously. 
*the making, review and changing of assessments in relation to the choice of personal protective equipment.
*the maintenance (including replacement and cleaning as appropriate) of personal protective equipment.
*the provision of accommodation for personal protective equipment.
*the provision of information, instruction and training.
*ensuring personal protective equipment is used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1992/2966/note/made Legislation.gov - Explanatory note]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecutions arising from the regulations== 
On 25 June 2008 a moulding company in Leicester was fined £5,300 and ordered to pay £2,134.10 after an employee suffered serious burns after he removed a mould plug during a routine operation at Harrison Castings Ltd.  The burns required several skin grafts and five days in hospital for the employee.&lt;ref name="press release"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Inspector Munera Sidat said that the accident could have been prevented had the company provided the right type of gloves saying "Instead of foundry gloves which provide heat resistance, he was wearing rigger gloves which offered him very little protection. Not only did the molten metal permeate straight through the material, but the gloves were also so short that the liquid went up his jacket sleeves, making his burns worse."&lt;ref name="press release"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;   The company was charged under regulation 6 of the regulations which states that an assessment of the PPE provided should be made to ensure that it is suitable for the task". &lt;ref name="press release"&gt; [http://www.hse.gov.uk/press/2008/gnnem25808.htm HSE - Leicester company prosecuted after incident left employee burnt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311170809/http://www.hse.gov.uk/press/2008/gnnem25808.htm |date=2011-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SDTM''' ('''Study Data Tabulation Model''') defines a standard structure for [[human]] clinical trial (study) data tabulations and for nonclinical study data tabulations that are to be submitted as part of a product application to a regulatory authority such as the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration|United States Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). The Submission Data Standards team of [[Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium]] (CDISC) defines SDTM.

On '''July 21, 2004''', SDTM was selected as the standard specification for submitting tabulation data to the FDA for clinical trials and on July 5, 2011 for nonclinical studies. Eventually, all data submissions will be expected to conform to this format. As a result, clinical and nonclinical Data Managers will need to become proficient in the SDTM to prepare submissions and apply the SDTM structures, where appropriate, for operational data management.

==Background==
SDTM is built around the concept of observations collected about subjects who participated in a clinical study. Each observation can be described by a series of variables, corresponding to a row in a dataset or table. Each variable can be classified according to its Role. A Role determines the type of information conveyed by the variable about each distinct observation and how it can be used. Variables can be classified into four major roles:
* Identifier variables, which identify the study, subject of the observation, the domain, and the sequence number of the record
* Topic variables, which specify the focus of the observation (such as the name of a lab test)
* Timing variables, which describe the timing of the observation (such as start date and end date)
* Qualifier variables, which include additional illustrative text, or numeric values that describe the results or additional traits of the observation (such as units or descriptive adjectives).

A fifth type of variable role, Rule, can express an algorithm or executable method
to define start, end, or looping conditions in the Trial Design model.

The set of Qualifier variables can be further categorized into five sub-classes:
* Grouping Qualifiers are used to group together a collection of observations within the same domain.  Examples include --CAT and --SCAT.
* Result Qualifiers describe the specific results associated with the topic variable for a finding. It is the answer to the question raised by the topic variable. Examples include --ORRES, --STRESC, and --STRESN. Many of the values in the DM domain are also classified as Result Qualifiers.
* Synonym Qualifiers specify an alternative name for a particular variable in an observation. Examples include --MODIFY and --DECOD, which are equivalent terms for a --TRT or --TERM topic variable, --TEST and --LOINC which are equivalent terms for a --TESTCD.
* Record Qualifiers define additional attributes of the observation record as a whole (rather than describing a particular variable within a record). Examples include --REASND, AESLIFE, and all other SAE (serious adverse event) flag variables in the AE domain; and --BLFL, --POS and --LOC, --SPEC, --LOT, --NAM.
* Variable Qualifiers are used to further modify or describe a specific variable within an observation and is only meaningful in the context of the variable they qualify. Examples include --ORRESU, --ORNRHI, and --ORNRLO, all of which are variable qualifiers of --ORRES, and --DOSU and --DOSFRM, all of which are variable qualifiers of --DOSE.

For example, in the observation, 'Subject 101 had mild nausea starting on Study Day 6,' the Topic variable value is the term for the adverse event, 'NAUSEA'. The Identifier variable is the subject identifier, '101'. The Timing variable is the study day of the start of the event, which captures the information, 'starting on Study Day 6', while an example of a Record Qualifier is the severity, the value for which is 'MILD'.

Additional Timing and Qualifier variables could be included to provide the necessary detail to adequately describe an observation.•	The SDTM addition to PROC CDISC does not convert existing SDS 2.x content to SDTM 3.x representations.

==Datasets and domains==

Observations are normally collected for all subjects in a series of domains. A domain is defined as a collection of logically-related observations with a topic-specific commonality about the subjects in the trial. The logic of the relationship may relate to the scientific matter of the data, or to its role in the trial.

Typically, each domain is represented by a dataset, but it is possible to have information relevant to the same topicality spread among multiple datasets. Each dataset is distinguished by a unique, two-character DOMAIN code that should be used consistently throughout the submission. This DOMAIN code is used in the dataset name, the value of the DOMAIN variable within that dataset, and as a prefix for most variable names in the dataset.

The dataset structure for observations is a flat file representing a table with one or more rows and columns. Normally, one dataset is submitted for each domain. Each row of the dataset represents a single observation and each column represents one of the variables. Each dataset or table is accompanied by metadata definitions that provide information about the variables used in the dataset. The metadata are described in a data definition document named 'Define' that is submitted along with the data to regulatory authorities. 

Submission Metadata Model uses seven distinct metadata attributes to be defined for each dataset variable in the metadata definition document:
* The Variable Name (limited to 8-characters for compatibility with the [[SAS System]] V5 Transport format)
* A descriptive Variable Label, using up to 40 characters, which should be unique for each variable in the dataset
* The data Type (e.g., whether the variable value is a character or numeric)
* The set of controlled terminology for the value or the presentation format of the variable(Controlled Terms or Format)
* The Origin or source of each variable
* The Role of the variable, which determines how the variable is used in the dataset. Roles are used to represent the categories of variables as Identifier, Topic, Timing, or the five types of Qualifiers. Since these roles are predefined for all domains that follow the general classes, they do not need to be specified by sponsors in their Define data definition document. Actual submission metadata may use additional role designations, and more than one role may be assigned per variable to meet different needs.
* Comments or other relevant information about the variable or its data.

Data stored in dataset variables include both raw (as originally collected) and derived values (e.g., converted into standard units, or computed on the basis of multiple values, such as an average). In SDTM only the name, label, and type are listed with a set of CDISC guidelines that provide a general description for each variable used by a general observation class. 

Comments are included as necessary according to the needs of individual studies.
The presence of an asterisk (*) in the 'Controlled Terms or Format' column indicates that a discrete set of values (controlled terminology) is expected to be made available for this variable. This set of values may be sponsor-defined in cases where standard vocabularies have not yet been defined (represented by a single *) or from an external published source such as [[MedDRA]] (represented by **).

==Special-purpose domains==
The CDISC Version 3.x Submission Data Domain Models include special-purpose domains with a specific
structure and cannot be extended with any additional qualifier or timing variables other than those specified. 

* Demographics includes a set of standard variables that describe each subject in a clinical study
* Comments describes a fixed structure for recording free-text comments on a subject, or comments related to records or groups of records in other domains.

Additional fixed structure, non-extensible special-purpose domains are discussed in the Trial Design model.

==The general domain classes==

Most observations collected during the study (other than those represented in special purpose domains) should be divided among three general observation classes: Interventions, Events, or Findings:
* The Interventions class captures investigational treatments, therapeutic treatments, and surgical procedures that are intentionally administered to the subject (with some actual or expected physiological effect) either as specified by the study protocol (e.g., “exposure”), coincident with the study assessment period (e.g., “concomitant medications”), or other substances self-administered by the subject (such as alcohol, tobacco, or caffeine)
* The Events class captures occurrences or incidents independent of planned study evaluations occurring during the trial (e.g., 'adverse events' or 'disposition') or prior to the trial (e.g., 'medical history').
* The Findings class captures the observations resulting from planned evaluations to address specific questions such as observations made during a physical examination, laboratory tests, ECG testing, and sets of individual questions listed on questionnaires.

In most cases, the identification of the general class appropriate to a specific collection of data by topicality is straightforward. Often the Findings general class is the best choice for general observational data collected as measurements or responses to questions. In cases when the topicality may not be as clear, the choice of class may be based more on the scientific intent of the protocol or analysis plan or the data structure. 

All datasets based on any of the general observation classes share a set of common Identifier variables and Timing variables. Three general rules apply when determining which
variables to include in a domain:
* The same set of Identifier variables applies to all domains based on the general observation classes. An optional identifier can be used wherever appropriate.
* Any valid Timing variable is permissible for use in any submission dataset (such as to describe studies with more precise time points such as a Pharmacokinetics trial), but it should be used consistently where applicable for all domains.
* Any additional Qualifier variables from the same general class may be added to a domain model.

==Limitations and Criticism of standards==
One criticism of the SDTM standards is that they are continually changing, with new versions released frequently. CDISC claims that SDTM standards are backward compatible. But the claim is unreliable. It is not possible to map the data from EDC DBMS to SDTM standards until the clinical trial completes. New domains, for example the exposure as collected (EC) domain, were added recently. However, backward compatibility with earlier domains is not always possible. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Phuse|first1=2011|title=SDTM Implementation Guide – Clear as Mud|url=http://www.lexjansen.com/phuse/2011/cd/CD02.pdf|website=lex jansen|publisher=PHUSE|accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standards are not reliable, and well evolved. The controlled terminology is a very small subset of National Cancer institute terminology. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=CDISC|first1=Terminology|title=National Cancer Institute|url=http://www.cancer.gov/research/resources/terminology/cdisc|website=cancer.gov|publisher=NIH|accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7385">'''Transitional age youth''' (TAY) are [[youth|young people]] between the ages of sixteen and twenty-four who are in transition from [[Youth detention center|state custody]] or [[foster care]] and are at-risk.  Once they turn 18 they can no longer receive assistance from the systems of care that previously provided for many of their needs.  Like most [[youth|young people]], they are struggling to start out with limited resources and experience. Unlike many, though, they do not have the family resources others take for granted. There is no family to provide them with furniture and dishes for their apartment, to [[Loan guarantee|co-sign a loan]] or guarantee their credit for the [[landlord]], to help pay the [[security deposit]], to guide them through the [[college admissions]] process, or put in a good word for a new job.

== Programs and changes in programs ==
Foster care is and was intended to be a temporary situation for children, however many children entering foster care, 25-30% (Kelly) remain there until the age of 18. According to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], in 2005, of the approximately 500,000 (was 550,000 in 2000) children in the foster care system in the United States, an estimated 24,000 foster youth age out of care each year and attempt to live independently. (Gardner)

Homelessness for youth aging out could be lessened using the [[Chafee Independent Living Program of 1999]]. According to this program states are allowed to use up to 30% of their independent living funds on [[room and board]] for former foster youth who are at least 18 years old but not yet 21. It also requires states to use at least some portion of their funds to provide follow-up services to foster youth after they age out. (Dworsky) The previous program, [[Title IV-E Independent Living Program of 1990]], did not allow the state to use any of its funding for room and board, independent living subsidies, or [[transitional housing]] for youth aging out. (Dworsky)

The [[Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008]] contains several provisions aimed at promoting permanent family connections for youth in foster care. (Dworsky) The following are changes made by the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 to improve the connection between foster youth and extended family members:
* Notice to Relatives When Children Enter Care. Increases opportunities for relatives to step in when children are removed from their parents and placed in foster care by ensuring they get notice of this removal.
* Kinship Navigator Programs. Guarantees funds for [[Kinship Navigator]] programs, through new [[Family Connection grants]], to help connect children living with relatives, both in and out of foster care, with the supports and assistance they need.
* Subsidized Guardianship Payments for Relatives. Helps children in foster care leave care to live permanently with grandparents and other relative guardians when they cannot be returned home or adopted and offers federal support to states to assist with subsidized guardianship payments to families for these children, generally to age 18. In certain circumstances, children may continue to receive guardianship assistance to age 21. Clarifies that all children who, as of September 30, 2008, were receiving federally supported subsidized guardianship payments or services in states with [[Child Welfare Demonstration Waivers]] will be able to continue to receive that assistance and services under the new program. Clarifies that children who leave foster care after age 16 for kinship guardianship are eligible for independent living services and makes them eligible for education and training vouchers.
* Licensing Standards for Relatives. Clarifies that states may waive non-safety related licensing standards for relatives on a case-by-case basis and requires the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS) to report to [[United States Congress|Congress]] on the use of licensing waivers and recommendations for increasing the percentage of relative foster family homes that are licensed.
* New Family Connection Grants. Increases resources for Kinship Navigator programs, as described above. Also provides grants for Family Group Decision-making Meetings, Intensive Family Finding activities, and Residential Family-Based Substance Abuse Treatment, all of which can help children stay safely with family members and out of foster care or, once in care, return safely to their parents or find permanence with other relatives.
* Keeping Siblings Together. Preserves the sibling bond for children by requiring states to make reasonable efforts to place siblings together when they must be removed from their parents’ home, provided it is in the children's best interests. In the case of siblings not placed together, states must make reasonable efforts to provide for frequent visitation or other ongoing interaction, unless such interaction would be harmful to any of the siblings. (Children's Defense Fund)

This Act helps youth who turn 18 in foster care without permanent families to remain in care, at state option, to age 19, 20, or 21 with continued federal support to increase their opportunities for success as they transition to adulthood. (Children's Defense Fund) This Act also assists foster youth with extra support surrounding their education and healthcare needs as the age out.

24,000 youth age out of foster care every year. The majority of them will be dependent on government assistance at some point whether it is for medical care because of the lack of insurance, food assistance because of the lack of income, housing assistance because of the lack of income, or in some cases their children will be in the foster care system perpetuating the foster care cycle. Society as a whole needs to recognize the consequences of foster youth aging out without the education, experience, knowledge, or skills needed to become a successful adult. Changes to the foster care system can be made, but it will take time, patience, endurance, persistence, and ingenuity from not only the workers in the system and the foster youth, but from a society that recognizes the impact foster youth aging out will make on the future.

'''Water supply and sanitation in Japan''' is characterized by numerous achievements and some challenges. The country has achieved universal access to water supply and sanitation; has one of the lowest levels of water distribution losses in the world; regularly exceeds its own strict standards for the quality of drinking water and treated waste water; uses an effective national system of performance [[benchmarking]] for water and sanitation utilities; makes extensive use of both advanced and appropriate technologies such as the ''jōkasō'' on-site sanitation system; and has pioneered the [[payment for ecosystem services]] before the term was even coined internationally. Some of the challenges are a decreasing population, declining investment, fiscal constraints, ageing facilities, an ageing workforce, a fragmentation of service provision among thousands of municipal utilities, and the vulnerability of parts of the country to droughts that are expected to become more frequent due to climate change.

==Access and service quality==
Access to an [[improved water source]] is universal in Japan. 97% of the population receives piped water supply from public utilities and 3% receive water from their own wells or unregulated small systems, mainly in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare:[http://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/policy/health/water_supply/1.html Coverage], retrieved on January 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to [[improved sanitation]] is also universal, either through sewers or on-site sanitation. All collected waste water is treated at secondary-level treatment plants. All effluents discharged to closed or semi-closed water bodies, such as [[Tokyo Bay]], [[Osaka Bay]], or [[Lake Biwa]], are further treated to tertiary level. This applies to about 15% of waste water. The effluent quality is remarkably good at 3–10&amp;nbsp;mg/l of [[Biological Oxygen Demand|BOD]] for secondary-level treatment, well below the national effluent standard of 20&amp;nbsp;mg/l.&lt;ref name="Ueda"/&gt;

==Water resources and the use of water==

===Water resources and climate change===
While Japan is not a water-stressed country per se, water availability varies substantially between years, seasons and regions leading to regular and serious water shortages. On average over the period 1971-2000, water resources in Japan stood at 420 km3 per year. At 3,300m3 per capita this is below the global average. On the Pacific coast where most Japanese live, 70-80% of rainfall occurs during only four months, i.e. the summer monsoon from June to July and the [[typhoon]] season from August to September. On the coast of the [[Sea of Japan]] the winter monsoon brings heavy snowfall from December to February.&lt;ref&gt;[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) Aquastat:[http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/countries/japan/index.stm Japan country profile], Chapter on climate and water resources, 1997, retrieved on January 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; National [[drought]]s occur about every 10 years in Japan, in addition to more frequent regional droughts. During the drought in 1994 the piped water supply of 16 million people had to be restricted. It is expected that the severity of droughts will increase because of [[climate change]] which will reduce the amount of water stored in the form of snow, increase evaporation from reservoirs and reduce rainfall.&lt;ref name="Water resources"&gt;Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport:[http://www.mlit.go.jp/tochimizushigen/mizsei/water_resources/contents/current_state2.html Current state of water resources in Japan], ca. 2006, retrieved on January 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the water for domestic use comes from surface water. About 45% of the total comes from reservoirs regulated by dams, while 27% comes directly from rivers, 1% from lakes and 4% from river beds, totaling 77% from surface water. 23% of domestic water supply comes from groundwater, which is over-exploited in parts of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare:[http://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/policy/health/water_supply/1.html Water Sources], retrieved on January 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Lake biwa.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Lake Biwa, the source of drinking water for 15 million people in the Keihanshin region]]

===Water storage===
While there are more than 2,500 dams in Japan, their total storage is low because rivers are short and steep. Total active storage of all dams is only 20 km3, corresponding to less than the [[Lake Mead|storage capacity]] of [[Hoover Dam]].&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport:[http://www.mlit.go.jp/tochimizushigen/mizsei/water_resources/contents/current_state.html Water Resources Development], ca. 2006, retrieved on January 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, lakes have an important storage function and their water levels are regulated through weirs. The largest lake is [[Lake Biwa]] that provides drinking water to more than 15 million people in the [[Keihanshin]] (Kyoto-Osaka-Kobe) metropolitan region.

===Water use===
[[File:WaterSavingToiletJapan.jpg|thumb|Water saving device on a Japanese toilet: The tank with the water for flushing is refilled through a tap at the top of the tank so that users can wash their hands and recycle the water for flushing]]
Water use is about 83.5 km3, or 20% of water availability in an average year. However, there are large variations in the utilization rate between years and regions. For example, in the coastal part of the [[Kantō region]] that includes Tokyo the utilization rate is over 90% in a dry year. In the relatively dry north of [[Kyushu]] it is more than 50%.&lt;ref name="Current state"&gt;Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport:[http://www.mlit.go.jp/tochimizushigen/mizsei/water_resources/contents/current_state.html Water balance in Japan], ca. 2006, retrieved on January 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Of the total use 55.2 km3 was for agriculture, 16.2 km3 for domestic use and 12.1 km3 for industrial use.&lt;ref name="Water resources"/&gt; Despite the introduction of water-saving devices domestic per capita use declined only slightly from 322 liter per capita per day in 2000 to 314 in 2004.&lt;ref name="Current state"/&gt; Per capita water use thus is slightly lower than in the [[Water supply and sanitation in the United States|United States]] (371 liter in 2005) and more than twice as high as in [[Water supply and sanitation in Germany|Germany]] (122 liter in 2007) or in [[Water supply and sanitation in England|England]] (145 liter in 2009).

===Water quality===
Although drinking water quality and the quality of waste water discharged into open watercourses typically exceed national standards, water quality in rivers and lakes still does not meet environmental standards. For example, the attainment rate of environmental standards was 87% in 2005, but in lakes and marshes it was only 50%.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport:[http://www.mlit.go.jp/tochimizushigen/mizsei/water_resources/contents/issues.html Issues on water resources], ca. 2006, retrieved on January 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infrastructure and technology==

===Water supply===
New water distribution pipes are typically made from [[ductile iron]] and service pipes from [[stainless steel]]. The share of pipes made of these materials increased from 40% for ductile iron and zero for stainless steel in 1980 to 100% for both in 2006. The change in pipe materials is credited as a major factor in reducing water losses to one of the world's lowest levels.&lt;ref name="Waterworks technologies"&gt;Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare:[http://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/policy/health/water_supply/8.html Waterworks technologies in Japan], retrieved on January 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Water treatment is usually through [[Rapid sand filter|rapid sand filtration]] (76%), while 20% of water utilities only disinfect water without additional treatment. Utilities increasingly adopt advanced water treatment methods such as [[activated carbon]], [[ozone]] disinfection and [[air stripping]].&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare:[http://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/policy/health/water_supply/1.html Types of Treatment Plants], retrieved on January 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sanitation===
Concerning sewerage, out of 1,896 systems, 1,873 were separate sewer systems (between [[sanitary sewer]]s and [[storm drain|stormwater sewers]]) and only 23 were [[combined sewer]] systems. In 2002 about 75 million people were connected to sewers and 35 million people had their waste water treated through small-scale waste water treatment devices called ''jōkasōs''. They are common in areas not connected to sewers, but also exist in areas connected to sewers. There is even a specific ''jōkasō'' law that regulates their construction, installation, inspection and desludging. ''Jōkasōs'' use different technologies and serve different sizes of buildings from single-family homes to high-rise buildings, public or commercial buildings. Treated water can be easily reused for various purposes such as toilet flushing, watering gardens or car washing. Sludge from ''jōkasōs'' can be used as fertilizer. The government has a program to subsidize the installation of ''jōkasōs''.&lt;ref&gt;Hiroshi Ogawa:[http://www.env.go.jp/recycle/3r/en/asia/02_06/01.pdf Domestic Wastewater Treatment by Johkasou Systems in Japan], retrieved on January 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It has been attempted to transfer the technology to China and Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;Motoyuki Mizuochi:[http://www.wepa-db.net/pdf/0712forum/paper18.pdf Small-Scale Domestic Wastewater Treatment Technology in Japan, and the Possibility of Technological Transfer], Asian Environment Research Group, National Institute for Environmental Studies, Japan, retrieved on January 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Historic wooden water pipes in Tokyo.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Historic wooden water pipes as shown in the Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Waterworks. Originally, these were underground.]]
Prior to the [[Meiji period]] drinking water in Japan was fetched mainly from springs and traditional shallow wells. However, there were also some piped water supply systems using wooden pipes.

The first modern piped water system in Japan was completed in 1887 in the port city [[Yokohama]], using surface water treated by a sand filter. By 1900, seven cities had piped water supply and by 1940 about one third of the population was connected to piped water systems. The incidence of water-borne diseases such as [[cholera]], [[dysentery]] and [[typhoid]] remained high until after the Second World War when disinfection was introduced by the Americans and became mandatory in 1957. Through the increase of piped water supply, disinfection and sanitation the incidence of waterborne diseases dropped sharply during the 1960s and 70s.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare:[http://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/policy/health/water_supply/1.html Development of Modern Waterworks], retrieved on January 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1960s, Tokyo faced a chronic water shortage and water supply to about 1 million households had to be cut around the time of the [[1964 Summer Olympics]]. At the time, people used to call the city the "Tokyo Desert".

[[File:Lake Miyagase 01.jpg|thumb|Lake Miyagase, a source of drinking water for Tokyo and Yokohama]]
In 1961, a Water Resources Development Promotion Law was passed. On its basis over the next decade seven river basins with high growth in water needs were designated for water resources development and investments in dams, weirs and [[inter-basin transfer]]s was undertaken on the basis of comprehensive development plans for each basin.&lt;ref&gt;Japan Water Agency:[http://www.water.go.jp/honsya/honsya/english/08.html History], retrieved on January 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s and 80s numerous dams were thus built to provide storage to avoid future [[water scarcity]] and to supply the growing cities with sufficient water. However, the construction of some dams was substantially delayed. For example, construction of the dam forming what is today [[Lake Miyagase]] was begun in 1971, but for a number of reasons including the need to resettle 300 households, the dam was only completed in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Global Architects Guide:[http://www.globalarchitectsguide.com/library/Miyagase-Dam.php Miyagase Dam], retrieved on January 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1960s investment in waste water treatment was initiated. In 1993 the Environmental Law was passed and subsequently legislation was passed to protect the headwaters of rivers, thus gradually shifting from a curative approach to a preventative approach of water quality management.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport:[http://www.mlit.go.jp/tochimizushigen/mizsei/water_resources/contents/current_state.html#02 Water Resources of Japan. History of Water Use], retrieved on January 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibility for water supply and sanitation==

===Policy and regulation===
Within the government the responsibility for regulating the water and sanitation sector is shared between the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare]] in charge of water supply for domestic use; the [[Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (Japan)|Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism]] in charge of water resources development as well as sanitation; the [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]] in charge of ambient water quality and environmental preservation; and the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications]] in charge of performance benchmarking of utilities.

In 2004, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare presented a Waterworks Vision "to show a map towards future goals shared among stakeholders of water supply services". The paper lists a number of challenges such as decreasing population, declining investment, ageing facilities and an ageing workforce. It also notes that current anti-earthquake measures are insufficient, some rivers are vulnerable to frequent drought and that facilities need to be better protected against terrorist attacks. The vision recommends a number of measures, including the introduction of "wide area water supply systems", an integrated approach to water quality management, to further promote earthquake-resistant construction, to increase energy efficiency and the use of alternative energies, to further reduce water leakage and to review the subsidy system "without charging higher water rates".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/policy/health/water_supply/dl/3-1a.pdf Waterworks Vision Summary], June 2004, retrieved on January 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water resources development and bulk water supply===
The Japan Water Agency (JWA) under the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism constructs dams, estuary barrages, facilities for lake and marsh development, and canals. It also operates and maintains these facilities, supplying bulk water to other entities, such as utilities, that distribute it to end users. JWA was created by law in 2003 to succeed the Water Resources Development Public Corporation (WARDEC) that had been created in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Japan Water Agency:[http://www.water.go.jp/honsya/honsya/english/08.html JWA History], retrieved on January 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Service provision===
Typically drinking water and sewage services are provided by different entities. In 2007 there were 1,572 water utilities and 3,699 sewage utilities in Japan. The number of sewage utilities is higher than the number of municipalities, which was only 1,804 down from 3,232 in 1999. The higher number of utilities may be because the merger of utilities lagged behind the merger of municipalities. Utilities can be either companies operating under commercial principles, subject to the Local Public Enterprise Law, or departments of local government subject to the government accounting system. Most water utilities but only few  sewer utilities (213) are commercially operated companies. Only in a few cities, such as in [[Kyoto]], drinking water and sewer services are provided by the same entity.&lt;ref name="Ueda"/&gt; There are also 102 bulk water supply entities, which are often departments of Prefectures (such as in [[Osaka]]), specific water supply authorities (such as in Kanagawa) or associations of municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare:[http://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/policy/health/water_supply/1.html Types of Water Supply Services], retrieved on January 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efficiency==

===Non-revenue water===
Average [[non-revenue water]] was 7.3% in 2007, varying from less than 5% up to 15%. The low level of water leakage, down from 18% in 1978, has been achieved through speedy repairs that are typically undertaken the same day that a connection is reported, and through the use of high-quality pipe materials. The government's target is to reduce losses to 2% for large utilities and 5% for small utilities.&lt;ref name="Waterworks technologies"/&gt; Japan is perhaps the only country in the world that also collects nationwide data on unaccounted for sewage, i.e. the amount of water that erroneously enters the [[sanitary sewer]] system e.g. through connections from stormwater sewers or groundwater leakage. The average unaccounted for sewerage is 12%, varying from 6% in [[Shiga]] to 30% in [[Sapporo]].

===Labor productivity===
The number of employees per 1,000 connections is low in international comparison: It is 1.19 for water utilities and 0.62 for sewer utilities, totaling 1.81. It varies between 1.1 in Fukuoka to 2.5 in Kyoto.&lt;ref name="Ueda"/&gt; This is an indicator of high labor productivity. One reason why the figure is low is that activities such as routine operation and maintenance as well as metering and billing are often outsourced. The level of the indicator would be higher and labor productivity would be lower if outsourced employees had been included in the above figures.

===Performance benchmarking===
Japan has a national performance [[benchmarking]] system for water supply and sanitation utilities that operate under the Local Public Enterprise Law. 
==Financial aspects==

===Cost recovery===
Japan has a policy of full cost recovery for drinking water and sanitary sewers through tariffs. Stormwater management is considered a public good and is thus financed through general tax revenue and not through water and sewer tariffs. The accounting systems in place clearly distinguish between the two types of expenses, even in systems with [[combined sewer]]s. The working ratio (share of operating costs in total revenues) averages 49% for water utilities and 67% for sewer utilities, indicating a healthy surplus available for depreciation of assets, debt service and self-financed investments. The cost recovery ratio is 97% for drinking water and 53% for sewerage.

===Tariffs and affordability===
The average [[water tariff]] was equivalent to US$1.33/m3 for water and US$1.13/m3 for sewerage in 2006.&lt;ref name="Ueda"/&gt; Because of Japan's negative inflation rate during some years (e.g. between 2003 and 2006) [[real price|real tariffs]] increase even if [[nominal price|nominal tariffs]] remain unchanged. Utilities cannot raise tariffs themselves, but have to receive approval for tariff increases from municipal councils. The combined water and sewerage bill amounts to about 1% of household income and is thus considered affordable.

===Financing===
Investments are financed through [[Municipal bond|bond]]s issued directly by the municipalities or utility bonds that are backed by municipalities; utilities' own resources; subsidies from the national government (e.g. grants of at least 50% for sanitation); and subsidies from municipalities. Investment subsidies are common for sanitation and uncommon for water supply. Private financing remains the exception.

===Payments for ecosystem services===
Since the 1970s Osaka prefecture has paid the equivalent of more than US$500 million for sustainable forest management around [[Lake Biwa]], which is the source of the [[Yodo River]] that supplies [[Osaka]] with drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;[[OECD]]:[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/51/13/46412900.pdf Environmental Performance Review Japan, Box2:Paying for Ecosystem Services - The Yodo River], 2010, retrieved on January 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the earliest applications of the [[Payment for ecosystem services|payments for ecosystem services]] concept and was implemented long before this English term became widely used.
