== Introduction ==

A River Sutra is a novel by Gita Mehta that was published in 1993 by Random House of Toronto, Canada.[1] It received the greatest attention of all of Mehta’s work, among other classics such as Karma Cola (1979) and Snakes and Ladders (1979).[1]It is considered an accurate representation of Indian Culture, as it covers much of the culture of India, through its portrayal of music, religion, and major landmarks. The story is told in mid-to-late 20th century India and is set around the Narmada River in central India.[2]
It is told from the perspective of a retired bureaucrat who interacts with a variety of travellers and residents of the area, whose stories are relayed to the reader through a series of vignettes.[3] Through these stories, the major themes of love, the Narmada River, desire, the human heart, lust, and religion are explored.[4]

'''Andrey Petrovich Kapitsa''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Андре́й Петро́вич Капи́ца}}; 9 July 1931 – 2 August 2011) was a [[Russia]]n [[geographer]] and [[Antarctic]] explorer, discoverer of [[Lake Vostok]], the largest [[subglacial lake]] in [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref name=rian-20110803/&gt; He was a member of the [[Kapitsa family]], a scientific dynasty in Russia.

Kapitsa was the first to suggest the existence of Lake Vostok in the region of [[Vostok Station]] in Antarctica, based on seismic soundings of the thickness of the [[Antarctic ice sheet]]. These measures were obtained during the [[Soviet Antarctic Expeditions]], in four of which Kapitsa participated.&lt;ref name=lenta/&gt; The discovery of Lake Vostok was one of the last major geographic discoveries.&lt;ref name=rgs/&gt;&lt;ref name=rian-20110803&gt;[http://www.ria.ru/science/20110803/411290289.html Скончался Андрей Капица, первооткрыватель озера Восток в Антарктике] [[RIAN]] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Andrey Kapitsa's father was Nobel Prize-winning physicist [[Pyotr Kapitsa]],&lt;ref name=nobel/&gt; and his maternal grandfather was mathematician and naval engineer [[Aleksey Krylov]]. Pyotr Kapitsa's sons [[Sergey Kapitsa|Sergey]] and Andrey were born in [[Cambridge]], United Kingdom, where their father was conducting research.&lt;ref name=rgs/&gt;&lt;ref name=nobel/&gt;

Andrey graduated from [[Moscow State University]], [[MSU Faculty of Geography|Faculty of Geography]], in 1953. He worked in the Laboratory of Experimental Geomorphology at the faculty since.&lt;ref name=rgs/&gt;

==Antarctic research and discovery of Lake Vostok==
[[File:LakeVostok-Location.jpg|thumb|left|Location of [[Lake Vostok]] in [[East Antarctica]]]]
{{main|Lake Vostok}}
In 1958 Kapitsa defended his [[Candidate of Science]] thesis "Morphology of [[East Antarctic Ice Sheet]]" («Морфология ледникового покрова Восточной Антарктиды»), and in 1968 he defended his [[Doctor of Science]] thesis "[[Geography of Antarctica|Subglacial relief of Antarctica]]" («Подлёдный рельеф Антарктиды»). Kapitsa was a participant in four [[Soviet Antarctic Expedition]]s between 1955 and 1964.&lt;ref name=rgs/&gt;

At the end of the 19th century Russian scientist [[Peter Kropotkin]] proposed the idea of the existence of [[fresh water]] under Antarctic [[ice sheet]]s. He theorized that the tremendous pressure exerted by the cumulative mass of thousands of vertical meters of ice could increase the temperature at the lowest portions of the ice sheet to the point where the ice would melt. Kropotkin's theory was later developed by Russian [[glaciology|glaciologist]] I.A Zotikov, who wrote his PhD thesis on this subject in 1967.&lt;ref name=appeal/&gt;

Andrey Kapitsa used seismic soundings in the region of [[Vostok Station]] made during the Soviet Antarctic Expeditions in 1959 and 1964 to measure the thickness of the ice sheet, discovering two spikes of reflection (one from bedrock and another from the sediment layer).&lt;ref name=appeal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asoc.org/storage/documents/Other_publications/asoc_vostok_statement041408.pdf|title=Appeal to the Duma on Lake Vostok, Antarctica|accessdate=10 February 2011|date=14 April 2008|work=Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kapitsa was the first to suggest the existence of a subglacial lake in this region, which came to be known as Lake Vostok.&lt;ref name=rgs&gt;{{cite news|title=Andrey Kapitsa dies in Moscow|url=http://int.rgo.ru/news/andrey-kapitsa-dies-in-moscow/ |work=[[Russian Geographical Society]] |date=3 August 2011 |accessdate=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lenta&gt;[http://lenta.ru/news/2011/08/03/kapitsa/ Скончался первооткрыватель озера Восток в Антарктиде] [[Lenta.ru]] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lake was named after Vostok Station, which in turn had been named after the ''[[Vostok (sloop-of-war)|Vostok]]'', the 900-ton [[corvette]] of the discoverer of Antarctica, [[Russian explorers|Russian explorer]] [[Russian Admiral|Admiral]] [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen|Fabian von Bellingshausen]]. The word ''восток'' means "east" in Russian, and the name of the station and the lake also reflects the fact that they are located in the East of Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antarcticconnection.com/antarctic/stations/vostok.shtml Vostok Station] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204062659/http://www.antarcticconnection.com/antarctic/stations/vostok.shtml |date=4 February 2012 }} antarcticconnection.com&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lake Vostok Sat Photo color.jpg|thumb|240px|Satellite image of [[Lake Vostok]] by [[NASA]]]]
By 1993, the research of Russian and British scientists confirmed the existence of the lake,&lt;ref name=appeal/&gt; and subsequent research established its features. Other [[subglacial lake]]s were also discovered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://salegos-scar.montana.edu/ Subglacial Antarctic Lake Exploration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215080128/http://salegos-scar.montana.edu/ |date=15 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
Kapitsa was the dean of his alma mater [[MSU Faculty of Geography]] in 1966–1970.&lt;ref name=rgs/&gt; In 1967–1969 he was the leader of the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]] Expedition in the East Africa.&lt;ref name=lenta/&gt; He was elected into the ranks of the Academy in 1970 and was honored with a 1971 [[USSR State Prize]] and 1972 [[Moscow State University|MSU]]’s [[Dmitry Anuchin]] Prize for the creation of the ''Atlas of Antarctica''.&lt;ref name=rgs/&gt;  He supported the theory of natural causes behind the Antarctic [[ozone hole]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informnauka.ru/rus/1999/12_r.htm Подтверждение гипотезы о естественном происхождении антарктической озоновой дыры] Russian Science News {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the theory of natural reasons behind [[global warming]].&lt;ref name=lenta/&gt;

Kapitsa died in Moscow on 2 August 2011 at the age of 80.&lt;ref name=rgs/&gt; Half a year later, on 6 February 2012, after twenty years of drilling, a team of Russian scientists completed the longest ever [[ice core]] of 3,768 meters and pierced the Antarctic ice shield to reach the surface of [[Lake Vostok]].&lt;ref name=Kaufman&gt;{{cite news | first = Marc |last=Kaufman | title = Russians drill into previously untouched Lake Vostok below Antarctic glacier | date = 6 February 2012 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/russians-drill-into-previously-untouched-lake-vostok-below-antarctica/2012/02/06/gIQAGziNuQ_story.html | work = The Washington Post | accessdate =6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Baraachit''' ({{lang-ar| برعشيت }}), also spelt '''Brashit''',&lt;ref&gt;A proper noun used to designate a place, according to Palmer 1881, p. [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp00conduoft#page/19/mode/1up 19]&lt;/ref&gt; is a rural town located in the [[Nabatiye Governorate]], in the [[Bint Jbeil District]] of southern Lebanon, ca. {{convert|3.5|km}} southeast of [[Tibnine]] and about {{convert|80|km}} from [[Beirut]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lebanon.places-in-the-world.com/276393-place-Baraachit.html  Baraachit, Lebanon – General Facts]&lt;/ref&gt; The village sits on an elevation of {{convert|710|m|ft|}} above sea level. The town has a mixed population of [[Lebanese Shi'a Muslims|Shi'a]] and Christians.

==History==
The village once marked the northernmost extent of Jewish settlement upon their return from Babylonia in the 4th century BCE, and is mentioned in the 3rd century [[Mosaic of Rehob]].&lt;ref&gt;[[F.

In 1596, the village ‘’Bra’sit’’ was named in the [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] ''[[nahiya]]'' (subdistrict) of  [[Tibnin]]  under the ''[[Liwa (Arabic)|liwa']]'' (district) of [[Safad]], with a population of 45 households and 7 bachelors, all Muslim. The villagers paid taxes on  agricultural products, such as [[wheat]], [[barley]],  olive trees, fruit trees, goats and beehives, in addition to "occasional revenues" and a fixed sum; a total of 13,370 [[akçe]].&lt;ref name="Hutteroth"&gt;Hütteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note that Rhode, 1979, p.

In 1881, British explorers, [[C. R. Conder]] and [[H. H. Kitchener]], surveyed parts of southern Lebanon, mentioning ten villages in the ''Belad Besharah'' region, among which is listed Ber'ashit ([[sic]]): "A large village, containing about 500 [[Metawileh]] and 200 Christians. It is situated on the side of a hill, and surrounded by figs, olives, and arable cultivation. There is a good spring and several cisterns in the village."&lt;ref&gt;Conder and  Kitchener, 1881, p.[https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp01conduoft#page/94/mode/1up 94]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coele-Syria''', '''Coele Syria''', '''Coelesyria''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Κοίλη Συρία}}, ''Koílē Syría''), also rendered as '''Coelosyria''' and '''Celesyria''', otherwise '''Hollow Syria''' ({{lang-lat|Cava Syria}}, {{lang-ger|Hohl Syrien}}), was a region of [[Syria (region)|Syria]] in [[classical antiquity]]. It probably derived from the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] for ''all'' of the [[Syria (region)|region of Syria]] but more often was applied to the [[Beqaa Valley]] between the [[Mount Lebanon|Lebanon]] and [[Anti-Lebanon Mountains|Anti-Lebanon]] mountain ranges. The area now forms part of the modern nations of [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]].

==Name==
It is widely accepted that the term Coele is a transcription of [[Aramaic]] ''kul'', meaning "all, the entire", such that the term originally identified ''all'' of Syria.&lt;ref&gt;"La Syrie creuse n'existe pas", in G. L. Gatier, ''et al.'' ''Géographie historique au proche-orient'' (1988:15-40), reviving the explanation offered by A. Schalit (1954), is reported by Robin Lane Fox, ''Travelling Heroes in the Epic Age of Homer'' (2008, notes p378f): "the crux is solved".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RqdPcxuNthcC&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Hellenistic Settlements in Syria, the Red Sea Basin, and North Africa, Getzel M.

Grabbe, p173] "Yet the suggestion is widely accepted that the name actually derives from Aramaic for "all Syria", which was then assimilated by the Greeks to a more usual pattern for place names"&lt;/ref&gt; The word "Coele", which literally means "hollow" in [[Koine Greek]], is thought to have come about via a [[folk etymology]] referring to the "hollow" [[Beqaa Valley]] between [[Mount Lebanon]] and the [[Anti-Lebanon mountains]].&lt;ref name="Grabbe"/&gt; However, the term Coele-Syria was also used in a wider sense to indicate "all Syria" or "all Syria except Phoenicia", by the writers;  [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], [[Arrian]], [[Ptolemy]]&lt;ref&gt;From Sartre, pages 21-25: [[Diodorus]] 18.6.3, 61.4; 20.73.2; [[Polybius]] 8.17.10–11; Pliny, Naturalis Historiæ 5.106–10; [[Arrian]] Anabasis 2.13.7; [[Ptolemy]] 5.14.1.&lt;/ref&gt; and also [[Diodorus Siculus]], who indicated Coele-Syria to at least stretch as far south as [[Jaffa|Joppa]],&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus c.150 BCE, ''Bibliotheca historica'', XIX, 93; XXIX, 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/diodorusofsicily02dioduoft Diodorus of Sicily, with an English translation by C.H.

On the fifth day's march he reached his destination, and pitched his camp a distance of fifty stades from Rhaphia, which is the first city of Coele-Syria towards Egypt.

The first and only official use of the term was during the period of [[Seleucid]] rule of the region, between c. 200 BCE and 64 BCE.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} During this period, the term "Coele Syria and Phoenicia" or "Coele Syria" was also used in a narrower sense to refer to the former Ptolemaic territory which the Seleucids now controlled, being the area south of the [[An Nahr al Kabir|river Eleutherus]].

==Official usage==
[[Image:Near east lrg.jpg|thumb|left|200px]]
According to [[Polybius]], a former officer of the [[Ptolemaic Empire]] named Ptolemy Thrasea, having fought in the 217 BCE [[Battle of Raphia]], [[Defection|defected]] to the [[Seleucid]] king [[Antiochus III the Great]]. Antiochus gave him the title "[[Strategos]] and [[Archiereus]] of Coele-Syria and Phoenicia". Some scholars speculate that this title may have been used previously by the Ptolemies, but no direct evidence exists to support this.&lt;ref name="Grabbe"/&gt;

==Syrian Wars==
{{main article|Syrian Wars}}
[[Image:Map of ancient Syria, Description de L'Universe (Alain Manesson Mallet, 1683).jpg|right|200px|thumb|Map of ancient Syria]]
The region was disputed between the [[Seleucid dynasty]] and the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] during the [[Syrian Wars]]. [[Alexander the Great]]'s general [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] first occupied Coele-Syria in 318 BC. However, when Ptolemy joined the coalition against [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus]] in 313 BC, he quickly withdrew from Coele-Syria. In 312 BC [[Seleucus I Nicator]], defeated [[Demetrius I of Macedon|Demetrius]], the son of Antigonus, in the [[Battle of Gaza (312 BC)|Battle of Gaza]] which again allowed Ptolemy to occupy Coele-Syria. Though he was again to pull out after only a few months, after Demetrius had won a battle over his general and Antigonus entered Syria in force  up to Antigonuses, this brief success had enabled Seleucus to make a dash for [[Babylonia]] which Seleucus secured. In 302 BC, Ptolemy joined a new coalition against Antigonus and reoccupied Coele-Syria, but quickly withdrew on hearing a false report that Antigonus had won a victory. He was only to return when Antigonus had been defeated at [[Battle of Ipsus|Ipsus]] in 301 BC. Coele-Syria was assigned to [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]], by the victors of Ipsus, as Ptolemy had added nothing to the victory. Though, given Ptolemy's track record, he was unlikely to organize a serious defense of Coele-Syria, Seleucus acquiesced in Ptolemy's occupation, probably because Seleucus remembered how it had been with Ptolemy's help he had reestablished himself in Babylonia.

The later Seleucids were not to be so understanding, resulting in the century of [[Syrian Wars]] between the Ptolemies and Seleucids. The [[Battle of Panium]] in 200 BC, during the Fifth Syrian War, was the final decisive battle between the two sides in ending Ptolemaic control over the region. The 171&amp;ndash;168 BC conflicts over Coele-Syria, between [[Antiochus IV|Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] and [[Ptolemy VI Philometor]], are discussed in [[Livy]]’s [[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|''The History of Rome from its Foundation'']] (in XLII. 29 and XLV. 11&amp;ndash;12).

Seleucid control over the area of [[Judea]] began diminishing with the eruption of the [[Maccabean Revolt]] in 165 BC. With Seleucid troops being involved in warfare on the [[Parthia]]n front, Judea succeeded in securing its independence by 140 BC. Despite attempts of Seleucid rulers to regain territories, the conquests of [[Pompey]] in 64 BC were a decisive blow to them, and [[Syria (Roman Province)|Syria]] became part of the [[Roman Republic]].

==Upper Syria==

The word Κοίλη in this context does thus not mean “hollow” (κοῖλος), but “whole”, and originates probably as a Greek transliteration from the Aramaic word “kul”. As a result of administrative changes in the Levant during the following two and a half centuries, the toponym “Coele Syria” acquired additional narrower meanings, whereby it was used to refer to different parts of Syria.

Now if we determine the limits of these two mountains, we shall go near to settle those of ''Coele Syria''. They both begin a little above the sea; Libanus near Tripolis; chiefly against the spot called Dei Facies: Antilibanus at Sidon; but they terminate near the mountains of Arabia, above the territory of Damascus, and near the mountains of the Trachonitis, and there they terminate in other mountains, Strabo.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wars between the Ptolemies and the Seleucidæ, the name Cœle (or Hollow Syria) was applied to the whole of the southern portion of Syria, but under the Romans, it was confined to "Cœlesyria Proper" and variously included the district east of Anti-Libanus, about Damascus, and a portion of Palestine east of the Jordan river (possibly of: [[Transjordan (region)|Trans-Jordan]], [[Perea]], or the [[Decapolis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pliny (the Elder)|title=The Natural History of Pliny|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aVMMAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA423|year=1893|publisher=H.

After the creation of the Roman province of Arabia in 106 A.D. Gerasa and Philadelphia were included in it. Nonetheless, Ptolemy—who was writing in the second century A.D. but did not record places by Roman provinces—described them as being in (the local geographical unit of) Coele Syria (5.14.18). Furthermore, Philadelphia continued to describe itself on its coins and in inscriptions of the second and third centuries A.D. as being a city of Coele Syria; see above, Philadelphia, n. 9. As for the boundaries of the new province, the northern frontier extended to a little beyond the north of Bostra and east; the western border ran somewhat east of the Jordan River valley and the Dead Sea but west of the city of Madaba (see M. Sartre, ''Trois ét.'', 17-75; Bowersock, ZPE&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, [1970] 37-39; id., ''JRS''61 [1971] 236-42; and especially id.. ''Arabia'', 90-109). Gadara in Peraea is identified today with es-Salt near Tell Jadur, a place that is near the western boundary of the province of Arabia. And this region could have been described by Stephanos as being located ”between Coele Syria and Arabia.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Endere''' is an archaeological site in [[Xinjiang]], [[China]], in the southern [[Taklamakan Desert]], a part of the southern route of the ancient [[Silk Road]].  It has been tentatively identified with a place called Saca that is mentioned in documents written in [[Kharoshthi|Kharoṣṭhī script]] which have been found in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Martin Rhie | first=Marylin | title=Early Buddhist Art of China &amp; Central Asia | series=Handbuch der Orientalistik, Part 4 | publisher=Brill | year=1999 | isbn=9789004112018 | volume=1 | page=368 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological excavations==

In 1901 the fort of Endere was excavated by Sir [[Mark Aurel Stein]]. Endere is believed to have been an important military post and a centre for Buddhist worship located about half-way between [[Charchan]] and Nina (or [[Niya (Tarim Basin)|Niya]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Noble|first=Peter S.|title=Bulletin of the School of Oriental Studies, University of London|year=1931}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coins discovered there indicate that the Chinese controlled the area as early as the [[Han Dynasty]] but fell to the [[Tibetans]] during the [[Tang Dynasty]]. However, the fort was abandoned in the ninth century when the Endere river changed its course.

Stein discovered a number of buildings devoted to [[Buddhist]] worship including a shrine filled with textile rags and fragments of Buddhist manuscripts written in Chinese, Tibetan and [[Sanskrit]] which suggests it had drawn worshippers from far and wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Aurel Stein &amp; the Silk Road finds|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/t/the-silk-road-finds-map-4/|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Erythraean Sea''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Ἐρυθρὰ Θάλασσα}} ''Erythra Thalassa'', "Red Sea") is the name in ancient [[cartography]] for a body of water located between the [[Horn of Africa]] and the [[Arabian peninsula]]. The name is now obsolete.

==Etymology==
This appellation may have derived from the seasonal blooms of the red-coloured ''[[Trichodesmium|Trichodesmium erythraeum]]'' near the water's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.library.eb.com/eb/article-9106296 |title= Red Sea | accessdate=2008-01-14 | work= Encyclopædia Britannica Online Library Edition |publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the third century, [[Flavius Philostratus]] made this comment: "And they say that the sea called Erythra or "red" is of a deep blue colour, but that it was so named, as I said before, from a King Erythras, who gave his own name to the sea in question." &lt;ref&gt;''Life of Apollonius of Tyana'', Book III, chapter L, Loeb Classical Library&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of the name==

The name "Erythraean Sea" has been or is still used for the following places: 
*In the opening sentences of [[Herodotus]]'s history, written in the 5th century BC, he refers to the [[Phoenicians]] having come originally from the Erythraean Sea. 
*In the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'', written in the 1st century AD, as well as in some ancient maps, the name of the sea refers to the whole area of the northwestern Indian Ocean, including the [[Arabian Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:1794_Anville_Map_of_the_Ancient_World_-_Geographicus_-_AncientWorld-anville-1794.jpg 1794, Orbis Veteribus Notus by Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In centuries past, the name "Erythraean Sea" was applied by [[cartographer]]s to the NW part of the [[Indian Ocean]], mainly the area around [[Socotra]], between [[Cape Guardafui]] and the coast of [[Hadhramaut]]. This appellation has now become obsolete and the name [[Gulf of Aden]] is used, although for a smaller area. In maps where the NW Indian Ocean is named thus, the Red Sea appears as "Arabian Gulf". 
*The name "Erythraean Sea" was used as well to refer to some [[Headlands and bays|gulf]]s attached to the Indian Ocean, specifically, the [[Persian Gulf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924030139236|title=The Periplus of the Erythræan sea; travel and trade in the Indian Ocean|last=Schoff|first=Wilfred H. (Wilfred Harvey)|date=1912-01-01|publisher=New York : Longmans, Green, and Co.|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=50|quote=|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*As a name for the [[Red Sea]], especially after the 19th century. The modern country of [[Eritrea]] was named after this ancient Greek name. 
*Since 1895, the name has also been applied to a large dusky region on the surface of planet [[Mars]], known as [[Mare Erythraeum]].

The '''Goddard Rocket Launching Site''' is a [[National Historic Landmark]] commemorating the launch site of the world's first successful liquid-fueled [[rocket]]. It is located at 20 Upland Street, [[Auburn, Massachusetts]], within the Pakachoag Golf Course. The launch site is indicated with two markers accessible to visitors while the golf course is open. It is at the "9th Fairway, between Tee and Green," of the Pakachoag Golf Course.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;

[[File:Monument for Robert H. Goddard's First Rocket Launch 16 Mar 1969.JPG|thumb|Monument reads: Site of launching of world's first liquid propellant rocket by Dr. Robert H. Goddard 16 March 1926 - located on the Pakachoag Golf Course in Auburn, MA]] There are two monuments at this site. The launch site monument is just off the street to the right of the club house. The landing site is on the ninth hole near the pond. The monument may be difficult to access due to the nature of golf. The best advice for visiting the landing monument is to walk the rock wall between 1st and 9th fairways.

Dr. [[Robert H. Goddard]] launched his historic rocket on March 16, 1926, from what was then the Asa Ward Farm. The {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=on}} rocket reached an altitude of {{convert|41|ft|m}}, flew for two-and-a-half seconds, and fell to the ground {{convert|184|ft|m}} from the launching frame.

Goddard's final launch from Auburn, on July 17, 1929, was also a historic first. The {{convert|11|ft|m|adj=on}} rocket carried an [[aneroid barometer]], [[thermometer]], and a camera triggered when the parachute opened. All three instruments operated successfully and were recovered. The rocket achieved a maximum altitude of {{convert|90|ft}} in an 18.5-second flight covering a distance of {{convert|171|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spaceline.org/history/22.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1966.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Goddard Rocket Launching Site|url={{NHLS url|id=66000654}} |format=pdf|date=May 19, 1975 |author1=Polly M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2956">An '''ice divide''' is the boundary on an [[ice sheet]], [[ice cap]] or [[glacier]] separating opposing flow directions of [[ice]], analogous to a [[drainage divide|water divide]]. Such ice divides are important for [[geochronology]] investigations using [[ice core]]s, because such coring is typically made on top of a dome of an ice sheet to avoid interference caused by horizontal ice movement. Ice divides are used for looking at what the atmosphere was like in history. The ice is very accurate because instead of shifting horizontally like normal ice, it moves vertically downward with time trapping gases into its layers. Scientist find these ice divides and take ice cores from them, which are typically long cylinder poles of ice, and evaluate them. Once they have these ice cores, they are able to look through it and find elements that the snow and ice carried down with it during that time period such as sulfate, nitrate, and other ions. These ice cores are important in determining how our atmosphere has changed for the better or worse, and how we can fix it such as the greenhouse effect which discovered when scientist found how much more greenhouse gasses was in our atmosphere than there was in the past.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iceandclimate.nbi.ku.dk/researchflowofice/modelling_ice_flow/ University of Copenhagen. (2012). Centre for Ice and Climate. Retrieved December 6, 2012 (dead link)]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists from around the United States came together to find the perfect ice divide in order to go the furthest into the past. They formed the WAIS project. This project is funded by the United States National Science Foundation, and is run by scientists from many organizations such as [[National Ice Core Laboratory]], Ice Drilling Design and Operations (IDDO), and over fifty Universities. The WAIS project is located in West Antarctica, and the goal is to look into the past 100,000 years. WAIS is better than other ice divides because of the amount of snow it gets. This large amount of snow causes there to be a very small off-set from the ages of the ice to the air and gases trapped inside. This gives the scientists to give much more precise predictions of what the atmosphere was like in history. If the WAIS project is a success it will educate scientists around the world how the atmosphere of Earth has changed completely over 100,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.waisdivide.unh.edu/science/index.shtml |title=National Science Foundation.

== Content ==

The ''Inside GNSS'' editorial content has been heavily weighted towards issues of the four major GNSS operators: the United States (GPS), Russia ([[GLONASS]]), China ([[Beidou Navigation Satellite System|BeiDou]]) and the European Union ([[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]]). Regional and augmentation systems such as those developed by the United States ([[Wide Area Augmentation System|WAAS]], [[GNSS augmentation|SBAS]]), Japan ([[Quasi-Zenith Satellite System|QZSS]]) and Europe ([[European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service|EGNOS]]) as well as [[LORAN|eLoran]], the terrestrial radionavigation system, are also covered.

As GNSS systems have developed, the magazine has covered the integration of GNSS with other PNT technologies to improve user equipment in places where satellite signals are hard to obtain, the implications for manufacturers and policy-makers as more satellite signals and new systems become available, and the political and legal problems and opportunities that arise as location-based technology becomes increasingly accurate.

''Inside GNSS'' was the first publication to cover several GNSS political decisions and controversies and the first outside of scholarly publications to cover several GNSS technical milestones. The magazine presented the first stories about:
* the decision for the common GPS/Galileo civil signal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Gibbons, G., and P. Fenton, L. Garin, R. Hatch, T. Kawazoe, R. Keegan, J. Knight, S. Kohli, D. Rowitch, L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5931">'''Labëria''' is a historic region that is roughly situated in southwestern Albania. Its inhabitants are known as Labs (referred to as {{lang-sq|sing: Lab, pl. Lebër, also dial. sing.: Lap}} in Albanian and {{lang-el|Λιάπηδες}}, ''Liapides'' in Greek) and its boundaries reach from [[Vlorë]] to [[Himara]] in the south, to the [[Greece|Greek]] border near [[Sarandë]], incorporating the Kurvelesh region of [[Gjirokastër District]] and extending east to the city of [[Tepelenë]].

== Extent == 
In its most extensive definition, Labëria may be used to include everything from [[Mallakastra]] and the [[Vjosa]] river down to [[Saranda]], and in its (somewhat more common) most specific definition, it may refer only to [[Himara]], [[Tepelena]] and [[Kurvelesh (region)|Kurvelesh]]. In the more extensive definition, in addition to these three regions, other regions included are [[Vlore]] and its surroundings south of the Vjosa river, [[Lunxhëria]], [[Mallakastra]], [[Gjirokastër]] and its surroundings, [[Delvinë]] and its surroundings, [[Pogon, Albania|Pogon]], [[Dropull]], [[Saranda]] and sometimes ( very rarely) [[Këlcyra]] and [[Zagori]]. Bordering regions include [[Pogon, Albania|Pogon]], [[Myzeqe]], [[Chamëria]], [[Dangëllia]] and [[Dishnica]] (as well as the border with Greece). 

[[File:Hills Horë-Vranisht.jpg|thumb|Hill formations in Hore-Vranisht]]
== Culture ==
Labëria is culturally distinguishable from the rest of Albania in its traditions and folklore. The Labs were warlike pastoral people who lived mainly in the mountains of [[Kurvelesh municipality|Kurvelesh]], [[Progonat]] and [[Vlorë]] during the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Ottoman wars in Europe#Wars in Albania|Ottoman invasion of Albania]]. However, due to mass migrations to urban areas following [[World War II]], the population is now concentrated in the cities of [[Vlorë]], [[Tepelenë]], [[Gjirokastër]] and [[Sarandë]]. 

[[Pleqërishte]] is a genre of [[Albanian iso-polyphony]] primarily found in Labëria

== History == 
Historically the Labs were followers of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] but many converted to Islam during Ottomon rule, with the bulk of conversion occurring in the 18th century. Conversions were especially intense during years of conflict between Orthodox Russia and the Ottoman Empire, during which some pressure was applied on Orthodox Christians by Ottoman rulers, including even low-scale forced conversion of villages, contradicting the official Ottoman tolerance for Christians.&lt;ref name="kostaconversions"&gt;Giakoumis, Kosta. ''The Orthodox Church in Albania during Ottoman Rule''. Page 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional reasons for conversion included discrimination and exploitation of Christians by Ottoman rulers, the previous patterns of conversion between different Christian sects and the diverse pre-Ottoman distribution of Christian faiths in the region (including Orthodoxy, [[Catholicism]], [[Bogomilism]], and even [[Arianism]]), the poll tax which only Christians had to pay, the poverty of the church, the mass illiteracy of priests and the fact that the language of worship was not the Albanian vernacular.&lt;ref name="kostaconversions"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skendi, "Religion in Ottoman Albania", p319-320&lt;/ref&gt; Tradition holds that a mass conversion of Labs occurred during a famine in which the bishops of Himara and Delvina refused to let the Labs break fast and drink milk.&lt;ref&gt;Aravantinos, ''Perigraphi tis Epeiros'', pp444-445&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Labs were recruited by the Ottoman [[Jannissary]] corps due to their warlike nature and the Ottomans' initial preference for recruiting Albanians after their invasion of the Balkans. After the disbandment of the Jannissary corps by [[Mahmud II|Sultan Mahmud II]] in 1826, the [[Sufism|Sufi branch]] of the [[Bektashi Order]], a core Janissary institution, was also disbanded, and its followers executed or exiled to Southern Albania. As a result, the majority of the Labs today belong to the Bektashi faith with Orthodox Christians concentrated in the Himara coastal region as well as a few pockets throughout Vlorë district and the southern and eastern parts of the region, around Gjirokastër, Delvine and Sarande.

[[Ali Pasha of Ioannina|Ali Pasha of Tepelena]] or of Yanina (Ioannina), surnamed Aslan, "the Lion", or the "Lion of Yannina" (1740–1822), was born in this region. He ruled the western part of [[Rumelia]], the Ottoman Empire's European territory which was also called [[Pashalik of Yanina]]. His court was in [[Ioannina]]. Ali had three sons: Ahmet Muhtar Pasha (served in the 1809 war against the Russians), Veli Pasha of Morea and Salih Pasha of Vlorë. Ali Pasha of Tepelena died fighting on February 5, 1822, at the age of 82.

== Language == 
{{main article|Lab Albanian dialect}} 
The dialect associated with Labëria is the [[Lab Albanian dialect|Lab dialect]], which is particular to the region. The dialect mixes innovative and archaic features, and is closely related to the [[Arbëresh]] spoken by the [[Arbëreshë people|old Albanian diaspora]] in [[Italy]], the [[Arvanitika]] of [[Arvanites]] in [[Greece]], and [[Cham Albanian dialect|Cham Albanian]]. 

The [[Himariote dialect]] of Greek is also spoken in the region of Himara, which is often considered part of Laberia, and other Greek dialects are spoken in the southern extremes of the region as well as in the villages of [[Nartë]] and [[Zvernec]]. [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] and [[Roma people|Roma]] minorities that are present in some places may also speak their ancestral languages.

===''Finding Nemo''===
'''''[[Finding Nemo]]''''' was released in 2003, written by [[Andrew Stanton]], directed by Stanton and [[Lee Unkrich]]. It tells the story of the overly protective [[clownfish]] Marlin ([[Albert Brooks]]), who along with a [[Paracanthurus hepatus|regal tang]] called Dory ([[Ellen DeGeneres]]), searches for his son Nemo ([[Alexander Gould]]).  Along the way he learns to take risks and that his son is capable of taking care of himself.

'''''[[WALL-E]]''''' (promoted with an [[interpunct]] as '''''WALL·E''''') was released in 2008 and directed by [[Andrew Stanton]]. It follows the story of a robot named WALL-E who is designed to clean up a polluted Earth far in the future.

Most of the characters do not have actual human voices, but instead communicate with body language and robotic sounds, designed by [[Ben Burtt]], that resemble voices. In addition, it is the first animated feature by Pixar to have segments featuring [[live action|live-action]] characters.

[[Walt Disney Pictures]] released it in the United States and Canada on June 27, 2008. The film grossed $23.1 million on its opening day, and $63 million during its opening weekend in 3,992 theaters, ranking #1 at the box office. This ranks the third highest-grossing opening weekend for a Pixar film as of July 2008. Following Pixar tradition, ''WALL-E'' was paired with a short film, ''[[Presto (film)|Presto]]'', for its theatrical release.  ''WALL-E'' has achieved highly positive reviews with an approval rating of 96% on the review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. It grossed $533 million worldwide, won the 2009 Best Animated Film Golden Globe Award and is nominated for six [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]].

Below is a '''list of foreign visits made by Queen Victoria''' during her reign (which lasted from 1837 until 1901), giving the names of the places she stayed and any known reasons for her visit.

Despite being head of [[British Empire|an empire on which the sun never sets]], [[Queen Victoria]] never travelled outside of [[Europe]], only travelling as far north as [[Golspie]], southwesterly as [[San Sebastián]], southeasterly as [[Florence]] and as far easterly as [[Berlin]].  The majority of her visits were made to the duchies and kingdoms of Germany (often via Belgium or the Netherlands) which was the home of many members of her family and the birthplace of her husband, [[Albert, Prince Consort|Albert]]. She also made a few official visits to France and frequently holidayed there towards the end of her life and reign, as well as holidaying a few times in Italy and once in Switzerland.  During their married life, the couple tended to make foreign trips in late summer, however from the 1870s (in her widowhood), Victoria travelled during the spring.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22181">This is a '''list of indoor [[arena]]s in Europe''' by capacity. A broad definition of "[[Europe]]" is used here, including the entirety of [[Russia]], [[Turkey]] and [[Azerbaijan]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Armenia]], [[Kazakhstan]].

The [[Sport venue|venues]] are by their final capacity after construction for seating-only events. There is more capacity if standing room is included (i.e. for concerts). All venues with at least 10,000 seats are listed.
&lt;!--------- IMPORTANT: PLEASE, ONCE YOU ADD A NEW ARENA OR CHANGE THE ORDER, DO NOT FORGET TO VERIFY IT WITH A RELIABLE SOURCE. THANK YOU! ---------&gt;

===Current arenas that can be used for football===
[[File:Moscow 05-2017 img48 Olimpiysky Arena.jpg|thumb|[[Olympic Stadium (Moscow)|SC Olimpiyskiy]], [[Moscow]]]]

[[File:СКК - panoramio.jpg|thumb|[[Saint Petersburg Sports and Concert Complex|SCC Peterburgskiy]], [[Saint Petersburg]]]]
Currently these arenas are primarily used for indoor sports and/or other events i.e. music concerts, but can also receive association football or rugby matches in the winter, unlike the US and Canada domes, which are enclosed stadiums primarily used for outdoor sports.

[[Telenor Arena]] could be considered the only dome in Europe from its opening in 2009 until 2011, when the association football club [[Stabæk Fotball|Stabæk]] used it for their home matches before returning to their old home, [[Nadderud Stadion]], as the club couldn't support the rent to play at Telenor Arena. The next domed stadium to open in Europe was [[U Arena]] in 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3513">The island of '''[[Minorca]]''' in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] '''has been invaded''' on numerous occasions. The first recorded invasion occurred in 252 BC, when the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] arrived. The name of the island's chief city, [[Mahón]] (now Maó), appears to derive from their language, [[Punic language|Punic]]. The name of the island is of [[Latin language|Latin]] origin, and dates from after the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] conquest, led by [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Balearicus|Quintus Caecilius Metellus]] in 123 BC, during a campaign which earned him the [[agnomen]] ''Balearicus''.

The island was briefly subsumed under the [[Vandal kingdom of Africa]] around 427, but it was eventually reconquered by the Romans and incorporated in the [[Byzantine Empire]]. It was an obscure province increasingly outside the sphere of Byzantine influence for the next four centuries. Around 859 a [[Viking]] incursion destroyed or damaged many Byzantine churches. In 903 the island was invaded by the [[Emirate of Córdoba]], resulting in the introduction of Islam and renewed contacts with the Iberian peninsula. The [[Taifa of Menorca|''taifa'' of Minorca]], the last Muslim state on the island, accepted the authority of the [[Crown of Aragon]] in 1231–32, and was finally conquered in 1287–88; its Muslim population being either ransomed or enslaved.&lt;ref&gt;Parpal i Marquès, Cosme "La conquesta de Menorca, el 1287, per Alfons el Liberal", Barcelona, Rafael Dalmau (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; The island came under attack from the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1535, when [[Sack of Mahón|Mahón was sacked]], and again in 1558, when [[Ottoman invasion of the Balearic islands (1558)|Mahón again and also Ciutadella were sacked]].

During the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], the island was taken by the French in 1707 with no military action, but [[Capture of Minorca (1708)|in 1708 it was captured by the British]], whose sovereignty was recognised in the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] (1713). The French returned in 1756, [[Battle of Minorca (1756)|beating the British at sea]], and [[Siege of Fort St Philip (1756)|capturing Fort St Philip]]. In 1763, at the end of the [[Seven Years' War]], the French ceded the island back to Britain. During the [[American Revolutionary War]], the French sided with Spain and [[Invasion of Minorca (1781)|invaded Minorca]] in 1781. It was a part of Spain until being [[Capture of Minorca (1798)|reconquered by the British]] in 1798, during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. Britain handed Minorca back to Spain under the [[Treaty of Amiens]] (1802), having chosen to keep [[Malta]] as a Mediterranean base instead.&lt;ref&gt;Sloss, Janet [http://www.bonaventura.co.uk/exitintro.html Exit Britannia: Britain’s Last Conquest of Menorca 1798-1802], Tetbury UK, Bonaventura Press (2002)- accessed 2007-12-17&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Spanish Civil War]], the island remained loyal to the Republic, but [[Battle of Minorca (1939)|was captured by the Nationalists]] in February 1939.

This is a list representing '''[[time zone]]s by country'''. Countries are ranked by total number of time zones on their territory. Time zones of a country include that of [[dependent territories]] (except [[Territorial claims in Antarctica|Antarctic claims]]). [[France]], including its overseas territories, has the most time zones with 13. Many countries have [[daylight saving time]], one added hour during the local summer, but this list does not include that information. The [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] offset in the list is not valid in practice during daylight saving time.

There are few documented [[wolf attacks on humans]] in [[North America]] in comparison to [[Eurasia]] and other larger carnivores.

| Candice Berner || 32 || ♀ || 8 March 2010 || Predatory || [[Chignik, Alaska]], US, 75 miles southwest of [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak]] || Berner, a teacher and avid jogger, was discovered dead along a road by snowmobilers, who found wolf tracks in the adjacent snow. The Alaska State Medical Examiner ruled that her death was caused by "multiple injuries due to animal mauling." A series of necropsies performed on wolves culled in the surrounding area shortly after the attack ruled out rabies, sickness, or wolf-dog hybridisation as being causes of the attack. The verified case was notable as being the first recorded fatal wolf attack in Alaska in which DNA evidence was gathered to confirm wolf involvement. ||Findings, [[Alaska Department of Fish and Game]] &lt;ref&gt;Butler, L., B.

| [[Death of Kenton Joel Carnegie|Kenton Carnegie]] || 22 || ♂	|| 8 November 2005 || Predatory || [[Points North Landing]], Saskatchewan, Canada || In the weeks leading up to the assault, natural prey for local wolves was becoming scarce. Four wolves at Points North Landing had begun feeding on camp garbage that fall and were habituating increasingly to human activities. On 4 November 2005 two of Carnegie's camp companions, an experienced bush pilot and  a geophysicist, met up with two aggressive wolves on the airfield close to camp. The two young men beat back the assault, photographed the wolves and told everybody in camp. They later turned their photos over to the investigating authorities. This incident is now presumed to have been an exploratory assault by the wolves that fits a pattern leading up to predation. On 8 November, the bush pilot warned Carnegie to not walk near [[Wollaston Lake]], but he ignored it. Carnegie hiked in the snow, but did not return to the geological surveyor camp. His body was found partially consumed in an area known to be frequented by four wolves (two gray-tans, one [[black wolf|black]], and one [[Arctic wolf|white]]) which regularly fed on human garbage. The pathologist who performed the autopsy testified Carnegie had lost about 25% to 30% of his body mass in the assault, with the top midsection to the thigh having been partially consumed. Although originally the possibility that the culprit was a [[American black bear|black bear]] was not ruled out, a coroners' jury concluded after a two year inquiry that the attackers had indeed been a wolf pack. ||Dr. [[Valerius Geist]], [[University of Calgary]];&lt;ref name=Geist&gt;{{cite web |title=Statement by Valerius Geist pertaining to the death of Kenton Carnegie.|url=http://graywolfnews.com/pdf/dr_valarius_geist_re_carnegie.pdf|accessdate=19 February 2014|author=[[Valerius Geist]], PhD., Professional Biologist Professor Emeritus of Environmental Science  The University of Calgary|date=29 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Geist|first1=Valerius|title=Death by Wolves and Misleading Advocacy|url=https://www.boone-crockett.org/conservation/conservation_geist3.asp|website=Boone and Crockett Club|publisher=Boone and Crockett Club|accessdate=9 July 2015|location=Missoula, MT}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence review and Findings, [[Alaska Department of Fish and Game]]&lt;ref&gt;McNay, M.

| Woman and her two children|| Adult and 2 children || ♂ and ♀ || Early 1890s || [[n/a]] || [[Mexico]], in the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] Mountains between [[Durango]] and the [[Pacific]] coast|| A horseman met a woman and two children who were walking to a relative's remote home. He offered to accompany them as protection from the dangers of wolves (species [[Mexican wolf]]) and robbers. The mother declined. The next travelers a short time later found the remains of the three, scattered on the same trail. The cited source indicates the incident was not a lone anecdote but representative of frequent incidents, owing to the fact the local residents were poorly armed. ||[[J.

Hampden Porter]]|accessdate=26 June 2015|chapter=The Wolf|quote=In the Sierra Madre two wolves are commonly considered to be a match for a man armed as these people usually are, and unless the whole population have conspired together for the purpose of propagating falsehoods on this particular subject, it must be believed that the lobo is often guilty of manslaughter. It has not happened to the writer to be personally cognizant of the death of any victim of theirs, but riding  westward one day through the forests of that mountainous country lying between Durango and the Pacific coast, in the interval between two divisions of a large train of arrieros separated from each other by a distance of several miles, a woman and two children, boy and girl, were met. Struck by the beauty of the little girl, and knowing the way to be unsafe, some conversation took place in which the mother made light of those dangers suggested, and declined, with a profusion of thanks, an offer to see the party safe to her sister's rancho in a neighboring valley. They had only a little distance to go along the ridge, she said, and would then soon descend to their place of destination. The wolves were like devils, it was true, but robbers were worse, and she had many times crossed there from her home without meeting with either. In short, muchissimas gracias Senor, y todos los santos, etc., etc. Adios! All of them were devoured a very short time after. Their clothes and bones were found scattered on the trail which they had not yet left before they were killed. The muleteers in rear who found these fragments collected and buried them, putting up the usual frail cross which is to be seen along this route, literally by scores.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|unidentified||Adult||♂ ||February 1873||[[n/a]]||"20 mi. N. of Perry's Mills" in Wisconsin|| A farmer walked out of the woods and found a pair of boots with the deceased's feet still in them, particles of clothing, bones, a dead dog and two dead wolves.

|Corporal Michael McGillicuddy of the 3rd Infantry, Company C ||Adult||♂ ||5 August 1868 at 2200 hrs||Rabid||[[Fort Larned National Historic Site]], 5.5 miles west of [[Larned, Kansas]]|| A rabid wolf entered the Ft. Larned military outpost on the Arkansas River, furiously snapping at everything and everyone, tearing tents, curtains, bed clothes etc. It entered the hospital and bit a bedridden patient, Corporal McGillicuddy, severely on the left hand and right arm and nearly severed off the left little finger. The wolf then rushed into a group of ladies and gentlemen who were gathered socially and singing on the front steps of Colonel Wynkoop's house.  It bit Lt. Thompson of the 3rd U.S. Infantry, severely wounding him in both legs. Colonel Wynkoop and his scout James Morrison immediately took up arms and gave chase as the wolf ran into another structure and bit a Private soldier with the 10th Cavalry Buffalo Soldiers in two places. A sentry at the guard house fired a shot that went over the wolf's back as the wolf ran between his own legs. The wolf entered the quarters of the laundress and tried to attack her in her bed, but she was protected by the bed covers. The wolf finally charged at the sentinel at the haystack, but the guard shot it dead and escaped injury.  The injuries were all cauterized with nitrate of silver and washed with alkali washes regularly at the base infirmary. Hospital records show that on the evening of 6 September, Corporal McGillicuddy began showing marked signs and symptoms of hydrophobia. No further treatment was given to him. He died on 9 September. A large Newfoundland dog that also had been bitten died with marked symptoms of hydrophobia. The other patients fully recovered. Hospital records indicated speculation that Corporal McGillicuddy's refusal to allow amputation of his finger may have contributed to his death. Lt -Col. Dodge made inquiry with Indians camped in the local vicinity. They told him attacks by rabid wolves that entered into their village were not infrequent, and they knew of no person who had received even the smallest scratch from a rabid wolf ever to have recovered.||&lt;ref name="lin29"&gt;{{Harvnb|Linnell|2002|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wynkoop|first1=Edward W.|title=Ferocious Attack by a Rabid Wolf|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86053571/1868-08-19/ed-1/seq-4/|accessdate=7 July 2015|agency=The National Republican|date=19 August 1869|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barnitz|first1=Cpt.

The wolves are numerous here and in the two above named months they sometimes go made [sic] and in this condition they will enter a camp or town or even a house if the door is left open and bite everything in their course. At this season the Mexicans generally (those that have no doors) sleep on top of their houses out of reach of this danger.This horrible disease is much more common here among the wolves than it is among our dogs in the States. They are a terror to the whole country. One of our men told me of six persons who were bitten in this thinly settled neighborhood last year. One of them was badly mangled by the rabid animal, and in one instance the wolf entered a house and bit two persons. But what appears very singular to me, only one of these persons died. I have always been accustomed to look upon this disease as incurable, but here they have a stone which attracts the poison and when it is applied in time it never fails to cure.&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt; This fact is so well established that I cannot reasonably doubt it, and it should be known far and wide that others may profit by it. Footnote 37:The wolf was common in the area at that time. Way's informant probably included the coyote, with the wolf, as subject to hydrophobia. Footnote 38: An interesting documented instance of the use of a madstone to draw poison from an animal bite. Described by the Encyclopedia Americana as " a vegetable substance or stone which, when applied to a wound caused by the bite of a mad dog, is said to prevent hydrophobia," the madstone has been celebrated in literature (e.g. Sir Walter Scott's The Talisman') and is occasionally chronicled in the annals of Western lore. Some 130 cases of healing, attributed to the madstone, are on record; and there are reported to be three authenticated stones in the United States today. Madstones and Twisters, ed. Mody C. Boatwright, Wilson M. Hudson, and Helen Maxwell (Southern Methodist U. Press, 1958), is reviewed in Arizona and the West, v. 1 (1959), p. 185.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Andrew Morgan||26||♂ ||8 October 2016||Predatory||[[Canmore, Alberta]], Canada|| Andrew was walking home through a forest near [[Banff National Park]] after departing from a bus. He took a shortcut and walked on a path. A few minutes later, he heard some rustling behind him. He noticed that a lone wolf was behind him at that moment. It snarled at him again, but lunged at him afterwards. Andrew turned in the opposite direction and fled from the wolf, but it chased him through the trail. He tried to lose the wolf by going off the trail and through the forest. Andrew fended the wolf with a tree branch multiple times until it released him. He subsequently climbed over a barbed-wire fence, but fell a few times. Andrew finally found his way out of the forest near Holiday Inn in Canmore. The next day, he went to a hospital to get checked over and reported the incident to conservation officers with Alberta Environment and Parks. Officials confirmed this report, but said they could not determine whether it was definitely an actual wolf attack. || [[The Vancouver Sun]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/canmore+attacked+wolf+after+takes+shortcut+through+forest/12404424/story.html|title=Canmore man says he was attacked by a wolf after cutting through forest&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Calgary Herald]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/canmore-man-attacked-by-wolf-after-he-takes-shortcut-through-forest|title=Canmore man attacked by wolf after he takes shortcut through forest|date=19 November 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During that time, the wolves vanished into some bushes.

After the incident, tracks seemed to show that the wolves had come quite close to the woman when she was running, but after she turned to face them, ran off into the bushes and then left, instead of flanking or surrounding her as she had feared.

Before the incident, about forty elk had been watering at a nearby pond and using a nearby hay-field as a wintering ground.

The wolf stopped, stepped back, and attacked at the midsection, still encased in the sleeping bag. Langevin fought it with his hands and arms, and rolled back towards the fire pit. The wolf bit him on the back and head, leaving multiple lacerations and separating a part of his scalp from the skull before being chased away by a group of other campers.

|Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada
|From the Congressional Record [Pages H7152-H7177]:-- "In August, 1996, the Delventhal family of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, were spending a nine-day family vacation in Algonquin and joined a group of Scouts in ``howling&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; at the wolves. They were answered by the howl of a solitary wolf. That night the Delventhals decided to sleep out under the stars. Young Zachariah was dreaming when he suddenly felt excruciating pain in his face. A lone wolf had bit him in the face and was dragging him from his sleeping bag. Zach screamed and Tracy, Zach's Mother, raced to his side and picked him up, saturating her thermal shirt with blood from Zach's wounds. The wolf stood menacingly less than a yard away. Tracy yelled at her husband, Thom, who leapt from his sleeping bag and charged the wolf. The wolf retreated and then charged at Tracy and Zach. The charges were repeated. Finally the wolf left. Thom turned a flashlight on 11-year-old Zach and saw, that the boy's face had been ripped open. His nose was crushed. Parts of his mouth and right cheek were torn and dangling. Blood gushed from puncture wounds below his eyes, and the lower part of his right ear was missing. Zach was taken to a hospital in Toronto where a plastic surgeon performed four hours of reconstructive surgery. Zach received more than 80 stitches in his face. Canadian officials baited the Delventhals' campsite and captured and destroyed a 60-lb wild male wolf. No further &amp;nbsp;attacks have occurred since.

|Tabitha Mullin|| ||♀ ||June 1995 ||[[Agonistic behaviour|Agonistic]]||[[Ellesmere Island]], [[Nunavut]], Canada ||A wildlife biologist, Mullin was standing about five paces outside her front door on the [[Park warden]]'s base, observing and recording a pack of eleven wolves who approached and stopped inside 10 meters. One circled around closer, and she moved back toward the door. When she turned to open the door, the wolf grabbed and pulled her forearm. She pulled back, screamed, and her sleeves ripped; the wolf released; she got inside, closed the door, and the pack left. She suspected photographers had been luring the wolves in with food. She was uninjured.|| [[Alaska Department of Fish and Game]]&lt;ref name="mcnay2002"/&gt;

|Park visitors ||  ||  || 1987&amp;ndash;1998 || || [[Algonquin Provincial Park]], [[Ontario]], Canada || Five incidents, all of which were preceded by extensive [[habituation]]. At first, the incidents were minor. Years later, wolves began stalking children in a predatory fashion. In the first incident, in 1987, a sixteen-year-old girl was only briefly bitten. The attack was classified as "disciplinary", as the girl had shined a torch light into the wolf's eyes at close range just before it attacked. On 4 August 1994 a 9-year old boy received a single puncture wound  and on 1 September an adult woman was bitten once on the leg. The wolf was shot and it tested negative for rabies. &lt;br/&gt;In 1996 a wolf dragged a sleeping bag  2 meters with a 12-year old boy inside. The boy received a broken nose and 6 lacerations on his face that required 80 stitches. The wolf had visited several campsites in previous weeks and tried to grab clothing and equipment.The wolf may have bitten additional people.  On 4 September 1998, a wolf that had been visiting campsites and had attacked three dogs earlier in the summer, approached and circled a family with a 4 year old girl. The father used pepper spray on the wolf and carried his daughter to the car. The next day the wolf attacked a fourth dog. On 27 September the wolf approached a family having a picnic. It grabbed and tossed a nineteen-month-old boy 1 meter. The boy was saved by his parents, but required two stitches.&lt;br&gt; The wolf was shot that afternoon. It was a healthy male with stomach contents scavenged from camps. &lt;br/&gt; In all cases, the wolves were killed, and rabies tests were negative.|| [[Alaska Department of Fish and Game]]&lt;ref name="mcnay2002"/&gt;

|Robert Mulders, Biologist || ||♂ ||13 December 1985 ||Prey-testing [[Agonistic behavior|Agonistic]]||[[Whale Cove, Nunavut]], Canada ||Two biologists netted a [[caribou]] from a helicopter and landed to perform tests and attach a radio collar. While working near the running blades of the helicopter, Mulders saw a young wolf approaching. Both men stood, shouted, and waved their arms. When mulders stepped toward the wolf, it tried to circle around the men to get to the caribou, then rushed in and bit down on Mulders' lower leg and would not let go despite repeated punches by Mulders for 10–15 seconds until the other biologist, Mark Williams, knocked the wolf unconscious with the caribou radio collar. Mulders then took the collar and struck the wolf in the head twice and stabbed it in the chest with a knife. The bite tore open his pants but left only a small wound. It was thought that the wolf may be inexperienced because of its young age. || [[Alaska Department of Fish and Game]]&lt;ref name="mcnay2002"/&gt;

The lead wolf leaped at Dawson's face, but Dawson pushed back with her arms and leaned backwards, pushing the wolf to the ground before it could bite her, and the wolves departed, but the strike was close enough for [[saliva]] from the wolf's [[flews]] to be left on her cheek. Munthe and Hutchinson (1978) interpreted the attack as testing of unfamiliar prey, but noted they didn't know if the wolves had encountered people before.

|Zacarias Hugo||14||♂ ||1943||Possibly rabid|| [[Etivluk River]], Alaska, US || While hunting [[caribou]], Zacarias heard a sound, turned and saw a large black wolf coming for him. It knocked him down and bit his arm, so he could not use his rifle. It bit his legs, back, arm and neck and dragged him 18 metres before abandoning the attack and disappearing. He walked back to camp, but had lost a lot of blood, mostly from his forearm. His caribou skin [[Anorak]] protected him from greater injury or even death, but may have contributed to the attack if it caused the wolf to mistake him for a caribou. This attack had long been classified as "rabid" because it occurred during an [[epizootic]] of the disease in that area and because Zac's father, Inualuruk, tracked the wolf and observed to have been walking at times in the splayed manner of a sick animal. However, the facts that the attack was abandoned in the way it was and that Zacarias never developed the disease are not consistent with rabies. || [[Alaska Department of Fish and Game]]&lt;ref name="mcnay2002"/&gt;

The wolf was not deterred by an approaching train which stopped to help Dusiak. Several railwaymen came running, but the wolf would not retreat. The men killed the wolf with picks and shovels. The carcass was inspected by a biologist, and it appeared healthy. However, Rutter and Pimlot reviewed the case in 1968 and concluded that it must have been rabid because of the sustained and determined nature of the attack.||&lt;ref name="mcnay2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peterson|first1=Randolph L|title=A Record of a Timber Wolf Attacking a Man|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|date=19 August 1947|volume=28 | issue = 3 |pages=294&amp;ndash;295|doi=10.1093/jmammal/28.3.294|url=http://jmammal.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/3/294|accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(-18&amp;nbsp;°F). Early in the morning, a large (61.5 inches long) white female wolf in good flesh but not fat, entered the camp of the Arctic expedition and began fighting with one of the [[tether]]ed [[sled dog]]s. All five  men in the party came out of their tent half naked and tried to drive it away by flapping their shirts. The wolf first attacked Dr. Frits Johansen,  but he was able to shoo it away with his coat flap.   The wolf then charged at Dr. Jenness after he threw a rock and missed. The wolf tried to grab Jenness's bare leg. Jenness grabbed the wolf by the back of the neck, but the wolf turned its head enough to severely bite his forearm. He choked the wolf with his other hand; it released, stepped back, and was shot by Dr. Rudolph Anderson, a mammalogist and the team's leader. The wound to Jenness's arm was so severe it caused Dr. Anderson to suspect the supinator longus muscle was severely cut. The wound was treated and eventually fully healed. Jenness never contracted rabies despite consistency of the wolf's behavior with the early stages of the disease. The scientists suspected the wolf was in heat, which is speculated to have been the reason it was alone. Ironically, Anderson's mission was specimen collection for the National Museum of Canada in Ottawa, where the wolf's mounted remains are presently housed as Specimen No. 2551. The wolf was identified as a new subspecies, ''Canis lupus mckenzii''. || &lt;ref name="mcnay2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jenness|first1=Stuart E.|title=Arctic Wolf Attacks Scientist–A Unique Canadian Incident|journal=Arctic|date=June 1985|volume=32|issue=2|pages=129&amp;ndash;132|url=http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic38-2-129.pdf|accessdate=6 July 2015|doi=10.14430/arctic2122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lüneburg Heath''' ({{lang-de|Lüneburger Heide}}) is a large area of [[heath (habitat)|heath]], [[geest]], and [[woodland]] in the northeastern part of the state of [[Lower Saxony]] in northern [[Germany]]. It forms part of the [[hinterland]] for the cities of [[Hamburg]], [[Hanover]] and [[Bremen]] and is named after the town of [[Lüneburg]]. Most of the area is a [[nature reserve (Germany)|nature reserve]]. [[Northern Low Saxon]] is still widely spoken in the region.

Lüneburg Heath has extensive areas of [[heath (habitat)|heathland]], typical of those that covered most of the North German countryside until about 1800, but which have almost completely disappeared in other areas. The heaths were formed after the [[Neolithic]] period by [[overgrazing]] of the once widespread forests on the poor sandy soils of the [[geest]], as this slightly hilly and sandy terrain in northern Europe is called. Lüneburg Heath is therefore a historic [[cultural landscape]]. The remaining areas of heath are kept clear mainly through grazing, especially by a North German breed of moorland sheep called the [[Heidschnucke]]. Due to its unique landscape, Lüneburg Heath is a popular tourist destination in [[North Germany]].

[[Image:Lüneburger Heide 109.jpg|thumb|[[Heath (habitat)|Sandy heathland]] on Lüneburg Heath]]

From a geographical point of view, Lüneburg Heath is a specific [[natural region]], that is an area distinguished by a specific combination of abiotic factors (climate, relief, water resources, soil, geology) and biotic factors ([[flora]] and [[fauna]]). Lüneburg Heath is a sub-division of the [[North European Plain]]. In the list of the major natural regions of Germany issued by the [[Federal Office for Nature Conservation]] (''Bundesamt für Naturschutz'') it is region number D28.

Lüneburg Heath covers an area which includes the districts ([[Landkreis]]e) of [[Landkreis Celle|Celle]], [[Landkreis Gifhorn|Gifhorn]], [[Landkreis Heidekreis|Heidekreis]], [[Landkreis Uelzen|Uelzen]], [[Landkreis Lüneburg|Lüneburg]], [[Landkreis Lüchow-Dannenberg|Lüchow-Dannenberg]], southeast [[Landkreis Rotenburg (Wümme)|Rotenburg]] (the town of [[Visselhövede]], [[Fintel]], part of the municipality of [[Scheeßel]] and the eastern half of [[Bothel, Lower Saxony|Bothel]]) and the [[Landkreis Harburg|rural district of Harburg]]. The easternmost fringes of the [[Stade Geest]] belonging to [[Landkreis Verden]] are called the [[Linteln Geest]] (''Lintelner Geest'') or [[Verden Heath]] (''Verdener Heide'') and form part of the municipality of [[Kirchlinteln]]. This region has no sharply defined boundary with the Lüneburg Heath.

Lüneburg Heath lies between the rivers [[Elbe]] to the north, the [[Drawehn]] to the east, the [[Aller (Germany)|Aller]] to the south and southwest, the middle course of the [[Wümme]] to the west and the [[Harburg Hills]] (''Harburger Berge'') to the northwest.

On the northwestern edge of Lüneburg Heath are the Harburg Hills and south of [[Schneverdingen]] there are [[bog]]s, such as the [[Pietzmoor]]. Also of note are other smaller bogs in [[sinkhole]]s, like the [[Grundloses Moor]] ("bottomless bog") near Walsrode or the [[Bullenkuhle (Moor)|Bullenkuhle]] near Bokel (part of [[Sprakensehl]]). The eastern boundary to the [[Hanoverian Wendland|Wendland]] is formed by the [[Göhrde]]-[[Drawehn]] Hills (the Ostheide natural region). Parts of Lüneburg Heath are in the ''[[Südheide Nature Park]]'', others in the [[Lüneburg Heath Nature Park]].

=== Hills and elevations ===
[[Image:Wilseder Berg 005.jpg|left|thumb|[[Wilseder Berg]]]]
The highest elevation on Lüneburg Heath is the [[Wilseder Berg]] ({{convert|169.2|m|ft}}) above [[Normalnull|NN]]). Other hills over {{convert|100|m|ft}} high are: [[Falkenberg (Lüneburger Heide)|Falkenberg]] ({{convert|150|m|ft}}), near [[Bergen (Landkreis Celle)|Bergen]], Ahrberg ({{convert|145|m|ft}}), Hakenberg ({{convert|143|m|ft}}), [[Hoher Mechtin]] ({{convert|142|m|ft}}), Pampower Berg ({{convert|140|m|ft}}), Lüßberg ({{convert|130|m|ft}}), [[Brunsberg (Harburg)|Brunsberg]], near [[Sprötze]] ({{convert|129|m|ft}}), Goldbockenberg ({{convert|129|m|ft}}), Hingstberg ({{convert|126|m|ft}}), Staffelberg ({{convert|126|m|ft}}), Hengstberg ({{convert|121|m|ft}}), Höpenberg near Schneverdingen ({{convert|120|m|ft}}), [[Haußelberg]] ({{convert|119.1|m|ft}}), Breithorn ({{convert|118|m|ft}}), Mützenberg ({{convert|115|m|ft}}), Tellmer Berg ({{convert|113|m|ft}}), Wümmeberg ({{convert|107.9|m|ft}}), Schiffberg ({{convert|107|m|ft}}), Hummelsberg and Wulfsberg (each {{convert|106|m|ft}}), Drullberg and Thonhopsberg (each {{convert|104|m|ft}}), Kruckberg and [[Wietzer Berg]] (each {{convert|102|m|ft}}) and Höllenberg ({{convert|101|m|ft}}).

Several of these hills - the Wilseder Berg, the Falkenberg, the Haußelberg and the Breithorn - were used by the mathematician, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], as [[triangulation station]]s in his topographical surveys of the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] from 1821–1825.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webdoc.sub.gwdg.de/ebook/e/2005/gausscd/html/kapitel_landv_karte.htm gwdg.de – Overview of surveyed triangulation systems]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rivers and streams ===
Rivers in the area, beside the numerous small heathland streams, include the [[Wümme]], which rises on the western slopes of the Wilseder Berg, in the south the [[Lachte]] with its tributary the [[Lutter (Lachte)|Lutter]], and the [[Aller (Germany)|Aller]], the [[Vissel]], the [[Böhme (river)|Böhme]], the [[Grindau]], the [[Meiße]] and the [[Örtze]]. They all belong to the [[Weser]] river system. Those flowing into the [[Elbe]] are the [[Aue (Elbe)|Aue]], the [[Ilmenau River|Ilmenau]], the [[Luhe (Ilmenau)|Luhe]] and the [[Seeve]].

=== Geology ===
The immediate subsurface layers on Lüneburg Heath are almost exclusively made up of deposits from the [[quaternary ice age]]. The landscape consists of flat plains of [[ground moraine]]s, ridges of hilly [[terminal moraine]]s and also of [[sandar]] - glacial outwash plains deposited at the edge of the ice sheet.

During the Saalian Stage (230,000–130,000 years ago) the area of the present-day Lüneburg Heath was covered three times by a continental ice sheet. In the last glacial period (110,000–10,000 years ago) the ice sheet no longer covered the Lüneburg Heath area; it reached only as far as the [[River Elbe]]. Due to the lack of vegetation, the much more rugged terrain at that time was heavily eroded by water, wind and by [[soil fluction]]; this resulted in valleys like the Totengrund. The material displaced by [[erosion]], referred to as [[sediment]] (''Geschiebedecksand''), has a depth of 0.4 to 0.8 metres (on slopes up to 1.5 metres).

''See also:'' [[Drawehn]], [[Bullenkuhle]], [[Kieselgur]].

The region is mostly covered by a [[heath (habitat)|heathland]] landscape consisting of big [[Calluna|heather]] and [[Juniperus communis|juniper]] areas, forests and some smaller [[swamp]]s. In contrast to the areas in the north of Lüneburg Heath, the landscape is very hilly, as it is placed on a [[terminal moraine]].

=== Natural divisions ===
Lüneburg Heath is divided into the following natural sub-divisions:
* Hohe Heide
:The Hohe Heide ("High Heath") consists of a series of [[end moraine]]s from the [[glacier]]s of the [[Saalian glaciation]] (230,000–130,000 years ago) with the  [[Wilseder Berg]] at its heart. Unlike the other natural divisions of Lüneburg Heath, the terrain is quite rugged. Characteristic of the area are dry hilltops, periglacial dry valleys and hollows like the Totengrund. Heathland dominates the landscape. They are part of the [[Lüneburg Heath Nature Park]] and of great importance for tourism. In addition there are also extensive pine forests.
* [[Südheide Nature Park|South Heath]]
:The South Heath (''Südheide'') is dominated by expanses of gently undulating, hilly [[Sander]] plains, and sheets of [[ground moraine]] and the remains of [[end moraine]]s from earlier [[ice age]]s. There are still large areas of heath on the [[Bergen-Hohne Training Area|military training areas near Bad Fallingbostel]] and [[Munster Training Area|Munster (Örtze)]]; these are out-of-bounds to visitors however. The [[Osterheide]] near [[Schneverdingen]] also belongs to this natural subdivision. It is part of the [[Lüneburg Heath Nature Reserve]]. Near Schneverdingen and south of [[Soltau]] there are several bogs. A large area of the  Südheide is covered by pine forests.
* [[Ostheide]]
:Numerous end moraines run through the Ostheide ("East Heath") which stretches on the eastern edge of Lüneburg Heath from Lüneburg to north of Wolfsburg. In parts of this region the land is intensively cultivated. The northern area, the so-called [[Göhrde]] and the [[Drawehn]], are by contrast mostly wooded like the southern ridge of end moraine.
* Uelzen Basin and Ilmenau depression
:The [[ground moraine]] landscape of the [[Uelzen]] Basin is predominantly used for agriculture. On the surrounding ridges there are also a few pine forests however. There are still large areas of heath here as well, for example the ''Ellerndorfer Heide'' ("Ellerndorf Heath")  in western [[Uelzen district]] or the ''Klein Bünstorfer Heide'' ("Klein Bünstorf Heath").
* Luheheide
:The ridges of end moraine on the Luheheide have clearly defined slopes that fall away sharply to the [[Elbe Valley]]. The heath is deeply incised by all the rivers that drain northwards to the [[Elbe]]; rivers such as the [[Seeve]], [[Aue (Elbe)|Aue]], [[Luhe (Ilmenau)]]. The ridges between them are wooded and sparsely populated. Settlements are crowded together in the valleys. There is hardly any heathland left in this area, it has been largely reforested by [[pine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;cf.

[[Image:Klima soltau.png|thumb|Climatic diagram for Soltau]]

=== Climate ===
Lüneburg Heath lies in a temperate maritime climatic region moderated by the Atlantic, with mild winters, cool summers and precipitation all-year round. The Hohe Heide, however, has a "low mountain climate" with lower temperatures and higher precipitation than in the surrounding area.

=== Nature parks and nature reserves ===
[[Image:Karte Naturpark Lüneburger Heide.png|thumb|Location of the Lüneburg Heath Nature Park]]

In the northwestern part of Lüneburg Heath is the [[Lüneburg Heath Nature Park]] which covers an area of {{convert|1130|km2|sqmi}}. At its heart, around the [[Wilseder Berg]], is the [[Lüneburg Heath Nature Reserve]] (''Naturschutzgebiet'' or NSG) founded as long ago as 1921 with {{convert|234|km2|sqmi}} of land which is roughly 58% woods and 20% heathland. Other nature parks in the Lüneburg Heath region are the [[Südheide Nature Park]] and [[Elbufer-Drawehn Nature Park]]. Right in the north of the area is the [[Harburg Hills]] Nature Park. The Lüneburg Heath NSG, together with the open heathland of the huge [[Munster Training Area|Munster Nord and Süd training areas]] and the [[Bergen-Hohne Training Area]], is the largest single area of heathland in [[Central Europe]]. And within the former province (''Regierungsbezirk'') of Lüneburg there are no less than 212 individual [[nature reserves]] (as at 31 December 2006).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nlwkn.niedersachsen.de/master/C8425268_N8378167_L20_D0_I5231158.html nlwkn.niedersachsen.de – Nature reserves in Lower Saxony]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of the [[Weichselian Ice Age]] (115,000 to 10,000 years ago) the first woods appeared in the area that now forms Lüneburg Heath which, following the natural [[ecological succession]] and encouraged by a gradual improvement in the climate, progressed from [[birch]] and [[pine trees|pine forest]] through [[hazel]] woods to light woods of [[sessile oak]]s.

The heath and its surrounding area belong to those regions of the [[North German Plain]] in which the hunter culture of the [[Mesolithic]] era was superseded quite early on by [[Neolithic]] farmers. By about 3000 BC, during the Neolithic, large open areas appeared on the lightly undulating, sandy stretches of [[Geest (topography)|geest]] on Lüneburg Heath. This was a result of the intensive grazing of the sessile oak woods and the associated destruction of successive new stands of trees. These open areas became dominated by the [[common heather]] (''Calluna vulgaris''), a largely grazing-resistant species of plant. Nevertheless, oak and beech woods succeeded time and again in establishing themselves wherever man left areas of heath untended. Over a long period of time the region of Lüneburg Heath alternated between periods when the heathlands spread and dominated the scene and times when it was largely covered with forest and only small areas of heath existed. Finally, after the [[migration period]], the wooded areas of the region increased considerably.&lt;ref&gt;Heinz Ellenberg: ''Vegetation Mitteleuropas mit den Alpen in ökologischer, dynamischer und historischer Sicht'', Stuttgart 1996, p. 721&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Steingrund 009.jpg|thumb|Herd of ''[[Heidschnucke]]n'' (moorland sheep)]]
[[File:E Vollmer – Schafstall 1904.jpg|thumb|The sheep-cote – a distinctive building now rarely preserved, painting by Erwin Vollmer, 1904]]
Not until after 1000 AD does the [[pollen analysis]] show a continuous reduction in the woodlands and a considerable increase in [[Calluna|heather]]. This was brought about by a change from nomadic farming to settled farming with permanent settlements. The typical heath farming economy emerged: due to the poor soils the few available nutrients from a large area were concentrated on relatively small fields, from which grain, in particular, could be produced. This was achieved by the regular removal of the turf (a method known as [[Plaggen]]), which  was used as hay for the pens of the moorland sheep, the [[Heidschnucke]]n. This was then enriched with the manure and urine of the sheep – and spread over the fields as fertiliser.

By cutting the turf the regenerative capacity of the soils was exhausted. The regular removal of the top layer of soil contributed to the spreading of heathland. As heather decomposes, the [[pH value]] of the soil falls drastically, as far as the iron buffer-region at pH 3, which initiates the process of [[podsolisation]]. Soil life is severely damaged, which results in a hard layer of earth underneath the root zone on the heath at a depth of about {{convert|40|cm|in}}. The iron and humus particles released by the topsoil precipitate onto this impervious [[hardpan]]. The subsoil thus separates itself from the topsoil. The nutrients are largely washed out of the topsoil which leads to leaching and causes the typical grey-white coloration of the paths on the heath.

The oft-expressed view in the literature that the heath arose in the [[Middle Ages]] as a result of the demand for wood by the  Lüneburg [[Salt evaporation pond|salt pan]]s is incorrect. The Lüneburg salt ponds certainly needed firewood for the production of [[table salt|salt]], but they did not appear until around 1000 AD, by which time the heath had already been around for 4,000 years. The amount required, even in the heyday of production, could have been continuously supplied by an area of woodland about 50&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in area, yet the heath covers over 7000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In any case the wood certainly did not come from the heath, but via the waterways, especially from [[Mecklenburg]] up the Elbe and from the area of the [[Schaalsee]]. Transportation overland would have been far too expensive (apart from the [[River Ilmenau]] which was navigable at the time, no rivers flow from the main areas of heathland to Lüneburg), as can be seen not only from some of the delivery notes which still survive, but also from the fact that there are still large woods around Lüneburg itself, such as the [[Göhrde]]. Finally heathland has frequentely developed in areas where there are no salt pans, such as the sheep-grazing regions on the coasts of Norway to Portugal and in Scotland and Ireland.

The heath is not therefore a [[natural landscape]], but a [[cultural landscape]] created by the intervention of man. In order to prevent its semi-open heathland from being repopulated by trees, especially [[pine]]s and, to a lesser extent, [[silver birch]]es, which would cause the loss of this millennia-old environment and its many inhabitants, including often very rare animal and plant species, sheep are allowed to graze it regularly; these are almost exclusively the local German moorland sheep, the [[Heidschnucke]].

=== Plant population/Phytocenosis ===
In the 20th century, numerous conservation measures were implemented on Lüneburg Heath; as a result, it is one of the best researched regions of central Europe.

==== Heathland ====
Sand heaths form about 20% of the Lüneburg Heath Nature Reserve and may be broken down into further sub-divisions, the most important being:

[[Image:Lüneburger Heide 096.jpg|thumb|Typical sandy heath near Wilsede]]

;Ordinary sand heath (''Typische Sandheide'', Genisto-Callunetum)
*In addition to the [[common heather]] (''Calluna vulgaris'') only a few taller plants occur here, none of which can be classed as characteristic species. Amongst them are the [[wavy hair-grass]] (''Deschampsia flexuosa'') and [[common juniper]] (''Juniperus communis''). Ordinary sand heath is the most widespread of the heathland types. Its proportion has increased in recent decades at the expense of other heath habitats. This reduction in the variety of heathland types may be due to increasing nitrogen levels from the air, the increase in plant litter (''Rohhumusauflagen'') and the natural ageing of the heathland.

;Lichen-rich sand heath (''Flechtenreiche Sandheide'', Genisto-Callunetum cladonietosum)
*The lichen-rich sand heaths can be told apart from the other types of heathland by the presence of various [[Cladonia|cup lichens]] (''[[Cladonia]]''), [[Marchantiophyta|ciliated fringewort]] (''Ptilidium ciliare'') and [[Polytrichaceae|juniper haircap]] (''Polytrichum juniperinum''). They occur frequently on dry, south-facing slopes. This type of heath is found west of Niederhaverbeck and near Sundermühlen.

;Clay heath (''Lehmheide'', Genisto-callunetum danthonietusum)
*This can be identified by the presence of [[Danthonia decumbens|heath grass]] (''Danthonia decumbens''), [[Carex pilulifera|pill sedge]] (''Carex pilulifera''), [[mat grass]] (''Nardus stricta''), [[List of the vascular plants of Britain and Ireland 8|fine-leaved sheep's-fescue]] (''Festuca filiformis''), [[mouse-ear hawkweed]] (''Hieracium pilosella'') and [[field wood-rush]] (''Luzula campestris''). Clay heaths have become very rare within the Lüneburg Heath. They are found on the [[Wilseder Berg]] and south of Niederhaverbeck.

;Blueberry sand heath (''Heidelbeer-Sandheide'', Genisto-Callunetum, Vaccinium myrtillus Rasse)
*[[Blueberry|Blueberries]] (''Vaccinium myrtillus'') are the signature species of this type of heath and, more rarely,  [[Vaccinium vitis-idaea|cranberries]] (''Vaccinium vitis-idaea''). Blueberry heath is the second most common type of vegetation on the heathlands and occurs especially on northern slopes, the edges of woods and thick juniper hedges. This type of heath is particularly characteristic of the northern slopes of the [[Wilseder Berg]], as well as the Steingrund and Totengrund. In those places, cranberries have even ousted the [[Calluna|common heather]] (''Calluna vulgaris'') in places.

;Wet sand heath (''Feuchte Sandheide'', Genisto-Callunetum, Molinia-Variante)
*Wet sand heath is the ideal habitat for [[purple moor grass]] (''Molinia caerulea''), [[cross-leaved heath]] (''Erica tetralix'') and [[scirpus]] (''Scirpus cespitosus''). It occurs in places close to the water table and in the transition zone around bogs. Its primary locations are areas north of Wilsede and near the Hörpel Ponds (''Hörpeler Teichen'').&lt;ref&gt;cf. Herrmann Cordes u.a.: ''Naturschutzgebiet Lüneburger Heide.'' Bremen 1997, S. 163ff&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Woods ====

[[Image:Lüneburger Heide - Hutewald 001.jpg|thumb|The ''Hutewald'' ([[wood pasture]]) near Wilsede]]
[[Image:Lüneburger Heide 011.jpg|thumb|Old coppices (''Stühbüsche'') near Niederhaverbeck]]
The greater part (about 58%) of the Lüneburg Heath Nature Reserve consists of woods, primarily [[pine]] forests, which were planted in the second half of the 19th century on former heathland and drifting sand. In some cases the dunes simply became naturally overgrown, again with pines. There are only a very few old stands of [[sessile oak]]s, which stem from the logging industry during the time of the [[Kingdom of Hanover]]. In many parts of the nature reserve there are so-called ''Stühbüsche'' (a form of coppice), trees that were coppiced by repeatedly being cut short. In the meantime they have grown wild again and have a characteristic and unusual appearance with their multiple trunks. Near [[Bispingen|Wilsede]] there is the remnant of a [[Hutewald]], a wood pasture with giant, multi-stemmed [[beech tree]]s.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Herrmann Cordes u.a.: ''Naturschutzgebiet Lüneburger Heide.'' Bremen 1997, p. 113ff&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bogs ====
The largest bog on Lüneburg Heath is the [[Pietzmoor]], which lies east of [[Schneverdingen]]. It was drained however and peat was cut there until the 1960s. The Nature Park Association carried out work in the 1980s to try to turn it back to its natural waterlogged state. For example, some of the drainage ditches were filled which led to a considerable rise in the water levels of the former peat cuts. However typical bog vegetation has not yet re-established itself.&lt;ref&gt;VNP–Schriften 1: ''14 Jahre Naturschutzgroßprojekt Lüneburger Heide.'' Niederhaverbeck 2007, S. 92ff&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Animals ===
Many species of animal live on Lüneburg Heath, particularly birds that are at home in the wide, open landscape, some of which are seriously threatened by the intensive-farming techniques in other areas. These include the: [[black grouse]] (''Tetrao tetrix''), the [[nightjar]] (''Caprimulgus europaeus''), the [[woodlark]] (''Lullula arborea''), the [[great grey shrike]] (''Lanius excubitor''), the [[red-backed shrike]] (''Lanius collurio''), the [[northern wheatear]] (''Oenanthe oenanthe''), the [[wryneck]] (''Jynx torquilla''), the [[European green woodpecker]] (''Picus viridis''), the [[African stonechat|stonechat]] (''Saxicola torquata''), the [[Eurasian curlew]] (''Numenius arquata''), the [[common quail]] (''Coturnix coturnix'') and the [[black stork]] (''Ciconia nigra'').&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Kleinburg, Johannes Prüter: ''Naturschutzgebiet Lüneburger Heide.'' Schneverdingen 2006, p. 22ff und Herrmann Cordes u.a.: ''Naturschutzgebiet Lüneburger Heide.'' Bremen 1997, p. 209ff&lt;/ref&gt; In the Lüneburg Heath the population of the very rare black grouse is rising continually. In 2007 78 were counted, 13 more than in the previous year. Since 2003 the number of grouse has doubled.

Wolves, although once extinct in the area, have returned to the Lüneburg Heath.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/niedersachsen/Chronologie-Der-Wolf-in-Niedersachsen-ab-2015,woelfe281.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wildtiermanagement.com/wildtiere/haarwild/wolf/wolfsnachweise_in_niedersachsen&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous species including [[European bison]], [[moose]] and [[brown bear]] which once inhabited the region may be seen in the [[Lüneburg Heath Wildlife Park]] alongside more exotic animals like [[snow leopard]]s and [[Arctic wolf|Arctic wolves]].

[[Image:Siebensteinhaeuser grab d-2.jpg|thumb|left|''Sieben Steinhäuser'', Grave D]]
[[Image:Lüneburger Heide - Hügelgräber 001.jpg|thumb|Tumuli on Lüneburg Heath]]

=== Early history ===
[[Palynology|Pollen analyses]] show that the dry geest soils of North Germany have been cultivated since about 3000 BC. Clearance by fire and the cultivation of crops on the [[Pleistocene]] sandy soils quickly led however to [[soil degradation]]. So the land cleared by fire could only be used for a short time. The settlements moved frequently and woods elsewhere were cleared. Even at that time the first [[Calluna]] (heather) heaths appeared.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hansjörg Küster: ''Geschichte der Landschaft in Mitteleuropa.'' p. 101ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of relatively dense settlement is found especially in [[Uelzen district]]. On Lüneburg Heath there are numerous [[Megalithic]] sites and [[tumuli]] from the [[Neolithic]] and the early [[Bronze Age]]. The most famous are the ''[[Oldendorfer Totenstatt]]'' (Oldendorf Grave site) and the ''[[Sieben Steinhäuser]]'' (Seven Stone Houses). But even in the Lüneburg Heath Nature Reserve there are more than a thousand tumuli, especially near Nieder- and Oberhaverbeck. The largest of these tumuli is the so-called Prince's Grave (''Fürstengrab''). Also near Wilsede there is the well-known stone and juniper group known as Hannibal's Grave (''Hannibals Grab'').&lt;ref&gt;cf. Herrmann Cordes u.a. (Hrsg.): ''Naturschutzgebiet Lüneburger Heide'', p. 49ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transition to settlement culture ===
After the withdrawal of the [[Lombards]] in the [[migration period]], from about 700 AD Lüneburg Heath belonged to the [[Duchy of Saxony]], which was conquered by [[Charlemagne]] in the 9th century and became part of the [[Frankish Empire]]. The resulting close control of the population and the [[Christianization]] meant that the rural settlements had to stay in one place and could no longer move about freely. The land had to be farmed more intensively which led to the heathland spreading.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hansjörg Küster: ''Geschichte der Landschaft in Mitteleuropa.'' S. 163ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Settlements ===
[[Image:Dat ole Hus 003.jpg|thumb|Wilsede Heath Museum – a typical timber-framed hall house (''[[Fachhallenhaus]]'')]]
Lüneburg Heath was always relatively sparsely populated due to the poor soils in the area. The region was dominated by heath farming which was a less intensive form of land usage necessary for its large areas of barren terrain and heathland. An important economic sideline of past centuries was heathland [[beekeeping]].&lt;ref&gt;see also: [[Naturpark Südheide#Heideimkerei|Heath beekeeping in Südheide Nature Park]]&lt;/ref&gt; The villages were usually encircled by small tracts of woodland, sometimes interrupted by fields or meadows, and merged without clear boundaries into the surrounding landscape. The farmsteads were arranged relatively arbitrarily, many stood very close to one another; others were spread out at some distance from each other. They were loose cluster villages (''lockere Haufendörfer''). In order to prevent cattle trampling flat the gardens attached to the houses, village roads were enclosed with wooden fences and, later, with characteristic stone walls. The typical design of farmhouse was the ''[[Fachhallenhaus]]'', a large timber-framed single building, in which people and animals lived under a single roof. Each village had relatively few complete farms; in [[Bispingen|Wilsede]] there were only four, in the church village (Kirchdorf) of [[Undeloh]] there were eleven, but that was an exception. In addition there were Koten (small, single houses), sheep pens and shared bakehouses. The farms themselves, however, were very large. In Wilsede all the features of a heath village described here may still be seen. [[Wilsede Heath Museum]] (Heidemuseum Wilsede) was established in a ''Fachhallenhaus'' and it gives an insight into the working and living conditions of a heathland farm around 1850.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Herrmann Cordes u.&amp;nbsp;a. (Hrsg.): ''Naturschutzgebiet Lüneburger Heide'' S. 73ff.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rischmannshof Heath Museum|Walsrode Heath Museum]] was one of the first German open air museums and also portrays the life of heathland folk. In rural parts of the region they still sometimes use today a [[Low German]] dialect called ''Heidjerisch''. This word derives from the name given to inhabitants of the Lüneburg Heath – the ''Heidjer''.

=== Heath convents ===
In the Lüneburg Heath region, six [[nunneries]] from the [[Middle Ages]] survived, which became Protestant convents after the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. These establishments are the abbeys of: [[Ebstorf Abbey|Ebstorf]], [[Isenhagen Abbey|Isenhagen]], [[Lüne Abbey|Lüne]], [[Medingen (Bad Bevensen)|Medingen]], [[Wienhausen Abbey|Wienhausen]] and [[Walsrode Abbey|Walsrode]].

=== The end of heathland farming in the 19th century ===

[[Image:Lüneburger Heide - 071.jpg|thumb|Pine forest]]
[[File:Heidelandschaft bei Wilsede, Ölgemälde 1912.jpg|thumb|''Heath Landscape'', painting by [[Arnold Lyongrün]] (1912)]]
From 1831 [[feudalism]] was abolished in the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] and those heathland areas that were [[common land]] for the villages were divided amongst the individual farmers. Heathland farming died out at the end of the 19th century. Many farmers sold their land to the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]n treasury or the Hanover monastic chamber, who afforested the land with pines. As a result, the area of heath was drastically reduced.

In 1800, large parts of Northwest Germany had been covered with heaths and bog. Today, by contrast the only large, continuous areas of heath remaining are in the Lüneburg Heath Nature Reserve and on a few [[military training area]]s.

=== The changing perception of the heath ===
[[File:E Vollmer – Heidewege 1942.jpg|thumb|The heath in late autumn&lt;br/&gt;painting by Erwin Vollmer, 1942]]
As late as the turn of the 18th to the 19th century, the barren and almost treeless heathlands were still perceived as hostile and threatening environments, as evinced by two travel logs of journeys between 1799 and 1804:

{{quote|''As I had traversed the Hanoverian dominions in so many directions, I did not expect to find nature clothed in charms, or a high degree of population, fertility, and cultivation. Next to Lauenburg, I think it is the worst tract of an equal extent that I ever met with. The soil is one vast sandy desert, which is either naturally bare, or covered with patches of heath or grass.''}}

{{quote|''On leaving [[Celle|Zell]] we passed through a dark wood, of at least two leagues in extent; and from that city to [[Harburg (quarter)|Harburgh]], in a line of nearly twenty German miles, we travelled over sandy plains and extensive heaths. At a great distance, geese, ducks and sheep of a very poor appearance, never failed to indicate the vicinity of some wretched hamlet. What habitations! Whole families, of the most wretched appearance, and covered with tattered garments, associate together, eat and sleep with their cattle. Near these real catacombs we observed growing a few stalks of rye and barley, and here and there a few tufu of buck-wheat. The straw is short and stunted, and the ears of a diminutive size. Population and agriculture must ever be dependant on each other.''}}

The poem ''Der Heideknabe'' ("The Heath Lad") from the year 1844 by [[Friedrich Hebbel]] stresses the unearthly atmosphere and the bleak solitude of the heaths:

{{quote|'':(...) Out, out of the town! And there it stretches,
:''The heath, misty, ghostly,''
:''The wind swishing over it,''
:''Oh, every step here is like a thousand others!''

:''And all so still, and all so quiet,''
:''You look around for signs of life,''
:''Only hungry birds dart by''
:''Out of the clouds, to spear worms (...).''}}

Towards the middle of the 19th century the first positive descriptions of the heath emerged, initially inspired by the [[romanticism|romantic]] movement. With the [[Industrial Revolution]] in Germany, unspoilt nature became more important for people, providing a welcome contrast with the rapidly burgeoning cities. Because the heathlands of North Germany were being increasingly decimated by cultivation and reforestation, they now appeared to be worth protecting. Numerous writers and painters portrayed the beauty of the heath, particularly when it was in bloom in August and September. One important heathland artist was Eugen Bracht. The most famous heath poet was the local writer [[Hermann Löns]] (1866–1914), who spent some time living in a hunting lodge near [[Westenholz]]. He worked the heath countryside into his books and promoted the foundation of the first German [[nature reserve]] on Lüneburg Heath. His purported remains were buried in a juniper copse at Tietlingen near Walsrode in 1935. His works were a source for [[Heimatfilm]]e that were shot on Lüneburg Heath, such as ''Grün ist die Heide'' ("The Heath Is Green") from [[The Heath Is Green (1932 film)|1932]] and remade in [[The Heath Is Green (1951 film)|1951]] and [[The Heath Is Green (1972 film)|1972]], as well as ''Rot ist die Liebe'' ("Red is Love") from 1956.

=== History of conservation on Lüneburg Heath ===
Around 1900, there were growing demands to save the heathland and bogs of northwest Germany, which were threatened by reforestation and drainage. On Lüneburg Heath, Wilhelm Bode, then the [[pastor]] at [[Egestorf]], was particularly active in pressing for the preservation of the endangered countryside. He had learned in 1905 of plans for building weekend houses on the Totengrund. In order to prevent this, he persuaded Andreas Thomsen, a professor from [[Münster (Westfalen)|Münster]], to acquire the area as a nature reserve. In 1909, Pastor Bode and district administrator (''Landrat'') Fritz Ecker prevented the planned reforestation of the Wilseder Berg.

[[Image:Lüneburger Heide 1960 002.jpg|thumb|left|Totengrund around 1960]]
In the same year, an appeal by Curt Floerike appeared in Kosmos magazine, citing the establishment of [[national parks]] in the United States and calling for them in Germany. In order to realise this goal, the Nature Park Society or Verein Naturschutzpark (VNP) was founded in [[Munich]] on 23 October 1909. They planned to create [[national park]]s in the [[Alps]], the [[Central Uplands]] and in the north German [[Geest (topography)|geest]] region. By 1913, the society had 13,000 members.

The area of Lüneburg Heath near [[Bispingen|Wilsede]] was selected as the location for the north German national park. Using the VNP's funds, more than 30&amp;nbsp;km² of heathland were purchased or rented by 1913. In 1921, a police ordinance placed more than 200&amp;nbsp;km² of Lüneburg Heath under protection, the first time this had been achieved in Germany. One problem that arose as early as the 1920s was the steadily increasing number of visitors. In 1924, in order to keep visitors away from sensitive areas of heathland, a volunteer Heath Guard (''Heidewacht'') was founded.

The Reich conservation law was passed in 1933 and Lüneburg Heath was designated as an official nature reserve. Although plans to build a motorway through the park and for the heath to be used as a [[military training area]] were stopped, in 1933 the ''Heidewacht'' was disbanded, mainly because it was made up of members of social democratic youth organisations. In 1939, a new law that granted the chairman of the VNP – now called Führer – wide-ranging powers. [[Jew]]s could no longer be members of the society.

[[Image:Lüneburger Heide 1960 003.jpg|thumb|Tank tracks near Wilsede]]
Between 1891 and the [[Second World War]], large military training areas were established on Lüneburg Heath, including the largest one in Europe, the [[Bergen-Hohne Training Area]] on the ''Südheide''. Here the heathland has largely been preserved, albeit no longer accessible to the general public.

A large area of the nature park belonging to the society near [[Schneverdingen]] was taken over by the [[British Army of the Rhine]] in 1945 for use as a tank training area. In the 1950s, during military exercises, British tanks even pushed forward as far as the  Wilseder Berg. Not until the [[Soltau-Lüneburg Agreement]], was signed in 1959 between the [[Federal Republic of Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Canada]], were the boundaries of the tank training area fixed. Continual exercising over the area by armoured vehicles completely destroyed the vegetation on the Osterheide near [[Schneverdingen]], forming large areas of sand dunes. In 1994, the British returned the so-called "Red Areas" of the [[Soltau-Lüneburg Training Area]] to the Nature Park Society who, with the help of money from the federal government, set about the work of renaturation. Nowadays hardly any traces of the tank training area are left. The base camp for military exercises, [[Reinsehlen Camp]], has been turned into a nature reserve.

=== Forest fire ===
In August 1975, fire broke out on the [[Südheide Nature Park|''Südheide'']] which turned out to be the biggest forest fire in West Germany to that date.
Serious forest fires broke out in the southern part of the area near [[Sassenburg-Stüde|Stüde]], [[Neudorf-Platendorf]], [[Meinersen]] and then by [[Eschede]] near [[Celle]], with devastating effects and fatalities.

== German surrender at the end of the Second World War ==
{{main|German surrender at Lüneburg Heath}}
The heath was the scene of the [[unconditional surrender]] of German forces in the Netherlands, north west Germany, including all islands, Denmark and all naval ships in those areas to the Allies under [[Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]], on 4 May 1945, at the [[end of World War II in Europe|end of the Second World War in Europe]]. It is also the area where the body of [[Heinrich Himmler]], a leading figure in [[Nazi Germany]] and head of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], was secretly buried in an unmarked grave following his suicide.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6019">A '''mapathon''' is a coordinated mapping event. The public is invited to make online map improvements in their local area to improve coverage and to help disaster risk assessment and energy management. 
Mapathons use an online site for storing map data, for example, [[Google Maps]] and [[OpenStreetMap]]. A mapathon is organized by a respective organization or a [[non-profit organisation]] or local government.

Mapathons are often held inside (armchair mapping) in a room with strong [[Wi-Fi]] for simultaneous access, assisted by [[satellite]] imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missingmaps.org/host/|title=Hosting a Mapathon|accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mapathons can also be an outside activity with online simultaneous map editing assisted by [[global positioning system]] trackers on mobile devices.

== History ==
[[File:Missing maps mapathons 2016 November.png|thumb|Missing maps mapathon events distribution for November, 2016. Image by OpenStreetMap and Missing Maps.]]

In 2009, in [[Atlanta]], the capital of the US state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[United States]], about 200 volunteers walked around the city with [[GPS]]-enabled devices and expanded [[OpenStreetMap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8305924.stm|title=US city to start giant 'mapathon'|publisher=BBC News|date=October 14, 2009|accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google Mapathon is an annual event organized by [[Google]] that invites the public to make improvements to [[Google Maps]], through the [[Google Map Maker]].

In February and March, 2013, in [[India]], volunteers mapped local areas on Google Maps. The prizes included [[Samsung Galaxy Note]] tablets. Some locals, including the competition winner Vishal Saini, mapped sensitive military installations in [[Pathankot]]. In March 2013, a right-wing [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] [[member of parliament]] Tarun Vijay told authorities that mapping the area was against India's national map policy. Delhi police investigated the incident. [[Survey of India]], an Indian government mapping agency, contacted Google. Google responded by denying the claim and asserting that the mapping was legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com.au/tech/computing/how-googles-mapathon-may-have-compromised-indias-national-security,390446|title=How Google's Mapathon May Have Compromised India's National Security|date=July 30, 2014|accessdate=October 30, 2016|publisher=Australian Popular Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/google-didnt-take-permission-for-mapathon/article4648589.ece|title=Google didn’t take permission for Mapathon|date=April 24, 2013|accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/why-is-googles-mapathon-in-hot-waters-in-india-all-you-need-to-know-228810.html|title=Why is Google’s Mapathon in hot waters in India? All you need to know|date=August 12, 2014|publisher=tech2|accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, following an attack on the military structures in Pathankot, the [[Delhi High Court]] ruled Google to appear in Court in February, but did not make any rulings restricting Google from continuing to host the map data online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/indian-defence-installations-on-google-maps-hc-asks-govt-to-look-into-it/195126/|title=Indian defense installations on Google maps: HC asks govt to look into it|date=January 15, 2016|accessdate=October 30, 2016|publisher=[[The Financial Express (India)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, after a 7.9 earthquake in [[Nepal]], online volunteers expanded the map of Nepal for two weeks. They mapped 4000 mapping volunteers have edited 91,951 times, 29,798 segments of road and 243,500 buildings, and also expanded maps of Botswana and Philippines. The project was supported by MapGive and by the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team.&lt;ref name="white house"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/05/28/citizen-cartographers-unite-report-first-white-house-mapathon|title=Citizen Cartographers Unite: Report from the First White House Mapathon|publisher=[[White House]]|date=|authors=Megan Smith, Mikel Maron|accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.state.gov/stories/2015/05/08/want-help-nepal-volunteer-mappers-can-make-difference#|title=Want To Help Nepal? Volunteer Mappers Can Make A Difference|date=May 8, 2015|author=Benson Wilder and Mikel Maron|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, in [[White House]] in [[United States]], about 80 volunteers edited added more than 400 roads and 1,000 buildings in OpenStreetMap. The volunteers added [[power outage]] information on 152 utilities, and mapped US parks.&lt;ref name="white house"/&gt;

In February 2016 in a hotel in central [[Paris]], [[France]], about 60 volunteers helped the [[Missing Maps]] humanitarian project to preemptively map vulnerable parts of the world on OpenStreetMap. They used satellite imagery and field data to add 4,000 buildings and nearly 170 kilometers (105 miles) of road in [[Uganda]]. Another twelve mapathons were scheduled to take place in US and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.vice.com/article/volunteers-map-the-planets-remote-areas-for-aid-workers|title=Volunteers Map Some of the Earth’s Most Remote Areas to Help Aid Workers|date=February 16, 2016|accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same month, February 2016, Missing Maps also organized a mapathon in [[Grenoble]] to map Tsangano district, [[Tete, Mozambique|Tete]], [[Mozambique]] to help a local conflict between the country main party and the opposition. The Grenoble Missing Maps mapathon photos are included below.

'''Matthew Fontaine Maury''' (January 14, 1806{{spaced ndash}}February 1, 1873) was an American astronomer, [[United States Navy]] officer, historian, [[oceanographer]], [[meteorologist]], [[cartographer]], author, geologist, and educator.

He was nicknamed "Pathfinder of the Seas" and "Father of Modern Oceanography and Naval Meteorology" and later, "Scientist of the Seas" for his extensive works in his books, especially ''The Physical Geography of the Sea'' (1855), the first such extensive and comprehensive book on oceanography to be published. Maury made many important new contributions to charting winds and ocean currents, including [[ocean lanes]] for passing ships at sea.

In 1825, at 19, Maury obtained, through US Representative [[Sam Houston]], a [[Midshipman#United States Navy .281794.E2.80.931845.29|midshipman's warrant]] in the United States Navy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Popular Science Monthly/Volume 37/July 1890/Sketch of Matthew Fontaine Maury]]&lt;/ref&gt; As a midshipman on board the frigate {{USS|Brandywine|1825|6}}, he almost immediately began to study the seas and record methods of navigation. When a leg injury left him unfit for sea duty, Maury devoted his time to the study of navigation, meteorology, winds, and currents. He became Superintendent of the [[United States Naval Observatory]] and head of the Depot of Charts and Instruments. There, Maury studied thousands of ships' logs and charts. He published the Wind and Current Chart of the North Atlantic Ocean, which showed sailors how to use the ocean's currents and winds to their advantage, drastically reducing the length of ocean voyages. Maury's uniform system of recording oceanographic data was adopted by navies and merchant marines around the world and was used to develop charts for all the major trade routes.

With the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], Maury, a [[Virginia]]n, resigned his commission as a US Navy commander and joined the Confederacy. He spent the war in the [[Southern United States|South]] as well as abroad, in Great Britain, Ireland, and France. He helped acquire a ship, {{ship|CSS|Georgia|cruiser|6}}, for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] while he also advocated stopping the war in America among several European nations. Following the war, Maury accepted a teaching position at the [[Virginia Military Institute]] in [[Lexington, Virginia]]. He died at the institute in 1873, after he had completed an exhausting state-to-state lecture tour on national and international weather forecasting on land. He had also completed his book, ''Geological Survey of Virginia'', and a new series of geography for young people.

==Early life and career==
Maury was a descendant of the Maury family, a prominent Virginia family of [[Huguenot]] ancestry that can be traced back to 15th-century [[France]]. His grandfather ([[James Maury|the Reverend James Maury]]) was an inspiring teacher to a future US president, [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Maury also had [[Dutch American|Dutch-American]] ancestry from the "Minor" family of early Virginia.

He was born in 1806 in [[Spotsylvania County, Virginia]], near [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]]; his parents were Richard Maury and Diane Minor Maury. The family moved to [[Franklin, Tennessee]], when he was five. He wanted to emulate the naval career of his older brother, Flag Lieutenant [[John Minor Maury]], who, however, caught [[yellow fever]] after fighting [[pirate]]s as an officer in the US Navy. As a result of John's painful death, Matthew's father, Richard, forbade him from joining the Navy. Maury strongly considered attending [[West Point]] to get a better education than the Navy could offer at that time, but instead, he obtained a naval appointment through the influence of Tennessee Representative [[Sam Houston]], a family friend, in 1825, at the age of 19.

Maury joined the Navy as a [[midshipman]] on board the [[frigate]] {{USS|Brandywine|1825|2}} which was carrying [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette|the Marquis de La Fayette]] home to France, following La Fayette's famous [[Visit of the Marquis de Lafayette to the United States|visit to the United States]]. Almost immediately, Maury began to study the seas and to record methods of [[navigation]]. One of the experiences that piqued this interest was a circumnavigation of the globe on the {{USS|Vincennes|1826|6}}, his assigned ship and the first US warship to travel around the world.

==Scientific career==
His seagoing days came to an abrupt end at the age of 33, after a stagecoach accident broke his right leg. Thereafter, he devoted his time to the study of naval meteorology, [[navigation]], charting the winds and currents, seeking the "Paths of the Seas" mentioned in Psalms 8:8 as: "The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas." Maury had known of the [[Psalms of David]] since childhood. In ''A Life of Matthew Fontaine Maury'' (compiled by his daughter, Diana Fontaine Maury Corbin, 1888), she states on pages 7–8:
: "Matthew's father was very exact in the religious training of his family, now numbering five sons and four daughters, viz., John Minor, Mary, Walker, Matilda, Betsy, Richard Launcelot, Matthew Fontaine, Catherine, and Charles. He would assemble them night and morning to read the Psalter for the day, verse and verse about; and in this way, so familiar did this barefooted boy [M. F. Maury] become with the Psalms of David, that in after life he could cite a quotation, and give chapter and verse, as if he had the Bible open before him. His Bible is depicted on his monument beside his left leg. (See enlarged image on this page)&lt;ref name=diana&gt;Diana Fontaine Maury-Corbin [[s:Matthew Fontaine Maury|"Life of Matthew Fontaine Maury USN &amp; CSN"]] ''Life of Matthew Fontaine Maury, U.S.N. and C.S.N.''&lt;/ref&gt;

As officer-in-charge of the United States Navy office in [[Washington, DC]], called the "Depot of Charts and Instruments" the young lieutenant became a librarian of the many unorganized log books and records in 1842. From his initiative, he sought to improve seamanship through organizing the information in his office and instituting a reporting system among the nation's shipmasters to gather further information on sea conditions and observations. The product of his work was international recognition and the publication in 1847 of "Wind and Current Chart of the North Atlantic."&lt;ref name=Bowditch&gt;Bowditch, Nathaniel. (1966). "U.S. Hydrographic Office". American Practical Navigator: an Epitome of Navigation. Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office. p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; His international recognition assisted in the change of purpose and name of the depot to the [[United States Naval Observatory]] and Hydrographical Office in 1854.&lt;ref name=Bowditch/&gt; He continued holding that position until his resignation, in April 1861. Maury was one of the principal advocates for the founding of a national observatory, and he appealed to science enthusiast and former US President, Representative [[John Quincy Adams]] for the creation of what would eventually become the Naval Observatory. Maury occasionally hosted Adams, who enjoyed astronomy as an avocation, at the Naval Observatory. Concerned that Maury always had a long trek to and from his home on upper Pennsylvania Avenue, Adams introduced an appropriations bill that funded a Superintendent's House on the Observatory grounds. Adams now thus felt no constraints in regularly stopping by for a look through the facility's telescope.

As a sailor, Maury noted that there were numerous lessons that had been learned by ship-masters about the effects of adverse winds and drift currents on the path of a ship. The captains recorded the lessons faithfully in their logbooks, but they were then forgotten. At the Observatory, Maury uncovered an enormous collection of thousands of old ships' logs and charts in storage in trunks dating back to the start of the US Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Every Ship a Floating Laboratory: Matthew Fontaine Maury and the Acquisition of Knowledge at Sea" in Soundings and Crossings: Doing Science at Sea 1800 - 1970|last=Penelope|first=Hardy|publisher=Science History Publications|year=2016|isbn=9780881351446|location=|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maury pored over the documents to collect information on winds, calms, and currents for all seas in all seasons. His dream was to put that information in the hands of all captains.&lt;ref name=gaz&gt;David L. Cohn ''Pathfinder of the Seas''. The Nautical Gazette, May '40&lt;/ref&gt;

Maury also used the old ships' logs to chart the [[animal migration|migration]] of whales. Whalers at the time went to sea, sometimes for years, without knowing that whales migrate and that their paths could be charted.

Maury's work on [[ocean currents]] led him to advocate his theory of the [[Northwest Passage]] as well as the hypothesis that an area in the ocean near the [[North Pole]] is occasionally free of ice. The reasoning behind that was sound. Logs of old whaler ships indicated the designs and the markings of harpoons. Harpoons found in captured whales in the Atlantic had been shot by ships in the Pacific and vice versa at a frequency that would have been impossible if the whales had traveled around [[Cape Horn]].

Maury, knowing a whale to be a mammal, theorized that a northern passage between the oceans that was free of ice must exist to enable the whales to surface and breathe. That became a popular idea that inspired many explorers to seek a reliably-navigable sea route. Many of the explorers died in their search.

Lieutenant Maury published his ''Wind and Current Chart of the North Atlantic'', which showed sailors how to use the ocean's currents and winds to their advantage and to drastically reduce the length of ocean voyages. His ''Sailing Directions'' and ''Physical Geography of the Seas and Its Meteorology'' remain standard. Maury's uniform system of recording [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center|synoptic oceanographic data]] was adopted by navies and [[merchant marine]]s around the world and was used to develop charts for all the major trade routes.

[[File:Matthew Fontaine Maury-wmm6.jpg|thumb|USN Matthew Fontaine Maury 1855]]

Maury's Naval Observatory team included midshipmen assigned to him: [[James Melville Gilliss]], Lieutenants [[John Mercer Brooke]], [[William Lewis Herndon]], [[Lardner Gibbon]], Lieutenants [[Isaac Strain]], John "Jack" Minor Maury II of the USN [[s:Darien Exploring Expedition (1854)|1854 Darien Exploration Expedition]], and others. Their duty was always temporary at the Observatory, and new men had to be trained over and over again. Thus Lt. Maury was working with astronomical work and nautical work at the same time and constantly training new temporary men to assist in those works. As Maury's reputation grew, the competition among young midshipmen to be assigned to work with him intensified. He always had able assistants even though they constantly changed, as they were reassigned as part of their duties.

Maury advocated much in the way of naval reform, including a school for the Navy that would rival the army's West Point. That reform was heavily pushed by Maury's many "Scraps from the Lucky Bag" and other articles printed in the newspapers and many changes came about in the navy, including his finally-fulfilled dream of the creation of the [[United States Naval Academy]].

During its first 1848 meeting, Maury helped launch the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS).

In 1849, Maury spoke out on the need for a transcontinental railroad to join the [[Eastern United States]] to [[California]]. He recommended a southerly route with [[Memphis, Tennessee]] as the eastern terminus, as it is equidistant from [[Lake Michigan]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. He argued that a southerly route running through [[Texas]] would avoid winter snows and could open up commerce with the northern states of [[Mexico]]. Maury also advocated construction of a railroad across the [[Isthmus of Panama]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigafoos, R.A. ''Cotton Row to Beale Street: A business history of Memphis.'' Memphis State University Press, 1979. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International meteorological conference==
Maury also called for an international sea and land weather service. Having charted the seas and currents, he worked on charting land weather forecasting. Congress refused to appropriate funds for a land system of weather observations.

Maury early became convinced that adequate scientific knowledge of the sea could be obtained only by international co-operation. He proposed for the United States to invite the maritime nations of the world to a conference to establish a "universal system" of meteorology, and he was the leading spirit of [[International Meteorological Organization|a pioneer scientific conference]] when it met in [[Brussels]] in 1853. Within a few years, nations owning three fourths of the shipping of the world were sending their oceanographic observations to Maury at the Naval Observatory, where the information was evaluated and the results given worldwide distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Frances L. Williams ''Matthew Fontaine Maury, Scientist of the Sea'' (1969) {{ISBN|0-8135-0433-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As its representative at the conference, the US sent Maury. As a result of the Brussels Conference, a large number of nations, including many traditional enemies, agreed to co-operate in the sharing of land and sea weather data using uniform standards.&lt;ref name=gaz/&gt; It was soon after the Brussels conference that Prussia, Spain, Sardinia, the Free City of Hamburg, the Republic of Bremen, Chile, Austria, and Brazil, and others agreed to joined the enterprise.

The Pope established honorary flags of distinction for the ships of the Papal States, which could be awarded only to the vessels that filled out and sent to Maury in Washington, DC, the Maury abstract logs.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Lee Lewis, associate professor of the [[United States Naval Academy]], [https://archive.org/details/matthewfontainem00lewi ''Matthew Fontaine Maury: The Pathfinder of the Seas''] (1927) Annapolis. {{ISBN|0-405-13045-7}} Reprinted (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attempted liquidation of United States slaves abroad==
In 1851, Maury sent his cousin, Lieutenant [[William Lewis Herndon]], and another former coworker at the United States Naval Observatory, Lieutenant [[Lardner Gibbon]], to explore the [[exploration of the Valley of the Amazon|valley of the Amazon]], while gathering as much information as possible for both trade and slavery in the area. Maury thought the Amazon might serve as a "safety valve" by allowing Southern slaveowners to resettle or sell their slaves there. (Maury's plan was basically following the idea of northern slavetraders and slaveholders who had sold their slaves to the Southern states.) The expedition aimed to map the area for the day when slave owners would go "with their goods and chattels to settle and to trade goods from South American countries along the river highways of the Amazon valley."&lt;ref name="CharlesMann"&gt;{{citation |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IqaMEWNvsJQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= 1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created |pages= 260–261 |author= [[Charles C. Mann]] |publisher= Random House Digital |date=2011 |isbn= 978-0-307-59672-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil's slavery was extinguished after a slow process that began with the end of the international traffic in slaves in 1850 but did not end with complete abolition of slavery until 1888. Maury knew, when he wrote in the news journals of the day, that Brazil was bringing in new slaves from Africa. He proposed that moving the slaves in the United States to Brazil would reduce or eliminate slavery in time in as many areas of the United States as possible. He also hoped to stop the bringing of new slaves to Brazil, which only increased slavery by the capture and enslavement of more Africans. "Imagine," Maury wrote to his cousin, "waking up some day and finding our country free of slavery!"&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Matthew Fontaine Maury/9|Letter]] to his cousin, dated National Observatory, December 24, 1851.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=diana/&gt;

Maury started a campaign to force the Brazilian government to open up navigation in the Amazon River and to oblige it to receive the American colonizers and trade. However, Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]]'s government firmly rejected the proposals. It was mindful of the background of previous US territorial annexations of parts of Mexico: immigration, provocation, conflict and annexation. Brazil thus acted diplomatically and through the press to avoid, by all means, the colonization proposed by Maury. By 1855, the project had certainly failed. Brazil authorized free navigation to all nations in the Amazon in 1866 but only when it was at war against Paraguay and free navigation in the area had become necessary.&lt;ref&gt;CERVO, A. L.; BUENO, C. History of Brazilian Foreign Politics. 4th edition. Brasilia: UnB, 2011, pp. 111 – 116&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Civil War==
[[File:Matthew Fontaine Maury wmm2.jpg |thumb|right|Commander Matthew Fontaine Maury]]

With the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], Maury, a native of Virginia, ended the career that he dearly loved by handing in his commission as a US Navy commander to serve Virginia, which had joined the Confederacy, as Chief of Sea Coast, River and Harbor Defenses. Because he was an international figure, he was ordered to go abroad for many reasons, including disseminating propaganda for the Confederacy, pursuing peace, and purchasing ships. He went to England, Ireland, and France, acquiring ships and supplies for the Confederacy. By speeches and newspaper publications, Maury tried desperately to get other nations to stop the American Civil War, carrying pleas for peace in one hand and a sword in the other, both to deal with whatever the outcome.

Maury was elected by the [[Confederate Congress]] a commissioner of Weights and Measures in association with a mathematics professor, Francis H. Smith, of the University of Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;Tyler, Lyon Gardner, "Encyclopedia of Virginia Biography", Lewis Hist. Publ. Co., 1915, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

Maury also perfected an "electric torpedo" ([[naval mine]]), which raised havoc with northern shipping. Maury had experience with the transatlantic cable and electricity flowing through wires underwater when working with [[Cyrus West Field]] and [[Samuel Finley Breese Morse]]. The torpedoes, similar to present-day contact mines, were said by the Secretary of the Navy in 1865 "to have cost the Union more vessels than all other causes combined."&lt;ref name=gaz/&gt;

==Later life==
The war brought ruin to many in Fredericksburg, where Maury's immediate family lived. Thus, returning there was not immediately considered. After the war, after serving [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian]] in Mexico as "Imperial Commissioner of Immigration" and building Carlotta and [[New Virginia Colony]] for displaced Confederates and immigrants from other lands, Maury accepted a teaching position at the [[Virginia Military Institute]], holding the chair of physics.

Maury advocated the creation of an agricultural college to complement the institute. That led to the establishment of the [[Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College]] (Virginia Tech) in [[Blacksburg, Virginia]], in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maury declined the offer to become its first president partly because of his age. He had previously been suggested as president of the [[College of William &amp; Mary]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]], in 1848 by [[Benjamin Blake Minor]] in his publication the ''[[Southern Literary Messenger]]''. Maury considered becoming president of [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] in Annapolis Maryland, the [[University of Alabama]], and the [[University of Tennessee]].&lt;ref name="Lewis1980"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Lee Lewis|title=Matthew Fontaine Maury|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xveu35zy7AkC|accessdate=September 14, 2011|date=June 1980|publisher=Ayer Publishing|isbn=978-0-405-13045-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that he preferred being close to [[General Robert E. Lee]] in Lexington from statements that Maury made in letters. Maury served as a pall bearer for Lee.&lt;ref&gt;[[Southern Historical Society]]'s Papers&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time at Virginia Military Institute, Maury wrote a book, entitled ''The [[Physical Geography]] of Virginia''. He had once been a gold mining superintendent outside Fredericksburg and had studied geology intensely during that time and so was well equipped to write such a book. During the Civil War, more battles took place in Virginia than in any other state (Tennessee was second), and Maury's aim was to assist wartorn Virginia in discovering and extracting minerals, improving farming and whatever else could assist it to rebuild after such a massive destruction.

Maury later gave talks in Europe about co-operation on a weather bureau for land, just as he had charted the winds and predicted storms at sea many years before. He gave the speeches until his last days, when he collapsed giving a speech. He went home after he recovered and told Ann Hull Herndon-Maury, his wife, "I have come home to die."

==Death and burial==
He died at home in Lexington at 12:40&amp;nbsp;pm, on Saturday, February 1, 1873. He was exhausted from traveling throughout the nation while he was giving speeches promoting land meteorology. He was attended by his eldest son, Major Richard Launcelot Maury and son-in-law, Major Spottswood Wellford Corbin. Maury asked his daughters and wife to leave the room. His last words were "all's well," a nautical expression telling of calm conditions at sea.&lt;ref name=diana/&gt;

His body was placed on display in the Virginia Military Institute library. Maury was initially buried in the Gilham family vault in Lexington's cemetery, across from [[Stonewall Jackson]], until, after some delay into the next year, his remains were taken through [[Goshen Pass]] to [[Richmond, Virginia]]. He was reburied between Presidents [[James Monroe]] and [[John Tyler]] in [[Hollywood Cemetery (Richmond, Virginia)|Hollywood Cemetery]] in Richmond, Virginia.

==Legacy==

[[File:Mfmauryhofjeh.JPG|thumb|right|Bust of Maury in the [[Hall of Fame for Great Americans]], New York City]]

After decades of national and international hard work averaging 14 hours per day, Maury received fame and honors, including being knighted by several nations and given medals with precious gems as well as a collection of all medals struck by [[Pope Pius IX]] during his pontificate, a book dedication and more from Father [[Angelo Secchi]], who was a student of Maury from 1848 to 1849 in the [[United States Naval Observatory]]. The two remained lifelong friends. Other religious friends of Maury included [[James Hervey Otey]], his former teacher who, before 1857, worked with Bishop [[Leonidas Polk]] on the construction of the [[University of the South]] in Tennessee. While visiting there, Maury was convinced by his old teacher to give the "cornerstone speech."

As a US Navy officer, he was required to decline awards from foreign nations. Some were offered to Maury's wife, Ann Hull Herndon-Maury, who accepted them for her husband. Some have been placed at Virginia Military Institute, others were lent to the [[Smithsonian]], and yet others remain in the family. He became a [[commodore (rank)|commodore]] (often a [[title of courtesy]]) in the Virginia Provisional Navy and a commander in the Confederacy.

A monument to Maury, by sculptor [[Frederick William Sievers]], was unveiled in Richmond on November 11, 1929. Maury Hall, the home of the Naval Science Department at the [[University of Virginia]] and headquarters of the University's Navy [[ROTC]] [[battalion]], was named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virginia.edu/webmap/popPages/55-MauryHall.html|title=U.Va.

Another Maury Hall, named after him, houses the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department and the Systems Engineering Department at the [[United States Naval Academy]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]].

Ships have been named in his honor, including three US Navy ships named {{USS|Maury}}. A fourth US Navy ship named in his honor was the USS ''Commodore Maury'' (SP-656), patrol vessel and minesweeper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/sh-usn/usnsh-c/sp656.htm|title=USN Ships – USS Commodore Maury (SP-656), 1917–1918|publisher=|accessdate=September 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of World War I. A World War II [[Liberty Ship]] was also named in his honor. Additionally, Tidewater Community College, based in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], owns the R/V Matthew F. Maury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcc.edu/academics/divisions/ms/geoscience/projects/maury.htm Research Vessel Matthew F.

In March 2013, in Maury's honor, the US Navy launched the USNS Maury in Mississippi. The ''Maury'' is designed to be an oceanographic survey ship for the Navy.

[[Lake Maury]], in [[Newport News, Virginia]], is named after Maury. The lake is located on the [[Mariners' Museum]] property and is encircled by a walking trail. The [[Maury River]], entirely in [[Rockbridge County, Virginia]], near Virginia Military Institute (where Maury taught), also honors the scientist, as does [[Maury (crater)|Maury crater]], on the Moon.

A high school in Norfolk, Virginia, is named after him: [[Matthew Fontaine Maury High School]].

The clipper ship, Flying Cloud, was captained by [[Josiah Perkins Creesy]] and navigated by his wife, [[Eleanor Creesy]], who was the first person to navigate around Cape Horn by using the new route laid down by then-Lieutenant Matthew Fontaine Maury, of the National Observatory, at Washington. She used Maury's ''Sailing Directions'' and ''Winds and Currents''. She gained and held the 89-day speed record of that route for decades.

The '''Mount of Olives''' or '''Mount Olivet''' ({{lang-he-n|הַר הַזֵּיתִים}}, ''Har ha-Zeitim''; {{lang-ar|جبل الزيتون, الطور}}, ''Jabal al-Zaytun'', ''Al-Tur'') is a mountain ridge east of and adjacent to [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Jerusalem's Old City]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite book|title=This is Jerusalem|author= Har-El, Menashe |publisher= Canaan Publishing House|location= Jerusalem|date= 1977|page= 117}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is named for the [[olive|olive groves]] that once covered its slopes.  The southern part of the Mount was the [[Silwan necropolis]], attributed to the ancient [[Kingdom of Judah|Judean kingdom]].&lt;ref name=Ussishkin70 /&gt; The mount has been used as a [[Mount of Olives Jewish Cemetery|Jewish cemetery]] for over 3,000 years and holds approximately 150,000 graves, making it central in the  tradition of [[Jewish cemetery|Jewish cemeteries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3981588,00.html|title= International committee vows to restore Mount of Olives|website= Ynet News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several key events in the life of [[Jesus]], as related in the [[Gospels]], took place on the Mount of Olives, and in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] it is described as the place from which Jesus ascended to heaven. Because of its association with both Jesus and [[Virgin Mary|Mary]], the mount has been a site of [[Christianity|Christian]] worship since ancient times and is today a major site of pilgrimage for [[Catholic Church|Catholics]], [[Orthodox Christianity|the Eastern Orthodox]], and [[Protestantism|Protestants]].

Much of the top of the hill is occupied by [[At-Tur (Mount of Olives)|At-Tur]], a former village and now a neighbourhood of [[East Jerusalem]] with a majority-Muslim population.

==Geography and geology==
The Mount of Olives is one of three peaks of a mountain [[ridge]] which runs for {{convert|3.5|km|1|abbr=off}} just east of the Old City across the [[Kidron Valley]], in this area called the [[Valley of Josaphat]]. The peak to its north is [[Mount Scopus]], at {{convert|826|m|0|abbr=off}}, while the peak to its south is the Mount of Corruption, at {{convert|747|m|0|abbr=on}}. The highest point on the Mount of Olives is At-Tur, at {{convert|818|m|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mount Seir, Sinai and Western Palestine|first=Edward|last=Hull|page=152|publisher=Richad Bently and Son, London|year=1885}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ridge acts as a [[Drainage divide|watershed]], and its eastern side is the beginning of the [[Judean Desert]].

The ridge is formed of oceanic [[sedimentary rock]] from the [[Late Cretaceous]] and contains a soft [[chalk]] and a hard [[flint]]. While the chalk is easily [[quarry|quarried]], it is not a suitable strength for construction and features many [[Rock-cut tombs in ancient Israel|man-made burial caves]]

==History==

[[File:Egyptian camel transport3.jpg|thumb|Egyptian camel transport passing over "Olivet", 1918]]

From [[Biblical times]] until the present, [[Jews]] have been buried on the Mount of Olives. The [[Silwan necropolis|necropolis on the southern ridge]], the location of the modern village of [[Silwan]], was the burial place of Jerusalem's most important citizens in the [[First Temple Period|period of the Biblical kings]].&lt;ref name=Ussishkin70&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Necropolis from the Time of the Kingdom of Judah at Silwan, Jerusalem|author= Ussishkin, David |work=The Biblical Archaeologist|volume= 33|number= 2 |date=May 1970|pages= 33–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The religious ceremony marking the [[Rosh Chodesh|start of a new month]] was held on the Mount of Olives in the days of the [[Second Temple]].&lt;ref name="Har-el 1977 120–123"&gt;{{cite book |last=Har-el |first=Menashe |title=This is Jerusalem |publisher=Canaan |location=Jerusalem |year=1977 |pages=120–23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman army|Roman soldiers]] from the [[Legio X Fretensis|10th Legion]] camped on the mount during the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Siege of Jerusalem]] in the year 70 AD. After the destruction of the [[Second Temple]], Jews celebrated the festival of [[Sukkot]] on the Mount of Olives. They made pilgrimages to the Mount of Olives because it was 80 meters higher than the [[Temple Mount]] and offered a panoramic view of the Temple site. It became a traditional place for lamenting the Temple's destruction, especially on [[Tisha B'Av]].&lt;ref name="Har-el 1977 120–123"/&gt; In 1481, an Italian Jewish pilgrim, Rabbi Meshullam da Volterra, wrote: "And all the community of Jews, every year, goes up to [[Mount Zion]] on the day of Tisha B'Av to fast and mourn, and from there they move down along Yoshafat Valley and up to Mount of Olives. From there they see the whole Temple (the Temple Mount) and there they weep and lament the destruction of this House."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nom de Deu|first=J.|authorlink=|title=Relatos de Viajes y Epistolas de Peregrinos Jud.os a Jerusalén|publisher=|location=Madrid|year=1987|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1850s, the villagers of [[Silwan]] were paid £100 annually by the Jews in an effort to prevent the desecration of graves on the mount.&lt;ref name="Har-El2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Menashe Har-El|title=Golden Jerusalem|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Z2cFY9iGqgC&amp;pg=PA244|date=April 2004|publisher=Gefen Publishing House Ltd|isbn=978-965-229-254-4|page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prime Minister of Israel]] [[Menachem Begin]] asked to be buried on the Mount of Olives near the grave of [[Irgun|Etzel]] member [[Meir Feinstein]], rather than [[Mount Herzl]] national cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasen/pages/ShArtStEngPE.jhtml?itemNo=846330&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=14&amp;title='The%20good%20jailer%20'&amp;dyn_server=172.20.5.5 |title=The good jailer |last=Sheleg |first=Yair |date=2007-07-04 |accessdate=2010-07-16 |publisher=[[Haaretz]] }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status since 1948===
The [[1949 Armistice Agreements|armistice agreement]] signed by Israel and Jordan following the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] called for the establishment of a Special Committee to negotiate developments including "free access to the holy sites and cultural institutions and use of the cemetery on the Mount of Olives". However, during the 19 years the [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank]] lasted, the committee was not formed. Non-Israeli Christian pilgrims were allowed to visit the mount, but Jews of all countries and most non-Jewish Israeli citizens were barred from entering Jordan and therefore were unable to travel to the area.&lt;ref&gt;To Rule Jerusalem By Roger Friedland, Richard Hecht, 2000, p. 39, "Tourists entering East Jerusalem had to present baptismal certificates or other proof they were not Jewish."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A Idinopulos, Jerusalem, 1994, p. 300, "So severe were the Jordanian restrictions against Jews gaining access to the old city that visitors wishing to cross over from west Jerusalem...had to produce a baptismal certificate."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, Karen, Jerusalem: One City, Three Faiths, 1997, "Only clergy, diplomats, UN personnel, and a few privileged tourists were permitted to go from one side to the other. The Jordanians required most tourists to produce baptismal certificates—to prove they were not Jewish ... ."&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1949, and throughout the Jordanian rule of the site, some Arab residents uprooted tombstones and plowed the land in the cemeteries, and an estimated 38,000 tombstones were damaged in total. During this period, four roads were paved through the cemeteries, in the process destroying graves including those of famous persons. Jordan's [[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein]] permitted the construction of the [[Seven Arches Hotel|Intercontinental Hotel]] at the summit of the Mount of Olives together with a road that cut through the cemetery which destroyed hundreds of Jewish graves, some from the [[First Temple Period]]. Graves were also demolished for [[parking lot]]s and a [[filling station]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/10/world/middleeast/10jerusalem.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=2&amp;em | work=The New York Times | title=Parks Fortify Israel's Claim to Jerusalem | first1=Ethan | last1=Bronner | first2=Isabel | last2=Kershner | date=2009-05-10 | accessdate=2010-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Nadav Shragai]], [http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DBID=1&amp;LNGID=1&amp;TMID=111&amp;FID=443&amp;PID=0&amp;IID=3052 The Mount of Olives under Jordanian Rule], [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs|JCPA]] 2009 and references&lt;/ref&gt; and were used in [[latrine]]s at a [[Jordanian Army]] barracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alon|first=Amos|authorlink=Amos Elon|title=Jerusalem: Battlegrounds of Memory|publisher=Kodansha Int'l|location=New York|year=1995|page=75|isbn=1-56836-099-1|quote=After 1967, it was discovered that tombstones had been removed from the ancient cemetery to pave the latrines of a nearby Jordanian army barrack.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Meron Benvenisti|title=City of Stone: The Hidden History of Jerusalem|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Q8Ete9w6woC&amp;pg=PA228|year=1996|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-91868-9|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Har-El, Menashe.

Following the 1967 [[Six-Day War]] and the Israeli occupation of East Jerusalem, its government began restoration work and re-opened the cemetery for burials. Israel's 1980 [[Jerusalem Law|unilateral annexation]] of East Jerusalem was condemned as a violation of international law and ruled null and void by the UN Security Council in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 478|UNSC Resolution 478]].

==Recent events==
{{As of|2010}}, the [[Mount of Olives Jewish Cemetery|Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives]] has been targeted regularly by Arab vandals. Mourners have been assaulted. Notable graves that have been defaced by vandals include those of the [[Gerrer Rebbe]] and [[Menachem Begin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=163398 Mount of Olives security beefed up to stop vandalism], Jerusalem Post 17-12-2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Editorials/Article.aspx?id=175637 Has Israel abandoned the Mount of Olives?], Jerusalem Post 15-05-2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3888827,00.html Vandalism returns to Mount of Olives cemetery], Ynet News 12-05-2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shameful&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Editorials/Article.aspx?id=194272 Shameful dereliction at the Mt. of Olives Cemetery], Jerusalem Post 06-11-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 November 2010, an international watch-committee was set up by [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora Jews]] with the aim of reversing the desecration of the Jewish cemetery. According to one of the founders, the initiative was triggered by witnessing tombstones that were wrecked with "the kind of maliciousness that defies the imagination."&lt;ref name=shameful/&gt;

==Religious significance==

===Old Testament references===
The Mount of Olives is first mentioned in connection with [[David]]'s flight from [[Absalom]]
([[Books of Samuel|II Samuel]] 15:30): "And David went up by the ascent of the Mount of Olives, and wept as he went up." The ascent was probably east of the [[City of David]], near the village of [[Silwan]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The sacred character of the mount is alluded to in the [[Book of Ezekiel]] (11:23): "And the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The biblical designation Mount of Corruption, or in Hebrew ''Har HaMashchit'' ([[Books of Kings|I Kings]] 11:7–8), derives from the [[Idolatry in the Bible|idol worship]] there, begun by [[King Solomon]] building altars to the gods of his [[Moab]]ite and [[Ammon]]ite wives on the southern peak, "on the mountain which is before (east of) Jerusalem" (1 Kings 11:7), just outside the limits of the holy city. This site was known for idol worship throughout the [[First Temple]] period, until king of Judah, [[Josiah]], finally destroyed "the high places that were before Jerusalem, to the right of Har HaMashchit..."([[Books of Kings|II Kings]] 23:13)

An apocalyptic prophecy in the [[Book of Zechariah]] states that [[YHWH]] will stand on the Mount of Olives and the mountain will split in two, with one half shifting north and one half shifting south (Zechariah 14:4). According to the [[Masoretic Text]], people will flee through this newly formed valley to a place called [[Azal (Bible)|Azal]] (Zechariah 14:5). The [[Septuagint]] (LXX) has a different reading of Zechariah 14:5 stating that a valley will be blocked up as it was blocked up during the earthquake during King [[Uzziah]]'s reign. Jewish historian [[Flavius Josephus]] mentions in ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' that the valley in the area of the [[King's Garden (Jerusalem)|King's Garden]]s was blocked up by landslide rubble during Uzziah's earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;[[Flavius Josephus]], ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'', book 9, chapter 10, paragraph 4, verse 225, [[William Whiston]]&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli geologists Wachs and Levitte identified the remnant of a large landslide on the Mount of Olives directly adjacent to this area.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Wachs and Dov Levitte, Earthquake Risk and Slope Stability in Jerusalem, Environmental Geology and Water Sciences, Vol. 6, No. 3, pp. 183–86, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Based on geographic and linguistic evidence, [[Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau]], a 19th-century linguist and archeologist in Palestine, theorized that the valley directly adjacent to this landslide is Azal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau|Charles Clermont-Ganneau]], Archaeological Researches in Palestine, Vol. 1. p. 420, 1899; Charles Clermont-Ganneau, [[Palestine Exploration Fund]] Quarterly Statement, April 1874, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; This evidence accords with the LXX reading of Zechariah 14:5 which states that the valley will be blocked up as far as Azal. The valley he identified (which is now known as Wady Yasul in Arabic, and Nahal Etzel in Hebrew) lies ''south'' of both Jerusalem and the Mount of Olives.&lt;!-- removed original research - repost with attribution only. "If Clermont-Ganneau is correct, the notion of people fleeing ''east'' through the split Mount of Olives to Azal is impossible because"--&gt;

===Burial and resurrection===
{{main|Mount of Olives Jewish Cemetery}}
Many Jews have wanted to be buried on the Mount of Olives since antiquity, based on the Jewish tradition (from the Biblical verse Zechariah 14:4) that when the Messiah comes, the resurrection of the dead will begin there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goisrael.com/Tourism_Eng/Tourist%20Information/Jewish%20Themes/Jewish_Sites/Pages/Mount%20of%20Olives%20Jewish%20Cemetery%20jew.aspx Mount of Olives description, from www.goisrael.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320181105/http://www.goisrael.com/Tourism_Eng/Tourist%20Information/Jewish%20Themes/Jewish_Sites/Pages/Mount%20of%20Olives%20Jewish%20Cemetery%20jew.aspx |date=2012-03-20 }}, retrieved January 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=May 2015}} There are an estimated 150,000 graves on the Mount, including tombs traditionally associated with [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]] and [[Absalom]]. On the upper slope, the traditional [[Tomb of the Prophets Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi]] is situated. Notable [[rabbi]]s buried on the mount include [[Chaim ibn Attar]] and others from the 15th-century to present.

===New Testament references===
[[File:Enrique Simonet - Flevit super illam 1892.jpg|{{largethumb}}|left|''[[Flevit super illam]]'' (He wept over it); by [[Enrique Simonet]], 1892.]]

The Mount of Olives is frequently mentioned in the [[New Testament]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Matthew|21:1}}; 26:30, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the route from Jerusalem to [[Bethany (Israel)|Bethany]] and the place where [[Jesus]] stood when he wept over Jerusalem (an event known as ''[[Flevit super illam]]'' in [[Latin]]).

Jesus is said to have spent time on the mount, teaching and prophesying to his disciples (Matthew 24–25), including the [[Olivet discourse]], returning after each day to rest ([[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 21:37, and John 8:1 in the additional section of John's Gospel known as the ''[[John 8#Pericope adulterae|Pericope Adulterae]]''), and also coming there on the night of his betrayal.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Matthew|26:39}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the foot of the Mount of Olives lies the [[Gethsemane|Garden of Gethsemane]]. The New Testament tells how Jesus and his disciples sang together – "When they had sung the hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives" [[Gospel of Matthew]] 26:30. Jesus [[Ascension of Jesus|ascended to heaven]] from the Mount of Olives according to Acts 1:9–12.

==Landmarks==
{{Jerusalem large}}
Landmarks on the top of the Mount of Olives include the [[Augusta Victoria Hospital]] with the Lutheran Church of the Ascension and its highly visible 50-metre [[bell tower]], the Mosque or [[Chapel of the Ascension (Jerusalem)|Chapel of the Ascension]], the Russian Orthodox Church of the Ascension with its tall white bell tower, the [[Church of the Pater Noster]], and the [[Seven Arches Hotel]]. On the western slope there are the historic [[Mount of Olives Jewish Cemetery|Jewish cemetery]], the so-called [[Tomb of the Prophets Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi|Tomb of the Prophets]], the Catholic [[Dominus Flevit Church|Church of Dominus Flevit]], and the Russian Orthodox [[Church of Mary Magdalene]]. At the foot of the mount, where it meets the [[Kidron Valley]], there is the Garden of [[Gethsemane]] with the [[Church of All Nations (Jerusalem)|Church of all Nations]]. Within the Kidron Valley itself are the [[Mary's Tomb|Tomb of the Virgin Mary]], the Grotto of Gethsemane, and the nearby tomb of the medieval historian [[Mujir al-Din|Mujir ed-Din]], and further south are the tombs of [[Tomb of Absalom|Absalom]] (Hebrew name: Yad Avshalom), the [[Tomb of Benei Hezir|Hezir priestly family]] and of [[Tomb of Zechariah|Zechariah]]. At the northern margin of Mount Olivet stand the [[Brigham Young University Jerusalem Center]] with the [[Orson Hyde Memorial Garden]] and the Jewish settlement of [[Beit Orot]], bordering on the [[Emek Tzurim National Park|Tzurim Valley]] which contains the [[Temple Mount Sifting Project]].&lt;ref name="ATG"&gt;Alternative Tourism Group (ATG)- Study Center.

===Brigham Young University Jerusalem Center===
The construction of the [[Brigham Young University Jerusalem Center]] for Near Eastern Studies, better known locally as the Mormon University, owned and operated by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS) near the valley separating the Mount of Olives from Mount Scopus, initially sparked controversy because of concerns that the [[Mormons]] would engage in missionary activities. After the Mormons pledged not to proselytize in Israel, work on the building was allowed to proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vie/Jerusalem3.html#Scopus |title= Jerusalem - Beyond the Old City Walls |publisher= Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= July 22, 1946 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oceanography''' (compound of the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ὠκεανός meaning "[[ocean]]" and γράφω meaning "write"), also known as '''oceanology''', is the study of the physical and biological aspects of the ocean. It is an [[Earth science]], which covers a wide range of topics, including [[ecosystem]] dynamics; [[ocean current]]s, [[Wind wave|waves]], and [[geophysical fluid dynamics]]; [[plate tectonics]] and the geology of the sea floor; and [[flux]]es of various chemical substances and physical properties within the ocean and across its boundaries. These diverse topics reflect multiple disciplines that oceanographers blend to further knowledge of the [[world ocean]] and understanding of processes within: [[astronomy]], [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[climatology]], [[geography]], [[geology]], [[hydrology]], [[meteorology]] and [[physics]]. [[Paleoceanography]] studies the history of the oceans in the geologic past.

===Early history===
Humans first acquired knowledge of the waves and currents of the [[sea]]s and [[ocean]]s in pre-historic times. Observations on [[tide]]s were recorded by [[Aristotle]] and [[Strabo]]. Early exploration of the oceans was primarily for [[cartography]] and mainly limited to its surfaces and of the animals that fishermen brought up in nets, though depth soundings by lead line were taken.

Although [[Juan Ponce de León]] in 1513 first identified the [[Gulf Stream]], and the current was well known to mariners, [[Benjamin Franklin]] made the first scientific study of it and gave it its name. Franklin measured water temperatures during several Atlantic crossings and correctly explained the Gulf Stream's cause. Franklin and Timothy Folger printed the first map of the Gulf Stream in 1769–1770.&lt;ref name="NOAA_Franklin"&gt;[http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/library/readings/gulf/gulf.html 1785: Benjamin Franklin's 'Sundry Maritime Observations'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051218185445/http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/library/readings/gulf/gulf.html |date=2005-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Jerry.

[[File:Rennel map 1799.png|left|thumb|280px|1799 map of the currents in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Indian Ocean]]s, by [[James Rennell]]]]
Information on the currents of the [[Pacific Ocean]] was gathered by explorers of the late 18th century, including [[James Cook]] and [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]]. [[James Rennell]] wrote the first scientific textbooks on oceanography, detailing the current flows of the [[Atlantic ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Indian ocean|Indian]] oceans. During a voyage around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1777, he mapped ''"the [[Agulhas Current|banks and currents at the Lagullas]]"''. He was also the first to understand the nature of the intermittent current near the [[Isles of Scilly]], (now known as [[Rennell's Current]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Rennell, James|volume=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir [[James Clark Ross]] took the first modern sounding in deep sea in 1840, and [[Charles Darwin]] published a paper on [[reef]]s and the formation of [[atoll]]s as a result of the [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|second voyage of HMS ''Beagle'']] in 1831–1836. [[Robert FitzRoy]] published a four-volume report of ''Beagle''{{'}}s three voyages. In 1841–1842 [[Edward Forbes]] undertook dredging in the [[Aegean Sea]] that founded marine ecology.

The first superintendent of the [[United States Naval Observatory]] (1842–1861), [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]] devoted his time to the study of marine meteorology, [[navigation]], and charting prevailing winds and currents. His 1855 textbook ''Physical Geography of the Sea'' was one of the first comprehensive oceanography studies. Many nations sent oceanographic observations to Maury at the Naval Observatory, where he and his colleagues evaluated the information and distributed the results worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Frances L. ''Matthew Fontaine Maury, Scientist of the Sea.'' (1969) {{ISBN|0-8135-0433-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern oceanography ===
Despite all this, human knowledge of the oceans remained confined to the topmost few fathoms of the water and a small amount of the bottom, mainly in shallow areas. Almost nothing was known of the ocean depths. The British [[Royal Navy]]'s efforts to chart all of the world's [[coast]]lines in the mid-19th century reinforced the vague idea that most of the ocean was very deep, although little more was known. As exploration ignited both popular and scientific interest in the polar regions and Africa, so too did the mysteries of the unexplored oceans.

[[File:Challenger.jpg|right|thumb|{{HMS|Challenger|1858|6}} undertook the first global marine research expedition in 1872.]]
The seminal event in the founding of the modern science of oceanography was the 1872–1876 [[Challenger expedition|''Challenger'' expedition]]. As the first true oceanographic cruise, this expedition laid the groundwork for an entire academic and research discipline.&lt;ref name="NOAAA"&gt;[http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/explorations/03mountains/background/challenger/challenger.html Then and Now: The HMS Challenger Expedition and the 'Mountains in the Sea' Expedition], Ocean Explorer website (NOAA), accessed 2 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In response to a recommendation from the [[Royal Society]], the [[British Government]] announced in 1871 an expedition to explore world's oceans and conduct appropriate scientific investigation. [[Charles Wyville Thompson]] and [[John Murray (oceanographer)|Sir John Murray]] launched the ''Challenger'' expedition. {{HMS|Challenger|1858|2}}, leased from the Royal Navy, was modified for scientific work and equipped with separate laboratories for [[natural history]] and [[chemistry]].&lt;ref name="Rice"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rice|first=A.

On her journey circumnavigating the globe,&lt;ref name="Rice"/&gt; 492&amp;nbsp;deep sea soundings, 133&amp;nbsp;bottom dredges, 151&amp;nbsp;open water trawls and 263&amp;nbsp;serial water temperature observations were taken.&lt;ref&gt;''Oceanography: an introduction to the marine environment'' (Peter K. Weyl, 1970), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Around 4,700&amp;nbsp;new species of marine life were discovered. The result was the ''Report Of The Scientific Results of the Exploring Voyage of H.M.S. Challenger during the years 1873–76''. Murray, who supervised the publication, described the report as "the greatest advance in the knowledge of our planet since the celebrated discoveries of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries". He went on to found the academic discipline of oceanography at the [[University of Edinburgh]], which remained the centre for oceanographic research well into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/public/JohnMurray.html|title=Sir John Murray (1841–1914) – Founder Of Modern Oceanography|publisher=Science and Engineering at The University of Edinburgh|accessdate=7 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528123837/http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/public/JohnMurray.html|archivedate=28 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray was the first to study marine trenches and in particular the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]], and map the sedimentary deposits in the oceans. He tried to map out the world's ocean currents based on salinity and temperature observations, and was the first to correctly understand the nature of [[coral reef]] development.

In the late 19th century, other [[Western culture|Western]] nations also sent out scientific expeditions (as did private individuals and institutions). The first purpose built oceanographic ship, ''Albatros'', was built in 1882. In 1893, [[Fridtjof Nansen]] allowed his ship, ''Fram'', to be frozen in the Arctic ice. This enabled him to obtain oceanographic, meteorological and astronomical data at a stationary spot over an extended period.
 
[[File:Ocean currents 1911.jpg|thumb|225px|right|[[Ocean current]]s (1911)]]
In 1881 the geographer [[John Francon Williams]] published a seminal book, ''Geography of the Oceans''.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Francon Williams|Williams, J. Francon]] (1881) [https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=FyMIAQAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22The+Geography+of+the+Oceans%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3ke-d2fXWAhWEn5QKHWMkD0AQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Geography of the Oceans: Physical, Historical, and Descriptive''] George Philip &amp; Son.

Entry (retrieved 15 October) 2017:http://www.worldcat.org/title/geography-of-the-oceans/oclc/561275070&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1907 and 1911 [[Otto Krümmel]] published the ''Handbuch der Ozeanographie'', which became influential in awakening public interest in oceanography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Otto Krümmel|date=1907|title=Handbuch der Ozeanographie|url=https://archive.org/stream/handbuchderozean02bogu#page/n5/mode/2up &lt;!-- Abstract: http://openlibrary.org/books/OL14010853M/Handbuch_der_ozeanographie --&gt;|publisher=J. Engelhorn}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four-month 1910 North Atlantic expedition headed by John Murray and [[Johan Hjort]] was the most ambitious research oceanographic and marine zoological project ever mounted until then, and led to the classic 1912 book ''The Depths of the Ocean''.

The first acoustic measurement of sea depth was made in 1914. Between 1925 and 1927 the "Meteor" expedition gathered 70,000 ocean depth measurements using an echo sounder, surveying the Mid-Atlantic ridge.

Sverdrup, Johnson and Fleming published ''The Oceans'' in 1942,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sverdrup|first1=Harald Ulrik|authorlink1=Harald Sverdrup (oceanographer)|last2=Johnson|first2=Martin Wiggo|authorlink2=Martin W. Johnson|last3=Fleming|first3=Richard H.|title=The Oceans, Their Physics, Chemistry, and General Biology|date=1942|publisher=[[Prentice-Hall]]|location=New York|url=http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt167nb66r/}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was a major landmark. ''The Sea'' (in three volumes, covering physical oceanography, seawater and geology)  edited by M.N. Hill was published in 1962, while [[Rhodes Fairbridge]]'s ''Encyclopedia of Oceanography'' was published in 1966.

The Great Global Rift, running along the Mid Atlantic Ridge, was discovered by [[Maurice Ewing]] and [[Bruce Heezen]] in 1953; in 1954 a mountain range under the Arctic Ocean was found by the Arctic Institute of the USSR. The theory of seafloor spreading was developed in 1960 by [[Harry Hammond Hess]]. The [[Ocean Drilling Program]] started in 1966. Deep sea vents were discovered in 1977 by [[Jack Corliss]] and [[Robert Ballard]] in the submersible {{ship|DSV|Alvin}}.

In the 1950s, [[Auguste Piccard]] invented the [[bathyscaphe]] and used the [[bathyscaphe]] {{ship|Bathyscaphe|Trieste||2}} to investigate the ocean's depths. The United States [[nuclear submarine]] {{USS|Nautilus|SSN-571|2}} made the first journey under the ice to the North Pole in 1958. In 1962 the FLIP (Floating Instrument Platform), a {{convert|355|ft|m|adj=on|0}} spar buoy, was first deployed.

From the 1970s, there has been much emphasis on the application of large scale computers to oceanography to allow numerical predictions of ocean conditions and as a part of overall environmental change prediction. An oceanographic buoy array was established in the Pacific to allow prediction of [[El Niño]] events.

1990 saw the start of the [[World Ocean Circulation Experiment]] (WOCE) which continued until 2002. Geosat seafloor mapping data became available in 1995.

In recent years studies advanced particular knowledge on [[ocean acidification]], [[ocean heat content]], [[ocean currents]], [[El Niño|the El Niño phenomenon]], mapping of [[methane hydrate]] deposits, the [[carbon cycle]], [[coastal erosion]], [[weathering]] and [[climate feedback]]s in regards to [[climate change]] interactions.

Study of the oceans is linked to understanding global climate changes, potential [[global warming]] and related [[Biosphere#Origin and use of the term|biosphere]] concerns. The atmosphere and ocean are linked because of [[evaporation]] and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] as well as [[thermal flux]] (and solar [[insolation]]). [[Wind]] stress is a major driver of [[ocean currents]] while the ocean is a sink for atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]]. All these factors relate to the ocean's [[Biogeochemistry|biogeochemical]] setup.

==Branches==
[[File:Antarctic frontal-system hg.png|thumb|Oceanographic frontal systems on the [[Southern Hemisphere]]]]
The study of oceanography is divided into these four branches:
* Biological oceanography, or [[marine biology]], investigates the ecology of marine organisms in the context of the physical, chemical and geological characteristics of their ocean environment and the biology of individual marine organisms.
* [[Chemical oceanography]] and [[ocean chemistry]], are the study of the [[chemistry]] of the ocean. Whereas chemical oceanography is primarily occupied with the study and understanding of seawater properties and its changes, ocean chemistry focuses primarily on the [[geochemical cycle]]s.
* Geological oceanography, or [[marine geology]], is the study of the [[geology]] of the ocean floor including [[plate tectonics]] and [[paleoceanography]].
* [[Physical oceanography]], or marine physics, studies the ocean's physical attributes including temperature-salinity structure, mixing, [[ocean surface wave|surface waves]], internal waves, surface [[tide]]s, [[internal tides]], and [[ocean current|currents]].

==Ocean acidification==

==Ocean currents==
{{Further|Ocean current}}
Since the early ocean expeditions in oceanography, a major interest was the study of the ocean currents and temperature measurements. The [[tides]], the [[Coriolis effect]], changes in direction and strength of [[wind]], salinity and temperature are the main factors determining ocean currents. The [[thermohaline circulation]] (THC) ''thermo-'' referring to [[temperature]] and ''-haline'' referring to [[salinity|salt content]] connects 4 of 5 ocean basins and is primarily dependent on the [[Water (molecule)#Density of saltwater and ice|density of sea water]]. Ocean currents such as the [[Gulf Stream]] are [[wind]]-driven surface currents.

==Ocean heat content==
[[File:Oceans of Climate Change.ogv|thumbnail|right|[https://climate.nasa.gov/climate_reel/OceansClimateChange640360 Oceans of Climate Change] NASA]]
{{Further|Oceanic heat content}}
[[Oceanic heat content]] (OHC) refers to the heat stored in the ocean. The changes in the ocean heat play an important role in [[sea level rise]], because of [[thermal expansion]]. Ocean warming accounts for 90% of the energy accumulation from [[global warming]] between 1971 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author= IPCC|author-link= Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|authors= |date= 2013|title= Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis|url= http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|page= 8|docket= |access-date= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oceanographic institutions==
[[File:Musée Océanographique de Monaco.jpg|thumbnail|[[Oceanographic Museum]]]]
{{see also|List of oceanographic institutions and programs}}
The first international organization of oceanography was created in 1902 as the [[International Council for the Exploration of the Sea]]. In 1903 the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] was founded, followed by [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] in 1930, [[Virginia Institute of Marine Science]] in 1938, and later the [[Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory]] at [[Columbia University]], and the [[University of Washington#Organization|School of Oceanography]] at [[University of Washington]]. In Britain, the [[National Oceanography Centre]] (an institute of the [[Natural Environment Research Council]]) is the successor to the UK's Institute of Oceanographic Sciences. In Australia, [[CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research]] (CMAR), is a leading centre. In 1921 the [[International Hydrographic Bureau]] (IHB) was formed in [[Monaco]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32123">The '''Penn–Calvert boundary dispute''' (also known as '''''Penn vs. Baltimore''''') was a long-running legal conflict between [[William Penn]] and his heirs on one side, and [[Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore]] and his heirs on the other side. The overlapping nature of their charters of land in [[Colonial America]] required numerous attempts at mediation, surveying, and intervention by the king and courts of [[England]] to ultimately be resolved. Subsequent questions over these charters have also been adjudicated by American arbitrators and the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. The boundary dispute shaped the eventual borders of five U.S. states: [[Pennsylvania]], [[Maryland]], [[Delaware]], [[New Jersey]], and [[West Virginia]].

==Background==
In 1629, [[Samuel Godin]] and [[Samuel Blommaert]] sent agents of the [[Dutch West India Company]] to negotiate with the local [[Nanticoke tribe]] to purchase land on [[Cape Henlopen]] near present-day [[Lewes, Delaware]]. With the support of [[New Netherland]]'s colonial leadership at [[New Amsterdam]], a new colony named [[Zwaanendael Colony|Zwaanendael]] was established on the purchased land in 1631 by [[David Pietersz. de Vries|David Pietersz de Vries]]. The colony proved to be very short-lived, as conflicts with the Nanticoke led to it being wiped out within a year. A second attempt at establishing a colony at that location in 1632 was soon abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uex2budtSOUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA136&amp;dq=&amp;hl=nl#v=onepage&amp;q=Swanendael&amp;f=false |title=New Netherland: a Dutch colony in seventeenth-century America by Jaap Jacobs, p. 115 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delawareliving.com/history.html |title=History |publisher=Delawareliving.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.delaware.gov/museums/zm/swanendael_settlement.shtml |title=Swanendael Settlement |publisher=Delaware Division of Historical and Cultural Affairs |date= |accessdate=2015-03-20}} The division maintains a monument at the site of the original colony as well as a [[Zwaanendael Museum|museum]] dedicated to interpreting its history.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 20, 1632, King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] granted [[Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore]] a [[History of Maryland#Colonial Maryland|charter]] for land along the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. The northern boundary of the charter was the [[40th parallel north|40th parallel]], and the eastern boundary was the [[Delaware Bay]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. However, the charter only granted the Calverts the right to "uncultivated" lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/17th_century/ma01.asp |title=The Charter of Maryland: 1632 |publisher=Yale Law School's Avalon Project |date= |accessdate=2015-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colonists arrived in Maryland in 1634, but made no attempts at surveying the northern border or colonizing the area along the Delaware Bay.&lt;ref name="msa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc6000/sc6046/000000/000001/000000/000007/pdf/msa_sc6046_1_7.pdf |title=Maryland Geological Survey, Volume 7 |publisher=Maryland State Archives |date= |accessdate=2015-03-20}} See section "History of the Boundary Dispute Between the Baltimores and Penns Resulting in the Original Mason and Dixon Line" by Edward Bennett Matthews&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nathan"&gt;{{cite book|title =East of the Mason-Dixon Line: A History of the Delaware Boundaries |author=Nathan, Roger E.|url=http://archives.delaware.gov/eBooks/EastOfTheMasonDixonLine.epub|pages=68|publisher=Delaware Public Archives |accessdate=2015-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The colony of [[New Sweden]] was established north of the Delaware Bay, at [[Fort Christina]] near present-day [[Wilmington, Delaware]], in 1638. Viewing this as an incursion into their territory, the Dutch in 1651 established a new outpost, [[Fort Casimir]] at present-day [[New Castle, Delaware]], south of Fort Christina. The Swedes conquered Fort Casimir in 1654, but [[Peter Stuyvesant]], the Director-General of New Netherland, retaliated and in 1655, he both took back Fort Casmir and conquered Fort Christina. Stuyvesant renamed Fort Casimir as New Amstel, and placed a deputy there to oversee the entire region, reporting back to Stuyvesant at New Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=160&amp;ResourceType=Site|title=Fort Christina|accessdate=2015-03-20|work=National Historic Landmark summary listing|publisher=National Park Service|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206074617/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=160&amp;ResourceType=Site|archivedate=2007-12-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftch"&gt;{{Cite journal|url={{NHLS url|id=66000260}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Fort Christina|author=Richard Greenwood|date=July 21, 1975|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English objected to the colonization attempts of both Sweden and the Netherlands and Maryland sent a delegate to New Amstel in 1659 protesting their presence on land granted to Lord Baltimore.&lt;ref name="nathan" /&gt; However, it wasn't until 1664 when the English would formally act against their colonial rivals. That year King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] granted his brother [[James II of England|James, the Duke of York]], all the land between the [[Connecticut River|Connecticut]] and Delaware Rivers. Fort Amsterdam was captured on September 8, 1664, and Stuyvesant formally surrendered the territories of New Netherland the next day. The colonial outposts along the Delaware Bay surrendered as well soon after, and New Amstel was renamed New Castle by the English—though it was still governed by a deputy reporting to New Amsterdam, now named New York after the Duke, even though the Duke had not received a charter from the king for these lands.&lt;ref name="ftch" /&gt;

In 1681, William Penn was granted a [[History of Pennsylvania#British colonial period|charter]] for Pennsylvania by Charles II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/17th_century/pa01.asp |title=The Charter of Pennsylvania: 1681 |publisher=Yale Law School's Avalon Project |date= |accessdate=2015-03-20}} This charter included the first documentary mention of the carve-out of a twelve mile circle around the town of New Castle.&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Baltimore (now Cecil's son, Charles Calvert) did not object to the grant, as long as Penn's land was north of Maryland's northern border, the 40th parallel. In addition, James was allowed to retain the lands around New Castle that he had won through conquest, as Charles carved out a [[Twelve-Mile Circle]] around New Castle. Penn, who desired ocean access for his colony, convinced James to lease these lands to him as well, and so in August 1682, the Duke of York granted Penn the Twelve Mile Circle around New Castle as well as the lands south, to Cape Henlopen. Though James had deeded these lands to Penn, James himself did not formally receive a charter to the Delaware lands until March 22, 1683.&lt;ref name="nathan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="soder"&gt;{{cite book|title=William Penn and the Founding of Pennsylvania: A Documentary History |author=Soderlund, Jean R. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RP-IRN8PDnUC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;lpg=PA185|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |accessdate=2015-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penn sailed to the colonies and, in May 1683, he met with Calvert in New Castle. The two men disagreed on how the boundaries should be determined, including where the southern boundary of Pennsylvania should be and how the size of the Twelve Mile Circle should be judged. This meeting marked the beginning of the long legal dispute.&lt;ref name="nathan" /&gt;

==History of the boundary dispute==
Penn wanted his new colony to have access to the Chesapeake Bay, while Calvert was adamant that the 40th parallel should serve as the southernmost border of Pennsylvania and he insisted the lands on the Delaware Bay were included in the original 1632 charter for Maryland. Because the two could not agree, Penn decided to go to court. Both Penn and Calvert returned to England to participate in the case. By this time, the Duke of York had ascended to the throne as James II. Penn thought his chances in court were good, as he and James were friends and allies. He invoked the Zwaanendael Colony in making his case: the Maryland charter was only for "uncultivated" lands, but the Dutch had cultivated the area near the Delaware Bay by founding a colony that predated the charter. This argument had also been made by the Dutch themselves when Maryland protested the colony in 1659. This proved to be the decisive point.&lt;ref name="ohio"&gt;{{cite book|title=Message and Reports Made to the General Assembly and Governor of the State of Ohio for the Year: 1856, Part 1 |author=Ohio|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5kNAAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA589 |publisher=books.google.com |accessdate=2015-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scharf"&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Delaware : 1609-1888: General history |author=Scharf, John Thomas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=864yAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA123&amp;lpg=PA112|publisher=books.google.com |accessdate=2015-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Committee for Trade and Plantations agreed that Baltimore's charter was only for uncultivated land, and the presence of Christians in the disputed territory prior to, and after, his settlement of the region meant it could not be his. On November 7, 1685, James issued a decision which called for a compromise. He ordered that the land between the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays be divided in half, with a line west from Cape Henlopen intersecting with a line drawn south from the 40th parallel. James kept the northern border of Maryland at the 40th parallel. Calvert still did not have the border surveyed, however. In December, 1688, King James gave Penn a new and more defined charter for the Delaware holdings.&lt;ref name="msa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nathan" /&gt;

On July 20, 1701, the people of the Lower Counties (now Delaware) petitioned Penn for a separate legislature and administrative officers from Pennsylvania's. Penn granted the request on August 28, and he commissioned a survey of the Twelve Mile Circle to determine the formal boundaries between Pennsylvania and the Lower Counties. Isaac Taylor of Pennsylvania and Thomas Piersons of New Castle were selected as the surveyors. They began their survey at a dyke in New Castle in September 1701, and ended their survey of the boundary arc in October. There were a number of errors in their survey. This was the first formal attempt to determine the boundaries created by the Twelve-Mile Circle, but far from the last.&lt;ref name="nathan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="soder" /&gt;

Charles Calvert petitioned Queen [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] in 1709 to dismiss the portions of the 1683 ruling which had granted Penn land below the 40th parallel. Penn opposed Calvert's petition, and on June 23, 1710, the queen dismissed it. After the queen's ruling, both the Pennsylvania and Delaware assemblies accepted the Taylor-Piersons boundaries.&lt;ref name="msa" /&gt; This did not resolve the issue of border disputes on the ground. There were continued instances of the Maryland government granting land to Marylanders within the Delaware borders, and clashes between sheriffs in the two territories over appropriate jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="scharf" /&gt; Further, the Delaware Assembly repealed its approval of the circular boundaries just one year after approving them.&lt;ref name="msa" /&gt;

Charles Calvert, the 3rd Lord Baltimore, died in 1715, and William Penn died in 1718. [[Benedict Calvert, 4th Baron Baltimore]] died just two months after his father, so the boundary dispute was carried forth by [[Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore]] on Maryland's side, and by Penn's children [[John Penn ("the American")|John]], [[Thomas Penn|Thomas]], and [[Richard Penn, Sr.|Richard]] on the Pennsylvania side.

===The 1732 Agreement===
The discovery that the Twelve Mile Circle did not actually intersect with the 40th parallel, and that the parallel was actually north of [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania's major city, precipitated further disputes over the border. Each side attempted to surreptitiously conduct one-sided surveys of the borders. In 1722, Calvert complained to the Maryland Council that the Chief Justice of Cecil County had been arrested by Pennsylvania for "running out some lines" in the forest; Maryland, in turn, arrested Isaac Taylor, the surveyor who had earlier worked on the circle, for an incursion into Maryland territory.&lt;ref name="msa" /&gt; Conflicts between settlers such as [[Cresap's War]] and questions surrounding to which proprietor they owed taxes prompted both sides to desire a settlement. In 1731, Calvert petitioned King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] to force the Penns to agree to a formal demarcation of the boundaries. The matter was referred to the Committee for Trade and Plantations once more. Calvert insisted the boundary should remain the 40th parallel, while the Penns argued it should be placed 20 miles south of Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="nathan" /&gt;

The King and Committee convinced the two sides to come to another compromise. On May 10, 1732, Calvert and the Penns signed an Article of Agreement which reaffirmed much of the 1685 ruling, but adjusted Pennsylvania's southern boundary below the 40th parallel. The agreement stated that the peninsula would be divided by a line running west from Cape Henlopen to the middle of the peninsula, and from that middle point a line would be drawn north to a point tangent to the Twelve Mile Circle. From the tangent point, a line would be drawn along the circle until it was due north of the tangent point, at which point it would go due north again until it was intersected by an east-west line which would be placed 15 miles south of Philadelphia. The map included in the agreement, however, incorrectly labeled [[Fenwick Island, Delaware]] as Cape Henlopen. That point was 19 miles south of the actual Cape Henlopen.&lt;ref name="msa2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/speccol/1399/reports/html/260s5.html |title=Lord Baltimore's Own Plan - Huntingfield Map Collection |publisher=Maryland State Archives |date= |accessdate=2015-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:New Castle Court House Museum.jpg|thumb|right|The cupola of the New Castle Court House was used as the center of the Twelve Mile Circle. The boundary Commissions met here numerous times over the years.]]
The Articles of Agreement also created a new Commission to oversee the implementation of the boundary agreement and the placing of monuments to formally mark the borders. Each party appointed 7 members to the Commission, which was to be led by the governors of the two colonies. The Pennsylvania Commissioners included Governor [[Patrick Gordon (governor)|Patrick Gordon]], [[Isaac Norris]], [[Samuel Preston (mayor)|Samuel Preston]], [[James Logan (statesman)|James Logan]], and [[Andrew Hamilton (lawyer)|Andrew Hamilton]]. The Maryland Commissioners included Governor [[Samuel Ogle]], former Governor [[Charles Calvert (governor)|Charles Calvert]], and [[Benjamin Tasker, Sr.]].&lt;ref name="brev"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Breviate in the Boundary Dispute Between Pennsylvania and Maryland |author=Court of Chancery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uEYOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA41|publisher=books.google.com |accessdate=2015-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission held its first meeting in [[Chestertown, Maryland]]. They subsequently met four times at New Castle's [[New Castle Court House Museum|Court House]], once in [[Joppa, Maryland]], and once in Philadelphia. The Commission could not agree on several points of contention related to the Twelve Mile Circle. First, the Maryland Commissioners insisted that a circle must have a center point and they were not empowered to determine what the center point was. Second, the Maryland Commissioners insisted the circle should have a circumference of 12 miles, while the Pennsylvania Commissioners insisted it should have a radius of 12 miles.&lt;ref name="brev" /&gt; Lord Baltimore had also discovered the mapping error that resulted in Fenwick Island being used as the southernmost boundary point in the Articles of Agreement, rather than Cape Henlopen, and he protested this.&lt;ref name="msa2" /&gt;

Despite being empowered to resolve the conflict, the Commissioners ultimately signed a statement saying they could not come to an accord. Following this failure, Lord Baltimore filed a new petition in the English courts, and the Penns filed a counter-petition. King George II issued a decree on May 4, 1738 barring either proprietor from making any land grants in the disputed territory, and creating temporary boundary lines.&lt;ref name="nathan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brev" /&gt;

===The Court of Chancery suit===
After filing their petitions in court, both sides and their agents began compiling witness depositions in Philadelphia, New Castle, and throughout Maryland.&lt;ref name="msa" /&gt; The petitions filed by Calvert and the Penns were finally addressed by the English [[Court of Chancery]] in 1750. After reviewing the colonial deeds, the agreements made by the various parties over the decades, and after hearing testimony from both sides, on May 15, 1750, [[Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke]], the [[Lord Chancellor]], ruled that the Agreement of 1732 should be binding. He ordered the appointment of new Commissioners to oversee the drawing of the boundaries. He also resolved the questions that had stopped the first round of Commissioners, determining that the center of the circle would be the center of New Castle, the circle would have a 12-mile radius, and Fenwick Island (rather than Cape Henlopen) would be used as the southern boundary as agreed upon in the 1732 agreement.&lt;ref name="nathan" /&gt;

[[File:Transpen-line.gif|thumb|left|The Transpeninsular Line, the southernmost disputed boundary]]
The new Commission included [[William Allen (loyalist)|William Allen]], [[Benjamin Chew]], [[Thomas Hopkinson]], Rev. [[Richard Peters (priest)|Richard Peters]], [[Ryves Holt House|Ryves Holt]], and [[Tench Francis, Sr.]] from Pennsylvania and Delaware, and [[Benedict Swingate Calvert|Benedict Calvert]], [[Benjamin Tasker, Jr.]], [[George Plater]], and [[Daniel Dulany the Elder|Daniel Dulaney Sr.]] from Maryland. They held their first meeting in the Assembly Room of the New Castle Court House on November 14, 1750. The Commissioners proposed that the Court House should be considered the "center" of New Castle and so the 12 Mile Circle should be based around the cupola at the top of the building.&lt;ref name="watson"&gt;{{cite web|jstor=20086187|title=Penn Versus Baltimore. Journal of John Watson, Assistant Surveyor to the Commissioners of the Province of Pennsylvania, 1750  |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cliveden"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cliveden.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/chronology.pdf |title=Chew Family Chronology |publisher=Cliveden.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commissioners then hired a survey team (consisting of John Lukens and Archibald McClean from Pennsylvania, and John Riggs and Thomas Garnett from Maryland) to map the line dividing the northern half of the peninsula from the southern half, by going from Fenwick Island west. This survey was named the [[Transpeninsular Line]]. The first Transpeninsular Monument was placed at the easternmost point. The team completed the survey by June 1751.&lt;ref name="nathan" /&gt;

However, the Commissioners, meeting in New Castle in October, could not agree if the westernmost point of the line should be the Chesapeake Bay or Slaughter Creek. Since the middle point could not be determined without agreement on the western point, the survey could not be completed. They also disagreed if the measurements for the Twelve Mile Circle should be taken on the ground, which would incorporate hills and valleys (thus making the circle smaller and giving more land to Calvert), or if they should be measured in a straight level (making the radius a full twelve miles and giving more land to the Penns). The Commissioners referred the issues to Lord Hardwicke. Hardwicke ruled that the western point of the Transpeninsular Line should be the Chesapeake Bay. He also approved of the use of the New Castle Court House as the center of the Twelve Mile Circle and determined that the twelve miles should be measured on a level line.&lt;ref name="msa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nathan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="msa2" /&gt;

===Resolution===
In 1751, Charles Calvert died. His son, [[Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore]], did not wish to be bound by any agreements his father had made. This froze the resolution of the boundary dispute again, and surveying efforts came to a halt. But by 1760, Calvert relented, and he entered into an agreement on July 4 which matched the 1732 agreement and the Chancellor's Decree of 1750. In November of that year, the Commissioners met in New Castle, agreed to the Transpeninsular Survey results, and placed the Middle Point marker.&lt;ref name="cliveden" /&gt; The southernmost boundary was finally completed.&lt;ref name="nathan" /&gt;

[[File:Mason-dixon-line.gif|thumb|right|The Mason–Dixon line]]
In 1761, the colonial surveyors made an attempt at surveying the Twelve mile circle by laying a chain in a line from the Court House's cupola, but they were unsuccessful due their tools and bad calculations. They tried again in 1763, but the line was still off. The two parties agreed to replace the colonial surveyors with a team from England. A contract between the Penns, Baltimore, and [[Charles Mason]] and [[Jeremiah Dixon]] was signed on July 20, 1763.&lt;ref name="nathan" /&gt; Mason and Dixon arrived in Philadelphia on November 15, 1763, where they met with the boundary Commissioners.&lt;ref name="cliveden" /&gt;

Mason and Dixon's first task was to determine the southernmost point of [[Center City, Philadelphia|Philadelphia]], where they built an observatory. They then proceeded 31 miles west where they set up their headquarters for the project on the Harlan Farm in [[Embreeville, Pennsylvania|Embreeville]] and erected a stone as a reference point. The stone is known now as the [[Star Gazers' Stone]]. After doing additional observation and surveying work, they established the east-west boundary line between Pennsylvania and Maryland. In August 1764, they ran a line from the New Castle Court House to determine the correct tangent point. From September 4–25, they surveyed the north-south line down to the Middle Point Marker.&lt;ref name="msa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nathan" /&gt;

In November, Mason and Dixon met with the Commissioners in [[Christiana, Delaware]] and the Commissioners approved their results. From December 17, 1765 – January 1, 1766, they placed monument stones under the supervision of one commissioner from each colony. In 1767, they mapped the western line as far as possible before turning back. The surveyors presented their finalized boundaries to the Commissioners at Christiana in November, 1767. They departed America on September 11, 1768.&lt;ref name="msa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nathan" /&gt;

Baltimore and the Penns petitioned King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] for approval of the Mason-Dixon boundaries on August 20, 1768. King George approved the boundaries on January 11, 1769—over eighty-five years after the beginning of the dispute. Both proprietary families subsequently lost their colonies in the [[American Revolution]], just seven years later.&lt;ref name="nathan" /&gt;

==Subsequent disputes==
Though the legal dispute between the Penns and the Calverts ended when the king signed off on their agreed upon boundaries, and when they later lost their proprietary rights to the colonies, there have been numerous additional legal disagreements over the borders and surveying attempts. In 1820, New Jersey disputed Delaware's right to cede [[Pea Patch Island]] to the United States government since the island was primarily on the New Jersey side of the river. Secretary of War [[John C. Calhoun]] requested a legal opinion from Attorney General [[William Wirt (Attorney General)|William Wirt]], who in turn consulted with [[George Read, Jr.]] and former Attorney General [[Caesar Augustus Rodney|Caesar A. Rodney]]. The two wrote a report detailing the history of the colonial deeds and the long-running struggle between the Penns and Calverts in the courts, and stated that the colonial deeds entitled Delaware to the entirety of the Delaware River within the boundaries of the Twelve-Mile Circle. After conflicting opinions from two different circuit courts on the issue, President [[James K. Polk]] intervened in 1847 and suggested an arbitrator resolve the disagreement. [[John Sergeant (politician)|John Sergeant]] was appointed arbitrator, and in [[Independence Hall]] heard arguments from the United States (represented by Senators [[John M. Clayton]] and [[James A.

Bibb]]) regarding that same history of colonial deeds. Sergeant's ruling relied in part on Hardwicke's decision in ''Penn v. Baltimore''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TlMrAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1124&amp;lpg=PA1124|title=The Federal Cases: Comprising Cases Argued and Determined in the Circuit and District Courts of the United States from the Earliest Times to the Beginning of the Federal Reporter, Arranged Alphabetically by the Titles of the Cases and Numbered Consecutively, Book 30|author=West Publishing Company| accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Jersey contested the circle's borders again in 1872, when Delaware arrested several New Jersey fishermen and New Jersey claimed ownership of the [[Delaware River]] up to the middle point. The issue has been adjudicated by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] several times (primarily in 1877, 1934, and 2007) in cases named ''[[New Jersey v. Delaware]]''. The extensive history of the circle and border dispute were documented by Justice [[Benjamin N. Cardozo]] in the 1934 case, where he cited the decisions by both Lord Chancellor Hardwicke and the arbitrator Sergeant.&lt;ref name="findlaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/291/361.html |title=''State of New Jersey v.

==Legal precedent==
As one of the earliest attempts by the courts to adjudicate boundary disputes between colonies or states in America, ''Penn v. Baltimore'' has also been relied upon as precedent for numerous other cases involving American boundary disputes, particularly Hardwicke's assertion that "long possession and enjoyment... is one of the best evidence of title to lands or districts of lands in America."&lt;ref name="landmark"&gt;{{cite book|title =Landmark Cases in Equity |author=Mitchell, Charles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=opV6BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT96&amp;lpg=PT96|publisher=books.google.com |accessdate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court cited Lord Chancellor Hardwicke's legal reasoning in ''[[Rhode Island v.

Baltimore'' in the case of ''[[New York v. Connecticut]]'', 4 U.S. 1 (1799), which was the first case heard by the Supreme Court under its [[original jurisdiction]] authority to resolve disputes between states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tr00ikTi3Z4C&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95 |title=Judicial Settlement of Controversies Between States of the American Union |author=Scott, James Brown|publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of ''[[Hans v. Louisiana]]'', 134 US 1 (1890), the Court noted that while some types of lawsuits were not contemplated by the framers of the Constitution, ''Penn v. Baltimore'' "shows that some of these unusual subjects of litigation were not unknown to the courts even in colonial times."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=134&amp;invol=1 |title=FindLaw &amp;#124; Cases and Codes &amp;#124; ''Hans v. Louisiana'', 134 U.S. 1 |publisher=laws.findlaw.com|accessdate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his opinion, Hardwicke also established the legal concept that equity judgments can be made ''in personam''. When Lord Baltimore objected to the Court's jurisdiction over foreign soil or royal colonies, Hardwicke dismissed the objection and determined that he could indeed act since he was ruling upon a contractual agreement made in England (the 1732 Agreement), and both parties to the agreement were present before the Court and subject to its powers of contempt and sequestration.&lt;ref name="landmark" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title =Modern Studies in Property Law, Volume 5 |author=Dixon, Martin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwbcBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA190|publisher=books.google.com |accessdate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court has cited this view in cases such as ''[[Pennoyer v.

In [[biology]], a '''propagule''' is any material that functions in propagating an organism to the next stage in its life cycle, such as by [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]]. The propagule is usually distinct in form from the parent organism. Propagules are produced by [[plants]] (in the form of [[seeds]] or [[spores]]), [[fungi]] (in the form of [[spores]]), and [[bacteria]] (for example [[Endospore|endospores]] or [[Microbial cyst|microbial cysts]]).&lt;ref name="Chuang"&gt;T.Y. Chuang and W.H. Ko. 1981. Propagule size: Its relation to population density of microorganisms in soil. Soil Biology and Biochemistry. 13(3).&lt;/ref&gt;

In disease biology, [[pathogen]]s are said to generate '''infectious propagules''', the units that transmit a [[disease]]. These can refer to [[bacteria]], [[viruses]], [[fungi]], or [[protists]], and can be contained within host material.&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;David H. Ellis and Tania J. Pfeiffer. 1990. Ecology, life cycle, and infectious propagule of Cryptococcus neoformans. The Lancet. 336(8720).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sasaki"&gt;Akira Sasaki and Yoh Iwasa. 1991.

Kay. 2012. Insect Pathology. Academic Press. &lt;/ref&gt; For instance, for [[influenza]], the infectious propagules are carried in droplets of host [[saliva]] or [[mucus]] that are expelled during coughing or sneezing.

In [[horticulture]], a '''propagule''' is any [[plant]] material used for the purpose of [[plant propagation]].  In [[asexual reproduction]], a propagule is often a stem [[Cutting (plant)|cutting]]. In some plants, a [[leaf]] section or a portion of root can be used. In [[sexual reproduction]], a propagule is a [[seed]] or [[spore]].  In [[micropropagation]], a type of [[asexual reproduction]], any part of the plant may be used, though it is usually a highly [[meristematic]] part such as root and stem ends or buds.&lt;ref name="Hartmann"&gt;Hartmann and Kester's Plant Propagation, Seventh Edition. &lt;/ref&gt;

A '''range road''' in Canada is a road that runs north–south along a range grid line of the [[Dominion Land Survey]].  Range roads (Rge. Rd.) are perpendicular to [[Roads in Saskatchewan#Township roads and range roads|township roads]] (Twp. Rd.) which run east–west along the [[Township (Canada)|township]] grid lines.

== Western Canada ==
In western [[Canada]] (especially rural areas in most [[counties]] and [[municipal district]]s in [[Alberta]]), a range road (abbreviated "RGE. RD.") is a road running on a north-south parallel to a [[range line]] (a line denoting the east and west boundaries of a {{convert|6|mi|km|adj=on}} x {{convert|6|mi|km|adj=on}} legal [[township (Canada)|township]] in the [[Dominion Land Survey]] and [[Alberta Township System|Alberta Township]] land surveying systems).

== Alberta ==
Range roads are commonly numbered in one-mile (1.6-km) increments west from the east range line of a given township. The range roads form the east and west boundaries (known as Section Lines) of the 1 mile x 1 mile square sections - 36 of which comprise a township (e.g. Range Road 12-2 would be between the second and third sections west of Range line 12, Range Road 6-0 is on Range line 6). In many counties, the dash between the range line number and the section line number is eliminated (Range Road 15-1 (151) might be called "Range Road one-fifty-one"). Where a township road offset from a section line, it is often appended with a letter (Range Road 11-1A is just west of the first section line west of Range line 11). This system is useful for finding farmsteads (assuming one knows the legal address of the parcel).

Range roads are perpendicular to [[township road]]s (abbreviated TWP. RD.). In the [[Municipal District of Foothills No. 31]], the range and township road naming system has been replaced with a more conventional "street/avenue" numbering scheme. Range roads are [[street]]s numbered west and east of the [[114th meridian west|Fifth Meridian]] (Meridian Street) in increments of 16 streets to the mile. Township Roads are [[Avenue (landscape)|avenues]] numbered on a similar grid to the city of [[Calgary]] (the boundary lies between 190th and 220th Avenue) and extends out to 722nd Avenue. This system causes confusion at the southern boundary of the City of Calgary as streets in Calgary are numbered east and west of Centre Street, which is some distance west of the Fifth Meridian. Therefore, street numbers change as one crosses [[Calgary]]'s southern boundary.

== Saskatchewan ==
In Saskatchewan there are both [[Roads in Saskatchewan#Township roads and range roads|township and range roads]].  The numbers of the range roads help to establish the location of the roads as they exist with relation to the legal land description survey system.  Range roads travel in a north and south direction between the meridians parallel to the latitudinal lines.  Range roads indicate firstly the meridian number.  In Saskatchewan roads near the Manitoba border would begin with 1 as they would be west of the prime or first meridian, then the range numbers would be west of the second and finally west of the 3rd meridian.  There are no roads in Saskatchewan west of the fourth meridian as the fourth meridian line defines the border between [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]].  The next two digits would be the range number which increments from east to west from a meridian line.  The last range number shows how many miles within the range the road is located starting at the easternmost edge of the range and traveling west.&lt;ref name="Tsp-Rge"&gt;{{Cite web

Township and Range roads can be either gravel, highway, or municipal paved road.  The Dominion Land Survey system designated a township road allowance every two miles apart south to north, and allowed for a range road allowance every mile apart east to west.&lt;ref name="atlas"&gt;{{cite book

Due to the curvature of the [[Earth]], some townships adjacent to major [[meridian (geography)|Meridian]] lines (e.g. the Fifth Meridian - 114°W) are truncated. There are more townships between meridian lines along the 49th [[Circle of latitude|Parallel]] (the boundary between [[Canada]] and the [[United States of America]]) than there are along the 60th Parallel (the boundary between Canada's southern [[provinces]] and northern [[Territory (country subdivision)|territories]]).

'''Regional geography''' is a major branch of [[geography]]. It focuses on the interaction of different cultural and natural geofactors in a specific land or landscape, while its counterpart, systematic geography, concentrates on a specific geofactor at the global level. 

== Basics ==
Attention is paid to unique characteristics of a particular region such as natural elements, human elements, and [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalization]] which covers the techniques of delineating space into [[region]]s. Rooted in the tradition of the German speaking countries, the two pillars of regional geography are the idiographic study of ''Länder'' or spatial individuals (specific places, countries, continents) and the typological study of ''Landschaften'' or spatial types (landscapes such as coastal regions, mountain regions, border regions, etc.).

== Approach ==
Regional geography is also a certain approach to geographical study, comparable to [[quantitative revolution|quantitative geography]] or [[critical geography]]. This approach prevailed during the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, a period when then regional geography paradigm was central within the geographical sciences. It was later criticised for its descriptiveness and the lack of theory. Strong criticism was leveled against it in particular during the 1950s and the [[quantitative revolution]]. Main critics were G. H. T. Kimble&lt;ref&gt;Kimble, G.H.T. (1951): ''The Inadequacy of the Regional Concept'', London Essays in Geography, edd. L.D. Stamp and S.W. Wooldridge, pp. 492-512.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fred K. Schaefer]].&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, F.K. (1953): ''Exceptionalism in Geography: A Methodological Examination'', [[Annals of the Association of American Geographers]], vol. 43, pp. 226-245.&lt;/ref&gt; The regional geography paradigm has influenced many other geographical sciences, including [[economic geography]] and [[geomorphology]]. Regional geography is still taught in some universities as a study of the major regions of the world, such as Northern and Latin America, Europe, and Asia and their countries. In addition, the notion of a city-region approach to the study of geography, underlining urban-rural interactions, gained credence since the mid-1980s. Some geographers have also attempted to reintroduce a certain amount of regionalism since the 1980s. This involves a complex definition of regions and their interactions with other [[scale (spatial)|scale]]s.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, G. and Jones, M. (2001): ''Renewing The Geography of Regions'', Environment and Planning D, 16(9), pp. 669-695.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable figures ==
Notable figures in regional geography were [[Alfred Hettner]] in Germany, with his concept of [[chorology]]; [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]] in France, with the [[Possibilism (geography)|possibilism]] approach (possibilism being a softer notion than [[environmental determinism]]); and, in the United States, [[Richard Hartshorne]] with his concept of areal differentiation. The school of [[Carl O. Sauer]], strongly influenced by  Alfred Hettner and Paul Vidal de la Blache, is also seen as regional geography in its broadest sense.

A '''rotating frame of reference''' is a special case of a [[non-inertial reference frame]] that is [[rotation|rotating]] relative to an [[inertial reference frame]]. An everyday example of a rotating reference frame is the surface of the [[Earth]]. (This article considers only frames rotating about a fixed axis. For more general rotations, see [[Euler angles#Relationship with physical motions|Euler angles]].)

==Fictitious forces==
{{main|Fictitious forces}}
All [[non-inertial reference frame]]s exhibit [[fictitious force]]s; rotating reference frames are characterized by three:&lt;ref name=Arnold&gt;{{cite book |title=Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics |page=130 |author=Vladimir Igorević Arnolʹd |edition=2nd |isbn=978-0-387-96890-2 |date=1989 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pd8-s6rOt_cC&amp;pg=PT149&amp;dq=%22additional+terms+called+inertial+forces.+This+allows+us+to+detect+experimentally%22#PPT150,M1 |publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* the [[centrifugal force (fictitious)|centrifugal force]],
* the [[Coriolis force]],
and, for non-uniformly rotating reference frames,
* the [[Euler force]].

Scientists in a rotating box can measure the speed and direction of their rotation by measuring these fictitious forces.  For example, [[Léon Foucault]] was able to show the Coriolis force that results from Earth's rotation using the [[Foucault pendulum]].  If Earth were to rotate many times faster, these fictitious forces could be felt by humans, as they are when on a spinning [[carousel]].

==Relating rotating frames to stationary frames==
The following is a derivation of the formulas for accelerations as well as fictitious forces in a rotating frame. It begins with the relation between a particle's coordinates in a rotating frame and its coordinates in an inertial (stationary) frame. Then, by taking time derivatives, formulas are derived that relate the velocity of the particle as seen in the two frames, and the acceleration relative to each frame. Using these accelerations, the fictitious forces are identified by comparing Newton's second law as formulated in the two different frames.

=== Relation between positions in the two frames ===

To derive these fictitious forces, it's helpful to be able to convert between the coordinates &lt;math&gt;\left( x',y',z' \right)&lt;/math&gt; of the rotating reference frame and the coordinates &lt;math&gt;\left( x, y, z \right)&lt;/math&gt; of an [[inertial reference frame]] with the same origin.  If the rotation is about the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axis with a constant [[angular velocity]] &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, or {{nobreak|&lt;math&gt;\theta(t) {{=}} \Omega t&lt;/math&gt;}}, and the two reference frames coincide at time &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;, the transformation from rotating coordinates to inertial coordinates can be written

: &lt;math&gt;x = x'\cos\left(\theta(t)\right) - y'\sin\left(\theta(t)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;y =  x'\sin\left(\theta(t)\right) + y'\cos\left(\theta(t)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

whereas the reverse transformation is

: &lt;math&gt;x' = x\cos\left(-\theta(t)\right) - y\sin\left( -\theta(t) \right)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;y' =  x\sin\left( -\theta(t)\right) + y\cos\left( -\theta(t) \right)&lt;/math&gt;

This result can be obtained from a [[rotation matrix]].

Introduce the unit vectors &lt;math&gt;\hat{\boldsymbol{\imath}},\ \hat{\boldsymbol{\jmath}},\ \hat{\boldsymbol{k}}&lt;/math&gt; representing standard unit basis vectors in the rotating frame. The time-derivatives of these unit vectors are found next. Suppose the frames are aligned at ''t = ''0 and the ''z''-axis is the axis of rotation. Then for a counterclockwise rotation through angle ''&amp;Omega;t'':

: &lt;math&gt;\hat{\boldsymbol{\imath}}(t) = (\cos\theta(t),\ \sin \theta(t) ) &lt;/math&gt;

where the (''x'', ''y'') components are expressed in the stationary frame. Likewise,

: &lt;math&gt;\hat{\boldsymbol{\jmath}}(t) = (-\sin \theta(t),\ \cos \theta(t) ) \ .&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the time derivative of these vectors, which rotate without changing magnitude, is

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\hat{\boldsymbol{\imath}}(t) = \Omega (-\sin \theta(t), \ \cos \theta(t))=  \Omega \hat{\boldsymbol{\jmath}} \ ; &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\hat{\boldsymbol{\jmath}}(t) = \Omega (-\cos \theta(t), \ -\sin \theta(t))= - \Omega \hat{\boldsymbol{\imath}} \ , &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Omega \equiv \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\theta(t)&lt;/math&gt;.
This result is the same as found using a [[vector cross product]] with the rotation vector &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Omega}&lt;/math&gt; pointed along the z-axis of rotation &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Omega}=(0,\ 0,\ \Omega)&lt;/math&gt;, namely,

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\hat{\boldsymbol{u}} = \boldsymbol{\Omega \times}\hat {\boldsymbol{ u}} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\hat {\boldsymbol{ u}}&lt;/math&gt; is either &lt;math&gt;\hat{\boldsymbol{\imath}}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; \hat{\boldsymbol{\jmath}}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Time derivatives in the two frames ===
Introduce the unit vectors &lt;math&gt;\hat{\boldsymbol{\imath}},\ \hat{\boldsymbol{\jmath}},\ \hat{\boldsymbol{k}}&lt;/math&gt; representing standard unit basis vectors in the rotating frame. As they rotate they will remain normalized. If we let them rotate at the speed of &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt; about an axis &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol {\Omega}&lt;/math&gt; then each unit vector &lt;math&gt;\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}&lt;/math&gt; of the rotating coordinate system abides by the following equation:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}=\boldsymbol{\Omega \times \hat{u}} \ .&lt;/math&gt;
Then if we have a vector function &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{f}&lt;/math&gt;, 
:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{f}(t)=f_x(t) \hat{\boldsymbol{\imath}}+f_y(t) \hat{\boldsymbol{\jmath}}+f_z(t) \hat{\boldsymbol{k}}\ , &lt;/math&gt;
and we want to examine its first derivative we have (using the [[product rule]] of differentiation):&lt;ref name=Lanczos&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?num=10&amp;btnG=Google+Search |title=The Variational Principles of Mechanics |author=Cornelius Lanczos |date=1986 |isbn=0-486-65067-7 |publisher=[[Dover Publications]] |edition=Reprint of Fourth Edition of 1970 |nopp=true |pages=Chapter 4, §5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite book |title=Classical Mechanics |author=John R Taylor |page= 342 |publisher=University Science Books |isbn=1-891389-22-X |date=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P1kCtNr-pJsC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=isbn=1-891389-22-X#PPA342,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

  \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\boldsymbol{f}
    &amp;= \frac{\mathrm{d}f_x}{\mathrm{d}t}\hat{\boldsymbol{\imath}} + \frac{\mathrm{d}\hat{\boldsymbol{\imath}}}{\mathrm{d}t}f_x + \frac{\mathrm{d}f_y}{\mathrm{d}t}\hat{\boldsymbol{\jmath}} + \frac{\mathrm{d}\hat{\boldsymbol{\jmath}}}{\mathrm{d}t}f_y + \frac{\mathrm{d}f_z}{\mathrm{d}t}\hat{\boldsymbol{k}} + \frac{\mathrm{d}\hat{\boldsymbol{k}}}{\mathrm{d}t}f_z \\

    &amp;= \left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{f}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)_r+\boldsymbol{\Omega \times f}(t)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{f}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)_r&lt;/math&gt; is the rate of change of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{f}&lt;/math&gt; as observed in the rotating coordinate system. As a shorthand the differentiation is expressed as:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\boldsymbol{f} = \left[ \left(\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)_r + \boldsymbol{\Omega  \times} \right] \boldsymbol{f} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

This result is also known as the Transport Theorem in analytical dynamics and is also sometimes referred to as the Basic Kinematic Equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Corless|first=Martin|title=Kinematics|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024121222/https://engineering.purdue.edu/AAE/Academics/Courses/aae203/2003/fall/aae203F03supp.pdf|work=Aeromechanics I Course Notes|publisher=[[Purdue University]]|accessdate=18 July 2011|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relation between velocities in the two frames ===
A velocity of an object is the time-derivative of the object's position, or

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\   \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;

The time derivative of a position &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{r}(t)&lt;/math&gt; in a rotating reference frame has two components, one from the explicit time dependence due to motion of the particle itself, and another from the frame's own rotation.  Applying the result of the previous subsection to the displacement &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{r}(t)&lt;/math&gt;, the [[velocity|velocities]] in the two reference frames are related by the equation

:&lt;math&gt; 
\mathbf{v_i} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\   \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d}t} = 
\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d}t} \right)_{\mathrm{r}} + 
\boldsymbol\Omega \times \mathbf{r} = 
\mathbf{v}_{\mathrm{r}} + \boldsymbol\Omega \times \mathbf{r} \ ,
&lt;/math&gt;
where subscript ''i'' means the inertial frame of reference, and ''r'' means the rotating frame of reference.

=== Relation between accelerations in the two frames ===
Acceleration is the second time derivative of position, or the first time derivative of velocity

:&lt;math&gt; 
\mathbf{a}_{\mathrm{i}} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\   
\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}\mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d}t^{2}}\right)_{\mathrm{i}} = 
\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}}{\mathrm{d}t} \right)_{\mathrm{i}} = 
\left[  \left( \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \right)_{\mathrm{r}} + 
\boldsymbol\Omega \times 
\right]
\left[
\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d}t} \right)_{\mathrm{r}} + 
\boldsymbol\Omega \times \mathbf{r} 
\right] \ ,
&lt;/math&gt;
where subscript ''i'' means the inertial frame of reference.
Carrying out the [[derivative|differentiation]]s and re-arranging some terms yields the acceleration in the ''rotating'' reference frame

:&lt;math&gt; 
\mathbf{a}_{\mathrm{r}} = 
\mathbf{a}_{\mathrm{i}} -
2 \boldsymbol\Omega \times \mathbf{v}_{\mathrm{r}} -
\boldsymbol\Omega \times (\boldsymbol\Omega \times \mathbf{r}) -
\frac{\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol\Omega}{\mathrm{d}t} \times \mathbf{r}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_{\mathrm{r}} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\   \left( \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}\mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d}t^{2}} \right)_{\mathrm{r}}&lt;/math&gt; is the apparent acceleration in the rotating reference frame, the term &lt;math&gt;-\boldsymbol\Omega \times (\boldsymbol\Omega \times \mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; represents [[centrifugal acceleration]], and the term &lt;math&gt;-2 \boldsymbol\Omega \times \mathbf{v}_{\mathrm{r}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Coriolis acceleration]]. The last term (&lt;math&gt;-\frac{\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol\Omega}{\mathrm{d}t} \times \mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;) is the [[Euler acceleration]] and is zero in uniformly rotating frames.

=== Newton's second law in the two frames ===
When the expression for acceleration is multiplied by the mass of the particle, the three extra terms on the right-hand side result in [[fictitious force]]s in the rotating reference frame, that is, apparent forces that result from being in a [[non-inertial reference frame]], rather than from any physical interaction between bodies.

Using [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law of motion]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=m\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain:&lt;ref name=Arnold/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lanczos/&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt;&lt;ref name=Landau&gt;{{cite book |title=Mechanics |author=LD Landau |author2=LM Lifshitz |last-author-amp=yes |page= 128 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e-xASAehg1sC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=isbn=9780750628969#PPA128,M1 |edition=Third |date=1976 |isbn=978-0-7506-2896-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hand/&gt;

* the [[Coriolis force]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{Coriolis}} = 
-2m \boldsymbol\Omega \times \mathbf{v}_{\mathrm{r}}
&lt;/math&gt;

* the [[centrifugal force (fictitious)|centrifugal force]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{centrifugal}} = 
-m\boldsymbol\Omega \times (\boldsymbol\Omega \times \mathbf{r})
&lt;/math&gt;

* and the [[Euler force]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{Euler}} = 
-m\frac{\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol\Omega}{\mathrm{d}t} \times \mathbf{r}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the object being acted upon by these [[fictitious force]]s. Notice that all three forces vanish when the frame is not rotating, that is, when &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Omega} = 0 \ . &lt;/math&gt;

For completeness, the inertial acceleration &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_{\mathrm{i}}&lt;/math&gt; due to impressed external forces &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{imp}}&lt;/math&gt; can be determined from the total physical force in the inertial (non-rotating) frame (for example, force from physical interactions such as [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic forces]]) using [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]] in the inertial frame:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{imp}} = m \mathbf{a}_{\mathrm{i}}
&lt;/math&gt;
Newton's law in the rotating frame then becomes
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F_r} = \mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{imp}} +\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{centrifugal}} +\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{Coriolis}}+\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{Euler}} = m\mathbf{a_r} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Taylor: ''Classical Mechanics''; p. 328}}

==Centrifugal force==
{{main|Centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)}}
In [[classical mechanics]], '''centrifugal force''' is an outward force associated with [[rotation]]. Centrifugal force is one of several so-called [[pseudo-force]]s (also known as [[inertial force]]s), so named because, unlike [[Fundamental interaction|real forces]], they do not originate in interactions with other bodies situated in the environment of the particle upon which they act. Instead, centrifugal force originates in the rotation of the frame of reference within which observations are made.&lt;!--

==Coriolis effect==
{{main|Coriolis effect}}
[[Image:Corioliskraftanimation.gif|frame|right|Figure 1: In the inertial frame of reference (upper part of the picture), the black object moves in a straight line. However, the observer (red dot) who is standing in the rotating frame of reference (lower part of the picture) sees the object as following a curved path.]]

The mathematical expression for the Coriolis force appeared in an 1835 paper by a French scientist [[Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis]] in connection with [[hydrodynamics]], and also in the [[Theory of tides|tidal equations]] of [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] in 1778. Early in the 20th century, the term Coriolis force began to be used in connection with [[meteorology]].

Perhaps the most commonly encountered rotating reference frame is the [[Earth]]. Moving objects on the surface of the Earth experience a Coriolis force, and appear to veer to the right in the [[northern hemisphere]], and to the left in the [[southern hemisphere|southern]]. Movements of air in the atmosphere and water in the ocean are notable examples of this behavior: rather than flowing directly from areas of high pressure to low pressure, as they would on a non-rotating planet, winds and currents tend to flow to the right of this direction north of the [[equator]], and to the left of this direction south of the equator. This effect is responsible for the rotation of large [[Cyclone#Structure|cyclones]] &lt;!--Don't add tornadoes here; the Coriolis effect is not directly responsible for tornadoes--&gt;(see [[Coriolis effect#Meteorology|Coriolis effects in meteorology]]).

==Euler force==
{{main|Euler force}}
In [[classical mechanics]], the '''Euler acceleration''' (named for [[Leonhard Euler]]), also known as '''azimuthal acceleration'''&lt;ref name=Morin&gt;{{cite book |author=David Morin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ni6CD7K2X4MC&amp;pg=PA469&amp;dq=acceleration+azimuthal+inauthor:Morin |title=Introduction to classical mechanics: with problems and solutions |page= 469 |isbn= 0-521-87622-2 |date=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''transverse acceleration'''&lt;ref name=Fowles&gt;{{cite book |author=Grant R. Fowles|author2=George L. Cassiday|last-author-amp=yes|title=Analytical Mechanics|edition=6th|page=178|date=1999|publisher=Harcourt College Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is an [[acceleration]] that appears when a non-uniformly rotating reference frame is used for analysis of motion and there is variation in the [[angular velocity]] of the [[frame of reference|reference frame]]'s axis. This article is restricted to a frame of reference that rotates about a fixed axis.

The '''Euler force''' is a [[fictitious force]] on a body that is related to the Euler acceleration by ''' ''F'' '''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''m'''a''''', where ''' ''a'' ''' is the Euler acceleration and ''m'' is the mass of the body.&lt;ref name=Battin&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the mathematics and methods of astrodynamics |page=102 |author= Richard H Battin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OjH7aVhiGdcC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;vq=Euler&amp;dq=%22Euler+acceleration%22

==Use in magnetic resonance==
It is convenient to consider [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|magnetic resonance]] in a frame that rotates at the [[Larmor frequency]] of the spins. This is illustrated in the animation below. The [[rotating wave approximation]] may also be used.

[[File:Animated Rotating Frame.gif|thumb|Animation showing the rotating frame. The red arrow is a spin in the [[Bloch sphere]] which precesses in the laboratory frame due to a static magnetic field. In the rotating frame the spin remains still until a resonantly oscillating magnetic field drives magnetic resonance.]]

'''Tsingy de Bemaraha Strict Nature Reserve''' is a [[nature reserve]] located near the western coast of [[Madagascar]] in [[Melaky]] Region at {{coord|18|40|S|44|45|E|type:landmark|name=Tsingy}}. The area was listed as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 1990 due to the unique [[geography]], preserved [[mangrove]] forests, and wild bird and [[lemur]] populations.&lt;ref name="Unesco"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/494 |title=Tsingy de Bemaraha Strict Nature Reserve |work=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=2009-11-01 |format=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shea"&gt;{{cite news

==National Park==
The southern end of the protected area has subsequently been changed into the [[Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park]], covering {{convert|666|km2|mi2}}. The northern end of the protected area remains as a strict nature reserve (Réserve Naturelle Intégrale) covering {{convert|853|km2|mi2}}. It is characterised by needle-shaped limestone formations, above cliffs over the [[Manambolo River]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=21 World Heritage Sites you have probably never heard of|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/10999939/21-World-Heritage-Sites-you-have-probably-never-heard-of.html|publisher=Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incredibly sharp limestone formations can cut through equipment and flesh easily, which makes traversing them extremely difficult. The word "Tsingy" is derived from a local word meaning "the place where one cannot walk barefoot".

==Tourism==
Tourists can access the national park by road from [[Morondava]], a town 150&amp;nbsp;km south of the park. Limited access is also possible from the town of [[Antsalova]], which can be reached by plane from [[Antananarivo]] or [[Mahajanga]].

'''Water resource policy''' encompasses the policy-making processes that affect the collection, preparation, use and disposal of water to support human uses and protect [[environmental quality]].

Water policy addresses provision, use, disposal and sustainability decisions. Provision includes identification, access, preparation for use and distribution. Uses include direct human consumption, agriculture, industry and ecosystem protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ecolex.org/ecolex/ledge/view/RecordDetails;document_Law%20on%20Water%20Resources%20Development%20(Law%20No.%2011%20of%201974)..html?DIDPFDSIjsessionid=7DA28E1500FB24F295BD6F41E7070924?id=LEX-FAOC001336&amp;index=documents|title= Law on Water Resources Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; Policy must set the rules for how water is allocated to the different uses. Disposal involves [[wastewater treatment]] and stormwater/flood management. Sustainability addresses issues such as aquifer depletion, reservoir management and mineral buildup.&lt;blockquote&gt;"Supply isn't just about water production, it is also about distribution infrastructure."&lt;ref name=Takadu/&gt;{{rp|9}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A second dimension of issues addresses how policies are created, executed and amended. Since water resources often cross political boundaries, water policies must often be negotiated among multiple political entities (nations, states, etc.) Commentators such as Halcrow project [[resource war]]s as demand continues to increase.&lt;ref name=Halcrow/&gt;{{rp|27}}

Policy makers typically adopt a set of best management practices BMPs to govern water management. BMPs cover everything from dam construction to wastewater treatment protocols.

Water resource policies may encompass &lt;blockquote&gt;"regions, catchments, shared or transboundary water resources, and inter-basin transfers. Policy leads management practices, but best management practices are identified, evaluated, modified and disseminated by policy making bodies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gwptoolbox.org/index.php?option=com_tool&amp;id=1|title= IWRM Toolbox}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Water resource policy issues are receiving increased attention&lt;ref name=Halcrow&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futurewecreate.com/includes/0614Global+Water+Security+PSC+19+Oct+rev1.pdf|title=Global Citizenship - Dow|website=www.futurewecreate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; as water shortages are believed to be at crisis levels in some regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.gwp.org/Global/The%20Challenge/Resource%20material/IWRM%20at%20a%20glance.pdf|title= Integrated Water Resources Management}}&lt;/ref&gt; These regional crises have the potential worldwide implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.voanews.com/content/fight-for-water-hits-crisis-levels-worldwide-118423974/136882.html|title= Fight for Water Hits Crisis Levels Worldwide}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnc-cc-eeaa-eg.com/Pics/dwnld396.pdf|title=GLOBAL WATER OUTLOOK TO 2025|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations such as the Global Water Policy Project have sprung up to promote awareness and prod governments and NGOs into heightened awareness of the problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.globalwaterpolicy.org|title= Global Water Policy Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WorldWaterAvailability.png|thumb|500px|right|World water availability]]

== Global water resource policy objectives ==

According to the World Water Assessment Programme, a UN-sanctioned Task Force, the objectives for global water resource policies include developing a standardized method for monitoring water sector progress and performance, improving reporting and identifying priority actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwater.org/downloads/TFIMR_FinalReport.pdf|title=Monitoring progress in the water sector: A selected set of indicators }}&lt;/ref&gt; In all nations conflict between users are expected to intensify, complicating policy-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/natres/water/2001/1001fpol.htm|title=Dehydrating Conflict|first=|last=Administrator|website=www.globalpolicy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Institutional participants ==

=== Multilateral ===
{{Main article|UN-Water}}

The 1977 Mar del Plata United Nations Conference on Water was the first intergovernmental water conference, leading to the 1980 Declaration of the International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade by the [[UN General Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.worldwatercouncil.org/index.php?id=92|title= Giving an audible voice to water}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Environmental Program]] hosts water resource policy-making agencies and disseminating BMPs worldwide. This role has been enhanced by various policy directives and other initiatives:

* UN General Assembly Resolution 3436 (XXX) Agenda 21
* 1997 Nairobi Declaration on the Role and Mandate of UNEP and
* 2000 Malmö Ministerial Declaration adopted at the First Global Ministerial Environment Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.unep.org/law/|title=  Division of Environmental Law and Conventions}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2002 Earth Summit 2015 safe drinking water targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/monitoring/globalassess/en/ |title=Global Water Supply and Sanitation Assessment 2000 Report |publisher=Who.int |date= |accessdate=2014-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2007 World Bank report series on Environment and Development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWAT/Resources/Env_Flows_Water_v1.pdf|title=World Bank-Series on Environment and Development|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that in 2009 reported on Environmental Flows in Water Resources Policies, Plans, and Projects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWAT/Resources/Env_Flows_Water_v1.pdf|title=Environmental Flows in Water Resources Policies, Plans, and Projects-World Bank-Series on Environment and Development|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bilateral ===

Treaties between nations may enumerate policies, rights and responsibilities. For instance, a treaty between Poland and Germany, "An Agreement to establish cooperation on water resources management" provides:

* supply of drinking water of good quality,
* protection of surface water,
* supply of water to agriculture,
* fight against water pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.ecolex.org/ecolex/ledge/view/RecordDetails;document_Agreement%20between%20the%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Germany%20and%20the%20Republic%20of%20Poland%20on%20cooperation%20on%20water%20resource%20management.html|title= Agreement between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Poland on cooperation on water resource management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Permanent Court of International Justice adjudicates disputes between nations, including water rights litigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecolex.org/server2.php/libcat/docs/TRE/Full/Other/TRE-151959.doc|title=Agreement between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Poland on cooperation on water resource management|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NGOs ===

Some non-governmental organizations have consultative status at the UN. One such group is the [[World Water Council]], an "international multi-stakeholder platform" established in 1996 to act "at all levels, including the highest decision-making level...[in] protection, development, planning, management and use of water in all its dimensions...for the benefit of all life on earth." It was an outgrowth of the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development in Dublin and at the Rio de Janeiro [[Earth Summit]]. The Council is based in Marseilles.&lt;ref name="WWC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwatercouncil.org/about-us/vision-mission-strategy/ |title=Vision, Mission, Strategy |publisher=World Water Council |date= |accessdate=2014-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its multi-stakeholder basis as due to the fact that "authority for managing the world's fresh water resources is fragmented amongst the world's nations, hundreds of thousands of local governments, and countless non-governmental and private organizations, as well as a large number of international bodies."

In 1994, the [[International Water Resources Association]] (IWRA) organized a special session on the topic in its Eighth World Water Congress held in Cairo in November 1994, leading to creation of the World Water Council.&lt;ref name="WWC"/&gt;

=== Business water resource policy initiatives ===

The [[World Business Council for Sustainable Development]] engages stakeholders in H2OScenarios&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbcsd.org/includes/getTarget.asp?type=d&amp;id=MTk5Nzc|title=H2OScenarios|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that consider various alternative policies and their effects.

In June 2011 in Geneva, the Future of Water Virtual Conference addressed water resource sustainability. Issues raised included: water infrastructure monitoring,&lt;ref name=Takadu&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futurewecreate.com/includes/0615Water_Price_Innovation_Scarcity_TaKaDu.pdf|title=Global Citizenship - Dow|website=www.futurewecreate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; global water security, potential resource wars, interaction between water, energy, food and economic activity, the "true value" of "distribution portions of available water" and a putative "investment gap" in water infrastructure.&lt;ref name=Halcrow/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.futurewecreate.com/|title= The Future of Science Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was asserted that climate change will affect scarcity of water but the water security presentation emphasized that a combined effect with population growth "could be devastating".&lt;ref name=Halcrow/&gt; Identified corporate water related risks include physical supply, regulatory and product reputation.&lt;ref name=Halcrow/&gt;{{rp|23}}

This forum indicated policy concerns with:

* trade barriers
* price supports
* treatment of water as a [[free good]] creates underpricing of 98% of water&lt;ref name=Halcrow/&gt;{{rp|2}}
* need to intensify debate
* need to harmonize public/private sectors&lt;ref name=Halcrow/&gt;{{rp|28}}

== Structural constraints on policy makers ==

Policies are implemented by organizational entities created by government exercise of state power. However, all such entities are subject to constraints upon their autonomy.&lt;ref name="Poulantzas1978"&gt;{{cite book|first=Nicos Ar |last=Poulantzas|title=Political Power and Social Classes|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=EI9LcAAACAAJ}}|year=1978|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-0-8052-7050-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jurisdictional issues ===

Subject matter and geographic jurisdiction are distinguishable.&lt;ref name="Black1999"&gt;{{cite book|first=Henry Campbell |last=Black|title=Black's Law Dictionary|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=wKcCngEACAAJ}}|year=1999|publisher=West Group|isbn=978-0-314-22864-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The jurisdiction of any water agency is limited by political boundaries and by enabling legislation.

In some cases, limits target specific types of uses (wilderness, agricultural, urban-residential, urban-commercial, etc.)

A second part of jurisdictional limitation governs the subject matter that the agency controls, such as flood control, water supply and sanitation, etc.

In many locations, agencies may face unclear or overlapping authority, increasing conflicts and delaying conflict resolution. For instance, recent changes in California law intended to reduce air quality problems from shipping have been interfered with by Federal legal changes intended to reduce the cost of shipping.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.santabarbaraindependent.com {{dead link|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Resources Agency Wetlands Information System
* State Water Resources Control Board&lt;ref name="swrcb"&gt;State Water Resources Control Board ''Water Quality Control Policy for the Enclosed Bays and Estuaries of California'' (1974) State of California&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hans Middendorp|title=Dr. Ir. Hans Middendorp Auteur Hans Middendorp - Nietbangvoorwater.info ®|url=https://nietbangvoorwater.info/|accessdate=23 May 2018|work=Niet bang voor water|language=nl-NL}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Public Health Departments 
* Water districts

==== Typical information access issue ====

As reported by the non-partisan [[Civil Society Institute]], a 2005 US Congressional study on water supply was suppressed and became the target of a [[Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) litigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilsocietyinstitute.org/media/062311release.cfm |title=Foia Lawsuit Targets U.S. Department Of Energy For Withholding 'Water Energy Roadmap' Ordered By Congress |publisher=Civilsocietyinstitute.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues ==

=== Flood control ===

Water can produce a natural disaster in the form of [[tsunami]]s, [[hurricane]]s, [[rogue wave]]s and [[storm surge]]. Land-based floods can originate from bursting dams, rivers overflowing their banks or levee failure.

==== Multi-jurisdictional issues ====

One jurisdiction's projects may cause problems in other jurisdictions. For instance, [[Monterey County, California]] controls a body of water that acts as a reservoir for [[San Luis Obispo County]]. The specific responsibilities for managing the resource must therefore be negotiated.

=== Freshwater ===

==== Surface and groundwater ====

Surface water and groundwater can be studied and managed as separate resources as a single resource in multiple forms.&lt;ref name="circ1139"&gt;United States Geological Survey (USGS). Denver, CO. [http://pubs.water.usgs.gov/circ1139/ "Ground Water and Surface Water: A Single Resource."] USGS Circular 1139. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Jurisdictions typically distinguish three recognized groundwater classifications: subterranean streams, underflow of surface waters, and percolating groundwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blm.gov/nstc/WaterLaws/california.html |accessdate=June 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615051911/http://www.blm.gov/nstc/WaterLaws/california.html |archivedate=June 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Constituencies ====

Drinking water and water for utilitarian uses such as washing, crop cultivation and manufacture is competed for by various constituencies:

* Residential
* Agriculture. "Many rural people practice subsistence rain fed agriculture as a basic livelihood strategy, and as such are vulnerable to the effects of drought or flood that can diminish or destroy a harvest. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=16th Conference on Climate Variability and Change |title=Evaluation of the Use of Forecast Interpretations information|first=Diego H. |last=Pedreros |location=[[University of California Santa Barbara]] |url=https://ams.confex.com/ams/Annual2005/techprogram/paper_87610.htm}} {{cite web |first1= A. |last1=Bonilla |first2=P. |last2=Ramirez |first3=C. |last3=Funk |first4=G. |last4=Husak |first5=J. |last6=Michaelsen |first7=L. |last7=Aguilar |title=Climate Predictions on Seasonal and Interannual Time Scales: |url=https://ams.confex.com/ams/Annual2005/techprogram/session_17755.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Construction
* Industrial
* Municipal or institutional activities

=== Seawater ===

[[Seawater]] resources are important for ethical-aesthetic reasons, recreation, tourism, maintenance of fisheries. The sea is a venue for shipping and for oil and mineral extraction that creates a need for regulatory policy. A variety of issues confronts policy makers.

==== Pollution ====

[[Ballast water]], fuel/oil leaks and trash originating from ships foul harbors, reefs and estuaries. Ballast water may contain toxins, invasive plants, animals, viruses, and bacteria.

Oil rigs and undersea mineral extraction can create problems that affect shorelines, marine life, fisheries and human safety. Decommissioning of such operations has another set of issues. [[Rigs-to-reefs]] is a proposal for using obsolete oil rigs as substrate for [[coral reef]]s that has failed to reach consensus.

=== Surface water (runoff) and wastewater discharge ===

Regulatory bodies address piped waste water discharges to surface water that include riparian and ocean ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/waterboards_map.shtml|title= State and Regional Water Boards}}&lt;/ref&gt; These review bodies are charged with protecting wilderness ecology, wildlife habitat, drinking water, agricultural irrigation and fisheries. Stormwater discharge can carry fertilizer residue and bacterial contamination from domestic and wild animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/ciwqs/who_is_regulated.shtml|title= Whom We Regulate}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have the authority to make orders which are binding upon private actors such as international corporations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.dailybreeze.com/news/ci_17612147|title= Water quality board orders Shell to clean soil at Carousel tract in Carson}}&lt;/ref&gt; and do not hesitate to exercise the police powers of the state.  Water agencies have statutory mandate which in many hurisdictions is resilient to pressure from constituents and lawmakers in which they on occasion stand their ground despite heated opposition from agricultural interests&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.montereyherald.com/local/ci_18314090?nclick_check=1|title=  California water rules rile farmers}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the Boards enjoy strong support from environmental concerns such as Greenpeace,Heal the Ocean and Channelkeepers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://www.facebook.com/notes/heal-the-ocean/hilary-spoke-to-regional-water-quality-control-board-today/10150089482817928|title=  Hilary Spoke To Regional Water Quality Control Board Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water quality issues or sanitation concerns reuse or water recycling and pollution control which in turn breaks out into stormwater and wastewater.

=== Stormwater runoff ===

Surface runoff is water that flows when heavy rains do not infiltrate soil; excess water from rain, meltwater, or other sources flowing over the land.  This is a major component of the water cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Horton, ''The Horton Papers'' (1933)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/hyp.5740 | title=Robert E. Horton's perceptual model of infiltration processes | journal=Hydrological Processes | date=2004 | volume=18 | issue=17 | pages=3447–3460 | first=Keith | last=Beven}}&lt;/ref&gt; Runoff that occurs on surfaces before reaching a [[Channel (geography)|channel]] is also called a [[Nonpoint source pollution|nonpoint source]]. When runoff flows along the ground, it can pick up [[Soil contamination|soil contaminants]] including, but not limited to petroleum, pesticides, or fertilizers that become [[discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] or nonpoint source pollution.&lt;ref name="DavisMasten2013"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Mackenzie |last1=Davis|first2=Susan |last2=Masten|title=Principles of Environmental Engineering Science: Third Edition|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=mXQgAAAAQBAJ}}|date=22 February 2013|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|isbn=978-0-07-749219-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/waterrights/water_issues/programs/instream_flows/docs/not_wdm070111.pdf |accessdate=June 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232426/http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/waterrights/water_issues/programs/instream_flows/docs/not_wdm070111.pdf |archivedate=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wastewater ===
{{Main article|Wastewater}}

Wastewater is water that has been discharged from human use. The primary discharges flow from the following sources:

* residences
* commercial properties
* industry
* agriculture

[[Sewage]] is technically wastewater contaminated with fecal and similar animal waste byproducts, but is frequently used as a synonym for wastewater. Origination includes [[cesspool]] and sewage outfall pipes.

Water treatment is subject to the same overlapping jurisdictional constraints which affect other aspects of water policy.&lt;ref name="Poulantzas1978"/&gt; For instance, levels of [[chloramine]]s with their resulting toxic [[trihalomethane]] by-product are subject to Federal guidelines even though water management implementing those policy constraints are carried out by local water boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccwa.com/chloramines.htm |accessdate=June 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125234751/http://www.ccwa.com/chloramines.htm |archivedate=January 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wildcoast''' (stylized ''WiLDCOAST'') is an international non-profit [[environmental organization]] that conserve coastal and marine ecosystem and wildlife.

Headquartered in [[Imperial Beach, California]], in 2007 Wildcoast established a Mexican division, '''Costasalvaje''' A.C. in [[Tijuana]] to manage its conservation programs in Latin America.

[[Charity Navigator]] awarded Wildcoast its four-star charity ranking.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}} The organization received the Excellence in Organizational Development Award from Nonprofit Management Solutions&lt;!--http://www.npsolutions.org/--&gt; in 2006.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}} It also received the San Diego Earthworks&lt;!--http://www.earthdayweb.org/--&gt; E.A.R.T.H. Award in 2007.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}} In 2008, Wildcoast received the Green Wave Award from the Surfer's Path Magazine&lt;!--http://www.surferspath.com/--&gt;.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}}

==Conservation programs==

===Wildlands conservation===
One of Wildcoast's primary missions is to preserve spectacular, undeveloped coastal areas throughout the peninsula of [[Baja California]] such as [[Bahía de los Ángeles]], [[Bahía Concepción]], [[Bahía Magdalena]], [[Laguna San Ignacio]] and the North Central Pacific Coast.  These are some of the most ecologically important coastal areas remaining on the planet and are teeming with wildlife including [[endangered species]] of [[sea turtles]], [[whales]] and [[migratory birds]].  Inhabited by people who make their living from [[fishing]], [[ranching]], and [[ecotourism]], these locations are threatened by [[megaresort]] construction, [[land speculation]], [[energy development]], and [[mining]] projects.

Working in partnership with local community-based organizations and landowners, Wildcoast provides support for land conservation projects such as [[easements]], [[Nature reserve|private reserves]], concessions, and [[sustainable development]] projects.  Many of Wildcoast conservation projects are carried out with members of [[ejido]]s, or communal agrarian cooperatives and private landowners to help them hold on to their ancestral land and receive financial incentives to protect the land from development. Wildcoast made history{{citation needed|date=September 2009}} by working with the Laguna San Ignacio Conservation Alliance in the brokering of a deal to protect the entire {{convert|140000|acre|km2|adj=on}} territory of the Ejido Luis Echeverria in San Ignacio Lagoon.  The legally binding deal is being praised{{citation needed|date=September 2009}} as a model for conserving both the environment and the local way of life.  San Ignacio is the world’s last undeveloped [[gray whale]] lagoon and a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].

Along the North Central Coast of Baja California Wildcoast has protected more than {{convert|14|mi|km}}{{citation needed|date=September 2009}} of coastline through conservation easements.  In addition, Wildcoast worked to halt a series of megaresort and [[marina]] projects slated for this region in Baja California that would have obliterated world-class coastal [[biodiversity]] sites.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}}

===Wildlife conservation===
The focus of the Wildlife Conservation Program is to protect endangered [[marine biology|marine species]] and their habitats.  In 2006, Wildcoast carried out a wildly successful{{citation needed|date=September 2009}} campaign "Defiende el Mar" (Defend the Sea) to support the creation of marine [[protected areas]] along the central coast of California and Mexico’s [[Gulf of California]]. The campaign took place at the [[2006 Soccer World Cup]] in Germany involving partnerships with Mexican soccer stars, [[Jorge Campos]] and [[Francisco Fonseca|"Kikin" Fonseca]], to promote marine protected areas.  The campaign resulted in the establishment of a {{convert|1200000|acre|km2|adj=on}} marine reserve in Bahía de los Ángeles in the Sea of Cortez and a network of marine reserves near the coast of [[Monterey]] and [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] in California.  Jorge Campos, one of the world’s greatest goalies, received the [[Monterey Bay Aquarium]]'s Environmental Hero award for his work with Wildcoast to defend the ocean.  From 2007-2008 the Wildcoast pro-MPA campaign featured Mexican wrestler [[El Hijo del Santo]] who has ardently campaigned for new marine reserves in California and marine conservation in Mexico.

The Wildcoast "Don’t Eat Sea Turtle" campaign, an ongoing effort to reduce the demand for [[sea turtle#Conservation|sea turtle]] eggs and meat throughout Mexico and Latin America received worldwide attention with its celebrity spokespeople, model [[Dorismar]], and musicians [[Maná]] and [[Los Tigres del Norte]].  The campaign featured public service announcements, posters, post cards, advertisements on bus stops, and a conference and press event in [[Acapulco]] – a center for the black market trade in sea turtle eggs.  [[Randy Olson]] of [[Shifting Baselines]] called the campaign the "best ocean campaign in [[human history]]".{{citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Wildcoast has launched a new initiative to protect [[shark#Conservation|sharks]].  This campaign resulted in the cessation of a shark massacre in the Mexican state of [[Guerrero]] after an American [[surfer]] was killed in a shark attack in May 2008.

Recently, Wildcoast has also focused on the establishment of [[Marine Protected Area]]s in California.  A science-based network of Marine Protected Areas is critical to ensure the survival of marine wildlife into the future as well as maintaining Southern California’s greatest resource.

===Coastal conservation===
Every year thousands of Californians are exposed to [[hazardous waste]], [[viruses]], and [[bacteria]] contained in the millions of gallons of [[wastewater|untreated water]] that flows daily into our ocean.  Recreational ocean users and people fishing along the US-Mexico border are those most affected.  The Coastal Conservation Program was developed to raise awareness of the public and environmental health risks associated with the pollution, to create a dialogue among stakeholders – residents, businesses, government agencies and to promote national media attention on a problem that threatens our communities and is often dismissed as an insurmountable problem.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Wildcoast proposes solutions to the pollution associated with increasing levels of urban and industrial development in the Californias.  In 2006, Wildcoast launched the "Clean Water Now!" campaign along the [[U.S.-Mexico border]] to reduce the exposure of children to toxic [[sewage]] and to reduce beach closures in the region.  As part of the campaign, they helped to pressure a contractor into cleaning up collector systems along the U.S.-Mexico border for renegade sewage flows.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}}

In the ongoing effort to promote community involvement in clean water solutions along the US-Mexico Border, Wildcoast held three community forums for residents to discuss the issues and solicit involvement.  More than 100 people attended the forums and pledge support for the campaign.  In addition, Wildcoast sponsored the 2nd Annual Kids for Clean Water Surf Contest and the 4th Annual [[Allen Holder|Dempsey Holder]] Memorial Expression Session and Ocean Festival.  More than 600 people from all walks of life gathered to learn more about ocean pollution and ways to clean it up.  In 2008, Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] with the support of the [[White House]] appropriated more than $66 million to upgrade the [[sewage treatment]] facility along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Wildcoast is a member of the Save San Onofre&lt;!--http://www.savesanonofre.com--&gt; coalition to halt the development of a [[San Onofre State Beach#Threatened Toll Road Through Park|toll road]] that would seriously impact the fabled [[Trestles]] [[surf break]] and [[San Onofre State Park]] in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], California.  The campaign included a trip to [[Sacramento]] to ask that legislators stop the toll road project as well as participation in the massive "Big Wednesday" protest at the [[Del Mar Fairgrounds]] against the Toll Road in February 2008.

==Media==
Wildcoast is noted{{citation needed|date=September 2009}} for its ability to work with the media in English and Spanish to bring attention to pressing coastal and marine conservation issues of global concern. [[The New York Times]], [[The Wall Street Journal]], [[Associated Press]], [[BBC News]], [[National Public Radio]], [[NBC Nightly News]], [[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]], [[CBS News]], [[Good Magazine]], and [[Newsweek]] have reported on the work of Wildcoast.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}} In addition, the organization is a frequent guest on television networks [[Televisa]], [[TV Azteca]], [[Azteca America]], [[Univision]], and [[Telemundo]] to promote ocean conservation.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}}

==Popular culture==
Wildcoast worked with the cast and crew of the [[HBO]] series [[John from Cincinnati]] while filming took place in Imperial Beach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wildcoast.net/site/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=326&amp;Itemid=132 Wildcoast on HBO'S New Series: John from Cincinnati]&lt;/ref&gt; Wildcoast's "Clean Water Now" signs are displayed prominently in the Yost surf shop and Wildcoast T-shirts, staff members and events also make appearances. The opening credits feature Wildcoast "eco-[[lucha libre]]" stars in the ring.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrWZlh7DnBE YouTube - John From Cincinnati Opening Credits]&lt;/ref&gt;
