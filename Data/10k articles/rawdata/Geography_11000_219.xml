'''916 America''' is a [[minor planet]] orbiting the [[Sun]] in the [[main belt]] between [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]].

It was discovered on 7 August 1915 by the [[Russia]]n astronomer [[Grigory Nikolaevich Neujmin]] at [[Simeis]], [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref name="ssd_jpl" /&gt; Originally designated '''916&lt;sup&gt;Σ&lt;/sup&gt;I''', it was renamed '916 America' on 24 February 1923 after the Council of Astronomers at [[Pulkovo Observatory]] decided to commemorate "the friendly relations of the astronomical observatories and astronomers".&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1923PA.....31S.364. Asteroid (916) America] (1923). ''[[Popular Astronomy (US magazine)|Popular Astronomy]]'', volume 31, page 364.&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible reason for the name was as a mark of appreciation for the help given during the 1921 Russian famine by the [[American Relief Administration]] under the later President [[Herbert Hoover]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Dictionary of Minor Planet Names | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KWrB1jPCa8AC&amp;pg=RA1-PA82&amp;lpg=RA1-PA82&amp;dq=%22916+america%22 | first=Lutz D. | last= Schmadel | year=2003 | publisher=Springer | isbn=3-540-00238-3 | page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, assuming that the asteroid was of S-type and that it had a diameter of 15&amp;nbsp;km, the rotational period was measured to be 38 hours.&lt;ref name="1986_Dimartino"&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode=1986acm..proc...81D | title=A Photoelectric Program for Small and Unusual Asteroids | last=Dimartino | first=M. | journal=Asteroids, comets, meteors II; Proceedings of the International Meeting, Uppsala, Sweden, June 3–6, 1985. Uppsala, Sweden, Astronomiska Observatoriet | year=1986 | pages=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observations by the [[IRAS|Infrared Astronomical Satellite]] have since shown that it has a diameter of 33.2±1.3&amp;nbsp;km, with an [[absolute magnitude]] of 11.20 and an [[albedo]] of 0.053±0.004.&lt;ref name="ssd_jpl" /&gt;

'''Airai''', located on the southern coast of [[Babeldaob]] island, is the second-most populous [[States of Palau|state]] of [[Palau]]. It contains the country's chief airport, [[Roman Tmetuchl International Airport]], and is connected by the [[Koror-Babeldaob Bridge]] to nearby [[Koror Island]].

The state has an area of 44&amp;nbsp;km² (17&amp;nbsp;mi²), and a total population of 2700 {{as of|2004|lc=on}}, the second largest in the country.  Airai is also the name of the biggest town in the state, with a population of 920 people {{As of|2005|lc=y}}.  The town of Airai is the largest town in Palau outside of the state of [[Koror]].

Airai is most notable for its ''bai'' (men's meeting house), the oldest one in existence, dating back 200 years.  The turbulent rains of Palau did not treat ancient Palauan architecture kindly.  Airai is more inland/mountainous-jungle and therefore more of a [[bedroom community]]{{Clarify|date=June 2009}} of Koror.

== Education==
The [[Ministry of Education (Palau)|Ministry of Education]] operates public schools.

Airai Elementary School opened circa September 1945. It initially used the former Japanese Communications building.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.palaumoe.net/airai/ Airai Elementary School]." [[Ministry of Education (Palau)]]. Retrieved on February 22, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Atlas der Neederlanden''', or ''Atlas of the Netherlands'', is a composite [[atlas]] which was presumably collected and composed by the [[publishing]] company Covens and Mortier in [[Amsterdam]]. The maps are gathered in nine volumes and show how the [[Low Countries]], including [[Belgium]] and the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|former colonies of the Netherlands]], have developed over the course of about two decades. The atlas contains more than 600 [[Printing|printed]] and [[manuscript]] [[Map|maps]] and is preserved by the Special Collections of the [[University of Amsterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lib.uva.nl/UVA:uva_lms:UVA_LMS001113548 ''Atlas der Neederlanden'' in the Catalogue Library of the University of Amsterdam.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composite atlas==
[[File:Map - Special Collections University of Amsterdam - Frontispice Atlas der Neederlanden IV.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece from the publishing company Covens and Mortier.]]
The ''Atlas der Neederlanden'' is an ''atlas factice'', also known as ''composite atlas''. These atlases were composed by wealthy people who collected maps concerning a specific region or topic. In some cases rich buyers contracted the publisher to collect the maps for them. These maps were then bound together in one or more volumes by a book binder in the typical “atlas-[[Bookbinding|binding]]”. Each composite atlas contains a different collection of maps and is therefore unique in its composition. There are different composite atlases preserved, for example the ''Atlas Blaeu-Van der Hem'' in the [[Austrian National Library]] in [[Vienna]] and the ''Atlas Van der Hagen'', which was made earlier than the ''Atlas der Neederlanden'', around 1690, and has been in the possession of the [[National Library of the Netherlands]] since 1887.
 
==History==
[[File:Map - Special Collections University of Amsterdam - OTM- HB-KZL I 2 A 1 (53).jpg|thumb|Map of [[Drenthe]] (1743).]]
Who the collector of the ''Atlas der Neederlanden'' was or for whom it was made remains unclear. At some point in the [[19th century]] the book found its way to the [[University of Amsterdam]] where it is now part of the Special Collections of its [[Amsterdam University Library|University Library]]. It is assumed that the atlas was composed by Covens and Mortier. The publisher is mentioned at the [[Book frontispiece|frontispieces]] of eight of the nine volumes with the following text: ''Table des cartes etc: de I. Cóvens et C. Mortier contenues dans ce volume''. Also, most of the maps in the atlas were published by Covens and Mortier.

When the last volume of the atlas was finished around 1816, the publishing house was led by Cornelis Covens (1764-1825). He worked for his family’s firm from 1790 until 1825, bringing it innovation and success. Covens and Mortier published many new maps but also kept the old stock, which ensured that the firm had a large fund of maps. Within the field of commercial and government cartography Covens and Mortier became the leading publishing company at the beginning of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Marco van Egmond, ''Covens &amp; Mortier: a map publishing house in Amsterdam, 1685-1866'' (Houten 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1816 the last volume of the atlas was finished. The largest part of the map collection dates from the [[18th century]]. A few maps originate from the [[17th century]], like the [[Leo Belgicus]] dating from 1611 and a map of the Netherlands created by [[Frederik de Wit]] in 1670. Most of the 18th century maps are collected in volumes 1-8. Volume 9 contains maps from the 17th century and a few maps dating from the beginning of the 19th century. This volume doesn’t have a frontispiece of the publisher. The most recent maps in the atlas are to be found in volume 9 and date from 1816.

The ''Atlas der Neederlanden'' contains maps of large sizes. Most atlases from the 17th and 18th century don’t have large maps because these didn’t fit in the bound volumes. The ''Atlas der Neederlanden'' forms an exception. The large-scale maps were folded to fit in the atlas and several wall maps of 4, 12 and 25 sheets were bound separately. The multi-sheet wall maps were popular decorations and therefore rarely preserved well. Because the separate sheets were bound and kept in the atlas, they remained in good condition with their lively colours still preserved.

The atlas has nine volumes. Each volume is about a different part of the [[Netherlands]]:
* Volume I: Gelderlandt, Utrecht &amp; Over Yssel ([[Gelderland]], [[Utrecht]] and [[Overijssel]])
* Volume II: Holland 1. Zuid-Holland ([[South Holland]])
* Volume III: Holland 2. Zuid-Holland ([[South Holland]])
* Volume IV: Holland 3. Zuid-Holland ([[South Holland]])
* Volume V: Holland 4. Noord-Holland ([[North Holland]])
* Volume VI: Zeeland ([[Zeeland]])
* Volume VII: Vriesland, Groningen &amp; Drenthe ([[Friesland]], [[Groningen]] and [[Drenthe]])
* Volume VIII: Belgiën ([[Belgium]]) 
* Volume IX: Algemeene kaarten &amp; Coloniën (General maps and [[colonies]])

==Restoration==
In 2011 the atlas was restored and digitized. A [[facsimile]] edition has been made of the nine volumes. This facsimile was presented at the celebration of the 200 year commemoration of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Kingdom of the Netherlands]] in 2013. The facsimile was published together with the book ''De Atlas der Neederlanden: Kaarten van de Republiek en het prille Koninkrijk met 'Belgiën' en 'Coloniën’''.&lt;ref&gt; Jan Werner, ''De Atlas der Neederlanden: Kaarten van de Republiek en het prille Koninkrijk met 'Belgiën' en 'Coloniën’'' (Amsterdam 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The dark layer of clouds on the horizon seen prior to a tropical cyclone's passage over a location was first described in 1687 and the observed phenomenon later published in 1697 by [[William Dampier]] while observing a typhoon in the [[South China Sea]] during a [[circumnavigation]] by [[pirate]] ship. These observations led to an improved understanding of the nature of tropical cyclones. The use of "bar" as a term to describe this cloud layer first appeared in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="HurEnc"/&gt;

==Inside the bar==
[[File:Hurricane structure graphic.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The basic vertical structure of a mature tropical cyclone. The bar appears as the storm's main disk of initially the upper storm clouds followed by the lower clouds as viewed from a distance, and gaps exist in the rainbands after the bar passes over.]]

When the bar of the storm approaches an observer, it appears stationary in [[azimuth]]al position, whereas a storm moving toward the observer at an angle or perpendicular to the observer will appear to drift along the horizon.&lt;ref name="IRBS"/&gt; A reddish tint sometimes appears toward the top of the bar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheets|first=Bob|title=Hurricane watch: Forecasting the deadliest storms on earth|year=2001|publisher=[[Random House]]|isbn=0-375-70390-X|author2=Jack Williams|page=12|chapter=Early History and Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the darkness often varies depending on the storm's intensity. Tints of indigo, green, yellow or violet may also be present depending on the time of day due to the [[Prism (optics)|prism]]atic effect of water droplets in the cloud. Cumulus clouds first appear at the [[outflow (meteorology)|outflow]] [[outflow boundary|boundary]] of the lower part of the bar.&lt;ref name="HurEnc"/&gt; As the bar passes overhead, [[barometric pressure]] at the observer's location falls steadily. The first [[rainband]] arrives, the clouds moving from left to right roughly along [[isobar (meteorology)|isobar]] lines, but this is often followed by short periods of relative calm. During the onset of the bar's arrival, winds continuously increase in intensity leading toward the [[eyewall]]. Navigators of ships at sea often use the first appearance of a bar to steer clear of the approaching tropical cyclone.&lt;ref name="IRBS"/&gt;

Closer to the center of tropical cyclone, the eyewall also exhibits the appearance of a bar, and high [[lightning]] activity occurs within this central bar. After the bar passes through, the strongest winds and often the heaviest precipitation abruptly changes to calmer conditions within the [[eye (cyclone)|eye]], before the eyewall passes over again and the strongest winds arrive from the opposite direction.&lt;ref name="HurEnc"/&gt;

At sea, wind speeds typically reach level 8 on the [[Beaufort scale]] while [[ocean wave|wave]]s become drastically higher when the bar reaches overhead and [[squall line]]s begin to arrive.&lt;ref name="IRBS"/&gt;

[[File:Backa.png|thumb|right|300px|Map of the Bačka region]]
'''Bačka''' ({{lang-sr|Бачка}} / ''Bačka'', {{IPA-sh|bâːt͡ʃkaː|pron}}; {{lang-hu|Bácska}}, {{IPA-hu|ˈbaːt͡ʃkɒ|pron}}) is a geographical and [[Historical regions of Central Europe|historical area]] within the [[Pannonian Plain]] bordered by the river [[Danube]] to the west and south, and by the river [[Tisza]] to the east. It is divided between [[Serbia]] and [[Hungary]]. Most of the area is located within the [[Vojvodina]] region in Serbia and [[Novi Sad]], the capital of Vojvodina, lies on the border between Bačka and [[Syrmia]].  The smaller northern part of the geographical area is located within [[Bács-Kiskun]] County, in Hungary.

==Name==
The name of the region in Serbian is ''Bačka'' or Бачка and in Hungarian is ''Bácska''. In other languages of the region, the name is similar: ''Bačka'' in [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Bunjevac language|Bunjevac]], ''Báčka'' in [[Slovak language|Slovak]], Бачка ''(Bačka)'' in [[Pannonian Rusyn language|Rusyn]], and ''Batschka'' in [[German language|German]].

According to Serbian historians, Bačka is a typical Slavic&lt;ref&gt;Dr Dušan J. Popović, Srbi u Vojvodini, knjiga 1, Novi Sad, 1990, page 40.&lt;/ref&gt; name form, created from "Bač" (name of historical town in Bačka) and suffix "ka" (which designates "the land that belongs to Bač"). There are many other similar name forms used in Serbian and other Slavic languages{{original research inline|date=June 2013}}, for example [[Šajkaška]], [[Republika Srpska|Srpska]], [[Croatia|Hrvatska]] (Croatia), [[Timočka Krajina]], [[Bulgaria|Bugarska]] (Bulgaria), [[Poland|Polska]] (Poland), etc.

The name of "[[Bač, Serbia|Bač]]" (Bács) town itself is of uncertain origin and its existence was recorded among [[Vlachs]], [[Slavs]] and [[Hungarians]] in the Middle Ages. The origin of the name could be [[Paleo-Balkan languages|Paleo-Balkanic]],&lt;ref&gt;Milica Grković, Rečnik imena Banjskog, Dečanskog i Prizrenskog vlastelinstva u XIV veku, Beograd, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; [[Romanian language|Romanian]]{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}, [[Slavic languages|Slavic]],&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Aleksa Ivić, Istorija Srba u Vojvodini, Novi Sad, 1929&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Turkic languages|Old Turkic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pallaslexikon.hu/pallas/lpext.dll?f=templates&amp;fn=default.htm A Pallas Nagy Lexikona] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911162541/http://www.pallaslexikon.hu/pallas/lpext.dll?f=templates&amp;fn=default.htm |date=11 September 2006 }}, pallaslexikon.hu; accessed 20 August 2016.{{hu icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hungarian historians, the denominator of the landscape may have been the first bailiff of Bač (Bács) castle, and the name one which can be rendered probable it Old Turkic ''baya'' derives from a dignity name.&lt;ref&gt;Lajos Kiss, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=0vlUTdC7MIm7hAfGspD7DA&amp;ct=result&amp;sqi=2&amp;id=vN-wAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22B%C3%A1cs%22+Baya%22&amp;q=%22baya%22#search_anchor Földrajzi nevek etimológiai szótára (Etimology Dictionary of Geographical Names)], Akadémiai Kiadó, 1978, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bálint Ila, József Kovacsics, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=P_1UTZ3JKIeqhAf40rCHDQ&amp;ct=result&amp;id=vu7SAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=B%C3%A1cs+baya&amp;q=baya#search_anchor Veszprém megye helytörténeti lexikona  (Cyclopaedia of Local History of Veszprém county), Volume 2], Volume 2, Akadémiai Kiadó, 1988, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th and 18th century, due to the large number of [[Serbs]] who lived in Bačka, this region was called »Raczorszag« (Hungarian name, which means "the Serb country" in English).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&amp;hl=sr&amp;biw=1015&amp;bih=607&amp;noj=1&amp;tbm=bks&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=%22U+XVII+i+XVIII+veku+u+Ba%C4%8Dkoj+je+ve%C4%87+toliko+Srba+da+putnici+ovaj+kraj+nazivaju%22&amp;oq=%22U+XVII+i+XVIII+veku+u+Ba%C4%8Dkoj+je+ve%C4%87+toliko+Srba+da+putnici+ovaj+kraj+nazivaju%22&amp;gs_l=serp.3...13127.15591.1.15964.13.9.0.0.0.0.214.848.0j5j1.6.0....0...1c.1.48.serp..13.0.0.vnD025J17Gc "U XVII i XVIII veku u Bačkoj je već toliko Srba da putnici ovaj kraj nazivaju »Raczorszag«"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/#hu/en/orsz%C3%A1g]&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, the Hungarians used name [[Délvidék]] ("the southern or lower country") for a wider imprecisely defined geographical area, which, according to 19th century view also included Bačka. However, according to other Hungarian sources, Bačka was rather seen as part of [[Alföld]].&lt;ref&gt;Bojan Aleksov, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_Prpwej2UiYC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=%22delvidek%22+vajdasag&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=y3K1U9qfAYOEOMrqgOAJ&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22delvidek%22%20vajdasag&amp;f=false Religious Dissent Between the Modern and the National: Nazarenes in Hungary and Serbia 1850-1914], Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 2006, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Through history, Bačka has been a part of [[Dacia]], the Kingdom of the [[Iazyges]], the [[Huns#European Huns|Hun Empire]], the [[Gepids|Gepid Kingdom]], the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avar Khanate]], the [[First Bulgarian Empire]], the [[Great Moravia]], the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], the Serb realm of [[Jovan Nenad]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], the [[Austrian Empire]], [[Austria-Hungary]], the [[Kingdom of Serbia]], the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], [[Serbia and Montenegro]], and since 2006, it has been part of an independent [[Republic of Serbia]]. The smaller northern part of the region was part of the short-lived Serb-Hungarian [[Baranya-Baja Republic]] (in 1921) and part of independent Hungary since 1921.

People have inhabited the region of Bačka since [[Neolithic]] times. [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] peoples settled in this region in three migration waves dated in 4200 BC, 3300 BC, and 2800 BC respectively. The earliest historical inhabitants of the region were probably [[Illyria]]n tribes. Later, other Indo-European peoples, including [[Dacians]], [[Celts]], [[Sarmatians]] ([[Iazyges]]) and [[Gepids]] were recorded as inhabitants of Bačka.

In the 9th century the territory of Bačka was part of [[Bulgarian Empire]]. [[Salan]], a [[Bulgaria]]n voivod (duke), was a ruler in this territory and his capital city was [[Titel]]. In the early 10th century, Hungarians defeated Salan, and his duchy came under Hungarian rule.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

[[File:Bač, view of the fortress and the town.jpg|thumb|left|300px|View of the fortress and the town of Bač]]
In the 11th century, during the administration of the medieval [[Kingdom of Hungary]], [[Bács-Bodrog|Bacsensis]] (Bács, Bač) County was formed, with city of [[Bač, Serbia|Bache]] (Bács, Bač) as its administrative centre. According to Serbian sources, Ilija Vid, the first known prefect of Bacsensis County was recorded in 1068 and he was an ethnic Serb.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HT0AAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=%22%C5%BEupan+ba%C4%8Dke%22+vid&amp;hl=sr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dcXCUe7RH-jx4QSvo4DACA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22%D0%A1%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%BD%20%D1%98%D0%B5%20%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%BE%20%D0%B8%20%D1%88%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%20%D0%BF%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BD%20%D0%98%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B0%20%D0%92%D0%B8%D0%B4%2C%20%D0%B6%D1%83%D0%BF%D0%B0%D0%BD%20%D0%B1%D0%B0%D1%87%D0%BA%D0%B5%20%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%9B%D0%B5%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; In this time, the region was populated by both, [[Slavs]] and [[Hungarians]]. Serbian historian Dr. Milenko Palić also mentions that prefect Vid was an ethnic Serb and that he, together with two other ethnic Serbs whose names were Ilija and Radovan, participated in dynastic struggles in the Kingdom of Hungary, in the end of the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Milenko Palić, Srbi u Mađarskoj - Ugarskoj do 1918, Novi Sad, 1995, page 10.&lt;/ref&gt; {{verification needed|date=June 2013}} According to Hungarian authors, prefect Vid belonged to the [[Gutkeled]] genus,&lt;ref&gt;Lajos Horváth, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y96RAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=gutkeled+Vid+1074&amp;dq=gutkeled+Vid+1074&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vMrCUdf1PIWPOM6dgOgF&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ Turul Es Kereszt: Kozerdeku Torteneti Irasok], Szenci Molnár Társaság, 1996, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Dankó'&gt;Imre Dankó, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=y8vCUbL1DMXFPI2MgcAI&amp;id=RehnAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=gutkeled+Vid&amp;q=Vid+gut#search_anchor Opuscula ethnographica: válogatott tanulmányok], Alföldi Ny, 1977, pp. 173-76&lt;/ref&gt; but there is a possibility that he was a fictitious person.&lt;ref name='Dankó'/&gt;

After the Kingdom of Hungary was defeated by the Ottoman Empire (in 1526), Bačka became (from 1526-27) the central region of an independent Serbian state,&lt;ref&gt;Veselin P. Dželetović, Poslednji srpski car - Jovan Nenad, Beograd, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; which existed in the territory of present-day [[Vojvodina]]. The ruler of this state was [[Emperor Jovan Nenad]] and his capital city was [[Subotica]]. After Jovan Nenad was killed, his state collapsed and Bačka, for a short time, came again under Hungarian administration. Soon, the region became part of the Ottoman Empire.

During the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule (in the 16th-17th centuries), Bačka was part of the [[Sanjak]] of [[Szeged|Segedin]] (Szeged), and the region was mainly populated with [[Serbs]] (who were in an absolute majority&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-zZ_NVM9mNEC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=hungarians+vojvodina+1880&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pdezU5YQTv&amp;sig=eYjZSy7X8g7ST9AoR-uFSXuKTYM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=sDVUTZKANJKV4gaH0qHrCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Serbs%20in%20an%20absolute%20majority%20in%20the%20province%2C%20as%20in%20the%20days%20of%20the%20Ottoman-Turkish%20occupation&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;) and Muslims. In 1699, the Bačka became a possession of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. A [[Bács-Bodrog|Bacsensis County]] was established in the western parts of the region, while some other (mostly eastern) parts of the Bačka were incorporated into the [[Tisza|Tisa]]-[[Mureş River|Mureş]] section of Habsburg [[Military Frontier]]. After this part of the Military Frontier was abolished in 1751, these parts of Bačka were also included into Bacsensis county. The only part of Bačka which remained within the Military Frontier was [[Šajkaška]], but it also came under civil administration in 1873.

According to the Austrian censuses from 1715–20, [[Serbs]], [[Bunjevci]], and [[Šokci]] comprised most of the region's population (97.6% of population according to 1715-1720 census data&lt;ref name="hic.hr"&gt;http://hic.hr/books/seeurope/011e-bognar.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-zZ_NVM9mNEC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=hungarians+banat+1790&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pdeAS-WN_D&amp;sig=rLHnkM76FKxmfKuAfOxVF84IVX4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=o3dfTfrEFYHoOY79xfgN&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBg#v=snippet&amp;q=97.6%20%25&amp;f=false Ethnic Geography of the Hungarian Minorities in the Carpathian Basin - By Károly Kocsis, Eszter Kocsisné Hodosi]&lt;/ref&gt;). There were only 530 or 1.9% Hungarians and 0.5% Germans.&lt;ref name="hic.hr"/&gt; During the 18th century, the Habsburgs carried out an intensive colonisation of the area, which had low population density after the last [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman Wars]], as much of the Serbian population had been decimated through warfare. Muslim population had almost entirely left or was expelled from the region and some of the Muslim refugees from this area settled in Ottoman Bosnia.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; The new settlers in Bačka were primarily [[Serbs]] who moved from Ottoman Balkans, [[Magyars|Hungarians]], and [[Ethnic German|Germans]]. Because many of the Germans came from [[Swabia]], they were known as ''Donauschwaben'', or [[Danube Swabians]]. Some Germans also came from Austria, and some from [[Bavaria]] and [[Alsace]]. [[Lutheran]] [[Slovaks]], [[Pannonian Rusyns|Rusyns]], and others were also colonized but to a much smaller extent.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

There was also an emigration of Serbs from the eastern parts of the region, which belonged to Military Frontier until 1751. After the abolition of the Tisa-Mureş section of Military Frontier, many Serbs emigrated from north-eastern parts of Bačka. They moved either to [[Russia]] (notably to [[New Serbia (historical province)|New Serbia]] and [[Slavo-Serbia]]) or to [[Banat]], where the Military Frontier was still needed.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In 1848 and 1849, Bačka was part of the [[Serbian Vojvodina|Serbian Voivodship]], a Serbian autonomous region within [[Austrian Empire]], while between 1849 and 1860 it was part of the [[Voivodship of Serbia and Tamiš Banat]], a separate Austrian [[crown land]] (the official languages of the voivodship were [[German language|German]] and Illyrian, i.e. Serbo-Croatian), the successor of the Serbian Voivodship. After 1860, when Voivodship of Serbia and Tamiš Banat was abolished, the [[Bács-Bodrog]] County was again formed in the territory of Bačka. The county was part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], which became one of two autonomous parts of Austria-Hungary in 1867.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} 
According to the 1910 census, the population of Bačka numbered 704,563 people and was composed of: 43.2% speakers of [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] (310,490), 28.1% speakers of [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] ([[Serbo-Croatian]]) language and 22.5% speakers of [[German language|German]]. Linguistic composition of the region is partially different from ethnic composition since some ethnic Jews and bilingual South Slavs were in this census recorded as speakers of Hungarian language.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In early September 1914, several years before the end of the [[Habsburg Empire]], in a town in the West Vojvodina Bačka region known as [[Hungarian language|Zombor]] or [[Sombor]] of some 30,000 people, including 12,000 Serb-speakers, popular demonstrations demanded the removal of all shop signs in the Cyrillic alphabet. When an angry mob chased one Serb-speaking shopkeeper to his home for refusing to remove his Cyrillic sign, he responded by shooting at the demonstrators. The local military commander demanded the shopkeeper's immediate extradition, court martialed him and executed him on the spot. The court martial also designated twelve more affluent hostages from among the Serb-speaking population who would be "arrested and immediately executed by the military authorities" in the case of any obstruction or opposition shown by the local [Serb-speaking] population to the military authorities." This would presage the Serb genocide committed in the [[Independent State of Croatia]] during most of the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Judson|Judson, Peter M.]] ''The Habsburg Empire: A New History'' (p. 398), Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass./London, England.

At the end of October 1918, Austria-Hungary gradually dissolved and, with the [[Armistice of Villa Giusti]] of 3 November, officially capitulated to the [[Triple Entente]]. Following this capitulation, Slavs from [[Banat, Bačka and Baranja]] organized a new civil administration in these regions as well as their own military units known as People's Guard (Serbian: ''Narodna straža'').  The new civil administration was composed of local People's Boards (Serbian: ''Narodni odbori''), which were subordinated to Serb People's Board (Serbian: ''Srpski narodni odbor'') in [[Novi Sad]]. Military units of Serb People's Board also possessed aircraft from the Novi Sad Airport. After elections, which were organized between 18 and 24 November, Great People's Assembly of Serbs, Bunjevci and other Slavs of Banat, Bačka and Baranja (held on 25 November 1918) proclaimed unification of these regions with the [[Kingdom of Serbia]]. New administrative bodies of Banat, Bačka and Baranja (government and parliament) were also formed. Although, government in Belgrade accepted decision of unification with Serbia, it never recognized new provincial government. The provincial administration, however, was active until 12 March 1919, when it held its last session.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Drago Njegovan, Prisajedinjenje Vojvodine Srbiji, Muzej Vojvodine, Novi Sad, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 December 1918, the Kingdom of Serbia united with the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs to form new country named the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]]. Sovereignty of new kingdom was internationally recognized by the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint Germain]] in 1919. The [[Treaty of Trianon]] of 4 June 1920 defined the exact borders between the newly independent [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (which was later renamed the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]) and original territory of Bačka was divided between these two countries. The northern part of the region was a separate county of Hungary (Bács-Bodrog) with seat in Baja, which was later incorporated into [[Bács-Kiskun]] county. The southern part of the region was within the District of Novi Sad of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes between 1918 and 1922, then was divided between [[Bačka Oblast]] and [[Belgrade Oblast]], [[Subdivisions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia#Oblasts (1922–1929)|provinces ''(oblasts)'']] of the kingdom, between 1922 and 1929. In 1929, it was incorporated into [[Danube Banovina]], which was a province of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Between 1820 and 1910, Hungarian speaking population in Bačka increased from 121,688 (31.5%) to 363,518 (44.75%). In the same time, percentage of South Slavs decreased from 44% in 1820 to 27% in 1910. 1921 census showed about 40,000 Hungarian speakers less than in census of 1910. This was especially case in Subotica where 1910 census recorded 55.587 speakers of Hungarian and 33,247 speakers of [[Bunjevac dialect|Bunjevac]], while census of 1921 recorded 60,700 speakers of Serbo-Croatian and 26,750 speakers of Hungarian. This is explained by the fact that ethnic Bunjevci from Subotica who had knowledge of Hungarian language were listed as speakers of Hungarian by 1910 census. Between 1921 and 1931 census, number of Hungarian speakers in Bačka increased from 260,998 to 268,711. Slavic population increased by 91,800 inhabitants.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In 1941, Yugoslav Bačka was occupied by the [[Axis powers]] and attached to [[Miklós Horthy|Horthy's]] [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]] (but was still internationally recognized as part of Yugoslavia). Before this occupation, according to 1931 census, Yugoslav Bačka had 784,896 inhabitants, of whom there were 284,865 Yugoslavs (Serbs, Croats, Bunjevci, Šokci), 268,711 Hungarians and 169,858 Germans. Hungarian occupation authorities expelled several thousands of Serbs from the region and settled ethnic Hungarians from other parts of Central Europe in their place, so that the Hungarian census of 1941 recorded different a demographic composition in the region. According to this census, the territory of Bačka had 789,705 inhabitants, of which 45.4% or{{clarify|date=December 2012}} 47.2% were speakers of Hungarian language (not all of them native, however).&lt;ref&gt;Károly Kocsis, Eszter Kocsisné Hodosi, Ethnic Geography of the Hungarian Minorities in the Carpathian Basin, Simon Publications LLC, 1998, p. 116-153 [https://books.google.com/books?id=-zZ_NVM9mNEC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=Northern+transylvania++hungarians+romanians+number&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FQkfTdjRKdKZhQeQ4Zi3Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; During the occupation, [[Occupation of Vojvodina, 1941-1944|Hungarian troops killed]] about 20,000 Serbs, Jews and Roma.&lt;ref name="Dimitrije Boarov 2001, page 183"&gt;Dimitrije Boarov, Politička istorija Vojvodine, Novi Sad, 2001, page 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

The occupation ended in 1944 and Yugoslav Bačka became part of the new [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Democratic Federal Yugoslavia]] (later the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia). Following the defeat of the Axis troops, most of the German population that lived in the area left the region together with German army. The smaller part of the German population (several thousands of people) that did not leave the area (mostly women, children and the elderly) were sent to prison camps, where many of them died of malnutrition and disease. After the war, members of the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Yugoslav Partisan army]] also [[1944-1945 killings in Vojvodina|killed several tens of thousands of inhabitants]] of German, Hungarian and Serb ethnic origin (in whole of Vojvodina). Estimates about numbers of victims of the Partisans (in whole of Vojvodina) are between 17,000&lt;ref name="mail-archive.com"&gt;http://www.mail-archive.com/sim@antic.org/msg44296.html&lt;/ref&gt; and 56,000&lt;ref&gt;Nenad Stefanović, Jedan Svet na Dunavu, Beograd, 2003, page 133.&lt;/ref&gt; killed Germans, between 4,000&lt;ref name="Dimitrije Boarov 2001, page 183"/&gt; and 40,000 Hungarians killed, and about 23,000-24,000 Serbs killed.&lt;ref name="mail-archive.com"/&gt;

Together with eastern [[Syrmia]], western [[Banat]], and northern [[Mačva]], Yugoslav Bačka has been part of the Autonomous Province of [[Vojvodina]] since 1945. After 1992, Yugoslav Bačka was part of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (renamed [[Serbia and Montenegro]] in 2003), and since 2006 it has been part of the independent [[Republic of Serbia]].

==Geography==
Bačka is a flat, fertile agricultural area within the larger [[Pannonian Plain]], which was once the ancient [[Pannonian Sea]]. In Hungary, it is seen as a southern extension of the [[Great Hungarian Plain|Great Alfold]] (itself part of the Pannonian Plain), while this designation is not used in Serbia where region is simply seen as a part of the Pannonian Plain. It lies between the River [[Danube]] to the west and south, and by the River Tisa ([[Tisza]]) to the east of which [[confluence]] is located near [[Titel]] in the [[South Bačka District]] of Serbia. The region is crisscrossed by parts of the [[Danube–Tisa–Danube Canal]] system which serves a variety of economic purposes. Almost all of Bačka is divided between Serbia and Hungary. However, there are small uninhabited pockets of the area on the left bank of the Danube which are ''de jure'' parts of [[Croatia]] according to the [[Badinter Arbitration Committee|Badinter Commission]]; the disputed areas have been under ''de facto'' Serbian control since 1991.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Most of the territory and a vast majority of the population of Bačka is part of Serbia's Autonomous Province of [[Vojvodina]]. This area within Serbia is officially divided into the districts of Southern Bačka, Western Bačka, and Northern Bačka. [[Novi Sad]], the capital of Vojvodina, lies on the border between Bačka and [[Syrmia]], on both banks of the river Danube. In some sources, Serbian part of Bačka is referred to as ''Central and Southern Bačka'' ({{lang-sr|Средња и јужна Бачка}} / Srednja i južna Bačka; {{lang-hu|Közép- és Dél-Bácska}}) or simply ''Southern Bačka'' ({{lang-sr|Јужна Бачка}} / ""Južna Bačka; Dél-Bácska''). The smaller part of the region in Hungary's [[Bács-Kiskun]] County is, by the same sources, described as ''Northern Bačka'' ({{lang-hu|Észak-Bácska}}; {{lang-sr|Северна Бачка}} / ''Severna Bačka'').

== Etymology ==
The derivation of the name is uncertain, yet it was as recent as 1927 that ‘Beira Lake’ first appeared on maps. Before that, it was called the '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''Colombo Lake''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' or just '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''The Lake''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One idea is that it got its name from a Portuguese Engineer called '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''Beira''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' who worked in constructing the lake&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; or from a Dutch Engineer called '''De Beer''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The idea of ''De Beer'' is supported by a granite plaque which was recovered from the sluice of the lake, inscribed "''De Beer 1700''".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Other idea is that it got named from the word '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''Beira''&lt;nowiki/&gt;', which in Portuguese meant the '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''Bank'' or ''Edge of the Lake''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another idea is that it got from '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''De Beer''&lt;nowiki/&gt;', which in Portuguese meant the '''Anchoring Poin''t'.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==History==
The lake was built by the Portuguese to provide protection to Colombo from enemies, mainly [[List of Sri Lankan monarchs|local kings]].

By 1518 Portuguese ruled over Colombo, but the increasing threats against Portuguese rule by [[Vijayabahu VII of Kotte|King Vijayabahu VII]] and Sinhalese forces made them to look for better solutions other than their modern weaponry. One of such begun ideas was making of a huge [[moat]] around the fort.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=කොළඹ පුරාණය|last=Kaluarachchi|first=Saman|publisher=Suriya Publications|year=2013|isbn=955-8892-33-5|location=|pages=113, 115, 117, 118, 120, 122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of the moat started by digging the marshy land which was around the fort in all direction other than west (west of fort was Indian Ocean). But these works were demotivated by the size of it and the small amount of water in the marsh which was not enough to fill a lake. But a stream which flowed between Mount of [[Dematagoda]] and [[Mount of St. Bastian]] was discovered in this situation by Portuguese [[Lopo de Brito|Captain Lopo de Brito]], while he was chasing away another invasion lead by [[Vijayabahu VII of Kotte|King Vijayabahu VII]]. After informing the officials at the fort about this stream, it was connected to the moat they have dug, creating Beira Lake.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Then the lake has been completely connected with the sea from both sides, separating the [[Fort (Colombo)|Colombo Fort]] from mainland. All means of transportation between mainland and the fort have been done using boats. Original are of the lake has been {{convert|1.61|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. [[Outflow channels|Primary outflows]] then have been the [[Kayman Gates]] to the east and [[St. John Canal|St. John's Canal]] to west. It has been bordered from Mount of St. Bastian, Mount of [[Wolfendal]] and from Mount of Kochchikade. To the north and west of the lake have been the Portuguese forts.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The nature of the lake then has been described in ''[[Conquista Temporale Espiritual de Ceylão]]'' (1687) by ''[[Fernão de Queyroz|Fr. Fernão de Queyroz]]'':&lt;blockquote&gt;"The lake around the City of Colombo is having a complete length of 10 ½ miles. It which had the Mount of Lawrence was surrounded by a lagoon. In some places at summer time it was deep only to the waist, and was a lake which gave access to City of Colombo"&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 1578, [[Mayadunne of Sitawaka|Mayadunne]] of the [[Kingdom of Sitawaka]] attempted to cut off supplies to the invaders but failed to drain the lake. His son [[Rajasinha I of Sitawaka|Rajasingha I]] (a.k.a. Sithawaka Rajasinghe) succeeded in 1587 to drain the [[crocodile]] infested lake by cutting off several [[canal]]s but failed to defeat the Portuguese as they brought reinforcements from [[Portuguese India|India]] through sea.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

After the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] laid siege and captured the lake it was expanded by reducing the fort by 1/3 of the previous and created several islands such as the [[Slave Island]] some of them were large enough to have a village and a plantation of 600 [[coconut]] trees. After the [[British Empire|British]] took control they removed the crocodiles and developed the area surrounding the lake for recreational activities such as [[rowing]] and [[yachting]]. The area around the lake was popular for parties including a [[Ball (dance party)|grand ball]] that was held to celebrate the news of British victory in [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]. Ceylon's first botanical garden the Kew Gardens was opened in Slave Island in 1810 to cultivate seedlings provided by the [[Royal Botanic Gardens Kew|Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew]] in London to be planted in [[Royal Botanical Gardens, Peradeniya|Peradeniya Botanical Gardens]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

By the 19th century land reclamation for development began and the land area of the lake was reduced, pollution also began to increase.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Basins and Canals Connected ==

The only canal the lake connected to is St. Bastian Canal from its northeast end. From the northwest, it outflows to the Indian Ocean via Mc. Callum Gates and via a semicircular spillway to the west (commonly known as "බේරේ බේසම" &lt;small&gt;&lt;abbr&gt;translit.&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/small&gt; ''Bērē bēsama =''Beira Basin).

==Greater Beira==
[[File:Beira Lake and Gangaramaya Temple.jpg|thumb|300px|The Southwest lake in the daytime|alt=]][[File:Colombo (3656420505).jpg|thumb|243x243px|The pedestrian footbridge over the southwest lake|alt=]]
Lined with many large warehouses, reminiscent of its past when tea used to be transported to the [[port of Colombo]] on barges via the port access canal, the lake now is very quiet with many of the warehouses been abandoned.

With maximum length of 1 mile, the lake has been home to [[Colombo Rowing Club]] for over 140 years.

The [[Sri Lanka Exhibition and Convention Centre]] is located on the waterfront, further the [[People's Bank (Sri Lanka)|People's Bank]] and the Inland Revenue Department headquarters are located in close to the lake.St. Joseph’s college Colombo, the only school in Sri Lanka to have its very own Rowing pier is situated on the banks of the Beira lake. The [[Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited]] is housed in the nearby "Lake House" building.

The lake with many government owned properties has been earmarked for development including a casino district on its McCullum road water front.

== Flora and fauna ==
The lake is home to species of storks, pelicans, monitor lizards and various species of fish.

==Pollution==
The lake gets its famous green color and unusually bad odour due to the result of pollution over hundreds of years and algae that is present in the water. The bad smell is mostly prominent during dry weather, due to the high rates evaporation and it fades off with the arrival of the rainy season.

=== Water Quality ===
Water of Beira Lake is polluted, from which it gets a bad odour and green colour. But contray to the canal system of Colombo, the lake contains water with a very alkaline pH value got by primary production and continuous bloom. In August it gets its maximum value, but becomes more neutral from top to bottom, pH value decreasing from 10 to 8. Lake water never gets acidic pH.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MCUDP|first=|date=January 2016|title=Physical Features: Water quality, Lake, Sediment and Soil Issues|url=https://www.ramsar.org/sites/default/files/Technical%20Report%2004_Water%20quality.pdf|department=Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development|journal=Wetland Management Stratergy|volume=Technical Report 04|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conductivity of the water retains fairly stable between 250 µS/cm and 300 µS/cm, with a slight increase from May to August.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Full temperature ranges between 29.3 and 35.4&amp;nbsp;°C. Average temperature is 31&amp;nbsp;°C and August is the warmest month. The temperature decreases rapidly 2 or 3&amp;nbsp;°C, from the surface to 60‐100&amp;nbsp;cm in‐depth and remains stable after that.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Dissolved Oxygen generally follows the same trend than temperature in August. Likewise the thermocline, an oxycline appears exclusively in August. Below 1 meter depth, DO is stable at 7&amp;nbsp;mg/l during May, June and July. Though it is decreased during August from 13&amp;nbsp;mg/l to 6&amp;nbsp;mg/l, shallow depth allows preserving a sufficient level of oxygen. But it would be more stressful during dry season.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Salinity is very stable (around 0.12 g/l) over time and along the water column.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Beira Lake Restoration==
The Beira Lake plays a major role in the [[Western Region Megapolis|Western Region Megapolis Project]]. Under the project the Beira lake is expected to be cleaned and developed with Singaporean assistance and private sector involvement. Waterways will be cleared by blocking illegal water outlets and sewerage lines into the lake and relocating settlements that dump waste to the lake in the area to [[Public housing|social housing]] units.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/160724/news/singapore-here-in-a-big-way-for-development-202308.html|title=Singapore here in a big way for development {{!}} The Sunday Times Sri Lanka|website=www.sundaytimes.lk|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lmd.lk/beira-lake-project-in-the-offing/|title=Beira Lake Project in the Offing|date=2017-01-24|newspaper=LMD|access-date=2017-02-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://colombogazette.com/2016/12/04/area-around-beira-lake-to-be-commercial-center/|title=Area around Beira Lake to be commercial center – Colombo Gazette|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Megapolis plan after the restoration a [[Shopping district]] ,an [[Entertainment district|Enternainment district]] and a promenade will be created in the area around the Beira lake alongside many hotels and mixed development projects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://megapolis.gov.lk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/WRMPP_MasterPlan_Eng_Apr16.pdf|title=Western Region Megapolis Masterplan -2030|last=|first=|date=|website=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bioregionalism''' is a [[politics|political]], [[culture|cultural]], and [[Ecology|ecological]] system or set of views based on naturally defined areas called [[bioregion]]s, similar to [[ecoregion]]s. Bioregions are defined through physical and environmental features, including [[Drainage basin|watershed]] boundaries and [[soil]] and [[terrain]] characteristics. Bioregionalism stresses that the determination of a bioregion is also a [[culture|cultural]] phenomenon, and emphasizes local populations, knowledge, and solutions.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.php/trumpet/article/view/260/385 Bioregionalism: The Need For a Firmer Theoretical Foundation]{{dead link|date=October 2017}}", Don Alexander, Trumpeter v13.3, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bioregionalism asserts "that a bioregion’s environmental components (geography, climate, plant life, animal life, etc.) directly influence ways for human communities to act and interact with each other which are, in turn, optimal for those communities to thrive in their environment. As such, those ways to thrive in their totality—be they economic, cultural, spiritual, or political—will be distinctive in some capacity as being a product of their bioregional environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://towardscascadia.com/2015/11/15/bioregionalism-place-shapes-identity/|title=Bioregionalism: Place Shapes Identity|last=M|first=Ryan|date=2015-11-15|website=Towards Cascadia|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bioregionalism is a concept that goes beyond [[national boundaries]]—an example is the concept of [[Cascadia (independence movement)|Cascadia]], a region that is sometimes considered to consist of most of [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], the [[Alaska Panhandle]], the far north of [[California]] and the [[West Coast of Canada]], sometimes also including some or all of [[Idaho]] and [[western Montana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cascadiaprospectus.org/2010/02/cascadia_the_new_frontier.php |title=Cascadia: The New Frontier |publisher=Cascadia Prospectus |date=2010-02-12 |accessdate=2012-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312125000/http://www.cascadiaprospectus.org/2010/02/cascadia_the_new_frontier.php |archivedate=2012-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of a bioregion, which does not cross national boundaries, but does overlap state lines, is [[the Ozarks]], a bioregion also referred to as the Ozarks Plateau, which consists of southern [[Missouri]], northwest [[Arkansas]], the northeast corner of [[Oklahoma]], southeast corner of [[Kansas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About OACC Ozark Area Community Congress|url=http://ozarkareacommunitycongress.org/|work=OACC Ozark Area Community Congress|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biogregions are not synonymous with ecoregions as defined by bodies such as the [[World Wildlife Fund]] or the [[Commission for Environmental Cooperation]]; the later are scientifically based and focused on wildlife and vegetation. Bioregions, by contrast are human regions, informed by nature but with a social and political element. In this way bioregionalism is simply [[political localism]] with an ecological foundation.

==Overview==
The term was coined by Allen Van Newkirk, founder of the Institute for Bioregional Research, in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McGinnis|first=Michael Vincent|title=Bioregionalism|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|location=London and New York|isbn=041515444-8|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; given currency by [[Peter Berg (bioregionalist)|Peter Berg]] and [[Raymond Dasmann]] in the early 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;Berg, Peter and Raymond Dasmann, "Reinhabiting California," ''The Ecologist'' 7, no. 10 (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; and has been advocated by writers such as [https://books.google.ca/books?id=n42Rf_ibaMcC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=david+haenke&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1AM-OxjlTj&amp;sig=1LBacDKoY42fT8ZcHu5eDmfQ46A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiox6e2qevKAhVFsoMKHQU6DCIQ6AEIRTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20haenke&amp;f=false David Haenke] and [[Kirkpatrick Sale]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Walter Truett. [https://archive.is/20120529125505/http://motherjones.com/print/16589 There's no going back to nature], ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' (September/October 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

The bioregionalist perspective opposes a homogeneous economy and consumer culture with its lack of stewardship towards the environment. This perspective seeks to:
*Ensure that political boundaries match ecological boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, S. (2007) "The Troubled Marriage of Deep Ecology and Bioregionalism," ''Environmental Values'', vol. 16(3): 313-332&lt;/ref&gt;
*Highlight the unique [[ecology]] of the bioregion.
*Encourage consumption of [[local food]]s where possible.
*Encourage the use of local [[natural resource|materials]] where possible.
*Encourage the cultivation of [[indigenous (ecology)|native plants]] of the region.
*Encourage [[sustainability]] in harmony with the bioregion.&lt;ref&gt;Bastedo, Jamie. ''Shield Country: The Life and Times of the Oldest Piece of the Planet'', Red Deer Press, 1994. {{ISBN|0-88995-191-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bioregional mapping''' is a powerful tool to increase understanding, change the story and influence policy.  A good bioregional map shows layers of geology, flora, fauna, and inhabitation over time. All the interdisciplinary content that is integrated in this kind of map makes it a great communication tool to illustrate an ecological approach. One of the best examples of a richly communicative bioregional map is David McClosky's [http://cascadia-institute.org/ new map of Cascadia].

==Relationship to environmentalism==

Bioregionalism, while akin to [[environmentalism]] in certain aspects, such as a desire to live in harmony with [[nature]], differs in certain ways from classical, 20th century environmentalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainable-city.org/intervws/berg.htm |title=Peter Berg of Planet Drum |publisher=Sustainable-city.org |date=1998-02-12 |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Peter Berg, bioregionalism is [[proactive]], and is based on forming a harmony between human culture and the natural environment, rather than being [[protest]]-based like the original environmental movement. Also, while classical environmentalists saw human industry as the [[enemy]] of nature and nature as a victim needing to be saved; bioregionalists see humanity and its culture as a part of nature, focusing on building a positive, sustainable relationship with the environment, rather than a focus on preserving and segregating the [[wilderness]] from the world of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainable-city.org/intervws/berg.htm |title=Peter Berg of Planet Drum |publisher=Sustainable-city.org |date=1998-02-12 |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In politics==
North American Bioregional Assemblies have been bi-annual gatherings of bioregionalists throughout North America since 1984 and have given rise to national level [[Green Parties]]. In addition, bioregionalism spawned the sustainability movement{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}. The tenets of bioregionalism are often used by green movements, which oppose political organizations whose boundaries conform to existing electoral districts.  This problem is perceived to result in elected representatives voting in accordance with their constituents, some of whom may live outside a defined bioregion, and may run counter to the well-being of the bioregion.

At the local level, several bioregions have congresses that meet regularly. For instance, the Ozark Plateau bioregion hosts a yearly Ozark Area Community Congress, better known as OACC, which has been meeting every year since 1980,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About OACC Ozark Area Community Congress|url=http://ozarkareacommunitycongress.org/|work=OACC Ozark Area Community Congress|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; most often on the first weekend in October. The Kansas Area Watershed, "KAW" was founded in 1982 and has been meeting regularly since that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kansas Area Watershed Council History|url=http://kawcouncil.wordpress.com/about/history/|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; KAW holds a yearly meeting, usually in the spring.

The government of the Canadian province of Alberta has recently made major amendments to its land-use policies including a separate "land-use framework" document for each major [[river basin]] within the province.  This is supported by local initiatives such as the [[Beaver Hills (Alberta)|Beaver Hills]] Initiative, which seeks to create a large [[biosphere reserve]] encompassing [[Elk Island National Park]] and the surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beaverhills.ca/|title=Home {{!}} Beaver Hills Initiative|website=www.beaverhills.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boledehi''' (بلیده ای:[[Balochi language|Baluchi]]) is a term referring to a group of [[Khan (title)|khan]]s and [[sardar]]s in southern [[Balochistan]], [[Sarbaz District|Sarbaz]] and [[Chah Bahar County|Chah Bahar]] provinces of [[South West Asia]]. 

For centuries, Boledehies were the [[Hakim (title)|Hakim]]s (princes) of [[Dashtiari District|Dashtyari]], [[Bahu district|Bahu]] and [[Rask, Sarbaz|Rask]]. Their Hakimate in Bahu collapsed due to emigration and the attack of  a [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]] aboriginal tribe known as the [[sardarzahi]] (or saddazahi), but they remained as influential hakims in Sarbaz and [[Nikshahr County|Nikshahr]].

A '''border barrier''' is a [[separation barrier]] that runs along an [[international border]]. Such barriers are typically constructed for [[border control]] purposes such as curbing [[illegal immigration]], [[human trafficking]], and [[smuggling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/07/09/return-fence-immigration-crisis-spurs-renewed-calls-for-border-barrier/ |title=Return of the Fence: Immigration crisis spurs renewed calls for border barrier |work=[[Fox News]] |date=2014-07-09 |accessdate=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1819/18191290.htm |title=Border Barrier |work=Frontline |date= |accessdate=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cases of a [[border conflict|disputed]] or [[Boundary delimitation|unclear border]], erecting a barrier can serve as a ''de facto'' unilateral consolidation of a [[territorial dispute|territorial claim]] that can supersede formal [[Boundary delimitation|delimitation]]. 

Examples of border walls  include the ancient [[Great Wall of China]], a series of walls separating China from [[nomadic empires]] to the north. The construction of border barriers increased in the early 2000s; half of all the border barriers built since World War II ended in 1945 were built after 2000.&lt;ref name="FriedmanWalls"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Friedman|first1=Uri|title=A World of Walls|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/05/donald-trump-wall-mexico/483156/|accessdate=20 May 2016|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Barriers by region==

===Africa===

====Botswana====
In 2003, [[Botswana]] began building a {{convert|300|mi|km|adj=on}}-long [[electric fence]] along its border with [[Zimbabwe]]. The official reason for the fence is to stop the spread of [[foot-and-mouth disease]] among livestock. Zimbabweans argue that the height of the fence is clearly intended to keep out people. Botswana has responded that the fence is designed to keep out cattle, and to ensure that entrants have their shoes disinfected at legal border crossings. Botswana also argued that the government continues to encourage legal movement into the country. Zimbabwe was unconvinced, and the barrier remains a source of tension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|periodical=BBC News|title=Zimbabwe crisis spills over border|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3582459.stm|last=Phillips|first=Barnaby|date=2004-03-30 | accessdate=January 4, 2010|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ceuta====
{{main article|Ceuta border fence}}

The Ceuta border fence was erected in 1993 at the [[Morocco–Spain border]] at [[Ceuta]], a city on the North African coast that is Spanish territory in order to block the entrance of illegal immigrants to Spain.

====Melilla====
{{main article|Melilla border fence}}
The Melilla border fence stands at the [[Morocco–Spain border]] at [[Melilla]], a city on the North African coast that is Spanish territory, in order to block the entrance of illegal immigrants to Spain.

====Morocco====
{{main article|Moroccan Wall}}
The [[Moroccan Wall]] is an approximately {{convert|2,700|km}} long structure, mostly a sand wall (or "[[berm]]"), running through the region of [[Western Sahara]] and the southeastern portion of [[Morocco]]. It acts as a barrier between the [[Morocco|Moroccan]]-controlled areas ([[Southern Provinces]]) and the [[Polisario Front|Polisario]]-controlled section of the territory – [[Free Zone (region)|Free Zone]] or ''de facto'' the self-proclaimed [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]] that lies along its eastern and southern border.

According to maps from [[MINURSO]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minurso.unlb.org/MINURSO_Ceasefire.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 27, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027155338/http://www.minurso.unlb.org/MINURSO_Ceasefire.pdf |archivedate=October 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[UNHCR]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/453f1b104.html |title=UNHCR – Western Sahara Atlas Map – June 2006 |website=Unhcr.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; part of the wall extends several kilometers into internationally recognized Mauritanian territory.

====South Africa====
[[Image:mozam-sa-fence.jpg|thumb|Security fence along the [[South Africa]]–[[Mozambique]] border.]]

In 1975 a security fence of {{convert|120|km|mi}} was erected by [[South Africa]] to keep the violent revolution in [[Mozambique]] from spilling into [[Kruger National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.telkomsa.net/leveypa/Kruger/imagepages/Dsc00042.html |title=RSA – Mozambique Border Fence |publisher=Home.telkomsa.net |date= |accessdate=2013-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 it was reported:
{{quote|Concern is growing in South Africa over the country's use of a lethal, 3,300 [[volt]] one amp electrified fence on its borders with Mozambique and Zimbabwe. According to a report recently published by the South African Catholic Bureau for Refugees, the fence has caused more deaths in three years than the Berlin Wall did in its entire history. Local people call the fence the 'Snake of Fire'. There have been calls by South African church leaders over the past months for the fence to be switched off permanently. Most of its victims have been women and children fleeing the war in Mozambique. The Berlin Wall resulted in 80 deaths over 28 years. Official figures provided by the [[South African Defence Force]] (SADF) indicate that 89 people were electrocuted at the fence between August 1986 and August 1989. Church leaders dispute these figures, and claim that the true figure is nearer 200 each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Monteiro |first=Tania |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12517011.000-hundreds-killed-by-south-africas-border-fence-.html/ |title='Hundreds killed' by South Africa's border fence |publisher=[[New Scientist]] |date=1990-01-27 |accessdate=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On December 9, 2002, by the presidents of South Africa, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe signed a treaty authorizing the fence to be torn down in order to re-open the ancient [[elephant]] migration route between South Africa and Mozambique. The [[Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park]] of {{convert|35000|km2|sqmi}} will connect the national parks of the three countries – South Africa's [[Kruger National Park]], Mozambique's [[Limpopo National Park]], and Zimbabwe's [[Gonarezhou National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/02/0211_030211_limpopo.html/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 22, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523181629/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/02/0211_030211_limpopo.html |archivedate=May 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 it was reported that only a relatively small portion of the high-security border fence separating South Africa's Kruger National Park with Zimbabwe's Gonarezhou Park had been removed. Security concerns, especially about illegal immigrants and the smuggling of weapons and four-wheel-drive vehicles, have been hindering the removal of more sections of the border fence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id%3D1%26click_id%3D31%26art_id%3Dvn20050327135740672C194658%2F |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 22, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124235523/http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=31&amp;art_id=vn20050327135740672C194658%2F |archivedate=January 24, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Americas===
====Ecuador====
In 2017, [[Ecuador]] began building a border wall along its 1,529 km (950 mile) border with [[Peru]] in order to stop smuggling.&lt;ref name=ReutersWall&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-peru-ecuador-wall-idUSKBN18W2UF Reuters: "Peru asks Ecuador to halt construction of border wall"] Jun 5, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://qcostarica.com/ecuadors-unannounced-border-wall-angers-peruvian-officials/ QCosta Rica news: "Ecuador’s Unannounced Border Wall Angers Peruvian Officials – Ecuador officials said construction is aimed at better controlling flooding and opening up the free transit of people once a pedestrian bridge is built"] 8 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Peru subsequently asked that Ecuador immediately stop construction.&lt;ref name=ReutersWall /&gt;

====United States====
{{Main article|Mexico–United States barrier}}
The [[United States]] has constructed a border barrier along {{convert|81|mi|km}} of its [[Mexico–United States border|border]] with [[Mexico]] of {{convert|1,969|mi|km}} to prevent [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigration]] and to deter smuggling of contraband, particularly illegal drugs. There has been legislation in the [[U.S. Congress]] on lengthening the barrier, but progress has been slow due to [[lobbying]] and lack of funding. In parts of the US (deserts and mountainous areas), there is only inferior fencing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d06770.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Donald Trump]] promised to build a {{convert|1,954|mi|km|adj=on}} border wall along the entire US–Mexico border during his [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.donaldjtrump.com/policies/immigration&lt;/ref&gt; A large majority of Registered and self identified Democrats&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Most Americans support DACA, but oppose border wall – CBS News poll|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/most-americans-support-daca-but-oppose-border-wall-cbs-news-poll/|website=CBS|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; do not support the construction or extension of a barrier on the border. According to Democrats, the construction of a barrier would be redundant.

===Asia===

====Afghanistan====
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
In January 2006, [[Afghanistan]]'s government decreed that the [[United Nations]], the American [[embassy]], and other foreign organizations in [[Kabul]] must clear concrete security barriers that protect their buildings. Most Kabul streets are full of security barriers and large concrete anti-blast blocks aimed at protecting against the insurgent and [[terrorist attacks]] that have risen in the past four years since the fall of the [[Taliban]] regime. The decree follows pressure from the newly formed [[Politics of Afghanistan|Afghan parliament]] and public complaints over the heavy traffic jams caused by the barriers. The foreign groups are expressing concern and saying that the security situation does not permit that. The United Nations is one of the organizations concerned by the [[Politics of Afghanistan|Afghan government's]] order. UN chief spokesman in Kabul Adrian Edwards said that security barriers are still required. "We are in a difficult security environment which certainly hasn't improved during 2005", Edwards said. "There have been a number of [[suicide attacks]]. Within the UN here, I think none of us would wish to be behind these barricades, we would prefer things could be open as we are in some other countries. However, there have been necessary for our security, that's why they are there." The Afghan government has said it is determined to remove all the barricades. The directive of the government says that "blocking the footpaths, streets, and roads is illegal" and that no one has the right to create obstructions, the only exception being the [[presidential palace]].

====Brunei====
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
[[Brunei]] is building a security fence along its {{convert|20|km}} border with [[Limbang]], [[Malaysia]], to stop the flow of irregular migrants and smuggled goods.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

====China (Hong Kong and Macau Special Administrative Regions) ====
The [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) has two [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Regions]] on its southeastern coast – [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], both of which maintain controlled intra-national borders with the neighbouring [[Guangdong|Guangdong province]] in [[Mainland China]]. An [[identity document]] is inspected when one crosses the border.

Hong Kong was a [[British Overseas Territory|Dependent Territory]] of the [[United Kingdom|UK]] until its [[sovereignty]] was [[Transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|handed over to the PRC in 1997]], while Macau was a [[Political divisions of Portugal#Former regions|Special Territory]] of [[Portugal]] until its sovereignty was [[History of Macau#Handover to the People's Republic of China|handed over to the PRC in 1999]]. Before the transfers of sovereignty back to the PRC, the Hong Kong–Guangdong and Macau–Guangdong borders were regarded as [[international border]]s.

Under the principle of "[[One Country, Two Systems]]", the two Special Administrative Regions continue to maintain their own [[customs]] and [[immigration]] policies, which are independent of those in Mainland China after the handovers. Due to differences in the policies between the special administrative regions and the Mainland, the Hong Kong–Guangdong and Macau–Guangdong borders have been maintained in operation after the returns.

[[Hong Kong]] has a border stretching {{convert|32|km}} with the [[Shenzhen]] [[Special Economic Zone]] of Guangdong that features fences (topped with [[barbed tape]]/razor wire), thermal image sensors, lights, and [[closed-circuit television]]. Some sections are along the Shenzhen River thus acting as a physical barrier. The border is also patrolled regularly by police (and previously by the [[British Army]] until a short time before the handover in 1997). Just south of [[Shenzhen River]] (the geographical [[delimitation]] of the border) is a strip of rural land with restricted access, the {{convert|28|km2}} [[Closed Area]]. Currently, the four road border crossings are located at [[Sha Tau Kok]], [[Man Kam To]], [[Lok Ma Chau]], and [[Shenzhen Bay Control Point|Shenzhen Bay]], and a railway and traveller crossing is located at [[Lo Wu]]. The residents of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region are required to have their [[Hong Kong Identity Card|Hong Kong ID Cards]] inspected by the [[Immigration Department|Hong Kong Immigration Department]] and their [[Home Return Permit]]s inspected by the [[Public Security Bureau]] of Guangdong when they cross the border. Travelers from other countries and regions are required to present their passports or other types of travel documents for immigration clearance at both Hong Kong immigration checkpoints and Mainland China immigration ports.

[[Macau]] has been maintaining a {{convert|340|m}} controlled border with [[Zhuhai|Zhuhai City]] in Guangdong with a crossing available at the [[Portas do Cerco|Border Gate]] (built in 1870).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiarooms.com/travel-guide/macau/sightseeing-in-macau/barrier-gate.html |title=LateRooms – Last Minute Hotel Deals &amp; Cheap Hotels |website=AsiaRooms.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The border crossing is equipped with 54 counters for travelers and 8 for vehicular traffic. Opened in 1999, [[Macau]]'s [[Transportation in Macau|Lotus Bridge]] supplemented what has been the only border crossing into mainland China through Border Gate. Both border crossings allow access to [[Zhuhai]]. [[Canal dos Patos (Macau)|Canal dos Patos]], a former canal forms part of the border area along with [[Sun Yat Sen Park, Macau|Sun Yat-sen Municipal Park]] located to west of Border Gate area. Fencing along both sides of the canal restricts access to either side. Pagoda-like sentry towers are located along the Mainland China side of the border.

====China (Mainland) ====
China, in October 2006, is also building a security barrier along its border with [[North Korea]] to prevent [[illegal immigrant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2006/10/china-building-border-fence-facing.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 23, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820005602/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2006/10/china-building-border-fence-facing.php |archivedate=August 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Egypt====
{{main article|Egypt–Gaza barrier}}

Egypt began construction of a formidable barrier between [[Egypt]] and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] in 2009 prompted by concern that militant Islamist factions were making use of the [[Gaza Strip smuggling tunnels]] to move weapons and personnel between Gaza and Egypt.&lt;ref name="FraserBuildingWall"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fraser|first1=Christian|title=Egypt starts building steel wall on Gaza Strip border|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8405020.stm|accessdate=17 February 2017|publisher=BBC|date=9 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
[[Image:Kashmir map big.jpg|thumb|Along the black-dotted line and on the working boundary]]
Since the mid-1990s, [[India]] has been involved in the construction of some of the lengthiest border barriers along its international borders. Six of the nine countries neighboring India are classified as [[Least Developed Countries]], and thus thousands of people from these countries – especially from [[Bangladesh]] and [[Burma]] – illegally immigrate into India.

The [[India–Bangladesh barrier]] and [[India–Myanmar barrier]] are being built to check smuggling, illegal immigration, and infiltration by Islamist terrorists. The refugee crisis could also ensue should a climate catastrophe ravage South Asia.

In addition, India completed the construction of the [[Indian Kashmir barrier]], which runs along the [[Line of Control]] in [[Kashmir]]. The purpose of this barrier is to prevent infiltration by armed militants.

====Iran====
The [[Iran–Pakistan barrier]] wall is {{convert|700|km}} long, which Iran claims is to stop the flow of illegal border crossings, stem the flow of drugs, and prevent terror attacks. However, the [[Provincial Assembly of Balochistan]], whose lands straddle the border region, strongly opposed the barrier as the wall would divide the [[Baloch people]] politically and socially, with trade and social activities being seriously impeded.

Leader of the Opposition, Kachkol Ali, said the governments of the two countries had not taken the Baloch into their confidence on this matter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/2007/05/27/top8.htm |title=Debate on Iran border wall disallowed |date=May 27, 2007 |publisher=dawn.com |accessdate=2013-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222401/http://www.dawn.com/2007/05/27/top8.htm |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and demanded that construction be stopped immediately and he also appealed to the international community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.india-defence.com/reports/2911 |accessdate=September 22, 2013 |title=BAE Systems to deliver 145 M777 Ultra Light Howitzers to the Indian Army |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121118232752/http://www.india-defence.com/reports/2911 |archivedate=November 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Residents of the Sorap locality in the Mand area of western Mekran region in Balochistan province rely on edible goods from Iran for their livelihood but Iranian border security forces vacate the town.

====Israel====
{{further information|West Bank barrier}}
Due to [[Israel]]'s specific security situation, as well as immigration concerns, border fences and walls have been utilized:
* [[Jerusalem]]: During the 1950s and 1960s a fortified barrier separated [[Jordan]]ian and Israeli-controlled sectors of the city. More recently, the [[West Bank barrier]] separates some Arab parts of greater Jerusalem form the city proper.&lt;ref&gt;"Behind the Wall – Shuafat Camp", Ir Amim Special Report. 2006. http://www.ir-amim.org.il/eng/?CategoryID=330  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523114441/http://www.ir-amim.org.il/eng/?CategoryID=330 |date=May 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]]: Israel's borders with Lebanon and Syria have sophisticated security barriers. 
** The barrier on the [[Golan Heights]] follows the border shaped by battles of  the [[Yom Kippur War]], but handed [[Kuneitra]] back to Syria. 
* [[Egypt]]: Barrier proposed in 2005 and completed in 2013 to block smugglers, terrorists and illegal migrants.
* [[Jordan]]: This peaceful border is secured with a barrier designed to prevent the illegal movement of people in either direction.
* The [[Israel–Gaza barrier]] follows the [[1949 Armistice lines]].

We are experts at mining, they should mine the border on their side. We will fence it on our side. If that is all right I am for it, so that they are not allowed to go across at all. And then let us see what is happening in Afghanistan. Why don't they agree to this, I've said this openly many times before, they don't do it, for whatever are their reasons. I know how effective the fence, the Indian fence which is about 1,800 kilometres, and they are fencing the Kashmir mountains also, it is so difficult. Why are they doing that, are they mad, they are spending billions of rupees. Because it is effective. Let's fence this border so that this blame game is killed once for ever.

In [[Fiji]]an [[mythology]], '''Bulu''' (pronounced: ''Mbúlu'') is a name for the 'world of spirits' (presumably the [[underworld]]). In the month called ''Vula-i-Ratumaibulu'',&lt;ref&gt;'The month of Ratumaibulu', corresponding roughly to November&lt;/ref&gt; the god [[Ratumaibulu]] comes from Bulu, the world of spirits, to make the breadfruit and other fruit trees blossom and yield fruit. Ratumaibulu is a [[god]] of great importance who presides over [[agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada'', 1907, pages 153, 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another source refers to a "place called '[[Nabagatai]]' on the road to 'Bulu', the separate state or land of souls".&lt;ref&gt;''The Quarterly Review'', page 170. (year of publication unknown)&lt;/ref&gt;

The most westerly point of the island of [[Vanua Levu]] was the place from which the departed spirits started out for Bulu, the eternal abode of the blessed (Freese 2005:70).

'''Carl Ortwin Sauer''' (December 24, 1889 &amp;ndash; July 18, 1975) was an American [[geographer]].  Sauer was a [[professor]] of [[geography]] at the [[University of California at Berkeley]] from 1923 until becoming professor [[emeritus]] in 1957. He has been called "the dean of American historical geography"&lt;ref&gt;Christopher R. Boyer, "Geographic Regionalism and Natural Diversity," in ''A Companion to Mexican History and Culture'', ed. William H. Beezley. Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell 2011, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; and he was instrumental in the early development of the geography graduate school at Berkeley. One of his best known works was ''Agricultural Origins and Dispersals'' (1952). In 1927, Carl Sauer wrote the article "Recent Developments in Cultural Geography," which considered how cultural landscapes are made up of "the forms superimposed on the physical landscape."

==Early years==
Sauer, of [[German American|German ancestry]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.upress.virginia.edu/detail%2Fbooks%2Fgroup-4409.xml University of Virginia Press Books]&lt;/ref&gt; was born in [[Warrenton, Missouri]] and graduated from the [[University of Chicago]] with a [[Ph.D.]] in 1915.

==Career==
Carl Sauer's paper "The Morphology of Landscape"&lt;ref&gt;Sauer, C. O. 1925. "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography 2'' (2):19-53.&lt;/ref&gt; was probably the most influential English-language article in introducing ideas on [[cultural landscape]]s&lt;ref&gt;James, P. E. and Martin, G. 1981, ''All Possible Worlds: A history of geographical ideas'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1981: 321-324&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leighly, J. 1963. ''Land and Life: A selection from the writings of Carl Ortwin Sauer''. Berkeley: University of California Press, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Price, M., and M. Lewis. 1993. "The Reinvention of Cultural Geography". ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'' 83 (1):1-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, M. 1983. "The apple of my eye: Carl Sauer and historical geography". ''Journal of Historical Geography'' 9 (1):1-28.&lt;/ref&gt; and is still cited today. However, Sauer's paper was really about his own vision for the discipline of geography, which was to establish the discipline on a [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] basis, rather than being specifically concerned with cultural landscapes. "Every field of knowledge is characterized by its declared preoccupation with a certain group of phenomena," according to Sauer.&lt;ref&gt;Sauer, C. O. 1925. "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography 2'', p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Geography was assigned the study of areal knowledge or landscapes or [[chorology]]—following the thoughts of [[Alfred Hettner]].&lt;ref&gt;Sauer, C. O. 1925. "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography 2'', p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; "Within each landscape there are phenomena that are not simply there but are either associated or independent of each other." Sauer saw the geographer's task as being to discover the [[area]]l connection between [[phenomena]].&lt;ref&gt;Sauer, C. O. 1925. "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography 2'', p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Thus "the task of geography is conceived as the establishment of a critical system which embraces the phenomenology of landscape, in order to grasp in all of its meaning and colour the varied terrestrial scene" &lt;ref&gt;Sauer, C. O. 1925. "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography 2'', p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; A collection of Sauer's letters while doing fieldwork in South America has been published.&lt;ref&gt;
Carl Ortwin Sauer, ''Andean reflections: letters from Carl O. Sauer while on a South American trip under a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, 1942''. Boulder, Colo. : Westview Press, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sauer was a fierce critic of [[environmental determinism]], which was the prevailing theory in geography when he began his career. He proposed instead an approach variously called "landscape morphology" or "cultural history." This approach involved the inductive gathering of facts about the human impact on the landscape over time. Sauer rejected [[positivism]], preferring [[Historical particularism|particularist]] and historicist understandings of the world. He drew on the work of [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Alfred Kroeber]] and was influenced by German Latin Americanist [[geography|geographer]] [[Oskar Schmieder]]—a disciple of Hettner—, and later critics accused him of introducing a "superorganic" concept of culture into geography.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, J. 1980. "The superorganic in American cultural geography". ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'' 70:181-198. But see also Solot, M. 1986. "Carl Sauer and cultural evolution". ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'' 76(4):508-520.&lt;/ref&gt; Politically Sauer was a conservative {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}, but expressed concern about the way that modern [[capitalism]] and [[centralized government]] were destroying the [[cultural diversity]] and environmental health of the world. He believed that agriculture, and domestication of plants and animals had an effect on the physical environment.

After his retirement, Sauer's school of human-environment geography developed into [[cultural ecology]], [[political ecology]], and [[historical ecology]]. Historical ecology retains Sauer's interest in human modification of the landscape and pre-modern cultures.

==Awards==
He was awarded an Honorary Fellowship from the [[American Geographical Society]] in 1935, and its [[Charles Patrick Daly#Honors|Daly Medal]] in 1940.&lt;ref name="amergeog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amergeog.org/honorslist.pdf|title=American Geographical Society Honorary Fellowships|publisher=amergeog.org|accessdate=2009-03-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326222952/http://www.amergeog.org/honorslist.pdf|archivedate=2009-03-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Graduate students==
Sauer graduated many doctoral students, the majority completing dissertations on Latin American and Caribbean topics and thereby founding the [[Berkeley School of Latin Americanist Geography]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott S. Brown and Kent Mathewson, "Sauer's Descent?, Or Berkeley Roots Forever?," ''APCG Yearbook'' 61 (1999): 137-57&lt;/ref&gt; The first generation consisted of Sauer's own students: [[Fred B. Kniffen]] (1930), [[Peveril Meigs]] (1932), Donald Brand (1933), Henry Bruman (1940), Felix W. McBryde (1940), Robert Bowman (1941), Dan Stanislawski (1944), Robert C. West (1946), James J. Parsons (1948), Edwin Doran (1953), Philip Wagner (1953), Brigham Arnold (1954), Homer Aschmann (1954), B. LeRoy Gordon (1954), Gordon Merrill (1957), Donald Innis (1958), Marvin W. Mikesell (1958), Carl Johannessen (1959), Clinton Edwards (1962), and Leonard Sawatzky (1967).

Among them, Parsons remained at the [[University of California at Berkeley]] and became prolific in directing Latin Americanist doctoral dissertations. His doctoral students formed the second generation of the Berkeley School: Campbell Pennington (1959), William Denevan (1963), David Harris (1963), David Radell (1964), Thomas Veblen (1975), Karl Zimmerer (1987), Paul F. Starrs (1989), John B. Wright (1990), and David J. Larson (1994). Apart from Latin America, Parsons' Ph.D. students such as Alvin W. Urquhart (1962) also worked in Africa.

Denevan became a professor at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] and, in turn, produced a third generation: Daniel Gade (1967), Bernard Nietschmann (1970), Roger Byrne (1972), Roland Bergmann (1974), [[Billie Lee Turner II]] (1974), Gregory Knapp (1984), Kent Mathewson (1987), John M. Treacy (1989), and Oliver Coomes (1992). Mikesell became a professor at the [[University of Chicago]] and also produced a third generation.

A member of the fourth generation, [[William E. Doolittle]] studied with Turner, earned the [[Ph.D.]] in 1979, became a professor in the [[Department of Geography and the Environment at University of Texas at Austin]], and has extended the school into the fifth generation: Dean P. Lambert (1992), [[Andrew Sluyter]] (1995), Emily H. Young (1995), Eric P. Perramond (1999), Phil L. Crossley  (1999), Jerry O. (Joby) Bass (2003), Maria G. Fadiman (2003), and Matthew Fry (2008).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ine.gob.mx/publicaciones/libros/645/kent.pdf Kent Mathewson, "Sauer’s Berkeley School Legacy: Foundation for an Emergent Environmental Geography?,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415172328/http://www2.ine.gob.mx/publicaciones/libros/645/kent.pdf |date=2012-04-15 }}.

The '''Cayman Ridge''' is a submarine [[mountain range]] on the northern margin of the [[Cayman Trough]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. It extends from the [[Sierra Maestra]] in the east to the [[Misteriosa Bank]] in the west, a distance of about {{nowrap|{{Convert|1500|km|mi|abbr=on}}}}. The Cayman Ridge also includes the [[Cayman Islands]].&lt;ref name="AJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.emporia.edu/aberjame/student/unruh1/webpage.html#Ridge|title=The Cayman Islands: A Geological View| date=2008-05-01|accessdate=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ridge formed as an [[island arc]] when the Cayman Trough was the site of a [[subduction]] zone during the [[Paleocene]] and [[Eocene]] [[epoch (geology)|epochs]]. As the dynamics of the area changed, the subduction zone became a [[transform fault]] zone with a [[pull-apart basin]] during which time [[volcanism]] had dwindled along the entire length of the arc. The Cayman Ridge is now an inactive volcanic zone.&lt;ref name="AJ"/&gt;

Many countries around the world have [[civil defense]] organizations dedicated to protecting civilians from military attacks and providing rescue services after widespread disasters. In most countries, civil defense is a government-managed and often volunteer-staffed organization.

Towards the end of the Cold War, a number of civil defense organizations have been disbanded or mothballed (as in the case of the [[Royal Observer Corps]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States civil defense]]), while others have changed their focuses into providing rescue services after natural disasters (as for the [[State Emergency Service]] in [[Australia]]).

As with many other matters in Canada, responsibility is shared between the federal and provincial government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Emergency Management Framework for Canada  Second Edition|url=https://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/rsrcs/pblctns/mrgnc-mngmnt-frmwrk/index-eng.aspx|website=Public Safety Canada|publisher=Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada|accessdate=25 May 2015|ISBN=978-1-100-17186-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first post-WWII civil defence co-ordinator was appointed in October 1948 "to supervise the work of federal, provincial and municipal authorities in planning for public air-raid shelters, emergency food and medical supplies, and the evacuation of likely target areas".&lt;ref name=canenccivdef&gt;{{cite web|title=Civil Defence|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/civil-defence/|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=HISTORICA FOUNDATION|accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, the Government of Canada, under [[John Diefenbaker]] handed authority for civilian defense to the Emergency Measures Organisation (EMO).&lt;ref name=canenccivdef /&gt; Large fallout shelters, known as "[[Diefenbunkers]]" were built at rural locations outside major cities across Canada at the height of the Cold War during the infancy of the ICBM threat.

The EMO then became Emergency Planning Canada in 1974, then Emergency Preparedness Canada in 1986. In February 2001, the Government replaced Emergency Preparedness with the  Office of Critical Infrastructure Protection and Emergency Preparedness (OCIPEP), responsible for civilian emergency planning in both peace and war.&lt;ref name=canenccivdef /&gt;

Among the "Core Missions" of the Canada First Defense Strategy (under the Canadian Department of National Defense) are to respond to terrorist attacks and other crises such as natural disasters.&lt;ref name=Can1&gt;{{cite web|title=Six Core Missions|url=http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/pri/first-premier/missions-eng.asp|work=Canada First Defence Strategy|publisher=National Defence and the Canadian Forces|accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Emergency Management Act, the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness is responsible for exercising leadership relating to emergency management in Canada by coordinating, among government institutions and in cooperation with the provinces and other entities, emergency management activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emergency Management Act|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/E-4.56/page-1.html#h-1|website=Justice Laws Website|publisher=Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada|accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Colluvium''' (also '''colluvial material''' or '''colluvial soil''') is a general name for loose, unconsolidated [[sediment]]s that have been deposited at the base of hillslopes by either rainwash, sheetwash, slow continuous [[downslope creep]], or a variable combination of these processes. Colluvium is typically composed of a heterogeneous range of rock types and sediments ranging from [[silt]] to [[Rock (geology)|rock]] fragments of various sizes. This term is also used to specifically refer to sediment deposited at the base of a hillslope by unconcentrated [[surface runoff]] or sheet [[erosion]].

== Location ==

'''Colluviation''' refers to the buildup of colluvium at the base of a hillslope.&lt;ref name="JacksonOthers2005a"&gt;Jackson, JA, J Mehl, and K. Neuendorf (2005) ''Glossary of Geology'' American Geological Institute, Alexandria, Virginia. 800 pp. {{ISBN|0-922152-76-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodie2003a"&gt;Goodie, AS (2003) ''Colluvium'' in A. S. Goodie, ed., pp. 173, Encyclopedia of Geomorphology Volume 1, A–I. Routledge, New York, New York. 1200 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Colluvium is  typically loosely consolidated angular material located at the base of a steep hill slope or cliff.  Colluvium accumulates as gently sloping aprons or fans, either at the base of or within gullies and hollows within hillslopes. These accumulations of colluvium can be several meters in thickness and often contain buried soils ([[paleosol]]s), crude bedding, and cut and fill sequences.{{cn|date=January 2016}}
[[File:Talus cones.jpg|thumb|This [[Scree|talus]] accumulation is an example of colluvium]]

== Importance ==

Thick accumulations of colluvium may preserve a rich record of long term [[paleoclimatic]] change based on the paleosols and the remains of plants and animals, invertebrate and vertebrates that they often contain.&lt;ref name="Goodie2003a" /&gt; These fossils indicate previous geologic and environmental settings.  Thick accumulations of colluvium often contain well-preserved and sometimes deeply buried archaeological deposits as excavated at the [[Cherokee Sewer Site]], [[Cherokee County, Iowa]], and the [[Koster Site]], [[Greene County, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="Anderson1980a"&gt;Anderson, D, and HA Semken (1980) ''The Cherokee Excavations: Holocene Ecology and Human Adaptations in Northwestern Iowa.'' Academic Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Angel1990a"&gt;Angel JR (1990) ''Koster site archaeology I: stratigraphy and landscape evolution.'' Research Series. vol. 8. Center for American Archeology, Kampsville, Illinois.&lt;/ref&gt; Colluvium can also be rocks that have been transported downward from [[glacier]]s and so can indicate past stages of cooler and/or wetter weather. Deposits of detrital colluvium can reveal the soil composition and signify processes of chemical weathering.

== Colluvium vs alluvium ==

The definitions of colluvium and [[alluvium]] are interdependent and reliant on one another.  Distinctions between the two are important in order to properly define the [[Geomorphology|geomorphic]] processes that have occurred in a specific geological setting.  Alluvium is sand, clay, or other similar detrital material deposited by running water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = colluvium {{!}} rock detritus and soil accumulated at the foot of a slope|url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/colluvium|website = www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate = 2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The distinction between colluvium and alluvium relates to the involvement of running water. Alluvium specifically refers to the geomorphic processes involved with flowing water and so alluvium is generally fine-grained clay and silt material that has the capacity to be [[Entrainment (physical geography)|entrained]] in water currents and eventually deposited. For these same reasons, alluvium is also generally well sorted material while colluvium is not.

The '''El Indio Gold Belt''' is a mineral-rich region spanning the border between Chile and Argentina that contains large quantities of gold, silver and copper.  On both sides of the border the belt is located within the [[Andes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18377730.html|title=El Indio and Tambo.

The El Indio mine within the district was the first modern mine in Chile to produce gold as its main product.  In Chile the main precious metal containing mineral is [[enargite]].  The El Indio belt is bordered in the north by another gold-silver mining district known as the Frontera District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silverwheaton.com/SilverStreams/Other/default.aspx |title=Veladero Mine (Argentina) |accessdate=2010-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128073621/http://silverwheaton.com/SilverStreams/Other/default.aspx |archivedate=2010-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[:fr:Rodalquilarite|Rodalquilarite]], [[alunite]] and poughit are some of the [http://www.mindat.org/gallery.php?cform_is_valid=1&amp;loc=24399&amp;cf_pager_page=1&amp;wall=1 minerals present in the area].

==History==
In Chile the district was first officially recognized in 1975 and operated in 1979.  '''El Indio''', the main mine in the area was discovered in 1975 by [[St. Joe Minerals]], and placed in production in 1981, with initial production of bonanza gold from quartz-gold veins: 500, 000 MT @ 121 g/MT Au.  Total production plus reserves was quoted (circa 2000) as 23.2 mt @ 6.6 g/t Au, 50 g/t Ag, 4% Cu. Individual drill samples in the bonanza for assay were so rich, visible gold could be easily panned from the assay pulps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-17966429.html|title=El Indio rejuvenated under Barrick Gold|date=1996-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EIGB/&gt;

El Indio was purchased by Barrick Chile in 1994; that mine is associated with a [[hydrothermal vent|hydrothermal system]] of a [[volcanic caldera]]. 
Chile's portion of the belt consisted of 3 major mines; El Indio, [[Pascua Lama]], and Tambo (since 1995).&lt;ref name=EIGB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portergeo.com.au/database/mineinfo.asp?mineid=mn071|title=El Indio Belt Chile|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gold reserves in the belt located within Argentina may be as high as 35 million ounces.&lt;ref name=malbex/&gt;

One of the largest mines in the belt, the Tambo Mine operated by Barrick Gold, closed in 2001 after attempts by the company to replace reserves proved unsuccessful.  The mine, with a design capacity of 200,000 ounces a year was deplete of gold by 1999–2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infomine.com/index/properties/TAMBO_MINE.html|title=Tambo Mine|accessdate=2010-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The El Indio mine closed in 2002, and the site has since been reclaimed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4TQUqCXJIA El Indio Mine closure &amp; reclamation], video by Barrick Gold  &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European microstates''' or '''European ministates''' are a set of [[microstate|very small]] [[sovereign state]]s in [[Europe]]. The term is typically used to refer to the [[List of European countries by area|six smallest states in Europe by area]]: [[Andorra]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Malta]], [[Monaco]], [[San Marino]], and [[Vatican City]].&lt;ref&gt;Klieger, P. C. (2012). ''The Microstates of Europe: Designer Nations in a Post-Modern World''. Lexington Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Four of these states are [[monarchy|monarchies]] (three [[principality|principalities]]—Andorra, Liechtenstein, and Monaco—and one papacy, the Vatican City), with all these states tracing their status back to the first millennium or the early second millennium, except for Liechtenstein, created in the 17th century.

[[Microstate]]s are small independent states recognized by larger states, unlike [[micronation]]s, which are only self-declared and not recognized. According to the qualitative definition suggested by Dumienski (2014), microstates can also be viewed as "modern protected states, i.e. sovereign states that have been able to unilaterally depute certain attributes of sovereignty to larger powers in exchange for benign protection of their political and economic viability against their geographic or demographic constraints."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://ams.hi.is/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Microstates_OccasionalPaper.pdf|title = Microstates as Modern Protected States: Towards a New Definition of Micro-Statehood|last = Dumienski|first = Zbigniew|date = 2014|journal = |accessdate = 06.07.14|doi = |publisher = Centre for Small State Studies|series = Occasional Paper}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with this definition, only [[Andorra]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[San Marino]], and [[Monaco]] qualify as "microstates" as only these states are sovereignties functioning in close, but voluntary, association with their respective larger neighbour(s). [[Luxembourg]], which is much larger than all the European microstates combined, nonetheless shares some of these characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gQFzO_v_uwwC&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Secrets of the Seven Smallest States of Europe: Andorra, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City|first=Thomas M.|last=Eccardt|date=26 October 2017|publisher=Hippocrene Books|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars dispute the status of [[Vatican City]] as a state, arguing that it does not meet the "traditional criteria of statehood" and that the "special status of the Vatican City is probably best regarded as a means of ensuring that the Pope can freely exercise his spiritual functions, and in this respect is loosely analogous to that of the headquarters of international organisations."&lt;ref&gt;Mendelson, M., 1972. Diminutive States in the United Nations. The International and Comparative Law Quarterly, 21(4), pp.609–630.&lt;/ref&gt;

| The Principality of Andorra used to be a [[Feudalism|feudal]] remnant high in the [[Pyrenees]], a [[fiefdom]] held jointly by the [[Bishop of Urgell]] in [[Spain]] and the [[Count of Foix]] in [[France]], with a population of approximately 89,000.  The County of Foix merged into the [[French monarchy|French Crown]] in 1607 and thus the King of France and then the [[President of France]] took the place of the Count of Foix. Since 1993 Andorra has been a parliamentary democracy, but it maintains two Co-Princes, one being France's elected head of state and the other being the Bishop of Urgell. It has been independent since 1278. [[Catalan language|Catalan]] is its official language.

Its population is over 35,000. Owing to its geographic position between [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]], it was not swallowed up during the reorganisation of Germany following the [[French Revolution]], and avoided incorporation into the [[German Empire]] later in the 19th century.

It gained [[State of Malta|independence]] from the [[United Kingdom]] as a [[Commonwealth realm]] in 1964, and became a republic in 1974.  Malta is a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and the only microstate to be a full member of the [[European Union]]. [[Roman Catholicism]] is the official [[state religion]] of Malta.

| The Principality of Monaco on the [[French Riviera]], ruled by the [[House of Grimaldi]] since the 13th century, achieved full independence only following the cession of the surrounding [[County of Nice|Nice]] region from [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont]] to France in 1860.

Monaco is located on the Mediterranean Sea, tucked into the [[Maritime Alps]] and has a population of around 35,000.  Its constitutional monarchy is led by [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco|Prince Albert II]].  The population is 95% Roman Catholic.  French, English, Italian, and [[Monégasque language|Monégasque]] are the most widely spoken languages.  Its economy is based on light manufacturing, banking and financial services, shipping and trade, R&amp;D in biotechnology, marine environments, and tourism.

It is the continuation of a monastic community founded in 301 A.D. and is the last survivor of a large number of self-governing Italian communes from the Middle Ages, having survived the consolidation of Italy into medium-sized territorial states in the 15th century and the [[unification of Italy]] in the 19th century, largely owing to its remote location in a valley of the [[Apennine mountains|Apennine]]s and its decision to offer sanctuary to leaders of the unification movement.

| The State of the [[Vatican City]] is the last remnant of the former [[Papal States]], the lands in central [[Italy]] ruled directly by the [[Pope]].  After the unification of Italy in the 19th century the Papal States had become formally part of the Kingdom of Italy, but the Vatican disputed this claim of geographic authority, and the Papacy continued to exercise ''de facto'' political control over an area around [[St Peter's Basilica]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} in Rome.  A sovereign Vatican state was later established by the [[Lateran Treaty]] of 1929 between the Pope and the government of [[Benito Mussolini]], in which the Pope recognised the Italian state in exchange for establishing [[Roman Catholicism]] as the [[state religion]], and recognition of the Pope's sovereignty over a tiny state located entirely within the city of [[Rome]]. Its population is between 600 and 700.

The [[Holy See]] is a unique sovereign entity under international law distinct from Vatican City with the [[pope]] as the head of both, maintaining diplomatic and official relations with over 170 states and entities and participating in various [[international organization]]s either in its own capacity or on behalf of Vatican City.

==Economic policies and relationship with the European Union==
{{main article|Microstates and the European Union}}
The European microstates are all of limited size and population, and have limited natural resources. As a result, they have adopted special economic policies, typically involving low levels of taxation and few restrictions on external financial investment. Malta is a full member of the [[European Union]], while the other five European microstates have obtained special [[Microstates and the European Union|relations with the European Union]]. Many of the microstates have also entered into a [[customs union]] with their larger neighbours to improve their economic situation (Vatican City and San Marino with [[Italy]], Liechtenstein with [[Switzerland]], Monaco with [[France]]). Most of them lack clearly marked borders; for example, Monaco forms a continuous metropolitan area with its neighboring French communes (the largest being [[Beausoleil, Alpes-Maritimes|Beausoleil]]) and has many streets running across or even along the border.

===Dependencies===
While the microstates have sovereignty over their own territory, there are also a number of small [[autonomous territories]], which despite having (in almost all cases) their own independent government, executive branch, legislature, judiciary, police, and other trappings of independence, are nonetheless under the sovereignty of another [[Sovereign state|state]] or [[monarch]].

===Sovereign Military Order of Malta===
[[File:Flag of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.svg|right|120px|thumb|Flag of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta]]
The [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]]  is a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Catholic religious order|lay order]] that is a traditional example of a sovereign entity under international law other than a state.

Unlike the Holy See, which is sovereign over the Vatican City, the Order has no territory. However, its headquarters, located in [[Palazzo Malta]] and [[Villa del Priorato di Malta|Villa Malta]], are granted [[extraterritoriality]] by Italy, and the same status is recognized by [[Malta]] to its historical headquarters, located in [[Fort St Angelo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.orderofmalta.int/2001/03/13/after-two-centuries-the-order-of-malta-flag-flies-over-fort-st-angelo-beside-the-maltese-flag/ |title=After Two Centuries, The Order Of Malta Flag Flies Over Fort St. Angelo, Beside The Maltese Flag » Sovereign Order Of Malta - Official Site |publisher=Orderofmalta.int |date= |accessdate=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Order is the direct successor to the medieval [[Knights Hospitaller]], also known as the Knights of Malta, and today operates as a largely charitable and ceremonial organization.

It has [[United Nations General Assembly observers|permanent observer status]] at the [[United Nations]] and has full diplomatic relations, including embassies, with 100 states&lt;ref&gt;The Order's official website lists them [https://www.orderofmalta.int/diplomatic-activities/bilateral-relations/ in this table] |date=19 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is in more informal relationships with five others. It issues its own stamps, coins, passports, and license plates, and has its own [[Military of the Sovereign Order of Malta|army medical corps]].

==Historical small territories==
The wars of the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] caused the European map to be redrawn several times. A number of short-lived [[French client republic|client republics]] were created, and the [[Dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire|fall]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] gave sovereignty to each of its many surviving ''[[Kleinstaaterei]]''. The situation was not stabilized until after the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815. Following [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] a number of territories gained temporary status as [[international zone]]s, [[protectorate]]s or occupied territories. A few of them are mentioned here:

==Popular culture and sports==
A 1955 novel called ''[[The Mouse That Roared]]'' by [[Irish-American]] writer [[Leonard Wibberley]] features an imaginary European microstate called the [[Duchy]] of [[Grand Fenwick]].  The novel was later adapted to a play and film.

Some of the European microstates are members of the [[Games of the Small States of Europe]] (GSSE); several of the island dependencies compete in the [[Island Games]], alongside several other island dependencies from elsewhere in the world. Countries that participate at the Games of the Small States of Europe are: Andorra, [[Cyprus]], [[Iceland]], Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, [[Montenegro]] and San Marino.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1468">The '''Geneva Environment Network (GEN)''' is a cooperative partnership of over 75 environment and sustainable development organizations based in the [[Geneva]] area, including [[United Nations]] offices and programmes, local authorities, academic institutions and non-governmental organizations.

Set up in 1999 with the support of the Swiss [[Federal Office for the Environment]], and under the coordination of [[UNEP]] Regional Office for Europe (ROE), the GEN Secretariat is based in the '''International Environment House''' (IEH), which gathers under a common roof a range of United Nations and non-governmental organizations active in the field of environment and sustainable development. GEN actively promotes increased cooperation and networking between its members by organizing and hosting meetings on the environment and sustainable development, such as roundtables and international workshops. During the past ten years, GEN has provided a welcome centre, a single access point to environmental information and knowledge to its members and public at large, and conference services. 

The network members contribute actively to the GEN by sharing information and material, co-organizing and attending events.

'''George Gauld''' (1731&amp;ndash;1782) was a British military engineer, artist, [[cartographer]], [[geographer]] and [[surveying|surveyor]].

==Life==

George Gauld was born in [[Ardbrack]], [[Banffshire]], [[Scotland]], in 1731, and was educated at King's College in [[Aberdeen]], where he received his Master of Arts degree. He became a cartographer and painter, and was on the [[HMS Deptford]] in 1761, same ship that proved [[John Harrison]]'s [[marine chronometer]] to be correct.

Prior to the French and Indian War (Seven Years' War) the British possessed few detailed maps of the interior of North America. The land beyond the Appalachian Mountains had been dominated by the French and their Indian allies. However, British colonial expansion and the military operations led to a flurry of mapping in the form of reconnaissance and route maps, fortification plans, and map depicting engagements. "At the conclusion of the war in 1763, Britain was left in possession of a vast and little known addition to its seaboard colonies. To facilitate the administration and development of Canada and the western territory, topographical surveys were initiated. Notable examples are the [[James Murray (Quebec governor)|James Murray]] survey of the [[St. Lawrence River]] valley (1761–63), the first detailed hydrographic survey of the Ohio River by Harry Gordon and [[Thomas Hutchins]] (1766), [[Philip Pittman]]'s surveys of the Mississippi and [[Iberville River]] (now known as [[Bayou Manchac]]) (1765), and the surveys of East and [[West Florida]] by [[David Taitt]], George Gauld and [[Bernard Romans]] (1772–73)."&lt;ref&gt;Bosse, David. 1989. "Dartmouth on the Mississippi: Speculators and Surveyors in British North America in the Eighteenth Century." ''Imago Mundi''. Volume 41, page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1764 and 1781, George Gauld was assigned by the [[British Admiralty]] to chart the waters off the coast of the British colony of [[West Florida]]. "After Florida came into the possession of Great Britain, the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, sent out Mr George Gauld to make a thorough survey of the whole coast. He was employed in surveying the coasts and harbours of West Florida, and the west coast of [[East Florida]] from the summer of 1764, to the year 1781, when he was made prisoner by the Spaniards, in their invasion of Florida. These surveys were not published until the year 1790, after the death of Mr Gauld.  Much remains to be done by our own government in improving the charts of this dangerous coast. It does not appear precisely at what time."&lt;ref&gt;Sketches, Historical and Topographical, of the Floridas; More Particularly of East Florida by James Grant Forbes; Memoir on the Geography, and Natural and Civil History of Florida, Attended by a Map of That Country, &amp;c. by William Darby. 1821. The North American Review. University of Northern Iowa: Jul. Volume 13, Issue 32, Pages pp. 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

A description of Jamaica mentions Gauld's early work. "Modern charts give only the outline of this area; but there is a particularly interesting chart, "Plan of Port Royal Harbour," by George Gauld, "Surveyor General of the Coast of West Florida," the field work for which was apparently completed in I772, which shows the probable make-up of the Plum Point area at the time. The chart was published in London by W. Faden in I798 and gives the impression of careful work."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/210146.pdf Steers, J. A. 1940. The Cays and the Palisadoes, Port Royal, Jamaica." Geographical Review , Vol. 30, No. 2 (Apr., 1940), pp. 279–296.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1773, Gauld submitted some of his findings to the [[American Philosophical Society]], hoping they would be published in the ''Transactions''. Although his report was not published, it became one of the first submissions entered into the Society's collections. This manuscript also includes a letter from Dr. [[John Lorimer (doctor)|John Lorimer]] to Gauld, and a sketch of the Middle and Yellow Rivers of West Florida by [[Thomas Hutchins]].

In 1774, George Gauld, Dr. [[John Lorimer (doctor)]], [[Thomas Hutchins]], Captain [[Thomas Davey (sailor)|Thomas Davey]], RN, and Major Alexander Dickson of the [[16th Regiment of Foot]], made a mapping expedition from [[Manchac]] to the mouth of the [[Yazoo River]]. Major Dickson went with them for the first part of the survey, and helped them investigate the Manchac region, but evidently left the group at Natchez. Dr. Lorimer made careful measurements of latitude at [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]], and then the remainder of the party continued further north to the mouth of the Yazoo River. Major Dickson was back in [[Pensacola]] by 30 April, although it is unknown if he returned by going up the Manchac to the Iberville River, or south to [[New Orleans]]. He appeared back in Pensacola almost two weeks after the return of the main party that went up further north.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, John D., and Robert Right Rea. 1982. George Gauld, surveyor and cartographer of the Gulf Coast. Pages 161–162.&lt;/ref&gt; They had hoped to be able to find a route up the [[Mississippi River]] without having to go through Spanish controlled New Orleans. The second reason for this map is to show the landholdings of various planters and speculators. Many were speculators, including George Guald and Dr. Lorimer. The land they owned on Thompson's Creek were acquired by Dr. Lorimer and George Gauld in 1772, and then visited by them, perhaps for the first time, during this trip. This cheap land was mostly purchased for speculation, because running the property profitably as a plantation would have been too difficult as absentee landlords from their homes on the Gulf Coast.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, John D., and Robert Right Rea. 1982. George Gauld, surveyor and cartographer of the Gulf Coast. Pages 190–191.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Thomas Hutchins would write an account of this journey, with acknowledgment to the information he had received from George Gauld: “It may be proper to observe that I have had the assistance of the remarks and surveys, so far as relates to the mouths of the Mississippi and the coast and foundings of West Florida, of the late ingenious Mr. George Gauld, a Gentleman who was employed by the Lords of the Admiralty for the express purpose of making an accurate chart of the above mentioned places.”&lt;ref&gt;Hutchins, Thomas. 1784. “An Historical Narrative and Topographical Description of Louisiana and West Florida.” Philadelphia. Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people copied his maps and charts in those days before strict copyright laws. A book by [[William Stork]] reputedly featured a plagiarised copy of a map by Gauld, who later wrote (speaking of himself in the third person):&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jq1bAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:%22George+Gauld%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nfzwTt7RCKfc0QHXidGNAg&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=inauthor%3A%22George%20Gauld%22&amp;f=false Gauld, George. 1790. "An account of the surveys of Florida, &amp;c: with directions for sailing from Jamaica or the West Indies, by the west end of Cuba, and through the Gulph of Florida. To accompany Mr. Gauld's charts." Page 6.]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In the summer of 1765 he made an accurate survey of the Bay of ''Spiritu Santo'', which soon afterwards appeared in Stork's History of East Florida. How it happened to be published there we cannot pretend to say; but it is the only part of the many surreptitious sketches, which have been pirated from Mr. Gauld's works, that has been literally and pretty correctly copied; tho' there is an error of about 30 miles or more in the Latitude.}}

In 1776, Gauld was forced to suspend his work in the [[Dry Tortugas]] and [[Florida Keys]] due to the depredations of American privateers, and he was taken prisoner at the [[Siege of Pensacola]] in 1781. Carried off first to Cuba and then to New York.

==Return to England and Death==

He was later repatriated to Britain, and died shortly afterwards in London.

He is buried at the cemetery of [[Whitefield's Tabernacle, Tottenham Court Road]], London. His memorial, of plain [[Portland stone]], reads: "In memory of George Gauld, A.M. Surveyor of the Coasts of Florida &amp;c. Who was born at [[Ardbrack]] in the parish of [[Botriphny]] (now known as [[Drummuir]]), [[Banffshire]], North Britain; and educated at [[King's College, Aberdeen]]. ''A man of real abilities without affection, a sincere friend without flattery, and religious without hypocrisy or superstition''. He died at London on 8th June 1782, aged 50 years. Psalm XXX verse 37. "''Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright; for the end of that man is peace''."

'''Inagua National Park''' is a [[national park]] on the island of [[Inagua | Great Inagua]] in [[The Bahamas]]. It was established in 1965 and has an area of {{convert|220000|acre|km2|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bnt.bs/inagua-national-park/|title=Inagua National Park|last=|first=|date=|publisher=|work=The Bahamas National Trust|accessdate=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
                                                           
From as far back as 1904 there was rising concern about the West Indian flamingo populations. During the 1960s, the [[Bahamas National Trust]] formed the Inagua National Park, which is where the world's largest breeding colony of [[West Indian flamingo]]es can be found. Forty years ago this flamingo species made a comeback from the brink of extinction to a colony of over 50,000 birds. The park has contributed to increasing bird populations in nearby islands such as [[Mayaguana]], [[Acklins]], [[Crooked Island, Bahamas|Crooked Island]], [[Cuba]], and [[Andros, Bahamas|Andros]]. In 1997 the park was designated a wetland of international importance. It is also known as a bird watchers' paradise as it was designated an Important Bird Area.

The park encloses all of Lake Rosa, the largest salt-water lake in the Bahamas.

A '''hydrographic office''' is an organization which is devoted to acquiring and publishing [[hydrography|hydrographic]] information.

The [[International Hydrographic Organization]] comprises (as of June 2018) 89 Member States, three of these are suspended because of their lapsed annual financial contributions The IHO identifies its representative member organisations as the respective national hydrographic offices, although the member organisations of some countries are part of wider maritime or other administrations covering a larger range of tasks (for example, oceanography, transport, maritime regulation).
In some nations (for example, the UK and France) the hydrographic offices are sub-organisations of the country's Ministry of Defence or the navy, in others they are civilian organisations.

Historically, the main tasks of national hydrographic offices were the acquisition of hydrographic information, including through undertaking [[hydrographic survey]]s, and the subsequent publication of [[nautical chart]]s.

Besides nautical charts, many hydrographic offices publish a body of books and periodicals that are collectively known as [[nautical publications]]. The most important of these are:
*[[Sailing Directions]] (or ''pilots''): detailed descriptions of areas of the sea, shipping routes, [[harbour]]s, aids to navigation, regulations etc.
*[[List of Lights|lists of lights]]: descriptions of lighthouses and lightbouys
*[[tide]] tables and tidal stream atlases
*[[ephemeris|ephemerides]] and [[nautical almanac]]s for [[celestial navigation]]
*[[Notice to Mariners]]: periodical (often weekly) updates and corrections for nautical charts and publications

Hydrographic organizations may also be involved in services such as:
*[[pilotage]]
*[[search and rescue]]
*maintenance of [[lighthouse]]s and other aids to navigation
*[[ice breaking]]
*weather observation and information
*sea traffic information and surveillance
*maritime research
*regulatory affairs of ship safety

==History==
In the development of hydrographic services, shipping organizations played a part, but the major players were the naval powers. Recognizing hydrographic information was a military advantage these naval organizations, usually under the direction of a "Hydrographer" utilized the expertise of naval officers in collecting hydrographic data that was incorporated into the navy's collection. In order to distribute the processed information (charts, directions, notices, and such) these organizations often developed specialized printing capabilities.

==Hydrographic organisations of some countries==

===Argentina===
The [[Argentine Naval Hydrographic Service]] was established in 1879.

===Australia===
{{Main|Australian Hydrographic Service}} {{See also|Australian Pilot}}
Hydrographic tasks in [[Australia]]n waters were performed by the United Kingdom's [[Royal Navy]] since the 19th century. In 1920 the [[Australian Hydrographic Service]] was formed as a part of the [[Royal Australian Navy]].

===Brazil===
Hydrographic tasks in Brazilian waters were performed by the [https://www.marinha.mil.br/dhn/] since 02/02/1876.

===Canada===
Starting in 1883, the "Georgian Bay Survey" was responsible for hydrographic surveying of [[Georgian Bay]] and [[Lake Huron]].  Its geographic area of responsibility increased and in 1904 the name was changed to the "Hydrographic Survey of Canada."  The current name [[Canadian Hydrographic Service]] (CHS) was adopted in 1928.

In 1951, Canada became a State Member of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) and the Hydrographer-General of Canada (formerly known as the Dominion Hydrographer) is Canada's representative.

Today, the mandate of CHS is found in the Canada Oceans Act, the Canada Shipping Act (Charts and Publications Regulations) and the Navigable Waters Protection Act.

With its headquarters office located in Ottawa, Ontario there are regional offices in Sidney (British Columbia), Burlington (Ontario), Mont-Joli (Quebec), Halifax (Nova Scotia), and a branch office in St. John’s Newfoundland.  CHS has 300 staff across the country.

The national chart folio consists of 950 paper charts, 541 S-57 vector Electronic Navigation Charts and 651 raster charts in the BSB format.  CHS produces and maintains seven volumes of Tides and Water Levels books, 25 Sailing Directions books, and prints and distributes a number of publications such as the Annual Notices to Mariners and Radio Aids to Marine Navigation.

In addition to significant hydrographic data holdings (single &amp; multibeam), CHS operates 78 permanent water level stations, a real time water level and forecast system in the St. Lawrence River, and participates in the operation of Atlantic &amp; Pacific tsunami warning systems.

CHS is directly responsible for the sales and distribution of all its products, in paper and digital form.  A network of 850 dealers (domestic and international) distributes CHS paper and digital products.  Products and data are also made available to Value Added Resellers, under licence.

===Chile===
Since 1874, the Navy's Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service ("SHOA", as acronym of [http://www.shoa.cl "Servicio Hidrográfico y Oceanográfico de la Armada"]) has been the [[Chile]]an official authority on drawing and publishing nautical charts of the South Pacific Ocean for Military and Civil navigation.
This institution is also the main authority on controlling the [[hour|official hour]] of the country.

===Denmark===
In [[Denmark]] (including [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]), hydrographic surveying and charting is conducted by "Kort &amp; Matrikelstyrelsen" (KMS), a division of the Ministry of Environment.

===France===
{{Main|Naval Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service}}
In [[France]], the first official organization, the French Dépôt des Cartes, Plans, Journaux et Mémoires Relatifs à la Navigation, was formed in 1720.

Today, the [[SHOM]] is the official French hydrographic office, it stands for 'Service Hydrographique et Océanographique de la Marine' and means [[Naval Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service]].

===Germany===
The "[[Bundesamt für Seeschiffahrt und Hydrographie]]" (BSH) is the [[Germany|German]] federal hydrographic office. Its offices are located in [[Hamburg]] and [[Rostock]]. The BSH is responsible for a wide variety of services, among them hydrographic surveys, nautical publications, ship registration, testing and approval of technical equipment, [[oceanography|oceanographic]] research, development of nautical information systems, and maritime pollution surveillance. The BSH runs six ships for survey and research purposes.

In 1945 the tasks of various predecessor organisations (among them the German Navy's hydrographic service, the [[Wilhelmshaven]] maritime observatory, and the "Deutsche Seewarte" under [[Georg von Neumayer]]) were concentrated in the newly created "Deutsches Hydrographisches Institut" (DHI) in Hamburg. In 1990 the DHI and the corresponding [[East Germany|East German]] organisation, the "Seehydrographische Dienst der DDR" in Rostock were integrated to form the BSH in its present form.

===Greece===

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20110709095234/http://www.hnhs.gr/portal/page/portal/HNHS Hellenic Navy Hydrographic Service] (HNHS, {{lang-el|Υδρογραφική Υπηρεσία Πολεμικού Ναυτικού}}), an independent service of the [[Hellenic Navy]] General Staff, is responsible for hydrographic surveying and production and sale of charts. The first naval hydrographic office was created in 1905 and its first mission was the hydrographic survey of Maliakos Gulf. Its first nautical chart was issued in 1909 and in 1919 the Hellenic Navy became a founding member of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO). The hydrographic office evolved into the independent naval Hydrographic Service in 1921. Today the HNHS operates three naval hydrographic vessels: ''HS OS Nautilos'' (A-478), ''HS OS Pytheas'' (A-474) and ''HS Stravon'' (A-476).

===Hong Kong ===
The [http://www.hydro.gov.hk Hong Kong Hydrographic Office] is responsible for hydrographic surveying and production of nautical charts covering the waters of Hong Kong.  It also produced electronic navigational charts and made available the prediction of tidal stream digitally *[https://web.archive.org/web/20050920101756/http://www.hydro.gov.hk/tidal/district.htm] on the internet.

===India===
{{main|National Hydrographic Office}}
The Indian Naval Hydro-graphic Department (INHD) headed by Chief Hydrographer to the Government of India is an Indian Government agency responsible for hydro-graphic surveys and nautical charting in India. It operates a fleet of eight oceangoing conventional hull survey vessels and one large catamaran hull vessel [[INS Makar (J31)]] of the [[Alcock Ashdown survey catamaran|Alcock Ashdown Class]], with five more of the class due to be commissioned soon.

The Indian Marine Survey Department was established at [[Calcutta]] in 1874, which became a part of the [[Royal Indian Navy|Royal Indian Marine]] in 1882. The Hydrographic Department of the Indian Navy derives its origin from the charting activities of the [[British East India Company]], way back in the 17th century. John and Samuel Thornton, Hydrographers to the East India Company compiled the first chart and Sailing Directions for the Indian Ocean in 1703. During the next two centuries, the captains of the ships of the East India Company went on to pioneer the charting of the Eastern seas extending from Red Sea to Persian Gulf, Arabian Sea, across the Indian Ocean right up to the China Seas.

After India{{'}}s independence from the [[United Kingdom]], the Marine Survey Office was shifted to [[Dehradun]] on 1 June 1954 and was renamed as the Naval Hydrographic Office. The Naval Hydrographic Office was renamed in 1997 as the National Hydrographic Office in recognition of its national stature and increasing international role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hydrobharat.nic.in/brief_history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222024712/http://www.hydrobharat.nic.in/brief_history.htm |archivedate=22 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://indiannavy.nic.in/book/naval-hydrographic-department&lt;/ref&gt;

Total mapping coverage of the INSS to end of 2005 was 432,000&amp;nbsp;km² and taken along with an earlier DCENR Petroleum Affairs Division, over 81% of the Irish designated seabed area (at end 2005) has been mapped. The INtegrated Mapping FOr the Sustainable Development of Ireland’s MArine Resource (INFOMAR) programme is a successor to the Irish National Seabed Survey (INSS) and concentrates on creating a range of integrated mapping products of the physical, chemical and biological features of the seabed in the near-shore area. The programme is being funded by the Irish Government through the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources as part of the National Development Plan, 2007 – 2013 [11]. Data are passed on to the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office (UKHO) for subsequent production of nautical charts.

===Russia===
{{main|Russian Hydrographic Service}}
The Russian Hydrographic Office was founded in 1777 by the [[Admiralty Board (Russian Empire)|Admiralty Board]] of the [[Russian Empire]]. The hydrographic service in [[Russia]] has been historically attached to the [[Russian Navy]] and the agents and supervisors of hydrographic works have been largely naval officers since it was established. Having operated under different names along its history, the Russian Hydrographic Service is one of the first hydrographic offices in the world.&lt;ref&gt;С этой чертежной началось централизованное производство морских карт в России, а дата утверждения штата чертежной — 2 (13) ноября 1777 г. — является датой основания ныне существующего Центрального картографического производства Военно-Морского Флота.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
"Sjöfartsverket", Swedish Maritime Administration, includes the [[Sweden|Swedish]] national hydrographic organisation. Established in 1956 and governed by the Ministry of Industry, Employment and Communications, Sjöfartsverket is responsible for most aspects of safe navigation in Sweden. This includes maintenance and marking of fairways, surveying and charting Swedish waters, pilotage, search-and-rescue (in cooperation with other organisations), ice-breaking, and safety inspections.

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|United Kingdom Hydrographic Office}}
The [[United Kingdom]] has a long hydrographic history officially begun with the 1683 appointment of Captain [[Greenville Collins|Grenville Collins]] as Hydrographer to the King.&lt;ref Name=rnhis&gt;http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Tech-HydrographicSurvey.htm | HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEY WORK IN THE ROYAL NAVY UP TO THE 1980s by Geoffrey B Mason, Lieutenant Commander, RN (Rtd)&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Royal Navy]] dominating the seas  hydrography grew to a worldwide hydrographic activity. Royal Navy charts and the related surveys were reputedly officially started as a result of the loss of [[Admiral]] [[Cloudesley Shovell|Sir Cloudesley Shovell]] on an uncharted [[reef]] off the [[Isles of Scilly|Scilly Isles]] which happened in October 1707 (see main article [[Scilly naval disaster of 1707]]). The office of [[Hydrographer of the Navy]] was created in 1795. 
The British tradition of hydrographic surveys extended to the nations with a common legacy in the Empire, for example, the [[Australian Hydrographic Service]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hydro.gov.au/aboutus/past.htm{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} | Australian Hydrographic Service - The Past&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Admiralty Hydrographic Office]] ceased to be a naval department and became the [[United Kingdom Hydrographic Office]] (located in [[Taunton, Somerset]], near Creechbarrow hill) which continues the legacy within the Ministry of Defence&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ukho.gov.uk/AboutUs/Pages/Corporate.aspx | UKHO - About Us&lt;/ref&gt; with responsibility for the Admiralty Charts&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ukho.gov.uk/PRODUCTSANDSERVICES/Pages/ChartAvailabilityList.aspx | UKHO - Admiralty Chart Availability List&lt;/ref&gt; covering almost every navigable stretch of water on Earth. The UKHO also calculates tide tables for the UK. The Royal Navy maintains a number of hydrographic survey vessels &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/operations-and-support/surface-fleet/hydrographic-vessels/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025194533/http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/operations-and-support/surface-fleet/hydrographic-vessels/ |archivedate=25 October 2010 |df= }} | Royal Navy - Hydrographic Vessels&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the US government, all of whose creative work is placed into the public domain, British government policy requires agencies such as the UKHO and the [[Ordnance Survey]] to be self-funding through the sale of the information they create. The Hydrographic Office therefore actively protects the copyright of all of its data including paper charts, electronic charts, tidal data and other data and has been known to take measures to ensure that its copyrighted information is used appropriately.

In 2013 the UKHO added an important new service for users of its paper charts by allowing its authorized agents to [[Print on Demand]] most paper charts.

UKHO attracted worldwide attention in February 2005 when it published in-depth pictures of the [[ocean floor]] in the vicinity of the Indian Ocean [[tsunami]] disaster of 26 December 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukho.gov.uk/content/corpAttachments/press_releases/Tsunami.pdf |format=PDF |title=Press release, 9th January 2005 |publisher=UKHO |work=www.ukho.gov.uk |accessdate=2006-11-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928061318/http://www.ukho.gov.uk/content/corpAttachments/press_releases/Tsunami.pdf |archivedate=28 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Atlantic Ocean]] --&gt;
In the [[United States]], the Survey of the Coast (America's first scientific agency) was established through an 1807 Congressional resolution and signed into law by [[Thomas Jefferson|President Jefferson]].  It subsequently became the [[U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey]] in 1878, and incorporated the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Corps|Coast and Geodetic Survey Corp]] in 1917.  (Surveyors who were commissioned officers could not be shot as spies if captured during time of war.)  The [[U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey]] was eventually incorporated into the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) when it was formed in 1970. NOAA's [[Office of Coast Survey]] is the national Hydrographic Office of the [[United States]].

Non-domestic hydrographic and bathymetric surveys are conducted by the U.S. [[Naval Oceanographic Office]], which started with the establishment of the Depot of Charts and Instruments in 1830 that by 1854 was designated the U.S. Naval Observatory and Hydrographical Office. The hydrographic portion became the [[U.S. Naval Hydrographic Office]] under the Hydrographer of the Navy, appointed from uniformed personnel from 1870 through 1961. With the popularization of oceanography in the early 1960s (partly due to President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s interest), the name was changed to the U.S. [[Naval Oceanographic Office]] in 1962. That office, as a matter of historical and semantic interest, and the U.S. Naval Observatory are still part of the command overseen by the "Oceanographer of the Navy," with headquarters at the Naval Observatory. In 2001, the position of "Hydographer of the Navy" was re-established.&lt;ref name="hydro"&gt;[http://www.hydro-international.com/issues/articles/id238-US_Navy_Hydrography_Is_Back.html "US Navy Hydrography Is Back!"], ''Hydro International'', May 2002, Volume 6, Number 4, accessed 31 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====

{{main|National Geodetic Survey}}

In 1807, the United States created the [[United States Survey of the Coast]], the first [[United States Government]] scientific agency, giving it the responsibility for hydrographic surveys of the waters of the United States. Its surveying activities did not begin until 1816 and then were suspended completely when the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Navy]] were given the responsibility for surveys in 1818. Surveying responsibility returned to the Survey of the Coast in 1832, and it conducted the first official hydrographic survey in U.S. history in 1834. It was renamed the [[United States Coast Survey]] in 1836.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lib.noaa.gov/noaainfo/heritage/coastsurveyvol1/CONTENTS.html# |title=NOAA History: The Coast Survey 1807-1867 |access-date=2 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628110735/http://www.lib.noaa.gov/noaainfo/heritage/coastsurveyvol1/CONTENTS.html# |archive-date=28 June 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the Coast Survey accumulated a small fleet of ships to employ in surveying work. In 1871, the Coast Survey was given the responsibility of conducting [[Geodesy|geodetic]] surveys in the interior of the United States, and in 1878 it was renamed the [[United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]]. In 1959, the Coast and Geodetic Survey was given the responsibility for U.S. Government hydrographic surveying activities worldwide.&lt;ref name="noaahistoryuscgs"&gt;[http://www.history.noaa.gov/legacy/corps.html NOAA History: NOAA Corps and the Coast and Geodetic Survey]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, the Coast and Geodetic Survey was subordinated to the new [[Environmental Science Services Administration]] (ESSA), although it retained its separate identity. On 3 October 1970, ESSA was expanded and reorganized to become the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), and at that time a number of U.S. Government scientific agencies, including the Coast and Geodetic Survey, merged and were reorganized to form NOAA. Among other things, NOAA took over the Coast and Geodetic Survey{{'}}s responsibility for hydrographic surveys, and the Coast and Geodetic Survey{{'}}s fleet merged with those of other U.S. government agencies to form the NOAA fleet, which includes [[survey ship]]s that carry out hydrographic surveys.&lt;ref name="noaahistoryuscgs"/&gt;
In the United States, statutory authority for hydrographic surveys of [[territorial waters]] and the [[exclusive economic zone]] (EEZ) lies with the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA).&lt;ref Name=nhsptxt&gt;http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/hsd/docs/NHSP_2009_TextOnly.pdf | NOAA Hydrographic Survey Priorities 2009 Edition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/hsd/NHSP.htm | NOAA Hydrographic Survey Priorities&lt;/ref&gt; NOAA hydrographic surveys are administered by the [[National Ocean Service]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/hsd/hydrog.htm | NOS - Hydrographic Surveying&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/about/nos_org_chart.pdf | National Ocean Service Organization Chart&lt;/ref&gt; and carried out by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Corps]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.careers.noaa.gov/career_fields.html | WELCOME TO NOAA CAREERS&lt;/ref&gt; and federal government civilians.

The NOAA Office of Coast Survey{{'}}s Hydrographic Surveys Division estimates it has awarded approximately $250 million in contracts for hydrographic surveying and related support since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/hsd/contrac.htm | Office of Coast Survey, Contract Hydrographic Surveys&lt;/ref&gt;

====Today====

For inland surface waters such as rivers, streams, and inland lakes the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) has national responsibility. USGS coordinates [[survey data collection]] and publishes the [[National Hydrography Dataset]]&lt;ref&gt;http://nhd.usgs.gov/ | National Hydrography Dataset&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2009/3054/ | The National Map—Hydrography&lt;/ref&gt; that is designed to be used with [[geographic information systems]] (GIS).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="97798">'''Lists of foods named after places''' have been compiled by writers, sometimes on travel websites or food-oriented websites, as well as in books.

Since all of these names are words derived from place names, they are all [[toponymy|toponyms]]. This article covers English language food toponyms which may have originated in English or other languages.

According to Delish.com, "[T]here's a rich history of naming foods after cities, towns, countries, and even the moon."&lt;ref name=delish1&gt;Web page titled [http://www.delish.com/food-fun/foods-named-after-places#fbIndex1 "On the Map: Why Some Foods Are Named After Places"], retrieved August 30, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The following foods and drinks were named after places. Each non-obvious etymology is supported by a reference on the linked Wikipedia page. Food names are listed by country of the origin of the word, not necessarily where the food originated or was thought to have originated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8361">This is a list of the '''mammal species recorded in Saint Helena'''. These are the mammal species in [[Saint Helena]], of which 0 are critically endangered, 0 are endangered, 1 is vulnerable, and 0 are near-threatened.&lt;ref&gt;This list is derived from the [[IUCN Red List]] which lists species of mammals and includes those mammals that have recently been classified as extinct (since 1500 AD). The taxonomy and naming of the individual species is based on those used in existing Wikipedia articles as of 21 May 2007 and supplemented by the common names and taxonomy from the IUCN, Smithsonian Institution, or University of Michigan where no Wikipedia article was available.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The following tags are used to highlight each species' conservation status as assessed by the [[World Conservation Union|IUCN]]:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
| EX ||'''Extinct'''|| No reasonable doubt that the last individual has died.
|-
| EW ||'''Extinct in the wild'''|| Known only to survive in captivity or as a naturalized populations well outside its previous range.
|-
| CR ||'''Critically Endangered'''|| The species is in imminent risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| EN ||'''Endangered'''|| The species is facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| VU ||'''Vulnerable'''|| The species is facing a high risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| NT ||'''Near Threatened'''|| The species does not meet any of the criteria that would categorise it as risking extinction but it is likely to do so in the future.
|-
| LC ||'''Least Concern'''|| There are no current identifiable risks to the species.
|-
| DD ||'''Data Deficient'''|| There is inadequate information to make an assessment of the risks to this species.
|}

Some species were assessed using an earlier set of criteria. Species assessed using this system have the following instead of Near Threatened and Least Concern categories:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
| LR/cd || '''Lower Risk/conservation dependent''' || Species which were the focus of conservation programmes and may have moved into a higher risk category if that programme was discontinued.
|-
| LR/nt || '''Lower Risk/near threatened''' || Species which are close to being classified as Vulnerable but are not the subject of conservation programmes.
|-
| LR/lc || '''Lower Risk/least concern''' || Species for which there are no identifiable risks.
|}

{{otheruses}}
The terms '''''location''''' and '''''place''''' in [[geography]] are used to identify a [[point (spatial)|point]] or an area on the [[Earth]]'s surface or elsewhere. The term ''location'' generally implies a higher degree of certainty than ''place'', the latter often indicating an entity with an ambiguous boundary, relying more on human or social attributes of [[place identity]] and [[sense of place]] than on [[geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Simandan |first=Dragos |date=April 2011 |title=Making sense of place through multiple memory systems|journal=New Zealand Geographer |volume=67 |issue=1 |pages=21–24 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-7939.2011.01194.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of location and place==
===Relative location===
A relative location, or situation, is described as a displacement from another site. An example is "3 miles northwest of [[Seattle]]".

===Locality===
A [[locality (settlement)|location,]] settlement, or populated place is likely to have a well-defined name but a boundary which is not well defined in varies by context. [[London]], for instance, has a legal boundary, but this is unlikely to completely match with general usage. An area within a town, such as [[Covent Garden]] in London, also almost always has some ambiguity as to its extent.

===Absolute location===
An absolute location is designated using a specific pairing of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] in a [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinate]] grid — for example, a [[Spherical coordinate system]] or an ellipsoid-based system such as the [[World Geodetic System]] — or similar methods. For instance, the position of [[Lake Maracaibo]] in Venezuela can be expressed approximately in the [[WGS84]] coordinate system as the location 9.80°N (latitude), 71.56°W (longitude). It is, however, just one way. Alternative ways can be seen in this Geo Hack link: {{Coord|9.80|N|71.56|W|type:waterbody_region:VE}}.

''Absolute location'', however, is a term with little real meaning, since any location must be expressed relative to something else. For example, longitude is the number of degrees east or west of the [[Prime meridian (Greenwich)|Prime Meridian]], a line arbitrarily chosen to pass through [[Greenwich, London]].  Similarly, latitude is the number of degrees north or south of the [[Equator]]. Because latitude and longitude are expressed ''relative'' to these lines, a position expressed in latitude and longitude is actually a relative location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gersmehl |first=Philip |date=2008 |title=Teaching Geography |edition=2nd |location=New York |publisher=[[Guilford Press]] |pages=60 |isbn=978-1-59385-715-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''M3''' is a [[motorway]] that runs from [[Sunbury-on-Thames]], [[Surrey]], to [[Southampton]], [[Hampshire]], a distance of approximately {{convert|59|mi|km|0}}.  Via its feeder the [[A316 road|A316]], the route is one of five roads of dual carriageway width or greater into the southern half of [[London]]. It also provides access to major towns and cities along its route, principally the [[Aldershot Urban Area]], [[Basingstoke]], [[Winchester]] and [[Southampton]]. 

It was constructed as a dual three-lane motorway except for its two-lane section between Junctions 8 ([[A303 road|A303]]) and 9. The motorway was opened in phases, ranging from [[Lightwater]]/[[Bagshot]] to [[Popham, Hampshire|Popham]] in 1971 to Winchester to [[Otterbourne]] Hill in 1995. The latter stages attracted opposition from environmental campaigns across Britain due to its large [[cutting (transportation)|cutting]] through wooded [[Twyford Down]]; numerous [[Road protest in the United Kingdom#1979.E2.80.931997|road protests]] were held which delayed its opening. Similar protests were avoided on the near-parallel [[A3 road|A3]] by construction of the [[Hindhead Tunnel]]. Since completion, the motorway has been an artery to the west and mid sections of the [[Southern England|South Coast]] and [[Isle of Wight]] including for tourism. The major settlements nearest to the motorway are served by a railway also used for [[London commuter belt|commuting]] but are relatively [[dispersed settlement|dispersed]]. Traffic on the M3 sees delays and congestion on its busiest sections near commuting hotspots and during holiday periods. From [[Chertsey]] to [[Fleet, Hampshire|Fleet]] the road was in 2017 upgraded to a [[Managed motorways in the United Kingdom|Smart Motorway]], turning the hard shoulder into a permanent fourth lane with emergency refuge lay-bys. &lt;Ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/m3-gets-first-orange-smart-motorway-emergency-area|title=M3 gets first 'orange' smart motorway emergency area}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally approved as the "London to Basingstoke Motorway" with delays over funding for an extension to Southampton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1967/jun/21/the-m3-motorway|title=The M.3 Motorway|publisher=Hansard|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; the road was built to relieve two single carriageway trunk roads that were congested.{{#tag:ref|*The [[A30 road|A30]] eastern stretch to the [[A303 road]]&lt;br&gt;*The Winchester to Southampton traditional road, the [[A33 road|A33]]|group= n}}&lt;ref name=lordshepherd/&gt;

In 1967, sections of the [[A33 road]] from Popham, Hampshire, to a northeastern point of the Winchester Bypass were widened to dual carriageways; this only partially alleviated growing congestion, especially in [[Winchester]], which led to the southern phase gaining approval.{{#tag:ref|Of the [[A34 road (England)|A34 trunk road]] from [[Bicester]] on the M40 to [[Southampton]]|group= n}}&lt;ref name=lordshepherd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1967/jun/21/the-m3-motorway|title=The M.3 Motorway|publisher=Hansard|year=1967}} Oral Questions in the [[House of Lords]] 21 June 1967 vol 283 cc1385-7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern section===
The eastern section, from [[Sunbury-on-Thames]] in [[Surrey]] to Popham near [[Basingstoke]] opened in sections: first the [[Hampshire]] section in 1971, and then the [[Surrey]] section in 1974.&lt;ref name=DfT6363&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/6363.aspx|title=M3 London to Southampton Route Management Strategy|publisher=Department for Transport|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930201532/http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/6363.aspx|archivedate=30 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cost for this first phase was £46m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1988/jan/11/m3-sunbury-popham|title=M3 (Sunbury-Popham)|publisher=Hansard|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; The completed road acts as a continuation of the [[A316 road|A316 Country Way]], an express three-lane road from Apex Corner, [[Hanworth]], in [[Greater London]] to [[Sunbury-on-Thames]].  

The section is one of five routes into the southern half of London which reach Inner London with at least a dual-carriageway of dual-direction road, the others being the [[A3 road|A3 (M)]], the [[A30 road (Great Britain)|A30/A4]], the [[M20 motorway|M20]] and [[A2 road (Great Britain)|A2]], however approximately one mile before reaching Inner London is combined with the routes of the A30 and M4 approaches.

===Southern section===
A first public inquiry for the "M3 London to Basingstoke Motorway: Popham to [[Compton and Shawford|Compton]] extension" centred on the section passing [[Winchester]], and was held in 1971, after which the ministry was instructed to reconsider and reconsult on the proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATID=8280346&amp;CATLN=6&amp;accessmethod=5|title=M3 London to Basingstoke Motorway: Popham to Compton public inquiry|publisher=National Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=iht1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m3londsouth.htm|title=M3.

The scope of the M3 extension was reduced to defer the difficult decision about the section around Winchester and it was built in two sections (from 'Popham to Bridget's Farm' and from 'Bridget's Farm to Bar End') in 1995.&lt;ref name=DfT6363/&gt; When this opened, the temporary junction to the A33 parallel route was removed.

The section of the M3 from near Junction 12 ([[Eastleigh]] and [[Chandler's Ford]]) to the last, Junction 14 for the [[M27 motorway|M27]] replaced part of the [[A33 road]] which was upgraded to motorway standard and opened in 1991.&lt;ref name=iht1/&gt;

In 2008 the busiest section of the motorway, at [[Chandler's Ford]], carried a daily average of around 130,000 vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Annual Average Daily Traffic Flows|publisher=Department for Transport|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/matrix/Default.aspx |accessdate=28 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The southern section starts as a continuation of a single-lane avenue, Bassett Avenue and The Avenue in the [[City of Southampton]] as the [[M27 motorway]] provides alternative routes from other parts of the city, particularly its waterfront and downtown peak-hour accessway, the [[M271 motorway]] and Mountbatten Way providing dual to three lane highways starting at the northwest of the city.

===Abandoned/suspended proposals===
Its service station was envisaged at [[Basingstoke]] upon the motorway's completion but not built – superseded by one just north of [[Fleet, Hampshire|Fleet]] and another north of Winchester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motorwayservicesonline.co.uk/Basingstoke |title=Basingstoke |publisher=Motorway Services Online |date= |accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Plans for a Basingstoke Services were again published in November 2017 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.basingstokegazette.co.uk/news/15654729.plan-for-new-m3-service-station-including-100-room-hotel-at-basingstoke/ |title=New Basingstoke Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additions===
An additional junction, numbered 4A, opened in April 1992 for [[Fleet, Hampshire|Fleet]].&lt;ref name="harms"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/6363.aspx|title=Highways Agency: M3 London to Southampton Route Management Strategy|publisher=Highways Agency|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930201532/http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/6363.aspx|archivedate=30 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detailed route==
The M3 starts at Sunbury-on-Thames in [[Surrey]] on the edge of South West London as the continuation of the [[A316 road|A316]] which has three lanes each way from [[Hanworth]] in the [[London Borough of Hounslow]], and two from [[Chiswick]]. The motorway {{convert|2|mi}} after its start turns more [[boxing the compass|west-southwest]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://gridreferencefinder.com/ Grid Reference Finder] distance tools&lt;/ref&gt; crosses the [[River Thames]] on the [[M3 Chertsey Bridge]] to the north of [[Chertsey]] and then has its second junction, at the [[M25 motorway]], before continuing through the gorse, bogs and heather of the [[Surrey Heath]].  Its third junction is for [[Camberley]], [[Bagshot]], [[Bracknell]], [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]] and [[Worplesdon]].  From Junction 4 it bisects the northern [[Blackwater Valley conurbation]]{{#tag:ref|Main settlements: [[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough]], [[Aldershot]], [[Camberley]], [[Frimley]], [[Farnham, Surrey|Farnham]] and [[Sandhurst, Berkshire|Sandhurst]]|group= n}} then has its latest junction for [[Fleet, Hampshire|Fleet]] and nearby early 21st century expanded/new villages{{#tag:ref|Examples include [[Elvetham Heath]]|group= n}}, it crosses the [[South West Main Line]], before skirting [[Old Basing]] and [[Basingstoke]] to its north{{#tag:ref|Here the M3 passes close to the [[Basingstoke Canal]]|group= n}}. Turning south west again, it passes Popham and, just before reaching Junction 8, where one lane becomes the [[A303 road]], the motorway continues as a dual two lane road through open [[countryside]] and [[Micheldever|Micheldever Wood]] until it reaches the north of [[Winchester, England|Winchester]].

Taking over the  "Winchester Bypass" the M3 resumes to three lanes each way at Junction 9, continues directly south and then takes a small curve around the east of the city running through a deep cutting in [[Twyford Down]] and then proceeding south west again, crossing the [[South West Main Line]] a second time alongside the [[River Itchen, Hampshire|River Itchen]] and through the Eastleigh [[urban area|urban]]-suburban area before crossing the [[Eastleigh to Romsey Line|Eastleigh to Romsey railway line]] and ending at the Chilworth Roundabout on the edge of Southampton.

===Road features===
*The '''Spitfire Bridge''' carries the B3404 Alresford Road to Winchester over the M3 motorway and the parallel A272 (J9-J10 spur).  This is known as the "Spitfire Link". It replaced a concrete [[parabolic arch]] bridge under which a [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|Curtiss P-40]] had been flown by George Rogers in October 1941. It was generally assumed locally that the aircraft had been a Spitfire hence the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Incidents==
*In the early morning of 25 April 1999, the drum and bass DJ and record producer known as [[Kemistry]] was killed on the M3 near Winchester by the steel body of a [[cat's eye (road)|cat's eye]], which had been dislodged by a van and flew through the windscreen of the following car in which she was a passenger.

*On September 23, 2017 two firebombs were thrown from a bridge onto the motorway between junctions 9 and 11 by mentally ill teenager Nicholas Elger leading to an 11-hour closure costing an estimated 40 million pounds. The attacker was identified after being linked to a bottle of [[Voss water]] used to transport the fuel.

'''Metes and bounds''' is a system or method of describing land, [[real property]] (in contrast to [[personal property]]) or [[real estate]].&lt;ref name="Ohio"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Galaty|first1=Fillmore W.|last2=Allaway|first2=Wellington J.|last3=Kyle|first3=Robert C.|title=Modern Real Estate Practice in Ohio|date=2017|publisher=Dearborn Real Estate Education|location=U.S.|isbn=978-1-4754-3375-3|page=90|edition=9th|url=https://portal.recampus.com/re/dearbornbookstore/store/portalcheckout/browse/RE_WHOLESALE_BKSTORE/201996?pagenum=9&amp;rowCount=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--This preceding ref. only refers to real estate--&gt; Newer systems include rectangular (government survey), lot and block (recorded plat) and [[Torrens title|Torrens]] (used in [[Hawaii]], [[ California ]], [[Colorado]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Canada]]).&lt;ref name="Ohio"/&gt;  The system has been used in [[England]] for many centuries, and is still used there in the definition of general boundaries. The system is also used in the Canadian province of [[Ontario]]. &lt;ref&gt; O. Reg. 43/96 https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/960043 &lt;/ref&gt; By custom, it was applied in the original [[Thirteen Colonies]] that became the [[United States]], and in many other land jurisdictions based on [[English law|English]] [[common law]].&lt;ref&gt;Cribbet, Johnson, Findley, and Smith. Property, Cases and Materials, (8th ed 2002, Foundation Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically the system uses physical features of the local [[geography]], along with directions and distances, to define and describe the boundaries of a parcel of land. The boundaries are described in a running prose style, working around the parcel in sequence, from a [[point of beginning]], returning to the same point; compare with the oral ritual of [[beating the bounds]]. It may include references to other adjoining parcels (and their owners), and it, in turn, could also be referred to in later surveys. At the time the description is compiled, it may have been marked on the ground with permanent monuments placed where there were no suitable natural monuments.
Surveying has been a subjective process open to interpretation by the person or persons producing the document as well as open discussion to the persons abiding by the document. The variables that originally defined the "bounds" need to be converted to metes by more modern methods. Today the word "art" is being used when discussing surveying as in Surveying is an "Art" leaving much to surveyor opinion to "update" the existing deed. In most areas, urban deeds have defined the boundary lines sufficiently to buy and sell land with sufficient clarity however as one moves further into larger parcels the subjectivity grows.     

* '''Metes.'''  The term "metes" refers to a boundary defined by the measurement of each straight run, specified by a distance between the terminal points, and an orientation or direction. A direction may be a simple compass bearing, or a precise orientation determined by accurate survey methods.
* '''Bounds.'''  The term "bounds" refers to a more general boundary description, such as along a certain watercourse, a stone wall, an adjoining public [[road]] way, or an existing building.  The system is often used to define larger pieces of property (e.g. farms), and political subdivisions (e.g. town boundaries) where precise definition is not required or would be far too expensive, or previously designated boundaries can be incorporated into the description.

== Usage ==
A typical description for a small parcel of land would be: "beginning with a corner at the intersection of two stone walls near an apple tree on the north side of Muddy Creek road one mile above the junction of Muddy and Indian Creeks, north for 150 rods to the end of the stone wall bordering the road, then northwest along a line to a large standing rock on the corner of the property now or formerly belonging to John Smith, thence west 150 rods to the corner of a barn near a large oak tree, thence south to Muddy Creek road, thence down the side of the creek road to the starting point."

The sequence begins with an identified corner serving as benchmark.  The description then gives distance, direction and various boundary descriptions as if one were walking the bounds pacing off the distance to the next corner where there is a change of direction. Where watercourses form part of the bounds their meander is generally taken as a straight line between the established corners and their monuments.

In many deeds, the direction is described not by azimuth (a clockwise degree measure out of 360 degrees), but instead by bearing (a direction north or south followed by a degree measure out of 90 degrees and another direction west or east). For example, such a bearing might be listed as "N 42°35' W", which means that the bearing is 42°35' counterclockwise, or west of north.

This has the advantage of providing the same degree measure regardless of which direction a particular boundary is being followed; the boundary can be traversed in the opposite direction simply by exchanging N for S and E for W. In other words, "N 42°35' W" describes the same boundary as "S 42°35' E", but is traversed in the opposite direction.

In most distance measures, especially those in older deeds and where measuring distances over a furlong, boundary lengths are listed in [[rod (unit)|rods]] or poles instead of feet or meters. Rods and poles are equivalent measures equaling 16.5 [[foot (length)|feet]]. There are four rods in one chain. The old English surveyors actually carried chains 66 feet in length with which to measure lengths, as well as poles 16.5 feet long, and many older legal descriptions of real estate in the United States are given in chains and poles.

== Resolving inconsistencies ==
Some courts have established a list of priorities to resolve inconsistent descriptions of corners. In descending order starting with the most reliable: (1) natural monuments, (2) artificial monuments such as roads and marked or surveyed lines, (3) adjacent tracts or boundaries, (4) courses or directions, (5) distances, and (6) area or quantity.&lt;ref&gt;Stoebuck &amp; Whitman, The Law of Property 827 (3d ed. 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Difficulties ==
Once such a survey is in place, the corners may have to depend on tradition and long use to establish the line along the boundaries between them. In some areas where land was deeded before 1593 the lengths given predate the changes to the length of the [[furlong]] and [[mile]] by [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]. In other places references to the official borders of towns, counties, states and even the U.S. may have changed. Compass directions always have to be tied to a table of annual deflections because magnetic north is constantly changing. The description might refer to ''landmarks'' such as the ''large oak tree'' which could die, rot and disappear; or be confused with a different tree that had grown over time. Streams might dry up, meander or change course. Man-made features such as roads, walls, markers or stakes used to mark corners and determine the line of the boundaries between corners may have been moved. As these features move, change and disappear over time, when it comes time to re-establish the corners along the line of these boundaries (for sale, subdivision, or building construction) it can become difficult, even impossible, to determine the original location of the corner. In the metes and bounds system, corners, distance, direction, monuments and bounds are always carried back to the original intent regardless of where they are now. Court cases are sometimes required to settle the matter when it is suspected the corner markers may have been moved.

These kinds of problems caused the [[United States]] to largely replace this system except in the east. Beginning with the [[Land Ordinance of 1785]], it began a transition to the [[Public Land Survey System]] (PLSS) used in the central and western states. The eastern, or original states, continue to use the metes and bounds surveys of their founders.

==History of use in the United States ==
This system was imported to the original colonies that formed the United States. It is also used in some states that were previously part of one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]], or where land was allocated before 1785. These include [[West Virginia]], [[Kentucky]], [[Maine]], [[Tennessee]] and [[Vermont]]. Because [[Texas]] was an [[Republic of Texas|independent republic]] prior to statehood, its land system is primarily metes and bounds.

Election constituency boundaries continue to be described by the use of metes and bounds, even in jurisdictions where land [[plat]]s are not otherwise based upon metes and bounds. Such mapping generally uses streets and their intersections to define the boundaries of election districts, wards, precincts, ''inter alia''. ''E.g.'': "From the intersection of Main Street and John Doe Boulevard, thence north to ABC Drive, thence generally east along the median of ABC Drive to 123rd Street, thence..."

== Use of the term in patent law ==
In patent law, an application provides background and disclosure necessary to describe an invention, but it is the [[claim (patent)|claim]]s that define the protected aspects.  It is therefore said that the claims set out the metes and bounds (see, e.g. in [[United States patent law]], [[Manual of Patent Examining Procedure]] § 2173.05(a)) for the protected invention.  As a deed might describe a parcel of land, a patent claim carves out systems, methods, etc. that are [[patent infringement|infringed]] by something meeting every single one of the claim features.  Moreover, an applicant must present an argument for [[patentability]] (or, in the United States, an argument against a ''prima facie'' case of non-patentability) based only on features found within the claims.  The requirement to clearly define the metes and bounds of a claim is found in United States patent law at least at 35 U.S.C. 112, second paragraph, which states, "[t]he specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention."

'''Mina' al Fahal''' ({{lang-ar|'''ميناء الفحل'''}}, also known as Miana al Fahl, Saih al Malieh, and Saih al-Malih) is a coastal area in the northeast of [[Oman]], near to the country's capital, [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]]. It was renamed from Saih al Maleh as the petroleum processing plant was developed. It is a key area for the country's petroleum operations. '''[[Petroleum Development Oman]] (PDO)''' is based at Mina al Fahal, and the '''[[Oman Refinery Company]] (ORC)''' has a 104,000 b/d [[oil refinery]] located here. Crude oil and refinery products are loaded onto tankers off Mina Al Fahal by subsea pipeline and SBM (Single Buoy Mooring) Systems. Two of the SBMs are owned by PDO for crude export and the third is owned by SOM (Shell Oman Marketing).

'''Monte Binga''' is the highest mountain in [[Mozambique]] and the second highest mountain in [[Zimbabwe]]. It is located on the border between Zimbabwe and Mozambique in the [[Chimanimani]] Transfrontier Park in the province of [[Manica Province|Manica]]. Its height is 8004 feet (2440m) above sea level &lt;ref&gt;Sheet SE-36-14 Melsetter (1:250,000), Edition 2 (1972) Published by the Surveyor General, Rhodesia.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
The mountain is composed of very hard pale grey [[precambrian]] [[quartzite]], which underlies all of the Chimanimani Plateau, giving it a desolate rocky appearance. The north-south trending quartzite bedding is upturned near the summit to an angle of about 40 degrees and dips to the east, the foot of the mountain and the Turret Towers range immediately to the south lying on a thrust fault. Consequently, the eastern approach is more gradual, while the western face is steep to sheer in places. The northern face is cut off by a fault and is sheer near the top, changing to a vertical cliff lower down. Approaching from the west, from the Bundi River Valley, there is an ill-defined trail which branches off from the main smugglers trail to Skeleton Pass.

==Climbing==
The climb is arduous and takes about the best part of a day. There are a number of false summits en route.The best path, marked with cairns, climbs south-east then eastward up from the Bundi valley, then swings north-east below the mountain until, at Binga's northern shoulder, swings south-east, climbs the mountain's western face, and, reaching the ridge, swings into a northward scramble up to the beacon: about three hours from the Bundi valley.

There is little if any water on the approach from the west, nor at the top, but small [[puddles]] of water seep from the peat and collect in hollows not far off the summit on the gentler eastern slope. There are no well marked trails from Binga to the east and one must make one's own way, taking care when crossing the steep [[ravine]]s that lead eastwards.

===Summit===
At the top the mountain curves into a dome-like prominence. The appearance of the mountain top is bleak and rocky, with an extremely shallow [[peat]]y soil supporting only [[Tussock grassland|tussocky grass]] and [[moss]] between the [[lichen]]-covered hard rock outcrops.

The views over the Mozambique plain are spectacular. Theoretically, with a telescope it should just be possible to see the Indian Ocean from the peak of Binga on a very clear day looking along an easterly bearing, at a range of 190 kilometres. The mountain is remote from settlements.

The '''Natural Area Code''' (or Universal Address) is a proprietary [[geocode]] system for identifying an area anywhere on the [[Earth]], or a volume of space anywhere around the Earth.  The use of thirty alphanumeric characters instead of only ten digits makes a NAC shorter than its numerical [[latitude]]/[[longitude]] equivalent. 

== Two-dimensional system ==
Instead of numerical longitudes and latitudes, a grid with 30 rows and 30 columns - each cell denoted by the numbers 0-9 and the twenty consonants of the [[Latin alphabet]] - is laid over the flattened globe.  A NAC cell (or block) can be subdivided repeatedly into smaller NAC grids to yield an arbitrarily small area, subject to the ±1&amp;nbsp;m limitations of the [[World Geodetic System]] (WGS) data of 1984.  

A NAC represents an area on the earth—the longer the NAC, the smaller the area (and thereby, location) represented.  A ten-character NAC can uniquely specify any [[building]], [[house]], or fixed object in the world.  An eight-character NAC specifies an area no larger than 25 metres by 50 metres, while a ten-character NAC cell is no larger than 0.8 metres by 1.6 metres.

Using a [[base 30]] positional numeral system, NAC uses an alternate method which excludes vowels and avoids potential confusion between "0" (zero) and "O" (capital "o"), and "1" (one) and "I" (capital "i"):

|}
For example, the ten-character NAC for the centre of the city of [[Brussels]] is HBV6R&amp;nbsp;RG77T.

== Extension to three dimensions ==
The full NAC system provides a third coordinate: altitude.  This coordinate is the [[arctangent]] of the altitude, relative to the Earth's radius, and scaled so that the zero point (000...) is at the centre of the Earth, the midpoint (H00...) is the local radius of the geoid, i.e. the Earth's surface, and the endpoint (ZZZ...) is at infinity.

For example, the three-dimensional NAC for the centre of Brussels, at ground level, is HBV6R&amp;nbsp;RG77T&amp;nbsp;H0000.

The '''Oosterhout Formation''' is a [[geological formation]] in the [[subsoil]] in the central and south area of the [[Netherlands]]. The formation was formed during the [[Pliocene]] (5.333 million to 2.58 million years [[Before Present|BP]]). The formation was named after the city of [[Oosterhout]] in the province of [[North Brabant]].

The Oosterhout Formation mainly consists of [[sand]], often containing [[glauconite]]. In the upper layers, [[clay]] is also present. The Oosterhout Formation is usually right on top of the [[Miocene]] [[Breda Formation]].

[[Image:Priests traveling across kealakekua bay for first contact rituals.jpg|thumb|right|Hawaiian navigators sailing multi-hulled canoe, c. 1781]]

Traditional '''Polynesian navigation''' was used for thousands of years to make long voyages across thousands of miles of the [[Pelagic zone|open]] [[Pacific Ocean]]. [[Navigator]]s travelled to small inhabited islands using [[wayfinding]] techniques and knowledge passed by [[oral tradition]] from master to apprentice, often in the form of song. Generally each island maintained a [[guild]] of navigators who had very high status; in times of famine or difficulty they could trade for aid or evacuate people to neighboring islands. As of 2014, these traditional [[navigation]] methods are still taught in the [[Polynesian outlier]] of [[Duff Islands|Taumako Island]] in the [[Islands of the Solomon Islands|Solomons]].

Polynesian navigation used some navigational instruments, which predate and are distinct from the machined metal tools used by European navigators (such as the [[sextant]], first produced in 1730; the [[sea astrolabe]], from around late 15th century; and the [[marine chronometer]], invented in 1761). However, they also relied heavily on close observation of sea sign and a large body of knowledge from oral tradition.&lt;ref name="Leisl Clark"&gt;{{cite web |last=Clark |first=Liesl |title=Polynesia's Genius Navigators |date=15 February 2000 |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/polynesia-genius-navigators.html |accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both [[wayfinding]] techniques and [[outrigger canoe]] construction methods have been kept as [[Trade secret|guild secrets]], but in the modern revival of these skills, they are being recorded and published.

{{See also|Ancient Hawaii|Discovery and settlement of Hawaii}}
[[File:Polynesia.png|thumb|A projection of the [[Polynesian triangle]] on the globe.]]
Between about 3000 and 1000 BC speakers of Austronesian languages spread through the islands of [[Southeast Asia]] – almost certainly starting out from [[Taiwan]],&lt;ref name="howe20069298"&gt;{{Citation |title=Vaka Moana: Voyages of the Ancestors – the discovery and settlement of the Pacific |last=Howe |first=K.

In the archaeological record there are well-defined traces of this expansion which allow the path it took to be followed and dated with a degree of certainty. In the mid-2nd millennium BC a distinctive culture appeared suddenly in north-west Melanesia, in the [[Bismarck Archipelago]], the chain of islands forming a great arch from [[New Britain]] to the [[Admiralty Islands]]. This culture, known as [[Lapita]], stands out in the Melanesian archeological record, with its large permanent villages on beach terraces along the coasts. Particularly characteristic of the Lapita culture is the making of pottery, including a great many vessels of varied shapes, some distinguished by fine patterns and motifs pressed into the clay. Within a mere three or four centuries between about 1300 and 900 BC, the Lapita culture spread 6000&amp;nbsp;km further to the east from the Bismarck Archipelago, until it reached as far as [[Tonga]] and [[Samoa]].{{sfn|Bellwood|1987|pp=45–65}} Lapita pottery persisted in places such as [[Samoa]], [[Tonga]], and [[Fiji]] for many years after its upbringing to Western and Central Polynesia. However, pottery-making died out in most of Polynesia due to the scarcity of clay on the islands.&lt;ref name="Originalpeople.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lapita culture: ancestors of Polynesians, Micronesians, and some coastal areas of Melanesia|url=http://originalpeople.org/lapita-culture/|website=Originalpeople.org|accessdate=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this region, the distinctive Polynesian culture developed. The Polynesians are then believed to have spread eastward from the Samoan Islands into the Marquesas, the Society Islands, the Hawaiian Islands and Easter Island; and south to New Zealand. The pattern of settlement also extended to the north of Samoa to the Tuvaluan atolls, with [[Tuvalu]] providing a stepping stone to migration into the [[Polynesian outliers|Polynesian Outlier communities]] in [[Melanesia]] and [[Micronesia]].{{sfn|Bellwood|1987|pp=29, 54}}&lt;ref name="Bayard"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bayard|first1=D.

==Canoes and navigation==
The Polynesians encountered nearly every island within the vast [[Polynesian Triangle]] using outrigger canoes or double-hulled canoes. The double-hulled canoes were two large hulls, equal in length, and lashed side by side. The space between the paralleled canoes allowed for storage of food, hunting materials, and nets when embarking on long voyages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bellwood|first1=Peter|title=The Polynesians Prehistory of an Island People|date=1978|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=NY|isbn=9780500020937|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polynesians used strategic and natural navigation aides such as the stars, ocean currents, and wind patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bellwood|first1=Peter|title=The Polynesians Prehistory of an Island People|date=1978|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=NY|isbn=9780500020937|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Navigational devices==
[[File:Polynesian navigation device showing directions of winds, waves and islands.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Polynesian navigation device showing directions of winds, waves and islands, c. 1904]]
There are numerous traditional Polynesian devices used for navigating and/or teaching navigation. These include charts, spatial representations of islands and the conditions around them, and navigational instruments, such as those for measuring the elevation of celestial objects. They also include non-physical devices such as songs and stories for memorizing the properties of stars, islands, and navigational routes.

==Navigational techniques==
Navigation relies heavily on constant observation and memorization; you must constantly be aware of your surroundings. You cannot simply look up at the stars and know where you are. You are only able to know where you are if you are able to memorize where you have sailed from. The sun was the main guide for voyagers because they could follow its exact points as it rose and set; then, at night time they'd switch to using the stars rising and setting points. With constant observation, comes the knowledge of knowing and remembering the speed of your canoe (when it speeds up and slows down), what direction you are facing, and what time of the day or night it is. In the ancient days, they did not have watches, compasses or speedometers but they had their minds and the ability to memorize their surroundings. When there are no stars because of a cloudy night or during midday, the navigator would use the winds and swells to guide them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Nainoa|title=On Wayfinding|url=http://archive.hokulea.com/ike/hookele/on_wayfinding.html|website=Polynesian Voyaging Society|accessdate=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Polynesian navigators employed a whole range of techniques including use of the stars, the movement of ocean currents and wave patterns, the air and sea interference patterns caused by islands and [[atoll]]s, the flight of birds, the winds and the weather.&lt;ref name="Gatty_1958"&gt;{{harvnb|Gatty|1958}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bird observation===
Certain seabirds such as the [[White tern]] and Noddy tern feed on fish in the morning and return to rest on land at night time. Navigators use these birds to guide them to land by following where the birds are flying from in the morning and flying toward at night. Birds habits change during nesting season which is another thing navigators must be mindful of when voyaging. Generally speaking, if a navigator can see a large group of birds, that is a much more reliable sign for land than following one, two or a small group of birds.&lt;ref name="Lewis 1972"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=David|title=We, the Navigators|date=1972|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=HI|isbn=9780824802295}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Harold Gatty]] suggested that long-distance Polynesian voyaging followed the seasonal paths of [[bird migration]]s. In "The Raft Book",&lt;ref&gt;"[http://blog.library.si.edu/tag/harold-gatty/ Be Your Own Navigator]," ''Smithsonian Libraries Unbound'', 11 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; a survival guide he wrote for the U.S. military during World War II, Gatty outlined various Polynesian navigation techniques Allied sailors or aviators wrecked at sea could use to find their way to land. There are some references in their oral traditions to the flight of birds and some say that there were range marks onshore pointing to distant islands in line with the [[West Pacific Flyway]]. A voyage from Tahiti, the Tuamotus or the Cook Islands to New Zealand might have followed the migration of the [[long-tailed cuckoo]] (''Eudynamys taitensis'') just as the voyage from Tahiti to Hawai{{okina}}i would coincide with the track of the [[Pacific golden plover]] (''Pluvialis fulva'') and the [[bristle-thighed curlew]] (''Numenius tahitiensis''). It is also believed that Polynesians employed shore-sighting birds as did many seafaring peoples. One theory is that they would have taken a [[frigatebird]] (''Fregata'') with them. These birds refuse to land on the water as their feathers will become waterlogged making it impossible to fly. When the voyagers thought they were close to land they may have released the bird, which would either fly towards land or else return to the canoe.&lt;ref name="Gatty_1958" /&gt;

===Navigation by the stars===
[[File:Mau-star-compass.png|thumb|A photograph of a recreation of the star compass of [[Mau Piailug]] depicted with shells on sand, with [[Satawalese]] (See [[Trukic languages]]) text labels, as described and translated by the [[Polynesian Voyaging Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pvs.kcc.hawaii.edu/ike/hookele/star_compasses.html |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5rkR1hSvX?url=http://pvs.kcc.hawaii.edu/ike/hookele/star_compasses.html |archive-date=5 August 2010 |title=Star Compasses |publisher=Polynesian Voyaging Society |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shown here north-up. See annotations on Commons.]]
The positions of the stars helped guide Polynesians through their voyaging routes. Stars- as opposed to planets are able to hold a steady position year-round. The only thing that changes is the time the star rises which changes seasonally. Polynesian voyagers would follow stars near the horizon whether they were just rising or about to set and they used these specific stars for guidance. These stars were used to set the direction for their canoe up until the point when those stars rise too high and are no longer easy to follow. Once the star they've used to guide them rises too high, they use the next star that rises from the previous stars exact rising point to guide them next. The canoes latitude and the course being followed determines how many stars the navigator will need to get him to his destination.&lt;ref name="Lewis 1972"/&gt;
For navigators near the equator [[celestial navigation]] is simplified since the whole [[celestial sphere]] is exposed. Any star that passes the [[zenith]] (overhead) is on the [[celestial equator]], the basis of the [[equatorial coordinate system]]. Each star has a specific [[declination]], and when they rise or set, they give a [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]] for navigation. Stars are learned by compass point, making a star compass (star compasses list ~150 stars, in some systems&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Gatty]] (1958). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=r7XDAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Nature Is Your Guide]'', p.&amp;nbsp;45&lt;/ref&gt;). A simplified compass might list only a couple of dozen stars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.hokulea.com/ike/hookele/star_compasses.html Star Compass diagrams with translations]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the [[Caroline Islands]] [[Mau Piailug]] taught natural navigation using a [[List of selected stars for navigation|star compass]] diagrammed here. The development of "[[Compass rose#Sidereal compass rose|sidereal compasses]]" has been studied&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, M. D. (1985) ''[http://nautarch.tamu.edu/pdf-files/Halpern-MA1985.pdf The Origins of the Carolinian Sidereal Compass]'', Master's thesis, [[Texas A &amp; M University]]&lt;/ref&gt; and theorized to have developed from an [[pelorus (instrument)#Ancient instrument|ancient pelorus]].&lt;ref name="Gatty_1958" /&gt;

The Polynesians also took measurements of stellar elevation to determine their latitude. The latitudes of specific islands were also known, and the technique of "sailing down the latitude" was used.

===Swell===
The Polynesians also use wave and swell formations to navigate. Many of the habitable areas of the Pacific Ocean are groups of islands (or atolls) in chains hundreds of kilometers long. Island chains have predictable effects on waves and on currents. Navigators who lived within a group of islands would learn the effect various islands had on their shape, direction, and motion and would have been able to correct their path in accordance with the changes they perceived.  When they arrived in the vicinity of a chain of islands they were unfamiliar with, they may have been able to transfer their experience and deduce that they were nearing a group of islands. Once they had arrived fairly close to a destination island, they would have been able to pinpoint its location by sightings of land-based birds, certain cloud formations, as well as the reflections shallow water made on the undersides of clouds. It is thought that the Polynesian navigators may have measured the time it took to sail between islands in "canoe-days" or a similar type of expression.&lt;ref name="Gatty_1958" /&gt;
The energy that is transferred from the wind to the sea are wind waves. The waves that are created when the energy travels down away from the source area (like ripples) are known as swell. When the winds are strong at the source area, the swell is larger. The longer the wind blows, the longer the swell lasts. Because the swells of the ocean can remain consistent for days, navigators relied on them to carry their canoe in a straight line from one house on the star compass to a house of the same name on the opposite side of the horizon. Navigators were not always able to see stars; because of this, they relied on the swells of the ocean. Swell patterns are a much more reliable method of navigation than the actual waves which are determined by the local winds. Swells move in a straight direction which makes it easier for the navigator to determine whether the canoe is heading in the correct direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gooley|first1=Tristan|title=How to Read Water: Clues, Signs &amp; Patterns from Puddles to the Sea|year=2016|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton|location=NY|isbn=9781473615205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subantarctic and Antarctica===
[[Image:Antarctica Map.png|350px|thumb|right|Antarctica and surrounding islands, showing the [[Auckland Islands]] just above (south of) New Zealand, at the center bottom of the image]]

There is academic debate on the furthest southern extent of Polynesian expansion.

There is material evidence of Polynesian visits to some of the [[New Zealand Subantarctic Islands|subantarctic islands to the south of New Zealand]], which are outside Polynesia proper. Remains of a Polynesian settlement dating back to the 13th century were found on [[Enderby Island]] in the [[Auckland Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Tom ''Polynesians in the Southern Ocean: Occupation of the Auckland Islands in Prehistory'' in New Zealand Geographic 69 (September–October 2004): 6–8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Atholl J., &amp; Gerard R.

=== Pre-Columbian contact with the Americas ===
{{Main|Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact}}
In the mid-20th century, [[Thor Heyerdahl]] proposed a new theory of Polynesian origins (one which did not win general acceptance), arguing that the Polynesians had migrated from South America on [[balsa]]-log boats.&lt;ref name="Sharp_1963_122128"&gt;{{harvnb|Sharp|1963|pp=122–128}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Finney_1963_5" /&gt;

The presence in the [[Cook Islands]] of [[Ipomoea batatas|sweet potato]] that is a plant native to the Americas (called ''kūmara'' in [[Māori language|Māori]]), which have been radiocarbon-dated to 1000 CE, has been cited as evidence that Americans could have traveled to Oceania. The current thinking is that sweet potato was brought to central Polynesia circa 700 CE and spread across Polynesia from there, possibly by Polynesians who had traveled to South America and back.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Van Tilburg |first=Jo Anne |year=1994 |title=Easter Island: Archaeology, Ecology and Culture |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative explanation posits [[biological dispersal]]; plants and/or seeds could float across the Pacific without any human contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climate.uvic.ca/people/alvaro/SPotato.pdf |title=Modeling the prehistoric arrival of the sweet potato in Polynesia |last=Montenegro |first=A. |display-authors=etal |work=Journal of Archaeological Science |publisher=University of Victoria |accessdate=6 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628030307/http://climate.uvic.ca/people/alvaro/SPotato.pdf |archivedate=28 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 study published in the ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' examined [[chicken]] bones at [[El Arenal, Chile|El Arenal]] near the [[Arauco Peninsula]], [[Arauco Province]], [[Chile]]. The results suggested Oceania-to-America contact. Chickens originated in southern Asia and the ''Araucana'' breed of Chile was thought to have been brought by Spaniards around 1500. However, the bones found in Chile were radiocarbon-dated to between 1304 and 1424, well before the documented arrival of the Spanish. DNA sequences taken were exact matches to those of chickens from the same period in [[American Samoa]] and [[Tonga]], both over 5000 miles (8000 kilometers) away from Chile.  The genetic sequences were also similar to those found in [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]] and [[Easter Island]], the closest island at only 2500 miles (4000 kilometers), and unlike any breed of European chicken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.livescience.com/history/070604_polynesian_chicken.html | title =  Chicken Bones Suggest Polynesians Found Americas Before Columbus | journal = Live Science | date = 4 June 2007 | accessdate = 5 June 2007 | last = Whipps | first = Heather | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lat&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-sci-chickens5jun05,1,4338408.story?coll=la-headlines-nation |title=Polynesians beat Spaniards to South America, study shows |first=Thomas H., II |last=Maugh |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=5 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Storey |first=A.

Although this initial report suggested a Polynesian pre-Columbian origin a later report looking at the same specimens concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

A published, apparently pre-Columbian, Chilean specimen and six pre-European Polynesian specimens also cluster with the same European/Indian subcontinental/Southeast Asian sequences, providing no support for a Polynesian introduction of chickens to South America. In contrast, sequences from two archaeological sites on Easter Island group with an uncommon haplogroup from Indonesia, Japan, and China and may represent a genetic signature of an early Polynesian dispersal. Modeling of the potential marine carbon contribution to the Chilean archaeological specimen casts further doubt on claims for pre-Columbian chickens, and definitive proof will require further analyses of ancient DNA sequences and radiocarbon and stable isotope data from archaeological excavations within both Chile and Polynesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Indo-European and Asian origins for Chilean and Pacific chickens revealed by mtDNA| first1=J. |last1=Gongora |display-authors=etal |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |year=2008 |volume=105 |issue=30 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/105/30/10308 |pages=10308–10313 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0801991105|pmc=2492461 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, in a later study, the original authors extended and elaborated their findings, concluding:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

This comprehensive approach demonstrates that the examination of modern chicken DNA sequences does not contribute to our understanding of the origins of Chile’s earliest chickens. Interpretations based on poorly sourced and documented modern chicken populations, divorced from the archaeological and historical evidence, do not withstand scrutiny. Instead, this expanded account will confirm the pre-Columbian age of the El Arenal remains and lend support to our original hypothesis that their appearance in South America is most likely due to Polynesian contact with the Americas in prehistory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Polynesian Chickens in the New World: a detailed application of a commensal approach

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the last 20 years, the dates and anatomical features of human remains found in [[Mexico]] and South America have led some archaeologists{{who|date=February 2014}} to propose that those regions were first populated by people who crossed the Pacific several millennia before the [[Ice Age]] migrations; according to this theory, these would have been either eliminated or absorbed by the Siberian immigrants. However, current archaeological evidence for human migration to and settlement of remote Oceania (i.e., the [[Pacific Ocean]] eastwards of the [[Solomon Islands]]) is dated to no earlier than approximately 3,500 [[Before Present|BP]];&lt;ref&gt;Kirch, Patrick V. [http://sscl.berkeley.edu/~oal/background/background.htm ''Background to Pacific Archaeology and Prehistory''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609112244/http://sscl.berkeley.edu/~oal/background/background.htm |date=9 June 2007 }}, Oceanic Archaeology Laboratory, Univ. California, Berkeley.&lt;/ref&gt; trans-Pacific contact with the Americas coinciding with or pre-dating the Beringia migrations of at least 11,500 BP is highly problematic, except for movement along intercoastal routes.

Recently, linguist [[Kathryn A. Klar]] of [[University of California, Berkeley]] and [[archaeologist]] [[Terry L. Jones]] of [[California Polytechnic State University]] have proposed contacts between Polynesians and the [[Chumash (tribe)|Chumash]] and [[Gabrielino]] of [[Southern California]], between 500 and 700.  Their primary evidence consists of the advanced sewn-plank canoe design, which is used throughout the Polynesian Islands, but is unknown in North America – except for those two tribes. Moreover, the Chumash word for "sewn-plank canoe", ''[[tomolo'o]]'', may have been derived from ''kumulaa'au'', a Hawaiian word meaning "useful tree".

In 2008, an expedition starting on the Philippines sailed two modern [[James Wharram|Wharram]]-designed catamarans loosely based on a Polynesian catamaran found in Auckland Museum New Zealand. The boats were built in the Philippines by an experienced boat builder to Wharram designs using modern strip plank with epoxy resin glue built over plywood frames. The catamarans had modern Dacron sails, Terylene stays and sheets with modern roller blocks. Wharram says he used Polynesian navigation to sail along the coast of Northern New Guinea and then sailed 150 miles to an island for which he had modern charts, proving that it is possible to sail a modern catamaran along the path of the Lapita Pacific migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lapita-voyage.org/en/lapita_voyage.html |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204449/http://www.lapita-voyage.org/en/lapita_voyage.html |archive-date=3 March 2016 |title=Lapita Voyage – The first expedition following the migration route of the ancient Polynesians|first=Klaus |last=Hympendahl|accessdate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many other modern Polynesian "replica" voyages the Wharram catamarans were not towed or escorted by a modern vessel with modern GPS navigation system, nor were they fitted with a motor.

Polynesian contact with the prehispanic [[Mapuche]] culture in central-south Chile has been suggested because of apparently similar cultural traits, including words like ''toki'' (stone axes and adzes), hand clubs similar to the [[Māori language|Māori]] ''wahaika'', the sewn-plank canoe as used on Chiloe island, the ''curanto'' earth oven (Polynesian ''umu'') common in southern Chile, fishing techniques such as stone wall enclosures, a hockey-like game, and other potential parallels. Some strong westerlies and [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|El Niño]] wind blow directly from central-east Polynesia to the Mapuche region, between Concepcion and Chiloe. A direct connection from New Zealand is possible, sailing with the [[Roaring Forties]]. In 1834, some escapees from [[Tasmania]] arrived at Chiloe Island after sailing for 43 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Rapa Nui | language = Spanish |url = http://www.rapanuivalparaiso.cl/arque_olog.htm#ar5 | accessdate = 5 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=David|title=We, the Navigators: The Ancient Art of Landfinding in the Pacific|date=1972|publisher=Australian National University Press|location=Canberra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first settlers who sailed to the [[Hawaiian Islands]] are said to have arrived as early as 400 C.E by Polynesians from the [[Marquesas Islands]]. Captain [[James Cook]] was the first European to arrive to the island of [[Kaua’i]] in 1778. He returned a year later and was killed in an altercation with natives at [[Kealakekua Bay]]. In 1973, [[Ben Finney]] established the [[Polynesian Voyaging Society]] to test the contentious question of how Polynesians found their islands. The team claimed to be able to replicate ancient Hawaiian double-hulled canoes capable of sailing across the ocean using strictly traditional voyaging techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Finney|first1=Ben|title=Voyaging into Polynesia's Past The Founding of the Polynesian Voyaging Society|url=http://archive.hokulea.com/finneyfounding.html|website=Hokule'a|accessdate=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, a Hawaiian named [[Nainoa Thompson]] invented a new method of [[wayfinding|non-instrument navigation]] (called the "modern Hawaiian wayfinding system"), enabling him to complete the voyage from Hawai{{okina}}i to [[Tahiti]] and back. In 1987, a [[Māori people|Māori]] named Matahi Whakataka (Greg Brightwell) and his mentor Francis Cowan sailed from Tahiti to [[Aotearoa]] without instruments.

In New Zealand, a leading Māori navigator and ship builder is [[Hector Busby]] who was also inspired and influenced by Nainoa Thompson and Hokulea's voyage there in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maoriart.org.nz/hekenukumai-hector-busby-p-149.html |title=Profile: Hekenukumai (Hector) Busby |work=[[Toi Māori Aotearoa]] |accessdate=12 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141011205028/http://www.maoriart.org.nz/hekenukumai-hector-busby-p-149.html |archivedate=11 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wakatapu.com/ | title=Waka Tapu Canoes | publisher=[[NZMACI]] &amp; Taitokerau Tarai Waka | accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowledge of the traditional Polynesian methods of navigation was widely lost after contact with and colonization by Europeans. This caused debates over the reasons for the presence of the Polynesians in such isolated and scattered parts of the Pacific. According to [[Andrew Sharp (historian)|Andrew Sharp]], the explorer Captain [[James Cook]], already familiar with [[Charles de Brosses]]'s accounts of large groups of Pacific islanders who were driven off course in storms and ended up hundreds of miles away with no idea where they were, encountered in the course of one of his own voyages a castaway group of Tahitians who had become lost at sea in a gale and blown 1000 miles away to the island of [[Atiu]]. Cook wrote that this incident "will serve to explain, better than the thousand conjectures of speculative reasoners, how the detached parts of the earth, and, in particular, how the South Seas, may have been peopled".&lt;ref name="Sharp_1963_16"&gt;{{harvnb|Sharp|1963|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 19th century to the early 20th century, a more generous view of Polynesian navigation had come into favor, creating a much romanticized view of their seamanship, canoes, and navigational expertise. Late 19th and early 20th centuries writers such as [[Abraham Fornander]] and [[Percy Smith (ethnologist)|Percy Smith]] told of heroic Polynesians migrating in great coordinated fleets from Asia far and wide into present-day Polynesia.&lt;ref name="Finney_1963_5"&gt;{{harvnb|Finney|1963|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another view was presented by Andrew Sharp who challenged the "heroic vision" hypothesis, asserting instead that Polynesian maritime expertise was severely limited in the field of exploration and that as a result the settlement of Polynesia had been the result of luck, random island sightings, and drifting, rather than as organized voyages of colonization. Thereafter the oral knowledge passed down for generations allowed for eventual mastery of traveling between known locations.&lt;ref name="Sharp_1963"&gt;{{harvnb|Sharp|1963}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sharp's reassessment caused a huge amount of controversy and led to a stalemate between the romantic and the skeptical views.&lt;ref name="Finney_1963_5" /&gt;

[[File:Double hulled vaka, Rarotonga 2010.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Doubled hulled ''vaka'' in [[Rarotonga]], 2010.]]

By the mid-to-late 1960s it was time for a new hands-on approach. Anthropologist [[David Henry Lewis|David Lewis]] sailed his catamaran from Tahiti to New Zealand using [[stellar navigation]] without instruments.&lt;ref name="Lewis_1976"&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|1976}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist and historian [[Ben Finney]] built ''Nalehia'', a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} replica of a Hawaiian [[Outrigger canoe|double canoe]].  Finney tested the canoe in a series of sailing and paddling experiments in Hawaiian waters. At the same time, ethnographic research in the Caroline Islands in [[Micronesia]] brought to light the fact that traditional stellar navigational methods were still very much in everyday use there. The building and testing of proa canoes (''[[Wa (watercraft)|wa]]'') inspired by traditional designs, the harnessing of knowledge from skilled Micronesians, as well as voyages using stellar navigation, allowed practical conclusions about the seaworthiness and handling capabilities of traditional Polynesian canoes and allowed a better understanding of the navigational methods that were likely to have been used by the Polynesians and of how they, as people, were adapted to seafaring.&lt;ref name="Finney_1963_69"&gt;{{harvnb|Finney|1963|pp=6–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent re-creations of Polynesian voyaging have used methods based largely on Micronesian methods and the teachings of a Micronesian navigator, [[Mau Piailug]].&lt;ref&gt;See also: [[Polynesian Voyaging Society]], [[Hokulea]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with Polynesian oral tradition, the geography of Polynesian navigation pathways are said to resemble the geometric qualities of an octopus with head centred on [[Ra'iātea]] (French Polynesia) and tentacles spread out across the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;E. Tetahiotupa, ''Au gré des vents et des courants'' ([[Éditions des Mers Australes]]) 2009, https://www.tahiti-infos.com/Pourquoi-le-Triangle-polynesien-est-une-pieuvre_a135121.html&lt;/ref&gt; In oral tradition the octopus is known by various names such as [[Taumata-Fe'e-Fa'atupu-Hau]] (Grand Octopus of Prosperity), [[Tumu-Ra'i-Fenua]] (Beginning-of-Heaven-and-Earth) and [[Te Wheke-a-Muturangi]] (The Octopus of [[Muturangi]]).

==History==
The project was proposed in November 1998; in 2004 the project passed ESA-phase "C/D" and,&lt;ref name = "CESBIO"&gt;[http://www.cesbio.ups-tlse.fr/us/indexsmos.html The Living Planet Program Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (MIRAS on RAMSES)] Mission SMOS at Centre d'Etudes Spatailes de la BIOsphere (CESBIO)&lt;/ref&gt; after several delays, it was launched on 2 November 2009 from [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome]] on a [[Rockot]] rocket.&lt;ref name=bbc &gt;{{cite news | author=Jonathan Amos | title=European water mission lifts off | date=2 November 2009 | publisher=BBC News | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8331962.stm | accessdate = 2009-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first data from the [[Microwave Imaging Radiometer with Aperture Synthesis|MIRAS]] ([[Microwave]] Imaging [[Radiometer]] using [[Aperture]] Synthesis) instrument was received on 20 November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaEO/SEMDGULX82G_index_0.html|title=First SMOS data received|date=20 November 2009|publisher=ESA|accessdate=26 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SMOS programme cost is about €315 million ($465 million; £280 million). It is led by ESA but with significant input from French and Spanish interests.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

The satellite is part of ESA's Earth Explorer programme – eight spacecraft that will do innovative science in obtaining data on issues of pressing [[environmental science|environment]]al concern. The first is already in orbit – a mission called [[GOCE]], which is mapping variations in the pull of [[gravity]] across the Earth's surface. SMOS is the second Explorer to launch; and a third spacecraft, known as [[CryoSat-2]] (the first [[CryoSat]] failed on launch), was launched on 8 April 2010. CryoSat will assess the state of the world's ice cover.

==Launcher==
The satellite was launched on 2 November 2009 (04:50 (01:50 GMT)) to a nearly circular orbit of 763&amp;nbsp;km aboard a [[Rokot]], a modified [[Russians|Russian]] [[Intercontinental Ballistic Missile]] (ICBM) [[SS-19]] launched from a decommissioned SS-19 launcher from Northern Russia's  [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome]].&lt;ref name = "URSI-F-2005-Art_6.1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Jonathan Amos | title=Smos satellite unfurls instrument | date=3 November 2009 | publisher=BBC News | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8341400.stm | accessdate = 2009-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The SMOS satellite was launched together with the [[Proba-2]], a technology demonstration satellite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaTQM/1220880349148_index_0.html Successful launch qualification test for PROBA2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302233049/http://www.esa.int/esaTQM/1220880349148_index_0.html |date=2009-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurockot.com/alist.asp?cnt=20040811&amp;main=3&amp;subm=97# ESA's SMOS Mission to be launched in July 2009 from Plesetsk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126061131/http://www.eurockot.com/alist.asp?cnt=20040811&amp;main=3&amp;subm=97 |date=2009-01-26 }} The Rockot Missions.

==Science==
The goal of the SMOS mission is to monitor surface soil moisture with an accuracy of 4% (at 35–50&amp;nbsp;km [[spatial resolution]]).&lt;ref name = "CESBIO"/&gt; This aspect is managed by the HYDROS project.  Project Aquarius will attempt to monitor sea surface salinity with an accuracy of 0.1 [[Practical salinity unit|psu]] (10- to 30-day average and a spatial resolution of 200&amp;nbsp;km x 200&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref name = "CESBIO"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "EGU2008-A-01922"&gt;Mecklenburg S, Kerr Y, Font J and Hahne A.

Plants transpire water from depths lower than 1 meter in many places and satellites like SMOS can only provide moisture content down to a few centimeters, but using repeated measurements in a day, the satellite can extrapolate soil moisture.&lt;ref name = "URSI-F-2005-Art_6.1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "ESA Bulletin"/&gt;  The SMOS team of ESA hope to work with farmers around the world, including the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] to use as ground-based calibration for models determining soil moisture, as it may help to better understand [[crop yield]]s over wide regions.&lt;ref name = "SD_080424152254"&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080424152254.htm How Dry We Are: European Space Agency To Test Earth's Soil Moisture Via Satellite]-Science News, Science Daily&lt;/ref&gt;

Ocean [[salinity]] is crucial to the understanding of the role of the ocean in climate through the global [[water cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The water cycle and Global Warming|url=http://www.whoi.edu/sbl/liteSite.do?litesiteid=18912&amp;articleId=35166|publisher=WHOI|accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salinity in combination with temperature determine ocean circulation by defining its density and hence [[thermohaline circulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=High-latitude salinity effects and interhemispheric thermohaline circulations|url=http://wind.mit.edu/~jscott/AMOC/bryan_86.pdf|accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, ocean salinity is one of the variables that regulate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake and release and therefore has an effect on the oceanic [[carbon cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carbon Cycle - NASA Science|url=https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/oceanography/ocean-earth-system/ocean-carbon-cycle/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Information from SMOS is expected to help improve short and medium-term weather forecasts, and also have practical applications in areas such as agriculture and water resource management.  In addition, climate models should benefit from having a more precise picture of the scale and speed of movement of water in the different components of the hydrological cycle.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

===Instrumentation===
The SMOS satellite carries a new type of instrument called [[Microwave Imaging Radiometer with Aperture Synthesis]] (MIRAS). Some eight metres across, it has the look of helicopter rotor blades; the instrument creates images of radiation emitted in the [[microwave]] [[L-band]] (1.4&amp;nbsp;GHz). MIRAS will measure changes in the wetness of the land and in the salinity of seawater by observing variations in the natural microwave emission coming up off the surface of the planet.&lt;ref name="IEEE Proceedings 2010-05-Font-Camps-Borges"/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;&lt;ref name = "EGU2008-A-01922"/&gt;

===Operations and ground segment===
The [[CNES]] Satellite Operations [[ground segment|Ground Segment]] will operate the spacecraft with telecommunications from ESA's [[S-band]] facility located in [[Kiruna]], [[Sweden]]. The Data Processing Ground Segment ([[Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology|CDTI]], [[Villafranca]], [[Spain]]) will process SMOS data through the [[X-band]]. Higher level processing of information will be done by scientists globally.&lt;ref name = "URSI-F-2005-Art_6.1"/&gt;

'''Telephone numbers in [[Italy]]''' are defined by a telephone numbering plan that is organized by types of services.&lt;ref name="ITU_plan_intro"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-t/oth/02/02/T020200006B0001PDFE.pdf |title=National Numbering Plans : Italy|website=[[ITU]]|access-date=12 February 2017|language=English |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Landline numbers and mobile phone numbers are easily recognizable: the former start with '''0''' and the latter start with '''3'''. Other initial digits denote other services, such as emergency and toll-free numbers.

The [[Telephone numbering plan#Country code|country code]] for calling Italy from abroad is ''39''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.itu.int/itudoc/itu-t/ob-lists/icc/e164_763.pdf |title=List of ITU-T recommendation E.164 - assigned country codes |publisher=[[International Telecommunication Union]] |format=PDF |access-date=7 February 2017 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of international call prefixes|international prefix]] is ''00'', as is standard in most European countries.  Four different emergency numbers exist, including [[112 (emergency telephone number)|112]].&lt;ref name="eu112"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/112-italy |title=112 in Italy |website=European Commission |access-date=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Italy uses an open numbering plan in which the length of subscriber telephone numbers varies from six to eleven digits. The dialing procedures for callers mandate that the full telephone number is always dialed, including the [[Telephone numbering plan#Area code|area code]], which is called ''prefix'' (''prefisso'' in [[Italian language|Italian]]).

When communicating phone numbers it is usual to group the digits, but there are no fixed rules for grouping. The same phone number is likely to be written or pronounced differently by different people. Several symbols can be used to group digits; spaces are common, but dots and hyphens are often seen as well.

== Number formats ==
The minimum number length is 3 digits and the maximum is 12.&lt;ref &lt;ref name="ITU_plan_intro" /&gt;

=== Landline numbers ===
Landline numbers start with the digit ''0'' and are 6 to 11 digits long, although they are rarely shorter than 9. They are composed of a variable length prefix followed by a variable length [[Telephone numbering plan#Subscriber number|subscriber number]].

Prefixes are assigned on a geographical basis, starting from the north of the country: for example [[Turin]] has prefix "011", [[Rome]] has "06", [[Naples]] has "081" and [[Taranto]] has "099".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paginebianche.it/prefissi-telefonici?l=en |title=Find an Area Code |website=Pagine Bianche|access-date=30 January 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mobile phone numbers ===
Mobile phone numbers start with the digit ''3'' and are generally ten digits long. It is still possible, but rare, to find nine-digit numbers, which were the first to be assigned.

The first three digits of the mobile phone numbers (''prefix'') identify the [[mobile network operator]] that assigned the number, but since 2002 [[mobile number portability]] is possible and thus any number can end up being managed by any operator.

Some network operators allow the caller to insert additional digit in order to redirect phone calls to voice mail. For example dialing "'''36'''{{nbsp}}339{{nbsp}}7308986" will connect to the voice mail of the phone number "339{{nbsp}}7308986".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tim.it/assistenza/gestione-linea-e-servizi/mobile/attivare-e-disattivare-servizi-contenuto-csp-e-servizi-2 |title=Il Servizio di segreteria telefonica - TIM |website=TIM |access-date=18 May 2016|language=Italian |trans-title=Voicemail service - TIM}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extra digits required vary based on the network operator managing the number.

=== Emergency and service numbers ===
Emergency and service numbers start with the digit ''1''.

Four different emergency numbers are currently in use, but they are in the process of being replaced by ''112'', previously assigned to the gendarmerie, is already accepting any emergency calls in some areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interno.gov.it/it/notizie/modena-attivato-112-numero-unico-emergenze|title=Modena, attivato il 112 Numero Unico per le Emergenze |website=Ministero dell'Interno |access-date=18 May 2016|language=Italian |trans-title=Modena, activated the single emergency number 112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interno.gov.it/it/notizie/nel-2017-parte-liguria-servizio-112-numero-unico-emergenze|title=Nel 2017 parte in Liguria il servizio 112 Numero unico emergenze |website=Ministero dell'Interno |access-date=30 January 2017|language=Italian |trans-title=The single emergency number 112 is going to be activated in Liguria in 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calls to 112 are answered within seconds and in multiple languages.&lt;ref name="eu112" /&gt;

The complete list of emergency numbers is:
* "112": gendarmerie ([[Carabinieri]]);&lt;ref name="eu112" /&gt;&lt;ref name="usefulNumbers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paginebianche.it/eng/numeri-utili |title=Useful numbers |website=Pagine Bianche |access-date=30 January 2017 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "113": police ([[Polizia di Stato]]);&lt;ref name="eu112" /&gt;&lt;ref name="usefulNumbers" /&gt;
* "115": fire department ([[Vigili del Fuoco]]);&lt;ref name="eu112" /&gt;&lt;ref name="usefulNumbers" /&gt;
* "118": first aid.&lt;ref name="eu112" /&gt;&lt;ref name="usefulNumbers" /&gt;

Examples of service numbers are:
* "10...": carrier selection codes, to be prepended to the dialed number;
* "116": road help ([[Automobile Club d'Italia|ACI]]);
* "117": customs/financial/border police ([[Guardia di Finanza]]);&lt;ref name="usefulNumbers" /&gt;
* "12xx": directory services;
** "1240": directory service provided by [[Italiaonline]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.italiaonline.it/it/i-brand/12-40/ |title=12.40 |website=Italiaonline |access-date=30 January 2017|language=Italian }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "15xx": public utility services;
** "1515": fire department (forestry), handled by [[Corpo Forestale dello Stato]];&lt;ref name="usefulNumbers" /&gt;
** "1525": Environmental emergencies;
** "1518": road information, handled by CCISS;&lt;ref name="usefulNumbers" /&gt;
** "1530": maritime assistance, handled by [[Corps of the Port Captaincies – Coast Guard]];
* "194...": customer care services;
* "19696": social communication services, helpline for children;

=== Special-rate numbers ===
Special-rate numbers start with ''8'' and include [[Toll-free telephone number|toll-free numbers]] (called ''green numbers'', ''numeri verdi'' in Italian, starting with "80..."), shared-rate numbers ("84...") and premium-rate services ("89...").

=== Other numbers ===
Numbers starting with ''4'' are used for network-specific phone services like voice mailbox and various information services; they can be free, non-premium or premium.

Included in this category are, among others:
* "40...": free operator internal services;
* "455...": fundraising services for social purposes by non-profit agencies, organizations and associations and government;
* "47...": mass call services;
 
The digit '''5''' has been reserved for [[VoIP]] numbers. 
 
Finally '''7''' is used for internet services such as virtual fax numbers and dial up internet access ("70...").

=== Unassigned numbers ===
Numbers starting with the digits ''2'', ''6'' and ''9'' are currently unassigned and reserved for future purposes.

== Previous number formats ==
=== Trunk code removal ===
In the past it was possible to omit the prefix when calling from a landline to another landline in the same area. The digit "0" was the trunk code and it had to be removed when calling from abroad.&lt;ref name=fissaIlPrefisso&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.repubblica.it/online/fatti/prefisso/prefisso/prefisso.html |title=Da domani il prefisso anche in città |website=La Repubblica |access-date=18 May 2016|language=Italian |trans-title=Starting from tomorrow the prefix within the city}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This changed in 1998, with a transition period lasting from 19 June to 31 December. The new dial plan requires one to dial the full number for every call. The main advantage is the availability of millions of previously reserved phone numbers.&lt;ref name=fissaIlPrefisso /&gt;

The change was widely advertised with a campaign named "Fissa il prefisso" ("Attach the prefix").&lt;ref name=fissaIlPrefisso /&gt;

It was originally intended also to replace the leading "0" with "4" for landlines. This was scheduled to be implemented starting from 29 December 2000, but this never happened: "0" remained to identify landlines and "4" now identifies network services.

Example for calling the landline subscriber number "xxxxxxxx" in Rome:
* "xxxxxxxx": from within Rome, before 1998;
* "06{{nbsp}}xxxxxxxx": from within Rome, after 1998;
* "06{{nbsp}}xxxxxxxx": from outside Rome, both before and after 1998;
* "+39{{nbsp}}6{{nbsp}}xxxxxxxx": from abroad, before 1998;
* "+39{{nbsp}}06{{nbsp}}xxxxxxxx": from abroad, after 1998.

=== Mobile numbers prefix shortening ===
Until 2001 a leading "0" was part of any mobile phone number, but it has been removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.repubblica.it/online/tecnologie_internet/addiozero/numeri/numeri.html |title=Cellulari, prefisso senza 0 da sabato è obbligatorio |website=La Repubblica |access-date=18 May 2016|language=Italian |trans-title=Mobile phones without 0, from tomorrow it's mandatory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Example for calling the mobile phone number "3xx xxxxxxx":
* "03xx{{nbsp}}xxxxxxx": from within Italy, before 2001;
* "3xx{{nbsp}}xxxxxxx": from within Italy, after 2001;
* "+39{{nbsp}}3xx{{nbsp}}xxxxxxx": from abroad, both before and after 2001.

=== Other changes ===
Several other smaller changes occurred during the years: for example the prefix for toll free numbers changed from "167" to "800" in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.adnkronos.com/Archivio/AdnAgenzia/1999/01/30/Economia/TELECOM-NUMERO-VERDE-IL-167-DIVENTA-800_140400.php |title=Telecom: numero verde, il 167 diventa 800 |website=Adnkronos |access-date=18 May 2016|language=Italian |trans-title=Telecom: green number, 167 becomes 800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Special relations with other countries ==
=== Campione d'Italia ===
The Italian [[comune|municipality]] [[Campione d'Italia]], an [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]] within the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] canton of [[Ticino]], uses the Swiss telephone network and is part of the [[Telephone numbers in Switzerland|Swiss numbering plan]].

=== San Marino ===
{{main|Telephone numbers in San Marino}}
The Italian [[Enclave and exclave|enclave]] [[San Marino]] has its own country code '''378''', but landline numbers can be reached using the Italian country code as well: the prefix "0549" is assigned to San Marino. Dialing either "+378{{nbsp}}xxxxxx" or "+39{{nbsp}}0549{{nbsp}}xxxxxx" will reach the same number. Mobile phone customers are sometimes assigned Italian phone numbers.

=== Vatican City ===
{{main|Telephone numbers in Vatican City}}

The country code '''379''' is assigned to [[Vatican City]], but it is not used: telephone numbers in Vatican City are integrated into the Italian numbering plan. Vatican landline telephone numbers are in the form "+39{{nbsp}}06{{nbsp}}698xxxxx", "+39" being the country code for Italy and "06" the prefix for Rome.

'''The Climate Mobilization''' (TCM) is a [[grassroots]] environmental [[advocacy group]] working toward large-scale political action against [[global warming]], with the belief that the crisis of [[climate change]] requires a national economic effort on the scale of the American mobilization of the [[home front during World War II]].&lt;ref name="NR"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Merchant|first1=Emma Foehringer|title=Should We Respond to Climate Change Like We Did to WWII?|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/133423/respond-climate-change-like-wwii|work=New Republic|date=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the heads of leading environmental organizations including [[350.org]], [[Sierra Club]], [[Greenpeace]], [[Friends of the Earth]], and [[Rainforest Action Network]] signed a letter to Presidents [[Barack Obama]] and [[Hu Jintao]] calling for a "wartime-like mobilization" by the governments of the United States and China to cut carbon emissions 80% (based on 2006 levels) by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McKibben|first1=Bill|title=Getting the Message Where It Counts|url=https://350.org/getting-message-where-it-counts/|publisher=350.org|accessdate=22 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, environmental groups in the United States never organized politically for such an ambitious goal.

[[File:San Diego Climate Mobilization rally.jpg|thumb|Citizens advocating WWII-scale climate mobilization rally in San Diego in March 2015.]]
The Climate Mobilization was launched in September 2014, before the [[People's Climate March]] in New York City, specifically to organize politically around the concept of a rapid, World War II-scale government mobilization against climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dastagir|first1=Alia E.|title='Largest-ever' climate-change march rolls through NYC|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/21/nyc-climate-change-march/16008009/|work=USA TODAY|date=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margaret Klein Salamon and allies developed a pledge-based movement-building strategy in which signers agree to vote for political candidates who have signed the pledge over those who have not. The Climate Mobilization’s "[http://www.theclimatemobilization.org/pledgetomobilize Pledge to Mobilize]" calls on the United States government to commence a World War II-scale mobilization against climate change in order to decrease net greenhouse gas emissions 100% by 2025, deploy a system of removing greenhouse gases (GHG) from the atmosphere with wartime speed, and make reducing net GHGs 100% globally, with the same swiftness, a top political priority.&lt;ref name="Guernica" /&gt;

Throughout 2015, citizen activists in California, Iowa and elsewhere in the U.S. began rallying for World War II-scale national climate mobilization, and spreading the Climate Mobilization pledge to local political candidates.&lt;ref name="Vice"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cook|first1=Linda|title=Group rallies to sign climate change mobilization pledge|url=http://qctimes.com/news/local/group-rallies-to-sign-climate-change-mobilization-pledge/article_f7ce5106-fd69-5aa4-a85b-b4b7fb919363.html|work=Quad City Times|date=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Petroski|first1=William|title=Iowa activists demand war on climate change|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2015/11/05/iowans-demand-war-climate-change/75224760/|work=Des Moines Register|date=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Konstantinovic|first1=Aleksandra|title=San Diegans Rally for Climate Mobilization at City Hall|url=http://timesofsandiego.com/politics/2015/03/15/san-diegans-rally-for-climate-mobilization-at-city-hall/|work=Times of San Diego|issue=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, The Climate Mobilization sponsored a "Climate Emergency Caucus" in Des Moines before the [[Iowa caucuses]], which simulated the state's 2016 Democratic presidential primary caucus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Haley|first1=Charley|title=Sanders a favorite at climate change rally|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2016/01/30/sanders-favorite-climate-change-rally/79551596/|work=Des Moines Register|date=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former U.S. Senator [[Tom Harkin]] spoke on behalf of candidate [[Hillary Clinton]], and climate advocates [[Jane Kleeb]], founder of [[Bold Nebraska]], and Iowa politician and radio host [[Ed Fallon]] spoke on behalf of candidate [[Bernie Sanders]].

[[File:United Nations climate die-in.jpg|thumb|Activists protesting climate "gradualism" stage a die-in outside the signing of the COP21 Paris Agreement at the United Nations in NYC.]]
In April 2016, The Climate Mobilization organized a "[[die-in]]" outside the [[United Nations]] building in New York City during the signing of the [[COP 21]] [[Paris Agreement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Merchant|first1=Emma Foehringer|title=Today’s signing of the Paris agreement has environmentalists split|url=https://newrepublic.com/minutes/132940/todays-signing-paris-agreement-environmentalists-split|work=New Republic|date=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; meant to protest what the group called the agreement's inadequacy in relation to the scale of the threat of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fulton|first1=Deirdre|title="Global Elite's Theater": Paris Deal Is Mere Starting Point for Climate Justice|url=http://commondreams.org/news/2016/04/22/global-elites-theater-paris-deal-mere-starting-point-climate-justice|work=CommonDreams|date=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; TCM deputy director Ezra Silk called the agreement "historic in the sense that the [[Munich Agreement]] was historic — a catastrophic act of appeasement meant to maintain business-as-usual arrangements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ware|first1=Doug G.|title=Kerry, 174 leaders sign 'powerful' Paris climate change treaty amid skepticism, protests|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2016/04/22/Kerry-174-leaders-sign-powerful-Paris-climate-change-treaty-amid-skepticism-protests/9481461283504/|work=UPI|date=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He explained: "It's widely recognized that this agreement is not even close to what is needed... It doesn't really convey a sense of urgency [so] we wanted to sort of inject some reality into the discussion.

We are committed to a national mobilization, and to leading a global effort to mobilize nations to address this threat on a scale not seen since World War II.

'''Tuomas "Tommo" Vohlonen''' (24 September 1877 – 27 March 1939) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[inventor]]. A surveyor by trade, his patents cover a wide area of devices and activities including compasses, skis, surveying, engines and farming. He founded the company [[Suunto]] Oy which is still active producing compasses according to his patented method as well as dive computers, sport watches and heart-rate monitors.

In April 1933, after experimentation with various designs, Vohlonen applied for a patent from the Finnish National Board of Patents and Registration for a compact liquid-filled field [[compass]], in which the magnetic needle and damping fluid were completely sealed into a unitary fused [[celluloid]] capsule.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Suunto Oy, ''Suunto Company History'', December 2001 [http://www.suunto.com/suunto/Worlds/outdoor/main/outdoor_article_normal.jsp? Article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216024046/http://www.suunto.com/suunto/Worlds/outdoor/main/outdoor_article_normal.jsp |date=2008-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vohlonen was granted a patent on January 25, 1935.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  Together with his wife Elli and nephew Kauko he founded Suunto Oy in 1936. Vohlonen incorporated his new liquid-filled capsule into a lightweight wrist-mounted design, the Suunto M-311, suitable for use by soldiers, surveyors, hikers, and others navigating while afoot.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Early life==

In September 1877 Juho and Helena Vohlonen had a son in Vohloja ranch, Orimattila. Later they had four more children, sons Kelpo Hyvä (surveyor, wrestler) and Oiva Lahja (officer) and daughters Sievä Maria a.k.a. Maija (agronomist, sheep specialist, author) and Oma Eeva (agronomist), but this son was nominated Tuomas, with only one first name. Parents called him Tommo, and that nomination was used through his life. Only a few years before his death Tuomas could be seen in official patent papers. During the siblings’ childhood the family moved to Lappeenranta for a short while, then to Kekäleenmäki, Ruokolahti. There Juho Vohlonen worked as smith and also did some farming. Helena and Juho Vohlonen weren’t highly educated, but they had decided their children will get the highest education possible. Including daughters, which wasn’t very typical of that time. Earlier stages of school were done in Ruokolahti, later stages in Lappeenranta.  Tuomas went to college in Vyborg. After that Tuomas studied in Finnish polytechnic to become a surveyor.&lt;ref name="prh.fi"&gt;http://www.prh.fi/stc/attachments/Kertomus_Tommosta.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interests and influences==

Vohlonen siblings were all interested in outdoor living, sports, hunting and fishing. Tuomas’ brother Kelpo Vohlonen was a competition-level wrestler trained by an olympic winner [[Verner Weckman]], but it's told Tuomas still defeated him easily in wrestling. Tuomas was attracted by wilderness, distant districts, snow fields and open waters. Even when he had settled in Helsinki, he travelled to Saimaa as often as possible. There he had a small boat with outboard motor and a sauna on a beach he had entirely bought. Orienteering was one of Tuomas' favorites, and eventually it became the work of his life.&lt;ref name="prh.fi"/&gt;

==As inventor==
[[File:Advertisement of Mars Magneto.jpg|thumb|Advertisement of Mars Magneto from 1924]]
Oldest of Vohlonen’s innovations was to turn the compass needle into vertical position. Through this, the needle stabilized more quickly. After many decades Vohlonen returned developing the compass and invented a method of fabricating the needle chamber. With this method the needle chamber could be sealed hermetically and the chamber had a waved bottom plate to stabilize the pressure. He also improved many nautical and airplane compasses. During the same time, he developed a device for measuring height, for example of trees. He also developed a holder for compass. It was named PIVO, an abbreviation of names [[Lauri Pihkala|Pihkala]] and Vohlonen. His ski bindings has been playing a role in development of Finnish skiing. In the 1930s, living in Helsinki, he started developing the bindings. Because of new version of binding, also the ski boots had to be redeveloped. Spark devices of combustion engines were of his interest in the 1920s. He built them in Pori. He had a small factory for them, and he went on with them later in Helsinki, having them produced under brand Mars. Because of his innovation, the frame of magneto could be manufactured from a single piece. He also invented a starting assistant for magneto, which gave out a full spark even with slow revolutions. In farming he developed a classifier for grain, and for forestry he developed a plow, both later fabricated by [[Rosenlew]]. In surveying, in addition to the tree height measuring device, he developed a device for angular measuring and also other assistive gear. He developed a method for fast reading and learning. Engineer Tuomas Vohlonen died on March 27, 1939, at age of 61. He is buried in Ruokolahti, Finland.&lt;ref&gt;Article in newspaper Etelä-Saimaa, April 13, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuits about patents==

===The original patent===
[[File:Needle chambers of M311.jpg|thumb|The original needle chamber of Suunto M-311 on the left with filling hole visible. On the right: newer design.]]
On April 10, 1933 Tuomas Vohlonen applied for a patent for a liquid compass, with the description "liquid compass with compass needle and liquid entirely sealed in a container made of celluloid". On September 3, 1934 Vohlonen supplemented the application with edited patent demands: 1: Method of manufacturing a liquid compass, in which the liquid chamber is manufactured of two or more pieces and jointed by gluing or soldering, to form a sealed chamber, 2: Liquid is pressed into chamber through a small hole, which is then sealed with glue or soldering and 3: Liquid compass built under conditions 1 and 2, and 4: the needle chamber is made entirely of celluloid or other substance like it. Now the application included the fabrication method. On September 11, 1934 Vohlonen made another supplement, which included the same as the previous, only rephrased. On January 25, 1935 Vohlonen was granted a patent number 16285 for a method of manufacturing a liquid compass and a liquid compass manufactured accordingly. The patent was effective from the date of first application, April 10, 1933.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Announcement of Finnish supreme court, case KKO 1943-II-203, September 9, 1943&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1932 a Swedish company Nya Instrumentfabriks Aktiebolaget Lyth had applied for a patent also in Finland for "vätskekompass", a liquid filled compass. In the application the needle chamber was described as being built of two different materials, of which only the upper part was made of flexible material. Nothing was mentioned about method of fabrication. This caused a threat and delay for accepting Vohlonen's patent. However, these applications were not considered to be about the same kind of product, so both Vohlonen and Lyth were granted a patent.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.prh.fi/stc/attachments/Kompassin_puute.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the reasons why Vohlonen had to supplement his application: he knew the original formulation wouldn't succeed.

Oy Physica AB, a Finnish company, had made compasses under license by Vohlonen, and these resembled heavily the original Suunto M-311, only minor changes were made. The license expired in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digi.kansalliskirjasto.fi/pienpainate/binding/342734|title=Varoitus, Helsinki 20.03.1936 - Pienpainatteet - Digitoidut aineistot - Kansalliskirjasto|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a publication by Metos Oy about their company history it is said: In the same premises as Metos Oy, a sister company administrated by same owners, Oy Physica Ab was a supplier for Finnish military forces. It employed about 20 people. The most significant article for Physica was a compass, competing the market with Suunto Oy.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Metos Uutiset 2/2012&lt;/ref&gt; Physica sued Vohlonen, because, according to them, the supplements described a totally different product, the original application didn’t mention anything about a manufacturing method and, in addition, the method was elsewhere used long before the patent application, thus, the patent should be cancelled. On September 27, 1940, the first stage of court gave a statement: It is not up to them to judge whether the patent was given according to faulty descriptions, thus the patent remains effective as it was. On March 27, 1942, the second stage of court gave a statement, according to which all the structures described in the patent were known before, and thus the patent shouldn’t have been granted, and declared the patent void. On September 9, 1943, the supreme court abolished the second stage judgement, ratified the first stage judgement and thus, the patent remained effective.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

===On bezel===
[[File:The patented groove.jpg|thumb|The patented groove on the bezel of Suunto M-311]]
Tuomas Vohlonen was granted a patent number 16121 on October 12, 1934. It was for a device in a compass to measure the angle. It was described as being in a bezel, in which there were diagonal grooves, screws or other alike to place a ruler, pen or alike, to rotate a bezel to align with the north of map. On a first trial, Physica sued Vohlonen on a basis that the device already existed and was well known before the date of patent application. On the second trial of the same question, Physica sued Vohlonen, because they didn’t consider the device to be any followance of creative work to be considered an innovation, let alone to be worth patenting. Also, they considered the patent to disturb their business and thus, they demanded the patent to be void. On the first trial, the supreme court judged the patent to be effective. On the second trial, Vohlonen family didn’t even respond, saying the matter was already solved in the first trial. The supreme court gave its final statement on February 25, 1944, according to which the court didn’t chance the verdict of the first trial.&lt;ref&gt;Announcement of Finnish supreme court, case KKO 1944-II-48, February 25, 1944&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confiscating the tools===

On November 18, 1935, because of the demand of Tuomas Vohlonen, the court gave an order to confiscate the tools of Physica, which were used for making compasses. The confiscation was executed three days later. Physica sued Vohlonen family, the lawsuit went through all the stages of the court, and the supreme court gave its statement on February 17, 1947, according to which the tools could have been used for other purposes also, so the confiscation wasn’t necessary. Vohlonen family had to pay Physica for the damage caused.&lt;ref&gt;Announcement of Finnish supreme court, case KKO 1947-II-54, February 17, 1947&lt;/ref&gt;

===The result===

Cases mentioned above provide a preview of the setting. Suunto Oy and Vohlonen family won most of these long-lasting trials and the patents remained effective. Soon after these times, Physica gradually quit the manufacture of compasses as unprofitable and the whole company vanished.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

'''Zhang Heng''' ({{zh|t={{linktext|張|衡}}}}; AD 78–139), formerly [[romanization of Chinese|romanized]] as '''Chang Heng''', was a [[Han Chinese]] [[polymath]] from [[Nanyang, Henan|Nanyang]] who lived during the [[Eastern Han dynasty|Han dynasty]]. Educated in the capital cities of [[Luoyang]] and [[Chang'an]], he achieved success as an [[Chinese astronomy|astronomer]], [[Chinese mathematics|mathematician]], [[scientist]], [[engineer]], [[inventor]], [[geographer]], [[History of cartography#China|cartographer]], [[Chinese painting|artist]], [[Chinese poetry|poet]], statesman, and literary scholar.

Zhang Heng began his career as a minor civil servant in Nanyang. Eventually, he became Chief Astronomer, Prefect of the Majors for Official Carriages, and then Palace Attendant at the imperial court. His uncompromising stance on historical and calendrical issues led to his becoming a controversial figure, preventing him from rising to the status of Grand Historian. His political rivalry with the palace [[eunuch]]s during the reign of [[Emperor Shun of Han|Emperor Shun]] (r.&amp;nbsp;125–144) led to his decision to retire from the central court to serve as an administrator of [[Hejian]] in [[Hebei]]. Zhang returned home to Nanyang for a short time, before being recalled to serve in the capital once more in 138. He died there a year later, in 139.

Zhang applied his extensive knowledge of mechanics and gears in several of his inventions. He invented the world's first [[Hydraulics|water-powered]] [[armillary sphere]] to assist astronomical observation;&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 30"/&gt; improved the inflow [[water clock]] by adding another tank;&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 2 479 footnote e"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 479 footnote e.&lt;/ref&gt; and invented the world's first seismoscope, which discerned the [[cardinal direction]] of an [[earthquake]] {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} away.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 30"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wright 2001 66"&gt;Wright (2001), 66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huang 1997 64"&gt;Huang (1997), 64.&lt;/ref&gt; He improved previous Chinese calculations for [[pi]]. In addition to documenting about 2,500 stars in his extensive [[star catalog]], Zhang also posited theories about the [[Moon]] and its relationship to the [[Sun]]: specifically, he discussed the Moon's sphericity, its illumination by reflected sunlight on one side and the [[Lunar phase|hidden nature]] of the other, and the nature of [[Solar eclipse|solar]] and [[lunar eclipse|lunar]] [[eclipse]]s. His ''[[fu (poetry)|fu]]'' (rhapsody) and ''[[shi (poetry)|shi]]'' poetry were renowned in his time and studied and analyzed by later Chinese writers. Zhang received many posthumous honors for his scholarship and ingenuity; some modern scholars have compared his work in astronomy to that of the Greco-Roman [[Ptolemy]] (AD&amp;nbsp;86–161).

===Early life===

Born in the town of [[Xi'e]] in [[Nanyang Commandery]] (north of the modern [[Nanyang, Henan|Nanyang City]] in [[Henan]] [[provinces of China|province]]), Zhang Heng came from a distinguished but not very affluent family.&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1049"/&gt;&lt;ref name="xiao knechtges 1996 397"&gt;Xiao and Knechtges (1996), 397.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yan 2007 127"&gt;Yan (2007), 127.&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather Zhang Kan had been governor of a [[Commandery (China)|commandery]] and one of the leaders who supported the restoration of the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] by [[Emperor Guangwu of Han|Emperor Guangwu]] (r.&amp;nbsp;25–57), following the death of the usurping [[Wang Mang]] of the [[Xin Dynasty|Xin]] (AD&amp;nbsp;9–23).&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1049"&gt;Crespigny (2007), 1049.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="xiao knechtges 1996 398"/&gt;&lt;ref name="asiapac 2004 120"&gt;Asiapac (2004), 120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="loewe 1968 105"&gt;Loewe (1968), 105.&lt;/ref&gt; When he was ten, Zhang's father died, leaving him in the care of his mother and grandmother.&lt;ref name="asiapac 2004 120"/&gt; An accomplished writer in his youth, Zhang left home in the year 95 to pursue his studies in the [[capitals of China|capitals]] of [[Chang'an]] and [[Luoyang]].&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1049"/&gt; While traveling to Luoyang, Zhang passed by a [[hot spring]] near [[Mount Li]] and dedicated one of his earliest [[Fu (poetry)|''fu'' poems]] to it.&lt;ref name="neinhauser 1986 211"&gt;Neinhauser et al. (1986), 211.&lt;/ref&gt; This work, entitled "''Fu'' on the Hot Springs" (''Wēnquán fù'' 溫泉賦), describes the throngs of people attending the hot springs, which later became famous as the "[[Huaqing Pool|Huaqing Hot Springs]]", a favorite retreat of imperial concubine [[Yang Guifei]] during the [[Tang dynasty]].&lt;ref name="fraser371"&gt;Fraser (2014): 371.&lt;/ref&gt; After studying for some years at Luoyang's [[Taixue]], he was well-versed in the [[Chinese classic texts|classics]] and friends with several notable persons, including the mathematician and calligrapher [[Cui Yuan (Han dynasty)|Cui Yuan]] (78–143), the official and philosophical commentator [[Ma Rong]] (79–166), and the philosopher [[Wang Fu (philosopher)|Wang Fu]] (78–163).&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1049"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yan 2007 127"/&gt; Government authorities offered Zhang appointments to several offices, including a position as one of the [[Three Excellencies|Imperial Secretaries]], yet he acted modestly and declined.&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1049"/&gt;&lt;ref name="neinhauser 1986 211"/&gt; At age twenty-three, he returned home with the title "Officer of Merit in Nanyang", serving as the master of documents under the administration of Governor [[Bao De]] (in office from 103–111).&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1049"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yan 2007 127"/&gt;&lt;ref name="xiao knechtges 1996 398"/&gt; As he was charged with composing inscriptions and dirges for the governor, he gained experience in writing official documents.&lt;ref name="xiao knechtges 1996 398"/&gt; As Officer of Merit in the commandery, he was also responsible for local appointments to office and recommendations to the capital of nominees for higher office.&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1229"&gt;Crespigny (2007), 1229.&lt;/ref&gt; He spent much of his time composing [[Rhapsody (music)|rhapsodies]] on the capital cities. When Bao De was recalled to the capital in 111 to serve as a minister of finance, Zhang continued his literary work at home in Xi'e.&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1049"/&gt;&lt;ref name="xiao knechtges 1996 398"/&gt;&lt;ref name="neinhauser 1986 211"/&gt; Zhang Heng began his studies in astronomy at the age of thirty and began publishing his works on [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]] and [[Chinese mathematics|mathematics]].&lt;ref name="xiao knechtges 1996 398"/&gt;

===Official career===
{{further|Government of the Han Dynasty}}
In 112, Zhang was summoned to the court of [[Emperor An of Han|Emperor An]] (r.&amp;nbsp;106–125), who had heard of his expertise in mathematics.&lt;ref name="xiao knechtges 1996 398"/&gt; When he was nominated to serve at the capital, Zhang was escorted by carriage—a symbol of his official status—to Luoyang, where he became a court gentleman working for the [[Three Excellencies|Imperial Secretariat]].&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1049"/&gt;&lt;ref name="xiao knechtges 1996 398"/&gt; He was promoted to Chief Astronomer for the court, serving his first term from 115–120 under Emperor An and his second under the succeeding emperor from 126–132.&lt;ref name="xiao knechtges 1996 398"/&gt; As Chief Astronomer, Zhang was a subordinate of the Minister of Ceremonies, one of [[Nine Ministers]] ranked just below the Three Excellencies.&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1222"&gt;Crespigny (2007), 1222.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to recording heavenly observations and portents, preparing the calendar, and reporting which days were auspicious and which ill-omened, Zhang was also in charge of an advanced literacy test for all candidates to the Imperial Secretariat and the [[Censorate]], both of whose members were required to know at least 9,000 [[Chinese characters|characters]] and all major writing styles.&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1222"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bielenstein (1980), 9 &amp; 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Emperor An, Zhang also served as Prefect of the Majors for Official Carriages under the Ministry of Guards, in charge of receiving [[memorials to the throne]] (formal essays on policy and administration) as well as nominees for official appointments.&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1049 1223"&gt;Crespigny (2007), 1049 &amp; 1223.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yan 2007 128"/&gt;

When the government official Dan Song proposed the [[Chinese calendar]] should be reformed in 123 to adopt certain [[Apocrypha|apocryphal teachings]], Zhang opposed the idea. He considered the teachings to be of questionable stature and believed they could introduce errors.&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1049"/&gt; Others shared Zhang's opinion and the calendar was not altered, yet Zhang's proposal that apocryphal writings should be banned was rejected.&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1049"/&gt; The officials Liu Zhen and Liu Taotu, members of a committee to compile the dynastic history ''Dongguan Hanji'' ({{lang|zh|東觀漢記}}), sought permission from the court to consult Zhang Heng.&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1049"/&gt; However, Zhang was barred from assisting the committee due to his controversial views on apocrypha and his objection to the relegation of [[Gengshi Emperor]]'s (r.&amp;nbsp;23–25) role in the restoration of the Han Dynasty as lesser than Emperor Guangwu's.&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1049 1050"&gt;Crespigny (2007), 1049–1050.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mansvelt-beck 1990 26"&gt;Mansvelt-Beck (1990), 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Liu Zhen and Liu Taotu were Zhang's only historian allies at court, and after their deaths Zhang had no further opportunities for promotion to the prestigious post of court historian.&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1049 1050"/&gt;

Despite this setback in his official career, Zhang was reappointed as Chief Astronomer in 126 after [[Emperor Shun of Han]] (r. 125–144) ascended to the throne.&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1050"/&gt;&lt;ref name="declercq 1998 65"&gt;Declercq (1998), 65.&lt;/ref&gt; His intensive astronomical work was rewarded only with the rank and salary of 600&amp;nbsp;bushels, or ''[[Government of the Han Dynasty#Salaries|shi]]'', of grain (mostly commuted to [[Chinese coins|coin cash]] or bolts of [[silk]]).&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1050"/&gt;&lt;ref name="loewe 1968 42"&gt;Loewe (1968), 42.&lt;/ref&gt; To place this number in context, in a hierarchy of twenty official ranks, the lowest-paid official earned the rank and salary of 100&amp;nbsp;bushels and the highest-paid official earned 10,000&amp;nbsp;bushels during the Han.&lt;ref name="wang 1949 137"&gt;Wang (1949), 137.&lt;/ref&gt; The 600-bushel rank was the lowest the emperor could directly appoint to a central government position; any official of lower status was overseen by central or provincial officials of high rank.&lt;ref name="wang 1949 142"&gt;Wang (1949), 142 &amp; 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 132, Zhang introduced an intricate seismoscope to the court, which he claimed could detect the precise cardinal direction of a distant [[earthquake]].&lt;ref name="minford lau 2002 307"&gt;Minford &amp; Lau (2002), 307.&lt;/ref&gt; On one occasion his device indicated that an earthquake had occurred in the northwest. As there was no perceivable tremor felt in the capital his political enemies were briefly able to relish the failure of his device,&lt;ref name="minford lau 2002 307"/&gt; until a messenger arrived shortly afterwards to report that an earthquake had occurred about 400&amp;nbsp;km (248&amp;nbsp;mi) to 500&amp;nbsp;km (310&amp;nbsp;mi) northwest of Luoyang in [[Gansu]] province.&lt;ref name="minford lau 2002 307"/&gt;&lt;ref name="balchin 2003 26 27"&gt;Balchin (2003), 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 627"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 627.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="krebs 2003 31"/&gt;

[[Image:Pottery palace 1.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Chinese ceramics|A pottery]] miniature [[Chinese palaces|of a palace]] made during the Han Dynasty; as a palace attendant, Zhang Heng had personal access to Emperor Shun and the right to escort him]]
A year after Zhang presented his seismoscope to the court, officials and candidates were asked to provide comments about a series of recent earthquakes which could be interpreted as signs of displeasure from Heaven.&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1050"/&gt; The ancient Chinese viewed natural calamities as cosmological punishments for misdeeds that were perpetrated by the Chinese ruler or his subordinates on earth. In Zhang's [[memorial to the throne|memorial]] discussing the reasons behind these natural disasters, he criticized the new recruitment system of Zuo Xiong which fixed the age of eligible candidates for the title "[[Xiaolian|Filial and Incorrupt]]" at age forty.&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1050"/&gt; The new system also transferred the power of the candidates' assessment to the Three Excellencies rather than the Generals of the Household, who by tradition oversaw the affairs of court gentlemen.&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1050"/&gt; Although Zhang's memorial was rejected, his status was significantly elevated soon after to Palace Attendant, a position he used to influence the decisions of Emperor Shun.&lt;ref name="yan 2007 128"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1050"/&gt; With this prestigious new position, Zhang earned a salary of 2,000&amp;nbsp;bushels and had the right to escort the emperor.&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1225"&gt;Crespigny (2007), 1225.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Palace Attendant to Emperor Shun, Zhang Heng attempted to convince him that the court [[eunuch]]s represented a threat to the imperial court. Zhang pointed to specific examples of past court intrigues involving eunuchs, and convinced Shun that he should assume greater authority and limit their influence.&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1050"/&gt; The eunuchs attempted to slander Zhang, who responded with a ''fu'' rhapsody called "''Fu'' on Pondering the Mystery", which vents his frustration.&lt;ref name="fraser371" /&gt; [[Rafe de Crespigny]] states that Zhang's rhapsody used imagery similar to [[Qu Yuan]]'s (340–278&amp;nbsp;BC) poem "[[Li Sao]]" and focused on whether or not good men should flee the corrupted world or remain virtuous within it.&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1050"/&gt;&lt;ref name="neinhauser 1986 211 212"&gt;Neinhauser et al. (1986), 211–212.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:CMOC Treasures of Ancient China exhibit - pictorial brick depicting a courtyard scene.jpg|thumb|200px|Eastern Han tomb brick depicting the courtyard of a wealthy family's home. Zhang enjoyed a short period of retirement at his home in Xi'e, Nanyang, before being called back to the capital, where he died in 139.]]

[[Image:QueenMotherOfTheWest-Earthenware-EasternHanDynasty-ROM-May8-08.png|thumb|left|200px|An Eastern Han [[earthenware]] figurine of the [[Queen Mother of the West]]. Zhang fantasized about her in his "Rhapsody on Contemplating the Mystery" ({{lang|zh|思玄賦}}), yet the pleasures of the flesh and [[immortality]] that she could offer were not tempting enough to sway his heart which was set elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Loewe (2005), 37.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
While working for the central court, Zhang Heng had access to a variety of written materials located in the Archives of the Eastern Pavilion.&lt;ref name="harper 1987 262"&gt;Harper (1987), 262.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang read many of the great works of history in his day and claimed he had found ten instances where the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' by [[Sima Qian]] (145–90&amp;nbsp;BC) and the ''[[Book of Han]]'' by [[Ban Gu]] (AD&amp;nbsp;32–92) differed from other ancient texts that were available to him.&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1049"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lu 1995 57"&gt;Lu (1995), 57.&lt;/ref&gt; His account was preserved and recorded in the 5th&amp;nbsp;century text of the ''[[Book of Later Han]]'' by [[Fan Ye (historian)|Fan Ye]] (398–445).&lt;ref name="lu 1995 57"/&gt; His [[Rhapsody (music)|rhapsodies]] and other literary works displayed a deep knowledge of classic texts, [[Chinese philosophy]], and [[Twenty-Four Histories|histories]].&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1049"/&gt; He also compiled a commentary on the ''Taixuan'' ({{lang|zh|太玄}}, "Great Mystery") by the [[Taoism|Daoist]] author [[Yang Xiong (author)|Yang Xiong]] (53&amp;nbsp;BC–AD&amp;nbsp;18).&lt;ref name="yan 2007 127"/&gt;&lt;ref name="xiao knechtges 1996 398"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1050"/&gt;

[[Xiao Tong]] (501–531), a [[crown prince]] of the [[Liang Dynasty]] (502–557), immortalized several of Zhang's works in his literary anthology, [[Wen Xuan|''Selections of Refined Literature (Wen xuan'' 文選'')'']]. Zhang's rhapsodies ({{lang|zh|賦}}, ''[[fu (literature)|fu]]'') include "Western Metropolis Rhapsody" (''Xī jīng fù'' 西京賦), "Eastern Metropolis Rhapsody" (''Dōng jīng fù'' 東京賦), "Southern Capital Rhapsody" (''Nán dū fù'' 南都賦), "Rhapsody on Contemplating the Mystery" (''Sī xuán fù'' 思玄賦), and "[[Return to the Field (rhapsody)|Rhapsody on Returning to the Fields]]" (''Guī tián fù'' 歸田賦).&lt;ref name="lewis 2006 184"&gt;Lewis (2006), 184.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter fuses [[Daoism|Daoist]] ideas with [[Confucianism]] and was a precursor to later Chinese metaphysical nature poetry, according to Liu Wu-chi.&lt;ref name="liu 1990 54"&gt;Liu (1990), 54.&lt;/ref&gt; A set of four short lyric poems (''[[shi (poetry)|shi]]'' [[shi (poetry)|詩]]) entitled "Lyric Poems on Four Sorrows" (''Sì chóu fù'' 四愁詩), is also included with Zhang's preface. This set constitutes some of the earliest heptasyllabic ''shi'' [[Chinese poetry]] written.&lt;ref name="neinhauser 1986 212"&gt;Neinhauser et al. (1986), 212.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mair 2001 251"&gt;Mair (2001), 251.&lt;/ref&gt; While still in Luoyang, Zhang became inspired to write his "Western Metropolis Rhapsody" and "Eastern Metropolis Rhapsody", which were based on the "Rhapsody on the Two Capitals" by the historian Ban Gu.&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1049"/&gt; Zhang's work was similar to Ban's, although the latter fully praised the contemporaneous Eastern Han regime while Zhang provided a warning that it could suffer the same fate as the Western Han if it too declined into a state of decadence and moral depravity.&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1049"/&gt; These two works satirized and criticized what he saw as the excessive luxury of the upper classes.&lt;ref name="neinhauser 1986 211"/&gt; Zhang's "Southern Capital Rhapsody" commemorated his home city of Nanyang, home of the restorer of the Han Dynasty, Guangwu.&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1049"/&gt;

In Zhang Heng's poem "Four Sorrows", he laments that he is unable to woo a beautiful woman due to the impediment of mountains, snows and rivers.&lt;ref name="xiao knechtges 1996 398"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1050"/&gt; Rafe de Crespigny, Tong Xiao, and David R. Knechtges claim that Zhang wrote this as an innuendo hinting at his inability to keep in contact with the emperor, hindered by unworthy rivals and petty men.&lt;ref name="xiao knechtges 1996 398"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1050"&gt;Crespigny (2007), 1050.&lt;/ref&gt; This poem is one of the first in China to have seven words per line.&lt;ref name="neinhauser 1986 212"/&gt; His "Four Sorrows" reads:

Zhang's long lyrical poems also revealed a great amount of information on urban layout and basic geography. His rhapsody "Sir Based-On-Nothing" provides details on terrain, palaces, hunting parks, markets, and prominent buildings of [[Chang'an]], the Western Han capital.&lt;ref name="neinhauser 1986 211"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lewis 2006 184"/&gt; Exemplifying his attention to detail, his rhapsody on Nanyang described gardens filled with spring garlic, summer [[bamboo shoot]]s, autumn leeks, winter rape-turnips, [[perilla]], [[tetradium|evodia]], and purple ginger.&lt;ref&gt;Knechtges (1997), 232.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang Heng's writing confirms the size of the imperial hunting park in the suburbs of Chang'an, as his estimate for the circumference of the park's encircling wall agrees with the historian Ban Gu's estimate of roughly 400&amp;nbsp;''[[Li (unit)|li]]'' (one li in Han times was equal to 415.8&amp;nbsp;m, or 1,364&amp;nbsp;ft, making the circumference of the park wall 166,320&amp;nbsp;m, or 545,600&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref&gt;Schafer (1968), 372 (footnote 2).&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Sima Xiangru]] (179–117&amp;nbsp;BC), Zhang listed a variety of animals and hunting game inhabiting the park, which were divided in the northern and southern portions of the park according to where the animals had originally came from: [[Northern and southern China|northern or southern China]].&lt;ref&gt;Schafer (1968), 329–330.&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhat similar to the description of Sima Xiangru, Zhang described the Western Han emperors and their entourage enjoying boat outings, water plays, fishing, and displays of archery targeting birds and other animals with stringed arrows from the tops of [[:Image:Earthenware architecture models, Eastern Han Dynasty, 1.JPG|tall towers]] along Chang'an's Kunming Lake.&lt;ref name="bulling 1962 312"&gt;Bulling (1962), 312 &amp; 314.&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of Zhang's writing on specific places and their terrain, society, people, and their customs could also be seen as early attempts of [[ethnographic]] categorization.&lt;ref name="lewis 2006 238"&gt;Lewis (2006), 238.&lt;/ref&gt; In his poem "Xijing fu", Zhang shows that he was aware of the new foreign religion of [[Buddhism]], introduced via the [[Silk Road]], as well as the legend of the birth of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] with the vision of the [[white elephant]] bringing about conception.&lt;ref&gt;Wu (1986), 271–272.&lt;/ref&gt; In his "Western Metropolis Rhapsody" (西京賦), Zhang described court entertainments such as ''juedi'' (角抵), a form of theatrical wrestling accompanied by music in which participants butted heads with bull horn masks.&lt;ref name="loewe 1990 142 144"&gt;Loewe (1990), 142–144.&lt;/ref&gt;

With his "Responding to Criticism" (''Ying jian'' 應間), a work modeled on [[Yang Xiong (author)|Yang Xiong's]] "Justification Against Ridicule",&lt;ref&gt;Fraser (2014): 370.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang was an early writer and proponent of the Chinese literary genre ''shelun'', or hypothetical discourse. Authors of this genre created a written dialogue between themselves and an imaginary person (or a real person of their entourage or association); the latter poses questions to the author on how to lead a successful life.&lt;ref name="declercq 1998 1-4"&gt;Declercq (1998), 1–4.&lt;/ref&gt; He also used it as a means to criticize himself for failing to obtain high office, but coming to the conclusion that the true gentleman displays virtue instead of greed for power.&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1050"/&gt; In this work, Dominik Declercq asserts that the person urging Zhang to advance his career in a time of government corruption most likely represented the eunuchs or [[Liang Na|Empress Liang]]'s (116–150) powerful relatives in the [[Liang (surname)|Liang clan]].&lt;ref name="declercq 1998 65"/&gt; Declercq states that these two groups would have been "anxious to know whether this famous scholar could be lured over to their side", but Zhang flatly rejected such an alignment by declaring in this politically charged piece of literature that his gentlemanly quest for virtue trumped any desire of his for power.&lt;ref&gt;Declercq (1998), 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhang wrote about the various love affairs of emperors dissatisfied with the imperial harem, going out into the city incognito to seek out prostitutes and sing-song girls. This was seen as a general criticism of the Eastern Han emperors and their imperial favorites, guised in the criticism of earlier Western Han emperors.&lt;ref name="lewis 2006 184-185"&gt;Lewis (2006), 184–185.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides criticizing the Western Han emperors for lavish decadence, Zhang also pointed out that their behavior and ceremonies did not properly conform with the Chinese cyclical beliefs in [[yin and yang]].&lt;ref&gt;Bulling (1962), 314–315.&lt;/ref&gt; In a poem criticizing the previous Western Han Dynasty, Zhang wrote:

For centuries the Chinese approximated [[pi]] as 3; [[Liu Xin (scholar)|Liu Xin]] (d. AD&amp;nbsp;23) made the first known Chinese attempt at a more accurate calculation of 3.1457,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_1AsFyM0d84C 中西數學史的比較(1991), 44-47]&lt;/ref&gt; but there is no record detailing the method he used to obtain this figure.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 99 100"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arndt haenel lischka 2001 176"/&gt; In his work around 130,&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 100"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang Heng compared the celestial circle to the diameter of the earth, proportioning the former as 736 and the latter as 232, thus calculating pi as 3.1724.&lt;ref name="berggren borwein 2004 27"&gt;Berggren, Borwein &amp; Borwein (2004), 27.&lt;/ref&gt; In Zhang's day, the ratio 4:3 was given for the area of a square to the area of its inscribed circle and the volume of a cube and volume of the inscribed sphere should also be 4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="berggren borwein 2004 27"/&gt; In formula, with D as diameter and V as volume, D&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;:V = 16:9 or V=&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{9}{16}&lt;/math&gt;D&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; Zhang realized that the value for diameter in this formula was inaccurate, noting the discrepancy as the value taken for the ratio.&lt;ref name="arndt haenel lischka 2001 176"&gt;Arndt, Haenel, &amp; Lischka (2001), 176.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="berggren borwein 2004 27"/&gt; Zhang then attempted to remedy this by amending the formula with an additional &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{16}&lt;/math&gt;D&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, hence V=&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{9}{16}&lt;/math&gt;D&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{16}&lt;/math&gt;D&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{5}{8}&lt;/math&gt;D&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="berggren borwein 2004 27"/&gt; With the ratio of the [[volume]] of the cube to the inscribed sphere at 8:5, the implied ratio of the area of the square to the circle is √&lt;span style = "text-decoration:overline"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;:√&lt;span style = "text-decoration:overline"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;ref name="berggren borwein 2004 27"/&gt;&lt;ref name="arndt haenel lischka 2001 177"&gt;Arndt, Haenel, &amp; Lischka (2001), 177.&lt;/ref&gt; From this formula, Zhang calculated pi as the [[square root]] of 10 (or approximately 3.162).&lt;ref name="yan 2007 128"&gt;Yan (2007), 128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1050"/&gt;&lt;ref name="berggren borwein 2004 27"/&gt;&lt;ref name="arndt haenel lischka 2001 177"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wilson 2001 16"&gt;Wilson (2001), 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang also calculated pi as &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{730}{232}&lt;/math&gt; = 3.1466 in his book ''Ling Xian'' (靈憲).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edp.ust.hk/previous/math/history/3/3_7.htm Education Development Program of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307094906/http://www.edp.ust.hk/previous/math/history/3/3_7.htm |date=March 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 3rd&amp;nbsp;century, [[Liu Hui]] made the calculation more accurate with his [[Liu Hui's π algorithm|π algorithm]], which allowed him to obtain the value 3.14159.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 100 101"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 100–101.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Zu Chongzhi]] (429–500) [[Milü|approximated pi]] as &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{355}{113}&lt;/math&gt; or 3.141592, the most accurate calculation for pi the ancient Chinese would achieve.&lt;ref&gt;Berggren, Borwein &amp; Borwein (2004), 20 &amp; 24–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his publication of AD&amp;nbsp;120 called ''The Spiritual Constitution of the Universe'' (靈憲, ''Ling Xian'', lit. "Sublime Model"),&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1050"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fraser (2014): 374.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang Heng theorized that the universe was like an egg "as round as a [[crossbow]] pellet" with the stars on the shell and the Earth as the central yolk.&lt;ref name="huang 1997 64"/&gt;&lt;ref name="balchin 2003 27"/&gt; This universe theory is congruent with the [[geocentric model]] as opposed to the [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric model]]. Although the ancient [[Warring States period|Warring States]] (403–221 BC) Chinese astronomers [[Shi Shen]] and [[Gan De]] had compiled China's first [[star catalogue]] in the 4th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BC, Zhang nonetheless catalogued 2,500 stars which he placed in a "brightly shining" category (the Chinese estimated the total to be 14,000), and he recognized 124&amp;nbsp;constellations.&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1050"/&gt;&lt;ref name="balchin 2003 27"&gt;Balchin (2003), 27.&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, this star catalogue featured many more stars than the 850 documented by the Greek astronomer [[Hipparchus]] (c. 190–c.120&amp;nbsp;BC) in his catalogue, and more than [[Ptolemy]] (AD&amp;nbsp;83–161), who catalogued over 1,000.&lt;ref name="jones 1991 1"&gt;Jones (1991), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang supported the "radiating influence" theory to explain [[solar eclipse|solar]] and [[lunar eclipse|lunar]] eclipses, a theory which was opposed by [[Wang Chong]] (AD&amp;nbsp;27–97).&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 411 413"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 411–413.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Ling Xian'', Zhang wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Sun is like fire and the Moon like water.  The fire gives out light and the water reflects it. Thus the moon's brightness is produced from the radiance of the Sun, and the Moon's darkness is due to (the light of) the sun being obstructed. The side which faces the Sun is fully lit, and the side which is away from it is dark. The planets (as well as the Moon) have the nature of water and reflect light. The light pouring forth from the Sun does not always reach the moon owing to the obstruction of the earth itself—this is called 'an-xu', a lunar eclipse. When (a similar effect) happens with a planet (we call it) an occultation; when the Moon passes across (the Sun's path) then there is a solar eclipse.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 414"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 414.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Zhang Heng viewed these astronomical phenomena in supernatural terms as well. The signs of comets, eclipses, and movements of heavenly bodies could all be interpreted by him as heavenly guides on how to conduct affairs of state.&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1050"/&gt; Contemporary writers also wrote about eclipses and the sphericity of heavenly bodies. The [[Music theory|music theorist]] and mathematician [[Jing Fang]] (78–37&amp;nbsp;BC) wrote about the spherical shape of the Sun and Moon while discussing eclipses:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Moon and the planets are Yin; they have shape but no light. This they receive only when the Sun illuminates them. The former masters regarded the Sun as round like a crossbow bullet, and they thought the Moon had the nature of a mirror. Some of them recognized the Moon as a ball too. Those parts of the Moon which the Sun illuminates look bright, those parts which it does not, remain dark.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 227"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 227.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The theory posited by Zhang and Jing was supported by later pre-modern scientists such as [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095), who expanded on the reasoning of why the Sun and Moon were spherical.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 415 416"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 415–416.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of the [[celestial sphere]] surrounding a [[Flat Earth|flat, square earth]] was later criticized by the [[Jin dynasty (265-420)|Jin-dynasty]] scholar-official [[Yu Xi]] (fl. 307-345). He suggested that the Earth could be round like the heavens, a [[spherical Earth]] theory fully accepted by mathematician [[Li Ye (mathematician)|Li Ye]] (1192-1279) but not by mainstream Chinese science until [[History of astronomy|European influence]] in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, pp. 220, 498-499.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extra tank for inflow clepsydra===
[[Image:Guardians of Day and Night, Han Dynasty.jpg|thumb|right|Han Dynasty paintings on [[tile]]; being conscious of time, the Chinese believed in [[Chinese mythology|guardian spirits]] for the divisions of day and night, such as these two guardians here representing 11 pm to 1 am (left) and 5 am to 7 am (right)]]
The outflow [[Water clock|clepsydra]] was a timekeeping device used in China as long ago as the [[Shang Dynasty]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1600–c.&amp;nbsp;1050&amp;nbsp;BC), and certainly by the [[Zhou Dynasty]] (1122–256&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 2 479"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 479.&lt;/ref&gt; The inflow clepsydra with an indicator rod on a float had been known in China since the beginning of the Han Dynasty in 202&amp;nbsp;BC and had replaced the outflow type.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 2 479"/&gt; The [[Han Chinese]] noted the problem with the falling [[pressure head]] in the reservoir, which slowed the timekeeping of the device as the inflow vessel was filled.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 2 479"/&gt; Zhang Heng was the first to address this problem, indicated in his writings from 117, by adding an extra compensating tank between the reservoir and the inflow vessel.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 2 479 footnote e"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1050"/&gt; Zhang also mounted two statuettes of a Chinese immortal and a heavenly guard on the top of the inflow clepsydra, the two of which would guide the indicator rod with their left hand and point out the graduations with their right.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 2 164"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Needham states that this was perhaps the ancestor of all [[Striking clock|clock jacks that would later sound the hours]] found in mechanical clocks by the 8th century, but he notes that these figures did not actually move like clock jack figurines or sound the hours.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 2 164"/&gt; Many additional compensation tanks were added to later clepsydras in the tradition of Zhang Heng. In 610 the [[Sui Dynasty]] (581–618) engineers Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai crafted an unequal-armed [[steelyard balance]] able to make seasonal adjustments in the pressure head of the compensating tank, so that it could control the rate of water flow for different lengths of day and night during the year.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 2 480"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 480.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang mentioned a "jade dragon's neck", which in later times meant a siphon.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 320"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 320.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote of the floats and indicator-rods of the inflow clepsydra as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Bronze vessels are made and placed one above the other at different levels; they are filled with pure water. Each has at the bottom a small opening in the form of a 'jade dragon's neck'. The water dripping (from above) enters two inflow receivers (alternately), the left one being for the night and the right one for the day. On the covers of each (inflow receiver) there are small cast statuettes in gilt bronze; the left (night) one is an immortal and the right (day) one is a policeman. These figures guide the indicator-rod (lit. arrow) with their left hands, and indicate the graduations on it with their right hands, thus giving the time.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 320"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Water-powered armillary sphere===
[[Image:Clock Tower from Su Song's Book desmear.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The original diagram of [[Su Song]]'s (1020–1101) [[clock tower]], featuring an [[armillary sphere]] powered by a [[waterwheel]], [[escapement]] mechanism, and [[chain drive]]]]

Zhang Heng is the first person known to have applied hydraulic [[motive power]] (i.e. by employing a [[waterwheel]] and [[Water clock|clepsydra]]) to rotate an [[armillary sphere]], an astronomical instrument representing the [[celestial sphere]].&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 2 30"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="morton 2005 70"&gt;Morton (2005), 70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="loewe 1968 107"&gt;Loewe (1968), 107.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek astronomer [[Eratosthenes]] (276–194&amp;nbsp;BC) invented the first armillary sphere in 255&amp;nbsp;BC. The Chinese armillary sphere was fully developed by 52&amp;nbsp;BC, with the astronomer Geng Shouchang's addition of a permanently fixed equatorial ring.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 343"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 343.&lt;/ref&gt; In AD 84&amp;nbsp; the astronomers Fu An and Jia Kui added the ecliptic ring, and finally Zhang Heng added the horizon and meridian rings.&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1050"/&gt;&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 343"/&gt; This invention is described and attributed to Zhang in quotations by Hsu Chen and Li Shan, referencing his book ''Lou Shui Chuan Hun Thien I Chieh'' (Apparatus for Rotating an Armillary Sphere by Clepsydra Water). It was likely not an actual book by Zhang, but a chapter from his ''Hun I'' or ''Hun I Thu Chu'', written in 117 AD.&lt;ref name="needham 1965 volume 4 part 1 486"&gt;Needham (1965), Volume 4, Part 1, 486&lt;/ref&gt; His water-powered armillary influenced the design of later Chinese water clocks and led to the discovery of the [[escapement]] mechanism by the 8th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 2 532"/&gt; The historian [[Joseph Needham]] (1900–1995) states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What were the factors leading to the first escapement clock in China? The chief tradition leading to Yi Xing (AD 725&amp;nbsp;) was of course the succession of 'pre-clocks' which had started with Zhang Heng about 125. Reason has been given for believing that these applied power to the slow turning movement of computational armillary spheres and celestial globes by means of a water-wheel using clepsydra drip, which intermittently exerted the force of a lug to act on the teeth of a wheel on a polar-axis shaft. Zhang Heng in his turn had composed this arrangement by uniting the armillary rings of his predecessors into the equatorial armillary sphere, and combining it with the principles of the water-mills and hydraulic trip-hammers which had become so widespread in Chinese culture in the previous century.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 2 532"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 532.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Zhang did not initiate the Chinese tradition of [[hydraulic engineering]], which began during the mid Zhou Dynasty (c.&amp;nbsp;6th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BC), through the work of engineers such as [[Sunshu Ao]] and [[Ximen Bao]].&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 3 271"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 3, 271.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang's contemporary, [[Du Shi]], (d.&amp;nbsp;AD&amp;nbsp;38) was the first to apply the motive power of waterwheels to operate the [[bellows]] of a [[blast furnace]] to make [[pig iron]], and the [[cupola furnace]] to make [[cast iron]].&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 2 370"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 370.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (2001), 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang provided a valuable description of his water-powered armillary sphere in the treatise of 125, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The equatorial ring goes around the belly of the armillary sphere 91 and 5/19 (degrees) away from the pole. The circle of the ecliptic also goes round the belly of the instrument at an angle of 24 (degrees) with the equator. Thus at the summer solstice the ecliptic is 67 (degrees) and a fraction away from the pole, while at the winter solstice it is 115 (degrees) and a fraction away. Hence (the points) where the ecliptic and the equator intersect should give the north polar distances of the spring and autumn equinoxes. But now (it has been recorded that) the spring equinox is 90 and 1/4 (degrees) away from the pole, and the autumn equinox is 92 and 1/4 (degrees) away. The former figure is adopted only because it agrees with the (results obtained by the) method of measuring solstitial sun shadows as embodied in the Xia (dynasty) calendar.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 355-356"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 355–356.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Zhang Heng's water-powered armillary sphere had profound effects on Chinese astronomy and mechanical engineering in later generations. His model and its complex use of gears greatly influenced the water-powered instruments of later astronomers such as [[Yi Xing]] (683–727), [[Zhang Sixun]] (fl.&amp;nbsp;10th&amp;nbsp;century), [[Su Song]] (1020–1101), [[Guo Shoujing]] (1231–1316), and many others. Water-powered armillary spheres in the tradition of Zhang Heng's were used in the eras of the [[Three Kingdoms]] (220–280) and [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin Dynasty]] (265–420), yet the design for it was temporarily out of use between 317 and 418, due to invasions of northern [[Xiongnu]] nomads.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 2 483"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 483.&lt;/ref&gt;  Zhang Heng's old instruments were recovered in 418, when [[Emperor Wu of Liu Song]] (r.&amp;nbsp;420–422) captured the ancient capital of Chang'an. Although still intact, the graduation marks and the representations of the stars, Moon, Sun, and planets were quite worn down by time and rust.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 2 483"/&gt;  In 436, the emperor ordered Qian Luozhi, the Secretary of the Bureau of Astronomy and Calendar, to recreate Zhang's device, which he managed to do successfully.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 2 483"/&gt;  Qian's water-powered celestial globe was still in use at the time of the Liang Dynasty (502–557), and successive models of water-powered armillary spheres were designed in subsequent dynasties.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 2 483"/&gt;

===Zhang's seismoscope===
[[Image:EastHanSeismograph.JPG|thumbnail|right|250px|A replica of Zhang Heng's seismoscope, the ''Houfeng didong yi'', featured in the [[Chabot Space &amp; Science Center]] in Oakland, California]]

From the earliest times, the Chinese were concerned with the destructive force of earthquakes. It was recorded in Sima Qian's ''Records of the Grand Historian'' of 91&amp;nbsp;BC that in 780&amp;nbsp;BC an earthquake had been powerful enough to divert the courses of three rivers.&lt;ref name = "needham 1986 volume 3 624"/&gt; It was not known at the time that earthquakes were caused by the shifting of [[tectonic plate]]s in the Earth's crust; instead, the people of the ancient Zhou Dynasty explained them as disturbances with cosmic [[yin and yang]], along with the heavens' displeasure with acts committed (or the common peoples' grievances ignored) by the current ruling dynasty.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 624"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 624.&lt;/ref&gt; These theories were ultimately derived from the ancient text of the ''[[I Ching|Yijing]]'' (Book of Changes), in its fifty-first hexagram.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 625"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 625.&lt;/ref&gt; There were other early theories about earthquakes, developed by those such as the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]]. [[Anaxagoras]] (c.&amp;nbsp;500–428&amp;nbsp;BC) believed that they were caused by excess water near the surface crust of the earth bursting into the Earth's hollows; [[Democritus]] (c. 460–370&amp;nbsp;BC) believed that the saturation of the Earth with water caused them; [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] (c.&amp;nbsp;585–c.&amp;nbsp;525&amp;nbsp;BC) believed they were the result of massive pieces of the Earth falling into the cavernous hollows due to drying; and [[Aristotle]] (384–322&amp;nbsp;BC) believed they were caused by instability of vapor (''pneuma'') caused by the drying of the moist Earth by the Sun's rays.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 625"/&gt;

During the Han Dynasty, many learned scholars—including Zhang Heng—believed in the "[[oracle]]s of the winds".&lt;ref&gt;Loewe (1988), 509, 513, 515.&lt;/ref&gt; These oracles of the occult observed the direction, force, and timing of the winds, to speculate about the operation of the cosmos and to predict events on Earth.&lt;ref name="loewe 1988 509"&gt;Loewe (1988), 509.&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas influenced Zhang Heng's views on the cause of earthquakes. Against the grain of earlier theories proposed by his fellow Chinese and contemporary Greeks, Zhang Heng believed that earthquakes were caused by wind and air, writing:

{{quote|The chief cause of earthquake is air, an element naturally swift and shifting from place to place. As long as it is not stirred, but lurks in a vacant space, it reposes innocently, giving no trouble to objects around it. But any cause coming upon it from without rouses it, or compresses it, and drives it into a narrow space&amp;nbsp;... and when opportunity of escape is cut off, then 'With deep murmur of the Mountain it roars around the barriers', which after long battering it dislodges and tosses on high, growing more fierce the stronger the obstacle with which it has contended.&lt;ref name = "needham 1986 volume 3 626"/&gt;}}

In 132, Zhang Heng presented to the Han court what many historians consider to be his most impressive invention, the first seismoscope. A seismoscope records the motions of Earth's shaking, but unlike a seismometer, it does not retain a time record of those motions.&lt;ref name="stein wysession 2002 400"&gt;Stein and Wysession (2002), 400.&lt;/ref&gt; It was named "earthquake weathervane" (''houfeng didongyi'' 候風地動儀),&lt;ref&gt;Fraser (2014): 375.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was able to roughly determine  the direction (out of eight directions) where the earthquake came from.&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1050"/&gt;&lt;ref name="morton 2005 70"/&gt; According to the ''[[Book of Later Han]]'' (compiled by [[Fan Ye (historian)|Fan Ye]] in the 5th&amp;nbsp;century), his bronze urn-shaped device, with a swinging pendulum inside, was able to detect the direction of an earthquake hundreds of miles/kilometers away.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 2 484"&gt;Neehdam (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 484.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="loewe 1968 106"&gt;Loewe (1968), 106.&lt;/ref&gt; This was essential for the Han government in sending quick aid and relief to regions devastated by this natural disaster.&lt;ref name="wright 2001 66"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 484; Needham (1986), Volume 3, 632.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dillon 1998 378"/&gt; The ''Book of Later Han'' records that, on one occasion, Zhang's device was triggered, though no observer had felt any seismic disturbance; several days later a messenger arrived from the west and reported that an earthquake had occurred in Longxi (modern [[Gansu Province]]), the same direction that Zhang's device had indicated, and thus the court was forced to admit the efficacy of the device.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser (2014): 376.&lt;/ref&gt;

To indicate the direction of a distant earthquake, Zhang's device dropped a bronze ball from one of eight tubed projections shaped as dragon heads; the ball fell into the mouth of a corresponding metal object shaped as a toad, each representing a direction like the points on a [[compass rose]].&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 627–628.&lt;/ref&gt; His device had eight mobile arms (for all eight directions) connected with cranks having catch mechanisms at the periphery.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 629"/&gt; When tripped, a crank and right angle lever would raise a dragon head and release a ball which had been supported by the lower jaw of the dragon head.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 629"/&gt; His device also included a vertical pin passing through a slot in the crank, a catch device, a pivot on a projection, a sling suspending the pendulum, an attachment for the sling, and a horizontal bar supporting the pendulum.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 629"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 629.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wang Zhenduo|Wang Zhenduo (王振鐸)]] argued that the technology of the Eastern Han era was sophisticated enough to produce such a device, as evidenced by contemporary levers and cranks used in other devices such as crossbow triggers.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 630"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 630.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Akitsune Imamura.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Japanese seismologist [[Akitsune Imamura]], who reconstructed Zhang Heng's seismoscope in 1939 while working at [[Tokyo University]]]]
Later Chinese of subsequent periods were able to reinvent Zhang's seismoscope. They included the 6th-century mathematician and surveyor [[Xindu Fang]] of the [[Northern Qi|Northern Qi Dynasty]] (550–577) and the astronomer and mathematician [[Lin Xiaogong]] of the [[Sui Dynasty]] (581–618).&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 632 633"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 632–633.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Zhang, Xindu Fang and Lin Xiaogong were given imperial patronage for their services in craftsmanship of devices for the court.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 633"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 633.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1271–1368), it was acknowledged that all devices previously made were preserved, except for that of the seismoscope.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 633 634"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 633–634.&lt;/ref&gt; This was discussed by the scholar Zhou Mi around 1290, who remarked that the books of Xindu Fang and Lin Xiaogong detailing their seismological devices were no longer to be found.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 633 634"/&gt; Horwitz, Kreitner, and Needham speculate if [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907) era seismographs found their way to contemporary [[Japan]]; according to Needham, "instruments of apparently traditional type there in which a pendulum carries pins projecting in many directions and able to pierce a surrounding paper cylinder, have been described."&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 635"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 635.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hong-sen Yan states that modern replicas of Zhang's device have failed to reach the level of accuracy and sensitivity described in Chinese historical records.&lt;ref name="yan 2007 131"&gt;Yan (2007), 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Wang Zhenduo presented two different models of the seismoscope based on the ancient descriptions of Zhang's device.&lt;ref name="yan 2007 131 132"&gt;Yan (2007), 131–132.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1936 reconstruction, the central pillar (''du zhu'') of the device was a suspended pendulum acting as a movement sensor, while the central pillar of his second model in 1963 was an [[inverted pendulum]].&lt;ref name="yan 2007 131 132"/&gt; According to Needham, while working in the Seismological Observatory of [[Tokyo University]] in 1939, [[Akitsune Imamura]] and Hagiwara made a reconstruction of Zhang's device.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 630"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yan 2007 132"&gt;Yan (2007), 132.&lt;/ref&gt; While it was John Milne and Wang Zhenduo who argued early on that Zhang's "central pillar" was a suspended pendulum, Imamura was the first to propose an inverted model.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 628 630"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 628 &amp; 630.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that transverse shock would have rendered Wang's immobilization mechanism ineffective, as it would not have prevented further motion that could knock other balls out of their position.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 630"/&gt; On June 13, 2005, modern Chinese seismologists announced that they had successfully created a replica of the instrument.&lt;ref&gt;[[People's Daily|People's Daily Online]] (June 13, 2005).

Anthony J. Barbieri-Low, a Professor of Early Chinese History at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], names Zhang Heng as one of several high-ranking Eastern-Han officials who engaged in crafts that were traditionally reserved for artisans (''gong'' 工), such as mechanical engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Barbieri-Low (2007), 201–203.&lt;/ref&gt; Barbieri-Low speculates that Zhang only designed his seismoscope, but did not actually craft the device himself. He asserts that this would most likely have been the job of artisans commissioned by Zhang.&lt;ref name="barbieri low 2007 204"&gt;Barbieri-Low (2007), 204.&lt;/ref&gt; He writes: "Zhang Heng was an official of moderately high rank and could not be seen sweating in the foundries with the ''gong'' artisans and the government slaves. Most likely, he worked collaboratively with the professional casters and mold makers in the imperial workshops."&lt;ref name="barbieri low 2007 204"/&gt;

===Cartography===
[[File:Western Han Mawangdui Silk Map.JPG|thumb|An early Western-Han (202 BC&amp;nbsp;– AD 9) [[silk]] map found in tomb 3 of [[Mawangdui]], depicting the Kingdom of [[Changsha]] and Kingdom of [[Nanyue]] in southern China (note: the south direction is oriented at the top, north at the bottom).]]

The [[Cao Wei|Wei]] (220–265) and [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Jin Dynasty]] (265–420) [[History of cartography#China|cartographer]] and official [[Pei Xiu]] (224–271) was the first in China to describe in full the geometric [[grid reference]] for maps that allowed for precise measurements [[Scale (map)|using a graduated scale]], as well as topographical [[elevation]].&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 538–540.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hsu 1993 97"&gt;Hsu (1993), 97.&lt;/ref&gt; However, map-making in China had existed since at least the 4th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BC with the [[Qin (state)|Qin state]] maps found in [[Gansu]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Hsu (1993), 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Pinpointed accuracy of the winding courses of rivers and familiarity with scaled distance had been known since the [[Qin Dynasty|Qin]] and Han Dynasty, respectively, as evidenced by their existing maps, while the use of a rectangular [[Grid graph|grid]] had been known in China since the Han as well.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 106 107"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hsu 1993 90 97"&gt;Hsu (1993), 90 &amp; 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Howard Nelson states that, although the accounts of Zhang Heng's work in cartography are somewhat vague and sketchy, there is ample written evidence that Pei Xiu derived the use of the rectangular grid reference from the maps of Zhang Heng.&lt;ref name="nelson 1974 359"&gt;Nelson (1974), 359.&lt;/ref&gt; Rafe de Crespigny asserts that it was Zhang who established the rectangular grid system in Chinese cartography.&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 1050"/&gt; Needham points out that the title of his book ''Flying Bird Calendar'' may have been a mistake, and that the book is more accurately entitled ''Bird's Eye Map''.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 538. "the title may have referred to a Bird's Eye Map&amp;nbsp;... that Chang Heng occupied himself with map-making is sure&amp;nbsp;... a physical geograph map was presented by him"&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Florian C. Reiter notes that Zhang's narrative "Guitian fu" contains a phrase about applauding the maps and documents of [[Confucius]] of the Zhou Dynasty, which Reiter suggests places maps (''tu'') on a same level of importance with documents (''shu'').&lt;ref&gt;Reiter (1990), 320.&lt;/ref&gt; It is documented that a physical geography map was first presented by Zhang Heng in 116 AD, called a ''Ti Hsing Thu''.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 538.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Odometer and south-pointing chariot===
Zhang Heng is often credited with inventing the first [[odometer]],&lt;ref name="yan 2007 128"/&gt;&lt;ref name="balchin 2003 27"/&gt; an achievement also attributed to [[Archimedes]] (c.&amp;nbsp;287–212&amp;nbsp;BC) and [[Heron of Alexandria]] (fl.&amp;nbsp;AD&amp;nbsp;10–70). Similar devices were used by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and Han-Chinese empires at about the same period. By the 3rd&amp;nbsp;century, the Chinese had termed the device the ''ji li gu che'', or "[[li (unit)|li]]-recording drum carriage" (the modern measurement of li&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;500&amp;nbsp;m/1640&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 281"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Han dynasty odometer cart.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Odometer]] cart from a stone rubbing of an Eastern Han Dynasty tomb, c. 125]]
Ancient Chinese texts describe the mechanical carriage's functions; after one li was traversed, a mechanically driven wooden figure struck a drum, and after ten li had been covered, another wooden figure struck a gong or a bell with its mechanically operated arm.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 281"/&gt; However, there is evidence to suggest that the invention of the odometer was a gradual process in Han Dynasty China that centered on the "huang men"—court people (i.e. eunuchs, palace officials, attendants and familiars, actors, acrobats, etc.) who followed the musical procession of the royal "drum-chariot".&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 283"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, 283.&lt;/ref&gt; There is speculation that at some time during the 1st&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BC the beating of drums and gongs was mechanically driven by the rotation of the road wheels.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 283"/&gt; This might have actually been the design of [[Luoxia Hong]] (c.&amp;nbsp;110&amp;nbsp;BC), yet by at least 125 the mechanical odometer carriage was already known, as it was depicted in a mural of the Xiao Tang Shan Tomb.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 283"/&gt;

The [[south-pointing chariot]] was another mechanical device credited to Zhang Heng.&lt;ref name="yan 2007 128"/&gt; It was a non-magnetic compass   vehicle in the form of a two-wheeled chariot. [[differential (mechanical device)|Differential gears]] driven by the chariot's wheels allowed a wooden figurine (in the shape of a Chinese state minister) to constantly point to the south, hence its name. The ''Song Shu'' (c.&amp;nbsp;AD 500&amp;nbsp;) records that Zhang Heng re-invented it from a model used in the Zhou Dynasty era, but the violent collapse of the Han Dynasty unfortunately did not allow it to be preserved. Whether Zhang Heng invented it or not, [[Ma Jun]] (200–265) succeeded in creating the chariot in the following century.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 2 40"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

===Science and technology===
[[Image:Astrology della Robbia OPA Florence.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[Florence|Florentine]] marble carving of [[Ptolemy]] (86–161), who created an Earth-centered universe theory that the scholars Jin Guantao, Fan Hongye, and Liu Qingfeng compare with Zhang Heng's theory published in 125&lt;ref name="jin fan liu 1996 170"/&gt;]]

Zhang Heng's mechanical inventions influenced later Chinese inventors such as Yi Xing, Zhang Sixun, Su Song, and Guo Shoujing. Su Song directly named Zhang's water-powered armillary sphere as the inspiration for his 11th-century [[clock tower]].&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 2 466"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 466.&lt;/ref&gt; The cosmic model of nine points of Heaven corresponding with nine regions of earth conceived in the work of the scholar-official [[Chen Hongmou]] (1696–1771) followed in the tradition of Zhang's book ''Spiritual Constitution of the Universe''.&lt;ref name="rowe 2001 88"&gt;Rowe (2001), 88.&lt;/ref&gt; The seismologist John Milne, who created the modern seismograph in 1876 alongside Thomas Gray and [[James Alfred Ewing|James A. Ewing]] at the [[Imperial College of Engineering]] in [[Tokyo]], commented in 1886 on Zhang Heng's contributions to [[seismology]].&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 626"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 626.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yan 2007 124"&gt;Yan (2007), 124.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Joseph Needham emphasized his contributions to pre-modern Chinese technology, stating that Zhang was noted even in his day for being able to "make three wheels rotate as if they were one."&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 85"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt; More than one scholar has described Zhang as a [[polymath]].&lt;ref name="yan 2007 127"/&gt;&lt;ref name="krebs 2003 31"&gt;Krebs (2003), 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mair 2001 251"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dillon 1998 378"&gt;Dillon (1998), 378.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some scholars also point out that Zhang's writing lacks concrete scientific theories.&lt;ref name="jin fan liu 1996 170"&gt;Jin, Fan, and Liu (1996), 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing Zhang with his contemporary, Ptolemy (83–161) of [[History of Roman Egypt|Roman Egypt]], Jin Guantao, Fan Hongye, and Liu Qingfeng state:

::Based on the theories of his predecessors, Zhang Heng systematically developed the celestial sphere theory. An armillary constructed on the basis of his hypotheses bears a remarkable similarity to Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. However, Zhang Heng did not definitely propose a theoretical model like Ptolemy's earth-centered one. It is astonishing that the celestial model Zhang Heng constructed was almost a physical model of Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. Only a single step separates the celestial globe from the earth-centered theory, but Chinese astronomers never took that step.

::Here we can see how important the exemplary function of the primitive scientific structure is. In order to use the Euclidean system of geometry as a model for the development of astronomical theory, Ptolemy first had to select hypotheses which could serve as axioms. He naturally regarded circular motion as fundamental and then used the circular motion of deferents and epicycles in his earth-centered theory. Although Zhang Heng understood that the sun, moon and planets move in circles, he lacked a model for a logically structured theory and so could not establish a corresponding astronomical theory. Chinese astronomy was most interested in extracting the algebraic features of planetary motion (that is, the length of the cyclic periods) to establish astronomical theories. Thus astronomy was reduced to arithmetic operations, extracting common multiples and divisors from the observed cyclic motions of the heavenly bodies.&lt;ref name="jin fan liu 1996 170"/&gt;

===Poetic literature===
Zhang's poetry was widely read during his life and after his death. In addition to the compilation of Xiao Tong mentioned above, the [[Eastern Wu]] official [[Xue Zong]] (d. 237) wrote commentary on Zhang's poems "Dongjing fu" and "Xijing fu".&lt;ref&gt;Cutter (1984), 11 (footnote 61), 15, (footnote 80), 26 (footnote 141).&lt;/ref&gt; The influential poet Tao Qian wrote that he admired the poetry of Zhang Heng for its "curbing extravagant diction and aiming at simplicity", in regards to perceived tranquility and rectitude correlating with the simple but effective language of the poet.&lt;ref&gt;Yim-tze (1989), 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Tao wrote that both Zhang Heng and Cai Yong "avoided inflated language, aiming chiefly at simplicity", and adding that their "compositions begin by giving free expression to their fancies but end on a note of quiet, serving admirably to restrain undisciplined and passionate nature".&lt;ref name="hightower 1954 169 170"&gt;Hightower (1954), 169–170.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Posthumous honors===
Zhang was given great honors in life and in death. The philosopher and poet [[Fu Xuan]] (217–278) of the [[Cao Wei|Wei]] and [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin]] dynasties once lamented in an essay over the fact that Zhang Heng was never placed in the [[Nine Ministers|Ministry of Works]]. Writing highly of Zhang and the 3rd-century mechanical engineer Ma Jun, Fu Xuan wrote, "Neither of them was ever an official of the Ministry of Works, and their ingenuity did not benefit the world. When (authorities) employ personnel with no regard to special talent, and having heard of genius neglect even to test it—is this not hateful and disastrous?"&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 42"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In honor of Zhang's achievements in science and technology, his friend Cui Ziyu (Cui Yuan) wrote a memorial inscription on his burial stele, which has been preserved in the ''Guwen yuan''.&lt;ref name="xiao knechtges 1996 398"&gt;Xiao &amp; Knechtges (1996), 398.&lt;/ref&gt; Cui stated, "[Zhang Heng's] mathematical computations exhausted (the riddles of) the heavens and the earth. His inventions were comparable even to those of the Author of Change. The excellence of his talent and the splendour of his art were one with those of the gods."&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 359"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 359.&lt;/ref&gt; The minor official Xiahou Zhan (243–291) of the Wei Dynasty made an inscription for his own commemorative stele to be placed at Zhang Heng's tomb. It read: "Ever since gentlemen have composed literary texts, none has been as skillful as the Master [Zhang Heng] in choosing his words well&amp;nbsp;... if only the dead could rise, oh I could then turn to him for a teacher!"&lt;ref name="declercq 1998 247"&gt;Declercq (1998), 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several things have been named after Zhang in modern times, including the lunar crater [[Chang Heng (crater)|Chang Heng]],&lt;ref&gt;''Lunar Names Proposed'', 290.&lt;/ref&gt; the asteroid [[1802 Zhang Heng]],&lt;ref name="schmadel 2003 144"&gt;Schmadel (2003), 144.&lt;/ref&gt; and the mineral [[Zhanghengite]]. In 2018, China launched a research satellite called China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite (CSES) which is also named Zhangheng-1 (ZH-1).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/02/long-march-2d-zhangheng-1-earthquake-investigator/|title=Long March 2D launches Zhangheng-1 Earthquake investigator – NASASpaceFlight.com|website=www.nasaspaceflight.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
