'''''BookWars''''' is an award-winning independent film from New York City by Jason "Jack RO" Rosette [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0742891/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1] produced by [[Camerado]], about the life and times of [[New York City]] street booksellers. Made on an ultra-low budget in a jazzy, impressionistic style reminiscent of the films of [[Robert Frank]] and poetry of the [[Beat Generation]], ''BookWars'' is the only first-person documentary made during then-New York City Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani|Rudolph Giuliani]]'s controversial "Quality of Life" campaign, which sought to limit and control individuals engaged in informal economic activities on the streets of New York City.

''BookWars'' was released in June 2000, winning the Best Documentary Award at the 2000 [[New York Underground Film Festival]] [http://www.indiewire.com/article/daily_news_nyuff_and_santa_barbara_award_winners/ IndieWire] and premiering theatrically at New York's Cinema Village [https://web.archive.org/web/20090912095833/http://www.cinemavillage.com/chc/cv/]. Despite its minuscule budget (estimated at $10,000, prerelease) ''BookWars'' enjoyed numerous domestic and international TV sales and has to date generated revenue of several hundred thousand dollars.

The movie is currently available on DVD, VOD, VCD (Asia), digital download, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bookwars|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRqST3lljmE}}&lt;/ref&gt;YouTube, theatrical film prints, and other formats.

==Synopsis==
"''BookWars'' is: The gritty, untamed world of street booksellers, exposed in a remarkable feature film that chronicles their lives and loves and their unique perspectives on life. Shot entirely on location by fellow street bookseller and filmmaker Jason Rosette, and produced by James and John Montoya, Alan Fulford and filmmaker Michel Negroponte, ''BookWars'' explores the other side of the book tables that line the streets of New York City’s Greenwich Village, the Lower East Side, 6th avenue, and elsewhere in New York City."

==Plot==
''BookWars'' is a creative [[documentary]] which is told in an unconventional, narrative style. The film opens with the narrator (who is also the film's director) driving out West along a desert highway, relating to the audience his previous experiences as a streetside [[bookseller]] in [[New York City]]. The entire documentary – including the central events involving his experiences among the street booksellers in New York – is thus "told" as a long conversation.

The narrator describes his post-graduation years in New York, and how he ended up at one point virtually penniless. Driven by a desperate need to pay the rent, he resorts to wheeling his own books out to the street to try to sell them. He reveals that he was not only successful in making a significant amount of cash on that first day, but he has also met a variety of interesting and strange characters of the streets of New York – including other street booksellers.

A motley assortment of street booksellers on West 4th street, in [[Greenwich Village]], New York City, are first introduced. Among them: “Slick” Rick Sherman, a semi-professional magician; Al Mappo, so named because he only sells maps and atlases; Emil, who says only he "escaped”, though we do not know from where; and Pete Whitney: King of the booksellers, toad collector, and collage artist.

''BookWars'' next introduces another group of street booksellers who hawk their trade on nearby 6th Avenue. Mainly black and minority individuals, they ply books and magazines in parallel fashion to the nearby West 4th street booksellers, who are primarily white. The booksellers on 6th Avenue suffer greater exposure to the law, with many claiming this to be due to [[racial profiling]].

Some of the significant personalities that are introduced on 6th Avenue include: Marvin, always wearing his trademark black hat; and Ron, from Jamaica – charismatic, streetwise and outspoken.

After the introduction of the primary characters (including the narrator bookseller himself), ''BookWars'' discusses, mainly through informal testimony, the various aspects of the street bookseller’s life in chapter-by-chapter fashion.

The tools and tricks of the street bookseller's trade are revealed: ways and techniques to maximize income; how to deal with difficult, and sometimes dangerous customers; where and how to get more books; how the booksellers have a right to distribute literature (commercially or otherwise) in public, as per the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]; and so on.

''BookWars'' is structured as a “year in the life” style movie, although it was actually produced over several seasons, from 1995 to 1999. When Winter comes, and the streets are too snow-filled and cold to hawk books, the booksellers are shown in their various off-season modes and occupations. “Slick” Rick performs card and magic tricks at parties; Pete Whitney grooms cats for old ladies; and the narrator heads out to New Mexico to work on a [[Western (genre)|Western]]*.

(*Which was actually the movie ''The Desperate Trail'' [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109607/ IMDB])

Marv and Ron, however, continue to sell books throughout the winter on busy 6th Avenue, and the film follows them as they scour for books and pornographic magazines in the trash in Soho.

Finally, Spring comes, and the booksellers emerge from their off-season to sell books as usual for another season – or so they think. ''BookWars'' proceeds to reveal the street-level effects of then-New York City Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]]’s controversial “[[Quality of Life]]” campaign, which sought to remove informal, unregistered entrepreneurs and other individuals from the streets of New York City.

The NYPD [http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/home/home.shtml] begins to enforce obscure technicalities which govern the uses and dimensions of the sidewalks, thereby making it more difficult to earn a livelihood. A new tax identification number requirement is introduced, creating bureaucratic obstacles, especially for those street booksellers who are marginal or virtually homeless. Nearby [[New York University]] unlawfully places imposing, massive planters on the sidewalk in an attempt to drive the street booksellers away; and finally, especially on 6th Avenue where the majority of black street booksellers are active, the NYPD comes to haul away books.

The street booksellers resist and assemble to form an unlikely common front to protest against the actions of the city. Others, who have had their books confiscated, wait for hours at the police station to get them back. Still others, like Ron, rail against the futility of the city's efforts to stop New Yorkers from reading, because of their virtual addiction to books.

In the end, the street booksellers stand their ground against the Mayor, and are able to continue selling with minor adjustments to their way of life.

In the closing moments of ''BookWars'', the narrator admits that after all the recent problems with the city, he has grown restless; he realizes that he wants to do something different, and wants to change his occupation at last. A single massive rainstorm is enough to convince him to give up his street bookselling activities.

He sells the last of his books off to his fellow street booksellers, and heads out West, on a cross-country road trip, with the audience in the passenger seat sharing the ride.

==Cast==
The Street Booksellers of New York City

==Production==
The concept for ''BookWars'' was developed after a chance meeting between filmmaker Jason Rosette—who had been selling used and out of print books at a streetside bookstand to generate cash between film production and editing jobs—and [[Emmy Award]]-winning New York-based documentary filmmaker Michel Negroponte, at Mr. Rosette’s sidewalk bookstand in 1995. 

Mr. Rosette and fellow bookseller 'Slick' Rick Sherman had already been bringing a video camera on occasion to the book stand to document fellow booksellers and day-to-day life on the streets and sidewalks of New York. With a documentary concept in place, he began to bring a video camera daily to document the sights and sounds of the city of New York as seen from the perspective of a sidewalk bookseller. Because this initial phase of shooting was funded completely out of pocket, ''BookWars'' was produced in a variety of film and video formats depending on whatever camera was available at the time. Formats included: Mini DV, Super 8 film, Regular 8 and Hi-8 video, and Super VHS. The aesthetic goals of immediacy and a natural, unobtrusive presence of the camera also demanded the use of small format film and video.

Initial shooting was financed by the sale of the various used and out-of-print books at the filmmaker's bookstand. As more books were sold, more film and video stock could be bought, and production would continue.

Following the initial stage of shooting in New York, the director drove from New York to [[New Mexico]] where he had edited an earlier movie at a colleague's [[Albuquerque]]-based production studio. In New Mexico in 1996, the first assembly of the movie, called ''The Book Wars'', was edited on a tape-to-tape analogue system; that rough assembly was screened for the first time in on [[Super Bowl Sunday]] as part of an exhibition produced by Basement Films [http://www.basementfilms.org] of Albuquerque.

Given that desktop editing solutions were not widely used or available at the time - and were expensive to rent - the filmmaker next drove out to [[Los Angeles]] with the assembly edit in hand, in order to attempt to secure access to one of the two primary nonlinear systems available at the time – an [[Avid Technology|Avid]] or [[Media 100]] system.

While the filmmaker sought post-production equipment in Los Angeles, a [[San Francisco]]- based production company, S.A.I.D. Communications, viewed the assembly edit of ''BookWars'' and agreed to provide additional editing and production in order to complete the picture. Mr. Rosette subsequently departed Los Angeles for San Francisco, and commenced to work on editing the documentary there full-time.

There was no up-front money to continue editing and still no funding, so the director worked a variety of jobs to sustain himself and production of the movie, working as a freelance film editor, voice-over artist, and an assortment of temporary and odd jobs.

A rough cut of ''BookWars'' was finally achieved in 1998. However, additional material was required to create a coherent feature edit. S.A.I.D Communications provided a camera on loan, and the director headed back to New York to spend time once again with his fellow booksellers to continue documenting their lives.

After this second stage of shooting in New York was complete, in 1998, the director returned to San Francisco to include the additional essential sequences in the final edit. While the filmmaker was away, however, S.A.I.D. had already commenced postproduction on another documentary called ''[[Live Nude Girls Unite]]'', and the ''BookWars'' team had to defer to their stripper-activist production colleagues.

The filmmaker had by now spent nearly three years in San Francisco, endeavoring to complete ''BookWars'' without having received any grants or external funding. A grant administrator from The Pacific Pioneer Fund explained that, while he considered ''BookWars'' to be a worthy and compelling project, he felt that the filmmaker “would have to be a genius to pull it off” (funding was denied).

At the same time, [[Beat poetry|Beat]] writer and publisher [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] of [[City Lights Bookstore]] viewed the cut of ''BookWars'', and applauded it as being “Anarchistic”.

Delays continued and post production paused while an online editing system in the San Francisco area was sought, unsuccessfully. Finally, co-producer Michel Negroponte contacted the filmmaker regarding an editing station that had become available in New York City; payment to the machine’s owners at Copacetic Pictures could be deferred until the movie was completed and sold.

The filmmaker thus drove back to New York to complete the final edit of the documentary.  During this time, German-French broadcasting group Arte/[[ZDF]] received the nearly-completed cut of the ''BookWars'' and committed to purchasing the hour-long broadcast version for airing, while providing an advance to  enable completion of the final edit, mix, narration, and postproduction of the program. Shortly after announcing this key initial TV sale, The [[Playboy Foundation]] and the [[Experimental Television Center|Experimental TV Center]] subsequently awarded modest postproduction grants.

The work in progress of ''BookWars'' screened at the [[Independent Feature Project]]’s Independent Feature Film Market, while the nearly complete fine cut of ''BookWars'' screened at the New Filmmakers, New York series at [[Anthology Film Archives]] in the Spring of 2000.

Several months later, the final theatrical version of ''Bookwars'' was completed. The movie had its world premiere at the 2000 [[New York Underground Film Festival]], where it won the Best Documentary Award. Though the filmmaker was subsequently banned from the festival venue (Anthology Film Archives) due to over-zealous guerilla promotional activities, the ''BookWars'' nonetheless soon enjoyed a New York theatrical premiere at the Cinema Village [https://web.archive.org/web/20090912095833/http://www.cinemavillage.com/chc/cv/ Cinema Village Website], and went on to screen theatrically and air at numerous international and domestic channels and venues.

In total, production of ''BookWars'' had taken five years and 20,000 miles of driving across the USA to complete.

==Influences and approach==
There are no formal interviews in ''BookWars'' although the booksellers at times speak informally to the filmmaker. There are no subtitles or title cards within the film itself either, except for the opening titles and credits. Rather, the narrator's voiceover is designed to take over this role while conveying a more intimate, personal quality to the story.

Primary influences in the making of the movie were the Beat classic film, [[Pull My Daisy]] and other street-level compositions by filmmaker [[Robert Frank]] and various works from the [[New American Cinema]]. The narration style was adopted from 1930-40’s American gangster and [[film noir]] movies, and some [[Western (genre)|Western]] genre elements were included as well – particularly in the conceptual story component of a “man heading out West to start anew”.

''BookWars'' veers stylistically from straight or journalistic documentaries through its use of creative devices. Slow motion is often employed, the narration is non-standard, the movie follows a distinct narrative structure, and dream sequences are utilized. Often, the subjects of the documentary take over as camera operators and record themselves and their surroundings at will.

Original soundtrack elements were provided by swamp-blues practitioner, Little Muddy [http://www.littlemuddy.com], while pre-recorded compositions by legendary Jazz players, [[Willis Jackson (saxophonist)|Willis Jackson]] and [[Jack McDuff]] were licensed from the 32 Jazz [http://www.allaboutjazz.com/articles/a0999_01.htm] label.

==Festivals and broadcasts==
''BookWars'' has screened at festivals, theatrical venues, and broadcast outlets including: [[NHK]] (Japan), SVT (Sweden) [[Sveriges Television]], [[PBS]], (US), Metrochannels (US) [[MSG Metro Channels]], [[Book Television]] (Canada), Arte/ZDF [[Arte]] (France and Germany), The [[Florida Film Festival]], The Kansas City Film Jubilee [http://kcjubilee.org], Facets [http://www.facets.org/], the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (New York) [http://www.moma.org], the Danish National Film Institute [http://www.dfi.dk]/, Brotfabrik (Berlin) [http://www.exberliner.net/culture/brotfabrik]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, the [[911 Media Arts Center]] [http://www.911media.org] in Seattle, amongst others.

The feature version also pioneered internet releases when they were still uncommon (in 2001), streaming on a pay per view basis on the Cinemapop media portal.

==Awards==
''BookWars'' received the Best Documentary Award upon its world premiere at the 2000 [[New York Underground Film Festival]]. The movie was also nominated for an IFP [[Gotham Award]].

==Reception==
''BookWars'' garnered generally positive reviews, starting with its first review by [[New York Film Critics Circle]] reviewer Matt Zoller Seitz in the New York Press [https://web.archive.org/web/20110606213921/http://www.nypress.com/print-article-1251-print.html]. The film was met with hostility, however, by the participant of another unaffiliated street bookseller book project, who claimed that the director of ''BookWars'' had manipulated the (mainly black &amp; minority) 6th avenue booksellers in order to film them getting drunk – an allegation which proved not to be true. Nonetheless, a [[New York Times]] review [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/09/movies/film-review-selling-books-on-the-street-in-a-quality-of-life-town.html] by critic Elvis Mitchell soon followed which was not supportive of the film. Numerous other positive reviews followed, however, which cast doubt on some motivations behind the early critiques of ''BookWars''.

Ultimately, most of the street booksellers appearing in the movie – as well as those not appearing - welcomed it as an agreeable depiction of their lives, and several street booksellers to this day continue to keep copies of the film on their sidewalk bookstands as a grass-roots, participatory distribution mechanism.

==Reception==
The film ''Carmen, Baby'', according to one reviewer, was the beginning of Metzger's successful style in his later films: that is, adapting "a literary classic in a gorgeous European locale with high polish and a goodly helping of sophisticated sex and seduction."&lt;ref name="UCLA-20110609"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Carmen, Baby (1967), Little Mother (Germany/Yugoslavia/US, 1972) |url=https://www.cinema.ucla.edu/events/2011-06-09/carmen-baby-1967-little-mother-germanyyugoslaviaus-1972 |date=June 9, 2011 |work=[[UCLA]] |accessdate=April 13, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critic Jesse Vogel noted that the film is an example of Metzger's signature style, "cool, classy, distant, with a distinctively European sensibility".&lt;ref name="EFC-19671010"&gt;{{cite web |last=Vogel |first=Jesse |title=Carmen, Baby |url=http://www.efilmcritic.com/review.php?movie=5824&amp;reviewer=223 |date=October 10, 1967 |work=eFilmCritic.com |accessdate=April 13, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to film reviewer Gary Morris, ''Carmen'' was "well played" by Uta Levka; lighting and camerawork by [[Hans Jura]] was "first-rate".&lt;ref name="BLF-19991101"&gt;{{cite web |last=Morris |first=Gary |title=Radley Metzger: The Dirty Girls, Carmen Baby, The Princess and the Call Girl on DVD |url=http://brightlightsfilm.com/radley-metzger-dirty-girls-carmen-baby-princess-call-girl-dvd/ |date=November 1, 1999 |work=[[Bright Lights Film Journal]] |accessdate=April 13, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another reviewer wrote that the film had "a rather classy look" and that the performers were "attractive" and the setting  "beautiful".&lt;ref name="NYT-19671011"&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff |title='Carmen' Updated |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9800E0DA173EE63BBC4952DFB667838C679EDE |date=October 11, 1967 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=April 13, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
In the case of ''[[Rabe v. Washington]]'', 405 U.S. 313 (1972), the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] decided that the manager of a [[Drive-in theater|drive-in movie theater]] could not be charged with [[obscenity]] for showing the film which was not wholly determined to be obscene, but only parts were, holding that the citizens of Washington State had no [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Notice of accusation|notice under the Sixth Amendment]] that the place where a film was shown was an [[Element (criminal law)|element of the offense]].  

==Popular culture==
[[Wally Lamb]] mentioned the bottle dance scene from ''Carmen, Baby'' in his 2016 book ''I'll Take You There''.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21436">'''Clarke &amp; Howe''' was an [[United States|American]] [[architect|architectural firm]] from [[Providence, Rhode Island]] that was active from 1893 to 1928.

The firm was established in 1893 as '''Clarke &amp; Spaulding''', with Prescott O. Clarke and Arthur R. Spaulding.&lt;ref&gt;''American Architect and Building News'' 11 Nov. 1893: xii.&lt;/ref&gt;  Wallis E. Howe was added as a partner in 1901, with the firm becoming Clarke, Spaulding &amp; Howe.  This association was short-lived, as Spaulding retired from architecture later that year.&lt;ref name="Rep"&gt;''Representative Men and Old Families of Rhode Island''. Vol. 2. 1908.&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1907 to 1913 the firm was known as Clarke, Howe &amp; Homer, with Eleazer B. Homer, a former [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] professor of architecture.&lt;ref&gt;''Technology Review'' Oct. 1907: 506.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''American Contractor'' 9 Aug. 1913: 103.&lt;/ref&gt;  Clarke &amp; Howe was dissolved upon Clarke's retirement in 1928, with Howe continuing the practice as Howe &amp; Church.&lt;ref&gt;''Architecture'' 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partner Biographies==

'''Prescott Orloff Clarke''' was born in Providence in 1858.  He attended private schools, and graduated from [[Brown University]], class of 1880.  He then worked for [[Brown &amp; Sharpe]], and was later with Clarke, Black &amp; Co., if which his father, George L. Clarke, was the senior partner.  George Clarke died in 1890, and Prescott decided to pursue architecture.  He moved to Boston, where he attended [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]].  Soon after his return in 1893 he partnered with Spaulding.  They continued in partnership together until 1901, Spaulding's retirement.&lt;ref name="Rep"/&gt;  Clarke himself retired in 1928, and died in 1935.&lt;ref name="Paper"&gt;Jordy, William H. and Christopher P. Monkhouse. Buildings on Paper: Rhode Island Architectural Drawings, 1825-1945. 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

The life of '''Arthur R. Spaulding''' is unknown.

'''[[Wallis Eastburn Howe]]''' was born in 1868 in [[Bristol, RI|Bristol]], as the youngest of 18 children.  Howe attended [[Lehigh University]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]. He returned to Rhode Island by 1894, and may have established his own office.  In 1895 he begn working for [[Martin &amp; Hall]], noted Providence architects.  There he attained a high rank, and was permitted to accept his own commissions.  He remained with Martin &amp; Hall until 1901, when he was accepted into the partnership of Clarke, Spaulding &amp; Howe.  He remained with Clarke until his 1928 retirement.  After 1928, he embarked on a series of successful partnerships, beginning with Howe &amp; Church and ending with Howe &amp; Prout.  He died in 1960.&lt;ref name="Paper"/&gt;

'''Eleazer Bartlett Homer''' was born in [[Somerville, Massachusetts]] in 1864.  He graduated from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1885.  For a few years he worked for [[Hartwell &amp; Richardson]], and opened his own practice in 1889.  From 1887 to 1900 he was a professor at MIT, and was a lecturer there from then until at least 1915.  He was also the director of [[RISD]] from 1900 to 1907.  That year he associated himself with Clarke and Howe as Clarke, Howe &amp; Homer.&lt;ref&gt;"Eleazer Bartlett Homer". ''Journal of the American Institute of Architects'' Dec. 1915: 540.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1913 he reestablished his own practice in Providence, maintaining it until his death in 1929.&lt;ref name="Paper"/&gt;

==Architectural Works==

===Clarke &amp; Spaulding, 1893-1901===
Soon after their 1893 formation, Clarke &amp; Spaulding began publishing their designs in the American Architect and Building News.  These are best represented by a series of four [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor Revival]] designs.  The first of these was the "Proposed Inn at Nayatt, RI", published in January 1894.&lt;ref&gt;''American Architect and Building News'' 13 Jan. 1894.&lt;/ref&gt;  Apparently not built, what is shown is a sprawling seaside resort complex, positioned somewhere in southern [[Barrington, Rhode Island|Barrington]].  In 1896, Prescott Clarke built himself a large house at 203 Blackstone Boulevard in Providence.  Already well off from his prior industrial pursuits, the house was one of the largest then built in that part of the city.&lt;ref name="Woodward"&gt;Woodward, Wm. McKenzie. ''Providence: A Citywide Survey of Historic Resources''. 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was published in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;''American Architect and Building News'' 24 July 1897.&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 1897, a design for a residence for Dr. Frederick Danne in [[Bristol, RI|Bristol]] was published.&lt;ref&gt;''American Architect and Building News'' 19 June 1897.&lt;/ref&gt;  This house, built in 1896 near the foot of Smith Street,&lt;ref&gt;''Atlantic Medical Weekly'' 26 Sept. 1896: 199.&lt;/ref&gt; showcased a hybrid mix of the Tudor Revival as well as the Shingle Style.  It no longer stands.  In 1897 the architects designed a large double house at 184-186 Upton Avenue in Providence.  It was commissioned by Courtney Langdon, a [[Brown University]] professor of languages.&lt;ref name="Blackstone"&gt;''Blackstone Boulevard-Cole Avenue-Grotto Avenue Historic District NRHP Nomination''. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The two halves are designed to contrast enough to be seen as different residences, but still cooperate as a single building.  This design was published in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;''American Architect and Building News'' 19 Feb. 1898.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important commission was the Fletcher Building (1895), at Union and Westminster in Downtown Providence.  It is a large, Classical Revival building, built for the Fletcher heirs.&lt;ref&gt;''American Architect and Building News'' 30 March 1895: xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally a three story building, in 1902 Clarke &amp; Howe were commissioned to add three additional floors.&lt;ref&gt;''American Architect and Building News'' 13 Sept. 1902: xi.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, in 1900, the architects designed a large clubhouse for Francis Kinney in [[Narragansett, RI|Narragansett]].  Known as [[Anthony-Kinney Farm|Kinney's Casino]], it was based on an East Indian bungalow.&lt;ref&gt;''Anthony-Kinney Farm NRHP Nomination''. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other designs include:
* William Binney Duplex, 100 Meeting St., Providence, RI (1898)&lt;ref&gt;Cavanaugh, Kathryn J. "PPS Records for 100 Meeting Street". ''http://gowdey.ppsri.org/''. Feb. 2010. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Irving P. Eddy House, 306 Olney St., Providence, RI (1898)&lt;ref name="Eastside"&gt;''Historic and Architectural Resources of the East Side, Providence: A Preliminary Report''. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clarke, Spaulding &amp; Howe, 1901===
The association of the three architects together was extremely short, lasting only for part of a year.  When Howe arrived from [[Martin &amp; Hall]], he brought a commission for a mill in [[Pawtucket, RI|Pawtucket]].  This, the American Textile Mill at 250 Esten Avenue, is noted especially for its [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance Revival]] tower.&lt;ref name="Jordy"&gt;Jordy, William H. ''Buildings of Rhode Island''. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  The other known commission from this period is [[St. George's School, Newport|St. George's School]] in [[Middletown, RI|Middletown]].&lt;ref&gt;''St. George's School: Church of St. George, Little Chapel, and Memorial Schoolhouse NRHP Nomination''. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  It came to the firm because the school's founder and headmaster, John B. Diman, was Clarke's cousin.&lt;ref&gt;Haverington, Christine. ''Images of America: Middletown''. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the school, the architects designed a reserved red brick building, which used elements from both the [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial]] and Dutch Renaissance revivals.  Clarke would design for the school until 1927, and Howe until at least 1957.&lt;ref&gt;''Engineering News-Record'' 1957: 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1903, Clarke &amp; Howe were known primarily for their residential designs.  This changed that year, when they won the commission for the [[Federal Building (Providence, Rhode Island)|U. S. Federal Building]] on Kennedy Plaza in downtown Providence.  Construction began on this major [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] building in 1904, and it was completed four years later in 1908.  The design competition attracted ten entries, from [[New England]] and [[New York City|New York]], but this design by a local firm was selected unanimously.  Clarke &amp; Howe was assisted in the design by [[Harvey Wiley Corbett]], who had been working in their office after returning from [[Europe]].

Also in 1903, the firm completed two other non-residential designs.  The first of these was the [[New Hampshire Bank Building|Portsmouth Savings Bank]] in downtown [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]].  Begun in 1902, this was actually an overhaul of a much earlier bank building, and the resulting design was typical of temple-front twentieth century banks.  The other was for the Engineering Building at Brown University.  Unlike the other two buildings, this is a plainer [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]] building.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Mitchell, Martha. ''Encyclopedia Brunoniana''. 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, known as the Lincoln Field Building, it is home to the department of geological science.

They also designed many residences during this period, most prominent of which are a 1903 house at 102 Prospect Street in Providence, built for Dr. Henry A. Whitmarsh,&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt; and another at 140 Blackstone Boulevard for Charles D. Dunlop in 1907-08.&lt;ref name="Eastside"/&gt;

Other designs include:
* Farm Group, [[Goddard Memorial State Park|The Oaks]] ([[Robert Hale Ives Goddard|R. H. I. Goddard]] estate), [[Potowomut, RI]] (1902) - Demolished.&lt;ref&gt;''Architectural Review: Sept. 1902: 244.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Richard W. Comstock, Jr. House, 203 Governor St., Providence, RI (1905)&lt;ref name="Eastside"/&gt;
* H. Anthony Dyer House, 170 Blackstone Blvd., Providence, RI (1906) - Altered.&lt;ref name="Blackstone"/&gt;

===Clarke, Howe &amp; Homer, 1907-1913===
[[File:Rhode Island Medical Society Building, Providence RI.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Rhode Island Medical Society Building|Rhode Island Medical Society]], Providence, RI. 1911.]]
Concurrent to the addition of Eleazer B. Homer, the architects began receiving commissions for more civic structures.  The first of these was the [[Benjamin Church House (Bristol, Rhode Island)|Benjamin Church Home for Aged Men]] on Hope Street in [[Bristol, RI|Bristol]].&lt;ref&gt;''Municipal Journal and Engineer'' 18 March 1908: 352.&lt;/ref&gt;  The building was commissioned by the family of Samuel W. Church, a draftsman with the firm who would become a partner upon Clarke's retirement.  Built to a residential scale, it is considered a "very pure example" of [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]] architecture.

In 1909, they designed the Veazie Street Grammar School, at Veazie and Douglas Avenue in Providence.&lt;ref&gt;''Engineering-Contracting'' 9 Dec. 1908: 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  Now an elementary school, it was designed by Homer in the [[Jacobethan]] style.  This was followed the following year by the former [[South Kingstown High School]] in [[Wakefield, RI|Wakefield]].&lt;ref&gt;''Engineering Record'' 4 Dec. 1909: 62.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was a more purely [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor Revival]] design.  Donated by the Hazard family of [[Peace Dale, RI|Peace Dale]], it is now named for them.  In 1912, the architects were commissioned to design Ranger Hall on the campus of the [[University of Rhode Island]].&lt;ref&gt;''Rhode Island State-Owned Historic Properties''. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a large but plain academic building, vaguely Jacobethan in design.  Completing this group of educational commissions was [[William N. McVickar|McVickar Hall]] at [[St. Andrew's School (Rhode Island)|St. Andrew's School]] in [[Barrington, RI|Barrington]].  This, the administration building for a former industrial school, is based on the Wakefield school, but uses a more [[Cotswold architecture|rural English]] vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Proceedings of the 123rd Annual Session of the Rhode Island Episcopal Convention''. 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;

They also designed several buildings more commercial in nature.  In 1911 they built the Blackstone Hotel on Westminster Street in Providence.  Like many early twentieth century hotels, it is designed in a red brick Beaux-Arts manner.&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt;  It is today known as the Hotel Providence.  That same year, they built a library and clubhouse for the [[Rhode Island Medical Society Building|Rhode Island Medical Society]].&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt;  It has been occupied as commercial space for several years.  In 1912, they designed a building for the Peoples Savings Bank on Market Square.  This building, now owned by [[RISD]], is a typical Classical, temple-front bank.  It was completed in 1913.&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt;  In 1949, the bank moved to a new building on Kennedy Plaza, designed by [[Ralph Adams Cram|Cram &amp; Ferguson]].&lt;ref&gt;Cady, John Hutchins. ''The Civic and Architectural Development of Providence, 1636-1950''. 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;

Residential commissions remained an important part of the firm's work.  Two important houses are that for Ella R. M. Phillips (1909, 236 George Street)&lt;ref&gt;Barlow, Judith A. "PPS Records for 236 George Street". ''http://gowdey.ppsri.org/''. Aug. 1908. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; and Mary B. L. Steedman (1912, 271 Angell Street),&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt; both Colonial Revival houses on Providence's east side. Also, in 1911, Eleazer Homer built himself a house at 270 Blackstone Boulevard.&lt;ref name="Blackstone"/&gt;  That house, like other known Homer designs, is heavily influenced by English architecture.  This one, specifically, looks to the [[Arts and Crafts movement]].

Other designs include:
* William McDonald, Jr. House, 188 Blackstone Blvd., Providence, RI (1907)&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt;
* Frank M. MacLeod House, 290 Irving Ave., Providence, RI (1909–10)&lt;ref name="Eastside"/&gt;
* Annie C. Barker House, 44 Orchard Ave., Providence, RI (1910–11)&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt;
* George L. Miner House, 276 Blackstone Blvd., Providence, RI (1910)&lt;ref name="Blackstone"/&gt;
* Otis Randall House, 65 Weymouth St., Providence, RI (1912)&lt;ref&gt;''Olney Street-Alumni Avenue Historic District NRHP Nomination''. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clarke &amp; Howe, 1913-1928===

[[File:Wanskuck Library.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Wanskuck Library-Providence Community Library|Wanskuck Branch Library]], Providence, RI. 1926-28.]]
Soon before the breakup of Clarke, Howe &amp; Homer, the [[Newport Public Library]] hired the firm to design their new quarters.  As Clarke &amp; Howe, they remodeled the noted [[Edward King House]], a large [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] mansion designed by [[Richard Upjohn]].  The library later moved into a purpose-built building, and the King house is now a senior center.&lt;ref&gt;''American Contractor'' 27 Sept. 1913: 55.&lt;/ref&gt;  Two years later, in 1915, they designed St. Elizabeth's Home on Melrose Street in Providence, another [[Jacobethan]] production.&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt;  Also in 1915 they were hired to design a house for Howe's old fraternity at [[Lehigh University]] in [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]].  The resulting building, Briarfield House, is a Tudor Revival design, complemented by a wooded site.&lt;ref&gt;''American Contractor'' 15 July 1915: 45.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was completed in 1922.  In 1925, they designed the Guiteras Memorial School in Bristol.  The conservative Classical design was based on a Greek Revival house that had recently burned.&lt;ref name="Bristol"/&gt;  During the 1920s, Clarke &amp; Howe was commissioned by the [[Providence Public Library]] to design a standard design for the city's branch libraries.  Only the [[Wanskuck Library-Providence Community Library|Wanskuck Branch Library]] (1926–28) on Veazie Street was built to that original plan.&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt; Howe later designed several other branches, but to different designs each time.  Also in 1926, they designed for [[St. Andrew's School (Rhode Island)|St. Andrew's School]] a new building called Gardner Hall.&lt;ref name="Barrington"/&gt;  The architects also designed the now-demolished [[Marvel Gymnasium]] for [[Brown University]] in 1927.&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt;

During this latter period, they designed several churches.  In 1916 they built [[Saint Martin's Church, Providence|St. Martin's Episcopal Church]], all told one of their most important commissions.  The prototype for the church was a typical English village church, a common source for a great deal of American churches.  In 1925, they would add a parish house to the rear of the church.&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt;  They designed another Providence church, the Church of the Redeemer, on Hope Street in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;''American Contractor'' 4 Aug. 1917: 61.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1920, they completed the spire of St. Luke's in [[East Greenwich, RI|East Greenwich]].  The church itself was designed in 1878 by [[Alexander Rice Esty|A. R. Esty]].&lt;ref name="Jordy"/&gt;  In 1922-23, they built St. George's on Clinton Street in [[Central Falls, RI|Central Falls]].&lt;ref&gt;''American Contractor'' 22 July 1922: 45.&lt;/ref&gt;  Their final church commission was in 1928, when they designed a new sanctuary for the Fourth Baptist Church of Providence.  The new building was built on Hope Street, placed alongside the old church, which became a parish house.  The church is now occupied by the Mt. Hope Community Baptist Church.&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt;

As before, they continued to receive several commissions for commercial buildings, including one of Providence's first skyscrapers.  This was the Telephone Building, built in 1917 as the headquarters of the Providence Telephone Company.&lt;ref&gt;''American Contractor'' 28 July 917: 40.&lt;/ref&gt;  At eight stories, it was the tallest commercial building outside of the financial district.  In 1920, they designed the central branch of [[Citizens Financial Group|Citizens Savings Bank]] at Hoyle Square.  An impressive temple-front bank, it remains a Citizens branch to this day.&lt;ref&gt;''American Contractor'' 5 June 1920: 57.&lt;/ref&gt;  A third large building was the Providence Gas Company Building, at 100 Weybosset Street, built in 1924.  This office building is especially noted for its distinctive [[ogee|ogee gable]], first used in Rhode Island on the Joseph Brown House.&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt;

Clarke &amp; Howe also designed many large residences during this period.  The first of these was that for Edward I. Watson (1915), at 140 Nayatt Road in Barrington.&lt;ref name="Barrington"&gt;''Historic and Architectural Resources of Barrington, Rhode Island''. 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was a large, Colonial Revival summer residence for a Providence businessman.  In the 1920s, they designed a great deal of large houses in Providence.  These included those for Thomas A. Francis (1922, 156 Hope Street),&lt;ref&gt;''American Contractor'' 15 July 1922: 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Frank B. Lisle (1923, 59 Manning Street),&lt;ref name="Jordy"/&gt; Archie W. Merchant (1924, 48 Barberry Hill),&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt; and Paul C. DeWolf (1925, 25 Freeman Parkway).&lt;ref&gt;''Freeman Plat Historic District NRHP Nomination''. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;  These all showed different variants of Colonial Revival design as it developed through the 1920s.  Also, in 1926, they designed a stern, brick Jacobethan house for Alfred M. Coats at 175 Upton Avenue.&lt;ref name="Blackstone"/&gt;

Other designs include:
* James Davenport House, 25 George St., Providence, RI (1914)&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt;
* Arnold Laboratory, [[Brown University]], Providence, RI (1915)&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;
* Irene M. Butler House, 59 George St., Providence, RI (1915)&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt;
* Laurel Hill Avenue Grammar School, Laurel Hill Ave. &amp; Cleveland St., Providence, RI (1916)&lt;ref&gt;''American Architect'' 27 Sept. 1916: 209.&lt;/ref&gt;
* John Post Reynolds School, High &amp; Court Sts., [[Bristol, RI]] (1916)&lt;ref&gt;''American Contractor'' 6 May 1916: 73&lt;/ref&gt;
* Farm Group, [[Colt State Park|Colt Farm]] ([[Samuel P. Colt]] estate), Bristol, RI (1917)&lt;ref&gt;''Poppasquash Farms Historic District NRHP Nomination''. 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hugh F. MacColl House, 152 Grotto Ave., Providence, RI (1918)&lt;ref&gt;''American Contractor'' 25 May 1918: 47.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Charles B. Rockwell, Jr. House, 2 High St., Bristol, RI (1924)&lt;ref name="Bristol"&gt;''Historic and Architectural Resources of Bristol, Rhode Island''. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cloisonné''''' ({{IPA-fr|klwazɔne}}) is an ancient technique for decorating [[metalwork]] objects. In recent centuries, [[vitreous enamel]] has been used, and inlays of cut [[gemstone]]s, glass and other materials were also used during older periods. The resulting objects can also be called ''cloisonné''. The decoration is formed by first adding compartments (''cloisons'' in French&lt;ref&gt;In French "cloison" is a general word for "compartment" or "partition" or "cell", in English the word is normally only used in the specialized context of cloisonné work, and apparently dentistry ([[OED]], "Cloison")&lt;/ref&gt;) to the metal object by [[solder]]ing or affixing silver or gold wires or thin strips placed on their edges. These remain visible in the finished piece, separating the different compartments of the enamel or inlays, which are often of several colors. Cloisonné enamel objects are worked on with enamel powder made into a paste, which then needs to be fired in a [[kiln]].

In antiquity, the cloisonné technique was mostly used for jewellery and small fittings for clothes, weapons or similar small objects decorated with geometric or schematic designs, with thick cloison walls. In the [[Byzantine Empire]] techniques using thinner wires were developed to allow more pictorial images to be produced, mostly used for religious images and jewellery, and by then always using enamel.  By the 14th century this enamel technique had spread to China, where it was soon used for much larger vessels such as bowls and vases; the technique remains common in China to the present day, and cloisonné enamel objects using Chinese-derived styles were produced in the West from the 18th century.

==History==

===Early techniques===
Cloisonné first developed in the jewellery of the ancient [[Near East]], typically in very small pieces such as rings, with thin wire forming the cloisons. In the jewellery of [[art of Ancient Egypt|ancient Egypt]], including the [[Pectoral (Ancient Egypt)|pectoral jewels]] of the [[Pharaoh]]s, thicker strips form the cloisons, which remain small.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 67-8. For an example see [http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/egyptian_art/pectoral_and_necklace_of_sithathoryunet/objectview.aspx?collID=10&amp;OID=100000450 Pectoral and Necklace of Sithathoryunet] Metropolitan Museum&lt;/ref&gt; In Egypt gemstones and enamel-like materials sometimes called "glass-paste" were both used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceramicstoday.com/articles/092501.htm Egyptian Paste] article from ''Ceramics Today'';. See also [[Egyptian faience]]. There are disputes as to whether, or when, such materials were fired with the object, or fired separately first and then cut into pieces to be inlaid like gems. It seems both methods may have been used. See Day, Enamelling, 7-10&lt;/ref&gt; The Byzantines perfected a unique form of cloisonné icons. [[Byzantine enamel]] spread to surrounding cultures and a particular type, often known as '''garnet cloisonné''' is widely found in the [[Migration Period art]] of the "[[barbarian]]" peoples of Europe, who used gemstones, especially red [[garnet]]s, as well as glass and enamel, with small thick-walled cloisons. Red garnets and gold made an attractive contrast of colours, and for Christians the garnet was a symbol of Christ. This type is now thought to have originated in the [[Late Antique]] [[Eastern Roman Empire]] and to have initially reached the Migration peoples as diplomatic gifts of objects probably made in [[Constantinople]], then copied by their own goldsmiths.&lt;ref&gt;Late Antiquity, 464.  See here for scientific [https://books.google.com/books?id=zP6bgkUWCTsC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=glass+cloisonne&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=glass%20cloisonne&amp;f=false materials analysis]&lt;/ref&gt; Glass-paste cloisonné was made in the same periods with similar results – compare the gold [[Anglo-Saxon]] fitting with garnets (right) and the [[Visigothic]] brooch with glass-paste in the gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RcAOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=Byzantine+cloisonne&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Byzantine+cloisonne&amp;f=false|title=Dark-age Britain: Studies Presented to E. T. Leeds|first=Donald Benjamin|last=Harden|date=1956|publisher=Methuen|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thick ribbons of gold were soldered to the base of the sunken area to be decorated to make the compartments, before adding the stones or paste.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Green, 87-88&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes compartments filled with the different materials of cut stones or glass and enamel are mixed to ornament the same object, as in the [[Sutton Hoo purse-lid]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardner. [https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/p/purse_lid_from_the_ship-burial.aspx British Museum, Sutton Hoo purse-lid]&lt;/ref&gt; In the Byzantine world the technique was developed into the thin-wire style suitable only for enamel described below, which was imitated in Europe from about [[Carolingian]] period onwards.

===Enamel===
The earliest surviving cloisonné pieces are rings in graves from 12th century BC [[Cyprus]], using very thin wire.&lt;ref&gt;Michaelides, Panicos, ''The Earliest Cloisonne Enamels from Cyprus'', article from ''Glass on Metal, the Enamellist's Magazine'', April 1989, [http://glass-on-metal.com/pastart/earliestenamels-michaelides.htm online], 
[https://books.google.com/books?id=-aFtPdh6-2QC&amp;pg=PA259&amp;dq=earliest+enamel&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=earliest%20enamel&amp;f=false see also]&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, enamel was just one of the fillings used for the small, thick-walled cloisons of the Late Antique and Migration Period style described above.  From about the 8th century, [[Byzantine art]] began again to use much thinner wire more freely to allow much more complex designs to be used, with larger and less geometric compartments, which was only possible using enamel.&lt;ref&gt;The date of the change is uncertain, partly because Early Byzantine enamels were much forged in 19th century Russia, rather confusing historians.&lt;/ref&gt;   These were still on relatively small objects, although numbers of plaques could be set into larger objects, such as the [[Pala d'Oro]], the [[altarpiece]] in [[St Mark's Basilica|Saint Mark's Cathedral]], [[Venice]]. Some objects combined thick and thin cloisons for varied effect.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, 217&lt;/ref&gt; The designs often (as at right) contained a generous background of plain gold, as in contemporary [[Mosaic#Byzantine mosaics|Byzantine mosaics]].  The area to be enamelled was stamped to create the main depression, pricked to help the enamel adhere, and the cloisons added.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, 99, describing what appear to be trainee pieces in bronze, never completed.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two different techniques in Byzantine and European cloisonné enamel are distinguished, for which the German names are still typically used in English. The earliest is the '''''Vollschmelz''''' ("full" enamel, literally "full melt") technique where the whole of a gold base plate is to be covered in enamel. The edges of the plate are turned up to form a reservoir, and gold wires are soldered in place to form the ''cloisons''.  The enamel design therefore covers the whole plate.  In the '''''Senkschmelz''''' ("sunk" enamel, literally "sunk melt") technique the parts of the base plate to hold the design are hammered down, leaving a surrounding gold background, as also seen in contemporary Byzantine icons and mosaics with [[gold glass]] backgrounds, and the saint illustrated here. The wires and enamels are then added as before. The outline of the design will be apparent on the reverse of the base plate.&lt;ref&gt;Bàràny-Oberschall, 122-123; Lasko, 8—he prefers ""full" enamel" and ""sunk" enamel"; [https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/g/gold_and_enamel_cross.aspx British Museum on using the German names]&lt;/ref&gt; The transition between the two techniques occurs around 900 in Byzantine enamel,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 11&lt;/ref&gt; and 1000 in the West, though with important earlier examples.&lt;ref&gt;Earlier Western examples are few but include the cover of the [[Lindau Gospels]], the foot-reliquary of St Andrew made for [[Egbert of Trier]], and the [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire]]; Lasko, 84-85&lt;/ref&gt;  The plaques with apostles of around the latter date on the [[Holy Crown of Hungary]] show a unique transitional phase, where the base plaque has hammered recesses for the design, as in ''senkschmelz'' work, but the enamel covers the whole plaque except for thick outlines around the figures and inscriptions, as in the ''vollschmelz'' technique (see the gallery below for examples of this technique and ''vollschmelz'' work).&lt;ref&gt;Bàràny-Oberschall, 122-123&lt;/ref&gt;  Some 10th-century pieces achieve a ''senkschmelz'' effect by using two plates superimposed on each other, the upper one with the design outline cut out and the lower one left plain.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 13 figure 7&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Chinese - Wine Pot - Walters 44569 - Side.jpg|thumb|An 18th century Chinese wine pot with cloissonné enamel and gilt bronze; the design was loosely based on a Zhou Dynasty inlaid bronzes of the 5th-4th centuries BC]]

From Byzantium or the Islamic world the technique reached [[China]] in the 13–14th centuries; the first written reference is in a book of 1388, where it is called "Dashi ware".  No Chinese pieces clearly from the 14th century are known, the earliest datable pieces being from the reign of the [[Xuande Emperor]] (1425–35), which however show a full use of Chinese styles suggesting considerable experience in the technique.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, 239. See also Dillon ref below.&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially regarded with suspicion by Chinese connoisseurs, firstly as being foreign, and secondly as appealing to feminine taste.  However, by the beginning of the 18th century the [[Kangxi Emperor]] had a cloisonné workshop among the many Imperial factories.  The most elaborate and highly valued Chinese pieces are from the early [[Ming Dynasty]], especially the reigns of the Xuande Emperor and [[Jingtai Emperor]] (1450–57), although 19th century or modern pieces are far more common.  The Chinese industry seems to have benefited from a number of skilled Byzantine refugees fleeing the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, although based on the name alone, it is far more likely China obtained knowledge of the technique from the middle east. In much Chinese  cloisonné blue is usually the predominant colour, and the Chinese name for the technique, ''jingtailan'' ("Jingtai blue ware"), refers to this, and the Jingtai Emperor. Quality began to decline in the 19th century.  Initially heavy [[bronze]] or [[brass]] bodies were used, and the wires soldered, but later much lighter [[copper]] vessels were used, and the wire glued on before firing.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, 58-59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Orange Coast Magazine]], 95&lt;/ref&gt; The enamels compositions and the pigments change with time.

In Byzantine pieces, and even more in Chinese work, the wire by no means always encloses a separate color of enamel.  Sometime a wire is used just for decorative effect, stopping in the middle of a field of enamel, and sometimes the boundary between two enamel colors is not marked by a wire. In the Byzantine plaque at right the first feature may be seen in the top wire on the saint's black sleeve, and the second in the white of his eyes and collar.  Both are also seen in the Chinese bowl illustrated at top right.

Chinese cloisonné is amongst the best known enamel cloisonné in the world.

The Japanese also produced large quantities from the mid-19th century, of very high technical quality.&lt;ref&gt;V&amp;A&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan cloisonné enamels are known as ''shippō-yaki'' (七宝焼). Early centres of cloisonné were [[Nagoya]] during the [[Owari Domain]]. Companies of renown were the [[Ando Cloisonné Company]]. Later centres of renown were Edo and Kyoto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/j/japanese-cloisonne-the-seven-treasures/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003105402/http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/j/japanese-cloisonne-the-seven-treasures/ |archivedate=2015-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Kyoto [[Namikawa (company)|Namikawa]] became one of the leading companies of Japanese cloisonné. The [[Namikawa Yasuyuki|Namikawa Yasuyuki Cloisonné Museum]] is specifically dedicated to it.

Russian cloisonné from the Tsarist era is also highly prized by collectors, especially from the [[House of Fabergé]] or [[Khlebnikov (firm)|Khlebnikov]], and the French and other nations have produced small quantities.  Chinese cloisonné is sometimes confused with Canton enamel, a similar type of enamel work that is painted on freehand and does not use partitions to hold the colors separate.

In medieval Western Europe cloisonné enamel technique was gradually overtaken by the rise of [[champlevé enamel]], where the spaces for the enamel to fill are created by making recesses (using various methods) into the base object, rather than building up compartments from it, as in cloisonné.  Later techniques were evolved that allowed the enamel to be painted onto a flat background without running.  [[Plique-à-jour]] is a related enameling technique which uses clear enamels and no metal backplate, producing an object that has the appearance of a miniature stained glass object - in effect cloisonné with no backing. Plique-a'-jour is usually created on a base of mica or thin copper which is subsequently peeled off (mica) or etched away with acid (copper).

Other ways of using the technique have been developed, but are of minor importance.  In 19th century Japan it was used on [[pottery]] vessels with ceramic glazes, and it has been used with [[lacquer]] and modern [[acrylic resin|acrylic]] fillings for the cloisons.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter&lt;/ref&gt;  A version of cloisonné technique is often used for lapel badges, logo badges for many objects such as cars, including [[BMW]] models, and other applications, though in these the metal base is normally cast with the compartments in place, so the use of the term cloisonne', though common, is questionable. That technique is correctly referred by goldsmiths, metalsmiths and enamellists as champlevé.

A large collection of 150 Chinese cloisonné pieces is at the [[G.W. Vincent Smith Art Museum]] in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]].

==Modern process==
[[File:CPPatternAndCloisons.jpg|thumb|right|Adding cloisons according to the pattern previously transferred to the workpiece]]
[[File:CPAddingFrit.jpg|thumb|right|Adding [[frit]] with dropper after sintering cloisons. Upon completion the piece will be fired, then ground (repeating as necessary) then polished and electroplated]]

First the object to be decorated is made or obtained; this will normally be made by different craftspeople. The [[metal]] usually used for making the body is copper, since it is cheap, light and easily hammered and stretched, but [[gold]], [[silver]] or other metals may be used. Cloisonné wire is made from fine silver or [[fine gold]] and is usually about .010 x .040&amp;nbsp;inches in cross section. It is bent into shapes that define the colored areas. The bends are all done at right angles, so that the wire does not curve up. This is done with small pliers, tweezers, and custom-made jigs. The cloisonné wire pattern may consist of several intricately constructed wire patterns that fit together into a larger design. Solder can be used to join the wires, but this causes the enamel to discolour and form bubbles later on. Most existing Byzantine enamels have soldered cloisons, however the use of solder to adhere the cloison wires has fallen out of favor due to its difficulty, with the exception of some "purist contemporary enamellists" who create fine watch faces and high quality very expensive jewelry. Instead of soldering the cloisons to the base metal, the base metal is fired with a thin layer of clear enamel. The cloisonné wire is glued to the enamel surface with gum [[tragacanth]]. When the gum has dried, the piece is fired again to fuse the cloisonné wire to the clear enamel. The gum burns off, leaving no residue.

Vitreous enamels in the different colors are ground to fine powders in an agate or porcelain mortar and pestle, then washed to remove the impurities that would discolor the fired enamel.&lt;ref name="BlairRamsay1991"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Blair|author2=Nigel Ramsay|title=English Medieval Industries: Craftsmen, Techniques, Products|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mxjCN8R4pgsC&amp;pg=PA127|year=1991|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-85285-326-6|pages=127–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The enamel is made from silica, niter, and lead oxide to which metallic oxides are added for coloring.  These ingredients are melted together, forming a glassy [[frit]] which is ground again before application. Each color of enamel is prepared this way before it is used and then mixed with a very dilute solution of gum tragacanth. Using fine spatulas, brushes or droppers, the enameler places the fine colored powder into each cloison.  The piece is left to dry completely before firing, which is done by putting the article, with its enamel fillings, in a kiln. The enamel in the cloisons will sink down a lot after firing, due to melting and shrinkage of the granular nature of the glass powder, much as sugar melting in an oven. This process is repeated until all cloisons are filled to the top of the wire edge.
[[File:Cloisonne artwork (Korea).jpg|220px|thumbnail|cloisonne artwork of Korea (namjung cloisonne)]]
Three styles of cloisonné are most often seen: concave, convex, and flat.  The finishing method determines this final appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Enamels Enameling Enamelists G.L. Matthews pp 146-147&lt;/ref&gt;  With concave cloisonné the cloisons are not completely filled. Capillary action causes the enamel surface to curve up against the cloisonné wire when the enamel is molten, producing a concave appearance. Convex cloissoné is produced by overfilling each cloison, at the last firing.  This gives each color area the appearance of slightly rounded mounds.  Flat cloisonné is the most common.  After all the cloisons are filled the enamel is ground down to a smooth surface with lapidary equipment, using the same techniques as are used for polishing cabochon stones.  The top of the cloisonné wire is polished so it is flush with the enamel and has a bright lustre.&lt;ref name="LibanMitchell2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Felicia Liban|author2=Louise Mitchell|title=Cloisonné Enameling and Jewelry Making|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G0PCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT92|date=6 July 2012|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=978-0-486-13600-4|pages=92–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Matthews1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=Glenice Lesley Matthews|title=Enamels, Enameling, Enamelists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P3NQAAAAMAAJ|year=1984|publisher=Chilton Book Company|isbn=978-0-8019-7285-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cloisonné wire is [[electroplating|electroplated]] with a thin film of gold, which will not tarnish as silver does.&lt;ref name="Radok2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephanie Radok|title=An Opening: Twelve Love Stories about Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ap8RWIyXv2QC&amp;pg=PA104|year=2012|publisher=Wakefield Press|isbn=978-1-74305-043-9|pages=104–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hesse2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rayner W.

[[File:Kansas City Crossroads District (31507881750).jpg|thumb|Crossroads, Kansas City in December 2016]]
The '''Crossroads''' (officially the '''Crossroads Arts District''') is a historic [[neighborhood]] near [[Downtown Kansas City]], Missouri.  It is centered at approximately 19th Street and Baltimore Avenue, directly south of the [[Downtown freeway loop|Downtown Loop]] and north of [[Crown Center]]. It is the city's main [[art gallery]] district and center for the [[visual arts]]. Dozens of galleries are located in its renovated warehouses and industrial buildings. It is also home to numerous restaurants, [[housewares]] shops, [[architecture|architects]], [[interior design|designers]], an [[advertising agency]], and other visual artists. The district also has several [[live music]] venues.

Numerous buildings in the neighborhood are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], including the [[TWA Corporate Headquarters Building]], [[Western Auto Building]], and [[Firestone Building]]. There are two historic groups of buildings also on the Register—Working Class Hotels at 19th &amp; Main Streets (Midwest Hotel, Monroe Hotel, and Rieger Hotel) and Crossroads Historic Freight District (industrial buildings clustered along the tracks north of [[Union Station (Kansas City, Missouri)|Union Station]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnr.mo.gov/shpo/jackson.htm |title=Jackson County National Register Listings |publisher=Missouri Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=January 26, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228180815/http://dnr.mo.gov/shpo/jackson.htm |archivedate=December 28, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crossroads district is also home to one of the county's largest remaining{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} examples of a Film Row district. The Film Row district consists of 17 buildings.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Following the demolition of a Film Row building, the Film Row district was placed on Missouri Preservation's 2013 list of "watched properties."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://preservemo.org/places-in-peril/2013-2/|title=Missouri’s Most Endangered 2013|date=2015-02-20|work=The Missouri Alliance for Historic Preservation|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' and ''[[The Pitch (newspaper)|The Pitch]]'' maintain offices in the neighborhood, along with [[HOK (firm)|HOK]] and [[Barkley Inc.|Barkley]]. The [[Belger Arts Center]] is also located in the district.

==First Fridays==
{{advert|section|date=August 2018}}
Art galleries generally open new shows on the first Friday of each month from 6 to 9 pm. This has become one of the region's most popular regular events as thousands of people flock to the Crossroads for gallery "open houses" amidst the Crossroads's unique atmosphere.

There are more than 60 galleries in the Crossroads district, making it one of the five largest arts districts in the US.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

==Crossroads Music Festival==
First held in late August 2005, the Crossroads Music Festival is an annual event organized by [http://www.spiceoflifeproductions.com Spice of Life Productions], which features local music artists. The 2005 event was held at Grinder's Sculpture Park (CrossroadsKC) at 18th Street and Locust Street. In addition to concert performances, offerings include [[short film]]s by local [[independent film]]makers and booths offering apparel by local designers, local independent print media, and [[carnival]] games.

==Tax abatements==
In 2007, one of Kansas City's development agencies began a program to allow property tax abatements for art-related business who would otherwise be priced out of the neighborhood by fast-rising property values. Neighborhood leaders lobbied for the program to prevent the "Soho Effect" of gentrification. Tax abatements had been granted to developers to attract new residents to the neighborhood with high-end condominiums and lofts next to the galleries.

They consist of a [[wikt:concave|concave]] depression, no more than a few centimetres across, pecked into a rock surface and often surrounded by concentric circles also etched into the stone. Sometimes a linear channel called a [[wikt:Special:Search/gutter|gutter]] leads out from the middle.  
The decoration occurs as a [[petroglyph]] on natural boulders and outcrops and also as an element of [[megalithic art]] on purposely worked [[megalith]]s such as the slab [[cist]]s of the [[Food Vessel culture]], some [[stone circle]]s and [[passage grave]]s such as the [[clava tomb]]s and on the [[Coping (architecture)|capstones]] at [[Newgrange]].

The site of [[Atlit Yam]], abandoned circa 6300 BCE and now under Israel's Mediterranean Sea coast south of [[Haifa]], features cup marks engraved into megalithic stones, some of which are set upright to form a semi-circle which has been referred to as resembling the UK's stonehenge but smaller,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marchant|first=Jo|date=25 November 2009|title=Deep Secrets: Atlit-Yam, Israel|journal=New Scientist|publisher=Reed Business Information Ltd.|issue=2736|pages=40, 41|issn=0262-4079|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427361.400-atlityam-israel.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jerusalem Post: http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ObSB-SsFQLEJ:www.jpost.com/Local-Israel/Around-Israel/Israels-Atlantis{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Israel Antiquities Authority: http://www.antiquities.org.il/article_Item_eng.asp?sec_id=14&amp;subj_id=139&lt;/ref&gt; with ceremonially buried bodies at the site, and potential alignments to the solstice, and/or to other stars, still being hypothesized as the site was only discovered in 2009 and undersea sites are difficult and expensive to explore.  Further inland, dating to ''at least'' 3000 BCE (exposed) and estimated ''up to'' 4000 BCE (unexcavated layer, under the layer which is exposed), is [[Rujm el-Hiri]], a [[cairn]] ([[tumulus]]) type of megalith, consisting of concentric circles (as cup marks also are ''concentric'' circles, but much smaller than Rogem Hiri) estimated to contain 40,000,000&amp;nbsp;kg of stones moved by humans, with an opening in the outer circle which aligns to the summer solstice (just as sites throughout Eurasia also align to solstices) and which has a burial chamber in the center, with thousands of [[dolmen]]s nearby, a "dolmen" being a 3rd and younger type of megalith found elsewhere in Eurasia, the oldest of which, thus far, are found in the UK, but date only to the 3rd millennium BCE in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Oldest archaeological org in Israel: http://www.hadashot-esi.org.il/report_detail_eng.aspx?id=1164&amp;mag_id=115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblewalks.com/Sites/Dolmens.html#Location|title=Dolmens - prehistoric megalith tombs|author=|date=|website=www.biblewalks.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
Precisely dating megalithic art is difficult: even if the megalithic monument can be dated, the art may be a later addition. The [[Hunterheugh Crags]] cup and ring marks near [[Alnwick]] in [[Northumberland]] have recently been demonstrated to date back into the [[Early Neolithic]] era through their [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] relationship with other, datable features. Some cup marks have been found in [[Iron Age]] contexts but these may represent re-used stones.

Where they are etched onto natural, flat stone it has been observed that they seem to incorporate the natural surface of the rock. Those at Hunterheugh are mostly connected to one another by gutters that can channel rainwater from one to the next, down the sloping top of the stone.
It has been suggested by [[archaeologist]] [[Clive Waddington]] that the initial Early Neolithic impetus to create the marks was forgotten and that the practice fell into abeyance until a second phase of creation continued the basic tradition but with less precision and more variability in design. The markers of this second phase moved the art from natural stones to megaliths as its symbolism was reinterpreted by Later Neolithic and Early Bronze Age people.

Their purpose is unknown although some may be connected with natural stone outcrops exploited by Neolithic peoples to make polished stone axes. A religious purpose has been suggested.
[[Alexander Thom]] suggested in a [[BBC]] [[television]] documentary, ''Cracking the Stone Age Code'', in 1970, "I have an idea, entirely nebulous at the moment, that the cup and ring markings were a method of recording, of writing, and that they may indicate, once we can read them, what a particular stone was for. We have seen the cup and ring markings on the stone at [[Kilmartin Glen|Temple Wood]], and that's on the main stone but we can't interpret them ...yet."&lt;ref name="The Spectator"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Spectator, p. 608|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oBw-AQAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 April 2011|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; He created diagrams and carried out analysis of over 50 of the cup and ring markings from which he determined a length he termed the [[Megalithic Yard|Megalithic Inch]] (MI).&lt;ref&gt;Systematics: The Journal of the Institute for the comparative study of History, Philosophy and the Sciences, Vol. 6, Number 3, Coombe Spring Press., December 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

This whole idea has been ignored almost completely apart from a critical analysis carried out by Alan Davis in the 1980s, who tested Thom's hypothesis on cup and ring sites in England by examining the separations of neighbouring cupmark centres. He found some weak evidence for the "Megalithic Inch" but it was not statistically significant, and he suggested "strongest indications...towards the use of a quantum close in value to 5 MI at certain sites" and that "the apparent quantum seems strongly associated with ringed cups."&lt;ref name="Ruggles2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Davis in Clive Ruggles|title=Records in Stone: Papers in Memory of Alexander Thom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oZ3JGYd1kJoC&amp;pg=PA422|accessdate=30 April 2011|date=13 February 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-53130-6|pages=392–422}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis made an initial effort to build on Thom's start, and to answer the question he posed: "Why should a man spend hours – or rather days – cutting cups in a random fashion on a rock? It would indeed be a breakthrough if someone could crack the code of the cups."&lt;ref name="Ruggles2003"/&gt;

Subsequently, Davis investigated the idea that the prehistoric carvers used an elementary method of diameter-construction in laying out the carvings. This investigation (incorporating both Scottish and English sites) suggested a possible explanation for many of the characteristic shapes of carved rings, and also produced evidence in the ring diameters for the use of a unit of measurement close to Thom's MI (and 5 MI) that was of high statistical significance. The evidence is consistent with the use of rough measures such as hand- and finger-widths (rather than the formal, accurate system proposed by Thom), but the important conclusion is that a similar design ritual, apparently involving a consistent measurement system of some kind, was in use over a wide geographical area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MacKie|first1=E.

'''Dallas ArtsPartners''' (AP) is a program run by the [[501(c)3]] [[nonprofit organization]] [[Big Thought]] and is a community collaboration between the [[Dallas Independent School District]] (DISD), the City of [[Dallas]] Office of Cultural Affairs, and more than 60 professional arts and cultural organizations.

Big Thought’s responsibilities to the program include program design and implementation, private sector fund raising, governance, and fiscal management. Dallas ArtsPartners, recognized as an exemplary program by the [[Texas School Performance Review]], was established in 1998. The initiative was born soon after the Dallas Cultural Affairs Commission Long Range Planning Committee commissioned a study to determine the availability and accessibility of educational outreach programming offered by the city’s arts and cultural institutions. 
The data collected indicated that while some public schools received multiple performances, residencies, and field trips, many received none. In response to these findings, and recognizing the potential educational benefits of these programs, the City of Dallas teamed with the Dallas Independent School District to create Dallas ArtsPartners.

The Dallas ArtsPartners was designed to:
# Provide all DISD elementary students with equal access to high quality arts programs offered by the city’s professional arts and cultural institutions.
# Train every DISD elementary classroom teacher to integrate those programs into the curriculum to benefit student academic achievement and learning in the arts and ensure that ArtsPartners is an institutional, sustainable part of Dallas’ school district and cultural community and a suitable model for replication across the nation.

Dallas ArtsPartners coordinates both school day programs that integrate programming across the [[curriculum]], and after school (21st Century Community Learning Centers) and summer (Summer in the City) programs that provide curriculum support. All AP programs directly support the state curriculum standards, [[Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills]] (TEKS) and offer links to every core curriculum subject. Fine Arts TEKS were informed by the [[National Standards for the Arts]].

The estimated 15,000 programs provided by AP’s cultural partners incorporates dozens of arts and cultural disciplines each year and include:
# in-school performances
# field trip performances
# artist residencies
# master classes
# workshops
# guided tours

AP promotes educators’ success in integrating arts and cultural resources into curricula by providing a tiered Professional Development System that employs multiple trainings and educational materials. Every DISD elementary teacher receives AP’s services. 
AP’s three-year plus longitudinal study examines the effects of AP on students, teachers, and cultural organizations. The study is longitudinal, rigorous, intensive, collaborative and literacy-focused.

Dallas ArtsPartners serves every public elementary school in the city of Dallas; a total of 156 schools, 101,000 children and 6,000 elementary educators.

The film is an adaptation of the [[Heinrich von Kleist]] novella ''[[The Earthquake in Chile]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Julia. ''Women and the New German Cinema''. [[Verso Books]], 1992. {{ISBN|0860915689}}, 9780860915683. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=YmmTv4NiZ-UC&amp;pg=PA96 96].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Handsome Jeronimo Rugera is hired to tutor the rich heiress, Josephe Asteron. They fall in love, yet the [[Catholic Church|church]] forbids their relationship, and Josephe is hidden in a convent. When the church discovers she is [[pregnancy|pregnant]], Josephe is sentenced to death by [[decapitation]]. Jeronimo tracks her down, yet is [[prison|jail]]ed before he can rescue her. When fate intervenes in the form of a massive earthquake, the two lovers have no idea what is in store for them. Sanders-Brahms uses a voice-over of the first and final sentences of the book, placing them in the beginning and end of the film.&lt;ref name=Martinp671/&gt;

==Analysis==
According to critic Elaine Martin, author of the scholarly article "Rewrites and Remakes: Screen Adaptations of Romantic Works," the film director "erases the uncanny aspect of Kleist's tale and replaces it with a socio-political explanation" and intended to politicize the earthquake narrative's context in a higher degree compared to the original work.&lt;ref name=Martinp671/&gt; For the adaptation Sanders-Brahms uses parallel plotlines that intersect in the end instead of the flashbacks used in the original work. Sanders-Brahms created story segments referred to by Martin as "pre-stories, as it were."&lt;ref name=Martinp671&gt;Martin, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=G8aokatYPsQC&amp;pg=PA671&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 671].&lt;/ref&gt; Martin states that the new segments "locate" the characters "socially and temperamentally."&lt;ref name=Martinp671/&gt; In addition Sanders-Brahms removed the nineteenth century Prussia context, what Martin calls "the stage that represents Kleist's narrative filter."&lt;ref name=Martinp671/&gt; The author added that the ending of the film is "less sanguine" compared to the novella because the director added a "veiled reference" to the "economic value" of the surviving child.&lt;ref name=Martinp671/&gt; The child is scheduled to inherit the wealth of the parents, who are dead.&lt;ref name=Martinp671/&gt; She further wrote that in the film Don Fernando is "a cooly calculating businessman, shaped by a bourgeois business mentality" instead of a "divine hero."&lt;ref name=Martinp671/&gt;

==Reception==
Film critic Greg Titian wrote a generally negative review of the film in which he stated that "''Earthquake in Chile'' throws the audience into the story with scant setup. Narration at the opening sets the scene in a way that was dissatisfying to this reviewer [...] I felt that ''Earthquake in Chile'' made emotional demands on the audience without properly establishing an emotional attachment in the audience to those characters [...] Perhaps I missed the point, or the historical significance of this particular piece of German cinema, but the predictable storyline, in my estimation, ultimately falls a bit flat," though he nevertheless praised the fact that the "DVD sports a very high quality transfer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmsinreview.com/2009/07/13/earthquake-in-chile/|title=''Earthquake in Chile''|last=Titian|first=Greg|date=13 July 2009|website=Films in Review|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Der Spiegel]]'''s critic Siegfried Schober's review made similar negative remarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magazin.spiegel.de/EpubDelivery/spiegel/pdf/41521250|title=Mit Marx und Kitsch|last=Schober|first=Siegfried|date=24 March 1975|publisher=''[[Der Spiegel]]'', Nummer 13, S. 145|accessdate=13 January 2014|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The director made the 1976 film ''Heinrich'' because, during work on ''Earthquake in Chile'', she developed an interest in the work's original author.&lt;ref name=Martinp671/&gt;

'''''Gaspard de la Nuit — Fantaisies à la manière de Rembrandt et de Callot''''' ({{lang-en|Gaspard of the Night — Fantasies in the Manner of [[Rembrandt]] and [[Jacques Callot|Callot]]}}) is a compilation of [[prose poetry|prose poems]] by Italian-born French poet [[Aloysius Bertrand]]. Considered one of the first examples of modern prose poetry, it was published in [[1842 in literature|1842]], one year after Bertrand's death from [[tuberculosis]], from a manuscript dated 1836,&lt;ref&gt;See Bertrand Guégan (Ed.), ''Gaspard de la Nuit, Fantaisies à la manière de Rembrandt et de Callot par Aloysius Bertrand. Edition publiée d'après le manuscrit de l'auteur.'' With a biographical introduction by [[Sainte-Beuve]]. (Payot, Paris 1925), p. 1. The MS title page includes an imprimatur for Eugéne Renduel, Libraire-Editeur, Rue des Grands-Augustins, 22 and the date 1836.&lt;/ref&gt; by his friend [[David d'Angers]]. The text includes a short address to [[Victor Hugo]] and another to [[Charles Nodier]], and a Memoir of Bertrand written by [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve|Sainte-Beuve]] was included in the original 1842 edition.

The poems themselves are expressed with a strong [[Romantic poetry|romanticist]] verve, and explore fantasies of medieval Europe.

==Theme and structure==
The author tells an introductory story of how he sat in a garden in [[Dijon]], and fell into conversation with a dishevelled old man who sat near him leafing through a book.&lt;ref&gt;B. Guégan, ''Gaspard de la Nuit'' (1925), pp. 3-24.&lt;/ref&gt; The stranger recognizes him to be a poet, and speaks of how he has spent his life searching for the meaning of Art ('L'art est la science du poète'), and for the elements or principles of Art. The first principle, what was ''sentiment'' in Art, was revealed to him by the discovery of some little book inscribed Gott - Liebe ('Dieu et Amour', God and Love): to have loved and to have prayed.

Then he became preoccupied by what constituted ''idea'' in Art, and, having studied nature and the works of man through thirty years, at the cost of his youth, he wondered if the second principle, that of idea, might be [[Satan]]. But after a night of storm and colic in the church of Notre-Dame of Dijon, in which clarity shone through the shadows ('Une clarté piqua les ténèbres'), he concluded that the devil did not exist, that Art existed in the bosom of God, and that we are merely the copyists of the Creator.

Then the old stranger thrusts into the poet's hand the book, his own manuscript, telling all the attempts of his lips to find the instrument which gives the pure and expressive note - every trial upon the canvas before the subtle dawn-glow of the 'clair-obscur' or [[chiaroscuro|clarity in shadow]] appeared there - the novel experiments of harmony and colour, the only products of his nocturnal deliberations. The old man goes off to write his Will, saying he will come back to collect his book tomorrow. The manuscript is, naturally, ''Gaspard de la Nuit. Fantaisies à la manière de Rembrandt et de Callot''. The next day the poet returns to restore the book to its owner, who does not come: he asks after M. Gaspard de la Nuit, to which the answer is that he is probably in Hell unless he is out on his travels - for he is, of course, the devil. 'May he roast there!' says the poet. 'I shall publish his book.'

A short preface attributed to Gaspard himself&lt;ref&gt;B. Guégan, ''Gaspard de la Nuit'' (1925), pp. 25-6.&lt;/ref&gt; explains that the artists [[Rembrandt|Paul Rembrandt]] and [[Jacques Callot]] represent two eternally reverse or antithetic faces of Art: one the philosopher absorbed in meditation and prayer upon the spirits of beauty, science, wisdom and love, seeking to penetrate the symbols of nature, and the other the showy figure who parades about the street, rows in the taverns, caresses bohemian girls, always swears by his rapier, and whose main preoccupation is waxing his moustache. But in considering Art under this double personification he has included studies upon other artists among his poetic meditations, which he has not presented as a formal literary theory because [[François Dominique Séraphin|M. Séraphin]] has not explained to him the mechanism of his Chinese shadow-plays, and [[Pulcinella|Punchinello]] conceals from curious viewers the thread which makes his arm move.

The ''Fantaisies'' of Gaspard de la Nuit, each of a few short paragraphs or extended strophes (and every one of them prefaced by a short literary quotation), are then arranged in six short books entitled 'Ecole Flamande' (Flemish School) (9 pieces), 'Le Vieux Paris' (Old Paris) (10), 'La Nuit et ses Prestiges' (The Night and its Marvels) (11), 'Les Chroniques' (The Chronicles) (8), 'Espagne et Italie' (Spain and Italy) (8), and 'Silves' (6). There is also a group of 13 separate pieces not in the finished collection but found among the author's manuscripts, which include 'Le Gibet', the received version of 'Scarbo', and a piece addressed to the sculptor M. David.&lt;ref&gt;B. Guégan, ''Gaspard de la Nuit'' (1925), pp. 189-222.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The book had an important influence upon other poets, mostly French, including [[Charles Baudelaire]], through whom the importance of the work came to be recognized. The most famous tribute was the Suite, ''[[Gaspard de la Nuit|Gaspard de la Nuit: Trois poèmes pour piano d'après Aloysius Bertrand]]'', of three piano pieces by [[Maurice Ravel]] based on three items, namely 'Ondine', 'Scarbo' and 'Le Gibet'. This was first performed in 1909.&lt;ref name="The Guardian - 26Oct2001 - Ravel: Gaspard de la Nuit"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2001/oct/26/shopping.artsfeatures3|title=Ravel: Gaspard de la Nuit|last=Clements|first=Andrew|date=26 October 2001|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Le Gibet' was one of the supplementary pieces not included in the original 1836 manuscript, and the version of 'Scarbo' alluded to by Ravel was in the same category. The original 'Scarbo' (a different text), and 'Ondine', are numbers (ii) and (ix) respectively of the third book of Fantaisies, ''La Nuit et ses Prestiges''.&lt;ref&gt;B. Guégan, ''Gaspard de la Nuit'' (1925): '(ii) Scarbo' and '(ix) Ondine' in the manuscript, pp. 89-90 and 106-07; Pièces détachées, 'Le Gibet' pp. 217-18 and 'Scarbo' (as quoted by Ravel), pp. 219-20.&lt;/ref&gt; When Ravel wrote his music, the 1925 edition based on the manuscript had not yet been published.

==Translations==
The book has been largely unknown outside France, particularly in English-speaking countries, owing mostly to the lack of translations. Translated excerpts from the book appeared early on in various publications. Paul Zweig's 1964 compilation entitled ''A Selection from Gaspard of the Night'' is one example. However, there was no complete English translation of ''Gaspard'' until that in 1977 by John T. Wright, a professor of French and English at the [[University of South Carolina]], based on the 1925 Bertrand Guégan edition of the 1836 manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;John T. Wright, ''Louis "Aloysius" Bertrand's Gaspard de la Nuit: Fantasies in the Manner of Rembrandt and Callot'', 1st Edn. (Washington, University Press of America 1977); 2nd Edn. (Lanham, MD, University Press of America, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; A translation and adaptation by the poet [[Donald Sidney-Fryer]] published in 2004 includes notes and introductory studies.&lt;ref&gt;Aloysius Bertrand, ''Gaspard de la Nuit'', Translated and adapted by Donald Sidney-Fryer (Black Coat Press, Encino, California 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guy Louis Debord''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˈ|b|ɔr}}; {{IPA-fr|gi dəbɔʁ|lang}}; 28 December 1931 – 30 November 1994) was a French [[Marxist]] theorist, philosopher, [[filmmaker]], member of the [[Letterist International]], founder of a Letterist faction, and founding member of the [[Situationist International]] (SI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/14/Dead_Bored_Debords_Dead|title=Dead Bored: Debord's Dead!  Andrew Hussey on the death of a turbulent thinker|last=|first=|date=|website=Philosophynow.org|publisher=|access-date=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also briefly a member of ''[[Socialisme ou Barbarie]]''.

==Early life==
Guy Debord (also known as "Debord Guy") was born in [[Paris, France|Paris]] in 1931. Debord's father, Martial, was a pharmacist who died due to illness when Debord was young. Debord's mother, Paulette Rossi, sent Guy to live with his grandmother in her family villa in Italy. During World War II, the Rossis left the villa and began to travel from town to town. As a result, Debord attended high school in Cannes, where he began his interest in film and [[vandalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bourseiller, Christophe. "Vie et Mort de Guy Debord". Agora.&lt;/ref&gt; As a young man, Debord actively opposed the [[Algerian War|French war in Algeria]] and joined in demonstrations in Paris against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notbored.org/guillaume.html|title=Pierre Guillaume Remembers Guy Debord|website=Notbored.org|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debord studied Law at the University of Paris, but left early and did not complete his university education. After ending his stint at the University of Paris, he began his career as a writer.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guy Debord, Concept of the Spectacle|last=Jappe|first=A|publisher=Berkely, CA: University of California Press.|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Involvement with the Letterists ==
Debord joined the [[Lettrism|Letterist International]] when he was 19. The Letterists were led dictatorially by [[Isidore Isou]] until a widely agreed upon schism ended Isou's authority. This schism gave rise to several factions of Letterists, one of which was decidedly led by Debord upon Gil Wolman's unequivocal recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;Bourseiller, ibid&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, Debord led the [[Situationist International]] group, which influenced the Paris Uprising of [[May 1968 in France|1968]], during which he took part in the occupation of the Sorbonne. Some consider his book ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' (1967) to be a catalyst for the uprising,&lt;ref&gt;Andreotti, L. "Review: Leaving the twentieth century: The Situationist International." ''Journal of Architectural Education, 49''(3), p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; although perhaps a more immediately significant text was [[Mustapha Khayati]]'s "[[On the Poverty of Student Life]]", published in November 1966.

==Founding of the Situationist International==
In 1957, the Letterist International, the [[International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus]], and the [[London Psychogeographical Association]] gathered in Cosio d'Arroscia (Cuneo), Italy, to found the Situationist International, with Debord having been the leading representative of the Letterist delegation. Initially made up of a number of well-known artists such as Asger Jorn and Pinot Gallizio, the early days of the SI were heavily focused on the formulation of a critique of art, which would serve as a foundation for the group's future entrance into further political critiques. The SI was known for a number of its interventions in the art world, which included one raid against an international art conference in Belgium during 1958&lt;ref&gt;Internationale Situationniste No. 1, June 1958, pages 29-30,&lt;/ref&gt; that included a large pamphlet drop and significant media coverage, all of which culminated in the arrest of various situationists and sympathizers associated with the scandal. In addition to this action, the SI endeavored to formulate industrial painting, or, painting prepared en masse with the intent of defaming the original value largely associated with the art of the period. In the course of these actions, Debord was heavily involved in the planning and logistical work associated with preparing these interventions, as well as the work for ''Internationale Situationniste'' associated with theoretical defense of the Situationist International's actions.&lt;ref&gt;Debord, Guy. ''Correspondence: The Founding of the Situationist International. ''Semiotext(e). 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political phase of the Situationist International==
In the early 1960s Debord began to direct the SI toward an end of its artistic phase, eventually expelling members such as Jorn, Gallizio, Troche, and Constant—the bulk of the "artistic" wing of the SI—by 1965. Having established the situationist critique of art as a social and political critique, one not to be carried out in traditional artistic activities, the SI began, due in part to Debord's contributions, to pursue a more concise theoretical critique of capitalist society along Marxist lines.

With Debord's 1967 work, ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'', and excerpts from the group's journal, ''Internationale Situationniste'', the Situationists began to formulate their theory of the spectacle, which explained the nature of late capitalism's historical decay. In Debord's terms, situationists defined the spectacle as an assemblage of social relations transmitted via the imagery of class power, and as a period of capitalist development wherein "all that was once lived has moved into representation".{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} With this theory, Debord and the SI would go on to play an influential role in the [[May 1968 events in France|revolts of May 1968 in France]], with many of the protesters drawing their slogans from Situationist tracts penned or influenced by Debord.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the Situationist International==
[[File:In girum imus nocte et consumimur igni.JPG|thumb|left|Published by [[Éditions Gérard Lebovici]] (1990)]]
In 1972, Debord disbanded the Situationist International after its original members, including [[Asger Jorn]] and [[Raoul Vaneigem]], quit or were expelled. (Vaneigem wrote a biting criticism of Debord and the International.&lt;ref&gt;"The Veritable Split in the SI", 1972&lt;/ref&gt;) Debord then focused on filmmaking with financial backing from the movie mogul and publisher, [[Gérard Lebovici]] (éditions [[Champ Libre]]), until Lebovici's mysterious death. Debord was suspected of Lebovici's murder. Distraught by the accusations and his friend's death, Debord took his films and writings out of production until after his death. He had agreed to have his films released posthumously at the request of the American researcher, [[Thomas Y. Levin]].&lt;ref&gt;Guy Debord, "Reflections of the Death of Gérard Lebovici"&lt;/ref&gt; Debord's two most recognized films are ''[[The Society of the Spectacle (film)|Society of the Spectacle]]'' (1973) and "{{Interlanguage link multi|In girum imus nocte et consumimur igni|fr}}" (1978).

After dissolving the Situationist International, Debord spent his time reading, and occasionally writing, in relative isolation in a cottage at Champot with Alice Becker-Ho, his second wife. He continued to correspond on political and other issues, notably with Lebovici and the Italian situationist [[Gianfranco Sanguinetti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notbored.org/debord.html|title=Guy Debord|website=Notbored.org|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He focused on reading material relating to war strategies, e.g. [[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitz]] and [[Sun Tzu]], and he designed a [[A Game of War|war game]] with [[Alice Becker-Ho]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.fr/dp/2070776514 |title=Le Jeu de la Guerre: RelevÃ© des positions successives de toutes les forces au cours d'une partie - Guy Debord, Alice Becker-Ho - Livres |website=Amazon.fr |date= |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debord married twice, first to [[Michèle Bernstein]] and then [[Alice Becker-Ho]]. Debord had affairs with other women, including [[Michèle Mochot-Bréhat]]. Bernstein wrote a vaguely fictional but detailed account of the open relationships Mochot and she had with Debord in her novel ''All The King's Horses''.

== Death ==
Just before Debord's death, he filmed (although did not publish) a documentary, "Son art et son temps" ("His Art and His Times"), an autobiography of sorts that focused primarily on social issues in Paris in the 1990s. It has been suggested that his dark depiction of this period was a suicide note of sorts. Both Debord's depression and alcohol consumption had become problematic, resulting in a form of [[neuritis|polyneuritis]]. Perhaps in order to end the suffering caused by these conditions, Debord committed suicide by shooting himself in the head (or possibly heart) on 30 November 1994. This was not the first time he attempted to end his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guy Debord and the Situationist International|last=McDonough|first=|publisher=|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debord's suicide is as controversial as it is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Andrew Hussey |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jul/28/biography.artsandhumanities |title=The suicide of Guy Debord &amp;#124; Books |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some assert it was a revolutionary act related to his career. Due to his involvement with the radical [[Situationist International]] (SI), as well as his sadness at 'the society as a spectacle' being considered a cliché in later life, many think that Debord felt hopeless about the very society he was trying to shed light on. Debord was said to be "victim of the Spectacle he fought".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/aug/25/biography.highereducation1|title=The Game of War: The Life and Death of Guy Debord|last=Baker|first=|date=August 2001|website=|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the many commentaries on Debord's demise, one scholar noted: "Guy Debord did not kill himself. He was murdered by the thoughtlessness and selfishness of so-called scholars (primarily trendy lit-criters) who colonized his brilliant ideas and transformed his radical politics into an academic status symbol not worth the pulp it's printed on…"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://situationnisteblog.wordpress.com/2014/10/11/transgressions-a-journal-of-urban-exploration-1995-2001/ |title=Transgressions: A Journal of Urban Exploration [1995-2001&amp;#93; |website=Situationnisteblog.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
On 29 January 2009, fifteen years after his death, [[Christine Albanel]], [[Minister of Culture (France)|Minister of Culture]], classified the archive of his works as a "[[national treasure]]" in response to a sale request by [[Yale University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://juralibertaire.over-blog.com/article-28060152.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=19 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002091839/http://juralibertaire.over-blog.com/article-28060152.html |archivedate=2 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/mar/18/guy-debord-situationist-international | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | location=London | title=The resurrection of Guy Debord | first=Andrew | last=Gallix | date=18 March 2009 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry declared that "he has been one of the most important contemporary thinkers, with a capital place in history of ideas from the second half of the twentieth century."&lt;ref&gt;Journal Officiel de la Republique Francaise du 12 fevrier 2009 (texte 120)&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Debord once called his book, ''The Society of the Spectacle'', "the most important book of the twentieth century".{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} He continues to be a canonical and controversial figure particularly among European scholars of radical politics and modern art.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Written works==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}
{{Left communism sidebar |expanded=People}}
Guy Debord's best known works are his theoretical books, ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and ''[[Comments on the Society of the Spectacle]]''. In addition to these he wrote a number of autobiographical books including ''Mémoires'', ''Panégyrique'', ''Cette Mauvaise Réputation...'', and ''Considérations sur l'assassinat de [[Gérard Lebovici]]''. He was also the author of numerous short pieces, sometimes anonymous, for the journals ''Potlatch'', ''Les Lèvres Nues'', ''Les Chats Sont Verts'', and ''Internationale Situationniste''. The [[The Society of the Spectacle|''Society of the spectacle'']] was written in an "interesting prose", unlike most writings in that time or of that nature. For Debord, the Spectacle is viewed as false representations in our real lives. The [[Spectacle (critical theory)|Spectacle]] is a materialized worldview. The spectacle 'subjects human beings to itself'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Society of the Spectacle|last=Debord|first=Guy|publisher=Canberra : Hobgoblin Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debord was deeply distressed by the [[Cultural hegemony|hegemony]] of governments and media over everyday life through mass production and consumption. He criticized both the [[capitalism]] of the West and the dictatorial [[communism]] of the Eastern bloc for the lack of autonomy allowed to individuals by both types of governmental structure. Debord postulated that [[Marx's theory of alienation|Alienation]] had gained a new relevance through the invasive forces of the '[[Spectacle (critical theory)|spectacle]]' - "a social relation between people that is mediated by images" consisting of [[mass media]], [[Advertising|advertisement]], and [[popular culture]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The spectacle is a self-fulfilling control mechanism for society. Debord's analysis developed the notions of "[[reification (Marxism)|reification]]" and [[commodity fetishism|"fetishism of the commodity"]] pioneered by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Georg Lukács]]. [[Semiotics of culture|Semiotics]] was also a major influence, particularly the work of his contemporary, Roland Barthes, who was the first to envisage bourgeois society as a spectacle, and to study in detail the political function of fashion within that spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Sollers "L'antifascisme de Barthes", Le Monde // Hors-Série Roland Barthes, Juillet-Août, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Debord's analysis of "the spectaclist society" probed the historical, economic, and psychological roots of the media and popular culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Central to this school of thought was the claim that alienation is more than an emotive description or an aspect of individual psychology: rather, it is a consequence of the mercantile form of social organization that has reached its climax in capitalism, as theorized by [[Herbert Marcuse]] of the [[Frankfurt School]]. 
{{Libertarian socialism |expanded=People}}
The Situationist International (SI), a political/artistic movement organized by Debord and his colleagues and represented by a journal of the same name, attempted to create a series of strategies for engaging in class struggle by reclaiming individual autonomy from the spectacle. These strategies, including "[[dérive]]" and "[[détournement]]," drew on the traditions of [[Lettrism]]. As founder of the SI, it has been suggested that Debord felt driven to generalize and define the values, ideas, and characteristics of the entire group, which may have contributed to his hand-picking and expulsion of members. The hierarchical and dictatorial nature of the SI existed, however, in the groups that birthed it, including the Letterists and the Surrealists.

Debord's first book, ''[[Mémoires]]'', was bound with a [[sandpaper]] cover so that it would damage other books placed next to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newshelton.com/wet/dry/?p=10356 |title=the new shelton wet/dry |website=Newshelton.com |date=10 January 2013 |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debord has been the subject of numerous biographies, works of fiction, artworks, and songs, many of which are catalogued in the bibliography by Shigenobu Gonzalves, "Guy Debord ou la Beauté du Negatif."

Often, it is suggested that Debord was opposed to the creation of art, however, Debord writes in the Situationist International magazine ("Contre le Cinema") that he believes that "ordinary" (quotidian) people should make "everyday" (quotidian) art; art and creation should liberate from the [[Spectacle (critical theory)|spectacle]], from capitalism, and from the banality of everyday life in contemporary society. In "The Society of the Spectacle," Debord argues that it is the price put on art that destroys the integrity of the art object, not the material or the creation itself. It is important to note that Debord does not equate art to "the spectacle."

==Films==

Debord began an interest in film early in his life when he lived in Cannes in the late 1940s. Debord recounted that, during his youth, he was allowed to do very little other than attend films. He said that he frequently would leave in the middle of a film screening to go home because films often bored him. Debord joined the Lettrists just as [[Isidore Isou]] was producing films and the Lettrists attempted to sabotage [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s trip to Paris through negative criticism.

Overall, Debord challenged the conventions of filmmaking; prompting his audience to interact with the medium instead of being passive receivers of information. As a matter of fact, his film ''Hurlements'' exclusively consists of a series of black and white screens and silence with a bit of commentary dispersed throughout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Howls for Guy Debord|journal=Film Quarterly|volume=62 |issue=4 |pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debord directed his first film, ''[[Hurlements en faveur de Sade]]'' in 1952 with the voices of Michèle Bernstein and Gil Wolman. The film has no images represented; instead, it shows bright white when there is speaking and black when there is not. Long silences separate speaking parts. The film ends with 24 minutes of black silence. People were reported to have become angry and left screenings of this film. The script is composed of quotes appropriated from various sources and made into a montage with a sort of non-linear narrative.

Later, through the financial support of Michèle Bernstein and Asger Jorn, Debord produced a second film, ''Sur le passage de quelques personnes à travers une assez courte unité de temps'', which combined scenes with his friends and scenes from mass media culture. This integration of Debord's world with mass media culture became a running motif climaxing with "The Society of the Spectacle". Debord wrote the book ''The Society of the Spectacle'' before writing the movie. When asked why he made the book into a movie, Debord said, "I don't understand why this surprised people. The book was already written like a script". Debord's last film, "Son Art et Son Temps", was not produced during his lifetime. It worked as a final statement where Debord recounted his works and a cultural documentary of "his time".

'''Hagia Sophia''' ({{lang-el|Ἁγία Σοφία}}, meaning "Holy Wisdom" {{lang-tr|Ayasofya}}) is a museum, formerly [[Greek Orthodox]] church which was converted into a [[mosque]] in 1584, and located in [[Trabzon]], in the north-eastern part of [[Turkey]]. It dates back to the thirteenth century when Trabzon was the capital of the [[Empire of Trebizond]]. It is located near the seashore and two miles west of the medieval town's limits. It is one of a few dozen [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] sites still extant in the area. It has been described as being "regarded as one of the finest examples of Byzantine architecture."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21582317-fine-byzantine-church-turkey-has-been-converted-mosque-erasing-christian-past Religion in Turkey: Erasing the Christian past]." ''[[The Economist]]''. July 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Hagia Sophia was built in Trebizond during the reign of [[Manuel I of Trebizond|Manuel I]] between 1238 and 1263.&lt;ref&gt;Eastmond, Anthony. "The Byzantine Empires in the Thirteenth Century" in ''Art and Identity in Thirteenth-Century Byzantium: Hagia Sophia and the Empire of Trebizond''. Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2004, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest graffiti carved in the apses of the church contain the dates 1291 and 1293.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gabriel Millet]], [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/bch_0007-4217_1895_num_19_1_3650 "Les monastères et les églises de Trébizonde"], ''Bulletin de correspondance hellénique'', '''19''' (1895), p. 428&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Mehmed II]] conquered the city in 1461, the church was possibly converted into a mosque and its frescos covered in whitewash. Other scholars suggest it was not converted until 1584, being spared the initial transformation because it stood several kilometers outside the city walls. The monastery next door continued to be used by monks as late as 1701, when Tournefort found them still in residence. It is likely that the monks gradually abandoned a building that failed to protect them from harassment and predation, and the Turks assumed its use without needing to expel them. &lt;ref&gt;Millet, ''Les monastères'', p. 433&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]] and for a brief period afterward, the city was occupied by the [[Russian military]] and used as a makeshift hospital and depot. Afterwards it was put back into use as a mosque, until 1964 when it was turned into a museum - which it remains to this day. Between 1958 and 1964 the surviving frescoes were uncovered and the church consolidated with the help of experts from the [[University of Edinburgh]] and the General Directorate of Foundations; one expert involved in the work estimated no more than one-sixth of the original decorations had survived.&lt;ref&gt;Some details of the preservation can be read in David Winfield, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1505228 "Sancta Sophia, Trebizond: A Note on the Cleaning and Conservation Work"], ''Studies in Conservation'', Vol. 8, No. 4 (Nov., 1963), pp. 117-130.&lt;/ref&gt; All that did survive, however, are thought to be original works done just after its construction, and are considered part of the Byzantine 'Palaiologic Renaissance'.

The Hagia Sophia church is an important example of late [[Byzantine architecture]], being characterised by a high central [[dome]] and four large column arches supporting the weight of the dome and ceiling. Below the dome is an ''[[Opus sectile]]'' pavement of multicolored stones.  The church was built with a cross-in-square plan, but with an exterior form that takes the shape of a cross thanks to prominent north and south porches. The structure is 22 metres long, 11.6 metres wide and 12.7 metres tall.  The late 13th-century frescos, revealed during the University of Edinburgh restoration, illustrate [[New Testament]] themes. External stone figurative reliefs and other ornamenting is in keeping with local traditions found in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. 24 metres to the west of the church is a tall bell tower, 40 metres high. It was built in 1427 and houses a small chapel on its second floor. The internal walls of the bell tower are covered in frescoes. It was also used as an observatory by local astronomers.

===Mosque conversion===
{{see also|Conversion of non-Muslim places of worship into mosques}}
In 2012, the religious authorities (Diyanet) filed a lawsuit against the ministry of culture, claiming the ministry had been 'illegally occupying' the church for some decades. The Diyanet won the case, getting ownership of the building. On 5 July 2013, the former church was partially converted for a while into a mosque according to the local Vakif Direction of Trabzon, which is the owner of the estate. The reconstruction works have already been started.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://Andrew%20Finkel%20%22Mosque%20conversion%20raises%20alarm%22%20Art%20Newspaper Mosque conversion raises alarm]."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Bartholomew-I:-Do-not-transform-Hagia-Sophia-in-Trabzon-into-a-mosque-25568.html Bartholomew I: Do not transform Hagia Sophia in Trabzon into a mosque]."&lt;/ref&gt; Some frescoes were veiled and the floor covered by a carpet. The [[mufti]] of the Turkish province Trabzon said that “the works for opening the Hagia Sophia mosque in the city to practice prayers again are going on,” and that “during the prayer the mural paintings will be covered by curtains". The local union of architects from Trabzon filed a lawsuit against the ministry of religious affairs' conversion plan. A local judge ruled the transformation of the former church to be illegal, and ordered it to be maintained as a museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kerknet.be/actua/nieuws_detail.php?nieuwsID=118324 Hagia Sophia to remain museum] Kerknet, 6 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural significance==
The church figures prominently and has key significance for the author's spiritual development in [[Rose Macaulay]]'s novel ''[[The Towers of Trebizond]]''.

{{nihongo|'''Japanese painting'''|絵画||kaiga, also gadō 画道}} is one of the oldest and most highly refined of the [[Japanese art|Japanese visual arts]], encompassing a wide variety of genres and styles. As with the history of Japanese arts in general, the long history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native [[Japanese aesthetics]] and the adaptation of imported ideas, mainly from [[Chinese painting]] which was especially influential at a number of points; significant [[Western painting|Western]] influence only comes from the later 16th century onwards, beginning at the same time as Japanese art [[Japonisme|was influencing that of the West]]. 

Areas of subject matter where Chinese influence has been repeatedly significant include Buddhist religious painting, [[ink-wash painting]] of landscapes in the Chinese [[literati painting]] tradition, calligraphy of ideographs,&lt;ref&gt;J. Conder, Paintings and studies by Kawanabe Kyôsai, 1911, Kawanabe Kyôsai Memorial Museum, Japan: "It is sometimes said that Japanese painting is merely another kind of writing, but..." p.27&lt;/ref&gt; and the painting of animals and plants, especially birds and flowers.  However distinctively Japanese traditions have developed in all these fields.  The subject matter that is widely regarded as most characteristic of Japanese painting, and later [[printmaking]], is the depiction of scenes from everyday life and narrative scenes that are often crowded with figures and detail.  This tradition no doubt began in the early medieval period under Chinese influence that is now beyond tracing except in the most general terms, but from the period of the earliest surviving works had developed into a specifically Japanese tradition that lasted until the modern period.

The official [[List of National Treasures of Japan (paintings)]] includes 158 works or sets of works from the 8th to the 19th century (though including a number of Chinese paintings that have long been in Japan) that represent peaks of achievement, or very rare survivals from early periods.

==Timeline==

===Ancient Japan and Asuka period (until 710)===
The origins of painting in Japan date well back into [[Japanese Paleolithic|Japan's prehistoric period]]. Simple figural representations, as well as botanical, architectural, and geometric designs are found on [[Jōmon period]] pottery and [[Yayoi period]] (300 BC – 300 AD) ''[[dōtaku]]'' bronze bells. [[Mural]] paintings with both geometric and figural designs have been found in numerous [[tumulus|tumuli]] dating to the [[Kofun period]] and [[Asuka period]] (300–700 AD).

Along with the introduction of the Chinese writing system (''[[kanji]]''), Chinese modes of governmental administration, and [[Buddhism]] in the [[Asuka period]], many art works were imported into Japan from [[China]] and local copies in similar styles began to be produced.

===Nara period (710–794)===
[[File:Takamatsuzuka tomb mural.jpg|thumb|Mural painting from the [[Takamatsuzuka Tomb]]]]

With the further establishment of [[Buddhism]] in 6th- and 7th-century Japan, religious painting flourished and was used to adorn numerous temples erected by the aristocracy. However, [[Nara period|Nara-period]] Japan is recognized more for important contributions in the art of [[Japanese sculpture|sculpture]] than painting.

The earliest surviving paintings from this period include the [[mural]]s on the interior walls of the {{nihongo|Kondō|金堂}} at the temple [[Hōryū-ji]] in [[Ikaruga, Nara|Ikaruga, Nara Prefecture]]. These mural paintings, as well as painted images on the important [[Tamamushi Shrine]] include narratives such as ''[[jataka]]'', episodes from the life of [[Gautama Buddha|the historical Buddha, Shakyamuni]], in addition to iconic images of buddhas, [[bodhisattvas]], and various minor deities. The style is reminiscent of [[Chinese painting]] from the [[Sui dynasty]] or the late [[Sixteen Kingdoms]] period. However, by the mid-Nara period, paintings in the style of the [[Tang dynasty]] became very popular. These also include the wall murals in the [[Takamatsuzuka Tomb]], dating from around 700 AD. This style evolved into the ([[Kara-e]]) genre, which remained popular through the early [[Heian period]].

As most of the paintings in the Nara period are religious in nature, the vast majority are by anonymous artists. A large collection of Nara period art, Japanese as well as from the Chinese [[Tang dynasty]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shosoin.kunaicho.go.jp/shosoinPublic/doc/about_treasure.html |title=The Imperial Household Agency "About the Shosoin" |publisher=Shosoin.kunaicho.go.jp |date= |accessdate=2013-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523145410/http://shosoin.kunaicho.go.jp/shosoinPublic/doc/about_treasure.html |archivedate=2013-05-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is preserved at the [[Shōsō-in]], an 8th-century repository formerly owned by [[Tōdai-ji]] and currently administered by the [[Imperial Household Agency]].

===Heian period (794–1185)===
With the development of the Esoteric [[Japanese Buddhism|Buddhist]] sects of [[Shingon]] and [[Tendai]], painting of the 8th and 9th centuries is characterized by religious imagery, most notably painted {{nihongo|[[Mandala]]|曼荼羅|mandara}}. Numerous versions of mandala, most famously the ''[[Diamond Realm]] Mandala'' and ''[[Womb Realm]] Mandala'' at Tōji in Kyoto, were created as [[hanging scrolls]], and also as [[mural]]s on the walls of temples. A noted early example is at the five-story [[pagoda]] of [[Daigo-ji]], a temple south of [[Kyoto]].

With the rising importance of [[Pure Land]] sects of [[Japanese Buddhism]] in the 10th century, new image-types were developed to satisfy the devotional needs of these sects. These include {{nihongo|[[raigō]]zu|来迎図}}, which depict [[Amitābha|Amida]] Buddha along with attendant bodhisattvas Kannon and Seishi arriving to welcome the souls of the faithful departed to Amida's Western Paradise. A noted early example dating from 1053 are painted on the interior of the Phoenix Hall of the [[Byōdō-in]], a temple in [[Uji, Kyoto]]. This is also considered an early example of so-called {{nihongo|[[Yamato-e]]|大和絵|extra= "Japanese-style painting"}}, insofar as it includes landscape elements such as soft rolling hills that seem to reflect something of the actual appearance of the landscape of western Japan. Stylistically, however, this type of painting continues to be informed by Tang Dynasty Chinese "blue and green style" landscape painting traditions. ''Yamato-e'' is an imprecise term that continues to be debated among historians of Japanese art.

[[File:Genji emaki azumaya.jpg|thumb|Panel from ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' handscroll (detail)]]
[[File:Heiji no ran.jpg|thumb|[[Siege of Sanjō Palace]]]]
The mid-Heian period is seen as the golden age of ''Yamato-e,'' which were initially used primarily for sliding doors (''[[fusuma]]'') and folding screens (''[[byōbu]]''). However, new painting formats also came to the fore, especially towards the end of the Heian period, including ''[[emakimono]]'', or long illustrated handscrolls. Varieties of ''emakimono'' encompass illustrated novels, such as the '' [[Genji Monogatari]] '', historical works, such as the '' [[Ban Dainagon Ekotoba]] '', and religious works. In some cases, ''emaki'' artists employed pictorial narrative conventions that had been used in Buddhist art since ancient times, while at other times they devised new narrative modes that are believed to convey visually the emotional content of the underlying narrative. ''Genji Monogatari'' is organized into discreet episodes, whereas the more lively ''[[Ban Dainagon Ekotoba]]'' uses a continuous narrative mode in order to emphasize the narrative's forward motion. These two ''emaki'' differ stylistically as well, with the rapid brush strokes and light coloring of ''Ban Dainagon'' contrasting starkly to the abstracted forms and vibrant mineral pigments of the ''Genji'' scrolls. The '' [[Siege of Sanjō Palace|Siege of the Sanjō Palace]] '' is another famous example of this type of painting.

''E-maki'' also serve as some of the earliest and greatest examples of the ''[[onna-e]]'' ("women's pictures") and ''[[otoko-e]]'' ("men's pictures") and  styles of painting. There are many fine differences in the two styles. Although the terms seem to suggest the aesthetic preferences of each gender, historians of Japanese art have long debated the actual meaning of these terms, and they remain unclear. Perhaps most easily noticeable are the differences in subject matter. ''Onna-e'', epitomized by the ''Tale of Genji'' handscroll, typically deals with court life and courtly romance while ''otoko-e'', often deal with historical or semi-legendary events, particularly battles.

===Kamakura period (1185–1333)===
These genres continued on through [[Kamakura period]] Japan. ''E-maki'' of various kinds continued to be produced; however, the Kamakura period was much more strongly characterized by the art of [[Japanese sculpture|sculpture]], rather than painting.

As most of the paintings in the Heian and Kamakura periods are religious in nature, the vast majority are by anonymous artists.

===Muromachi period (1333–1573)===
[[File:Hasegawa Tohaku - Pine Trees (Shōrin-zu byōbu) - right hand screen.jpg|thumb|Right panel of the {{nihongo|''Pine Trees screen''|[[Shōrin-zu byōbu]]|松林図 屏風}} by [[Hasegawa Tōhaku]], c. 1595]]
[[File:SesshuShuutouTou.jpg|thumb|Landscape by [[Sesshū Tōyō]]]]

During the 14th century, the development of the great [[Zen]] monasteries in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]] and [[Kyoto]] had a major impact on the visual arts. ''[[Suibokuga]],'' an austere monochrome style of ink painting introduced from the [[Song Dynasty|Song]] and [[Yuan dynasty]] China largely replaced the polychrome scroll paintings of the previous period, although some polychrome portraiture remained – primary in the form of ''chinso'' paintings of Zen monks. Typical of such painting is the depiction by the priest-painter [[Kaō (painter)|Kaō]] of the legendary monk Kensu (Hsien-tzu in Chinese) at the moment he achieved enlightenment. This type of painting was executed with quick brush strokes and a minimum of detail.

''Catching a Catfish with a Gourd'' (located at [[Taizō-in]], [[Myōshin-ji]], Kyoto), by the priest-painter [[Josetsu]], marks a turning point in Muromachi painting. In the foreground a man is depicted on the bank of a stream holding a small gourd and looking at a large slithery catfish. Mist fills the middle ground, and the background, mountains appear to be far in the distance. It is generally assumed that the "new style" of the painting, executed about 1413, refers to a more Chinese sense of deep space within the picture plane.

By the end of the 14th century, monochrome [[landscape painting]]s (山水画 ''[[Shan shui|sansuiga]]'') had found patronage by the ruling [[Ashikaga clan|Ashikaga]] family and was the preferred genre among Zen painters, gradually evolving from its Chinese roots to a more Japanese style. A further development of landscape painting was the poem picture scroll, known as [[shigajiku]].

The foremost artists of the [[Muromachi period]] are the priest-painters [[Tenshō Shūbun|Shūbun]] and [[Sesshū Tōyō|Sesshū]]. Shūbun, a monk at the Kyoto temple of [[Shōkoku-ji]], created in the painting ''[[:File:Shubun - Reading in a Bamboo Grove detail.jpg|Reading in a Bamboo Grove]]'' (1446) a realistic landscape with deep recession into space. Sesshū, unlike most artists of the period, was able to journey to China and study Chinese painting at its source. ''Landscape of the Four Seasons'' (''Sansui Chokan''; c. 1486) is one of Sesshu's most accomplished works, depicting a continuing landscape through the four seasons.

In the late Muromachi period, ink painting had migrated out of the Zen monasteries into the art world in general, as artists from the [[Kanō school]] and the [[Ami school]] ([[:ja:阿弥派]]) adopted the style and themes, but introducing a more plastic and decorative effect that would continue into modern times.

Important artists in the Muromachi period Japan include:
* [[Mokkei]] (c. 1250)
* [[Mokuan Reien]] (died 1345)
* [[Kaō (painter)|Kaō Ninga]] (e.14th century)
* [[Mincho (artist)|Mincho]] (1352–1431)
* [[Josetsu]] (1405–1423)
* [[Tenshō Shūbun]] (died 1460)
* [[Sesshū Tōyō]] (1420–1506)
* [[Kanō Masanobu]] (1434–1530)
* [[Kanō Motonobu]] (1476–1559)

===Azuchi–Momoyama period (1573–{{not a typo|1615}})===&lt;!-- in politics, Azuchi–Momoyama ends in 1603, but in art it ends in 1615 --&gt;
[[File:Namban-11.jpg|thumb|Screen detail depicting arrival of a Western ship, attributed to [[Kanō Naizen]] (1570–1616)]]
In sharp contrast to the previous Muromachi period, the [[Azuchi–Momoyama period]] was characterized by a grandiose polychrome style, with extensive use of [[gold]] and [[silver]] foil, and by works on a very large scale. The [[Kanō school]], patronized by [[Oda Nobunaga]], [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], and their followers, gained tremendously in size and prestige. [[Kanō Eitoku]] developed a formula for the creation of monumental landscapes on the sliding doors enclosing a room. These huge screens and wall paintings were commissioned to decorate the castles and palaces of the military nobility. This status continued into the subsequent Edo period, as the [[Tokugawa bakufu]] continued to promote the works of the Kanō school as the officially sanctioned art for the ''[[shōgun]]'', ''[[daimyō]]s'', and [[Imperial House of Japan|Imperial court]].

However, non-Kano school artists and currents existed and developed during the Azuchi–Momoyama period as well, adapting Chinese themes to Japanese materials and [[aesthetics]]. One important group was the [[Tosa school]], which developed primarily out of the ''yamato-e'' tradition, and which was known mostly for small scale works and illustrations of literary classics in book or ''emaki'' format.

Important artists in the Azuchi-Momoyama period include:
* [[Kanō Eitoku]] (1543–1590)
* [[Kanō Sanraku]] (1559–1663)
* [[Kanō Tan'yū]] (1602–1674)
* [[Hasegawa Tōhaku]] (1539–1610)
* [[Kaihō Yūshō]] (1533–1615)

===[[Edo period]] (1603–1868)===
[[File:Bodhidarma.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Scroll calligraphy of [[Bodhidharma]]&lt;!-- "Zen points directly to the human heart, see into your nature and become Buddha",--&gt; by Hakuin Ekaku (1685 to 1768)]]

Many art historians show the Edo period as a continuation of the Azuchi-Momoyama period. Certainly, during the early Edo period, many of the previous trends in painting continued to be popular; however, a number of new trends also emerged.

One very significant school which arose in the early Edo period was the [[Rinpa school]], which used classical themes, but presented them in a bold, and lavishly decorative format. Sōtatsu in particular evolved a decorative style by re-creating themes from classical literature, using brilliantly colored figures and motifs from the natural world set against gold-leaf backgrounds. A century later, Korin reworked Sōtatsu's style and created visually gorgeous works uniquely his own.

Another important genre which began during Azuchi–Momoyama period, but which reached its full development during the early Edo period was ''[[Namban]]'' art, both in the depiction of exotic foreigners and in the use of the exotic foreigner style in painting. This genre was centered around the port of [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], which after the start of the [[sakoku|national seclusion policy]] of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] was the only Japanese port left open to foreign trade, and was thus the conduit by which Chinese and European artistic influences came to Japan. Paintings in this genre include [[Nanpin school|Nagasaki school]] paintings, and also the [[Shijō school|Maruyama-Shijo school]], which combine Chinese and Western influences with traditional Japanese elements.

A third important trend in the Edo period was the rise of the ''Bunjinga'' (literati painting) genre, also known as the [[Nanga (Japanese painting)|Nanga school]] (Southern Painting school). This genre started as an imitation of the works of Chinese scholar-amateur painters of the [[Yuan dynasty]], whose works and techniques came to Japan in the mid-18th century. Master Kuwayama Gyokushū was the greatest supporter of creating the ''bunjin'' style. He theorised that polychromatic landscapes were to be considered at the same level of monochromatic paintings by Chinese literati. Furthermore, he included some Japanese traditionalist artists, such as [[Tawaraya Sōtatsu]] and [[Ogata Kōrin]] of the Rinpa group, among major Nanga representatives.&lt;ref&gt;Marco, Meccarelli. 2015.  [https://www.academia.edu/20410225/Chinese_Painters_in_Nagasaki_Style_and_Artistic_Contaminatio_during_the_Tokugawa_Period_1603-1868_ "Chinese Painters in Nagasaki: Style and Artistic Contaminatio during the Tokugawa Period (1603–1868)"] Ming Qing Studies 2015, Pages 175–236.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later ''bunjinga'' artists considerably modified both the techniques and the subject matter of this genre to create a blending of Japanese and Chinese styles. The exemplars of this style are [[Ike no Taiga]], [[Uragami Gyokudō]], [[Yosa Buson]], [[Tanomura Chikuden]], [[Tani Bunchō]], and [[Yamamoto Baiitsu]].

Due to the Tokugawa shogunate's policies of fiscal and social austerity, the luxurious modes of these genre and styles were largely limited to the upper strata of society, and were unavailable, if not actually forbidden to the lower classes. The common people developed a separate type of art, the ''[[fūzokuga]],'' (風俗画, [[Genre art]]) in which painting depicting scenes from common, everyday life, especially that of the common people, ''[[kabuki]]'' theatre, prostitutes and landscapes were popular. These paintings in the 16th century gave rise to the paintings and woodcut prints of [[ukiyo-e]].

Important artists in the Edo period include:
* [[Tawaraya Sōtatsu]] (died 1643)
* [[Tosa Mitsuoki]] (1617–1691)
* [[Ogata Kōrin]] (1658–1716)
* [[Gion Nankai]] (1677–1751)
* [[Sakaki Hyakusen]] (1697–1752)
* [[Yanagisawa Kien]] (1704–1758)
* [[Yosa Buson]] (1716–1783)
* [[Itō Jakuchū]] (1716–1800)
* [[Ike no Taiga]] (1723–1776)
* [[Suzuki Harunobu]] (c. 1725–1770)
* [[Soga Shōhaku]] (1730–1781)
* [[Maruyama Ōkyo]] (1733–1795)

* [[Okada Hankō]] (1782–1846)
* [[Yamamoto Baiitsu]] (1783–1856)
* [[Watanabe Kazan]] (1793–1841)
* [[Utagawa Hiroshige]] (1797–1858)
* [[Shibata Zeshin]] (1807–1891)
* [[Tomioka Tessai]] (1836–1924)

===[[Empire of Japan|Prewar period]] (1868–1945)===
[[File:Kuroda-seiki-kohan00-6-1b.jpeg|thumb|[[Kuroda Seiki]], ''Lakeside'', 1897, oil on canvas, [[Kuroda Memorial Hall]], [[Tokyo]]]]
[[File:Yoritomo in a cave.jpg|thumb|''Yoritomo in a Cave'' by [[Maeda Seison]]]]

The prewar period was marked by the division of art into competing European styles and traditional indigenous styles.

During the [[Meiji period]], Japan underwent a tremendous political and social change in the course of the [[Europeanization]] and modernization campaign organized by the [[Meiji government]]. Western-style painting (''[[yōga]]'') was officially promoted by the government, who sent promising young artists abroad for studies, and who hired [[o-yatoi gaikokujin|foreign artists]] to come to Japan to establish an art curriculum at Japanese schools.

However, after an initial burst of enthusiasm for western style art, the pendulum swung in the opposite direction, and led by [[art critic]] [[Okakura Kakuzō]] and educator [[Ernest Fenollosa]], there was a revival of appreciation for traditional Japanese styles ([[Nihonga]]). In the 1880s, western style art was banned from official exhibitions and was severely criticized by critics. Supported by Okakura and Fenollosa, the ''Nihonga'' style evolved with influences from the European [[pre-Raphaelite]] movement and European [[romanticism]].

The Yōga style painters formed the ''Meiji Bijutsukai'' (Meiji Fine Arts Society) to hold its own exhibitions and to promote a renewed interest in western art.

In 1907, with the establishment of the'' [[Bunten]]'' under the aegis of the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|Ministry of Education]], both competing groups found mutual recognition and co-existence, and even began the process towards mutual synthesis.

The [[Taishō period]] saw the predominance of ''Yōga'' over ''Nihonga''. After long stays in Europe, many artists (including Arishima Ikuma) returned to Japan under the reign of Yoshihito, bringing with them the techniques of [[impressionism]] and early [[Post-Impressionism]]. The works of [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Paul Cézanne]] and [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] influenced early Taishō period paintings. However, ''yōga'' artists in the Taishō period also tended towards [[eclecticism]], and there was a profusion of dissident artistic movements. These included the Fusain Society (''Fyuzankai'') which emphasized styles of post-impressionism, especially [[fauvism]]. In 1914, the ''Nikakai'' (Second Division Society) emerged to oppose the government-sponsored Bunten Exhibition.

Japanese painting during the Taishō period was only mildly influenced by other contemporary European movements, such as [[neoclassicism]] and late post-impressionism.

However, it was resurgent ''Nihonga'', towards mid-1920s, which adopted certain trends from post-impressionism. The second generation of ''Nihonga'' artists formed the [[Japan Fine Arts Academy]] (''Nihon Bijutsuin'') to compete against the government-sponsored ''Bunten'', and although ''yamato-e'' traditions remained strong, the increasing use of western [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]], and western concepts of space and light began to blur the distinction between ''Nihonga'' and ''yōga''.

Japanese painting in the prewar [[Shōwa period]] was largely dominated by [[Sōtarō Yasui]] and [[Ryūzaburō Umehara]], who introduced the concepts of [[pure art]] and [[abstract painting]] to the ''Nihonga'' tradition, and thus created a more interpretative version of that genre. This trend was further developed by Leonard Foujita and the Nika Society, to encompass [[surrealism]]. To promote these trends, the Independent Art Association (''Dokuritsu Bijutsu Kyokai'') was formed in 1931.

During the [[World War II]], government controls and [[censorship]] meant that only patriotic themes could be expressed. Many artists were recruited into the government [[propaganda]] effort, and critical non-emotional review of their works is only just beginning.

Important artists in the prewar period include:
* [[Harada Naojirō]] (1863–1899)
* [[Yamamoto Hōsui]] (1850–1906)
* [[Asai Chū]] (1856–1907)

* [[Okada Saburōsuke]] (1869–1939)
* [[Sakamoto Hanjirō]] (1882–1962)
* [[Aoki Shigeru]] (1882–1911)
* [[Fujishima Takeji]] (1867–1943)
* [[Yokoyama Taikan]] 1868-1958
* [[Hishida Shunsō]] 1874-1911

* [[Imamura Shiro]] (1880–1916)
* [[Tomita Keisen]] (1879–1936)
* [[Koide Narashige]] (1887–1931)
* [[Kishida Ryūsei]] (1891–1929)
* [[Tetsugorō Yorozu]] (1885–1927)
* [[Hayami Gyoshū]] (1894–1935)
* [[Kawabata Ryushi|Kawabata Ryūshi]] (1885–1966)

* [[Ryūzaburō Umehara]] (1888–1986)
* [[Yasuda Yukihiko]] (1884–1978)
* [[Kobayashi Kokei]] (1883–1957)
* [[Tsuguharu Foujita|Leonard Foujita]] (1886–1968)
* [[Yuzō Saeki]] (1898–1928)
* [[Itō Shinsui]] (1898–1972)
* [[Kaburaki Kiyokata]] (1878–1972)
* [[Takehisa Yumeji]] (1884–1934)

===Postwar period (1945–present)===
In the postwar period, the government-sponsored [[Japan Art Academy]] (''Nihon Geijutsuin'') was formed in 1947, containing both ''nihonga'' and ''yōga'' divisions. Government sponsorship of art exhibitions has ended, but has been replaced by private exhibitions, such as the ''Nitten'', on an even larger scale. Although the ''Nitten'' was initially the exhibition of the Japan Art Academy, since 1958 it has been run by a separate private corporation. Participation in the ''Nitten'' has become almost a prerequisite for nomination to the Japan Art Academy, which in itself is almost an unofficial prerequisite for nomination to the [[Order of Culture]].

The arts of the [[Edo period|Edo]] and [[Empire of Japan|prewar]] periods (1603–1945) was supported by [[merchant]]s and urban people. Counter to the Edo and prewar periods, arts of the postwar period became popular. After [[World War II]], painters, [[calligraphy|calligraphers]], and [[printmaker]]s flourished in the big cities, particularly [[Tokyo]], and became preoccupied with the mechanisms of urban life, reflected in the flickering lights, [[neon]] colors, and frenetic pace of their abstractions. All the "isms" of the New York-Paris art world were fervently embraced. After the abstractions of the 1960s, the 1970s saw a return to realism strongly flavored by the "op" and "pop" art movements, embodied in the 1980s in the explosive works of [[Ushio Shinohara]]. Many such outstanding avant-garde artists worked both in Japan and abroad, winning international prizes. These artists felt that there was "nothing Japanese" about their works, and indeed they belonged to the international school. By the late 1970s, the search for Japanese qualities and a national style caused many artists to reevaluate their artistic ideology and turn away from what some felt were the empty formulas of the West. Contemporary paintings within the modern idiom began to make conscious use of traditional Japanese art forms, devices, and ideologies. A number of ''[[mono-ha]]'' artists turned to painting to recapture traditional nuances in spatial arrangements, color harmonies, and lyricism.

Japanese-style or ''[[nihonga]]'' painting continues in a prewar fashion, updating traditional expressions while retaining their intrinsic character. Some artists within this style still paint on [[silk]] or paper with traditional colors and ink, while others used new materials, such as [[Acrylic paint|acrylics]].

Many of the older schools of art, most notably those of the Edo and prewar periods, were still practiced. For example, the decorative naturalism of the ''rimpa'' school, characterized by brilliant, pure colors and bleeding washes, was reflected in the work of many artists of the postwar period in the 1980s art of [[Hikosaka Naoyoshi]]. The realism of [[Maruyama Ōkyo]]'s [[Maruyama school|school]] and the calligraphic and spontaneous Japanese style of the gentlemen-scholars were both widely practiced in the 1980s. Sometimes all of these schools, as well as older ones, such as the [[Kanō school]] ink traditions, were drawn on by contemporary artists in the Japanese style and in the modern idiom. Many Japanese-style painters were honored with awards and prizes as a result of renewed popular demand for Japanese-style art beginning in the 1970s. More and more, the international modern painters also drew on the Japanese schools as they turned away from Western styles in the 1980s. The tendency had been to synthesize East and West. Some artists had already leapt the gap between the two, as did the outstanding painter [[Shinoda Toko]]. Her bold sumi ink abstractions were inspired by traditional calligraphy but realized as lyrical expressions of modern abstraction.

There are also a number of contemporary painters in Japan whose work is largely inspired by [[anime]] sub-cultures and other aspects of popular and youth culture. [[Takashi Murakami]] is perhaps among the most famous and popular of these, along with and the other artists in his [[Kaikai Kiki]] studio collective. His work centers on expressing issues and concerns of postwar Japanese society through what are usually seemingly innocuous forms. He draws heavily from anime and related styles, but produces paintings and sculptures in media more traditionally associated with fine arts, intentionally blurring the lines between commercial and popular art and fine arts.

Important artists in the postwar period include:
* [[Ogura Yuki]] (1895–2000)
* [[Uemura Shōko]] (1902–2001)
* [[Ryōhei Koiso|Koiso Ryōhei]] (1903–1988)
* [[Kaii Higashiyama]] (1908–1999)

'''''Trial by Jury''''', or '''''Laying Down the Law''''' as it is commonly known, is an oil-on-canvas painting from [[1840 in art|1840]] by the English painter [[Sir Edwin Landseer]], which satirises the legal profession. It depicts dogs in the roles of members of the court with a [[poodle|French poodle]] centre stage as the judge. The painting was inspired by a chance comment by a judge, while at dinner with Landseer, that the French poodle belonging to amateur artist and renowned socialite, the [[Alfred Guillaume Gabriel, Count D'Orsay|Count d'Orsay]], "would make a capital Lord Chancellor".

Landseer was a member of the [[Royal Academy]] and had become famous for his paintings and drawings of animals. His later works include ''[[Monarch of the Glen (painting)|The Monarch of the Glen]]'', an iconic and much-reproduced painting of a stag in the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]], and the sculptures of the lions at the foot of [[Nelson's Column]] in [[Trafalgar Square]], [[London]].

He completed ''Trial by Jury'' in 1840 — it was exhibited at the Royal Academy in the same year and was acquired by [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire]], who had Landseer add his [[spaniel|Blenheim spaniel]], Bony, into the scene behind the [[greyhound]]. Early copies of the painting can be seen with Bony absent. The original now hangs in the Sculpture Gallery at [[Chatsworth House]]. The poodle has been variously identified as representing [[Lord Brougham]], who had been [[Lord Chancellor]] from 1830 to 1834, or [[Lord Lyndhurst]], who had held the post three times (1827&amp;ndash;1830, 1834&amp;ndash;1835, and 1841&amp;ndash;1846).

American [[hip hop]] group [[Beastie Boys]] recorded many songs during their career. Between 1982 and 2012, the group [[Beastie Boys discography|released]] eight [[studio album]]s, four [[compilation album]]s, seven [[extended play]]s, and forty [[Single (music)|singles]]. Beginning in 1981 as a four-piece [[hardcore punk]] group, Beastie Boys consisted of [[Mike D|Michael "Mike D" Diamond]], [[Adam Yauch|Adam "MCA" Yauch]], [[Kate Schellenbach]], and John Berry.{{sfn|Zwickel|2011|p=14}} In 1982, after the release of the EP, ''[[Polly Wog Stew]]'', Berry left the group and was replaced by [[Ad-Rock|Adam "Ad-Rock" Horovitz]].{{sfn|Zwickel|2011|pp=15, 16}} A year later, the group released their debut single, "[[Cooky Puss]]", which marked a change in style to a more [[hip-hop]] oriented sound.&lt;ref name="nymag"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barshad |first1=Amos |title=Rude Boys |url=http://nymag.com/arts/popmusic/features/beastie-boys-2011-5/ |website=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |accessdate=October 22, 2017 |pages=2 |date=April 24, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301015036/http://nymag.com/arts/popmusic/features/beastie-boys-2011-5/ |archivedate=March 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The single garnered the attention of New York University student [[Rick Rubin]], who, in 1984, would form [[Def Jam Recordings]] with [[Russell Simmons]] and ask Beastie Boys to join his label.{{sfn|Zwickel|2011|pp=18, 19}} Afterwards, Schellenbach left the group and the remaining three, Ad-Rock, Mike D, and MCA, decided to focus their attention on [[Rapping|rap]].{{sfn|Zwickel|2011|pp=18, 19}}

With Rubin's assistance on writing and producing, Beastie Boys released the singles "[[Rock Hard]]" in 1984 and "[[She's on It]]" in 1985, before releasing their debut studio album, ''[[Licensed to Ill]]'', in November 1986.&lt;ref name="allmusic bio"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Erlewine|first1=Stephen Thomas|authorlink1=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=Beastie Boys – Biography|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/beastie-boys-mn0000038469/biography|website=''[[AllMusic]]''|accessdate=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was a huge commercial success, and received critical acclaim.&lt;ref name="rs bio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Beastie Boys Bio|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/beastie-boys/biography|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Erlewine|first1=Stephen Thomas|authorlink1=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=''Licensed to Ill'' – Beastie Boys|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/licensed-to-ill-mw0000649870|website=''[[AllMusic]]''|accessdate=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to financial disagreements, Beastie Boys broke away from Def Jam and signed with [[Capitol Records]] in California.

The '''music industry''' consists of the companies and individuals that earn money by [[musical composition|creating]] new [[song]]s and pieces and selling live concerts and shows, audio and video recordings, compositions and [[sheet music]], and the organizations and associations that aid and represent [[music]] creators. Among the many individuals and organizations that operate in the industry are: the [[songwriter]]s and [[composer]]s who create new songs and musical pieces; the [[singer]]s, [[musician]]s, [[conducting|conductors]] and [[bandleader]]s who perform the music; the companies and professionals who create and sell [[sound recording|recorded music]] and/or [[sheet music]] (e.g., [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publishers]], [[Record producer|music producers]], [[recording studios]], [[Audio engineering|engineers]], [[record label]]s, retail and [[online music store]]s, [[performance rights organization]]s); and those that help organize and present [[live music]] performances ([[sound engineer]]s, [[talent agent|booking agents]], [[Promoter (entertainment)|promoters]], [[music venue]]s, [[road crew]]).

The industry also includes a range of professionals who assist singers and musicians with their music careers ([[talent manager]]s, [[artists and repertoire]] managers, [[business manager]]s, [[entertainment law]]yers); those who broadcast audio or video music content ([[satellite radio|satellite]], [[internet radio|Internet radio stations]], [[radio broadcasting|broadcast radio]] and [[television broadcasting|TV stations]]); [[music journalist]]s and [[music critic]]s; [[DJ]]s; [[music education|music educators and teachers]]; [[musical instrument]] manufacturers; as well as many others. In addition to the businesses and artists who work in the music industry to make a profit or income, there is a range of organizations that also play an important role in the music industry, including musician's unions (e.g., [[American Federation of Musicians]]), not-for-profit performance-rights organizations (e.g., [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]]) and other associations (e.g., [[International Alliance for Women in Music]], a non-profit organization that advocates for [[Women in music|women composers and musicians]]).

The modern Western music industry emerged between the 1930s and 1950s, when [[Gramophone record|records]] replaced [[sheet music]] as the most important product in the music business. In the commercial world, "the recording industry"—a reference to [[sound recording|recording performances of songs and pieces]] and selling the recordings–began to be used as a loose synonym for "the music industry". In the 2000s, a majority of the music market is controlled by three major corporate labels: the French-owned [[Universal Music Group]], the Japanese-owned [[Sony Music Entertainment]],&lt;ref name="sonybmg"&gt;Sony Corporation announced October 1, 2008 that it had completed the acquisition of Bertelsmann's 50% stake in Sony BMG, which was originally announced on August 5, 2008.

Labels outside of these three major labels are referred to as [[independent label]]s (or "indies"). The largest portion of the live music market for concerts and tours is controlled by [[Live Nation]], the largest promoter and [[music venue]] owner. [[Live Nation]] is a former subsidiary of [[iHeartMedia|iHeartMedia Inc]], which is the largest owner of radio stations in the [[United States]].

In the first decades of the 2000s, the music industry underwent drastic changes with the advent of widespread digital distribution of music via the [[Internet]] (which includes both illegal [[file sharing]] of songs and legal music purchases in [[online music store]]s). A conspicuous indicator of these changes is total music sales: since 2000, sales of recorded music have dropped off substantially&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=The Music Industry | url=http://www.economist.com/background/displayBackground.cfm?story_id=10498664 | date=October 15, 2008 | work= The Economist

==History==

===Early history===

'''Printed music in Europe:'''
[[Image:CordierColor.jpg|thumb|260px|Prior to the invention of the [[printing press]], the only way to copy [[sheet music]] was by hand, a costly and time-consuming process. Pictured is the hand-written music manuscript for a French [[Ars subtilior]] chanson (song) from the late 1300s about love, entitled ''Belle, bonne, sage'', by Baude Cordier. The [[music notation]] is unusual in that it is written in a heart shape, with red notes indicating rhythmic [[#Notational characteristics|alterations]].]]
Music publishing using machine-printed [[sheet music]] developed during the [[Renaissance music]] era in the mid-15th century. The development of music publication followed the evolution of [[printing]] technologies that were first developed for printing regular [[book]]s. After the mid-15th century,  mechanical techniques for printing sheet music were first developed. The earliest example, a set of liturgical chants, dates from about 1465, shortly after the [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg Bible]] was printed. Prior to this time, music had to be copied out by hand. To copy music notation by hand was a very costly, labor-intensive and time-consuming process, so it was usually undertaken only by monks and priests seeking to preserve sacred music for the church. The few collections of secular (non-religious) music that are extant were commissioned and owned by wealthy aristocrats. Examples include the [[Squarcialupi Codex]] of Italian [[Trecento]] music and the [[Chantilly Codex]] of French [[Ars subtilior]] music.

The use of printing enabled sheet music to reproduced much more quickly and at a much lower cost than hand-copying music notation. This helped musical styles to spread to other cities and countries more quickly, and it also enabled music to be spread to more distant areas. Prior to the invention of music printing, a composer's music might only be known in the city she lived in and its surrounding towns, because only wealthy aristocrats would be able to afford to have hand copies made of her music. With music printing, though, a composer's music could be printed and sold at a relatively low cost to purchasers from a wide geographic area. As sheet music of major composer's pieces and songs began to be printed and distributed in a wider area, this enabled composers and listeners to hear new styles and forms of music. A German composer could buy songs written by an Italian or English composer, and an Italian composer could buy pieces written by Dutch composers and learn how they wrote music. This led to more blending of musical styles from different countries and regions.

The pioneer of modern music printing was [[Ottaviano Petrucci]]  (born in Fossombrone in 1466 – died in 1539 in Venice ), a printer and publisher who was able to secure a twenty-year monopoly on printed music in Venice during the 16th century. [[Venice]] was one of the major business and music centers during this period. His ''Harmonice Musices Odhecaton'', a collection of chansons printed in 1501, is commonly misidentified as the first book of sheet music printed from movable type. Actually that distinction belongs to the Roman printer Ulrich Han's ''Missale Romanum'' of 1476. Nevertheless, Petrucci's later work was extraordinary for the complexity of his white mensural notation and the smallness of his font. He printed the first book of [[polyphony]] (music with two or more independent melodic lines) using movable type. He also published numerous works by the most highly regarded composers of the Renaissance, including [[Josquin des Prez]] and [[Antoine Brumel]]. He flourished by focusing on Flemish works, rather than Italian, as they were very popular throughout Europe during the [[Renaissance music]] era. His printing shop used the triple-impression method, in which a sheet of paper was pressed three times. The first impression was the staff lines, the second the words, and the third the notes. This method produced very clean and readable results, although it was time-consuming and expensive.

Until the 18th century, the processes of formal composition and of the printing of music took place for the most part with the support of [[patronage]] from [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracies]] and [[Religion|churches]]. In the mid-to-late 18th century, performers and composers such as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] began to seek more commercial opportunities to market their music and performances to the general public. After Mozart's death, his wife ([[Constanze Weber]]) continued the process of commercialization of his music through an unprecedented series of memorial concerts, selling his manuscripts, and collaborating with her second husband, [[Georg Nissen]], on a biography of Mozart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jane Glover |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/sep/02/classicalmusicandopera |title=Dear Constanze &amp;#124; Music |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:AmazingGraceFamiliarStyle.png|thumb|right|200px|An example of mechanically printed sheet music.]]

In the 19th century, [[sheet music|sheet-music]] publishers dominated the music industry. Prior to the invention of [[sound recording]] technologies, the main way for music lovers to hear new symphonies and [[opera]] arias (songs) was to buy the sheet music (often arranged for piano or for a small chamber music group) and perform the music in a living room, using friends who were amateur musicians and singers. In the United States, the music industry arose in tandem with the rise of "[[black face]]" [[minstrel show|minstrelsy]]. Blackface is a form of theatrical makeup used predominantly by non-black performers to represent a [[black people|black person]]. The practice gained popularity during the 19th century and contributed to the spread of negative [[racial stereotype]]s of African-American people.&lt;ref&gt;For the "darky"/"coon" distinction see, for example, note 34 on p. 167 of Edward Marx and Laura E. Franey's annotated edition of Yone Noguchi, ''The American Diary of a Japanese Girl'', Temple University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|1-59213-555-2}}. See also Lewis A. Erenberg (1984), ''Steppin' Out: New York Nightlife and the Transformation of American Culture, 1890–1930'', University of Chicago Press, p. 73, {{ISBN|0-226-21515-6}}. For more on the "darky" stereotype, see J. Ronald Green (2000), ''Straight Lick: The Cinema of Oscar Micheaux'', Indiana University Press, pp. 134, 206, {{ISBN|0-253-33753-4}}; p. 151 of the same work also alludes to the specific "coon" archetype.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late part of the century the group of music publishers and songwriters which dominated popular music in the United States became known as [[Tin Pan Alley]]. The name originally referred to a specific place: West 28th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenue in [[Manhattan]], and a plaque (see [[#plaque|below]]) on the sidewalk on 28th Street between Broadway and Sixth commemorates it. The start of Tin Pan Alley is usually dated to about 1885, when a number of music publishers set up shop in the same district of [[Manhattan]]. The end of Tin Pan Alley is less clear-cut. Some date it to the start of the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s when the [[phonograph]] and radio supplanted [[sheet music]] as the driving force of American popular music, while others consider Tin Pan Alley to have continued into the 1950s when earlier styles of American popular music were upstaged by the rise of [[rock &amp; roll]].

===Advent of recorded music and radio broadcasting===
[[File:Frances Densmore recording Mountain Chief2.jpg|thumb|right|130px|[[Frances Densmore]] recording [[Blackfoot]] chief Mountain Chief on a cylinder phonograph in 1916.]]
[[File:Donald Manson working as an employee of the Marconi Company.jpg|thumb|right|160px|A radio broadcasting system from 1906.]]
At the dawn of the early 20th century, the development of [[sound recording]] began to function as a [[disruptive technology]] to the commercial interests which published sheet music. During the sheet music era, if a regular person wanted to hear popular new songs, he or she would buy the sheet music and play it at home on a piano, or learn the song at home while playing the [[accompaniment]] part on piano or guitar. Commercially released [[phonograph]] records of musical performances, which became available starting in the late 1880s, and later the onset of widespread [[radio broadcasting]], starting in the 1920s, forever changed the way music was heard and listened to. Opera houses, concert halls, and clubs continued to produce music and musicians and singers continued to perform live, but the power of radio allowed bands, ensembles and singers who had previously performed only in one region to become popular on a nationwide and sometimes even a worldwide scale. Moreover, whereas attendance at the top symphony and opera concerts was formerly restricted to high-income people in a pre-radio world, with [[broadcast radio]], a much larger wider range of people, including lower and middle-income people could hear the best [[orchestra]]s, [[big band]]s, popular singers and opera shows.

The "record industry" eventually replaced the sheet music publishers as the music industry's largest force. A multitude of record labels came and went. Some noteworthy labels of the earlier decades include the [[Columbia Records]], Crystalate, [[Decca Records]], Edison Bell, [[The Gramophone Company]], Invicta, Kalliope, [[Pathé]], [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/band/vintage78rpm/great78/Early_Record_Labels.htm |title=Early Record Label History |publisher=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many record companies died out as quickly as they had formed, and by the end of the 1980s, the "Big six" — [[EMI]], [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS]], [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]], [[PolyGram]], [[Warner Music Group|WEA]] and [[MCA Records|MCA]] — dominated the industry. [[Sony]] bought CBS Records in 1987 and changed its name to Sony Music in 1991. In mid-1998, [[PolyGram|PolyGram Music Group]] merged with MCA Music Entertainment creating what we now know as [[Universal Music Group]]. Since then, Sony and BMG merged in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3908405.stm "Sony and BMG merger backed by EU"], BBC News, July 19, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and Universal took over the majority of EMI's recorded music interests in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Sweney [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/21/universal-emi-takeover-approved "Universal's £1.2bn EMI takeover approved – with conditions"], ''The Guardian'' (London),&lt;/ref&gt; [[EMI Music Publishing]], also once part of the now defunct British conglomerate, is now co-owned by Sony as a subsidiary of [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/emi-music-publishing-sold-sony-atv-estate-michael-jackson-343848 "Sold! EMI Music Publishing to Consortium Led by Sony/ATV, Michael Jackson Estate for $2.2 Billion"], ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', June 30, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Genre-wise, music entrepreneurs expanded their industry models into areas like [[folk music]], in which composition and performance had continued for centuries on an [[ad hoc]] self-supporting basis. Forming an [[independent record label]], or "indie" label, or signing to such a label continues to be a popular choice for up-and-coming musicians, especially in genres like [[hardcore punk]] and [[extreme metal]], despite the fact that indies cannot offer the same financial backing of major labels. Some bands prefer to sign with an indie label, because these labels typically give performers more artistic freedom.

===Rise of digital and online distribution===
{{Main article|2000s in the music industry|2010s in the music industry}}
[[File:Download on iTunes.svg|thumb|right|200px|The logo for [[Apple Inc.]]'s online [[iTunes store]], which sells digital files of songs and musical pieces–along with a range of other content, such as digital files of [[TV show]]s and [[movie]]s.]]

In the first decade of the 2000s, digitally downloaded and [[streaming media| streamed music]] became more popular than buying physical recordings (e.g. [[CD]]s, [[Gramophone record| records]] and [[Compact Cassette |tapes]]). This gave consumers almost "friction-less" access to a wider variety of music than ever before, across multiple devices. At the same time, consumers spent less money on recorded music (both physically and digitally distributed) than they had in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url= https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/05/the-freeloaders/8027/ | last= McCardle | first= Megan |date= May 2010 | title= The Freeloaders | magazine = The Atlantic | quote= industry revenues have been declining for the past 10 years | accessdate= December 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Total "music-business" revenues in the U.S. dropped by half, from a high of $14.6&amp;nbsp;billion in 1999 to $6.3&amp;nbsp;billion in 2009, according to [[Forrester Research]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;!--ILLEGAL FILESHARING ---&gt;
In response to the rise of widespread illegal [[file sharing]] of digital music-recordings, the record industry took aggressive legal action. In 2001 it succeeded in shutting down the popular music-website [[Napster]], and threatened legal action against thousands of individuals who participated in sharing music-song sound-files.&lt;ref name=Knopper2009/&gt; However, this failed to slow the decline in music-recording revenue and proved a [[public-relations]] disaster for the music industry.&lt;ref name=Knopper2009/&gt;  Some academic studies have even suggested that downloads did not cause the decline in sales of recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher= C Net | last= Borland | first= John | date= March 29, 2004 | title= Music sharing doesn't kill CD sales, study says | url= http://news.cnet.com/2100-1027_3-5181562.html | accessdate= July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008 British Music Rights survey&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Orlowski]]. ''[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/06/16/bmr_music_survey/ 80% want legal P2P - survey]''. [[The Register]], 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that 80% of people in Britain wanted a legal [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) file-sharing service, however only half of the respondents thought that the music's creators should be paid.  The survey was consistent with the results of earlier research conducted in the United States, upon which the [[Open Music Model]] was based.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shuman Ghosemajumder]]. ''[http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/8438 Advanced Peer-Based Technology Business Models]''. [[MIT Sloan School of Management]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--DIGITAL DISTRIBUTION--&gt;
Legal digital downloads became widely available with the debut of the Apple [[iTunes Store]] in 2003. The popularity of music distribution over the [[Internet]] has increased,{{cn|date=December 2018}} and by 2011 digital music sales topped physical sales of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://money.cnn.com/2012/01/05/technology/digital_music_sales/index.htm | work= CNN | title= Digital music sales top physical sales | date= January 5, 2012 | accessdate= April 24, 2012 | first= Laurie | last= Segall|authorlink= Laurie Segall | quote = According to a Nielsen and Billboard report, digital music purchases accounted for 50.3% of music sales in 2011.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Atlantic Records reports that digital sales have surpassed physical sales.&lt;ref name="NYT2008"/&gt;
However, as ''The Economist'' reported, "paid digital downloads grew rapidly, but did not begin to make up for the loss of revenue from CDs".&lt;ref name=Economist2008/&gt;

&lt;!--SUBSRCIPTION-BASED SERVICES--&gt;
After 2010, Internet-based services such as [[Deezer]], [[Pandora Radio| Pandora]], [[Spotify]], and [[iTunes Radio| Apple's iTunes Radio]] began to offer subscription-based "[[streaming media |pay to stream]]" services over the Internet. With streaming services, the user pays a subscription to a company for the right to listen to songs and other media from a library. Whereas with legal digital download services, the purchaser owns a digital copy of the song (which they can keep on their computer or on a digital media player), with streaming services, the user never downloads the song file or owns the song file. The subscriber can only listen to the song for as long as they continue to pay the streaming subscription. Once the user stops paying the subscription, they cannot listen to audio from the company's repositories anymore. Streaming services began to have a serious impact on the industry in 2014.&lt;!-- WILL ADD MORE SHORTLY WHEN I GET SOME REFERENCES --&gt;

[[Spotify]], together with the [[music streaming | music-streaming]] industry in general, faces some criticism from artists claiming they are not being fairly compensated for their work as downloaded-music sales decline and music-streaming increases. Unlike physical or download sales, which pay a fixed price per song or album, Spotify pays artists based on their "market share" (the number of streams for their songs as a proportion of total songs streamed on the service).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Marshall|first= Lee|date= 2015-07-03|title= 'Let's keep music special.

Spotify reports paying on average US$0.006 to US$0.008 per stream. In response to concerns, Spotify claims that they are benefiting the music business by migrating "them away from piracy and less monetised platforms and allowing them to generate far greater royalties than before" by encouraging users to use their paid service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.yahoo.com/music/bp/exclusive--taylor-swift-on-being-pop-s-instantly-platinum-wonder----and-why-she-s-paddling-against-the-streams-085041907.html|title= Exclusive: Taylor Swift on Being Pop's Instantly Platinum Wonder...

The [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) revealed in its 2015 earnings report that streaming services were responsible for 34.3 percent of the year's U.S. recorded-music-industry revenue, growing 29 percent from the previous year and becoming the largest source of income, pulling in around $2.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{cite web|title= News and Notes on 2015 RIAA Shipment and Revenue Statistics|url= https://www.riaa.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/RIAA-2015-Year-End-shipments-memo.pdf|publisher= RIAA|accessdate= December 1, 2018 | quote = Combining all categories of streaming music (subscription, ad-supported on-demand, and SoundExchange distributions), revenues grew 29% to $2.4 billion.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Streaming made more revenue for music industry in 2015 than digital downloads, physical sales|url= http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/23/streaming-made-more-revenue-for-music-industry-in-/|publisher= The Washington Times |accessdate= January 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; US streaming revenue grew 57 percent to $1.6 billion in the first half of 2016 and accounted for almost half of industry sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= Shaw|first1= Lucas|title= The Music Industry Is Finally Making Money on Streaming|url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-20/spotify-apple-drive-u-s-music-industry-s-8-first-half-growth|publisher= Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate= January 5, 2017|date= September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with  the $14.6 billion in revenue that was received in 1999 by the U.S. music industry from the sale of CDs.

&lt;!--CHANGING RELATIONSHIPS ---&gt;
The turmoil in the recorded-music industry in the 2000s altered the historically anomalous twentieth-century balance between artists, record companies, promoters, retail music-stores and consumers. {{As of | 2010}}, [[big-box store]]s such as [[Wal-Mart]] and [[Best Buy]] sell more records than music-only CD stores, which have ceased to function as a major player in the music industry. Music-performing artists now rely on [[concert|live performance]] and [[merchandise]] sales (T-shirts, sweatshirts, etc.) for the majority of their income, which in turn has made them more dependent - like pre-20th-century musicians - on patrons, now exemplified by music promoters such as [[Live Nation (events promoter) | Live Nation]] (which dominates tour promotion and owns or manages a large number of [[music venue]]s).&lt;ref name = "Live Nation"/&gt; In order to benefit from all of an artist's income streams, record companies increasingly rely on the "[[360 deal]]", a new business-relationship pioneered by [[Robbie Williams]] and EMI in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.cnet.com/Recording-industry-should-brace-for-more-bad-news/2010-1027_3-6226487.html|title= Perspective: Recording industry should brace for more bad news|last= Rosso|first= Wayne|publisher= [[CNET]]|date= January 16, 2009|accessdate= January 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the other extreme, record companies can offer a simple manufacturing- and [[distribution deal | distribution-deal]], which gives a higher percentage to the artist, but does not cover the expenses of marketing and promotion.

&lt;!--CHANGING RELATIONSHIPS p2 ---&gt;
Companies like [[Kickstarter]] help independent musicians produce their albums through [[crowdfunding|fans funding bands]] they want to listen to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thestreet.com/story/12096110/1/startups-not-apple-lead-music-industrys-rebirth.html |title= Startups, Not Apple, Lead Music Industry's Rebirth |website= Thestreet.com |date= |accessdate= November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many newer artists no longer see a [[record deal]] as an integral part of their [[business plan]] at all. Inexpensive recording-hardware and -software make it possible to record reasonable-quality music on a laptop in a bedroom and to distribute it over the Internet to a worldwide audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news  | url = https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2009-10-13-apogee-gio-music_N.htm  | title = Musicians ditch studios for tech such as GiO for Macs  | author= Jefferson Graham  | date = October 14, 2009  | newspaper= [[U.S.A.

&lt;/ref&gt;
Changes in the music industry have given consumers access to a wider variety of music than ever before, at a price that gradually approaches zero.&lt;ref name=Knopper2009/&gt; However, consumer spending on music-related software and hardware increased dramatically over the last decade, providing a valuable new income-stream for [[technology company | technology companies]] such as [[Apple Inc.]] and [[Pandora Radio]].

==Business structure==
The music industry is a complex system of many different organizations, firms and individuals. It has undergone dramatic changes in the first decades of the 21st century. However, the majority of the participants in the music industry still fulfill their traditional roles, which are described below.&lt;ref&gt;All of the information in this section can be found in:* {{Krasilovsky et al 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three types of [[property]] that are created and sold by the recording industry: [[musical composition|compositions]] (songs, pieces, lyrics), [[sound recording and reproduction|recordings]] (audio and video) and media (such as [[compact disc|CDs]] or [[MP3]]s, and [[DVD]]s). There may be many recordings of a single composition and a single recording will typically be distributed via many media. For example, the song "[[My Way]]" is owned by its composers, [[Paul Anka]] and [[Claude François]], [[Frank Sinatra]]'s recording of "My Way" is owned by [[Capitol Records]], [[Sid Vicious]]'s recording of "My Way" is owned by [[Virgin Records]], and the millions of CDs and vinyl records that can play these recordings are owned by millions of individual consumers.

===Compositions===

[[Song]]s, instrumental pieces and other musical compositions are created by [[songwriter]]s or [[composer]]s and are originally owned by the composer, although they may be sold or the rights may be otherwise assigned. For example, in the case of [[work for hire]], the composition is owned immediately by another party. Traditionally, the copyright owner [[licensed|licenses]] or "assigns" some of their rights to [[publishing companies]], by means of a [[publishing contract]]. The publishing company (or a collection society operating on behalf of many such publishers, songwriters and composers) collects fees (known as "[[Music royalties|publishing royalties]]") when the composition is used. A portion of the royalties are paid by the publishing company to the copyright owner, depending on the terms of the contract. [[Sheet music]] provides an income stream that is paid exclusively to the composers and their publishing company. Typically (although not universally), the publishing company will provide the owner with an [[advance payment|advance]] against future earnings when the publishing contract is signed. A publishing company will also promote the compositions, such as by acquiring song "placements" on [[television]] or in [[film]]s.

===Recordings===
[[File:Sound Gobo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A musician in a recording studio.]]
Recordings are created by [[recording artist]]s, which includes [[singer]]s, [[musician]]s (including [[session musician]]s) and [[musical ensemble]]s (e.g., [[backing band]]s, [[rhythm section]]s, [[orchestra]]s, etc.) usually with the assistance and guidance from [[record producer]]s and [[audio engineer]]s. They were traditionally made in [[recording studio]]s (which are rented for a daily or hourly rate) in a [[recording session]]. In the 21st century, advances in digital recording technology have allowed many producers and artists to create "[[home studio]]s" using high-end computers and digital recording programs like [[Protools]], bypassing the traditional role of the commercial recording studio. The [[record producer]] oversees all aspects of the recording, making many of the logistic, financial and artistic decisions in cooperation with the artists. The record producer has a range of different responsibilities including choosing material and/or working with the composers, hiring session musicians, helping to [[musical arrangement|arrange]] the songs, overseeing the musician performances, and directing the audio engineer during recording and mixing to get the best sound. [[Audio engineer]]s (including [[recording engineer|recording]], [[mixing engineer|mixing]] and [[mastering engineer]]s) are responsible for ensuring good audio quality during the recording. They select and set up microphones and use [[effects unit]]s and [[mixing console]]s to adjust the sound and level of the music.  A recording session may also require the services of an [[arranger]], [[orchestrator]], [[studio musician]]s, [[session musician]]s, [[vocal coach]]es, or even a discreetly-hired [[ghostwriter|ghostwriter to help with the lyrics or songwriting]].
[[File:Ben Feggans.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A studio engineer working with an [[audio mixer]] in a recording studio.]]

Recordings are (traditionally) owned by [[record companies]]. Some artists own their own record companies (e.g., [[Ani DiFranco]]). A [[recording contract]] specifies the business relationship between a recording artist and the record company. In a traditional contract, the company provides an advance to the artist who agrees to record music that will be owned by the company. The [[A&amp;R]] department of a record company is responsible for finding new talent and overseeing the recording process. The company pays for the recording costs and the cost of [[radio promotion|promoting]] and [[marketing]] the record. For physical media (such as [[compact disc|CDs]]), the company also pays to [[manufacture]] and [[distribution (business)|distribute]] the physical recordings. Smaller record companies (known as "[[independent record label|indies]]") will form business relationships with other companies to handle many of these tasks. The record company pays the recording artist a portion of the income from the sale of the recordings, also known as a "royalty", but this is distinct from the publishing royalties described above. This portion is similar to a percentage, but may be limited or expanded by a number of factors (such as free goods, recoupable expenses, bonuses, etc.) that are specified by the record contract. [[Session musician]]s and [[orchestra]] members (as well as a few recording artists in special markets) are under contract to provide [[work for hire]]; they are typically only paid one-time fees or regular wages for their services, rather than ongoing royalties.

===Media===

Physical media (such as CDs or vinyl records) are sold by music [[retail]]ers and are owned by the consumers after they buy them. Buyers do not typically have the right to make digital copies from CDs or other media they buy, or rent or lease the CDs, because they do not own the recording on the CD, they only own the individual physical CD. A music distributor delivers crates of the packaged physical media from the manufacturer to the retailer and maintains commercial relationships with retailers and record companies. The music retailer pays the distributor, who in turn pays the [[record company]] for the recordings. The record company pays [[Mechanical royalties#Mechanical royalties|mechanical royalties]] to the publisher and composer via a collection society. The record company then pays royalties, if contractually obligated, to the recording artist. In the case of digital downloads or online [[streaming media|streaming]] of music, there is no physical media other than the consumer's computer memory on his or her portable media player or laptop. For this reason, artists such as Taylor Swift, Paul McCartney, Kings of Leon, and others have called for legal changes that would deny social media the right to stream their music without paying them royalties.&lt;ref name="Knopper2009" /&gt; In the digital and online music market of the 2000s, the distributor becomes optional. Large online shops may pay the labels directly, but digital distributors do exist to provide distribution services for vendors large and small. When purchasing digital downloads or listening to music streaming, the consumer may be required to agree to record company and vendor licensing terms beyond those which are inherent in [[copyright]]; for example, some services may allow consumers to freely share the recording, but others may restrict the user to storing the music on a specific number of hard drives or devices.

===Broadcast, soundtrack and streaming===

When a recording is broadcast (either on radio or by a [[background music]] service such as [[Muzak Holdings|Muzak]]), [[performance rights organisation]]s (such as the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] and [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] in the US, SOCAN in Canada, or [[Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society|MCPS]] and [[PRS for Music|PRS]] in the UK), collect a third type of royalty known as a performance royalty, which is paid to songwriters, composers and recording artists. This royalty is typically much smaller than publishing or [[Mechanical royalties#Mechanical royalties|mechanical royalties]]. Within the past decade, more than "15 to 30 percent" of tracks on streaming services are unidentified with a specific artist. Jeff Price says "Audiam, an online music streaming service, has made over several hundred thousand dollars in the past year from collecting royalties from online streaming.&lt;ref name="billboard.com" /&gt; According to Ken Levitan, manager from Kings of Leon, Cheap Trick and others, "Youtube has become radio for kids". Because of the overuse of YouTube and offline streaming, album sales have fallen by 60 percent in the past few years.&lt;ref name="Knopper2009" /&gt; When recordings are used in [[television]] and [[film]], the composer and their publishing company are typically paid through a [[synchronization rights|synchronization license]]. In the 2000s, online subscription services (such as [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]]) also provide an income stream directly to record companies, and through them, to artists, contracts permitting.

===Live music===

[[File:Pro2Type - CSD Straßenfest Köln 2013-1759.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A live musical performance at [[Cologne Pride]], 2013.]]
A [[Promoter (entertainment)|promoter]] brings together a performing artist and a [[Music venue|venue]] owner and arranges contracts. A [[booking agency]] represents the artist to promoters, makes deals and books performances. Consumers usually buy tickets either from the venue or from a ticket distribution service such as [[Ticketmaster]]. In the US, [[Live Nation]] is the dominant company in all of these roles: they own most of the large venues in the US, they are the largest promoter, and they own [[Ticketmaster]]. Choices about where and when to tour are decided by the [[artist manager|artist's management]] and the artist, sometimes in consultation with the [[record company]]. Record companies may finance a tour in the hopes that it will help promote the sale of recordings. However, in the 21st century, it has become more common to release recordings to promote ticket sales for live shows, rather than book tours to promote the sales of recordings.

Major, successful artists will usually employ a [[road crew]]: a semi-permanent touring organization that travels with the artist during concert series. The road crew is headed by a [[tour manager]]. Crew members provides [[stage lighting]], [[Audio engineering|live sound reinforcement]], [[guitar technician|musical instrument tuning and maintenance]], [[bodyguard]] for the artist and transportation of the equipment and music ensemble members. On large tours, the road crew may also include an accountant, stage manager, hairdressers, makeup artists and [[catering]] staff. Local crews are typically hired to help move equipment on and off stage. On a small tour with less financial backing, all of these jobs may be handled by just a few roadies or by the musicians themselves. Bands signed with small "indie" labels and bands in genres such as [[hardcore punk]] are more likely to do tours without a road crew, or with minimal support.

===Artist management, representation and staff===

Artists such as singers and musicians may hire a number of people from other fields to assist them with their career. The [[artist manager]] oversees all aspects of an artist's career in exchange for a percentage of the artist's income. An [[entertainment law]]yer assists them with the details of their contracts with record companies and other deals. A [[business manager]] handles financial transactions, taxes and bookkeeping. Unions, such as [[AFTRA]] and the [[American Federation of Musicians]] in the U.S. provide [[health insurance]] and instrument insurance for musicians. A successful artist functions in the market as a [[brand]] and, as such, they may derive income from many other streams, such as [[merchandise]], personal endorsements, appearances (without performing) at events or Internet-based services&lt;ref&gt;http://info.dcc-studios.com/blog/why-branding-is-important-for-djs-and-producers/&lt;/ref&gt;. These are typically overseen by the artist's [[artist manager|manager]] and take the form of relationships between the artist and companies that specialize in these products. Singers may also hire a [[vocal coach]], [[Dance teacher|dance instructor]], [[Drama teacher|acting coach]], [[personal trainer]] or [[life coach]] to help them.

===Emerging business models===

In the 2000s, traditional lines that once divided singers, instrumentalists, publishers, record companies, distributors, retail and consumer electronics have become blurred or erased. Artists may record in a [[home studio]] using a high-end [[laptop]] and a digital recording program such as [[Protools]] or use [[Kickstarter]] to raise money for an expensive studio recording session without involving a record company. Artists may choose to exclusively promote and market themselves using only free online video sharing services such as [[YouTube]] or using [[social media]] websites, bypassing traditional promotion and marketing by a record company. In the 2000s, [[consumer electronics]] and [[computer]] companies such as [[Apple Computer]] have become [[Online music store|digital music retailers]]. New digital music distribution technologies and the trends towards using [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] of older songs in new songs or blending different songs to create [[mashup (music)|"mashup"]] recordings have also forced both governments and the music industry to re-examine the definitions of [[intellectual property]] and the rights of all the parties involved. Also compounding the issue of defining copyright boundaries is the fact that the definition of "royalty" and "copyright" varies from country to country and region to region, which changes the terms of some of these business relationships.

Prior to December 1998, the industry was dominated by the "Big Six": Sony Music and BMG had not yet merged, and [[PolyGram]] had not yet been absorbed into Universal Music Group. After the PolyGram-Universal merger, the 1998 market shares reflected a "Big Five", commanding 77.4% of the market, as follows, according to MEI World Report 2000:
* Independent labels — 22.6%
* Universal Music Group — 21.1%
* Sony Music Entertainment — 17.4%
* EMI — 14.1%
* Warner Music Group — 13.4%
* BMG — 11.4%

In 2004, the joint venture of Sony and BMG created the 'Big Four' at a time the global market was estimated at $30–40&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;According to the [https://www.riaa.com/news/marketingdata/default.asp RIAA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070521233108/http://www.riaa.com/News/marketingdata/default.asp |date=May 21, 2007 }} the world music market is estimated at $40&amp;nbsp;billion, but according to [http://www.ifpi.org/&lt;!--site-content/statistics/worldsales.html--&gt; IFPI] (2004) it is estimated at $32&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;/ref&gt; Total annual unit sales (CDs, music videos, [[MP3]]s) in 2004 were 3&amp;nbsp;billion. Additionally, according to an [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry|IFPI]] report published in August 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20050802.html |title=IFPI releases definitive statistics on global market for recorded music |publisher=Ifpi.org |date=August 2, 2005 |accessdate=September 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the big four accounted for 71.7% of retail music sales:&lt;!--this adds up to 100.1%--&gt;

[[Nielson SoundScan|Nielsen SoundScan]] in their 2011 report noted that the "big four" controlled about 88% of the market:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120105005547/en/Nielsen-Company-Billboard%E2%80%99s-2011-Music-Industry-Report "The Nielsen Company &amp; Billboard's 2011 Music Industry Report,"] Business Wire (January 5, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Warner Music Group]] (USA based) —  19.13% 
* [[:Category:Independent record labels|Independent labels]] — 12.11% 
* EMI Group — 9.62%

After the absorption of EMI by Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group in December 2011 the "big three" were created and on January 8, 2013 after the merger there were layoffs of forty workers from EMI. European regulators forced Universal Music to spin off EMI assets which became the Parlophone Label Group which was acquired by Warner Music Group.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Pakinkis, [http://www.musicweek.com/news/read/emi-lay-offs-reported-in-the-us/053075 "EMI lay-offs reported in the US,"] Music Week (January 8, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nielson SoundScan|Nielsen SoundScan]] issued a report in 2012, noting that these labels controlled 88.5% of the market, and further noted:&lt;ref name="NielsenReport2012"&gt;[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130104005149/en/Nielsen-Company-Billboard%E2%80%99s-2012-Music-Industry-Report "The Nielsen Company &amp; Billboard's 2012 Music Industry Report,"] Business Wire (January 4, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

* Warner Music Group— 19.15%
* Independent labels— 11.42%

Note: the IFPI and Nielsen Soundscan use different methodologies, which makes their figures difficult to compare casually, and impossible to compare scientifically.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clicknoise.net/digital-music-futures-and-the-independent-music-industry/ "Digital Music Futures and the Independent Music Industry",] ''Clicknoise.net'', February 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;


Current Markets shares as of September 2018 are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;IBISWorld report 51221&lt;/ref&gt;
* Warner Music Group — 25.1%
* Universal Music Group — 24.3%
* Sony Corporation — 22.1%
* Other — 28.5%

The largest players in this industry own more than 100 subsidiary record labels or sublabels, each specializing in a certain market niche. Only the industry's most popular artists are signed directly to the major label. These companies account for more than half of US market share. However, this has fallen somewhat in recent years, as the new digital environment allows smaller labels to compete more effectively.&lt;ref&gt;IBISWorld report 51221&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albums sales and market value===
Total album sales have declined in the early decades of the 21st century, leading some music critics to declare the [[death of the album]]. (For instance, the only albums that went platinum in the US in 2014 were the [[Frozen (soundtrack)|soundtrack to the Disney animated film ''Frozen'']] and [[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|Taylor Swift's ''1989'']], whereas several artists did in 2013.)&lt;ref name="noplat"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2014/10/16/not-one-artists-album-has-gone-platinum-in-2014/ |title=Not One Artist's Album Has Gone Platinum In 2014 |last=McIntyre |first=Hugh |date=October 16, 2014 |work=[[Forbes]] |publisher=Forbes, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sanders|first1=Sam|title=Taylor Swift, Platinum Party of One|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2014/11/05/361577726/taylor-swift-platinum-party-of-one|website=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following table shows album sales and market value in the world in 2014.

====2003–2007====
Approximately 21% of the [[gross revenue|gross CD revenue]] numbers in 2003 can be attributed to used CD sales.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} This number grew to approximately 27% in 2007.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} The growth is attributed to increasing on-line sales of used product by outlets such as Amazon.com, the growth of used music media is expected to continue to grow as the cost of digital downloads continues to rise.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} The sale of used goods financially benefits the vendors and online marketplaces, but in the United States, the [[first-sale doctrine]] prevents copyright owners (record labels and publishers, generally) from "double dipping" through a levy on the sale of used music.

====2011====
In mid-2011, the RIAA trumpeted a sales increase of 5% over 2010, stating that "there's probably no one single reason" for the bump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/blog.php?content_selector=riaa-news-blog&amp;blog_selector=Midyear-Digital-Music-Milestones&amp;news_month_filter=7&amp;news_year_filter=2011&amp;searchterms=Music%20sales&amp;terminclude=&amp;termexact=|date=July 11, 2011|accessdate=October 18, 2012|title=Midyear Digital Music Milestones|quote=There's probably no one single reason, but we'd like to think that enhanced marketing efforts – like the sale of music at nontraditional outlets – and anti-piracy successes like the closure of LimeWire have helped.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021050119/http://www.riaa.com/blog.php?content_selector=riaa-news-blog&amp;blog_selector=Midyear-Digital-Music-Milestones&amp;news_month_filter=7&amp;news_year_filter=2011&amp;searchterms=Music%20sales&amp;terminclude=&amp;termexact=|archivedate=October 21, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012====
The Nielsen Company &amp; Billboard's 2012 Industry Report shows overall music sales increased 3.1% over 2011. Digital sales caused this increase, with a Digital Album sales growth of 14.1% and Digital Track sales growth of 5.1%, whereas Physical Music sales decreased by 12.8% versus 2011. Despite the decrease, physical albums were still the dominant album format. Vinyl Record sales increased by 17.7% and Holiday Season Album sales decreased by 7.1%.&lt;ref name="NielsenReport2012" /&gt;

==Transparency==
In the 15 or so years of the Internet economy, the digital music industry has come a long way, but there are still major hurdles to cross. Platforms like [[iTunes]], [[Spotify]], and [[Google Play Music|Google Play]] are major improvements over the early illegal file sharing days, but the multitude of service offerings and revenue models make it difficult to understand the true value of each and what they can deliver for musicians and music companies. These difficulties are further compounded by the fact that, according to a new study from the [[Berklee College of Music]] and its Rethink Music initiative,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/6627418/what-a-mess-new-report-from-berklee-college-of-music-looks-to-fix-an-aging |title=What a Mess: New Report From Berklee College of Music Looks to Fix an Aging, Fractured Business |publisher=Billboard |date=July 14, 2015 |accessdate=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are major transparency problems throughout the music industry caused by outdated technology. With the emerging of new business models as streaming platforms, and online music services, a large amount of data is processed. Access to [[big data]] may increase transparency in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2015/08/transparency-in-the-music-industry.html |title=Creating Transparency In The Music Industry |website=Hypebot.com |date= |accessdate=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Parable of the Ten Virgins (section) by Phoebe Traquair, Mansfield Traquair Church, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|300px|The Parable of the Ten Virgins (section) by [[Phoebe Traquair]], Mansfield Traquair Church, [[Edinburgh]].]]

The '''Parable of the Ten Virgins''', also known as the '''Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins''' or the '''Parable of the ten bridesmaids''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerusalem Bible]]: Matthew 25:1-13&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the well known [[parables of Jesus]]. According to the [[Gospel of Matthew]] [[s:Bible (King James)/Matthew#Chapter 25|25:1-13]], the five virgins who are prepared for the bridegroom's arrival are rewarded, while the five who are not prepared are [[disowned]]. The parable has a clear [[Christian eschatology|eschatological]] theme: be prepared for the [[Day of Judgment]].&lt;ref&gt;John Barton, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3surkLVdw3UC&amp;pg=PA878 The Oxford Bible Commentary]'', Oxford University Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-19-875500-7}}, p. 878.&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the most popular parables in the [[Middle Ages]], with enormous influence on [[Gothic art]], [[sculpture]] and the [[Sacred architecture|architecture]] of German and French [[cathedrals]].

==Narrative according to the [[Gospel of Matthew]]==
In the Parable of the Ten Virgins, [[Jesus]] tells a story about a party of virgins, perhaps bridesmaids &lt;ref name="RTF"/&gt; or torchbearers for a procession,&lt;ref name="BW"/&gt; chosen to participate in a [[Jewish wedding|wedding]]. Each of the ten virgins is carrying a lamp or [[torch]]&lt;ref name="BW"/&gt; as they await the coming of the [[bridegroom]], which they expect at some time during the night. Five of the virgins are wise and have brought oil for their lamps. Five are foolish and have only brought their lamps.

At midnight, all the virgins hear the call to come out to meet the bridegroom. Realising their lamps have gone out, the foolish virgins ask the wise ones for oil, but they refuse, saying that there will certainly not (Greek ''ou mē'')&lt;ref name="JN"&gt;John Nolland, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=9cL_kpdUE-oC&amp;pg=PA1006 The Gospel of Matthew: A commentary on the Greek text]'', Eerdmans, 2005, {{ISBN|0-8028-2389-0}}, pp. 1006–1008.&lt;/ref&gt; be enough for them to share. While the foolish virgins are away trying to get more oil, the bridegroom arrives. The wise virgins then accompany him to the celebration. The others arrive too late and are excluded.

{{quotation|Then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went out to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. Those who were foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them, but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. Now while the bridegroom delayed, they all slumbered and slept. But at midnight there was a cry, "Behold! The bridegroom is coming! Come out to meet him!" Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. The foolish said to the wise, "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out." But the wise answered, saying, "What if there isn't enough for us and you? You go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves." While they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut. Afterward the other virgins also came, saying, "Lord, Lord, open to us." But he answered, "Most certainly I tell you, I don't know you." Watch therefore, for you don't know the day nor the hour in which the [[Son of man (Christianity)|Son of Man]] is coming.|Matthew 25:1-13, [[World English Bible]]}}

==Interpretations==
The parable is one of a sequence of responses to a question in [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] [[s:Bible (King James)/Matthew#Chapter 24|24:3]]:

{{quotation|And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?|Matthew 24:3, [[King James Version]]}}

Other parables in this sequence include the [[parable of the budding fig tree]] (Matthew 24:32–35) and the [[parable of the Faithful Servant]] (Matthew 24:42–51). The parable of the Ten Virgins reinforces the call for readiness in the face of the uncertain time of this second "coming."&lt;ref name="RTF"&gt;R. T. France, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ttTgacXnLV8C&amp;pg=PA349 The Gospel According to Matthew: An introduction and commentary]'', Eerdmans, 1985, {{ISBN|0-8028-0063-7}}, pp. 349-352.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as a "watching parable."&lt;ref name="CE"&gt;''[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: PARABLES].&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[parable of the Lost Coin]], it is a parable about women which immediately follows, and makes the same point as, a preceding parable about men.&lt;ref&gt;The [[parable of the Lost Coin]] follows the [[parable of the Lost Sheep]] and this parable follows the [[parable of the Faithful Servant]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Francken, Hieronymus the Younger - Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins - c. 1616.jpg|thumb|right|300px|This painting by Hieronymus [[Francken]] the Younger (c. 1616) gives a moralistic interpretation of the parable.]]
In this parable, Jesus Christ is the bridegroom,&lt;ref name="RTF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CE"/&gt; echoing the [[Old Testament]] image of God as the bridegroom in [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] [[s:Bible (King James)/Jeremiah#Chapter 2|2:2]] and similar passages.&lt;ref name="RTF"/&gt; The awaited event is the [[Second Coming of Christ]].&lt;ref name="RTF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CE"/&gt; [[R. T. France]] writes that the parable is "a warning addressed specifically to those inside the professing  church who are not to assume that their future is unconditionally assured."&lt;ref name="RTF"/&gt;

The parable does not criticise the virgins for sleeping, since both groups do that,&lt;ref name="BW"&gt;[[Ben Witherington III|Ben Witherington]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=xGePuntVBhgC&amp;pg=PA43 Women in the Ministry of Jesus: A study of Jesus' attitudes to women and their roles as reflected in his earthly life]'', Cambridge University Press, 1987, {{ISBN|0-521-34781-5}}, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; but for being unprepared as they brought no oil (it is unclear as to whether the foolish virgins succeed in purchasing any oil that night:&lt;ref&gt;John R. Donahue, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=9ArODuoyndAC&amp;pg=PA134 Hearing the Word of God: Reflections on the Sunday Readings: Year A]'', Liturgical Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-8146-2785-4}}, p. 134: "We never know whether they found it, but when they return, the feast has started and the door is barred."&lt;/ref&gt; most shops would not have been open&lt;ref&gt;[[Craig S. Keener]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8C2Y_HaL5W0C&amp;pg=PA597 The Gospel of Matthew: A Socio-Rhetorical Commentary]'', Eerdmans, 2009, {{ISBN|0-8028-6498-8}}, p. 597.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Dwight Pentecost]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=k_VVxjLkN2UC&amp;pg=PA150 The Parables of Jesus: Lessons in life from the Master Teacher]'', Kregel Publications, 1998, {{ISBN|0-8254-3458-0}}, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;).

The parable is not written in praise of virginity,&lt;ref name="CE"/&gt; and indeed [[Louis of Granada]], in his ''The Sinner's Guide'' of 1555, writes "No one makes intercession with the Bridegroom for the five foolish virgins who, after despising the pleasures of the flesh and stifling in their hearts the fire of concupiscence, nay, after observing the great counsel of virginity, neglected the precept of humility and became inflated with pride on account of their virginity."&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis of Granada]], ''[http://www.ewtn.org/library/SPIRIT/granada1-9.htm The Sinner's Guide]'', 1555.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spencer W. Kimball]] gave an [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS]] perspective on the difference between the wise and the foolish virgins, and why they could not share the oil: "This was not selfishness or unkindness. The kind of oil that is needed to illuminate the way and light up the darkness is not shareable. How can one share obedience to the principle of tithing; a mind at peace from righteous living; an accumulation of knowledge? How can one share faith or testimony? How can one share attitudes or chastity.... Each must obtain that kind of oil for himself .... In the parable, oil can be purchased at the market. In our lives the oil of preparedness is accumulated drop by drop in righteous living."&lt;ref&gt;[[Spencer W. Kimball]], ''Faith Precedes the Miracle'', p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LDS Business College - 14Jul2010 - LDS interpretation "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ldsbc.edu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1235:preparation-a-learning-model-discovery&amp;catid=9:devotionals&amp;Itemid=554|title=LDS Business College Devotional - Preparation: A Learning Model Discovery|last=Henrie|first=Lynda|date=July 14, 2010|publisher=[[LDS Business College]]|accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authenticity==
While "a considerable number of exegetes in fact suppose that the parable of 'The Wise and Foolish Virgins' ultimately goes back to Jesus,"&lt;ref name="JL"&gt;[[Jan Lambrecht (New Testament scholar)|Jan Lambrecht]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PXfgMs0FIbgC&amp;pg=PA204 Out of the Treasure: The parables in the Gospel of Matthew]'', Peeters, 1991, {{ISBN|90-6831-161-1}}, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; some Bible commentators, because of its [[Christian eschatology|eschatological]] nature,  doubt that Jesus ever told this parable and that, instead, it is a parable created by the very early church. A large majority of fellows on the [[Jesus Seminar]], for example, designated the parable as merely similar to something Jesus might have said or simply inauthentic ("gray" or "black").&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert W. Funk|Funk, Robert W.]], Roy W. Hoover, and the Jesus Seminar. ''The Five Gospels.'' Harper:San Francisco, 1993, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;  Other scholars believe that this parable has only been lightly edited, and is an excellent example of Jesus' skill in telling parables.&lt;ref&gt;[[Klyne Snodgrass]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=kFyt0VhErywC&amp;pg=PA505 Stories with Intent: A comprehensive guide to the parables of Jesus]'', Eerdmans, 2008, {{ISBN|0-8028-4241-0}}, p. 505.&lt;/ref&gt; The parable occurs in all ancient [[New Testament manuscripts]], with only slight variations in some words.&lt;ref&gt;United Bible Societies, ''The Greek New Testament'', 1983, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liturgical use==
In the [[Catholic Church]], the parable is the Gospel reading for the 32nd Sunday in [[Ordinary Time]] in Cycle A; in the extraordinary form of the Roman rite (Tridentine Mass), the parable is the Gospel reading for Masses of virgins and virgin martyrs (including, by coincidence, St. [[Cecilia of Rome|Cecily]] on November 22 and St. [[Catherine of Alexandria|Catherine]] on November 25, giving it a certain prominence at the fitting time of the end of the liturgical year). The parable is the Gospel reading for the 27th Sunday after [[Trinity Sunday|Trinity]] in the traditional [[Lutheran]] lectionary. In the [[Revised Common Lectionary]], the parable is read in ''[[Proper (liturgy)|Proper]] 27 (32nd Sunday in Ordinary Time)''. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts.php?id=168 |website=https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/ |publisher=Vanderbilt University |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Armenian Orthodox Church]] the parable is the main theme of [[Holy Monday]]. A special Church service enacting the parable of the ten virgins is celebrated on Tuesday evening of the [[Holy Week]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

In the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], the parable is used to commemorate the Sunday [[vespers]] service of [[Nahire]]. Nahire symbolizes our lives in accordance with the 10 virgins that only through a life of dedication, vigilance, fasting and prayer can we be ready for the Bridegroom himself.

==In the arts==
This parable has been a popular subject for painting, sculpture, music, and drama.

[[File:Schadow,FW-Die klugen und törichten Jungfrauen-1.JPG|thumb|right|[[Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow]], ''The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins'', 1838–1842 (detail), [[Städel|Städel Museum]],  Frankfurt am Main.]]

===Painting===
The parable has been depicted in several paintings, including altarpieces in Northern Europe.  A recent example, from 1954, is by [[Tove Jansson]]. In the 19th century, the artists of the [[Nazarene movement]] also took up this theme.

===Sculpture===
Sculptures of the wise and foolish virgins were a common motif in mediaeval ecclesial architecture in Europe, especially for the decoration of doorways, and carved figures representing them appear on many of the mediaeval churches and cathedrals of the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]], including:
[[File:France Strasbourg Cathedral Wise virgins and Christ.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Three wise virgins appear with [[Christ]] on [[Strasbourg Cathedral]].]]
* [[Amiens Cathedral]]
* [[Auxerre Cathedral]]
* [[Laon Cathedral]]
* [[Notre Dame de Paris]]
* [[Cathedral of Notre-Dame, Reims]]
* [[Strasbourg Cathedral]]
* [[Erfurt Cathedral]]
* [[Cathedral of Magdeburg|Magdeburg Cathedral]]

The virgins are also depicted on cathedrals in Switzerland and other countries; the portal leading into the main church of [[Hovhannavank]] (1216-1221) in Armenia has carved scenes from the Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins.

The ubiquity of such sculptures has inspired fictional descriptions, such as the carvings on the doors of Kingsbridge cathedral in [[Ken Follett|Ken Follett's]] novel ''[[World Without End (Follett novel)|World Without End]]'', set in the [[Late Middle Ages]].

===Music===
Several religious musical compositions have been inspired by the parable. Its message was formed into a [[hymn]], "[[Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme]]", by [[Philipp Nicolai]], which [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] used for his [[Chorale cantata (Bach)|chorale cantata]] [[Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme, BWV 140|''Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme'', BWV 140]]. The parable forms the theme for several hymns, including the 19th century hymn "Behold the Bridegroom Cometh" by [[George Frederick Root]], which begins:
[[File:StAnnen DieKlugenJungfrauen.jpg|thumb|The five wise virgins together with a personification of the Church (c. 1400), [[St. Anne's Museum Quarter, Lübeck#St. Anne's museum (Museum for history of art and culture)|St. Anne's museum]], Lübeck]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Our lamps are trimmed and burning,&lt;br&gt;
Our robes are white and clean;&lt;br&gt;
We’ve tarried for the Bridegroom,&lt;br&gt;
Oh, may we enter in?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[The Wise Virgins]] is a one-act ballet, written in 1941 by [[William Walton]], based on the music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], with choreography by Frederick Ashton.  It is based on the biblical Parable of the Ten Virgins.

"[[Keep Your Lamp Trimmed and Burning]]" is a [[gospel blues]] song based on the parable. It has been recorded by such artists as [[Blind Willie Johnson]], [[Pearly Brown|Reverend Pearly Brown]], and [[Reverend Gary Davis|Rev. "Blind" Gary Davis]].

Non-religious music has also used the parable as a theme, such as the ballet "The wise and the foolish virgins" by Swedish composer [[Kurt Atterberg]] (1887–1974), written in 1920.

A reference is made to the parable in the 2002 [[Johnny Cash]] song "[[The Man Comes Around (song)|The Man Comes Around]]," which draws heavily on the Bible.

On the 1974 album by [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] - ''[[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway]]'', a reference to the parable is made in the song ''[[The Carpet Crawlers]]'': "and the wise and foolish virgins giggle with their bodies glowing bright."

American composer [[Emily Freeman-Brown]] has also composed an [[oratorio]] based on the parable. {{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Drama===
From early Christian times, the story of the ten virgins has been told as a [[mystery play]]. [[Methodius of Olympus|St Methodius]] wrote the ''Banquet of the Ten Virgins'',&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0623.htm Banquet of the Ten Virgins]''&lt;/ref&gt; a mystery play in Greek. ''[[Sponsus]]'', a mid-11th-century play, was performed in both Latin and Occitan. The German play ''[[Ludus de decem virginibus]]'' was first performed on 4 May 1321. There was also a Dutch play of the late Middle Ages.

'''Pavilion by the Lake''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: ''{{lang|zh|湖边凉亭}}'') is a painting during [[Korean peninsula]]’s [[Joseon dynasty]] period. Created in the late 18th century AD, this painting measures 45.4 cm in height and 27.6 cm in width. This painting is created by an unknown artist whose style name is ''Samoje'' (literally, "Studio of Three-Five"). The artist, probably a professional painter from the ''jungin'' (middle people) class of [[Joseon dynasty]] cannot be ascertained due to lack of documentation. So it is difficult to confirm the identity and the given name of the artist.&lt;ref name=met&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/40429 |title=Pavilion by the Lake |publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The composition of the "Pavilion by the Lake" were likely adapted from popular painting manuals of [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644) imported from [[China]]. One of the most prominent examples for those painting manuals was the ''[[Manual of the Mustard Seed Garden|Mustard Seed Garden]]'' ({{zh|芥子園畫傳}}, Jieziyuan Huazhuan) manual of painting.&lt;ref name=jour&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Hiscox M J |author2=Sze M |title=The Mustard Seed Garden Manual of Painting[M] |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1977 |access-date=2017-11-22|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/1548966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Petäjävesi Old Church''' ({{lang-fi|Petäjäveden vanha kirkko}}) is a wooden church located in [[Petäjävesi]], [[Finland]]. It was built between 1763 and 1765, when [[Tavastia (historical province)|Tavastia]] was still a part of [[Sweden]]. The bell tower was built in 1821. It was inscribed in 1994 on the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]]. 

The church is located about {{convert|1|km}} to the west of the centre of Petäjävesi. The church went out of use in 1879 when the new church was built. The old church has retained its original appearance and its interior decoration exceptionally well. It is a popular church for weddings in the summer, and there is a church service on most Sundays.

==Construction==
The church was built as the chapel for the area of Petäjävesi, which has belonged to the congregation of Jämsä. The local people had been given the permission to build a graveyard and a small village church at their own expense by the crown as early as in 1728 because the trip to Jämsä was long, however it took about 35 years until the construction began. The church was planned and built by Jaakko Klemetinpoika Leppänen, a church builder from [[Vesanka]]. In 1821 the windows were enlarged and the sacristy was moved from the northern part of the church to the east. The bell tower was also added by Erkki Leppänen, the grandson of the original builder.

==Architecture==
The cross-type floor plan of the church came into use in the Nordic countries at the end of the 17th century and became common in the 18th century in the countryside churches {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. The high roof resembles the earlier [[gothic architecture|gothic style]].

==From forgotten to world heritage==
After the new church was built, the old remained abandoned for a long time. Only the cemetery around the church and the belltower were in use. In the 1920s an Austrian art historian [[Josef Strzygowski]] noticed the architectural and historical value of the church and since 1929 it has been restored several times. In 1994 it was approved in the UNESCO's World Heritage Sites representing typical eastern Scandinavian wooden church tradition.

'''''Pia de' Tolomei''''' is an [[oil painting]] on canvas by English artist [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], painted around 1868 and currently housed at the [[Spencer Museum of Art]], on the campus of the [[University of Kansas]] in [[Lawrence, Kansas]]. 

==History==
This work was painted at the start of Rossetti's affair with [[Jane Morris]], who modelled for the picture. As he was to do with ''[[Beata Beatrix]]'' (1870), Rossetti chose a tale by [[Dante Aligheri]] (from ''[[Purgatorio]]'') to illustrate his love for his model. The story tells of a woman whose husband imprisoned and later poisoned her:&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Dante Alighieri]], [[The Divine Comedy]]'', "[[Purgatorio]]", Canto V, vv.130-136 "[[Pia de' Tolomei]]". &lt;/ref&gt; Rossetti wanted the world to believe the fantasy with which he was deluding himself - that [[William Morris]] kept Jane against her will. He continued this theme, as shown in ''[[Proserpine (Rossetti painting)|Proserpine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;J. Treuherz, [[Elizabeth Prettejohn|E. Prettejohn]], and E. Becker. ''Dante Gabriel Rossetti''. London: Thames &amp; Hudson (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Rossetti not only drew Jane exhaustively, he also choreographed photographic sessions of her and used the photographs as preliminary sketches for drawings. Amongst other representations of her, Rossetti depicts Jane as [[Proserpina|Proserpine]], [[Queen Guinevere]] and [[Desdemona]] - all of whom were at the mercy of men.&lt;ref&gt;V. Surtees. ''Dante Gabriel Rossetti''. Vol.I, Oxford: Clarendon Press (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

Jane appears disproportionately large in most of Rossetti's pictures. The background is immaterial as long as the viewer focuses on the beauty of her face. In ''Pia de' Tolomei'' her elongated neck seems almost dislocated, and the whiteness of her skin shines out, defying the viewer to pay attention to any other aspects of the painting. Miller's hair colour is misrepresented in the painting. Her natural colour was dark brown, yet Rossetti paints it with an auburn tinge - closer to [[Lizzie Siddal]]'s hair colour than Miller's. Also, her hands are twisted and intertwined in a peculiar way.&lt;ref&gt;O. Doughty, ''A Victorian Romantic: Dante Gabriel Rossetti''  London: Frederick Muller (1949).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plateresque''', meaning "in the manner of a silversmith" (''plata'' being [[silver]] in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]), was an [[art]]istic movement, especially [[Architecture|architectural]], developed in [[Spanish Empire|Spain and its territories]], which appeared between the late [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and early [[Renaissance]] in the late 15th century, and spread over the next two centuries. It is a modification of Gothic spatial concepts and an eclectic blend of [[Mudéjar]], [[Flamboyant]] Gothic and [[Lombard architecture|Lombard]] decorative components, as well as Renaissance elements of [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] origin.&lt;ref name="bozal"&gt;Bozal, Valeriano; ''Art history in Spain: From the origins to the Enlightenment'', pp. 157, 165. Ed Akal (1978). {{ISBN|978-84-7090-025-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Examples of this [[syncretism]] are the inclusion of shields and pinnacles on facades, columns built in the Renaissance neoclassical manner, and facades divided into three parts (in Renaissance architecture they are divided into two). It reached its peak during the reign of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]],&lt;ref name="arellano"&gt;Arellano, Fernando; ''The Hispanic American Art'', pp. 13–14. Ed. Universidad Católica Andrés (1988). {{ISBN|978-980-244-017-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; especially in [[Salamanca]], but also flourished in other such cities of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] as [[León, León|León]] and [[Burgos]] and in the territory of [[New Spain]], which is now [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="bozal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="arellano" /&gt; 

Plateresque has been considered down to current times a Renaissance style by many scholars. To others, it is its own style, and sometimes receives the designation of ''Protorenaissance''.&lt;ref name="arias" /&gt;&lt;ref name="marias"&gt;Marías, Fernando; ''The 16th century: Gothic and Renaissance'', p. 24. Ed. Silex Ediciones (2002). {{ISBN|978-84-7737-037-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some even call it ''First Renaissance'' in a refusal to consider it as a style in itself, but to distinguish it from non-Spanish Renaissance works.&lt;ref name="alonso" /&gt;

The style is characterized by ornate decorative facades covered with floral designs, chandeliers, [[festoon]]s, fantastic creatures and all sorts of configurations.&lt;ref name="arellano" /&gt; The spatial arrangement, however, is more clearly Gothic-inspired. This fixation on specific parts and their spacing, without structural changes of the Gothic pattern, causes it to be often classified as simply a variation of Renaissance style.&lt;ref name="Bendala2003"&gt;Bendala Galán, Manuel; ''Manual of the Spanish art'', p. 416. Ed. Silex Ediciones (2003). {{ISBN|978-84-7737-099-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In New Spain the Plateresque acquired its own configuration, clinging tightly to its Mudéjar heritage and blending with Native American influences.&lt;ref name="arellano" /&gt;

In Spain its development is most remarkable in the city of Salamanca although examples are found in most regions of the country.

In the 19th century with the rise of [[Historicism (art)|historicism]], the Plateresque architectural style was revived under the name of [[Monterrey Style]].&lt;ref&gt;Bendala 2003, p. 739&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The name Plateresque came from the silversmith trade. [[Diego Ortiz de Zúñiga]] used it for the first time, applying it to the Royal Chapel of the [[Cathedral of Seville]] in the 17th century.&lt;ref name="bozal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="arellano" /&gt;

== Problems of geographical area and consideration as Style ==
[[File:Cañas-Monsteriuo de Santa Maria del Salvador.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Altar plateresque of the [[Cistercian architecture|Cistercian monastery]] of Santa María del Salvador, in Cañas ([[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]])]]
[[File:Burgos - Convento Sta Dorotea 03.JPG|thumb|left|220px|Tomb of the Saint Juan de Ortega in the church of the convent of Santa Dorotea, [[Burgos]]]]

Traditionally Plateresque has been considered a style exclusively "Spanish", a term also applied to architecture in the Spanish territories held by the [[Crown of Spain|Spanish Crown]] between the 15th and 17th centuries. But by the mid-20th century this geographical connotation was questioned under the arguments of several authors, especially [[Camón Aznar]] (1945) and Rosenthal (1958), who defined Plateresque generically as a unitary amalgam of elements&amp;nbsp;– Gothic, Muslim, and Renaissance. Aznar does not regard it as a style properly denoted as Renaissance, and Rosenthal emphasizes its association with certain buildings in other European countries, mainly France and Portugal, but also Germany and others.&lt;ref name="arias"&gt;Arias de Cossío, Ana María; ''The Art of the Spanish Renaissance'', pp. 90–91. Ed. Encuentro (2009). {{ISBN|978-84-7490-909-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="alonso"&gt;Alonso Ruiz, Begoña; ''Late Gothic architecture in Castile: los Rasines'', p. 23. Ed. University of Cantabria (2003). {{ISBN|978-84-8102-304-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nieto Alcaide, Víctor Manuel; Morales, Alfredo José; Checa Cremades, Fernando; ''Renaissance architecture in Spain, 1488–1599'', p. 60. Ed. Cátedra (1989). {{ISBN|978-84-376-0830-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This problem highlights the imprecision of the name Plateresque and the difficulties inherent in using it to describe productions from a period of confusion and transition between styles, especially since they are characterized by decorative profusion suggesting an attempt to disguise the failure of Spanish architects to develop new structural and spatial ideas. It has even been suggested that this problem could be solved by identifying what is called Plateresque as the replacement of Gothic decoration with  grotesques inspired by the works of the Italian [[Sebastiano Serlio]].&lt;ref name="bassegoda"&gt;Bassegoda Nonell, Juan; ''History of the architecture'', p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;

Any persuasive argument, however, must admit that the Plateresque or Protorenaissance was an artistic movement that responded to the demands of the ruling classes of imperial Spain, which had just completed the [[Reconquista]] and begun the colonization of the Americas. The Spanish were developing a consciousness of their growing power and wealth, and in their exuberance launched a period of construction of grand monuments to symbolize these with what are now considered national treasures.

== Features ==
=== Spanish Plateresque ===

Typical Plateresque facades, like those of [[altarpiece]]s, were made as carefully as if they were the works of [[goldsmith]]s, and decorated as profusely. The decoration, although of various inspirations, was mainly of plant motifs, but also had a profusion of medallions, heraldic devices and animal figures, among others. Plateresque utilized a wealth of materials: gold plates on [[Battlement|crests]] and roofs, vases, etc. There is evidence of more [[polychrome]] works at the conclusion of the first third of the 16th century, when there appeared heraldic crests of historical provenance and long balustrades, to mention one kind of less busy decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Quesada Marco, Sebastián; ''Dictionary of Spanish culture and civilization'', p. 64. Ed. Akal (1997). {{ISBN|978-84-7090-305-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proliferation of decoration for all architectural surfaces led to the creation of new surfaces and subspaces, which were in turn decorated profusely, such as [[Niche (architecture)|niches]] and [[aedicula]]s.&lt;ref name="avila"&gt;Ávila, Ana; ''Images and symbols in the Spanish painted architecture (1470–1560)'', pp 80–83. Ed. Anthropos (1993). {{ISBN|978-84-7658-417-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian elements were also being developed progressively as decoration: [[Rustication (architecture)|rustications]], classical [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]], Roman [[arch]]es and especially grotesques.&lt;ref&gt;Amorós, Andrés, y Camarero, Manuel; ''Annotated Anthology of the Spanish literature: history and texts: 16th century'', p. 183. Ed. Castalia (2006). {{ISBN|978-84-9740-125-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The decoration had specific meanings and can not be read as merely decorative; thus laurels, military shields and horns-of-plenty were placed in the houses of military personnel. In a similar vein, Greek and Roman myths were depicted elsewhere to represent abstract humanist ideals, so that the decorative became a means to express and disseminate Renaissance ideals.&lt;ref name="avila" /&gt;

Plataresque implemented and preferred new spatial aspects, so ''caustrales'', or stairs of open boxes, made their appearance.&lt;ref name="Marías, Fernando p. 163"&gt;Marías, Fernando; ''El siglo XVU: Gothic and Renaissance'', p. 163. Ed. Silex Ediciones (1992). {{ISBN|978-84-7737-037-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were few spatial changes with respect to the Gothic tradition.

=== American Plateresque ===

In America, especially in today's Mexico, various indigenous cultures were in certain stages of development that can be considered Baroque when the Spanish brought with them the Plateresque style. This European phenomenon mixed symbiotically with local traditions, so that pure Gothic architecture was not built in America itself, but the Plateresque mixed with Native American influences, soon evolving into what came to be called American Baroque.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alejo Carpentier|Carpentier, Alejo]]; Márquez Rodríguez, Alexis; y García Carranza, Araceli; ''Recovered steps: Essays  of Theory and Literary Criticism'', p. 37. Ed. Fundación Biblioteca Ayacucho (2003). {{ISBN|978-980-276-354-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The Plateresque style follows the line of [[Isabelline Gothic|Isabelline]], where decorative elements of Italianate origin combine with Iberian traditional elements to form ornamental complexes that overlay the Gothic structures. We can speak of Plateresque that retains Gothic forms as a basis until 1530. After that date, although it continued to be used and Plateresque ornaments were still evolving, it became part of an architecture that was beginning to incorporate Renaissance ideas. In 1563, with the start of construction of the [[El Escorial|monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial]], the Renaissance architecture was purified through the interventions of [[Juan de Herrera]], which ended the splendor and spread of the Plateresque in the Iberian Peninsula.&lt;ref name="arias" /&gt; But in Mexico it was not forgotten, leading to a [[Neo-Plateresque]] style in the 18th century.

In any case the Plateresque, considered or not as a style, and whether exclusively Spanish or more broadly European, represents the transition between Gothic and Renaissance styles.

=== Isabelline Style (15th century) ===
{{Main|Isabelline style|Manueline}}

In the 15th century a tendency to decorate with flamboyance began to develop in the [[Crown of Castile]] from [[Flanders|Flemish]], Islamic and Castilian architecture, which received the name of [[Isabelline Gothic]] because most of the construction was done at the command of [[Isabella I of Castile]]. These ornaments, which were of progressive complexity, did not influence the internal structure of the buildings.

Something similar happened in the same period in Portugal, resulting in what became known as the [[Manueline]] style.

=== Plateresque Gothic (late 15th century–1530) ===

A movement began in late 15th century Spain to disguise Gothic buildings with florid decoration, especially grotesques, but the superficial application of this principle did not change the spatial qualities or architectural structure of those buildings. This process began when the Renaissance arrived in [[Spain]] and architects began copying Renaissance architectural features without understanding the new ideas behind them, that is, without letting go of medieval forms and ideas.

Many of the Plateresque buildings were already built, to which were added only layers of Renaissance ornamentation, especially around openings (windows and doors), and in general, all non-architectural elements, with some exceptions.&lt;ref name="avila"/&gt;

Although the appellation 'Plateresque' is usually applied to the act of superimposing new Renaissance elements on forms governed by medieval guidelines in architecture, this trend is also seen in the Spanish [[painting]] and [[sculpture]] of the time.&lt;ref name="Marías, Fernando p. 163"/&gt;

=== Plateresque Renaissance (1530–1560) ===

This is the period in which the Renaissance had taken hold on the [[Iberian Peninsula]], although it had not yet reached its peak there. That event occurred with the amendments by [[Juan de Herrera]] and [[Philip II of Spain]] to the design of the [[El Escorial|monastery of El Escorial]], whose construction began in 1563.

By that time the decoration, though still profuse, is completely within Italianate parameters and applied to buildings designed according to the logic of Renaissance ideas.

=== Monterrey Style (19th century and first third of 20th century) ===
[[File:Palacio de Monterrey de la Duquesa de Alba.JPG|thumb|270px|Palace of Monterrey]]
[[File:Ayto2.JPG|thumb|270px|Facade of the City Hall of [[Seville]] in the Plaza de San Francisco work by Diego de Riaño]]
{{Main|Monterrey style}}

The Monterrey style arose in the 19th century. It was named after the [[Palace of Monterrey]] in [[Salamanca]], which was built in a Neo-Plateresque style, an [[Historicism (art)|historicism]] of the Plateresque.

The style survived until the early 20th century, featured in national and regional 'revivals'. It spread widely, and though not accepted in the critical circles of academia, some examples can be found on the [[Gran Vía (Madrid)|Gran Vía]] of [[Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;Navascués Palacio, Pedro, y Alonso Pereira, José Ramón; ''La Gran Vía de Madrid''. Ed. Encuentro (2002). {{ISBN|978-84-7490-667-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Of San Antonio Gómez, Carlos; ''The Madrid of the, 98:

In Mexico there was also a new iteration of Plateresque which spread to the Southwestern United States, beginning in the first half of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Zuno Hernández, José Guadalupe; ''History of the arts in the Mexican Revolution'', vol. 2, p. 41. Ed. National Institute of Historical Studies of the Mexican Revolution (1967).&lt;/ref&gt; This Neo-plateresque is not to be confused with that of Spain at the end of 19th and early 20th centuries, the so-called Monterrey style.

== Plateresque Revival ==
In the [[Spanish Colonial Revival architecture]] style centuries later, it was differentiated from the earlier and plainer [[Mission Revival Style architecture|Mission Revival style]] with the additional refinement of Plateresque and [[Churrigueresque]] detailing. [[Bertram Goodhue]] and [[Carleton Winslow]] Sr. studied [[Spanish Colonial architecture|Spanish Colonial structures]] in Mexico before  designing the [[Panama–California Exposition|1915 Panama-California Exposition]] in [[San Diego, California]], that introduced this style to the United States and subsequent widespread popularity. In Mexico there are other examples, such as the [[Palacio de Correos de Mexico]].

'''Political cinema''' in the narrow sense of the term is a cinema which portrays current or historical events or social conditions in a partisan way in order to inform or to agitate the spectator.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Political cinema exists in different forms such as [[documentary film|documentaries]], feature films, or even animated and [[experimental film]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Notion==
Political cinema in the narrow sense of the term refers to political films which do not hide their political stance. This does not mean that they are necessarily pure [[propaganda]]. The difference to other films is not that they are political but how they show it.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Even ostensibly "apolitical" escapist films, which promise "mere entertainment" as an escape from everyday life, however, fulfill a political function. The authorities in Nazi Germany knew this very well and organized a large production of deliberately escapist movies.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

In other entertainment movies, for example [[western (genre)|western]]s, the ideological bias is evident in the distortion of historical reality. A "classical" western would rarely portray black cowboys, although there were a great many of them. Hollywood Cinema or more generally speaking so called [[Dominant Cinema]], was often accused of misrepresenting black, women, gays and working-class people.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

More fundamentally not only the content of individual films is political but also the [[institution]] of cinema itself. A huge number of people congregate not to act together or to talk to each other but, after having paid for it, to sit silently, to be spectators separated from each other. (Of course the behaviour of the public is not always the same in all countries.) [[Guy Debord]], a critic of the society of the spectacle, for whom "separation is the alpha and omega of the spectacle" was therefore also violently opposed to Cinema, even though he would make several movies portraying his ideas.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Cinema, World War I and its aftermath==
Before World War I French cinema had a big share of the world market. Hollywood used the collapse of the French production to establish its [[hegemony]]. Ever since it has dominated world film production not only economically but has transformed cinema into a means to disseminate American values.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

In Germany the [[Universum Film AG]], better known as UFA, was founded to counter the perceived dominance of western propaganda. During the Weimar Republic many films about [[Frederick II of Prussia]] had a conservative nationalistic agenda, as [[Siegfried Kracauer]] and other film critics noted.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Communists like [[Willi Münzenberg]] saw the Russian cinema as a model of political cinema. Soviet films by [[Sergei Eisenstein]], [[Dziga Vertov]] and others combined a partisan view of the bolshevist regime with artistic innovation which also appealed to western audiences.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Film and National Socialism==
[[Leni Riefenstahl]] has never been able or willing to face her responsibility as a chief propagandist for National Socialism. Almost unlimited resources and her undeniable talent led to results which despite their hideous aims still fascinate some film aficionados. There is much controversy around her work, but it is generally accepted that Riefenstahl's main commitment was to moviemaking, rather than to the Nazi party. Proof of that might be seen by the portrayal of [[Jesse Owens]]' victory on the movie ''[[Olympia (1938 film)|Olympia]]'' (about the Olympic games in [[Germany]]) and in her later work, mostly on her photographic expeditions to Africa.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The same is certainly not true of the violently antisemite films of Fritz Hippler. Other Nazi political films made propaganda for so-called [[euthanasia]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Forms==
Form has always been an important concern for political film makers. While some, like pioneering [[Lionel Rogosin]],  argued that radical films, in order to liberate the imagination of the spectator, have to break not only with the content but also with the form of Dominant cinema, the falsely reassuring clichés and stereotypes of conventional narrative film making, other directors such as [[Francesco Rosi]], [[Costa Gavras]], [[Ken Loach]], [[Oliver Stone]], [[Spike Lee]] or [[Lina Wertmüller]] preferred to work within mainstream cinema to reach a wider audience.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The subversive tradition dates back at least to the French [[avant-garde]] of the 1920s. Even in his more conventional films [[Luis Buñuel]] stuck to the spirit of outright [[revolt]] of L'Âge d'or. The bourgeoisie had to be expropriated and all its values destroyed, the surrealists believed. This spirit of revolt is also present in all films of [[Jean Vigo]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Remembrance and reflection==
Especially in the last decades of the twentieth century, many film makers considered focusing on remembrance of and reflection upon major collective crimes such as [[The Holocaust]], [[slavery]] and disasters such as the [[Chernobyl disaster]] to be their political and moral duty.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Globalization and related world issues==
Political cinema of the twenty-first century seems to focus on controversial topics such as [[globalization]], [[AIDS]] and other health-care concerns, issues pertaining to the [[natural environment|environment]], such as [[world energy resources and consumption]] and [[climate change]], and other complex matters pertaining to [[terrorism]], [[war]], [[peace]], [[Religious intolerance|religious and related forms of intolerance]], and [[civil and political rights]] and other [[human rights]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Griffith]]'s highly controversial film, which glorifies the [[Ku Klux Klan]], is widely considered to be a masterpiece because of its impact on the development of the cinema. The basic structure consists of a description of an idealized lost [[idyll]] ("the Old South"), the disruption of this order during [[Reconstruction era of the United States|reconstruction]] after the Civil War, and the restoration of [[White supremacy]], which is shown a legitimate goal that unites the former enemies. In the end the leader of the Ku Klux Klan secures his private happiness too and the alleged idyll is restored.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Had to wait for 5ENSES to close to avoid spoilers but nice projection mapping by @DoloresJoya @CODA ME codame (photo by j bizzie).jpg|thumb|Projection mapping (San Francisco)]]'''Projection mapping''', similar to '''video mapping''' and '''spatial augmented reality''', is a [[video projection|projection]] technology used to turn objects, often irregularly shaped, into a display surface for video projection. These objects may be complex industrial landscapes, such as buildings, small indoor objects or theatrical stages. By using specialized software, a two- or three-dimensional object is spatially mapped on the virtual program which mimics the real environment it is to be projected on.  The software can interact with a projector to fit any desired image onto the surface of that object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is projection mapping|url=http://projection-mapping.org/whatis/|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique is used by artists and advertisers alike who can add extra dimensions, optical illusions, and notions of movement onto previously static objects. The video is commonly combined with, or triggered by, audio to create an audio-visual narrative.

==History==
Although the term "projection mapping" is relatively new, the technique dates back to the late 1990s, where it was referred to as video mapping, spatial augmented reality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raskar|first1=Ramesh|title=Spatially Augmented Reality|journal=IWAR|date=1998|url=http://web.media.mit.edu/~raskar/UNC/Office/0~IWAR_SAR.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[shader lamps]].&lt;ref name=IllustratedHistory&gt;{{cite web|title=The Illustrated History of Projection Mapping|url=http://projection-mapping.org/index.php/intro/160-the-history-of-projection-mapping|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first public displays of projections onto 3D objects was debuted in 1969, when [[Disneyland]] opened their [[Haunted Mansion]] ride, which featured singing busts. Head shots of the singers were filmed on 16mm film and then projected onto busts of their faces to make them appear animated.&lt;ref name=IllustratedHistory/&gt; Another early example of projection mapping was in the 1967 TV movie [[Magical Mystery Tour (film)|Magical Mystery Tour]] during the [[Blue Jay Way]] scene, where images are projected onto [[George Harrison]], including a cat's face and a headless male torso with the words "Magical Mystical Boy" written on its chest.

The next record of projection mapping is from 1980, when installation artist [[Michael Naimark]] filmed people interacting with objects in a living room and then projected it in the room, creating illusions as if the people interacting with the objects were really there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Naimark|first=Michael|title=Spatial Correspondence in Motion Picture Display|url=http://www.naimark.net/writing/spatcorr.pdf|publisher=SPIE Proceedings, vol. 462, Optics and Entertainment, Los Angeles, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Naimark|first=Michael|title=Two Unusual Projection Spaces|url=http://www.naimark.net/writing/projection.html|publisher=Presence, Special Issue on Projection, MIT Press, 14.5, October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first time the concept of projection mapping was investigated academically&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Raskar|first1=Ramesh|title=Spatially Augmented Reality|url=http://web.media.mit.edu/~raskar/UNC/Office/0~IWAR_SAR.pdf|website=Office of the Future|publisher=IWAR|accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the late 1990s, where a team led by [[Ramesh Raskar]] worked on a project called ''Office of the Future'' to connect offices from different locations by projecting people into the office space as if they were really there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Towles|first=Herman|title=Office of the Future|url=http://www.cs.unc.edu/Research/stc/index.html|publisher=UNC}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2001, more artists began using projection mapping in artwork, and groups such as Microsoft began experimenting with it as a means of technological advancement.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==Methods==
[[File:Vivid Sydney - Opera House sails (9002375891).jpg|thumb|The [[Sydney Opera House]] during the 2013 [[Vivid Sydney]] projection display]]
After the object which will be projected on is chosen or created, software is used to map the corners of the video to the surfaces. First, one must choose the images or video to project. Then, place each video on to its designated surface.  Alternatively, one may choose to map the entire scene in 3D and attempt to project and mask the image back onto its framework. The next step is defined as "masking," which means using opacity templates to actually "mask" the exact shapes and positions of the different elements of the building or space of projection. In 3D Mapping, coordinates need to be defined for where the object is placed in relation to the projector, the XYZ orientation, position, and lens specification of the projector have to result to a determined virtual scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Virtual replica of the real scene|url=http://vvvv.org/documentation/how-to-project-on-3d-geometry#virtual-replica-of-the-real-scene|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such tool to help achieve this end is [https://github.com/stuffmatic/blam BLAM!] add-on for [[Blender (software)|blender 3D's]] open source 3D animation suite. Adjustments are commonly needed and made by manually tweaking either the physical or virtual scene for best results. Large projectors with 20,000 lumens output or greater are used for large-scale projections such as on city skyscrapers.  Otherwise, for smaller productions, smaller projectors with less output will work.  A 2200 lumen projector is adequate for projections under indoor light or theatrical lighting in most cases.  Video mapping software such as [[MadMapper]], Qlab, [http://troikatronix.com/ Troixatronix's Isadora], [http://www.videomappingsoftware.com/ FaçadeSignage], [[ArKaos]] MediaMaster and GrandVJ and [[VPT 6.0]] are all downloadable for use in projects like these, though [[Adobe Photoshop]], [[Adobe After Effects]], [http://www.blender.org/ Blender] [https://github.com/stuffmatic/blam Blam!], and other packages can also be used by a creative artist. Also, extensible open-source software frameworks such as MPM (Multi-Projector-Mapper)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Multi-Projector-Mapper|url=http://robotized.arisona.ch/mpm|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; are available among others.  Projection mapping can be separated into four categories:

* [[VJing|VJ'ing or VeeJay-ing (video Jockeying)]] used where live events are augmented by (often interactive to music) projections which are fully dynamic, controlled live, and consist of pre-programmed videos and combinations of effects and effect overlays.
* Theatrical: where projections are preset and scenes are "cued" on demand, usually in a set order, in conjunction with dance or onstage performance, often interactive.
* Static/Interactive: where a display is set up and loops or interacts with the environment and viewers via programming.
* Video: where a generally long segmented show is present as a single fluid video that is not interactive and plays from beginning to end.

Projection mapping first came to prominence through guerrilla advertising campaigns and [[VJing|video jockeys]] for electronic musicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sigrist|first=Peter|title=A short history of 3D projection mapping|url=http://beta.fishburn-hedges.co.uk/2011/04/a-short-history-of-3d-projection-mapping/|accessdate=3 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110417112527/http://beta.fishburn-hedges.co.uk/2011/04/a-short-history-of-3d-projection-mapping/|archivedate=17 April 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large companies such as Nokia, Samsung, Unilever Pakistan, Pakistan Tobacco company, Bank Alfalah, Brighto Paints, Benson &amp; Hedges, John Players Gold Leaf and BMW have since used video projections to create campaigns for their products in major cities across the world. These advertising campaigns commonly use mapping techniques to project scenes onto the sides of buildings. Projection mapping can also be interactive, as Nokia Ovi Maps did a project in which the projections would mimic people's movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Neill|first=Megan|title=Comcast is looking for a Executive Director, XFTV Programming. WEB VIDEO 3D Projection Mapping Taking The Advertising World By Storm|url=http://socialtimes.com/3d-projection-mapping-taking-the-advertising-world-by-storm_b14971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projection mapping has been used at conferences as a means of decoration or immersing audience members in an experienced-based theme. This can be as elaborate as projecting onto a flat surface, or projecting onto an unusual object such as a car or a chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stagerightinc.com/projection-mapping/|title=Projection Mapping For Conferences &amp; Meetings 3D Mapping|website=www.stagerightinc.com|access-date=2017-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;The festival [[Fête des Lumières]] in Lyon, a festival to honour the Virgin Mary, has recently also started incorporating 3D mapping into their productions, creating the illusion of a giant pinball machine on the side of a building. Common techniques for these performances included both 3-D mapping techniques and [[3D projection]] to create the illusion of depth, as well as motion such as crumbling buildings.

The use of projection mapping in TV and films is becoming more popular. For the sci-fi flick Oblivion, the directors used projection mapping to create an immersive environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Projection Mapping in ''Oblivion'' (starring Tom Cruise)|url=http://articles.triplewidemedia.com/projection-mapping-in-the-making-of-oblivion-starring-tom-cruise/}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a 2016 TV commercial, Audi used projection mapping to showcase the technology of the Audi Q7 model. The ad, titled Projection of Greatness&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Projection of Greatness: The all-new Audi Q7|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNAtk0td8aM}}&lt;/ref&gt;, was filmed with no CGI and used only content that was caught live in camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Illuminating Audi’s latest advancements|url=http://strategyonline.ca/2016/11/17/illuminating-audis-latest-advancements/}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

In the electronic dance music (EDM) community, it is becoming increasingly common for DJs to accompany their music with synced visuals. Though normal projection screens are commonly used, some visual artists are beginning to create custom made, 3D installations to project onto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=deadmau5 lights up London with amazing 4D projection- Nokia|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SX2Gd-kqV5s}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many EDM artists employ projection mapping techniques at many of their shows. Artists who are solely visual also use projection mapping as a means of creative expression, believing that it can enhance existing creative mediums such as painting and drawing.

Artists may use it as an avant garde form of expression as it is new technology that can turn their creative ideas into 3D projections, connecting with audiences in a new way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission / Artist Statement|url=http://www.integratedvisions.net/?page_id=59|publisher=Integrated Visions}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video projections have appeared in urban centres such as New York City and London, where artists have used guerilla projections in public without any necessary approval. This way, artists can show their work in any location as anything and anywhere can be a canvas. Often people also use it as a means of activism; the group Occupy Wall Street has used it to project onto the Verizon Wireless building in New York City as a means to visually spread the word that Occupy Wall Street is still alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Day|first=Adrienne|title=When Skyscrapers are your Screen|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/29/arts/design/video-mapping-artists-use-light-as-a-medium.html?_r=1&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese theatre play ''[[Mysteries of Yoshitsune I&amp;II]]'' (2012-14) is notable for the first major use of projection mapping in Japanese theatre stage play.&lt;ref name="Excite"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.excite.co.jp/music/report/1408_gackt2/| title=Moon Saga 〜義経秘伝〜 Vol.2 Live Report| date=2014-08-08| publisher=Excite Japan| accessdate=August 28, 2014| language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://etheatrix01.eplus2.jp/article/402497176.html| title=Gacktが紡ぎだす歴史ファンタジーの世界感を 日本の舞台史上最大規模のプロジェクションマッピングで演出する Moon Saga－義経秘伝－第二章| date=2014-07-24| work=Theatrix| publisher=Entertainment Plus| accessdate=August 28, 2014| language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://etheatrix01.eplus2.jp/article/403940204.html| title=原作、脚本、音楽、演出、主演をGacktがプロデュースする舞台『Moon Saga－義経秘伝－第二章』、絶賛上演中！| date=2014-08-18| work=Theatrix| publisher=Entertainment Plus| accessdate=August 28, 2014| language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, projection mapping has been used more and more frequently by [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] and [[Walt Disney Creative Entertainment]] in the [[Walt Disney Parks &amp; Resorts|Disney Parks]]. Examples of this include, but are not limited to, [[Cinderella Castle#The Magic, the Memories and You|''The Magic, the Memories and You'']], ''[[Disney Dreams!]]'', ''[[Celebrate the Magic]]'', ''[[Once Upon A Time (Tokyo Disneyland)|Once Upon a Time]]'', ''[[Disneyland Forever]]'', ''[[Halloween Screams]]'', ''[[Believe...

[[File:110 Queen Mab, who rules in the Gardens.jpg|thumb|''Queen Mab'', illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]] (1906)]]

'''Queen Mab''' is a [[fairy]] referred to in [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', where "she is the fairies' midwife."  In the play, she is a symbol for freedom and also becomes Romeo's psyche after he realizes that he is also a floating spirit. Later, she appears in other poetry and literature, and in various guises in drama and cinema. In the play, her activity is described in a famous speech by [[Mercutio]] written originally in prose and often adapted into [[iambic pentameter]], in which she is described as a miniature creature who performs midnight pranks upon sleepers.  Being driven by a team of [[Atomy|atomies]], she rides her chariot over their noses and "delivers the fancies of sleeping men." She is also described as a midwife to help sleepers "give birth" to their dreams. She may be a figure borrowed from [[folklore]], and though she is often associated with the Irish [[Medb]] in popular culture, and has been suggested by historian [[Thomas Keightley (historian)|Thomas Keightley]] to be from ''Habundia'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Fairy Mythology: Illustrative of the Romance and Superstition of Various Countries: Volume Two'' [[Thomas Keightley (historian)|Thomas Keightley]], Whittaker, Treacher and co., 1833, page. 135&lt;/ref&gt; a more likely origin for her name would be from [[Mabel]] and the [[Middle English]] derivative "Mabily" (as used by [[Chaucer]])&lt;ref&gt;''Words And Names'', Ernest Weekley, Ayer Publishing, 1932, {{ISBN|0-8369-5918-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8369-5918-5}}. p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; all from the Latin ''amabilis'' ("lovable").&lt;ref&gt;''A dictionary of first names'' Patrick Hanks, Kate Hardcastle, Flavia Hodges, Oxford University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-19-861060-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-861060-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mercutio's speech (in the adapted prose version) ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"O, then, I see '''Queen Mab''' hath been with you. &lt;br&gt;
She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes &lt;br&gt;
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone &lt;br&gt;
On the fore-finger of an alderman, &lt;br&gt;
Drawn with a team of little atomies &lt;br&gt;
Athwart men's noses as they lies asleep; &lt;br&gt;
Her wagon-spokes made of long spinners' legs,&lt;br&gt;
The cover of the wings of grasshoppers, &lt;br&gt;
The traces of the smallest spider's web, &lt;br&gt;
The collars of the moonshine's wat'ry beams, &lt;br&gt;
Her whip of cricket's bone; the lash of film; &lt;br&gt;
Her waggoner a small grey-coated gnat, &lt;br&gt;
Not half so big as a round little worm &lt;br&gt;
Pricked from the lazy finger of a maid:&lt;br&gt;
Her chariot is an empty hazelnut &lt;br&gt;
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,&lt;br&gt;
Time out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers. &lt;br&gt;
And in this state she gallops night by night &lt;br&gt;
Through lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;&lt;br&gt;
O’er courtiers’ knees, that dream on court'sies straight,&lt;br&gt;
O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees,&lt;br&gt;
O’er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream, &lt;br&gt;
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues, &lt;br&gt;
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are: &lt;br&gt;
Sometime she gallops o’er a courtier's nose, &lt;br&gt;
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit; &lt;br&gt;
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail &lt;br&gt;
Tickling a parson's nose as a’ lies asleep, &lt;br&gt;
Then dreams, he of another benefice: &lt;br&gt;
Sometime she driveth o’er a soldier's neck,&lt;br&gt;
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, &lt;br&gt;
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades, &lt;br&gt;
Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon &lt;br&gt;
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,&lt;br&gt;
And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two&lt;br&gt;
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab &lt;br&gt;
That plaits the manes of horses in the night,&lt;br&gt;
And bakes the [[Polish plait|elflock]]s in foul sluttish hairs, &lt;br&gt;
Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes: &lt;br&gt;
This is the [[midwife|hag]], when maids lie on their backs, &lt;br&gt;
That presses them and learns them first to bear, &lt;br&gt;
Making them women of good carriage: &lt;br&gt;
This is she—"

— Mercutio in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', Act I, scene IV
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After her literary debut (as far as we can tell by examining the surviving literature) in ''Romeo and Juliet'', she appears in works of seventeenth-century poetry, notably [[Ben Jonson]]'s "[[The Entertainment at Althorp]]" and [[Michael Drayton]]'s "[[Nymphidia]]". In Poole's work ''Parnassus'', Mab is described as the Queen of the Fairies and [[Queen consort|consort]] to [[Oberon (Fairy King)|Oberon]], Emperor of the Fairies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Spirits, Fairies, Leprechauns and Goblins|last=Rose|first=Carol|publisher=Norton|year=1996|type=Paperback|isbn=0-393-31792-7|chapter=M|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Queen Mab (poem)|Queen Mab: A Philosophical Poem]]'' (1813) is the title of the first large poetic work written by the famous English [[Romantic poet]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] (1792–1822).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/139/shel111.html |title=Complete text of poem |publisher=Bartleby.com |accessdate=29 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herman Melville]]'s epic American novel ''[[Moby Dick]]'' (1851) includes a chapter called "Queen Mab".  The 31st chapter of Melville's work is entitled such because it describes a dream by Captain Ahab's second mate, Stubb.

In [[J. M. Barrie]]'s ''[[The Little White Bird]]'' (1902) Queen Mab lives in [[Kensington Gardens]] and grants [[Peter Pan]] – who has learned he is a boy, and thus can no longer fly – his wish to fly again.

American philosopher [[George Santayana]] wrote a short piece entitled "Queen Mab" which appeared in his 1922 book ''Soliloquies in England and Later Soliloquies''. This particular [[soliloquy]] considers [[English literature]] as an indirect form of self-expression in which the English writer "will dream of what Queen Mab makes other people dream" rather than revealing him or herself.&lt;ref&gt;Santayana, George (1922). ''Soliloquies in England and Later Soliloquies''. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jim Butcher]]'s ''[[The Dresden Files]]'' series, [[The Dresden Files characters#Queen Mab|Queen Mab]] of The Winter Court (also known as 'The Queen of Air and Darkness') is an important recurring character with mysterious motives. Ruler of the [[Classifications of fairies|Unseelie Sidhe]], Mab lives in a dark castle of ice located in the fey worlds of The Nevernever and is generally considered to be incredibly cruel, cold, and a maker of unbreakable pacts.

Queen Mab is the queen of [[Classifications of fairies|the Unseelie Court]] in [[Julie Kagawa]]'s ''[[The Iron Fey Series|The Iron Fey]]'' series.

Queen Mab is one of the three ancient Fae queens, sister to Maeve and Mora, in [[Sarah J. Maas]]'s ''[[Throne of Glass]]'' series.

Queen Mab is one of the primary villains in the late story arcs of the ''[[Hellboy]]'' comic book series.

In Stephen and Owen King’s book ''[[Sleeping Beauties (novel)|Sleeping Beauties]]'', under the alias Evie Black, the main antagonist of the book suggests she is the one being addressed in the Queen Mab speech by Mercutio in ''Romeo and Juliet''.

In [[Andrzej Sapkowski]]'s short story ''Złote popołudnie'' (''The Golden Afternoon'') which is [[postmodern]] retelling of [[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]] the [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Queen of Hearts]] is revealed to be really Queen Mab.

== Film and television ==

In the first episode of season four of [[HBO]]'s original series ''[[True Blood]]'', Queen Mab (portrayed by [[Rebecca Wisocky]]) is the Queen of Faerie who centuries ago ordered the fae to retreat to the Plane of Faerie in the wake of vampire aggression. Under her orders, humans with fae blood (including [[Sookie Stackhouse]]) are being drawn into Faerie as well. When Sookie rebels against her and escapes back to the mortal realm, Queen Mab seals the Faerie portals for good, trapping the half-fae with her and a handful of true fae in Bon Temps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woman |first=The |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/41460/dane-dehaan-and-rebecca-wisocky-joining-true-bloods-season-four |title=Dane DeHaan and Rebecca Wisocky Joining True Blood's Season Four &amp;#124; Horror Movie, DVD, &amp; Book Reviews, News, Interviews at Dread Central |publisher=Dreadcentral.com |date=15 December 2010 |accessdate=29 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not connected with him in the original source material, Queen Mab has been featured in media series featuring [[Merlin]]. She is portrayed by [[Miranda Richardson]] in the 1998 TV miniseries ''[[Merlin (TV miniseries)|Merlin]]'', serving as prominent antagonist to the title character; she is the dark twin to the [[Lady of the Lake]]. In an episode of ''[[Hercules: The Legendary Journeys]]'' from the same year, she is an evil enchantress who has corrupted Arthur; Merlin sends the pair back in time to learn a lesson in humility from Hercules. The 2008 TV series ''[[Merlin (TV series)|Merlin]]'' features Queen Mab as a character in an episode of the show's fifth season, which portrays her as a diminutive green fairy.

== Music ==

The composer [[Hector Berlioz]] wrote a spectacular [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71_Cx9Of_XE “Queen Mab” scherzo] in his [[Romeo et Juliette]] symphony (1839).  Hugh Macdonald describes this piece as "Berlioz's supreme exercise in light [[orchestration|orchestral texture]], a brilliant, gossamer fabric, [[prestissimo]] and [[Dynamics (music)|pianissimo]] almost without pause... The pace and fascination of the movement are irresistible; it is some of the most ethereally brilliant music ever penned."&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald, H. (1969, p51) ''Berlioz Orchestral Music''.  London, BBC.&lt;/ref&gt;

The song by the British rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]] "The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke", based on a painting by [[Richard Dadd]] and included in the album [[Queen II]], mentions Queen Mab and many other characters such as Oberon and Titania.

Songwriter [[Becca Stevens]] set the first half of the text to music on her 2017 album ''Regina''.

== In Art ==

Queen Mab is the name of a fae (a faerie) painted by American artist [[Amy_Brown|Amy Brown]] in 1999. Queen Mab is a Fall faerie, in a flowing brown and black dress with a centerpiece of roses on a white background. In her right hand she holds a tree branch staff adorned with pearls, in her left hand, a "magic glowing orb" - Amy Brown; which she further says in a letter to me: "I was always painting fae holding magic orbs back then".

The '''Royal Entry''', also known by various names, including '''Triumphal Entry''', [[Joyous Entry]], consisted of the ceremonies and festivities accompanying a formal entry by a ruler or his representative into a city in the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Early Modern Period]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Of course other cultures had equivalents, often even more spectacular, especially [[China]] and [[India]].&lt;/ref&gt; The entry centred on a procession carrying the entering prince into the city, where he was greeted and paid appropriate homage by the civic authorities. A feast and other celebrations would follow.

The Entry began as a gesture of loyalty and fealty by a city to the ruler, with its origins in the ''[[Adventus (ceremony)|adventus]]'' celebrated for Roman emperors, which were formal entries far more frequent than [[Roman triumph|triumph]]s. The first visit by a new ruler was normally the occasion, or the first visit with a new spouse. For the capital they often merged with the [[Coronation]] festivities, and for provincial cities they replaced it, sometimes as part of a '''Royal Progress''', or tour of major cities in a realm. (See also [[Itinerant court]], about this.)

From the [[late Middle Ages]]&lt;ref&gt;Earlier transformations of the [[Roman triumph]] in Late Antiquity and the early Middle Ages have been discussed by Michael McCormick, ''Eternal Victory: Triumphal Rulership in Late Antiquity, Byzantium and the Early Medieval West'' (Cambridge University Press) 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; entries became the occasion for increasingly lavish displays of [[Medieval pageant|pageant]]ry and [[propaganda]]. The devising of the [[iconography]], aside from highly conventional patterns into which it quickly settled,&lt;ref&gt;"A remarkably consistent visual and iconographical vocabulary" according to Roy Strong.&lt;/ref&gt; was managed with scrupulous care on the part of the welcoming city by municipal leaders in collaboration with the chapter of the cathedral, the university, or hired specialists. Often the greatest artists, writers and composers of the period were involved in the creation of temporary decorations, of which little record now survives, at least from the early period.

==Origins and development==

The contemporary account from [[Galbert of Bruges]] of the unadorned  "Joyous Advent" of a newly installed [[Count of Flanders]] into "his" city of Bruges, in April 1127, shows that in  the initial stage, undisguised by fawning and triumphalist imagery that came to disguise it, an Entry was similar to a [[parley]], a formal truce between the rival powers of territorial magnate and walled city, in which reiteration of the city's "liberties" in the medieval sense, that is its rights and prerogatives, were set out in clear terms and legitimated by the presence of [[Relic|saintly relics]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"On April 5... at twilight, the king with the newly elected [[william of Ypres|Count William, marquis of Flanders]], came into our town at Bruges. The canons of [[St. Donatian's Cathedral|Saint Donatian]] had come forth to meet them, bearing relics of the saints and welcoming the king and new count joyfully in a solemn procession worthy of a king. On April 6... the king and count assembled with their knights and ours, with the citizens and many Flemings in the usual field where [[Reliquary|reliquaries]] and relics of the saints had been collected. And when silence had been called for, the charter of the liberty of the church and of the privileges of Saint Donatian was read aloud before all... There was also read the little charter of agreement between the count and our citizens... Binding themselves to accept this condition, the king and count took an oath on the relics of saints in the hearing of the clergy and people".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in James M. Murray, "the Liturgy of the Count's Advent in Bruges", ''City and Spectacle in Medieval Europe'', Barbara Hanawalt and Kathryn Reyerson, eds., 1994, p. 137; Murray compares this "political bargain" with a contemporary account of the similar ''Adventus Iocundus'' of April 1384.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The procession of a new Pope to Rome was known as a ''possesso''.  A ruler with a new spouse would also receive an Entry. The entry of Queen [[Isabeau of Bavaria]] into Paris in 1389 was described by the chronicler [[Froissart]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Ribemont, "L'entree d'Isabeau de Bavière à Paris: une fete textuelle pour Froissart," in ''Feste und Feiern'', pp. 515–24.&lt;/ref&gt; The Entries of [[Charles IX of France]] and his Habsburg queen, [[Elisabeth of Austria (1554–1592)|Elizabeth of Austria]], into Paris, March 1571, had been scheduled for Charles alone in 1561, for the ''entrate'' were typically celebrated towards the beginning of a reign,&lt;ref&gt;The entries made by [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand of Aragon]] late in his reign, at Naples (1506), Valencia (1507), Seville (1508) and Valladolid (1509 and 1513), serve as exceptions that were occasioned by his need for confirmative propaganda, following the arrival in Castile of Philip that resolved the succession crisis attendant on the death of Isabella, and Ferdinand's withdrawal into Aragon. (Tess Knighton and Carmen Morte García, "Ferdinand of Aragon's Entry into Valladolid in 1513: The Triumph of a Christian King" ''Early Music History'' '''18''' (1999:119–163) p. 123.)&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[French Wars of Religion]] had made such festivities inappropriate, until the peace that followed the Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye signed in August 1570.&lt;ref name="Victor E 1975"&gt;Victor E. Graham and W. McAllister Johnson, ''The Paris Entries of Charles IX and Elizabeth of Austria 1571'' (University of Toronto Press) 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the mid-14th century, the occasions were relatively simple.  The city authorities waited for the prince and his party outside the city walls, and after handing over a ceremonial key&lt;ref&gt;Lingering into modern times is the ceremonial presentation of the "[[Freedom of the city|key to the city]]" to an honoured guest.&lt;/ref&gt; with a "loyal address" or speech,&lt;ref&gt;At Charles V's entry into Genoa in 1533, a twelve-year-old girl, dressed as Victory and carrying a palm frond, delivered a suitable oration ''all'antica''— in Latin. (George L. Gorse, "An Unpublished Description of the Villa Doria in Genoa during Charles V's Entry, 1533" ''The Art Bulletin'' '''68'''.2 [June 1986:319–322]).&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps stopping to admire ''[[Tableau vivant|tableaux vivants]]'' such as those that were performed at the entry into Paris of Queen [[Isabeau of Bavaria]], described in detail by the chronicler [[Froissart]], conducted him through the streets which were transformed with colour, with houses on the route hanging tapestries and embroideries&lt;ref&gt;The richly worked hangings of a bed would serve.&lt;/ref&gt; or carpets&lt;ref&gt;Pile carpets were displayed on tables or on a dais; pile carpets were not usually trod under foot until the seventeenth century.&lt;/ref&gt; or bolts of cloth from their windows, and with most of the population lining the route.   At Valladolid in 1509
:''the town was so gay, so decked out in wealth and canopies and luxurious carpets, that not even Florence or Venice could match it. All the beautiful ladies were delighted to be on display and were definitely worth seeing, [and] everything was so brilliantly arrayed, that I, who am of the town and have never left it, could not recognize it.''&lt;ref&gt;Luís de Soto, chaplain of the king and coordinator of the Entry, quoted in Knighton and Morte García 1999:139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heraldic displays were ubiquitous: at Valladolid in 1509, the bulls in the fields outside the city were caparisoned with cloths painted with the royal arms and hung with bells.  Along the route the procession would repeatedly halt to admire the set-pieces embellished with [[motto]]es and pictured and living allegories, accompanied by declamations and the blare of trumpets&lt;ref&gt;At Valladolid in 1513 Ferdinand was welcomed with four pairs of [[kettledrums]], trumpets by the dozens, [[shawm]]s and [[sackbut]]s. "They made such a din that if a bird happened to fly past, they made it fall from the sky into the crowd", the chroncicler records. (Knighton and Morte Garcia 1999:125).&lt;/ref&gt; and volleys of artillery. The procession would include members of the [[three Estates]], with the nobility and gentry of the surrounding area, and the clergy and [[guild]]s of the city processing behind the prince.  From the mid-14th century the guild members often wore special uniform clothes, each guild choosing a bright colour; in [[Tournai]] in 1464 three hundred men wore large embroidered silk [[fleur de lys]] (the royal badge) on their chests and backs, at their own expense.&lt;ref&gt;Françoise Piponnier and Perrine Mane; ''Dress in the Middle Ages''; pp. 150–151, Yale UP, 1997; {{ISBN|0-300-06906-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The prince reciprocated by confirming, and sometimes extending, the customary privileges of the city or a local area of which it was the capital.  Usually the prince also visited the cathedral to be received by the bishop and confirm the privileges of the [[cathedral chapter]] also.&lt;ref name="Strong, 1984, p. 7"&gt;Strong, 1984, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; There a ''[[Te Deum]]'' would be customary, and music written for the occasion would be performed.

===Increasing elaboration===
[[File:Entrée de Charles V à Paris.jpg|thumb|[[Charles V of France]] enters Paris after his coronation at Rheims in 1364. Later depiction by [[Jean Fouquet]].]]
During the 14th century, as courtly culture, with the court of Burgundy in the lead,&lt;ref&gt;The refinements of court protocol and the magnificence of court entertainments of [[Philip the Good]] and [[Charles the Bold]] set courtly fashions for decades in the fifteenth century.&lt;/ref&gt; began to stage elaborate dramas re-enacting battles or legends as entertainment during feasts, the cities began to include in entry ceremonies small staged pageant "tableaux", usually organised by the guilds (and any communities of foreign merchants resident), and drawing on their growing experience of [[medieval theatre]] and [[medieval pageant|pageantry]].  Initially these were on religious themes, but "gradually these tableaux developed, through the fifteenth and into the sixteenth century, into a repertory of archways and street-theatres which presented variants of a remarkably consistent visual and iconographical vocabulary."&lt;ref name="Strong, 1984, p. 7"/&gt;  Fortune with her wheel, Fame and Time, the seven Virtues, both Christian and Classical, and the [[Nine Worthies]] and other Classical, Biblical and local heroes,&lt;ref&gt;At [[York]] in 1486 [[Henry VII of England]] was presented with the keys to the city by the mayor and the allegorical founder-figure of ''Eburak'', a phantom king conjured up by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s 12th-century [[The History of the Kings of Britain|history of the kings of Britain]] and embedded in civic cult (Gareth Dean, ''Medieval York'' 2008:50).&lt;/ref&gt; among whose number the honoree was now to be counted. As the tradition developed, the themes became more specific, firstly stressing the legitimacy of the prince, and his claim by descent, then setting before him the princely virtues and their rewards, which especially included the benefits to him of encouraging prosperous cities and provinces.

The procession might pause for allegorical figures to address it, or pass beside a [[family tree|genealogical tree]] or under a temporary classical-style [[triumphal arch]] with either painted figures or posed actors perching on it, standing in for statuary in the case of arches. Still more elaborate entertainments began to be staged during or after the civic feast, and by the mid-17th century these could be as spectacular as the staged naval battles, [[masque]]s, [[opera]]s and [[ballet]]s that courts staged for themselves.  The court now often had a major role in both designing and financing entries, which increasingly devoted themselves to the glorification of the [[absolute monarch]] as hero, and left the old emphasis on his obligations behind; "any lingering possibilities of its use as a vehicle for dialogue with the middle classes vanished".&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1984, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; At the third "triumph" at Valladolid  in 1509, a lion holding the city's coat-of-arms shattered at the King's arrival, revealing the royal arms: the significance could not have been lost, even on those unable to hear the accompanying declamation.&lt;ref&gt;Knighton and Morte García 1999:146&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 16th century, at dates differing widely by location, the [[tableau vivant]] was phased out and mostly replaced by painted or sculpted images, although many elements of street-theatre persisted, and small [[masque]]s or other displays became incorporated into the programmes.  The entry in 1514 of [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary Tudor]] to Paris, as Louis XII's new Queen, was the first French entry to have a single organizer; ten years before [[Anne of Brittany]]'s entry had been "largely medieval", with five stops for [[mystery play]]s in the streets.&lt;ref&gt;One Pierre Gringore, apparently appointed by the government. Baumgartner, Frederick J; ''Louis XII'', pp. 136 (Anne) and 240 (Mary), Alan Sutton Publishing Ltd, Stroud, 1994, {{ISBN|0-7509-0695-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Hundred Years' War]], the entry of the ten-year-old [[Henry VI of England]], to be crowned king of France in Paris, 2 December 1431, was marked with great pomp and heraldic propaganda. Outside the city he was welcomed by the mayor in a blue velvet ''[[houppelande]]'', his retinue in violet with scarlet caps, and representatives of the [[Parlement de Paris]] in red trimmed with fur. At the porte Saint-Denis the royal party were greeted with a grand achievement of the French arms that Henry claimed, gold [[Fleur de lis|fleurs de lis]] on an azure ground. The king was offered large red hearts, from which doves were released, and a rain of flowers pelted the procession. At the symbolic gateway, a [[canopy of estate]] embroidered with more gold lilies was erected over the young king, who was carried in a litter supported on six lances carried by men dressed in blue. Through the city there were welcoming pageants and allegorical performances: before the Church of the Innocents, a forest was erected, through which a captured stag was released and "hunted".&lt;ref&gt;The contemporary sources, including''The Chronicles of [[Enguerrand de Monstrelet]]'' (Thomas Johnes, tr., London 1810, vol. vii, p. 46ff) and the ''Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris'', are noted in the brief description in Walter Franz Schirmer, ''John Lydgate: a study in the culture of the XVth century'' 1979, p. 137; [[John Lydgate|Lydgate]] was called upon to provide texts for similar pageantry at home, such as the entry of Henry into London, 1434.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical influence===
[[File:Triunphus Caesaris plate 9 - Andreani.jpg|left|thumb|Later woodcut after [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], with hand-colouring, showing the culmination of the [[Triumphs of Caesar]].]]
Educated folk of the Middle Ages had close at hand an example of an allegorical series of entries at a wedding, in the frame story that opens [[Martianus Capella]]'s encyclopedic introduction to all one needed to know of the arts, ''On the Wedding of Philology and Mercury and of the Seven Liberal Arts.''  With the revival of Classical learning, Italian entries&lt;ref&gt;The bibliography of Italian Renaissance ''entrate'' is Bonner Mitchell, ''Italian Civic Pageantry of the High Renaissance: A Descriptive Bibliography of Triumphal Entries and Selected Other Festivals for State Occasions'' (Florence) 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; became influenced by literary descriptions of the [[Roman triumph]]. [[Livy]]'s account was supplemented by detailed descriptions in [[Suetonius]] and [[Cassius Dio]] of Nero's Greek Triumph,&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Nero'' 25; Cassius Dio lxiii.20.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Josephus]] of the Triumph of Titus.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Jewish Wars'' vii. 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recherché sources were brought to bear; [[Aulus Gellius]]' ''Noctes Atticae'' furnished a detail that became part of the conventional symbolism: coronation with seven crowns. [[Boccaccio]]'s long poem ''Amorosa visione'' (1342–43), following the schema of a triumph, offered a parade of famous personages, both historical and legendary, that may have provided a model for [[Petrarch]], who elaborated upon Livy in an account of the triumph of [[Scipio Africanus]] and in his poem ''[[I Trionfi]]''.  [[Castruccio Castracani]] entered [[Lucca]] in 1326 riding in a chariot, with prisoners driven before him.  [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] entered [[Naples]] in 1443 seated on a triumphal car under a [[baldachin]], as is shown by a surviving [[bas-relief]]&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1984, p. 44 [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:NapoliMaschioAngioinoArcoLaurana3.jpg Picture of relief]&lt;/ref&gt; on the earliest, and still perhaps the most beautiful, permanent post-classical [[Triumphal arch]], which he built the same year.&lt;ref&gt;George L. Hersey, ''The Aragonese Arch at Naples, 1443–1475'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1973) summarises the scholarship on the Arch and reports eye-witness accounts of the Entry and pictorial illustrations.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Italian, specific meanings developed for ''trionfo'' as both the whole procession, and a particular car or cart decorated with a display or tableau; although these usages did not spread exactly to other languages, they lie behind terms such as "triumphal entry" and "triumphal procession".

The emphasis began to shift from the displays as static tableaux that were passed by a procession in festive but normal contemporary dress, to the displays' being incorporated in the procession itself, a feature also of the religious [[medieval pageant]]; the tableaux were mounted on ''carri'', the precursors of the float, and were now often accompanied by a costumed throng. The [[carnival]] parades of Florence that were refined to a high pitch in the late quattrocento set a high standard; they were not without a propaganda element at times, as in the lavish parades of Carnival 1513, following the not-universally welcomed return of the Medici the previous year; the theme of one pageant, more direct than subtle: ''The Return of the Golden Age''.&lt;ref&gt;Shearman 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; With the French invasions of Italy from 1494, this form of entry spread north. Cardinal Bibbiena reported in a letter of 1520 that the Duke of Suffolk had sent emissaries to Italy to buy horses and bring back to [[Henry VIII of England]] men who knew how to make festal decorations in the latest Italian manner.&lt;ref&gt;John Shearman, "The Florentine Entrata of Leo X, 1515" ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' '''38''' (1975:136–154) p. 136.  The arrival in England, via another route, of [[Artists of the Tudor court#The Tudor Serjeant Painters|"Antony Toto" and Bartlommeo Penni]] may have satisfied this need.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Piero della Francesca 047.jpg|thumb|right|[[Piero della Francesca]], 1472, [[Federico da Montefeltro]] and his wife in triumphal cars, hers drawn by [[unicorn]]s.]]

[[Holy Roman Emperor Charles V|Charles V]] was indulged in a series of Imperial ''entrate'' in Italian cities during the Habsburg consolidation after the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]], notably in Genoa, where Charles and his heir Philip made no less than five triumphal entries.&lt;ref&gt;In 1529, 1533, 1536, 1542 and 1548. (J. Jacquot, ed., ''Les fêtes de la Renaissance'' II: ''Fêtes et cérémonies au temps de Charles-Quint'', Paris 1960).&lt;/ref&gt; Impressive occasions like Charles V's Royal Entry into Messina in 1535 have left few concrete survivals,&lt;ref&gt;Sheila ffoliot&lt;!--ffoliot is correct--&gt; argues convincingly in ''Civic Sculpture in the Renaissance: Montorsoli's Fountains at Messina'' (Studies in Renaissance History, Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1984) that many features of [[Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli]]'s Fountain of Orion in Messina, which survives in much degraded condition, owe their origins to the programme for the Entry of 1535.&lt;/ref&gt;  but representations were still being painted on Sicilian wedding-carts in the 19th century.

After [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]'s great mural of the [[Triumphs of Caesar]] rapidly became known throughout Europe in numerous versions in [[old master print|print]] form, this became the standard source, from which details were frequently borrowed, not least by Habsburg rulers, who especially claimed the Imperial legacy of Rome.  Although Mantegna's elephants were difficult to copy,&lt;ref&gt;Oxen were disguised as elephants to draw one of the floats in the carnival parade given by Lorenzo di Piero de' Medici's fraternal company, the ''Broncone'', at Florence, 6 February 1513. (John Shearman, "Pontormo and Andrea Del Sarto, 1513" ''The Burlington Magazine'' '''104''' No. 716 [November 1962:450, 478-483] p. 478.).&lt;/ref&gt; chained captives, real or acting the part, were not, and elaborate triumphal carts, often pulled by "[[unicorn]]s" might replace the earlier canopy held over the prince on horseback.  The [[woodcut]]s and text of the ''[[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]]'' of 1499 were another well-known source, and Petrarch's ''I Trionfi'' was printed in many illustrated editions; both were works of mythological allegory, with no obvious political content.  Entries became displays of conspicuous learning, often with lengthy Latin addresses, and the entertainments became infused with matter from the abstruse worlds of Renaissance [[emblem]]s and [[hermeticism]], to which they were very well suited.  In the world of Renaissance [[Neo-Platonism]], the assertion and acting-out of the glory and power of the prince might actually bring it about.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1984:40–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

A precocious example of the Entrata with a consistent and unified allegorical theme was the Entry of [[Pope Leo X|Medici pope Leo X]] into Florence, November 1515.&lt;ref&gt;Singled out by André Chastel, "Le lieu de la fête", in J. Jacquot, ed. ''Fêtes de la Renaissance'' (Paris 1956, vol. I:420), and described at length by John Shearman, "The Florentine Entrata of Leo X, 1515" ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' '''38''' (1975:136–154), from whose account these details are drawn.&lt;/ref&gt; All the city's artistic resources were drawn upon to create this exemplary Entry, to a planned programme perhaps devised by the historian [[Jacopo Nardi]], as [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]] suggested; the Seven Virtues represented by seven triumphal arches at stations along the route, the seventh applied as a temporary façade to the [[Florence Cathedral|Duomo, Santa Maria del Fiore]], which still lacked a permanent one.

===Propaganda===
Apart from the permanent theme of the reciprocal bonds uniting ruler and ruled, in times of political tension the political messages in Entries became more pointed and emphatic.  A disputed succession would produce a greater stress on the theme of legitimacy.  After the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], tension became a permanent condition, and most Entries contained a sectarian element.  After about 1540 French entries and Habsburg ones in the [[Low Countries]]&lt;ref&gt;The bibliography is John Landwehr, ''Splendid Ceremonies: State Entries and Royal Funerals in the Low Countries, 1550–1791: A Bibliography'' (Leiden 1971).&lt;/ref&gt; were especially freighted with implication, as the rulers' attempts to suppress Protestantism brought Protestant and Catholic populations alike to the edge of ruin.  But initially this increased the scale of displays, whose message was now carefully controlled by the court.

This transformation happened much earlier in Italy than in the North, and a succession of entries for Spanish Viceroys to the blockaded city of [[Antwerp]], once the richest in Northern Europe and now in steep decline, were "used by the city fathers to combine increasingly eulogistic celebrations of their Habsburg rulers with tableaux to remind them of the commercial ruin over which they presided."&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1984, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Pompa Introitus'' of the [[Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand]] into Antwerp in 1635, devised by [[Gaspar Gevartius]] and carried out under the direction of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], was made unmistakably pointed, and included [http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/pageview.aspx?strFest=0152&amp;strPage=220 a representation] of the god of commerce, [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], flying away, as a lamenting figure representing Antwerp points at him and looks imploringly out at the Viceroy, whilst beside her lie a sleeping sailor and a river god, representing the wrecked trade of the city from the blockading of the river [[Scheldt]].  Eventually the Viceroy managed to obtain the lifting of the ban on trade with the [[Indies]] which the entry had represented as Antwerp's only hope of escaping ruin; but by then the Spanish had agreed to the permanent blockade of the river.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1984, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1638, the occasion of the French queen mother [[Marie de Medici|Marie de Medici's]] triumphal entry into [[Amsterdam]] lent ''de facto'' international recognition of the newly formed [[Dutch Republic]], though she actually traveled to the Netherlands as an exile. Spectacular displays and water pageants took place in the city's harbor; a procession was led by two mounted [[trumpeter]]s; a large temporary structure erected on an artificial island in the [[Amstel River]] was built especially for the festival.  This building was designed to display a series of dramatic [[tableau vivant|tableaux]] in tribute to her once she set foot on the floating island and entered its [[pavilion]]. The distinguished poet and classicist [[Caspar Barlaeus]] wrote the official descriptive booklet, ''Medicea Hospes, sive descriptio publicae gratulationis, qua ... Mariam de Medicis, excepit senatus populusque Amstelodamensis''.  Published by Willem Blaeu, it includes two large folding engraved views of the ceremonies.

===Peace and war===
Although the essence of an entry was that it was supposed to be a peaceful, festive occasion, very different from the taking of a town by assault, several entries actually followed military action by the town against their ruler, and were very tense affairs.  In 1507 the population of [[Genoa]] revolted against the French who had conquered them in 1499, and restored [[Republic of Genoa|their Republic]].  [[Louis XII of France]] defeated the Genoan army outside the city, which then agreed a capitulation, including an entry which was followed by the execution of the [[Doge]] and other leaders of the revolt.  The gestural content was rather different from a peaceful entry; Louis entered in full armour, holding a naked sword, which he struck against the portal as he entered the city, saying "Proud Genoa! I have won you with my sword in my hand".&lt;ref&gt;Baumgartner, Frederick J; ''Louis XII'', pp. 185–7, Alan Sutton Publishing Ltd, Stroud, 1994, {{ISBN|0-7509-0695-2}} He had sent a small force into the city two days before, and though large fines were levied, the city was not sacked.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles V entered [[Rome]] in splendour less than three years after his army had [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sacked the city]].  The famously troublesome citizens of [[Ghent]] revolted against [[Philip the Good]] [[Battle of Gavere|in 1453]] and Charles V [[Revolt of Ghent (1539)|in 1539]], after which Charles arrived with a large army and was greeted with an entry.  A few weeks later he dictated the programme of a deliberately humiliating anti-festival, with the burghers coming barefoot with nooses round their necks to beg forgiveness from him which, after imposing a huge fine, he consented to do.&lt;ref&gt;Wilenski:34–35&lt;/ref&gt;  The entries of Charles and his son Philip in 1549 were followed the next year by a ferocious anti-Protestant edict that began the repression that led to the [[Dutch Revolt|Revolt of the Netherlands]], in the course of which Antwerp was to suffer a [[Sack of Antwerp|terrible sack]] in 1576 and a [[Siege of Antwerp (1584–1585)|long siege]] in 1584–85, which finally ended all prosperity in the city.

===Decline===
[[File:Triumphal Arch in Gdansk.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Temporary [[triumphal arch]] in [[Gdańsk]] to celebrate the ceremonial entry of Queen [[Marie Louise Gonzaga]], 1646]]
During the 17th century the scale of entries began to decline.  There was a clear trend, led from [[Medici]] Florence, to transfer festivities involving the monarch into the private world of the court. The ''[[intermedio|intermezzi]]'' developed in Florence, the ''[[ballet de cour]]'' that spread from Paris, the English [[masque]], and even elaborate equestrian ballets all increased as entries declined.&lt;ref&gt;A major theme of Strong, 1984, summed up in pp. 171–3&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1628, when Marie de' Medici commissioned from Rubens a ''Triumphal Entry of Henri IV into Paris'', it was for a suite of grand decorations for her own palace,  [[Palais du Luxembourg|the Luxembourg]]; Rubens did not recreate historic details of the 1594 Royal Entry, but overleapt them to render the allegory itself (''illustration'').

The cultural atmosphere of Protestantism was less favourable to the Royal Entry. In the new Dutch Republic entries ceased altogether.  In England, part of the [[Accession Day tilt|Accession Day festivities]] in 1588, following the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] were especially joyous and solemn. Delaying the event a week to 24 November, Elizabeth rode in triumph, "imitating the ancient Romans" from her [[palace of Whitehall]] in the [[city of Westminster]] to enter the [[city of London]] at [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]]. She rode in a chariot
&lt;blockquote&gt;"made with four pillars behind, to have a canopie, on the top whereof was made a crowne imperiall, and two lower pillars before. whereon stood a [[Lion and Unicorn|lyon and a dragon]], supporters of the armes of England, drawn by two white horses"&lt;ref&gt;The quote and the description are from Roy C. Strong, "The Popular Celebration of the Accession Day of Queen Elizabeth I" ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' '''21'''.1/2 (January 1958:86–103) pp92f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] followed the triumphal car, leading the caparisoned and riderless horse of estate, followed by the ladies of honour. The windows of houses along the procession route up the [[Strand, London|Strand]] were hung with blue cloth. At Temple Bar, the official gate to the City, there was music and the Lord Mayor handed over the mace and received it again. In a "closet" constructed for the occasion, the Queen heard a festive service celebrated by fifty clergymen at [[St. Paul's Cathedral]] and returned in a torchlit procession in the evening.

Nevertheless, the entry of James I into London in 1604 was the last until the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of his grandson in 1660, after the [[English Civil War]].  The court of Charles I intensified the scale of private [[masque]]s and other entertainments, but the cities, increasingly at odds with the monarchy, would no longer play along.  The [[Duchy of Lorraine]], a great centre of all festivities, was swallowed up in the [[Thirty Years War]], which left much of Northern and Central Europe in no mood or condition for celebrations on the old scale.  In France the concentration of power in royal hands, begun by [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]], left city elites distrustful of the monarchy, and once Louis XIV succeeded to the throne, royal progresses stopped completely for over fifty years; in their place Louis staged his elaborate court [[fête]]s, redolent of cultural propaganda, which were memorialised in sumptupously illustrated volumes that the ''Cabinet du Roi'' placed in all the right hands.
[[File:GeorgeIVDublin.jpg|thumb|310px|Triumphal Entry of [[George IV of the United Kingdom]] into [[Dublin]], 1821, with temporary arch]]
Changes in the intellectual climate meant the old allegories no longer resonated with the population.  The assassinations of both [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] and [[Henry IV of France]], of [[William the Silent]] and other prominent figures, and the spread of guns, made rulers more cautious about appearing in slow-moving processions planned and publicised long in advance; at grand occasions for fireworks and illuminations, rulers now characteristically did no more than show themselves at a ceremonial window or balcony.  The visit of [[Louis XVI]] to inspect the naval harbour works at [[Cherbourg]] in 1786 seems, amazingly, to have been the first French entry of a King designed as a public event since the early years of Louis XIV well over a century before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Simon Schama|Schama, Simon]] | title=[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]] | page=57| location=New York | publisher=Alfred A. Knopf | year=1989 | isbn=0-394-55948-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though considered a great success, this was certainly too little and too late to avoid the catastrophe awaiting the French monarchy.

Ideologues of the [[French Revolution]] took the semi-private fête of the former court and made it public once more, in events like the ''[[Fête de la Raison]]''. Under Napoleon, the [[Treaty of Tolentino]] (1797) requisitioned from the Papacy a mass of works of art, including most of the famous sculptures of Roman antiquity in the Vatican. A Joyous Entry under the name of a fête was arranged for the arrival of the cultural loot in Paris, the carefully prepared ''Fête de la Liberté'' of 1798. With the increased sense of public security of the 19th century, Entries became grander again, on such occasions as the [[Visit of King George IV to Scotland]], where medieval revivalism makes its first appearance, along with much [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] romanticism, Queen Victoria's visits to Dublin and elsewhere, or the three [[Delhi Durbar]]s. On these occasions, though ceremonial acts remained meaningful, overt allegories never regained the old prominence, and the decorations receded into festive, but simply decorative affairs of flags, flowers and [[bunting (textile)|bunting]], the last remnant of the medieval show of rich textiles along the processional route.

Today, though many [[parade]]s and [[procession]]s have quite separate, independent origins, civic or republican equivalents of the Entry continue. They include [[Victory parade]]s, New York's traditional [[ticker-tape parade]]s and the [[Lord Mayor's Show]] in London, dating back to 1215 and still preserving the Renaissance car, or [[Float (parade)|float]] model. It is not frivolous to add that the specific occasion of the contemporary American [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade|Thanksgiving Day Parade]] or the [[Santa Claus parade]] is the triumphal entry into the city of [[Santa Claus]] in his sleigh.

===Artists===
[[File:HenriIIbetweenFrance&amp;Fame.jpg|thumb|240px|left|''[[Henry II of France]] between France and Fame'', [[engraving]] by [[Jean Duvet]],  may reflect a tableau from an occasion such as his Entry into Paris, 16 June 1549.]]
To the occasional irritation of modern [[art historian]]s, many of the great artists of the time spent a good deal of time on the ephemeral decorations for entries and other festivities, including [[Jan van Eyck]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]], [[Andrea del Sarto]], [[Perino del Vaga]],&lt;ref&gt;His frescoes for [[Villa del Principe]], executed in expectation of Charles V's ''entrata'' of 1533, bear witness to the vanished theme of the event: Neptune and the defeat of the Giants.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polidoro da Caravaggio]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]]  and [[Rubens]].  For some court artists, such as [[Inigo Jones]] or [[Jacques Bellange]], it seems to have been their major occupation, and both [[Giulio Romano]] and [[Giorgio Vasari]] were very heavily engaged in such work.  Composers from [[Lassus]] and [[Monteverdi]] to [[John Dowland]], and writers such as [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]], [[Ronsard]], [[Ben Jonson]] and [[John Dryden|Dryden]] also contributed.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1983, p. 6 for most of these.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shakespeare]] does not seem to have written anything for such an occasion, but with Jonson he was one of a group of twenty gentlemen processing in ''The Magnificent Entertainment'', as the published record called the first entry of [[James I of England]] into London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0238 Festival Book]&lt;/ref&gt;

Art historians also detect the influence of the tableau in many paintings, especially in the late Middle Ages, before artists had trained themselves to be able to develop new compositions readily.&lt;ref&gt;Many of the best known examples, like the [[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)]] or the large ''Virgin of Einsiedeln'' by [[Master E.S]] relate to tableaus not from entries, but engravings by [[Jean Duvet]], who worked on at least two royal entries, may well do.&lt;/ref&gt;   In the Renaissance, artists were often imported from other cities to help with, or supervise, the works, and entries probably helped the dissemination of styles.

===Festival books===
A [[festival book]] is an account of festivities such as entries, of which there are many hundreds, often surviving in very few copies.  Originally manuscripts, often illustrated, compiled for prince or city, with the arrival of print they were frequently published, varying in form from short pamphlets describing the order of events, and perhaps recording speeches, to lavish books illustrated with [[woodcut]]s or [[engraving]]s showing the various tableaux, often including a fold-out panorama of the procession, curling to and fro across the page. The pamphlets were ephemera themselves; a printed description of two leaves describing the entry of Ferdinand into Valladolid, 1513, survives in a single copy (at Harvard) because it was bound with another text. A lost description of the ceremonious reception given by Louis XII to Ferdinand at Savona (June 1507) is only known from a purchase receipt of [[Ferdinand Columbus]].&lt;ref&gt;Knighton and Morte Garcia 1999:120f.&lt;/ref&gt;

These ''livrets'' are not always to be trusted as literal records; some were compiled beforehand from the plans, and others after the event from fading memories. The authors or artists engaged in producing the books had by no means always seen the entry themselves.  Roy Strong finds that they are "an idealization of an event, often quite distant from its reality as experienced by the average onlooker. One of the objects of such publications was to reinforce by means of word and image the central ideas that motivated those who conceived the programme."&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1984:47.&lt;/ref&gt;    One Habsburg entry was all but called off because of torrential rain, but the book shows it as it should have been.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip II into Antwerp in 1549 [http://www.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/habsburg.html British Library]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]], the playwright and author of the book on ''The Magnificent Entertainment'' for James I is refreshingly frank:
:''Reader, you must understand, that a regard, being had&lt;!--comma here instead?--&gt; that his Majestie should not be wearied with teadious speeches; A great part of those which are in this Booke set downe, were left unspoken; So that thou doest here receive them as they should have been delivered, not as they were.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/pageview.aspx?strFest=0238&amp;strPage=69 British Library online book]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ehrenpforte.kol.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of top (about 1/10 of the height) of the ''Triumphal Arch'' of Maximilian, coloured [[woodcut]], overall design by [[Albrecht Dürer]].]]
The [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor, Maximilian I]], went a step further, creating enormous virtual triumphs that existed solely in the form of print. The ''[[Triumphs of Maximilian]]'' (begun in 1512 and unfinished at Maximilian's death in 1519) contains over 130 large woodcuts by Dürer and other artists, showing a huge procession (still in open country) culminating in the Emperor himself, mounted on a huge car.  ''[[The Triumphal Arch]]'' (1515), the largest print ever made, at 3.57 x 2.95 metres when the 192 sheets are assembled, was produced in an edition of seven hundred copies for distribution to friendly cities and princes. It was intended to be hand-coloured and then pasted to a wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aic.stanford.edu/sg/bpg/annual/v14/bp14-07.html The American Institute for Conservation]; Figure 9 (and many later ones) show the Triumphal Car of Maximilian, and Figure 10 is the first appearance of the Arch&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditional tableau themes, including a large genealogy, and many figures of Virtues, are complemented by scenes of Maximilian's life and military victories.&lt;ref&gt;For all on Dürer's involvement: Giulia Bartrum, ''Albrecht Dürer and his Legacy'', (British Museum Press), 2002:194–7, {{ISBN|0-7141-2633-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Maximilian was wary of entries in person, having been locked up by his loyal subjects in [[Bruges]] in 1488 for eleven weeks, until he could pay the bills from his stay.&lt;ref&gt;A move the burghers were to regret when his son Charles V later took family revenge with an especially tough siege&lt;/ref&gt;

An early meeting between the festival book with travel literature is the [http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0097 account] of the visit in 1530 of the future [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]], then [[King of Hungary]] and [[Bohemia]] to [[Constantinople]].

===New World entries===
In Habsburg territories in the New World, the ''entradas'' of the [[Viceroy of Mexico]] were celebrated at his landing at [[Veracruz]] and at [[Mexico City]]; on the way, the ceremonial entry at the "second city", [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla de los Ángeles]], which were presented as late as 1696, served to promote an elite that self-identified strongly with Spain, and incurred expenses, which were borrowed from the ecclesiastic ''[[Cabildo (council)|cabildo]]'', that exceeded the annual income of the city. Printed commemorative pamphlets spelled out in detail the elaborately artificial allegories and hieroglyphic emblems&lt;ref&gt;Emblems were especially drawn from the much-reprinted and translated standard [[emblem book]]s of [[Andrea Alciati]] and [[Cesare Ripa]], which engendered a considerable Spanish emblem literature during the seventeenth century.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Entry, often drawn from astrology, in which the Viceroy would illuminate the city as the sun. In the 18th century, the Bourbon transformation of ''entrées'' into semi-private ''fêtes'' extended to Spanish Mexico: "While the event continued to be extravagant under Bourbon rule, it became more privatized and took place to a larger degree indoors, losing its street theater flavor and urban processional character."&lt;ref&gt;Nancy H. Fee, "La Entrada Angelopolitana: Ritual and Myth in the Viceregal Entry in Puebla de Los Angeles" ''The Americas'' '''52'''.3 (January 1996), pp. 283–320.&lt;/ref&gt;

*1356: the [[Joyous Entry]] into [[Brussels]], by [[Joanna, Duchess of Brabant|Joanna]] and her husband [[Wenceslaus I, Duke of Luxembourg]], upon her becoming Duchess of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]].  "Joyous Entry" is a common term for French or [[Netherlandish]] entries.  This one is famous because the [[Charter]] granted by the ruler to the Duchy came to assume a position in the history of the Low countries similar to that of the [[Magna Carta]] in England.
*1431: [[Henry VI of England]] returned to London after being crowned [[King of France]] in [[Paris]], then occupied by the English, and the arms of both crowns were prominently displayed.  Henry, then aged fifteen, was encountered by the "empresses" of "Nature, Grace and Fortune" who destowed various virtues and talents upon, then by fourteen maidens, representing the [[Seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit]] and a further set.  After further tableaux, at [[Cheapside]] a fountain ran with wine (a particular speciality of London festivities) and large tableaux represented the genealogy of the King, and a complementary [[Tree of Jesse]] showing that of Christ. The finale was a huge tableau of Heaven, where God the Father, surrounded by saints and angels, addressed the King.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1984, pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;
*1443: [[Alfonso V of Aragon]]'s triumphal entry into Naples was "the earliest of the triumphal entries ''all'antica'' in Europe"&lt;ref&gt;Knighton and Morte García 1999:124, referencing C.

The event, portraying Alfonso as a classical hero of Antiquity, set iconographic examples for his nephew in the Royal entries of Ferdinand of Aragon.

*1515: The triumphal entry of the [[Pope Leo X|Medici Pope Leo X]] into Florence is one of the most thoroughly documented entries, both in official records and private journals— though the visual and musical components are lost— and has attracted a separate monograph, by Ilaria Ciseri.&lt;ref&gt;Ilaria Ciseri, ''L'ingresso trionfale di Leone X in Firenze nel 1515'' (Biblioteca Storica Toscana (Florence: Olschki) 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced on a princely scale, catching Leo at the peak of his reputation, en route to a meeting at Bologna with François I, at the head of temporarily victorious forces. Ciseri identifies two likely candidates for the allegorical programme, Jacopo Nardi and Marcello Virgilio Adriani, and a theme that offered parallel evocations of Imperial Rome the heavenly Jerusalem. The unfinished façade of the Duomo was temporarily "completed" in "[[chiaroscuro]]" ([[grisaille]]) canvases of feigned architecture and sculpture by [[Andrea del Sarto]] to designs by [[Jacopo Sansovino]].&lt;ref&gt;Shearman 1962:480&lt;/ref&gt;

Both speeches and tableaus depicted her as saviour of the Protestant faith, a new [[Deborah]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0231 Festival Book]&lt;/ref&gt;  A 1578 entry into [[Norwich]] is [http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0232 almost homely]; the master of the [[grammar school]] being apparently the only townsman whose Latin was fit to put before the Queen, he catches her up and orates at several points.
*1571: The separate Entries of [[Charles IX of France]] and his new Habsburg queen, [[Elisabeth of Austria (1554–1592)|Elizabeth of Austria]], into Paris, 6 March and 29, were recorded in a book of woodcuts with text, Simon Bouquet's ''Bref et sommaire receuil...'', published in July. Bouquet, an alderman of Paris, was responsible for coordinating the details. Poets [[Jean Dorat]] and [[Pierre Ronsard]] drew up the iconographic program, and [[Germain Pilon]] executed temporary allegorical sculpture, and [[Niccolo dell'Abate]] provided paintings. The main theme was the inauguration of a new era of peace: Charles' personal motto, ''Piety and Justice'' furnished the allegory presented at one of the cortege's stops. A little over a year later the [[Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre]]s inaugurated a new phase of the wars.&lt;ref name="Victor E 1975"/&gt;
*1574: The new King [[Henry III of France]] on his way back from his brief period as [[King of Poland]] was given an exceptionally grand Entry to [[Venice]], which rarely had the opportunity of welcoming a friendly monarch, though it had its own very lavish round of festivities. This was a "State Visit" with no element of accepting fealty.  Tintoretto and Veronese collaborated in painting an arch designed by [[Palladio]], and for the banquet for 3,000 in the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]], statuettes in [[sugar]] designed by Jacopo Sansovino decorated the tables.&lt;ref&gt;R.H. Wilenski, ''Dutch Painting'', 1945:28f, Faber, London&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;[http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0035 Book]&lt;/small&gt;
*1583: The [[French Fury]] was a disastrously unsuccessful attempt by [[François, Duke of Anjou]] to use the excuse of an entry to take [[Antwerp]] – the citizens were forewarned and attacked the army as it marched through the streets, sending it running.  They had already been sacked in the [[Sack of Antwerp|Spanish Fury]] in 1576, with the sack of Rome in 1527, among the most notorious anti-entries of the period.
*1589: The triumphal entry of [[Christina of Lorraine]] at Florence and her wedding procession with [[Ferdinand I de' Medici]], complete with ephemeral triumphal arches, included — interspersed with public shows, a game of ''[[Football in Italy|calcio]]'', animal-baiting, a staged [[jousting|joust]] in Piazza Santa Croce — semi-private court events, the musical ''[[intermedio|intermedi]]'' that were presented in the newly redesigned theatre in the [[Uffizi]]; these elaborately costumed and staged allegorical ''tableaux'' with complex allegories mark a stage in the development of court pageantry and the [[masque]], as well as in the pre-history of [[opera]].&lt;ref&gt;See James W. Saslow, ''The Medici Wedding of 1589: Florentine Festival as Theatrum Mundi'' ((New Haven:Yale University Press) 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;
*1598: For the triumphal entry of [[Pope Clement VIII]] into Ferrara, where the principal [[House of Este|Este]] line had failed and the Pope had declared the fief to have reverted to the Papal States, the occasion urgently required splendidly presented and concrete allegorical propaganda, in order to justify the new situation to the Ferrarese. Once ensconced, Clement was host to a series of dukes and ambassadors honoured with princely entries themselves, climaxed with the betrothals by proxy of [[Margaret of Austria, Queen of Spain|Margaret of Austria]] and [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Archduke Albert of Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;See Bonner Mitchell,  ''1598. A Year of Pageantry in Late Renaissance Ferrara'' (Binghamton: Medieval Texts and Studies) 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;
*1648: The "[[Joyous Entry]]" of [[Archduke Leopold William of Austria]] into Antwerp was also coordinated by Gevartius, who devised its iconography and published his own description. Rather than three-dimensional arches and tableaux, the allegories were rendered in two dimensions on strategically placed screens.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Vlieghe, "The Decorations for Archduke Leopold William's State Entry into Antwerp" ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' '''39''' (1976:190–198).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Silpathorn Award''', {{lang-th|รางวัลศิลปาธร}}, is an honour for living [[Thailand|Thai]] [[contemporary art]]ists presented annually by the Office of Contemporary Art and Culture, [[Ministry of Culture]] of [[Thailand]]. The awards were established in 2004 to promote Thai contemporary artists who are considered to be in their mid-career and who have already made notable contributions to Thai fine arts and culture.&lt;ref name = "ThaiIndie"&gt;{{cite web | title = Thunska Pansittivorakul received the Silpathorn award 2007  | publisher = ThaiIndie.com  | url = http://thaiindie.com/wizContent.asp?wizConID=460&amp;txtmMenu_ID=7  | accessdate = 2007-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists are honored in the fields of [[visual arts]], [[literature]], [[music]], [[film]], [[performing arts]], [[design]] and [[architecture]].&lt;ref name = "Seven"&gt;{{cite web | title = National treasures: Seven contemporary artists are recognised at this year's Silpathorn Awards  | publisher = The Nation (Thailand) | date = 2007-08-05 | url = http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/08/05/lifestyle/lifestyle_30043734.php  | accessdate = 2007-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="National"&gt;{{cite web | last = Phataranawanik | first = Phatarawadee | title = National treasures | publisher = Daily Xpress | date = 2008-08-06 | url = http://www.dailyxpress.net/2008/08/06/entertainment/entertainment_3922.php | accessdate = 2008-08-08 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120723085007/http://www.dailyxpress.net/2008/08/06/entertainment/entertainment_3922.php | archivedate = 2012-07-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Education and promotion of fine arts in the Kingdom of Thailand was under the auspices of the [[Department of Fine Arts (Thailand)|Department of Fine Arts]] of the Ministry of Palace Affairs. In 1943, the department's schools became [[Silpakorn University]], founded by [[Silpa Bhirasri]], an [[Italy|Italian]] sculptor who was named Corrado Feroci, but became a Thai citizen during World War II and is considered the father of fine arts in Thailand.&lt;ref name = "AsiaWeek"&gt;{{cite web | last = Gearing | first = Julian | title = Painted into a corner  | publisher = AsiaWeek | date = 1998-10-02 | url = http://www.asiaweek.com/asiaweek/98/1002/feat3.html  | accessdate = 2007-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Other offices promoting fine arts included the Office of the National Culture Commission and the Religious Affairs Department.

In 1985, the Office of the National Culture Commission established the [[Thailand National Artist]] designation, which is conferred on notable Thai artists as a [[award|lifetime achievement award]].

The Office of Contemporary Art and Culture (OCAC), under the Ministry of Culture, was formed in 2001 and was tasked with supporting, and promoting [[contemporary art]] and culture. While the National Artist programme has been generally aimed at veteran artists, especially those in the areas of Thai traditional arts, the OCAC recognised that younger artists needed support, promotion and recognition as well.&lt;ref name = "ThaiIndie"/&gt; In 2004, the Silpathorn Award was created, with honorees in the fields of visual art, literature, music, film and performing arts. In 2008, an award for the field of design was added.&lt;ref name = "National"/&gt;

===Qualifications===
Silpathorn Award honorees must meet the following qualifications:
*Thai nationals.
*Between the ages 30 to 50 years and still alive on the announcement day.
*Their works have continually been exposed to the general public until present.
*Their works have been released in Thailand and have made a great impact on Thai contemporary art and inspired young artists.&lt;ref name = "ThaiIndie"/&gt;

===Silpathorn Kitikhun award===
In 2008, a Distinguished ("Kitikhun") category was created for senior artists over 50 years of age who, because of controversy or unconventional works, would likely never be considered for the more conservative [[Thailand National Artist]] honor.&lt;ref name = "National"/&gt;  At first this category was known in English as the "Honorary" category, but the translation was changed to "Distinguished" at the time the awards were actually given.  This is because it was felt that in English an "honorary" award might be considered to be less "real" whereas the intent of the committee was to create a senior grade of the award.

===Definition of Silpathorn===
Silpathorn in [[Thai language]] is a combination of two words: "Silpa", meaning "Art", and "Thorn" (or "Torn"), meaning "the Upholder", thus Silpathorn means "Upholder of Art".&lt;ref name = "ThaiIndie"/&gt;

===Silpathorn brooch, cash prize===
The Silpathorn Award is in the form of a [[brooch]], modeled on the emblem of the Office of Contemporary Art and Culture, and made of white and yellow gold and decorated with diamonds and emeralds. There is also a cash prize, which {{As of|2007|lc=on}} was 100,000 [[Thai baht|baht]].&lt;ref name = "Seven"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1341">La '''Sirena chilota''' is an aquatic creature belonging to the [[Chilote mythology]]. Perhaps its origin is due to binding of the myths of the [[Sumpall]] of the [[Mapuche mythology]] and the [[Mermaid]] of [[European mythology]]. Like to the mermaids, the siren chilota is characterized by a body half fish and half woman, with blond hair and golden scales; and her human side would look like a very beautiful teen. She would be the youngest daughter of [[Millalobo]] (king of sea, in chilote mythology) and the human [[Huenchula]]. Commissioned by her father, she has the task of caring for all fish. Also helps her siblings (the [[Pincoya]] and [[Pincoy]]) to carry the bodies of drowned sailors, toward the [[Caleuche]], for the purpose of reviving the sailors and to be happy. Sirena Chilota have very large flukes and strong tails so they can swim long distances while carrying victims of tragedies. It is also said that a Sirena Chilota's tears are very delicate and, if used in a spell, is very powerful.

'''''St Mary Magdalene Reading''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter [[Piero di Cosimo]]. It is housed in the [[Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica]] of [[Palazzo Barberini]], [[Rome]]. 

==Description==
The work depicts [[Mary Magdalene]] at a window-like table, reading a bible. On the shelf is a bottle of unguent. She is dressed in a contemporary multicolor gown and cape; she is distinguished by her long curled hair draping over her shoulders. She wears a ring of pearls in her hair. Around her hair a filigree of a halo. On the sill is the painter's signature. The use of shadows to give dimension to the face, and the settled pose of the Magdalen, identify the work as emerging from Piero di Cosimo's late works, influence by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://galleriabarberini.beniculturali.it/index.php?it/141/piero-di-cosimo-santa-maria-maddalena Entry at Galleria Nazionale].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''São João Theatre''' ({{lang-pt|Teatro São João}}), commonly referred to as the ''São João National Theatre'' is a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[theatre]] and concert venue in [[Freguesia (Portugal)|civil parish]] of [[Cedofeita, Santo Ildefonso, Sé, Miragaia, São Nicolau e Vitória]], in the [[Concelho|municipality]] of [[Porto]], in [[Norte Region, Portugal|northern]] [[Portugal]].

==History==
[[File:Porto, Domingos Alvão 69 (9289454039).jpg|thumb|left|The remnants of the simple facades of the theatre as they appeared following the fire that gutted the entire building]]
[[File:Teatro Nacional de S. Joao - GazetaCF 1115 1934.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Teatro São João'' as it appeared in 1934]]
[[File:Porto Teatro de Sao Joao 2.JPG|thumb|left|The typical view of the theatre in the 20th century]]
[[File:Teatro de São João 2.jpg|thumb|left|An idyllic view of the theatre and square]]
The primitive theatre was constructed at the end of the 18th century (1796) by Italian [[Vicente Mazzoneschi]], and inaugurated on 13 May 1798, as the ''Teatro do Príncipe'' (''Prince's Theatre'').&lt;ref name="SIPA"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=5524 |title=Teatro de São João (IPA.00005524/PT011312140059) |publisher=SIPA – Sistema de Informação para o Património Arquitectónico |editor=SIPA |location=Lisbon, Portugal |language=Portuguese |first=Isabel |last=Sereno |first2=João |last2=Santos |year=1994 |accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named in honour of the prince-regent [[John VI of Portugal|John VI]], who later became King. The construction firm of Francisco de Almada Mendonça was charged with the project, and produced a four-story building with its principal facade decorated with the royal coat-of-arms under an inscription.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

But, on 11 April 1908, there was a fire, destroying the theatre interior, and a new structure was built on its former site.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Before its destruction, the theatre had a markedly horseshoe-shaped plan. Its rounded ceiling was painted by Joaquim Rafael and had in 1856 received a new painting by Paulo Pizzi.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The building included four rows of booths, with the booth for the royal family located centrally on the second floor.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The large atrium, and the corridors large supported by access from large staircases.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Along the second floor was a magnificent concert hall.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Generally, the theatre had excellent acoustics.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The stage wall was painted by Sequeira, but was later replaced in 1825 by paintings contracted to the Spaniard João Rodrigues, and later, Palucci. Until 1838, the theatre was lit by tallow candles, and later by similar candles lit by oil.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

On 11 April 1908, the Civil Governor nominated a commission to promote the construction of a new theatre.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; 

A competition opened on October 8, presided by engineer [[Basílio Alberto de Sousa Pinto]], [[Xavier Esteves]], [[Casimiro Jerónimo de Faria]], architect [[José Marques da Silva]] and the director of public works, Isidro de Campos, whom immediately denounced the conditions of the tender. A new competition was announced a week later, based on slight alterations to the original provisions.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Preliminary project proposals were accepted on 22 February 1910.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; It was Marques da Silva who obtained the first prize and [[João de Moura Coutinho de Almeida d'Eça]], the runner-up. Before the competition was held, the winning project was designated to Moura Coutinho, then director of the ''Direcção das Obras Públicas'' (''Directorate of Public Works'') in Braga.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The winning project was approved on 6 May, during a municipal session, with the work awarded to the company Soconstroi.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; 

Work began in 1911 under the direction of Porto architect José Marques da Silva. The inner, horseshoe-shaped concert hall included a ceiling painted by the artists José de Brito and Acácio Lino, while the entrance hall was decorated with sculptural work by [[Henrique Araújo Moreira]], [[Diogo de Macedo]] and [[José Fernandes de Sousa Caldas]]. On the main facade, of sober design, are four reliefs representing four feelings: ''[[Kindness]]'', ''[[Suffering|Pain]]'', ''[[Hatred]]'' and ''[[Love]]'', created by Diogo de Macedo and Sousa Caldas. The building was complete in 1918. Its inauguration was held on 7 March 1920, with the presentation of [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s [[Aida]].&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

A projection area was constructed in 1932, and the theatre began to operate a cinema, then designated ''São João Cine''.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

On 26 February 1982, the building was designated a ''Imóvel de Interesse Público'' (''Property of Public Interest''), under Decree 28/82 (Diário da República, Série 1, 47).&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

In 1992, the theatre was acquired by the State from the family of Pinto da Costa.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; At that time, the work on the installation of security features and public services were undertaken on site.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; These were elaborated the following year with upgrades to dressing rooms, the stage, washrooms and remodelling of the electrical systems, which included the installation of an electrical generator.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

Two years later (23 November) a proposal was issued by the DRPorto, to reclassify the Theatre as a Portuguese National Monument.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Following a period of remodelling, the theatre began to function regularly, under the designation the ''Teatro Nacional de São João'' (''São João National Theatre'').&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; In addition to general cleaning, the work included the consolidation and restoration of the exterior facades, recuperation of the decorative sculptures, treatment of surfaces in pigmented mortar and the installation of new woods and iron.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; 

During the course of this transition, attempts to reclassify the institution continued; on 22 April 1996, a dispatch by the Vice-President of IPPAR, devolved to the DRPorto its proposal for reformulation.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; On 12 September 2005, a new proposal was issued by that entity.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; This new proposal was favourably accepted by the deliberative council of [[IGESPAR]] (the successor to IPPAR), which also proposed that no special protection area should be needed, owing to the sites inclusion with the broader Historical Zone of Porto (an area already designated).&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The process was ratified by the ''Secretário de Estado da Cultura'' (Secretary of State for Culture'')'' on 14 October 2010.&lt;ref name="SIPA" /&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:Porto Teatro de Sao Joao.JPG|thumb|The main entranceway along the narrower facades, with three porticos, doorways and Neoclassical pilasters]]
[[File:64386 10150619590304143 1932033358 n (7874717548).jpg|thumb|The pediment of the lateral facades]] 
The theatre is centrally located in Porto, occupying a complete block, in front of the ''Praça da Batalha'', between the ''Rua de Augusto Rosa'' (on its left) and the ''Travessa do Cativ'' (on its right), with the ''Rua do Cativo'' to the rear.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

The rectangular plan is covered in tile roofing, with its principal facade found on one of the two smaller sides, framed laterally by rustic cornerstones and accentuated by capricious urns and garlands.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The "noble floor" with three arches on steeped pilasters is inscribed under columns with broad shafts and Ionian capitals, while the doors of the lodges are topped by interrupted pediments.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

Three loggias exist on extended balconies, over sills in the thickness of the walls and interconnected by a balcony running on 4 strong consoles in the same alignment as the ordering columns.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The arches have a shutter in support and transition to the entablature, which opens a frieze corresponding to a mezzanine of three openings and bas-reliefs alluding to the human passions ("Pain", "Hate", "Kindness" and "Love"), subtitled on the architrave.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Above, the denticulated cord ends at the frieze and the beginning of a strong cornice based on rebound corbels, which are dense, in a repetitive rhythm that runs throughout the building.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Crowning the facade is the gable, rising over a high platform, with rhythmic fenestration and formal, ornamented balustrades. The lateral facades are symmetrical.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; On the ground floor, there are 3 arched doorways (topped by a running balcony and supported by 4 consoles), flanked by 2 small doors, with an interrupted curvilinear pediment.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Here, 3 doors (that are repeated in the two successive upper floors) with balconies and sills, are interspersed between four, embedded Ionic pilasters.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The set is flanked by strong masks, on intermediate floor, on which a window opens at the top, with small gap at the bottom.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Corresponding to the stage area, there are high, open slits; in this area, the body of the theatre rises above the entablature, accompanying the broken forms or gables, underlined by the frame and ornamental strip.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; 

===Interior===
On the ground floor, the vestibule occupies the whole width of the building, with access through the 3 doors of the main facade and lateral entranceways.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; From this space you can access the corridors leading to the audience seating or, to the side, the stairs to the upper floors.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The avant-foyer and foyer are located on the first floor and occupy the entire width of the building, with two rooms for a restaurant and smoking room.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; With its double height, corresponding to the main hall and facade, the interior is profusely decorated along the windows and balustrades, with a wide oculus on the transition doors to the "avant-foyer".&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The two floors correspond to the first-order royal boxes, and, on the second floor, the second-order boxes.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The "avant-foyer" and "foyer" allow circulation with its balconies. On the last floors are the galleries and the amphitheater, forming a single group of places, but with different accesses (one at the level of the lower floors and another at the level of the highest).&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; On the first floor of the amphitheater is a storage room and a paint shop.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; From the ground floor, the stairs lead to the galleries and amphitheatres, by two direct, exterior entrances, along the lateral facades.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The layout of the horseshoe-shaped hall holds 1328 seats, including the 6 large boxes, with one at the height of the first floor, intended as an alternative to a royal box.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Between the audience and the stage is the orchestra pit, with independent entrances from the side facades.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The stage and dressing rooms have side and rear entrances, that can be divided by a metallic cloth.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

'''''The Attributes of Civilian Music''''' and '''''The Attributes of Military Music''''' are a pair of paintings by [[Jean Siméon Chardin]], commissioned in 1766 by [[Charles-Nicolas Cochin]] for the pediments above the doors to the music room in his Château de Bellevue at [[Meudon]] (Hauts-de-Seine). They were exhibited at the Salon in 1767 and installed in the Château the following year. The Château's goods were later confiscated by the state and the paintings were sold at auction. They were acquired by the portrait painter [[Jean-Sébastien Rouillard]], then by François Marcille and his son [[Eudoxe Marcille|Eudoxe]]. Via a gift from Eudoxe's descendents and from the Société des amis du Louvre, the [[Louvre Museum]] was able to purchase them in 2010.

'''The Red Room Company''' (also  Red Room Poetry) is a [[non-profit organisation]] based in [[Sydney, Australia]] whose vision is to make poetry a meaningful part of everyday life.&lt;ref name=red1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redroomcompany.org/about|title=About|accessdate=8 February 2018|publisher=The Red Room Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established by [[Johanna Featherstone]] in 2002, emerging from The Red Room Radio Show, which broadcast on [[Eastside Radio|89.7FM Eastside Radio]] from 2001.&lt;ref name=red1 /&gt;

Red Room Poetry creates poetic projects and learning programs in collaboration with a spectrum of poets, schools, communities and partners for positive social impact. Their mission is to make poetry accessible to all, especially those who face the greatest barriers to creative opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Red Room Company Website|url=http://redroomcompany.org|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poetic Learning==

Red Room Poetic Learning is The Red Room Company's poetry education program. It sends contemporary Australian poets into primary and secondary schools all across Australia. It was launched in 2007 with support from the Keir Foundation and the Ian Potter Foundation, initially piloting in four NSW high schools. In 2008 it expanded into Victoria and in 2009-2010 moved further interstate to Norfolk Island and Queensland schools. Red Room Poetic Learning is now a national program, servicing schools everywhere in Australia. Red Room Poetic Learning collaborates with students, teachers and communities to deepen their encounters with poetry. Our learning programs connect poets with students to unlock poetic ways of seeing, writing and responding. Red Room is committed to publishing these outcomes and providing a platform for young poets to share their work with wider audiences.

==Poetry Object==
[[File:The Poetry Object.jpeg|thumbnail|150px|A Croydon Public School student with her poetry object.]]
Red Room Poetry Object is a free poetry writing competition inviting young writers and their teachers to submit poems about special and curious objects. It is open to students in Years 3-10 and teachers from Australia and New Zealand. In 2017, Poetry Object published over 3400 student and teacher poems from over 190 school communities. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poetry Object|url=http://redroomcompany.org/projects/poetry-object|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Migrant and refugee students benefit from the opportunity to positively express their story through poetry. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/south-west/parkour-poet-tim-sinclair-and-red-room-company-inspire-students-at-canterbury-high-school/news-story/6dc04b3322a70ad3e097ac8d57ea1ce3 Retrieved 2017-09-04&lt;/ref&gt; 

As part of Red Room Poetry Object, each year six Australian poets have been commissioned to write new poems about their own talismanic objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Poetry Object Site|url=http://redroomcompany.org/projects/poetry-object/|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unlocked==
[[File:Unlocked logo.jpeg|thumbnail|left|Unlocked logo]]
Unlocked is an educational arts program developed and run by The Red Room Company in collaboration with educational staff from NSW Correctional Centres, which 'unlocks' the potential of inmates through poetry. The initiative's goal is to encourage self-expression and reflection while improving inmates' literacy. Introduced in Sydney in 2010, the project has entered its third year.

At correctional centres across NSW, Australian poets run intensive writing workshops, collaborating with students on every stage of the writing process: from the initial exercises and experimentations, through the editing and rewriting process, to recording, performing and publishing their work in a professionally designed print anthology.

The project was developed in collaboration with Corrections NSW Audiovisual Unit and education staff, 2SER's Jailbreak radio show, Blood &amp; Thunder Publishing Concern and Boccalatte.&lt;ref name="Unlocked site"&gt;{{cite web|title=Unlocked site|url=http://redroomcompany.org/projects/unlocked/|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Unlocked at Balund-a.jpeg|thumbnail|right|A participant at an Unlocked workshop in Balund-a]]
* '''Current Unlocked Projects''' 
The most recent Unlocked project was held at the Balund-a Project, a residential diversionary programme for male and female offenders between 18 and 40. Indigenous poet [[Lionel Fogarty]] led the workshops, and the students responded with great enthusiasm to Lionel's work and stories. There was a particular interest in Lionel's use of language, his mixing of English and Bandjalang dialect.&lt;ref name="Unlocked site"/&gt;

In October 2012 Red Room Company poets Lionel Fogarty and Nick Bryant-Smith will travel to South Coast Correctional Centre to run an intensive, three-day workshop.

* '''Project Outcomes''' 
According to The Red Room Company, Unlocked offers a range of potential outcomes and benefits for the students involved. Through Unlocked, poets work with both with the vocational education providers working in NSW Correctional Centres, as well as education providers such as ACE Community Colleges, an  Adult Education provider and Registered Training Organisation which runs accredited courses in the Balund-a Project.

At the completion of each project, a limited-edition anthology of work created during the project is published. These publications are made available to inmates who participated in workshops, and is distributed among libraries in correctional centres around Australia.

Through Unlocked, students can return to their community with recognised qualifications, as a part of the study that they have completed inside. In this way the value of the project is not only supporting students to come to terms with emotions, past experiences or relationships, but to build practical literacy and communication skills, and the confidence to apply them.&lt;ref name="Unlocked site"/&gt;

==Public Projects==

The Red Room Company regularly runs major public creative projects whose goal is to commission new works by contemporary Australian poets, then publicise this new work as widely as possible. Past Projects include:

*Pigeon Poetry - eight poets from across the country were commissioned to each write a poem that would be raced by thoroughbred pigeons on 3 August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pigeon Poetry Page|url=http://pigeonpoetry.com/|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Clubs &amp; Socs - in 2011 contemporary poets were paired with clubs and societies from across Australia. Poets created new poetic works based on their experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clubs and Societies microsite|url=http://clubsandsocieties.org.au/|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sea Things - saw four new poems commissioned from poets in Hobart, Melbourne, Brisbane and Darwin, and from secondary school students in Perth, Darwin and Thursday Island, as the project charted the Sydney Hobart Yacht Race.

The '''VFX creative director''' is a position common in [[film]]s, [[television program]]s, and [[computer game]]s using a large amount of [[visual effects]].

For movies which are fully or partly [[computer-generated imagery|computer generated]], a VFX creative director works closely with the [[film director|director]]. On smaller VFX-intensive productions such as [[music video]]s or some [[television commercial]]s, a VFX creative director may also assume the responsibilities of the director. They are charged with making creative and aesthetic choices for visual effects. Although the role is generally more creative in nature, most VFX creative directors have a technical background and may exert a strong practical hand in production.

==Responsibilities==
The responsibilities of a VFX creative director are very much like those of an [[art director]], [[production designer]], or [[chief creative officer]], though with a particular focus on the computer-generated imagery of their projects. They are primarily responsible for directing and supervising the creative and technical execution of visual effects sequences, from concept to completion, including:
* [[Set extension]]s and matte painting
* [[Chroma key|Bluescreen]]ing
* [[Computer animation|Digital animation]]
* Digital effects
* [[Compositing]]

The VFX creative director may delegate responsibilities to [[visual effects supervisor]]s, visual effects editors, film [[compositing|compositors]], [[rotoscoping|rotoscope artists]], [[matte painting|matte painters]], and [[3D computer graphics|3D animators]].

VFX creative directors may therefore have input on various aspects of production, including:
* Story development and [[storyboarding]]
* Blocking, staging, locations
* Advising the director on actor movement
* [[Cinematography]]
* [[Costume]], [[makeup]], and [[Film prop|props]], particularly when there are [[special effects]] considerations

==Educational requirements==
As with much of the film industry, merit is awarded on the quality of work produced and not on academic qualifications. Bachelor's or master's degrees in film and television, digital media, design, or animation may be beneficial. There are a suite of skills and conditions that predispose an individual to successful operation as a VFX creative director:
* Experience from at least 5–10 years in the industry
* An understanding of the production process from concept to completion
* A deep familiarity with post-production pipelines, techniques, and software
* A strong balance of both creative and practical / technical skills
* Excellent communication and people-management skills
* Ability to guide and lead a team to extract their best work according to a predefined vision
* A strong grasp of all aspects of film theory

[[Image:Viaje del Parnaso.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece of the 1614 edition.]]
'''''Viaje del Parnaso''''' (sometimes called ''Viaje al Parnaso'') ({{lang-es|Journey to [[Parnassus]]}}) is a poetic work by [[Miguel de Cervantes]]. It was first published in 1614, two years before the author's death.

The chief object of the poem is to survey contemporary poets, assembled on an imaginary boat to [[Parnassus]], and ridicule (and sometimes throw overboard) those who, in Cervantes' opinion, are deficient. This satire is of a peculiar character: an effusion of sportive humour, leaving it a matter of doubt whether Cervantes intended to praise or to ridicule the individuals whom he points out as being particularly worthy of the favour of [[Apollo]]. He himself says: "Those whose names do not appear in this list may be just as well pleased as those who are mentioned in it."  Cervantes' aims in composing the poem seem to have been to characterise true poetry according to his own poetic feelings, to manifest in a decided way his enthusiasm for the art even in his old age, and to hold up a mirror for the conviction of those who were only capable of making rhymes and inventing extravagances. Concealed satire and open jesting are the combined elements of this work. 

The poem is divided into eight chapters, and the versification is in [[tercet]]s.  The composition is half comic and half serious. After many humorous incidents, [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] appears to Cervantes (who is represented as travelling to Parnassus in the most miserable condition), saluting him with the title of the "Adam of poets". Mercury, after addressing to him many flattering compliments, conducts him to a ship entirely built of different kinds of verse, which is intended to convey a cargo of Spanish poets to the kingdom of Apollo. The description of the ship is a comic allegory. Mercury shows him a list of the poets with whom Apollo wishes to become acquainted and this list, owing to the problematic nature of its half ironical and half serious praises, has proved a stumbling block to commentators. In the midst of the reading, Cervantes suddenly drops the list. The poets are now described as crowding on board the ship in numbers as countless as drops of rain in a shower, or grains of sand on the seacoast; and such a tumult ensues, that, to save the ship from sinking by their pressure, the sirens raise a furious storm. The flights of imagination become more wild as the story advances. Thy storm subsides, and is succeeded by a shower of poets, that is to say poets fall from the clouds. One of the first who descends on the ship is [[Lope de Vega]], on whom Cervantes seizes this opportunity of pronouncing an emphatic praise. The remainder of the poem, a complete analysis of which would occupy too much space, proceeds in the same spirit.

One of the pieces of verse written by Cervantes, is his description of the goddess Poesy, whom he sees in all her glory in the kingdom of Apollo. To this picture the portrait of the goddess Vain-Glory, who afterwards appears to the author in a dream, forms a companion. Among the passages, which for burlesque humour vie with ''Don Quixote'' is the description of a second storm, in which [[Poseidon|Neptune]] vainly endeavours to plunge the poetasters to the bottom of the deep. [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] prevents them from sinking, by changing them into gourds and leather flasks. At length a formal battle is fought between the real poets and some of the poetasters. 

The poem is interspersed throughout with singularly witty ideas; and only a few passages fail to live up to the general standard. It had no prototype. The language is classical throughout, but Cervantes added to the poem a comic supplement in prose, praising his own ability.

'''Windows Color System''' (WCS) is a platform for [[color management]], first included with [[Windows Vista]], that aims to achieve color consistency across various software and hardware, including cameras, monitors, printers and scanners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/display/color/WCS.mspx Windows Color System]&lt;/ref&gt; Different devices interpret the same colors differently, according to their software and hardware configurations. As a result, they must be properly calibrated to reproduce colors consistently across different devices. WCS aims to make this process of [[color calibration]] automatic and transparent, as an evolution of [[ICC profile]]s.

Windows Color System features a ''Color Infrastructure and Translation Engine'' (CITE) at its core. It is backed up by a color processing pipeline that supports bit-depths more than 32 bits per pixel, multiple color channels (more than three), alternative [[color space]]s and [[high dynamic range imaging|high dynamic range]] coloring, using a technology named ''Kyuanos''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reuveni|first1=Noam|title=Windows Vista to use Canon Color Management|url=http://cameras.reviewed.com/content/Windows-Vista-to-use-Canon-Color-Management|website=Reviewed.com Cameras|date=13 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed by [[Canon Inc.|Canon]]. The color processing pipeline allows device developers to add their own [[Color management#Gamut mapping|gamut mapping]] algorithm into the pipeline to customize the color response of the device. The new pipeline also supports floating point calculations to minimize [[round-off error]]s, which are inherent in integer processing. Once the color pipeline finishes processing the colors, the CITE engine applies a [[color translation]] according to a color profile, specific to a device to ensure the output color matches to what is expected.

WCS features explicit support for LCD as well as CRT monitors, projectors, printers, and other imaging devices and provides customized support for each. WCS uses color profiles according to [[CIECAM02]], defined using [[XML]], to define how the color representation actually translates to a visible color. [[International Color Consortium|ICC]] V4 color profiles are also supported. [[Windows Photo Gallery]] and Photo Viewer only support the deprecated V2 standard and show dark images when used with V4 profiles, [[Windows Imaging Component]], the [[HD Photo]] format, [[XML Paper Specification|XPS]] print path and XPS documents all support color management.

The '''Women of Color Film Festival''' was founded in 1992 and takes place at the [[University of California at Santa Cruz]].

As the longest running event of its kind, the UCSC Women of Color Film and Video Festival has sparked dialogue across communities locally, nationally, and trans-nationally by providing a platform for critical explorations of race, nation, class, gender, ethnicity, and sexuality. It has become a much-anticipated and acclaimed event for its commitment to visual expression, scholarship, and activism.

To date it has shown close to 300 films by women of color as well as hosted workshops and panel discussions with filmmakers, artists, and activists. Past festival participants have included [[Julie Dash]], [[Cheryl Dunye]], [[Lourdes Portillo]], [[Alma Lopez]], and [[Osa Hidalgo de la Riva]].
