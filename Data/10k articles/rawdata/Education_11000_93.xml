      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13616">'''Academic careerism''' is the tendency of [[academics]] ([[professors]] specifically and intellectuals generally) to pursue their own enrichment and self-advancement at the expense of honest inquiry, unbiased research and dissemination of truth to their students and society. Such careerism has been criticized by thinkers from [[Socrates]] in [[ancient Athens]] to [[Russell Jacoby]] in the present.

== Socrates' criticism of the Sophists ==
[[File:Xenophon.jpg|thumb|[[Xenophon]]]]
In [[Xenophon|Xenophon's]] ''[[Memorabilia (Xenophon)|Memorabilia]]'', [[Socrates]] draws a comparison between the proper and honorable way to bestow beauty and the proper and honorable way to bestow wisdom. Those who offer beauty for sale on the market are called prostitutes, and are held in disrepute by the Athenians. Those who offer wisdom for sale, on the other hand, are highly respected. Socrates believes this is an error. The Sophists should be seen for what they are, prostitutors of wisdom.

:When we see a woman bartering beauty for gold, we look upon such a one as no other than a common prostitute; but she who rewards the passion of some worthy youth with it, gains at the same time our approbation and esteem. It is the very same with philosophy: he who sets it forth for public sale, to be disposed of to the highest bidder, is a sophist, a public prostitute.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''Memorabilia'', 1.6.11, T. Stanley, trans., p. 535&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Plato|Plato's]] ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'', Socrates draws an analogy between peddlers of unhealthy food and peddlers of false and deceptive wisdom. Food peddlers advertise their wares as healthy without offering solid evidence to back up their claims, leading those who trust them to succumb to an unhealthy diet. Peddlers of knowledge try to persuade impressionable young minds that what they teach is salutary and true, again without offering solid arguments to back up their claims. They mislead young minds on paths not conducive to intellectual flourishing.

:Knowledge is the food of the soul; and we must take care, my friend, that the Sophist does not deceive us when he praises what he sells, like the dealers wholesale or retail who sell the food of the body; for they praise indiscriminately all their goods, without knowing what are really beneficial or hurtful.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'' 313c, Benjamin Jowett, trans.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Schopenhauer's criticism of university philosophy ==
[[File:Arthur Schopenhauer Portrait by Ludwig Sigismund Ruhl 1815.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Arthur Schopenhauer]]]]

Nineteenth-century German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] contrasts the genuine philosopher, who earnestly pursues truth and offers its fruits to all who will listen, to the "businessmen of the chair", the academics of his day who have debased the pursuit of knowledge into a means of livelihood no more dignified than the practice of business or law. The motto of the academic opportunists is "''primum vivere deinde philosophari''"&amp;mdash;first live, afterwards philosophize. The bourgeois sentiment that someone who earns his living by a profession must know something about it makes those who hold the academic chairs immune from criticism. They make their living from philosophy, the public reasons, so they must know philosophy. The philosophy taught in the universities, Schopenhauer claims, is really no more than a superficial rationalization for the institutionalized religion, the intentions of the government, and the prevailing views of the times.

:We should judge university philosophy ... by its true and proper aim: ... that the junior barristers, solicitors, doctors, probationers, and pedagogues of the future should maintain, even in their innermost conviction, the same line of thought in keeping with the aims and intentions that the State.&lt;ref&gt;[[Schopenhauer]], "On Philosophy in the Universities," ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', E. Payne, trans. (1974) Vol. 1, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Julien Benda's ''Treason of the Intellectuals'' ==
French scholar [[Julien Benda]] (1867–1956) observes that in the past intellectuals have adopted two poses toward politics. The first was [[Plato|Plato's]] [[The Republic (Plato)|doctrine]] that morality must decide politics. The second was [[Machiavelli|Machiavelli's]], which said that politics has nothing do to with morality. Benda accuses the generation of intellectuals influential in France in the 1920s of adopting a third, far more pernicious, pose: that politics must be allowed to decide morality. The cause of this "divinizing of politics" is that the intellectuals (French ''clercs'') of his era have abandoned the ideal of disinterestedness, and now consider themselves to be ordinary citizens, subject to the same incentives as ordinary citizens.

:The true ''clerc'' is [[Luc de Clapiers, marquis de Vauvenargues|Vauvenargues]], [[Lamarck]], [[Fresnel]], [[Spinoza]], [[Schiller]], [[Baudelaire]], [[César Franck]], who were never diverted from single-hearted adoration of the beautiful and the divine by the necessity of earning their daily bread. But such ''clercs'' are inevitably rare. ... The rule is that the living creature condemned to struggle for life turns to practical passions, and thence to the sanctifying of those passions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julien Benda]], ''Treason of the Intellectuals'' (1927), R. Aldington, trans. (2007) p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pursuit of personal advantage by purveying knowledge, Benda explains, has been held in disrepute since antiquity. But in his generation, this view of intellectual work has begun to seem obsolete, replaced by a kind of institutionalized careerism in which intellectuals were driven by the same petty desires for personal advantage as businessmen and lawyers.

:Since the Greeks the predominant attitude of thinkers towards intellectual activity was to glorify it insofar as (like aesthetic activity) it finds its satisfaction in itself, apart from any attention to the advantages it may procure. Most thinkers would have agreed with ... [[Ernest Renan|Renan’s]] verdict that the man who loves science for its fruits commits the worst of blasphemies against that divinity. ... The modern ''clercs'' have violently torn up this charter. They proclaim the intellectual functions are only respectable to the extent that they are bound up with the pursuit of concrete advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Benda 1927, pp. 151-152.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Russell Jacoby's criticisms of contemporary academia ==
Historian [[Russell Jacoby]], writing in the 1970s, observes that intellectual production has succumbed to the same pattern of [[planned obsolescence]] used by manufacturing enterprises to generate renewed demand for their products.

:The application of planned obsolescence to thought itself has the same merit as its application to consumer goods; the new is not only shoddier than the old, it fuels an obsolete social system that staves off its replacement by manufacturing the illusion that it is perpetually new.&lt;ref&gt;[[Russell Jacoby]], ''Social Amnesia'' (1975), p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacoby laments the demise of the radical [[Frankfurt School|critical theory]] of the previous generation, which sought to understand and articulate the contradictions inherent in bourgeois and liberal democratic ideologies. The new generation of theories, in contrast, seek to allow the contradictory elements of the ideology to coexist by isolating them, assigning them to separate departments in the university. This division of intellectual labor in the service of the prevailing ideology, Jacoby says, "severs the life nerve of dialectical thought."&lt;ref&gt;Jacoby 1975, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacoby ends his 1987 book ''The Last Intellectuals'' on a despairing note, observing that even radical Marxist intellectuals aren't immune to the pressure to achieve tenure, and have begun to alter their research methods in conformity to pressure from university administrators.&lt;ref&gt;[[Russell Jacoby]], ''The Last Intellectuals'' (1987), pp. 158-159.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Edward Said's description of the career of critical theory in the 1980s ==
[[File:Edward Said Crop.jpg|thumb|[[Edward Said]]]]

Literature professor [[Edward Said]], in his 1983 book ''The World, the Text, and the Critic'', accuses literary theorists of his generation of succumbing to the free-market ideology of the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] era. The previous generation of critical theorists, Said explains, did not allow itself to be constrained by the conventional separation of academic fiefdoms. It maintained an insurrectionary relationship with the society in which it lived. The generation of critical theorists influential in the 1980s, however, began to betray these ideals, and timorously succumbed to the prevailing societal ethic of specialization and professionalism.

::The intellectual origins of literary theory in Europe were, I think it is accurate to say, insurrectionary. The traditional university, the hegemony of determinism and positivism, the reification of ideological bourgeois “humanism,” the rigid barriers between academic specialties: it was powerful responses to all these that linked together such influential progenitors of today’s literary theorist as [[Saussure]], [[Lukács]], [[Bataille]], [[Lévi-Strauss]], [[Freud]], [[Nietzsche]], and [[Marx]]. Theory proposed itself as a synthesis overriding the petty fiefdoms within the world of intellectual production, and it was manifestly to be hoped as a result that all the domains of human activity could be seen, and lived, as a unity. … Literary theory, whether of the Left or the Right, has turned its back on these things. This can be considered, I think, the triumph of the ethic of professionalism. But it is no accident that the emergence of so narrowly defined a philosophy of pure textuality and critical noninterference has coincided with the ascendancy of [[Ronald Reagan|Reaganism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Said]], ''The World, the Text, and the Critic'' (1983), pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Camille Paglia's characterization of the "junk bond" era in academia ==
[[File:Crop (2) of Camille Paglia no Fronteiras do Pensamento São Paulo 2015.jpg|thumb|left|[[Camille Paglia]]]]

Writing in 1991, "dissident feminist" scholar [[Camille Paglia]] finds in [[David Halperin|David Halperin's]] work a prototypical example of rampant careerism in the humanities. Paglia observes that Halperin's generation of academics is prone to a "contemporary parochialism" that eagerly cites hot-off-the-press articles without attempting to critically assess their objective merit in light of the intellectual tradition. Paglia accuses Halperin of assembling a pastiche of the latest faddish opinions and marketing it as a book, not for the sake of advancing the cause of truth, but with no other aim than career advancement. She compares such scholarship to [[junk bond]]s, a highly volatile investment.  

:Never in my career have I seen a scholarly book of such naked worldly ambition, such lack of scruple about its methods or its claims to knowledge. It is exquisitely emblematic of its time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Camille Paglia]], “Junk Bonds and Corporate Raiders: Academe in the Hour of the Wolf,” ''Arion'', Third Series, Vol. 1, No. 2 (Spring, 1991), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paglia characterizes contemporary academic discourse influenced by French theorists such as [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Michel Foucault]] as the academic equivalent of name brand consumerism. "Lacan, Derrida, and Foucault," she says, "are the academic equivalents of BMW, Rolex, and Cuisinart."&lt;ref&gt;Paglia 1991, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the inspiration of the latest academic fashions, academics manufacture insipid prose with no objective merit for the same reason fashion designers come out with new fashions each season. Academics peddle the latest fashionable theories to replace perfectly good older theories, made obsolete not by genuine progress, but only by incessant changes in fashion, changes deliberately contrived to create consumer demand in a credulous public. The self-seeking of the latest generation of scholars is, for Paglia, symptomatic of an era iconically represented by junk bond traders on Wall Street, concerned not with creating a quality product, but only with making a quick buck. She takes Halperin's essay "Why is Diatoma a Woman?" as an example, calling it "one of the great junk bonds of the fast-track academic era, whose unbridled greed for fame and power was intimately in sync with parallel developments on Wall Street."&lt;ref&gt;Paglia 1991, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a remedy for rampant careerism in academia, Paglia prescribes a return to the ancient ascetic roots of the academic tradition.

:Academe needs deprofessionalization and deyuppification. It has to recover its clerical or spiritual roots. Scholarship is an ideal and a calling, not merely a trade or living. Every year at commencement, we put on medieval robes that connect us to a great monastic past.&lt;ref&gt;Paglia 1991, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paglia advises the graduate students of the next generation to return to the gentlemanly and ascetic traditions of past academics, avoiding faddish subjects or methods of interpretation, refusing to seek material reward from their work, and pursuing instead a lofty ideal of scholarship in which work follows "its own organic rhythm" rather than chasing the latest trends to win approval from contemporaries.

==Plot==
Roberto ([[Hernán Mendoza]]) is depressed after his wife Lucía dies in a road accident. He decides to leave [[Puerto Vallarta]] and live in [[Mexico City]] with his 17-year-old daughter, Alejandra ([[Tessa Ía|Tessa Ía González Norvind]]).  Settling into her new school, Alejandra goes to a party one night with her classmates.  At the party, she has sex with José, who films the encounter on his phone.  The next day the footage has been circulated around the school, with Alejandra getting text messages calling her a slut.  This incident provides a reason for the  students in the school to bully and sexually harass Alejandra. She  does not speak of these incidents of bullying or sexual harassment to anyone. 

The school organises a trip to [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]] which all the students must attend.  At the resort, each room has to be shared in groups of four.  Alejandra is bullied again into going into the shower by her female roommates. They then block the door of the bathroom from outside, thus locking her in.  At night, the rest of the students enjoy a party in the main room.  The boys in the room take turns and rape her. Alejandra is helpless in the locked bathroom with the bullies in the room drinking while she is being raped.

The students then all go to the beach to continue the party.  When the party ends, Alejandra is asleep on the beach as one of the male students urinates on her.  One of the female students suggests she should go into the sea to wash herself.  The rest of them join her and they have fun in the water.  Alejandra disappears from the group and the rest of them become anxious about what repercussions now might happen.  The next morning, the teachers discover that Alejandra is missing and alert her father.  He discovers what has been going on with the bullying and is frustrated when the police cannot help him, as the crimes have been committed by minors.

Unbeknown to everyone, Alejandra is in fact safe and enters a building to sleep.  Meanwhile, her father follows a car driven by José's father and he kidnaps José after his father has parked his car.  He ties his hands behind his back and gags him.  He drives to the coast where he hires a boat and takes José out to sea where he throws him overboard, before starting the engine again and continuing to ride in the sea.

'''Alexander Reuben Percy "Alex" Moore''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|MBE}} (1901&amp;ndash;1991) was an [[English people|English]] [[ballroom dancer]] from Stourbridge. He was a pioneer of modern [[ballroom dancing]], a leading adjudicator and organiser,  a dance teacher of international renown and the [[author]] of classical ballroom dancing texts. His ''Ballroom Dancing'' is considered to be the 'Bible' of International-style ballroom dancing.

His dancing career started at the age of 6. In 1926 he was placed second in a World Championship of ballroom dancing, dancing with his sister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istd.org/ballroom/facultynews/december2006/alexmoores.html Who was Alex Moore] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070322185911/http://www.istd.org/ballroom/facultynews/december2006/alexmoores.html |date=2007-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932 he partnered Pat Kilpatrick, who would become his wife. In both his dancing and later his teaching he travelled all over the world.

He held the post of Chairman and later President of the [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing|ISTD]], and was Honorary President of the International Council of Ballroom Dance. From 1932 Alex Moore issued the ''Alex Moore Monthly Letter Service'', a periodical about ballroom dancing, with hints for dancers and instructors and news about dance championships. It was circulated in 40 countries in several languages. His 1936 ''Ballroom Technique'' book is the base of the ISTD reference for the category of [[International Standard (dance)|International Standard]]. Addressing the need in quick reference, he devised the chart format of the description of ballroom dance figures, used today.

==Bibliography==

== History ==
Ashkal Alwan was founded in 1994 by [[Christine Tohmé]] (Curator), Marwan Rechmaoui (Artist), Rania Tabbara (Graphic Designer and Interior Designer), Mustapha Yamout (Cultural Events Organizer) and Leila Mroueh (Communications Director).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ashkalalwan.org/about.aspx?id=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218150952/http://www.ashkalalwan.org/about.aspx?id=1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 December 2011 |title=Ashkal Alwan, Who we are |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=14 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashkal Alwan (in Arabic: forms and colors) was created in the aftermath of the Lebanese war. It is nowadays an informal and alternative platform that helps a new generation of Lebanese artists to produce and exhibit their artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://universes-in-universe.org/eng/nafas/articles/2006/ashkal_alwan |title=Ashkal Alwan  The Lebanese Association for Plastic Arts |author=Anne Maier |date=February 2006 |work= |publisher=Institute for Foreign Cultural Relations (ifa), Germany, Elke aus dem Moore, in cooperation with Universes in Universe - Worlds of Art |accessdate=14 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashkal Alwan became a major and influential actor on the regional art scene, exhibiting the work of local and international artists such as [[Jalal Toufic]], [[Akram Zaatari]], [[Lamia Joreige]], [[Walid Raad]], [[Rabih Mroué]] and many others. Its director, [[Christine Tohmé]], is regularly ranked among the 100 most powerful people in the art world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://artreview.com/power_100/christine_tohm/|title=2017 POWER 100|author=|first=|date=October 2010|work=|publisher=Art Review|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since its creation, Ashkal Alwan developed cultural projects in public spaces, in Lebanon and abroad. From 2002 onwards, Home Works Forum became the association's major regular event, hosting exhibitions, performances and talks. 

In 2011, Ashkal Alwan inaugurated the Home Workspace in a former industrial building neighboring [[Beirut Art Center]]. The venue hosts cultural events and the Home Workspace Program, a 10 months educational program run under the direction of a different resident professor. The 2011-2012 inauguration year was under the direction of [[Emily Jacir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beirut.com/l/6343 |title=2011-2012 Home Workspace Program, with Resident Artist Emily Jacir |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Beirut.com |accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the larger scientific movement of this period, Judd pushed for the use of scientific methods to the understanding of education and, thus, wanted to limit the use of theory in the field.

Born in [[Bareilly]], [[India]] of American missionary parents, Judd obtained a [[PhD]] at the [[University of Leipzig]] under the tutelage of [[Wilhelm Wundt]].&lt;ref&gt;Brock, Adrian.

The '''Christian Leaders' Training College of Papua New Guinea''' ('''CLTC''') is an interdenominational Bible college. It was established in 1964 and offers theological study at up to Masters level.

==Location==
The college is located near the township of [[Banz (Papua New Guinea)|Banz]], in the [[Western Highlands Province]] of [[Papua New Guinea]]. The nearest major city is [[Mount Hagen]], which is a 60-minute drive from CLTC, mostly on sealed road. A major medical centre is located approximately 15 minutes drive away, at Kudjip.

CLTC is located next to the Sigri [[coffee]] and Bunem-Wo [[tea]] plantations, which are renowned for producing some of the best quality tea and coffee in [[Papua New Guinea]].

CLTC also has satellite centres in [[Port Moresby]] and [[Lae]], [[Papua New Guinea]]'s two largest cities.

==Campus==
Most of the students reside on the campus, which has a population of approximately 500. Many of the residents of CLTC are involved in agricultural support programmes, which help to support the students financially during their studies. The college operates a hatchery which provides day-old chickens for the local markets, [[abattoir]] and market gardens. The laying section also provides table eggs that are sold throughout the provinces. Previously it also operated a dairy, but this was shut down for commercial reasons in the 1990s and converted to the abattoir.

The Campus also contains its own corner store and medical clinic that services the college and the surrounding local communities. The theological library contains approximately 30,000 books which is one of the largest in Papua New Guinea.

CLTC's faculty includes both Nationally and Internationally trained theological lecturers. Its students are drawn from across the [[Oceania|South Pacific]], including [[Papua New Guinea]], the [[Solomon Islands]] and [[Vanuatu]].

==Courses offered==
CLTC offers Diploma of Ministry, [[Bachelor of Theology]], and [[Master of Theology]] degrees.

CLTC also offers a Graduate Refresher Courses and Pastoral courses, and Theological Education by Extension (TEE), a distance programme at Certificate Level.

CLTC is a member of the [[South Pacific Association of Bible Colleges]]. 

==Journal==
CLTC publishes the ''Melanesian Journal of Theology'' (MJT) on behalf of the Melanesian Association of Theological Schools. ''MJT'' was established in 1985, and was produced in print until 2012, and exclusively online from 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Melanesian Journal of Theology|url=http://www.cltc.ac.pg/MelanesianbrJournalofbrnbspnbspTheology.aspx|publisher=Christian Leaders Training College|accessdate=12 February 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160211142550/http://www.cltc.ac.pg/MelanesianbrJournalofbrnbspnbspTheology.aspx|archivedate=11 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cota was established by citizens of German heritage in 1971 as a [[Apartheid|Whites-only]] State [[Music school|Conservatory]] of Music. In the mid-80s drama and visual arts were added to the Conservatory's programs, and in 1990 it was renamed ''College for the Arts''.&lt;ref name="AL"/&gt;

The seven full-time degree programs currently offered are African Performing Arts, Product Development and Design, Fashion Design, Television Production, Radio Production, New Media Design, and Music and Sound Production.&lt;ref name="AL"/&gt; Tertiary programs are offered as three-year courses of studies. COTA's leitmotiv is "Lifelong learning through the arts". &lt;ref name=Rothe&gt;Rothe, Andreas (2010): Media System and News Selection in Namibia. p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''"Method of Currere"''' is an approach to education based on [[post-modern philosophy]] and [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytical technique]], first described in a 1975 paper by [[William Pinar]].&lt;ref name="Pinar"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pinar|first=William Frederick|year=1975|title=The method of currere|journal=American Educational Research Association|url=http://eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED104766.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The method ==

Currere encourages educators and learners to undertake an autobiographical examination of themselves.

Pinar suggests that the term ''currere'', the infinitive form of [[curriculum]], implies the framework for the autobiographical reflection on educational experiences that ultimately shape an individual's self-understanding in our democratic society. In relation to curriculum Pinar states, "The method of currere reconceptualized curriculum from course objectives to complicated conversation with oneself (as a 'private' intellectual), an ongoing project of self-understanding in which one becomes mobilized for engaged pedagogical action — as a private-and-public intellectual – with others in the social reconstruction of the public sphere".&lt;ref name="pinar2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinar|first=William|title=What is curriculum theory?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lOjsgKnT2asC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-8058-4827-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The framework ==

Pinar proposes a framework for the method of currere requiring those involved in education to reflect upon their life experiences thus far. The framework includes four steps or benchmarks to be followed.&lt;ref name="Pinar"/&gt; The steps are: the regressive, the progressive, the analytical, and the synthetic. Pinar uses the four steps as a framework to reflect on curriculum theory and public education. The framework's purpose is as follows, "This four step process includes retelling the story of one's educational experiences, imagining future possibilities for self-understanding and educational practice; analysis of the relationships between past, present and future life history and practice; and new ways of thinking about education".

Step one: The regressive step encourages learner/educators to remember particular educational experiences and how the past experiences have guided them in the development of their own personal attitude or beliefs about education. This allows them to understand how the past has not only affected them, but the people surrounding them. Pinar says one's past is "shared, each in his or her own way, by us all."&lt;ref name="pinar2004"/&gt; They may remember past experiences and how they overcame struggles as a young person in society. [[John Dewey]] describes experience through trial and error. He states, "We simply do something, and when it fails, we do something else, and keep on trying till we hit upon something which works, and then we adopt that method as a rule of thumb measure in subsequent procedure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dewey|first=John|title=Democracy and Education: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jRFWAJJVE_EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=1916 repub. 2011|isbn=978-1-60444-120-8|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Step two: The progressive step offers an opportunity to think about the future.

Step three: The analytical step involves analyzing the here and now and creates a subjective space of freedom from the present. Students and teachers may see the moments of right here and now as a "historical moment in which we lived, in which others have lived, and in which our descendants will someday live".&lt;ref name="pinar2004"/&gt;

Step four: The final step is the synthetic step which involves analyzing the present in light of the knowledge and understanding gained from steps 1, 2, and 3. Many educators may use the first three steps to visualize and analyze their journey of becoming an educator. When they ultimately begin affecting others' lives and working with curriculum, educators find themselves in the synthetic stage of becoming. "One utilizes insights from past, present and future to create transformed educational environments".&lt;ref name="Kissel-Ito"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kissel-Ito|first=Cindy|date=May 2008|title=The name assigned to the document by the author. This field may also contain sub-titles, series names, and report numbers. "Currere" as Transformative Story Telling in Religious Education|journal=Religious Education|publisher=Routledge|volume=103|issue=3|pages=339–350|url=http://www.religiouseducation.net/member/06_rea_papers/Kissel-Ito_Cindy.pdf|doi=10.1080/00344080802053519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==

James G. Henderson and Rosie Gornik use currere in Transformative Curriculum Leadership as they present educators a particular type of curriculum judgment. They use a paradigm called curriculum wisdom problem solving while envisioning curriculum as a journey. Just as Pinar presents our process of becoming a journey, Henderson and Gornik use currere throughout their writing with the purpose of allowing the reader insights into firsthand accounts of educators' experiences. They work closely with teaching for [[3S Understanding]]—"referring to the integration of Subject matter understanding with democratic Self and Social understanding and undertaking a personal journey of understanding".&lt;ref name="henderson2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Henderson|first1=James George|last2=Gornik|first2=Rosemary|title=Transformative curriculum leadership|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Merrill/Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-113896-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within Transformative Curriculum Leadership we find Gornik's deep self-understanding in regard to [[3S Understanding]] through her currere. She presents the reader with various autobiographical narratives and vignettes written to inspire the reader to delve into their own currere and examine their own self-understanding.

Henderson and Gornik (2007) say they incorporate the currere method in their book because they "acknowledge that educators who choose to facilitate their students' personalized journeys of understanding cannot do so without undertaking a similar journey of understanding".&lt;ref name="henderson2007"/&gt; Educators have many responsibilities including presenting their students with opportunities or ideas of how to become active members in today's democratic society. The purpose of the book is to encourage the reader to become a "connoisseur" of democratic education with an understanding of educational growth in societies with democratic values.&lt;ref name="henderson2007"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7359">'''DADIU''' (The National Academy of Digital, Interactive Entertainment) founded in 2005 is an [[academy]] located in [[Copenhagen]] and [[Aalborg]] in [[Denmark]] that educates students in the creation of [[computer games]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dadiu.dk/about/ About DADIU]&lt;/ref&gt; The DADIU program is a collaboration between different universities and art schools in [[Denmark]].

== The DADIU Education and Program ==
The DADIU program is a specialisation and educates future [[Video game developer|game developers]] in different fields of [[computer game development]] and [[video game development]]. The students participating in DADIU come from  universities and art schools in Denmark but are taught a joint curriculum. The DADIU programme is a full-time semester which take place each fall from August to December. Every fall semester DADIU accepts about 100 students to the program out of the many students who apply each year. The DADIU program contains both [[lectures]], [[workshops]], and game productions. During the three game productions with are the most important part of the DADIU program the students are divided into six teams which function as six real game studios. The students are accepted into a specific competence  as part of the DADIU program. Every fall semester the DADIU accepted six [[Game designers]], six [[Game director]]s, six [[Project managers]], six [[Level designer]]s, six [[Audio designer]]s, six [[Art directors]], and a number of [[Game Programmer]]s, [[CG Artist]]s, [[QA &amp; UX Manager]]s, [[Visual designer]]s, and [[Animators]] into the program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dadiu.dk/the-programme/ The DADIU Program]&lt;/ref&gt;

The students thus complete their ongoing studies but also receive a diploma certifying to the industry that they have completed the training at the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dadiu.dk/english/the-education dadiu.dk - the education]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eben Norton Horsford''' (July 27, 1818 – January 1, 1893) was an [[United States|American]] scientist who is best known for his reformulation of [[baking powder]], his interest in [[Viking]] settlements in America, and the monuments he built to [[Leif Erikson]].

==Life and career==
[[File:Anne Whitney, Eben Norton Horsford, 1890, Davis Museum, Wellesley.tif|thumb|[[Anne Whitney]], ''Eben Norton Horsford'', 1890, [[Davis Museum at Wellesley College|Davis Museum]], [[Wellesley College]]]]
Eben Horsford was born in [[Livingston County, New York]] in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;Both Stock and Van Klooster say that Horsford was born in [[Leicester (village), New York|Moscow]] (now called Leicester), New York, but the American Chemical Society web sites noted on this page say that the town was [[Livonia (village), New York|Livonia]].&lt;/ref&gt;  He studied at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], graduating as a civil engineer at age 19. He then worked for two years in the Geological Survey of New York, and shortly after he had reached his majority he became an instructor in mathematics and the sciences at the [[Albany Female Academy]], where he taught for four years, after which he resumed his studies in Germany with [[Justus von Liebig]]. On returning to the United States, Horsford was appointed the Rumford Professor and Lecturer on the Application of Science to the Useful Arts at [[Harvard]] in 1847. He taught chemistry and conducted research at the [[Lawrence Scientific School]] at Harvard for 16 years, and published articles in major scientific publications on such topics as phosphates, condensed milk, fermentation, and emergency rations.

[[File:Leif Erikson Marker Cambridge MA.jpg|thumb|140px|right|The "Horsford Plaque", a granite marker along the [[Charles River]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. Location:  {{Coord|42|22|23.82|N|71|8|3.17|W|region:US-MA_type:landmark_scale:30000}}.]]

Eben Horsford probably is best remembered today for reformulating [[baking powder]]. Previously, baking powder had contained baking soda and [[cream of tartar]]. Horsford replaced the cream of tartar with the more reliable [[calcium biphosphate]] (also known as calcium acid phosphate and many other names).&lt;ref name="straightdope.com"&gt;{{cite web| title = Did Leif Erikson once live in Cambridge, Massachusetts? | work = The Straight Dope | url =  http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mleifinma.html | accessdate = 2009-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He did this a little earlier than [[August Oetker]].  In 1854, Horsford, with partner George Wilson, formed the [[Rumford Chemical Works and Mill House Historic District | Rumford Chemical Works]]. They named it after the title of Horsford's position at Harvard.  It was in that enterprise that Horsford created his commercially successful baking powder. Horsford's development of baking powder was designated a [[National Historic Chemical Landmarks|National Historic Chemical Landmark]] in 2006.&lt;ref name="ACS Landmarks"&gt;{{cite web|title=Development of Baking Powder|url=http://portal.acs.org/portal/PublicWebSite/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/bakingpowder/index.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130112062252/http://portal.acs.org/portal/PublicWebSite/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/bakingpowder/index.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=January 12, 2013|publisher=[[American Chemical Society]]|accessdate=June 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A generous supporter of higher education for women, Horsford became president of the board of visitors of [[Wellesley College]], and donated money for books, scientific apparatus, and a pension fund to the college.  He enjoyed remarkable success through his development of processes for manufacturing baking powder and condensed milk. In seeking patents for his inventions, Horsford was assisted by [[Charles Grafton Page]], a patent solicitor who had previously worked at the [[US Patent Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Post |first=Robert C. |chapter=Eben Horsford |title=Physics, Patents, and Politics: A Biography of Charles Grafton Page |publisher=Science History Publications |place=New York |year=1976 |page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Eben Norton Horsford created the Shelter Island Public Library in Shelter Island, New York in 1885. He donated 280 volumes for the first library, which was initially housed in a closet in the Old Store, a building that functioned as a post office, telegraph station, and local meeting place. After the store burned down in 1891, a new library for more books donated by Professor Horsford was built on a nearby lot donated by his daughter Lilian, and his daughter Cornelia became the library’s first president. 

=== Vikings === &lt;!-- do not remove -- there are links to this --&gt;

Horsford became interested in the theory that the [[Vikings]], specifically [[Leif Ericson]], had visited North America, and set out to prove it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Did Leif Erikson once live in Cambridge, Massachusetts? | work = The Straight Dope | url =  http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mleifinma.html | accessdate = 2008-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Horsford | first = Eben Norton | title =  The Landfall of Leif Erikson, A.D. 1000: And the Site of His Houses in Vineland | year = 1892 |publisher = Damrell and Upham | url =  https://books.google.com/?id=5wNCAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=The+Landfall+of+Leif+Erikson:+A.D.+1000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Horsford | first = Eben Norton | title =  The Discovery of the Ancient City of Norumbega | year = 1890 |publisher = Houghton, Mifflin | url =  https://books.google.com/?id=c2ETAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Discovery+of+the+Ancient+City+of+Norumbega }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He connected the [[Charles River|Charles River Basin]] to places described in the [[Norse saga]]s, invented [[Old Norse]] [[etymology|etymologies]] for [[Algonquin language|Algonquian]] place-names like [[Naumkeag]], [[Namskaket]], and [[Amoskeag]], and 'discovered' Viking archaeological remains.&lt;ref name="fleming"&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Robin Fleming]]|title=Picturesque History and the Medieval in Nineteenth-Century America|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=100|issue=4|pages=1079–82|year=1995|jstor=2168201|doi=10.1086/ahr/100.4.1061}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eben Norton Horsford|author2=Edward Henry Clement|title=The discovery of the ancient city of Norumbega: A communication to the president and council of the American Geographical Society at their special session in Watertown, November 21, 1889|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c2ETAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=1 September 2011|year=1890|publisher=Houghton, Mifflin|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horsford had a plaque documenting all this placed on Memorial Drive near Mount Auburn Street in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. A few miles upstream, at the mouth of [[Stony Brook (Waltham)|Stony Brook]], he had [[Norumbega Tower]] built marking the supposed location of [[Norumbega]], a Viking fort and city, complete with its [[Althing]] and America's first Christian bishop.&lt;ref name="fleming"/&gt; He also commissioned a statue of Leif Ericson that stands on [[Commonwealth Avenue, Boston|Commonwealth Avenue]] in Boston. The professor wrote a series of books, articles, and pamphlets about the Vikings' visits to Massachusetts. After his death, his daughter [[Cornelia Horsford]] took up the cause.

'''Evangelic Lutheran Lyceum''' ('''Evanjelické lyceum''') in [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]], was founded in 1606 by [[David Kilger]] as a [[Lutheran]] high school.  Until 1656 was Evangelical Lyceum a school with eight classes, two of them elementary school.  Among its students, from 1829 to 1836, was the young [[Ľudovít Štúr]], who became a member of Czech-Slav Society at the school, an important influence on his life as a Slovak nationalist.

Between 1923 and 1989 the school was closed, but it was reopened in 1991 as a bilingual school, and continues to operate today.&lt;ref&gt;http://evlyceum.sk/historia/10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ExamInCosin.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Examination at [[Durham University]], where the external examiner system originated.]]
The '''external examiner''' plays an important role in all [[university degree|degree]] level [[Test (assessment)|examination]]s in [[Universities in the United Kingdom|higher education in the United Kingdom]].  The external examiner system originated in 1832 with the establishment of the [[University of Durham]], the first in England since Cambridge was founded 600 years earlier. Durham used Oxford examiners to assure the public that its degrees were a similar standard to Oxford's.&lt;ref&gt;Cuthbert, Mike (2003) "[http://www.ukcle.ac.uk/resources/assessment-and-feedback/cuthbert/ The external examiner: how did we get here?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518100020/http://www.ukcle.ac.uk/resources/assessment-and-feedback/cuthbert/ |date=2013-05-18 }}" Presentation to the UKCLE/ALT workshop on external examiners, 6 June 2003.  Retrieved 21 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of more universities in England from the 1880s was accompanied by a requirement that examinations be conducted by internal and external examiners.  It is also found in countries whose [[higher education]] systems were developed from [[United Kingdom]] practice, or strongly influenced by it, after its introduction, including  [[New Zealand]], and [[India]].  It is one of the oldest systems of [[quality control]] within higher education.

It is a requirement for all degree level examinations at British [[universities]], and in countries operating a similar system, that at least one member of the [[Examination board|examining board]] should be from a university other than the one awarding the degree (and should have no recent affiliation with it){{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}.  This applies both to [[undergraduate]] examinations, where there may be hundreds or even thousands of candidates, and to [[postgraduate]] examinations including those for the [[PhD]] where a special board is convened for each candidate.

==Role==
While the role of the external examiner varies with the level of examination, the purpose of the system remains the same: to ensure that standards are kept the same across universities, and to provide an assurance of fair play given that internal examiners might be prejudiced for or against a candidate.  In consequence, (by convention and often by regulation) if examiners disagree, the view of the external examiner takes precedence.

==Undergraduate examinations==
In undergraduate examinations, external examiners typically see, and have to approve, draft examination questions before the papers are set; and they will mark the work, or review the marks, of at least a sample of candidates.  They are often asked to adjudicate when candidates are on borderlines or when internal examiners have disagreed about a candidate's marks.  Externals are expected to make a report both to the department and also to the university authorities; they have wide licence to comment on all aspects of the degree programme, including its staffing and teaching, not just on the examination process.  Where ''[[Oral exam|viva voce]]'' examinations are still held as part of the final degree assessment, it is common for external examiners to take part in them.  Students may have the right to ask for their work to be considered by the external examiner.  External examiners are typically appointed for a period of three or four years, and it is common to consult them about changes to the programme that are being introduced during their period of office.  In the case of undergraduate examinations in broad disciplines, there are commonly several external examiners with different areas of expertise on a board of examiners.

==PhD examinations==

In PhD examinations within the British system, there are normally only two or three examiners, and the external examiner usually takes the lead in questioning the candidate in the ''viva voce'' examination which is the key stage of the assessment.  In some other countries, e.g. Australia, New Zealand and India, externals commonly send their opinions by post, though there may also be a "local" external examiner who is present at the ''viva''.

==Appointees==
Whatever the level of examination, it is normal to appoint as externals senior academics of acknowledged expertise – though in the case of PhD exams, expertise takes priority over seniority if the two criteria cannot both be met, as is often the case with highly specialised subjects.  An invitation to serve as an external examiner is therefore usually seen as something of an honour, though often an inconvenient one: although a fee is paid to external examiners, it is usually small, and a considerable amount of work is involved, often at the busiest time of the academic year.

While the external examiner in the form described here (and the use of the title "External examiner") is specific to British or British-influenced higher education, the use of examiners from other universities (and often other countries) is widespread in other countries, especially for PhD examinations.

'''Grand rounds''' are methodology of [[medical education]] and inpatient care, consisting of presenting the medical problems and treatment of a particular patient to an audience consisting of doctors, [[Residency (medicine)|residents]], and medical students. It was first conceived by clinicians as a way for junior colleagues to round on patients.{{sfn|Stites|Warholic|2014|p=262}} The patient was traditionally present for the round and would answer questions;{{fact|date=April 2018}} grand rounds have evolved with most sessions rarely having a patient present and being more like lectures. An actor portrays the patient in some instances.{{sfn|Stites|Warholic|2014|p=262}}

{{quote box|width=350px|quote=Originally a patient-centered experience aimed at increasing clinician knowledge for treating unique cases, today Grand Rounds is more commonly used to educate students, showcase faculty role models, and promote collegiality in clinical settings{{sfn|Stites|Warholic|2014|p=262}}|source=Shana Stites and Christina Warholic, Chestnut Hill College}}
Grand rounds help doctors and other healthcare professionals keep up to date in important evolving areas which may be outside of their core practice. Most departments at major teaching hospitals will have their own specialized, often weekly, grand rounds. Attending grand rounds is also an important supplement to [[medical school]] and on-the-job [[Medical residency|resident]] training. Grand rounds can also be distinguished from rounds which is the (typically) daily visit by the attending physician and team to all that physician's patients on the ward. Rounding with an attending physician is an important part of medical on-the-job training and education, but its primary focus is immediate care for the patients on the ward. Grand rounds tends to present the bigger picture, including experience with patients over many years, and the newest research and treatments in an area. Grand rounds tend to be open to the entire medical professional community, whereas rounds are specific to individual attending physicians and their teams.

A 1966 report in the Australian journal ''[[Clinical Pediatrics]]'' called into question the sometimes inconsiderate behavior of practitioners who treated patients who were featured cases of grand rounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dugdale|first1=A. E.|title=The Grand Round|journal=Clinical Pediatrics|date=July 1966|volume=5|issue=7|pages=453-455 |url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=eue&amp;AN=17192646&amp;site=ehost-live|accessdate=9 April 2018|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Video archives ==
Many teaching and research hospitals have started providing [[streaming video]] of their grand rounds presentations for free over the Internet.{{fact|date=September 2015}}  This is an opportunity for medical professionals and students to improve their knowledge, and builds on one of the core values of the [[Hippocratic Oath]] – that medical education should be provided for free, and that doctors should actively and openly share their knowledge without compensation in order to improve patient care.

Many of these organizations provide an archive of several years of recent grand rounds presentations and as such offer a tremendous resource for increasing medical knowledge and improving patient care.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2966">'''Henry Brooke''' (1694 – 21 August 1757) was an English [[schoolmaster]] and cleric.

==Life==
Brooke was a son of William Brooke, merchant, and his wife Elizabeth Holbrook, who were married at [[Manchester Church]] in 1678-9. He was educated at [[Manchester Grammar School]], and gained an exhibition 1715-18. He proceeded to [[Oriel College, Oxford]], where he graduated MA on 30 April 1720. He was [[Doctor of Civil Law|DCL]] in 1727.

Brooke, then a fellow of Oriel, was made headmaster of Manchester Grammar School in September 1727. He obtained a [[mandamus]] from the crown to elect him a fellow of the collegiate church, and was elected in 1728, in spite of Tory opposition. He appears to have been on good terms with [[John Byrom]], but he was unsuccessful as a master, and the [[feoffees]] of the school reduced his salary from £200 to £10.

In 1730 he received the Oriel College [[Benefice|living]] of [[Tortworth]] in [[Gloucestershire]]. Here he lived, after resigning the mastership of the school in 1749, until his death on 21 August 1757. He was married, and had one daughter. Brooke left his library for the use of his successors at Tortworth. A portrait of him, as late as 1830, was at Mr. Hulton's, of [[Blackley]].

==Works==
He published ''The Usefulness and Necessity of studying the Classicks, a speech spoken at the breaking-up of the Free Grammar School in Manchester, Thursday, 13 Dec. 1744. By Hen. Brooke, A.M., High Master of the said School. Manchester, printed by R. Whitworth, Bookseller, MDCCLXIV'' (a misprint for 1744). This tract is reprinted by Whatton. Another of his works, ''The Quack Doctor'', published in 1745, is described as very poor [[doggerel]], with ironically laudatory notes, probably written by [[Robert Thyer]] or the Rev. [[John Clayton (divine)|John Clayton]]. A Latin tract, ''Medicus Circumfaraneus'', is perhaps a translation of the preceding. [[Robert Watt (bibliographer)|Robert Watt]] attributed to him two [[sermon]]s dated to 1746 and 1747. His best known book is ''A Practical Essay concerning Christian Peaceableness'', which went through three editions in 1741. The third edition contains some additional matter.

==Biography==

===Early life and ancestry===
He was born at 205 South Prospect Street in [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]], [[Chittenden County, Vermont]] in the house where he spent his entire life in the affluent "Burlington Hill" neighborhood next to the University of Vermont on  May 10, 1877.&lt;ref name=Cutter747&gt;Cutter, p. 747&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones621&gt;Jones, p. 621&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones622&gt;Jones, p. 622&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Whipple294&gt;Whipple, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Duffy232&gt;Duffy, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; He was born into a family with Midwestern roots that trace back to ''[[Mayflower]]'' passengers, [[Love Brewster]], a founder of the town of [[Bridgewater, Massachusetts]]; Elder [[William Brewster (pilgrim)|William Brewster]], the Pilgrim colonist leader and spiritual elder of the [[Plymouth Colony]]; and [[William Bradford (Plymouth governor)|William Bradford]], Governor of the Plymouth Colony and the second signer and primary architect of the [[Mayflower Compact]] in [[Provincetown Harbor]].

His father served as Dean of Arts and Sciences, vice president and was appointed interim president of the University of Vermont during World War I. He was also the state geologist of Vermont from 1898 to 1933. He graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]] from [[Yale University]], class of 1867; received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy from Yale in 1869.

His mother was Mary Judd Farnham,&lt;ref name=Cutter747&gt;Cutter, p. 747&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones621&gt;Jones, p. 621&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones622&gt;Jones, p. 622&lt;/ref&gt; an 1863 graduate of [[Knox College (Illinois)|Knox College]], and a daughter of Eli Farnham&lt;ref name="Loomis-Farnham1" /&gt; and [[Loomis Homestead|Jerusha Brewster Loomis]].&lt;ref name=Loomis117&gt;Loomis, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; She attended the [[Lincoln–Douglas debates of 1858|debates]] between [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Stephen A.

Mary's parents had emigrated to [[Illinois]] in 1836 and were the among the founders and pioneers of [[Galesburg, Illinois]]. They built a temporary cabin in Log City near current Lake Storey, just north of Galesburg, the settlers having decided that no log cabins were to be built inside the town limits. They were also instrumental in the founding of [[Knox College (Illinois)|Knox College]].

===Education===
He graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]] from the University of Vermont, Burlington in 1898, received his [[Master of Science|M.Sc]] in 1899 and was awarded his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[Zoology]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1902. The title of his [[Thesis or dissertation|doctoral thesis]] was ''The Development of Gonionema Murbachii'', which was on the development and life cycle of [[Jellyfish|Gonionema murbachii]] (a type of jellyfish).&lt;ref name="NaturalSciences750-790"&gt;NaturalSciences, pp. 750–790&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving his doctorate, he joined the faculty of UVM where he remained until his retirement.

===Marriage and family===
He married on June 11, 1903 at [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], Mary Edmunds, born at Baltimore, Maryland on October 18, 1874 the daughter of James Richard Edmunds and Anna Smith Keyser. She was the sister of Dr. Charles Keyser Edmunds, one of his fellow graduate students at Johns Hopkins. He was president of [[Lingnan University (Guangzhou)|Canton Christian College]] in [[Guangzhou|Canton]], [[Guangdong|Kwangtung Province]], [[China]] and the fifth president of [[Pomona College]] in [[Claremont, California]].&lt;ref name=Howe292&gt;Howe, p. 292&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Howe312&gt;Howe, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; Another brother was [[James R.

===Career===
In 1903, he was appointed associate professor of Zoology at University of Vermont, Burlington. He taught biology, entomology, anatomy and physiology, and embryology during the first half of his career. In 1911 was promoted to full professor and served as chairman of the Zoology Department. His sporadic research projects involved field studies in the rapidly fading naturalist tradition: studies of birds, game fish, and marine invertebrates. He retired in 1945 and remained active in the UVM Alumni Association until his death in 1956.

His interest in eugenics began shortly after the end of World War I. It was after World War I that he learned of a study by the U.S. Army which was used as part of the draft process. The results from the Army study showed that men from Vermont had an inordinately high rate of "defects" (such as diabetes, epilepsy, "deformities" and "mental deficiency"). Perkins saw this as a problem that needed to be fixed. He went about trying to "fix" this through investigation and social reform.&lt;ref name=Gallagher38-39&gt;Gallagher, pp. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt; This reform, as denounced by historian Nancy Gallagher in her research titled ''Breeding better Vermonters'', also targeted French Canadians and American natives in Vermont state, considered ''insane invasion'' to eliminate.

Around the same time, he revamped his Zoology curriculum and began teaching courses specifically on Heredity and Evolution. His heredity class provided the first known venue for eugenics education at UVM and the inspiration for a "Eugenics Survey"—a field station to study Vermonters.

===Death===
He died on November 24, 1956 in Burlington, Vermont. He is buried in Greenmount Cemetery, Burlington, Vermont.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/23351472 Henry Farnham Perkins] at [[Find A Grave]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intensive interaction''' is an approach for teaching [[communication]] skills to children and adults who have [[autism]], severe [[Developmental disability|learning difficulties]] and profound and multiple learning difficulties who are still at early stages of development. The approach focuses on teaching the Fundamentals of Communication – the communication concepts and performances that precede [[speech]] development, though it may include many people who have some speech and [[language]] development.

== History == 

Intensive interaction was developed during the 1980s by teachers working in schools in long-stay hospitals in southern [[England]]. The development of the approach came about partly as a result of practitioners questing for effective teaching approaches and partly as a reaction to and move away from the dominance of [[behavioural psychology]] in the field. A psychologist, the late Geraint Ephraim, working at [[Leavesden Hospital|Leavesden Mental Hospital]], propounded the original formulation of techniques known then as ‘Augmented Mothering’. The detailed development work carried out at [[Harperbury]] Hospital School resulted in the first research projects and publications by Melanie Nind and Dave Hewett.

The techniques of teaching borrow from understandings as to how [[infant]]s in the first two years carry out the learning of these highly complicated, critical concepts and abilities. The mass of research on babies learning in interactions with adults that has arisen since the mid-1970s, allows some simple [[pedagogical]] insights. Babies gradually accrue these complex performances by taking part in many successive, cumulative interactions with the adults around them. The main learning [[motivation]] for both participants is the mutual enjoyment of the interaction. The natural adult style is to construct the interaction basically, mostly, by allowing the baby to lead with her behaviour, with the adult building the content and a flow by responding to the behaviour of the baby. It is usually observed that the most frequently seen adult response is to imitate what the baby does. Thus the teaching is highly responsive and by process, rather than directive and driving to an objective.

For the developers of intensive interaction, it seemed a logical step to borrow from these processes in order to ignite the communication learning of many people who can frequently be considered ‘communicatively difficult to reach’, often living with some, or extensive, social isolation. Thus, intensive interaction activities are literally highly interactive, with the teacher enjoyably working from the behaviour of the learner. The activities can operate at many levels of intensity; they can be active and physical, but also quietly intense and [[contemplative]]. For good progress to occur, the activities should happen frequently (daily, day after day), with the repetition of successful activities within sessions providing the basis for the gradual expanding in duration, content, sophistication and complexity of those activities.

The gradual dissemination of intensive interaction since the late 1980s has been a completely practitioner-led initiative. Intensive interaction is now common practice in [[special school]]s and adult services all over the United Kingdom.{{cn|date=December 2017}} Interest worldwide is growing and developing. There are a range of books and other materials now available and a burgeoning community of intensive interaction practitioners.

== Intended use ==

Intensive interaction is intended to address the needs of:
* People who are pre-verbal, with few or limited communicative behaviours.
* People who are extremely socially withdrawn, and do not positively interact with other people.
* People who display various stereotyped or self-stimulatory behaviours that exclude the participation of other people.[http://www.leedspft.nhs.uk/our_services/ld/intensiveinteraction]

The "fundamentals of communication" are typically referred to as being attainments such as:
* enjoying being with another person
* developing the ability to attend to that person
* concentration and [[attention span]]
* learning to do sequences of activity with the other person
* taking turns in exchanges of behaviour
* sharing [[personal space]]
* using and understanding [[eye contact]]s
* using and understanding [[facial expression]]s
* using and understanding [[physical contact]]s
* using and understanding [[non-verbal communication]]
* using vocalisations with meaning (for some, speech development)
* learning to regulate and control arousal levels

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14253">'''Investigations in Numbers, Data, and Space''' is a K–5 mathematics curriculum, developed at [[TERC (Cambridge, Massachusetts)|TERC]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terc.edu/ TERC]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], United States. The curriculum is often referred to as ''Investigations'' or simply ''TERC''. Patterned after the [[NCTM standards]] for mathematics, it is among the most widely used of the new [[reform mathematics]] curricula. As opposed to referring to textbooks and having teachers impose methods for solving arithmetic problems, the TERC program uses a [[Constructivist teaching methods|constructivist]] approach that encourages students to develop their own understanding of mathematics. The curriculum underwent a major revision in 2005–2007.

== History ==
''Investigations'' was developed between 1990 to 1998. It was just one of a number of reform mathematics curricula initially funded by a [[National Science Foundation]] grant. The goals of the project raised opposition to the curriculum from critics (both parents and mathematics teachers) who objected to the emphasis on conceptual learning instead of instruction in more recognized specific methods for basic arithmetic.

The goal of the ''Investigations'' curriculum is to help all children understand the fundamental ideas of number and arithmetic, geometry, data, measurement and early algebra. Unlike traditional methods, the original edition did not provide student textbooks to describe standard methods or provide solved examples. Instead, students were guided to develop their own invented algorithms through working with concrete representations of number such as manipulatives and drawings as well as more traditional number sentences. Additional activities include journaling, cutting and pasting, interviewing (for data collection) and playing conceptual games.

''Investigations'' released its second edition for 2006 that continues its focus on the core value of teaching for understanding. The revised version has further emphasis on basic skills and computation to complement the development of place value concepts and number sense.  It is also easier for teachers to use since the format is more user friendly{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}, though some districts have failed to carefully implement the second edition as well, and moved back to textbooks that teach traditional arithmetic methods.

== Research ==
A [[systematic review]] of research into Investigations was conducted by the [[U.S. Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education, Institute of Education Sciences]] and published as part of the [[What Works Clearinghouse]] in February 2013. This found "potentially positive effects" on mathematics achievement, supported by a "medium to large" evidence base.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Education, Institute of Education Sciences, What Works Clearinghouse (2013, February).  Elementary School Mathematics intervention report: Investigations in Number, Data, and Space®. Retrieved  from http://whatworks.ed.gov.&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of measures of student achievement and learning including state-mandated standardized tests, research-based interview protocols, items from research studies published in peer-reviewed journals and specially constructed paper-and-pencil tests have been used to evaluate the effectiveness of ''Investigations''

Research featured at the TERC website states that students who use ''Investigations'', among other things, "do as well or better than students using other curricula." To support the assertion that children do better when they are not taught traditional arithmetic, Anne Goodrow, in her PhD thesis at Tufts University, compared subtraction strategies of students taught traditional methods with those who used constructivist methods with ''Investigations curriculum''. Although negative numbers are not taught in the 2nd grade, "constructivist" student subtracting 9 from 28 explains that "8 minus 9 equals negative 1" and then argues that "-1 plus 20 is the same as 20-1 and equals 19."&lt;ref&gt;[http://investigations.terc.edu/impact/impact-studies/modesofteaching.cfm Modes of Teaching and Ways of Thinking Anne Goodrow TERC/Tufts University]&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of this, and of the average score of this group of 10 students, the author concluded that "although they did not receive instruction in the use of the standard algorithms, the children in the Constructivist group were the most successful at both two-digit addition and subtraction." Many research reports demonstrating the success of the program are criticized by opponents of this curriculum as having poor methodology or for being conducted by the publisher. NSF-sponsored curricula are required to conduct and report such studies, something that is not required of traditional mathematics textbooks. See also a recent study conducted with the revised edition, for more evidence of efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kehle|first=K|author2=N Essex |author3=D Lambdin |author4=K McCormick |title=What did they learn from Investigations?: A longitudinal study, grades 1 – 3|journal=Presented at the Research Presession of the Annual Meeting of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, Atlanta, Georgia|date=March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some school districts report their own data about success with the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Prince William County Public Schools|title=Data from years 1, 2, and 3|url=http://math.departments.pwcs.edu/modules/cms/pages.phtml?pageid=170035&amp;sessionid=9e13e2b8c419077977d0dcaf30788e0a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
''Investigations'' initially was commercially successful. But parents and math educators have criticized its lack of traditional arithmetic content, of decimal math, of multiplication tables, of division and multiplication of fractions, or even of addition and subtraction of ordinary fractions apart from a small subset, its emphasis on "kindergarten activities" (cutting, folding, taping, etc.) in class and homework, its lack of a traditional textbook; its incompatibility with high-school and international mathematics methods; its non-traditional homework assignments; its high cost (a concern mainly of home-schooling parents); and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wgquirk.com/TERC.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nychold.com/terc.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A common complaint{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} is that the curriculum does not teach any of traditional arithmetic methods familiar to those taught in other nations and to parents with as little as an elementary-school education. The critics assert that "the TERC computational methods are cumbersome, inefficient, and only work for carefully selected simple problems" and that "conscious thought is regularly required for both TERC method selection and TERC method execution" even at the simplest levels, thus precluding automaticity and the ability to focus conscious thought on higher-level cognitive tasks later on.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nychold.com/terc.html&lt;/ref&gt; TERC defenders' response is that the traditional arithmetic methods familiar to Americans are not necessarily those used in other nations.&lt;ref name="lda"&gt;{{cite web|title=Long division algorithms collected in the European Union|url=http://sites.google.com/site/algorithmcollectionproject/long-division-algorithms-collected-in-the-european-union}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mathematical Notation Comparisons Between U.S. and Latin American Countries|url=http://sites.google.com/site/algorithmcollectionproject/mathematical-notation-comparisons-between-u-s-and-latin-american-countries}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that students are capable of developing algorithms that are as correct, efficient, and generalizable as the "standard" algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawson|first=Alex|title=Learning Mathematics vs Following|url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/literacynumeracy/inspire/research/Lawson.pdf|publisher=What Works Clearinghouse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common parent complaint{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} is that there is no recognizable arithmetic and that homework is frequent and very time-consuming, with some tasks requiring help from family members and cutting, pasting, and coloring, whereas a traditional worksheet may take little time. Other critics{{who|date=January 2015}} claim that there is not enough homework, and children should simply be given a procedure and told to practice it on a large number of exercises.

===Non-traditional materials and content===
* Student materials included in the 2002 Grade 5 package for TERC ''Investigations'': 4 rolls of adding machine tape; 36 blank 5/8" cubes; 1,000 stickers for blank cubes; 200 1-cm cubes; 16 transparent blank spinners; 4 450-piece sets of power polygons; 4 buckets of square color tiles (400 per bucket); 1,000 Snap(TM) cubes; 1 set of elementary bar mass set-Ohaus; 4 graduated measuring prisms (2-cm x 5-cm x 21-cm); 4-liter measuring pitcher (calibrated 100 ml - 1,000 ml); 4 spectrum school balance (includes 7-piece mass set); 4 sets standard measuring pitchers (3 pitchers: quart, pint, cup per set); 10 measuring tapes; 12 meter/yard sticks.
*The total package for Grade 5 is listed at $1,388.42, and within that total the cost of the just mentioned student materials, for a class of 32, is $817.00&lt;ref&gt;[http://nychold.com/terc.html] Reviews of TERC&lt;/ref&gt; Many mathematics classrooms where active learning occurs already own many of these materials, so it is not necessary to purchase all of these items from the publisher.
* In the original edition, there was no multiplication table presented. Instead, students were instructed to color-code multiples of numbers on a 100s chart and evaluate these charts to find common multiples and patterns.
* There is no formal presentation of decimal addition. Students are instructed to begin by using colored pencils on 10,000 grid chart. The addition of decimals is related to students' work with whole number addition, with attention paid to place values so that students understand the reasoning behind lining up decimal points.
* Students are not instructed to compute an average by "adding up the items, and dividing by the number of items" because it is judged to be too complex for students of some groups to justify. Instead, the teacher is given a chapter on different ways to compute the median. Students using this curriculum could easily perform the calculation. It is important, however, to develop the underlying reasoning along with the procedure, which is done further into the data module rather than at the beginning.
* Students who demonstrate knowledge of a standard method of calculation are encouraged to demonstrate at least one other method of calculation, in order to demonstrate a complete understanding of the operation and numbers involved. Students who are later taught "standard" methods can be ready to compare and contrast methods, and be able to flexibly move among their options.
* Students are asked to compute the volume of a rectangular solid. They are do not immediately use and are not told the standard formula of length multiplied by width and height. This formula, which is the formula given on standardized tests such as the SAT, is developed as a connection to previous work with multiplication, area, and the associative property.

==Parody==

The textbook series has been parodied by the on-line cartoon series "Weapons of Math Destruction", including one panel of a student declaring that he can't finish his homework because they have run out of glue, or writing two different ways to determine if 2 is even or odd, and explaining the answer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weaponsofmathdestruction.com/wmd.cfm?comicID=17 |title=Weapons of Math Destruction Comics: Homework Strategies |date=10 May 2006 |accessdate=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weaponsofmathdestruction.com/wmd.cfm?comicID=24 |title=Weapons of Math Destruction Comics: No Glue? No Math. |date=9 August 2006 |accessdate=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adoptions==

An incomplete listing of school districts that have adopted TERC materials

* [[Bellevue School District]] adopted it for 10 years, dropped in favor of [[Math Expressions]] as "outdated and inefficient" for 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Bellevue Reporter March 22, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Stillwater School District]]
* [[Ridgewood Public Schools]]
* [[Seattle School District]]. Dropped in favor of [[Everyday Mathematics]] in 2007-08.
* [[Reading City Schools]] (Cincinnati, OH)
* [[Frederick County Public Schools (Maryland)]], dropped in 2011
* [[State College Area School District]] (State College, PA)
* [[Prince William County, VA Public Schools]] In 2009, a coalition of parents in Prince William County, VA sponsored a study of those districts cited in 2007 by Pearson publishing as having successfully adopted TERC Investigations. They found that many of these districts either had dropped the curriculum or were supplementing it with other materials. They consolidated and published their findings in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Survey of School Districts Profiled in Pearson Scott Foresman Publishers January 2007 Publication, Investigations in Number, Data, and Space: Evidence for Success|url=http://mysite.verizon.net/resu7qv4/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/misuccessjul09.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This list is indeed incomplete; there are hundreds of districts using this curriculum.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Zoophilia webpage incident==
In April 2003, an article appeared in the [[China Times]] claiming that Ho's website had several pages that not only covered the topic of [[zoophilia]], but actively promoted the practice, with images. 13 conservative groups collectively filed a complaint accusing Ho of making obscenities available to children.&lt;ref name=chen&gt;{{cite web |title=動物戀網頁事件何春蕤出書紀錄 |trans-title=Ho Chuen-juei releases book remembering the zoophilia webpage incident |last1=Chen 陳 |first1=Yijun 怡君 |date=13 November 2006 |access-date=17 February 2017 |url=http://www.lihpao.com/?action-viewnews-itemid-94702 |website=Lihpao Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[sensationalism]] led to thirteen Christian and conservative organisations collectively filing a complaint with the Taipei District Court. The process lasted for over one year, with a not guilty ruling returned on 15 September, 2004. The reason being that the zoophilia pages were only one part of the website's essays and reports, thus the incorporation of some pictures did not constitute an obscenity.&lt;ref name=apple&gt;{{cite web |title=網站連人獸交 何春蕤無罪確定 |trans-title=Website links to zoophilia: Ho Chuen-juei is ruled not guilty |date=9 September 2004 |access-date=17 February 2017 |url=http://www.appledaily.com.tw/appledaily/article/headline/20040916/1236140/ |website=Apple Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident has been seen as an example of [[sensationalism|sensationalist media]] and received international attention as a perceived confrontation between conservative aspects of Taiwanese society and [[sexual and reproductive health and rights|sexual freedom]].&lt;ref name=chen/&gt;&lt;ref name=sex&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sex.ncu.edu.tw/members/Ho/english_new/zoophilia.html |title=Zoophilia Hyperlink Incident |access-date=17 February 2017 |website=The Center for the Study of Sexualities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheldon''' ([[pen name]]s, '''Richard Hackstaff''', '''Stanley Norris''', '''Grace Shirley'''; April 11, 1862 – June 11, 1945) was an American author of novels, poems, and short stories, as well as a newspaper editor.{{sfn|Davis|1921|p=164}} Her published work amounted to over one million words. She claimed to have earned her living in fifteen different and totally dissimilar lines of business, including bookkeeping, business management, journalism, work in a chemical laboratory, buying dry goods, and writing stories.{{sfn|Green|1900|p=41-44}} She was a [[Women's suffrage in the United States|suffrage]] activist,{{sfn|Bodnar|1996|p=152}} and she opposed [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]].{{sfn|Holman|1919|p=284}}

Sheldon was the first poetess in the United States to use her talents for the [[Birth control movement in the United States|birth control movement]].{{sfn|Robinson|1918|p=77}} So many of Sheldon's poems appeared on the editorial page of ''[[The New York Times]]'' that her name became closely associated with that paper.{{sfn|Hills|Luce|1915|p=103-04}} She is also remembered for her "Marion Marlowe" [[dime novel]] series including ''My Queen'',{{sfn|Cox|2000|p=239}} which was an exception to the romance stories of the day where the heroine married at the end of the novel, leaving no compelling reason to write a sequel.{{sfn|Kelly|Bold|Raymond|2011|p=74}}

A medical education, coupled with opportunity for wide observation of the poor, gave Sheldon knowledge along sociological lines. One of her achievements was a sociological lecture in verse, entitled "The Alien," which was heard in New York and elsewhere in 1915. One poem of this lecture, "The Night Court," was widely read and copied. Sheldon was the author of several novels and serial stories, many short stories and special articles, and more than one thousand poems, the latter having appeared in nearly every magazine and paper of prominence in the U.S. For many years, she also wrote a large number of the unsigned verses.{{sfn|Hills|Luce|1915|p=103-04}}{{sfn|Cauldwell|1902|p=67}} Though without funds at the beginning of her career, she met every expense that she ever incurred without once asking for an "extension of time" or credit.{{sfn|Green|1900|p=41-44}}

==Early years and education==
Lurana Waterhouse Sheldon was born April 11, 1862, at [[Hadlyme, Connecticut]], the daughter of Asa Sheldon and Christiana F. (Waterhouse) Sheldon.{{sfn|Cox|2000|p=239}} She was of [[New England]] origin, her mother being a descendant of early [[Cape Cod]] settlers and her father the great grandchild of [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]],{{sfn|Davis|1921|p=164}} an eminent divine of the eighteenth century.{{sfn|Green|1900|p=41-44}}

Sheldon received the best education that a public and private school could give her.{{sfn|Green|1900|p=41-44}} In the fall of 1882, she matriculated with the [[New York Medical College|Woman's Medical College of the New York Infirmary]]. During her first year in college, Sheldon boarded at the New York Bible and Fruit Mission, and in her visits with that organization to [[Roosevelt Island|Blackwells Island]], [[Hart Island (New York)|Harts Island]], [[Randalls and Wards Islands|Wards Island]], and others, where the cities' paupers, lunatics, imbeciles, incurables and convicts were quartered, she saw enough to convince her that no such being as a God could exist and that the question of existence had only a physical basis.{{sfn|Green|1900|p=41-44}} After spending six years in the study and practice of medicine, she was obliged to abandon it because of threatened nervous prostration.{{sfn|Green|1900|p=41-44}}{{sfn|Cauldwell|1902|p=67}}

==Career==
===Medicine===
Sheldon spent two years at the Woman's Medical College of the New York Infirmary, and nearly seven years in hospitals, helping the physicians in many ways. Concerning her work in the Connecticut Hospital for the Insane, Dr. James M. Kenniston wrote about her in the ''Portland Express-Advertiser'', the largest paper in [[Maine]]:—{{sfn|Robinson|1918|p=77}}
{{quote|text="She came to the Connecticut Hospital for the Insane for a few weeks solely to le.arn by actual experience and research exactly how the insane were treated. Every opportunity was extended to her for investigation, and she was given the run of the entire place. Her thoroness in studying every phase of the work was only equalled by the success she achieved in winning the regards of the patients she met. Unlike some sane people, one thing is absolutely certain: all but those completely demented, whatever the form of their mental disorder, always recognize, abhor, and resent deceit and insincerity. Therefore they all loved Mrs Ferris, and their regret at her departure was genuine and sincere. As I have followed her literary and humanitarian course thru all these years, I can in part understand it by what I personally knew of her really-brilliant and fruitful investigations at the hospital.}}

===Writing===
Sheldon started earning her own living at the age of seventeen.{{sfn|Green|1900|p=41-44}} She began writing verses at the age of ten years, but it was not until she was twenty-five that she placed a monetary value upon her written work. From that time, she began filling in odd hours with her writing. Like many another prominent authors of her day, Sheldon's first successes were made through the columns of the ''[[Sunday Mercury (New York)|New York Mercury]]''.{{sfn|Cauldwell|1902|p=67}} Sheldon's poem entitled "The Medical Student's Dream," together with some prose work, was requested for the exhibit of [[New York (state)|New York State]] literature by the Board of Managers at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]] in 1893.{{sfn|Green|1900|p=41-44}}
[[File:Lurana Waterhouse Sheldon.png|thumb|Lurana Waterhouse Sheldon (1902)]]
By 1900, her published stories amounted to over two hundred and her humorous verses were known to every editor of a Sunday newspaper and pictorial weekly in the United States.{{sfn|Green|1900|p=41-44}} From 1900-02, she worked under contract with one of the large publishing houses of [[New York City]].{{sfn|Cauldwell|1902|p=67}} In one year alone (1900), Sheldon's published work amounted to over one million words, and not a week passed without a story from her pen appearing upon the bookstands. In 1901, Sheldon spent six months at [[Saratoga Springs, New York]] before returning to New York City, having benefitted by the change of air and long-continued rest.{{sfn|Cauldwell|1902|p=68}}

Sheldon wrote war poetry for ''[[The New York Times]]'', the ''[[Current History|New York Times Current History Magazine]]'', and ''[[Munsey's Magazine]]''.{{sfn|Wienen|2002|p=303}} Perhaps the best efforts of Sheldon were the occasional serious articles which appeared in various periodicals for advanced thought, for they demonstrated the writer to be not only an essayer of fiction, but also a writer of that mental calibre which was attained through profound thought and careful investigation.{{sfn|Cauldwell|1902|p=68}}

Sheldon published the greater part of her work under assumed names, or no name at all, partly through her own desire and partly through the injustice of editors. Her range of literary work extended from short [[Freethought]] articles for various liberal magazines, [[humor]] for Sunday newspapers, ghost stories and pathos for various monthlies, to thrilling tales of adventure for boys. Sheldon's affection for animals amounted almost to mania, and she declared in more than forcible language that "if she were possessed of great wealth, she would spend a large portion of it in trying to punish two classes of people—first, the class who neglect or ill-treat animals, and, second, the men and women who bring children into the world without a clean bill of health, morals or temperament, to say nothing of sufficient wealth to insure them against hardship."{{sfn|Green|1900|p=41-44}}

Her published work consisted of seven novels, about two hundred short stories, more than one thousand poems, and many articles on scientific and sociological subjects.{{sfn|Robinson|1918|p=77}}

===Religion and Freethought===
Sheldon was brought up an orthodox [[Congregationalist]], but her doubts ripened early and reaped their harvest. The God of the [[Bible]] soon became in her eyes not only a "moral monstrosity" but an "inconceivable hypothesis," and she saw no shadow of reason in the "vicarious atonement." A God who creates beings with an "inclination" toward evil furnishes the temptation for the committing of said evil, and then punishes his own creatures for acting out the impulses of their natures, was a being whom she could not and would not worship. In early life, she read Dodd, Drummond, and [[John Stuart Mill]], and studied the Bible with a concordance, besides spending many hours praying for enlightenment on these subjects, but the only knowledge which she could glean that in any way satisfied her common sense and reason came later in the study of [[Ludwig Büchner]], [[Aldous Huxley]], [[Charles Darwin]], and [[Herbert Spencer]], and in company with such intellects as these she soon realized that she was beyond the need of faith in the undemonstrable vagaries of superstition.{{sfn|Green|1900|p=41-44}}

When she asked for suitable employment for a woman of her intelligence at the Woman's Christian Association, she was requested to tell her family history, declare her faith in God and give up a percentage of her earnings for a servant's position. She declined with thanks and went her own way. It was another argument in favor of the utter worthlessness of Christian teachings.{{sfn|Green|1900|p=41-44}} Whether Sheldon's religious infidelity was a reaction of Edward Jonathan's piety, she did not know, but if this was the case, to quote her own words, "the bigotry of the pious gentleman with the ten children was not in vain, it resulted in freeing at least one brain from the thraldom of inherent superstition."{{sfn|Green|1900|p=41-44}}

She struggled to "keep her head above water" in a large city like New York, without money in her pocket. It was the injustice of human nature, what she considered to be the so-called handiwork of God, that prompted her to an occasional effort in the Freethought direction, "not but that people are welcome to any faith they choose but because a God that one could respect must be a welcome innovation." Such a God she found in "science". "Faith", "hope", and "love" represented nothing to her but the highest possible achievement of the physical organism, yet they lost nothing of their value springing from a source that was both reasonable and demonstrable. The little help and favors which she received through life did not come from churches, home missions or Christians. For years, she visited the outcasts of New York City with the members of some so-called "mission" or other, but the spectacle of some hypocrite, exhorting an honest sinner to "be good," was too much of a strain for a candid nature. Said Sheldon: "I have found the happiness of life in the companionship of books, animals and an occasional true frienc' and the satisfaction in dividing a dollar with one more destitute than myself. The rest is only a panorama of injustice and folly, a farce in which serious things, like child-bearing, are treated indifferently, and absurd matters like the salvation of a soul, which we do not know exists, are carried to the extreme of bloodshed and torture."{{sfn|Green|1900|p=41-44}}

==Personal life==
Though Sheldon was troubled by poor health,{{sfn|Cauldwell|1902|p=67}} she traveled in the United States, [[Nova Scotia]], and [[Newfoundland]]. She felt that no woman was ever contented with less of the world's goods than she was, and felt that the bitterness of life lay in unrewarded merit. She lived alone in a flat and shunned society for the reason that "the only people whom she ever agrees with are found in books, and she is tired of coming in contact with their ignorant maligners." She had no desire to pose as a reformer, but it was a constant source of irritation to her that people who were in position to do so did not avail themselves of the opportunity to improve existing conditions a little.{{sfn|Green|1900|p=41-44}}

Of her hardships, Sheldon refused to talk, on the grounds that a "tale of woe" was never interesting to anyone but the teller. To quote her own words, she was "endowed with an inheritance of poverty, poor health and ambition, which prove, under any environments, a damnable mixture." With this handicap, she was forced to begin the struggle of life and, to add to her difficulties, she declared further she "was born with a spirit which could not tolerate rebuke and a mettle which would yield to no discipline whatever. I felt that I bad been wronged from the hour of my conception," she said, "and a feeling of resentment was the first sentiment of my nature." With this sentiment predominating, Sheldon could not and would not tread the only paths which were open to women in her position; she was determined to travel on the plane of her own inclinations or not travel at all, and her course was marked at every step with the bruises of collision with obstacles which a more acquiscent nature would not have encountered.{{sfn|Green|1900|p=41-44}}

Sheldon was a prominent suffragist. In 1916 in [[Maine]], she founded the Women's Defense Club with a purpose to "instruct American women to shoot, and shoot straight".{{sfn|Jeffery|2016|p=349}}

On November 20, 1904, (or November 20, 1903) she married Judge Isaac F. Ferris of [[York County, Maine]], who had been a journalist in his early career.{{sfn|A.N. Marquis Company|1938|p=463}} Childless, she died in Maine on June 11, 1945.{{sfn|Cox|2000|p=239}}

'''Dame Marie Rambert, Mrs Dukes''' [[Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire|DBE]] (20 February 1888{{spaced ndash}}12 June 1982) was a Polish-born dancer and [[Pedagogy|pedagogue]] who exerted great influence on British ballet, both as a dancer and teacher.

==Early years and background==
Born to a liberal [[Jew]]ish family in [[Warsaw]], [[Congress Poland]], she was originally named '''Cyvia (Cesia) Rambam'''. Her father and two of his brothers later changed their last names to make them seem [[only child]]ren in order to escape military service in the [[Imperial Russian Army]];&lt;ref name=jewishwomen&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=eSIhzKnNUf4C&amp;pg=PA396 Marie Rambert]," in: [[Adrian Room]], ''Dictionary of Pseudonyms'', 5th ed., Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2010, p. 396. This was not an uncommon practice among Jews in the Russian Empire.&lt;/ref&gt; and so, while one brother retained the name Rambam, her father changed his to '''Ramberg''', another of his brothers went to '''Rambert''', and the last changed his name to '''Warszawski'''. She changed her name to '''Myriam Ramberg''', and finally left it in the [[French language|French]] form ''Marie Rambert''. In later years she was known to friends and dancers as Mim.

Her father, [[Yakov Ramberg]] (1855–1928), born in [[Vištytis]], a small town in [[Suwałki Governorate]] (nowadays in [[Lithuania]]), was a learned merchant and Hebrew publisher and lexicographer, and a [[Zionism|Zionist]]. Her mother, Eiga Ramberg née Lap, born in the town of [[Suchowola]] (nowadays in north-east [[Poland]]), daughter of Rabbi Elhanan Tzvi Lap, was a community worker.&lt;ref&gt;"Ramberg, Eiga," in: ''Sefer Halshim: Lexicon Eretzyisra'eli'', Tel Aviv: Masada, 5697 [1937], p. 2023. (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

Rambert was the fourth of seven children. The eldest child, Rakhel, was the wife of Hebrew writer [[Micha Josef Berdyczewski]]. The second, Ewa Ramberg-Figulla, was a [[Slavist]], the wife of German [[Hittitologist]] Hugo Heinrich Figull and mother of physicist Johannes Figulla&lt;ref&gt;[[Avner Holtzman]], ''An Image Before my Eyes'', Tel Aviv: Am Oved (''Ofakim''), 2001, pp. 29–33, 240 (Hebrew). Rambert had a third older Sister, Wella Alapin; younger twin siblings, Hanan and Dvora; and another young brother, Eliezer (Julius) (''ibid'').&lt;/ref&gt; (father-in-law of German writer [[Christoph Hein]] and grandfather of German writer [[Jakob Hein]]).

Rambert met her husband [[Ashley Dukes]], a soldier on leave, at a dinner party in 1917. In Rambert's autobiography she says "after four days of personal meetings, and seven months of correspondence we were married on 3 March 1918."&lt;ref&gt;Marie Rambert, "Quicksilver: Autobiography" (London: St Martin's Press, 1972), p. 94. {{ISBN|978-0333347119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was done partly as a joke so that Dukes could get four weeks of extended leave instead of two days.  Their marriage lasted 41 years, until he died in 1959; the couple had two daughters, Angela (1920–2006) and Helena.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}  The poet, Aidan Andrew Dun, is her grandson.

==Training==
Rambert began her dance training in her schooling early on. Subjects like foreign languages and history seemed to come easy; however she was a restless child and ended up getting bad marks because of her endless movements during class. At one point in her early training her dance instructor stated that 'In her, was the true spirit of dance.'&lt;ref&gt;Mary Clark and Marie Rambert "Dancers of Mercury; the story of Ballet Rambert" (London, A &amp; C Black, 1962), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; She was unimpressed with the structure and performance of ballet, and was not drawn into dance as a passion until she became enthralled by [[Isadora Duncan]] when she attended one of Duncan's performances, and was 'profoundly moved by the beauty of Duncan's dance.'&lt;ref&gt;Marie Rambert, "Quicksilver", page 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, after becoming active in political riots, and the tragic day of May Day, Rambert's parents urged her at one point to move to Paris and take up medicine while safely living with her aunt and uncle who were also doctors. She attended a party where she danced a mazurka and danced it with such liveliness that there was applause afterwards; this was her first performance, whether she thought it or not. She met [[Raymond Duncan]], brother of Isadora, at this same party, who congratulated her on a wonderful performance, and again she was back into her passion for dance. She studied with Madame Rat from the [[Ballet de l'Opéra National de Paris|Paris Opera]], and later studied with [[Émile Jaques-Dalcroze]], at Dalcroze College who introduced her to [[eurhythmics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nijinska|first1=Bronislava|editor1-last=Nijinska|editor1-first=Irina|title=Bronislava Nijinska: Early Memoirs|date=1981|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|location=New York|isbn=0-03-020951-X|pages=454–455|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One day at the Dalcroze College, [[Sergei Diaghilev]], watched a class and then asked her to come back to Berlin and study with him in the [[Ballets Russes]]. There, Rambert aided them with figuring out [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' with [[Vaslav Nijinsky]]. She hesitantly accepted and collaborated with the Ballets Russes led by Diaghilev from 1912–1913. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In Ballet Russes she was in the corps de ballet for ballet performances such as ''Swan Lake'', ''Giselle'', and ''Scheherazade''. After a tour with Nijinsky and Ballet Russes, Rambert's contract was not continued and she decided it was time for a new chapter. In 1914 she moved to the United Kingdom, and studied under [[Enrico Cecchetti]].&lt;ref&gt;Jane Pritchard, "Rambert: A Celebration of the Company’s First Seventy Years" (London, Rambert Dance Company 1996), pp. 13–20.&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ballet Rambert==
[[File:Marie Rambert 19 Campden Hill Gardens blue plaque.jpg|thumb|Blue plaque, 19 Campden Hill Gardens, London]]
After studying with Cecchetti, she went back to study with Madame Rat at the Paris Opera, and took her studies quite seriously. She began teaching more ballet classes in 1919 and later founded her own ballet school in [[Bedford Gardens, London|Bedford Gardens]]. In 1926 she created her own company, originally named [[Ballet Club]]. It has been through many name changes, much like Rambert herself. The company began performing at night revues in London. The first informal show was performed in ''Riverside Nights'' at the [[Lyric Theatre (Hammersmith)|Lyric Theatre]], and continued with the nightly revues for a while. She began finding new and promising dancers and choreographers in numerous places, such as [[Frederick Ashton]], to be a part of her company and gave them a chance to grow. From '''Marie Rambert Dancers''', the company changed to [[Ballet Rambert]] , later  [[Rambert Dance Company]], and from 2014 just named [[Rambert Dance Company|Rambert]], a [[contemporary dance]] company which tours internationally. It dates its birth to the first performance of [[Frederick Ashton]]'s ''A Tragedy of Fashion'' (1926)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rambert.org.uk/explore/rambert-archive/rambert-history-infographics/|title=Infographic on Rambert early history|last=|first=|date=2017|website=Rambert.org.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, making it the first ballet company in Britain.

Ashley Dukes, Marie's husband, renovated a building and made it into [[Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill Gate|Mercury Theatre]], where the majority of Ballet Rambert's performance occurred. It was said that 'Notting Hill Gate, where the Mercury Theatre stood, was on the slopes of Olympus'.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Pritchard, "Celebration", p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Ballet Rambert has performed such ballets as ''Coppelia'', as well as Balanchine's ''Night Shadow''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rambert.org.uk/performance-database/|title=Rambert Performance Database|last=|first=|date=15 October 2018|website=Rambert|archive-url=http://www.rambert.org.uk/performance-database/|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Rambert was adamant about finding new and upcoming choreographers. Some of her students and later her colleagues included Ashton, [[Antony Tudor]], and [[Agnes de Mille]], to name a few. In 1965 Rambert, with the help of "[[Norman Morrice]], her newest discovery, completely reorganized the company to stress modern dance".&lt;ref&gt;Jack Anderson,"Ballet and Modern Dance: A Concise History", (Princeton, New Jersey Book Company, 1986), p. 185. {{ISBN|0916622428}} and {{ISBN|0916622436}}&lt;/ref&gt; The repertoire of the company eventually came back to more contemporary ballets, but still has a vast list of pieces that the company has performed throughout the years. She cooperated with Millicent Hodson {{Who|date=May 2014}} to restore [[Vaslav Nijinsky|Nijinsky]]'s choreography of ''The Rite of Spring'' in 1979. The restoration of choreography was completed in 1987. Rambert is known for helping to create and keep the ballet community strong in Britain. ''"The creation of Ballet in Britain is one of the grandest achievements in the artistic annals of our century. It is owed absolutely to the idealism which fired Rambert and [[Ninette de Valois]]"'',&lt;ref&gt;Jane Pritchard, "Celebration", p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; the founder of [[The Royal Ballet]]. She was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' in 1962 when she was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]] at the [[Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill Gate]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Death==
She died on 12 June 1982 and was cremated at [[Golders Green Crematorium]] on 17 June. Her ashes are within the Cloister Walk in section B.

{{Politics of Peru}}
The '''Ministry of Education''' in [[Peru]] was created on February 4, 1837, in times of fervor caudillista and republican agitation of a country that arises to the independent life, don Andrés de Santa Cruz, Captain general and President of Bolivia, Big Pacifying Marshall of Peru, Supreme Protector of the North and South Peruvian States decides to create a Department with the title of Department of Public Instruction, Charity and Ecclesiastic Business.

==The promulgation of the Decree==
Considering:

*I. That, for the biggest advance of the public education, to which the Government contracts the most scrupulous attention, his most determined protection, it is convenient to separate the business belonging to this branch, of which they get out of debt for the Department of the Interior.
*The II. That for the homogeneity of this branch of the administration with the ecclesiastic business and the relative ones to the Charity, it would be suitable to assemble the three in a Department exclusively destined for his office.

It delivered a judgment:

*Art. 1.-creates to Himself a Department with the title of Department of public Instruction, Charity and Ecclesiastic Business, for which there will serve themselves all the matters relative to these three ramifications.
*Art. 2.-There Will be in this Department an official 1ero., the 2nd one. and one 3ero. That runs with the file and a doorman. Two of them will be extracted of the Department of the Interior and they all will enjoy equal salary that the employees in this one of the same class.
*Art.3. - The Minister of State of the office of the Interior remains entrusted of the execution of this decree, and of ordering it to print, to publish and to circulate.

Given in the Palace protectoral of Lima, on February 4, 1837. Signed by Andrés Santa Cruz by order of S.E. José Maria Galdiano ". (It is a faithful copy of the original one that Nro appears in the " ECHO OF THE PROTECTORATE ". 50).

The Department originally called of Public Instruction, Charity and Ecclesiastic Business, is provided proudly with three employees. On the following day the chart increased with the appointment of the first Minister of the Sector, the Presbítero doctor Manuel Gaspar de Villarán and Loli. On having divided equally the 19th century, General Castilla promulgates the first Regulation of Education, which establishes the separation between public and private education, at the same time the school Guadalupe is declared National school and the professorship as public career is established.

==Some additional milestones==
*Don Mariano Ignacio Prado in 1866 regulates the Higher education and Sunday free schools are established.
*With Don José Balta in 1870, free schools settle in the capitals of districts.
*With Manuel Pardo in 1872 and from now on, big impulse happens to the education, creating to him the Schools of Agriculture, Engineering, Industry and Fine arts.
*Later, Mariano Ignacio Prado in 1876-1877 organizes the Normal School of Women and that of Males.
*On having begun this century with Eduardo López de Romaña, the Organic Law of Public Instruction happens, including the Top Council of Instruction and the first Fiscal Schools are established.
*During the successive governments, the legislation of the sector education suffers many transformations. This way, for example, in 1907, during the Government of Brown and Barreda, the Secondary Instruction is established in five years.
*In 1935, Justice and Worship come undone of the Department of Education (Oscar R. Benavides).
*In 1941, it is established the Day of the Teacher under the government of Manuel Prado y Ugarteche.
*With Manuel Odría between the year 1948 and 1953, he constructs himself the building of the University Park, creates to him the system of Palms Magisteriales, and many schools and school units are constructed for men and women, as well as four military schools.
*In 1971, the [[National Institute of Culture]] is created as Public Decentralized Organism.
*In the decade of the 70s, one tests a complex and ambitious project of reform that gives birth to a leafy normatividad. Big impulse happens to the Initial Education and from the 80s, also to the development of the Higher education.
*From 1980 to 1985, there is established the so-called quinquennium of the education (the second Government of Belaúnde Terry. From 1990, there happens a new Law of the Professorship and his Regulation.
*In 1991, when he declares himself in reorganization to all the entities of the Public Sector, there begins the rationalization of the teaching and administrative personnel of the Department
*In 1992, there is transferred the National Institute of Educational Infrastructure (INIED) to the Department of the Presidency. There is promulgated the new Organic Law of the Department of Education, the Law of Communal Participation in the Management and Educational Administration, and the Law of Improvement of the Quality and Enlargement of the Coverage of the Peruvian Education.
*In 1993, there are promulgated a new regulation of Organization and Functions of the Department, and the rationalization becomes effective with the cessation of workpeople of the sector, for reorganization. From then the Peruvian education has experienced big changes and enormous progresses as for infrastructure and quality, although it is still great what stays for advancing.

In the Trajectory of the Department of Education there was, for diverse political and economic circumstances, both, gaps and moments of big stellar sheen and the out-standing ministers. For example, when he was the Minister Agustín Guillermo Charún (1839), Don Benito Lazo, the doctor Manuel Pérez de Tudela in 1845, the latter author of the Record of the Independence. In 1851, during the Government of Echenique Don Bartolomé Blacksmith he was nominated an Education Secretary, and in 1867 Don Simeón Tejada was named by Don Mariano Ignacio Prado.

'''Edna Moscelyne Larkin Jasinski''' (January 14, 1925&amp;nbsp;– April 25, 2012) was one of the "[[Five Moons]]", [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[ballerina]]s from [[Oklahoma]] who gained international fame in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=tulsa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/scene/article.aspx?subjectid=272&amp;articleid=20120427_272_D1_CUTLIN221088|title=One of the five Oklahoma Indian Ballerinas Larkin dies at 87|publisher=Tulsa World|date=April 27, 2012|accessdate=April 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After dancing with the [[Original Ballet Russe]] and the [[Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo]], she and her husband settled in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], where in 1956 they founded the [[Tulsa Ballet]] and its associated school. It became a major regional company in the [[American Southwest]] and made its [[New York City]] debut in  1983. She is portrayed in the mural ''Flight of Spirit'' displayed in the Rotunda of the [[Oklahoma State Capitol]] building.

==Early life and education==
Edna Moscelyne Larkin was born in [[Miami, Oklahoma]] in 1925, the only daughter of Eva Matlagova-Larkin, a young dancer from [[Russia]], and Rueben Francis Larkin (1893–1974), an [[Eastern Shawnee]]-[[Peoria Indian]]. Her mother trained her in ballet until the girl was old enough to move to [[New York City]] to further her studies. There she studied under Vincenzo Celli, [[Mikhail Mordkin]], and Anatole Vilzak-Shollar.&lt;ref name="foster"&gt;Foster, Toni Annette. [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/L/LA023.html Moscelyne Larkin profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309104816/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/L/LA023.html |date=2009-03-09 }}, Oklahoma Historical Society ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History &amp; Culture'' (2009); retrieved February 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dancing career==
In 1941, at age 15, Larkin joined Colonel [[Wassily de Basil]]'s [[Original Ballet Russe]].&lt;ref name="lili"&gt;Livingston, Lili Cockerille. ''American Indian Ballerinas''. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 1999: xix.&lt;/ref&gt; She performed with the company in Europe and the Americas. While dancing with the company, Larkin met her future husband [[Roman Jasinski]], a ''premier danseur'' from [[Poland]].&lt;ref name="jasinski"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/17/obituaries/roman-jasinski-83-ex-dancer-and-a-leader-in-regional-ballet.html ''New York Times'' obituary for Roman Jasinski]. Retrieved November 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, she achieved the rank of ballerina; she and her husband had both moved to the [[Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo]], directed by [[Serge Denham]].&lt;ref name="lili"/&gt; [[Radio City Music Hall]] often showcased her as a prima ballerina.&lt;ref name="foster"/&gt; In 1954 Larkin toured Asia, performing in [[Alexandra Danilova]]'s "Great Movements in Dance". She excelled in comical roles as a ''[[soubrette]]''. She played the  [[can-can]] dancer in ''[[Gaîté Parisienne]]''. [[Agnes de Mille]], the choreographer and dancer, admired Larkin's performance as the [[Cowgirl]] in [[Aaron Copland]]'s ''[[Rodeo (Copland)|Rodeo]]'', a role which was premiered by de Mille.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, James D., Jr. [http://www.tulsaworld.com/webextra/itemsofinterest/centennial/centennial_storypage.asp?ID=070715_1_CE11_ATTSJ15125 "Breathing life through dance"], ''The Tulsa World''. July 15, 2007. Retrieved February 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family==
Larkin married Roman Jasinski in 1943. After they had a son, Roman Larkin Jasinski, on February 21, 1954, they decided to retire from performing. They moved to [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], where they created a ballet school and founded the Tulsa Civic Ballet (later known as the [[Tulsa Ballet]]). It became a major company in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] and made its premier in New York in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/17/obituaries/roman-jasinski-83-ex-dancer-and-a-leader-in-regional-ballet.html Jack Anderson, "Roman Jasinski, 83, Ex-Dancer And a Leader in Regional Ballet"], ''New York Times'', April 17, 1991, accessed March 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Larkin introduced area schoolchildren to ballet and also taught ballet to higher level students at the [[University of Tulsa]].&lt;ref name="foster"/&gt;

==Honors==
In 1967, [[Quapaw]]-[[Cherokee]] composer [[Louis Ballard]] wrote the music for the ballet, ''The Four Moons'', for the Oklahoma Indian Ballerina Festival. The ballet honors the [[Five Moons]]: Larkin, [[Yvonne Chouteau]], [[Rosella Hightower]], and sisters [[Maria Tallchief|Maria]] and [[Marjorie Tallchief]]. In its solos, the dancers evoked their four distinct tribal cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Everett, Dianna.

Oklahoma Historical Society. ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History &amp; Culture'' (2009), retrieved February 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Larkin was inducted into the [[Oklahoma Hall of Fame]] in 1978. In 1988, she received the annual ''[[Dance Magazine]]'' Award. In 1993, she was inducted in the [[Oklahoma Women's Hall of Fame]]. The Council of American Indians honored her as "Outstanding Indian" that same year. [[Chickasaw]] artist [[Mike Larsen]] included Larkin in his monumental mural, ''[[Flight of Spirit]]'', displayed in the Great Rotunda of the [[Oklahoma State Capitol]] in [[Oklahoma City]].&lt;ref name="foster"/&gt;

==Death==

The '''National Bible Bee''' is a Bible contest held for the first time in 2009 by the Shelby Kennedy Foundation. The competition starts with local contests across the [[United States]]. The top 120 contestants from each age group (Primary, ages 7–10; Junior, ages 11–14; Senior, ages 15–18) advance to the National level. The first national competition was held in [[Washington, D.C.]] on November 5–6, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news-reporter.com/news/2009/0326/personalities/029.html |title=First Baptist offering enrollment in National Bible Bee program |date=March 26, 2009 |work=The News-Reporter |accessdate=April 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than $100,000 in prize money is awarded each year.

== Origins and philosophy ==
The National Bible Bee is sponsored by the Shelby Kennedy Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianpost.com/Education/General/2009/01/-bible-bee-deadline-draws-near-communities-urged-to-register-26/index.html |title=‘Bible Bee’ Deadline Draws Near; Communities Urged to Register |last=Leichmann |first=Aaron J. |date=26 January 2009 |work=[[The Christian Post]] |accessdate=April 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shelby Kennedy, who died of cancer at the age of 23, spent her life studying the [[Bible]] and proclaiming Christ. After her death, The Shelby Kennedy Foundation, was established as a non-profit in her name to encouraging children and youth to memorize Scripture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christiannewswire.com/news/257988651.html |title=Introducing the National Bible Bee |last=Rasche |first=Kit |date=November 11, 2008 |work=Christian News Wire |accessdate=April 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Bible Bee promises large cash prizes for nine of the top-place finalists.&lt;ref name="nationals"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biblebee.org/biblebee_nationals |title=Nationals 2010 |work=National Bible Bee |accessdate=March 2, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305093001/http://www.biblebee.org/biblebee_nationals/ |archivedate=March 5, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the local and national competition involve oral and written tests. The goal of the Bible Bee is to  encourage young people in the [[Christianity|Christian]] faith, by becoming more biblically literate. Their vision is "To know God's Word and make Him known."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biblebee.org/_aboutus/aboutus.php |title=About us |work=National Bible Bee |accessdate=March 2, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307054407/http://www.biblebee.org/_aboutus/aboutus.php |archivedate=March 7, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Competition ==
Competition is divided into local and national levels. The local competition is not administrated directly by the Shelby Kennedy Foundation, but rather by separate entities known as Hosts. Though these groups are not legally related to the Shelby Kennedy Foundation, they are the only source of finalists for the national competition. The highest-scoring contestants in each age category proceed to the national competition. In 2009, National Bible Bee was held at the [[Marriot International|J.W. Marriott Hotel]] in Washington, D.C..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biblebee.org/userfiles/image/National%20Website%20Material/2009%20NBB%20Competition%20Contestant%20Rules_091005_FINAL.pdf |title=2009 NBB Competition Contest |work=National Bible Bee |accessdate=April 23, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306204833/http://www.biblebee.org/userfiles/image/National%20Website%20Material/2009%20NBB%20Competition%20Contestant%20Rules_091005_FINAL.pdf |archivedate=March 6, 2014 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 competition was held at the Marriott Renaissance Hotel and Conference Center in Schaumburg, Illinois.&lt;ref name="nationals" /&gt;
The 2011 National Bible Bee was held in Nashville, Tennessee, and the 2012 and 2013 National Bible Bee was held at the Wilderness Stone Hill Lodge and Sevierville Events Center in Sevierville, Tennessee. The 2014 National Bible Bee competition was held in Orlando, Florida at the Hilton Orlando Lake Buena Vista. It was announced in the spring of 2015 that the National competitions of 2015, 2016, and 2017 would be held at the J.W. Marriott San Antonio Hill Country Resort &amp; Spa in San Antonio, TX. The 2015 competition occurred on November 18-22, 2015. The 2018 competition will be held at Oak Hills Church in San Antonio, December 3-7.&lt;ref&gt;biblebee.org&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eligibility ===
Eligibility for the National Bible Bee is restricted to United States citizens, including residents of the [[District of Columbia]] and children of U.S. Armed Forces personnel stationed overseas.  Non-legal residents may compete on the local level but may not advance to the National competition. Close relatives of the Shelby Kennedy Foundation members or others who have worked on the contest content are allowed to compete; however, they may not win prize money at the National Bible Bee Contest.

Contestants are divided into three age divisions: Primary (ages 7–10), Junior (ages 11–14) and Senior (ages 15–18).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsminer.com/news/2009/apr/01/bible-bee-planned/ |title=Bible Bee planned |date=April 1, 2009 |work=[[Fairbanks Daily News-Miner]] |accessdate=April 15, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Study materials ===
The Bible Bee's competition material includes both memory work and an in-depth study on a selected book or portion of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biblebee.org/biblebee_overview/overview.php |title=Bible Bee Overview |work=National Bible Bee |accessdate=March 2, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307053747/http://www.biblebee.org/biblebee_overview/overview.php |archivedate=March 7, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contestants are required to memorize a number of verses. In the preliminary oral round, the contestants must recite the passages they are asked word-for-word from any of five approved English versions ([[KJV]], [[NKJV]], [[New American Standard Bible|NASB]], [[New International Version|NIV]] or [[English Standard Version|ESV]]). Scores are given based on the accuracy of the contestant's recitation. In addition, comprehension of the memory verses is tested in a multiple-choice computer-based test.

==== Bible knowledge ====
In 2009, all the contestants were to study [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[Books of Samuel|1 &amp; 2 Samuel]], [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]], and [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]].  

Starting in 2010, all contestants receive a ''Discovery Journal,'' which is a study guide for a single book or passage of the Bible. Comprehension of this book of the Bible is tested through an online test. Parents receive a Parent Guidebook, which contains guidelines for helping their children study that book of the Bible.

The Bible knowledge book for 2010 was [[Epistle to the Colossians|Colossians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblebee.org/_pages/materials.php|title=Bible Bee Materials|author=|date=|work=National Bible Bee|publisher=|accessdate=June 26, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604004635/http://www.biblebee.org/_pages/materials.php|archivedate=June 4, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bible knowledge book for 2011 was [[1 Peter]].
As of 2011, the contestants who advanced to Nationals were given a new book of the Bible to study, which was announced when the National competitors were announced. In 2011, this book was [[2 Peter]].

The Bible knowledge book for 2012 was [[2 Timothy]]. The book the contestants were to study for nationals in 2012 was [[1 Timothy]].

The Bible knowledge book for 2013 was [[1 John]]. The book the contestants studied for nationals in 2013 was [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]].

The Bible knowledge book for 2014 was [[Jonah]]. The book the contestants studied for nationals in 2014 was [[Nahum]].

The Bible knowledge passage for 2015 was Chapters 1-6 of [[Gospel of John|John]]. The passage the contestants studied for nationals in 2015 was Chapters 7-12 of [[Gospel of John|John]].

The Bible knowledge passage for 2016 was Chapter 13-15 of John. The passage the contestants studied for nationals in 2016 was the book of 1 John.

The Bible knowledge passage for 2017 was Chapters 1-3 of Genesis. The book the contestants studied for nationals in 2017 was the book of Colossians.

The Bible knowledge passage for 2018 is James. The book the contestants will study for nationals is Philippians.

=== Competition format ===

120 contestants are chosen from each age division to compete at the national competition in the fall. All contestants participate in a preliminary round featuring both a written exam and an oral recitation round.  The semi-finals feature the top 15 contestants from each division competing in a single-elimination recitation format for five spots in the final challenge round. The format for finals changed from the format used in previous years.  Round 1 featured each of the 5 finalists reciting a passage from memory, with points deducted for errors.  The maximum points for round 1 was 3,000 points.  Rounds 2-5 were open-ended Bible knowledge questions where contestants were given 30 seconds to write their answer on an [[iPad]] tablet.  Each question was worth 1,000 points.  Round 6 again required contestants to recite a passage from memory worth 3,000 points.  The total possible points for the final challenge round was 10,000 points, with winners being determined by their cumulative scores from all 6 rounds.  Ties were broken by using the contestant's scores from the preliminary round at the national competition.

'''Progressive Education Network''' is a [[non-profit organization]] that seeks to improve [[Education in Pakistan|public education]] in [[Pakistan]] by ''adopting'' schools and by entering into partnerships with companies that pledge to assist schools in their area. Its main focus is on [[primary school]]s. The company was started by seven professional friends and adopted its first schools in [[Lahore]] in 2010. Its chief executive officer is Omar Khayyam Sheikh.&lt;ref name=Today/&gt;

== History ==
Progressive Education Network was founded by a group of seven friends, professionals, businessmen, and educators, who wanted to improve public education in Pakistan as a means of assisting people from the lower end of society. They decided to adopt existing schools rather than building their own, and studied models such as [[BRAC (NGO)|BRAC]], [[Citizens Foundation]] and [[CARE (relief agency)|CARE]].&lt;ref name=Today&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2014/01/25/national/pen-seeking-to-provide-quality-education-to-a-million-children-by-2025/ |title=PEN: Seeking to provide quality education to a million children by 2025 |newspaper=Pakistan Today |date=January 25, 2014 |type=interview|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Arif Butt |author2=Shezeen Hemani |url=https://hbr.org/product/progressive-education-network-pen-creating-social-impact-in-pakistan/NA0204-PDF-ENG |title=Case Study: Progressive Education Network (PEN): Creating Social Impact in Pakistan |journal=Harvard Business Review |date=October 1, 2012|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They incorporated the company as a non-profit with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan]] under Section 42 of the Companies Ordinance 1984; it has been certified by the Pakistan Centre for Philanthropy as adhering to best practices for non-profits.&lt;ref name=Today/&gt; 

In 2010 the company adopted its first schools, in Lahore, with a total of more than 6,000 students. Initially the founders and their friends funded it themselves; subsequently they developed sponsorship relationships with for-profit companies, including a Good Neighbor Program through which a company sponsors assistance to schools in its locality. They have declared a goal of improving the education of 1&amp;nbsp;million children throughout Pakistan by 2025.&lt;ref name=Today/&gt; By January 2014, it had expanded to schools totaling almost 11,000 students in a number of locations in Pakistan, including [[Karachi]], [[Gujrat City|Gujrat]] and [[Muzaffargarh]].&lt;ref name=Today/&gt; {{As of|2016|07}}, it had adopted 89 schools with almost 23,500 students and had signed an agreement to adopt 50 schools in [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1135083/non-profit-take-charge-50-public-schools/ |title=Non-profit to take charge of 50 public schools |newspaper=The Express Tribune |date=July 3, 2016|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
Progressive Education Network adopts state schools through a public-private partnership; it is one of several groups using this method to improve education in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Rabea Malik |author2=Faisal Bari |author3=et al |url=http://ideaspak.org/images/Publications/Human-Development/Public-Private-Partnerships-Education-Report.pdf |title=Partnerships for Management in Education: Evidence from Punjab and Sindh |publisher=Institute of Development and Economic Alternatives |date=August 2015 |type=research report }}&lt;/ref&gt; It works to improve them by improving their infrastructure, for example toilet facilities, drinking water, and classroom furniture, and monitoring teachers, hiring additional teachers to reduce class sizes, and providing teacher training during the summer and winter holidays. The company also provides staff to clean schools twice a day, organizes debate, quiz, and sporting contests, and has provided computers and funded computer classes, but it places its highest priority on hiring more teachers and improving their training.&lt;ref name=Today/&gt;

'''Reading for special needs''' has become an area of interest as the understanding of [[Reading (process)|reading]] has improved. Teaching children with special needs how to read was not historically pursued due to perspectives of a [[Reading readiness in the USA|Reading Readiness]] model.&lt;ref name="van Kleeck, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van Kleeck A, Schuele CM |title=Historical perspectives on literacy in early childhood |journal=Am J Speech Lang Pathol |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=341–55 |date=November 2010 |pmid=20581109 |doi=10.1044/1058-0360(2010/09-0038) |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model assumes that a reader must learn to read in a hierarchical manner such that one skill must be mastered before learning the next skill (e.g., a child might be expected to learn the names of the letters in the alphabet in the correct order before being taught how to read his or her name).&lt;ref name="Copeland, Keefe, 2007"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Elizabeth B. Keefe |author2=Susan R. Glaser |author3=Susan Copeland |author4=Elizabeth B. Keefe |title=Effective literacy instruction for students with moderate or severe disabilities |publisher=Paul H. Brookes Publishing |location= |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-55766-837-X |oclc=77011619 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach often led to teaching sub-skills of reading in a decontextualized manner. This style of teaching made it difficult for children to master these early skills, and as a result, did not advance to more advanced literacy instruction and often continued to receive age-inappropriate instruction (e.g., singing the alphabet song).

During the mid-to-late 1970s, the education system shifted to targeting functional skills that were age appropriate for people with special needs.&lt;ref name="Browder, Flowers,2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Browder |first1=D.|last2=Flowers|first2=C.|last3=Ahlgrim-Delzell|first3=L.|last4=Karvonen|first4=M. |last5=Spooner |first5=F.|last6=Algozzine|first6=R.|title=The Alignment of Alternate Assessment Content with Academic and Functional Curricula|journal=The Journal of Special Education|volume=37 |issue=4 |year=2004|pages=211–223|issn=0022-4669|doi=10.1177/00224669040370040101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BrownBranston1979"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brown|first1=L.|last2=Branston|first2=M.

This approach was an improvement to previous practices, but it limited the range of literacy skills that people with special needs developed.&lt;ref name="Copeland, Keefe, 2007"/&gt;

A newer model for reading development, specifically with regard to early reading development, is [[Emergent literacies|emergent literacy]], sometimes referred to as early literacy, model. This model purports that children begin reading from birth, and that learning to read is an interactive process based on children’s exposure to literate activities. It is under this new model that children with developmental disabilities and special needs have been considered to be able to learn to read.&lt;ref name="Erickson"&gt;{{cite book|author= K.A. Erickson|title=All children are ready to learn: An emergent versus readiness perspective in early literacy assessment|year=2000|publisher=Seminars in Speech and Language}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koppenhaver, Erickson, 2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=D.A.

==Literacy==
[[Literacy]] refers to both reading and writing skills, w[[Writing|riting]] being the symbolic representation of language, and r[[Reading (process)|eading]] the cognitive process of decoding and understanding the written symbol system. These are very broad and basic definitions as the definitions of these terms often vary based on the model or approach.

==Approaches and models of reading==
There are multiple models and approaches of reading. A few are discussed below.

===The Simple View of Reading===
The Simple View of Reading was originally described by Gough and Tunmer in 1986&lt;ref name="Gough, Tunmer, 1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gough|first1=P. B.|last2=Tunmer|first2=W. E.|title=Decoding, Reading, and Reading Disability|journal=Remedial and Special Education|volume=7 |issue=1|year=1986 |pages=6–10|issn=0741-9325|doi=10.1177/074193258600700104}}&lt;/ref&gt; and modified by Hoover and Gough in 1990.&lt;ref name="Hoover, Gough, 1990"&gt;{{cite book |author1=W.A. Hoover |author2=P.B. Gough |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Simple View of Reading |year=1990 |publisher=Reading and Writing: An Interdisciplinary Journal |url=http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/class/Psy338K/Gough/Chapter7/simple_view.pdf |access-date=2012-07-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113213423/http://www.homepage.psy.utexas.edu/HomePage/Class/Psy338K/Gough/Chapter7/simple_view.pdf |archive-date=2014-11-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Simple View suggests that the ultimate goal of reading comprehension, and in order to have good reading comprehension, you need to have good decoding ability (e.g., ability to interpret the symbols) and good listening comprehension (e.g., your ability to understand oral language).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kendeou P, Savage R, van den Broek P |title=Revisiting the simple view of reading |journal=Br J Educ Psychol |volume=79 |issue=Pt 2 |pages=353–70 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19091164 |doi=10.1348/978185408X369020 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model predicts four categories of readers.&lt;ref name="Catts, Hogan, 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Catts HW, Hogan TP, Fey ME |title=Subgrouping poor readers on the basis of individual differences in reading-related abilities |journal=J Learn Disabil |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=151–64 |year=2003 |pmid=15493430 |pmc=2848965 |doi=10.1177/002221940303600208 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Catts, Adlof, 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Catts HW, Adlof SM, Weismer SE |title=Language deficits in poor comprehenders: a case for the simple view of reading |journal=J. Speech Lang. Hear. Res. |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=278–93 |date=April 2006 |pmid=16671844 |doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2006/023) |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Readers with poor decoding skills but relatively preserved listening comprehension skills would be considered readers who are poor decoders, or dyslexic. Readers with poor listening comprehension skills are referred to as readers who are poor comprehenders. Readers with poor decoding skills and poor listening comprehension skills are considered poor readers, or sometimes referred to as garden-variety poor readers. Readers who have good decoding and listening comprehension skills are considered typical readers.

===The Connectionist Model of Reading Development===
Connectionist models have emphasized an interconnected and interactive system of mappings between printed words (orthography), spoken sounds/words (phonology), and word meanings (semantics).&lt;ref name="Seidenberg, McClelland, 1989"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Seidenberg MS, McClelland JL |title=A distributed, developmental model of word recognition and naming |journal=Psychol Rev |volume=96 |issue=4 |pages=523–68 |date=October 1989 |pmid=2798649 |doi= 10.1037/0033-295X.96.4.523|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bishop&amp;Snowling"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bishop DV, Snowling MJ |title=Developmental dyslexia and specific language impairment: same or different? |journal=Psychol Bull |volume=130 |issue=6 |pages=858–86 |date=November 2004 |pmid=15535741 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.130.6.858 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Seidenberg MS |chapter=Connectionist models of reading |editors=Gaskell, Gareth; Altmann, Gerry T. M. |title=The Oxford handbook of psycholinguistics |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-19-856897-5 |oclc=104836761 |url=http://lcnl.wisc.edu/publications/archive/118.pdf |accessdate= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202095926/http://lcnl.wisc.edu/publications/archive/118.pdf |archive-date=2014-02-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The computation of these three codes (orthographic, phonologic, and semantic) is required for reading. According to Seidenberg and McClelland,&lt;ref name="Seidenberg, McClelland, 1989"/&gt; one mechanism is involved in reading (including reading regular words, exception words, and nonwords). Through development, experience with meaningful words and spelling-sound correspondences allow one’s representation of semantics, orthography, and phonology to be modified. Developing representations of orthography, phonology, and semantics is an interactive process where development of one component influences and is influenced by the other components.

===Dual-route approach===
The [[Dual-route hypothesis to reading aloud|dual-route approach]] suggests that two separate mechanisms, or routes, can be used in word reading.&lt;ref name="Coltheart, Curtis, 1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coltheart|first1=Max |last2=Curtis|first2=Brent|last3=Atkins |first3=Paul|last4=Haller|first4=Micheal|title=Models of reading aloud: Dual-route and parallel-distributed-processing approaches.|journal=Psychological Review|volume=100|issue=4|year=1993|pages=589–608|issn=0033-295X|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.100.4.589}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schurz M, Sturm D, Richlan F, Kronbichler M, Ladurner G, Wimmer H |title=A dual-route perspective on brain activation in response to visual words: evidence for a length by lexicality interaction in the visual word form area (VWFA) |journal=NeuroImage |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=2649–61 |date=February 2010 |pmid=19896538 |pmc=2989181 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.10.082 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Words that follow spelling-sound rules (including regular words and nonwords that follow letter-to-sound rules) are processed through the nonlexical route. The nonlexical route follows a system of rules specifying the relationship between letters and sounds to process words. Conversely, exception words, or irregular words, that do not follow the spelling-sound rules are processed through the lexical route. The lexical route can be thought of as a dictionary lookup procedure.&lt;ref name="Coltheart, Curtis, 1993"/&gt;

===Whole language===
Reading is a linguistic act. With this, some have applied the whole language philosophy to reading instruction. In the early 1990s, a movement for whole language encouraged educators to view learning to read as being similar to learning to talk.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2002"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psychologicalscience.org/pdf/pspi/reading.pdf |title=How Should Reading be Taught? by K. Rayner, B.R. Foorman, C.A. Perfetti, D. Pesetsky, M.S. Seidenberg (2002) |format=pdf |work=Scientific America inc. |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Norris"&gt;{{cite book|author= J.A. Norris|title=Some Questions and Answers about Whole Language|year=1992|publisher=American Journal of Speech Language Pathology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Norris, Janet |author2=Hoffman, Paul R |title=Whole language intervention for school-age children |year=1993 |publisher=Singular Pub. Group | location=San Diego, Calif. |isbn=978-1-56593-070-4 |oclc=469305849 |pages=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This philosophy emphasizes learning language and reading skills through meaningful experiences instead of through decontextualized rule teaching. Some other terms for this approach of reading instruction include literature-based instruction and guided reading.

===Balanced Literacy Instruction===
To meet the recommendations of breadth and depth of literacy instruction set by the National Reading Panel (2000),&lt;ref name="NRP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/nrp/findings.cfm|title=Report of the National Reading Panel: Teaching Children to Read|publisher=NIHCD|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705194256/http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/nrp/findings.cfm|archivedate=2008-07-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; many literacy programs incorporate four main components: guided reading, which focuses on comprehension skills though exposure to a wide range of literature experiences; word study, which incorporates phonics, phonemic awareness, and vocabulary instruction; self-selected reading, which provides children daily experiences in independent reading time; and writing, which focuses on both the mechanics of composition and on communicating effectively for multiple purposes (Foley &amp; Stables, 2007).&lt;ref name="Copeland, Keefe, 2007"/&gt;

==Populations at increased risk==
Children with language difficulties are at increased risk for reading disorders or difficulties that can occur early on in preschool and continue on throughout development.&lt;ref name="Skibbe"&gt;{{cite book|author1=L.E. Skibbe |author2=K.J. Grimm |author3=T.L. Stanton-Chapman |author4=L.M. Justice |author5=K.L. Pence |author6=R.P. Bowles  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Reading Trajectories of Children with Language Difficulties from Preschool Through Fifth Grade|year=2008|publisher=Language, Speech, and Hearing Services in Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This population includes children with language abilities that fall below expectations for their chronological age, at a clinical level or with weaknesses in language that are not severe enough to meet criteria for a clinical diagnosis of a language disorder.
Children with other disabilities can also have language impairments that can cause an increase risk of developing reading problems. Such disabilities include (but are not restricted to): [[Specific language impairment]], phonological disorder, [[Language disorder]], [[Developmental disability]], [[Autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorder]], [[Down syndrome]], [[Fragile x syndrome]], and [[Cerebral palsy]].

People with severe speech difficulties can use [[Augmentative and alternative communication]] (AAC) devices.  The importance and positive outcomes of literacy for people with language difficulties and AAC users are endless.  As with everyone literacy opens doors to education, employment, and allows “individuals to exchange information, maintain interpersonal communication, to convey needs and wants and to develop channels of personal expression". &lt;ref&gt;Light, J., &amp; Kelford Smith, A. (1993). Home literacy experiences of preschoolers who use AAC systems and of their nondisabled peers. Augmentative and Alternative Communication, 9, 10–25 p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;. However, for the AAC user literacy skills may be of even greater importance as reading and writing  “allows individuals with severe speech impairments the opportunity to initiate topics, to develop ideas, to provide clarification, to communicate independently, to interact with a diverse audience, and to express ideas, thoughts, and feelings.” &lt;ref&gt;Light, J., &amp; Kelford Smith, A. (1993). Home literacy experiences of preschoolers who use AAC systems and of their nondisabled peers. Augmentative and Alternative Communication, 9, 10–25 p.10&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, even given the importance of literacy skills people who use AAC are often not given “authentic learning opportunities“ to learn literacy skills.  &lt;ref&gt;Janet M. Sturm Associate Professor, Stephanie A. Spadorcia, James W. Cunningham, Kathleen S. Cali, Amy Staples, Karen Erickson, David E. Yoder &amp; David A. Koppenhaver (2006) What happens to reading between first and third grade? Implications for students who use AAC, Augmentative and Alternative Communication, 22:1, 21-36 p. 21, DOI: 10.1080/07434610500243826&lt;/ref&gt;.  More research is needed on how to increase literacy instruction to people with severe speech difficulties and users of AAC.

==Intervention Team==

==Subgroups of reading problems==

===Difficulties with decoding===
In general terms, individuals who have challenges in decoding are referred to as poor decoders. [[Dyslexia]] is a more specific disability where individuals demonstrate difficulty with decoding. Poor decoders have not acquired the basic knowledge of sound-letter correspondence rules, specifically phonological skills (skills that include identifying and manipulation of words, syllables, onsets, rimes, and phonemes -individual sounds).  In addition, language abilities often evidence poor morphological and syntactic knowledge.&lt;ref name="Catts, Fey, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Catts HW, Fey ME, Tomblin JB, Zhang X |title=A longitudinal investigation of reading outcomes in children with language impairments |journal=J. Speech Lang. Hear. Res. |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=1142–57 |date=December 2002 |pmid=12546484 |doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2002/093) |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Catts, Kamhi, 2011"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Catts, Hugh William |author2=Kamhi, Alan G. |title=Language and Reading Disabilities (3rd Edition) (Allyn &amp; Bacon Communication Sciences and Disorders) |publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon |location=Boston, Mass |year=2011 |pages= |isbn=0-13-707277-5 |oclc=707726486 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interventions that target decoding abilities may include instruction in [[phonics]], [[phonological awareness]], and [[phonemic awareness]] (also see [[Dyslexia intervention]]).

===Difficulties with reading rate===
Some individuals may have difficulty with reading rate, where they have accurate word recognition  and often normal comprehension abilities, but reading speed that is typically one and a half years below grade level.&lt;ref name="Catts, Kamhi, 2011"/&gt;
Strategies that may improve reading rate include: shared/partner reading, guided reading, repeated reading, and silent reading, listening to another person fluently read (National Reading Panel, 2000;&lt;ref name="Wiebe Griffith"&gt;{{cite book|author1=L. Wiebe Griffith |author2=T.V. Rasinski  |last-author-amp=yes |title=A focus on Fluency: How One Teacher Incorporated Fluency with her Reading Curriculum|year=2004|publisher=The Reading Teacher}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Difficulties with reading fluency===
Individuals may also have trouble with reading fluency, or accurate, smooth, and appropriately paced reading with accurate expression.
Strategies: shared/partner reading, guided reading, repeated reading, and silent reading, listening to another person fluently read (National Reading Panel, 2000&lt;ref name="Wiebe Griffith"/&gt;).

===Difficulties with reading comprehension===
Some individuals may have skills within the normal range on the above factors but may still have trouble with reading comprehension. These individuals are often referred to as [[Reading comprehension|poor comprehenders]], or individuals with a specific comprehension deficit. 
Strategies that can be used to improve reading comprehension include: building oral and auditory language skills, including skills in: vocabulary knowledge, narratives, listening comprehension, and figurative language.&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;{{cite book|author1=P.J. Clarke |author2=M.J. Snowling |author3=E. Truelove |author4=C. Hulme  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Ameliorating Children’s Reading-Comprehension Difficulties: A Randomized Controlled Trial|year=2010|publisher=Psychological Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, when working toward increasing reading comprehension for specific texts, one can preteach vocabulary words and discuss prior knowledge on a topic related to the text before reading. (Also see [[reading comprehension]] for more strategies and information.)

===Mixed reading difficulties===
Children can have difficulties in more than one of the areas previously listed.

==Reading in special populations==
Reading difficulties in special populations such as Downs syndrome, autism, and cerebral palsy follow similar patterns of reading development and reading difficulty as described in the subgroups of reading problems section.

===Down syndrome===
It has been found true for children with intellectual disabilities, such as children with [[Down syndrome]], that phonological awareness skills are often deficient and require targeted teaching.&lt;ref name="Kay-Raining Bird"&gt;{{cite book|author1=E. Kay-Raining Bird |author2=P.L. Cleave |author3=L. McConnel  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Reading and Phonological Awareness in Children with Down Syndrome: A Longitudinal Study|year=2000|publisher=American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, studies have found that children with Down syndrome show deficits in phonological awareness, and though they can develop such skills, often rely on sight word vocabulary knowledge rather than phonological awareness skills to decode words.&lt;ref name="Snowling"&gt;{{cite book|author1=M.J. Snowling |author2=C. Hulme |author3=R.C. Mercer  |last-author-amp=yes |title=A Deficit in Rime Awareness in Children with Down Syndrome|year=2002|publisher=Reading and Writing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given this, it is recommended that phonological awareness skills be taught in a systematic manner with explicit instruction of how to use these skills when reading.

===Autism===
Children with [[Autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorder (ASD)]] have been identified as having particular difficulties with reading comprehension despite normal decoding abilities,.&lt;ref name="O’Connor"&gt;{{cite book|author=N. O’Connor, and P.D. Klein|title=Exploration of Strategies for Facilitating the Reading Comprehension of High-Functioning Students with Autism Spectrum Disorders|year=2004|publisher=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="O’Connor &amp; Hermelin"&gt;{{cite book|author=N. O’Connor, and B. Hermelin|title=Two Autistic Savant Readers|year=1994|publisher=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huemer&amp;Mann"&gt;{{cite book|author1=S.V. Huemer |author2=V. Mann  |last-author-amp=yes |title=A comprehensive profile of decoding and comprehension in autism spectrum disorders|year=2010|publisher=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, those individuals who are especially good at decoding but have poor comprehension are considered to have [[hyperlexia]].&lt;ref name="Nation"&gt;{{cite book|author= K. Nation|title=Reading skills in hyperlexia: A developmental perspective|year=1999|publisher = Psychological Bulletin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all individuals with autism, however, are poor comprehenders as there is a wide range of abilities in children on the spectrum.&lt;ref name="Nation2"&gt;{{cite book|author1=K. Nation |author2=P. Clarke |author3=B. Wright |author4=C. Williams  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Patterns of reading ability in children with autism spectrum disorders|year=2006|publisher = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the type of reader an individual with autism might be, individuals should be given the opportunity to learn to read.&lt;ref name="Mirenda"&gt;{{cite book|author=P. Mirenda|title="He’s not really a reader...": Perspectives on supporting literacy development in individuals with autism|year=2003|publisher=Topics in Language Disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Very few studies have examined the effectiveness of interventions for reading for individuals with ASD.&lt;ref name="Whalon"&gt;{{cite book|author1=K.J. Whalon |author2=S. Al Otaiba |author3=M.E. Delano  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Evidence-based reading instruction for individuals with autism spectrum disorder|year=2009|publisher=Focus on Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Using computer-assisted instruction to implement programs for individuals with ASD that target skills in decoding could be an effective way to help improve these skills in these individuals.&lt;ref name="Heimann"&gt;{{cite book|author1=M. Heimann |author2=K.E. Nelson |author3=T. Tjus |author4=C. Gillberg  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Increasing reading and communication skills in children with autism through an interactive multimedia computer program|year=1995|publisher=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Basil&amp;Reyes"&gt;{{cite book|author1=C.

Irvine |title=Using computer assisted instruction and the nonverbal reading approach to teach word identification|year=2005|publisher=Focus on Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities}}&lt;/ref&gt; Procedural facilitation tasks such as prereading questions, anaphoric cuing, or a cloze task helped to improve reading comprehension with the anaphoric cuing task being the most effective task.&lt;ref name="O’Connor"/&gt;

===Cerebral palsy===
Children with [[cerebral palsy]] (CP) may or may not have motor speech impairments and/or language impairments,&lt;ref name="Hustad"&gt;{{cite book|author1=K.C. Hustad |author2=K. Gorton |author3=J. Lee  |last-author-amp=yes |title= Classification of Speech and Language Profiles in 4-year-old Children with Cerebral Palsy: A Prospective Preliminary Study|year=2010|publisher=Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can lead to reading difficulties. Often children with CP can be classified as having severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI), but children with other disorders can fall into this category as well. Children with SSPI can be at increased risk for reading difficulties not only because they may have language impairments, but also because they can have limited literary experiences and limited reading instruction,.&lt;ref name="Mike"&gt;{{cite book|author=D.G. Mike|title= Literacy and cerebral palsy: factors influencing literacy learning in a self-contained setting|year=1993|publisher=Journal of Literacy Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koppenhaver&amp;Yoder"&gt;{{cite book|author1=D.A. Koppenhaver |author2=D.E. Yoder  |last-author-amp=yes |title= Classroom literacy instruction for children with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI): what is and what might be|year=1993|publisher=Journal of Literacy Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, parents and teachers may have low expectations of the child’s ability to become a reader, which may influence experiences with text and impact literacy instruction.&lt;ref name="Light&amp;McNaughton"&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. Light |author2=D. McNaughton  |last-author-amp=yes |title= Literacy and augmentative and alternative communication (AAC): the expectations and priorities of parents and teachers|year=1993|publisher=Topics in Language Disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assistive technology (also [[augmentative and alternative communication|Alternative and Augmentative Communication devices; AAC]]) can be used to overcome physical barriers to manipulating books, and to augment speech motor and language difficulties (e.g., type, or select symbols to identify rhyming words), and cognitive impairments (to provide needed support required for target skill acquisition) (Copeland &amp; Keef, 2007, see chapter 9).&lt;ref name="Copeland, Keefe, 2007"/&gt; Of course, access to assistive devices is not sufficient for reading development. Appropriate reading instruction is required (e.g., instruction in phonological awareness skills, phonemic awareness skills, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, text comprehension, and book conventions), regularly conducted story reading sessions, constructive AT/AAC use to target literacy skills, high expectations of student literacy achievement, and text-rich environments have been found to be important for developing literacy skills in children with CP.&lt;ref name="Mike"/&gt;

'''Richard C. Miller, Ph.D.''' (born 1948) is a [[Clinical psychology|clinical psychologist]], author, researcher and [[Yoga|yogic]] scholar. He is the founding president of the Integrative Restoration Institute (IRI), co-founder of The International Association of Yoga Therapists (IAYT)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iayt.org/?page=LearnAbout |title=Learn about IAYT |publisher=Iayt.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and founding editor of the professional Journal of IAYT. He is also a founding member and past president of the Institute for Spirituality and Psychology,  Senior Advisor to the Baumann Institute, and was the founding president of the 501(c)(3) nonprofit Marin School of Yoga.

== Professional background ==
For over 40 years, Miller's primary interests have included integrating nondual wisdom teachings of [[Yoga]], [[Tantra]], [[Advaita]], [[Taoism]], and [[Buddhism]] with Western psychology. In addition to his research and writing projects, Miller lectures and leads trainings and retreats internationally.&lt;ref name=irest&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irest.us/about/staff |title=Staff &amp;#124; Integrative Restoration (iRest) |publisher=Irest.us |date= |accessdate=2010-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his mentors, he credits [[T.K.V. Desikachar]] and [[Jean Klein (spiritual teacher)|Jean Klein]].&lt;ref name=irest/&gt;

Miller worked with [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]] and the [[United States Department of Defense]] studying the efficacy of iRest [[Yoga-nidra|Yoga Nidra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.foh.dhhs.gov/eapnews/uscg/winter2010/LetsTalk.pdf |title= |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2010-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528072610/http://www.foh.dhhs.gov/eapnews/uscg/winter2010/LetsTalk.pdf |archivedate=May 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://wn.com/Walter_Reed_Army_Medical_Center&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2016|talk=non specific refence}} The iRest protocol was used with soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan suffering from [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://airforcemedicine.afms.mil/idc/groups/public/documents/afms/ctb_128487.pdf |title= |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2010-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719024228/http://airforcemedicine.afms.mil/idc/groups/public/documents/afms/ctb_128487.pdf |archivedate=July 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--start post navigation--&gt; Previous post Next post |url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2008/05/walter-reed-usi |title=Walter Reed Using Yoga to Fight PTSD &amp;#124; Danger Room |publisher=Wired.com |date= 2008-05-06|accessdate=2010-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=January 2016}} Based on this work, [[Eric Schoomaker]], [[Surgeon General of the United States Army]] endorsed Yoga Nidra as a complimentary alternative medicine (CAM) for chronic pain in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://nccih.nih.gov/news/newsletter/2010_september/militarycare.htm{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing studies are being conducted with the use of the iRest Yoga Nidra protocol as a treatment for PTSD and related symptoms.

'''Robert Charles Venturi Jr.''' (June 25, 1925 – September 18, 2018) was an American [[architect]], founding principal of the firm [[Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates]], and one of the major architectural figures of the twentieth century.

Together with his wife and partner, [[Denise Scott Brown]], he helped shape the way that architects, planners and students experience and think about architecture and the American-built environment. Their buildings, planning, theoretical writings, and teaching have also contributed to the expansion of discourse about architecture.

Venturi was awarded the [[Pritzker Prize]] in Architecture in 1991; the prize was awarded to him alone, despite a request to include his equal partner, Brown. Subsequently, a group of women architects attempted to get her name added retroactively to the prize, but the Pritzker Prize jury declined to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/no-pritzker-prize-for-denise-scott-brown/?_r=0 |title=No Pritzker Prize for Denise Scott Brown |first=Robin |last=Pogrebin |date=14 June 2013 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/01/business/denise-scott-brown-pritzker-prize |title=Denise Scott Brown: Architecture favors 'lone male genius' over women |newspaper=CNN |author= Catriona Davies |date=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ARCHITECTURE VIEW; Robert Venturi, Gentle Subverter of Modernism |author=Goldberger, Paul|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEEDD1338F937A25757C0A967958260|publisher=The New York Times|date=14 April 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venturi is also known for having coined the maxim "Less is a bore", a [[postmodern architecture|postmodern]] antidote to [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Mies van der Rohe's]] famous [[Modernism|modernist]] dictum "Less is more". Venturi lived in [[Philadelphia]] with Denise Scott Brown. He was the father of James Venturi, founder and principal of ReThink Studio.

==Early life and education==
Venturi was born in Philadelphia to Robert Venturi Sr. and Vanna (née Luizi) Venturi and was raised as a [[Quaker]].&lt;ref name=yearbook&gt;The Nassau Herald 1947, Princeton University yearbook&lt;/ref&gt; Venturi attended school at the [[Episcopal Academy]] in [[Merion]], [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

He was awarded the [[Rome Prize Fellowship]] at the [[American Academy in Rome]] in 1954, where he studied and toured Europe for two years.

From 1959 to 1967, Venturi held teaching positions at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he served as Kahn's teaching assistant, an instructor, and later, as associate professor. It was there, in 1960, that he met fellow faculty member, architect and planner [[Denise Scott Brown]]. Venturi taught later at the [[Yale School of Architecture]] and was a visiting lecturer with Scott Brown in 2003 at [[Harvard University]]'s [[Graduate School of Design]].

==Writings==
A controversial critic of the blithely [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalist]] and symbolically vacuous architecture of corporate modernism during the 1950s, Venturi was considered a [[counterrevolutionary]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} He published his "gentle manifesto", ''Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture'' in 1966; in its introduction, [[Vincent Scully]] called it "probably the most important writing on the making of architecture since [[Le Corbusier]]'s [[Towards a New Architecture|''Vers Une Architecture'']] of 1923." The work was derived from course lectures at the University of Pennsylvania, and Venturi received a grant from the [[Graham Foundation]] in 1965 to aid in its completion. The book demonstrated, through countless examples, an approach to understanding architectural composition and complexity, and the resulting richness and interest. Citing [[vernacular]] as well as high-style sources, Venturi drew new lessons from the buildings of architects familiar ([[Michelangelo]], [[Alvar Aalto]]) and then-forgotten ([[Frank Furness]], [[Edwin Lutyens]]). He made a case for "the difficult whole" rather than the diagrammatic forms popular at the time, and included examples — both built and unrealized — of his own work to demonstrate the possible application of such techniques. The book has been published in 18 languages to date.

Immediately hailed as a theorist and designer with radical ideas, Venturi went to teach a series of studios at the [[Yale School of Architecture]] in the mid-1960s. The most famous of these was a studio in 1968 in which Venturi and Scott Brown, together with [[Steven Izenour]], led a team of students to document and analyze the [[Las Vegas Strip]], perhaps the least likely subject for a serious research project imaginable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/lessons-from-las-vegas/|title=Lessons from Las Vegas - 99% Invisible|work=99% Invisible|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Venturi, Scott Brown and Izenour published the folio, ''A Significance for A&amp;P Parking Lots, or [[Learning from Las Vegas]].'' It was revised using the student work as a foil for new theory, and reissued in 1977 as ''Learning from Las Vegas: the Forgotten Symbolism of Architectural Form''. This second manifesto was an even more stinging rebuke to orthodox modernism and elite architectural tastes.  The book coined the terms "Duck" and "Decorated Shed," descriptions of the two predominant ways of embodying iconography in buildings. The work of Venturi, Scott Brown, and [[John Rauch]] adopted the latter strategy, producing formally simple "decorated sheds" with rich, complex, and often shocking ornamental flourishes. Venturi and his wife co-wrote several more books at the end of the century, but these two have so far proved to the most influential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Mark Alan Hewitt |title=Venturi, Robert |work=Grove Art Online |publisher=Oxford Art Online |date=28 November 2011 |url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T2086166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:Guildhouse Philly.JPG|thumb|The [[Guild House (Philadelphia)|Guild House]], completed 1964, on Spring Garden Street, Philadelphia]]
The architecture of Robert Venturi, although perhaps not as familiar today as his books, helped redirect American architecture away from a widely practiced, often banal, modernism in the 1960s to a more exploratory design approach that openly drew lessons from architectural history and responded to the everyday context of the American city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.archdaily.com/130389/interview-robert-venturi-denise-scott-brown-by-andrea-tamas |title=Interview: Robert Venturi &amp; Denise Scott Brown |date=April 25, 2011 |publisher=Archdaily.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venturi's buildings typically juxtapose architectural systems, elements and aims, to acknowledge the conflicts often inherent in a project or site. This "inclusive" approach contrasted with the typical modernist effort to resolve and unify all factors in a complete and rigidly structured—and possibly less functional and more simplistic—work of art. The diverse range of buildings of Venturi's early career offered surprising alternatives to then current architectural practice, with "impure" forms (such as the North Penn Visiting Nurses Headquarters), apparently casual asymmetries (as at the Vanna Venturi House), and pop-style supergraphics and geometries (for instance, the Lieb House).

[[File:Espicopal Acad int.JPG|thumb|Chapel at the Episcopal Academy, Newtown Square, PA. (2010)]]
Venturi created the firm Venturi and Short with William Short in 1960. After John Rauch replaced Short as partner in 1964, the firm's name changed to Venturi and Rauch. Venturi married [[Denise Scott Brown]] on July 23, 1967, in [[Santa Monica, California]], and in 1969, Scott Brown joined the firm as partner in charge of planning. In 1980, The firm's name became Venturi, Rauch, and Scott Brown, and after Rauch's resignation in 1989, Venturi, Scott Brown, and Associates. The firm, based in [[Manayunk, Philadelphia]], was awarded the Architecture Firm Award by the [[American Institute of Architects]] in 1985.  The practice's recent work includes many commissions from academic institutions, including campus planning and university buildings, and civic buildings in London, [[Toulouse]], and Japan.

Venturi's architecture has had worldwide influence, beginning in the late 1960s with the dissemination of the broken-gable roof of the Vanna Venturi House and the segmentally arched window and interrupted string courses of Guild House. The playful variations on vernacular house types seen in the Trubeck and Wislocki Houses offered a new way to embrace, but transform, familiar forms.  The facade patterning of the Oberlin Art Museum and the laboratory buildings demonstrated a treatment of the vertical surfaces of buildings that is both decorative and abstract, drawing from vernacular and historic architecture while still being modern. Venturi's work arguably provided a key influence at important times in the careers of architects [[Robert A. M. Stern]], [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Philip Johnson]], [[Michael Graves]], [[Graham Gund]] and [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]], among others.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Venturi was a Fellow of the [[American Academy in Rome]], the [[American Institute of Architects]], [[The American Academy of Arts and Letters]] and an Honorary Fellow of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]].

==Death==
Venturi died on September 18, 2018, in Philadelphia from complications of [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archpaper.com/2018/09/robert-venturi-passes-away/|title=Robert Venturi passes away - Archpaper.com|website=archpaper.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/19/obituaries/robert-venturi-dead.html&lt;/ref&gt; He was 93.

In the wake of Venturi's death, [[Michael Kimmelman]], the current architecture critic for the ''[[New York Times]]'',  tweeted..."RIP the great, inspiring Robert Venturi who opened millions of eyes and whole new ways of thinking about the richness of our architectural environment, and whose diverse work with Denise Scott Brown contains a mix of wit and humanity that continues to transcend labels and time".&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/kimmelman/status/1042496869564395521&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sanford Louis "Sandy" Palay''' (23 September 1918 in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], United States – 5 August 2002 in [[Concord, Massachusetts]], United States) was an [[United States|American]] scientist and educator.

==Academic Background==
Palay received his bachelor's degree from [[Oberlin College]]. Upon graduation in 1940, he entered the School of Medicine at [[Case Western Reserve]] University to study [[bacteriology]]. He changed his mind, and decided to study medicine, later specializing in neuroscience. He applied for a summer fellowship during his first year of medical school and was accepted into the laboratory of Ernst and [[Berta Scharrer]], where Palay carried out his first investigations. Palay's professional and personal association with the Scharrers continued throughout his career.

After completing his M.D. degree in 1943, Palay spent a year as an intern at New Haven Hospital, while in the evenings continuing his research into neurosecretion at the Department of Anatomy at [[Yale University]]. At the end of his internship, he returned to [[Case Western Reserve]], with appointments as a research and teaching fellow.

==World War II==
[[Berta Scharrer|Ernst Scharrer]] suggested that Palay consider going to the [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute]] to work with [[Albert Claude]], an early researcher into cell biology. However Palay was called up to serve with the [[Medical Corps (United States Army)|Army Medical Corps]] in occupied Japan. This interrupted his scientific career, but he began a lifelong interest in Japanese art and culture.

==Scientific Research==
On his return from the forces, Palay took Ernst Scharrer's advice and went to the Rockefeller Institute to work with [[Albert Claude]]. They spent a year examining salivary gland chromosomes by electron microscopy, using [[formvar]] replicas. This was one of the few means available at that time for examining biological specimens by electron microscopy.

==National Institutes of Health==
Eventually Palay returned to Yale, where he was appointed first as an Instructor and then as an Assistant Professor of [[Anatomy]], where he remained until his appointment as Chief of [[Neurocytology]] at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in [[Bethesda, Maryland]]. Later, he was promoted to the position of Chief of the Laboratory of Neuroanatomical Science, and while he was at the NIH, he continued his work on the ultrastructure of synapses, as well as studying [[neurosecretion]] and [[neuroglia]].

==Harvard Medical School==
In 1961, Palay accepted an invitation to become the Bullard Professor of Neuroanatomy at [[Harvard Medical School]]. A dominant figure in the field of the fine structure of the nervous system, Palay and his colleagues improved the quality of preservation of central nervous tissue by the introduction of a method to fix central nervous tissue by perfusion with osmic acid.

He and his wife [[Victoria Chan-Palay]] carried out detailed analyses of the cerebellum, and this work culminated in the publication of their book
''Cerebellar Cortex: Cytology and Organization'' (published in 1974). In 1970, he co-authored ''The Fine Structure of the Nervous System'' (with Alan Peters and Harry Webster) to serve as a guide in the analysis of electron micrographs of the nervous system; three editions have been published, the last one in 1991.

==Boston College==
After his retirement from Harvard, Palay accepted a position as Distinguished Scholar-in-Residence in the Department of Biology at [[Boston College]]. Even when his health began to decline, Palay taught until the spring of 2002; his students visiting his home for their seminars. He also served on several graduate student thesis committees during this period, and shared his expertise in neurocytology with the Biology Faculty at [[Boston College]].

In 1980, he agreed to become the Editor-in-Chief of the ''Journal of Comparative Neurology'', which he edited for fourteen years; even after his retirement from Harvard in 1989, he continued as Editor-in-Chief, doing his work in the basement of his home in Concord.

He also served on the editorial boards of scientific
publications as the ''Journal of Neurocytology'', the ''Journal of Cell Biology'', ''Neuroscience'',
''Brain Research'', ''Experimental Brain Research'',    
''Experimental Neurology'' and ''Ultrastructural Research''.

==Awards==
* In 1982 he was awarded the [[Ralph W. Gerard Prize in Neuroscience]].

Started in 2014, '''Schools of Equality''' is a non-profit organization aimed to shift social attitudes of youth surrounding gender-based violence and other injustices. They work with youth and students in various cities and villages in south India. The organization was founded by Gulika Reddy, a human rights lawyer practicing in the High Court of Madras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ratnakumar|first=Evelyn|title=Towards countering gendered designs |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/towards-countering-gendered-designs/article6622617.ece |publisher= The Hindu |accessdate=2016-08-01 |date= 2014-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programmes ==
Their programmes are designed to encourage students to question notions of power related to gender and its intersectionalities, including caste, class, religion and sexuality. They also help understand the right of choice and to respect each other's rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shenoy|first=Sonali|title= A Syllabus to Change Social Attitudes at a Young Age |url= http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/A-Syllabus-to-Change-Social-Attitudes-at-a-Young-Age/2014/12/08/article2560130.ece|publisher= New Indian Express|accessdate= 2016-08-01 |date= 2014-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Joseph |first= Ashish |title= Namma Chennai's heart beats for its children |url= http://epaperbeta.timesofindia.com/Article.aspx?eid=31807&amp;articlexml=Namma-Chennais-heart-beats-for-its-children-29092015101023 |publisher= Times of India |accessdate= 2016-08-01 |date= 2015-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They helped children understand and deal with bullying and the students of Sishya, Adyar in Chennai came up with a ‘school constitution’ that includes the right to be protected from bullying. The team at Schools of Equality works with students to help them come to terms with different issues, whether it is their own identity or gender equality. The students are taught to recognise their rights and the responsibilities that come with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kishore|first=Kavita|title= Tackling Bullying Through Democracy |url= http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tackling-bullying-through-democracy/article7107192.ece|publisher= The Hindu |accessdate= 2016-08-01 |date= 2015-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of June 2015, School of Equality has partnered with the [[Corporation of Chennai]] and District Education Officer in Kadapa district, [[Andhra Pradesh]]. They also teamed up with private schools as well as village schools. They started with 165 students in Chennai in June and as of 2016 they are working with over 1441 students across the city,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shapers|first=Global|title=School of Equality|url= https://www.globalshapers.org/projects/schools-equality-1|publisher= Globalshapers |accessdate= 2016-08-01 |date= 2016-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; in private and government schools, addressing a range of topics pertaining to gender violence.

They have worked with students of class XI and XII and looking to introduce the awareness programme for lower classes as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sampath|first=Janani|title=Ending gender violence begins at home|url= http://www.dtnext.in/News/National/2015/11/25183645/Ending-gender-violence-begins-at-home.vpf|publisher= DT Next|accessdate= 2016-08-01 |date= 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workshops==
Schools of Equality also conducted a workshop in partnership with Stop Street Harassment from [[Virginia]], USA that calls out to people to share their experiences and raise their voice against street harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Veda|first=Nadenla|title=How Many Streets Will We Avoid?|url= http://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2014/12/stop-street-harassment/|publisher= Youth Ki Awaaz|accessdate= 2016-08-01 |date= 2014-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3058">'''Sofia Lovisa Gråå''' [[née]] ''Palm'', (1749 – 8 May 1835&lt;ref&gt;ssa.stockholm.se, [http://www3.ssa.stockholm.se/bildarkiv/egenproducerat/mantalsbok/M3506011048_150dpi.pdf Klara döda]&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] educator of actors, and noted for innovations that in modern times would be described as feminist.

==Biography==

Sofia Lovisa Palm was from 1788 married to Fredrik Gabriel Gråå, the interpreter for the Russian embassy in [[Stockholm]], who died in 1795. She was principal of the [[Dramatens elevskola]], the acting school of Sweden's [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]], in Stockholm, from 1804 to 1812. She also, during her period as principal, oversaw student housing, with the female students in fact living in her home.

Gråå advocated for continuation of the French acting traditions introduced in the 1793–1798 tenure of the French-born and -trained [[Anne Marie Milan Desguillons]] and her husband Joseph. She was the first woman to hold this position alone. It was a difficult position at this point, during the temporary dissolution of the [[Royal Swedish Opera]] in 1806–09, which caused confusion in the Theatre's organisation.

She gave the girls in her house great personal freedom; choir master Wikström was shocked that she allowed the girls to date teenage boys. Gråå herself paid no mind to the criticism and did not find her treatment of the students irresponsible; when she retired, she stated in her apply for a pension that she had accepted the position without any promise of economic compensation in her contract, and that she had always conducted a respectable and caring way to perform her task both as a principal and as a hostess for the female student's dorm. She retired in 1812 and was succeeded by [[Caroline Halle-Müller]].

She educated many of the best known actors of the first half of the 19th century in Sweden, including [[Justina Casagli]], [[Charlotta Eriksson]], [[Sara Torsslow]] and [[Karolina Bock]]; the female students graduating during this time were often referred to as "The Gråå Girls".

'''Standard-setting study''' is an official research study conducted by an organization that sponsors [[Test (student assessment)|tests]] to determine a cutscore for the test.  To be legally defensible in the US,  in particular for [[High-stakes testing|high-stakes assessments]], and meet the [[Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing]], a cutscore cannot be arbitrarily determined; it must be empirically justified. For example, the organization cannot merely decide that the cutscore will be 70% correct. Instead, a study is conducted to determine what score best differentiates the classifications of examinees, such as competent vs. incompetent. Such studies require quite an amount of resources, involving a number of professionals, in particular with psychometric background. Standard-setting studies are for that reason impractical for regular class room situations, yet in every layer of education, standard setting is performed and multiple methods exist.

Standard-setting studies are typically performed using focus groups of 5-15 subject matter experts that represent key stakeholders for the test.  For example, in setting cut scores for educational testing, experts might be instructors familiar with the capabilities of the student population for the test.

==Types of standard-setting studies==
Standard-setting studies fall into two categories, item-centered and person-centered.  Examples of item-centered methods include the Angoff, Ebel, Nedelsky,&lt;ref&gt;Nedelsky, L. (1954). Absolute grading standards for objective tests. Educational and Psychological Measurement, 14, 3–19.&lt;/ref&gt; and Bookmark methods, while examples of person-centered methods include the Borderline Survey and Contrasting Groups approaches. These are so categorized by the focus of the analysis; in item-centered studies, the organization evaluates items with respect to a given population of persons, and vice versa for person-centered studies.

Item-centered studies are related to [[criterion-referenced test]]s and to [[Norm-referenced assessment|norm-referenced tests]].

===Item-centered studies===

* '''Angoff Method'''&lt;ref&gt;Zieky, M.J. (2001). So much has changed: how the setting of cutscores has evolved since the 1980s. In Cizek, G.J. (Ed.), ''Setting Performance Standards'', p. 19-52. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; (item centered):  This method requires the assembly of a group of subject matter experts, who are asked to evaluate each item and estimate the proportion of minimally competent examinees that would correctly answer the item.  The ratings are averaged across raters for each item and then summed to obtain a panel-recommended raw cutscore. This cutscore then represents the score which the panel estimates a minimally competent candidate would get.  This is of course subject to [[cognitive biases|decision biases]] such as the [[overconfidence effect|overconfidence]] bias.  Calibration with other, more objective, sources of data is preferable. Several variants of the method exist.
* '''Modified Angoff Method''' (item-centered): Subject matter experts (SMEs) are generally briefed on the Angoff method and allowed to take the test with the performance levels in mind. SMEs are then asked to provide estimates for each question of the proportion of borderline or “minimally acceptable” participants that they would expect to get the question correct. The estimates are generally in p-value type form (e.g., 0.6 for item 1: 60% of borderline passing participants would get this question correct). Several rounds are generally conducted with SMEs allowed to modify their estimates given different types of information (e.g., actual participant performance information on each question, other SME estimates, etc.). The final determination of the cut score is then made (e.g., by averaging estimates or taking the median). This method is generally used with multiple-choice questions.
* '''Dichotomous Modified Angoff Method''' (item-centered): In the dichotomous modified Angoff approach, instead of using difficulty level type statistics (typically p-values), SMEs are asked to simply provide a 0/1 for each question (“0” if a borderline acceptable participant would get the question wrong and “1” if a borderline acceptable participant would get the item right)
* '''Nedelsky Method''' (item-centered): SMEs make decisions on a question-by-question basis regarding which of the question distracters they feel borderline participants would be able to eliminate as incorrect. This method is generally used with multiple-choice questions only.
* '''Bookmark Method''' (item-centered): Items in a test (or a representative subset of items) are ordered by difficulty (e.g., IRT response probability value) from easiest to hardest. SMEs place a "bookmark" in the "ordered item booklet" such that a student at the threshold of a performance level would be expected to respond successfully to the items prior to the bookmark with a likelihood equal to or greater than the specified response probability value (and with a likelihood less than that value for items after the bookmark). For example, for a response probability of .67 (RP67) SMEs would place a bookmark such that an examinee at the threshold of the performance level would have at least a 2/3 likelihood of success on items prior to the bookmark and less than a 2/3 likelihood of success on the items after the bookmark“ This method is considered efficient with respect to setting multiple cut scores on a single test and can be used with tests composed of multiple item types (e.g., multiple-choice, construct response, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, D. M., Mitzel, H. C., Green, D. R. (June, 1996). Standard Setting: A Bookmark Approach. In D. R. Green (Chair), IRT-Based Standard-Setting Procedures Utilizing Behavioral Anchoring. Paper presented at the 1996 Council of Chief State School Officers National Conference on Large Scale Assessment, Phoenix, AZ.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitzel, H. C., Lewis, D. M., Patz, R. J., &amp; Green, D. R. (2000). The Bookmark Procedure: Cognitive Perspectives on Standard Setting. Chapter in Setting Performance Standards: Concepts, Methods, and Perspectives (G. J. Cizek, ed.). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, D. M., Mitzel, H. C., Mercado, R. L., &amp; Schulz, E. M. (2012). The Bookmark Standard Setting Procedure. Chapter in Setting Performance Standards: Foundations, Methods, and Innovations Second Edition (G. J. Cizek, ed.). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Person-centered studies===
Rather than the items that distinguish competent candidates, person-centered studies evaluate the examinees themselves. While this might seem more appropriate, it is often more difficult because examinees are not a captive population, as is a list of items.
For example, if a new test comes out regarding new content (as often happens in [[information technology]] tests), the test could be given to an initial sample called a beta sample, along with a survey of professional characteristics. The testing organization could then analyze and evaluate the relationship between the test scores and important statistics, such as skills, education, and experience. The cutscore could be set as the score that best differentiates between those examinees characterized as "passing" and those as "failing."

* '''Borderline groups method''' (person-centered): A description is prepared for each performance category. SMEs are asked to submit a list of participants whose performance on the test should be close to the performance standard (borderline). The test is administered to these borderline groups and the median test score is used as the cut score. This method can be used with virtually any question type (e.g., multiple-choice, multiple response, essay, etc.).
* '''Contrasting groups method''' (person-centered): SMEs are asked to categorize the participants in their classes according to the performance category descriptions. The test is administered to all of the categorized participants and the test score distributions for each of the categorized groups are compared. Where the distributions of the contrasting groups intersect is where the cut score would be located. This method can be used with virtually any question type (e.g., multiple-choice, multiple response, essay, etc.).

'''Sungkyunkwan''' was the foremost educational institution in [[Korea]] during the late [[Goryeo]] and [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] Dynasties.  It is located in its original location at the south end of the Humanities and Social Sciences Campus of [[Sungkyunkwan University]] in Seoul, South Korea.  Today, it is managed by the local government.  Twice a year in May and September, the ceremonial rite ''[[Seokjeon Daeje]]'' is performed in the [[Munmyo|Munmyo Shrine]] portion of the old campus to honor [[Confucius]] and the Confucian sages of China and Korea.

== Meaning of Sungkyunkwan ==
* Sung (성, 成) – Accomplish, Achieve, To become capable, successful or to win. “To perfect or develop human nature”
* Kyun (균, 均) – Balance, To be, Strengthen culture according to social standards or norms.  “To build a good society”
* Kwan (관, 館) – Institute, Academy, University

== Predecessors of Sungkyunkwan ==
* Taehak (태학, 太學, Great School) founded in 372 by [[Goguryeo|Goguryeo Kingdom]] during the reign of [[Sosurim of Goguryeo|King Sosurim]]
* [[Gukhak]] (국학, 國學, National School) founded in 682 by [[Sinmun of Silla|King Sinmun]] of the [[Later Silla|Unified Silla Dynasty]]

== History of Sungkyunkwan ==
[[Gukjagam]] (국자감, 國子監), the highest educational institution during the [[Goryeo Dynasty]], was established in November 992 by [[Seongjong of Goryeo|King Seongjong]] in Goryeo's capital city, Gaegyeong (개경) (Modern day [[Kaesong]].  It was originally a palace outbuilding called Taemyon (태묜).

In 1089, under the reign of [[King Munjong of Goryeo|King Munjong]] new official buildings were constructed.

Its name was changed to Seonggyungam (성균감) in 1298.

In 1304 it was reestablished by [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] scholar [[An Hyang]] who is considered the founder of [[Korean Confucianism|Neo-Confucianism in Korea]].

The name was changed to Seonggyungwan in 1308 under reign of [[Chungnyeol of Goryeo|King Chungnyeol]].

The name was changed back to Gukjagam in 1358 during the reign of [[Gongmin of Goryeo|King Gongmin]].

In 1362 the name was changed back to Seonggyungwan.

After the founding of the [[Joseon Dynasty]] in 1392, [[Taejo of Joseon|King Taejo]] decided to relocate Sungkyunkwan to [[History of Seoul|Hanyang]], modern day [[Seoul]], and also founded 360 [[Hyanggyo]]s nationwide in July 1398, establishing a national education system.

Sungkyunkwan was established in Hanyang on September 25, 1398.

A fire destroyed some buildings in 1400 which were rebuilt in 1407.

In 1418 [[Taejong of Joseon|King Taejong]] initiated a tradition for royal princes to enter Sungkyunkwan.

During the reign of the tyrannical [[Yeonsangun of Joseon|King Yeongsangun]], Sungkyunkwan was turned into a personal pleasure ground.  When he was deposed, it was restored to its former status.

Sungkyunkwan was rebuilt again in 1601 after many buildings were burnt down including the Munmyo area during the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)|Japanese invasions (1592 - 1598)]].

In 1784, Byeokipjae (벽입재, 闢入齋) was destroyed by a fire.  It is no longer present on the current campus grounds.

In 1869 there was a major renovation/restoration of the old campus.

In 1894 the [[Gabo Reform]] occurred which abolished the national state examinations during the reign of [[Gojong of Korea|King Gojong]].

In 1895, Sungkyunkwan was reformed into a modern three-year university.

During the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Colonial Era]] between 1910–1945, royal Sungkyunkwan was demoted to a private institution and renamed Gyunghakwon (경학원, 經學院), while Korean education was prohibited and Japanese education was forced nationwide.

After Korea gained independence in 1945, Gyeonghakwon was renamed to Sungkyunkwan and with funding from Yurim ([[Confucian]]s) nationwide, [[Sungkyunkwan University]] was established.

During the [[Korean War|Korean War (June 25, 1950 – July 27, 1953)]], much of the campus was destroyed.  Daeseongjeon, however, remained.

In 1954 Gyeseongsa (계성사, 啓聖祠) was removed.  Gyeseongsa was the shrine for the parents of the Confucian sages.  It used to house the [[spirit tablet]]s of the important family members of Confucian scholars.

The latest renovation/restoration occurred in 1988.

There was Japanese-style landscaping throughout the old campus left over from the Colonial Era that was eventually removed over the most recent decades to restore Sungkyunkwan to its original Joseon Era form.

== Buildings, Structures, and Features ==
*Myeongnyundang (명륜당, 明倫堂): The name means "Hall of Enlightenment".  It was originally built in 1398.  The center room was used for ceremonies, lectures, rituals, tests, and other important events.  The two smaller rooms were used for faculty research and private meetings.  It is depicted on the [[South Korean won#New series|1,000 KRW bill]]. 
*Daeseongjeon (대성전, 大成殿): The name means "Great Achievement Hall".  The current version of the building was reconstructed in 1602 and restored many times.  The calligraphy on the sign board on the building is the work of [[Han Seok-bong]], one of the greatest calligraphers of the Joseon Dynasty.  building that holds a memorial for Confucius.  It is the main building of Munmyo Shrine and houses the spirit tablets of the notable Confucian scholars from China and Korea.  Thirty-nine of the tablets held in Munmyo are inside Daeseongjeon which include Confucius, the four Chinese nobles, and the eighteen Korean sages.  Originally, Chinese Confucians were revered more but since 1945, a greater emphasis has been placed on the important Korean scholars.  The purpose of the building and the courtyard area is to facilitate Confucian rituals and ceremonies designed to honor Confucius and the notable scholars since filial piety is an essential aspect of Confucian philosophy.  
*Dongmu (동무, 東 廡): This building makes up the eastern side of Munmyo.  It was used to store the spirit tablets of Confucian scholars and other important relics.  There used to be 133 tablets that were housed in Daeseongjeon, Dongmu, and Seomu but the amount was decreased to focus more on the Korean sages.  Since it is located to the east, more important tablets and relics were kept inside.  It is connected to the main entrance of the campus Dongsammun (Eosammun) on its north side.
*Seomu (서무, 西 廡): This building makes up the western side of Munmyo.
*Dongsammun (동삼문) or Eosammun (어삼문): This was the main entrance of Sungkyunkwan which is located on the east side.  It was designed with three square doorways which was the trend at the time. The entrance is not dressed up with the ornate decorations or a special roof which further emphasizes the Confucian concept of humility.
*Sinsammun (신삼문): The name means "Spirit Three Door/Gate".  The purpose of the gate is not to be used for the entrance of living people but for the spirits of the Confucian sages and scholars to pass through.  The doors are only opened during important ceremonies.
*East Malmun (동말문, 東末門): This is the door people enter in during ceremonies. 
*West Malmun (서말문, 西末門): This is the door people exit from during ceremonies.   
*Dongjae (동재, 東齋): This was the eastern dormitory.  It makes up the eastern side of the courtyard in front of Myeongnyundang.  Those students that were royalty stayed in the eastern dormitory due to east being the favored direction.  Also those from the more dominant political factions or those from Hanyang would stay in Dongjae. 
*Seojae (서재, 西齋): This was the western dormitory.  It makes up the western side of the courtyard in front of Myeongnyundang.  The students from the areas outside of Hanyang or the less dominant political faction stayed there. 
*Jongyeonggak (존경각, 尊經閣): The name means, "To revere the classics highly."  It was originally constructed in 1475 during the reign of [[Seongjong of Joseon|King Seongjong]].  It was the only university library in Korea until the year 1900.  Volumes housed in the library were exclusively Confucian books. During the Japanese occupation, most of the books were taken to the library of [[Keijō Imperial University]], the predecessor of [[Seoul National University]], and the remaining books were moved to the Central Library of Sungkyunkwan University after the completion of the new campus in 1953.
*Jeongnokcheong (정록청, 正錄廳): This was the administration office building:  It served as the office for the head of the school and its administrators.  It is not painted royal red but it has a doorway from the main entrance that was purposefully made lower so that those who passed through were forced to bow out of respect.  It is designated [[Historic Sites of South Korea|National Korean Historic Site No. 143]].
*Jikbang (직방, 直房): This is a rectangular structure that acted as a waiting area.
*Seolicheong (서리청, 書吏廳): This structure was for the office clerks working for Sungkyunkwan’s Administrative Office.
*Chang-go (창고) or Seobyeokgo (서벽고): This building was for the people who managed the carriages and horses for transportation and the storage of the necessary tools and materials involved.  
*Bibokcheong (비복청, 婢僕廳, Servant Hall): This building was used by the servants at Sungkyunkwan.
*Hyanggwancheong (향관청, 享官廳): This building was originally used to store incense and written ritual prayers, but eventually it was used for as an office for those who presided over the ancestral rites.
*Seowollang (서월랑, 西月廊): This building was used by the inspectors in charge of inspection of Sungkyunkwan.
*Dongwollang (동월랑, 東月廊): This building was also used by the inspectors.
*Jinsasikdang (진사식당, 食堂): The cafeteria where students had their meals and where attendance was taken.  Students needed 300 points to take the national civil service examinations to graduate and one of the ways they got them was by attending meals.
*Jaegigo (제기고, 祭器庫): This structure was for storing the materials for the rituals performed in Munmyo such as the plates used to hold the food that was sacrificed to the sages. 
*Yugilgak (육일각, 六一閣): This building was used to store sporting equipment, mainly archery tools such as bows and arrows.
*Subokcheong (수복청, 守僕廳): This building was the office for the people in charge of preparing rituals as well as restoration and grounds-keeping of Sungkyunkwan.
*Jeonsacheong (전사청, 典祀廳): This building was used to prepare the food that was sacrificed and hold the vessels for the rituals performed in Munmyo.  
*Poju (포주, 庖廚): This is the kitchen where the sacrificial food was prepared for the rituals at the shrine.
*Bicheondang (비천당): This was the State Exam Hall.  It was originally built in 1664 and was reconstructed in 1988.  The name means, “Enlightening the great way,” which is cited from the famous Confucian, [[Zhu Xi]].  It has a unique intricately-painted ceiling.  The questions of the exam would be written on a large scroll out front and the students would answer them in essay form while sitting on the ground as an act of humility.
*Myojeongbigak (묘정비각, 廟庭碑): This small structure is a shelter for a monument of Confucius.  There is a large stone turtle contained within with a large stone tablet on its back with a sizeable amount of hanja calligraphy engraved on it. The stone turtle symbolizes the longevity of Sungkyunkwan and Confucianism.
*Tangpyeongbigak (탕평비각): This monument was erected in 1742 with a stone stele inside bearing a message from [[Yeongjo of Joseon|King Yeongjo]] that states, “The mind of a nobleman embraces all segments without dividing them into factions, while the mind of an unworthy is incapable of embracing all segments and divides them into factions.”  The message is a reference to how the king would appoint officials without regard for political affiliation according to the “policy of impartiality” known as "Tangpyeong (탕평)".  
*Ginkgo trees: The two oldest [[Ginkgo biloba|ginkgo]] trees in Sungkyunkwan ([[Natural monuments of South Korea|Natural Monument No. 59]]) were planted in 1519 by Yun Tak, the head instructor at the time.  The ginkgo leaf is the modern symbol of Sungkyunkwan University.  It is said that Confucius liked to instruct his students under the shade of ginkgo trees.  All trees in Sungkyunkwan are male, not bearing fruit, as the institution originally forbade any females from entering.  Also, the fruit of the ginkgo produces an unpleasant smell. 
*Hayeondae (하연대): This was a parking place for sedan chairs.  This is where the king parked his palanquin before entering the campus. 
*Hamabi (하마비): This was a dismounting point.  Anyone who was on horseback or in a palanquin would have to dismount or disembark before passing this stone tablet.  The inscription loosely means, “Passing into a holy place”.

There are also some buildings, structures, and features that were removed:
* Gyeseongsa (계성사, 啓聖祠): This structure was the shrine for the parents of the Confucian sages.  It used to house the tablets of the important family members of Confucian scholars.
* Ilyangjae (일양재, 一兩齋): This building along with Byeongipjae was along the western wall of Sungkyunkwan on the side of the courtyard in front of Bicheondang where students would take exams. It was used for ritualistic purposes.
* Byeokipjae (벽입재, 闢入齋): This building was just south of Ilyangjae and was also used for Confucian rituals most-likely associated with the taking of examinations.
* Bansu (반수, Stream in front of Sungkyunkwan) – There was once a small stream running around the front exterior of Sungkyunkwan.  The location of water to the south is in line with Chinese Feng Shui (풍수, 風水, Pungsu) aesthetics that were popular at the time that emphasize certain nature elements as a way of ensuring the proper flow of [[qi]]  throughout a structure.
* Bansugyo (반수교, 泮橋) or Bangyo (반교): This was the entrance bridge that went over Bansu Stream.  The area to the east of Sungkyunkwan was named after the bridge. This area was associated with providing services for the school.
The institution's administrator had a [[Joseon Dynasty politics|government rank]] of sampum (삼품), with lower-ranking officials of Jwaeju (좨주), Akjeong (악정), Jikgang (직강), Baksa (박사), Hakjeong (학정), Haknok (학록), and Hagyu (학유) as supporting staff.

== Design Features ==
The old campus was designed based on [[geomancy]].  Sungkyunkwan was built with the mountains behind it to the north and the front facing south towards water (한강, Hangang, The [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]], and Bansu (반수), the creek that used to run around the front of the campus).  This was based on superstition as well as function.  The sunlight and wind patterns were considered most ideal when the buildings were arranged this way.

The buildings are constructed of [[Pinus densiflora|red pine]] which was considered very special in the Joseon Dynasty and laypeople were forbidden from logging them.  Korean aristocrats believed red pine represented the Confucian virtues of “fidelity” and “fortitude”.  Today red pine is even mentioned in the South Korean national anthem “Aegukga” (애국가, 愛國歌).

The windows were made using window paper (한지, 韓紙, Hanji).  The paper used was handmade from the inner bark of [[Paper mulberry]] which grows on rocky Korean mountainsides (닥).  This was combined with the mucilage that oozes from the roots of [[Abelmoschus manihot]] which helps suspend the individual fibers in water.  The hanji is made in laminated sheets using the we bal (외 발) sheet formation method allowing for a multi-directional grain.  The finished sheets are then pounded using a method called dochim (도침) to compact the fibers and lessen ink bleed.

The stone platforms (기단, Gidan) used for several of Sungkyunkwan’s buildings are made of rectangular granite slabs fit together into a rectangular structure.  The height of the platforms symbolizes the importance of the buildings.  Much of the stonework from the original construction of the buildings remains exposed.  There is also a sizeable percentage that is still present but has been buried beneath the structures due to time and renovations/reconstructions.

Platform stones (주춧돌, Juchutdol) are stones in which pillars rest on.  They block humidity from the ground as well as bear the load of the pillars in order to efficiently redistribute the weight of the building to the ground.

The timber framed structures contain such components as:
* Crossbeam (보, Bo) – Horizontal crossbeam placed perpendicularly to the pillars to support the load of the roof.  Large bo are called daebeulbo (대블보) or daeryang.
* Purlin (도리, Dori) – Wood pieces that support a rafter at a right angle from the bo.
* Rafter (서까래, Seokkarae) (aka 연목, Yeonmok) – The horizontal sides of a roof made of thin and long wood pieces whose edges form the eaves.
* King Post (대공, Daegong) – A short post that supports the ridgepole.
* Bracts (공포, Gongpo) (aka 포, Po) – Similar to what its name refers to a gongpo is a complex wooden structure resembling the base of a flower that supports the roof.  The purpose of the gongpo is to optimally distribute the roof load to the pillars.
* Eaves (처마, Cheoma) – The portion of the rafters that extends beyond the pillar supporting it from underneath.  The cheoma are long to provide more shade from the high sun in summer months while in the winter, the low sun can still penetrate deep into the interior of the house.  The deep eaves also prevent warm indoor air from escaping from the heated floor.  To make the eaves look less heavy, they are lifted at the corners forming the distinctive curved lines.
The different types of pillars (기둥, Gidung) used are:
* Wide Based Pillar (민흘림기둥, Minheullim Gidung)
* Straight Pillar (징닙주기둥, Jingnipju Gidung) (aka 원통기둥, Wontong Gidung)
* Entasis Pillar (배흘림기둥, Baehaeullim Gidung)
* Straight Pillar (각기둥, Gak Gidung) 
The types of wooden flooring are:
* Veranda (툇마루, Toenmaru)
* Balcony (누마루, Numaru)
* Checkered Floor (우물마루, Umulmaru) – Wooden floors were designed in this pattern to compensate for the expansion and contraction of the wood due to changes in temperature and moisture in order to avoid warping of the wood.
* Main Hall (대청마루, Daecheongmaru) – The name means “Big Floor”. 
* Long-plank Floor (장마루, Jangmaru)
The floors of many of the buildings were equipped with [[ondol]] traditional radiant floor heating.

The buildings are painted based on the Korean art of painting buildings which is called Dancheong (단청) which means “red and green”.  The incorporation of the five elements epitomizes ancient Korean’s desire for stability and peace in the present life and a rewarding afterlife.  The brightly colored paint on buildings is not only for decoration, it is also for protecting the buildings from weather, rot, vermin, and evil spirits as well as emphasize the authority of their residents.  The red-colored paint on Sungkyunkwan's buildings symbolizes nobility.  Only the most important buildings are painted red.  There are five basic colors: blue, red, black, white, and yellow which symbolize the five traditional elements.  Blue means east, dragon, spring, and wood.  Red means south, birds, summer, and fire.  White means west, tiger, fall, and gold.  Black means north, [[Black Tortoise|hyeonmu]], winter, and water.  Yellow means center, the periods between seasons, and Earth.

The roofs (Jibung, 지붕) are made of clay tiles (기와, Giwa) and are decorated with figurines called japsang (잡상).  There is always an odd number of the smaller japsang.  The most a building can have is 11.  The purpose of the roof decorations goes back to the [[Korean shamanism|Korean shamanic religion]] and they are intended to chase away evil spirits and misfortune as well as show the dignity and grandeur of a building.  The first few japsang on a roof are usually characters from the Chinese classic [[Journey to the West]].  The types of japsang are:
* Dragon’s Head (용두, Yong-du)
* Eagle’s Head (취두, Chwui-du)
* Owl’s Tail (치미, Chi-mi)
* Buddhist Monk (대당사부, 玄奘, Daedangsabu, Xuanzang)
* Monkey King (손행자, 孫悟空, Sonhaengja, Sun Wukong)
* Friar Sand “Sandy” (사화상, 沙悟凈, Sahwasang, Shā Wùjìng)
* Igwibak (이귀박)
* Iguryong (이구룡)
* Mahwasang (마화상)
* Bodhisattva (삼살보살, Samsalbosal)
* Cheonsangap (천산갑)
* Natodu (나토두)
There are four types of roofs in Joseon Era architecture used at Sungkyunkwan which are matbae (맞배, gable), ujingak (우진각, hipped), paljak (팔작, hip-and-gable), and samo (사모, pyramid).

Courtyards (안마당, Anmadang) were an important aspect of Joseon Dynasty architecture.  They served a practical purpose of allowing large groups to congregate for meetings and activities.  Beyond this, they fulfilled the Joseon aesthetic principle of the pure beauty of empty space.  Korean buildings were designed to be in close harmony with nature which is reflected in many ways, none more so than in the use of courtyards, complete with trees and vegetation, within the walled-in areas.

The name signboards on structures (간판, Ganpan) are large wooden signs written in [[Hanja]] and served to identify them as well as display their importance.  More important buildings had special names and their signs were larger and more decorative.

The windows (창문, Changmun) were made of wooden frames lined with hanji paper allowing for natural air to penetrate through the windows as well natural light to enter the room.  The height and size of windows was based on the standard height and shoulder width of an adult person.  The height of window frames was designed to be low enough to rest an elbow on but high enough to conceal a person lying down.

== Education ==
The primary written language of Sungkyunkwan was hanja.  Although [[hangul]] was invented in 1443, it did not become the primary language of study because the literary elite believed that the difficult hanja was more sophisticated.  Hangul was invented to solve the widespread illiteracy of the common people at the time, but it was considered a threat by many in the upper class to their status as literary scholars, leading them to resist its implementation.  As a result, hanja remained the written language used at Sungkyunkwan requiring anyone who wished to rise to the top levels of the government to be capable of reading and writing the characters.

Sungkyunkwan's teachings were mainly Confucian-related, and were primarily aimed at preparing students for government service.  Students also studied law, medicine, interpretation, accounting, archery, mathematics, music, and etiquette.

The main goal was for the students to pass the higher [[gwageo|national civil-service examinations]] (''gwageo''). Like [[imperial examination|their Chinese counterpart]], these examinations were on writing ability, knowledge of the [[Confucian classics]], and proposals of management of the state (governance).  Technical subjects were also included to appoint experts in medicine, interpretation, accounting, and law.

Poetry was a big part of both the students’ studies and communication. It was viewed as noble and proof of the students’ high-born lineage.  They were heavily encouraged to read and compose poetry.

The students were required to write lengthy essays on a regular basis that were subject to strict criticism from their instructors.  The middle ten days of every month were dedicated to literary exercises.  There were regular tests every 10 days and there were also daily quizzes.

The original set number of students was 150 when Sungkyunkwan was founded, which was raised to 200 in 1429.  All of the students were male and women were forbidden from entering the campus.

Books on Buddhism and Taoism were banned.

Joseon Era students attended [[Seodang]] from ages 5 or 6 where they learned rudimentary penmanship, basic essential skills, and the Chinese classics.  The students’ education began with reading the "[[Thousand Character Classic]]".  The teaching methodology emphasized rote learning by reading and memorizing an assigned passed each day.  Once a student read something more than one hundred times, they would recite it to their teacher (훈장, Hunjang).  At age 15 or 16 students entered hyanggyo or seowon (서원, 書院, Private primary school) for advanced studies targeted on passing examinations.  They would study there for five or six years.

Entrance examinations for Sungkyunkwan were extremely harsh and were only allowed for the sons of [[yangban]], the Joseon Era upper class or royalty.  There were two ways to be accepted into Sungkyunkwan.  Either the students had to pass the two admission exams, Saeng-wonsi (생원시) and Jinsasi (진사시), or take the other two examinations, Seungbo (승보) and Eumseo (음서).  If they passed these examinations, they were given the opportunity to be accepted.

Students lived very comfortably on full scholarship and were waited on by servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sung Kyun Kwan|url=http://www.exploringkorea.com/sung-kyun-kwan/|publisher=Exploring Korea|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students were informed of the time throughout the day by drum beats.  One beat indicated the time to get up (6:00 AM every day), two beats meant it was time to dress neatly and read, and three beats meant it is meal time.

In the early morning, when the drum was sounded signaling the start of the day, students would prostrate themselves once before entering Myeongnyundang to receive a lecture on Confucianism.

Classes were held at the Lecture Hall from 10:00 AM to 10:00 PM.

The students were divided into 2 classes based on academic abilities

If students received low marks they were punished and publicly humiliated.

Students would sneak out after 10:00 PM to study more.

Students would sometimes appeal to the king about unjust decisions and if they were rejected they would stage political demonstrations, fast, or boycott classes.

The 8th and 23rd days of each month were washing days for the student’s clothing.

The students' uniforms were originally red then changed to sky blue to symbolize the endless spring of knowledge.

Throughout the Joseon Era the students were divided into multiple political factions (붕당, 朋黨, [[Political factions in Joseon Dynasty|Bungdang]]) that influenced the national politics and the study of Neo-Confucianism.  Originally the [[Hungu (Korean political faction)|Hungu]] faction was the most dominant and the more radical [[Sarim]] faction was often subject to [[Korean literati purges|violent purges]] to eliminate political opponents.  Eventurally the Sarim became the dominant faction.  The Sarim, however, split many times into smaller factions over the following centuries due to political in-fighting.  The students at Sungkyunkwan would often play important roles in these political conflicts.

During the Joseon Dynasty the highest aspiration those in the upper class could have was to be a [[seonbi]] (선비, Virtuous Scholar).  They believed that the more important way to improve oneself was through continuious study while adhering to the principles of Confucianism.  Much of this can still be seen in modern Korean culture's emphasis on the importance of education and respect for one's elders or superiors.

The requirements for graduation included:
* 300 Points (원점, Wonjeom) from Dogi (도기, Student Attendance Book) needed to be qualified to take the advanced state exams to graduate (1 Point per sign in)
* Passing the state civil-service examinations
* No fixed date for graduation
* Only 30 students were allowed to graduate each year out of the 50 selected to take the exams.

== Noteworthy Facts ==
The king, as a disciple before Confucius, would take off his royal robes and wear plain clothes before stepping into the courtyard of the Confucian Shrine.  The kings would usually never set foot on the ground outside of the palaces anywhere but Sungkyunkwan.

The path between Sinsammun and Daeseongjeon was originally considered sacred and only for the spirits.  People were not allowed to step on it or face punishment.  Even today the Confucian keepers of the shrine bow before stepping on it.

Students were not allowed to have pets.

Alcohol consumption was allowed within reason and students were sometimes given liquor or wine as a present.

The worst offense a student could commit, resulting in them not being allowed to take the state exams was not showing instructors proper respect or making disparaging remarks about them.

The students had the right to protest which they often did for various academic and political reasons.

[[Yi I]], a famous Joseon scholar and politician is an alumnus and is featured on the 5,000 won bill.

[[Sejong the Great|King Sejong]] is an alumnus and is featured on the 10,000 won bill.

[[Shin Saimdang]], Yi I's mother, is on the 50,000 won bill.

Chojip (초집) were how-to guide booklets used by cheaters.

The sodu (소두) was the chairman of a committee who would put forth appeals to the king.

The students' class list was called the cheonggeum nok (청금곡, 靑矜錄, Blue Robe Book).

== Sungkyunkwan in Fiction ==
Sungkyunkwan was featured prominently in the popular [[Korean drama]] "[[Sungkyunkwan Scandal|Sunkyunkwan Scandal]]".

'''''The Ignorant Schoolmaster: Five Lessons in Intellectual Emancipation'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-fr|Le Maître ignorant: Cinq leçons sur l'émancipation intellectuelle}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a 1987 book by the philosopher [[Jacques Rancière]] on the role of the teacher and individual towards individual liberation. Rancière uses the example of [[Joseph Jacotot]], a French teacher in the late 18th century who taught in Belgium without knowledge of their language (Flemish), to explain the role of liberation after Marxism. The work expresses [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseauist]] ideas, e.g. in the state of nature humans are morally good, and emphasizes that individual change precipitates societal change. Its arguments draw heavily from the French socialist party's debates on education during the 1980s. It was translated to English in 1991 by [[Kristin Ross]].

==Writing Style==
Rancière's philosophy informs his writing style. Rancière tells the story of 18th century French teacher Joseph Jacotot without explicit commentary. Translator Kristin Ross sees the book as uniting Rancière's archival-narrative and polemical styles (xxiii). She considers that the book may be a satirical polemic against modern sociology, targeting specifically the sociologists [[Pierre Bourdieu]], Rancière's teacher [[Louis Althusser]], and [[Jean-Claude Milner]] (xxiii). The book is a historical moment intervening politically in the present; this is effected by Rancière blurring his voice with that of Jacotot (xxi-ii). Rancière's choice to write the book as a story reflects his rejection of explication, teaching and writing which presumes an intellectual inequality between the writer and reader (xxii). Translator Kristen Ross writes: "The very act of storytelling, an act that presumes in its interlocutor an equality of intelligence rather than an inequality of knowledge, posits equality, just as the act of explication posits inequality" (xxii). The book is equally relevant to history as to philosophy of education; in the U.S. Rancière is best known among historians (xxi).

== Main Concepts ==
'''Stultifying Master vs. Emancipatory Master'''
The explicator, "having thrown a veil of ignorance over everything that is to be learned, he appoints himself to the task of lifting it" (6-7). Only by concealing knowledge from the student is the explicator able to teach it. This makes the student dependent on the master.
Ranciere also calls this "Enforced stultification" (7). The emancipatory master, on the other hand, teaches students only that he has nothing to teach them. This emancipates students from their dependence on explicators. However, this does not mean no master is necessary (12). What is emancipation? "We will call the known and maintained difference of the two relations-- the act of an intelligence obeying only itself even while the will obeys another will-- emancipation" (13). In other words, the student's intelligence is not reliant on the master's, but the master's will strengthens the student's will, the student's self-confidence, to learn independently. "To emancipate an ignorant person, one must be, and one need only be, emancipated oneself, that is to say, conscious of the true power of the human mind" (15).

'''Learned Master vs. Ignorant (School) Master'''
"It goes without saying that a scientist might do science without explicating it. But how can we admit that an ignorant person might induce science in another?" (14). While exiled in Belgium, the French-speaking Jacotot taught Flemish-speaking students about the Télémaque using a bilingual French-Flemish translation (1-2). His students learned to intelligently read and write about the Télémaque in French, despite having no prior French instruction (2). Later, Jacotot taught other subjects that he didn't know anything about, including painting and the piano (15).

'''The Circle of Power'''
A circle of powerlessness ties the student to the explicator of the old method (15). "The circle of power, on the other hand, an only take effect by being made public" (15). To break the circle of powerlessness, Ranciere argues that "the circle of emancipation must be ''begun''" (16). This, for Rancière, calls for a return to original "universal teaching," meaning learning something without any means of having it explained. "In reality, universal teaching has existed since the beginning of the world, alongside all the explicative methods. This teaching, by oneself, has, in reality, been what has formed all great men" (16).

'''Universal teaching'''
Jacotot's method "was not a method for instructing the people; it was a benefit to be announced to the poor; they could do everything any man could. It sufficed only to announce it" (18). Thus, for Rancière, emancipation becomes a political act of affirming and awakening the equal intelligence of all people. He writes: "All men have equal intelligence" (18)

== Reception ==
A review in ''French Studies'' wrote that the book would have a small audience outside France due to the specificity of its themes, the resurgence of [[right-wing politics]], and growing unemployment in which few would have the leisure to pursue the inward dialogue Rancière recommends.{{sfn|Brockliss|1994}}

'''''The Making of an American''''' is a 1920 short [[silent film]] used as an [[educational]] tool in the [[governmental]] [[Americanization]] initiatives to [[Cultural assimilation|assimilate]] [[immigrants]] into mainstream culture, especially by encouraging them to learn the [[English language]]. It was produced for the State of [[Connecticut]] Department of Americanization by the Worcester Film Corp., a company founded in 1918 in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]].The film was rediscovered and preserved by [[Northeast Historic Film]] (NHF) a regional moving image [[archive]] in [[New England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://oldfilm.org/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=9&amp;products_id=116/ | title=The Making of an American | publisher=Northeast Historic Film}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis of film==
An enterprising young Italian who comes to America is forced to take a position as a day laborer, which is far below his ability and standard of living, solely because he cannot speak English. Even a laborer, however, must know the language of the country where he is employed, as Pete soon found to his cost. An unattended freight elevator, a sign in English that he could not read, a struggle of an instant, and then the hospital. It was a sadder and wiser man who came out a few weeks later. When he passed the post office, and a saw a sign in several languages calling upon foreigners to learn English, and to attend night school, he was prepared for the message that was destined to change the entire course of his life. Night school for Pete was the result. Anyone familiar with such work will experience anew the keen realization of what it means to the newcomer, the crowded roomful of eager listeners, trying so hard, following so patiently and docilely, the enthusiastic teacher's efforts, in short, the making of Pete. He now is able to secure a suitable position and rises rapidly.
:''Education Film Magazine'' (1920)

===Cast===
*Emile De Verny - Italian immigrant

==Production and background==
Vintage Connecticut government reports on the making of the film and its dissemination, indicate that the film was shown to more than 112,500 people the year it was made, and that copies were sold to other states interested in [[Americanization]] programs. The film was targeted to [[Industry|industrial]] workers and contains location filming at the [[Hartford]] [[Rubber]] Works Company.&lt;ref name="Eagan2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Eagan|title=America's Film Legacy: The Authoritative Guide to the Landmark Movies in the National Film Registry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=deq3xI8OmCkC&amp;pg=PA71|year=2010|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-0-8264-2977-3|pages=71–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was lost until 1999 when Alan Kattelle donated a film copy among a collection of other reels to Northeast Historic Film. The Kattelle print was on [[28 mm film|28mm film stock]], an extremely rare format that was primarily used for educational film distribution from 1913 to 1923.&lt;ref name="Eagan2010"/&gt;

In 2005, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2005/05-262.html | title=Librarian of Congress Adds 25 Films to National Film Registry | publisher=Library of Congress | date=December 20, 2005 | author=Sheryl Cannady}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''This Magazine''''' is an independent alternative [[Canada|Canadian]] political magazine.

==History and profile==
The magazine was launched "by a gang of school activists" in April 1966&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Writer’s Guide to Canadian Literary Magazines &amp; Journals|url=https://blog.magazine-awards.com/2013/11/07/a-writers-guide-to-canadian-literary-magazines-journals/|work=National Magazine Awards|accessdate=24 April 2017|date=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as ''This Magazine is About Schools'', a journal covering political issues in the education system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://circle.ubc.ca/bitstream/handle/2429/1847/ubc_1992_spring_rothstein_harley.pdf?sequence=1|title=The New School, 1962=1977|work=University of British Columbia|date=January 1992|accessdate=17 May 2012|quote=The most important source of early writing on Canadian alternative education is ''This Magazine Is About Schools'', founded in 1966 by Bob Davis, George Martell, and Satu Repo.|page=19|author=Harley S.

Known simply as This since 1995, it started out as This Magazine Is About Schools in 1966. Bob Davis, Satu Repo, and George Martell, a trio of radical teachers, put the first issue together in the basement of an alternative school on a farm near Guelph, Ontario.|author=Miryana Goloubovich|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224045835/http://www.rrj.ca/m3769/|archivedate=24 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973 the title was changed to ''This Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Red Maple Foundation|url=https://www.canadahelps.org/en/charities/red-maple-foundation/|work=Canada Helps|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its early years, its editorial offices were located near the [[University of Toronto]] in space rented from Campus Co-operative Residences Inc., which in the late 1960s spawned the experimental "free university" [[Rochdale College]]. The educational philosophy of Rochdale College was influenced by this association, and by several individuals who published in ''This Magazine'', especially [[Dennis Lee (author)|Dennis Lee]]. The name was shortened to simply ''This Magazine'' in 1973, and it gradually expanded its focus to include a wide variety of political, arts and cultural writing from a progressive perspective.&lt;ref name="dan"&gt;{{cite news|author=Daniel H. Johnson|title=This Magazine Is About Schools|url=https://blogs.brown.edu/hallhoag/2014/12/05/this-magazine-is-about-schools/|accessdate=25 August 2016|work=Brown University|date=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''This Magazine'' is one of Canada’s longest-publishing alternative journals.&lt;ref name=RyersonReviewOfJournalism2002summer/&gt; Praised for integrating commentary and investigative reporting with in-depth arts coverage, it has been instrumental in trumpeting the new works of young Canadian writers and artists. ''This Magazine'' has introduced the early work of some of Canada's most notable writers, critics and artists.

''This Magazine'' is published on a bimonthly&lt;ref name="dan"/&gt; by the Red Maple Foundation, a registered charity, and receives financial support from the Canada Council for the Arts and the Ontario Arts Council. It is indexed in the Canadian Periodical Index, the Canadian Literary Press Index, Alternative Press Index and the Canadian Magazine Index, and on microfiche and microfilm from University Microfilm, Ann Arbor, Michigan.

The magazine's current editor is Erica Lenti, and its current publisher is Lisa Whittington-Hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://this.org/about/|work=this.org|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4053">The '''Toller Lecture''' is an annual lecture at the [[University of Manchester]]'s [https://www.alc.manchester.ac.uk/history/research/centres/former-centres/mancass/ Manchester Centre for Anglo-Saxon Studies (MANCASS)]. It is named after [[Thomas Northcote Toller]], one of the editors of ''[[An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Scragg 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Notable lecturers have included [[Janet Bateley]], the first Toller lecturer,&lt;ref&gt;"Manuscript Layout and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", in Scragg 2003, pp. 1–23.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rolf Bremmer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Looking Back at Anger: Wrath in Anglo-Saxon England |journal=Review of English Studies |volume=275 |year=2015 |pages=423–48 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Brown (scholar)|George Brown]], [[Michelle P.

It was therefore decided to publish recent Toller lectures as a separate collection which appeared in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gale Owen-Crocker]], "Introduction", in Insley and Owen-Crocker 2017, p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:UPEACE-campus.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Costa Rica campus]]

The creation of the University for Peace was set in motion by a treaty and endorsed by resolution 34/111 of 14 December 1979 of the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. By this Resolution, the UN General Assembly established an international commission which, in collaboration with the Government of Costa Rica, was requested to prepare the organization, structure and setting in motion of the University for Peace. Thereafter, by [http://www.upeace.org/pdf/resolution.pdf Resolution 35/55 of 5 December 1980],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN General Assembly Resolution on Establishment of UPEACE|url=http://www.upeace.org/pdf/resolution.pdf|publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; the UN General Assembly endorsed the treaty establishing  the University for Peace by adopting the [http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201223/volume-1223-I-19735-English.pdf International Agreement for the Establishment of the University for Peace] (UPEACE) along with the [http://www.upeace.org/pdf/charter.pdf Charter of the University for Peace].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charter of the University for Peace annexed to the International Agreement Establishing the University for Peace|url=http://www.upeace.org/pdf/charter.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University has the unique status of not only being a dedicated institution for higher education in Peace and Conflict studies, but also an international treaty body organization mandated by the United Nations General Assembly.

It offers [http://www.upeace.org/academic/index.cfm master's degree and doctoral programmes] at its main headquarters in [[San José, Costa Rica]], and carries out various activities related to the international peace and security objectives of the [[United Nations]] (UN) through centres and offices located in Addis Ababa, Geneva, New York, The Hague, and South Korea, and through partnership arrangements with numerous other institutions worldwide.

=== Relationship with United Nations ===

The University for Peace is part of the academic wing of the UN system, and has observer status at the UN General Assembly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=See 'Other Resources' at http://www.un.org/en/peace/ |url=https://www.un.org/en/peace/|publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; while maintaining its [[academic freedom|independence in academic]], financial and management matters. The [[UN Secretary-General]] is the Honorary President of UPEACE. The UN General Assembly maintains a constant interest in the activities of UPEACE, and in periodic resolutions calls on the UN Secretary-General to report to it on its activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN General Assembly Resolution A/RES/64/83|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N09/466/81/PDF/N0946681.pdf?OpenElement|publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the UN Secretary-General reports to the General Assembly of the UN periodically on the progress of UPEACE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the UN Secretary General on the University for Peace, A/64/281, dated 11 August 2009.|url=http://www.upeace.org/PDF/SG's%20Report%20-%202009%20(English).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Council of the University for Peace is the supreme authority of the University. It is composed of five ''ex-officio'' members viz. the Rector, two representatives designated by the UN Secretary-General and by the Director-General of the [[UNESCO]], the Rector of the United Nations University, two representatives designated by the Government of the host country and the Chancellor of UPEACE. In addition, the Council comprises ten representatives of the academic community or other persons eminent in the field of peace and security appointed by the Secretary-General of the UN in consultation with the Director-General of the UNESCO.

=== Accreditation ===

The University has "unique world-wide authorization to award academic degrees, recognized by all countries which are members of the General Assembly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upeace.org/about-upeace/accreditation|title=University for Peace|website=www.upeace.org|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, its MA programs in the Department of Environment, Peace and Development, received official accreditation from SINAES (the national Costa Rican accreditation body) in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upeace.org/about-upeace/accreditation/update-on-upeace-accreditation-process|title=University for Peace|website=www.upeace.org|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the MA programme in International Law and Human Rights, and the MA programme in International Law and the Settlement of Disputes received accreditation from SINAES in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.upeace.org/news/two-programmes-from-the-international-law-department-receive-official-quality-accreditation._2016-09-09|title=Two programmes from the International Law Department receive Official Quality Accreditation.|website=University for Peace|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the fact that UPEACE offers unique MA programs that cannot be found anywhere else in the world means that it is the best and only choice for those who want to study the specific fields of Peace Education; Gender and Peacebuilding; Media, Peace and Conflict Studies; Responsible Management and Sustainable Development; etc.

== Headquarters and main campus ==

The University for Peace has its headquarters in Costa Rica, a country distinguished by a long tradition of democracy. Costa Rica abolished its army in 1948, the former President, H.E. [[Oscar Arias Sánchez]] was awarded The [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1987 and the country continues to develop strong efforts for natural conservation - not to mention the friendly locals. The main campus of the University - the [[Rodrigo Carazo Odio|Rodrigo Carazo]] Campus - is located 30&amp;nbsp;km Southwest of San Jose, within a natural reserve composed of a secondary forest and the last remnant of primary forest (200 ha) in the Central Valley of Costa Rica. Hence, this protected area is very rich in fauna. It shelters mammals such as monkeys and deer; reptiles; and over 300 species of birds, as well as approximately 100 varieties of trees. The University's installations and protected area make up 303 ha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upeace.org/about/campus/|title=About UPEACE|website=University for Peace|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The closest town to the mountain on which the University is perched, is [[Ciudad Colon]]. Most of the students, staff and faculty members of the University reside in Ciudad Colon, making it one of the most multi-cultural places in the world for its size.

The Rodrigo Carazo campus of the University for Peace is the principal location for the activities of the University. Most of its [http://www.upeace.org/academic/index.cfm Masters programmes] and its recently announced [http://www.upeace.org/academic/doctorate/ Doctoral programme] are administered from this campus. Students coming from several countries study in a highly [[multiculturalism|multi-cultural]] environment on the campus. The University boasts of a highly accomplished [http://www.upeace.org/faculty/index.cfm faculty], that comprises a mix of both resident and visiting faculty members. Because of the structure of the programmes and its unique global status, the University has an [http://www.upeace.org/calendar/index.cfm academic calendar] that enables bringing on board the most highly acclaimed academicians and practitioners from around the world. The University has also started administering [http://www.upeace.org/academic/distance/ distance education courses], including an online Masters Programme from the main campus.

The University also carries out hands-on training beyond its Masters and Doctoral Programmes aimed at practitioners and policy makers rather than graduate students. The University has established two Centres for this purpose that are located on the main campus. The [http://www.centre.upeace.org/ UPEACE Centre for Executive Education] delivers dynamic training courses to leaders from around the world. The Centre reaches out to nonprofit leaders, business executives, educators at all levels, UN staff, students and other professional audiences. According to the Centre's website, the approach to all its courses is innovative, interactive, and participant-centered, using case-studies and field trips when appropriate. The Centre aims to develop key leadership skills by incorporating the crosscutting themes of Intercultural Communication, Negotiation and Conflict Resolution and Teambuilding.

The University has also established the [http://www.hrc.upeace.org/ UPEACE Human Rights Centre] which was created within the contours of the broader mission of the University to provide humanity with an international institution of higher education for peace and with the aim of promoting among all human beings the spirit of understanding, tolerance and peaceful coexistence, to stimulate cooperation among peoples and to help lessen obstacles and threats to world peace and progress, in keeping with the noble aspirations proclaimed in the [[Charter of the United Nations]]. In particular, the work of the UPEACE Human Rights Centre seeks to promote understanding, respect and enjoyment of [[universal human rights]]. The Centre carries out this objective through human rights education, training, research, capacity building and awareness raising activities. The website of the UPEACE Human Rights Centre states that the Centre takes a practice based approach to the respect, protection and fulfillment of human rights and promotes the integration of theory and practice. The Centre also takes a multi-disciplinary approach to human rights and attaches equal importance to all human rights. Over the last few years, the UPEACE Human Rights Centre has conducted several training courses for policy makers, staff members of the UN and other inter-governmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, practitioners, academics and civil servants.

The Headquarters and main campus of UPEACE also hosts the International Secretariat of the [[Earth Charter Initiative]], whose stated mission is "to promote the transition to sustainable ways of living and a global society founded on a shared ethical framework that includes respect and care for the community of life, ecological integrity, [[universality (philosophy)|universal]] human rights, [[respect for diversity]], [[economic justice]], [[democracy]], and a culture of peace." This mission is carried out using '[[The Earth Charter]]' as the principal guiding framework. The Earth Charter is an international declaration of fundamental values and principles considered useful by its supporters for building a just, [[sustainability|sustainable]], and peaceful global society in the 21st century. In 2012, the Earth Charter Initiative and UPEACE were jointly awarded the UNESCO Chair on Education for Sustainable Development and the Earth Charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNESCO Chair on ESD and Earth Charter, awarded jointly to EC Initiative and UPEACE|url=http://www.earthcharterinaction.org/content/categories/Education/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work related to this UNESCO Chair will be carried out at the newly constructed 'Earth Charter Center for Education for Sustainable Development' at the UPEACE main campus.

In addition to the activities at the Costa Rica Headquarters Campus, UPEACE works with an increasing number of partners in various parts of the world to ensure that the UPEACE mission is extended to reach as many individuals and institutions as possible.

== Around the world ==

'''Africa'''

As a result of extensive international consultations, which have underlined the importance of according a high priority to activities in Africa, the University for Peace (UPEACE) officially launched its Africa Programme in January 2002.

The University for Peace (UPEACE) established its [https://web.archive.org/web/20060629044240/http://www.africa.upeace.org/ Africa Programme] in 2002 on the basis of extensive consultations in the continent which aimed at developing a programme that responded to the true needs, aspirations and obstacles for education for building peace in Africa. From its inception, the programme focused on the necessity to stimulate and strengthen the capacity in Africa to teach, train and conduct research in areas of peace and conflict studies.

The first five years of the programme focused on the development of curricula and teaching materials and the delivery of a range of short courses, workshops, conferences and seminars in various parts of Africa. Within this period, the programme attracted close to one thousand participants from Academia, Policy makers and civil society organisations.

In a second five-year plan, which came out of a consultative meeting held in March 2007 with partners, the programme will additionally, work with a number of Partner Universities to develop full-fledged master's degree programmes to be based at African Universities. The principal aim of this endeavour is to further strengthen the African capacity and build a wide expertise for a better understanding of conflicts in Africa, their prevention and the creation of the environment favourable to lasting peace and development in the region.

'''Europe'''

In January 2012, UPEACE created a new Centre at [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]] ([http://www.upeace.nl/ UPEACE The Hague]), which is housed at the Academy Building of the [[Peace Palace]], next to The [[Hague Academy of International Law]]. UPEACE The Hague will focus on education and research at the forefront of peace studies, closely cooperating with academic and policy-oriented institutions in The Hague region. UPEACE The Hague will initially advance three fields where it can be innovative and complementary: Peace &amp; Conflict Studies, Water &amp; Peace, and Urban Peace &amp; Security. In addition, UPEACE The Hague will strengthen peace education in The Hague region by organising professional trainings, lectures, seminars, and workshops. Educational and research programmes will be characterised by the interaction between theory and practice, also contributing to policy innovations, and will therefore be appealing to both academics and professionals.

The Geneva Office of UPEACE, established in 2001, has continued to support the development of the overall activities of the University, in particular its regional programmes in Africa and Central Asia. The key focus of work undertaken by the Geneva office is contributing to the development of programme activities of the University in Africa and the Middle East, engaging with the academic community in Geneva to establish joint teaching and training courses on issues of particular relevance to the expertise available within the international community in Geneva and facilitation of relations within Europe and with the United Nations system, national delegations, donor community and academic institutions.

'''Asia-Pacific'''

In 2010, the [http://upeaceap.org UPEACE Asia Pacific Centre] (UPAPC) was established in Seoul, The Republic of Korea. The Centre carries out important activities as a think tank for development studies and provides post-graduate training programmes(Masters) in The Republic of  Korea. The Republic of Korea acceded to the International Agreement for the establishment of the University for Peace and Charter of the University for Peace on June 11, 2010.

'''Asia'''

The [http://www.upeace.org/academic/spec_masters/alp.cfm Asia Leaders Programme], a Dual Campus Master Programme, is a shared initiative between the [[Nippon Foundation]] and the University for Peace, in collaboration with [[Ateneo de Manila University]], which aims to provide students from Japan and other Asian countries with an opportunity to pursue a peace studies post graduate degree with a content-based language-training module. This offers the support for individuals who do not have a proficient command of English to work in this increasingly common international language and to become comfortable in their professional abilities as they gain academic skills. As part of the programme, students have also the opportunity to apply their academic and practical knowledge through a four-month internship at the end of the Master courses.

'''Affiliated institutions'''

Article 4 of the Charter of the University for Peace reads: "the University may enter into association or conclude agreements with Governments and intergovernmental and other organizations and institutions in the field of education." The University for Peace signed agreements with the governments of Serbia (formerly Yugoslavia), Colombia and Uruguay to open centres in those three countries. These centres have the necessary legal status to enjoy autonomy and academic freedom, while keeping its humanistic purpose within the framework of both the Charter of the University for Peace and the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

The European Centre for Peace and Development (ECPD) in Belgrade, Serbia; the World Centre for Training and Research in Conflict Resolution (WCCR) in Bogotá, Colombia; and the World Centre for Research for Peace (CMIP) in Montevideo, Uruguay, have developed close links with their respective governments while being key UPEACE partners in areas of common interest. UPEACE keeps operational agreements with them and lends its logos when necessary in order to undertake joint activities within the framework of UPEACE's and the Centres’ mission. These activities, as with other partners, involve the cooperating parties working together at all stages of jointly agreed-upon projects.
